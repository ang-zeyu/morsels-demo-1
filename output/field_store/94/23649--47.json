The vision never once failed me. It led me straight to the place like a  star in the heavens. I found--the Tablets of the Gods.\"    Dr. Laidlaw caught his breath, and steadied himself on the back of a  chair. The words fell like particles of ice upon his heart. For the  first time the professor had uttered the well-known phrase without the  glow of light and wonder in his face that always accompanied it.    \"You have--brought them?\" he faltered.    \"I have brought them home,\" said the other, in a voice with a ring like  iron; \"and I have--deciphered them.\"    Profound despair, the bloom of outer darkness, the dead sound of a  hopeless soul freezing in the utter cold of space seemed to fill in the  pauses between the brief sentences. A silence followed, during which Dr.  Laidlaw saw nothing but the white face before him alternately fade and  return. And it was like the face of a dead man.    \"They are, alas, indestructible,\" he heard the voice continue, with its  even, metallic ring.    \"Indestructible,\" Laidlaw repeated mechanically, hardly knowing what he  was saying.    Again a silence of several minutes passed, during which, with a creeping  cold about his heart, he stood and stared into the eyes of the man he  had known and loved so long--aye, and worshipped, too; the man who had  first opened his own eyes when they were blind, and had led him to the  gates of knowledge, and no little distance along the difficult path  beyond; the man who, in another direction, had passed on the strength of  his faith into the hearts of thousands by his books.    \"I may see them?\" he asked at last, in a low voice he hardly recognized  as his own. \"You will let me know--their message?\"    Professor Ebor kept his eyes fixedly upon his assistant's face as he  answered, with a smile that was more like the grin of death than a  living human smile.    \"When I am gone,\" he whispered; \"when I have passed away. Then you  shall find them and read the translation I have made. And then, too, in  your turn, you must try, with the latest resources of science at your  disposal to aid you, to compass their utter destruction.\" He paused  a moment, and his face grew pale as the face of a corpse. \"Until  that time,\" he added presently, without looking up, \"I must ask  you not to refer to the subject again--and to keep my confidence  meanwhile--_ab--so--lute--ly_.\"          3      A year passed slowly by, and at the end of it Dr. Laidlaw had found it  necessary to sever his working connexion with his friend and one-time  leader. Professor Ebor was no longer the same man. The light had gone  out of his life; the laboratory was closed; he no longer put pen to  paper or applied his mind to a single problem. In the short space of  a few months he had passed from a hale and hearty man of late middle  life to the condition of old age--a man collapsed and on the edge of  dissolution. Death, it was plain, lay waiting for him in the shadows of  any day--and he knew it.    To describe faithfully the nature of this profound alteration in his  character and temperament is not easy, but Dr. Laidlaw summed it up to  himself in three words: _Loss of Hope_. The splendid mental powers  remained indeed undimmed, but the incentive to use them--to use them for  the help of others--had gone. The character still held to its fine and  unselfish habits of years, but the far goal to which they had been the  leading strings had faded away. The desire for knowledge--knowledge for  its own sake--had died, and the passionate hope which hitherto had  animated with tireless energy the heart and brain of this splendidly  equipped intellect had suffered total eclipse. The central fires had  gone out. Nothing was worth doing, thinking, working for. There _was_  nothing to work for any longer!    The professor's first step was to recall as many of his books as  possible; his second to close his laboratory and stop all research. He  gave no explanation, he invited no questions. His whole personality  crumbled away, so to speak, till his daily life became a mere mechanical  process of clothing the body, feeding the body, keeping it in good  health so as to avoid physical discomfort, and, above all, doing nothing  that could interfere with sleep. The professor did everything he could  to lengthen the hours of sleep, and therefore of forgetfulness.    It was all clear enough to Dr. Laidlaw. A weaker man, he knew, would  have sought to lose himself in one form or another of sensual  indulgence--sleeping-draughts, drink, the first pleasures that came to  hand. Self-destruction would have been the method of a little bolder  type; and deliberate evil-doing, poisoning with his awful knowledge all  he could, the means of still another kind of man. Mark Ebor was none of  these. He held himself under fine control, facing silently and without  complaint the terrible facts he honestly believed himself to have been  unfortunate enough to discover. Even to his intimate friend and  assistant, Dr. Laidlaw, he vouchsafed no word of true explanation or  lament. He went straight forward to the end, knowing well that the end  was not very far away.    And death came very quietly one day to him, as he was sitting in the  arm-chair of the study, directly facing the doors of the laboratory--the  doors that no longer opened. Dr. Laidlaw, by happy chance, was with him  at the time, and just able to reach his side in response to the sudden  painful efforts for breath; just in time, too, to catch the murmured  words that fell from the pallid lips like a message from the other side  of the grave.    \"Read them, if you must; and, if you can--destroy. But\"--his  voice sank so low that Dr. Laidlaw only just caught the dying  syllables--\"but--never, never--give them to the world.\"    And like a grey bundle of dust loosely gathered up in an old garment the  professor sank back into his chair and expired.    But this was only the death of the body. His spirit had died two years  before.          4      The estate of the dead man was small and uncomplicated, and Dr. Laidlaw,  as sole executor and residuary legatee, had no difficulty in settling  it up. A month after the funeral he was sitting alone in his upstairs  library, the last sad duties completed, and his mind full of poignant  memories and regrets for the loss of a friend he had revered and loved,  and to whom his debt was so incalculably great. The last two years,  indeed, had been for him terrible. To watch the swift decay of the  greatest combination of heart and brain he had ever known, and to  realize he was powerless to help, was a source of profound grief to him  that would remain to the end of his days.    At the same time an insatiable curiosity possessed him. The study of  dementia was, of course, outside his special province as a specialist,  but he knew enough of it to understand how small a matter might be the  actual cause of how great an illusion, and he had been devoured from the  very beginning by a ceaseless and increasing anxiety to know what the  professor had found in the sands of \"Chaldea,\" what these precious  Tablets of the Gods might be, and particularly--for this was the real  cause that had sapped the man's sanity and hope--what the inscription  was that he had believed to have deciphered thereon.    The curious feature of it all to his own mind was, that whereas his  friend had dreamed of finding a message of glorious hope and comfort, he  had apparently found (so far as he had found anything intelligible at  all, and not invented the whole thing in his dementia) that the secret  of the world, and the meaning of life and death, was of so terrible a  nature that it robbed the heart of courage and the soul of hope. What,  then, could be the contents of the little brown parcel the professor had  bequeathed to him with his pregnant dying sentences?    Actually his hand was trembling as he turned to the writing-table and  began slowly to unfasten a small old-fashioned desk on which the small  gilt initials \"M.E.\" stood forth as a melancholy memento. He put the key  into the lock and half turned it. Then, suddenly, he stopped and looked  about him. Was that a sound at the back of the room? It was just as  though someone had laughed and then tried to smother the laugh with a  cough. A slight shiver ran over him as he stood listening.    \"This is absurd,\" he said aloud; \"too absurd for belief--that I should  be so nervous! It's the effect of curiosity unduly prolonged.\" He smiled  a little sadly and his eyes wandered to the blue summer sky and the  plane trees swaying in the wind below his window. \"It's the reaction,\"  he continued. \"The curiosity of two years to be quenched in a single  moment! The nervous tension, of course, must be considerable.\"    He turned back to the brown desk and opened it without further delay.  His hand was firm now, and he took out the paper parcel that lay inside  without a tremor. It was heavy. A moment later there lay on the table  before him a couple of weather-worn plaques of grey stone--they looked  like stone, although they felt like metal--on which he saw markings of  a curious character that might have been the mere tracings of natural  forces through the ages, or, equally well, the half-obliterated  hieroglyphics cut upon their surface in past centuries by the more or  less untutored hand of a common scribe.    He lifted each stone in turn and examined it carefully.

The canes are crushed between large rollers in a mill, and the juice  collected into a large vessel placed to receive it; it is then boiled,  and placed in pans to cool, when it becomes imperfectly crystallized,  in which state we use it. This is called raw or soft sugar: loaf  sugar, or the hard white sugar, is the raw brown sugar, prepared by  refining it till all foreign matter is removed.      Is the Sugar Cane the only vegetable that produces Sugar?    All vegetables contain more or less sugar, but the plant in which it  most abounds is the sugar-cane. In the United States, a large quantity  of sugar is prepared from the sap of the Sugar Maple Tree. The trees  are tapped at the proper season by a cut being made in the bark, and  the juice runs into a vessel placed to receive it; it is then prepared  in the same manner as the juice of the sugar cane.      What is Sugar Candy?    Sugar purified and crystallized.      What is Barley Sugar?    Sugar boiled till it is brittle, and cast on a stone anointed with oil  of sweet almonds, and then formed into twisted sticks.      What is Sago?    A substance prepared from the pith of the Sago Palm, which grows  naturally in various parts of Africa and the Indies. The pith, which  is even eatable in its natural state, is taken from the trunk of the  tree, and thrown into a vessel placed over a horse-hair sieve; water  is then thrown over the mass, and the finer parts of the pith pass  through the sieve; the liquor thus obtained is left to settle. The  clear liquor is then drawn off, and what remains is formed into  grains by being passed through metal dishes, with numerous small  holes; it is next dried by the action of heat, and in this state it is  exported. The Sago Palm also produces sugar.      What is Millet, and in what countries does it grow?    Millet is an esculent grain, originally brought from the Eastern  countries. It is cultivated in many parts of Europe, but most  extensively in Egypt, Syria, China, and Hindostan, whence we are  furnished with it, it being rarely cultivated among us, except as a  curiosity.         _Esculent_, good for food.      For what is Millet used?    It is in great request amongst the Germans for puddings; for which it  is sometimes used amongst us. The Italians make loaves and cakes of  it.      What is Ginger?    The root of a plant cultivated in the East and West Indies, and in  America; it is a native of South-eastern Asia and the adjoining  islands.      Describe its nature and use.    It is a warm aromatic, much used in medicine and cookery. The Indians  eat the root when green as a salad, chopping it small with other  herbs; they also make a candy of it with sugar. The ginger sold in the  shops here is dried, which is done by placing the roots in the heat of  the sun or in ovens, after being dug out of the ground. Quantities not  only of the dried root, but also of the candied sugar, are imported.      What are Nutmegs?    A delicate aromatic fruit or spice, brought from the East Indies. The  nutmeg tree greatly resembles our pear tree, and produces a kind  of nut, which bears the same name as the tree.    [Illustration: GLASS BLOWING AT THE GLASS-WORKS, PITTSBURGH, PA.]      What is the appearance of the Nutmeg?    Its form is round, and its smell agreeable. The nutmeg is inclosed  in four different covers; the first, a thick fleshy coat, (like our  walnut,) which opens of itself when ripe; under this lies a thin  reddish network, of an agreeable smell and aromatic taste, called  mace; this wraps up the shell, which opens as the fruit grows. The  shell is the third cover, which is hard, thin, and blackish; under  this is a greenish film of no use; and in the last you find the  nutmeg, which is the kernel of the fruit.      What are its uses?    The nutmeg is much used in our food, and is of excellent virtue as a  medicine. It also yields an oil of great fragrance.      Is the Mace used as a spice?    Yes, it is separated from the shell of the nutmeg, and dried in the  sun. It is brought over in flakes of a yellow color, smooth and  net-like, as you see it in the shops. Its taste is warm, bitterish,  and rather pungent; its smell, aromatic. It is used both in food and  medicine, as the nutmeg, and also yields an oil.         _Pungent_, of a hot, biting taste.      What is Pimento or Allspice?    The dried unripe berry or fruit of a tree growing in great abundance  in Jamaica, particularly on the northern side of that island, on hilly  spots, near the coast; it is also a native of both Indies. The Pimento  Tree is a West Indian species of Myrtle; it grows to the height of  twenty or thirty feet; the leaves are all of a deep, shining green,  and the blossom consists of numerous branches of small, white,  aromatic flowers, which render its appearance very striking; there is  scarcely in the vegetable world any tree more beautiful than a young  Pimento about the month of July, when it is in full bloom.      When is the time to gather the spice?    About the month of September, not long after the blossoms are fallen,  the berries are gathered by the hand; one laborer on the tree,  employed in gathering the small branches, will give employment to  three below (who are generally women and children) in picking the  berries. They are then spread out thinly, and exposed to the sun at  its rising and setting for some days; when they begin to dry, they are  frequently winnowed, and laid on cloths to preserve them better from  rain and dew; by this management they become wrinkled, and change from  green to a deep reddish brown color. Great quantities are annually  imported.      What are its uses?    It forms a pleasant addition to flavor food; it also yields an  agreeable essential oil, and is accounted the best and mildest of  common spices.         _Essential_, pure; extracted so as to contain all the       virtues of the spice in a very small compass.      Why is it called Allspice?    Because it has been supposed to combine the flavor of cloves, nutmegs,  and cinnamon; the French call it _round clove_, from its round shape,  and the taste being somewhat like that spice.      What is Pepper?    The product of a creeping shrub, growing in several parts of the East  Indies, Asia, and America.      In what manner does Pepper grow, and what part of the shrub is used?    Pepper is the fruit of this shrub, and grows in bunches or clusters,  at first green; as it ripens it becomes reddish, until having been  exposed for some time to the heat of the sun, (or probably gathered  before perfectly ripe,) it becomes black, as in the condition we have  it. There are two sorts, the black and the white.      What is the White Pepper?    The white pepper is merely the black deprived of its outside skin. For  this purpose the finest red berries are selected, and put in baskets  to steep, either in running water, or in pits dug for the purpose,  near the banks of rivers. Sometimes they are only buried in the  ground. In any of these situations, they swell and burst their skins,  from which, when dry, they are carefully separated by rubbing between  the hands, or fanning.      What is Cayenne Pepper?    The dried fruit of a plant called bird pepper, a native of both  Indies. It is more pungent than the other sorts.          CHAPTER VII.    GLASS, MIRRORS, EARTHENWARE, PORCELAIN, NEEDLES, PINS, PAPER,  PRINTING, PARCHMENT, AND VELLUM.      What is Glass?    A transparent, solid, brittle, factitious body, produced by fusing  sand with an alkali. The essential ingredients of glass are silex and  potash, or soda; a few other substances are sometimes added. Silex is  found nearly pure in rock crystal, flint, and other varieties of  quartz; for the manufacture of the better kinds of glass in this  country, it is generally obtained from sand, especially the white sand  of New Jersey.         _Factitious_, made by art, not found in a state of nature.      What is Potash?    The saline matter obtained from the ashes of wood, by causing water to  pass through them; the water imbibes the salt, which is then obtained  from it by evaporation. When purified by calcination, it is termed  pearlash. In countries where there are vast forests, as in America and  Russia, it is manufactured on a very large scale.      What can you say of the origin of Glass?    The period of its invention is quite unknown. Pliny relates that some  merchants, driven by a storm to the coast of Phenicia, near the river  Belus, made a large fire on the sand to dress some food, using as  fuel some of the plant Kali, which grew there in great abundance; an  imperfect glass was thus formed by the melting of the sand and ashes  together. This production was picked up by a Syrian merchant, who,  attracted by its great beauty, examined the cause of its origin, and,  after many attempts, succeeded in its manufacture.      Who was Pliny?    A celebrated Roman naturalist and historian.      At what place was Glass first made?    Some authors mention Sidon in Syria, which became famous for glass and  glass-houses; but others maintain that the first glass-houses noticed  in history were built at Tyre; which, they add, was the only place  where glass was made for many ages. It is certain that the art was  known to the Egyptians.      What is Phenicia?    A sub-division of Syria in Asia.      What is an author?    A person who writes a book.      What is signified by a glass-house?    A building erected for the making and working of glass.      What countries had glass windows first?    Italy, then France and England; they began to be common about the year  1180.      In what year, and where, was the making of glass bottles begun?    In 1557, in London. The first glass plates for mirrors and  coach-windows were made at Lambeth, in 1673.      What is a Mirror?    A body which exhibits the images of objects"]]]
