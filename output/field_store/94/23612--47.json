Calling my interpreter I found out from him that it was a _klepalo_  for calling the people to church. The people there are too poor to  afford a bell, and so in place of that they use a beam of oak hung from  a rope tied about the center, and this beam is struck with a hammer,  first on one side, and then the other. Sometimes an iron _klepalo_  is used as well, and then they strike first the beam and then the iron  bar, so as to vary the monotony of the call. I found that the wooden  _klepalo_ could be heard for a distance of about one and a half  miles over land, and the iron one for over two miles. Now we can easily  make a wooden _klepalo_ for use in this camp, and then if Dutchy,  or any of the rest of us, keep within a mile and a half of camp there  won't be any trouble with the cook.\"    So we built a _klepalo_, getting from Lumberville a stick of  seasoned oak, 1-1/2 inches thick, 6 inches wide and 4 feet long. A hole  was drilled into the stick at the center, and by a rope passed through  this hole the beam was suspended from a branch overhanging the camp.  Jack, the cook, regularly used this crude device to call the hungry  horde to meals.          CHAPTER VII.    SURVEYING.      One of the first things we did after getting fairly settled in our new  quarters was to make a complete survey of Willow Clump Island and its  immediate surroundings. Our surveying instruments were made as follows:      THE SURVEYING INSTRUMENT.    [Illustration: Fig. 71. Baseboard of the Surveying Instrument.]    [Illustration: Fig. 72. Sighting Blocks on the Baseboard.]    Out of a 1-inch board we cut a base 15 inches long and 4 inches wide. In  the center we sawed out a circular opening of about 3 inches diameter  and covered this at the bottom by a circular piece 1 inch thick and 5  inches in diameter, thus forming a socket in which our compass fitted  snugly. A hole 1 inch in diameter was drilled through the center of this  circular piece to receive the pivot pin of a tripod. Across each end of  the baseboard we secured a block 4 inches long, 2 inches wide and 1 inch  thick. A 1-inch sight hole was drilled through each block at its center.  A ring of cardboard, on which Uncle Ed marked with radial lines the 360  degrees of the circle, was placed over the compass socket, with the zero  and 180 degree marks pointing toward the sight blocks. The outer faces  of the end blocks were now wet with mucilage and a hair was stretched  vertically across the center of each sight hole. The hairs were then  adjusted by sighting through the holes and moving the nearer hair  sidewise until it was exactly in line with both the zero and the 180  degree marks on the cardboard. Then a hair was stretched horizontally  across the center of each sight hole. Great care was taken to place the  hairs at exactly the same height above the baseboard. To protect the  hairs after they were adjusted, they were covered with a piece of glass,  which was secured in place by tacks driven into the wood with their  heads projecting over the edges of the glass.      SPIRIT LEVELS.    From one of his pockets Uncle Ed produced two small bottles, the kind  used for holding homeopathic pills. These he filled nearly to the top  with water, corked them and wedged them into grooves cut lengthwise in  the baseboard at opposite sides of the cardboard ring. These grooves  were filled with putty, and to make sure that the bottles were level  with the baseboard the latter was floated on a bit of quiet water and  the bottles were pressed down at one end or the other until the bubble  within rested at the exact center.      THE TRIPOD.    [Illustration: Fig. 73. The Tripod Head.]    [Illustration: Fig. 74. The Tripod Leg.]    [Illustration: Fig. 75. The Surveying Instrument Complete.]    [Illustration: Fig. 76. The Protractor.]    The tripod head was formed of a wooden disk 5 inches in diameter, with a  wooden pin projecting from its center adapted to engage the hole in the  circular piece above referred to. To the bottom of the tripod head were  nailed three blocks 2 inches long and 1 inch square in cross-section.  The tripod legs were made of light strips of wood, 3/8 inch by 1 inch by  5 feet long, which we secured from one of the mills at Lumberville. Each  leg was formed of two of these strips, nailed securely together to  within 20 inches of the top. At the upper ends the strips were spread to  receive the blocks on the tripod head. In this position they were held  by headless wire nails driven into the ends of the blocks and fitting  into holes drilled in the strips. For a plumb line we tacked a cord to  the center of the tripod head, and attached a good-sized sinker to its  lower end. In connection with this plumb line we occasionally used a  protractor consisting of a semicircle of cardboard 5 inches in diameter,  on which the degrees of the circle were marked off with radiating lines,  as illustrated in Fig. 76. By holding the straight edge of this  protractor against the base of the tripod, and noting the number of  degrees between the 90 degree mark and the plumb line, we could tell at  a glance at what angle from the horizontal the instrument was tipped.      SURVEYOR'S CHAIN.    [Illustration: Fig. 77. The Surveyor's Chain.]    [Illustration: Fig. 78. Forming the Links.]    [Illustration: Fig. 79. A Double-Ringed Link.]    We made a surveyor's chain of wire links, each 12 inches long, instead  of 7.92 inches, which is the length of a standard surveyor's link. The  wire we used was No. 16 galvanized iron, which was rather stiff and  difficult to bend. In order to make all the links of exactly the same  size and shape we used a form, around which they were bent. The form  consisted of a 1-inch board in which two 1/2 inch holes were drilled,  just 11-1/2 inches apart, measured from their centers. An oak pin, 1/2  inch in diameter, was driven into each hole and projected about an inch  above the board. Two blocks of oak were secured to the baseboard, just  before each pin, as shown in Fig. 78. This form gave great satisfaction.  A groove was cut in the side of one of the pins to receive the ring of a  completed link, while the wire was passed through this ring and bent  around the peg to form the ring of the new link. After each link was  formed it was carefully measured, and, if too long, was shortened by  flattening the rings endwise, or, if too short, was lengthened by  pinching together the sides of the rings. There were fifty links in our  chain, and every tenth one was formed with a double ring at the end, so  as to distinguish it from the rest (see Fig. 79).      THE SURVEYOR'S ROD.    [Illustration: Fig. 80. Cutting Out a Disk.]    [Illustration: Fig. 81. The Sighting Disk]    [Illustration: Fig. 82 Nut Fastened in Block.]    We completed our outfit by making a surveyor's rod out of a straight  stick of wood about 6 feet long. A target or sighting disk was mounted  on the stick. This disk was 6 inches in diameter, and was sawed out of a  6-inch square board by making straight cuts across the corners and then  smoothing off the edge to a perfect circle with a draw-knife. The  thickness of the disk was only 1/2 inch. At the back of the disk we  fastened a block of wood with a slot cut in it to receive the rod, as  shown in Fig. 81. To hold the disk at different heights on the rod a  small bolt was used. The nut on this bolt was slipped into a hole on the  block at the bottom of the slot and held in place by driving in nails  about it, as illustrated in Fig. 82. The bolt was then passed through  the hole and threaded through the nut, with its inner end bearing  against the rod. The disk could thus be held at any desired position by  tightening up the bolt. A piece of white paper was now pasted over the  disk. The paper was marked off into quarters, and opposite quarters were  painted black so that it would be easy to sight, from a distance, the  exact center of the target.      A SIMPLE METHOD OF SURVEYING.    Of course, none of us had studied trigonometry, but Uncle Ed devised a  very simple method by which we could determine distances quite  accurately without much figuring.    \"If you will tell me the length of one side of a triangle and the angles  it makes with the other two sides,\" said Uncle Ed, \"I'll tell you the  length of the other two sides and the size of the third angle. This is  how I will do it:    [Illustration: Fig. 83. Diagram of Our First Lesson in Surveying.]    \"Say the line is 6 inches long and one angle is 35 degrees, while the  other is 117 degrees. Let us draw a 6-inch straight line. This we will  call our base line. Now we will place the base edge of our protractor on  the base line with its center at the right hand end of the line. At the  37 degree mark we will make a dot on the paper so, and draw a line from  the right hand end of the base line through this dot. Now we will do the  same thing at the opposite end, making a dot at 107 degrees from the  line, and draw a line from the left hand end of the base line through  this dot.    \"If we extend these lines until they intersect, we will have the  required triangle, and can measure the two sides, which will be found to  be about 12 inches and 8 inches long, and the third angle will measure  just 26 degrees. It doesn't make any difference on what scale we draw  the triangle, whether it be miles, yards, feet, inches or fractions of  an inch, the proportions will be the same. If the base line had been 6  half-inches, or 3 inches long, and the same angles were used, the other  two lines would measure 12 half-inches, or six inches, and 8  half-inches, or 4 inches. If the base line were 6 quarter-inches long,  the sides would be 3 inches and 2 inches long.    [Illustration: Fig. 84.

Ah! here she comes, and your little friend, Miss  Craven, with her.\"    Ruth, looking very pretty, with a delicate flush on each cheek, now  entered the room in the company of Cassandra. Kathleen sprang up the  minute she saw Ruth, rushed across the room, and flung one arm with  considerable violence round her neck.    \"You have come,\" she said. \"I have been hunting the place for you. How  dared you go away and hide yourself? Don't you know that you belong to  me? The moment I saw you I knew that you were my affinity. Don't you  know what an affinity means? Well, you are mine. We were twin souls  before birth; now we have met again and we cannot part. I am ever so  happy when I am with you. Don't mind those others; let them stare all  they like. I am going to take you foundation girls up. I have made up  my mind. We will have a rollicking good time--a splendid time. We will  be as naughty as we like, and we will let the others see what we are  made of. It will be war to the knife between the foundation girls and  the good, proper, paying girls. Let the ladies look after themselves. We  of the foundation will lead our own life, and be as happy as the day is  long. Aren't you glad to see me, dear, sweet, pretty Ruth? Don't you  know for yourself that you are my affinity--my chosen friend, my  beloved? Through the ages we have been one, and now we have met in the  flesh.\"    \"I think,\" said Cassandra, at last managing to get herself heard, \"that  you have said enough for the present, Miss O'Hara. Ruth Craven has come  to spend the day with me. I know that you are an Irish girl, and you  must be lonely. I shall be very pleased if you will join Ruth and me in  our walk. We are going for a walk across the common.--We shall be in to  tea, dear mother. Will you have it ready for us not later than five  o'clock? And I am sure you will join me, mother darling, in asking Miss  O'Hara to stay, too.\"    \"But Miss O'Hara doesn't want to join either you or your 'mother  darling,'\" said Kathleen in her rudest tone. \"It is Ruth I want. I have  come here for her. She must return with me at once.\"    \"But I can't. I am ever so sorry, Miss O'Hara.\"    \"You mean that you won't come when I have called for you?\"    \"I am with Miss Weldon at present.\"    \"Be sensible, dear,\" said Mrs. Weldon at that moment. \"You don't quite  understand our manners in this country. However attached we may be to a  person, we don't enter a strange house and snatch that person out of it.  It isn't our way; and I don't think--you will forgive me for saying  it--that your way is as nice as ours. Be persuaded, dear, and join  Cassandra and Ruth, and have a happy time.\"    Kathleen's face had turned crimson. She looked from Mrs. Weldon to  Cassandra, and then she looked at Ruth. Suddenly her eyes brimmed up  with tears.    \"I don't think I can ever change my way,\" she said. \"I am sorry if I am  rude and not understood. Perhaps, after all, I am mistaken, about Ruth;  perhaps she is not my real proper affinity. I am a very unhappy girl. I  wish I could go back to mother and to my dad. I shouldn't be lonely if I  were in the midst of the mountains, and if I could see the streams and  the blue sea. I don't know why Aunt Katie O'Flynn sent me to this horrid  place. I wish I was back in the old country. They don't talk as you talk  in the old country and they don't look as you look. If you put your  heart at the feet of a body in old Ireland, that body doesn't kick it  away. I will go. I don't want your tea. I don't want anything that you  have to offer me. I don't like any of you. I am sorry if you think me  rude, but I can't help myself. Good-bye.\"    \"No, no; stay. Stay and visit with me, and tell me about the old country  and the sea and the mountains,\" said Mrs. Weldon.    But Kathleen shook her head fiercely, and the next moment left the room.    \"Poor, strange little girl,\" thought the good woman. \"I see she is about  to heap unhappiness on herself and others. What is to be done for her?\"    \"I like her,\" said Ruth. \"She is very impulsive, but she is------\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said Cassandra, \"she has a good heart, of course; but I  foresee that she is up to all sorts of mischief. She doesn't understand  our ways. Why did she leave her own country?\"    Ruth was silent. She looked wistful.    \"Come along, Ruthie; we will be late. I have no end of schemes in my  head. I mean to help you. You will win that scholarship.\"    Ruth smiled. Presently she and Cassandra were crossing the common  arm-in-arm. In the interest of their own conversation they forgot  Kathleen.    When that young lady left the house she ran back to the Tennants'.    \"I will write to dad to-night and tell him that I can't stay,\" she  thought. \"Oh, dear, my heart is in my mouth! I shall have a broken heart  if this sort of thing goes on.\"    She entered the house. There sat Mrs. Tennant with a great basket of  stockings before her. The remains of a rough-looking tea were on the  table. The boys had disappeared.    \"Come in, Kathleen,\" called Mrs. Tennant, \"and have your tea. I want  Maria to clear the tea-things away, as I have some cutting out to do; so  be quick, dear.\"    Kathleen entered. The untidy table did not trouble her in the least; she  was accustomed to things of that sort at home. She sat down, helped  herself to a thick slice of bread-and-butter, and ate it, while burning  thoughts filled her mind.    \"Have some tea. You haven't touched any,\" said Mrs. Tennant.    \"I'd rather have cold water, please,\" Kathleen replied.    She went to the sideboard, filled a glass, and drank it off.    \"Mrs. Tennant,\" she said when she had finished, \"what possessed you to  live in England? You had all the world to choose from. Why did you come  to a horrible place like this?\"    \"But I like it,\" said Mrs. Tennant.    \"You don't look as if you did. I never saw such a worn-out poor body.  Are you awfully old?\"    \"You would think me so,\" replied Mrs. Tennant, with a smile; \"but as a  matter of fact I am not forty yet.\"    \"Not forty!\" said Kathleen. \"But forty's an awful age, isn't it? I mean,  you want crutches when you are forty, don't you?\"    \"Not as a rule, my dear. I trust when I am forty I shall not want a  crutch. I shall be forty in two years, and that by some people is  considered young.\"    \"Then I suppose it is mending those horrid stockings that makes you so  old.\"    \"Mending stockings doesn't help to keep you young, certainly.\"    \"Shall I help you? I used to cobble for old nurse when I was at home.\"    \"But I shouldn't like you to cobble these.\"    \"Oh, I can darn, you know.\"    \"Then do, Kathleen. I should take it very kindly if you would. Here is  worsted, and here is a needle. Will you sit by me and tell me about your  home?\"    Kathleen certainly would not have believed her own ears had she been  told an hour ago that she would end her first fit of desperate  naughtiness by darning stockings for the Tennant boys. She did not darn  well; but then, Mrs. Tennant was not particular. She certainly--although  she said she would not--did cobble these stockings to an extraordinary  extent; but her work and the chat with Mrs. Tennant did her good, and  she went upstairs to dress for supper in a happier frame of mind.    \"I will stay here for a little,\" she said finally to Mrs. Tennant,  \"because I think it will help you. You look so terribly tired; and I  don't think you ought to have this horrible work to do. I'd like to do  it for you, but I don't suppose I shall have time. I will stay for a bit  and see what I can make of the foundation girls.\"    \"The foundation girls?\"    \"Oh, yes; don't ask me to explain. There are a hundred of them at the  Great Shirley School, and I am going--No, I can't explain. I will stop  here instead of running away. I meant to run away when my affinity would  have nothing to do with me.\"    \"Really, Kathleen, you are a most extraordinary girl.\"    \"Of course I am,\" said Kathleen. \"Did you ever suppose that I was  anything else? I am very remarkable, and I am very naughty. I always  was, and I always will be. I am up to no end of mischief. I wish you  could have seen me and Rory together at home. Oh, what didn't we do? Do  you know that once we walked across a little bridge of metal which is  put between two of the stables? It is just a narrow iron rod, six feet  in length. If we had either of us fallen we'd have been dashed to pieces  on the cobble-stones forty feet below. Mother saw me when I was half-way  across, and she gave a shriek. It nearly finished me, but I steadied  myself and got across. Oh, it was jolly! I am going to set some of the  foundation girls at that sort of thing. I expect I shall have great fun  with them. It is principally because my affinity won't have anything to  do with me; she is attaching herself to another, and that other is  little better than a monster. Your Alice won't like me; and, to be frank  with you, I don't like her. I like you, because you are poor and  worried and seem old for your age--although your age is a great one--and  because you have to cobble those horrid socks. There! good-bye for the  present. Don't hate me too much; I can't help the way I am made. Oh; I  hear Alice. What a detestable voice she has! Now then, I'm off.\"    Kathleen ran up to her room, and again she locked the door. She heard  Alice's step, and she felt a certain vindictiveness as she turned the  key in the lock. Alice presently took the handle of the door and shook  it.    \"Let me in at once, Kathleen,\" she said. \"I really can't put up with  this sort of thing any longer. I want to get into my room; I want to  tidy myself. I am going to supper to-night with Cassandra Weldon.\"    \"Then you don't get in,\" whispered Kathleen to herself. Aloud she said:    \"I am sorry, darling, but I am specially busy, and I really must have my  share of the room to myself.\"    \"Do open the door, Kathleen,\" now almost pleaded poor Alice. \"If you  want your"]]]
