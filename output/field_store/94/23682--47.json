[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1728"],[0,"The Odyssey of Homer (#8)"],[1," your own heart, even  yours, is indignant, quit ye my halls, and busy yourselves  with other feasts, eating your own substance, and going in  turn from house to house. But if ye deem this a likelier  and a better thing, that one man's goods should perish  without atonement, then waste ye as ye will: and I will  call upon the everlasting gods, if haply Zeus may grant  that acts of recompense be made: so should ye hereafter  perish in the halls without atonement.'    So spake Telemachus, and in answer to his prayer did Zeus,  of the far borne voice, send forth two eagles in flight,  from on high, from the mountain-crest. Awhile they flew as  fleet as the blasts of the wind, side by side, with  straining of their pinions. But when they had now reached  the mid assembly, the place of many voices, there they  wheeled about and flapped their strong wings, and looked  down upon the heads of all, and destruction was in their  gaze. Then tore they with their talons each the other's  cheeks and neck on every side, and so sped to the right  across the dwellings and the city of the people. And the  men marvelled at the birds when they had sight of them, and  pondered in their hearts the things that should come to  pass. Yea and the old man, the lord Halitherses son of  Mastor spake among them, for he excelled his peers in  knowledge of birds, and in uttering words of fate. With  good will he made harangue and spake among them:    'Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, to the word that I  shall say: and mainly to the wooers do I show forth and  tell these things, seeing that a mighty woe is rolling upon  them. For Odysseus shall not long be away from his friends,  nay, even now, it may be, he is near, and sowing the seeds  of death and fate for these men, every one; and he will be  a bane to many another likewise of us who dwell in  clear-seen Ithaca. But long ere that falls out let us  advise us how we may make an end of their mischief; yea,  let them of their own selves make an end, for this is the  better way for them, as will soon be seen. For I prophesy  not as one unproved, but with sure knowledge; verily, I  say, that for him all things now are come to pass, even as  I told him, what time the Argives embarked for Ilios, and  with them went the wise Odysseus. I said that after sore  affliction, with the loss of all his company, unknown to  all, in the twentieth year he should come home. And behold,  all these things now have an end.'    And Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered him, saying: 'Go  now, old man, get thee home and prophesy to thine own  children, lest haply they suffer harm hereafter: but herein  am I a far better prophet than thou. Howbeit there be many  birds that fly to and fro under the sun's rays, but all are  not birds of fate. Now as for Odysseus, he hath perished  far away, as would that thou too with him hadst been cut  off: so wouldst thou not have babbled thus much prophecy,  nor wouldst thou hound on Telemachus that is already  angered, expecting a gift for thy house, if perchance he  may vouchsafe thee aught. But now will I speak out, and my  word shall surely be accomplished. If thou that knowest  much lore from of old, shalt beguile with words a younger  man, and rouse him to indignation, first it shall be a  great grief to him:--and yet he can count on no aid from  these who hear him;--while upon thee, old man, we will lay  a fine, that thou mayest pay it and chafe at heart, and  sore pain shall be thine. And I myself will give a word of  counsel to Telemachus in presence of you all. Let him  command his mother to return to her father's house; and her  kinsfolk will furnish a wedding feast, and array the gifts  of wooing, exceeding many, all that should go back with a  daughter dearly beloved. For ere that, I trow, we sons of  the Achaeans will not cease from our rough wooing, since,  come what may, we fear not any man, no, not Telemachus,  full of words though he be, nor soothsaying do we heed,  whereof thou, old man, pratest idly, and art hated yet the  more. His substance too shall be woefully devoured, nor  shall recompense ever be made, so long as she shall put off  the Achaeans in the matter of her marriage; while we in  expectation, from day to day, vie one with another for the  prize of her perfection, nor go we after other women whom  it were meet that we should each one wed.'    Then wise Telemachus answered him saying: 'Eurymachus, and  ye others, that are lordly wooers, I entreat you no more  concerning this nor speak thereof, for the gods have  knowledge of it now and all the Achaeans. But come, give me  a swift ship and twenty men, who shall accomplish for me my  voyage to and fro. For I will go to Sparta and to sandy  Pylos to inquire concerning the return of my father that is  long afar, if perchance any man shall tell me aught, or if  I may hear the voice from Zeus, that chiefly brings tidings  to men. If I shall hear news of the life and the returning  of my father, then verily I may endure the wasting for yet  a year; but if I shall hear that he is dead and gone, let  me then return to my own dear country, and pile his mound,  and over it pay burial rites full many as is due, and I  will give my mother to a husband.'    So with that word he sat him down; then in the midst uprose  Mentor, the companion of noble Odysseus. He it was to whom  Odysseus, as he departed in the fleet, had given the charge  over all his house, that it should obey the old man, and  that he should keep all things safe. With good will he now  made harangue and spake among them:    'Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, to the word that I  shall say. Henceforth let not any sceptred king be kind and  gentle with all his heart, nor minded to do righteously,  but let him alway be a hard man and work unrighteousness:  for behold, there is none that remembereth divine Odysseus  of the people whose lord he was, and was gentle as a  father. Howsoever, it is not that I grudge the lordly  wooers their deeds of violence in the evil devices of their  heart. For at the hazard of their own heads they violently  devour the household of Odysseus, and say of him that he  will come no more again. But I am indeed wroth with the  rest of the people, to see how ye all sit thus speechless,  and do not cry shame upon the wooers, and put them down, ye  that are so many and they so few.'    And Leocritus, son of Euenor, answered him, saying: 'Mentor  infatuate, with thy wandering wits, what word hast thou  spoken, that callest upon them to put us down? Nay, it is a  hard thing to fight about a feast, and that with men who  are even more in number than you. Though Odysseus of Ithaca  himself should come and were eager of heart to drive forth  from the hall the lordly wooers that feast throughout his  house, yet should his wife have no joy of his coming,  though she yearns for him;--but even there should he meet  foul doom, if he fought with those that outnumbered him; so  thou hast not spoken aright. But as for the people, come  now, scatter yourselves each one to his own lands, but  Mentor and Halitherses will speed this man's voyage, for  they are friends of his house from of old. Yet after all,  methinks, that long time he will abide and seek tidings in  Ithaca, and never accomplish this voyage.'    Thus he spake, and in haste they broke up the assembly. So  they were scattered each one to his own dwelling, while the  wooers departed to the house of divine Odysseus.    Then Telemachus, going far apart to the shore of the sea,  laved his hands in the grey sea water, and prayed unto  Athene, saying: 'Hear me, thou who yesterday didst come in  thy godhead to our house, and badest me go in a ship across  the misty seas, to seek tidings of the return of my father  that is long gone: but all this my purpose do the Achaeans  delay, and mainly the wooers in the naughtiness of their  pride.'    So spake he in prayer, and Athene drew nigh him in the  likeness of Mentor, in fashion and in voice, and she spake  and hailed him in winged words:    'Telemachus, even hereafter thou shalt not be craven or  witless, if indeed thou hast a drop of thy father's blood  and a portion of his spirit; such an one was he to fulfil  both word and work. Nor, if this be so, shall thy voyage be  vain or unfulfilled. But if thou art not the very seed of  him and of Penelope, then have I no hope that thou wilt  accomplish thy desire. For few children, truly, are like  their father; lo, the more part are worse, yet a few are  better than the sire. But since thou shalt not even  hereafter be craven or witless, nor hath the wisdom of  Odysseus failed thee quite, so is there good hope of thine  accomplishing this work. Wherefore now take no heed of the  counsel or the purpose of the senseless wooers, for they  are in no way wise or just: neither know they aught of  death and of black fate, which already is close upon them,  that they are all to perish in one day. But the voyage on  which thy heart is set shall not long be lacking to  thee--so faithful a friend of thy father am I, who will  furnish thee a swift ship and myself be thy companion. But  go thou to the house, and consort with the wooers, and make  ready corn, and bestow all in vessels, the wine in jars and  barley-flour, the marrow of men, in well-sewn skins; and I  will lightly gather in the township a crew that offer  themselves willingly. There are many ships, new and old, in  seagirt Ithaca; of these I will choose out the best for  thee, and we will quickly rig her and launch her on the  broad deep.'    So spake Athene, daughter of Zeus, and Telemachus made no  long tarrying, when he had heard the voice of the goddess.  He went on his way towards the house, heavy at heart, and  there he found the noble wooers in the halls, flaying goats  and singeing swine in the court. And Antinous laughed out  and went straight to Telemachus, and clasped his hand and  spake and hailed him:    'Telemachus,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17280"],[0,"Anthropology (#8)"],[1,"olk, for instance, the  good flint--so rich in colour as it is, and so responsive to the hammer,  at any rate if you get down to the lower layers or \"sases,\" for instance,  the floorstone, or the black smooth-stone that is generally below  water-level--has served the needs of all the palaeolithic periods,  and of the neolithic age as well, and likewise of the modern Englishmen  who fought with flintlocks at Waterloo, or still more recently took  out tinder-boxes with them to the war in South Africa. And what does  this stand for in terms of the antiquity of man? Thousands of years?  We do not know exactly; but say rather hundreds of thousands of years.          CHAPTER III  RACE      There is a story about the British sailor who was asked to state what  he understood by a Dago. \"Dagoes,\" he replied, \"is anything wot isn't  our sort of chaps.\" In exactly the same way would an ancient Greek  have explained what he meant by a \"barbarian.\" When it takes this  wholesale form we speak, not without reason, of race-prejudice. We  may well wonder in the meantime how far this prejudice answers to  something real. Race would certainly seem to be a fact that stares  one in the face.    Stroll down any London street: you cannot go wrong about that Hindu  student with features rather like ours but of a darker shade. The short  dapper man with eyes a little aslant is no less unmistakably a Japanese.  It takes but a slightly more practised eye to pick out the German waiter,  the French chauffeur, and the Italian vendor of ices. Lastly, when  you have made yourself really good at the game, you will be scarcely  more likely to confuse a small dark Welshman with a broad florid  Yorkshireman than a retriever with a mastiff.    Yes, but remember that you are judging by the gross impression, not  by the element of race or breed as distinguished from the rest. Here,  you say, come a couple of our American cousins. Perhaps it is their  speech that betrayeth them; or perhaps it is the general cut of their  jib. If you were to go into their actual pedigrees, you would find  that the one had a Scotch father and a mother from out of Dorset; whilst  the other was partly Scandinavian and partly Spanish with a tincture  of Jew. Yet to all intents and purposes they form one type. And, the  more deeply you go into it, the more mixed we all of us turn out to  be, when breed, and breed alone, is the subject of inquiry. Yet race,  in the only sense that the word has for an anthropologist, means  inherited breed, and nothing more or less--inherited breed, and all  that it covers, whether bodily or mental features.    For race, let it not be forgotten, presumably extends to mind as well  as to body. It is not merely skin-deep. Contrast the stoical Red Indian  with the vivacious Negro; or the phlegmatic Dutchman with the  passionate Italian. True, you say, but what about the influence of  their various climates, or again of their different ideals of  behaviour? Quite so. It is immensely difficult to separate the effects  of the various factors. Yet surely the race-factor counts for something  in the mental constitution. Any breeder of horses will tell you that  neither the climate of Newmarket, nor careful training, nor any  quantity of oats, nor anything else, will put racing mettle into  cart-horse stock.    In what follows, then, I shall try to show just what the problem about  the race-factor is, even if I have to trespass a little way into general  biology in order to do so.[2] And I shall not attempt to conceal the  difficulties relating to the race-problem. I know that the ordinary  reader is supposed to prefer that all the thinking should be done  beforehand, and merely the results submitted to him. But I cannot  believe that he would find it edifying to look at half-a-dozen books  upon the races of mankind, and find half-a-dozen accounts of their  relationships, having scarcely a single statement in common. Far  better face the fact that race still baffles us almost completely.  Yet, breed is there; and, in its own time and in its own way, breed  will out.    [Footnote 2: The reader is advised to consult also the more  comprehensive study on _Evolution_ by Professors Geddes and Thomson  in this series.]    Race or breed was a moment ago described as a factor in human nature.  But to break up human nature into factors is something that we can  do, or try to do, in thought only. In practice we can never succeed  in doing anything of the kind. A machine such as a watch we can take  to bits and then put together again. Even a chemical compound such  as water we can resolve into oxygen and hydrogen and then reproduce  out of its elements. But to dissect a living thing is to kill it once  and for all. Life, as was said in the first chapter, is something unique,  with the unique property of being able to evolve. As life evolves,  that is to say changes, by being handed on from certain forms to certain  other forms, a partial rigidity marks the process together with a  partial plasticity. There is a stiffening, so to speak, that keeps  the life-force up to a point true to its old direction; though, short  of that limit, it is free to take a new line of its own. Race, then,  stands for the stiffening in the evolutionary process. Just up to what  point it goes in any given case we probably can never quite tell. Yet,  if we could think our way anywhere near to that point in regard to  man, I doubt not that we should eventually succeed in forging a fresh  instrument for controlling the destinies of our species, an instrument  perhaps more powerful than education itself--I mean, eugenics, the  art of improving the human breed.    To see what race means when considered apart, let us first of all take  your individual self, and ask how you would proceed to separate your  inherited nature from the nature which you have acquired in the course  of living your life. It is not easy. Suppose, however, that you had  a twin brother born, if indeed that were possible, as like you as one  pea is like another. An accident in childhood, however, has caused  him to lose a leg. So he becomes a clerk, living a sedentary life in  an office. You, on the other hand, with your two lusty legs to help  you, become a postman, always on the run. Well, the two of you are  now very different men in looks and habits. He is pale and you are  brown. You play football and he sits at home reading. Nevertheless,  any friend who knows you both intimately will discover fifty little  things that bespeak in you the same underlying nature and bent. You  are both, for instance, slightly colour-blind, and both inclined to  fly into violent passions on occasion. That is your common inheritance  peeping out--if, at least, your friend has really managed to make  allowance for your common bringing-up, which might mainly account for  the passionateness, though hardly for the colour-blindness.    But now comes the great difficulty. Let us further suppose that you  two twins marry wives who are also twins born as like as two peas;  and each pair of you has a family. Which of the two batches of children  will tend on the whole to have the stronger legs? Your legs are strong  by use; your brother's are weak by disuse. But do use and disuse make  any difference to the race? That is the theoretical question which,  above all others, complicates and hampers our present-day attempts  to understand heredity.    In technical language, this is the problem of use-inheritance,  otherwise known as the inheritance of acquired characters. It is apt  to seem obvious to the plain man that the effects of use and disuse  are transmitted to offspring. So, too, thought Lamarck, who half a  century before Darwin propounded a theory of the origin of species  that was equally evolutionary in its way. Why does the giraffe have  so long a neck? Lamarck thought it was because the giraffe had acquired  a habit of stretching his neck out. Every time there was a bad season,  the giraffes must all stretch up as high as ever they could towards  the leafy tops of the trees; and the one that stretched up farthest  survived, and handed on the capacity for a like feat to his fortunate  descendants. Now Darwin himself was ready to allow that use and disuse  might have some influence on the offspring's inheritance; but he  thought that this influence was small as compared with the influence  of what, for want of a better term, he called spontaneous variation.  Certain of his followers, however, who call themselves Neo-Darwinians,  are ready to go one better. Led by the German biologist, Weismann,  they would thrust the Lamarckians, with their hypothesis of  use-inheritance, clean out of the field. Spontaneous variation, they  assert, is all that is needed to prepare the way for the selection  of the tall giraffe. It happened to be born that way. In other words,  its parents had it in them to breed it so. This is not a theory that  tells one anything positive. It is merely a caution to look away from  use and disuse to another explanation of variation that is not yet  forthcoming.    After all, the plain man must remember that the effects of use and  disuse, which he seems to see everywhere about him, are mixed up with  plenty of apparent instances to the contrary. He will smile, perhaps,  when I tell him that Weismann cut off the tails of endless mice, and,  breeding them together, found that tails invariably decorated the race  as before. I remember hearing Mr. Bernard Shaw comment on this  experiment. He was defending the Lamarckianism of Samuel Butler, who  declared that our heredity was a kind of race-memory, a lapsed  intelligence. \"Why,\" said Mr. Shaw, \"did the mice continue to grow  tails? Because they never wanted to have them cut off.\" But men-folk  are wont to shave off their beards because they want to have them off;  and, amongst people more conservative in their habits than ourselves,  such a custom may persist through"]]]
