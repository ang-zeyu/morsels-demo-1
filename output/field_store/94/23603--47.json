After he had rested, Lane boarded a street car and rode out to the  suburbs of Middleville where the Maynards lived. Although they had  lost their money they still lived in the substantial mansion that was  all which was left them of prosperous days. House and grounds now  appeared sadly run down.    A maid answered Lane's ring, and let him in. Lane found himself rather  nervously expecting to see Mrs. Maynard. The old house brought back to  him the fact that he had never liked her. But he wanted to see  Margaret. It turned out, however, that mother and daughter were out.    \"Come up, old top,\" called Blair's voice from the hall above.    So Lane went up to Blair's room, which he remembered almost as well as  his own, though now it was in disorder. Blair was in his shirt  sleeves. He looked both gay and spent. Red Payson was in bed, and his  face bore the hectic flush of fever.    \"Aw, he's only had too much to eat,\" declared Blair, in answer to  Lane's solicitation.    \"How's that, Red?\" asked Lane, sitting down on the bed beside Payson.    \"It's nothing, Dare.... I'm just all in,\" replied Red, with a weary  smile.    \"I telephoned Doc Bronson to come out,\" said Blair, \"and look us over.  That made Red as sore as a pup. Isn't he the limit? By thunder, you  can't do anything for some people.\"    Blair's tone and words of apparent vexation were at variance with the  kindness of his eyes as they rested upon his sick comrade.    \"I just came from Bronson's,\" observed Lane. \"He's been our doctor for  as long as I can remember.\"    Both Lane's comrades searched his face with questioning eyes, and  while Lane returned that gaze there was a little constrained silence.    \"Bronson examined me--and said I'd live to be eighty,\" added Lane,  with dry humor.    \"You're a liar!\" burst out Blair.    On Red Payson's worn face a faint smile appeared. \"Carry on, Dare.\"    Then Blair fell to questioning Lane as to all the news he had heard,  and people he had met.    \"So Manton turned you down cold,\" said Blair, ponderingly.    \"I didn't get to see him,\" replied Lane. \"He sent out word that my old  job was held by a girl who did my work better and at less pay.\"    The blood leaped to Blair's white cheek.    \"What'd you say?\" he queried.    \"Nothing much. I just trailed out.... But the truth is, Blair--I  couldn't have stood that place--not for a day.\"    \"I get you,\" rejoined Blair. \"That isn't the point, though. I always  wondered if we'd find our old jobs open to us. Of course, I couldn't  fill mine now. It was an outside job--lots of walking.\"    So the conversation see-sawed back and forth, with Red Payson  listening in languid interest.    \"Have you seen any of the girls?\" asked Blair.    \"I met Mel Iden,\" replied Lane.    \"You did? What did she--\"    \"Mel told me what explained some of your hints.\"    \"Ahuh! Poor Mel! How'd she look?\"    \"Greatly changed,\" replied Lane, thoughtfully. \"How do you remember  Mel?\"    \"Well, she was pretty--soulful face--wonderful smile--that sort of  thing.\"    \"She's beautiful now, and sad.\"    \"I shouldn't wonder. And she told you right out about the baby?\"    \"No. That came out when she said I couldn't call on her, and I wanted  to know why.\"    \"But you'll go anyhow?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"So will I,\" returned Blair, with spirit. \"Dare, I've known for over a  year about Mel's disgrace. You used to like her, and I hated to tell  you. If it had been Helen I'd have told you in a minute. But Mel....  Well, I suppose we must expect queer things. I got a jolt this  morning. I was pumping my sister Margie about everybody, and, of  course, Mel's name came up. You remember Margie and Mel were as thick  as two peas in a pod. Looks like Mel's fall has hurt Margie. But I  don't just _get_ Margie yet. She might be another fellow's sister--for  all the strangeness of her.\"    \"I hardly knew _my_ kid sister,\" responded Lane.    \"Ahuh! The plot thickens.... Well, I couldn't get much out of Marg.  She used to babble everything. But what little she told me made up  in--in shock for what it lacked in volume.\"    \"Tell me,\" said Lane, as his friend paused.    \"Nothing doing.\" ... And turning to the sick boy on the bed, he  remarked, \"Red, you needn't let this--this gab of ours bother you.  This is home talk between a couple of boobs who're burying their  illusions in the grave. You didn't leave a sister or a lot of old  schoolgirl sweethearts behind to----\"    \"What the hell do you know about whom I left behind?\" retorted Red,  with a swift blaze of strange passion.    \"Oh, say, Red--I--I beg your pardon, I was only kidding,\" responded  Blair, in surprise and contrition. \"You never told me a word about  yourself.\"    For answer Red Payson rolled over wearily and turned his back.    \"Blair, I'll beat it, and let Red go to sleep,\" said Lane, taking up  his hat. \"Red, good-bye this time. I hope you'll be better soon.\"    \"I'm--sorry, Lane,\" came in muffled tones from Payson.    \"Cut that out, boy. You've nothing to be sorry for. Forget it and  cheer up.\"    Blair hobbled downstairs after Lane. \"Don't go just yet, Dare.\"    They found seats in the parlor that appeared to be the same shabby  genteel place where Lane had used to call upon Blair's sister.    \"What ails Red?\" queried Lane, bluntly.    \"Lord only knows. He's a queer duck. Once in a while he lets out a  crack like that. There's a lot to Red.\"    \"Blair, his heart is broken,\" said Lane, tragically.    \"Well!\" exclaimed Blair, with quick almost haughty uplift of head. He  seemed to resent Lane's surprise and intimation. It was a rebuke that  made Lane shrink.    \"I never thought of Red's being hurt--you know--or as having lost....  Oh, he just seemed like so many other boys ruined in health. I----\"    \"All right. Cut the sentiment,\" interrupted Blair. \"The fact is Red is  more of a problem than we had any idea he'd be.... And Dare, listen to  this--I'm ashamed to have to tell you. Mother raised old Harry with me  this morning for fetching Red home. She couldn't see it my way. She  said there were hospitals for sick soldiers who hadn't homes. I lost  my temper and I said: 'The hell of it, mother, is that there's nothing  of the kind.' ... She said we couldn't keep him here. I tried to coax  her.... Margie helped, but nothing doing.\"    Blair had spoken hurriedly with again a stain of red in his white  cheek, and a break in his voice.    \"That's--tough,\" replied Lane, haltingly. He could choke back speech,  but not the something in his voice he would rather not have heard.  \"I'll tell you what. As soon as Red is well enough we'll move him over  to my house. I'm sure mother will let him share my room. There's only  Lorna--and I'll pay Red's board.... You have quite a family--\"    \"Hell, Dare--don't apologize to me for my mother,\" burst out Blair,  bitterly.    \"Blair, I believe you realize what we are up against--and I don't,\"  rejoined Lane, with level gaze upon his friend.    \"Dare, can't you see we're up against worse than the Argonne?--worse,  because back here at home--that beautiful, glorious  thought--idea--spirit we had is gone. Dead!\"    \"No, I can't see,\" returned Lane, stubbornly.    \"Well, I guess that's one reason we all loved you, Dare--you couldn't  see.... But I'll bet you my crutch Helen makes you see. Her father  made a pile out of the war. She's a war-rich snob now. And going the  pace!\"    \"Blair, she may make me see her faithlessness--and perhaps some  strange unrest--some change that's seemed to come over everything. But  she can't prove to me the death of anything outside of herself. She  can't prove that any more than Mel Iden's confession proved her a  wanton. It didn't. Not to me. Why, when Mel put her hand on my  breast--on this medal--and looked at me--I had such a thrill as I  never had before in all my life. Never!... Blair, it's _not_ dead.  That beautiful thing you mentioned--that spirit--that fire which  burned so gloriously--it is _not_ dead.\"    \"Not in you--old pard,\" replied Blair, unsteadily. \"I'm always ashamed  before your faith. And, by God, I'll say you're my only anchor.\"    \"Blair, let's play the game out to the end,\" said Lane.    \"I get you, Dare.... For Margie, for Lorna, for Mel--even if they  have--\"    \"Yes,\" answered Lane, as Blair faltered.          CHAPTER IV      As Lane sped out Elm Street in a taxicab he remembered that his last  ride in such a conveyance had been with Helen when he took her home  from a party. She was then about seventeen years old. And that night  she had coaxed him to marry her before he left to go to war. Had her  feminine instinct been infallibly right? Would marrying her have saved  her from what Blair had so forcibly suggested?    Elm Street was a newly developed part of Middleville, high on one of  its hills, and manifestly a restricted section. Lane had found the  number of Helen's home in the telephone book. When the chauffeur  stopped before a new and imposing pile of red brick, Lane understood  an acquaintance's reference to the war rich. It was a mansion, but  somehow not a home. It flaunted something indefinable.    Lane instructed the driver to wait a few moments, and, if he did not  come out, to go back to town and return in about an hour. The house  stood rather far from the street, and as Lane mounted the terrace he  observed four motor cars parked in the driveway. Also his sensitive  ears caught the sound of a phonograph.    A maid answered his ring. Lane asked for both Mrs. Wrapp and Helen.  They were at home, the maid informed him, and ushered Lane into a gray  and silver reception room. Lane had no card, but gave his name. As he  gazed around the room he tried to fit the delicate decorative scheme  to Mrs. Wrapp. He smiled at the idea. But he remembered that she had  always liked him in spite of the fact that she did not favor his"]]]
