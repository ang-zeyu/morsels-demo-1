We're most of us ready for it.\"    \"Look here!\" suggested Ingred. \"Let's settle it this way. Have tea  first, then the election, and then some fun afterwards. Don't you think  that would sandwich things best?\"    \"True, O Queen! I don't mind what happens afterwards, so long as I get a  bun quick!\"    \"Let's fetch the prog,\" agreed Linda Slater, leading the way towards the  cloak-room where the baskets had been stored.    The giggling procession met emissaries from other forms, bent on a like  errand, and exchanged a brisk banter as they passed on the stairs.    \"We've got jam tartlets!\"    \"Not as nice as our cheese cakes!\"    \"Nellie's brought a whole pound of macaroons!\"    \"Oh! will you swap with us for rock buns?\"    \"I should just think not!\"    \"Dolly Arden has five oranges!\"    \"Well, we've got bananas!\"    After successfully fetching the provisions, having routed a marauding  band of juniors who were poking inquisitive fingers into the baskets,  the members of VA. returned to the form-room, closed the door, and gave  themselves up to festivity. The four girls from the hostel need have had  no fear of scarcity, for the others had brought ample to compensate for  their deficiency. By general consent all the cakes were pooled, set out  on hard-backed exercise books in lieu of plates, and handed round the  company. Bess, whose basket contained two thermos flasks, a dozen cheese  cakes, and some meringues, was felt to have brought a valuable  contribution. It seemed a new experience to be sitting at their desks,  drinking tea and eating cakes, instead of doing translation or writing  exercises.    \"Pity the Snark didn't stop! She doesn't know what she's missing!\"  remarked Joanna Powers, as she took a meringue.    \"Oh, Kafoozalum! We shouldn't have had much fun if the Snark had stayed!  Don't bring her back, for goodness' sake, Jo!\"    \"I wasn't going to! Besides which, she's probably half-way down town at  present, having tea in a cafe. She generally does on Fridays.\"    \"She won't get a better tea than we're having!\"    \"I'll undertake she won't! This meringue is absolutely topping! I wonder  if there's another left.\"    \"No, they're gone, every one of them!\"    \"Hard luck!\"    Though the hour might be early, the girls' appetites were quite equal to  the task of finishing the various delicacies in the way of sweet stuff  which they had brought with them. Cakes disappeared like snow in summer,  and chocolate boxes, passed round impartially, soon returned empty to  their owners. When everything seemed almost finished, Bess produced  another hamper, which she had carried up from the cloak-room, and stowed  away under her desk. She handed it rather shyly to Beatrice, who  happened to be her nearest neighbor.    \"Mother sent these, and wants you all to share them,\" she remarked.    Beatrice, Francie, and Linda opened the hamper all three together, then  with a delighted \"O-Oh!\" of satisfaction drew out six beautiful bunches  of purple grapes. Ingred, finishing her cup of tea, choked and coughed.  She knew those grapes well. They grew in the vinery at Rotherwood, and  had been the pride of her father and of the head-gardener. She had not  tasted one of them for five years, for during the war they had always  been given to the patients in the Red Cross Hospital, but she could not  forget their delicious flavor. Why had her father let the vinery with  the house? The grapes ought to be hers to give away--not this girl's.  Nobody else in the room cared in the least where the fruit came from, so  long as it was there. Appreciative eyes looked on in glad anticipation  while Beatrice and Francie divided the bunches with as much mathematical  accuracy as they could muster at the moment. A portion was laid upon  each desk, and the girls fell to.    \"Delicious!\"    \"Never tasted better in my life!\"    \"Absolutely topping!\"    \"Makes one want to go and live in a vineyard!\"    \"They're exactly ripe!\"    \"Ingred, you're not eating yours!\"    \"I don't want them, thanks,\" said Ingred hurriedly. \"I don't indeed.  I've had enough. Pass them on to somebody else, please!\"    \"Well, if you really don't want them, they won't go a-begging, I dare  say!\"    Ingred felt as if the grapes would choke her. She could not touch one of  them. She hated Bess for having brought them to school, quite  irrespective of the fact that she would have done exactly the same in  her place, had she been fortunate enough to have the opportunity. Bess,  looking shy, and anxious to evade the thanks that poured in upon her,  bundled the hamper away under the desk again, and made a palpable effort  to change the subject.    \"What about this election?\" she asked. \"Time's getting on. It's after  half-past four.\"    \"Good night! Have we been all that time feeding? Here, girls, if you've  _quite_ finished, let's get to business,\" said Avis, rapping on her desk  as a signal for silence, and constituting herself spokeswoman for the  occasion. \"You know what we've met here for--to choose a warden to  represent us on the School Council. Well, I feel we couldn't do better  than send up Ingred Saxon. She'd look after our interests all right, if  anybody would. I beg to propose Ingred Saxon.\"    \"And I beg to second that!\" called Nora.    \"Hands up, those in favor!\"    Such a forest of arms immediately waved in the air that (though in  strict order) it seemed hardly necessary for Avis to call out:    \"Those against!\"    No opposition hands appeared, so without further discussion the election  was carried.    \"Congrats, Ingred!\" said Nora, patting the heroine on the back.    \"I told you it would be a walk over, old sport!\" whispered Verity.    \"We'd talked it over beforehand, you see, and everybody had agreed to  choose you, so it was really only a matter of form,\" explained Francie.    \"The Sixth are having a ballot,\" put in Jess.    \"And VB. are going to fight like Kilkenny cats over Magsie and Barbara.\"    \"There'll be some hullabaloo in several of the forms, I expect.\"    \"Thanks awfully for electing me,\" replied Ingred. \"I suppose I ought to  make a speech, but I really don't know what to say!\"    \"You've got to say it all the same!\" laughed Verity. \"Members of  Parliament always make speeches to their constituents. Here, take the  Snark's desk as your thingumgig--rostrum, or whatever it's called, and  begin your jaw-wag!\"    \"Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears!\" squeaked Kitty  Saunders.    Pushed forward by a dozen hands, Ingred found herself occupying the  mistress's place, and, facing her audience, made a valiant attempt at  oratory. With cheeks aglow, and dark eyes shining like stars, she looked  an attractive little figure, and a bright and suitable leader for the  form.    \"I can't really think why you should have chosen me,\" she began (\"don't  be too modest!\" yelled a voice from the back), \"but as you _have_ made  me your warden, I'll take care that all our grievances are very well  aired at the School Council.\" (\"You'll have your work cut out!\"  interrupted Francie.) \"Of course I know it won't all be plain sailing,  and that the Sixth need a great deal of sticking up to over many  matters.\" (\"That's so!\" came from the front desk.) \"But perhaps they'll  be prepared to talk things over now, and make some concessions.\" (\"Time  they did!\") \"At any rate, I shall be able to tell them what you all  think\" (\"Flattering for them!\"), \"and to make things as smooth as  possible for VA. Now, as I'm warden, may I propose that we have  some fun before we go? Shall we have music, or games? Hands up for an  Emergency Concert!\"    \"A very neat way of getting out of further speechifying!\" said Verity,  as by general consent the concert carried the day; \"but you shall open  it yourself, Madam Warden, so I warn you! You're not going to be let  off, don't you think it! Silence! Ladies and gentlemen, the first item  on the program will be a piano solo by Miss Ingred Saxon, the celebrated  musical star, brought over at enormous expense, on purpose for this  occasion.\"    \"You blighter!\" murmured Ingred, as the prospective audience shouted  \"Hear! Hear!\"    \"Not a bit of it!\" purred Verity. \"I guess we'll take sparks out of the  Sixth and everybody else.\"    VA. that afternoon was certainly in a position to boast itself.  It was the only form in possession of a piano: for by the sheerest  accident it had one. The instrument was only a temporary visitor, placed  there for convenience while some repairs were being done to a leaking  gas-pipe in one of the music rooms. It's an ill wind, however, that  blows nobody good, and it gave VA. an opportunity that was denied even  to the Sixth. Ingred was at once escorted to the piano, and officious  hands piled exercise books on a chair to make her seat high enough.    \"I can't remember anything! I can't indeed!\" she protested vigorously.    \"Now don't twitter nonsense!\" said Nora. \"I've heard you play  dozens--yes, _dozens_!--of things without music at the hostel, so you've  just got to try!\"    \"I shall break down, I know I shall!\"    \"Then you can begin again at the beginning. Fire away, and don't be  affected!\" commanded Nora.    It is one thing to play a piece from memory when you have the room to  yourself, and quite another to play it with half a dozen girls hanging  over the piano, and the rest of the audience sitting on their desks.  Ingred wisely did not venture on anything too classical, but tried a  bright \"Spanish Ballade,\" and managed to get successfully to the end of  it without any breakdown. In the midst of the clapping that followed  came a loud rap-tap-tap at the door, which immediately opened to  admit--much to the astonishment of the Fifth--two of the prefects, and a  consignment of Sixth form girls.    \"Whatever have we been and gone and done now?\" murmured Verity.    \"Is music taboo?\" asked Ingred guiltily, slipping away from the piano.    The errand of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18525"],[0,"On the Trail: An Outdoor Book for Girls (#8)"],[1," they stand firm as a rule.    You can cover the frame with bark and then thatch it, which will render  the shelter better able to withstand a storm, or you may omit the bark,  using only the thatch as a covering. Put on very thick, this should make  the lean-to rain-proof.    With small tips of branches from trees, preferably balsam, hemlock, or  other evergreens, begin thatching your shelter. Commence at the bottom  of the lean-to, and hook on the thatch branches close together all the  way across the lowest cross pole, using the stumps of these thatch  branches as hooks to hold the thatch in place on the cross pole (Fig.  19). Overlap the lower thatches as you work along the next higher cross  pole, like shingles on a house, and continue in this way, overlapping  each succeeding cross pole with an upper row of thatch until the top is  reached. Fill in the sides thick with branches, boughs, or even small,  thick trees.    The lean-to frame can be covered with your poncho in case of necessity,  but boughs are much better.      =Permanent Camp. Lean-To. Open Camp=    Another kind of lean-to intended for a permanent camp is in general use  throughout the Adirondacks. It is built of substantial good-sized logs  put together log-cabin fashion, with open front, slanting roof, and low  back (Fig. 20). This shelter has usually a board floor raised a few  inches above the ground and covered thick, at least a foot deep, with  balsam. Overspread with blankets, the soft floor forms a comfortable  bed. A log across the front of the floor keeps the balsam in place and  forms a seat for the campers in the evenings when gathered for a social  time before the fire. The roof of the log lean-to can be either of  boards or well-thatched poles which have first been overlaid with bark.    [Illustration: 23 24    22    Dining-tent, handy racks, and log bedstead.]    One of the most comfortable and delightful of real forest camps which I  have ever been in, was a permanent camp in the Adirondacks owned and run  by one of the best of Adirondack guides. The camp consisted of several  shelters and two big permanent fireplaces.    Over the ground space for the large tent outlined with logs was a strong  substantial rustic frame, built of material at hand in the forest and  intended to last many seasons (Fig. 21). The shelter boasted of two  springy, woodsy beds, made of slender logs laid crosswise and raised  some inches from the ground. These slender logs slanted down slightly  from head to foot of the bed, and the edges of the bed were built high  enough to hold the deep thick filling of balsam tips, so generously deep  as to do away with all consciousness of the underlying slender-log  foundation (Fig. 22). Each bed was wide enough for two girls and the  shelter ample to accommodate comfortably four campers. There could have  been one more bed, when the tent would have sheltered six girls.    In the late fall, the guide removed the water-proof tent covering and  kept it in a safe, dry place until needed, leaving the beds and bare  tent frame standing.    There was a smaller tent and also a lean-to in this camp.    [Illustration: A forest camp by the water.]    The dining-table, contrived of logs and boards, was sheltered by a  square of canvas on a rustic frame (Fig. 23). The camp dishes of white  enamel ware were kept in a wooden box, nailed to a close-by tree; in  this box the guide had put shelves, resting them on wooden cleats. The  cupboard had a door that shut tight and fastened securely to keep out  the little wild creatures of the woods. Pots, kettles, frying-pan, etc.,  hung on the stubs of a slender tree where branches and top had been  lopped off (Fig. 24). The sealed foods were stowed away in a box  cupboard, and canned goods were cached in a cave-like spot under a huge  rock, with opening secured by stones.    The walls of the substantial fireplace, fully two feet high, were of big  stones, the centre filled in part-way with earth, and the cook-fire was  made on top of the earth, so there was not the slightest danger of the  fire spreading.    The soft, warm, cheerful-colored camp blankets when not in use were  stored carefully under cover of a water-proof tent-like storehouse, with  the canvas sides dropped from the ridge-pole, both sides and flaps  securely fastened and the entire storehouse made proof against  intrusion.    This camp was located near a lake in the mountain forest and its charm  was indescribably delightful.      =Tents=    Tents in almost endless variety of shapes and sizes are manufactured and  sold by camp-outfitters and sporting-goods shops. The tents range from  small canoe-tents, accommodating one person only, to the large  wall-tents for four or more people. When using tents, difficulties of  transportation and extra weight can be overcome by having tent poles and  pegs cut in the forest.    If you purchase tents, full instructions for erection go with them.  Write for illustrated catalogues to various outfitters and look the  books over carefully before buying. Your choice will depend upon your  party, length of stay, and location of camp.    You may be able to secure a discarded army-tent that has never been  used, is in good condition, and has been condemned merely for some  unimportant blemish. Such tents are very serviceable and can be  purchased at Government auctions, or from dealers who themselves have  bought them from the Government.    [Illustration: In camp.]    A large square seven by seven feet, or more, of balloon silk,  water-proof cloth, or even heavy unbleached sheeting, will be found most  useful in camp. Sew strong tape strings at the four corners and at  intervals along the sides for tying to shelters, etc. The water-proof  cloth will serve as a drop-curtain in front of the lean-to during a hard  storm, or as carpet cloth over ground of shelter, also as an extra  shelter, either lean-to or tent style; any of the three materials can do  duty as windbreak, fly to shelter, or dining canopy, and may be used in  other ways.      =Camp-Beds=    To derive joy and strength from your outing it is of serious importance  that you sleep well every night while at camp, and your camp-bed must be  comfortable to insure a good night's rest.    A bough-bed is one of the joys of the forest when it is _well made_, and  to put it together properly will require about half an hour's time, but  the delight of sleeping on a soft balsam bed perfumed with the pungent  odors of the balsam will well repay for the time expended.      [Illustration: 25 26    The bough-bed, the cook-fire, and the wall-tent.]      =Bough-Bed=    Tips of balsam broken off with your fingers about fourteen inches long  make the best of beds, but hemlock, spruce, and other evergreens can be  used; if they are not obtainable, the fan-like branches from other trees  may take their place. Of these you will need a large quantity, in  order to have the bed springy and soft. Always place the outdoor bed  with the head well under cover and foot toward the opening of shelter,  or if without shelter, toward the fire. Make the bed by arranging the  branches shingle-like in _very_ thick overlapping rows, convex side up,  directly on the ground with _thick end_ of stems _toward_ the _foot_.  Push these ends into the ground so that the tips will be raised  slantingly up from the earth; make the rows which will come under the  hips extra thick and springy. Continue placing the layers in this manner  until the space for single or double bed, as the case may be, is covered  with the first layer of your green mattress. Over it make another layer  of branches, reversing the ends of these tips from those underneath by  pushing the _thick ends_ of branches of this top layer slantingly into  the under layer _toward_ the _head_ of the bed with tips toward the  foot. Make more layers, until the bed is about two feet thick (Fig. 25);  then cover the mattress thus made with your poncho, rubber side down,  and on top spread one of the sleeping blankets, using the other one as a  cover. Be sure to allow plenty of time for this work and have the bed  dry and soft.      =Bag-Bed=    When the camp is located where there is no material for a bough-bed,  each girl can carry with her a bag three feet wide and six and one-half  feet long, made of strong cloth, ticking, soft khaki, or like material,  to be filled with leaves, grass, or other browse found on or near the  camp-grounds. Such a mattress made up with poncho and blankets is very  satisfactory, but it must be well filled, so that when you lie on the  mattress it will not mash flat and hard.      =Cot-Bed=    For an entire summer camp army cots which fold for packing are good and  very comfortable with a doubled, thick quilt placed on top for a  mattress.    The sporting-goods stores show a great variety of other beds, cots, and  sleeping-bags, and a line to them will bring illustrated catalogues, or,  if in the city, you can call and see the goods.    Any of the beds I have described, however, can be used to advantage, and  I heartily endorse the _well-made_ bough-bed, especially if of balsam.      =Pillows=    Make a bag one-half yard square of brown linen or cotton cloth, and when  you reach camp, gather the best browse you can find for filling, but be  careful about having the pillow too full; keep it soft and comfortable.  If there is no browse, use clean underwear in its place. Fasten the open  end of the bag together with large-sized patent dress snappers.    One of the pleasantest phases of a season's camping are the little side  trips for overnight. You hit the trail that leads to the chosen spot  located some two or three, perhaps six or seven, miles distant; a place  absolutely dry, where you can enjoy the fun of sleeping on the ground  without shelter, having merely the starry sky for a canopy. Each girl  can select the spot where she is to sleep and free it from all twigs,  stones, etc.,"]]]
