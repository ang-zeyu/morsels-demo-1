Anthony, on the Charge of (#8)"],[1,"\" in a republican  government, we shall find that the leading feature of citizenship is the  enjoyment of the right of suffrage.    The definition of the term \"citizen\" by _Bouvier_ is: \"One who under the  constitution and laws of the United States, has a right to vote for  Representatives in Congress, and other public officers, and who is  qualified to fill offices in the gift of the people.\"    By _Worcester_--\"An inhabitant of a republic who enjoys the rights of a  freeman, and has a right to vote for public officers.\"    By _Webster_--\"In the United States, a person, native or naturalized,  who has the privilege of exercising the elective franchise, or the  qualifications which enable him to vote for rulers, and to purchase and  hold real estate.\"    The meaning of the word \"citizen\" is directly and plainly recognized by  the latest amendment of the constitution (the fifteenth.)    \"_The right of the citizens of the United States to vote_ shall not be  denied or abridged by the United States, or by any State, on account of  race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" This clause assumes  that the right of citizens, _as such_, to vote, is an existing right.    Mr. Richard Grant White, in his late work on Words and their Uses, says  of the word citizen: \"A citizen is a person who has certain political  rights, and the word is properly used only to imply or suggest the  possession of these rights.\"    Mr. Justice Washington, in the case of _Corfield vs. Coryell (4 Wash,  C.C. Rep. 380)_, speaking of the \"privileges and immunities\" of the  citizen, as mentioned in Sec. 2, Art. 4, of the constitution, after  enumerating the personal rights mentioned above, and some others, as  embraced by those terms, says, \"to which may be added the elective  franchise, as regulated and established by the laws or constitution of  the State in which it is to be exercised.\" At that time the States had  entire control of the subject, and could abridge this privilege of the  citizen at its pleasure; but the judge recognizes the \"elective  franchise\" as among the \"privileges and immunities\" secured, to a  qualified extent, to the citizens of every State by the provisions of  the constitution last referred to. When, therefore, the States were, by  the fourteenth amendment, absolutely prohibited from abridging the  privileges of the citizen, either by enforcing existing laws, or by the  making of new laws, the right of every \"citizen\" to the full exercise of  this privilege, as against State action, was absolutely secured.    Chancellor Kent and Judge Story both refer to the opinion of Mr. Justice  Washington, above quoted, with approbation.    The Supreme Court of Kentucky, in the case of _Amy, a woman of color,  vs. Smith (1 Littell's Rep. 326)_, discussed with great ability the  questions as to what constituted citizenship, and what were the  \"privileges and immunities of citizens\" which were secured by Sec. 2,  Art. 4, of the constitution, and they showed, by an unanswerable  argument, that the term \"citizens,\" as there used, was confined to those  who were entitled to the enjoyment of the elective franchise, and that  that was among the highest of the \"privileges and immunities\" secured  to the citizen by that section. The court say that, \"to be a citizen it  is necessary that he should be entitled to the enjoyment of these  privileges and immunities, upon the same terms upon which they are  conferred upon other citizens; and unless he is so entitled, _he cannot,  in the proper sense of the term, be a citizen_.\"    In the case of _Scott vs. Sanford (19 How. 404)_, Chief Justice Taney  says: \"The words 'people of the United States,' and 'citizens,' are  synonymous terms, and mean the same thing; they describe the _political  body, who, according to our republican institutions, form the  sovereignty and hold the power, and conduct the government through their  representatives_. They are what we familiarly call the sovereign people,  and every citizen is one of this people, and a constituent member of  this sovereignty.\"    Mr. Justice Daniel, in the same case, (p. 476), says: \"Upon the  principles of etymology alone, the term citizen, as derived from  _civitas_, conveys the idea of connection or identification with the  state or government, and a participation in its functions. But beyond  this, there is not, it is believed, to be found in the theories of  writers on government, or in any actual experiment heretofore tried, an  exposition of the term citizen, which has not been understood as  conferring the actual possession and enjoyment, or the perfect right of  acquisition and enjoyment of _an entire equality of privileges, civil  and political_.\"    Similar references might be made to an indefinite extent, but enough has  been said to show that the term citizen, in the language of Mr. Justice  Daniel, conveys the idea \"of identification with the state or  government, and a participation in its functions.\"    Beyond question, therefore, the first section of the fourteenth  amendment, by placing the citizenship of women upon a par with that of  men, and declaring that the \"privileges and immunities\" of the citizen  shall not be abridged, has secured to women, equally with men, the right  of suffrage, unless that conclusion is overthrown by some other  provision of the constitution.    It is not necessary for the purposes of this argument to claim that this  amendment prohibits a state from making or enforcing any law whatever,  regulating the elective franchise, or prescribing the conditions upon  which it may be exercised. But we do claim that in every republic the  right of suffrage, in some form and to some extent, is not only one of  the privileges of its citizens, but is the first, most obvious and most  important of all the privileges they enjoy; that in this respect _all  citizens are equal_, and that the effect of this amendment is, to  prohibit the States from enforcing any law which denies this right to  any of its citizens, or which imposes any restrictions upon it, which  are inconsistent with a republican form of government. Within this  limit, it is unnecessary for us to deny that the States may still  regulate and control the exercise of the right.    The only provisions of the constitution, which it can be contended  conflict with the construction which has here been put upon the first  section of the fourteenth amendment, are the fifteenth amendment, and  the second section of the fourteenth.    In regard to the fifteenth amendment, I shall only say, that if my  interpretation of the fourteenth amendment is correct, there was still  an object to be accomplished and which was accomplished by the  fifteenth. The prohibition of any action abridging the privileges and  immunities of citizens, contained in the fourteenth amendment, applies  only to the States, and leaves the United States government free to  abridge the political privileges and immunities of citizens of the  United States, as such, at its pleasure. By the fifteenth amendment both  the United States and the State governments, are prohibited from  exercising this power, \"on account of race, color, or previous  condition of servitude\" of the citizen.    The first remark to be made upon the second section of the fourteenth  amendment is, that it does not give and was not designed to give to the  States any power to deny or abridge the right of any citizen to exercise  the elective franchise. So far as it touches that subject, it was  designed to be restrictive upon the States. It gives to them no power  whatever. It takes away no power, but it gives none, and if the States  possess the power to deny or abridge the right of citizens to vote, it  must be derived from some other provision of the constitution. I believe  none such can be found, which was not necessarily abrogated by the first  section of this amendment.    It may be conceded that the persons who prepared this section supposed,  that, by other parts of the constitution, or in some other way, the  States would still be authorized, notwithstanding the provisions of the  first section, to deny to the citizens the privilege of voting, as  mentioned in the second section; but their mistake cannot be held to add  to, or to take from the other provisions of the constitution. It is very  clear that they did not intend, by this section, _to give_ to the States  any such power, but, believing that the States possessed it, they  designed to hold the prospect of a reduction of their representation in  Congress _in terrorem_ over them to prevent them from exercising it.  They seem not to have been able to emancipate themselves from the  influence of the original constitution which conceded this power to the  States, or to have realized the fact that the first section of the  amendment, when adopted, would wholly deprive the States of that power.    But those who prepare constitutions are never those who adopt them, and  consequently the views of those who frame them have little or no bearing  upon their interpretation. The question for consideration here is, what  the people, who, through their representatives in the legislatures,  adopted the amendments, understood, or must be presumed to have  understood, from their language. They must be presumed to have known  that the \"privileges and immunities\" of citizens which were secured to  them by the first section beyond the power of abridgment by the States,  gave them the right to exercise the elective franchise, and they  certainly cannot be presumed to have understood that the second section,  which was also _designed to be restrictive_ upon the States, would be  held to confer by implication a power upon them, which the first section  in the most express terms prohibited.    It has been, and may be again asserted, that the position which I have  taken in regard to the second section is inadmissible, because it  renders the section nugatory. That"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18284"],[0,"For Every Music Lover (#8)"],[1," all  combine for one purpose, and lead persistently to one grand climax, from  which they may return to the repose whence they came. Unity in diversity  is the goal he sets before himself. All aglow though he is with the joy  of artistic production, he dare not permit his mind to waver from the  task in hand.    Music is not to be played with, and the labor of composition is no  trifling matter. It demands the keenest mental activity, the most  profound mental concentration. It demands consecration. The composer  thinks and works in tones, in an ideal realm, far removed from the  realities of the external world. His business is to bring his theme to  its most magnificent unfolding, treating it with absolute definiteness,  that his intention may be perfectly clear.    It is the business of the interpreter of music to be so thoroughly  acquainted with the elements of which music is composed that he can  promptly recognize the color, complexion and individual character of  every interval, chord and chord-combination, every consonance and  dissonance, every timbre and nuance, and every degree of phrasing and  rhythm. He must have so complete a mastery of his materials and working  forces that his imagination may be influenced unimpeded by the  emanations from the composer's imagination which animate the moving  forms he commands.    It is his business to respond with his whole being to the appeal of the  musical masterpiece he attempts to interpret, and so express the  emotions aroused by it from their slumbers in his own bosom that a  responsive echo may be found in the bosoms of the listeners. A most  ingeniously constructed music-box, with the presentation of a  complicated piece of music, may fail to move a heart that will be  stirred to its depths by a simple song, into which the singer's whole  soul has been thrown.    Though the mind of the inventive genius be a mystery that may not fully  be explained, its product is within the grasp of the intelligent seeker.  The aesthetic principles of musical construction rest on certain  elementary laws governing both the human organism and the phenomena of  sound, and may become familiar to any one who is capable of study. In  the same way the established canons of musical expression, observed by  the skilful artist, consciously or unconsciously, are traceable to  natural causes. Without realizing the inherent properties of music, as  well as its technical possibilities and limitations, we cannot know the  art.    The tonal language is one that is not translatable into words. It is  composed of an infinite variety of tone-forms, now sharply contrasted,  now gradually blending into one another, all logically connected, all  tending to form a perfect whole. The profusion of harmonic, melodic,  dynamic and rhythmic changes it brings forth invests it with a meaning  far beyond that of words, a musical meaning. Every masterpiece of music  clothes in tonal form some idea which originated in the composer's mind.  To the interpreter it is given to invest it with living sound.    Chords and chord combinations all have their individual characteristics.  Some cause satisfaction, for instance, others unrest. When a chord of  the dominant seventh is heard, the educated musician knows that a  solution is demanded. The unspoiled ear and taste instinctively feel  something unfinished, and are disturbed if it be not followed by a  return to the key chord. Where the faculties are dormant or petrified,  its significance will be unobserved.    The story is told of a young lady whose musical education had been  utterly hollow and false, but who, having been overwhelmed with flattery  for her voice and her singing, was deluded into a belief that she was  destined to shine as a star on the operatic stage. She consulted the  famous basso, Karl Formes, who good-naturedly had her sing for him. He  perceived at once that she possessed neither striking talent nor  adequate training.    As a supreme test he struck on the piano a chord of the dominant  seventh, and asked the young aspirant for dramatic glory what she  thought it meant. Presuming it to be incumbent upon a prospective prima  donna to have uppermost in her mind the grand passion, she replied, in a  sentimental tone, \"Love!\" Promptly Karl Formes sounded the solution to  the chord. \"There is your answer,\" quoth he. \"I ask a question, and it  is thought I speak of love. Go home, my good girl, and seek some other  avocation. You have a fair voice, but you are tone-deaf. You can never  make a musician.\"    A favorite motto of the piano teacher Leschetitzky is, \"Think ten times  before you play once.\" If this rule were more generally observed we  should have better interpreters of music. A great composition should  completely occupy mind and heart before it is attacked by fingers or  voice. In that case it would be analyzed as to its form, its tonal  structure, its harmonic relations, its phrasing and rhythms, and its  musical intention would become luminous. The interpreter would  understand where accents and other indications of expression should  occur and why they should so occur, and would be able, in however feeble  a way, to find and reveal the true heart music that lies hidden in the  notes.    It is never too early in a course of music study to consider the  requirements of musical expression. Persistent observance of them will  inevitably quicken the artistic sense. The rules to which they have  given rise are for the most part simple and easily explained. For  obvious reasons, all musical interpretation is expected to imitate song  as closely as possible. The human voice, the primitive musical  instrument, in moments of excitement, ascends to a higher pitch,  increasing in intensity of tone as it sweeps upward. Consequently every  progression from lower to higher tones, whether played or sung, demands  a crescendo unless some plainly denoted characteristic of the music  calls for different treatment. A descending passage, as a return to  tranquillity, requires a decrescendo.    \"The outpouring of a feeling toward its object, whether to the endless  heavens, or forth into the boundless world, or toward a definite,  limited goal, resembles the surging, the pressing onward of a flood,\"  said the great teacher, Dr. Adolph Kullak. \"Reversely, that feeling  which draws its object into itself has a more tranquillizing movement,  that especially when the possession of the object is assured, appeases  itself in equable onward flow toward the goal of a normal state of  satisfaction. The emotional life is an undulating play of up-surging and  subsidence, of pressing forward beyond temporal limitations and of  resigned yielding to temporal necessities. The crescendo and decrescendo  are the means employed in music for the portrayal of this manifestation  of emotional life.\"    Another important matter which may to a great extent be reduced to rule  is that of accentuation. Through it a tone-picture is invested with  animation, and a clue is given to the disposition of tonal forms.  Accents are always required to mark the entrance of a theme, a phrase or  a melody. Where there are several voices, or parts, as in a fugue, each  voice denotes its appearance with an accent. Every daring assertion  hazarded in music, as in speech, demands special emphasis. Dissonances  need to be brought out in such prominence that they may not appear to be  accidental misconceptions, and that confident expectation may be aroused  of their ultimate resolution. Accentuation must be regulated by the  claims of musical delivery. At all times too gentle an accent is without  effect, too glaring an accent is to be condemned.    Hans von Buelow strenuously advised young musicians to cultivate their  ears and strive to attain musical beauty in what is termed phrasing,  which he regarded as the real beginning of greatness in a performer.  Phrasing and time keeping are two of the prime essentials in musical  delivery, and cannot be neglected with impunity.    Time may well be called the pulse of music. Upon some occasions the  pulse beats more rapidly than others. It is incumbent on the interpreter  of music to ascertain the harmonic and other causes which determine the  tempo of a musical composition, as well as those which make slight  variations from it admissible. Among other points to be noted is the  fact that sudden transition from repose to restless activity calls for  an accelerando, while the reverse requires a rallentando.    It is absolutely imperative for one who would interpret music to  cultivate the memory. The musician who cannot play or sing without notes  is compelled to expend a large amount of mental activity on reading  these, and will find it difficult to heed the manifold requirements of  musical expression and delivery, of which a few hints have here been  given. A musical composition is never thoroughly understood until it has  been intelligently memorized. One who can play or sing without notes is  as free as a bird to soar aloft in the blue ether of musical  imagination.    [Illustration: FRANZ LISZT]    Every interpreter of music longs for appreciative listeners, and young  musicians, in especial, often lament the lack of these. It is well to  remember that the genuine musical artist is able to create an atmosphere  whose influences may compel an average audience to sympathetic  listening. A good plan for the artist is to be surrounded in fancy with  an audience having sensitively attuned ears, intellectual minds, and  warm, throbbing hearts. Music played in private before such an imaginary  audience will gain in quality, and when repeated before an actual public  will hold that public captive.    We have it from Ruskin that all fatal faults in art that might otherwise  be good arise from one or other of three things: either from the  pretence to feel what we do not; the indolence in exercise necessary to  obtain the power of expressing"]]]
