He might have caught him, too,  only the monkey picked up a cocoanut pie off the ground and hit the bear  so hard on the head, that the savage creature was frightened, and ran  away, sneezing, leaving the monkey and the rabbit alone by the show-tent.    \"Now, we'll get ready to have some fun,\" said the monkey, and what he and  Uncle Wiggily did I'll tell you in the following story which will be about  the old gentleman rabbit and the boys--that is, if the molasses jug  doesn't tip over on my plate, and spoil my bread and butter peanut  sandwich.          STORY XI    UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BOYS      \"Well,\" said the monkey after the bear had run away. \"I guess we can now  sit down and talk quietly together; eh, Uncle Wiggily?\"    \"Yes,\" said the old gentleman rabbit. \"But what is it that you want me to  do? I heard you sing that funny little song, about the boys coming in the  tent. But I don't exactly understand.\"    \"That's just it,\" replied the monkey. \"You see, it's this way. I have a  little sort of a circus-show here, and the troublesome boys don't want to  pay any money to get in. So when my back is turned they crawl under the  tent, and so they see the show for nothing--just like at the circus.\"    \"Oh, so that's how it is?\" asked Uncle Wiggily. \"And you want me to keep  out the boys?\"    \"That's it,\" said the monkey. \"Here's a big stick, with which to tickle  the boys who crawl in under the tent without paying. Now I'll practice my  tricks.\"    So the monkey did a lot of tricks. He stood on his head, and he hung by  his tail, and he danced around in a circle. Then he pounded the drum, not  so hard as to hurt it, but hard enough to make a noise, and he played the  fiddle and blew on the horn, and then he ran inside the tent and jumped  over a bench, making believe it was an elephant, and he did all sorts of  funny tricks like that. He even stood on his head, and made a funny face.    \"That will make a very nice show,\" said Uncle Wiggily after he had watched  the monkey. \"Now I'll stay outside, and keep the boys from coming in  unless they pay their money. And you can be inside, doing the tricks.\"    \"And I'll give you money for working for me,\" said the monkey. \"Then  perhaps you can make your fortune, and, besides that, I'll give you a  cocoanut, and you can make a cocoanut pie with it.\"    \"That will be fine!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. So he and the monkey practiced  to get ready for their show. It was a nice little tent in which it was to  be given, and there were seats for the people, who would come, and a  platform, and flying rings and trapeze bars and paper hoops, and all  things like that, just the same as in a real circus. Well, finally the  time came for the show. It was the day after Uncle Wiggily got to the  place where the tent was, and he had slept that night in a hammock, put  up between two trees.    \"Now we're almost ready for the show,\" said the monkey to the old  gentleman rabbit, after a bit, \"so I hope you will be sure to keep out the  troublesome boys. They always creep under the tent, and see the show for  nothing. I can't have that going on if I'm to make any money.\"    \"Oh, I'll stop 'em!\" declared Uncle Wiggily.    \"And here's the club to do it with,\" said the monkey, handing Uncle  Wiggily a stick.    \"Oh, I don't know about that,\" answered the rabbit. \"I never hurt boys if  I can help it. Perhaps I shan't need the club. I'll leave it here.\"    So Uncle Wiggily hid the club under an apple tree, but the monkey said it  would be needed, and he wanted Uncle Wiggily to keep it, and take a whip,  too. But the old rabbit shook his head.    \"I'll try being kind to the boys,\" he said. \"You let me have my way, Mr.  Monkey.\"    Well, pretty soon, not so very long, the show began. The monkey went  inside the tent, and he blew on the horn, and he made music on the fiddle,  and sang a funny song about a little great big pussy, who had a red  balloon. She stuck a pin inside it, and it played a go-bang! tune.    Of course, as soon as the show started the people came crowding up to the  tent, just as they do at the circus. There were men and women, and little  boys and girls, and big boys and girls, and they all wanted to get inside  to see what the monkey was doing. But, do you know, I believe all that he  was doing was playing monkey-doodle tricks--but, of course, I might be  mistaken.    Well, as it always happens, some boys didn't have any money with which to  pay their way inside the tent. And, of course, as it will sometimes  happen, one boy said to another:    \"Hey! I know a way we can crawl in under the tent, and see the show, and  not have anything to pay.\"    \"But that wouldn't be fair,\" spoke the other boy. \"It would be cheating,  and there's nothing meaner in this world than to cheat, whether it's  playing a baseball game or going to a circus.\"    \"I guess you're right,\" said the first boy. \"What shall we do, though? I  want to see the show.\"    \"Well, we must be fair, anyhow,\" spoke the second boy. \"We can't crawl in  under the tent, but perhaps if we ask the monkey to let us in for nothing  he'll do it.\"    \"Very well, we will,\" said the first boy. So they went up to the monkey  and asked if they could go in for nothing, but, of course, he wouldn't let  them.    \"May we crawl in under the tent, then?\" asked the second boy.    \"If Uncle Wiggily will let you,\" answered the monkey, blinking his two  eyes and wrapping his tail around his neck.    So those boys tried to crawl in under the tent, and as soon as Uncle  Wiggily saw them he rushed up and cried out:    \"Hey! Hold on there! Nobody must go under the tent. You must buy a  ticket,\" and he shook a feather at the boys and, instead of hitting them,  he only tickled them, and didn't hurt them a bit, for they sneezed.    Well, those boys were very troublesome. They kept on trying to crawl under  the tent, and Uncle Wiggily rushed here, there and around the corner  trying to stop them, and he cracked the lash on his whip, just like the  man in the circus ring. But those boys kept on trying to crawl under the  tent, for the monkey had given them permission, you see.    So finally Uncle Wiggily said:    \"I'll give those boys a little show myself, outside the tent, for nothing.  Then maybe they'll stop bothering me.\"    So he stood on his left ear, and then on his right ear, and then he jumped  through a hoop, and rolled over, and barked liked a dog, and all the boys  that had tried to crawl under the tent to see the monkey-show for nothing,  ran out to see Uncle Wiggily's show.    And he did lots of tricks and kept them all from crawling in under the  tent, and he even ate a popcorn ball, standing on his hind legs, and  wiggling his left ear with a pin-wheel on it. Then, after a while, the  monkey-show was all over, and the monkey said:    \"Uncle Wiggily, you did very well. You treated those troublesome boys just  fine! So I'll give you ten pennies, and perhaps they will make you have a  good fortune.\"    Then the monkey gave Uncle Wiggily ten pennies, and he went to sleep in a  feather bed, while the old gentleman rabbit went down to the drug store to  get an ice cream soda.    And what happened after the show was over, and what Uncle Wiggily did  after he had his ice cream, I'll tell you in the next story which will be  about Uncle Wiggily in a balloon. That is, if our pussy cat doesn't get  all covered with red paint, and look like a tomato growing on a strawberry  vine. So watch out, and don't let that happen.          STORY XII    UNCLE WIGGILY IN A BALLOON      Well, just as I expected, something happened to my pussy-cat named Peter.  He didn't fall into the pot of red paint, but he either ran away, or else  some one took him. So now I have no pussy-cat. But I'll tell you a story  about Uncle Wiggily just the same.    The old gentleman rabbit stayed with the monkey for several days, and he  was so kind and good to the troublesome boys--Uncle Wiggily was, I  mean--and he did such funny tricks for them, that they didn't crawl under  the tent any more, and the monkey could do his tricks in peace and  quietness.    \"Oh, you have been a great help to me,\" said the monkey to the rabbit,  \"and I would like you to work for me all Summer. I am now going to travel  on to the next town, and if you like you may go with me and keep the boys  there from crawling under the tent.\"    \"No, I thank you,\" replied Uncle Wiggily slowly, as he put some bread and  butter, and a piece of pie, into his satchel. \"I think I will travel  farther on by myself, and seek my fortune.\"    \"Well, I'm sorry to see you go,\" said the monkey. \"And here is fifty cents  for your work. I hope you have good luck.\"    And then Uncle Wiggily started off again, over the fields and through the  woods, seeking his fortune, while the monkey got ready to move his show to  the next town.    Well, for some time nothing happened to the old gentleman rabbit. He  walked on and on, and once he saw a little red ant, trying to drag a piece  of cake home for dinner. The cake was so big that the ant was having a  dreadful time with it, but Uncle Wiggily took his left ear, and just  brushed that cake into the ant's house as easily as anything.    \"My, how strong and brave you are,\" cried the little red ant. \"Won't you  let me get you a glass of water?\"    \"I would like it,\" said the rabbit, \"for it is quite warm to-day.\"    Well, that ant got Uncle Wiggily a glass of water, but you know how it  is--an ant's glass is so very small that it only holds as much water as  you could put on the point of a pin, and really, I'm not exaggerating a  bit, when I say that Uncle Wiggily drank seventeen thousand four hundred  and twenty-six and a half ant-glasses of water before he had enough. It  took all the ants for a mile around to bring the water to him, but they  didn't "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15293"],[0,"Influences of Geographic Environment (#8)"],[1,"of  prairie land or rise to the eminence of Boston police sergeant. The  Scotch immigrants in America who fought in the Civil War were nearly two  inches taller than the average in the home country.[24] But the ocean  barrier culled superior qualities of mind and character  also--independence of political and religious conviction, and the  courage of those convictions, whether found in royalist or Puritan,  Huguenot or English Catholic.    [Sidenote: Indirect effect through isolation.]    Such colonists in a remote country were necessarily few and could not be  readily reinforced from home. Their new and isolated geographical  environment favored variation. Heredity passed on the characteristics of  a small, highly selected group. The race was kept pure from intermixture  with the aborigines of the country, owing to the social and cultural  abyss which separated them, and to the steady withdrawal of the natives  before the advance of the whites. The homogeneity of island peoples  seems to indicate that individual variations are in time communicated by  heredity to a whole population under conditions of isolation; and in  this way modifications due to artificial selection and a changed  environment become widely spread.    Nor is this all. The modified type soon becomes established, because the  abundance of land at the disposal of the colonists and the consequent  better conditions of living encourage a rapid increase of population. A  second geographic factor of mere area here begins to operate. Ease in  gaining subsistence, the greater independence of the individual and the  family, emancipation from carking care, the hopeful attitude of mind  engendered by the consciousness of an almost unlimited opportunity and  capacity for expansion, the expectation of large returns upon labor,  and, finally, the profound influence of this hopefulness upon the  national character, all combined, produce a social rejuvenation of the  race. New conditions present new problems which call for prompt and  original solution, make a demand upon the ingenuity and resourcefulness  of the individual, and therefore work to the same end as his previous  removal from the paralyzing effect of custom in the old home country.  Activity is youth and sluggishness or paralysis is age. Hence the  energy, initiative, adaptability, and receptivity to new ideas--all  youthful qualities--which characterize the Anglo-Saxon American as well  as the English Africander, can be traced back to the stimulating  influences, not of a bracing or variable climate, but of the abundant  opportunities offered by a great, rich, unexploited country. Variation  under new natural conditions, when safe-guarded by isolation, tends to  produce modification of the colonial type; this is the direct effect of  a changed environment. But the new economic and social activities of a  transplanted people become the vehicle of a mass of indirect geographic  influences which contribute to the differentiation of the national  character.    [Sidenote: General importance of indirect effects.]    The tendency to overlook such links between conspicuous effects and  their remote, less evident geographic causes has been common in  geographic investigation. This direct rather than indirect approach to  the heart of the problem has led to false inferences or to the  assumption that reliable conclusions were impossible. Environment  influences the higher, mental life of a people chiefly through the  medium of their economic and social life; hence its ultimate effects  should be traced through the latter back to the underlying cause. But  rarely has this been done. Even so astute a geographer as Strabo, though  he recognizes the influence of geographic isolation in differentiating  dialects and customs in Greece,[25] ascribes some national  characteristics to the nature of the country, especially to its climate,  and the others to education and institutions. He thinks that the nature  of their respective lands had nothing to do with making the Athenians  cultured, the Spartans and Thebans ignorant; that the predilection for  natural science in Babylonia and Egypt was not a result of environment  but of the institutions and education of those countries.[26] But here  arise the questions, how far custom and education in their turn depend  upon environment; to what degree natural conditions, molding economic  and political development, may through them fundamentally affect social  customs, education, culture, and the dominant intellectual aptitudes of  a people. It is not difficult to see, back of the astronomy and  mathematics and hydraulics of Egypt, the far off sweep of the rain-laden  monsoons against the mountains of Abyssinia and the creeping of the  tawny Nile flood over that river-born oasis.    [Sidenote: Indirect political and moral effects.]    Plutarch states in his \"Solon\" that after the rebellion of Kylon in 612  B.C. the Athenian people were divided into as many political factions as  there were physical types of country in Attica. The mountaineers, who  were the poorest party, wanted something like a democracy; the people of  the plains, comprising the greatest number of rich families, were  clamorous for an oligarchy; the coast population of the south,  intermediate both in social position and wealth, wanted something  between the two. The same three-fold division appeared again in 564 B.C.  on the usurpation of Peisistratus.[27] Here the connection between  geographic condition and political opinion is clear enough, though the  links are agriculture and commerce. New England's opposition to the War  of 1812, culminating in the threat of secession of the Hartford  Convention, can be traced back through the active maritime trade to the  broken coastline and unproductive soil of that glaciated country.    In all democratic or representative forms of government permitting free  expression of popular opinion, history shows that division into  political parties tends to follow geographical lines of cleavage. In our  own Civil War the dividing line between North and South did not always  run east and west. The mountain area of the Southern Appalachians  supported the Union and drove a wedge of disaffection into the heart of  the South. Mountainous West Virginia was politically opposed to the  tidewater plains of old Virginia, because slave labor did not pay on the  barren \"upright\" farms of the Cumberland Plateau; whereas, it was  remunerative on the wide fertile plantations of the coastal lowland. The  ethics of the question were obscured where conditions of soil and  topography made the institution profitable. In the mountains, as also in  New England, a law of diminishing financial returns had for its  corollary a law of increasing moral insight. In this case, geographic  conditions worked through the medium of direct economic effects to more  important political and ethical results.    The roots of geographic influence often run far underground before  coming to the surface, to sprout into some flowering growth; and to  trace this back to its parent stem is the necessary but not easy task of  the geographer.    [Sidenote: Time element.]    The complexity of this problem does not end here. The modification of  human development by environment is a natural process; like all other  natural processes, it involves the cumulative effects of causes  operating imperceptibly but persistently through vast periods of time.  Slowly and deliberately does geography engrave the subtitles to a  people's history. Neglect of this time element in the consideration of  geographic influences accounts equally for many an exaggerated assertion  and denial of their power. A critic undertakes to disprove modification  through physical environment by showing that it has not produced  tangible results in the last fifty or five hundred years. This attitude  recalls the early geologists, whose imaginations could not conceive the  vast ages necessary in a scientific explanation of geologic phenomena.    The theory of evolution has taught us in science to think in larger  terms of time, so that we no longer raise the question whether European  colonists in Africa can turn into negroes, though we do find the recent  amazing statement that the Yankee, in his tall, gaunt figure, \"the  colour of his skin, and the formation of his hair, has begun to  differentiate himself from his European kinsman and approach the type of  the aboriginal Indians.\"[28] Evolution tells the story of modification  by a succession of infinitesimal changes, and emphasizes the permanence  of a modification once produced long after the causes for it cease to  act. The mesas of Arizona, the earth sculpture of the Grand Canyon  remain as monuments to the erosive forces which produced them. So a  habitat leaves upon man no ephemeral impress; it affects him in one way  at a low stage of his development, and differently at a later or higher  stage, because the man himself and his relation to his environment have  been modified in the earlier period; but traces of that earlier  adaptation survive in his maturer life. Hence man's relation to his  environment must be looked at through the perspective of historical  development. It would be impossible to explain the history and national  character of the contemporary English solely by their twentieth century  response to their environment, because with insular conservatism they  carry and cherish vestiges of times when their islands represented  different geographic relations from those of to-day. Witness the  wool-sack of the lord chancellor. We cannot understand the location of  modern Athens, Rome or Berlin from the present day relations of urban  populations to their environment, because the original choice of these  sites was dictated by far different considerations from those ruling  to-day. In the history of these cities a whole succession of geographic  factors have in turn"]]]
