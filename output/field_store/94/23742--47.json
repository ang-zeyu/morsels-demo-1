Raf circled twice, eyeing the surface of the roof in search of any  break which could mean a crack-up at landing. And then, though he  refused to be hurried by the urgency of the men with him, he came in,  cutting speed, bringing them down with only a slight jar.    Hobart twisted around to face Soriki. \"Still getting it?\"    The other, cupping his earphones to his head with his hands, nodded.  \"Give me a minute or two,\" he told them, \"and I'll have a fix. They're  excited about something--the way this jabber-jabber is coming  through--\"    \"About us,\" Raf thought. The ruined tower topped them to the south.  And to the east and west there were buildings as high as the one they  were perched on. But the town he had seen as he maneuvered for a  landing had held no signs of life. Around them were only signs of  decay.    Lablet got out of the flitter and walked to the edge of the roof,  leaning against the parapet to focus his vision glasses on what lay  below. After a moment Raf followed his example.    Silence and desolation, windows like the eye pits in bone-picked  skulls. There were even some small patches of vegetation rooted and  growing in pockets erosion had carved in the walls. To the pilot's  uninformed eyes the city looked wholly dead.    \"Got it!\" Soriki's exultant cry brought them back to the flitter. As  if his body was the indicator, he had pivoted until his outstretched  hand pointed southwest. \"About a quarter of a mile that way.\"    They shielded their eyes against the westering sun. A block of solid  masonry loomed high in the sky, dwarfing not only the building they  were standing on but all the towers around it. Its imposing lines made  clear its one-time importance.    \"Palace,\" mused Lablet, \"or capitol. I'd say it was just about the  heart of the city.\"    He dropped his glasses to swing on their cord, his eyes glistening as  he spoke directly to Raf.    \"Can you set us down on that?\"    The pilot measured the curving roof of the structure. A crazy fool  might try to make a landing there. But he was no crazy fool. \"Not on  that roof!\" he spoke with decision.    To his relief the captain confirmed his verdict with a slow nod.  \"Better find out more first.\" Hobart could be cautious when he wanted  to. \"Are they still broadcasting, Soriki?\"    The com-tech had stripped the earphones from his head and was rubbing  one ear. \"Are they!\" he exploded. \"I'd think you could hear them clear  over there, sir!\"    And they could. The gabble-gabble which bore no resemblance to any  language Terra knew boiled out of the phones.    \"Someone's excited,\" Lablet commented in his usual mild tone.    \"Maybe they've discovered us.\" Hobart's hand went to the weapon at his  belt. \"We must make peaceful contact--if we can.\"    Lablet took off his helmet and ran his fingers through the scrappy  ginger-and-gray fringe receding from his forehead. \"Yes--contact will  be necessary--\" he said thoughtfully.    Well, he was supposed to be their expert on that. Raf watched the  older man with something akin to amusement. The pilot had a suspicion  that none of the other three, Lablet included, was in any great hurry  to push through contact with unknown aliens. It was a case of dancing  along on shore before having to plunge into the chill of autumn sea  waves. Terrans had explored their own solar system, and they had  speculated learnedly for generations on the problem of intelligent  alien life. There had been all kinds of reports by experts and  would-be experts. But the stark fact remained that heretofore mankind  as born on the third planet of Sol had _not_ encountered intelligent  alien life. And just how far did speculations, reports, and arguments  go when one was faced with the problem to be solved practically--and  speedily?    Raf's own solution would have been to proceed with caution and yet  more caution. Under his technical training he had far more imagination  than any of his officers had ever realized. And now he was certain  that the best course of action was swift retreat until they knew more  about what was to be faced.    But in the end the decision was taken out of their hands. A muffled  exclamation from Lablet brought them all around to see that distant  curving roof crack wide open. From the shadows within, a flyer  spiraled up into the late afternoon sky.    Raf reached the flitter in two leaps. Without orders he had the spray  gun ready for action, on point and aimed at the bobbing machine  heading toward them. From the earphones Soriki had left on the seat  the gabble had risen to a screech and one part of Raf's brain noted  that the sounds were repetitious: was an order to surrender being  broadcast? His thumb was firm on the firing button of the gun and he  was about to send a warning burst to the right of the alien when an  order from Hobart stopped him cold.    \"Take it easy, Kurbi.\"    Soriki said something about a \"gun-happy flitter pilot,\" but, Raf  noted with bleak eyes, the com-tech kept his own hand close to his  belt arm. Only Lablet stood watching the oncoming alien ship with  placidity. But then, as Raf had learned through the long voyage of the  spacer, a period of time which had left few character traits of any of  the crew hidden from their fellows, the xenobiologist was a fatalist  and strictly averse to personal combat.    The pilot did not leave his seat at the gun. But within seconds he  knew that they had lost the initial advantage. As the tongue-shaped  stranger thrust at them and then swept on to glide above their heads  so that the weird shadow of the ship licked them from light to dark  and then to light again, Raf was certain that his superiors had made  the wrong decision. They should have left the city as soon as they  picked up those signals--if they could have gone then. He studied the  other flyer. Its lines suggested speed as well as mobility, and he  began to doubt if they _could_ have escaped with that craft trailing  them.    Well, what would they do now? The alien flyer could not land here, not  without coming down flat upon the flitter. Maybe it would cruise  overhead as a warning threat until the city dwellers were able to  reach the Terrans in some other manner. Tense, the four spacemen stood  watching the graceful movements of the flyer. There were no visible  portholes or openings anywhere along its ovoid sides. It might be a  robot-controlled ship, it might be anything, Raf thought, even a bomb  of sorts. If it was being flown by some human--or nonhuman--flyer, he  was a master pilot.    \"I don't understand,\" Soriki moved impatiently. \"They're just  shuttling around up there. What do we do now?\"    Lablet turned his head. He was smiling faintly. \"We wait,\" he told the  com-tech. \"I should imagine it takes time to climb twenty flights of  stairs--if they have stairs--\"    Soriki's attention fell from the flyer hovering over their heads to  the surface of the roof. Raf had already looked that over without  seeing any opening. But he did not doubt the truth of Lablet's  surmise. Sooner or later the aliens were going to reappear. And it did  not greatly matter to the marooned Terrans whether they would drop  from the sky or rise from below.          5    BANDED DEVIL      Familiar only with the wave-riding outriggers, Dalgard took his seat  in the alien craft with misgivings. And oddly enough it also bothered  him to occupy a post which earlier had served not a nonhuman such as  Sssuri, whom he admired, but a humanoid whom he had been taught from  childhood to avoid--if not fear. The skiff was rounded at bow and  stern with very shallow sides and displayed a tendency to whirl about  in the current, until Sssuri, with his instinctive knowledge of  watercraft, used one of the queerly shaped paddles tucked away in the  bottom to both steer and propel them. They did not strike directly  across the river but allowed the current to carry them in a diagonal  path so that they came out on the opposite bank some distance to the  west.    Sssuri brought them ashore with masterly skill where a strip of sod  angled down to the edge of the water, marking, Dalgard decided, what  had once been a garden. The buildings on this side of the river were  not set so closely together. Each, standing some two or three stories  high, was encircled by green, as if this had been a section of private  dwellings.    They pulled the light boat out of the water and Sssuri pointed at the  open door of the nearest house. \"In there--\"    Dalgard agreed that it might be well to hide the craft against the  return. Although as yet they had found no physical evidence, other  than the dead hoppers, that they might not be alone in the city, he  wanted a means of escape ready if such a flight would be necessary. In  the meantime there was the snake-devil to track, and that wily  creature, if it had swum the river, might be lurking at present in the  next silent street--or miles away.    Sssuri, spear ready, was trotting along the paved lane, his head up as  he thought-quested for any hint of life about them. Dalgard tried to  follow that lead. But he knew that it would be Sssuri's stronger power  which would warn them first.    They cast east from where they had landed, studying the soil of each  garden spot, hunting for the unmistakable spoor of the giant reptile.  And within a matter of minutes they found it, the mud still moist as  Dalgard proved with an exploring fingertip. At the same time Sssuri  twirled his spear significantly. Before them the lane ran on between  two walls without any breaks. Dalgard uncased his bow and strung it.  From his quiver he chose one of the powerful arrows, the points of  which were kept capped until use.

Noon-time and June-time down around the river!          A MEDIEVAL DISCOVERER    BY BILL NYE      Galilei, commonly called Galileo, was born at Pisa on the 14th day of  February, 1564. He was the man who discovered some of the fundamental  principles governing the movements, habits, and personal peculiarities  of the earth. He discovered things with marvelous fluency. Born as he  was, at a time when the rotary motion of the earth was still in its  infancy and astronomy was taught only in a crude way, Galileo started in  to make a few discoveries and advance some theories which he loved.    He was the son of a musician and learned to play several instruments  himself, but not in such a way as to arouse the jealousy of the great  musicians of his day. They came and heard him play a few selections, and  then they went home contented with their own music. Galileo played for  several years in a band at Pisa, and people who heard him said that his  manner of gazing out over the Pisan hills with a far-away look in his  eye after playing a selection, while he gently up-ended his alto horn  and worked the mud-valve as he poured out about a pint of moist melody  that had accumulated in the flues of the instrument, was simply grand.    At the age of twenty Galileo began to discover. His first discoveries  were, of course, clumsy and poorly made, but very soon he commenced to  turn out neat and durable discoveries that would stand for years.    It was at this time that he noticed the swinging of a lamp in a church,  and, observing that the oscillations were of equal duration, he inferred  that this principle might be utilized in the exact measurement of time.  From this little accident, years after, came the clock, one of the most  useful of man's dumb friends. And yet there are people who will read  this little incident and still hesitate about going to church.    Galileo also invented the thermometer, the microscope and the  proportional compass. He seemed to invent things not for the money to be  obtained in that way, but solely for the joy of being first on the  ground. He was a man of infinite genius and perseverance. He was also  very fair in his treatment of other inventors. Though he did not  personally invent the rotary motion of the earth, he heartily indorsed  it and said it was a good thing. He also came out in a card in which he  said that he believed it to be a good thing, and that he hoped some day  to see it applied to the other planets.    He was also the inventor of a telescope that had a magnifying power of  thirty times. He presented this to the Venetian senate, and it was used  in making appropriations for river and harbor improvements.    By telescopic investigation Galileo discovered the presence of microbes  in the moon, but was unable to do anything for it. I have spoken of Mr.  Galileo, informally calling him by his first name, all the way through  this article, for I feel so thoroughly acquainted with him, though there  was such a striking difference in our ages, that I think I am justified  in using his given name while talking of him.    Galileo also sat up nights and visited with Venus through a long  telescope which he had made himself from an old bamboo fishing-rod.    But astronomy is a very enervating branch of science. Galileo frequently  came down to breakfast with red, heavy eyes, eyes that were swollen full  of unshed tears. Still he persevered. Day after day he worked and  toiled. Year after year he went on with his task till he had worked out  in his own mind the satellites of Jupiter and placed a small tin tag on  each one, so that he would know it readily when he saw it again. Then he  began to look up Saturn's rings and investigate the freckles on the sun.  He did not stop at trifles, but went bravely on till everybody came for  miles to look at him and get him to write something funny in their  autograph albums. It was not an unusual thing for Galileo to get up in  the morning, after a wearisome night with a fretful, new-born star, to  find his front yard full of albums. Some of them were little red albums  with floral decorations on them, while others were the large plush and  alligator albums of the affluent. Some were new and had the price-mark  still on them, while others were old, foundered albums, with a droop in  the back and little flecks of egg and gravy on the title-page. All came  with a request for Galileo \"to write a little, witty, characteristic  sentiment in them.\"    Galileo was the author of the hydrostatic paradox and other sketches. He  was a great reader and a fluent penman. One time he was absent from  home, lecturing in Venice for the benefit of the United Aggregation of  Mutual Admirers, and did not return for two weeks, so that when he got  back he found the front room full of autograph albums. It is said that  he then demonstrated his great fluency and readiness as a thinker and  writer. He waded through the entire lot in two days with only two men  from West Pisa to assist him. Galileo came out of it fresh and youthful,  and all of the following night he was closeted with another inventor, a  wicker-covered microscope, and a bologna sausage. The investigations  were carried on for two weeks, after which Galileo went out to the  inebriate asylum and discovered some new styles of reptiles.    Galileo was the author of a little work called \"I Discarsi e  Dimas-Trazioni Matematiche Intorus a Due Muove Scienze.\" It was a neat  little book, of about the medium height, and sold well on the trains,  for the Pisan newsboys on the cars were very affable, as they are now,  and when they came and leaned an armful of these books on a passenger's  leg and poured into his ear a long tale about the wonderful beauty of  the work, and then pulled in the name of the book from the rear of the  last car, where it had been hanging on behind, the passenger would most  always buy it and enough of the name to wrap it up in.    He also discovered the isochronism of the pendulum. He saw that the  pendulum at certain seasons of the year looked yellow under the eyes,  and that it drooped and did not enter into its work with the old zest.  He began to study the case with the aid of his new bamboo telescope and  a wicker-covered microscope. As a result, in ten days he had the  pendulum on its feet again.    Galileo was inclined to be liberal in his religious views, more  especially in the matter of the Scriptures, claiming that there were  passages in the Bible which did not literally mean what the translator  said they did. This was where Galileo missed it. So long as he  discovered stars and isochronisms and such things as that, he"]]]
