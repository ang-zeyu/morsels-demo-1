The  manuka-tree, bent by the southerly winds, was like a bird on one leg  stretching out a wing.    But when Beryl looked at the bush, it seemed to her the bush was sad.    \"We are dumb trees, reaching up in the night, imploring we know not  what,\" said the sorrowful bush.    It is true when you are by yourself and you think about life, it is  always sad. All that excitement and so on has a way of suddenly leaving  you, and it's as though, in the silence, somebody called your name, and  you heard your name for the first time. \"Beryl!\"    \"Yes, I'm here. I'm Beryl. Who wants me?\"    \"Beryl!\"    \"Let me come.\"    It is lonely living by oneself. Of course, there are relations, friends,  heaps of them; but that's not what she means. She wants some one who  will find the Beryl they none of them know, who will expect her to be  that Beryl always. She wants a lover.    \"Take me away from all these other people, my love. Let us go far away.  Let us live our life, all new, all ours, from the very beginning. Let us  make our fire. Let us sit down to eat together. Let us have long talks  at night.\"    And the thought was almost, \"Save me, my love. Save me!\"    ... \"Oh, go on! Don't be a prude, my dear. You enjoy yourself while  you're young. That's my advice.\" And a high rush of silly laughter  joined Mrs. Harry Kember's loud, indifferent neigh.    You see, it's so frightfully difficult when you've nobody. You're so  at the mercy of things. You can't just be rude. And you've always this  horror of seeming inexperienced and stuffy like the other ninnies at the  Bay. And--and it's fascinating to know you've power over people. Yes,  that is fascinating...    Oh why, oh why doesn't \"he\" come soon?    If I go on living here, thought Beryl, anything may happen to me.    \"But how do you know he is coming at all?\" mocked a small voice within  her.    But Beryl dismissed it. She couldn't be left. Other people, perhaps, but  not she. It wasn't possible to think that Beryl Fairfield never married,  that lovely fascinating girl.    \"Do you remember Beryl Fairfield?\"    \"Remember her! As if I could forget her! It was one summer at the  Bay that I saw her. She was standing on the beach in a blue\"--no,  pink--\"muslin frock, holding on a big cream\"--no, black--\"straw hat. But  it's years ago now.\"    \"She's as lovely as ever, more so if anything.\"    Beryl smiled, bit her lip, and gazed over the garden. As she gazed, she  saw somebody, a man, leave the road, step along the paddock beside their  palings as if he was coming straight towards her. Her heart beat. Who  was it? Who could it be? It couldn't be a burglar, certainly not a  burglar, for he was smoking and he strolled lightly. Beryl's heart  leapt; it seemed to turn right over, and then to stop. She recognized  him.    \"Good evening, Miss Beryl,\" said the voice softly.    \"Good evening.\"    \"Won't you come for a little walk?\" it drawled.    Come for a walk--at that time of night! \"I couldn't. Everybody's in bed.  Everybody's asleep.\"    \"Oh,\" said the voice lightly, and a whiff of sweet smoke reached her.  \"What does everybody matter? Do come! It's such a fine night. There's  not a soul about.\"    Beryl shook her head. But already something stirred in her, something  reared its head.    The voice said, \"Frightened?\" It mocked, \"Poor little girl!\"    \"Not in the least,\" said she. As she spoke that weak thing within her  seemed to uncoil, to grow suddenly tremendously strong; she longed to  go!    And just as if this was quite understood by the other, the voice said,  gently and softly, but finally, \"Come along!\"    Beryl stepped over her low window, crossed the veranda, ran down the  grass to the gate. He was there before her.    \"That's right,\" breathed the voice, and it teased, \"You're not  frightened, are you? You're not frightened?\"    She was; now she was here she was terrified, and it seemed to her  everything was different. The moonlight stared and glittered; the  shadows were like bars of iron. Her hand was taken.    \"Not in the least,\" she said lightly. \"Why should I be?\"    Her hand was pulled gently, tugged. She held back.    \"No, I'm not coming any farther,\" said Beryl.    \"Oh, rot!\" Harry Kember didn't believe her. \"Come along! We'll just go  as far as that fuchsia bush. Come along!\"    The fuchsia bush was tall. It fell over the fence in a shower. There was  a little pit of darkness beneath.    \"No, really, I don't want to,\" said Beryl.    For a moment Harry Kember didn't answer. Then he came close to her,  turned to her, smiled and said quickly, \"Don't be silly! Don't be  silly!\"    His smile was something she'd never seen before. Was he drunk? That  bright, blind, terrifying smile froze her with horror. What was she  doing? How had she got here? the stern garden asked her as the gate  pushed open, and quick as a cat Harry Kember came through and snatched  her to him.    \"Cold little devil! Cold little devil!\" said the hateful voice.    But Beryl was strong. She slipped, ducked, wrenched free.    \"You are vile, vile,\" said she.    \"Then why in God's name did you come?\" stammered Harry Kember.    Nobody answered him.      Chapter 1.XIII.    A cloud, small, serene, floated across the moon. In that moment of  darkness the sea sounded deep, troubled. Then the cloud sailed away,  and the sound of the sea was a vague murmur, as though it waked out of a  dark dream. All was still.          2. THE GARDEN PARTY.    And after all the weather was ideal. They could not have had a more  perfect day for a garden-party if they had ordered it. Windless, warm,  the sky without a cloud. Only the blue was veiled with a haze of light  gold, as it is sometimes in early summer. The gardener had been up since  dawn, mowing the lawns and sweeping them, until the grass and the dark  flat rosettes where the daisy plants had been seemed to shine. As for  the roses, you could not help feeling they understood that roses are  the only flowers that impress people at garden-parties; the only flowers  that everybody is certain of knowing. Hundreds, yes, literally hundreds,  had come out in a single night; the green bushes bowed down as though  they had been visited by archangels.    Breakfast was not yet over before the men came to put up the marquee.    \"Where do you want the marquee put, mother?\"    \"My dear child, it's no use asking me. I'm determined to leave  everything to you children this year. Forget I am your mother. Treat me  as an honoured guest.\"    But Meg could not possibly go and supervise the men. She had washed  her hair before breakfast, and she sat drinking her coffee in a green  turban, with a dark wet curl stamped on each cheek. Jose, the butterfly,  always came down in a silk petticoat and a kimono jacket.    \"You'll have to go, Laura; you're the artistic one.\"    Away Laura flew, still holding her piece of bread-and-butter. It's so  delicious to have an excuse for eating out of doors, and besides, she  loved having to arrange things; she always felt she could do it so much  better than anybody else.    Four men in their shirt-sleeves stood grouped together on the garden  path. They carried staves covered with rolls of canvas, and they had big  tool-bags slung on their backs. They looked impressive. Laura wished now  that she had not got the bread-and-butter, but there was nowhere to put  it, and she couldn't possibly throw it away. She blushed and tried to  look severe and even a little bit short-sighted as she came up to them.    \"Good morning,\" she said, copying her mother's voice. But that sounded  so fearfully affected that she was ashamed, and stammered like a little  girl, \"Oh--er--have you come--is it about the marquee?\"    \"That's right, miss,\" said the tallest of the men, a lanky, freckled  fellow, and he shifted his tool-bag, knocked back his straw hat and  smiled down at her. \"That's about it.\"    His smile was so easy, so friendly that Laura recovered. What nice eyes  he had, small, but such a dark blue! And now she looked at the others,  they were smiling too. \"Cheer up, we won't bite,\" their smile seemed  to say. How very nice workmen were! And what a beautiful morning! She  mustn't mention the morning; she must be business-like. The marquee.    \"Well, what about the lily-lawn? Would that do?\"    And she pointed to the lily-lawn with the hand that didn't hold the  bread-and-butter. They turned, they stared in the direction. A little  fat chap thrust out his under-lip, and the tall fellow frowned.    \"I don't fancy it,\" said he. \"Not conspicuous enough. You see, with a  thing like a marquee,\" and he turned to Laura in his easy way, \"you want  to put it somewhere where it'll give you a bang slap in the eye, if you  follow me.\"    Laura's upbringing made her wonder for a moment whether it was quite  respectful of a workman to talk to her of bangs slap in the eye. But she  did quite follow him.    \"A corner of the tennis-court,\" she suggested. \"But the band's going to  be in one corner.\"    \"H'm, going to have a band, are you?\" said another of the workmen.  He was pale. He had a haggard look as his dark eyes scanned the  tennis-court. What was he thinking?    \"Only a very small band,\" said Laura gently. Perhaps he wouldn't mind so  much if the band was quite small. But the tall fellow interrupted.    \"Look here, miss, that's the place. Against those trees. Over there.  That'll do fine.\"    Against the karakas. Then the karaka-trees would be hidden. And they  were so lovely, with their broad, gleaming leaves, and their clusters  of yellow fruit. They were like trees you imagined growing on a desert  island, proud, solitary, lifting their leaves and fruits to the sun in a  kind of silent splendour. Must they be hidden by a marquee?    They must. Already the men had shouldered their staves and were making  for the place. Only the tall fellow was left. He bent down, pinched a  sprig of lavender, put his thumb and forefinger to his nose "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14291"],[0,"The Story of Geographical Discovery: How the World Became Known (#8)"],[1," a world-historic  change in the condition of civilisation. During the course of the  seventh and eighth centuries (roughly, between 622 and 750) the  inhabitants of the Arabian peninsula burst the seclusion which they  had held since the beginning, almost, of history, and, inspired  by the zeal of the newly-founded religion of Islam, spread their  influence from India to Spain, along the southern littoral of the  Mediterranean. When they had once settled down, they began to recover  the remnants of Graeco-Roman science that had been lost on the north  shores of the Mediterranean. The Christians of Syria used Greek  for their sacred language, and accordingly when the Sultans of  Bagdad desired to know something of the wisdom of the Greeks, they  got Syriac-speaking Christians to translate some of the scientific  works of the Greeks, first into Syriac, and thence into Arabic. In  this way they obtained a knowledge of the great works of Ptolemy,  both in astronomy--which they regarded as the more important, and  therefore the greatest, Almagest--and also in geography, though  one can easily understand the great modifications which the strange  names of Ptolemy must have undergone in being transcribed, first  into Syriac and then into Arabic. We shall see later on some of  the results of the Arabic Ptolemy.    The conquests of the Arabs affected the knowledge of geography  in a twofold way: by bringing about the Crusades, and by renewing  the acquaintance of the west with the east of Asia. The Arabs were  acquainted with South-Eastern Africa as far south as Zanzibar and  Sofala, though, following the views of Ptolemy as to the Great  Unknown South Land, they imagined that these spread out into the  Indian Ocean towards India. They seem even to have had some vague  knowledge of the sources of the Nile. They were also acquainted  with Ceylon, Java, and Sumatra, and they were the first people to  learn the various uses to which the cocoa-nut can be put. Their  merchants, too, visited China as early as the ninth century, and we  have from their accounts some of the earliest descriptions of the  Chinese, who were described by them as a handsome people, superior  in beauty to the Indians, with fine dark hair, regular features,  and very like the Arabs. We shall see later on how comparatively  easy it was for a Mohammedan to travel from one end of the known  world to the other, owing to the community of religion throughout  such a vast area.    Some words should perhaps be said on the geographical works of the  Arabs. One of the most important of these, by Yacut, is in the form  of a huge Gazetteer, arranged in alphabetical order; but the greatest  geographical work of the Arabs is by EDRISI, geographer to King Roger  of Sicily, 1154, who describes the world somewhat after the manner  of Ptolemy, but with modifications of some interest. He divides the  world into seven horizontal strips, known as \"climates,\" and ranging  from the equator to the British Isles. These strips are subdivided  into eleven sections, so that the world, in Edrisi's conception,  is like a chess-board, divided into seventy-seven squares, and his  work consists of an elaborate description of each of these squares  taken one by one, each climate being worked through regularly, so  that you might get parts of France in the eighth and ninth squares,  and other parts in the sixteenth and seventeenth. Such a method  was not adapted to give a clear conception of separate countries,  but this was scarcely Edrisi's object. When the Arabs--or, indeed,  any of the ancient or mediaeval writers--wanted wanted to describe  a land, they wrote about the tribe or nation inhabiting it, and  not about the position of the towns in it; in other words, they  drew a marked distinction between ethnology and geography.    [Illustration: THE WORLD ACCORDING TO IBN HAUKAL.]    But the geography of the Arabs had little or no influence upon  that of Europe, which, so far as maps went, continued to be based  on fancy instead of fact almost up to the time of Columbus.    Meanwhile another movement had been going on during the eighth and  ninth centuries, which helped to make Europe what it is, and extended  considerably the common knowledge of the northern European peoples.  For the first time since the disappearance of the Phoenicians,  a great naval power came into existence in Norway, and within a  couple of centuries it had influenced almost the whole sea-coast  of Europe. The Vikings, or Sea-Rovers, who kept their long ships  in the _viks_, or fjords, of Norway, made vigorous attacks all  along the coast of Europe, and in several cases formed stable  governments, and so made, in a way, a sort of crust for Europe,  preventing any further shaking of its human contents. In Iceland, in  England, in Ireland, in Normandy, in Sicily, and at Constantinople  (where they formed the _Varangi_, or body-guard of the Emperor),  as well as in Russia, and for a time in the Holy Land, Vikings or  Normans founded kingdoms between which there was a lively interchange  of visits and knowledge.    They certainly extended their voyages to Greenland, and there is a  good deal of evidence for believing that they travelled from Greenland  to Labrador and Newfoundland. In the year 1001, an Icelander named  Biorn, sailing to Greenland to visit his father, was driven to  the south-west, and came to a country which they called Vinland,  inhabited by dwarfs, and having a shortest day of eight hours,  which would correspond roughly to 50 deg. north latitude. The Norsemen  settled there, and as late as 1121 the Bishop of Greenland visited  them, in order to convert them to Christianity. There is little  reason to doubt that this Vinland was on the mainland of North  America, and the Norsemen were therefore the first Europeans to  discover America. As late as 1380, two Venetians, named Zeno, visited  Iceland, and reported that there was a tradition there of a land  named Estotiland, a thousand miles west of the Faroe Islands, and  south of Greenland. The people were reported to be civilised and  good seamen, though unacquainted with the use of the compass, while  south of them were savage cannibals, and still more to the south-west  another civilised people, who built large cities and temples, but  offered up human victims in them. There seems to be here a dim  knowledge of the Mexicans.    The great difficulty in maritime discovery, both for the ancients  and the men of the Middle Ages, was the necessity of keeping close  to the shore. It is true they might guide themselves by the sun  during the day, and by the pole-star at night, but if once the  sky was overcast, they would become entirely at a loss for their  bearings. Hence the discovery of the polar tendency of the magnetic  needle was a necessary prelude to any extended voyages away from  land. This appears to have been known to the Chinese from quite  ancient times, and utilised on their junks as early as the eleventh  century. The Arabs, who voyaged to Ceylon and Java, appear to have  learnt its use from the Chinese, and it is probably from them that  the mariners of Barcelona first introduced its use into Europe.  The first mention of it is given in a treatise on Natural History  by Alexander Neckam, foster-brother of Richard, Coeur de Lion.  Another reference, in a satirical poem of the troubadour, Guyot  of Provence (1190), states that mariners can steer to the north  star without seeing it, by following the direction of a needle  floating in a straw in a basin of water, after it had been touched  by a magnet. But little use, however, seems to have been made of  this, for Brunetto Latini, Dante's tutor, when on a visit to Roger  Bacon in 1258, states that the friar had shown him the magnet and  its properties, but adds that, however useful the discovery, \"no  master mariner would dare to use it, lest he should be thought to  be a magician.\" Indeed, in the form in which it was first used  it would be of little practical utility, and it was not till the  method was found of balancing it on a pivot and fixing it on a  card, as at present used, that it became a necessary part of a  sailor's outfit. This practical improvement is attributed to one  Flavio Gioja, of Amalfi, in the beginning of the fourteenth century.    [Illustration: THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST IN THE PORTULANI.]    When once the mariner's compass had come into general use, and  its indications observed by master mariners in their voyages, a  much more practical method was at hand for determining the relative  positions of the different lands. Hitherto geographers (_i.e._,  mainly the Greeks and Arabs) had had to depend for fixing relative  positions on the vague statements in the itineraries of merchants and  soldiers; but now, with the aid of the compass, it was not difficult  to determine the relative position of one point to another, while  all the windings of a road could be fixed down on paper without  much difficulty. Consequently, while the learned monks were content  with the mixture of myth and fable which we have seen to have formed  the basis of their maps of the world, the seamen of the Mediterranean  were gradually building up charts of that sea and the neighbouring  lands which varied but little from the true position. A chart of  this kind was called a Portulano, as giving information of the  best routes from port to port, and Baron Nordenskiold has recently  shown how all these _portulani_ are derived from a single Catalan  map which has been lost, but must have been compiled between 1266  and 1291. And yet there were some of the learned who were not above  taking instruction from the practical knowledge of the seamen.  In 1339, one Angelico Dulcert, of Majorca, made an elaborate map  of the world on the principle of the portulano, giving the coast  line--at least of the Mediterranean--with remarkable accuracy. A  little later, in 1375, a Jew of the same island,"]]]
