It is incumbent  upon them to take counsel together and to have regard for the interests of  the servants of God, for His sake, even as they regard their own  interests, and to choose that which is meet and seemly. Thus hath the Lord  your God commanded you. Beware lest ye put away that which is clearly  revealed in His Tablet. Fear God, O ye that perceive.    31 O people of the world! Build ye houses of worship throughout the lands  in the name of Him Who is the Lord of all religions. Make them as perfect  as is possible in the world of being, and adorn them with that which  befitteth them, not with images and effigies. Then, with radiance and joy,  celebrate therein the praise of your Lord, the Most Compassionate. Verily,  by His remembrance the eye is cheered and the heart is filled with light.    32 The Lord hath ordained that those of you who are able shall make  pilgrimage to the sacred House, and from this He hath exempted women as a  mercy on His part. He, of a truth, is the All-Bountiful, the Most  Generous.    33 O people of Baha! It is incumbent upon each one of you to engage in  some occupation--such as a craft, a trade or the like. We have exalted your  engagement in such work to the rank of worship of the one true God.  Reflect, O people, on the grace and blessings of your Lord, and yield Him  thanks at eventide and dawn. Waste not your hours in idleness and sloth,  but occupy yourselves with what will profit you and others. Thus hath it  been decreed in this Tablet from whose horizon hath shone the day-star of  wisdom and utterance. The most despised of men in the sight of God are  they who sit and beg. Hold ye fast unto the cord of means and place your  trust in God, the Provider of all means.    34 The kissing of hands hath been forbidden in the Book. This practice is  prohibited by God, the Lord of glory and command. To none is it permitted  to seek absolution from another soul; let repentance be between yourselves  and God. He, verily, is the Pardoner, the Bounteous, the Gracious, the One  Who absolveth the repentant.    35 O ye servants of the Merciful One! Arise to serve the Cause of God, in  such wise that the cares and sorrows caused by them that have disbelieved  in the Dayspring of the Signs of God may not afflict you. At the time when  the Promise was fulfilled and the Promised One made manifest, differences  have appeared amongst the kindreds of the earth and each people hath  followed its own fancy and idle imaginings.    36 Amongst the people is he who seateth himself amid the sandals by the  door whilst coveting in his heart the seat of honour. Say: What manner of  man art thou, O vain and heedless one, who wouldst appear as other than  thou art? And among the people is he who layeth claim to inner knowledge,  and still deeper knowledge concealed within this knowledge. Say: Thou  speakest false! By God! What thou dost possess is naught but husks which  We have left to thee as bones are left to dogs. By the righteousness of  the one true God! Were anyone to wash the feet of all mankind, and were he  to worship God in the forests, valleys, and mountains, upon high hills and  lofty peaks, to leave no rock or tree, no clod of earth, but was a witness  to his worship--yet, should the fragrance of My good pleasure not be  inhaled from him, his works would never be acceptable unto God. Thus hath  it been decreed by Him Who is the Lord of all. How many a man hath  secluded himself in the climes of India, denied himself the things that  God hath decreed as lawful, imposed upon himself austerities and  mortifications, and hath not been remembered by God, the Revealer of  Verses. Make not your deeds as snares wherewith to entrap the object of  your aspiration, and deprive not yourselves of this Ultimate Objective for  which have ever yearned all such as have drawn nigh unto God. Say: The  very life of all deeds is My good pleasure, and all things depend upon  Mine acceptance. Read ye the Tablets that ye may know what hath been  purposed in the Books of God, the All-Glorious, the Ever-Bounteous. He who  attaineth to My love hath title to a throne of gold, to sit thereon in  honour over all the world; he who is deprived thereof, though he sit upon  the dust, that dust would seek refuge with God, the Lord of all Religions.    37 Whoso layeth claim to a Revelation direct from God, ere the expiration  of a full thousand years, such a man is assuredly a lying impostor. We  pray God that He may graciously assist him to retract and repudiate such  claim. Should he repent, God will, no doubt, forgive him. If, however, he  persisteth in his error, God will, assuredly, send down one who will deal  mercilessly with him. Terrible, indeed, is God in punishing! Whosoever  interpreteth this verse otherwise than its obvious meaning is deprived of  the Spirit of God and of His mercy which encompasseth all created things.  Fear God, and follow not your idle fancies. Nay, rather, follow the  bidding of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Wise. Erelong shall clamorous  voices be raised in most lands. Shun them, O My people, and follow not the  iniquitous and evil-hearted. This is that of which We gave you forewarning  when We were dwelling in 'Iraq, then later while in the Land of Mystery,  and now from this Resplendent Spot.    38 Be not dismayed, O peoples of the world, when the day-star of My beauty  is set, and the heaven of My tabernacle is concealed from your eyes. Arise  to further My Cause, and to exalt My Word amongst men. We are with you at  all times, and shall strengthen you through the power of truth. We are  truly almighty. Whoso hath recognized Me will arise and serve Me with such  determination that the powers of earth and heaven shall be unable to  defeat his purpose.    39 The peoples of the world are fast asleep. Were they to wake from their  slumber, they would hasten with eagerness unto God, the All-Knowing, the  All-Wise. They would cast away everything they possess, be it all the  treasures of the earth, that their Lord may remember them to the extent of  addressing to them but one word. Such is the instruction given you by Him  Who holdeth the knowledge of things hidden, in a Tablet which the eye of  creation hath not seen, and which is revealed to none except His own Self,  the omnipotent Protector of all worlds. So bewildered are they in the  drunkenness of their evil desires, that they are powerless to recognize  the Lord of all being, Whose voice calleth aloud from every direction:  \"There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Wise.\"    40 Say: Rejoice not in the things ye possess; tonight they are yours,  tomorrow others will possess them. Thus warneth you He Who is the  All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Say: Can ye claim that what ye own is  lasting or secure? Nay! By Myself, the All-Merciful, ye cannot, if ye be  of them who judge fairly. The days of your life flee away as a breath of  wind, and all your pomp and glory shall be folded up as were the pomp and  glory of those gone before you. Reflect, O people! What hath become of  your bygone days, your lost centuries? Happy the days that have been  consecrated to the remembrance of God, and blessed the hours which have  been spent in praise of Him Who is the All-Wise. By My life! Neither the  pomp of the mighty, nor the wealth of the rich, nor even the ascendancy of  the ungodly will endure. All will perish, at a word from Him. He, verily,  is the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling, the Almighty. What advantage is  there in the earthly things which men possess? That which shall profit  them, they have utterly neglected. Erelong, they will awake from their  slumber, and find themselves unable to obtain that which hath escaped them  in the days of their Lord, the Almighty, the All-Praised. Did they but  know it, they would renounce their all, that their names may be mentioned  before His throne. They, verily, are accounted among the dead.    41 Amongst the people is he whose learning hath made him proud, and who  hath been debarred thereby from recognizing My Name, the Self-Subsisting;  who, when he heareth the tread of sandals following behind him, waxeth  greater in his own esteem than Nimrod. Say: O rejected one! Where now is  his abode? By God, it is the nethermost fire. Say: O concourse of divines!  Hear ye not the shrill voice of My Most Exalted Pen? See ye not this Sun  that shineth in refulgent splendour above the All-Glorious Horizon? For  how long will ye worship the idols of your evil passions? Forsake your  vain imaginings, and turn yourselves unto God, your Everlasting Lord.    42 Endowments dedicated to charity revert to God, the Revealer of Signs.  None hath the right to dispose of them without leave from Him Who is the  Dawning-place of Revelation. After Him, this authority shall pass to the  Ag{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}san, and after them to the House of Justice--should it be established  in the world by then--that they may use these endowments for the benefit of  the Places which have been exalted in this Cause, and for whatsoever hath  been enjoined upon them by Him Who is the God of might and power.  Otherwise, the endowments shall revert to the people of Baha who speak not  except by His leave and judge not save in accordance with what God hath  decreed in this Tablet--lo, they are the champions of victory betwixt  heaven and earth--that they may use them in the manner that hath been laid  down in the Book by God, the Mighty, the Bountiful.    43 Lament not in your hours of trial, neither rejoice therein; seek ye the  Middle Way which is the remembrance of Me in your afflictions and  reflection over that which may befall you in future. Thus informeth you He  Who is the Omniscient, He Who is aware.    44 Shave not your heads; God hath adorned them with hair, and in this  there are signs from the Lord of creation to those who reflect upon the  requirements of nature. He, verily,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16528"],[0,"Forty-one years in India: from subaltern to commander-in-chief (#8)"],[1,"at  Peshawar, was Colonel Mackeson, a well-known frontier officer who had  greatly distinguished himself during the first Afghan war by his work  among the Afridis and other border tribes, by whom he was liked and  respected as much as he was feared. During Shah Shuja's brief reign  at Kabul, Mackeson was continually employed on political duty in the  Khyber Pass and at Peshawar. On the breaking out of the insurrection  at Kabul, he was indefatigable in forwarding supplies and money to  Sir Robert Sale at Jalalabad, hastening up the reinforcements, and  maintaining British influence in the Khyber, a task of no small  magnitude when we remember that a religious war had been proclaimed,  and all true believers had been called upon to exterminate the  Feringhis. While at Peshawar, as Commissioner, his duties were arduous  and his responsibilities heavy--the more so as at that time the Afghan  inhabitants of the city were in a dangerous and excited state.    On the 10th September, 1853, we were horrified to learn that Mackeson  had been murdered by a religious fanatic. He was sitting in the  verandah of his house listening to appeals from the decisions of his  subordinates, when, towards evening, a man--who had been remarked  by many during the day earnestly engaged in his devotions, his  prayer-carpet being spread within sight of the house--came up and,  making a low salaam to Mackeson, presented him with a paper. The  Commissioner, supposing it to be a petition, stretched out his hand to  take it, when the man instantly plunged a dagger into his breast. The  noise consequent on the struggle attracted the attention of some of  the domestic servants and one of the Native officials. The latter  threw himself between Mackeson and the fanatic, and was himself  slightly wounded in his efforts to rescue his Chief.    Mackeson lingered until the 14th September. His death caused  considerable excitement in the city and along the border, increasing  to an alarming extent when it became known that the murderer had been  hanged and his body burnt. This mode of disposing of one of their dead  is considered by Mahomedans as the greatest insult that can be offered  to their religion, for in thus treating the corpse, as if it were that  of (by them) a hated and despised Hindu, the dead man is supposed to  be deprived of every chance of paradise. It was not without careful  and deliberate consideration that this course was decided upon, and it  was only adopted on account of the deterrent effect it would have upon  fanatical Mahomedans, who count it all gain to sacrifice their lives  by the murder of a heretic, and thereby secure, as they firmly  believe, eternal happiness, but loathe the idea of being burned, which  effectually prevents the murderer being raised to the dignity of a  martyr, and revered as a saint ever after.    It being rumoured that the Pathans intended to retaliate by  desecrating the late Commissioner's grave, it was arranged that he  should be buried within cantonment limits. A monument was raised to  his memory by public subscription, and his epitaph[6] was written by  the Governor-General himself.    Shortly before Mackeson's murder my father had found it necessary to  go to the hill-station of Murree; the hot weather had tried him very  much, and he required a change. He had scarcely arrived there, when  he was startled by the news of the tragedy which had occurred, and at  once determined to return, notwithstanding its being the most sickly  season of the year at Peshawar, for he felt that at a time of such  dangerous excitement it was his duty to be present. As a precautionary  measure, he ordered the 22nd Foot from Rawal Pindi to Peshawar. This  and other steps which he deemed prudent to take soon put an end to the  disturbances.    No sooner had matters quieted down at Peshawar than the Jowaki  Afridis, who inhabit the country immediately to the east of the Kohat  Pass, began to give trouble, and we went out into camp to select a  site for a post which would serve to cover the northern entrance to  the pass and keep the tribesmen under surveillance. The great change  of temperature, from the intense heat he had undergone in the summer  to the bitter cold of November nights in tents, was too severe a trial  for my father. He was then close on seventy, and though apparently  active as ever, he was far from well, consequently the doctors  strongly urged him not to risk another hot weather in India. It was  accordingly settled that he should return to England without delay.    Shortly before his departure, an incident occurred which I will relate  for the benefit of psychological students; they may, perhaps, be able  to explain it, I never could. My father had some time before issued  invitations for a dance which was to take place in two days' time--on  Monday, the 17th October, 1853. On the Saturday morning he appeared  disturbed and unhappy, and during breakfast he was silent and  despondent--very different from his usual bright and cheery self.  On my questioning him as to the cause, he told me he had had an  unpleasant dream--one which he had dreamt several times before, and  which had always been followed by the death of a near relation. As the  day advanced, in spite of my efforts to cheer him, he became more and  more depressed, and even said he should like to put off the dance. I  dissuaded him from taking this step for the time being; but that night  he had the same dream again, and the next morning he insisted on  the dance being postponed. It seemed to me rather absurd to have to  disappoint our friends because of a dream; there was, however, nothing  for it but to carry out my father's wishes, and intimation was  accordingly sent to the invited guests. The following morning the post  brought news of the sudden death of the half-sister at Lahore with  whom I had stayed on my way to Peshawar.    As my father was really very unwell, it was not thought advisable for  him to travel alone, so it was arranged that I should accompany him to  Rawal Pindi. We started from Peshawar on the 27th November, and drove  as far as Nowshera. The next day we went on to Attock. I found the  invalid had benefited so much by the change that it was quite safe for  him to continue the journey alone, and I consented the more readily to  leave him, as I was anxious to get back to my battery, which had been  ordered on service, and was then with the force assembled at Bazidkhel  for an expedition against the Bori villages of the Jowaki Afridis.    Having said farewell to my father, I started for Bazidkhel early on  the 29th November. At that time there was no direct road to that place  from Nowshera, nor was it considered safe to travel alone along the  slopes of the lower Afridi hills. I had, therefore, to go all the way  back to Peshawar to get to my destination. I rode as fast as relays of  horses could carry me, in the hope that I should reach Bazidkhel in  time for the fun; but soon after passing Nowshera I heard guns in the  direction of the Kohat Pass, and realized that I should be too late.  I was very disappointed at missing this, my first chance of active  service, and not accompanying the newly raised Mountain Train (as it  was then called) on the first occasion of its being employed in the  field.    The object of this expedition was to punish the Jowaki section of the  Afridis for their many delinquencies during the three previous years.  Numerous murders and raids on the Kohat and Peshawar districts,  the plunder of boats on the Indus, and the murder of a European  apothecary, were all traced to this tribe. They had been blockaded,  and their resort to the salt-mines near Bahadurkhel and to the markets  of Kohat and Peshawar had been interdicted, but these measures  produced no effect on the recalcitrant tribesmen. John (afterwards  Lord) Lawrence, who had come to Peshawar for the purpose of taking (sic)  over frontier affairs with Edwardes, the new Commissioner, held a  conference with the _maliks_[7] of the villages connected with the  Jowaki Pass, and being anxious to avoid hostilities, offered to  condone all past offences if the tribes would agree to certain  conditions, which, briefly, were that no further crimes should be  committed in British territory; that such criminals as had taken  refuge in their villages should be given up; and that for the future  criminals and outlaws flying from justice should not be afforded  an asylum in Jowaki lands. To the second condition the whole tribe  absolutely refused to agree. They stated, with truth, that from time  immemorial it was their custom to afford an asylum to anyone demanding  it, and that to surrender a man who had sought and found shelter with  them would be a disgrace which they could not endure.    Afridis have curious ideas as to the laws of hospitality; it is no  uncommon thing for them to murder their guests in cold blood, but it  is contrary to their code of honour to surrender a fugitive who has  claimed an asylum with them.    The sections of the tribe living nearest our territory agreed to the  first and third of our conditions, no doubt because they felt they  were in our power, and had suffered considerably from the blockade.  But the Bori Afridis would make no atonement for the past and give  no security for the future, although they admitted having robbed and  murdered our subjects. There was nothing for it, therefore, but to  send a force against them. This force consisted of rather more than  1,500 men, British and Native. The Afridis made no stand until we  reached their main position, when they offered a stout resistance,  which, however, proved of no avail against the gallantry of the Guides  and 66th (now 1st) Gurkhas. The Bori villages were then destroyed,  with a loss to us of eight men killed and thirty-one wounded.    Sufficient punishment having been inflicted, our force retired. The  rear-guard was hotly pressed,"]]]
