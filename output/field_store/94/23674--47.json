A step in advance, easily  and soon taken, was the additional smoothing of the vessel by slightly  wetting and rubbing its outer surface. Even this was productive only  of a moderately smooth surface, since, as learned by the Indian  potters long before, in their experience with the clay-plastered  parching-tray, it was necessary to mix the clay of vessels with a  tempering of sand, crushed potsherds, or the like, to prevent it from  cracking while drying; this, of course, no amount of rubbing would  remove. Hence, by another easy step, clay unmixed with a  grit-tempering, made into a thin paste with water, and thickly applied  to the half-dried jar with a dab or brash of soft fiber, gave a  beautifully smooth surface, especially if polished afterward by  rubbing with water-worn pebbles. The vessel thus prepared, when  burned, assumed invariably a creamy, pure white, red-brown or, other  color, according to the quality or kind of the clay used in making the  paste with which it had been smoothed or washed.    Thus was achieved the art of producing at will fictiles of different  colors, with which simple suggestion painting also became easy. Black,  aside from clay paste, was almost the first pigment discovered; quite  likely because the mineral blacks from iron ores, coal, and the  various rocks used universally among Indians for staining splints,  etc., would be the earliest tried, and then adopted, as they remained  unchanged by firing. Thus it came about, as evidenced by the sequence  of early remains in the Southwest, that the white and black varieties  of pottery were the first made, then the red and black, and later the  red with white and black decoration. Take, as an example, the latter.  Of course it was a simple mode to employ the red (ocherous) clay for  the wash, the blue clay (which burned white) for the white pigment in  making lines, and any of the black minerals above mentioned for other  marking.    In these earliest kinds of painted pottery the angular decorations of  the corrugated ware or of basketry were repeated, or at the farthest  only elaborated, although on some specimens the suggestions of the  curved ornament already occurred. These resulted, I may not fear to  claim, from carelessness or awkwardness in drawing, for instance, the  corners of acute angles, which, \"cutting across-lot\" would, it may be  seen, produce the wavy or meandering line from the zigzag, the  ellipsoid from the rectangle, and so on.    Precisely in accordance with this theory were the studies of my  preceptor, the lamented Prof. Charles Fred. Hartt. In a paper \"On  Evolution in Ornament,\" published in several periodicals, among them  the Popular Science Monthly of January, 1875, this gifted naturalist  illustrated his studies by actual examples found on decorated burial  urns from Marajo Island. I must take the liberty of suggesting,  however, that upon some antecedent kind of vessel, the eyes of the  Amazonian Islanders may have been, to give Professor Hartt's idea,  \"trained to take physiological and aesthetic delight in regularly  recurring lines and dots\"; not on the pottery itself, as he seemed to  think, for decoration was old in basketry and the textiles when  pottery was first made.          DECORATIVE SYMBOLISM.      [Illustration: FIG. 545.--Food-bowl.  FIG. 546.--Water-jar.                 (Showing open or joined space in line near rim.)]    On every class of food- and water-vessels, in collections of both  ancient and modern Pueblo pottery (except, it is important to note, on  pitchers and some sacred receptacles), it may be observed as a  singular, yet almost constant feature, that encircling lines, often  even ornamental zones, are left open or not as it were closed at the  ends. (See Figs. 545, _a_, 546, _a_.) This is clearly a conventional  quality and seemingly of intentional significance. An explanation must  be sought in various directions, and once found will be useful in  guiding to an understanding of the symbolic element in Pueblo ceramic  art. I asked the Indian women, when I saw them making these little  spaces with great care, why they took so much pains to leave them  open. They replied that to close them was _a'k ta ni_, \"fearful!\"--that  this little space through the line or zone on a vessel was the \"exit  trail of life or being\", _o' ne yaethl kwai na_, and this was all. How  it came to be first left open and why regarded as the \"exit trail,\"  they could not tell. If one studies the mythology of this people and  their ways of thinking, then watches them closely, he will, however,  get other clews. When a woman has made a vessel, dried, polished, and  painted it, she will tell you with an air of relief that it is a \"Made  Being.\" Her statement is confirmed as a sort of article of faith, when  you observe that as she places the vessel in the kiln, she also places  in and beside it food. Evidently she vaguely gives something about the  vessel a personal existence. The question arises how did these people  come to regard food-receptacles or water-receptacles as possessed of  or accompanied by conscious existences. I have found that the Zuni  argues actual and essential relationship from similarity in the  appearance, function, or other attributes of even generically diverse  things.[2]       [2] I would refer those, who may wish to find this characteristic     more fully set forth, to the introductory pages of my essay on     Zuni Fetiches, published in the second volume of Contributions to     North American Ethnology by the Bureau of Ethnology; also to a     paper read before the American Academy of Sciences on the     Relations to one another of the Zuni Mythologic and Sociologic     Systems, published, I regret to say, without my revision, in the     Popular Science Monthly, for July, 1882.    I here allude to this mental bias because it has both influenced the  decoration of pottery and has been itself influenced by it. In the  first place, the noise made by a pot when struck or when simmering on  the fire is supposed to be the voice of its associated being. The  clang of a pot when it breaks or suddenly cracks in burning is the cry  of this being as it escapes or separates from the vessel. That it has  departed is argued from the fact that the vase when cracked or  fragmentary never resounds as it did when whole. This vague existence  never cries out violently unprovoked; but it is supposed to acquire  the power of doing so by imitation; hence, no one sings, whistles, or  makes other strange or musical sounds resembling those of earthenware  under the circumstances above described during the smoothing,  polishing, painting, or other processes of finishing. The being thus  incited, they think, would surely strive to come out, and would break  the vessel in so doing. In this we find a partial explanation of the  native belief that a pot is accompanied by a conscious existence. The  rest of the solution of this problem in belief is involved in the  native philosophy and worship of water. Water contains the source of  continued life. The vessel holds the water; the source of life  _accompanies_ the water, hence its dwelling place is in the vessel  with the water. Finally, the vessel is supposed to contain the  treasured source, irrespective of the water--as do wells and springs,  or even the places where they have been. If the encircling lines  inside of the eating bowl, _outside_ of the water jar, were closed,  there would be no exit trail for this invisible source of life or for  its influence or breath. Yet, why, it maybe asked, must the source of  life or its influence be provided with a trail by which to pass out  from the vessel? In reply to this I will submit two considerations. It  has been stated that on the earliest Southwestern potteries decoration  was effected by incised or raised ornamentation. Any one who has often  attempted to make vessels according to primitive methods as I have has  found how difficult it is to smoothly join a line incised around a  still soft clay pot, and that this difficulty is even greater when the  ornamental band is laid on in relief. It would be a natural outgrowth  of this predicament to leave the ends unjoined, which indeed the  savage often did. When paint instead of incision or relief came to be  the decorative agent, the lines or bands would be left unjoined in  imitation. As those acquainted with Tylor's \"Early History\" will  realize, and myth of observation like the above would come to be  assigned in after ages. This may or may not be true of the case in  question; for, as before observed, some classes of sacred receptacles,  as well as the most ancient painted bowls, are not characterized by  the unjoined lines. Whether true or not, it is an insufficient  solution of the problem.    [Illustration: FIG. 547.--Conical or flat-bellied canteen.]    It is natural for the Pueblo to consider water as the prime source of  life, or as accompanied by it, for without the presence of living  water very few things grow in his desert land. During many a drought  chronicled in his oral annals, plants, animals, and men have died as  of a contagious scourge. Naturally, therefore, he has come to regard  water as the milk of adults, to speak of it as such, and as the  all-sufficient nourishment which the earth (in his conception of it as  the mother of men) yields. In the times when his was a race of cliff  and mesa dwellers, the most common vessel appertaining to his daily  life was the flat-bellied canteen or water-carrier. (See Fig. 547.)  This was suspended by a band across the forehead, so as to hang  against the back, thus leaving the hands as well as the feet free for  assistance in climbing. It now survives only for use on long journeys  or at camps distant from water. The original suggestion of its form  seems to have been that of the human mammary gland, or perhaps its  peculiar form may have suggested a relationship "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17186"],[0,"No√ß√µes elementares de archeologia (#8)"],[1,"       |at√© duas                               |  |      {   {          {             |                                       |  |    I { M {          {para roj√µes  |Dardos quasi similhantes aos           |  |    N {   {          {             |precedentes, porem mais sobre o        |  |    S {   {          {             |comprido.                              |  |    T {   {                        |                                       |  |    R { P { Martellos              |Pe√ßa quer redonda dos dois lados, quer |  |    U { E {                        |d'um lado s√≥mente.                     |  |    M { D {                        |                                       |  |    E { R { Pedras para fundas     |Redondas ou ovoides, de 2 a 3 polegadas|  |    N { A {                        |de diametro.                           |  |    T {   {                        |                                       |  |    O {   { Machados               |Convexos para o centro, cortados em    |  |    S {   {                        |aresta viva nos bordos, acabando de um |  |      {   {                        |lado em ponta romba, e de outro em     |  |      {   {                        |gume, o qual descreve uma por√ß√£o de    |  |      {   {                        |ellipse.                               |  |    D {                            |                                       |  |    I {   { Machados               |De formas diversas similhando-se mais  |  |    V {   {                        |ou menos a uma cunha.                  |  |    E {   {                        |                                       |  |    R { E { F√¥rmas para machados   |S√£o duas pe√ßas symetricas, que depois  |  |    S { M {                        |de reunidas a parte √¥cca mostra o      |  |    O {   {                        |feitio do machado.                     |  |    S {   {                        |                                       |  |      { B { Espadas                |Folhas direitas, chatas, de dois gumes,|  |      { R {                        |acabando em ponta.                     |  |      { O {                        |                                       |  |      { N { Punhaes                |Quasi similhante √°s espadas na forma,  |  |      { Z {                        |por√©m com menor comprimento.           |  |      { E {                        |                                       |  |      {   { Cabe√ßas de roj√µes      |De forma lanceolada tendo um           |  |      {   {                        |engrossamento no meio.                 |  |                                   |                                       |  |         { compostas de pe√ßas      |Correntes metallicas.--Perolas de pedra|  |         {                         |de c√¥r-alambre, formando rosario.      |  |_Torques_{                         |                                       |  |         { de uma s√≥ pe√ßa          |Argolas metallicas mais ou menos       |  |         {                         |grossas muitas vezes com               |  |         {                         |lavrados.--Chapas do feitio de meia    |  |         {                         |lua.                                   |  |                                   |                                       |  |Ornamentos diversos                |Em bronze e em ouro, com lavrados.     |  |                                   |                                       |  |Lou√ßa de barro                     |Muito fragil, mal cozida, composta de  |  |                                   |terra preta mal preparada e cheia de   |  |                                   |pequeninos seixos.                     |  |                                   |                                       |  |Moedas                             |Em ouro, em prata e em bronze.         |  +-----------------------------------+---------------------------------------+          CAPITULO II    *Era gallo-romana*      Entreapparece-nos um dos mais amplos horisontes da historia dos povos  occidentaes na conquista do imperador romano Cesar. Nos _Commentarios_  d'este grande general temos perfeita id√©a do estado da Gallia na √©poca  da conquista; conhecem-se tanto os grandes factos que consumou, quanto  se inferem as consequencias que d'elles advieram √° civilisa√ß√£o.    Cesar encontrou a Gallia dividida em tres na√ß√µes principaes: os Belgas,  os Celtas e os Aquitanios.    O imperador Augusto, que pretendeu organisar o governo regular nos  paizes conquistados, formou tres novas provincias d'essas tres regi√µes.    Segundo esta divis√£o, foram desannexados e encorporados na Aquitania 14  povos da Celtica; al√©m de dois que passaram do Norte para a Belgica.  Assim ficou modificado o territorio dos primitivos povos d'esta parte da  Europa.      *Vias de communica√ß√£o*    Come√ßaremos a nossa revista dos monumentos da grande √©poca romana,  descrevendo as vias publicas ou as grandes estradas; tanto mais que  foram as primeiras obras que o povo rei executou e de que nos deixou  vestigios.    As cidades e as estancias eram accessiveis por meio de estradas solidas,  ou cal√ßadas. Nos intervallos que separavam estes estabelecimentos uns  dos outros, √© que principalmente se encontravam vestigios das vias  romanas. Seguiam em geral linhas rectas, excepto quando obstaculos  naturaes, como as montanhas, os barrancos profundos, as lag√¥as, se  oppunham a isso, e prolongavam-se tanto quanto possivel nas planicies,  afim de evitar os terrenos pantanosos.    Al√©m das estradas principaes, que communicavam uma cidade com outra,  havia os caminhos vicinaes, _viae vicinales_, que conduziam √°s aldeias,  e estabeleciam rela√ß√µes entre estas e as cidades. N√£o eram alinhados  como as primeiras, nem feitos com egual esmero.    Nas estradas mais bem executadas, a primeira camada, ou a mais funda,  compunha-se de pedras collocadas em raso, √°s vezes assentes com  argamassa, mas em geral postas simplesmente umas sobre as outras: era o  que chamavam _statumen_. Em algumas vias, as pedras do _statumen_ eram  postas de cutello e com inclina√ß√£o, como explicaremos quando fallarmos  das paredes construidas em espinha de peixe.    A largura ordinaria das vias romanas era de 15 a 20 p√©s. As bordas das  partes alteadas n√£o se conservam em muitas localidades; arruinaram-se  por modo que n√£o apresentam hoje sufficiente largura para um carro poder  passar; e em certos pontos aproximam-se mais de um f√¥sso, que de uma  estrada.    Os caminhos romanos atravessavam os rios sobre pontes, e vaus cal√ßados.  Em grande numero de localidades, encontram-se os alicerces das pontes,  ou dos vaus, debaixo da agua, seguindo a directriz das antigas vias. Em  certos casos o trilho era estabelecido sobre travessas de madeira.    _Columnas itinerarias_.--Os caminhos romanos eram divididos por marcos  situados em espa√ßos regulares, e com inscrip√ß√µes que indicavam o numero  de leguas ou de milhas, comprehendido entre as diversas povoa√ß√µes.    As capitaes serviam de ponto central para marcar as distancias em todo o  territorio.    _Os marcos milliares_ tinham 5 a 6 p√©s de altura; eram de f√≥rma  cylindrica; chamavam-se milliares, _milliaria_, ou simplesmente  _lapidas_.    D'aqui provem as phrases t√£o frequentes nos auctores antigos, _ad  primum_, _secundum_, _tertium lapidem_, a primeira, a segunda e a  terceira pedra, ou s√≥ _ad primum_, _secundum_, _tertium_, etc. ficando  subentendido _lapidem_ ou _milliarium_.    A segunda camada, chamada _ruderatio_, era formada de pedras britadas de  dimens√£o menor que as anteriores.    A terceira camada, _nucleus_, compunha-se, ora de cal misturada com  fragmentos de telha pisados, ora de areia misturada com argila.    [Figura 26: Columna milliar que existe em Fran√ßa]    Seixos inteiros, apertados uns contra os outros, ou postos simplesmente  em leito de areia grossa, _glarea_, formavam a quarta e ultima camada,  chamada _summa crusta_.    Era excepcionalmente nas cidades, aldeias ou nos paizes pantanosos, que  formavam a _summa crusta_ com cal√ßada de pedras cubicas ou polygonaes  irregulares.    Em geral, serviam-se para estes trabalhos dos materiaes que encontravam  na localidade, ou a pequena distancia; s√≥mente os mandavam buscar mais  longe quando eram de m√° qualidade no terreno das obras.    Em muitas partes, as vias antigas foram alteadas do solo, e um _agger_  servia de base √° cal√ßada. Estes _caminhos alteados_ conservam ainda o  seu nivel superior em espa√ßos muito extensos, e s√£o faceis de  reconhecer.    As estradas antigas eram tambem cavadas, como se as preparassem para o  leito de um rio. As excava√ß√µes em algumas partes podiam ser consequencia  do uso prolongado de viandantes e vechiculos; por√©m, em outras, foi  visivelmente praticado com o fim de tornar mais suaves as subidas muito  ingremes.    [Figura 27: Torre de Pirelonge]    O uso das columnas milliares data do anno 183 antes da era christ√£. Foi  determinado em lei proposta por C.S. Graccho, e depois ampliada √°s  provincias do imperio.    As inscrip√ß√µes collocadas n'estas columnas foram primitivamente  laconicas; indicavam apenas o numero de milhas comprehendidas de uma a  outra localidade. Augusto foi o primeiro que mandou gravar os seus nomes  e qualifica√ß√µes nos marcos levantados por sua ordem, e os successores  seguiram-lhe o exemplo.    _Pyramides_.--As vias romanas n√£o eram s√≥mente guarnecidas pelas  columnas itinerarias; aos seus lados viam-se tambem torres massi√ßas, ou  pyramides, ora circulares, ora quadradas.[10]    Consideravam-se essas pyramides como tumulos; mas a maior parte parecia  terem sido levantadas para ornar os caminhos, ou antes dedicadas a  Mercurio, como deus protector das estradas, das artes, e do commercio.  Em algumas d'ellas abriam especies de nichos que deviam receber a  estatua de Deus.    Formavam-se taes construc√ß√µes de bases quadradas de alvenaria, que  sustentavam uma serie de grandes pedras de cantaria; o remate  apresentava a configura√ß√£o conica, tendo a superficie"]]]
