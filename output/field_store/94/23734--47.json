It is the result of the stern curse  denounced upon the king by the father of the ascetic whom the king,  hunting in his youthful days, had accidentally slain.    Rama fixes his residence at Panchavati. Maricha, a Rakshasa, now appears  as a deer. The supposed animal is chased by Rama and Lakshmana at Sita's  request.    Ravana then comes disguised to see Sita. He mutters, \"pious dame! Give  me food.\" She heedlessly oversteps the magic ring traced by Lakshmana,  when the Rakshasa seizes her by the hand stretched in charity. She calls  in vain the sons of Raghu. Jatayu, the vulture, endeavours to rescue  her, but is slain. She encounters Hanuman, the chief Counsellor of  Sugriva, the dethroned king of the Monkeys, and begs him to carry her  ornaments, which she casts to him, to Rama.    Having slain the deer, the prince, with his brave brother, returns to  their bower. He seeks Sita, but seeks in vain. His steps tread three  several quarters, the fourth he leaves, overcome with grief and terror,  unexplored.    Rama prosecutes his search after Sita. He fights with Bali, the king of  the Monkeys, and triumphs over him.    He now despatches Hanuman to Lanka, Hanuman pays a visit to Sita.    He performs various feats at Lanka and returns to Rama whose hosts now  advance towards Lanka.    Vibhishana, the brother of Ravana, expostulates with his royal brother,  but in vain. Consequently he deserts the king and goes over to Rama.    The Monkeys advance further towards Lanka.    A bridge is built over the sea.    The troops cross over it.    Where first the Monkey bands advance, they view a watery belt smoothly  circling round the shore: the following troops plough their way through  the thick mire with labour; the chief who leads the rear, filled with  wonder, exclaims, \"Here is Ocean.\"    Rama now sends Angada, the son of Bali, to persuade Ravana to relinquish  Sita peaceably. Angada has some feeling of aversion to Rama, who killed  his father, but thinks he shall best fulfil his father's wishes by  promoting the war between Ravana and Rama; he therefore goes to Ravana  and defies him in very haughty terms.    Ravana says:--    \"Indra, the king of the gods, weaves garlands for me; the thousand-rayed  or the Sun keeps watch at my gate; above my head Chandra or the Moon  uprears the umbrella of dominion; the wind's and the ocean's monarchs  are my slaves; and for my board the fiery godhead toils. Knowest thou  not this, and canst thou stoop to praise the son of Raghu, whose frail  mortal body is but a meal to any of my households?\"    Angada laughs and observes:--\"Is this thy wisdom, Ravana? Infirm of  judgement dost thou deem of Rama thus--a mortal man? Then Ganga merely  flows a watery stream; the elephants that bear the skies, and Indra's  steed, are brutal forms; the charms of Rembha are the fleeting beauties  of earth's weak daughters, and the golden age, a term of years. Love is  a petty archer; the mighty Hanuman, in thy proud discernment, is an  ape.\"    Angada, having in vain endeavoured to persuade Ravana to restore Sita,  leaves him to expect the immediate advance of the Monkey host.    Virupaksha and Mahodara, two of Ravana's ministers utter a string of  moral and political sentences.    Ravana is not to be persuaded, but goes to Sita to try the effect of his  personal solicitations--first endeavouring to deceive her by two  fictitious heads, made to assume the likenesses of Rama and Lakshmana.  Sita's lamentations are stopped by a heavenly monitor, who tells her  that the heads are the work of magic and they instantly disappear.  Ravana then vaunts his prowess in war and love, and approaches Sita to  embrace her. She exclaims \"Forbear, forbear! proud fiend, the jetty arms  of my loved lord, or thy relentless sword, alone shall touch my neck.\"    Thus repulsed, Ravana withdraws, and presently reappears as Rama, with  his own ten heads in his hands. Sita, thinking him to be what he  appears, is about to embrace him, when the secret virtue of her  character as a faithful wife detects the imposition, and reveals the  truth to her. Ravana, baffled and mortified, is compelled to relinquish  his design. Sita's apprehensions, lest she should be again beguiled, are  allayed by a voice from heaven, which announces that she will not see  the real Rama until he has beheld Mandodari kiss the dead body of her  husband Ravana.    A female Rakhasi attempts to assassinate Rama, but is stopped and slain  by Angada. The army then advances to Lanka, and Ravana comes forth to  meet it. Kumbhakarna, his gigantic and sleepy brother, is disturbed from  his repose to combat. He is rather out of humour at first, and  recommends Ravana to give up the lady, observing: \"Though the commands  of royalty pervade the world, yet sovereigns ever should remember, the  light of justice must direct their path.\" Ravana answers:--    \"They who assist us with a holy text are but indifferent friends. These  arms have wrested victory from the opposing grasp of gods and demons.  Confiding in thy prowess, sure in thee to triumph over my foes, I have  relaxed their fibre, but again their nerves are braced, I need thee not;  hence to thy cell and sleep.\" Kumbhakarna replies:--\"King, do not  grieve, but like a valiant chief, pluck from thy heart all terror of  thine enemies, and only deem of thy propitious fortunes, or who shall  foremost plunge into the fight----I will not quit thee.\"    Kumbhakarna's advance terrifies Rama's troops, whom the Kshatriya hero  addresses thus:    \"Ho! chiefs and heroes, why this groundless panic, the prowess of our  enemy untried in closer conflict? Ocean's myriad fry would drain the  fountain, and before the swarm of hostile gnats the mighty lion falls.\"  Kumbhakarna is killed by Rama; on which Indrajit, a son of Ravana,  proceeds against the brethren. By the arrow called _Nagapasa_,  presented him by Brahma, he casts Rama and Lakshmana senseless on the  ground, and then goes to Nikumbhila mountain to obtain a magic car by  means of sacrifice. Hanumana disturbs his rites.    Rama and Lakshmana revive, and on being sprinkled with drops of amrita  brought by Garura, the latter with a shaft decapitates Meghnada, and  tosses the head into the hands of his father Ravana.    Ravana levels a shaft at Lakshmana, given him by Brahma, and charged  with the certain fate of one hero. Hanumana snatches it away, after it  has struck Lakshmana, before it does mischief. Ravana reproaches Brahma,  and he sends Nareda to procure the dart again and keep Hanumana out of  the way. With the fatal weapon Lakshmana is left for dead. Rama  despairs:--    \"My soldiers shall find protection in their caves; I can die with Sita,  but thou, Vibhishana, what shall become of thee?\"    Hanuman reappears and encourages him. Ravana has a celebrated physician,  Sushena, who is brought away from Lanka in his sleep, and directs that a  drug (_Vishalya_) from the Druhima mountain must be procured before  morning, or Lakshmana will perish. This mountain is six millions of  _Yojanas_ remote, but Hanuman undertakes to bring it bodily to Lanka,  and call at Ayodhya on his way.    He accordingly roots up the mountain, and is returning with it to Rama,  via Ayodhya, when Bharata, who is employed in guarding a sacrifice made  by Vasishtha, not knowing what to make of him, shoots Hanuman as he  approaches. He falls exclaiming on Rama and Lakshmana, which leads  Bharata to discover his mistake. Vasishtha restores the monkey who sets  off for Lanka. On Hanuman's return, the medicament is administered, and  Lakshman revives.    An ambassador from Ravana comes and offers to give up Sita for the  battle-axe of Parasurama, but this, Rama replies, must be reserved for  Indra. On this refusal, Ravana goes forth after a brief dialogue with  his queen Mandodari, who animates his drooping courage with the true  spirit of the tribe to which she belongs.    \"Banish your sorrow, lord of Lanka, take one long and last embrace. We  meet no more. Or give command, and by your side I march fearless to  fight, for I too am a Kshatriya.\" The progress of Ravana through the air  appals all Nature. The winds breathe low in timid murmurs through the  rustling woods; the sun with slackened fires gleams pale abroad and the  streams, relaxing from their rapid course, slowly creep along. Ravana  defies Rama with great disdain and in derision of his modest demeanour,  asks him whether he is not overcome with shame by the recollection of  his ancestor, Anaranya, killed formerly by Ravana.    Rama replies:--    \"I am not ashamed my noble ancestor fell in the combat. The warrior  seeks victory or death, and death is not disgrace. It ill befits thee to  revile his fame. When vanquished, thou couldst drag out an abject life  in great Haihaya's dungeons, till thy sire begged thee to freedom, as a  matter of charity. For thee alone I blush, unworthy of my triumph.\"    Ravana falls under the arrows of Rama. The heads, that once, sustained  on Siva's breast, shone with heavenly splendour, now lie beneath the  vulture's talons. Mandodari bewails the death of her husband. Sita is  recovered, but Rama is rather shy of his bride, until her purity is  established by her passing through the fiery ordeal: a test she  successfully undergoes. Rama returns with Sita and his friends to  Ayodhya, when Angada challenges them all to fight him, as it is now time  to revenge his father's death. A voice from heaven, however, tells him  to be pacified, as Bali will be born as hunter in a future age, and kill  Rama, who will then be Krishna: he is accordingly appeased. Rama is now  seated on the throne of Ayodhya. After some time, he orders the exile of  Sita.          ANERGHA RAGHAVA OR MURARI NATAKA.      The sage Viswamitra comes to Dasaratha, the king of Ayodhya, to request  the aid of his eldest son Rama.

En el Cabo de Matas es peligrosa la navegacion de noche en la cercania  de la tierra, á causa de las islas, que salen mucho al mar, y la de mas  afuera es la mas baja. Tambien es poco segura la costa desde la isla de  los Reyes hasta San Julian, por lo cual conviene en esta altura navegar  á buena distancia de tierra.    Los vientos que corren en estos mares, en el verano y estio, son nortes,  nord-oestes, oestes y sud-oestes. Los estes y sud-estes, que serian los  mas nocivos, no reinan en este tiempo. De los sobredichos, los  sud-oestes levantan mucha mar, y son casi ciertos en las conjunciones,  oposiciones y cuartos de luna. Las mareas incomodan mucho la navegacion  por la costa: en algunas partes sube y baja seis brazas perpendiculars,  causando este flujo y reflujo mucha diversidad de corrientes, que unas  veces corren á lo largo de la costa, y unas al norte y otras al sur, y  tal vez encontrándose unas con otras, corren hácia el este y el sud  este.    Los puertos son muy pocos: solamente en el Puerto Deseado, en San Julian  y en la bahia de San Gregorio se halla abrigo para los navios. En el  Puerto Deseado hay una fuente, de la cual en caso de necesidad pueden  hacer aguada los navios. Todo lo restante de la costa está seco y árido,  que no se vé un árbol, ni hay donde se pueda hacer leña gruesa: de  algunos matorrales se puede hacer algun poco en la bahia de San Julian,  en donde se hallará tambien mucha pesca y abundancia de sal.    En tiempo de verano se siente algo de frio; pero en el invierno no puede  menos de ser excesivo, á causa de las muchas nieves que caen en las  cordilleras. Estas no fecundan la tierra, antes la dejan tan seca y  esteril que parece incapaz de producir fruto alguno. Toda la costa  parece que está desierta, ni hay indios en parte alguna cerca del mar,  desde el Cabo de San Antonio al Cabo de las Vírgenes: porque siendo la  tierra de la costa salitrosa é infructífera, no tienen de que  mantenerse; y si en alguna parte los hubiera, hubieran estos navegantes  visto algunos fuegos, ó humaderas en las partes donde surgieron y  saltaron en tierra. Por tanto parece que los indios viven muy tierra  adentro hácia la falda de la Cordillera de Chile.    Hánse descubierto con este viage y registro varias falsedades que tienen  los derroteros de algunos viageros extrangeros, porque en cuanto á los  rios que ellos señalan, se ha visto ahora que son imaginarios, y que á  lo mas solo debe de correr agua por ellos en tiempo de lluvias y nieves:  con que queda claro, que desde el rio del Sauce, que es el que otros  llaman _el Desaguadero_, no hay ningun otro rio hasta el estrecho de  Magallanes. Los extrangeros no parece que fueron de propósito á  registrar costas, como estos nuestros españoles, y así dijeron aquellos  lo que desde lejos les pareció. Pudiera ser que á los españoles se les  hubiera ocultado alguno, aunque han puesto sumo cuidado, porque es cosa  dificil verlo todo desde el navio, entre peñascos, quebradas y bancos;  pero parece han hecho cuanta diligencia cabe, y que en los parages donde  pararon, saltaron á tierra, é hicieron registro, no hay duda que han  hallado fabulosos los rios que otros señalaban, y varias otras cosas que  por sus diarios nos habian hecho creer los dichos extrangeros.    Tal parece lo que dicen, que se encontraron en las cuestas altas del  Puerto Deseado sepulcros de gigantes, cuyos huesos eran de once pies de  largo: porque los huesos de los cadáveres que ahora se encontraron, eran  de estatura ordinaria. Añaden dichos diarios extrangeros, que en una  ensenada del Puerto Deseado, que señalan en sus mapas, hay mucha pesca.  Nuestros españoles se pusieron allí á pescar y no hallaron cosa alguna.  Cuentan tambien los diarios extrangeros, que en San Julian hay  megillones, ú ostiones de once palmos de diámetro; y despues de  registrar tanto nuestros españoles, no han hallado mas que lo dicho en  la descripcion, puesta arriba, de la bahia de San Julian.           *       *       *       *       *"]]]
