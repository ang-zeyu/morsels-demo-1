Gillis got some heavy paper out of a closet and packaged  it, then hunted through a card-file in the top drawer of the desk, until  he found the card he wanted. He made a few notes on it, and was still  holding it and the sixty dollars when he rejoined Rand by the fire.    In spite of his effeminate appearance and over-refined manner, the young  fellow really knew arms. The conversation passed from Confederate  revolvers to the arms of the Civil War in general, and they were  discussing the changes in tactics occasioned by the introduction of the  revolver and the repeating carbine when the door from the house opened  and Arnold Rivers appeared on the landing.    He looked older than when Rand had last seen him. His hair was thinner on  top and grayer at the temples. Never particularly robust, he had lost  weight, and his face was thinner and more hollow-cheeked. His mouth still  had the old curve of supercilious insolence, and he was still smoking  with the six-inch carved ivory cigarette-holder which Rand remembered.    He looked his visitor over carefully from the doorway, decided that he  was not soliciting magazine subscriptions or selling Fuller brushes, and  came down the steps. As he did, he must have recognized Rand; he shifted  the cigarette-holder to his left hand and extended his right.    \"Mr. Rand, isn't it?\" he asked. \"I thought I knew you. It's been some  years since you've been around here.\"    \"I've been a lot of places in the meantime,\" Rand said.    \"You were here last in October, '41, weren't you?\" Rivers thought for a  moment. \"You bought a Highlander, then. By Alexander Murdoch, of Doune,  wasn't it?\"    \"No; Andrew Strahan, of Edzel,\" Rand replied.    Rivers snapped his fingers. \"That's right! I sold both of those pistols  at about the same time; a gentleman in Chicago got the Murdoch. The  Strahan had a star-pierced lobe on the hammer. Did you ever get anybody  to translate the Gaelic inscription on the barrel?\"    \"You've a memory like Jim Farley,\" Rand flattered. \"The inscription was  the clan slogan of the Camerons; something like: _Sons of the hound, come  and get flesh!_ I won't attempt the original.\"    \"Mr. Rand just bought 6524, the Leech & Rigdon .36,\" Gillis interjected,  handing Rivers the card and the money. Rivers looked at both, saw how  much Rand had been taken for, and nodded.    \"A nice item,\" he faintly praised, as though anything selling for less  than a hundred dollars was so much garbage. \"Considering the condition in  which Confederate arms are usually found, it's really first-rate. I think  you'll like it, Mr. Rand.\"    The telephone rang, Cecil Gillis answered it, listened for a moment, and  then said: \"For you, Mr. Rivers; long distance from Milwaukee.\"    Rivers's face lit with the beatific smile of a cat at a promising  mouse-hole. \"Ah, excuse me, Mr. Rand.\" He crossed to the desk, picked  up the phone and spoke into it. \"This is Arnold Rivers,\" he said, much  as Edward Murrow used to say, _This--is London!_ The telephone sputtered  for a moment. \"Ah, yes indeed, Mr. Verral. Quite well, I thank you. And  you?... No, it hasn't been sold yet. Do you wish me to ship it to  you?... On approval; certainly.... Of course it's an original flintlock;  I didn't list it as re-altered, did I?... No, not at all; the only  replacement is the small spring inside the patchbox.... Yes, the rifling  is excellent.... Of course; I'll ship it at once.... Good-by, Mr.  Verral.\"    He hung up and turned to his hireling, fairly licking his chops.    \"Cecil, Mr. Verral, in Milwaukee, whose address we have, has just ordered  6288, the F. Zorger flintlock Kentuck. Will you please attend to it?\"    \"Right away, Mr. Rivers.\" Gillis went to one of the racks under the  windows and selected a long flintlock rifle, carrying it out the door at  the rear.    \"I issued a list, a few days ago,\" Rivers told Rand. \"When Cecil comes  back, I'll have him get you a copy. I've been receiving calls ever since;  this is the twelfth long-distance call since Tuesday.\"    \"Business must be good,\" Rand commented. \"I understand you've offered to  buy the Lane Fleming collection. For ten thousand dollars.\"    \"Where did you hear that?\" Rivers demanded, looking up from the drawer in  which he was filing the card on the Leech & Rigdon.    \"From Mrs. Fleming.\" Rand released a puff of pipe smoke and watched it  draw downward into the fireplace. \"I've been retained to handle the sale  of that collection; naturally, I'd know who was offering how much.\"    Rivers's eyes narrowed. He came around the desk, loading another  cigarette into his holder.    \"And just why, might I ask, did Mrs. Fleming think it in order to employ  a detective in a matter like that?\" he wanted to know.    Rand let out more smoke. \"She didn't. She employed an arms-expert, a  Colonel Jefferson Davis Rand, U.S.A., O.R.C., who is a well-known  contributor to the _American Rifleman_ and the _Infantry Journal_ and  _Antiques_ and the old _Gun Report_. You've read some of his articles,  I believe?\"    \"Then you're not making an investigation?\"    \"What in the world is there to investigate?\" Rand asked. \"I'm just  selling a lot of old pistols for the Fleming estate.\"    \"I thought Fred Dunmore was doing that.\"    \"So did Fred. You're both wrong, though. I am.\" He got out Goode's letter  of authorization and handed it to Rivers, who read it through twice  before handing it back. \"You see anything in that about Fred Dunmore,  or any of the other relatives-in-law?\" he asked.    \"Well, I didn't understand; I'm glad to know what the situation really  is.\" Rivers frowned. \"I thought you were making some kind of an  investigation, and as I'm the only party making any serious offer to buy  those pistols, I wanted to know what there was to investigate.\"    \"Do you consider ten thousand dollars to be a serious offer?\" Rand asked.  \"And aren't you forgetting Stephen Gresham and his friends?\"    \"Oh, those people!\" Rivers scoffed. \"Mr. Rand, you certainly don't expect  them to be able to handle anything like this, do you?\"    \"Well, the banks speak well of them,\" Rand replied. \"Some of them have  good listings in Dun & Bradstreet's, too.\"    \"Well, so do I,\" Rivers reported. \"I can top any offer that crowd makes.  What do you expect to get out of them, anyhow?\"    \"I haven't talked price with them, yet. A lot more than ten thousand  dollars, anyhow.\"    Rivers forced a laugh. \"Now, Mr. Rand! That was just an opening offer. I  thought Fred Dunmore was handling the collection.\" He grimaced. \"What do  you think it's really worth?\"    Rand shrugged. \"It probably has a dealer's piece-by-piece list-value  of around seventy thousand. I'm not nuts enough to expect anything like  that in a lump sum, but please, let's not mention ten thousand dollars in  this connection any more. That's on the order of Lawyer Marks bidding  seventy-five cents for Uncle Tom; it's only good for laughs.\"    \"Well, how much more than that do you think Gresham and his crowd will  offer?\"    \"I haven't talked price with them, yet,\" Rand repeated. \"I mean to, as  soon as I can.\"    \"Well, you get their offer, and I'll top it,\" Rivers declared. \"I'm  willing to go as high as twenty-five thousand for that collection; they  won't go that high.\"    Although he just managed not to show it, Rand was really surprised. Even  a consciousness of abstracting had not prepared him for the shock of  hearing Arnold Rivers raise his own offer to something resembling an  acceptable figure. A good case, he reflected, could be made of that  for the actuality of miracles.    He rose, picking up his trench coat.    \"Well! That's something like it, now,\" he said. \"I'll see you later; I  don't know how long it's going to take me to get a list prepared, and  circularize the old-arms trade. I should hear from everybody who's  interested in a few weeks. You can be sure I'll keep your offer in mind.\"    He slipped into the coat and put on his hat, and then picked up the  package containing the Confederate revolver. Rivers had risen, too; he  was watching Rand nervously. When Rand tucked the package under his arm  and began drawing on his gloves, Rivers cleared his throat.    \"Mr. Rand, I'm dreadfully sorry,\" he began, \"but I'll have to return your  money and take back that revolver. It should not have been sold.\" He got  Rand's sixty dollars out of his pocket as though he expected it to catch  fire, and held it out.    Rand favored him with a display of pained surprise.    \"Why, I can't do that,\" he replied. \"I bought this revolver in good  faith, and you accepted payment and were satisfied with the transaction.  The sale's been made, now.\"    Rivers seemed distressed. It was probably the first time he had ever been  on the receiving end of that routine, and he didn't like it.    \"Now you're being unreasonable, Mr. Rand,\" he protested. \"Look here; I'll  give you seventy-five dollars' credit on anything else in the shop. You  certainly can't find fault with an offer like that.\"    \"I don't want anything else in the shop; I want this revolver you sold  me.\" Rand gave him a look of supercilious insolence that was at least a  two hundred per cent improvement on Rivers at his most insolent. \"You  know, I'll begin to acquire a poor idea of your business methods before  long,\" he added.    Rivers laughed ruefully. \"Well, to tell the truth, I just remembered a  customer of mine who specializes in Confederate arms, who would pay me at  least eighty for that item,\" he admitted. \"I thought...\"    Rand shook his head. \"I have a special fondness for Confederate arms,  myself. One of my grandfathers was in Mosby's Rangers, and the other was  with Barksdale, to say nothing of about a dozen great-uncles and so on.\"    \"Well, you're entirely within your rights, Mr. Rand,\" Rivers conceded. \"I  should apologize for trying to renege on a sale, but.... Well, I hope to  see you again, soon.\" He"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17897"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part I-II (Pars Prima Secundae) (#8)"],[1,"contrary,_ Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix, 26): \"As the soul  is the life of the body, so God is man's life of happiness: of Whom  it is written: 'Happy is that people whose God is the Lord' (Ps.  143:15).\"    _I answer that,_ It is impossible for any created good to constitute  man's happiness. For happiness is the perfect good, which lulls the  appetite altogether; else it would not be the last end, if something  yet remained to be desired. Now the object of the will, i.e. of man's  appetite, is the universal good; just as the object of the intellect  is the universal true. Hence it is evident that naught can lull man's  will, save the universal good. This is to be found, not in any  creature, but in God alone; because every creature has goodness by  participation. Wherefore God alone can satisfy the will of man,  according to the words of Ps. 102:5: \"Who satisfieth thy desire with  good things.\" Therefore God alone constitutes man's happiness.    Reply Obj. 1: The summit of man does indeed touch the base of the  angelic nature, by a kind of likeness; but man does not rest there as  in his last end, but reaches out to the universal fount itself of  good, which is the common object of happiness of all the blessed, as  being the infinite and perfect good.    Reply Obj. 2: If a whole be not the last end, but ordained to a  further end, then the last end of a part thereof is not the whole  itself, but something else. Now the universe of creatures, to which  man is compared as part to whole, is not the last end, but is  ordained to God, as to its last end. Therefore the last end of man is  not the good of the universe, but God himself.    Reply Obj. 3: Created good is not less than that good of which man is  capable, as of something intrinsic and inherent to him: but it is  less than the good of which he is capable, as of an object, and which  is infinite. And the participated good which is in an angel, and in  the whole universe, is a finite and restricted good.  ________________________    QUESTION 3    WHAT IS HAPPINESS  (In Eight Articles)    We have now to consider (1) what happiness is, and (2) what things  are required for it.    Concerning the first there are eight points of inquiry:    (1) Whether happiness is something uncreated?    (2) If it be something created, whether it is an operation?    (3) Whether it is an operation of the sensitive, or only of the  intellectual part?    (4) If it be an operation of the intellectual part, whether it is an  operation of the intellect, or of the will?    (5) If it be an operation of the intellect, whether it is an  operation of the speculative or of the practical intellect?    (6) If it be an operation of the speculative intellect, whether it  consists in the consideration of speculative sciences?    (7) Whether it consists in the consideration of separate substances  viz. angels?    (8) Whether it consists in the sole contemplation of God seen in His  Essence?  ________________________    FIRST ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 3, Art. 1]    Whether Happiness Is Something Uncreated?    Objection 1: It would seem that happiness is something uncreated. For  Boethius says (De Consol. iii): \"We must needs confess that God is  happiness itself.\"    Obj. 2: Further, happiness is the supreme good. But it belongs to God  to be the supreme good. Since, then, there are not several supreme  goods, it seems that happiness is the same as God.    Obj. 3: Further, happiness is the last end, to which man's will tends  naturally. But man's will should tend to nothing else as an end, but  to God, Who alone is to be enjoyed, as Augustine says (De Doctr.  Christ. i, 5, 22). Therefore happiness is the same as God.    _On the contrary,_ Nothing made is uncreated. But man's happiness is  something made; because according to Augustine (De Doctr. Christ. i,  3): \"Those things are to be enjoyed which make us happy.\" Therefore  happiness is not something uncreated.    _I answer that,_ As stated above (Q. 1, A. 8; Q. 2, A. 7), our end is  twofold. First, there is the thing itself which we desire to attain:  thus for the miser, the end is money. Secondly there is the  attainment or possession, the use or enjoyment of the thing desired;  thus we may say that the end of the miser is the possession of money;  and the end of the intemperate man is to enjoy something pleasurable.  In the first sense, then, man's last end is the uncreated good,  namely, God, Who alone by His infinite goodness can perfectly satisfy  man's will. But in the second way, man's last end is something  created, existing in him, and this is nothing else than the  attainment or enjoyment of the last end. Now the last end is called  happiness. If, therefore, we consider man's happiness in its cause or  object, then it is something uncreated; but if we consider it as to  the very essence of happiness, then it is something created.    Reply Obj. 1: God is happiness by His Essence: for He is happy not by  acquisition or participation of something else, but by His Essence.  On the other hand, men are happy, as Boethius says (De Consol. iii),  by participation; just as they are called \"gods,\" by participation.  And this participation of happiness, in respect of which man is said  to be happy, is something created.    Reply Obj. 2: Happiness is called man's supreme good, because it is  the attainment or enjoyment of the supreme good.    Reply Obj. 3: Happiness is said to be the last end, in the same way  as the attainment of the end is called the end.  ________________________    SECOND ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 3, Art. 2]    Whether Happiness Is an Operation?    Objection 1: It would seem that happiness is not an operation. For  the Apostle says (Rom. 6:22): \"You have your fruit unto  sanctification, and the end, life everlasting.\" But life is not an  operation, but the very being of living things. Therefore the last  end, which is happiness, is not an operation.    Obj. 2: Further, Boethius says (De Consol. iii) that happiness is \"a  state made perfect by the aggregate of all good things.\" But state  does not indicate operation. Therefore happiness is not an operation.    Obj. 3: Further, happiness signifies something existing in the happy  one: since it is man's final perfection. But the meaning of operation  does not imply anything existing in the operator, but rather  something proceeding therefrom. Therefore happiness is not an  operation.    Obj. 4: Further, happiness remains in the happy one. Now operation  does not remain, but passes. Therefore happiness is not an operation.    Obj. 5: Further, to one man there is one happiness. But operations  are many. Therefore happiness is not an operation.    Obj. 6: Further, happiness is in the happy one uninterruptedly. But  human operation is often interrupted; for instance, by sleep, or some  other occupation, or by cessation. Therefore happiness is not an  operation.    _On the contrary,_ The Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 13) that  \"happiness is an operation according to perfect virtue.\"    _I answer that,_ In so far as man's happiness is something created,  existing in him, we must needs say that it is an operation. For  happiness is man's supreme perfection. Now each thing is perfect in  so far as it is actual; since potentiality without act is imperfect.  Consequently happiness must consist in man's last act. But it is  evident that operation is the last act of the operator, wherefore the  Philosopher calls it \"second act\" (De Anima ii, 1): because that  which has a form can be potentially operating, just as he who knows  is potentially considering. And hence it is that in other things,  too, each one is said to be \"for its operation\" (De Coel ii, 3).  Therefore man's happiness must of necessity consist in an operation.    Reply Obj. 1: Life is taken in two senses. First for the very being  of the living. And thus happiness is not life: since it has been  shown (Q. 2, A. 5) that the being of a man, no matter in what it may  consist, is not that man's happiness; for of God alone is it true  that His Being is His Happiness. Secondly, life means the operation  of the living, by which operation the principle of life is made  actual: thus we speak of active and contemplative life, or of a life  of pleasure. And in this sense eternal life is said to be the last  end, as is clear from John 17:3: \"This is eternal life, that they may  know Thee, the only true God.\"    Reply Obj. 2: Boethius, in defining happiness, considered happiness  in general: for considered thus it is the perfect common good; and he  signified this by saying that happiness is \"a state made perfect by  the aggregate of all good things,\" thus implying that the state of a  happy man consists in possessing the perfect good. But Aristotle  expressed the very essence of happiness, showing by what man is  established in this state, and that it is by some kind of operation.  And so it is that he proves happiness to be \"the perfect good\"  (Ethic. i, 7).    Reply Obj. 3: As stated in _Metaph._ ix, 7 action is twofold. One  proceeds from the agent into outward matter, such as \"to burn\" and  \"to cut.\" And such an operation cannot be happiness: for such an  operation is an action and a perfection, not of the agent, but rather  of the patient, as is stated in the same passage. The other is an  action that remains in the agent, such as to feel, to understand, and  to will: and such an action is a perfection and an act of the agent.  And such an operation can be happiness.    Reply Obj. 4: Since happiness signifies some final perfection;  according as various things capable of happiness can attain to  various degrees of perfection, so must there be various meanings  applied to happiness. For in God there is happiness essentially;  since His very Being is His operation, whereby He enjoys no other  than Himself. In the happy angels, the final perfection is in respect  of some operation, by which they are united to the Uncreated Good:  and this"]]]
