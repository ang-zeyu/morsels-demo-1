[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16957"],[0,"Mr. Sponge's Sporting Tour (#8)"],[1,"  CHAPTER VI    LAVERICK WELLS      [Illustration]    The flattering accounts Mr. Sponge read in the papers of the distinguished  company assembled at Laverick Wells, together with details of the princely  magnificence of the wealthy commoner, Mr. Waffles, who appeared to  entertain all the world at dinner after each day's hunting made Mr. Sponge  think it would be a very likely place to suit him. Accordingly, thither he  despatched Mr. Leather with the redoubtable horses by the road, intending  to follow in as many hours by the rail as it took them days to trudge on  foot.    Railways have helped hunting as well as other things, and enables a man to  glide down into the grass 'sheers,' as Mr. Buckram calls them, with as  little trouble, and in as short a time almost, as it took him to accomplish  a meet at Croydon, or at the Magpies at Staines. But to our groom and  horses.    Mr. Sponge was too good a judge to disfigure the horses with the miserable,  pulpy, weather-bleached job-saddles and bridles of 'livery,' but had them  properly turned out with well-made, slightly-worn London ones of his own,  and nice, warm brown woollen rugs, below broadly bound,  blue-and-white-striped sheeting, with richly braided lettering, and blue  and white cordings. A good saddle and bridle makes a difference of ten  pounds in the looks of almost any horse. There is no need because a man  rides a hack horse to proclaim it to all the world; a fact that few hack  horse letters seem to be aware of. Perhaps, indeed, they think to advertise  them by means of their inferior appointments.    Leather, too, did his best to keep up appearances, and turned out in a very  stud-groomish-looking, basket-button'd, brown cutaway, with a clean striped  vest, ample white cravat, drab breeches and boots, that looked as though  they had brushed through a few bullfinches; and so they had, but not with  Leather's legs in them, for he had bought them second-hand of a pad groom  in distress. His hands were encased in cat's-skin sable gloves, showing  that he was a gentleman who liked to be comfortable. Thus accoutred, he  rode down Broad Street at Laverick Wells, looking like a fine, faithful old  family servant, with a slight scorbutic affection of the nose. He had  everything correctly arranged in true sporting marching order. The  collar-shanks were neatly coiled under the headstalls, the clothing tightly  rolled and balanced above the little saddle-bags on the led horse, 'Multum  in Parvo's' back, with the story-telling whip sticking through the roller.    Leather arrived at Laverick Wells just as the first shades of a November  night were drawing on, and anxious mammas and careful _chaperons_ were  separating their fair charges from their respective admirers and the  dreaded night air, leaving the streets to the gaslight men and youths 'who  love the moon.' The girls having been withdrawn, licentious youths linked  arms, and bore down the broad _pave_, quizzing this person, laughing at  that, and staring the pin-stickers and straw-chippers out of countenance.    'Here's an arrival!' exclaimed one. 'Dash my buttons, who have we here?'  asked another, as Leather hove in sight. 'That's not a bad looking horse,'  observed a third. 'Bid him five pounds for it for me,' rejoined a fourth.    'I say, old Bardolph! who do them 'ere quadrupeds belong to?' asked one,  taking a scented cigar out of his mouth.    Leather, though as impudent a dog as any of them, and far more than a match  for the best of them at a tournament of slang, being on his preferment,  thought it best to be civil, and replied, with a touch of his hat, that  they were 'Mr. Sponge's.'    'Ah! old sponge biscuits!--I know him!' exclaimed a youth in a Tweed  wrapper. 'My father married his aunt. Give my love to him, and tell him to  breakfast with me at six in the morning--he! he! he!'    'I say, old boy, that copper-coloured quadruped hasn't got all his shoes on  before,' squeaked a childish voice, now raised for the first time.    'That's intended, gov'nor,' growled Leather, riding on, indignant at the  idea of any one attempting to 'sell him' with such an old stable joke. So  Leather passed on through the now splendidly lit up streets, the large  plate-glass windowed shops, radiant with gas, exhibiting rich,  many-coloured velvets, silver gauzes, ribbons without end, fancy flowers,  elegant shawls labelled 'Very chaste,' 'Patronized by Royalty,' 'Quite the  go!' and white kid-gloves in such profusion that there seemed to be a pair  for every person in the place.    Mr. Leather established himself at the 'Eclipse Livery and Bait Stables,'  in Pegasus Street, or Peg Street, as it is generally called, where he  enacted the character of stud-groom to perfection, doing nothing himself,  but seeing that others did his work, and strutting consequentially with the  corn-sieves at feeding time.    After Leather's long London experience, it is natural to suppose that he  would not be long in falling in with some old acquaintance at a place like  the 'Wells,' and the first night fortunately brought him in contact with a  couple of grooms who had had the honour of his acquaintance when in all the  radiance of his glass-blown wigged prosperity as body-coachman to the Duke  of Dazzleton, and who knew nothing of the treadmill, or his subsequent  career. This introduction served with his own easy assurance, and the  deference country servants always pay to London ones, at once to give him  standing, and it is creditable to the etiquette of servitude to say, that  on joining the 'Mutton Chop and Mealy Potato Club,' at the Cat and  Bagpipes, on the second night after his arrival, the whole club rose to  receive him on entering, and placed him in the post of honour, on the right  of the president.    He was very soon quite at home with the whole of them, and ready to tell  anything he knew of the great families in which he had lived. Of course, he  abused the duke's place, and said he had been obliged to give him 'hup' at  last, 'bein' quite an unpossible man to live with; indeed, his only wonder  was, that he had been able to put hup with him so long.' The duchess was a  'good cretur,' he said, and, indeed, it was mainly on her account that he  stayed, but as to the duke, he was--everything that was bad, in short.    Mr. Sponge, on the other hand, had no reason to complain of the colours in  which his stud-groom painted him. Instead of being the shirtless strapper  of a couple of vicious hack hunters Leather made himself out to be the  general superintendent of the opulent owner of a large stud. The exact  number varied with the number of glasses of grog Leather had taken, but he  never had less than a dozen, and sometimes as many as twenty hunters under  his care. These, he said, were planted all over the kingdom; some at  Melton, to ''unt with the Quorn'; some at Northampton, to ''unt with the  Pytchley'; some at Lincoln, to ''unt with Lord 'Enry'; and some at Louth,  to ''unt with'--he didn't know who. What a fine flattering, well-spoken  world this is, when the speaker can raise his own consequence by our  elevation! One would think that 'envy, hatred, malice, and all  uncharitableness' had gone to California. A weak-minded man might have his  head turned by hearing the description given of him by his friends. But  hear the same party on the running-down tack!--when either his own  importance is not involved, or dire offence makes it worth his while 'to  cut off his nose to spite his face.' No one would recognize the portrait  then drawn as one of the same individual.    Mr. Leather, as we said before, was in the laudatory strain, but, like many  indiscreet people, he overdid it. Not content with magnifying the stud to  the liberal extent already described, he must needs puff his master's  riding, and indulge in insinuations about 'showing them all the way,' and  so on. Now nothing 'aggrawates' other grooms so much as this sort of  threat, and few things travel quicker than these sort of vapourings to  their masters' ears. Indeed, we can only excuse the lengths to which  Leather went, on the ground of his previous coaching career not having  afforded him a due insight into the delicacies of the hunting stable; it  being remembered that he was only now acting as stud-groom for the first  time. However, be that as it may, he brewed up a pretty storm, and the  longer it raged the stronger it became.    ''Ord dash it!' exclaimed young Spareneck, the steeple-chase rider,  bursting into Scorer's billiard-room in the midst of a full gathering, who  were looking on at a grand game of poule, 'Ord dash it! there's a fellow  coming who swears by Jove that he'll take the shine out of us all, \"cut us  all down!\"'    'I'll play him for what he likes!' exclaimed the cool, coatless Captain  Macer, striking his ball away for a cannon.    'Hang your play!' replied Spareneck; 'you're always thinking of play--it's  hunting I'm talking of.' bringing his heavy, silver-mounted jockey-whip a  crack down his leg.    'You don't say so!' exclaimed Sam Shortcut, who had been flattered into  riding rather harder than he liked, and feared his pluck might be put to  the test.    'What a ruffian!'--(puff)--observed Mr. Waffles, taking his cigar from his  mouth as he sat on the bench, dressed as a racket-player, looking on at the  game, 'he shalln't ride roughshod over us.'    'That he shalln't!' exclaimed Caingey Thornton, Mr. Waffles's premier  toady, and constant trencherman.    'I'll ride him!' rejoined Mr. Spareneck, jockeying his arms, and  flourishing his whip as if he was at work, adding: 'his old brandy-nosed,  frosty-whiskered trumpeter of a groom says he's coming down by the five  o'clock train. I vote we go and meet him--invite him to a steeple-chase by  moonlight.'    'I vote we go and see him, at all events,' observed Frank Hoppey, laying  down his cue and putting on his coat, adding, 'I should like to see a man"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16960"],[0,"History of the United States (#8)"],[1," it to the Southern colonies and to  the West Indies. As the industry developed, mills were erected for the  more difficult process of dyeing, weaving, and fulling, but carding and  spinning continued to be done in the home. The Dutch of New Netherland,  the Swedes of Delaware, and the Scotch-Irish of the interior \"were not  one whit behind their Yankee neighbors.\"    The importance of this enterprise to British economic life can hardly be  overestimated. For many a century the English had employed their fine  woolen cloth as the chief staple in a lucrative foreign trade, and the  government had come to look upon it as an object of special interest and  protection. When the colonies were established, both merchants and  statesmen naturally expected to maintain a monopoly of increasing value;  but before long the Americans, instead of buying cloth, especially of  the coarser varieties, were making it to sell. In the place of  customers, here were rivals. In the place of helpless reliance upon  English markets, here was the germ of economic independence.    If British merchants had not discovered it in the ordinary course of  trade, observant officers in the provinces would have conveyed the news  to them. Even in the early years of the eighteenth century the royal  governor of New York wrote of the industrious Americans to his home  government: \"The consequence will be that if they can clothe themselves  once, not only comfortably, but handsomely too, without the help of  England, they who already are not very fond of submitting to government  will soon think of putting in execution designs they have long harboured  in their breasts. This will not seem strange when you consider what sort  of people this country is inhabited by.\"    =The Iron Industry.=--Almost equally widespread was the art of iron  working--one of the earliest and most picturesque of colonial  industries. Lynn, Massachusetts, had a forge and skilled artisans within  fifteen years after the founding of Boston. The smelting of iron began  at New London and New Haven about 1658; in Litchfield county,  Connecticut, a few years later; at Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in  1731; and near by at Lenox some thirty years after that. New Jersey had  iron works at Shrewsbury within ten years after the founding of the  colony in 1665. Iron forges appeared in the valleys of the Delaware and  the Susquehanna early in the following century, and iron masters then  laid the foundations of fortunes in a region destined to become one of  the great iron centers of the world. Virginia began iron working in the  year that saw the introduction of slavery. Although the industry soon  lapsed, it was renewed and flourished in the eighteenth century.  Governor Spotswood was called the \"Tubal Cain\" of the Old Dominion  because he placed the industry on a firm foundation. Indeed it seems  that every colony, except Georgia, had its iron foundry. Nails, wire,  metallic ware, chains, anchors, bar and pig iron were made in large  quantities; and Great Britain, by an act in 1750, encouraged the  colonists to export rough iron to the British Islands.    =Shipbuilding.=--Of all the specialized industries in the colonies,  shipbuilding was the most important. The abundance of fir for masts, oak  for timbers and boards, pitch for tar and turpentine, and hemp for rope  made the way of the shipbuilder easy. Early in the seventeenth century a  ship was built at New Amsterdam, and by the middle of that century  shipyards were scattered along the New England coast at Newburyport,  Salem, New Bedford, Newport, Providence, New London, and New Haven.  Yards at Albany and Poughkeepsie in New York built ships for the trade  of that colony with England and the Indies. Wilmington and Philadelphia  soon entered the race and outdistanced New York, though unable to equal  the pace set by New England. While Maryland, Virginia, and South  Carolina also built ships, Southern interest was mainly confined to the  lucrative business of producing ship materials: fir, cedar, hemp, and  tar.    =Fishing.=--The greatest single economic resource of New England outside  of agriculture was the fisheries. This industry, started by hardy  sailors from Europe, long before the landing of the Pilgrims, flourished  under the indomitable seamanship of the Puritans, who labored with the  net and the harpoon in almost every quarter of the Atlantic. \"Look,\"  exclaimed Edmund Burke, in the House of Commons, \"at the manner in  which the people of New England have of late carried on the whale  fishery. Whilst we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice and  behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of Hudson's Bay  and Davis's Straits, while we are looking for them beneath the arctic  circle, we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of polar  cold, that they are at the antipodes and engaged under the frozen  serpent of the south.... Nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging  to them than the accumulated winter of both poles. We know that, whilst  some of them draw the line and strike the harpoon on the coast of  Africa, others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along  the coast of Brazil. No sea but what is vexed by their fisheries. No  climate that is not witness to their toils. Neither the perseverance of  Holland nor the activity of France nor the dexterous and firm sagacity  of English enterprise ever carried this most perilous mode of hard  industry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent  people.\"    The influence of the business was widespread. A large and lucrative  European trade was built upon it. The better quality of the fish caught  for food was sold in the markets of Spain, Portugal, and Italy, or  exchanged for salt, lemons, and raisins for the American market. The  lower grades of fish were carried to the West Indies for slave  consumption, and in part traded for sugar and molasses, which furnished  the raw materials for the thriving rum industry of New England. These  activities, in turn, stimulated shipbuilding, steadily enlarging the  demand for fishing and merchant craft of every kind and thus keeping the  shipwrights, calkers, rope makers, and other artisans of the seaport  towns rushed with work. They also increased trade with the mother  country for, out of the cash collected in the fish markets of Europe and  the West Indies, the colonists paid for English manufactures. So an  ever-widening circle of American enterprise centered around this single  industry, the nursery of seamanship and the maritime spirit.    =Oceanic Commerce and American Merchants.=--All through the eighteenth  century, the commerce of the American colonies spread in every direction  until it rivaled in the number of people employed, the capital engaged,  and the profits gleaned, the commerce of European nations. A modern  historian has said: \"The enterprising merchants of New England developed  a network of trade routes that covered well-nigh half the world.\" This  commerce, destined to be of such significance in the conflict with the  mother country, presented, broadly speaking, two aspects.    On the one side, it involved the export of raw materials and  agricultural produce. The Southern colonies produced for shipping,  tobacco, rice, tar, pitch, and pine; the Middle colonies, grain, flour,  furs, lumber, and salt pork; New England, fish, flour, rum, furs, shoes,  and small articles of manufacture. The variety of products was in fact  astounding. A sarcastic writer, while sneering at the idea of an  American union, once remarked of colonial trade: \"What sort of dish will  you make? New England will throw in fish and onions. The middle states,  flax-seed and flour. Maryland and Virginia will add tobacco. North  Carolina, pitch, tar, and turpentine. South Carolina, rice and indigo,  and Georgia will sprinkle the whole composition with sawdust. Such an  absurd jumble will you make if you attempt to form a union among such  discordant materials as the thirteen British provinces.\"    On the other side, American commerce involved the import trade,  consisting principally of English and continental manufactures, tea, and  \"India goods.\" Sugar and molasses, brought from the West Indies,  supplied the flourishing distilleries of Massachusetts, Rhode Island,  and Connecticut. The carriage of slaves from Africa to the Southern  colonies engaged hundreds of New England's sailors and thousands of  pounds of her capital.    The disposition of imported goods in the colonies, though in part  controlled by English factors located in America, employed also a large  and important body of American merchants like the Willings and Morrises  of Philadelphia; the Amorys, Hancocks, and Faneuils of Boston; and the  Livingstons and Lows of New York. In their zeal and enterprise, they  were worthy rivals of their English competitors, so celebrated for  world-wide commercial operations. Though fully aware of the advantages  they enjoyed in British markets and under the protection of the British  navy, the American merchants were high-spirited and mettlesome, ready to  contend with royal officers in order to shield American interests  against outside interference.    [Illustration: THE DUTCH WEST INDIA WAREHOUSE IN NEW AMSTERDAM  (NEW YORK CITY)]    Measured against the immense business of modern times, colonial commerce  seems perhaps trivial. That, however, is not the test of its  significance. It must be considered in relation to the growth of English  colonial trade in its entirety--a relation which can be shown by a few  startling figures. The whole export trade of England, including that to  the colonies, was, in 1704, L6,509,000. On the eve of the American  Revolution, namely, in 1772, English exports to the American colonies  alone amounted to L6,024,000; in other words, almost as much as the  whole foreign business of England two generations before.
