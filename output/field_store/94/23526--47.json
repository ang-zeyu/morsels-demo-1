Meanwhile Orsino, hearing how ill Cesario sped with Olivia, visited her  himself, taking Cesario with him. Olivia met them both before her  door, and seeing, as she thought, her husband there, reproached him for  leaving her, while to the Duke she said that his suit was as fat and  wholesome to her as howling after music.    \"Still so cruel?\" said Orsino.    \"Still so constant,\" she answered.    Then Orsino's anger growing to cruelty, he vowed that, to be revenged on  her, he would kill Cesario, whom he knew she loved. \"Come, boy,\" he said  to the page.    And Viola, following him as he moved away, said, \"I, to do you rest, a  thousand deaths would die.\"    A great fear took hold on Olivia, and she cried aloud, \"Cesario,  husband, stay!\"    \"Her husband?\" asked the Duke angrily.    \"No, my lord, not I,\" said Viola.    \"Call forth the holy father,\" cried Olivia.    And the priest who had married Sebastian and Olivia, coming in, declared  Cesario to be the bridegroom.    \"O thou dissembling cub!\" the Duke exclaimed. \"Farewell, and take her,  but go where thou and I henceforth may never meet.\"    At this moment Sir Andrew came up with bleeding crown, complaining that  Cesario had broken his head, and Sir Toby's as well.    \"I never hurt you,\" said Viola, very positively; \"you drew your sword on  me, but I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.\"    Yet, for all her protesting, no one there believed her; but all their  thoughts were on a sudden changed to wonder, when Sebastian came in.    \"I am sorry, madam,\" he said to his wife, \"I have hurt your kinsman.  Pardon me, sweet, even for the vows we made each other so late ago.\"    \"One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!\" cried the Duke,  looking first at Viola, and then at Sebastian.    \"An apple cleft in two,\" said one who knew Sebastian, \"is not more twin  than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?\"    \"I never had a brother,\" said Sebastian. \"I had a sister, whom the blind  waves and surges have devoured.\" \"Were you a woman,\" he said to Viola,  \"I should let my tears fall upon your cheek, and say, 'Thrice welcome,  drowned Viola!'\"    Then Viola, rejoicing to see her dear brother alive, confessed that she  was indeed his sister, Viola. As she spoke, Orsino felt the pity that is  akin to love.    \"Boy,\" he said, \"thou hast said to me a thousand times thou never  shouldst love woman like to me.\"    \"And all those sayings will I overswear,\" Viola replied, \"and all those  swearings keep true.\"    \"Give me thy hand,\" Orsino cried in gladness. \"Thou shalt be my wife,  and my fancy's queen.\"    Thus was the gentle Viola made happy, while Olivia found in Sebastian  a constant lover, and a good husband, and he in her a true and loving  wife.          MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING        In Sicily is a town called Messina, which is the scene of a curious  storm in a teacup that raged several hundred years ago.    It began with sunshine. Don Pedro, Prince of Arragon, in Spain, had  gained so complete a victory over his foes that the very land whence  they came is forgotten. Feeling happy and playful after the fatigues of  war, Don Pedro came for a holiday to Messina, and in his suite were his  stepbrother Don John and two young Italian lords, Benedick and Claudio.    Benedick was a merry chatterbox, who had determined to live a bachelor.  Claudio, on the other hand, no sooner arrived at Messina than he fell in  love with Hero, the daughter of Leonato, Governor of Messina.    One July day, a perfumer called Borachio was burning dried lavender in  a musty room in Leonato's house, when the sound of conversation floated  through the open window.    \"Give me your candid opinion of Hero,\" Claudio, asked, and Borachio  settled himself for comfortable listening.    \"Too short and brown for praise,\" was Benedick's reply; \"but alter her  color or height, and you spoil her.\"    \"In my eyes she is the sweetest of women,\" said Claudio.    \"Not in mine,\" retorted Benedick, \"and I have no need for glasses. She  is like the last day of December compared with the first of May if you  set her beside her cousin. Unfortunately, the Lady Beatrice is a fury.\"    Beatrice was Leonato's niece. She amused herself by saying witty and  severe things about Benedick, who called her Dear Lady Disdain. She  was wont to say that she was born under a dancing star, and could not  therefore be dull.    Claudio and Benedick were still talking when Don Pedro came up and said  good-humoredly, \"Well, gentlemen, what's the secret?\"    \"I am longing,\" answered Benedick, \"for your Grace to command me to  tell.\"    \"I charge you, then, on your allegiance to tell me,\" said Don Pedro,  falling in with his humor.    \"I can be as dumb as a mute,\" apologized Benedick to Claudio, \"but his  Grace commands my speech.\" To Don Pedro he said, \"Claudio is in love  with Hero, Leonato's short daughter.\"    Don Pedro was pleased, for he admired Hero and was fond of Claudio. When  Benedick had departed, he said to Claudio, \"Be steadfast in your love  for Hero, and I will help you to win her. To-night her father gives a  masquerade, and I will pretend I am Claudio, and tell her how Claudio  loves her, and if she be pleased, I will go to her father and ask his  consent to your union.\"    Most men like to do their own wooing, but if you fall in love with a  Governor's only daughter, you are fortunate if you can trust a prince to  plead for you.    Claudio then was fortunate, but he was unfortunate as well, for he  had an enemy who was outwardly a friend. This enemy was Don Pedro's  stepbrother Don John, who was jealous of Claudio because Don Pedro  preferred him to Don John.    It was to Don John that Borachio came with the interesting conversation  which he had overheard.    \"I shall have some fun at that masquerade myself,\" said Don John when  Borachio ceased speaking.    On the night of the masquerade, Don Pedro, masked and pretending he was  Claudio, asked Hero if he might walk with her.    They moved away together, and Don John went up to Claudio and said,  \"Signor Benedick, I believe?\" \"The same,\" fibbed Claudio.    \"I should be much obliged then,\" said Don John, \"if you would use your  influence with my brother to cure him of his love for Hero. She is  beneath him in rank.\"    \"How do you know he loves her?\" inquired Claudio.    \"I heard him swear his affection,\" was the reply, and Borachio chimed in  with, \"So did I too.\"    Claudio was then left to himself, and his thought was that his Prince  had betrayed him. \"Farewell, Hero,\" he muttered; \"I was a fool to trust  to an agent.\"    Meanwhile Beatrice and Benedick (who was masked) were having a brisk  exchange of opinions.    \"Did Benedick ever make you laugh?\" asked she.    \"Who is Benedick?\" he inquired.    \"A Prince's jester,\" replied Beatrice, and she spoke so sharply that \"I  would not marry her,\" he declared afterwards, \"if her estate were the  Garden of Eden.\"    But the principal speaker at the masquerade was neither Beatrice nor  Benedick. It was Don Pedro, who carried out his plan to the letter, and  brought the light back to Claudio's face in a twinkling, by appearing  before him with Leonato and Hero, and saying, \"Claudio, when would you  like to go to church?\"    \"To-morrow,\" was the prompt answer. \"Time goes on crutches till I marry  Hero.\"    \"Give her a week, my dear son,\" said Leonato, and Claudio's heart  thumped with joy.    \"And now,\" said the amiable Don Pedro, \"we must find a wife for Signor  Benedick. It is a task for Hercules.\"    \"I will help you,\" said Leonato, \"if I have to sit up ten nights.\"    Then Hero spoke. \"I will do what I can, my lord, to find a good husband  for Beatrice.\"    Thus, with happy laughter, ended the masquerade which had given Claudio  a lesson for nothing.    Borachio cheered up Don John by laying a plan before him with which he  was confident he could persuade both Claudio and Don Pedro that Hero was  a fickle girl who had two strings to her bow. Don John agreed to this  plan of hate.    Don Pedro, on the other hand, had devised a cunning plan of love.  \"If,\" he said to Leonato, \"we pretend, when Beatrice is near enough to  overhear us, that Benedick is pining for her love, she will pity him,  see his good qualities, and love him. And if, when Benedick thinks we  don't know he is listening, we say how sad it is that the beautiful  Beatrice should be in love with a heartless scoffer like Benedick, he  will certainly be on his knees before her in a week or less.\"    So one day, when Benedick was reading in a summer-house, Claudio sat  down outside it with Leonato, and said, \"Your daughter told me something  about a letter she wrote.\"    \"Letter!\" exclaimed Leonato. \"She will get up twenty times in the night  and write goodness knows what. But once Hero peeped, and saw the words  'Benedick and Beatrice' on the sheet, and then Beatrice tore it up.\"    \"Hero told me,\" said Claudio, \"that she cried, 'O sweet Benedick!'\"    Benedick was touched to the core by this improbable story, which he was  vain enough to believe. \"She is fair and good,\" he said to himself.  \"I must not seem proud. I feel that I love her. People will laugh, of  course; but their paper bullets will do me no harm.\"    At this moment Beatrice came to the summerhouse, and said, \"Against my  will, I have come to tell you that dinner is ready.\"    \"Fair Beatrice, I thank you,\" said Benedick.    \"I took no more pains to come than you take pains to thank me,\" was the  rejoinder, intended to freeze him.    But it did not freeze him. It warmed him. The meaning he squeezed out of  her rude speech was that she was delighted to come to him.    Hero, who had undertaken the task of melting the heart of Beatrice, took  no trouble to seek an occasion. She simply said to her maid Margaret one  day, \"Run into the parlor and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14300"],[0,"The Life of Napoleon I (Complete) (#8)"],[1,"dispersed.  Thereupon Buonaparte launches a vigorous protest against the tyranny  of the governor and appeals to the National Assembly of France for  some guarantee of civil liberty. His name is at the head of this  petition, a sufficiently daring step for a junior lieutenant on  furlough. But his patriotism and audacity carry him still further. He  journeys to Bastia, the official capital of his island, and is  concerned in an affray between the populace and the royal troops  (November 5th, 1789). The French authorities, fortunately for him, are  nearly powerless: he is merely requested to return to Ajaccio; and  there he organizes anew the civic force, and sets the dissident  islanders an example of good discipline by mounting guard outside the  house of a personal opponent.    Other events now transpired which began to assuage his opposition to  France. Thanks to the eloquent efforts of Mirabeau, the Corsican  patriots who had remained in exile since 1768 were allowed to return  and enjoy the full rights of citizenship. Little could the friends of  liberty at Paris, or even the statesman himself, have foreseen all the  consequences of this action: it softened the feelings of many  Corsicans towards their conquerors; above all, it caused the heart of  Napoleon Buonaparte for the first time to throb in accord with that of  the French nation. His feelings towards Paoli also began to cool. The  conduct of this illustrious exile exposed him to the charge of  ingratitude towards France. The decree of the French National  Assembly, which restored him to Corsican citizenship, was graced by  acts of courtesy such as the generous French nature can so winningly  dispense. Louis XVI. and the National Assembly warmly greeted him, and  recognized him as head of the National Guard of the island. Yet,  amidst all the congratulations, Paoli saw the approach of anarchy, and  behaved with some reserve. Outwardly, however, concord seemed to be  assured, when on July 14th, 1790, he landed in Corsica; but the hatred  long nursed by the mountaineers and fisherfolk against France was not  to be exorcised by a few demonstrations. In truth, the island was  deeply agitated. The priests were rousing the people against the newly  decreed Civil Constitution of the Clergy; and one of these  disturbances endangered the life of Napoleon himself. He and his  brother Joseph chanced to pass by when one of the processions of  priests and devotees was exciting the pity and indignation of the  townsfolk. The two brothers, who were now well known as partisans of  the Revolution, were threatened with violence, and were saved only by  their own firm demeanour and the intervention of peacemakers.    Then again, the concession of local self-government to the island, as  one of the Departments of France, revealed unexpected difficulties.  Bastia and Ajaccio struggled hard for the honour of being the official  capital. Paoli favoured the claims of Bastia, thereby annoying the  champions of Ajaccio, among whom the Buonapartes were prominent. The  schism was widened by the dictatorial tone of Paoli, a demeanour which  ill became the chief of a civic force. In fact, it soon became  apparent that Corsica was too small a sphere for natures so able and  masterful as those of Paoli and Napoleon Buonaparte.    The first meeting of these two men must have been a scene of deep  interest. It was on the fatal field of Ponte Nuovo. Napoleon doubtless  came there in the spirit of true hero-worship. But hero-worship which  can stand the strain of actual converse is rare indeed, especially  when the expectant devotee is endowed with keen insight and habits of  trenchant expression. One phrase has come down to us as a result of  the interview; but this phrase contains a volume of meaning. After  Paoli had explained the disposition of his troops against the French  at Ponte Nuovo, Buonaparte drily remarked to his brother Joseph, \"The  result of these dispositions was what was inevitable.\" [13]    For the present, Buonaparte and other Corsican democrats were closely  concerned with the delinquencies of the Comte de Buttafuoco, the  deputy for the twelve nobles of the island to the National Assembly of  France. In a letter written on January 23rd, 1791, Buonaparte  overwhelms this man with a torrent of invective.--He it was who had  betrayed his country to France in 1768. Self-interest and that alone  prompted his action then, and always. French rule was a cloak for his  design of subjecting Corsica to \"the absurd feudal _regime_\" of the  barons. In his selfish royalism he had protested against the new  French constitution as being unsuited to Corsica, \"though it was  exactly the same as that which brought us so much good and was wrested  from us only amidst streams of blood.\"--The letter is remarkable for  the southern intensity of its passion, and for a certain hardening of  tone towards Paoli. Buonaparte writes of Paoli as having been ever  \"surrounded by enthusiasts, and as failing to understand in a man any  other passion than fanaticism for liberty and independence,\" and as  duped by Buttafuoco in 1768.[14] The phrase has an obvious reference  to the Paoli of 1791, surrounded by men who had shared his long exile  and regarded the English constitution as their model. Buonaparte, on  the contrary, is the accredited champion of French democracy, his  furious epistle being printed by the Jacobin Club of Ajaccio.    After firing off this tirade Buonaparte returned to his regiment at  Auxonne (February, 1791). It was high time; for his furlough, though  prolonged on the plea of ill-health, had expired in the preceding  October, and he was therefore liable to six months' imprisonment. But  the young officer rightly gauged the weakness of the moribund  monarchy; and the officers of his almost mutinous regiment were glad  to get him back on any terms. Everywhere in his journey through  Provence and Dauphine, Buonaparte saw the triumph of revolutionary  principles. He notes that the peasants are to a man for the  Revolution; so are the rank and file of the regiment. The officers  are aristocrats, along with three-fourths of those who belong to \"good  society\": so are all the women, for \"Liberty is fairer than they, and  eclipses them.\" The Revolution was evidently gaining completer hold  over his mind and was somewhat blurring his insular sentiments, when a  rebuff from Paoli further weakened his ties to Corsica. Buonaparte had  dedicated to him his work on Corsica, and had sent him the manuscript  for his approval. After keeping it an unconscionable time, the old man  now coldly replied that he did not desire the honour of Buonaparte's  panegyric, though he thanked him heartily for it; that the  consciousness of having done his duty sufficed for him in his old age;  and, for the rest, history should not be written in youth. A further  request from Joseph Buonaparte for the return of the slighted  manuscript brought the answer that he, Paoli, had no time to search  his papers. After this, how could hero-worship subsist?    The four months spent by Buonaparte at Auxonne were, indeed, a time of  disappointment and hardship. Out of his slender funds he paid for the  education of his younger brother, Louis, who shared his otherwise  desolate lodging. A room almost bare but for a curtainless bed, a  table heaped with books and papers, and two chairs--such were the  surroundings of the lieutenant in the spring of 1791. He lived on  bread that he might rear his brother for the army, and that he might  buy books, overjoyed when his savings mounted to the price of some  coveted volume.    Perhaps the depressing conditions of his life at Auxonne may account  for the acrid tone of an essay which he there wrote in competition for  a prize offered by the Academy of Lyons on the subject--\"What truths  and sentiments ought to be inculcated to men for their happiness.\" It  was unsuccessful; and modern readers will agree with the verdict of  one of the judges that it was incongruous in arrangement and of a bad  and ragged style. The thoughts are set forth in jerky, vehement  clauses; and, in place of the _sensibilite_ of some of his earlier  effusions, we feel here the icy breath of materialism. He regards an  ideal human society as a geometrical structure based on certain  well-defined postulates. All men ought to be able to satisfy certain  elementary needs of their nature; but all that is beyond is  questionable or harmful. The ideal legislator will curtail wealth so  as to restore the wealthy to their true nature--and so forth. Of any  generous outlook on the wider possibilities of human life there is  scarcely a trace. His essay is the apotheosis of social mediocrity. By  Procrustean methods he would have forced mankind back to the dull  levels of Sparta: the opalescent glow of Athenian life was beyond his  ken. But perhaps the most curious passage is that in which he preaches  against the sin and folly of ambition. He pictures Ambition as a  figure with pallid cheeks, wild eyes, hasty step, jerky movements and  sardonic smile, for whom crimes are a sport, while lies and calumnies  are merely arguments and figures of speech. Then, in words that recall  Juvenal's satire on Hannibal's career, he continues: \"What is  Alexander doing when he rushes from Thebes into Persia and thence into  India? He is ever restless, he loses his wits, he believes himself  God. What is the end of Cromwell? He governs England. But is he not  tormented by all the daggers of the furies?\"--The words ring false,  even for this period of Buonaparte's life; and one can readily  understand his keen wish in later years to burn every copy of these  youthful essays. But they have nearly all survived; and the diatribe  against ambition itself supplies the feather wherewith history may  wing her shaft at the towering flight of the imperial eagle.[15]    At midsummer he is transferred, as first lieutenant, to another"]]]
