All these things  show clearly that there was a settlement there founded by Christians;  and what leads me to say and believe that it was that of Jacques Cartier  is the fact that there is no evidence whatever that any one wintered and  built a house in these places except Jacques Cartier at the time of his  discoveries.\"    This \"little river coming from a lake in the interior,\" is evidently the  river St. Charles, called Ste. Croix by Cartier. Champlain's conjectures  about the place where Jacques Cartier wintered, are certainly correct.  It was near this spot also that the Jesuits erected their convent of  Notre Dame des Anges in 1626, namely, at two hundred feet from the  shore, where the river Lairet joins the St. Charles.    Pont-Grave sailed for France on September 18th, 1608, leaving Champlain  with twenty-seven men, and provisions for the approaching winter at  Quebec. The carpenters, sawyers, and other workmen were employed in  clearing up the place and in preparing gardens.    Many Indians were encamped in the vicinity, who proved troublesome  neighbours, as they were constantly visiting the habitation, either to  beg food for their families or to express their fear of invisible  enemies. Champlain readily understood the character of these people, but  he was too charitable to refuse them assistance in their need; besides  he believed that they might easily be taught how to live and how to  cultivate the soil. It was a difficult task, however, to induce the  Indians to settle in any particular place. For generations they had led  a wandering life, subsisting on the products of their hunting and  fishing. This wild freedom was as necessary to their existence as the  open air, and all attempts to make them follow the habits of civilized  races seemed to tend towards their deterioration.    The early days of the French settlement at Quebec were distinguished by  nothing remarkable. During the first winter scurvy and dysentery claimed  many victims. Natel, the locksmith, died towards the end of November,  and some time after Bonnerme, the doctor, was attacked and succumbed.  Eighteen others also suffered from scurvy of whom ten died, and there  were five deaths from dysentery, so that by the spring there were only  eight men living, and Champlain himself was seriously indisposed. This  was the third time that the founder of Quebec had had to experience the  effects of this terrible disease, and although he was beginning to  understand its causes, he was still unaware of a specific. \"I am  confident,\" he says, \"that, with good bread and fresh meat, a person  would not be liable to it.\"    Many trials had been experienced by the settlers during their first  winter of 1608-09, and they welcomed the return of spring. Des  Marets[10] arrived at Quebec at this time, with tidings that Pont-Grave,  his father-in-law, had arrived at Tadousac on May 28th. Champlain at  once repaired to Tadousac, where he received a letter from de Monts  requesting him to return to France to acquaint him with the progress  which he had made in the colony, and with the result of his  explorations. Champlain returned to Quebec, and immediately fitted out  an expedition to visit the country of the Iroquois, in the company of a  party of Montagnais.    The Montagnais were anxious to carry on war against their ancient  enemies, and although the wars had no attraction for Champlain, he hoped  to be able to further his discoveries during the journey. Taking with  him the twenty men placed at his disposal by Pont-Grave, Champlain  sailed from Quebec on June 18th, 1609. The command of the habitation  was given to Pont-Grave in the meantime. The expedition proceeded  towards the island of St. Eloi, near the shores of which two or three  hundred savages were encamped in tents. They proved to be Hurons and  Algonquins who were on their way to Quebec to join Champlain's  expedition to the territory of the Iroquois. Their chiefs were named  Iroquet and Ochateguin, and Champlain explained to them the object of  his voyage. The next day the two chiefs paid a visit to Champlain and  remained silent for some time, meditating and smoking. After some  reflection the chiefs began to harangue their companions on the banks of  the river. They spoke for a long time in loud tones, and the substance  of their remarks has been summed up in these words:--    \"Ten moons ago Champlain had declared that he desired to assist them  against their enemies, with whom they had been for a long time at  warfare, on account of many cruel acts committed by them against their  tribe, under colour of friendship. Having ever since longed for  vengeance, they had solicited all the savages whom they had seen on the  banks of the river to come and make an alliance. They had no children  with them but men versed in war and full of courage, and well acquainted  with the country and the rivers of the land of the Iroquois. They wanted  to go to Quebec in order that they might see the French houses, but  after three days they would return to engage in the war. As a token of  firm friendship and joy, Champlain should have muskets and arquebuses  fired.\"    Champlain replied that he was glad to be able to fulfil his promise to  them; he had no other purpose than to assist them in their wars; he had  not come as a trader, but only with arms to fight. His word was given,  and it was his desire that it should be kept. Thus was the alliance  ratified which had been made in 1603 between the French and the Hurons,  Algonquins and Montagnais, and the alliance was never broken.    Some historians have reproached Champlain for his intervention in the  wars between the Indians of Canada, and have suggested that it would  have been wiser to have preserved a strict neutrality, instead of taking  up arms against the redoubtable and valiant Iroquois. In order to  explain Champlain's actions, it is necessary to consider the relations  of the French towards the other tribes. Many years before the period of  which we are writing, certain French captains traded with the Montagnais  Indians of Tadousac. These Indians were on friendly terms with the  Hurons, the Algonquins Superieurs of the Ottawa river, and the  Souriquois of Acadia, and were united in their desire to subdue the  terrible Iroquois. As the Iroquois did not trade, Champlain had no  relations with them of a business character, and therefore he was not  bound towards them in the same manner as he was towards the Hurons and  others.    The Iroquois at first resided at Montreal and Three Rivers, while their  neighbours, the Algonquins, were scattered along the shores of the  Ottawa River, Lake Nipissing and French River. The Algonquins, who were  brave and very numerous, succeeded in driving the Iroquois back to Lake  Erie, and afterwards to Lake Ontario, near Lake Champlain. Here the  Iroquois were distributed in five tribes, forming a great confederation.  (1.) The Tsonnontouans or Senecas. (2.) The Goyogouins or Cayugas. (3.)  The Onontagues or Onondagas. (4.) The Onneyouts or Oneidas. (5.) The  Agniers or Mohawks. The Tsonnontouans were the most numerous, but the  Agniers were the bravest and wildest.    The Iroquois or confederate tribes had by constant warfare become the  greatest warriors of New France, nor is this fact surprising when we  consider that they had waged successful warfare, extending over a long  period, against the vast coalition of Hurons, Algonquins, Montagnais and  Micmacs scattered from Lake Huron to Acadia.    Anadabijou, chief of the Montagnais, made a long speech, telling his men  that they ought to feel proud of the friendship of the king of France  and of his people, upon whom they could rely for assistance in their  wars. It was from that date that the alliance between the Indians and  the French commenced, and, as Champlain was obliged to live in the  neighbourhood of the Montagnais and Algonquins, the only course open to  him, if he desired to live in peace, was to fulfil his promise made to  them.    In this year, 1609, Anadabijou reminded Champlain of the agreement made  six years before. \"Ten moons ago,\" he says, \"the son of Iroquet had seen  you. You gave him a good reception, and promised with Pont-Grave to  assist us against our enemies.\" To this Champlain replied, \"My only  desire is to fulfil what I promised then.\" Thus was sealed this solemn  agreement.    If Champlain had refused to make an alliance with these Indians, they  would have been a constant source of trouble, for although they were  less ferocious than the Iroquois, they were still barbarians. Champlain  and his few men could never have established a settlement at Quebec if  they had been forced to encounter the hostility of the neighbouring  Indians, for the whole of his work could have been overthrown by them in  a single day.    The country of the Iroquois, on the contrary, was situated at a great  distance, and consequently he had not so much to fear from them. It was  Champlain's desire, however, to make a treaty with the Iroquois as well,  for they were at this time even, and long after remained, the terror of  North America. But war seemed necessary to the existence of the  Iroquois, and Champlain, notwithstanding the exercise of his diplomacy,  found it impossible to pacify these restless people.    It is true that the people of New Netherland had been able to maintain  a neutral stand towards the Iroquois, and Champlain has been blamed for  not following this example. It must be borne in mind, however, that the  Dutch were powerful and numerous, and it was to their interest to live  in harmony with their immediate neighbours, the Iroquois. The Dutch had  also different intentions towards the Indians. They came to America  simply to trade, and to establish themselves and live quietly along the  shores of the Hudson River, while Champlain's idea was to civilize the  Indians and bring them under the influence of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17144"],[0,"The House of the Vampire (#8)"],[1," her back from the train of thoughts that his  words had suggested. For in his reasoning she had recognised the same  arguments that she had hourly repeated to herself in defence of her  inactivity when she was living under the baneful influence of Reginald  Clarke. Yes, baneful; for the first time she dared to confess it to  herself. In a flash the truth dawned upon her that it was not her love  alone, but something else, something irresistable and very mysterious,  that had dried up the well of creation in her. Could it be that the same  power was now exerting its influence upon the struggling soul of this  talented boy? Rack her brains as she might, she could not definitely  formulate her apprehensions and a troubled look came into her eyes.    \"Ethel,\" the boy repeated, impatiently, \"why are you not listening? Do  you realise that I must leave you in half an hour?\"    She looked at him with deep tenderness. Something like a tear lent a  soft radiance to her large child-like eyes.    Ernest saw it and was profoundly moved. In that moment he loved her  passionately.    \"Foolish boy,\" she said softly; then, lowering her voice to a whisper:  \"You may kiss me before you go.\"    His lips gently touched hers, but she took his head between her hands  and pressed her mouth upon his in a long kiss.    Ernest drew back a little awkwardly. He had not been kissed like this  before.    \"Poet though you are,\" Ethel whispered, \"you have not yet learned to  kiss.\"    She was deeply agitated when she noticed that his hand was fumbling for  the watch in his vest-pocket. She suddenly released him, and said, a  little hurt: \"No, you must not miss your train. Go by all means.\"    Vainly Ernest remonstrated with her.    \"Go to him,\" she said, and again, \"go to him.\"    With a heavy heart the boy obeyed. He waved his hat to her once more  from below, and then rapidly disappeared in the crowd. For a moment  strange misgivings cramped her heart, and something within her called  out to him: \"Do not go! Do not return to that house.\" But no sound  issued from her lips. Worldly wisdom had sealed them, had stifled the  inner voice. And soon the boy's golden head was swallowed up in the  distance.          XVI      While the train sped to New York, Ethel Brandenbourg was the one object  engaging Ernest's mind. He still felt the pressure of her lips upon his,  and his nostrils dilated at the thought of the fragrance of her hair  brushing against his forehead.    But the moment his foot touched the ferry-boat that was to take him to  Manhattan, the past three weeks were, for the time being at least,  completely obliterated from his memory. All his other interests that he  had suppressed in her company because she had no part in them, came  rushing back to him. He anticipated with delight his meeting with  Reginald Clarke. The personal attractiveness of the man had never seemed  so powerful to Ernest as when he had not heard from him for some time.  Reginald's letters were always brief. \"Professional writers,\" he was  wont to say, \"cannot afford to put fine feeling into their private  correspondence. They must turn it into copy.\" He longed to sit with the  master in the studio when the last rays of the daylight were tremulously  falling through the stained window, and to discuss far into the  darkening night philosophies young and old. He longed for Reginald's  voice, his little mannerisms, the very perfume of his rooms.    There also was a deluge of letters likely to await him in his apartment.  For in his hurried departure he had purposely left his friends in the  dark as to his whereabouts. Only to Jack he had dropped a little note  the day after his meeting with Ethel.    He earnestly hoped to find Reginald at home, though it was well nigh ten  o'clock in the evening, and he cursed the \"rapid transit\" for its  inability to annihilate space and time. It is indeed disconcerting to  think how many months, if not years, of our earthly sojourn the dwellers  in cities spend in transportation conveyances that must be set down as a  dead loss in the ledger of life. A nervous impatience against things  material overcame Ernest in the subway. It is ever the mere stupid  obstacle of matter that weights down the wings of the soul and prevents  it from soaring upward to the sun.    When at last he had reached the house, he learned from the hall-boy that  Clarke had gone out. Ruffled in temper he entered his rooms and went  over his mail. There were letters from editors with commissions that he  could not afford to reject. Everywhere newspapers and magazines opened  their yawning mouths to swallow up what time he had. He realised at once  that he would have to postpone the writing of his novel for several  weeks, if not longer.    Among the letters was one from Jack. It bore the postmark of a little  place in the Adirondacks where he was staying with his parents. Ernest  opened the missive not without hesitation. On reading and rereading it  the fine lines on his forehead, that would some day deepen into  wrinkles, became quite pronounced and a look of displeasure darkened his  face. Something was wrong with Jack, a slight change that defied  analysis. Their souls were out of tune. It might only be a passing  disturbance; perhaps it was his own fault. It pained him, nevertheless.  Somehow it seemed of late that Jack was no longer able to follow the  vagaries of his mind. Only one person in the world possessed a similar  mental vision, only one seemed to understand what he said and what he  left unsaid. Reginald Clarke, being a man and poet, read in his soul as  in an open book. Ethel might have understood, had not love, like a  cloud, laid itself between her eyes and the page.    It was with exultation that Ernest heard near midnight the click of  Reginald's key in the door. He found him unchanged, completely,  radiantly himself. Reginald possessed the psychic power of undressing  the soul, of seeing it before him in primal nakedness. Although no word  was said of Ethel Brandenbourg except the mere mention of her presence  in Atlantic City, Ernest intuitively knew that Reginald was aware of the  transformation that absence had wrought in him. In the presence of this  man he could be absolutely himself, without shame or fear of  mis-understanding; and by a strange metamorphosis, all his affection  for Ethel and Jack went out for the time being to Reginald Clarke.          XVII      The next day Ernest wrote a letter of more or less superficial  tenderness to Ethel. She had wounded his pride by proving victorious in  the end over his passion and hers; besides, he was in the throes of  work. When after the third day no answer came, he was inclined to feel  aggrieved. It was plain now that she had not cared for him in the least,  but had simply played with him for lack of another toy. A flush of shame  rose to his cheeks at the thought. He began to analyse his own emotions,  and stunned, if not stabbed, his passion step by step. Work was calling  to him. It was that which gave life its meaning, not the love of a  season. How far away, how unreal, she now seemed to him. Yes, she was  right, he had not cared deeply; and his novel, too, would be written  only _at_ her. It was the heroine of his story that absorbed his  interest, not the living prototype.    Once in a conversation with Reginald he touched upon the subject.  Reginald held that modern taste no longer permitted even the  photographer to portray life as it is, but insisted upon an individual  visualisation. \"No man,\" he remarked, \"was ever translated bodily into  fiction. In contradiction to life, art is a process of artificial  selection.\"    Bearing in mind this motive, Ernest went to work to mould from the  material in hand a new Ethel, more real than life. Unfortunately he  found little time to devote to his novel. It was only when, after a good  day's work, a pile of copy for a magazine lay on his desk, that he could  think of concentrating his mind upon \"Leontina.\" The result was that  when he went to bed his imagination was busy with the plan of his book,  and the creatures of his own brain laid their fingers on his eyelid so  that he could not sleep.    When at last sheer weariness overcame him, his mind was still at work,  not in orderly sequence but along trails monstrous and grotesque.  Hobgoblins seemed to steal through the hall, and leering incubi  oppressed his soul with terrible burdens. In the morning he awoke  unrested. The tan vanished from his face and little lines appeared in  the corners of his mouth. It was as if his nervous vitality were sapped  from him in some unaccountable way. He became excited, hysterical. Often  at night when he wrote his pot-boilers for the magazines, fear stood  behind his seat, and only the buzzing of the elevator outside brought  him back to himself.    In one of his morbid moods he wrote a sonnet which he showed to Reginald  after the latter's return from a short trip out of town. Reginald read  it, looking at the boy with a curious, lurking expression.      _O gentle Sleep, turn not thy face away,        But place thy finger on my brow, and take        All burthens from me and all dreams that ache;     Upon mine eyes a cooling balsam lay,     Seeing I am aweary of the day.        But, lo! thy lips are ashen and they quake.        What spectral vision sees thou that can shake     Thy sweet composure, and thy heart dismay?     Perhaps some murderer's cruel eye agleam     Is fixed upon me, or some monstrous dream       Might bring such fearful guilt upon the head         Of my unvigilant soul as would arouse       The Borgian snake from her envenomed bed,         Or startle Nero in his golden house._    \"Good stuff,\" Reginald remarked, laying down the manuscript; \"when did  you write it?\"    \"The night when you were out of town,\" Ernest rejoined.    \"I see,\" Reginald replied.    There was something startling in his intonation that at once"]]]
