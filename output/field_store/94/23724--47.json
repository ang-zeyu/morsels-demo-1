[Illustration: AN INDIAN DEER-TRAP.]    [Illustration: BRADFORD CAUGHT.]      66. Captain Standish and his men set sail in a boat for a blue hill  in the west, and find Plymouth Rock; Plymouth Harbor; landing from  the _Mayflower_.--On clear days the people on board the _Mayflower_,  anchored in Cape Cod Harbor, could see a blue hill, on the mainland,  in the west, about forty miles away. To that blue hill Standish and  some others determined to go. Taking a sail-boat, they started off.  A few days later they passed the hill which the Indians called  Manomet,[6] and entered a fine harbor. There, on December 21st,  1620,--the shortest day in the year,--they landed on that famous  stone which is now known all over the world as Plymouth Rock.    Standish, with the others, went back to the _Mayflower_ with a good  report. They had found just what they wanted,--an excellent harbor  where ships from England could come in; a brook of nice  drinking-water; and last of all, a piece of land that was nearly free  from trees, so that nothing would hinder their planting corn early  in the spring. Captain John Smith of Virginia[7] had been there  before them, and had named the place Plymouth on his map of New  England. The Pilgrims liked the name, and so made up their minds to  keep it. The _Mayflower_ soon sailed for Plymouth, and the Pilgrims  set to work to build the log cabins of their little settlement.    [Illustration: THE _Mayflower_ IN PLYMOUTH HARBOR.]    [Footnote 6: Manomet (Man'o-met).]    [Footnote 7: See paragraph 46.]      67. Sickness and death.--During that winter nearly half the Pilgrims  died. Captain Standish showed himself to be as good a nurse as he  was a soldier. He, with Governor Carver and their minister, Elder  Brewster, cooked, washed, waited on the sick, and did everything that  kind hearts and willing hands could to help their suffering friends.  But the men who had begun to build houses had to stop that work to  dig graves. When these graves were filled, they were smoothed down  flat so that no prowling Indian should count them and see how few  white men there were left.      68. Samoset,[8] Squanto,[9] and Massasoit[10] visit the  Pilgrims.--One day in the spring the Pilgrims were startled at seeing  an Indian walk boldly into their little settlement. He cried out in  good English, \"Welcome! Welcome!\" This visitor was named Samoset;  he had met some sailors years before, and had learned a few English  words from them.    The next time Samoset came he brought with him another Indian, whose  name was Squanto. Squanto was the only one left of the tribe that  had once lived at Plymouth. All the rest had died of a dreadful  sickness, or plague. He had been stolen by some sailors and carried  to England; there he had learned the language. After his return he  had joined an Indian tribe that lived about thirty miles further west.  The chief of that tribe was named Massasoit, and Squanto said that  he was coming directly to visit the Pilgrims.    In about an hour Massasoit, with some sixty warriors, appeared on  a hill just outside the settlement. The Indians had painted their  faces in their very gayest style--black, red, and yellow. If paint  could make them handsome, they were determined to look their best.    [Footnote 8: Samoset (Sam'o-set).]    [Footnote 9: Squanto (Skwon'to).]    [Footnote 10: Massasoit (Mas'sa-soit').]      69. Massasoit and Governor Carver make a treaty of friendship; how  Thanksgiving was kept; what Squanto did for the Pilgrims.--Captain  Standish, attended by a guard of honor, went out and brought the chief  to Governor Carver. Then Massasoit and the governor made a solemn  promise or treaty, in which they agreed that the Indians of his tribe  and the Pilgrims should live like friends and brothers, doing all  they could to help each other. That promise was kept for more than  fifty years; it was never broken until long after the two men who  made it were in their graves.    [Illustration: CAPTAIN STANDISH AND MASSASOIT.]    When the Pilgrims had their first Thanksgiving, they invited  Massasoit and his men to come and share it. The Indians brought  venison and other good things; there were plenty of wild turkeys  roasted; and so they all sat down together to a great dinner, and  had a merry time in the wilderness.    Squanto was of great help to the Pilgrims. He showed them how to catch  eels, where to go fishing, when to plant their corn, and how to put  a fish in every hill to make it grow fast.    After a while he came to live with the Pilgrims. He liked them so  much that when the poor fellow died he begged Governor Bradford to  pray that he might go to the white man's heaven.      70. Canonicus[11] dares Governor Bradford to fight; the palisade;  the fort and meeting-house.--West of where Massasoit lived, there  were some Indians on the shore of Narragansett Bay,[12] in what is  now Rhode Island. Their chief was named Canonicus, and he was no  friend to Massasoit or to the Pilgrims. Canonicus thought he could  frighten the white men away, so he sent a bundle of sharp, new arrows,  tied round with a rattlesnake skin, to Governor Bradford: that meant  that he dared the governor and his men to come out and fight. Governor  Bradford threw away the arrows, and then filled the snake-skin up  to the mouth with powder and ball. This was sent back to Canonicus.  When he saw it, he was afraid to touch it, for he knew that Myles  Standish's bullets would whistle louder and cut deeper than his  Indian arrows.    [Illustration: ARROWS BOUND WITH SNAKE-SKIN.]    But though the Pilgrims did not believe that Canonicus would attack  them, they thought it best to build a very high, strong fence, called  a palisade, round the town.    [Illustration: THE PALISADE BUILT ROUND PLYMOUTH.]    They also built a log fort on one of the hills, and used the lower  part of the fort for a church. Every Sunday all the people, with  Captain Standish at the head, marched to their meeting-house, where  a man stood on guard outside. Each Pilgrim carried his gun, and set  it down near him. With one ear he listened sharply to the preacher;  with the other he listened just as sharply for the cry, Indians!  Indians! But the Indians never came.    [Footnote 11: Canonicus (Ka-non'i-kus).]    [Footnote 12: Narragansett (Nar'a-gan'set): see map, paragraph 84.]      71. The new settlers; trouble with the Indians in their neighborhood;  Captain Standish's fight with the savages.--By and by more emigrants  came from England and settled about twenty-five miles north of  Plymouth, at what is now called Weymouth. The Indians in that  neighborhood did not like these new settlers, and they made up their  minds to come upon them suddenly and murder them.    Governor Bradford sent Captain Standish with a few men, to see how  great the danger was. He found the Indians very bold. One of them  came up to him, whetting a long knife. He held it up, to show how  sharp it was, and then patting it, he said, \"By and by, it shall eat,  but not speak.\" Presently another Indian came up. He was a big fellow,  much larger and stronger than Standish. He, too, had a long knife,  as keen as a razor. \"Ah,\" said he to Standish, \"so this is the mighty  captain the white men have sent to destroy us! He is a little man;  let him go and work with the women.\"[13]    The captain's blood was on fire with rage; but he said not a word.  His time had not yet come. The next day the Pilgrims and the Indians  met in a log cabin. Standish made a sign to one of his men, and he  shut the door fast. Then the captain sprang like a tiger at the big  savage who had laughed at him, and snatching his long knife from him,  he plunged it into his heart. A hand-to-hand fight followed between  the white men and the Indians. The Pilgrims gained the victory, and  carried back the head of the Indian chief in triumph to Plymouth.  Captain Standish's bold action saved both of the English settlements  from destruction.    [Footnote 13: See Longfellow's _The Courtship of Miles Standish_.  This quotation is truthful in its rendering of the _spirit_ of the  words used by the Indian in his insulting speech to Standish; it  should be understood, however, that the poem does not always adhere  closely either to the chronology, or to the exact facts, of history.]      72. What else Myles Standish did; his death.--But Standish did more  things for the Pilgrims than fight for them; for he went to England,  bought goods for them, and borrowed money to help them.    He lived to be an old man. At his death he left, among other things,  three well-worn Bibles and three good guns. In those days, the men  who read the Bible most were those who fought the hardest.    Near Plymouth there is a high hill called Captain's Hill. That was  where Standish made his home during the last of his life. A granite  monument, over a hundred feet high, stands on top of the hill. On  it is a statue of the brave captain looking toward the sea. He was  one of the makers of America.    [Illustration: MYLES STANDISH'S KETTLE, SWORD, AND PEWTER DISH.]    [Illustration: COPY OF MYLES STANDISH'S SIGNATURE.]      73. Governor John Winthrop founds[14] Boston.--Ten years after the  Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, a large company of English people under  the leadership of Governor John Winthrop came to New England. They  were called Puritans,[15] and they, too, were seeking that religious  freedom which was denied them in the old country. One of the vessels  which brought over these new settlers was named the _Mayflower_. She  may have been the very ship which in 1620 brought the Pilgrims to  these shores.    Governor Winthrop's company named the place where they settled  Boston, in grateful remembrance of the beautiful old city of  Boston,[16] England, from which some of the chief emigrants came.

This corridor is facetiously nick-named by the prisoners as  \"Avenue of the Damned,\" because it is in these cells that the tenants  await their doom. I was separated from my two companions, who were  already being treated more leniently than myself, the case against them  being obviously very thin, and was brought to a stop before cell \"No.  11.\"    The massive door swung open, and accompanied by four soldiers I entered.  The door closed, there was a grating in the lock, and we were alone.  Even now I could not keep back a smile. Although I had been thrust into  the cell, together with four armed soldiers, and the door had been  bolted and barred, I turned at the sound of a slight click. The head  gaoler, who had ushered us in and had locked the door upon us, according  to the regulations of the prison, had opened the peep-hole to satisfy  himself that I was safely inside!          CHAPTER III    HOW GERMANY DRIVES HER PRISONERS MAD      The soldiers had accompanied me into the cell to complete the  preliminaries which comprised the final search. This involved my  transition to a state of nature. My frock coat was removed and all  pockets further examined. The seams and lining were closely investigated  while even the buttons were probed to make certain they concealed  nothing of a dangerous nature. In a few minutes they discovered my  silent companion, the tiny camera, which I had deftly removed from its  secret hiding-place to a tail pocket in my coat, as I did not wish to  have it found in its hiding-place, which would have been far more  incriminating. I had done this while coming down the steps to the cells.  Also I had extracted the exposed film and had placed this in a spot  where it was absolutely safe from discovery.    When the soldiers alighted upon the instrument they were sorely puzzled.  All my pockets had been turned inside out in the room upstairs and now  this camera had been brought to light. They shook their heads completely  baffled, and looked at me meaningly. But my face was inscrutable.    Every garment was subjected to a rigorous search. Yet beyond the camera  they found nothing. Certainly no papers were brought to light. There was  no mistaking their bitter disappointment; this was plainly written upon  their faces. My watch was prized open, and the works were turned out,  while a photograph of my wife and children was torn from the back case  to make certain there was nothing concealed behind it. My shirt was  turned over and over and held up to the light to be examined inch by  inch for any traces of secret writing. But all to no purpose. From their  mortification and behaviour I surmised that they had been promised a  monetary reward if they succeeded in finding anything in writing. And  now they were destined to go empty-handed. Thereupon, after laying their  heads together for a few seconds, they drew pencil and paper from their  pockets and commenced writing.    I was suspicious of this action. To me it was palpable that, animated by  the lure of money and foiled in their efforts, they were prepared to go  the length of concocting evidence against me. At least I thought so, and  summarily frustrated their action. I went to them and by the aid of  signs demonstrated that I wanted the paper torn up, or I would ring the  emergency bell and summon the head gaoler to explain matters. They  apparently did not relish my threat, because they instantly tore the  paper to shreds.    By the time their search was completed I was stripped to the skin. But I  was not permitted to re-dress. Evidently they concluded that I might  have pockets in my epidermis because they went over me, inch by inch,  resorting to actions which were wholly unnecessary and which were  revolting, degrading, and demoralising to the last degree--such actions  as one would hardly expect even from the lowest animals. During the  process they joked and gibed freely at my expense.    Although it was with the utmost difficulty I controlled my feelings, my  blood soon began to boil, rapidly rising to fever heat, when they  descended to familiarities and personalities which flesh and blood could  not stand. I suffered their indignities as long as I could. Then unable  to contain my rage any longer I threw myself at the leader of the party,  pitching into him with all the strength I could command. I pommelled him  unmercifully with my fists and he began to howl somewhat vociferously.  His comrades were too surprised at my unexpected rebellion to extend  assistance, until at last their dull wits took in the situation. I  caught a glimpse of one of the soldiers grasping his rifle. I saw it  flash in the air--I remembered no more.    When I awoke I was lying stark naked upon the floor of my cell. My head  was racking and throbbing like a hammer. Raising my hand to my forehead  I sharply withdrew it. It was quite wet, and as I looked more closely, I  saw that it was blood. I felt again and found my face clotted and my  hair reeking wet from a ragged wound on the head. Evidently the soldier  whose rifle I had seen swinging through the air, had brought it down  heavily upon my skull, felling me like an ox. How long I had lain  unconscious I never knew, but it must have been for some time, judging  from the quantity of blood I had lost, which was partially congealed on  my face, neck and shoulders. I shivered with the cold and collecting my  senses I commenced to dress my wound. For bandages I had to tear my  shirt to ribbons. I swabbed the ragged wound as well as I could, and  then bound it up. Weary and faint from loss of blood I dressed myself  with extreme difficulty and then proceeded to examine my present abode.    We are familiar with the cramped quarters at the Tower of London into  which our mediaeval sovereigns were wont to thrust our ancestors who fell  foul of authority. Wesel Prison is the German counterpart of our famous  quondam fortress-prison. The cells are little, if any, larger than those  in the Tower, and are used to this day. My residence measured about nine  feet in length by about four and a half feet in width, and was  approximately ten feet in height--about the size of the entrance hall in  an average small suburban residence. High up in the wall was a window  some two feet square. But it admitted little or no daylight. It was  heavily barred, while outside was a sloping hood which descended to a  point well below the sill, so that all the light which penetrated into  the cell was reflected from below against the black interior of the  hood. In addition there was a glazed window, filthy dirty, while even  the slight volume of light which it permitted to pass was obstructed  further by small-mesh wire netting. Consequently the interior was  wrapped in a dismal gloom throughout the greater part of the day,  through which one could scarcely discern the floor when standing  upright. After daylight waned the cell was enveloped in Cimmerian  blackness until daybreak, no lights being permitted.    The bed comprised three rough wooden planks, void of all covering and  mattress, and raised a few inches above the floor. The other  appointments were exceedingly meagre, consisting of a small jug and  basin as well as a small sanitary pan. High on the wall was a broken  shelf. That was all. The wall itself was about two feet in thickness and  wrought of masonry.    The walls themselves were covered with inscriptions written and  scratched by those who had been doomed to this depressing domicile. Some  of the drawings were beautifully executed, but the majority of the  inscriptions testified, far more eloquently than words can describe, to  the utter depravity of many of those who had preceded me, and who had  passed their last span of life on this earth within these confines.    A few minutes sufficed to take in these general features. Then my  attention was riveted upon the floor, and this told a silent, poignant  story which it would be difficult to parallel. The promenade was less  than nine feet--in fact, it was only two full paces--and barely twelve  inches in width. Consequently the occupant, as he paced to and fro, trod  always upon the same spots. And the patterings of the feet in that short  walk had worn the board into hollows at the treads. I felt those hollows  with my hands, traced their formation, and despite my unhappy plight  could not refrain from musing upon the stories which those hollows could  relate--stories of abandoned hope, frenzy, madness, resignation,  suppressed fury, and pathetic awaiting of the doom which could not be  averted.    Those hollows exercised an irresistible fascination for me, and when I  started to walk they drew my feet as certainly as the magnet attracts  the iron filings. I would strive to avoid the hollows and for a few  seconds would succeed, but within a short time my feet fell into them.  Later I learned from one of my wardens that the pacings of the criminals  condemned to this and the other cells is so persistent and ceaseless as  to demand the renewal of the boards at frequent intervals.    In the United States the third degree has attained a revolting ill-fame.  But the American third degree must be paradise in comparison with what  can only be described as its equivalent in Germany. The Teuton method is  far more effective and brutal. The man is not badgered, coaxed, and  threatened in the hope of extorting a signed confession, but he is  condemned to loneliness, silence and solitude amid a gloom which can be  felt, and which within a short time eats into your very soul. Add to  this complete deprivation of exercise and insufficient, un-nourishing,  food, and one can gather some faint idea of the effect which is wrought  upon the human body. The German idea is to wear down a man physically as  well as mentally, until at last he is brought to the verge of insanity  and collapse.
