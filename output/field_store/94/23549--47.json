A penal statute is virtually annulled if the  penalties which it imposes are regularly remitted as often as they are  incurred. The sovereign was undoubtedly competent to remit penalties  without limit. He was therefore competent to annul virtually a penal  statute. It might seem that there could be no serious objection to his  doing formally what he might do virtually. Thus, with the help of subtle  and courtly lawyers, grew up, on the doubtful frontier which separates  executive from legislative functions, that great anomaly known as the  dispensing power.    That the King could not impose taxes without the consent of Parliament  is admitted to have been, from time immemorial, a fundamental law of  England. It was among the articles which John was compelled by the  Barons to sign. Edward the First ventured to break through the rule:  but, able, powerful, and popular as he was, he encountered an opposition  to which he found it expedient to yield. He covenanted accordingly in  express terms, for himself and his heirs, that they would never again  levy any aid without the assent and goodwill of the Estates of the  realm. His powerful and victorious grandson attempted to violate this  solemn compact: but the attempt was strenuously withstood. At length the  Plantagenets gave up the point in despair: but, though they ceased to  infringe the law openly, they occasionally contrived, by evading it,  to procure an extraordinary supply for a temporary purpose. They were  interdicted from taxing; but they claimed the right of begging and  borrowing. They therefore sometimes begged in a tone not easily to be  distinguished from that of command, and sometimes borrowed with small  thought of repaying. But the fact that they thought it necessary to  disguise their exactions under the names of benevolences and loans  sufficiently proves that the authority of the great constitutional rule  was universally recognised.    The principle that the King of England was bound to conduct the  administration according to law, and that, if he did anything against  law, his advisers and agents were answerable, was established at a very  early period, as the severe judgments pronounced and executed on many  royal favourites sufficiently prove. It is, however, certain that the  rights of individuals were often violated by the Plantagenets, and that  the injured parties were often unable to obtain redress. According to  law no Englishman could be arrested or detained in confinement merely  by the mandate of the sovereign. In fact, persons obnoxious to the  government were frequently imprisoned without any other authority than  a royal order. According to law, torture, the disgrace of the Roman  jurisprudence, could not, in any circumstances, be inflicted on an  English subject. Nevertheless, during the troubles of the fifteenth  century, a rack was introduced into the Tower, and was occasionally used  under the plea of political necessity. But it would be a great error to  infer from such irregularities that the English monarchs were, either in  theory or in practice, absolute. We live in a highly civilised society,  through which intelligence is so rapidly diffused by means of the press  and of the post office that any gross act of oppression committed in  any part of our island is, in a few hours, discussed by millions. If the  sovereign were now to immure a subject in defiance of the writ of Habeas  Corpus, or to put a conspirator to the torture, the whole nation would  be instantly electrified by the news. In the middle ages the state of  society was widely different. Rarely and with great difficulty did the  wrongs of individuals come to the knowledge of the public. A man might  be illegally confined during many months in the castle of Carlisle or  Norwich; and no whisper of the transaction might reach London. It is  highly probable that the rack had been many years in use before the  great majority of the nation had the least suspicion that it was ever  employed. Nor were our ancestors by any means so much alive as we are to  the importance of maintaining great general rules. We have been taught  by long experience that we cannot without danger suffer any breach of  the constitution to pass unnoticed. It is therefore now universally held  that a government which unnecessarily exceeds its powers ought to be  visited with severe parliamentary censure, and that a government which,  under the pressure of a great exigency, and with pure intentions, has  exceeded its powers, ought without delay to apply to Parliament for an  act of indemnity. But such were not the feelings of the Englishmen of  the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. They were little disposed to  contend for a principle merely as a principle, or to cry out against an  irregularity which was not also felt to be a grievance. As long as the  general spirit of the administration was mild and popular, they  were willing to allow some latitude to their sovereign. If, for ends  generally acknowledged to be good, he exerted a vigour beyond the  law, they not only forgave, but applauded him, and while they enjoyed  security and prosperity under his rule, were but too ready to believe  that whoever had incurred his displeasure had deserved it. But to this  indulgence there was a limit; nor was that King wise who presumed far on  the forbearance of the English people. They might sometimes allow him to  overstep the constitutional line: but they also claimed the privilege  of overstepping that line themselves, whenever his encroachments were so  serious as to excite alarm. If, not content with occasionally oppressing  individuals, he cared to oppress great masses, his subjects promptly  appealed to the laws, and, that appeal failing, appealed as promptly to  the God of battles.    Our forefathers might indeed safely tolerate a king in a few excesses;  for they had in reserve a check which soon brought the fiercest and  proudest king to reason, the check of physical force. It is difficult  for an Englishman of the nineteenth century to imagine to himself the  facility and rapidity with which, four hundred years ago, this check was  applied. The people have long unlearned the use of arms. The art of  war has been carried to a perfection unknown to former ages; and the  knowledge of that art is confined to a particular class. A hundred  thousand soldiers, well disciplined and commanded, will keep down ten  millions of ploughmen and artisans. A few regiments of household troops  are sufficient to overawe all the discontented spirits of a large  capital. In the meantime the effect of the constant progress of wealth  has been to make insurrection far more terrible to thinking men than  maladministration. Immense sums have been expended on works which, if  a rebellion broke out, might perish in a few hours. The mass of movable  wealth collected in the shops and warehouses of London alone exceeds  five hundredfold that which the whole island contained in the days of  the Plantagenets; and, if the government were subverted by physical  force, all this movable wealth would be exposed to imminent risk of  spoliation and destruction. Still greater would be the risk to public  credit, on which thousands of families directly depend for subsistence,  and with which the credit of the whole commercial world is inseparably  connected. It is no exaggeration to say that a civil war of a week on  English ground would now produce disasters which would be felt from the  Hoang-ho to the Missouri, and of which the traces would be discernible  at the distance of a century. In such a state of society resistance must  be regarded as a cure more desperate than almost any malady which can  afflict the state. In the middle ages, on the contrary, resistance was  an ordinary remedy for political distempers, a remedy which was always  at hand, and which, though doubtless sharp at the moment, produced no  deep or lasting ill effects. If a popular chief raised his standard in  a popular cause, an irregular army could be assembled in a day. Regular  army there was none. Every man had a slight tincture of soldiership,  and scarcely any man more than a slight tincture. The national wealth  consisted chiefly in flocks and herds, in the harvest of the year, and  in the simple buildings inhabited by the people. All the furniture, the  stock of shops, the machinery which could be found in the realm was of  less value than the property which some single parishes now contain.  Manufactures were rude; credit was almost unknown. Society, therefore,  recovered from the shock as soon as the actual conflict was over. The  calamities of civil war were confined to the slaughter on the field of  battle, and to a few subsequent executions and confiscations. In a week  the peasant was driving his team and the esquire flying his hawks over  the field of Towton or of Bosworth, as if no extraordinary event had  interrupted the regular course of human life.    More than a hundred and sixty years have now elapsed since the English  people have by force subverted a government. During the hundred and  sixty years which preceded the union of the Roses, nine Kings reigned in  England. Six of these nine Kings were deposed. Five lost their lives  as well as their crowns. It is evident, therefore, that any comparison  between our ancient and our modern polity must lead to most erroneous  conclusions, unless large allowance be made for the effect of that  restraint which resistance and the fear of resistance constantly  imposed on the Plantagenets. As our ancestors had against tyranny a most  important security which we want, they might safely dispense with some  securities to which we justly attach the highest importance. As we  cannot, without the risk of evils from which the imagination recoils,  employ physical force as a check on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1470"],[0,"The Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan (#8)"],[1,"the gallant  Mir Mannu had been lately killed by falling from his horse. Such  had been the respect excited in men's minds towards this  excellent public servant, that the provinces of Lahor and Multan,  when ceded to the Afghans in the late reign, had been ultimately  left in his charge by the new rulers. Ahmad the Abdali even  carried on this policy after the Mir's death, and confirmed the  Government in the person of his infant son. The actual  administrators during the minority were to be the widow of Mannu  and a statesman of great local experience, whose name was Adina  Beg. This man was a Hindu by origin, a, self-made man, bold and  intelligent.    It was upon this opportunity that the Vazir resolved to strike.  Hastily raising, such a force as the poor remnant of the imperial  treasury could furnish, he marched on Lahor, taking with him the  heir apparent, Mirza Ali Gauhar. Seizing the town by a coup de  main, he possessed himself of the Lady Regent and her daughter,  and returned to Dehli, asserting that he had extorted a treaty  from the Afghan monarch, and appointed Adina Beg sole  Commissioner of the provinces.    However this may have been, the Court was not satisfied; and the  less so that the success of the Minister only served to render  him more violent and cruel than ever. Nor is it to be supposed  that Ahmad the Abdali would overlook, for any period longer than  his own convenience might require, any unauthorized interference  with arrangements made by himself for territory that he might  justly regard as his own. Accordingly the Afghan chief soon lent  a ready ear to the representations of the Emperor's party, and  swiftly presented himself at the head of an army within twenty  miles of Dehli. Accompanied by Najib Khan, (who was in secret  correspondence with the invader,) the Minister marched out to  give battle; and so complete was the isolation into which his  conduct had thrown him, that he learned for the first time what  was the true state of affairs when he saw the chief part of the  army follow Najib into the ranks of the enemy, where they were  received as expected guests.    In this strait the Minister's personal qualities saved him.  Having in the meantime made Mannu's daughter his wife, he had the  address to obtain the intercession of his mother-in-law; and not  only obtained the pardon of the invader, but in no long time so  completely ingratiated himself with that simple soldier as to be  in higher power than even before the invasion.    Ahmad Khan now took upon himself the functions of government, and  deputed the Minister to collect tribute in the Doab, while Sardar  Jahan Khan, one of his principal lieutenants, proceeded to levy  contributions from the Jats, and Ahmad himself undertook the  spoliation of the capital.    From the first expedition Ghazi returned with considerable booty.  The attack upon the Jats was not so successful; throwing  themselves into the numerous strongholds with which their country  was dotted, they defied the Afghan armies and cut off their  foraging parties in sudden sallies. Agra too made an obstinate  defence under a Moghul governor; but the invaders indemnified  themselves both in blood and plunder at the expense of the  unfortunate inhabitants of the neighbouring city of Mathra, whom  they surprised at a religious festival, and massacred without  distinction of age or sex.    As for the citizens of Dehli, their sufferings were grievous,  even compared with those inflicted twenty years before by the  Persians of Nadir Shah, in proportion as the conquerors were less  civilized, and the means of satisfying them less plentiful. All  conceivable forms of misery prevailed during the two months which  followed the entry of the Abdali, 11th September, 1757, exactly  one hundred years before the last capture of the same city by the  avenging force of the British Government during the Great Mutiny.    Having concluded these operations, the invader retired into  cantonments at Anupshahar, on the Ganges, and there proceeded to  parcel out the Empire among such of the Indian chiefs as he  delighted to honour. He then appointed Najib to the office of  Amir-ul-umra, an office which involved the personal charge of the  Palace and its inmates; and departed to his own country, from  which he had lately received some unsatisfactory intelligence.  The Emperor endeavoured to engage his influence to bring about a  marriage which he desired to contract with a daughter of the  penultimate Emperor, Muhammad Shah: but the Abdali, on his  attention being drawn to the young lady, resolved upon espousing  her himself. He at the same time married his son Timur Shah to  the daughter of the heir apparent, and, having left that son in  charge of the Panjab, retired with the bulk of his army to  Kandahar.    Relieved for the present from his anxieties, the Minister gave  sway to that morbid cruelty which detracted from the general  sagacity of his character. He protected himself against his  numerous enemies by subsidizing a vast body-guard of Mahratta  mercenaries, to pay whom he was led to the most merciless  exactions from the immediate subjects of the Empire. He easily  expelled Najib (who since his elevation must be distinguished by  his honorific name of Najib ud daula, \"Hero of the State\"): he  destroyed or kept in close confinement the nobles who favoured  the Emperor, and even sought to lay hands upon the heir apparent,  Ali Gohar.    This prince was now in his seven-and-thirtieth year, and  exhibited all those generous qualities which we find in the men  of his race as long as they are not enervated by the voluptuous  repose of the Palace. He had been for some time residing in a  kind of open arrest in the house of Ali Mardan Khan, a fortified  building on the banks of the river. Here he learned that the  Minister contemplated transferring him to the close captivity of  Salim Garh, the state prison which stood within the precincts of  the Palace. Upon this he consulted with his companions, Rajah  Ramnath and a Musalman gentleman, Saiyid Ali, who with four  private troopers agreed to join in the hazardous enterprise of  forcing their way through the bands which by this time invested  the premises. Early the following morning they descended to the  courtyard and mounted their horses in silence.    There was no time to spare. Already the bolder of the assailants  had climbed upon the neighbouring roofs, from which they began to  fire upon the little garrison, while their main forces guarded  the gateway. But it so happened that there was a breach in the  wall upon the river side, at the rear of the premises. By this  the Prince and his friends galloped out, and without a moment's  hesitation plunged their horses into the broad Jamna. One alone,  Saiyid Ali, stayed behind, and single-handed held the pursuers at  bay until the prince had made good his escape. The loyal follower  paid for his loyalty with his life. The fugitives found their way  to Sikandra, which was the centre of Najib's new fief; and the  Prince, after staying some time under the protection of the  Amir-ul-Umra, ultimately reached Lucknow, where, after a vain  attempt to procure the co-operation of the new Viceroy in an  attack upon the British, he was eventually obliged to seek the  protection of that alien power.    Ahmad the Abdali being informed of these things by letters from  Dehli, prepared a fresh incursion; the rather that Adina Beg,  with the help of the Mahrattas had at the same time chased his  son, Timur Shah, from Lahor; while with another force they had  expelled Najib from his new territory, and forced him to seek  safety in his forts in the Bawani Mahal. The new Viceroy of Audh  raised the Rohillas and his own immediate followers in the  Abdali's name; the Mahrattas were driven out of Rohilkand; and  the Afghans, crossing the Jamna in Najib's territory to the north  of Dehli, arrived once more at Anupshahar about September, 1759,  whence they were enabled to hold uninterrupted communication with  Audh.    The ruthless Ghazi was now almost at the end of his resources. He  therefore resolved to play his last card, and either win all by  the terror of his monstrous crime, or lose all, and retire from  the game.    The harmless Emperor, amongst his numerous foibles, cherished the  pardonable weakness of a respect for the religious mendicants,  who form one of the chronic plagues of Asiatic society. Taking  advantage of this, a Kashmirian in the interest of the Minister  took occasion to mention to Alamgir that a hermit of peculiar  sanctity had recently taken up his abode in the ruined fort of  Firozabad, some two miles south of the city, and (in those days)  upon the right bank of the Jamna, which river has now receded to  a considerable distance. The helpless devotee resolved to consult  with this holy man, and repaired to the ruins in his palanquin.  Arrived at the door of the room, which was in the N.E. corner of  the palace of Firoz Shah, he was relieved of his arms by the  Kashmirian, who admitted him, and closed the entrance. A cry for  aid being presently heard was gallantly responded to by Mirza  Babar, the emperor's son-in-law, who attacked and wounded the  sentry, but was overpowered and sent to Salim Garh in the  Emperor's litter. The latter meanwhile was seized by a savage  Uzbek, named Balabash, who had been stationed within, and who  sawed off the defenceless monarch's head with a knife. Then  stripping off the rich robe he cast the headless trunk out of the  window, where it lay for some hours upon the sands until the  Kashmirian ordered its removal. The date of this tragic event is  between the 10th and 30th of November, 1759 (the latter being the  day given by Dowson, vol. viii. p. 243). The late Minister,  Intizam-ud-Daula, had been murdered by order of his successor  three days earlier. A grandson of Kam Bakhsh (the unfortunate son  of Aurangzeb) was then taken"]]]
