Some people, too, have this faculty. In a  recent murder case, in the North of England, a rustic witness gave it in  her evidence that she was sure a tragedy was about to happen because she  \"smelt death in the house,\" and it made her very uneasy. Cats possessing  this peculiarity are affected in a similar manner--they are uneasy.    \"Before a death in a house I have watched a cat show gradually  increasing signs of uneasiness. It has moved from place to place, unable  to settle in any one spot for any length of time, had frequent fits of  shivering, gone to the door, sniffed the atmosphere, thrown back its  head and mewed in a low, plaintive key, and shown the greatest  reluctance to being alone in the dark.    \"This faculty--possessed by certain cats--may in some measure explain  certain of the superstitions respecting them. Take, for example, that of  cats crossing one's path predicting death.    \"The cat is drawn to the spot because it scents the phantom of death,  and cannot resist its magnetic attraction.    \"From this, it does not follow that the person who sees the cat is going  to die, but that death is overtaking someone associated with that  person; and it is in connection with the latter that the spirit of the  grave is present, employing, as a medium of prognostication, the cat,  which has been given the psychic faculty of smell that it might be so  used.    \"But although I regard this theory as very feasible, I do not attribute  to cats, with the same degree of certainty, the power to presage good  fortune, simply because I have had no experience of it myself. Yet,  adopting the same lines of argument, I see no reason why cats should not  prognosticate good as well as evil.    \"There may be phantoms representative of prosperity, in just the same  manner as there are those representative of death; they, too, may also  have some distinguishing scent (flowers have various odours, so why not  spirits?) and certain cats, i.e. white cats in particular, may be  attracted by it.    \"This becomes all the more probable when one considers how very  impressionable the cat is--how very sensitive to kindness. There are  some strangers with whom the cat will at once make friends, and others  whom it will studiously avoid. Why? The explanation, I fancy, lies once  more in the occult--in the cat's psychic faculty of smell. Kind people  attract benevolently disposed phantoms, which bring with them an  agreeably scented atmosphere, that, in turn, attracts cats. The cat  comes to one person because it knows by the smell of the atmosphere  surrounding him, or her, that it has nothing to fear--that the person is  essentially gentle and benignant. On the contrary, cruel people attract  malevolent phantoms, distinguishable also to the cat by their smell, a  smell typical of cruelty--often of homicidal lunacy (I have particularly  noticed how cats have shrunk from people who have afterwards become  dangerously insane). Is this sense of smell, then, the keynote to the  halo of mystery that has for all times surrounded the cat--that has led  to its bitter persecution--that has made it the hero of fairy lore, the  pet of old maids? I believe it is--I believe that in this psychic  faculty of smell lies, in degree, the solution to the oft-asked  riddle--why is the cat uncanny? Having then satisfied oneself on this  point, namely, that cats are in the possession of rare psychic  properties, is it likely that the Unknown Powers which have so endowed  them, should withhold from them either souls or spirits? Is it not  contrary to reason, instinct, and observation to suppose that the many  thoroughly material and grossly minded people--people whose whole beings  are steeped in money worship--we see around us every day should have  spirits, and that pretty, refined and artistic-looking cats, whose  occult powers place them in the very closest connection with the  superphysical, should not? Monstrous--the bare conception of such  incongruity in the one case, and such an omission in the other, is  inconceivable, wholly irreconcilable with the notion of any other than a  mummer of a creator--a mere court fool of a God.\"          CHAPTER II    APPARITIONS OF DOGS      One of the most extraordinary cases of hauntings by the phantasms of  dogs is related in an old Christmas number of the _Review of Reviews_,  edited by the late Mr. W.T. Stead, and entitled \"Real Ghost Stories.\"    \"The most remarkable,\" writes Mr. Stead, \"of all the stories which I  have heard concerning ghosts which touch is one that reaches me from  Darlington. I owe this, as I owe so many of the other narratives in this  collection, to the Rev. Harry Kendall, of Darlington, whose painstaking  perseverance in the collection of all matters of this kind cannot be too  highly praised. Mr. Kendall is a Congregational minister of old  standing. He was my pastor when I was editing the _Northern Echo_, and  he is the author of a remarkable book, entitled _All the World's Akin_.  The following narrative is quite unique in its way, and fortunately he  was able to get it at first hand from the only living person present.  Here we have a ghost which not only strikes the first blow, hitting a  man fair in the eye, but afterwards sets a ghostly dog upon his victim  and then disappears. The narrative was signed by Mr. James Durham as  lately as December 5th, 1890.\" Mr. Stead then proceeds to quote the  account which he had from Mr. Kendall, and which I append _ad verbum_  from the _Review of Reviews_. It is as follows: \"I was night watchman at  the old Darlington and Stockton Station at the town of Darlington, a few  yards from the first station that ever existed. I was there fifteen  years. I used to go on duty about 8 p.m. and come off at 6 a.m. I had  been there a little while--perhaps two or three years--and about forty  years ago. One night during winter at about 12 o'clock or 12.30 I was  feeling rather cold with standing here and there; I said to myself, 'I  will away down and get something to eat.' There was a porter's cellar  where a fire was kept on and a coal-house was connected with it. So I  went down the steps, took off my overcoat, and had just sat down on the  bench opposite the fire and turned up the gas when a strange man came  out of the coal-house, followed by a big black retriever. As soon as he  entered my eye was upon him, and his eye upon me, and we were intently  watching each other as he moved on to the front of the fire. There he  stood looking at me, and a curious smile came over his countenance. He  had a stand-up collar and a cut-away coat with gilt buttons and a Scotch  cap. All at once he struck at me, and I had the impression that he hit  me. I up with my fist and struck back at him. My fist seemed to go  through him and struck against the stone above the fireplace, and  knocked the skin off my knuckles. The man seemed to be struck back into  the fire, and uttered a strange, unearthly squeak. Immediately the dog  gripped me by the calf of my leg, and seemed to cause me pain. The man  recovered his position, called off the dog with a sort of click of the  tongue, then went back into the coal-house, followed by the dog. I  lighted my dark lantern and looked into the coal-house, but there was  neither dog nor man, and no outlet for them except the one by which they  had entered.    \"I was satisfied that what I had seen was ghostly, and it accounted for  the fact that when the man had first come into the place where he sat I  had not challenged him with any enquiry. Next day, and for several  weeks, my account caused quite a commotion, and a host of people spoke  to me about it; among the rest old Edward Pease, father of railways, and  his three sons, John, Joseph, and Henry. Old Edward sent for me to his  house and asked me all particulars. He and others put this question to  me: \"Are you sure you were not asleep and had the nightmare?\" My answer  was quite sure, for I had not been a minute in the cellar, and was just  going to get something to eat. I was certainly not under the influence  of strong drink, for I was then, as I have been for forty-nine years, a  teetotaler. My mind at the time was perfectly free from trouble. What  increased the excitement was the fact that a man a number of years  before, who was employed in the office of the station, had committed  suicide, and his body had been carried into this very cellar. I knew  nothing of this circumstance, nor of the body of the man, but Mr. Pease  and others who had known him, told me my description exactly  corresponded to his appearance and the way he dressed, and also that he  had a black retriever just like the one which gripped me. I should add  that no mark or effect remained on the spot where I seemed to be seized.                        \"(Signed) JAMES DURHAM.  \"_Dec. 9th, 1890._\"    Following the above statement Mr. Stead appends Mr. Kendall's reasons  for believing that what James Durham experienced was objective psychic  phenomena, and neither produced during sleep nor by hallucination.    The arguments used strike me as being so concise and sensible that I  think it will not be out of place to reproduce them.    \"First,\" Mr. Kendall says, \"he (James Durham) was accustomed as watchman  to be up all night, and therefore not likely from that cause to feel  sleepy. Secondly, he had scarcely been a minute in the cellar, and,  feeling hungry, was just going to get something to eat. Thirdly, if he  was asleep at the beginning of the vision, he must have been awake  enough during the latter part of it when he had knocked the skin off his  knuckles. Fourthly, there was his own"]]]
