[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17408"],[0,"The Florentine Painters of the Renaissance (#8)"],[1,"  who makes us see objects miles away with as great a precision and with  as much intensity of local colour as if we were standing off from them a  few feet. Were landscape really this, then nothing more inartistic than  gradation of tint, atmosphere, and _plein air_, all of which help to  make distant objects less clear, and therefore tend in no way to  heighten our sense of capacity. But as a matter of fact the pleasure we  take in actual landscape is only to a limited extent an affair of the  eye, and to a great extent one of unusually intense well-being. The  painter's problem, therefore, is not merely to render the tactile values  of the visible objects, but to convey, more rapidly and unfailingly than  nature would do, _the consciousness_ of an unusually intense degree of  well-being. This task--the communication by means purely visual of  feelings occasioned chiefly by sensations non-visual--is of such  difficulty that, until recently, successes in the rendering of what is  peculiar to landscape as an art, and to landscape alone, were accidental  and sporadic. Only now, in our own days, may painting be said to be  grappling with this problem seriously; and perhaps we are already at the  dawn of an art which will have to what has hitherto been called  landscape, the relation of our music to the music of the Greeks or of  the Middle Ages.    [Page heading: VERROCCHIO'S LANDSCAPES]    Verrocchio was, among Florentines at least, the first to feel that a  faithful reproduction of the contours is not landscape, that the  painting of nature is an art distinct from the painting of the figure.  He scarcely knew where the difference lay, but felt that light and  atmosphere play an entirely different part in each, and that in  landscape these have at least as much importance as tactile values. A  vision of _plein air_, vague I must grant, seems to have hovered before  him, and, feeling his powerlessness to cope with it in full effects of  light such as he attempted in his earlier pictures, he deliberately  chose the twilight hour, when, in Tuscany, on fine days, the trees stand  out almost black against a sky of light opalescent grey. To render this  subduing, soothing effect of the coolness and the dew after the glare  and dust of the day--the effect so matchlessly given in Gray's  \"Elegy\"--seemed to be his first desire as a painter, and in presence of  his \"Annunciation\" (in the Uffizi), we feel that he succeeded as only  one other Tuscan succeeded after him, that other being his own pupil  Leonardo.      X.    [Page heading: GENRE ARTISTS]    It is a temptation to hasten on from Pollaiuolo and Verrocchio to  Botticelli and Leonardo, to men of genius as artists reappearing again  after two generations, men who accomplished with scarcely an effort what  their precursors had been toiling after. But from these it would be even  more difficult than at present to turn back to painters of scarcely any  rank among the world's great artists, and of scarcely any importance as  links in a chain of evolution, but not to be passed by, partly because  of certain qualities they do possess, and partly because their names  would be missed in an account, even so brief as this, of Florentine  painting. The men I chiefly refer to, one most active toward the middle  and the other toward the end of the fifteenth century, are Benozzo  Gozzoli and Domenico Ghirlandaio. Although they have been rarely coupled  together, they have much in common. Both were, as artists, little more  than mediocrities with almost no genuine feeling for what makes painting  a great art. The real attractiveness of both lies entirely outside the  sphere of pure art, in the realms of _genre_ illustration. And here the  likeness between them ends; within their common ground they differed  widely.    [Page heading: BENOZZO GOZZOLI]    Benozzo was gifted with a rare facility not only of execution but of  invention, with a spontaneity, a freshness, a liveliness in telling a  story that wake the child in us, and the lover of the fairy tale. Later  in life, his more precious gifts deserted him, but who wants to resist  the fascination of his early works, painted, as they seem, by a Fra  Angelico who had forgotten heaven and become enamoured of the earth and  the spring-time? In his Riccardi Palace frescoes, he has sunk already to  portraying the Florentine apprentice's dream of a holiday in the country  on St. John's Day; but what a _naif_ ideal of luxury and splendour it  is! With these, the glamour in which he saw the world began to fade away  from him, and in his Pisan frescoes we have, it is true, many a quaint  bit of _genre_ (superior to Teniers only because of superior  associations), but never again the fairy tale. And as the better  recedes, it is replaced by the worse, by the bane of all _genre_  painting, non-significant detail, and positive bad taste. Have London  or New York or Berlin worse to show us than the jumble of buildings in  his ideal of a great city, his picture of Babylon? It may be said he  here continues mediaeval tradition, which is quite true, but this very  fact indicates his real place, which, in spite of his adopting so many  of the fifteenth-century improvements, is not with the artists of the  Renaissance, but with the story-tellers and costumed fairy-tale painters  of the transition, with Spinello Aretino and Gentile da Fabriano, for  instance. And yet, once in a while, he renders a head with such  character, or a movement with such ease that we wonder whether he had  not in him, after all, the making of a real artist.    [Page heading: GHIRLANDAIO]    Ghirlandaio was born to far more science and cunning in painting than  was current in Benozzo's early years, and all that industry, all that  love of his occupation, all that talent even, can do for a man, they did  for him; but unfortunately he had not a spark of genius. He appreciated  Masaccio's tactile values, Pollaiuolo's movement, Verrocchio's effects  of light, and succeeded in so sugaring down what he adopted from these  great masters that the superior philistine of Florence could say: \"There  now is a man who knows as much as any of the great men, but can give me  something that I can really enjoy!\" Bright colour, pretty faces, good  likenesses, and the obvious everywhere--attractive and delightful, it  must be granted, but, except in certain single figures, never  significant. Let us glance a moment at his famous frescoes in Santa  Maria Novella. To begin with, they are so undecorative that, in spite of  the tone and surface imparted to them by four centuries, they still  suggest so many _tableaux vivants_ pushed into the wall side by side,  and in tiers. Then the compositions are as overfilled as the sheets of  an illustrated newspaper--witness the \"Massacre of the Innocents,\" a  scene of such magnificent artistic possibilities. Finally, irrelevant  episodes and irrelevant groups of portraits do what they can to distract  our attention from all higher significance. Look at the \"Birth of John\";  Ginevra dei Benci stands there, in the very foreground, staring out at  you as stiff as if she had a photographer's iron behind her head. An  even larger group of Florentine housewives in all their finery  disfigures the \"Birth of the Virgin,\" which is further spoiled by a _bas  relief_ to show off the painter's acquaintance with the antique, and by  the figure of the serving maid who pours out water, with the rush of a  whirlwind in her skirts--this to show off skill in the rendering of  movement. Yet elsewhere, as in his \"Epiphany\" in the Uffizi, Ghirlandaio  has undeniable charm, and occasionally in portraits his talent, here at  its highest, rises above mediocrity, in one instance, the fresco of  Sassetti in Santa Trinita, becoming almost genius.      XI.    [Page heading: LEONARDO]    All that Giotto and Masaccio had attained in the rendering of tactile  values, all that Fra Angelico or Filippo had achieved in expression, all  that Pollaiuolo had accomplished in movement, or Verrocchio in light and  shade, Leonardo, without the faintest trace of that tentativeness, that  painfulness of effort which characterised his immediate precursors,  equalled or surpassed. Outside Velasquez, and perhaps, when at their  best, Rembrandt and Degas, we shall seek in vain for tactile values so  stimulating and so convincing as those of his \"Mona Lisa\"; outside  Degas, we shall not find such supreme mastery over the art of movement  as in the unfinished \"Epiphany\" in the Uffizi; and if Leonardo has been  left far behind as a painter of light, no one has succeeded in conveying  by means of light and shade a more penetrating feeling of mystery and  awe than he in his \"Virgin of the Rocks.\" Add to all this, a feeling for  beauty and significance that have scarcely ever been approached. Where  again youth so poignantly attractive, manhood so potently virile, old  age so dignified and possessed of the world's secrets! Who like Leonardo  has depicted the mother's happiness in her child and the child's joy in  being alive; who like Leonardo has portrayed the timidity, the newness  to experience, the delicacy and refinement of maidenhood; or the  enchantress intuitions, the inexhaustible fascination of the woman in  her years of mastery? Look at his many sketches for Madonnas, look at  his profile drawing of Isabella d'Este, or at the _Belle Joconde_, and  see whether elsewhere you find their equals. Leonardo is the one artist  of whom it may be said with perfect literalness: Nothing that he touched  but turned into a thing of eternal beauty. Whether it be the  cross-section of a skull, the structure of a weed, or a study of  muscles, he, with his feeling for line and for light and shade, forever  transmuted it into life-communicating values; and all without intention,  for most of these magical sketches were dashed off to illustrate purely  scientific matter, which alone absorbed his mind at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17412"],[0,"The Bobbsey Twins (#8)"],[1,"up  again with another load of people. As he had not seen it go down he  concluded that he must go down by way of the stairs if he wanted another  ride.    \"I'll get a ride all by myself,\" he thought, and as quickly as he could,  he slipped down first one pair of stairs and then another, to the ground  floor of the store. Then he saw another stairs, and soon was in the  basement of the department store.    Here was a hardware department with a great number of heavy toys, and  soon he was looking at a circular railroad track upon which ran a real  locomotive and three cars. This was certainly a wonderful toy, and  Freddie could not get his eyes off of it.    In moving around the basement of the store, Freddie grew hopelessly  mixed up, and when he started to look for the elevator or the stairs, he  walked to the storage room. He was too timid to ask his way out and  soon found himself among great rows of boxes and barrels. Then he made a  turn or two and found himself in another room, filled with empty boxes  and casks, some partly filled with straw and excelsior. There was a big  wooden door to this room, and while he was inside the door shut with a  bang and the catch fell into place.    \"Oh, dear, I wish I was back with mamma,\" he thought, and drew a long  and exceedingly sober breath. \"I don't like it here at all.\"    Just then a little black kitten came toward him and brushed up  affectionately. Freddie caught the kitten and sat down for a moment to  pet it. He now felt sleepy and in a few minutes his eyes closed and his  head began to nod. Then in a minute more he went sound asleep.    Long before this happened Mrs. Bobbsey found Flossie and asked her where  Freddie was. The little girl could not tell, and the mother began a  diligent search. The floor-walkers in the big store aided her, but it  was of no avail. Freddie could not be found, and soon it was time to  close up the establishment for the day. Almost frantic with fear, Mrs.  Bobbsey telephoned to her husband, telling him of what had occurred and  asked him what had best be done.          CHAPTER X    LOST AND FOUND      When Freddie woke up all was very, very dark around him. At first he  thought he was at home, and he called out for somebody to pull up the  curtain that he might see.    But nobody answered him, and all he heard was a strange purring, close  to his ear. He put up his hand and touched the little black kitten,  which was lying close to his face. He had tumbled back in the straw and  this had proved a comfortable couch upon which to take a nap.    \"Oh, dear me, I'll have to get back to mamma!\" he murmured, as he  struggled up and rubbed his eyes. \"What can make it so awful dark? They  ought to light the gas. Nobody can buy things when it's so dark as  this.\"    The darkness did not please him, and he was glad to have the black  kitten for a companion. With the kitten in his arms he arose to his  feet and walked a few steps. Bump! he went into a big box. Then he went  in another direction and stumbled over a barrel.    \"Mamma! Mamma!\" he cried out. \"Mamma, where are you?\"    No answer came back to this call, and his own voice sounded so queer to  him that he soon stopped. He hugged the kitten tighter than ever.    He was now greatly frightened and it was all he could do to keep back  the tears. He knew it must be night and that the great store must be  closed up.    \"They have all gone home and left me here alone,\" he thought. \"Oh, what  shall I do?\"    He knew the night was generally very long and he did not wish to remain  in the big, lonely building until morning.    Still hugging the kitten, he felt his way around until he reached the  big wooden door. The catch came open with ease, and once more he found  himself in that part of the basement used for hardware and large  mechanical toys. But the toy locomotive had ceased to run and all was  very silent. Only a single gas jet flickered overhead, and this cast  fantastic shadows which made the little boy think of ghosts and  hobgoblins. One mechanical toy had a very large head on it, and this  seemed to grin and laugh at him as he looked at it.    \"Mamma!\" he screamed again. \"Oh, mamma, why don't you come?\"    He listened and presently he heard footsteps overhead.    \"Who's there?\" came in the heavy voice of a man.    The voice sounded so unnatural that Freddie was afraid to answer.  Perhaps the man might be a burglar come to rob the store.    \"I say, who's there?\" repeated the voice. \"Answer me.\"    There was a minute of silence, and then Freddie heard the footsteps  coming slowly down the stairs. The man had a lantern in one hand and a  club in the other.    Not knowing what else to do, Freddie crouched behind a counter. His  heart beat loudly, and he had dim visions of burglars who might have  entered the big store to rob it. If he was discovered, there was no  telling what such burglars might do with him.    \"Must have been the cat,\" murmured the man on the stairs. He reached the  basement floor and swung his lantern over his head. \"Here, kittie,  kittie, kittie!\" he called.    \"Meow!\" came from the black kitten, which was still in Freddie's arms.  Then the man looked in that direction.    \"Hullo!\" he exclaimed, starting in amazement. \"What are you doing here?  Are you alone?\"    \"Oh, please, I want my mamma!\" cried Freddie.    \"You want your mamma?\" repeated the man. \"Say!\" he went on suddenly.  \"Are you the kid that got lost this afternoon, youngster?\"    \"I guess I did get lost,\" answered Freddie. He saw that the man had a  kindly face and this made him a bit braver. \"I walked around and sat  down over there--in the straw--and went to sleep.\"    \"Well, I never!\" cried the man. \"And have you been down here ever  since?\"    \"Yes, sir. But I don't want to stay--I want to go home.\"    \"All right, you shall go. But this beats me!\"    \"Are you the man who owns the store?\" questioned Freddie curiously.    At this the man laughed. \"No; wish I did. I'm the night watchman. Let me  see, what is your name?\"    \"Freddie Bobbsey. My papa owns the lumber yard.\"    \"Oh, yes, I remember now. Well, Freddie, I reckon your papa will soon  come after you. All of 'em are about half crazy, wondering what has  become of you.\"    The night watchman led the way to the first floor of the department  store and Freddie followed, still clutching the black kitten, which  seemed well content to remain with him.    \"I'll telephone to your papa,\" said the watchman, and going into one of  the offices he rang the bell and called up the number of the Bobbsey  residence.    In the meantime Mrs. Bobbsey and the others of the family were almost  frantic with grief and alarm. Mr. Bobbsey had notified the police and  the town had been searched thoroughly for some trace of the missing boy.    \"Perhaps they have stolen Freddie away!\" said Nan, with the tears  starting to her eyes. \"Some gypsies were in town, telling fortunes. I  heard one of the girls at school tell about it.\"    \"Oh, the bad gypsies!\" cried Flossie, and gave a shudder. The idea that  Freddie might have been carried off by the gypsies was truly terrifying.    Mr. Bobbsey had been out a dozen times to the police headquarters and to  the lake front. A report had come in that a boy looking like Freddie had  been seen on the ice early in the evening, and he did not know but what  the little fellow might have wandered in that direction.    When the telephone bell rang Mr. Bobbsey had just come in from another  fruitless search. Both he and his wife ran to the telephone.    \"Hullo!\" came over the wire. \"Is this Mr. Bobbsey's house?\"    \"It is,\" answered the gentleman quickly. \"What do you want? Have you any  news?\"    \"I've found your little boy, sir,\" came back the reply. \"He is safe and  sound with me.\"    \"And who are you?\"    \"The night watchman at the department store. He went to sleep here,  that's all.\"    At this news all were overjoyed.    \"Let me speak to him,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey eagerly. \"Freddie dear, are you  there?\" she asked.    \"Yes, mamma,\" answered Freddie, into the telephone. \"And I want to come  home.\"    \"You shall, dear. Papa shall come for you at once.\"    \"Oh, he's found! He's found!\" shrieked Nan. \"Aren't you glad, Bert?\"    \"Of course I am,\" answered Bert. \"But I can't understand how he happened  to go to sleep in such a lively store as that.\"    \"He must have walked around until he got tired,\" replied Nan. \"You know  Freddie can drop off to sleep very quickly when he gets tired.\"    As soon as possible Mr. Bobbsey drove around to the department store in  his sleigh. The watchman and Freddie were on the look-out for him, the  little boy with the kitten still in his arms.    \"Oh, papa!\" cried Freddie. \"I am so glad you have come! I--I don't want  to go to sleep here again!\"    The watchman's story was soon told, and Mr. Bobbsey made him happy by  presenting him with a two-dollar bill.    \"The little chap would have been even more lonely if it hadn't been for  the kitten,\" said the man. \"He wanted to keep the thing, so I told him  to do it.\"    \"And I'm going to,\" said Freddie proudly. \"It's just the dearest kitten  in the world.\" And keep the kitten he did. It soon grew to be a big, fat  cat and was called Snoop.    By the time home was reached, Freddie was sleepy again. But he speedily  woke up when his mamma and the others embraced him, and then he had to  tell the story of his adventure from end to end.    \"I do not know as I shall take you with me again,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey.  \"You have given us all a great scare.\"    \"Oh, mamma, I won't leave you like that again,\" cried Freddie quickly.  \"Don't like to be in the dark 'tall,\" he added.    \"Oh, it must have been awful,\" said Flossie. \"Didn't you see any--any  ghosts?\"    \"Barrels of them,\" said Freddie, nodding his head sleepily. \"But they  didn't touch me. Guess they was sleepy, just like me.\" And then he  dropped off and had to be put to bed; and that was the end of this  "]]]
