Say: O God, my God! Thou beholdest me circling round Thy Will with mine  eyes turned towards the horizon of Thy bounty, eagerly awaiting the  revelation of the effulgent splendours of the sun of Thy favours. I beg of  Thee, O Beloved of every understanding heart and the Desire of such as  have near access unto Thee, to grant that Thy loved ones may become wholly  detached from their own inclinations, holding fast unto that which  pleaseth Thee. Attire them, O Lord, with the robe of righteousness and  illumine them with the splendours of the light of detachment. Summon then  to their assistance the hosts of wisdom and utterance that they may exalt  Thy Word amongst Thy creatures and proclaim Thy Cause amidst Thy servants.  Verily, potent art Thou to do what Thou willest, and within Thy grasp lie  the reins of all affairs. No God is there but Thee, the Mighty, the  Ever-Forgiving.    O thou who hast turned thy gaze towards My face! In these days there  occurred that which hath plunged Me into dire sadness. Certain wrong-doers  who profess allegiance to the Cause of God committed such deeds as have  caused the limbs of sincerity, of honesty, of justice, of equity to quake.  One known individual to whom the utmost kindness and favour had been  extended perpetrated such acts as have brought tears to the eye of God.  Formerly We uttered words of warning and premonition, then for a number of  years We kept the matter secret that haply he might take heed and repent.  But all to no purpose. In the end he bent his energies upon vilifying the  Cause of God before the eyes of all men. He tore the veil of fairness  asunder and felt sympathy neither for himself nor for the Cause of God.  Now, however, the deeds of certain individuals have brought sorrows far  more grievous than those which the deeds of the former had caused. Beseech  thou God, the True One, that He may graciously enable the heedless to  retract and repent. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Bountiful, the Most  Generous.    In these days it is incumbent upon everyone to adhere tenaciously unto  unity and concord and to labour diligently in promoting the Cause of God,  that perchance the wayward souls may attain that which will lead unto  abiding prosperity.    In brief, dissensions among various sects have opened the way to weakness.  Each sect hath picked out a way for itself and is clinging to a certain  cord. Despite manifest blindness and ignorance they pride themselves on  their insight and knowledge. Among them are mystics who bear allegiance to  the Faith of Islam, some of whom indulge in that which leadeth to idleness  and seclusion. I swear by God! It lowereth man's station and maketh him  swell with pride. Man must bring forth fruit. One who yieldeth no fruit  is, in the words of the Spirit,(13) like unto a fruitless tree, and a  fruitless tree is fit but for the fire.    That which the aforesaid persons have mentioned concerning the stations of  Divine Unity will conduce in no small measure to idleness and vain  imaginings. These mortal men have evidently set aside the differences of  station and have come to regard themselves as God, while God is  immeasurably exalted above all things. Every created being however  revealeth His signs which are but emanations from Him and not His Own  Self. All these signs are reflected and can be seen in the book of  existence, and the scrolls that depict the shape and pattern of the  universe are indeed a most great book. Therein every man of insight can  perceive that which would lead to the Straight Path and would enable him  to attain the Great Announcement. Consider the rays of the sun whose light  hath encompassed the world. The rays emanate from the sun and reveal its  nature, but are not the sun itself. Whatsoever can be discerned on earth  amply demonstrateth the power of God, His knowledge and the outpourings of  His bounty, while He Himself is immeasurably exalted above all creatures.    Christ saith: 'Thou hast granted to children that whereof the learned and  the wise are deprived.' The sage of Sabzivar(14) hath said: 'Alas!  Attentive ears are lacking, otherwise the whisperings of the Sinaic Bush  could be heard from every tree.' In a Tablet to a man of wisdom who had  made enquiry as to the meaning of Elementary Reality, We addressed this  famous sage in these words: 'If this saying is truly thine, how is it that  thou hast failed to hearken unto the Call which the Tree of Man hath  raised from the loftiest heights of the world? If thou didst hear the Call  yet fear and the desire to preserve thy life prompted thee to remain  heedless to it, thou art such a person as hath never been nor is worthy of  mention; if thou hast not heard it, then thou art bereft of the sense of  hearing.' In brief, such men are they whose words are the pride of the  world, and whose deeds are the shame of the nations.    Verily We have sounded the Trumpet which is none other than My Pen of  Glory, and lo, mankind hath swooned away before it, save them whom God  pleaseth to deliver as a token of His grace. He is the Lord of bounty, the  Ancient of Days.    Say: O concourse of divines! Pronounce ye censure against this Pen unto  which, as soon as it raised its shrill voice, the kingdom of utterance  prepared itself to hearken, and before whose mighty and glorious theme  every other theme hath paled into insignificance? Fear ye God and follow  not your idle fancies and corrupt imaginings, but rather follow Him Who is  come unto you invested with undeniable knowledge and unshakeable  certitude.    Glorified be God! Man's treasure is his utterance, yet this Wronged One  hath withheld His Tongue, for the disbelievers are lying in ambush;  however, protection is afforded by God, the Lord of all worlds. Verily, in  Him have We placed Our trust and unto Him have We committed all affairs.  All-Sufficient is He for Us and for all created things. He is the One by  Whose leave, and through the potency of Whose command, the Day-Star of  sovereign might hath shone resplendent above the horizon of the world.  Well is it with him who perceiveth and recognizeth the Truth and woe  betide the froward and the faithless.    This Wronged One hath invariably treated the wise with affection. By the  wise is meant men whose knowledge is not confined to mere words and whose  lives have been fruitful and have produced enduring results. It is  incumbent upon everyone to honour these blessed souls. Happy are they that  observe God's precepts; happy are they that have recognized the Truth;  happy are they that judge with fairness in all matters and hold fast to  the Cord of My inviolable Justice.    The people of Persia have turned away from Him Who is the Protector and  the Helper. They are clinging to and have enmeshed themselves in the vain  imaginings of the foolish. So firmly do they adhere to superstitions that  naught can sever them therefrom save the potent arm of God--exalted is His  glory. Beseech thou the Almighty that He may remove with the fingers of  divine power the veils which have shut out the divers peoples and  kindreds, that they may attain the things that are conducive to security,  progress and advancement and may hasten forth towards the incomparable  Friend.    The word of God which the Abha Pen hath revealed and inscribed on the                                   _first leaf_    of the Most Exalted Paradise is this: Verily I say: The fear of God hath  ever been a sure defence and a safe stronghold for all the peoples of the  world. It is the chief cause of the protection of mankind, and the supreme  instrument for its preservation. Indeed, there existeth in man a faculty  which deterreth him from, and guardeth him against, whatever is unworthy  and unseemly, and which is known as his sense of shame. This, however, is  confined to but a few; all have not possessed and do not possess it.    The word of God which the Supreme Pen hath recorded on the                                  _second leaf_    of the Most Exalted Paradise is the following: The Pen of the Most High  exhorteth, at this moment, the manifestations of authority and the sources  of power, namely the kings, the sovereigns, the presidents, the rulers,  the divines and the wise, and enjoineth them to uphold the cause of  religion, and to cleave unto it. Religion is verily the chief instrument  for the establishment of order in the world and of tranquillity amongst  its peoples. The weakening of the pillars of religion hath strengthened  the foolish and emboldened them and made them more arrogant. Verily I say:  The greater the decline of religion, the more grievous the waywardness of  the ungodly. This cannot but lead in the end to chaos and confusion. Hear  Me, O men of insight, and be warned, ye who are endued with discernment!    The word of God which the Supreme Pen hath recorded on the                                   _third leaf_    of the Most Exalted Paradise is this: O son of man! If thine eyes be  turned towards mercy, forsake the things that profit thee and cleave unto  that which will profit mankind. And if thine eyes be turned towards  justice, choose thou for thy neighbour that which thou choosest for  thyself. Humility exalteth man to the heaven of glory and power, whilst  pride abaseth him to the depths of wretchedness and degradation.    O people of God! Great is the Day and mighty the Call! In one of Our  Tablets We have revealed these exalted words: 'Were the world of the  spirit to be wholly converted into the sense of hearing, it could then  claim to be worthy to hearken unto the Voice that calleth from the Supreme  Horizon; for otherwise, these ears that are defiled with lying tales have  never been, nor are they now, fit to hear it.' Well is it with them that  hearken; and woe betide the wayward.

It's early in the day for a constable on duty not to be  able to trust his own eyes. As to the other one, the less said the  better; he keeps the Saracen's Head, and he knows best what his liquor's  like.\"    [Illustration: He said, \"Now then!\" to the policeman and Mr. Peasemarsh]    \"Take them away, for goodness' sake,\" said the inspector crossly. But as  they left the police-station he said, \"Now then!\" to the policeman and  Mr. Peasemarsh, and he said it twenty times as crossly as he had spoken  to Martha.           *       *       *       *       *    Martha was as good as her word. She took them home in a very grand  carriage, because the carrier's cart was gone, and, though she had stood  by them so nobly with the police, she was so angry with them as soon as  they were alone for \"trapesing into Rochester by themselves,\" that none  of them dared to mention the old man with the pony-cart from the  village who was waiting for them in Rochester. And so, after one day of  boundless wealth, the children found themselves sent to bed in deep  disgrace, and only enriched by two pairs of cotton gloves, dirty inside  because of the state of the hands they had been put on to cover, an  imitation crocodile-skin purse, and twelve penny buns, long since  digested.    The thing that troubled them most was the fear that the old gentleman's  guinea might have disappeared at sunset with all the rest, so they went  down to the village next day to apologise for not meeting him in  Rochester, and to _see_. They found him very friendly. The guinea had  not disappeared, and he had bored a hole in it and hung it on his  watch-chain. As for the guinea the baker took, the children felt they  _could_ not care whether it had vanished or not, which was not perhaps  very honest, but on the other hand was not wholly unnatural. But  afterwards this preyed on Anthea's mind, and at last she secretly sent  twelve postage stamps by post to \"Mr. Beale, Baker, Rochester.\" Inside  she wrote, \"To pay for the buns.\" I hope the guinea did disappear, for  that baker was really not at all a nice man, and, besides, penny buns  are seven for sixpence in all really respectable shops.          CHAPTER III    BEING WANTED      The morning after the children had been the possessors of boundless  wealth, and had been unable to buy anything really useful or enjoyable  with it, except two pairs of cotton gloves, twelve penny buns, an  imitation crocodile-skin purse, and a ride in a pony-cart, they awoke  without any of the enthusiastic happiness which they had felt on the  previous day when they remembered how they had had the luck to find a  Psammead, or Sand-fairy, and to receive its promise to grant them a new  wish every day. For now they had had two wishes, Beauty and Wealth, and  neither had exactly made them happy. But the happening of strange  things, even if they are not completely pleasant things, is more amusing  than those times when nothing happens but meals, and they are not always  completely pleasant, especially on the days when it is cold mutton or  hash.    There was no chance of talking things over before breakfast, because  everyone overslept itself, as it happened, and it needed a vigorous and  determined struggle to get dressed so as to be only ten minutes late for  breakfast. During this meal some efforts were made to deal with the  question of the Psammead in an impartial spirit, but it is very  difficult to discuss anything thoroughly and at the same time to attend  faithfully to your baby brother's breakfast needs. The Baby was  particularly lively that morning. He not only wriggled his body through  the bar of his high chair, and hung by his head, choking and purple, but  he seized a tablespoon with desperate suddenness, hit Cyril heavily on  the head with it, and then cried because it was taken away from him. He  put his fat fist in his bread-and-milk, and demanded \"nam,\" which was  only allowed for tea. He sang, he put his feet on the table--he  clamoured to \"go walky.\" The conversation was something like this--    \"Look here--about that Sand-fairy---- Look out!--he'll have the milk  over.\"    Milk removed to a safe distance.    \"Yes--about that Fairy---- No, Lamb dear, give Panther the narky poon.\"    Then Cyril tried. \"Nothing we've had yet has turned out---- He nearly  had the mustard that time!\"    \"I wonder whether we'd better wish---- Hullo!--you've done it now, my  boy!\" And in a flash of glass and pink baby-paws, the bowl of golden  carp in the middle of the table rolled on its side and poured a flood of  mixed water and gold-fish into the Baby's lap and into the laps of the  others.    Everyone was almost as much upset as the gold-fish; the Lamb only  remaining calm. When the pool on the floor had been mopped up, and the  leaping, gasping gold-fish had been collected and put back in the water,  the Baby was taken away to be entirely re-dressed by Martha, and most of  the others had to change completely. The pinafores and jackets that had  been bathed in gold-fish-and-water were hung out to dry, and then it  turned out that Jane must either mend the dress she had torn the day  before or appear all day in her best petticoat. It was white and soft  and frilly, and trimmed with lace, and very, very pretty, quite as  pretty as a frock, if not more so. Only it was _not_ a frock, and  Martha's word was law. She wouldn't let Jane wear her best frock, and  she refused to listen for a moment to Robert's suggestion that Jane  should wear her best petticoat and call it a dress.    \"It's not respectable,\" she said. And when people say that, it's no use  anyone's saying anything. You'll find this out for yourselves some day.    So there was nothing for it but for Jane to mend her frock. The hole had  been torn the day before when she happened to tumble down in the High  Street of Rochester, just where a water-cart had passed on its silvery  way. She had grazed her knee, and her stocking was much more than  grazed, and her dress was cut by the same stone which had attended to  the knee and the stocking. Of course the others were not such sneaks as  to abandon a comrade in misfortune, so they all sat on the grass-plot  round the sun-dial, and Jane darned away for dear life. The Lamb was  still in the hands of Martha having its clothes changed, so conversation  was possible.    Anthea and Robert timidly tried to conceal their inmost thought, which  was that the Psammead was not to be trusted; but Cyril said--    \"Speak out--say what you've got to say--I hate hinting, and 'don't  know,' and sneakish ways like that.\"    So then Robert said, as in honour bound, \"Sneak yourself--Anthea and me  weren't so gold-fishy as you two were, so we got changed quicker, and  we've had time to think it over, and if you ask me\"--    \"I didn't ask you,\" said Jane, biting off a needleful of thread as she  had always been strictly forbidden to do. (Perhaps you don't know that  if you bite off ends of cotton and swallow them they wind tight round  your heart and kill you? My nurse told me this, and she told me also  about the earth going round the sun. Now what is one to believe--what  with nurses and science?)    \"I don't care who asks or who doesn't,\" said Robert, \"but Anthea and I  think the Sammyadd is a spiteful brute. If it can give us our wishes I  suppose it can give itself its own, and I feel almost sure it wishes  every time that our wishes shan't do us any good. Let's let the tiresome  beast alone, and just go and have a jolly good game of forts, on our  own, in the chalk-pit.\"    (You will remember that the happily-situated house where these children  were spending their holidays lay between a chalk-quarry and a  gravel-pit.)    Cyril and Jane were more hopeful--they generally were.    \"I don't think the Sammyadd does it on purpose,\" Cyril said; \"and, after  all, it _was_ silly to wish for boundless wealth. Fifty pounds in  two-shilling pieces would have been much more sensible. And wishing to  be beautiful as the day was simply donkeyish. I don't want to be  disagreeable, but it _was_. We must try to find a really useful wish,  and wish it.\"    Jane dropped her work and said--    \"I think so too, it's too silly to have a chance like this and not use  it. I never heard of anyone else outside a book who had such a chance;  there must be simply heaps of things we could wish for that wouldn't  turn out Dead Sea fish, like these two things have. Do let's think hard  and wish something nice, so that we can have a real jolly day--what  there is left of it.\"    Jane darned away again like mad, for time was indeed getting on, and  everyone began to talk at once. If you had been there you could not  possibly have made head or tail of the talk, but these children were  used to talking \"by fours,\" as soldiers march, and each of them could  say what it had to say quite comfortably, and listen to the agreeable  sound of its own voice, and at the same time have three-quarters of two  sharp ears to spare for listening to what the others said. That is an  easy example in multiplication of vulgar fractions, but, as I daresay  you can't do even that, I won't ask you to tell me whether 3/4 x 2 =  1-1/2, but I will ask you to believe me that this was the amount of ear  each child was able to lend to the others. Lending ears was common in  Roman times, as we learn from Shakespeare; but I fear I am getting too  instructive.    When the frock was darned, the start for the gravel-pit was delayed by  Martha's insisting on everybody's washing its hands--which was nonsense,  because nobody had been doing anything at all, except Jane, and how can  you get dirty doing nothing? That is a difficult question, and I cannot  answer it on paper. In real life I could very soon show you--or you me,  which is much more likely.    During the conversation in which the six ears were lent (there were four  children, so _that_ sum comes right), it had been "]]]
