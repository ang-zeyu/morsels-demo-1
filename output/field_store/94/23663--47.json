Oceans can  never allay this Leviathan's burning thirst, and this Phoenix of the  undying fire can abide nowhere save in the glow of the countenance of the  Well-Beloved. Therefore, O brother! kindle with the oil of wisdom the lamp  of the spirit within the innermost chamber of thy heart, and guard it with  the globe of understanding, that the breath of the infidel may extinguish  not its flame nor dim its brightness. Thus have We illuminated the heavens  of utterance with the splendours of the Sun of divine wisdom and  understanding, that thy heart may find peace, that thou mayest be of those  who, on the wings of certitude, have soared unto the heaven of the love of  their Lord, the All-Merciful.    And now, concerning His words: \"And then shall appear the sign of the Son  of man in heaven.\" By these words it is meant that when the sun of the  heavenly teachings hath been eclipsed, the stars of the  divinely-established laws have fallen, and the moon of true knowledge--the  educator of mankind--hath been obscured; when the standards of guidance and  felicity have been reversed, and the morn of truth and righteousness hath  sunk in night, then shall the sign of the Son of man appear in heaven. By  \"heaven\" is meant the visible heaven, inasmuch as when the hour draweth  nigh on which the Day-star of the heaven of justice shall be made  manifest, and the Ark of divine guidance shall sail upon the sea of glory,  a star will appear in the heaven, heralding unto its people the advent of  that most great light. In like manner, in the invisible heaven a star  shall be made manifest who, unto the peoples of the earth, shall act as a  harbinger of the break of that true and exalted Morn. These twofold signs,  in the visible and the invisible heaven, have announced the Revelation of  each of the Prophets of God, as is commonly believed.    Among the Prophets was Abraham, the Friend of God. Ere He manifested  Himself, Nimrod dreamed a dream. Thereupon, he summoned the soothsayers,  who informed him of the rise of a star in the heaven. Likewise, there  appeared a herald who announced throughout the land the coming of Abraham.    After Him came Moses, He Who held converse with God. The soothsayers of  His time warned Pharaoh in these terms: \"A star hath risen in the heaven,  and lo! it foreshadoweth the conception of a Child Who holdeth your fate  and the fate of your people in His hand.\" In like manner, there appeared a  sage who, in the darkness of the night, brought tidings of joy unto the  people of Israel, imparting consolation to their souls, and assurance to  their hearts. To this testify the records of the sacred books. Were the  details to be mentioned, this epistle would swell into a book. Moreover,  it is not Our wish to relate the stories of the days that are past. God is  Our witness that what We even now mention is due solely to Our tender  affection for thee, that haply the poor of the earth may attain the shores  of the sea of wealth, the ignorant be led unto the ocean of divine  knowledge, and they that thirst for understanding partake of the Salsabil  of divine wisdom. Otherwise, this servant regardeth the consideration of  such records a grave mistake and a grievous transgression.    In like manner, when the hour of the Revelation of Jesus drew nigh, a few  of the Magi, aware that the star of Jesus had appeared in heaven, sought  and followed it, till they came unto the city which was the seat of the  Kingdom of Herod. The sway of his sovereignty in those days embraced the  whole of that land.    These Magi said: \"Where is He that is born King of the Jews? for we have  seen His star in the east and are come to worship Him!\"(48) When they had  searched, they found out that in Bethlehem, in the land of Judea, the  Child had been born. This was the sign that was manifested in the visible  heaven. As to the sign in the invisible heaven--the heaven of divine  knowledge and understanding--it was Yahya, son of Zachariah, who gave unto  the people the tidings of the Manifestation of Jesus. Even as He hath  revealed: \"God announceth Yahya to thee, who shall bear witness unto the  Word from God, and a great one and chaste.\"(49) By the term \"Word\" is  meant Jesus, Whose coming Yahya foretold. Moreover, in the heavenly  Scriptures it is written: \"John the Baptist was preaching in the  wilderness of Judea, and saying, Repent ye: for the Kingdom of heaven is  at hand.\"(50) By John is meant Yahya.    Likewise, ere the beauty of Muhammad was unveiled, the signs of the  visible heaven were made manifest. As to the signs of the invisible  heaven, there appeared four men who successively announced unto the people  the joyful tidings of the rise of that divine Luminary. Ruz-bih, later  named Salman, was honoured by being in their service. As the end of one of  these approached, he would send Ruz-bih unto the other, until the fourth  who, feeling his death to be nigh, addressed Ruz-bih saying: \"O Ruz-bih!  when thou hast taken up my body and buried it, go to Hijaz for there the  Day-star of Muhammad will arise. Happy art thou, for thou shalt behold His  face!\"    And now concerning this wondrous and most exalted Cause. Know thou verily  that many an astronomer hath announced the appearance of its star in the  visible heaven. Likewise, there appeared on earth Ahmad and Kazim,(51)  those twin resplendent lights--may God sanctify their resting-place!    From all that We have stated it hath become clear and manifest that before  the revelation of each of the Mirrors reflecting the divine Essence, the  signs heralding their advent must needs be revealed in the visible heaven  as well as in the invisible, wherein is the seat of the sun of knowledge,  of the moon of wisdom, and of the stars of understanding and utterance.  The sign of the invisible heaven must needs be revealed in the person of  that perfect man who, before each Manifestation appeareth, educateth, and  prepareth the souls of men for the advent of the divine Luminary, the  Light of the unity of God amongst men.    And now, with reference to His words: \"And then shall all the tribes of  the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of  heaven with power and great glory.\" These words signify that in those days  men will lament the loss of the Sun of the divine beauty, of the Moon of  knowledge, and of the Stars of divine wisdom. Thereupon, they will behold  the countenance of the promised One, the adored Beauty, descending from  heaven and riding upon the clouds. By this is meant that the divine Beauty  will be made manifest from the heaven of the will of God, and will appear  in the form of the human temple. The term \"heaven\" denoteth loftiness and  exaltation, inasmuch as it is the seat of the revelation of those  Manifestations of Holiness, the Day-springs of ancient glory. These  ancient Beings, though delivered from the womb of their mother, have in  reality descended from the heaven of the will of God. Though they be  dwelling on this earth, yet their true habitations are the retreats of  glory in the realms above. Whilst walking amongst mortals, they soar in  the heaven of the divine presence. Without feet they tread the path of the  spirit, and without wings they rise unto the exalted heights of divine  unity. With every fleeting breath they cover the immensity of space, and  at every moment traverse the kingdoms of the visible and the invisible.  Upon their thrones is written: \"Nothing whatsoever keepeth Him from being  occupied with any other thing;\" and on their seats is inscribed: \"Verily,  His ways differ every day.\"(52) They are sent forth through the  transcendent power of the Ancient of Days, and are raised up by the  exalted will of God, the most mighty King. This is what is meant by the  words: \"coming in the clouds of heaven.\"    In the utterances of the divine Luminaries the term \"heaven\" hath been  applied to many and divers things; such as the \"heaven of Command,\" the  \"heaven of Will,\" the \"heaven of the divine Purpose,\" the \"heaven of  divine Knowledge,\" the \"heaven of Certitude,\" the \"heaven of Utterance,\"  the \"heaven of Revelation,\" the \"heaven of Concealment,\" and the like. In  every instance, He hath given the term \"heaven\" a special meaning, the  significance of which is revealed to none save those that have been  initiated into the divine mysteries, and have drunk from the chalice of  immortal life. For example, He saith: \"The heaven hath sustenance for you,  and it containeth that which you are promised;\"(53) whereas it is the  earth that yieldeth such sustenance. Likewise, it hath been said: \"The  names come down from heaven;\" whereas they proceed out of the mouth of  men. Wert thou to cleanse the mirror of thy heart from the dust of malice,  thou wouldst apprehend the meaning of the symbolic terms revealed by the  all-embracing Word of God made manifest in every Dispensation, and wouldst  discover the mysteries of divine knowledge. Not, however, until thou  consumest with the flame of utter detachment those veils of idle learning,  that are current amongst men, canst thou behold the resplendent morn of  true knowledge.    Know verily that Knowledge is of two kinds: Divine and Satanic. The one  welleth out from the fountain of divine inspiration; the other is but a  reflection of vain and obscure thoughts. The source of the former is God  Himself; the motive-force of the latter the whisperings of selfish desire.  The one is guided by the principle: \"Fear ye God; God will teach you;\"(54)  the other is but a confirmation of the truth: \"Knowledge is the most  grievous veil between man and his Creator.\" The former bringeth forth the  fruit of patience, of longing desire, of true understanding, and love;  whilst the latter can yield naught but arrogance,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16984"],[0,"Prayers and Meditations (#8)"],[1,"court of Thy grace and favors, to number  me with such as have rid themselves from everything except Thyself, and  have set themselves towards Thee, and have not been kept back by such  misfortunes as were decreed by Thee, from turning in the direction of Thy  gifts.    I have laid hold, O my Lord, on the handle of Thy bounty, and clung  steadfastly to the hem of the robe of Thy favor. Send down, then, upon me,  out of the clouds of Thy generosity, what will purge out from me the  remembrance of any one except Thee, and make me able to turn unto Him Who  is the Object of the adoration of all mankind, against Whom have been  arrayed the stirrers of sedition, who have broken Thy covenant, and  disbelieved in Thee and in Thy signs.    Deny me not, O my Lord, the fragrances of Thy raiment in Thy days, and  deprive me not of the breathings of Thy Revelation at the appearance of  the splendors of the light of Thy face. Powerful art Thou to do what  pleaseth Thee. Naught can resist Thy will, nor frustrate what Thou hast  purposed by Thy power.    No God is there but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Wise.            XXXVIII: \"LAUDED BE THY NAME, O LORD MY GOD! I TESTIFY...\"      Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! I testify that Thou wast a hidden  Treasure wrapped within Thine immemorial Being and an impenetrable Mystery  enshrined in Thine own Essence. Wishing to reveal Thyself, Thou didst call  into being the Greater and the Lesser Worlds, and didst choose Man above  all Thy creatures, and didst make Him a sign of both of these worlds, O  Thou Who art our Lord, the Most Compassionate!    Thou didst raise Him up to occupy Thy throne before all the people of Thy  creation. Thou didst enable Him to unravel Thy mysteries, and to shine  with the lights of Thine inspiration and Thy Revelation, and to manifest  Thy names and Thine attributes. Through Him Thou didst adorn the preamble  of the book of Thy creation, O Thou Who art the Ruler of the universe Thou  hast fashioned!    I bear witness that in His person solidity and fluidity have been joined  and combined. Through His immovable constancy in Thy Cause, and His  unwavering adherence to whatsoever Thou, in the plentitude of the light of  Thy glory, didst unveil to His eyes, throughout the domains of Thy  Revelation and creation, the souls of Thy servants were stirred up in  their longing for Thy Kingdom, and the dwellers of Thy realms rushed forth  to enter into Thy heavenly dominion. Through the restlessness He evinced  in Thy path, the feet of all them that are devoted to Thee were steeled  and confirmed to manifest Thy Cause amidst Thy creatures, and to  demonstrate Thy sovereignty throughout Thy realm.    How great, O my God, is this Thy most excellent handiwork, and how  consummate Thy creation, which hath caused every understanding heart and  mind to marvel! And when the set time was fulfilled, and what had been  preordained came to pass, Thou didst unloose His tongue to praise Thee,  and to lay bare Thy mysteries before all Thy creation, O Thou Who art the  Possessor of all names, and the Fashioner of earth and heaven! Through Him  all created things were made to glorify Thee, and to celebrate Thy praise,  and every soul was directed towards the kingdom of Thy revelation and Thy  sovereignty.    At one time, Thou didst raise Him up, O my God, and didst attire Him with  the ornament of the name of Him Who conversed with Thee (Moses), and didst  through Him uncover all that Thy will had decreed and Thine irrevocable  purpose ordained. At another time, Thou didst adorn Him with the name of  Him Who was Thy Spirit (Jesus), and didst send Him down out of the heaven  of Thy will, for the edification of Thy people, infusing thereby the  spirit of life into the hearts of the sincere among Thy servants and the  faithful among Thy creatures. Again, Thou didst reveal Him, decked forth  by the name of Him Who was Thy Friend (Muhammad), and caused Him to shine  brightly above the horizon of Hijaz, as a token of Thy power and an  evidence of Thy might. Through Him Thou didst send unto Thy servants what  enabled them to scale the heights of Thy unity, and to yearn over the  wonders of Thy manifold knowledge and wisdom.    I testify, O Thou Who art the Lord of the whole creation, and the Desire  of whosoever hath sought Thee, that, amidst Thy creatures, They resemble  the sun which no matter how often it riseth and setteth is still the one  and the same sun. Whoso maketh any distinction between any of Them hath  truly failed to attain the ultimate purpose, and to reach the highest  goal, and hath been deprived of the mysteries of unity and of the lights  of sanctity and oneness. I testify, moreover, that Thou hast decreed that  none on the face of the earth should equal Them, and none of Thy creatures  be able to be compared with any of Them, in order that Thine own  singleness and peerlessness might be recognized and established.    Glorified, immeasurably glorified be Thy name, O my God! How can I ever  befittingly mention Thee or sufficiently praise Thee, that Thou hast  manifested Him by the power of Thy might, and caused Him to shine above  the horizon of Thy will, and made Him the Day-Spring of Thy signs, and the  Dawning-Place of the revelation of Thy names and Thine attributes? How  bewilderingly mysterious, moreover, O my God, is His nature and all that  Thou hast infused into Him, through Thy strength and by the power of Thy  might! At one time He appeareth as the water which is Life indeed, sent  down out of the heaven of Thy grace, and poured forth from the clouds of  Thy mercy, that Thy creatures may be endued with new life, and live as  long as Thine own Kingdom endureth. Every drop of that water would suffice  to quicken the dead, and to set their faces in the direction of Thy favors  and Thy gifts, and to rid them of all attachment to aught else except  Thee. At another time He revealeth Himself as the Fire which Thou didst  kindle in the tree of Thy unity, whose heat melted the hearts of Thine  ardent lovers when He Who is the Day-Star of the world shone forth above  the horizon of 'Iraq. I testify, O my God, that through Him the veils of  human fancy were burnt up, and the hearts of men were set towards the  scene of Thy most resplendent glory.    I implore Thee, O Thou Who art the Supreme Ordainer, not to suffer me to  be deprived of the breezes which are wafted in Thy days, the days whereon  the sweet smell of the raiment of Thy mercy hath been shed abroad. Neither  do Thou keep me back from Thy most great Ocean, every drop of which crieth  out and saith: \"Great is the blessedness that awaiteth him who hath been  awakened from his sleep by the breath of God which, from the source of His  mercy, hath blown over all such of His creatures as have set themselves  towards Him!\"    Thou seest, O my Lord, how Thy servants are held captive by their own  selves and desires. Redeem them from their bondage, O my God, by the power  of Thy sovereignty and might, that they may turn towards Thee when He Who  is the Revealer of Thy names and attributes is manifested unto men.    Cast upon this poor and desolate creature, O my Lord, the glance of Thy  wealth, and flood his heart with the beams of Thy knowledge, that he may  apprehend the verities of the unseen world, and discover the mysteries of  Thy heavenly realm, and perceive the signs and tokens of Thy kingdom, and  behold the manifold revelations of this earthly life all set forth before  the face of Him Who is the Revealer of Thine own Self. Direct, then, his  eyes, O my God, towards the horizon of Thy loving-kindness, and make  steadfast his heart in its attachment to Thee, and unloose his tongue to  praise Thee, and make him able to hold fast the cord of Thy love, and to  cling to the hem of Thy bounteousness, and to proclaim Thy name amidst Thy  creatures, and to recount Thy virtues throughout Thy realm, in such wise  that no obstacle will deter him from turning to Thy name, the  All-Bountiful, and no veil shut him out from Thee, in Whose hand is the  dominion of utterance and the kingdom of all names and attributes!    Hold Thou the hand of this seeker who hath set his face towards Thee, O my  Lord, and draw him out of the depths of his vain imaginations, that the  light of certainty may shine brightly above the horizon of his heart in  the days whereon the sun of the knowledge of Thy creatures hath been  darkened through the shining of the Day-Star of Thy glory; the days  whereon the moon of the world's wisdom hath been eclipsed through the  appearance of Thy hidden knowledge, and the manifestation of Thy  well-guarded secret, and the revelation of Thine enshrined mystery; the  days whereon the stars of men's doings have fallen through the rising of  the orb of Thy unity and the shedding of the radiance of Thy transcendent  oneness.    I beg of Thee, O my God, by Thy most exalted Word which Thou hast ordained  as the Divine Elixir unto all who are in Thy realm, the Elixir through  whose potency the crude metal of human life hath been transmuted into  purest gold, O Thou in Whose hands are both the visible and invisible  kingdoms, to ordain that my choice be conformed to Thy choice and my wish  to Thy wish, that I may be entirely content with that which Thou didst  desire, and be wholly satisfied with what Thou didst destine for me by Thy  bounteousness and favor. Potent art Thou to do as Thou willest. Thou, in  very truth, art the All-Glorious, the All-Wise.    Happy is the man who hath recognized Thee, and discovered the sweetness of  Thy fragrance, and set himself towards Thy kingdom, and tasted of the  things that have been perfected therein by Thy grace and favor. Great is  the blessedness of him who hath acknowledged Thy most excellent majesty,  and whom the veils that have shut out the nations from Thee have not  hindered from directing his eyes towards Thee, O Thou Who art the King of  eternity and the"]]]
