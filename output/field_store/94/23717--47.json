Mr. Wood also asked me where I was  going to. I told him where I had been, and that I should never have gone  away had I not been driven out by my owners. He had given me a written  paper some time before, which said that I had come with them to England by  my own desire; and that was true. It said also that I left them of my own  free will, because I was a free woman in England; and that I was idle and  would not do my work--which was not true. I gave this paper afterwards to  a gentleman who inquired into my case.[13]    [Footnote 13: See page 24.]    I went into the kitchen and got my clothes out. The nurse and the servant  girl were there, and I said to the man who was going to take out my trunk,  \"Stop, before you take up this trunk, and hear what I have to say before  these people. I am going out of this house, as I was ordered; but I have  done no wrong at all to my owners, neither here nor in the West Indies. I  always worked very hard to please them, both by night and day; but there  was no giving satisfaction, for my mistress could never be satisfied with  reasonable service. I told my mistress I was sick, and yet she has ordered  me out of doors. This is the fourth time; and now I am going out.\"    And so I came out, and went and carried my trunk to the Moravians. I then  returned back to Mash the shoe-black's house, and begged his wife to take  me in. I had a little West Indian money in my trunk; and they got it  changed for me. This helped to support me for a little while. The man's  wife was very kind to me. I was very sick, and she boiled nourishing  things up for me. She also sent for a doctor to see me, and he sent me  medicine, which did me good, though I was ill for a long time with the  rheumatic pains. I lived a good many months with these poor people, and  they nursed me, and did all that lay in their power to serve me. The man  was well acquainted with my situation, as he used to go to and fro to Mr.  Wood's house to clean shoes and knives; and he and his wife were sorry for  me.    About this time, a woman of the name of Hill told me of the Anti-Slavery  Society, and went with me to their office, to inquire if they could do any  thing to get me my freedom, and send me back to the West Indies. The  gentlemen of the Society took me to a lawyer, who examined very strictly  into my case; but told me that the laws of England could do nothing to  make me free in Antigua[14]. However they did all they could for me: they  gave me a little money from time to time to keep me from want; and some of  them went to Mr. Wood to try to persuade him to let me return a free woman  to my husband; but though they offered him, as I have heard, a large sum  for my freedom, he was sulky and obstinate, and would not consent to let  me go free.    [Footnote 14: She came first to the Anti-Slavery Office in Aldermanbury,  about the latter end of November 1828; and her case was referred to Mr.  George Stephen to be investigated. More of this hereafter.--ED.]    This was the first winter I spent in England, and I suffered much from the  severe cold, and from the rheumatic pains, which still at times torment  me. However, Providence was very good to me, and I got many  friends--especially some Quaker ladies, who hearing of my case, came and  sought me out, and gave me good warm clothing and money. Thus I had great  cause to bless God in my affliction.    When I got better I was anxious to get some work to do, as I was unwilling  to eat the bread of idleness. Mrs. Mash, who was a laundress, recommended  me to a lady for a charwoman. She paid me very handsomely for what work I  did, and I divided the money with Mrs. Mash; for though very poor, they  gave me food when my own money was done, and never suffered me to want.    In the spring, I got into service with a lady, who saw me at the house  where I sometimes worked as a charwoman. This lady's name was Mrs.  Forsyth. She had been in the West Indies, and was accustomed to Blacks,  and liked them. I was with her six months, and went with her to Margate.  She treated me well, and gave me a good character when she left London.[15]    [Footnote 15: She refers to a written certificate which will be inserted  afterwards.]    After Mrs. Forsyth went away, I was again out of place, and went to  lodgings, for which I paid two shillings a week, and found coals and  candle. After eleven weeks, the money I had saved in service was all gone,  and I was forced to go back to the Anti-Slavery office to ask a supply,  till I could get another situation. I did not like to go back--I did not  like to be idle. I would rather work for my living than get it for  nothing. They were very good to give me a supply, but I felt shame at  being obliged to apply for relief whilst I had strength to work.    At last I went into the service of Mr. and Mrs. Pringle, where I have been  ever since, and am as comfortable as I can be while separated from my dear  husband, and away from my own country and all old friends and connections.  My dear mistress teaches me daily to read the word of God, and takes great  pains to make me understand it. I enjoy the great privilege of being  enabled to attend church three times on the Sunday; and I have met with  many kind friends since I have been here, both clergymen and others. The  Rev. Mr. Young, who lives in the next house, has shown me much kindness,  and taken much pains to instruct me, particularly while my master and  mistress were absent in Scotland. Nor must I forget, among my friends, the  Rev. Mr. Mortimer, the good clergyman of the parish, under whose ministry  I have now sat for upwards of twelve months. I trust in God I have  profited by what I have heard from him. He never keeps back the truth, and  I think he has been the means of opening my eyes and ears much better to  understand the word of God. Mr. Mortimer tells me that he cannot open the  eyes of my heart, but that I must pray to God to change my heart, and make  me to know the truth, and the truth will make me free.    I still live in the hope that God will find a way to give me my liberty,  and give me back to my husband. I endeavour to keep down my fretting, and  to leave all to Him, for he knows what is good for me better than I know  myself. Yet, I must confess, I find it a hard and heavy task to do so.    I am often much vexed, and I feel great sorrow when I hear some people in  this country say, that the slaves do not need better usage, and do not  want to be free.[16] They believe the foreign people,[17] who deceive them,  and say slaves are happy. I say, Not so. How can slaves be happy when they  have the halter round their neck and the whip upon their back? and are  disgraced and thought no more of than beasts?--and are separated from  their mothers, and husbands, and children, and sisters, just as cattle are  sold and separated? Is it happiness for a driver in the field to take down  his wife or sister or child, and strip them, and whip them in such a  disgraceful manner?--women that have had children exposed in the open  field to shame! There is no modesty or decency shown by the owner to his  slaves; men, women, and children are exposed alike. Since I have been here  I have often wondered how English people can go out into the West Indies  and act in such a beastly manner. But when they go to the West Indies,  they forget God and all feeling of shame, I think, since they can see and  do such things. They tie up slaves like hogs--moor[18] them up like cattle,  and they lick them, so as hogs, or cattle, or horses never were  flogged;--and yet they come home and say, and make some good people  believe, that slaves don't want to get out of slavery. But they put a  cloak about the truth. It is not so. All slaves want to be free--to be  free is very sweet. I will say the truth to English people who may read  this history that my good friend, Miss S----, is now writing down for me.  I have been a slave myself--I know what slaves feel--I can tell by myself  what other slaves feel, and by what they have told me. The man that says  slaves be quite happy in slavery--that they don't want to be free--that  man is either ignorant or a lying person. I never heard a slave say so. I  never heard a Buckra man say so, till I heard tell of it in England. Such  people ought to be ashamed of themselves. They can't do without slaves,  they say. What's the reason they can't do without slaves as well as in  England? No slaves here--no whips--no stocks--no punishment, except for  wicked people. They hire servants in England; and if they don't like them,  they send them away: they can't lick them. Let them work ever so hard in  England, they are far better off than slaves. If they get a bad master,  they give warning and go hire to another. They have their liberty. That's  just what we want. We don't mind hard work, if we had proper treatment,  and proper wages like English servants, and proper time given in the week  to keep us from breaking the Sabbath. But they won't give it: they will  have work--work--work, night and day, sick or well, till we are quite done  up; and we must not speak up nor look amiss, however much we be abused.  And then when we are quite done up, who cares for us, more than for a lame  horse? This is slavery. I tell it, to let English people know the truth;  and I hope they will never leave off to pray God, and call loud to the  great King of England, till all the poor blacks be given free, and slavery  done up for evermore.

When they got home they described it, and the learned ones wrote many  books about the town, the palace and the garden; but nobody forgot the  nightingale, it was always put above everything else. Those among them  who were poets wrote the most beautiful poems, all about the nightingale  in the woods by the deep blue sea. These books went all over the world,  and in course of time some of them reached the emperor. He sat in his  golden chair reading and reading, and nodding his head, well pleased to  hear such beautiful descriptions of the town, the palace and the garden.  'But the nightingale is the best of all,' he read.    'What is this?' said the emperor. 'The nightingale? Why, I know nothing  about it. Is there such a bird in my kingdom, and in my own garden into  the bargain, and I have never heard of it? Imagine my having to  discover this from a book?'    Then he called his gentleman-in-waiting, who was so grand that when any  one of a lower rank dared to speak to him, or to ask him a question, he  would only answer 'P,' which means nothing at all.    'There is said to be a very wonderful bird called a nightingale here,'  said the emperor. 'They say that it is better than anything else in all  my great kingdom! Why have I never been told anything about it?'    'I have never heard it mentioned,' said the gentleman-in-waiting. 'It  has never been presented at court.'    'I wish it to appear here this evening to sing to me,' said the emperor.  'The whole world knows what I am possessed of, and I know nothing about  it!'    'I have never heard it mentioned before,' said the gentleman-in-waiting.  'I will seek it, and I will find it!' But where was it to be found? The  gentleman-in-waiting ran upstairs and downstairs and in and out of all  the rooms and corridors. No one of all those he met had ever heard  anything about the nightingale; so the gentleman-in-waiting ran back to  the emperor, and said that it must be a myth, invented by the writers of  the books. 'Your imperial majesty must not believe everything that is  written; books are often mere inventions, even if they do not belong to  what we call the black art!'    'But the book in which I read it is sent to me by the powerful Emperor  of Japan, so it can't be untrue. I will hear this nightingale; I insist  upon its being here to-night. I extend my most gracious protection to  it, and if it is not forthcoming, I will have the whole court trampled  upon after supper!'    'Tsing-pe!' said the gentleman-in-waiting, and away he ran again, up and  down all the stairs, in and out of all the rooms and corridors; half the  court ran with him, for they none of them wished to be trampled on.  There was much questioning about this nightingale, which was known to  all the outside world, but to no one at court. At last they found a poor  little maid in the kitchen. She said, 'Oh heavens, the nightingale? I  know it very well. Yes, indeed it can sing. Every evening I am allowed  to take broken meat to my poor sick mother: she lives down by the shore.  On my way back, when I am tired, I rest awhile in the wood, and then I  hear the nightingale. Its song brings the tears into my eyes; I feel as  if my mother were kissing me!'    'Little kitchen-maid,' said the gentleman-in-waiting, 'I will procure  you a permanent position in the kitchen, and permission to see the  emperor dining, if you will take us to the nightingale. It is commanded  to appear at court to-night.'    Then they all went out into the wood where the nightingale usually sang.  Half the court was there. As they were going along at their best pace a  cow began to bellow.    'Oh!' said a young courtier, 'there we have it. What wonderful power  for such a little creature; I have certainly heard it before.'    'No, those are the cows bellowing; we are a long way yet from the  place.' Then the frogs began to croak in the marsh.    'Beautiful!' said the Chinese chaplain, 'it is just like the tinkling of  church bells.'    'No, those are the frogs!' said the little kitchen-maid. 'But I think we  shall soon hear it now!'    Then the nightingale began to sing.    'There it is!' said the little girl. 'Listen, listen, there it sits!'  and she pointed to a little grey bird up among the branches.    'Is it possible?' said the gentleman-in-waiting. 'I should never have  thought it was like that. How common it looks! Seeing so many grand  people must have frightened all its colours away.'    'Little nightingale!' called the kitchen-maid quite loud, 'our gracious  emperor wishes you to sing to him!'    'With the greatest of pleasure!' said the nightingale, warbling away in  the most delightful fashion.    'It is just like crystal bells,' said the gentleman-in-waiting. 'Look at  its little throat, how active it is. It is extraordinary that we have  never heard it before! I am sure it will be a great success at court!'    'Shall I sing again to the emperor?' said the nightingale, who thought  he was present.    'My precious little nightingale,' said the gentleman-in-waiting, 'I have  the honour to command your attendance at a court festival to-night,  where you will charm his gracious majesty the emperor with your  fascinating singing.'    'It sounds best among the trees,' said the nightingale, but it went with  them willingly when it heard that the emperor wished it.    [Illustration: _'Is it possible?' said the gentleman-in-waiting. 'I  should never have thought it was like that. How common it looks. Seeing  so many grand people must have frightened all its colours away.'_]    The palace had been brightened up for the occasion. The walls and the  floors, which were all of china, shone by the light of many thousand  golden lamps. The most beautiful flowers, all of the tinkling kind, were  arranged in the corridors; there was hurrying to and fro, and a great  draught, but this was just what made the bells ring; one's ears were  full of the tinkling. In the middle of the large reception-room where  the emperor sat a golden rod had been fixed, on which the nightingale  was to perch. The whole court was assembled, and the little kitchen-maid  had been permitted to stand behind the door, as she now had the actual  title of cook. They were all dressed in their best; everybody's eyes  were turned towards the little grey bird at which the emperor was  nodding. The nightingale sang delightfully, and the tears came into the  emperor's eyes, nay, they rolled down his cheeks; and then the  nightingale sang more beautifully than ever, its notes touched all  hearts. The emperor was charmed, and said the nightingale should  have his gold slipper to wear round its neck. But the nightingale  declined with thanks; it had already been sufficiently rewarded.    'I have seen tears in the eyes of the emperor; that is my richest  reward. The tears of an emperor have a wonderful power! God knows I am  sufficiently recompensed!' and then it again burst into its sweet  heavenly song.    'That is the most delightful coquetting I have ever seen!' said the  ladies, and they took some water into their mouths to try and make the  same gurgling when any one spoke to them, thinking so to equal the  nightingale. Even the lackeys and the chambermaids announced that they  were satisfied, and that is saying a great deal; they are always the  most difficult people to please. Yes, indeed, the nightingale had made a  sensation. It was to stay at court now, and to have its own cage, as  well as liberty to walk out twice a day, and once in the night. It  always had twelve footmen, with each one holding a ribbon which was tied  round its leg. There was not much pleasure in an outing of that sort.    The whole town talked about the marvellous bird, and if two people met,  one said to the other 'Night,' and the other answered 'Gale,' and then  they sighed, perfectly understanding each other. Eleven cheesemongers'  children were called after it, but they had not got a voice among them.    One day a large parcel came for the emperor; outside was written the  word 'Nightingale.'    'Here we have another new book about this celebrated bird,' said the  emperor. But it was no book; it was a little work of art in a box, an  artificial nightingale, exactly like the living one, but it was studded  all over with diamonds, rubies and sapphires.    When the bird was wound up it could sing one of the songs the real one  sang, and it wagged its tail, which glittered with silver and gold. A  ribbon was tied round its neck on which was written, 'The Emperor of  Japan's nightingale is very poor compared to the Emperor of China's.'    Everybody said, 'Oh, how beautiful!' And the person who brought the  artificial bird immediately received the title of Imperial  Nightingale-Carrier in Chief.    'Now, they must sing together; what a duet that will be.'    Then they had to sing together, but they did not get on very well, for  the real nightingale sang in its own way, and the artificial one could  only sing waltzes.    'There is no fault in that,' said the music-master; 'it is perfectly in  time and correct in every way!'    Then the artificial bird had to sing alone. It was just as great a  success as the real one, and then it was so much prettier to look at; it  glittered like bracelets and breast-pins.    [Illustration: _Then it again burst into its sweet heavenly song.]    'That is the most delightful coquetting I have ever seen!' said the  ladies, and they took some water into their mouths to try and make the  same gurgling, thinking so to equal the nightingale._    It sang the same tune three and thirty times over, and yet it was  not tired; people would willingly have heard it from the beginning  again, but the emperor said that the real one must have a turn now--but  where was it? No one had noticed that it had flown out of the open  window, back to its own green woods."]]]
