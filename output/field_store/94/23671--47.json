But since none of the national plants could be got into action during  the war, the United States was compelled to draw upon South America for  its supply. The imports of Chilean saltpeter rose from half a million  tons in 1914 to a million and a half in 1917. After peace was made the  Department of War turned over to the Department of Agriculture its  surplus of saltpeter, 150,000 tons, and it was sold to American farmers  at cost, $81 a ton.    For nitrogen plays a double role in human economy. It appears like  Brahma in two aspects, Vishnu the Preserver and Siva the Destroyer. Here  I have been considering nitrogen in its maleficent aspect, its use in  war. We now turn to its beneficent aspect, its use in peace.          III    FEEDING THE SOIL      The Great War not only starved people: it starved the land. Enough  nitrogen was thrown away in some indecisive battle on the Aisne to save  India from a famine. The population of Europe as a whole has not been  lessened by the war, but the soil has been robbed of its power to  support the population. A plant requires certain chemical elements for  its growth and all of these must be within reach of its rootlets, for it  will accept no substitutes. A wheat stalk in France before the war had  placed at its feet nitrates from Chile, phosphates from Florida and  potash from Germany. All these were shut off by the firing line and the  shortage of shipping.    Out of the eighty elements only thirteen are necessary for crops. Four  of these are gases: hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and chlorine. Five are  metals: potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron and sodium. Four are  non-metallic solids: carbon, sulfur, phosphorus and silicon. Three of  these, hydrogen, oxygen and carbon, making up the bulk of the plant, are  obtainable _ad libitum_ from the air and water. The other ten in the  form of salts are dissolved in the water that is sucked up from the  soil. The quantity needed by the plant is so small and the quantity  contained in the soil is so great that ordinarily we need not bother  about the supply except in case of three of them. They are nitrogen,  potassium and phosphorus. These would be useless or fatal to plant life  in the elemental form, but fixed in neutral salt they are essential  plant foods. A ton of wheat takes away from the soil about 47 pounds of  nitrogen, 18 pounds of phosphoric acid and 12 pounds of potash. If then  the farmer does not restore this much to his field every year he is  drawing upon his capital and this must lead to bankruptcy in the long  run.    So much is easy to see, but actually the question is extremely  complicated. When the German chemist, Justus von Liebig, pointed out in  1840 the possibility of maintaining soil fertility by the application of  chemicals it seemed at first as though the question were practically  solved. Chemists assumed that all they had to do was to analyze the soil  and analyze the crop and from this figure out, as easily as balancing a  bank book, just how much of each ingredient would have to be restored to  the soil every year. But somehow it did not work out that way and the  practical agriculturist, finding that the formulas did not fit his farm,  sneered at the professors and whenever they cited Liebig to him he  irreverently transposed the syllables of the name. The chemist when he  went deeper into the subject saw that he had to deal with the colloids,  damp, unpleasant, gummy bodies that he had hitherto fought shy of  because they would not crystallize or filter. So the chemist called to  his aid the physicist on the one hand and the biologist on the other and  then they both had their hands full. The physicist found that he had to  deal with a polyvariant system of solids, liquids and gases mutually  miscible in phases too numerous to be handled by Gibbs's Rule. The  biologist found that he had to deal with the invisible flora and fauna  of a new world.    Plants obey the injunction of Tennyson and rise on the stepping stones  of their dead selves to higher things. Each successive generation lives  on what is left of the last in the soil plus what it adds from the air  and sunshine. As soon as a leaf or tree trunk falls to the ground it is  taken in charge by a wrecking crew composed of a myriad of microscopic  organisms who proceed to break it up into its component parts so these  can be used for building a new edifice. The process is called \"rotting\"  and the product, the black, gummy stuff of a fertile soil, is called  \"humus.\" The plants, that is, the higher plants, are not able to live on  their own proteids as the animals are. But there are lower plants,  certain kinds of bacteria, that can break up the big complicated proteid  molecules into their component parts and reduce the nitrogen in them to  ammonia or ammonia-like compounds. Having done this they stop and turn  over the job to another set of bacteria to be carried through the next  step. For you must know that soil society is as complex and specialized  as that above ground and the tiniest bacterium would die rather than  violate the union rules. The second set of bacteria change the ammonia  over to nitrites and then a third set, the Amalgamated Union of Nitrate  Workers, steps in and completes the process of oxidation with an  efficiency that Ostwald might envy, for ninety-six per cent. of the  ammonia of the soil is converted into nitrates. But if the conditions  are not just right, if the food is insufficient or unwholesome or if  the air that circulates through the soil is contaminated with poison  gases, the bacteria go on a strike. The farmer, not seeing the thing  from the standpoint of the bacteria, says the soil is \"sick\" and he  proceeds to doctor it according to his own notion of what ails it. First  perhaps he tries running in strike breakers. He goes to one of the firms  that makes a business of supplying nitrogen-fixing bacteria from the  scabs or nodules of the clover roots and scatters these colonies over  the field. But if the living conditions remain bad the newcomers will  soon quit work too and the farmer loses his money. If he is wise, then,  he will remedy the conditions, putting a better ventilation system in  his soil perhaps or neutralizing the sourness by means of lime or  killing off the ameboid banditti that prey upon the peaceful bacteria  engaged in the nitrogen industry. It is not an easy job that the farmer  has in keeping billions of billions of subterranean servants contented  and working together, but if he does not succeed at this he wastes his  seed and labor.    The layman regards the soil as a platform or anchoring place on which to  set plants. He measures its value by its superficial area without  considering its contents, which is as absurd as to estimate a man's  wealth by the size of his safe. The difference in point of view is well  illustrated by the old story of the city chap who was showing his farmer  uncle the sights of New York. When he took him to Central Park he tried  to astonish him by saying \"This land is worth $500,000 an acre.\" The old  farmer dug his toe into the ground, kicked out a clod, broke it open,  looked at it, spit on it and squeezed it in his hand and then said,  \"Don't you believe it; 'tain't worth ten dollars an acre. Mighty poor  soil I call it.\" Both were right.    [Illustration: Courtesy of American Cyanamid Co.    FIXING NITROGEN BY CALCIUM CARBIDE    A view of the oven room in the plant of the American Cyanamid Company.  The steel cylinders standing in the background are packed with the  carbide and then put into the ovens sunk in the floor. When these are  heated internally by electricity to 2000 degrees Fahrenheit pure  nitrogen is let in and absorbed by the carbide, making cyanamid, which  may be used as a fertilizer or for ammonia.]    [Illustration: Photo by International Film Service    A BARROW FULL OF POTASH SALTS EXTRACTED FROM SIX TONS OF GREEN KELP BY  THE GOVERNMENT CHEMISTS]    [Illustration: NATURE'S SILENT METHOD OF NITROGEN FIXATION    The nodules on the vetch roots contain colonies of bacteria which have  the power of taking the free nitrogen out of the air and putting it in  compounds suitable for plant food.]    The modern agriculturist realizes that the soil is a laboratory for the  production of plant food and he ordinarily takes more pains to provide a  balanced ration for it than he does for his family. Of course the  necessity of feeding the soil has been known ever since man began to  settle down and the ancient methods of maintaining its fertility, though  discovered accidentally and followed blindly, were sound and  efficacious. Virgil, who like Liberty Hyde Bailey was fond of publishing  agricultural bulletins in poetry, wrote two thousand years ago:      But sweet vicissitudes of rest and toil    Make easy labor and renew the soil    Yet sprinkle sordid ashes all around    And load with fatt'ning dung thy fallow soil.    The ashes supplied the potash and the dung the nitrate and phosphate.  Long before the discovery of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, the custom  prevailed of sowing pea-like plants every third year and then plowing  them under to enrich the soil. But such local supplies were always  inadequate and as soon as deposits of fertilizers were discovered  anywhere in the world they were drawn upon. The richest of these was the  Chincha Islands off the coast of Peru, where millions of penguins and  pelicans had lived in a most untidy manner for untold centuries. The  guano composed of the excrement of the birds mixed with the remains of  dead birds and the fishes they fed upon was piled up to a depth of 120  feet. From this Isle of Penguins--which is not that described by Anatole  France--a billion dollars' worth of guano was taken and the deposit was  soon exhausted.

The corn-cobs were always  scrupulously preserved and mounted on the parapets of the pits. Whenever  a Rebel shot carried away one of these _barbette_ guns, there was  swearing in that particular trench. Strong, who was very sensitive to  this kind of disaster, was complaining bitterly one morning, because he  had lost three \"pieces\" the night before.    \"There's Quite So, now,\" said Strong, \"when a Minie-ball comes _ping_!  and knocks one of his guns to flinders, he merely smiles, and doesn't at  all see the degradation of the thing.\"    Poor Bladburn! As I watched him day by day going about his duties, in  his shy, cheery way, with a smile for every one and not an extra word  for anybody, it was hard to believe he was the same man who, that night  before we broke camp by the Potomac, had poured out to me the story of  his love and sorrow in words that burned in my memory.    While Strong was speaking, Blakely lifted aside the flap of the tent and  looked in on us.    \"Boys, Quite So was hurt last night,\" he said, with a white tremor to  his lip.    \"What!\"    \"Shot on picket.\"    \"Why, he was in the pit next to mine,\" cried Strong.    \"Badly hurt?\"    \"Badly hurt.\"    I knew he was; I need not have asked the question. He never meant to go  back to New England!           *       *       *       *       *    Bladburn was lying on the stretcher in the hospital-tent. The surgeon  had knelt down by him, and was carefully cutting away the bosom of his  blouse. The Latin grammar, stained and torn, slipped, and fell to the  floor. Bladburn gave me a quick glance. I picked up the book, and as I  placed it in his hand, the icy fingers closed softly over mine. He was  sinking fast. In a few minutes the surgeon finished his examination.  When he rose to his feet there were tears on the weather-beaten cheeks.  He was a rough outside, but a tender heart.    \"My poor lad,\" he blurted out, \"it's no use. If you've anything to say,  say it now, for you've nearly done with this world.\"    Then Bladburn lifted his eyes slowly to the surgeon, and the old smile  flitted over his face as he murmured,--    \"Quite so.\"      NOTES    =the first battle of Bull Run=:--Fought July 21, 1861; known in the  South as Manassas.    =Long Bridge=:--A bridge over which the Union soldiers crossed in  fleeing to Washington after the battle of Bull Run.    =Shenandoah=:--A river and a valley in Virginia--the scene of many  events in the Civil War.    =Fairfax Court House=:--Near Manassas Junction.    =On to Richmond=:--In 1861 the newspapers of the North were violently  demanding an attack on Richmond.    =Faneuil Hall=:--An historic hall in Boston, in which important meetings  were held before the Revolution.    =McDowell=:--Irving McDowell, who commanded the Union troops at Bull  Run.    =McClellan=:--George B.

QUESTIONS FOR STUDY    Read the piece through without stopping, so that you can get the story.  Then go back to the beginning and study with the help of the following  questions:--    Compare the first sentence with the first sentence of _Tennessee's  Partner_. What do you think of the method? What is the use of the first  paragraph in _Quite So_? Why the long paragraph giving the setting? Is  this a good method in writing a story? What had become of \"Little  Billy\"? Who was \"Johnny Reb\"? What do you think of bringing in humorous  touches when one is dealing with things so serious as war and battles?  What does \"Drop that!\" refer to? Why does Strong change his tone? Note  what details the author has selected in order to give a clear picture of  \"Quite So\" in a few words. How does the conversation reveal the  stranger's character? What is shown by the fact that \"Quite So\" does not  write any letters? What is the purpose of the episode of \"Muffin Fan\"?  What devices does the author use, in order to bring out the mystery and  the loneliness of \"Quite So\"? Note how the author emphasizes the passage  of time. Why does Bladburn finally tell his story? How does it reveal  his character? Was Mary right in what she did? Why are some sentences in  the text printed in italics? Was Bladburn right in leaving his home  village without explanation? Why did he do so? What do you get from the  sentence, \"He never meant to go back to New England\"? What is the  impression made by the last sentence? Do you like the story?

Where  does he live? Do you see him often? What is he doing when you see him?  Describe him as vividly as you can:--his general appearance; his  clothes; his way of walking. Speak particularly of his face and its  expression. If possible, let us hear him talk. Perhaps you can tell some  of his war stories--in his own words.    =A Mysterious Person=:--Imagine a mysterious person appearing in a  little town where everybody knows everybody else. Tell how he (or she)  arrives. How does he look? What does he do? Explain clearly why he is  particularly hard to account for. What do people say about him? Try to  make each person's remarks fit his individual character. How do people  try to find out about the stranger? Does he notice their curiosity? Do  they ask him questions? If so, give some bits of their conversations  with him. You might go on and make a story of some length out of this.  Show whether the stranger really has any reason for concealing his  identity. Does he get into any trouble? Does an accident reveal who he  is and why he is in the town? Does some one find out by spying upon him?  Or does he tell all about himself, when the right time comes?    Perhaps you can put the story into the form of a series of brief  conversations about the stranger or with him.    =An Incident of the Civil War=:--Select some historical incident, or one  that you have heard from an old soldier, and tell it simply and vividly  in your own words.
