Their wings are like  those of angels, each having twelve, and they attend the chariot  of the sun and go with him, bringing heat and dew as they are  ordered by God. In the morning when the sun starts on his daily  course, the phoenixes and the chalkidri[154] sing, and every bird  flaps its wings, rejoicing the Giver of light, and they sing a  song at the command of the Lord.[155] Among reptiles the  salamander and the shamir are the most marvellous. The salamander  originates from a fire of myrtle wood[156] which has been kept  burning for seven years steadily by means of magic arts. Not  bigger than a mouse, it yet is invested with peculiar properties.  One who smears himself with its blood is invulnerable,[157] and  the web woven by it is a talisman against fire.[158] The people  who lived at the deluge boasted that, were a fire flood to come,  they would protect themselves with the blood of the  salamander.[159]    King Hezekiah owes his life to the salamander. His wicked father,  King Ahaz, had delivered him to the fires of Moloch, and he would  have been burnt, had his mother not painted him with the blood of  the salamander, so that the fire could do him no harm.[160]    The shamir was made at twilight on the sixth day of creation  together with other extraordinary things.[161] It is about as  large as a barley corn, and it possesses the remarkable property  of cutting the hardest of diamonds. For this reason it was used  for the stones in the breastplate worn by the high priest. First  the names of the twelve tribes were traced with ink on the stones  to be set into the breastplate, then the shamir was passed over  the lines, and thus they were graven. The wonderful circumstance  was that the friction wore no particles from the stones. The  shamir was also used for hewing into shape the stones from which  the Temple was built, because the law prohibited iron tools to be  used for the work in the Temple.[162] The shamir may not be put  in an iron vessel for safe-keeping, nor in any metal vessel, it  would burst such a receptacle asunder. It is kept wrapped up in a  woollen cloth, and this in turn is placed in a lead basket filled  with barley bran.[163] The shamir was guarded in Paradise until  Solomon needed it. He sent the eagle thither to fetch the  worm.[164] With the destruction of the Temple the shamir  vanished.[165] A similar fate overtook the tahash, which had been  created only that its skin might be used for the Tabernacle. Once  the Tabernacle was completed, the tahash disappeared. It had a  horn on its forehead, was gaily colored like the turkey-cock, and  belonged to the class of clean animals.[166] Among the fishes  there are also wonderful creatures, the sea-goats and the  dolphins, not to mention leviathan. A sea-faring man once saw a  sea-goat on whose horns the words were inscribed: \"I am a little  sea-animal, yet I traversed three hundred parasangs to offer  myself as food to the leviathan.\"[167] The dolphins are half man  and half fish; they even have sexual intercourse with human  beings; therefore they are called also \"sons of the sea,\" for in  a sense they represent the human kind in the waters.[163]    Though every species in the animal world was created during the  last two days of the six of creation,[169] yet many  characteristics of certain animals appeared later. Cats and mice,  foes now, were friends originally. Their later enmity had a  distinct cause. On one occasion the mouse appeared before God and  spoke: \"I and the cat are partners, but now we have nothing to  eat.\" The Lord answered: \"Thou art intriguing against thy  companion, only that thou mayest devour her. As a punishment, she  shall devour thee.\" Thereupon the mouse: \"O Lord of the world,  wherein have I done wrong?\" God replied: \"O thou unclean reptile,  thou shouldst have been warned by the example of the moon, who  lost a part of her light, because she spake ill of the sun, and  what she lost was given to her opponent.[170] The evil intentions  thou didst harbor against thy companion shall be punished in the  same way. Instead of thy devouring her, she shall devour thee.\"  The mouse: \"O Lord of the world! Shall my whole kind be  destroyed?\" God: \"I will take care that a remnant of thee is  spared.\" In her rage the mouse bit the cat, and the cat in turn  threw herself upon the mouse, and hacked into her with her teeth  until she lay dead. Since that moment the mouse stands in such  awe of the cat that she does not even attempt to defend herself  against her enemy's attacks, and always keeps herself in  hiding.[171] Similarly dogs and cats maintained a friendly  relation to each other, and only later on became enemies. A dog  and a cat were partners, and they shared with each other whatever  they had. It once happened that neither could find anything to  eat for three days. Thereupon the dog proposed that they dissolve  their partnership. The cat should go to Adam, in whose house  there would surely be enough for her to eat, while the dog should  seek his fortune elsewhere. Before they separated, they took an  oath never to go to the same master. The cat took up her abode  with Adam, and she found sufficient mice in his house to satisfy  her appetite. Seeing how useful she was in driving away and  extirpating mice, Adam treated her most kindly. The dog, on the  other hand, saw bad times. The first night after their separation  he spent in the cave of the wolf, who had granted him a night's  lodging. At night the dog caught the sound of steps, and he  reported it to his host, who bade him repulse the intruders. They  were wild animals. Little lacked and the dog would have lost his  life. Dismayed, the dog fled from the house of the wolf, and took  refuge with the monkey. But he would not grant him even a single  night's lodging; and the fugitive was forced to appeal to the  hospitality of the sheep. Again the dog heard steps in the middle  of the night. Obeying the bidding of his host, he arose to chase  away the marauders, who turned out to be wolves. The barking of  the dog apprised the wolves of the presence of sheep, so that the  dog innocently caused the sheep's death. Now he had lost his last  friend. Night after night he begged for shelter, without ever  finding a home. Finally, he decided to repair to the house of  Adam, who also granted him refuge for one night. When wild  animals approached the house under cover of darkness, the dog  began to bark, Adam awoke, and with his bow and arrow he drove  them away. Recognizing the dog's usefulness, he bade him remain  with him always. But as soon as the cat espied the dog in Adam's  house, she began to quarrel with him, and reproach him with  having broken his oath to her. Adam did his best to pacify the  cat. He told her he had himself invited the dog to make his home  there, and he assured her she would in no wise be the loser by  the dog's presence; he wanted both to stay with him. But it was  impossible to appease the cat. The dog promised her not to touch  anything intended for her. She insisted that she could not live  in one and the same house with a thief like the dog. Bickerings  between the dog and the cat became the order of the day. Finally  the dog could stand it no longer, and he left Adam's house, and  betook himself to Seth's. By Seth he was welcomed kindly, and  from Seth's house, he continued to make efforts at reconciliation  with the cat. In vain. Yes, the enmity between the first dog and  the first cat was transmitted to all their descendants until this  very day.[172]    Even the physical peculiarities of certain animals were not  original features with them, but owed their existence to  something that occurred subsequent to the days of creation. The  mouse at first had quite a different mouth from its present  mouth. In Noah's ark, in which all animals, to ensure the  preservation of every kind, lived together peaceably, the pair of  mice were once sitting next to the cat. Suddenly the latter  remembered that her father was in the habit of devouring mice,  and thinking there was no harm in following his example, she  jumped at the mouse, who vainly looked for a hole into which to  slip out of sight. Then a miracle happened; a hole appeared where  none had been before, and the mouse sought refuge in it. The cat  pursued the mouse, and though she could not follow her into the  hole, she could insert her paw and try to pull the mouse out of  her covert. Quickly the mouse opened her mouth in the hope that  the paw would go into it, and the cat would be prevented from  fastening her claws in her flesh. But as the cavity of the mouth  was not big enough, the cat succeeded in clawing the cheeks of  the mouse. Not that this helped her much, it merely widened the  mouth of the mouse, and her prey after all escaped the cat.[173]  After her happy escape, the mouse betook herself to Noah and said  to him, \"O pious man, be good enough to sew up my cheek where my  enemy, the cat, has torn a rent in it.\" Noah bade her fetch a  hair out of the tail of the swine, and with this he repaired the  damage. Thence the little seam-like line next to the mouth of  every mouse to this very day.[174]    The raven is another animal that changed its appearance during  its sojourn in the ark. When Noah desired to send him forth to  find out about the state of the waters, he hid under the wings of  the eagle. Noah found him, however, and said to him, \"Go and see  whether the waters have diminished.\" The raven pleaded: \"Hast  thou none other among all the birds to send on this errand?\"  Noah: \"My power extends no further than over thee and the  dove.\"[175] But the raven was not satisfied. He said to Noah with  great insolence: \"Thou sendest me forth only that I may meet my  death, and thou wishest my death that my wife may be at thy  service.\"[176] "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1494"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews â€” Volume 2 (#8)"],[1,"replied, \"A slave.\" Potiphar continued to question  him, \"Whose slave art thou?\" Joseph: \"I belong to the  Ishmaelites.\" Potiphar: \"How wast thou made a slave?\"  Joseph: \"They bought me in the land of Canaan.\"    But Potiphar refused to give credence to what he said,  and he had also him stripped and beaten. The wife of Potiphar,  standing by the door, saw how Joseph was abused, and  she sent word to her husband, \"Thy verdict is unjust, for  thou punishest the free-born youth that was stolen away  from his place as though he were the one that had committed  a crime.\" As Joseph held firmly to what he had said,  Potiphar ordered him to prison, until his masters should return.  In her sinful longing for him, his wife wanted to  have Joseph in her own house, and she remonstrated with  her husband in these words: \"Wherefore dost thou keep  the captive, nobly-born slave a prisoner? Thou shouldst  rather set him at liberty and have him serve thee.\" He  answered, \"The law of the Egyptians does not permit us to  take what belongs to another before all titles are made  clear,\" and Joseph stayed in prison for twenty-four days,  until the return of the Ishmaelites to Egypt.    Meanwhile they had heard somewhere that Joseph was  the son of Jacob, and they therefore said to him: \"Why  didst thou pretend that thou wast a slave? See, we have  information that thou art the son of a powerful man in  Canaan, and thy father mourns for thee in sackcloth.\"  Joseph was on the point of divulging his secret, but he kept  a check upon himself for the sake of his brethren, and he  repeated that he was a slave.    Nevertheless the Ishmaelites decided to sell him, that he  be not found in their hands, for they feared the revenge of  Jacob, who, they knew, was in high favor with the Lord  and with men. The shopkeeper begged the Ishmaelites to  rescue him from the legal prosecution of Potiphar, and clear  him of the suspicion of man theft. The Ishmaelites in turn  had a conference with Joseph, and bade him testify before  Potiphar that they had bought him for money. He did so,  and then the chief of the eunuchs liberated him from prison,  and dismissed all parties concerned.    With the permission of her husband, Potiphar's wife sent  a eunuch to the Ishmaelites, bidding him to buy Joseph, but  he returned and reported that they demanded an exorbitant  price for the slave. She dispatched a second eunuch, charging  him to conclude the bargain, and though they asked  one mina of gold, or even two, he was not to be sparing of  money, he was to be sure to buy the slave and bring him to  her. The eunuch gave the Ishmaelites eighty pieces of gold  for Joseph, telling his mistress, however, that he had paid  out a hundred pieces. Joseph noticed the deception, but he  kept silent, that the eunuch might not be put to shame.[99]    Thus Joseph became the slave of the idolatrous priest  Potiphar, or Poti-phera, as he was sometimes called.[100] He  had secured possession of the handsome youth for a lewd  purpose, but the angel Gabriel mutilated him in such manner  that he could not accomplish it.[101] His master soon had  occasion to notice that Joseph was as pious as he was beautiful,  for whenever he was occupied with his ministrations,  he would whisper a prayer: \"O Lord of the world, Thou  art my trust, Thou art my protection. Let me find grace  and favor in Thy sight and in the sight of all that see me,  and in the sight of my master Potiphar.\" When Potiphar  noticed the movement of his lips, he said to Joseph, \"Dost  thou purpose to cast a spell upon me?\" \"Nay,\" replied  the youth, \"I am beseeching God to let me find favor in  thine eyes.\"    His prayer was heard. Potiphar convinced himself that  God was with Joseph. Sometimes he would make a test of  Joseph's miraculous powers. If he brought him a glass of  hippocras, he would say, \"I would rather have wine mixed  with absinthe,\" and straightway the spiced wine was  changed into bitter wine. Whatever he desired, he could be  sure to get from Joseph, and he saw clearly that God fulfilled  the wishes of his slave. Therefore he put all the keys of  his house into his hand, and he knew not aught that was  with him,[102] keeping back nothing from Joseph but his  wife.[103]  Seeing that the Shekinah rested upon him, Potiphar treated  Joseph not as a slave, but as a member of his family, for he  said, \"This youth is not cut out for a slave's work, he is  worthy of a prince's place.\"[104] Accordingly, he provided  instruction for him in the arts, and ordered him to have  better fare than the other slaves.[105]    Joseph thanked God for his new and happy state. He  prayed, \"Blessed art Thou, O Lord, that Thou hast caused  me to forget my father's house.\" What made his present  fortunes so agreeable was that he was removed from the  envy and jealousy of his brethren. He said: \"When I was  in my father's house, and he gave me something pretty, my  brethren begrudged me the present, and now, O Lord, I  thank Thee that I live amid plenty.\" Free from anxieties,  he turned his attention to his external appearance. He  painted his eyes, dressed his hair, and aimed to be elegant  in his walk. But God spake to him, saying, \"Thy father  is mourning in sackcloth and ashes, while thou dost eat,  drink, and dress thy hair. Therefore I will stir up thy mistress  against thee, and thou shalt be embarrassed.\"[106] Thus  Joseph's secret wish was fulfilled, that he might be permitted  to prove his piety under temptation, as the piety of his  fathers had been tested.[107]      JOSEPH AND ZULEIKA    \"Throw the stick up in the air, it will always return to its  original place.\" Like Rachel his mother, Joseph was of  ravishing beauty, and the wife of his master was filled with  invincible passion for him.\"[108] Her feeling was heightened by  the astrologic forecast that she was destined to have descendants  through Joseph. This was true, but not in the sense in  which she understood the prophecy. Joseph married her  daughter Asenath later on, and she bore him children, thus  fulfilling what had been read in the stars.\"[109]    In the beginning she did not confess her love to Joseph.  She tried first to seduce him by artifice. On the pretext of  visiting him, she would go to him at night, and, as she had  no sons, she would pretend a desire to adopt him. Joseph  then prayed to God in her behalf, and she bore a son. However,  she continued to embrace him as though he were her  own child, yet he did not notice her evil designs. Finally,  when he recognized her wanton trickery, he mourned many  days, and endeavored to turn her away from her sinful passion  by the word of God. She, on her side, often threatened  him with death, and surrendered him to castigations in order  to make him amenable to her will, and when these means  had no effect upon Joseph, she sought to seduce him with  enticements. She would say, \"I promise thee, thou shalt rule  over me and all I have, if thou wilt but give thyself up to  me. and thou shalt be to me the same as my lawful husband.\"  But Joseph was mindful of the words of his fathers, and he  went into his chamber, and fasted, and prayed to God, that  He would deliver him from the toils of the Egyptian woman.    In spite of the mortifications he practiced, and though he  gave the poor and the sick the food apportioned to him, his  master thought he lived a luxurious life, for those that fast  for the glory of God are made beautiful of countenance.    The wife of Potiphar would frequently speak to her husband  in praise of Joseph's chastity in order that he might  conceive no suspicion of the state of her feelings. And,  again, she would encourage Joseph secretly, telling him not  to fear her husband, that he was convinced of his purity of  life, and though one should carry tales to him about  Joseph and herself, Potiphar would lend them no credence.  And when she saw that all this was ineffectual , she approached  him with the request that he teach her the word  of God, saying, \"If it be thy wish that I forsake idol worship,  then fulfil my desire, and I will persuade that Egyptian  husband of mine to abjure the idols, and we shall walk in the  law of thy God.\" Joseph replied, \"The Lord desireth not  that those who fear Him shall walk in impurity, nor hath He  pleasure in the adulterer.\"    Another time she came to him, and said, \"If thou wilt not  do my desire, I will murder the Egyptian and wed with thee  according to the law.\" Whereat Joseph rent his garment,  and he said, \"O woman, fear the Lord, and do not execute  this evil deed, that thou mayest not bring destruction down  upon thyself, for I will proclaim thy impious purposes to all  in public.\"    Again, she sent him a dish prepared with magic spells, by  means of which she hoped to get him into her power. But  when the eunuch set it before him, he saw the image of a  man handing him a sword together with the dish, and,  warned by the vision, he took good care not to taste of the  food. A few days later his mistress came to him, and asked  him why he had not eaten of what she had sent him. He reproached  her, saying, \"How couldst thou tell me, I do not  come nigh unto the idols, but only unto the Lord? The God  of my fathers hath revealed thy iniquity to me through an  angel, but that thou mayest know that the malice of the  wicked has no power over those who fear God in purity, I  shall eat thy food before thine eyes, and the God of my  fathers and the angel of Abraham will be with me.\" The  wife of Potiphar fell upon her face at the feet of Joseph, and  amid tears she promised not to commit this sin again.    But her unholy passion for Joseph did not depart from  her, and her distress over her unfulfilled wish made her look  so ill that her husband said to her, \"Why is thy countenance  fallen?\" And she replied, \"I have a pain at my heart, and  the groanings of my spirit oppress me.\"    Once when she was alone with Joseph, she"]]]
