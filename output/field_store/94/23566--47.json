We used to believe that the love  for the young girl that suddenly blooms forth in the callow youth was  an entirely new affair, something suddenly planted in him as he  developed into manhood; but now we know, thanks to the uncovering of  human nature by the painstaking investigations of the psycho-analytic  school of psychologists, that the seeds of the love-life are planted,  not in puberty, but with the beginning of life itself. Looked at in  one way, all infancy and childhood are a preparation, a training of  the love-instinct which is to be ready at the proper time to find its  mate and play its part in the perpetuation of the race. Nature begins  early. As she plants in the tiny baby all the organs that shall be  needed during its lifetime, so she plants the rudiments of all the  impulses and tendencies that shall later be developed into the  full-grown instincts. There have been found to be four periods in the  love-life of the growing child, three of them preparatory steps  leading up to maturity; periods in which the main current of love is  directed respectively toward self, parents, comrades, and finally  toward lover or mate.    =Like Narcissus.= In the first stage, the baby's interest is in his  own body. He is getting acquainted with himself, and he soon finds  that his body contains possibilities of pleasurable sensations which  may be repeated by the proper stimulation. Besides the  hunger-satisfaction that it brings, the act of sucking is pleasurable  in itself, and so the baby begins to suck his thumb or his quilts or  his rattle. Later, this impulse to stimulate the nerves about the  mouth finds its satisfaction in kissing, and still later it plays a  definite part in the wooing process; but at first the child is  self-sufficient and finds his pleasure entirely within himself. Other  regions of the body yield similar pleasure. We often find a tiny child  rubbing his genital organs or his thighs or taking exaggerated  pleasure in riding on someone's foot in order to stimulate these  nerves, which he has discovered at first merely by chance. When he  begins to run around, he loves to exhibit his own body, to go about  naked. None of this is naughtiness or perversion; it is only Nature's  preparation of trends that she will later need to use. The child is  normally and naturally in love with himself.[11] But he must not  linger too long in this stage. None of the channels which his  life-force is cutting must be dug too deep, else in later life they  will offer lines of least resistance which may, on occasion, invite  illness or perversion.    [Footnote 11: This is the stage which is technically known as  auto-eroticism or self-love.]    =In Love with His Family.= Presently Nature pries the child loose from  love of himself and directs part of his interests to people outside  himself. Before he is a year old, part of his love is turned to  others. In this stage it is natural that at first his affection should  center on those who make up his home circle,--his parents and other  members of the household. Even in this early choice we see a  foreshadowing of his future need. The normal little boy is especially  fond of his mother, and the normal little girl of her father. Not all  the love goes to the parent of the opposite sex, but if the child be  normal, a noticeably larger part finds its way in that direction.  Observing parents can often see unmistakable signs of jealousy: toward  the parent of the same sex, or the brother or sister of the same sex.  The little boy who sleeps with his mother while his father is away, or  who on these occasions gets all the attention and all the petting he  craves, is naturally eager to perpetuate this state of affairs. Many a  small boy has been heard to say that he wished his father would go  away and stay all the time,--to the horror of the parents who do not  understand. All this is natural enough, but it is not to be  encouraged. The pattern of the father or the mother must not be  stamped too deep in the impressionable child-mind. Too little love and  sympathy are bad, leading to repression and a morbid turning in of the  love-force; but too much petting, too many caresses are just as bad.  Sentimental self-indulgence on the part of the parents has been  repeatedly proved to be the cause of many a later illness for the  child. As the right kind of family love and comradeship, the kind that  leads to freedom and self-dependence, is among the highest forces in  life, so the wrong kind is among the worst. Parents and their  substitutes--nurses, sisters, and brothers--are but temporary  stopping-places for the growing love, stepping-stones to later  attachments which are biologically more necessary. The small boy who  lets himself be coddled and petted too long by his adoring relatives,  who does not shake off their caresses and run away to the other boys,  is doomed to failure, and, as we shall later see, probably to  illness.[12]    [Footnote 12: One of the best discussions of this theme is found in  the chapter \"The Only or Favorite Child,\" by A.A. Brill, in  _Psychoanalysis_.]    In the later infantile period, the child, besides wanting to exhibit  his own body, shows marked interest in looking at the bodies of  others, and marked curiosity on sex-questions in general. He  particularly wants to know \"where babies come from.\" If his questions  are unfortunately met by embarrassment or laughing evasion, or by  obvious lying about the stork or the doctor or the angels, his  curiosity is only whetted, and he comes to the very natural conclusion  that all matters of sex are sinful, disgusting, and indecent, and to  be investigated only on the sly. This conception cannot be brought  into harmony with the unconscious mental processes arising from his  race-instincts nor with his instinctive sense that \"whatever is is  right.\" The resulting conflict in some four-year-old children is  surprisingly intense. Astonished indeed would many parents be if they  knew what was going on inside the heads of their \"innocent\" little  children; not \"bad\" things, but pathetic things which a little candor  would have avoided.    Alongside the rudimentary impulses of showing and looking, there is  developed another set of trends which Nature needs to use later on,  the so-called sadistic and masochistic impulses, the desire to  dominate and master and even to inflict pain, and its opposite impulse  which takes pleasure in yielding and submitting to mastery. These  traits, harking back to the time when the male needed to capture by  force, are of course much more evident in adolescence and especially  in love-making, but have their beginning in childhood, as many a  mother of cruel children knows to her sorrow. In adolescence, when  sex-differentiation is much more marked, the dominating impulse is  stronger in the boy and the yielding impulse in the girl; but in  little children the differentiation has not yet begun.    =Gang and Chum.= At about four or five years the child leaves the  infantile stage of development, with its self-love and its intense  devotion to parents and their substitutes. He begins to be especially  interested in playmates of his own sex, to care more for the opinions  of the gang--or if it be a little girl, of the chum--than for those of  the parents. The life-force is leading him on to the next step in his  education, freeing him little by little from a too-hampering  attachment to his family. This does not mean that he does not love  his father and mother. It means only that some of his love is being  turned toward the rest of the world, that he may be an independent,  socially useful man.    This period between infancy and puberty is known as the latency  period. All interest in sex disappears, repressed by the spontaneously  developing sense of shame and modesty and by the impact of education  and social disapproval. The child forgets that he was ever curious on  sex-matters and lets his curiosity turn into other, more acceptable  channels.    =The Mating-Time.= We are familiar with the changes that take place at  puberty. We laugh at the girl who, throwing off her tom-boy ways,  suddenly wants her skirts let down and her hair done up. We laugh at  the boy who suddenly leaves off being a rowdy, and turns into a  would-be dandy. We scold because this same boy and girl who have  always been so \"sweet and tractable\" become, almost overnight, surly  and cantankerous, restive under authority and impatient of family  restraint. We should neither laugh nor scold, if we understood. Nature  is succeeding in her purpose. She has led the young life on from self  to parents, from parents to gang or chum, and now she is trying to  lead it away from all its earlier attachments, to set it free for its  final adventure in loving. The process is painful, so painful that it  sometimes fails of accomplishment. In any case, the strain is  tremendous, needing all the wisdom and understanding which the family  has to offer. It is no easy task for any person to free himself from  the sense of dependence and protection, and the shielding love that  have always been his; to weigh anchors that are holding him to the  past and to start out on the voyage alone.    At this time of change, the chemistry of the body plays an important  part in the development of the mental traits; all half-developed  tendencies are given power through the maturing of the sex-glands,  which bind them into an organization ready for their ultimate purpose.  The current is now turned on, and the machinery, which has been  furnished from the beginning, is ready for its task. After a few false  starts in the shape of \"puppy love,\" the mature instinct, if it be  successful, seeks until from among the crowd it finds its mate. It has  graduated from the training-school and is ready for life.      CIVILIZATION'S PROBLEM    =When"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988"],[0,"Cicero's Tusculan Disputations (#8)"],[1,"; for to perish implies a parting-asunder, a division, a  disunion, of those parts which, while it subsisted, were held together  by some band. And it was because he was influenced by these and similar  reasons that Socrates neither looked out for anybody to plead for him  when he was accused, nor begged any favor from his judges, but  maintained a manly freedom, which was the effect not of pride, but of  the true greatness of his soul; and on the last day of his life he held  a long discourse on this subject; and a few days before, when he might  have been easily freed from his confinement, he refused to be so; and  when he had almost actually hold of that deadly cup, he spoke with the  air of a man not forced to die, but ascending into heaven.    XXX. For so indeed he thought himself, and thus he spoke: \"That there  were two ways, and that the souls of men, at their departure from the  body, took different roads; for those which were polluted with vices  that are common to men, and which had given themselves up entirely to  unclean desires, and had become so blinded by them as to have  habituated themselves to all manner of debauchery and profligacy, or to  have laid detestable schemes for the ruin of their country, took a road  wide of that which led to the assembly of the Gods; but they who had  preserved themselves upright and chaste, and free from the slightest  contagion of the body, and had always kept themselves as far as  possible at a distance from it, and while on earth had proposed to  themselves as a model the life of the Gods, found the return to those  beings from whom they had come an easy one.\" Therefore, he argues, that  all good and wise men should take example from the swans, who are  considered sacred to Apollo, not without reason, but particularly  because they seem to have received the gift of divination from him, by  which, foreseeing how happy it is to die, they leave this world with  singing and joy. Nor can any one doubt of this, unless it happens to us  who think with care and anxiety about the soul (as is often the case  with those who look earnestly at the setting sun), to lose the sight of  it entirely; and so the mind's eye, viewing itself, sometimes grows  dull, and for that reason we become remiss in our contemplation. Thus  our reasoning is borne about, harassed with doubts and anxieties, not  knowing how to proceed, but measuring back again those dangerous tracts  which it has passed, like a boat tossed about on the boundless ocean.  But these reflections are of long standing, and borrowed from the  Greeks. But Cato left this world in such a manner as if he were  delighted that he had found an opportunity of dying; for that God who  presides in us forbids our departure hence without his leave. But when  God himself has given us a just cause, as formerly he did to Socrates,  and lately to Cato, and often to many others--in such a case, certainly  every man of sense would gladly exchange this darkness for that light:  not that he would forcibly break from the chains that held him, for  that would be against the law; but, like a man released from prison by  a magistrate or some lawful authority, so he too would walk away, being  released and discharged by God. For the whole life of a philosopher is,  as the same philosopher says, a meditation on death.    XXXI. For what else is it that we do, when we call off our minds from  pleasure, that is to say, from our attention to the body, from the  managing our domestic estate, which is a sort of handmaid and servant  of the body, or from duties of a public nature, or from all other  serious business whatever? What else is it, I say, that we do, but  invite the soul to reflect on itself? oblige it to converse with  itself, and, as far as possible, break off its acquaintance with the  body? Now, to separate the soul from the body, is to learn to die, and  nothing else whatever. Wherefore take my advice; and let us meditate on  this, and separate ourselves as far as possible from the body, that is  to say, let us accustom ourselves to die. This will be enjoying a life  like that of heaven even while we remain on earth; and when we are  carried thither and released from these bonds, our souls will make  their progress with more rapidity; for the spirit which has always been  fettered by the bonds of the body, even when it is disengaged, advances  more slowly, just as those do who have worn actual fetters for many  years: but when we have arrived at this emancipation from the bonds of  the body, then indeed we shall begin to live, for this present life is  really death, which I could say a good deal in lamentation for if I  chose.    _A._ You have lamented it sufficiently in your book on Consolation; and  when I read that, there is nothing which I desire more than to leave  these things; but that desire is increased a great deal by what I have  just heard.    _M._ The time will come, and that soon, and with equal certainty,  whether you hang back or press forward; for time flies. But death is so  far from being an evil, as it lately appeared to you, that I am  inclined to suspect, not that there is no other thing which is an evil  to man, but rather that there is nothing else which is a real good to  him; if, at least, it is true that we become thereby either Gods  ourselves, or companions of the Gods. However, this is not of so much  consequence, as there are some of us here who will not allow this. But  I will not leave off discussing this point till I have convinced you  that death can, upon no consideration whatever, be an evil.    _A._ How can it, after what I now know?    _M._ Do you ask how it can? There are crowds of arguers who contradict  this; and those not only Epicureans, whom I regard very little, but,  somehow or other, almost every man of letters; and, above all, my  favorite Dicaearchus is very strenuous in opposing the immortality of  the soul: for he has written three books, which are entitled Lesbiacs,  because the discourse was held at Mitylene, in which he seeks to prove  that souls are mortal. The Stoics, on the other hand, allow us as long  a time for enjoyment as the life of a raven; they allow the soul to  exist a great while, but are against its eternity.    XXXII. Are you willing to hear then why, even allowing this, death  cannot be an evil.    _A._ As you please; but no one shall drive me from my belief in  mortality.    _M._ I commend you, indeed, for that; though we should not be too  confident in our belief of anything; for we are frequently disturbed by  some subtle conclusion. We give way and change our opinions even in  things that are more evident than this; for in this there certainly is  some obscurity. Therefore, should anything of this kind happen, it is  well to be on our guard.    _A._ You are right in that; but I will provide against any accident.    _M._ Have you any objection to our dismissing our friends the  Stoics--those, I mean, who allow that the souls exist after they have  left the body, but yet deny that they exist forever?    _A._ We certainly may dismiss the consideration of those men who admit  that which is the most difficult point in the whole question, namely,  that a soul can exist independently of the body, and yet refuse to  grant that which is not only very easy to believe, but which is even  the natural consequence of the concession which they have made--that if  they can exist for a length of time; they most likely do so forever.    _M._ You take it right; that is the very thing. Shall we give,  therefore, any credit to Pauaestius, when he dissents from his master,  Plato? whom he everywhere calls divine, the wisest, the holiest of men,  the Homer of philosophers, and whom he opposes in nothing except this  single opinion of the soul's immortality: for he maintains what nobody  denies, that everything which has been generated will perish, and that  even souls are generated, which he thinks appears from their  resemblance to those of the men who begot them; for that likeness is as  apparent in the turn of their minds as in their bodies. But he brings  another reason--that there is nothing which is sensible of pain which  is not also liable to disease; but whatever is liable to disease must  be liable to death. The soul is sensible of pain, therefore it is  liable to perish.    XXXIII. These arguments may be refuted; for they proceed from his not  knowing that, while discussing the subject of the immortality of the  soul, he is speaking of the intellect, which is free from all turbid  motion; but not of those parts of the mind in which those disorders,  anger and lust, have their seat, and which he whom he is opposing, when  he argues thus, imagines to be distinct and separate from the mind. Now  this resemblance is more remarkable in beasts, whose souls are void of  reason. But the likeness in men consists more in the configuration of  the bodies: and it is of no little consequence in what bodies the soul  is lodged; for there are many things which depend on the body that give  an edge to the soul, many which blunt it. Aristotle, indeed, says that  all men of great genius are melancholy; so that I should not have been  displeased to have been somewhat duller than I am. He instances many,  and, as if it were matter of fact, brings his reasons for it. But if  the power of those things that proceed from the body be so great as to  influence the mind (for they are the things, whatever they are, that  occasion this likeness), still that does not necessarily prove why a  similitude of souls should be generated. I say nothing about cases of  unlikeness. I wish Panaetius could be here: he lived with Africanus. I  would inquire of him which of his family the nephew of Africanus's  brother was like? Possibly he may in person have resembled his father;  but in his manners he was so like every profligate, abandoned man, that  it was impossible to be more so. Whom did the grandson of"]]]
