The Chartist Movement. The Chartists demanded (1) Annual  Parliaments; (2) Manhood Suffrage; (3) Vote by ballot; (4) Equal  electoral districts; (5) Abolition of the property qualification for  members of Parliament; (6) Payment for members of Parliament. The  Reform Act of 1832 had brought the middle classes into power, and  the working classes were now striving to better their own condition.    The Anti-Corn Law League, formed in this year, was largely a  middle-class agitation supported by merchants and manufacturers.  The great northern towns had been enfranchised by the Reform Bill,  and sent as leaders of the movement Richard Cobden and John Bright.  Both parties in Parliament were opposed to a total abolition of the  Corn Laws.    1842. A motion for Free Trade defeated in Parliament by a large  majority.    1843. Agitation in Ireland for the Repeal of the Union. Daniel  O'Connell, the leader, arrested. He was found guilty of conspiracy,  but his sentence was afterward revoked by the House of Lords.    1845. Failure of the potato crop in Ireland.    1846. Repeal of the Corn Laws, in order to open the ports free to  food stuffs. Free Trade established and the prices of food begin to  fall.    1848. The year of Revolution. France proclaims a Republic with Prince  Louis Napoleon, nephew of Napoleon I, as its President. Risings in  Austria and Italy.    Renewal of the Chartist agitation. The meeting in London to present  a Petition to Parliament proves a failure.    1853-56. Years of prosperity owing to Free Trade and growth of  intelligence among the working classes prove the chief causes of the  death of Chartism. The workers now begin to aim at reforms through  their Trades Unions. The Co-operative Movement set on foot in  Rochdale in 1844 leads to the formation of many other branches.    Between the years 1851 and 1865 national imports nearly treble, and  exports more than double, themselves.    THOMAS CARLYLE (1795-1881).

CHAPTER VII: _The Children of England_      \"From the folding of its robe, it brought two children; wretched,  abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. . . . They were a boy and a  girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate, too,  in their humility. . . . 'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking  down upon them. 'And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers.  This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all  of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow  I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.'\"[8]    [Footnote 8: Charles Dickens, _A Christmas Carol_.]    In surveying the long reign of Queen Victoria nothing strikes one  more than the gradual growth of interest in children, and the many  changes in the nation's ideas of their upbringing and education. At  the beginning of her reign the little children of the poor were for  the most part slaves, and were often punished more cruelly by their  taskmasters than the slaves one reads of in _Uncle Tom's Cabin_.    When Disraeli, afterward Lord Beaconsfield and Prime Minister, wrote  _Sybil_, he drew, in that book, a terrible picture of the life of  children in the manufacturing districts and in the country villages.  The following extract speaks for itself:    \"There are many in this town who are ignorant of their very names;  very few who can spell them. It is rare that you meet with a young  person who knows his own age; rarer to find the boy who has seen a  book, or the girl who has seen a flower. Ask them the name of their  sovereign and they will laugh; who rules them on earth or who can  save them in heaven are alike mysteries to them.\"    In such a town as Disraeli describes there were no schools of any  kind, and the masters treated their apprentices \"as the Mamelouks  treated the Egyptians.\" The author declares that \"there is more  serfdom now in England than at any time since the Conquest. . . .  The people were better clothed, better fed, and better lodged just  before the Wars of the Roses than they are at this moment. The average  term of life among the working classes is seventeen.\"    One of the first results of machinery taking the place of human labour  was that an enormous number of women and young children of both sexes  were employed in the factories in place of grown men, who were no  longer needed. Especially in the spinning mills thousands of men were  thrown out of work, and lower wages were paid to those who took their  place. This led directly to the breaking up of the home and home-life.  The wives were often obliged to spend twelve to thirteen hours a day  in the mills; the very young children, left to themselves, grew up  like wild weeds and were often put out to nurse at a shilling or  eighteenpence a day.    One reads of tired children driven to their work with blows; of  children who, \"too tired to go home, hide away in the wool in the  drying-room to sleep there, and could only be driven out of the  factory with straps; how many hundreds came home so tired every night  that they could eat no supper for sleepiness and want of appetite,  that their parents found them kneeling by the bedside where they had  fallen asleep during their prayers.\"    Elizabeth Barrett Browning, one of the greatest poets of Victoria's  reign, pleads for mercy and human kindness in her \"Cry of the  Children.\"        Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers,        Ere the sorrow comes with years?      They are leaning their young heads against their mothers,        And _that_ cannot stop their tears.      The young lambs are bleating in the meadows,        The young birds are chirping in the nest,      The young fawns are playing with the shadows,        The young flowers are blowing toward the west--      But the young, young children, O my brothers,        They are weeping bitterly!      They are weeping in the playtime of the others,        In the country of the free.        \"For oh,\" say the children, \"we are weary,        And we cannot run or leap;      If we cared for any meadows, it were merely        To drop down in them and sleep.      Our knees tremble sorely in the stooping,        We fall upon our faces, trying to go;      And, underneath our heavy eyelids drooping        The reddest flower would look as pale as snow;      For, all day, we drag our burden tiring        Through the coal-dark underground--      Or, all day, we drive the wheels of iron        In the factories, round and round.\"    In the country the state of affairs was no better. New systems of  industrial production threw large numbers of farm hands out of work,  the rate of wages fell, and machinery, steam, and the work of women  and children took the place of the labourer.    The children found a champion in Lord Ashley, afterward Lord  Shaftesbury, who succeeded in the face of much opposition in his  efforts to pass laws which should do away with such shameful wrong  and injustice.    The increased amount of coal used (15-1/2 million tons at the  beginning of the century, 64-1/2 million tons in 1854) naturally led  to the demand for more workers, and it was owing to this that the  proposals of Lord Shaftesbury met with such opposition from the  mine-owners, who feared that if child labour were made illegal they  would not have sufficient 'hands' to work the mines and that they  would have to pay higher wages.

Moreover, the direction of the secondary current will be opposite  to that of the primary, because the magnetic circuits which are opened  up by the primary current in magnetizing the core, or which are closed  or collapsed by it in demagnetizing the core, will always cut the  secondary coil in the direction proper for this result. Transformers  of the straight core type with very soft iron in the cores and not too  high rates of alternation should approximate more nearly the  theoretical relation of primary and secondary waves, because the  magnetic changes in the core are capable of taking place almost  simultaneously with the changes of strength of the primary current.  This fact also has other important practical and theoretical bearings.    Let us assume a plain iron core, Fig. 7, magnetized as indicated, so  that its poles, N, S, complete their magnetic circuits by what is  called free field or lines in space around it. Let a coil of wire be  wound thereon as indicated. Now assume that the magnetism is to be  lost or cease, either suddenly or slowly. An electric potential will  be set up in the coil, and if it has a circuit, work or energy will be  produced or given out in that circuit, and in any other inductively  related to it. Hence the magnetic field represents work or potential  energy. But to develop potential in the wire the lines must cut the  wire. This they can do by collapsing or closing on themselves. The bar  seems, therefore, to lose its magnetism by gaining it all, and in  doing so all the external lines of force moving inward cut the wire.  The magnetic circuits shorten and short-circuit themselves in the bar,  perhaps as innumerable molecular magnetic circuits interior to the  iron medium. To remagnetize the bar we may pass an electric current  through the coil. The small closed circuits are again distended, the  free field appears, and the lines moving outward cut across the wire  coil opposite to the former direction and produce a counter potential  in the wire, and consequent absorption of the energy represented in  the free field produced. As before studied, the magnetism cannot  disappear without giving out the energy it represents, even though the  wire coil be on open circuit, and therefore unable to discharge that  energy. The coil open-circuited is static, not dynamic. In such  assumed case the lines in closing cut the core and heat it. Let us,  however, laminate the core or subdivide it as far as possible, and we  appear to have cut off this escape for the energy. This is not really  so, however. We have simply increased the possible rate of speed of  closure, or movement of the lines, and so have increased for the  divided core the intensity of the actions of magnetic friction and  local currents in the core, the latter still receiving the energy of  the magnetic circuit. This reasoning is based on the possibility in  this case of cutting off the current in the magnetizing coil and  retaining the magnetic field. This is of itself probably impossible  with soft iron. That the core receives the energy when the coil cannot  is shown in the well known fact that in some dynamos with armatures of  bobbins on iron cores, the running of the armature coils on open  circuit gives rise to dangerous heating of the cores, and that under  normal work the heating is less. In the former case the core  accumulates the energy represented in the magnetic changes. In the  latter the external circuit of the machine and its wire coils take the  larger part of the energy which is expended in doing the work in the  circuit. In this case, also, the current in the coils causes a  retardation of the speed of change and extent of change of magnetism  in the iron cores, which keeps down the intensity of the magnetic  reaction. In fact, this retardation or lag and reduction of range of  magnetic change may in some machines be made so great by closing the  circuit of the armature coils themselves or short-circuiting them that  the total heat developed in the cores is much less than under normal  load.    [Illustration: Fig. 7.]    I wish now, in closing, to refer briefly to phenomena of moving lines  of force, and to the effects of speed of movement. In order to  generate a given potential in a length of conductor we have choice of  certain conditions. We can vary the strength of field and we can vary  the velocity. We can use a strong field and slow movement of  conductor, or we can use a weak field and rapid movement of the  conductor. But we find also that where the conductor has large section  it is liable to heat from eddy currents caused by one part of its  section being in a stronger field than another at the same time. One  part cuts the lines where they are dense and the other where they are  not dense, with the result of difference of potential and local  currents which waste energy in heat. We cannot make the conductor move  in a field of uniform density, because it must pass into and out of  the field. The conditions just stated are present in dynamos for heavy  current work, where the speed of cutting of lines is low and the  armature conductor large in section.    But we find that in a transformer secondary we can use very large  section of conductor, even (as in welding machines) 12 to 15 square  inches solid copper, without meeting appreciable difficulty from eddy  currents in it. The magnetic lines certainly cut the heavy conductor  and generate the heavy current and potential needed. What difference,  if any, exists? In the transformer the currents are generated by  magnetic field of very low density, in which the lines are moving  across the conductor with extreme rapidity. The velocity of emanation  of lines around the primary coil is probably near that of light, and  each line passes across the section secondary conductor in a  practically inappreciable time. There is no cause then for differences  of potential at different parts of the section heavy secondary. Then  to avoid eddy currents in large conductors and generate useful  currents in them, we may cause the conductor to be either moved into  and out of a low density field with very great speed, or better, we  must cause the lines of a very low or diffused field to traverse or  cut across the conductor with very high velocity.    It is a known fact that, in dynamos with large section armature  conductors, there are less eddy currents produced in the conductors  when they are provided with iron cores or wound upon iron cores than  when the conductors are made into flat bobbins moved in front of field  poles. Projections existing on the armature between which the  conductors are placed have a like effect, and enable us to employ  heavy bars or bundles of wire without much difficulty from local  currents. The reason is simple. In the armatures with coils without  iron in them, or without projections extending between the turns, the  conductor moves into and out of a very dense field at comparatively  low velocity, so that any differences of potential developed in the  parts of the section of conductor have full effect and abundant time  to act in setting up harmful local currents. In the cases in which  iron projects through the coil or conductor, the real action is that  the lines of the magnetic circuits move at high speeds across the  conductor, and the conductor is at all times in a field of very low  density. Figs. 8 and 9 will make this plain. In Fig. 8 we have shown a  smooth armature surface, having a heavy conductor laid thereon, and  which is at a just entering a dense field at the edge of the pole,  N, and at b leaving such field. It will be seen that when in such  position the conductor, if wide, is subjected to varying field  strength, and moves at a low speed for the generation of the working  potential as it passes through the field, thus giving rise to eddy  currents in the conductor.    [Illustration: Fig. 8.]    In Fig. 9 the conductors are set down between projections, in which  case both armature and field poles are laminated or subdivided. As  each projection leaves the edge of field pole, N, the lines which it  had concentrated on and through it snap backward at an enormous speed,  and cross the gap to the next succeeding projection on the armature,  cutting the whole section of the heavy armature conductor at  practically the same instant. This brisk transfer of lines goes on  from each projection to the succeeding one in front of the field pole,  leaving a very low density of field at any time between the  projections. The best results would be obtained when the armature  conductor does not project beyond or quite fill the depth of groove  between the projections. Of course there are other remedies for the  eddy current difficulty, notably the stranding and twisting of the  conductor on the armatures so as to average the position of the parts  of the compound conductor.    [Illustration: Fig. 9.]    Perhaps the most extreme case of what may be called dilution of field  by projections and by closed magnetic circuits in transformers would  be that of a block of iron, B, Fig. 10, moved between poles, N and S,  and having a hole through it, into and through which a conductor is  carried. The path through the iron is so good that we can scarcely  consider that any lines cross the hole from N to S; yet as B moves  forward there is a continual snapping transfer of"]]]
