[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16949"],[0,"Flowers from a Persian Garden and Other Papers (#8)"],[1,"may be the end of this frivolity and talk!\"  After the flowery season of summer was gone, and the black time of  winter was come, thorns took the station of the Rose, and the raven the  perch of the Nightingale. The storms of autumn raged in fury, and the  foliage of the grove was shed upon the ground. The cheek of the leaf was  turned yellow, and the breath of the wind was chill and blasting. The  gathering cloud poured down hailstones, like pearls, and flakes of snow  floated like camphor on the bosom of the air. Suddenly the Nightingale  returned into the garden, but he met neither the bloom of the Rose nor  fragrance of the spikenard; notwithstanding his thousand-songed tongue,  he stood stupified and mute, for he could discover no flower whose form  he might admire, nor any verdure whose freshness he might enjoy. The  Thorn turned round to him and said: \"How long, silly bird, wouldst thou  be courting the society of the Rose? Now is the season that in the  absence of thy charmer thou must put up with the heart-rending bramble  of separation.\" The Nightingale cast his eye upon the scene around him,  but saw nothing fit to eat. Destitute of food, his strength and  fortitude failed him, and in his abject helplessness he was unable to  earn himself a little livelihood. He called to his mind and said:  \"Surely the Ant had in former days his dwelling underneath this tree,  and was busy in hoarding a store of provision: now I will lay my wants  before her, and, in the name of good neighbourship, and with an appeal  to her generosity, beg some small relief. Peradventure she may pity my  distress and bestow her charity upon me.\" Like a poor suppliant, the  half-famished Nightingale presented himself at the Ant's door, and said:  \"Generosity is the harbinger of prosperity, and the capital stock of  good luck. I was wasting my precious life in idleness whilst thou wast  toiling hard and laying up a hoard. How considerate and good it were of  thee wouldst thou spare me a portion of it.\" The Ant replied:    \"Thou wast day and night occupied in idle talk, and I in attending to  the needful: one moment thou wast taken up with the fresh blandishment  of the Rose, and the next busy in admiring the blossoming spring. Wast  thou not aware that every summer has its fall and every road an  end?\"[15]       [13] The name of a musical instrument.       [14] The fancied love of the nightingale for the rose is a          favourite theme of Persian poets.       [15] Cf. the fable of Anianus: After laughing all summer at          her toil, the Grasshopper came in winter to borrow part          of the Ant's store of food. \"Tell me,\" said the Ant,          \"what you did in the summer?\" \"I sang,\" replied the          Grasshopper. \"Indeed,\" rejoined the Ant. \"Then you may          dance and keep yourself warm during the winter.\"    These are a few more of Saadi's aphorisms:    Riches are for the comfort of life, and not life for the accumulation of  riches.[16]       [16] Auvaiyar, the celebrated Indian poetess, in her          _Nalvali_, says:              Hark! ye who vainly toil and wealth            Amass--O sinful men, the soul            Will leave its nest; where then will be            The buried treasure that you lose?    The eye of the avaricious man cannot be satisfied with wealth, any more  than a well can be filled with dew.    A wicked rich man is a clod of earth gilded.    The liberal man who eats and bestows is better than the religious man  who fasts and hoards.    Publish not men's secret faults, for by disgracing them you make  yourself of no repute.    He who gives advice to a self-conceited man stands himself in need of  counsel from another.    The vicious cannot endure the sight of the virtuous, in the same manner  as the curs of the market howl at a hunting-dog, but dare not approach  him.    When a mean wretch cannot vie with any man in virtue, out of his  wickedness he begins to slander him. The abject, envious wretch will  slander the virtuous man when absent, but when brought face to face his  loquacious tongue becomes dumb.    O thou, who hast satisfied thy hunger, to thee a barley loaf is beneath  notice;--that seems loveliness to me which in thy sight appears  deformity.    The ringlets of fair maids are chains for the feet of reason, and snares  for the bird of wisdom.    When you have anything to communicate that will distress the heart of  the person whom it concerns, be silent, in order that he may hear it  from some one else. O nightingale, bring thou the glad tidings of the  spring, and leave bad news to the owl!    It often happens that the imprudent is honoured and the wise despised.  The alchemist died of poverty and distress, while the blockhead found a  treasure under a ruin.    Covetousness sews up the eyes of cunning, and brings both bird and fish  into the net.    Although, in the estimation of the wise, silence is commendable, yet at  a proper season speech is preferable.[17]       [17] \"Comprehensive talkers are apt to be tiresome when we          are not athirst for information; but, to be quite fair,          we must admit that superior reticence is a good deal due          to the lack of matter. Speech is often barren, but          silence does not necessarily brood over a full nest.          Your still fowl, blinking at you without remark, may all          the while be sitting on one addled nest-egg; and when it          takes to cackling will have nothing to announce but that          addled delusion.\"--George Eliot's _Felix Holt_.    Two things indicate an obscure understanding: to be silent when we  should converse, and to speak when we should be silent.    Put not yourself so much in the power of your friend that, if he should  become your enemy, he may be able to injure you.           *       *       *       *       *    Our English poet Young has this observation in his _Night Thoughts_:      Thought, in the mine, may come forth gold or dross;    When coined in word, we know its real worth.    He had been thus anticipated by Saadi: \"To what shall be likened the  tongue in a man's mouth? It is the key of the treasury of wisdom. When  the door is shut, who can discover whether he deals in jewels or  small-wares?\"    The poet Thomson, in his _Seasons_, has these lines, which have long  been hackneyed:                                  Loveliness    Needs not the aid of foreign ornament,    But is when unadorned adorned the most.    Saadi had anticipated him also: \"The face of the beloved,\" he says,  \"requireth not the art of the tire-woman. The finger of a beautiful  woman and the tip of her ear are handsome without an ear-jewel or a  turquoise ring.\" But Saadi, in his turn, was forestalled by the Arabian  poet-hero Antar, in his famous _Mu'allaka_, or prize-poem, which is at  least thirteen hundred years old, where he says: \"Many a consort of a  fair one, whose beauty required no ornaments, have I laid prostrate on  the field.\"    Yet one Persian poet, at least, namely, Nakhshabi, held a different  opinion: \"Beauty,\" he says, \"adorned with ornaments, portends disastrous  events to our hearts. An amiable form, ornamented with diamonds and  gold, is like a melodious voice accompanied by the rabab.\" Again, he  says: \"Ornaments are the universal ravishers of hearts, and an upper  garment for the shoulder is like a cluster of gems. If dress, however,\"  he concedes, \"may have been at any time the assistant of beauty, beauty  is always the animator of dress.\" It is remarkable that homely-featured  women dress more gaudily than their handsome sisters generally, thus  unconsciously bringing their lack of beauty (not to put too fine a point  on it) into greater prominence.    In common with other moralists, Saadi reiterates the maxim that learning  and virtue, precept and practice, should ever go hand in hand. \"Two  persons,\" says he, \"took trouble in vain: he who acquired wealth without  using it, and he who taught wisdom without practising it.\" Again: \"He  who has acquired knowledge and does not practise it, is like unto him  that ploughed but did not sow.\" And again: \"How much soever you may  study science, when you do not act wisely, you are ignorant. The beast  that they load with books is not profoundly wise and learned: what  knoweth his empty skull whether he carrieth fire-wood or books?\" And yet  again: \"A learned man without temperance is like a blind man carrying a  lamp: he showeth the way to others, but does not guide himself.\"    Ingratitude is denounced by all moralists as the lowest of vices. Thus  Saadi says: \"Man is beyond dispute the most excellent of created beings,  and the vilest animal is the dog; but the sages agree that a grateful  dog is better than an ungrateful man. A dog never forgets a morsel,  though you pelt him a hundred times with stones. But if you cherish a  mean wretch for an age, he will fight with you for a mere trifle.\" In  language still more forcible does a Hindu poet denounce this basest of  vices: \"To cut off the teats of a cow;[18] to occasion a pregnant woman  to miscarry; to injure a Brahman--are sins of the most aggravated  nature; but more atrocious than these is ingratitude.\"       [18] The cow is sacred among the Hindus.    The sentiment so tersely expressed in the Chinese proverb, \"He who never  reveals a secret keeps it best,\" is thus finely amplified by Saadi: \"The  matter which you wish to preserve as a secret impart not to every one,  although he may be worthy of confidence; for no one will be so true to  your secret as yourself. It is safer to be silent than to reveal a  secret to any one, and tell him not to mention it. O wise man! stop the  water at the spring-head, for when it is in full stream you cannot  arrest it.\"[19]       [19] Thus also Jami, in his _Baharistan_ (Second \"Garden\"):          \"With regard to a secret divulged and one kept          concealed, there is in use an excellent proverb, that          the one is an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16955"],[0,"Three Translations of The Koran (Al-Qur'an) side (#8)"],[1," them that they should have  entered them except in fear; they shall meet with disgrace in this  world, and they shall have great chastisement in the hereafter.    002.115  Y: To Allah belong the east and the West: Whithersoever ye turn, there  is the presence of Allah. For Allah is All-Pervading, All-Knowing.    P: Unto Allah belong the East and the West, and whithersoever ye turn,  there is Allah's Countenance. Lo! Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.    S: And Allah's is the East and the West, therefore, whither you turn,  thither is Allah's purpose; surely Allah is Amplegiving, Knowing.    002.116  Y: They say: \"Allah hath begotten a son\": Glory be to Him.-Nay, to Him  belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: everything renders  worship to Him.    P: And they say: Allah hath taken unto Himself a son. Be He glorified!  Nay, but whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth is His. All are  subservient unto Him.    S: And they say: Allah has taken to himself a son. Glory be to Him;  rather, whatever is in the heavens and the earth is His; all are  obedient to Him.    002.117  Y: To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth: When He  decreeth a matter, He saith to it: \"Be,\" and it is.    P: The Originator of the heavens and the earth! When He decreeth a  thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is.    S: Wonderful Originator of the heavens and the earth, and when He  decrees an affair, He only says to it, Be, so there it is.    002.118  Y: Say those without knowledge: \"Why speaketh not Allah unto us? or why  cometh not unto us a Sign?\" So said the people before them words of  similar import. Their hearts are alike. We have indeed made clear the  Signs unto any people who hold firmly to Faith (in their hearts).    P: And those who have no knowledge say: Why doth not Allah speak unto  us, or some sign come unto us? Even thus, as they now speak, spake  those (who were) before them. Their hearts are all alike. We have made  clear the revelations for people who are sure.    S: And those who have no knowledge say: Why does not Allah speak to us  or a sign come to us? Even thus said those before them, the like of  what they say; their hearts are all alike. Indeed We have made the  communications clear for a people who are sure.    002.119  Y: Verily We have sent thee in truth as a bearer of glad tidings and a  warner: But of thee no question shall be asked of the Companions of the  Blazing Fire.    P: Lo! We have sent thee (O Muhammad) with the truth, a bringer of glad  tidings and a warner. And thou wilt not be asked about the owners of  hell-fire.    S: Surely We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and  as a warner, and you shall not be called upon to answer for the  companions of the flaming fire.    002.120  Y: Never will the Jews or the Christians be satisfied with thee unless  thou follow their form of religion. Say: \"The Guidance of Allah,-that  is the (only) Guidance.\" Wert thou to follow their desires after the  knowledge which hath reached thee, then wouldst thou find neither  Protector nor helper against Allah.    P: And the Jews will not be pleased with thee, nor will the Christians,  till thou follow their creed. Say: Lo! the guidance of Allah (Himself)  is Guidance. And if thou shouldst follow their desires after the  knowledge which hath come unto thee, then wouldst thou have from Allah  no protecting guardian nor helper.    S: And the Jews will not be pleased with you, nor the Christians until  you follow their religion. Say: Surely Allah's guidance, that is the  (true) guidance. And if you follow their desires after the knowledge  that has come to you, you shall have no guardian from Allah, nor any  helper.    002.121  Y: Those to whom We have sent the Book study it as it should be studied:  They are the ones that believe therein: Those who reject faith  therein,- the loss is their own.    P: Those unto whom We have given the Scripture, who read it with the  right reading, those believe in it. And whoso disbelieveth in it, those  are they who are the losers.    S: Those to whom We have given the Book read it as it ought to be read.  These believe in it; and whoever disbelieves in it, these it is that  are the losers.    002.122  Y: O Children of Israel! call to mind the special favour which I  bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you to all others (for My  Message).    P: O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and  how I preferred you to (all) creatures.    S: O children of Israel, call to mind My favor which I bestowed on you  and that I made you excel the nations.    002.123  Y: Then guard yourselves against a-Day when one soul shall not avail  another, nor shall compensation be accepted from her nor shall  intercession profit her nor shall anyone be helped (from outside).    P: And guard (yourselves) against a day when no soul will in aught avail  another, nor will compensation be accepted from it, nor will  intercession be of use to it; nor will they be helped.    S: And be on your guard against a day when no soul shall avail another  in the least neither shall any compensation be accepted from it, nor  shall intercession profit it, nor shall they be helped.    002.124  Y: And remember that Abraham was tried by his Lord with certain  commands, which he fulfilled: He said: \"I will make thee an Imam to the  Nations.\" He pleaded: \"And also (Imams) from my offspring!\" He  answered:    \"But My Promise is not within the reach of evil-doers.\"  P: And (remember) when his Lord tried Abraham with (His) commands, and  he fulfilled them, He said: Lo! I have appointed thee a leader for  mankind. (Abraham) said: And of my offspring (will there be leaders)?  He said: My covenant includeth not wrong-doers.    S: And when his Lord tried Ibrahim with certain words, he fulfilled  them. He said: Surely I will make you an Imam of men. Ibrahim said: And  of my offspring? My covenant does not include the unjust, said He.    002.125  Y: Remember We made the House a place of assembly for men and a place of  safety; and take ye the station of Abraham as a place of prayer; and We  covenanted with Abraham and Isma'il, that they should sanctify My House  for those who compass it round, or use it as a retreat, or bow, or  prostrate themselves (therein in prayer).    P: And when We made the House (at Makka) a resort for mankind and  sanctuary, (saying): Take as your place of worship the place where  Abraham stood (to pray). And We imposed a duty upon Abraham and  Ishmael, (saying): Purify My house for those who go around and those  who meditate therein and those who bow down and prostrate themselves  (in worship).    S: And when We made the House a pilgrimage for men and a (place of)  security, and: Appoint for yourselves a place of prayer on the  standing-place of Ibrahim. And We enjoined Ibrahim and Ismail saying:  Purify My House for those who visit (it) and those who abide (in it)  for devotion and those who bow down (and) those who prostrate  themselves.    002.126  Y: And remember Abraham said: \"My Lord, make this a City of Peace, and  feed its people with fruits,-such of them as believe in Allah and the  Last Day.\" He said: \"(Yea), and such as reject Faith,-for a while will  I grant them their pleasure, but will soon drive them to the torment of  Fire,- an evil destination (indeed)!\"    P: And when Abraham prayed: My Lord! Make this a region of security and  bestow upon its people fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the  Last Day, He answered: As for him who disbelieveth, I shall leave him  in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the doom of Fire  - a hapless journey's end!    S: And when Ibrahim said: My Lord, make it a secure town and provide its  people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah and the last day.  He said: And whoever disbelieves, I will grant him enjoyment for a  short while, then I will drive him to the chastisement of the fire; and  it is an evil destination.    002.127  Y: And remember Abraham and Isma'il raised the foundations of the House  (With this prayer): \"Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us: For Thou  art the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.\"    P: And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the  House, (Abraham prayed): Our Lord! Accept from us (this duty). Lo!  Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer, the Knower.    S: And when Ibrahim and Ismail raised the foundations of the House: Our  Lord! accept from us; surely Thou art the Hearing, the Knowing:    002.128  Y: \"Our Lord! make of us Muslims, bowing to Thy (Will), and of our  progeny a people Muslim, bowing to Thy (will); and show us our place  for the celebration of (due) rites; and turn unto us (in Mercy); for  Thou art the Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.\"    P: Our Lord! And make us submissive unto Thee and of our seed a nation  submissive unto Thee, and show us our ways of worship, and relent  toward us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Relenting, the Merciful.    S: Our Lord! and make us both submissive to Thee and (raise) from our  offspring a nation submitting to Thee, and show us our ways of devotion  and turn to us (mercifully), surely Thou art the Oft-returning (to  mercy), the Merciful.    002.129  Y: \"Our Lord! send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall  rehearse Thy Signs to them and instruct them in scripture and wisdom,  and sanctify them: For Thou art the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\"    P: Our Lord! And raise up in their midst a messenger from among them who  shall recite unto them Thy revelations, and shall instruct them in the  Scripture and in wisdom and shall make them grow. Lo! Thou, only Thou,  art the Mighty, Wise.    S: Our Lord! and raise up in them a Messenger from among them who shall  recite to them Thy communications and teach them the Book and the  wisdom, and purify them; surely Thou art the Mighty, the Wise.    002.130  Y: And who turns away from the religion of Abraham but such as debase"]]]
