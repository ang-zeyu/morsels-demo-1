His mother, by the interest of  her friends, procured him to be admitted a King's scholar in  Westminster school[1]; his early inclination to poetry was occasioned  by reading accidentally Spencer's Fairy Queen, which, as he himself  gives an account, 'used to lye in his mother's parlour, he knew not by  what accident, for she read no books but those of devotion; the  knights, giants, and monsters filled his imagination; he read the  whole over before he was 12 years old, and was made a poet, as  immediately as a child is made an eunuch.'    In the 16th year of his age, being still at Westminster school, he  published a collection of poems, under the title of Poetical Blossoms,  in which there are many things that bespeak a ripened genius, and a  wit, rather manly than puerile. Mr. Cowley himself has given us a  specimen in the latter end of an ode written when he was but 13 years  of age. 'The beginning of it, says he, is boyish, but of this part  which I here set down, if a very little were corrected, I should not  be much ashamed of it.' It is indeed so much superior to what might be  expected from one of his years, that we shall satisfy the reader's  curiosity by inserting it here.                                     IX.      This only grant me, that my means may lye,    Too low for envy, for contempt too high:        Some honour I would have;    Not from great deeds, but good alone,    The unknown are better than ill known,        Rumour can ope the grave:    Acquaintance I would have, but when 't depends    Not on the number, but the choice of friends.                                      X.      Books should, not business, entertain the light    And sleep, as undisturbed as death, the night:        My house a cottage, more    Than palace, and should fitting be    For all my use, no luxury:        My garden painted o'er    With nature's hand, not art, and pleasures yield,    Horace might envy in his Sabine Field.                                     XI.      Thus would I double my life's fading space,    For he that runs it well, twice runs his race;        And in this true delight,    These unbought sports, that happy state,    I could not fear; nor wish my fate;        But boldly say, each night,    To-morrow let my sun his beams display,    Or in clouds hide them: I have lived to-day.    It is remarkable of Mr. Cowley, as he himself tells us, that he had  this defect in his memory, that his teachers could never bring him to  retain the ordinary rules of grammar, the want of which, however, he  abundantly supplied by an intimate acquaintance with the books  themselves, from whence those rules had been drawn. In 1636 he was  removed to Trinity College in Cambridge, being elected a scholar of  that house[2]. His exercises of all kinds were highly applauded, with  this peculiar praise, that they were fit, not only for the obscurity  of an academical life, but to have made their appearance on the true  theatre of the world; and there he laid the designs, and formed the  plans of most of the masculine, and excellent attempts he afterwards  happily finished. In 1638 he published his Love's Riddle, written at  the time of his being a scholar in Westminster school, and dedicated  by a copy of verses to Sir Kenelm Digby. He also wrote a Latin Comedy  entitled Naufragium Joculare, or the Merry Shipwreck. The first  occasion of his entering into business, was, an elegy he wrote on the  death of Mr. William Harvey, which introduced him to the acquaintance  of Mr. John Harvey, the brother of his deceased friend, from whom he  received many offices of kindness through the whole course of his  life[3]. In 1643, being then master of arts, he was, among many  others, ejected his college, and the university; whereupon, retiring  to Oxford, he settled in St. John's College, and that same year, under  the name of a scholar of Oxford, published a satire entitled the  Puritan and the Papist. His zeal in the Royal cause, engaged him in  the service of the King, and he was present in many of his Majesty's  journies and expeditions; by this means he gained an acquaintance and  familiarity with the personages of the court and of the gown, and  particularly had the entire friendship of my lord Falkland, one of the  principal secretaries of state.    During the heat of the civil war, he was settled in the family of the  earl of St. Alban's, and accompanied the Queen Mother, when she was  obliged to retire into France. He was absent from his native country,  says Wood, about ten years, during which time, he laboured in the  affairs of the Royal Family, and bore part of the distresses inflicted  upon the illustrious Exiles: for this purpose he took several  dangerous journies into Jersey, Scotland, Flanders, Holland, and  elsewhere, and was the principal instrument in maintaining a  correspondence between the King and his Royal Consort, whose letters  he cyphered and decyphered with his own hand.    His poem called the Mistress was published at London 1647, of which he  himself says, \"That it was composed when he was very young. Poets  (says he) are scarce thought free men of their company, without paying  some duties and obliging themselves to be true to love. Sooner or  later they must all pass through that trial, like some Mahometan  monks, who are bound by their order once at least in their life, to  make a pilgrimage to Mecca. But we must not always make a judgment of  their manners from their writings of this kind, as the Romanists  uncharitably do of Beza for a few lascivious sonnets composed by him  in his youth. It is not in this sense that poetry is said to be a kind  of painting: It is not the picture of the poet, but of things, and  persons imagined by him. He may be in his practice and disposition a  philosopher, and yet sometimes speak with the softness of an amorous  Sappho. I would not be misunderstood, as if I affected so much gravity  as to be ashamed to be thought really in love. On the contrary, I  cannot have a good opinion of any man who is not at least capable of  being so.\"    What opinion Dr. Sprat had of Mr. Cowley's Mistress, appears by the  following passage extracted from his Life of Cowley. \"If there needed  any excuse to be made that his love-verses took up so great a share in  his works, it may be alledged that they were composed when he was very  young; but it is a vain thing to make any kind of apology for that  sort of writing. If devout or virtuous men will superciliously forbid  the minds of the young to adorn those subjects about which they are  most conversant, they would put them out of all capacity of performing  graver matters, when they come to them: for the exercise of all men's  wit must be always proper for their age, and never too much above it,  and by practice and use in lighter arguments, they grow up at last to  excell in the most weighty. I am not therefore ashamed to commend Mr.  Cowley's Mistress. I only except one or two expressions, which I wish  I could have prevailed with those that had the right of the other  edition to have left out; but of all the rest, I dare boldly  pronounce, that never yet was written so much on a subject so  delicate, that can less offend the severest rules of morality. The  whole passion of love is intimately described by all its mighty train  of hopes, joys and disquiets. Besides this amorous tenderness, I know  not how in every copy there is something of more useful knowledge  gracefully insinuated; and every where there is something feigned to  inform the minds of wise men, as well as to move the hearts of young  men or women.\"    Our author's comedy, named the Guardian, he afterwards altered, and  published under the title of the Cutter of Coleman-Street. Langbaine  says, notwithstanding Mr. Cowley's modest opinion of this play, it was  acted not only at Cambridge, but several times afterwards privately,  during the prohibition of the stage, and after the King's return  publickly at Dublin; and always with applause. It was this probably  that put the author upon revising it; after which he permitted it to  appear publickly on the stage under a new title, at his royal highness  the Duke of York's theatre. It met with opposition at first from some  who envied the author's unshaken loyalty; but afterwards it was acted  with general applause, and was esteemed by the critics an excellent  comedy.    In the year 1656 it was judged proper by those on whom Mr. Cowley  depended, that he should come over into England, and under pretence of  privacy and retirement, give notice of the situation of affairs in  this nation. Upon his return he published a new edition of all his  poems, consisting of four parts, viz.    1. Miscellanies.    2. The Mistress; or several copies of love-verses.    3. Pindarique Odes, written in imitation of the stile and manner of  Pindar.    4. Davedeis, a sacred poem of the troubles of David in four books.    \"Which, says Dr. Sprat, was written in so young an age, that if we  shall reflect on the vastness of the argument, and his manner of  handling it, he may seem like one of the miracles that he there  adorns; like a boy attempting Goliah. This perhaps, may be the  reason, that in some places, there may be more youthfulness and  redundance of fancy, than his riper judgement would have allowed. But  for the main of it I will affirm, that it is a better instance and  beginning of a divine poem, than ever I yet saw in any language. The  contrivance is perfectly ancient, which is certainly the true form of  an heroic poem, and such as was never yet done by any new devices of  modern wits. The subject was truly divine, even according to God's own  heart. The matters of his invention, all the treasures of knowledge  and histories of the bible. The model of it comprehended all the  learning of the East. The characters lofty and various; the numbers  firm and powerful; the digressions beautiful and proportionable."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16494"],[0,"The Transvaal from Within: A Private Record of Public Affairs (#8)"],[1,"of it and the  alleged responsibility of Natal, Sir Bartle Frere, in a letter to  General Ponsonby, made the following remarks:    The fact is, that while the Boer Republic was a rival and  semi-hostile power, it was a Natal weakness rather to pet the Zulus  as one might a tame wolf, who only devoured one's neighbour's sheep.  We always remonstrated, but rather feebly; and now that both flocks  belong to us, we are rather embarrassed in stopping the wolf's  ravages.    Sir B. Frere realized fully the dangers, and gave his testimony as to  Boer opinion. On December 15, 1877, he wrote, concerning his policy  towards the Zulus:    My great anxiety is, of course, to avoid collision, and I am  satisfied that the only chance I have of keeping clear of it is to  show that I do not fear it. The Boers are, of course, in a state of  great apprehension, and I have ordered those of the two frontier  districts of Utrecht and Wakkerstroom to hold themselves in  readiness, should I find it necessary to call upon them for active  service.    Sir T. Shepstone also wrote, concerning the reality of the danger,  under date December 25:    The Boers are still flying, and I think by this time there must be a  belt of more than a hundred miles long and thirty broad, in which,  with three insignificant exceptions, there is nothing but absolute  desolation. This will give your Excellency some idea of the mischief  which Cetewayo's conduct has caused.    And again (April 30, 1878):    I find that Secocoeni acts as a kind of lieutenant to Cetewayo. He  received directions from the Zulu King, and these directions are by  Secocoeni issued to the various Basuto tribes in the Transvaal.    Sir T. Shepstone rushed the annexation. He plucked the fruit that  would have fallen. He himself has said that he might have waited  until the Zulus actually made their threatened murderous raid. That  might have been Macchiavelian statecraft, but it would not have been  humanity; and there was nothing in the attitude of the Boer leaders  at the time of the annexation which foreshadowed the fierce and  determined opposition which afterwards developed. The fact seems to  be that the people of the Transvaal were either in favour of the  annexation, or were overpowered and dazed by the hopelessness of the  Republic's outlook; and they passively assented to the action of Sir  Theophilus Shepstone and his twenty-five policemen. The Boers were  quite unable to pay the taxes necessary to self-government and the  prosecution of the Kaffir wars. The Treasury was empty--save for the  much-quoted 12s. 6d. The Government L1 bluebacks were selling at 1s.  Civil servants' salaries were months in arrear. The President  himself--the excitable, unstable, visionary, but truly enlightened  and patriotic Burgers--had not only drawn no salary, but had expended  his private fortune, and incurred a very heavy liability, in the  prosecution of the unsuccessful Secocoeni war. No amount of _ex post  facto_ evidence as to the supposed feelings and opinions of the Boers  can alter a single one of the very serious facts which, taken  together, seemed to Sir Theophilus to justify the annexation. But it  all comes down to this: If the passive acquiescence in the annexation  coincided strangely with the Republic's failure to defeat its enemies  and pay its debts, it is no whit less odd that Lord Carnarvon's  anxiety for the Republic's safety synchronized with his attempt to  confederate South Africa.    The real mistakes of the British Government began _after_ the  annexation. The failure to fulfil promises; the deviation from old  ways of government; the appointment of unsuitable officials, who did  not understand the people or their language; the neglect to convene  the Volksraad or to hold fresh elections, as definitely promised;  the establishment of personal rule by military men, who treated the  Boers with harshness and contempt, and would make no allowance for  their simple, old-fashioned ways, their deep-seated prejudices, and,  if you like, their stupid opposition to modern ideas: these things  and others caused great dissatisfaction, and gave ample material for  the nucleus of irreconcilables to work with.    During the occupation period Mr. Kruger took office under the British  Government, as also did Dr. Jorissen and Chief Justice (then Judge)  Kotze, and indeed all the officials who had protested against the  annexation, except Mr. Piet Joubert, who declined to do so, and who,  if actions be the test and not words, was the only honest protestant.  Mr. Kruger retained his office for some time after he had concerned  himself in the Repeal agitation, but finally resigned his post on  being refused an increased remuneration, for which he had repeatedly  applied. There can be but little doubt that had this inducement been  forthcoming, he would have remained a loyal British subject.    The effect of the annexation was to start the wells of plenty  bubbling--with British gold. The country's debts were paid. Secocoeni  and Cetewayo would be dealt with, and the responsibility for all  things was on other and broader shoulders. With the revival of trade,  and the removal of responsibilities and burdens, came time to think  and to talk. The wave of the magician's wand looked so very simple  that the price began to seem heavy. The eaten bread was forgotten.  The dangers and difficulties that were past were of small account now  that they _were_ past; and so the men who had remained passive, and  recorded formal protests when they should have resisted, and taken  steps to show that they were in earnest, began their Repeal  agitation. All the benefits which the Boers hoped from the annexation  had now been reaped. Their pressing needs were relieved. Their debts  had been paid; their trade and credit restored; their enemies were  being dealt with. Repeal would rob them of none of these; they would,  in fact, eat their cake and still have it. The Zulu question had been  taken up, and could not now be left by the Imperial Government to  settle itself. The debts discharged for them and the outlays incurred  might, it is true, be charged to them. They could not be repaid, of  course, for the same reason that you cannot get blood from stone;  and the amount would, therefore, be a National Debt, which was  exactly what they had been trying for years to incur, and the  condition of their credit had made it impossible to do.    The causes of discontent before given were serious, but the failure  to fulfil promises was not deliberate. Circumstances combined to  prevent Sir Bartle Frere from visiting the Transvaal, as intended and  promised. Native wars (Gaika and Galeka), disagreements between the  Colonial and Imperial authorities, the obstructions and eventual  dismissal of the Molteno-Merriman Ministry--the first under  Responsible Government--Natal and Diamond-fields affairs, and, above  all, the Zulu War, all combined to prevent Sir Bartle Frere from  fulfilling his obligations to settle Transvaal matters.    In the meantime two deputations had been sent to England,  representing the Boers' case against annexation. The active party  among the Boers, _i.e._, the Voortrekker party, the most anti-British  and Republican, though small in itself, had now succeeded in  completely dominating the rest of the Boers, and galvanizing them  into something like national life and cohesion again--a result  achieved partly by earnest persuasion, but largely also by a kind of  terrorism.    Sir Bartle Frere, who managed at last to visit the Transvaal, in  April, 1879, had evidence of this on his journey up, and in a  despatch to Sir M. Hicks Beach from Standerton on the 6th of that  month he wrote:    I was particularly impressed by the replies of a very fine specimen  of a Boer of the old school. He had been six weeks in an English  prison, daily expecting execution as a rebel, and had been wounded by  all the enemies against whom his countrymen had fought--English,  Zulus, Basutos, Griquas, and Bushmen.    'But,' he said, 'that was in the days of my youth and inexperience.  Had I known then what I know now, I would never have fought against  the English, and I will never fight them again. Old as I am, I would  now gladly turn out against the Zulus, and take fifty friends of my  own, who would follow me anywhere; but I dare not leave my home till  assured it will not be destroyed and my property carried off in my  absence, by the men who call me \"rebel\" because I will not join them  against the Government. My wife, brought up like a civilized woman in  the Cape Colony, has had five times in her life to run from the house  and sleep in the veld when attacked by Zulus and Basutos. One of our  twelve sons was assegaied in sight of our house, within the last ten  it was surrounded by Basutos, my wife had to fly in the night by  herself, leading one child and carrying another on her back. She  walked nearly fifty miles through the Lion Veld, seeing three lions  on the way, before she reached a place of safety. It is not likely  that we should forget such things, nor wish them to recur; but how  can I leave her on my farm and go to Zululand, when the malcontent  leaders threaten me that if I go they will burn my house and drive  off all my stock? Assure me that we are not to be deserted by the  English Government, and left to the mercy of these malcontent  adventurers, and I and my people will gladly turn out to assist  Colonel Wood.'    _I find that this idea that the English Government will give up the  Transvaal, as it formerly did the Orange Free State, has been  industriously propagated, and has taken a great hold on the minds of  the well-disposed Boers, and is, I believe, one main cause of  reluctance to support the Government actively_.    _They argue that what has been done before may be done again, and  they have no feeling of assurance that if they stand by the English  Government to-day they will "]]]
