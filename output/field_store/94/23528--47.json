Yet, while other things are content with their own, ye who in your  intellect are God-like seek from the lowest of things adornment for a  nature of supreme excellence, and perceive not how great a wrong ye do  your Maker. His will was that mankind should excel all things on earth.  Ye thrust down your worth beneath the lowest of things. For if that in  which each thing finds its good is plainly more precious than that whose  good it is, by your own estimation ye put yourselves below the vilest of  things, when ye deem these vile things to be your good: nor does this  fall out undeservedly. Indeed, man is so constituted that he then only  excels other things when he knows himself; but he is brought lower than  the beasts if he lose this self-knowledge. For that other creatures  should be ignorant of themselves is natural; in man it shows as a  defect. How extravagant, then, is this error of yours, in thinking that  anything can be embellished by adornments not its own. It cannot be. For  if such accessories add any lustre, it is the accessories that get the  praise, while that which they veil and cover remains in its pristine  ugliness. And again I say, That is no _good_, which injures its  possessor. Is this untrue? No, quite true, thou sayest. And yet riches  have often hurt those that possessed them, since the worst of men, who  are all the more covetous by reason of their wickedness, think none but  themselves worthy to possess all the gold and gems the world contains.  So thou, who now dreadest pike and sword, mightest have trolled a carol  \"in the robber's face,\" hadst thou entered the road of life with empty  pockets. Oh, wondrous blessedness of perishable wealth, whose  acquisition robs thee of security!'        SONG V.    THE FORMER AGE.          Too blest the former age, their life        Who in the fields contented led,      And still, by luxury unspoiled,        On frugal acorns sparely fed.        No skill was theirs the luscious grape        With honey's sweetness to confuse;      Nor China's soft and sheeny silks        T' empurple with brave Tyrian hues.        The grass their wholesome couch, their drink        The stream, their roof the pine's tall shade;      Not theirs to cleave the deep, nor seek        In strange far lands the spoils of trade.        The trump of war was heard not yet,        Nor soiled the fields by bloodshed's stain;      For why should war's fierce madness arm        When strife brought wound, but brought not gain?        Ah! would our hearts might still return        To following in those ancient ways.      Alas! the greed of getting glows        More fierce than Etna's fiery blaze.        Woe, woe for him, whoe'er it was,        Who first gold's hidden store revealed,      And--perilous treasure-trove--dug out        The gems that fain would be concealed!        VI.      'What now shall I say of rank and power, whereby, because ye know not  true power and dignity, ye hope to reach the sky? Yet, when rank and  power have fallen to the worst of men, did ever an Etna, belching forth  flame and fiery deluge, work such mischief? Verily, as I think, thou  dost remember how thine ancestors sought to abolish the consular power,  which had been the foundation of their liberties, on account of the  overweening pride of the consuls, and how for that self-same pride they  had already abolished the kingly title! And if, as happens but rarely,  these prerogatives are conferred on virtuous men, it is only the virtue  of those who exercise them that pleases. So it appears that honour  cometh not to virtue from rank, but to rank from virtue. Look, too, at  the nature of that power which ye find so attractive and glorious! Do ye  never consider, ye creatures of earth, what ye are, and over whom ye  exercise your fancied lordship? Suppose, now, that in the mouse tribe  there should rise up one claiming rights and powers for himself above  the rest, would ye not laugh consumedly? Yet if thou lookest to his body  alone, what creature canst thou find more feeble than man, who  oftentimes is killed by the bite of a fly, or by some insect creeping  into the inner passage of his system! Yet what rights can one exercise  over another, save only as regards the body, and that which is lower  than the body--I mean fortune? What! wilt thou bind with thy mandates  the free spirit? Canst thou force from its due tranquillity the mind  that is firmly composed by reason? A tyrant thought to drive a man of  free birth to reveal his accomplices in a conspiracy, but the prisoner  bit off his tongue and threw it into the furious tyrant's face; thus,  the tortures which the tyrant thought the instrument of his cruelty the  sage made an opportunity for heroism. Moreover, what is there that one  man can do to another which he himself may not have to undergo in his  turn? We are told that Busiris, who used to kill his guests, was himself  slain by his guest, Hercules. Regulus had thrown into bonds many of the  Carthaginians whom he had taken in war; soon after he himself submitted  his hands to the chains of the vanquished. Then, thinkest thou that man  hath any power who cannot prevent another's being able to do to him what  he himself can do to others?    'Besides, if there were any element of natural and proper good in rank  and power, they would never come to the utterly bad, since opposites are  not wont to be associated. Nature brooks not the union of contraries.  So, seeing there is no doubt that wicked wretches are oftentimes set in  high places, it is also clear that things which suffer association with  the worst of men cannot be good in their own nature. Indeed, this  judgment may with some reason be passed concerning all the gifts of  fortune which fall so plentifully to all the most wicked. This ought  also to be considered here, I think: No one doubts a man to be brave in  whom he has observed a brave spirit residing. It is plain that one who  is endowed with speed is swift-footed. So also music makes men musical,  the healing art physicians, rhetoric public speakers. For each of these  has naturally its own proper working; there is no confusion with the  effects of contrary things--nay, even of itself it rejects what is  incompatible. And yet wealth cannot extinguish insatiable greed, nor has  power ever made him master of himself whom vicious lusts kept bound in  indissoluble fetters; dignity conferred on the wicked not only fails to  make them worthy, but contrarily reveals and displays their  unworthiness. Why does it so happen? Because ye take pleasure in calling  by false names things whose nature is quite incongruous thereto--by  names which are easily proved false by the very effects of the things  themselves; even so it is; these riches, that power, this dignity, are  none of them rightly so called. Finally, we may draw the same conclusion  concerning the whole sphere of Fortune, within which there is plainly  nothing to be truly desired, nothing of intrinsic excellence; for she  neither always joins herself to the good, nor does she make good men of  those to whom she is united.'        SONG VI.    NERO'S INFAMY.          We know what mischief dire he wrought--        Rome fired, the Fathers slain--      Whose hand with brother's slaughter wet        A mother's blood did stain.        No pitying tear his cheek bedewed,        As on the corse he gazed;      That mother's beauty, once so fair,        A critic's voice appraised.        Yet far and wide, from East to West,        His sway the nations own;      And scorching South and icy North        Obey his will alone.        Did, then, high power a curb impose        On Nero's phrenzied will?      Ah, woe when to the evil heart        Is joined the sword to kill!        VII.      Then said I: 'Thou knowest thyself that ambition for worldly success  hath but little swayed me. Yet I have desired opportunity for action,  lest virtue, in default of exercise, should languish away.'    Then she: 'This is that \"last infirmity\" which is able to allure minds  which, though of noble quality, have not yet been moulded to any  exquisite refinement by the perfecting of the virtues--I mean, the love  of glory--and fame for high services rendered to the commonweal. And yet  consider with me how poor and unsubstantial a thing this glory is! The  whole of this earth's globe, as thou hast learnt from the demonstration  of astronomy, compared with the expanse of heaven, is found no bigger  than a point; that is to say, if measured by the vastness of heaven's  sphere, it is held to occupy absolutely no space at all. Now, of this so  insignificant portion of the universe, it is about a fourth part, as  Ptolemy's proofs have taught us, which is inhabited by living creatures  known to us. If from this fourth part you take away in thought all that  is usurped by seas and marshes, or lies a vast waste of waterless  desert, barely is an exceeding narrow area left for human habitation.  You, then, who are shut in and prisoned in this merest fraction of a  point's space, do ye take thought for the blazoning of your fame, for  the spreading abroad of your renown? Why, what amplitude or magnificence  has glory when confined to such narrow and petty limits?    'Besides, the straitened bounds of this scant dwelling-place are  inhabited by many nations differing widely in speech, in usages, in mode  of life; to many of these, from the difficulty of travel, from  diversities of speech, from want of commercial intercourse, the fame not  only of individual men, but even of cities, is unable to reach. Why, in  Cicero's days, as he himself somewhere points out, the fame of the Roman  Republic had not yet crossed the Caucasus, and yet by that time her  name had grown formidable to the Parthians and other"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14339"],[0,"Music Talks with Children (#8)"],[1," my heart; nor is it the  pleasure to me which it should be. What am I to do?\"    And the master replied:    \"There is a task, the greatest and severest of all. But a child must  learn it. Thou must know _from the first days_, that all thou doest  and sayest, whither thou goest, what thou seekest; these, all these,  come from within. All that is seen of thee is of thy inner life. All  thy doings, thy goings and comings, thy ways and thy desires, these  are from within. And when all these things _are for thyself_ there is  misery.    \"Now there are many things which may not be had by directly seeking  them; of these the greatest are two. The one is that which already has  given thee sadness in the heart,--the Light of the Face. And the other  is happiness.    \"But there is a way in which these are to be found. Dost thou not know  that often, even with much trouble, thou canst not please thyself? But  always, _with little trouble or none_, thou canst please another.    \"And the way is Service.    \"Thou poor little one! Thou hast come with thy complaint of  unhappiness; and yet thou hast all that is bright and rare;  companions, and music, and a dear home. Dost thou know that there are  in the world uncounted poor ones, children like thyself, who have not  their daily bread? And yet there are many of them who never fail to  say: 'Lead us not into temptation.' And they say this _without having  tasted_ of the daily bread for which they have been taught to pray.    \"And thou? Thou art unhappy. And thy daily bread is set before thee  with music and with sunshine.    \"Yet there are little ones, like thyself, who are hungry in the  darkness.    \"And thou? Thou art unhappy.\"          CHAPTER XII.    THE GREATER MASTERS.        \"In spite of all, I have never interrupted the study of music.\"    --_Palestrina._    An opera writer of Italy, named Giovanni Pacini, once said that to  study the writings of Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven \"lightens the mind  of a student, since the classics are a continuous development of the  most beautiful and simple melodies,\" and we sometimes hear it said  that great men are they who dare to be simple. In our Talks thus far  we have learned one important fact, which is, that music is truth  expressed out of the heart. Of course we know that to be in the heart  it must be felt, and to be expressed we must know a great deal about  writing. Now we are able to imagine quite well what a great master is  in music. As Pacini says, his melodies will be simple and beautiful,  and as we ourselves know, his simple melodies will be an expression of  truth out of the heart.    But to go only as far as this would not be enough. Many can write  simply and well, and truthfully, yet not as a master. There must be  something else. When we have found out what that something else is we  shall understand the masters better and honor them more.    Everywhere in the history of music we read of what men have been  willing to do for the love of their art. It is not that they have been  willing to do when told; but that they have cheerfully done painful,  laborious tasks of their own accord. The name of every master will  recall great labor willingly given for music and equally great  suffering willingly endured, nay, even sought out, that the music  might be purer to them. Poor Palestrina went along many years through  life with the scantiest means. But, as he says, \"in spite of all, I  have never interrupted the study of music.\" Bach was as simple and  loyal a citizen as any land could have, and from the early years when  he was a fatherless boy to the days of his sad affliction, he  sacrificed always. Think of the miles he walked to hear Buxterhude,  the organist; and in the earlier years, when he lived with Johann  Christopher, his brother, how eagerly he sought learning in the art  that so fascinated him. It was a constant willingness to learn  honestly that distinguished him.    Any of us who will labor faithfully with the talents we have can do a  great deal--more than we would believe. Even Bach himself said to a  pupil: \"If thou art _equally_ diligent thou wilt succeed as I  have.\"[40] He recognized that it matters little how much we wish for  things to be as we want them; unless our wish-thoughts are forced into  prompt action we cannot succeed; for while all thoughts seek action,  wish-thoughts demand the most labor.    It would be pleasant to have a Talk about every one of the great  masters to see in what particular way each of them sacrificed for the  art he loved. In all of them the true qualities come out: in one as  earnestness; in another as determination; in another as patriotism;  but all are loyal to the art itself. It must be a very plain lesson to  us to see that when men are willing to give all their thoughts to a  subject they get much from it. And is it not quite as plain to see  that no one can get much if he gives but a few unwilling minutes to  it? I trust none who hear these Talks will ever think that with a  little time given to their music, and that not freely given, they can  ever get either pleasure or comfort from it. They never can. And  rather than do it so they would better leave it undone. If we set out  on the way to go to the masters we shall get there only by  earnestness. Lagging is a disgrace to the one who travels and to the  one to whom we go. It shows his laziness on the one hand, and his  misunderstanding of the master on the other; for if he understood he  would take no listless step.    Now we have said again and again that true music comes from the heart,  and is simple. At the same time we find it difficult to understand the  music of the masters. That is, some of us find it so. It seems  anything but simple to us; and naturally we conclude that there is  something wrong somewhere. We sit at our tasks, poring over the music,  and we grow discouraged because we cannot play it. To think it a very  hard task is natural, and we cannot bear to hear such tones. Well, let  us not get discouraged for that; let us see!    First of all, the playing is more difficult to do than the music is to  understand. Once a great master of the piano played to a lady who had  never heard a great master before, and the playing was like beautiful  lace. When it was over and the master had gone away, some one asked  the lady how he had played, and she said:    \"He played so that the music sounded as I thought it should.\"    And they asked her what she meant.    \"Always I have been taught,\" she said, \"to listen to music and to  think it. I have been taught this more than I have been taught to  play. And the music of the master-composers I always think of as  beautiful and simple but hard to make it sound as it should. Often I  have heard others say that the music of the masters is dull, and not  beautiful, but that is really not what the people feel. It is  difficult for them to play the music rightly. And again they cannot  understand this: that art is often simple in, its truth, while those  who look upon it are not! simple-hearted, as they regard it. This is  hard to understand, but it is the true reason.\"    Now, if we think of what this cultured lady said, we shall think her  wise. Whatever stumbling we may do with our fingers, let us still keep  in our minds the purity of the music itself. This will in a sense  teach us to regard reverentially the men who, from early years, have  added beauties to art for us to enjoy to-day. The wisest of the Greeks  [41] said:    \"The treasures of the wise men of old, which they have left written in  books, I turn over and peruse in company with my friends, and if we  find anything good in them, we remark it, and think it a great gain,  if we thus become more attracted to one another.\"    Once an English lady[42] wrote about a verse-writer: \"No poet ever  clothed so few ideas in so many words.\" Just opposite to this is a  true poet, he who clothes in few words many and noble ideas. A master  tells his message in close-set language.    Now, in the last minutes, let us see what a great master is:        I. He will be one who tells a beautiful message simply.       II. He has been willing to sacrifice and suffer for his art.      III. He has lived his every day in the simple desire to know his own         heart better.       IV. Always he has concentrated his message into as few tones as         possible, and his music, therefore, becomes filled to         overflowing with meaning.    About the meaning of the masters, one of them has written this:  \"Whenever you open the music of Bach, Mozart, or Beethoven, its  meaning comes forth to you in a thousand different ways.\" That is  because thousands of different messages from the heart have been  _concentrated_ in it.          CHAPTER XIII.    THE LESSER MASTERS.        \"And the soul of a child came into him again.\"--_I Kings, XVII: 22._    If, one day, some one should say to you, earnestly: \"Well day are to  you!\" you would scarcely know what to make of it. You would at once  understand that the person had knowledge of words but could not put  them together rightly. And if the person continued to talk to you in  this manner you might feel inclined to lose your patience and not  listen. But if you would stop and consider things and examine yourself  you would learn something well worth thinking about.    You would discover that your own ability to put words in the right  order has come from being obedient. First of all, you have been  willing to imitate what others said until you have thereby learned to  speak quite well. Besides that, you have been corrected many times by  those about you at home, and in school, until language is at length a  careful habit in you. Every one knows at once what you mean. You see,  therefore, that you may combine words in such a manner that you will  be easily comprehended by others; or, as in the case of the imaginary  person we began with, they may be combined in a perfectly "]]]
