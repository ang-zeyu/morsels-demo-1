Together with the county of  Provence, Louis XI. had bought from King Rene all the claims of the  house of Anjou. Among these was included a claim to the kingdom of  Naples. Louis's son, _Charles VIII._, a vain and shallow lad, was  tempted by the possession of large treasures and a fine army to listen  to the persuasions of an Italian intriguer, Ludovico Sforza, Duke of  Milan, and put forward these pretensions, thus beginning a war which  lasted nearly as long as the Hundred Years' War with England. But it was  a war of aggression instead of a war of self-defence. Charles crossed  the Alps in 1493, marched the whole length of Italy without opposition,  and was crowned at Naples; while its royal family, an illegitimate  offshoot from the Kings of Aragon, fled into Sicily, and called on  Spain for help. But the insolent exactions of the French soldiery caused  the people to rise against them; and when Charles returned, he was beset  at Fornovo by a great league of Italians, over whom he gained a complete  victory. Small and puny though he was, he fought like a lion, and seemed  quite inspired by the ardour of combat. The \"French fury,\" _la furia  Francese_, became a proverb among the Italians. Charles neglected,  however, to send any supplies or reinforcements to the garrisons he had  left behind him in Naples, and they all perished under want, sickness,  and the sword of the Spaniards. He was meditating another expedition,  when he struck his head against the top of a doorway, and died in 1498.      2. Campaign of Louis XII.--His cousin, _Louis XII._, married his  widow, and thus prevented Brittany from again parting from the crown.  Louis not only succeeded to the Angevin right to Naples, but through his  grandmother he viewed himself as heir of Milan. She was Valentina  Visconti, wife to that Duke of Orleans who had been murdered by John the  Fearless. Louis himself never advanced further than to Milan, whose  surrender made him master of Lombardy, which he held for the greater  part of his reign. But after a while the Spanish king, Ferdinand, agreed  with him to throw over the cause of the unfortunate royal family of  Naples, and divide that kingdom between them. Louis XII. sent a  brilliant army to take possession of his share, but the bounds of each  portion had not been defined, and the French and Spanish troops began a  war even while their kings were still treating with one another. The  individual French knights did brilliant exploits, for indeed it was the  time of the chief blossom of fanciful chivalry, a knight of Dauphine,  named Bayard, called the Fearless and Stainless Knight, and honoured by  friend and foe; but the Spaniards were under Gonzalo de Cordova, called  the Great Captain, and after the battles of Cerignola and the Garigliano  drove the French out of the kingdom of Naples, though the war continued  in Lombardy.      3. The Holy League.--It was an age of leagues. The Italians, hating  French and Spaniards both alike, were continually forming combinations  among themselves and with foreign powers against whichever happened to  be the strongest. The chief of these was called the Holy League, because  it was formed by Pope Julius II., who drew into it Maximilian, then head  of the German Empire, Ferdinand of Spain, and Henry VIII. of England.  The French troops were attacked in Milan; and though they gained the  battle of Ravenna in 1512, it was with the loss of their general, Gaston  de Foix, Duke of Nemours, whose death served as an excuse to Ferdinand  of Spain for setting up a claim to the kingdom of Navarre. He cunningly  persuaded Henry VIII. to aid him in the attack, by holding out the vain  idea of going on to regain Gascony; and while one troop of English were  attacking Pampeluna, Henry himself landed at Calais and took Tournay and  Terouenne. The French forces were at the same time being chased out of  Italy. However, when Pampeluna had been taken, and the French finally  driven out of Lombardy, the Pope and king, who had gained their ends,  left Henry to fight his own battles. He thus was induced to make peace,  giving his young sister Mary as second wife to Louis; but that king  over-exerted himself at the banquets, and died six weeks after the  marriage, in 1515. During this reign the waste of blood and treasure on  wars of mere ambition was frightful, and the country had been heavily  taxed; but a brilliant soldiery had been trained up, and national vanity  had much increased. The king, though without deserving much love, was so  kindly in manner that he was a favourite, and was called the Father of  the People. His first wife, Anne of Brittany, was an excellent and  high-spirited woman, who kept the court of France in a better state than  ever before or since.      4. Campaigns of Francis I.--Louis left only two daughters, the elder  of whom, Claude, carried Brittany to his male heir, Francis, Count of  Angouleine. Anne of Brittany had been much averse to the match; but  Louis said he kept his mice for his own cats, and gave his daughter and  her duchy to Francis as soon as Anne was dead. _Francis I._ was one of  the vainest, falsest, and most dashing of Frenchmen. In fact, he was an  exaggeration in every way of the national character, and thus became a  national hero, much overpraised. He at once resolved to recover  Lombardy; and after crossing the Alps encountered an army of Swiss  troops, who had been hired to defend the Milanese duchy, on the field of  Marignano. Francis had to fight a desperate battle with them; after  which he caused Bayard to dub him knight, though French kings were said  to be born knights. In gaining the victory over these mercenaries, who  had been hitherto deemed invincible, he opened for himself a way into  Italy, and had all Lombardy at his feet. The Pope, Leo X., met him at  Bologna, and a concordat took place, by which the French Church became  more entirely subject to the Pope, while in return all patronage was  given up to the crown. The effects were soon seen in the increased  corruption of the clergy and people. Francis brought home from this  expedition much taste for Italian art and literature, and all matters of  elegance and ornament made great progress from this time. The great  Italian masters worked for him; Raphael painted some of his most  beautiful pictures for him, and Leonardo da Vinci came to his court, and  there died in his arms. His palaces, especially that of Blois, were  exceedingly beautiful, in the new classic style, called the Renaissance.  Great richness and splendour reigned at court, and set off his  pretensions to romance and chivalry. Learning and scholarship,  especially classical, increased much; and the king's sister, Margaret,  Queen of Navarre, was an excellent and highly cultivated woman, but even  her writings prove that the whole tone of feeling was terribly coarse,  when not vicious.      5. Charles V.--The conquest of Lombardy made France the greatest power  in Christendom; but its king was soon to find a mighty and active rival.  The old hatred between France and Burgundy again awoke. Mary of  Burgundy, the daughter of Charles the Bold, had married Maximilian,  Archduke of Austria and King of the Romans, though never actually  crowned Emperor. Their son, Philip, married Juana, the daughter of  Ferdinand, and heiress of Spain, who lost her senses from grief on  Philip's untimely death; and thus the direct heir to Spain, Austria, and  the Netherlands, was Charles, her eldest son. On the death of Maximilian  in 1518, Francis proposed himself to the electors as Emperor, but  failed, in spite of bribery. Charles was chosen, and from that time  Francis pursued him with unceasing hatred. The claims to Milan and  Naples were renewed. Francis sent troops to occupy Milan, and was  following them himself; but the most powerful of all his nobles, the  Duke of Bourbon, Constable of France, had been alienated by an injustice  perpetrated on him in favour of the king's mother, and deserted to the  Spaniards, offering to assist them and the English in dividing France,  while he reserved for himself Provence. His desertion hindered Francis  from sending support to the troops in Milan, who were forced to retreat.  Bayard was shot in the spine while defending the rear-guard, and was  left to die under a tree. The utmost honour was shown him by the  Spaniards; but when Bourbon came near him, he bade him take pity, not on  one who was dying as a true soldier, but on himself as a traitor to king  and country. When the French, in 1525, invaded Lombardy, Francis  suffered a terrible defeat at Pavia, and was carried a prisoner to  Madrid, where he remained for a year, and was only set free on making a  treaty by which he was to give up all claims in Italy both to Naples and  Milan, also the county of Burgundy and the suzerainty of those Flemish  counties which had been fiefs of the French crown, as well as to  surrender his two sons as hostages for the performance of the  conditions.      6. Wars of Francis and Charles.--All the rest of the king's life was  an attempt to elude or break these conditions, against which he had  protested in his prison, but when there was no Spaniard present to hear  him do so. The county of Burgundy refused to be transferred; and the  Pope, Clement VII., hating the Spanish power in Italy, contrived a fresh  league against Charles, in which Francis joined, but was justly rewarded  by the miserable loss of another army. His mother and Charles's aunt met  at Cambrai, and concluded, in 1529, what was called the Ladies' Peace,  which bore as hardly on France as the peace of Madrid, excepting that  Charles gave up his claim to Burgundy. Still Francis's plans were not at  an end. He married his second son, Henry, to Catherine, the only  legitimate child of the great Florentine house of Medici, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/173"],[0,"The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu (#8)"],[1,"from  one to the other of us with his twinkling eyes.  \"Too late!  Shuttee  shop!\"    \"Don't you come none of it wi' me!\" roared Smith, in a voice of amazing  gruffness, and shook an artificially dirtied fist under the Chinaman's  nose.  \"Get inside and gimme an' my mate a couple o' pipes.  Smokee  pipe, you yellow scum--savvy?\"    My friend bent forward and glared into the other's eyes with a  vindictiveness that amazed me, unfamiliar as I was with this form of  gentle persuasion.    \"Kop 'old o' that,\" he said, and thrust a coin into the Chinaman's  yellow paw.  \"Keep me waitin' an' I'll pull the dam' shop down,  Charlie.  You can lay to it.\"    \"No hab got pipee--\" began the other.    Smith raised his fist, and Yan capitulated.    \"Allee lightee,\" he said.  \"Full up--no loom.  You come see.\"    He dived behind the dirty curtain, Smith and I following, and ran up a  dark stair.  The next moment I found myself in an atmosphere which was  literally poisonous.  It was all but unbreathable, being loaded with  opium fumes.  Never before had I experienced anything like it.  Every  breath was an effort.  A tin oil-lamp on a box in the middle of the  floor dimly illuminated the horrible place, about the walls of which  ten or twelve bunks were ranged and all of them occupied.  Most of the  occupants were lying motionless, but one or two were squatting in their  bunks noisily sucking at the little metal pipes.  These had not yet  attained to the opium-smoker's Nirvana.    \"No loom--samee tella you,\" said Shen-Yan, complacently testing Smith's  shilling with his yellow, decayed teeth.    Smith walked to a corner and dropped cross-legged, on the floor,  pulling me down with him.    \"Two pipe quick,\" he said.  \"Plenty room.  Two piecee pipe--or plenty  heap trouble.\"    A dreary voice from one of the bunks came:    \"Give 'im a pipe, Charlie, curse yer!  an' stop 'is palaver.\"    Yan performed a curious little shrug, rather of the back than of the  shoulders, and shuffled to the box which bore the smoky lamp.  Holding  a needle in the flame, he dipped it, when red-hot, into an old cocoa  tin, and withdrew it with a bead of opium adhering to the end.  Slowly  roasting this over the lamp, he dropped it into the bowl of the metal  pipe which he held ready, where it burned with a spirituous blue flame.    \"Pass it over,\" said Smith huskily, and rose on his knees with the  assumed eagerness of a slave to the drug.    Yan handed him the pipe, which he promptly put to his lips, and  prepared another for me.    \"Whatever you do, don't inhale any,\" came Smith's whispered injunction.    It was with a sense of nausea greater even than that occasioned by the  disgusting atmosphere of the den that I took the pipe and pretended to  smoke.  Taking my cue from my friend, I allowed my head gradually to  sink lower and lower, until, within a few minutes, I sprawled sideways  on the floor, Smith lying close beside me.    \"The ship's sinkin',\" droned a voice from one of the bunks.  \"Look at  the rats.\"    Yan had noiselessly withdrawn, and I experienced a curious sense of  isolation from my fellows--from the whole of the Western world.  My  throat was parched with the fumes, my head ached.  The vicious  atmosphere seemed contaminating.  I was as one dropped--    Somewhere East of Suez, where the best is like the worst, And there  ain't no Ten Commandments and a man can raise a thirst.    Smith began to whisper softly.    \"We have carried it through successfully so far,\" he said.  \"I don't  know if you have observed it, but there is a stair just behind you,  half concealed by a ragged curtain.  We are near that, and well in the  dark.  I have seen nothing suspicious so far--or nothing much.  But if  there was anything going forward it would no doubt be delayed until we  new arrivals were well doped.  S-SH!\"    He pressed my arm to emphasize the warning.  Through my half-closed  eyes I perceived a shadowy form near the curtain to which he had  referred.  I lay like a log, but my muscles were tensed nervously.    The shadow materialized as the figure moved forward into the room with  a curiously lithe movement.    The smoky lamp in the middle of the place afforded scant illumination,  serving only to indicate sprawling shapes--here an extended hand, brown  or yellow, there a sketchy, corpse-like face; whilst from all about  rose obscene sighings and murmurings in far-away voices--an uncanny,  animal chorus.  It was like a glimpse of the Inferno seen by some  Chinese Dante.  But so close to us stood the newcomer that I was able  to make out a ghastly parchment face, with small, oblique eyes, and a  misshapen head crowned with a coiled pigtail, surmounting a slight,  hunched body.  There was something unnatural, inhuman, about that  masklike face, and something repulsive in the bent shape and the long,  yellow hands clasped one upon the other.    Fu-Manchu, from Smith's account, in no way resembled this crouching  apparition with the death's-head countenance and lithe movements; but  an instinct of some kind told me that we were on the right scent--that  this was one of the doctor's servants.  How I came to that conclusion,  I cannot explain; but with no doubt in my mind that this was a member  of the formidable murder group, I saw the yellow man creep nearer,  nearer, silently, bent and peering.    He was watching us.    Of another circumstance I became aware, and a disquieting circumstance.  There were fewer murmurings and sighings from the surrounding bunks.  The presence of the crouching figure had created a sudden semi-silence  in the den, which could only mean that some of the supposed  opium-smokers had merely feigned coma and the approach of coma.    Nayland Smith lay like a dead man, and trusting to the darkness, I,  too, lay prone and still, but watched the evil face bending lower and  lower, until it came within a few inches of my own.  I completely  closed my eyes.    Delicate fingers touched my right eyelid.  Divining what was coming, I  rolled my eyes up, as the lid was adroitly lifted and lowered again.  The man moved away.    I had saved the situation!  And noting anew the hush about me--a hush  in which I fancied many pairs of ears listened--I was glad.  For just a  moment I realized fully how, with the place watched back and front, we  yet were cut off, were in the hands of Far Easterns, to some extent in  the power of members of that most inscrutably mysterious race, the  Chinese.    \"Good,\" whispered Smith at my side.  \"I don't think I could have done  it.  He took me on trust after that.  My God!  what an awful face.  Petrie, it's the hunchback of Cadby's notes.  Ah, I thought so.  Do you  see that?\"    I turned my eyes round as far as was possible.  A man had scrambled  down from one of the bunks and was following the bent figure across the  room.    They passed around us quietly, the little yellow man leading, with his  curious, lithe gait, and the other, an impassive Chinaman, following.  The curtain was raised, and I heard footsteps receding on the stairs.    \"Don't stir,\" whispered Smith.    An intense excitement was clearly upon him, and he communicated it to  me.  Who was the occupant of the room above?    Footsteps on the stair, and the Chinaman reappeared, recrossed the  floor, and went out.  The little, bent man went over to another bunk,  this time leading up the stair one who looked like a lascar.    \"Did you see his right hand?\" whispered Smith.  \"A dacoit!  They come  here to report and to take orders.  Petrie, Dr. Fu-Manchu is up there.\"    \"What shall we do?\"--softly.    \"Wait.  Then we must try to rush the stairs.  It would be futile to  bring in the police first.  He is sure to have some other exit.  I will  give the word while the little yellow devil is down here.  You are  nearer and will have to go first, but if the hunchback follows, I can  then deal with him.\"    Our whispered colloquy was interrupted by the return of the dacoit, who  recrossed the room as the Chinaman had done, and immediately took his  departure.  A third man, whom Smith identified as a Malay, ascended the  mysterious stairs, descended, and went out; and a fourth, whose  nationality it was impossible to determine, followed.  Then, as the  softly moving usher crossed to a bunk on the right of the outer door--    \"Up you go, Petrie,\" cried Smith, for further delay was dangerous and  further dissimulation useless.    I leaped to my feet.  Snatching my revolver from the pocket of the  rough jacket I wore, I bounded to the stair and went blundering up in  complete darkness.  A chorus of brutish cries clamored from behind,  with a muffled scream rising above them all.  But Nayland Smith was  close behind as I raced along a covered gangway, in a purer air, and at  my heels when I crashed open a door at the end and almost fell into the  room beyond.    What I saw were merely a dirty table, with some odds and ends upon it  of which I was too excited to take note, an oil-lamp swung by a brass  chain above, and a man sitting behind the table.  But from the moment  that my gaze rested upon the one who sat there, I think if the place  had been an Aladdin's palace I should have had no eyes for any of its  wonders.    He wore a plain yellow robe, of a hue almost identical with that of his  smooth, hairless countenance.  His hands were large, long and bony, and  he held them knuckles upward, and rested his pointed chin upon their  thinness.  He had a great, high brow, crowned with sparse,  neutral-colored hair.    Of his face, as it looked out at me over the dirty table, I despair of  writing convincingly.  It was that of an archangel of evil, and it was  wholly dominated by the most uncanny eyes that ever reflected a human  soul, for they were narrow and long, very slightly oblique, and of a  brilliant green.  But their unique horror lay in a certain filminess  (it made me think of the membrana nictitans in a bird) which, obscuring  them as I"]]]
