This is the house that God hateth.  There be many things that know its secret; sore  And evil things; murders and strangling death.  'Tis here they slaughter men...A splashing floor.    SECOND ELDER.    Keen-sensed the strange maid seemeth, like a hound  For blood.--And what she seeks can sure be found!    CASSANDRA.    The witnesses ... I follow where they lead.  The crying ... of little children ... near the gate:  Crying for wounds that bleed:  And the smell of the baked meats their father ate.    SECOND ELDER (_recognizing her vision, and repelled_).    Word of thy mystic power had reached our ear  Long since. Howbeit we need no prophets here.    CASSANDRA.    Ah, ah! What would they? A new dreadful thing.  A great great sin plots in the house this day;  Too strong for the faithful, beyond medicining ...  And help stands far away.    LEADER.    This warning I can read not, though I knew  That other tale. It rings the city through.    CASSANDRA.    O Woman, thou! The lord who lay with thee!    Wilt lave with water, and then ... How speak the end?  It comes so quick. A hand ... another hand ...    That reach, reach gropingly....    LEADER.    I see not yet. These riddles, pierced with blind  Gleams of foreboding, but bemuse my mind.    CASSANDRA.    Ah, ah! What is it? There; it is coming clear.    A net ... some net of Hell.  Nay, she that lies with him ... is she the snare?    And half of his blood upon it. It holds well....  O Crowd of ravening Voices, be glad, yea, shout  And cry for the stoning, cry for the casting out!    SECOND ELDER.    What Fury Voices call'st thou to be hot  Against this castle? Such words like me not.      And deep within my breast I felt that sick      And saffron drop, which creepeth to the heart      To die as the last rays of life depart.        Misfortune comes so quick.    CASSANDRA.    Ah, look! Look! Keep his mate from the Wild Bull!    A tangle of raiment, see;  A black horn, and a blow, and he falleth, full    In the marble amid the water. I counsel ye.    I speak plain ... Blood in the bath and treachery!    LEADER.    No great interpreter of oracles  Am I; but this, I think, some mischief spells.      What spring of good hath seercraft ever made      Up from the dark to flow?    'Tis but a weaving of words, a craft of woe,      To make mankind afraid.    CASSANDRA.    Poor woman! Poor dead woman! ... Yea, it is I,    Poured out like water among them. Weep for me....    Ah! What is this place? Why must I come with thee....      To die, only to die?    LEADER.    Thou art borne on the breath of God, thou spirit wild,    For thine own weird to wail,  Like to that winged voice, that heart so sore  Which, crying alway, hungereth to cry more,  \"Itylus, Itylus,\" till it sing her child    Back to the nightingale.    CASSANDRA.    Oh, happy Singing Bird, so sweet, so clear!    Soft wings for her God made,  And an easy passing, without pain or tear ...  For me 'twill be torn flesh and rending blade.    SECOND ELDER.    Whence is it sprung, whence wafted on God's breath,    This anguish reasonless?  This throbbing of terror shaped to melody,  Moaning of evil blent with music high?  Who hath marked out for thee that mystic path    Through thy woe's wilderness?    CASSANDRA.    Alas for the kiss, the kiss of Paris, his people's bane!  Alas for Scamander Water, the water my fathers drank!  Long, long ago, I played about thy bank,    And was cherished and grew strong;  Now by a River of Wailing, by shores of Pain,    Soon shall I make my song.    LEADER.      How sayst thou? All too clear,  This ill word thou hast laid upon thy mouth!      A babe could read thee plain.  It stabs within me like a serpent's tooth,  The bitter thrilling music of her pain:      I marvel as I hear.    CASSANDRA.    Alas for the toil, the toil of a City, worn unto death!  Alas for my father's worship before the citadel,  The flocks that bled and the tumult of their breath!    But no help from them came  To save Troy Towers from falling as they fell!...  And I on the earth shall writhe, my heart aflame.    SECOND ELDER.    Dark upon dark, new ominous words of ill!    Sure there hath swept on thee some Evil Thing,      Crushing, which makes thee bleed    And in the torment of thy vision sing  These plaining death-fraught oracles ... Yet still, still,      Their end I cannot read!    CASSANDRA.    [_By an effort she regains mastery of herself, and speaks directly to  the Leader_.    'Fore God, mine oracle shall no more hide  With veils his visage, like a new-wed bride!  A shining wind out of this dark shall blow,  Piercing the dawn, growing as great waves grow,  To burst in the heart of sunrise ... stronger far  Than this poor pain of mine. I will not mar  With mists my wisdom.                        Be near me as I go,  Tracking the evil things of long ago,  And bear me witness. For this roof, there clings  Music about it, like a choir which sings  One-voiced, but not well-sounding, for not good  The words are.  Drunken, drunken, and with blood,  To make them dare the more, a revelling rout  Is in the rooms, which no man shall cast out,  Of sister Furies. And they weave to song,  Haunting the House, its first blind deed of wrong,  Spurning in turn that King's bed desecrate,  Defiled, which paid a brother's sin with hate....    Hath it missed or struck, mine arrow? Am I a poor  Dreamer, that begs and babbles at the door?  Give first thine oath in witness, that I know  Of this great dome the sins wrought long ago.    ELDER.    And how should oath of mine, though bravely sworn,  Appease thee? Yet I marvel that one born  Far over seas, of alien speech, should fall  So apt, as though she had lived here and seen all.    CASSANDRA.    The Seer Apollo made me too to see.    ELDER (_in a low voice_).    Was the God's heart pierced with desire for thee?    CASSANDRA.    Time was, I held it shame hereof to speak.    ELDER.    Ah, shame is for the mighty, not the weak.    CASSANDRA.    We wrestled, and his breath to me was sweet.    ELDER.    Ye came to the getting of children, as is meet?    CASSANDRA.    I swore to Loxias, and I swore a lie.    ELDER.    Already thine the gift of prophecy?    CASSANDRA.    Already I showed my people all their path.    ELDER.    And Loxias did not smite thee in his wrath?    CASSANDRA.    After that sin ... no man believed me more.    ELDER.    Nay, then, to us thy wisdom seemeth sure.    CASSANDRA.    Oh, oh! Agony, agony!  Again the awful pains of prophecy  Are on me, maddening as they fall....  Ye see them there ... beating against the wall?  So young ... like shapes that gather in a dream ...  Slain by a hand they loved. Children they seem,  Murdered ... and in their hands they bear baked meat:  I think it is themselves. Yea, flesh; I see it;  And inward parts.... Oh, what a horrible load  To carry! And their father drank their blood.    From these, I warn ye, vengeance broodeth still,  A lion's rage, which goes not forth to kill  But lurketh in his lair, watching the high  Hall of my war-gone master ... Master? Aye;  Mine, mine! The yoke is nailed about my neck....  Oh, lord of ships and trampler on the wreck  Of Ilion, knows he not this she-wolf's tongue,  Which licks and fawns, and laughs with ear up-sprung,  To bite in the end like secret death?--And can  The woman?  Slay a strong and armed man? ...    What fanged reptile like to her doth creep?  Some serpent amphisbene, some Skylla, deep  Housed in the rock, where sailors shriek and die,  Mother of Hell blood-raging, which doth cry  On her own flesh war, war without alloy ...  God! And she shouted in his face her joy,  Like men in battle when the foe doth break.  And feigns thanksgiving for his safety's sake!    What if no man believe me? 'Tis all one.  The thing which must be shall be; aye, and soon  Thou too shalt sorrow for these things, and here  Standing confess me all too true a seer.    LEADER.    The Thyestean feast of children slain  I understood, and tremble. Aye, my brain  Reels at these visions, beyond guesswork true.  But after, though I heard, I had lost the clue.    CASSANDRA.    Man, thou shalt look on Agamemnon dead.    LEADER.    Peace, Mouth of Evil! Be those words unsaid!    CASSANDRA.    No god of peace hath watch upon that hour.    LEADER.    If it must come. Forefend it, Heavenly Power!    CASSANDRA.    They do not think of prayer; they think of death.    LEADER.    They? Say, what man this foul deed compasseth?    CASSANDRA.    Alas, thou art indeed fallen far astray!    LEADER.    How could such deed be done? I see no way.    CASSANDRA.    Yet know I not the Greek tongue all too well?    LEADER.    Greek are the Delphic dooms, but hard to spell.    CASSANDRA.    Ah! Ah! There!  What a strange fire! It moves ... It comes at me.  O Wolf Apollo, mercy! O agony! ...  Why lies she with a wolf, this lioness lone,  Two-handed, when the royal lion is gone?  God, she will kill me! Like to them that brew  Poison, I see her mingle for me too  A separate vial in her wrath, and swear,  Whetting her blade for him, that I must share  His death ... because, because he hath dragged me here!    Oh, why these mockers at my throat? This gear  Of wreathed bands, this staff of prophecy?  I mean to kill you first, before I die.  Begone!      [_She tears off her prophetic habiliments; and presently throws them on  the ground, and stamps on them._      Down to perdition! ... Lie ye so?  So I requite you! Now make rich in woe  Some other Bird of Evil, me no more!            [_Coming to herself._  Ah, see! It is Apollo's self, hath tore  His crown from me! Who watched me long ago  In this same prophet's robe, by friend, by foe,  All with one voice, all blinded, mocked to scorn:  \"A thing of dreams,\" \"a beggar-maid outworn,\"  Poor, starving and reviled, I endured all;  And now the Seer, who called me till my call  Was perfect,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14426"],[0,"London to Ladysmith via Pretoria (#8)"],[1,"should be no more  uncertainty and alarm among loyal subjects of the Queen. 'We have always  known,' said the farmer, 'that it must end in war, and I cannot say I am  sorry it has come at last. But it falls heavily on us. I am the only man  for twenty miles who has not left his farm. Of course we are defenceless  here. Any day the Dutchmen may come. They wouldn't kill us, but they  would burn or plunder everything, and it's all I've got in the world.  Fifteen years have I worked at this place, and I said to myself we may  as well stay and face it out, whatever happens.' Indeed, it was an  anxious time for such a man. He had bought the ground, built the house,  reclaimed waste tracts, enriched the land with corn and cattle, sunk all  his capital in the enterprise, and backed it with the best energies of  his life. Now everything might be wrecked in an hour by a wandering Boer  patrol. And this was happening to a loyal and law-abiding British  subject more than a hundred miles within the frontiers of her Majesty's  dominions! Now I felt the bitter need for soldiers--thousands of  soldiers--so that such a man as this might be assured. With what pride  and joy could one have said: 'Work on, the fruits of your industry are  safe. Under the strong arm of the Imperial Government your home shall be  secure, and if perchance you suffer in the disputes of the Empire the  public wealth shall restore your private losses.' But when I recalled  the scanty force which alone kept the field, and stood between the enemy  and the rest of Natal, I knew the first would be an empty boast, and,  remembering what had happened on other occasions, I thought the second  might prove a barren promise.    We started on our long ride home, for the afternoon was wearing away and  picket lines are dangerous at dusk. The military situation is without  doubt at this moment most grave and critical. We have been at war three  weeks. The army that was to have defended Natal, and was indeed expected  to repulse the invaders with terrible loss, is blockaded and bombarded  in its fortified camp. At nearly every point along the circle of the  frontiers the Boers have advanced and the British retreated. Wherever we  have stood we have been surrounded. The losses in the fighting have not  been unequal--nor, considering the numbers engaged and the weapons  employed, have they been very severe. But the Boers hold more than 1,200  unwounded British prisoners, a number that bears a disgraceful  proportion to the casualty lists, and a very unsatisfactory relation to  the number of Dutchmen that we have taken. All this is mainly the result  of being unready. That we are unready is largely due to those in England  who have endeavoured by every means in their power to hamper and  obstruct the Government, who have scoffed at the possibility of the  Boers becoming the aggressors, and who have represented every precaution  for the defence of the colonies as a deliberate provocation to the  Transvaal State. It is also due to an extraordinary under-estimation of  the strength of the Boers. These military republics have been for ten  years cherishing vast ambitions, and for five years, enriched by the  gold mines, they have been arming and preparing for the struggle. They  have neglected nothing, and it is a very remarkable fact that these  ignorant peasant communities have had the wisdom and the enterprise to  possess themselves of good advisers, and to utilise the best expert  opinion in all matters of armament and war.    Their artillery is inferior in numbers, but in nothing else, to ours.  Yesterday I visited Colenso in the armoured train. In one of the  deserted British-built redoubts I found two boxes of shrapnel shells and  charges. The Boers had not troubled to touch them. Their guns were of a  later pattern, and fired powder and shell made up together like a great  rifle cartridge. The combination, made for the first time in the history  of war, of heavy artillery and swarms of mounted infantry is formidable  and effective. The enduring courage and confident spirit of the enemy  must also excite surprise. In short, we have grossly underrated their  fighting powers. Most people in England--I, among them--thought that  the Boer ultimatum was an act of despair, that the Dutch would make one  fight for their honour, and, once defeated, would accept the inevitable.  All I have heard and whatever I have seen out here contradict these  false ideas. Anger, hatred, and the consciousness of military power  impelled, the Boers to war. They would rather have fought at their own  time--a year or two later--when their preparations were still further  advanced, and when the British were, perhaps, involved in other  quarters. But, after all, the moment was ripe. Nearly everything was  ready, and the whole people sprang to arms with alacrity, firmly  believing that they would drive the British into the sea. To that  opinion they still adhere. I do not myself share it; but it cannot be  denied that it seems less absurd to-day than it did before a shot had  been fired.    To return to Estcourt. Here we are passing through a most dangerous  period. The garrison is utterly insufficient to resist the Boers; the  position wholly indefensible. Indeed, we exist here on sufferance. If  the enemy attack, the troops must fall back on Pietermaritzburg, if for  no other reason because they are the only force available for the  defence of the strong lines now being formed around the chief town.  There are so few cavalry outside Ladysmith that the Boers could raid in  all directions. All this will have been changed long before this letter  reaches you, or I should not send it, but as I write the situation is  saved only by what seems to me the over-confidence of the enemy. They  are concentrating all their efforts on Ladysmith, and evidently hope to  compel its surrender. It may, however, be said with absolute certainty  that the place can hold out for a month at the least. How, then, could  the Boers obtain the necessary time to reduce it? The reinforcements are  on the seas. The railway works regularly with the coast. Even now  sidings are being constructed and troop trains prepared. It is with all  this that they should interfere, and they are perfectly competent to do  so. They could compel us to retreat on Pietermaritzburg, they could  tear up the railway, they could blow up the bridges; and by all these  means they could delay the arrival of a relieving army, and so have a  longer time to worry Ladysmith, and a better chance of making it a  second Saratoga. Since Saturday last that has been our fear. Nearly a  week has passed and nothing has happened. The chance of the Boers is  fleeting; the transports approach the land; scarcely forty-eight hours  remain. Yet, as I write, they have done nothing. Why? To some extent I  think they have been influenced by the fear of the Tugela River rising  behind their raiding parties, and cutting their line of retreat; to some  extent by the serene and confident way in which General Wolfe Murray,  placed in a most trying position, has handled his force and maintained  by frequent reconnaissance and a determined attitude the appearance of  actual strength; but when all has been said on these grounds, the fact  will remain that the enemy have not destroyed the railway because they  do not fear the reinforcements that are coming, because they do not  believe that many will come, and because they are sure that, however  many may come, they will defeat them. To this end they preserve the  line, and watch the bridges as carefully as we do. It is by the railway  that they are to be supplied in their march through Natal to the sea.  After what they have accomplished it would be foolish to laugh at any of  their ambitions, however wicked and extravagant these may be; but it  appears to most military critics at this moment that they have committed  a serious strategic error, and have thrown away the chance they had  almost won. How much that error will cost them will depend on the  operations of the relieving force, which I shall hope to chronicle as  fully as possible in future letters.          CHAPTER VII    THE FATE OF THE ARMOURED TRAIN      Pretoria: November 20, 1899.    Now I perceive that I was foolish to choose in advance a definite title  for these letters and to think that it could continue to be appropriate  for any length of time. In the strong stream of war the swimmer is  swirled helplessly about hither and thither by the waves, and he can by  no means tell where he will come to land, or, indeed, that he may not be  overwhelmed in the flood. A week ago I described to you a reconnoitring  expedition in the Estcourt armoured train, and I pointed out the many  defects in the construction and the great dangers in the employment of  that forlorn military machine. So patent were these to all who concerned  themselves in the matter that the train was nicknamed in the camp  'Wilson's death trap.'    On Tuesday, the 14th, the mounted infantry patrols reported that the  Boers in small parties were approaching Estcourt from the directions of  Weenen and Colenso, and Colonel Long made a reconnaissance in force to  ascertain what strength lay behind the advanced scouts. The  reconnaissance, which was marked only by an exchange of shots between  the patrols, revealed little, but it was generally believed that a  considerable portion of the army investing Ladysmith was moving, or was  about to move, southwards to attack Estcourt, and endeavour to strike  Pietermaritzburg. The movement that we had awaited for ten days  impended. Accordingly certain military preparations, which I need not  now specify, were made to guard against all contingencies, and at  daylight on Wednesday morning another spray of patrols was flung out  towards the north and north-west, and the Estcourt armoured train was  ordered to reconnoitre towards Chieveley. The train was"]]]
