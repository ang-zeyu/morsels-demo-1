EGG BALLS FOR SOUP.    Take the yolks of six hard-boiled eggs and half a tablespoonful of  wheat flour, rub them smooth with the yolks of two raw eggs and a  teaspoonful of salt; mix all well together; make it in balls, and drop  them into the boiling soup a few minutes before taking it up.    Used in green turtle soup.      EGG DUMPLINGS FOR SOUP.    To half a pint of milk put two well-beaten eggs, and as much wheat  flour as will make a smooth, rather _thick_ batter free from lumps;  drop this batter, a tablespoonful at a time, into boiling soup.    _Another Mode._--One cupful of sour cream and one cupful of sour milk,  three eggs, well beaten, whites and yolks separately; one teaspoonful  of salt, one level teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in a spoonful of  water, and enough flour added to make a _very stiff_ batter. To be  dropped by spoonfuls into the broth and boiled twenty minutes, or  until no raw dough shows on the outside.      SUET DUMPLINGS FOR SOUP.    Three cups of sifted flour in which three teaspoonfuls of baking  powder have been sifted; one cup of finely chopped suet, well rubbed  into the flour, with a teaspoonful of salt. Wet all with sweet milk to  make a dough as stiff as biscuit. Make into small balls as large as  peaches, well floured. Drop into the soup three-quarters of an hour  before being served. This requires steady boiling, being closely  covered, and the cover not to be removed until taken up to serve. A  very good form of pot-pie.      SOYER'S RECIPE FOR FORCE MEATS.    Take 1-1/2 lbs. of lean veal from the fillet, and cut it in long thin  slices; scrape with a knife till nothing but the fibre remains; put it  in a mortar, pound it ten minutes or until in a puree; pass it through  a wire sieve (use the remainder in stock), then take 1 lb. of good  fresh beef suet, which skin, shred and chop very fine; put it in a  mortar and pound it, then add 6 oz. of panada (that is, bread soaked  in milk, and boiled till nearly dry) with the suet; pound them well  together, and add the veal, season with 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1/4  teaspoonful of pepper, 1/2 that of nutmeg; work all well together;  then add four eggs by degrees, continually pounding the contents of  the mortar. When well mixed, take a small piece in a spoon, and poach  it in some boiling water, and if it is delicate, firm, and of a good  flavor, it is ready for use.      CROUTONS FOR SOUP.    In a frying pan have the depth of an inch of boiling fat; also have  prepared slices of stale bread cut up into little half-inch squares;  drop into the frying pan enough of these bits of bread to cover the  surface of the fat. When browned, remove with a skimmer and drain; add  to the hot soup and serve.    Some prefer them prepared in this manner:    Take very thin slices of bread, butter them well; cut them up into  little squares three-fourths of an inch thick, place them in a baking  pan, buttered side up, and brown in a quick oven.      FISH STOCK.    Place a saucepan over the fire with a good-sized piece of sweet butter  and a sliced onion; put into that some sliced tomatoes, then add as  many different kinds of fish as you can get--oysters, clams, smelts,  pawns, crabs, shrimps and all kinds of pan-fish; cook all together  until the onions are well browned; then add a bunch of sweet herbs,  salt and pepper, and sufficient water to make the required amount of  stock. After this has cooked for half an hour pound it with a wooden  pestle, then strain and cook again until it jellies.      FISH SOUP.    Select a large, fine fish, clean it thoroughly, put it over the fire  with a sufficient quantity of water, allowing for each pound of fish  one quart of water; add an onion cut fine and a bunch of sweet herbs.  When the fish is cooked, and is quite tasteless, strain all through a  colander, return to the fire, add some butter, salt and pepper to  taste. A small tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce may be added if  liked. Serve with small squares of fried bread and thin slices of  lemon.      LOBSTER SOUP, OR BISQUE.    Have ready a good broth made of three pounds of veal boiled slowly in  as much water as will cover it, till the meat is reduced to shreds. It  must then be well strained.    Having boiled one fine middle-sized lobster, extract all the meat from  the body and claws. Bruise part of the coral in a mortar, and also an  equal quantity of the meat. Mix them well together. Add mace, cayenne,  salt and pepper, and make them up into force meat balls, binding the  mixture with the yolk of an egg slightly beaten.    Take three quarts of the veal broth and put it into the meat of the  lobster cut into mouthfuls. Boil it together about twenty minutes.  Then thicken it with the remaining coral (which you must first rub  through a sieve), and add the force meat balls and a little butter  rolled in flour. Simmer it gently for ten minutes, but do not let it  come to a boil, as that will injure the color. Serve with small dice  of bread fried brown in butter.      OYSTER SOUP, No. 1.    Two quarts of oysters, one quart of milk, two tablespoonfuls of  butter, one teacupful of hot water; pepper, salt.    Strain all the liquor from the oysters; add the water, and heat. When  near the boil, add the seasoning, then the oysters. Cook about five  minutes from the time they begin to simmer, until they \"ruffle.\" Stir  in the butter, cook one minute, and pour into the tureen. Stir in the  boiling milk and send to table. Some prefer all water in place of  milk.    [Illustration: IDA SAXTON McKINLEY.]    OYSTER SOUP. No. 2.    Scald one gallon of oysters in their own liquor. Add one quart of rich  milk to the liquor, and when it comes to a boil, skim out the oysters  and set aside. Add the yolks of four eggs, two good tablespoonfuls of  butter, and one of flour, all mixed well together, but in this  order--first, the milk, then, after beating the eggs, add a little of  the hot liquor to them gradually, and stir them rapidly into the soup.  Lastly, add the butter and whatever seasoning you fancy besides plain  pepper and salt, which must both be put in to taste with caution.    Celery salt most persons like extremely; others would prefer a little  marjoram or thyme; others again mace and a bit of onion. Use your own  discretion in this regard.      CLAM SOUP. (French Style.)    Mince two dozen hard shell clams very fine. Fry half a minced onion in  an ounce of butter; add to it a pint of hot water, a pinch of mace,  four cloves, one allspice and six whole pepper corns. Boil fifteen  minutes and strain into a saucepan; add the chopped clams and a pint  of clam-juice or hot water; simmer slowly two hours; strain and rub  the pulp through a sieve into the liquid. Return it to the saucepan  and keep it lukewarm. Boil three half-pints of milk in a saucepan  (previously wet with cold water, which prevents burning) and whisk it  into the soup. Dissolve a teaspoonful of flour in cold milk, add it to  the soup, taste for seasoning; heat it gently to near the boiling  point; pour into a tureen previously heated with hot water, and serve  with or without pieces of fried bread--called _croutons_ in kitchen  French.      CLAM SOUP.    Twenty-five clams chopped fine. Put over the fire the liquor that was  drained from them, and a cup of water; add the chopped clams and boil  half an hour; then season to taste with pepper and salt and a piece of  butter as large as an egg; boil up again and add one quart of milk  boiling hot, stir in a tablespoon of flour made to a cream with a  little cold milk, or two crackers rolled fine. Some like a little mace  and lemon juice in the seasoning.          MODES OF FRYING      The usual custom among professional cooks is to entirely immerse the  article to be cooked in boiling fat, but from inconvenience most  households use the half-frying method of frying in a small amount of  fat in a frying pan. For the first method a shallow iron frying  kettle, large at the top and small at the bottom, is best to use. The  fat should half fill the kettle, or an amount sufficient to float  whatever is to be fried; the heat of the fat should get to such a  degree that, when a piece of bread or a teaspoonful of the batter is  dropped in it, it will become brown almost instantly, but should not  be so hot as to burn the fat. Some cooks say that the fat should be  smoking, but my experience is, that is a mistake, as that soon ruins  the fat. As soon as it begins to smoke it should be removed a little  to one side, and still be kept at the boiling point. If fritters,  crullers, croquettes, etc., are dropped into fat that is too hot, it  crusts over the outside before the inside has fully risen, making a  heavy, hard article, and also ruining the fat, giving it a burnt  flavor.    Many French cooks prefer beef fat or suet to lard for frying purposes,  considering it more wholesome and digestible, does not impart as much  flavor, or adhere or soak into the article cooked as pork fat.    In families of any size, where there is much cooking required, there  are enough drippings and fat remnants from roasts of beef, skimmings  from the soup kettle, with the addition of occasionally a pound of  suet from the market, to amply supply the need. All such remnants and  skimmings should be clarified about twice a week, by boiling them all  together in water. When the fat is all melted, it should be strained  with the water and set aside to cool. After the fat on the top has  hardened, lift the cake from the water on which it lies, scrape off  all the dark particles from the bottom, then melt over again the fat;  while hot strain into a small clean stone jar or bright tin pail, and  then it is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13937"],[0,"The Mysterious Rider (#8)"],[1," hated you!\" he rasped out, hoarsely. Striking hard at Moore,  he missed, but a second effort landed a glancing blow on the  cowboy's face.    Moore staggered back, recovered his balance, and, hitting out shortly,  he returned the blow. Belllounds fell against the corral fence, which  upheld him.    \"Buster Jack--you're crazy!\" cried the cowboy, his eyes flashing. \"Do  you think you can lick me--after where you've been these three years?\"    Like a maddened boy Belllounds leaped forward, this time his increased  violence and wildness of face expressive of malignant rage. He swung his  arms at random. Moore avoided his blows and planted a fist squarely on  his adversary's snarling mouth. Belllounds fell with a thump. He got up  with clumsy haste, but did not rush forward again. His big, prominent  eyes held a dark and ugly look. His lower jaw wabbled as he panted for  breath and speech at once.    \"Moore--I'll kill--you!\" he hissed, with glance flying everywhere for a  weapon. From ground to cowboys he looked. Bludsoe was the only one  packing a gun. Belllounds saw it, and he was so swift in bounding  forward that he got a hand on it before Bludsoe could prevent.    \"Let go! Give me--that gun! By God! I'll fix him!\" yelled Belllounds, as  Bludsoe grappled with him.    There was a sharp struggle. Bludsoe wrenched the other's hands free,  and, pulling the gun, he essayed to throw it. But Belllounds blocked his  action and the gun fell at their feet.    \"Grab it!\" sang out Bludsoe, ringingly. \"Quick, somebody! The damned  fool'll kill Wils.\"    Lem, running in, kicked the gun just as Belllounds reached for it. When  it rolled against the fence Jim was there to secure it. Lem likewise  grappled with the struggling Belllounds.    \"Hyar, you Jack Belllounds,\" said Lem, \"couldn't you see Wils wasn't  packin' no gun? A-r'arin' like thet!... Stop your rantin' or we'll sure  handle you rough.\"    \"The old man's comin',\" called Jim, warningly.    The rancher appeared. He strode swiftly, ponderously. His gray hair  waved. His look was as stern as that of an eagle.    \"What the hell's goin' on?\" he roared.    The cowboys released Jack. That worthy, sullen and downcast, muttering  to himself, stalked for the house.    \"Jack, stand your ground,\" called old Belllounds.    But the son gave no heed. Once he looked back over his shoulder, and his  dark glance saw no one save Moore.    \"Boss, thar's been a little argyment,\" explained Jim, as with swift hand  he hid Bludsoe's gun. \"Nuthin' much.\"    \"Jim, you're a liar,\" replied the old rancher.    \"Aw!\" exclaimed Jim, crestfallen.    \"What're you hidin'?... You've got somethin' there. Gimme thet gun.\"    Without more ado Jim handed the gun over.    \"It's mine, boss,\" put in Bludsoe.    \"Ahuh? Wal, what was Jim hidin' it fer?\" demanded Belllounds.    \"Why, I jest tossed it to him--when I--sort of j'ined in with the  argyment. We was tusslin' some an' I didn't want no gun.\"    How characteristic of cowboys that they lied to shield Jack Belllounds!  But it was futile to attempt to deceive the old rancher. Here was a man  who had been forty years dealing with all kinds of men and events.    \"Bludsoe, you can't fool me,\" said old Bill, calmly. He had roared at  them, and his eyes still flashed like blue fire, but he was calm and  cool. Returning the gun to its owner, he continued: \"I reckon you'd  spare my feelin's an' lie about some trick of Jack's. Did he bust out?\"    \"Wal, tolerable like,\" replied Bludsoe, dryly.    \"Ahuh! Tell me, then--an' no lies.\"    Belllounds's shrewd eyes had rested upon Wilson Moore. The cowboy's  face showed the red marks of battle and the white of passion.    \"I'm not going to lie, you can bet on that,\" he declared, forcefully.    \"Ahuh! I might hev knowed you an' Jack'd clash,\" said Belllounds,  gruffly. \"What happened?\"    \"He hurt my horse. If it hadn't been for that there'd been no trouble.\"    A light leaped up in the old man's bold eyes. He was a lover of horses.  Many hard words, and blows, too, he had dealt cowboys for being brutal.    \"What'd he do?\"    \"Look at Spottie's mouth.\"    The rancher's way of approaching a horse was singularly different from  his son's, notwithstanding the fact that Spottie knew him and showed no  uneasiness. The examination took only a moment.    \"Tongue cut bad. Thet's a damn shame. Take thet bridle off.... There. If  it'd been an ornery hoss, now.... Moore, how'd this happen?\"    \"We just rode in,\" replied Wilson, hurriedly. \"I was saddling Spottie  when Jack came up. He took a shine to the mustang and wanted to ride  him. When Spottie reared--he's shy with strangers--why, Jack gave a hell  of a jerk on the bridle. The bit cut Spottie.... Well, that made me mad,  but I held in. I objected to Jack riding Spottie. You see, Hudson was  hurt yesterday and he appointed me foreman for to-day. I needed Spottie.  But your son couldn't see it, and that made me sore. Jack said the  mustang was his--\"    \"His?\" interrupted Belllounds.    \"Yes. He claimed Spottie. Well, he wasn't really mine, so I gave in.  When I threw off the saddle, which _was_ mine, Jack began to roar. He  said he was foreman and he'd have me discharged. But I said I'd quit  already. We both kept getting sorer and I called him Buster Jack.... He  hit me first. Then we fought. I reckon I was getting the best of him  when he made a dive for Bludsoe's gun. And that's all.\"    \"Boss, as sure as I'm a born cowman,\" put in Bludsoe, \"he'd hev plugged  Wils if he'd got my gun. At thet he damn near got it!\"    The old man stroked his scant gray beard with his huge, steady hand,  apparently not greatly concerned by the disclosure.    \"Montana, what do you say?\" he queried, as if he held strong store by  that quiet cowboy's opinion.    \"Wal, boss,\" replied Jim, reluctantly, \"Buster Jack's temper was bad  onct, but now it's plumb wuss.\"    Whereupon Belllounds turned to Moore with a gesture and a look of a man  who, in justice to something in himself, had to speak.    \"Wils, it's onlucky you clashed with Jack right off,\" he said. \"But thet  was to be expected. I reckon Jack was in the wrong. Thet hoss was yours  by all a cowboy holds right an' square. Mebbe by law Spottie belonged to  White Slides Ranch--to me. But he's yours now, fer I give him to you.\"    \"Much obliged, Belllounds. I sure do appreciate that,\" replied Moore,  warmly. \"It's what anybody'd gamble Bill Belllounds would do.\"    \"Ahuh! An' I'd take it as a favor if you'd stay on to-day an' get thet  brandin' done:\"    \"All right, I'll do that for you,\" replied Moore. \"Lem, I guess you  won't get your sleep till to-night. Come on.\"    \"Awl\" sighed Lem, as he picked up his bridle.           *       *       *       *       *    Late that afternoon Columbine sat upon the porch, watching the sunset.  It had been a quiet day for her, mostly indoors. Once only had she seen  Jack, and then he was riding by toward the pasture, whirling a lasso  round his head. Jack could ride like one born to the range, but he was  not an adept in the use of a rope. Nor had Columbine seen the old  rancher since breakfast. She had heard his footsteps, however, pacing  slowly up and down his room.    She was watching the last rays of the setting sun rimming with gold the  ramparts of the mountain eastward, and burning a crown for Old White  Slides peak. A distant bawl and bellow of cattle had died away. The  branding was over for that fall. How glad she felt! The wind, beginning  to grow cold as the sun declined, cooled her hot face. In the solitude  of her room Columbine had cried enough that day to scald her cheeks.    Presently, down the lane between the pastures, she saw a cowboy ride  into view. Very slowly he came, leading another horse. Columbine  recognized Lem a second before she saw that he was leading Pronto. That  struck her as strange. Another glance showed Pronto to be limping.  Apparently he could just get along, and that was all. Columbine ran out  in dismay, reaching the corral gate before Lem did. At first she had  eyes only for her beloved mustang.    \"Oh, Lem--Pronto's hurt!\" she cried.    \"Wal, I should smile he is,\" replied Lem.    But Lem was not smiling. And when he wore a serious face for Columbine  something had indeed happened. The cowboy was the color of dust and so  tired that he reeled.    \"Lem, he's all bloody!\" exclaimed Columbine, as she ran toward Pronto.    \"Hyar, you jest wait,\" ordered Lem, testily. \"Pronto's all cut up, an'  you gotta hustle some linen an' salve.\"    Columbine flew away to do his bidding, and so quick and violent was she  that when she got back to the corral she was out of breath. Pronto  whinnied as she fell, panting, on her knees beside Lem, who was  examining bloody gashes on the legs of the mustang.    \"Wal, I reckon no great harm did,\" said Lem, with relief. \"But he shore  hed a close shave. Now you help me doctor him up.\"    \"Yes--I'll help,\" panted Columbine. \"I've done this kind--of thing  often--but never--to Pronto.... Oh, I was afraid--he'd been gored by  a steer.\"    \"Wal, he come damn near bein',\" replied Lem, grimly. \"An' if it hedn't  been fer ridin' you don't see every day, why thet ornery Texas steer'd  hev got him.\"    \"Who was riding? Lem, was it you? Oh, I'll never be able to do enough  for you!\"    \"Wuss luck, it weren't me,\" said Lem.    \"No? Who, then?\"    \"Wal, it was Wils, an' he made me swear to tell you nuthin'--leastways  about him.\"    \"Wils! Did he save Pronto?... And didn't want you to tell me? Lem,  something has happened. You're not like yourself.\"    \"Miss Collie, I reckon I'm nigh all in,\" replied Lem, wearily. \"When I  git this bandagin' done I'll fall right off my hoss.\"    \"But you're on the ground now, Lem,\" said Columbine, with a nervous  laugh. \"What happened?\"    \"Did you hear about the argyment this mawnin'?\"    \"No. What--who--\"    \"You can ask Ole Bill aboot thet.
