[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15145"],[0,"My Book of Favourite Fairy Tales (#8)"],[1,"  [Illustration: _Painted by Jennie Harbour_  THE WHITE FAWN]    Soon after his terrible disappointment, Prince Guerrier, unable to  bear any longer the life at court, secretly departed from the palace  with his faithful friend Becafigue, leaving a letter for his father  saying he would return to him as soon as his mind was in a happier  state, and begging him meanwhile to keep the ugly Princess prisoner,  and think of some revenge upon the deceitful king, her father.    After three or four days' journeying, the wanderers found themselves  in a thick forest. Quite wearied out, the Prince threw himself  upon the ground, while Becafigue went on further in search of fruit  wherewith to refresh his royal master.    It is a long time since we left the White Fawn, that is to say the  charming Princess.    Very desolately she wept when in a stream she saw her figure  reflected, and when night came she was in great fear, for she heard  wild beasts about her, and sometimes forgetting she was a fawn she  would try to climb a tree. But with morning dawn she felt a little  safer, and the sun appeared a marvellous sight to her from which she  could hardly turn her eyes. But now the Fairy Tulip, who had always  loved the Princess guided Giroflee's feet in her direction, and  when the White Fawn saw her faithful Maid of Honour her delight was  boundless.    It did not take Giroflee long to discover that this was her  dearly-loved mistress, and she promised the White Fawn never to  forsake her, for she found she could hear all that was said although  she could not speak. Towards night the fear of having no shelter made  the two friends so dreadfully dismayed that the Fairy Tulip suddenly  appeared before them.    [Illustration]    \"I am not going to scold you,\" she said, \"although it is through not  following my advice that you are in this misfortune, for it goes to  my heart to see you thus. I cannot release you altogether from this  enchantment, but I have power to shorten the time, and also to say  that during the night you may regain your rightful form, but by day  again must you run through the forest as a Fawn.\" The fairy also told  them where they could find a little hut in which to pass the nights.  Then she disappeared. Giroflee and the Fawn walked in the direction  the Fairy had pointed out, and arrived at a neat little cottage where  an old woman showed them a room which they could occupy.    As soon as it was night Desiree came to her rightful form, but when  day appeared she was once more a Fawn and, escaping into the thicket,  commenced to run about in the ordinary way.    You have heard how Prince Guerrier rested in the forest while  Becafigue searched for fruit; quite late in the evening Becafigue  arrived at the cottage of the good woman who had given shelter to  Giroflee and the White Fawn. He addressed her politely and asked for  the things he required for his master. She hastened to fill a basket,  and gave it to him, saying, \"I fear that if you pass a night without  shelter some harm may come to you. I can offer you a poor one, but at  any rate it is secure from the lions.\"    Becafigue went back to the Prince and together they returned to the  cottage, where they were led into the room next to that occupied by  the Princess.    Next morning the Prince arose early and went out; he had not long been  in the forest when he saw a beautiful little Fawn. Hunting had ever  been his favourite pastime, and now he pursued the little creature.  All day long hither and thither he chased, but did not succeed in  capturing her, and as evening fell the Fawn slipped away and gained  the little hut where Giroflee anxiously awaited her, and on hearing  her adventure the Maid of Honour told her she must never again venture  out, but the Princess replied:    \"It is no use talking thus, when I am a Fawn this room is stifling to  me and I must depart from it.\"    The next day the young Prince sought in vain for the White Fawn, and  finally tired out threw himself upon the grass and fell asleep.    While he lay there the little Fawn drew near and looking at him  quietly, to her astonishment she recognised his features as those of  the Prince Guerrier. Coming nearer and nearer she presently touched  him and he awoke.    His surprise was great at seeing close by the shy little Fawn, who  stayed not an instant longer but fled away, the Prince following.    \"Stay, dear little Fawn,\" he cried, \"I would not hurt you for the  world.\" But the wind carried off the words before they reached her  ears. Long he chased the poor creature, till at last worn out the Fawn  sank down on the ground and the Prince came up to her.    \"Beautiful Fawn,\" said he, \"do not fear me, I shall lead you with  me everywhere.\" Then he covered her with roses and fed her with the  choicest leaves and grasses.    But as evening drew near the Fawn longed to escape, for what would  happen should she suddenly change into a Princess there in the forest.  Presently the Prince went to fetch some water for her, and while he  was gone she ran homewards. The next day for a long time she hid from  the Prince, but at last he found her, and as she dashed off he shot an  arrow which wounded her in the leg.    Sad that he should have done so cruel a thing, the Prince took herbs  and laid them upon the wound, and at last he went to fetch Becafigue  to help him carry her to the house. He tied her to a tree.    Alas! Who would have thought that the most beautiful Princess in the  world would be treated thus? While she was straining at the ribbons  trying to break them, Giroflee arrived, and was leading her away when  the Prince met them and claimed the Fawn as his.    \"Sir,\" politely replied Giroflee, \"the Fawn was mine before it was  yours,\" and she spoke to the Fawn, and the Fawn obeyed her in such  a way that the Prince could not doubt that what she said was true.  Giroflee then went on, and, to the surprise of the Prince and  Becafigue, entered the old woman's house where they themselves lodged.  Then Becafigue told the Prince that unless he was much mistaken the  owner of the Fawn had lived with the Princess Desiree when he went  there as ambassador.    \"I mean to see her again,\" said Becafigue, \"there is only a partition  between her room and ours.\" And soon he had made a hole large enough  to peep through, and through it he saw the charming Princess dressed  in a robe of brocaded silver, with flowers embroidered in gold and  emeralds, her hair falling in heavy masses on the most beautiful neck  in the world. Giroflee was on her knees before her, bandaging up  one arm from which the blood was flowing. They both seemed greatly  concerned about the wound: \"Let me die,\" the Princess was saying,  \"death would be better than the life which I lead. To be a Fawn all  the day, to hear him speaking, and not to be able to tell him of my  sad fate.\"    One can guess the astonishment of Becafigue and of the Prince.  Guerrier would almost have died of pleasure had he not thought that  it must be some enchantment, for did he not know that Desiree and her  Lady in Waiting were shut up in the castle.    He went softly and knocked at the chamber door, which Giroflee opened,  thinking it was the old woman, for she required help for the wounded  arm.    The Prince entered, threw himself at Desiree's feet, and found she was  indeed his Princess.    Great was their joy thus at last meeting, and while they were talking  to each other the night passed, and the day dawned, and daylight came,  and the morning sun shone brightly before Desiree had time to notice  that she had not again taken the shape of a Fawn, but was her own  beautiful self.    Then it was found that it was the Fairy Tulip in disguise of the old  woman who had provided that sheltering cottage in the forest.    The joy of the King upon once more seeing his son can well be  imagined, and the marriage of the Prince and Desiree, and Becafigue  and Giroflee took place on the same day, the Fairies giving their  diamond palace as their wedding present to Princess Desiree, and Fairy  Tulip presenting four gold mines in the Indies to Giroflee.    [Illustration]    And, in accordance with the wish of Princess Desiree, Longue Epine and  her mother, the false Lady in Waiting, were set at liberty.    [Illustration]          HANSEL AND GRETHEL      Once upon a time there dwelt near a large wood a poor wood cutter,  with his wife, and two children by his former marriage, a little boy  called Hansel, and a girl named Grethel. He had little enough to break  or bite; and once, when there was a great famine in the land, he could  hardly procure even his daily bread; and as he lay thinking in his bed  one night, he sighed, and said to his wife, \"What will become of us?  How can we feed our children, when we have no more than we can eat  ourselves?\"    \"Know then, my husband,\" answered she, \"we will lead them away, quite  early in the morning, into the thickest part of the wood, and there  make them a fire, and give them each a little piece of bread, then we  will go to our work, and leave them alone, so they will not find the  way home again, and we shall be freed from them.\"    \"No, wife,\" replied he, \"that I can never do; how can you bring your  heart to leave my children all alone in the wood; for the wild beasts  will soon come and tear them to pieces?\"    \"Oh, you simpleton!\" said she, \"then we must all four die of hunger;  you had better plane the coffins for us.\" But she left him no peace  till he consented, saying, \"Ah, but I shall miss the poor children.\"    The two children, however, had not gone to sleep, for very hunger, and  so they overheard what the stepmother said to their father. Grethel  wept bitterly, and said to Hansel, \"What will become of us?\"    \"Be quiet, Grethel,\" said he; \"do not cry--I will help you.\" And as  soon as their parents had gone to sleep, he got up, put on his coat,  and, unbarring the back door, went out."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15147"],[0,"Beeton's Book of Needlework (#8)"],[1," entirely new, but very pretty and effective when cotton of very  different sizes is used. The tatting is begun with a row of circles  two-thirds of an inch distant from each other; each circle consists of  13 stitches of plain tatting. Fasten a 2nd row to the 1st, and a 3rd to  the 2nd, by working a circle of 13 stitches of plain tatting at  one-third of an inch distance, * then at the same distance; fasten the  cotton on the next circle of the preceding row, work a circle at the  same distance again, and repeat from *. The cotton is fastened on the  circles by drawing it through the circle with a crochet-needle, so as to  form a loop, and then drawing it out of the loop. Take care to keep the  distance between 2 circles always the same. Between the circles of the  3rd row draw another piece of cotton, by fastening the cotton on each  circle of the 3rd row at distances of two-thirds of an inch. Then work  the lower edge of the border in the following way:--1 small spot called  a _Josephine knot_ (for which work 5 stitches of plain tatting, draw the  cotton downwards through the loop which fastens the stitches, and draw  up the whole), fasten the cotton between the next two circles of the 3rd  row, * and a little further make a spot consisting of 8 stitches of  single tatting, close to this a circle formed of 3 double, 9 purl  divided by 2 double, 3 double; then again a spot of 8 stitches of plain  tatting, turn the 2 last spots so as to make their round sides come  opposite one another; fasten the cotton on again between the 2 next  circles of the 3rd row. Then a little further off work 1 small spot (5  stitches of plain tatting), 1 circle of 3 double, 1 purl, 2 double  fastened on the last purl of the preceding circle, 2 double, 5 purl  divided by 2 double, 3 double; then again a small spot (5 plain  stitches), fasten the cotton on again between the next 2 circles of the  3rd row, and repeat from *, always fastening each new circle to the  corresponding purl of the preceding one. On the other long side, the  border is completed by 2 rows of crochet. The 1st row is formed by  working 1 double under the piece of cotton between 2 circles of the 1st  row, with 5 chain stitches between.    2nd row: 1 treble in every other stitch, 1 chain stitch after every  treble. The strip of insertion is then tacked on a piece of cardboard or  oil-cloth, and the lace stitches are worked between the circles, as is  seen in illustration.           *       *       *       *       *    45.--_Tatted Rosette._    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 30 for  large rosette, No. 80 for small rosette; tatting-pin No. 3.    This rosette forms a very pretty trimming for lingerie--cravats, caps,  handkerchiefs, &c. The raised pattern in the centre consists of 4  rounds, consisting of 5 circles each, which are sewn together and then  fastened on the rosette. The 5 circles of each round must be worked  close to each other: after working the last circle of each round, knot  the beginning and end of the cotton together. Each circle of the  smallest round has 9 double, the circles of the next round each 15, the  circles of the following one 21, and the circles of the last and largest  round 27 double stitches. When these circles have been sewn on one to  another as in illustration, work a large circle consisting of 4 double,  1 purl, 9 times alternately 5 double, 1 purl, then 1 double. The purls  of this circle are fastened on to the circles of the next round of the  rosette. Fasten the cotton on to the next purl of the middle circle, and  work a circle as follows:--4 double, 1 purl, 4 double, 1 purl, 3 double,  1 purl, 3 double, 1 purl, 4 double, 1 purl, 4 double. Repeat 9 times  more from *, but now, instead of working the 1st purl of every circle,  fasten it on to the last purl of the preceding circle. Then fasten the  cotton. For the last round, which consists of scallops and rounds,  fasten the cotton on to the middle purl of a circle of the preceding  round, and work a circle consisting of 3 times alternately 4 double, 1    [Illustration: 45.--Tatted Rosette.]    purl, then 4 double. Then fasten a second thread on to the same purl on  which the just completed circle has been fastened, and over which all  the scallops are to be worked. Work over it 5 double, fastened on to the  last purl of the preceding circle, 4 double, 1 purl, 4 double, 1 purl, 5  double. Fasten the cotton on to the middle purl of the next circle of  the preceding round, and repeat from * till the round is completed; but  in working these circles, instead of the first purl, fasten them on to  the last purl of the preceding scallop. Lastly, the raised pattern is  sewn on.           *       *       *       *       *    46.--_Linen Bag for Tatting, &c._    Materials: Fine linen; Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No.  30 or 40; tatting-pin No. 2.    [Illustration: 46.--Linen Bag for Tatting, &c.]    This pretty linen bag is meant to keep tatting and such work from being  soiled before it is completed. The bag is drawn together round the top.  Its size depends upon what you wish to put into it. The original  pattern is 3-3/4 inches deep, and 3 inches wide; it is hemmed round the  top, and trimmed with a narrow tatted lace, consisting of large and  small circles.           *       *       *       *       *    47.--_Tatted Border._    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 40;  tatting-pin No. 2.    [Illustration: 47.--Tatted Border.]    Begin this elegant border with 2 rows of tatting, in the following  manner:--    1st row: 2 double, 1 purl, 3 double, 1 purl, 3 double, 1 purl, 2 double;  draw these stitches up into a circle, and repeat the circle at a very  short distance, till the border is long enough; but instead of working  the first purl of each circle, you must join the circle to the preceding  one; the purl on the sides of the circle must therefore be longer than  that in the middle.    For the 2nd row take another shuttle, make a loop on the left side with  the cotton, and work with this end of cotton over the cotton in the  right hand, which is also to be held between the thumb and forefinger of  the left hand. Then work in the following way:--2 double, then 1 circle  consisting of 3 double, 1 purl, 3 double; to form this circle, let the  cotton in the left-hand shuttle fall downwards, and make a loop round  the left hand with the cotton on the shuttle of the right hand. Then  take up again the left-hand shuttle, and join the circle to the middle  purl of the 1st circle of the 1st row by drawing the cotton through the  purl like a loop, and then drawing the cotton in the right hand through  this loop. * 7 double, 1 circle, 7 double, joined to the middle purl of  the next circle of the 1st row; 1 circle, 5 double, 1 circle joined on  the middle purl of the following circle; repeat from *.    The upper edge of the border is worked in 2 crochet rows, in the  following manner:--    1st row: * 2 treble, divided by 1 chain in the 1st circle of the 1st row  of tatting; 2 chain; repeat from *.    2nd row: * 1 treble in the 1st chain of the preceding row, 1 purl (3  chain, 1 slip stitch in the 1st), miss 1 stitch of the preceding row  under it; repeat from *.           *       *       *       *       *    48.--_Rosette in Embroidery and Tatting._    Materials for trimmings: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s knitting cotton  No. 20; tatting cotton No. 50; tatting-pin No. 3. For couvrettes,  crochet cotton No. 4.    This rosette, joined to other similar ones, forms a very pretty trimming  for articles of fine linen, or even for small couvrettes; if used for  the former, they must be worked with very fine cotton. The centre of the  rosette is formed of an embroidered raised pattern worked in _point de  minute_; round this centre there are small circles worked in button-hole  stitch; the embroidery is worked with knitting cotton, the circles with  crochet cotton. Before beginning the circles, make a circle consisting  of a foundation chain of 80 stitches, in order to be able to fasten the  button-hole stitch; in each of the stitches of the foundation chain work  1 double, then fasten the cotton. In the 2nd round of these circles  fasten the cotton on every 5th stitch of the crochet circle. Work 1  round of open-work treble stitch in the double stitch of the crochet  circle, work in tatting the border of the rosette as follows in 1  round:--* 2 double, 1 purl, 2 double, fastened on to 1 chain stitch  between 2 treble stitch, 2 double; 1 purl, 2 double,; join these  stitches into a circle; turn the work so that the wrong side lies  upwards, and work a second larger circle at a short distance consisting  of 4 double, 5 purl divided by 2 double, 4 double, turn again and repeat  from *. The smaller circles must be fastened after every other treble  stitch; the larger and smaller circles must be fastened above one  another at the place of the 1st purl.

Walter Evans and Co's tatting cotton No. 60;  tatting-pin No. 2.    [Illustration: 49.--Linen Collar trimmed with Tatting.]    The diamond pattern placed in the corner of the collar is commenced in  the centre. For each of the four centre leaves work 6 double stitches, 6  purl divided one from the other by 3 double stitches, then 6 more  double stitches. Fasten off the cotton, cut it, and begin a fresh leaf  by working 2 double stitches, 10 purl divided one from the other by 2  double stitches, then 2 more double stitches. (This small leaf forms one  of the corners of the diamond pattern.) Fasten the cotton to the fourth  purl of one of the four centre leaves, and work another leaf similar to  the preceding. Join this leaf by its two centre purl to the two last  purl of the corner leaf (see illustration). After two "]]]
