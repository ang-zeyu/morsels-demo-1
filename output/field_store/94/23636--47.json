There is another and still more poisonous form  which is smuggled into India from abroad and surreptitiously circulated.          CHAPTER III.    A HINDU REVIVAL      Thirty years ago, when I first visited India, the young Western-educated  Hindu was apt to be, at least intellectually, _plus royaliste que le  roi._ he plucked with both hands at the fruits of the tree of Western  knowledge. Some were enthusiastic students of English literature, and  especially of English poetry. They had their Wordsworth and their  Browning Societies. Others steeped themselves in English history and  loved to draw their political inspiration from Milton and Burke and John  Stuart Mill. Others, again, were the humble disciples of Kant and  Schlegel, of Herbert Spencer and Darwin. But whatever their special  talent bent might be, the vast majority professed allegiance to Western  ideals, and if they had not altogether-and often far too  hastily-abjured, or learned secretly to despise, the beliefs and customs  of their forefathers, they were at any rate anxious to modify and bring  them into harmony with those of their Western teachers. They may often  have disliked the Englishman, but they respected and admired him; if  they resented his frequent assumption of the unqualified superiority,  they were disposed to admit that it was not without justification. The  enthusiasm kindled in the first half of the last century by the great  missionaries, like Carey and Duff, who had made distinguished converts  among the highest classes of Hindu society, had begun to wane; but if  educated Hindus had grown more reluctant to accept the dogmas of  Christianity, they were still ready to acknowledge the superiority of  Western ethics, and the Brahmo Samaj in Bengal, the Prarthana Samaj in  Bombay, the Social Reform movement which found eloquent advocates all  over India, and not least in Madras, and other agencies of a similar  character for purging Hindu life of its more barbarous and superstitious  associations, bore witness to the ascendancy which Western standards of  morality exercised over the Hindu mind. Keshub Chunder Sen was not  perhaps cast in so fine a mould as Ram Mohan Roy or the more  conservative Dr. Tagore, but his ideals were the same, and his  life-dream was to find a common denominator for Hinduism and  Christianity which should secure a thorough reform of Hindu society  without denationalizing it.    Nor were the milder forms of political activity promoted by the founders  of the Indian National Congress inconsistent with the acceptance of  British rule or with the recognition of the great benefits which it has  conferred upon India, and least of all with a genuine admiration for  Western civilization. For many of them at least the political boons  which they craved from their rulers were merely the logical corollaries  of the moral and intellectual as well as of the material boons which  they had already received. The fierce political agitation of later years  denies the benefits of British rule and even the superiority of the  civilization for which it stands. It has invented the legend of a golden  age, when all the virtues flourished and India was a land flowing with  milk and honey until British lust of conquest brought it to ruin. No  doubt even to-day there are many eminent Hindus who would still rely  upon the older methods, and who have sufficiently assimilated the  education they have received at the hands of Englishmen to share  wholeheartedly the faith and pride of the latter in British ideals of  liberty and self-government, and to be honestly convinced that those  ideals might be more fully realized in the government of their own  country if British administrators would only repose greater confidence  in the natives of India and give them a larger share in the conduct of  public affairs. But men of this type are now to be found chiefly amongst  the older generation.    No one who has studied, however scantily, the social and religious  system which for the sake of convenience we call Hinduism will deny the  loftiness of the philosophic conceptions which underlie even the  extravagances of its creed or the marvellous stability of the complex  fabric based upon its social code. It may seem to us to present in many  of its aspects an almost unthinkable combination of spiritualistic  idealism and of gross materialism, of asceticism and of sensuousness, of  over-weening arrogance when it identifies the human self with the  universal self and merges man in the Divinity and the Divinity in man,  and of demoralizing pessimism when it preaches that life itself is but a  painful illusion, and that the sovereign remedy and end of all evils is  non-existence. Its mythology is often as revolting as the rigidity of  its caste laws, which condemn millions of human beings to such social  abasement that their very touch--the very shadow thrown by their  body--is held to pollute the privileged mortals who are born into the  higher castes. Nevertheless, Hinduism has for more than thirty centuries  responded to the social and religious aspirations of a considerable  fraction of the human race. It represents a great and ancient  civilization, and that the Hindus should cling to it is not surprising.  Nor is it surprising that after the first attraction exerted by the  impact of an alien civilization equipped with all the panoply of  organized force and scientific achievements had worn off, a certain  reaction should have ensued. In the same way it was inevitable that,  after the novelty of British rule, of the law and order and security for  life and property which it had established, had gradually worn away,  those who had never experienced the evils from which it had freed India  should begin to chafe under the restraints which it imposed. What is  disheartening and alarming are the lengths to which this reaction has  been carried. For among the younger generation of Hindus there has  unquestionably grown up a deep-seated and bitter hostility not only to  British rule and to British methods of administration, but to all the  influences of Western civilization, and the rehabilitation of Hindu  customs and beliefs has proceeded _pari passu_ with the growth of  political disaffection.    Practices which an educated Hindu would have been at pains to explain  away, if he had not frankly repudiated them thirty years ago, now find  zealous apologists. Polytheism is not merely extolled as the poetic  expression of eternal verities, but the gods and goddesses of the Hindu  pantheon are being invested with fresh sanctity. The Brahmo Saniaj is  still a great influence for good, but it appears to be gradually losing  vitality, and though its literary output is still considerable, its  membership is shrinking. The Prarthana Samaj is moribund. The fashion of  the day is for religious \"revivals,\" in which the worship of Kali, the  sanguinary goddess of destruction, or the cult of Shivaji-Maharaj, the  Mahratta chieftain who humbled in his day the pride of the alien  conquerors of Hindustan, plays an appropriately conspicuous part. The  Arya-Samaj, which is spreading all over the Punjab and in the United  Provinces, represents in one of its aspects a revolt against Hindu  orthodoxy, but in another it represents equally a revolt against Western  ideals, for in the teachings of its founder, Dayanand, it has found an  aggressive gospel which bases the claims of Aryan, _i.e._, Hindu,  supremacy on the Vedas as the one ultimate source of human and Divine  wisdom. The exalted character of Vedantic philosophy has been as widely  recognized among European students as the subtle beauty of many of the  Upanishads, in which the cryptic teachings of the Vedas have been  developed along different and often conflicting lines of thought to  suit the eclecticism of the Hindu mind. But the Arya-Samaj has not been  content to assert the ethical perfection of the Vedas. In its zeal to  proclaim the immanent superiority of Aryan civilization--it repudiates  the term Hindu as savouring of an alien origin--over Western  civilization, it claims to have discovered in the Vedas the germs of all  the discoveries of modern science, even to wireless telegraphy and  aeroplanes.    Just as the political agitation in India has derived invaluable  encouragement from a handful of British members of Parliament and other  sympathizers in Europe and America, so this Hindu revival has been  largely stimulated and to some extent prompted by Europeans and  Americans. Not only the writings of English and German scholars, like  Max Mueller and Deutsch, helped enormously to revive the interest of  educated Hindus in their ancient literature and earlier forms of  religion, but it was in the polemical tracts of European writers that  the first protagonists of Hindu reaction against Christian influences  found their readiest weapons of attack. The campaign was started in 1887  by the Hindu Tract Society of Madras, which set itself first to inflame  popular fanaticism against the missionaries, who, especially in the  south of India, had been the pioneers of Western education. Bradlaugh's  text-books and the pamphlets of many lesser writers belonging to the  same school of thought were eagerly translated into the vernacular, and  those that achieved the greatest popularity were books like \"The Evil of  Continence,\" in which not only Christian theology, but Christian  morality was held up to scorn and ridicule. The advent of the  theosophists, heralded by Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott, gave a  fresh impetus to the revival, and certainly no Hindu has done so much to  organize and consolidate the movement as Mrs. Annie Besant, who, in her  Central Hindu College at Benares and her Theosophical Institution at  Adyar, near Madras, has openly proclaimed her faith in the superiority  of the whole Hindu system to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16459"],[0,"Musical Memories (#8)"],[1,"de Lorme_ seemed until very lately to be  accurate, but recent discoveries show us that he was quite different.    Napoleon III reigned only yesterday, but his picture is already painted  in different tints. My entire youth was passed in his reign and my  recollections represent him neither as the monster depicted by Victor  Hugo nor the kind sympathetic sovereign of present-day stories.    There has been a great deal of discussion of the causes which brought on  the War of 1870. We know all that was said and done during the last days  of that crisis, but will anyone ever know what was hidden in the minds  of the sovereigns, the ministers, and the ambassadors? Will it ever be  known whether the Emperor provoked Gramont or Gramont the Emperor? Did  they even know themselves? There is one thing the most discerning  historian can never reach--the depths of the human soul.    We may, however, learn the secrets of the tomb. It was asserted for a  long time that the remains of Voltaire and Rousseau had been exhumed,  desecrated, and thrown into the sewers. Victor Hugo wrote a wonderful  account of this--an account such as only he could write. One fine day  doubt about this occurrence popped up unexpectedly. After waiting a long  time it was decided to get to the heart of the matter, and they finally  opened the coffins of the two great men. They were peacefully sleeping  their last sleep. The deed never took place; its history was a myth.    In this connection Victor Hugo's credulity may be mentioned, for it was  astonishing in a man of such colossal genius. He believed in the most  incredible things, as the \"Man in the Iron Mask,\" the twin brother of  Louis XIV; in the octopus that has no mouth and feeds itself through its  arms; and in the reality of the Japanese sirens which the Japanese were  said to make out of an ape and a fish. He had some excuse for the sirens  as the Academie des Sciences believed in them for a short time.    If what is called history is so near mythology as, many times, to be  confounded with it, what about romance and the historical drama in which  events, entirely imaginative, must of necessity find a place? What about  the long-drawn-out conversations in books and on the stage that are  attributed to historical persons? What about the actions attributed to  them, which need not be true but only seem to be so? The supernatural  element is the only thing lacking to make such works mythological in  every way.    Now the supernatural lends itself admirably to expression in music and  music finds in the supernatural a wealth of resources. But these  resources are by no means indispensable. What music must have above all  are emotions and passions laid bare and set in action by what we term  the situation. And where can one find more or better situations than in  history?           *       *       *       *       *    From the time of Lulli until the end of the Eighteenth Century French  opera was legendary, that is to say, it was mythological in character  and was not, as has been pretended, limited to the depiction of emotion  and the inner feelings in order to avoid contingencies. The real motive  was to find in fables material for a spectacle. Tragedy, as we know,  does not do this, for it can be developed only with considerable  difficulty when the stage is crowded with actors. On the contrary,  opera, which is free in its movements and can fill a vast stage, seeks  for pomp, display and haloes in which gods and goddesses appear, in fact  all that can be put into a stage-setting. If they did not use local  color, it was because local color had not been invented. Finally, as we  all get tired of everything, so they tired of mythology. Then the  historical work was adopted and appeared on the stage with success, as  is well known. The historical method had no rival until _Robert le  Diable_ rather timidly brought back the legendary element which  triumphed later in the work of Richard Wagner.    In the meantime _Les Huguenots_ succeeded _Robert le Diable_ and for  half a century this was the bright particular star of historical opera.  Even now, although its traditions have largely been forgotten and  although its workmanship is rather inferior to that of a later time,  this memorable work nevertheless shines, like the setting sun,  surprisingly brilliantly. The several generations who admired this work  were not altogether wrong. There is no necessity to class this brilliant  success as a failure, because Robert Schumann, who knew nothing about  the stage, denied its worth. It is surprising that Berlioz's judgment  has not been set against Schumann's. Berlioz showed his enthusiasm for  _Les Huguenots_ in his famous treatise on instrumentation.    The great public is little interested in technical polemics and is  faithful to the old successes. Although little by little success has  come to operas based on legends, there still remains a taste for operas  with a historical background. This is not without a reason for as an  authoritative critic has said: \"A historical drama may contain lyric  possibilities far greater than most of the poor, weak mythological  librettos on which composers waste their strength, fully persuaded that  by doing so they cause 'the holy spirit of Bayreuth to descend upon  them.'\"    And they never would have dreamed of being mythological, if their god,  instead of turning to Scandinavian mythology, had followed his original  intention of dramatizing the exploits of Frederick Barbarossa. In his  youth he was not opposed to historical opera, for he eulogized _La  Musette de Portici_, _La Juive_, and _La Reine de Chypre_. He made some  justifiable criticisms of the libretto of the last work, although he  admitted that the composer had contrived to write beautiful passages.    \"We cannot praise Halevy too highly,\" he wrote, \"for the firmness with  which he resists every temptation, to which many of his contemporaries  succumb, to steal easy applause by relying blindly on the talent of the  singers. On the contrary, he demands that his _virtuosi_, even the most  famous of them, shall subordinate themselves to the lofty inspiration  of his Muse. He attains this result by the simplicity and truth he knows  how to stamp on dramatic melodies.\"    This is what Richard Wagner said about _La Juive_ in 1842.    Fortunately we no longer demand that operas be mythological, for if we  did we should have to condemn the famous Russian operas and that is out  of the question. However, the method of treatment is still in dispute  and this question is involved. One method of treatment is admitted and  another is not and it is extremely difficult to tell what is what.    I am now going to do a little special pleading for my _Henri VIII_,  which, it would seem, is not in the proper manner. Not that I want to  defend the music or to protest against the criticisms it has inspired,  for that is not done. But I may, perhaps, be permitted to speak of the  piece itself and to tell how the music was adapted to it.    According to the critics it would seem that the whole of _Henri VIII_ is  superficial and without depth, _en facade_; that the souls of the  characters are not revealed, and that the King, at first all sugary  sweetness, suddenly becomes a monster without any preparation for, or  explanation of, the change.    In this connection let us consider _Boris Godounof_, for there is a  historical drama suited to its music. I saw _Boris Godounof_ with  considerable interest. I heard pleasant and impressive passages, and  others less so. In one scene I saw an insignificant friar who suddenly  becomes the Emperor in the next scene. One entire act is made up of  processions, the ringing of bells, popular songs, and dazzling costumes.  In another scene a nurse tells pretty stories to the children in her  charge. Then there is a love duet, which is neither introduced nor has  any relationship to the development of the work; an incomprehensible  evening entertainment, and, finally, funeral scenes in which Chaliapine  was admirable. It was not my fault if I did not discover in all that the  inner life, the psychology, the introductions, and the explanations  which they complain they do not find in _Henri VIII_.    \"To Henry VIII,\" it is stated at the beginning of the work, \"nothing is  sacred, neither friendship, love nor his word--ill are playthings of  his mad whims. He knows neither law nor justice.\" And when, a little  later, smiling, the King hands the holy water to the ambassador he is  receiving, the orchestra reveals the working of his mind by repeating  the music of the preceding scene. From beginning to end the work is  written in this way. But dissertations on such details have not been  given the public; the themes of felony, cruelty, and duplicity, and of  this and that, have not, as is the fashion of the day, been underlined,  so that the critics are excusable for not seeing them.    Not a scene, not a word, they say, shows the soul of Henry VIII. I would  like to ask if it is not revealed in the great scene between Henry and  Catharine, where he plays with her as a cat with a mouse, where he veils  his desire to be rid of her under his religious scruples, and where he  heaps on her constantly vile and cruel insinuations, or even in the last  scene with its cruel hypocrisies. It is difficult to see why all his  passions and all his feelings are not brought into play here. The  Russian librettos do no more, nor the operas based on mythology.    But to continue. From the point of view of opera mythology offers one  advantage in the use of the miraculous. But the rest of the mythical  element offers, rather, difficulties. Characters who never existed and  in whom no one believes cannot be made interesting in themselves. They  do not sustain, as is sometimes supposed, the music and poetry. On the  contrary, the music and poetry give them such reality as they possess.  We could"]]]
