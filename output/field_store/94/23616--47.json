When Herutataf arrived at the village,  the chair was set down on the ground, and he got out of it and stood up  ready to greet the old man, whom he found lying upon a bed, with the  door of his house lying on the ground. One servant stood by the bed  holding the sage's head and fanning him, and another was engaged in  rubbing his feet. Herutataf addressed a highly poetical speech to Teta,  the gist of which was that the old man seemed to be able to defy the  usual effects of old age, and to be like one who had obtained the secret  of everlasting youth, and then expressed the hope that he was well.  Having paid these compliments, which were couched in dignified and  archaic language, Herutataf went on to say that he had come with a  message from his father Khufu, who hereby summoned Teta to his presence.  \"I have come,\" he said, \"a long way to invite thee, so that thou mayest  eat the food, and enjoy the good things which the king bestows on those  who follow him, and so that he may conduct thee after a happy life to  thy fathers who rest in the grave.\" The sage replied, \"Welcome, Prince  Herutataf, welcome, O thou who lovest thy father. Thy father shall  reward thee with gifts, and he shall promote thee to the rank of the  senior officials of his court. Thy Ka[2] shall fight successfully  against thine enemy, thy soul knows the ways of the Other World, and  thou shalt arrive at the door of those who are apparelled in ... I  salute thee, O Prince Herutataf.\"    [Footnote 1: These were probably books and instruments which the  magicians of the day used in making astrological calculations, or in  working magic.]    [Footnote 2: The \"double,\" or the vital force.]    Herutataf then held out his hands to the sage and helped him to rise  from the bed, and he went with him to the river bank, Teta leaning on  his arm. When they arrived there Teta asked for a boat wherein his  children and his books might be placed, and the prince put at his  disposal two boats, with crews complete; Teta himself, however, was  accommodated in the prince's boat and sailed with him. When they came to  the palace, Prince Herutataf went into the presence of the king to  announce their arrival, and said to him, \"O king my lord, I have brought  Teta\"; and His Majesty replied, \"Bring him in quickly.\" Then the king  went out into the large hall of his palace, and Teta was led into the  presence. His Majesty said, \"How is it, Teta, that I have never seen  thee?\" And Teta answered, \"Only the man who is summoned to the presence  comes; so soon as the king summoned me I came.\" His Majesty asked him,  saying, \"Is it indeed true, as is asserted, that thou knowest how to  rejoin to its body the head which hath been cut off?\" Teta answered,  \"Most assuredly do I know how to do this, O king my lord.\" His Majesty  said, \"Let them bring in from the prison a prisoner, so that his  death-sentence may be carried out.\" Then Teta said, \"Let them not bring  a man, O king my lord. Perhaps it may be ordered that the head shall be  cut off some other living creature.\" So a goose was brought to him, and  he cut off its head, and laid the body of the goose on the west side of  the hall, and its head on the east side. Then Teta recited certain  magical spells, and the goose stood up and waddled towards its head, and  its head moved towards its body. When the body and the head came close  together, the head leaped on to the body, and the goose stood up on its  legs and cackled.    Then a goose of another kind called _khetaa_ was brought to Teta, and he  did with it as he had done with the other goose. His Majesty next caused  an ox to be taken to Teta, and when he had cut off its head, and recited  magical spells over the head and the body, the head rejoined itself to  the body, and the ox stood up on its feet. A lion was next brought to  Teta, and when he had recited spells over it, the lion went behind him,  and followed him [like a dog], and the rope with which he had been tied  up trailed on the ground behind the animal.    King Khufu then said to Teta, \"Is it true what they say that thou  knowest the numbers of the Apet chambers (?) of the shrine (?) of  Thoth?\" Teta replied, \"No. I do not know their number, O king my lord,  but I do know the place where they are to be found.\" His Majesty asked,  \"Where is that?\" Teta replied, \"There is a box made of flint in a house  called Sapti in Heliopolis.\" The king asked, \"Who will bring me this  box?\" Teta replied, \"Behold, O king my lord, I shall not bring the box  to thee.\" His Majesty asked, \"Who then shall bring it to me?\" Teta  answered, \"The oldest of the three children of Rut-tetet shall bring it  unto thee.\" His Majesty said, \"It is my will that thou shalt tell me who  this Rut-tetet is.\" Teta answered, \"This Rut-tetet is the wife of a  priest of Ra of Sakhabu,[1] who is about to give birth to three children  of Ra. He told her that these children should attain to the highest  dignities in the whole country, and that the oldest of them should  become high priest[2] of Heliopolis.\" On hearing these words the heart  of the king became sad; and Teta said, \"Wherefore art thou so sad, O  king my lord? Is it because of the three children? I say unto thee,  Verily thy son, verily his son, verily one of them.\" His Majesty asked,  \"When will these three children be born?\" Teta answered, \"Rut-tetet will  give them birth on the fifteenth day of the first month of Pert.\"[3] The  king then made a remark the exact meaning of which it is difficult to  follow, but from one part of it it is clear that he expressed his  determination to go and visit the temple of Ra of Sakhabu, which seems  to have been situated on or near the great canal of the Letopolite  nome. In reply Teta declared that he would take care that the water in  the canal should be 4 cubits (about 6 feet) deep, _i.e._ that the water  should be deep enough for the royal barge to sail on the canal without  difficulty. The king then returned to his palace and gave orders that  Teta should have lodgings given him in the house of Prince Herutataf,  that he should live with him, and that he should be provided with one  thousand bread-cakes, one hundred pots of beer, one ox, and one hundred  bundles of vegetables. And all that the king commanded concerning Teta  was done.    [Footnote 1: A town which seems to have been situated in the second nome  or \"county\" of Lower Egypt; the Greeks called the nome Letopolites.]    [Footnote 2: His official title was \"Ur-mau.\"]    [Footnote 3: The season Pert = November 15 - March 15.]                 THE STORY OF RUT-TETET AND THE THREE SONS OF RA    The last section of the Westcar Papyrus deals with the birth of the  three sons of Ra, who have been mentioned above. When the day drew nigh  in which the three sons were to be born, Ra, the Sun-god, ordered the  four goddesses, Isis, Nephthys,[1] Meskhenet,[2] and Heqet,[3] and the  god Khnemu,[4] to go and superintend the birth of the three children, so  that when they grew up, and were exercising the functions of rule  throughout all Egypt, they should build temples to them, and furnish the  altars in them with offerings of meat and drink in abundance. Then the  four goddesses changed themselves into the forms of dancing women, and  went to the house wherein the lady Rut-tetet lay ill, and finding her  husband, the priest of Ra, who was called Rauser, outside, they clashed  their cymbals together, and rattled their sistra, and tried to make him  merry. When Rauser objected to this and told them that his wife lay ill  inside the house, they replied, \"Let us see her, for we know how to  help her\"; so he said to them and to Khnemu who was with them, \"Enter  in,\" and they did so, and they went to the room wherein Rut-tetet lay.  Isis, Nephthys, and Heqet assisted in bringing the three boys into the  world. Meskhenet prophesied for each of them sovereignty over the land,  and Khnemu bestowed health upon their bodies. After the birth of the  three boys, the four goddesses and Khnemu went outside the house, and  told Rauser to rejoice because his wife Rut-tetet had given him three  children. Rauser said, \"My Ladies, what can I do for you in return for  this?\" Having apparently nothing else to give them, he begged them to  have barley brought from his granary, so that they might take it away as  a gift to their own granaries; they agreed, and the god Khnemu brought  the barley. So the goddesses set out to go to the place whence they had  come.    [Footnote 1: Isis and Nephthys were the daughters of Keb and Nut, and  sisters of Osiris and Set; the former was the mother of Horus, and the  latter of Anubis.]    [Footnote 2: A goddess who presided over the birth of children.]    [Footnote 3: A very ancient Frog-goddess, who was associated with  generation and birth.]    [Footnote 4: A god who assisted at the creation of the world, and who  fashioned the bodies of men and women.]    When they had arrived there Isis said to her companions: \"How is it that  we who went to Rut-tetet [by the command of Ra] have worked no wonder  for the children which we could have announced to their father, who  allowed us to depart [without begging a boon]?\" So they made divine  crowns such as belonged to the Lord (_i.e._ King), life, strength,  health [be to him!], and they hid them in the barley. Then they sent  rain and storm through the heavens, and they went back to the house of  Rauser, apparently carrying the barley with them, and said to him, \"Let  the barley abide in a sealed room until we dance our way back to the  north.\" So they put the barley in a sealed room. After Rut-tetet had  kept herself secluded for fourteen days, she said to one of her  handmaidens, \"Is the house all ready?\" and the handmaiden told her that  it was provided with everything except jars of barley drink, which had  not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15950"],[0,"Wilderness Ways (#8)"],[1,"den.    In a moment he came out, licking his chops greedily. Inside, the young  martens lay just as they had been left by the mother; only they began  to grow very cold. Kagax ran to the great spruce, along a branch into  another tree; then to the ground by a dizzy jump. There he ran swiftly  for a good half hour in a long diagonal down towards the lake,  crisscrossing his trail here and there as he ran.    Once more his night's hunting began, with greater zeal than before. He  was hungry now; his nose grew keen as a brier for every trail. A faint  smell stopped him, so faint that the keenest-nosed dog or fox would  have passed without turning, the smell of a brooding partridge on her  eggs. There she was, among the roots of a pine, sitting close and  blending perfectly with the roots and the brown needles. Kagax moved  like a shadow; his nose found the bird; before she could spring he was  on her back, and his teeth had done their evil work. Once more he  tasted the fresh brains with keen relish. He broke all the eggs, so  that none else might profit by his hunting, and went on again.    On some moist ground, under a hemlock, he came upon the fresh trail of  a wandering hare--no simple, unsuspecting mother, coming back to her  babies, but a big, strong, suspicious fellow, who knew how to make a  run for his life. Kagax was still fresh and eager; here was game that  would stretch his muscles. The red lust of killing flamed into his  eyes as he jumped away on the trail.    Soon, by the long distances between tracks, he knew that the hare was  startled. The scent was fresher now, so fresh that he could follow it  in the air, without putting his nose to the ground.    Suddenly a great commotion sounded among the bushes just ahead, where  a moment before all was still. The hare had been lying there, watching  his back track to see what was following. When he saw the red eyes of  Kagax, he darted away wildly. A few hundred yards, and the foolish  hare, who could run far faster than his pursuer, dropped in the bushes  again to watch and see if the weasel was still after him.    Kagax was following, swiftly, silently. Again the hare bounded away,  only to stop and scare himself into fits by watching his own trail  till the red eyes of the weasel blazed into view. So it went on for a  half hour, through brush and brake and swamp, till the hare had lost  all his wits and began to run wildly in small circles. Then Kagax  turned, ran the back track a little way, and crouched flat on the  ground.    In a moment the hare came tearing along on his own trail--straight  towards the yellow-brown ball under a fern tip. Kagax waited till he  was almost run over; then he sprang up and screeched. That ended the  chase. The hare just dropped on his fore paws. Kagax jumped for his  head; his teeth met; the hunger began to gnaw, and he drank his fill  greedily.    For a time the madness of the chase seemed to be in the blood he  drank. Keener than ever to kill, he darted away on a fresh trail. But  soon his feast began to tell; his feet grew heavy. Angry at himself,  he lay down to sleep their weight away.    Far behind him, under the pine by the partridge's nest, a long dark  shadow seemed to glide over the ground. A pointed nose touched the  leaves here and there; over, the nose a pair of fierce little eyes  glowed deep red as Kagax's own. So the shadow came to the partridge's  nest, passed over it, minding not the scent of broken eggs nor of the  dead bird, but only the scent of the weasel, and vanished into the  underbrush on the trail.    Kagax woke with a start and ran on. A big bullfrog croaked down on the  shore. Kagax stalked and killed him, leaving his carcass untouched  among the lily pads. A dead pine in a thicket attracted his suspicion.  He climbed it swiftly, found a fresh round hole, and tumbled in upon a  mother bird and a family of young woodpeckers. He killed them all,  tasting the brains again, and hunted the tree over for the father  bird, the great black logcock that makes the wilderness ring with his  tattoo. But the logcock heard claws on the bark and flew to another  tree, making a great commotion in the darkness as he blundered along,  but not knowing what it was that had startled him.    So the night wore on, with Kagax killing in every thicket, yet never  satisfied with killing. He thought longingly of the hard winter, when  game was scarce, and he had made his way out over the snow to the  settlement, and lived among the chicken coops. \"Twenty big hens in one  roost--that was killing,\" snarled Kagax savagely, as he strangled two  young herons in their nest, while the mother bird went on with her  frogging, not ten yards away among the lily pads, and never heard a  rustle.    Toward morning he turned homeward, making his way back in a circle  along the top of the ridge where his den was, and killing as he went.  He had tasted too much; his feet grew heavier than they had ever been  before. He thought angrily that he would have to sleep another whole  day. And to sleep a whole day, while the wilderness was just beginning  to swarm with life, filled Kagax with snarling rage.    A mother hare darted away from her form as the weasel's wicked eyes  looked in upon her. Kagax killed the little ones and had started after  the mother, when a shiver passed over him and he turned back to  listen. He had been moving more slowly of late; several times he had  looked behind him with the feeling that he was followed. He stole back  to the hare's form and lay hidden, watching his back track. He  shivered again. \"If it were not stronger than I, it would not follow  my trail,\" thought Kagax. The fear of a hunted thing came upon him. He  remembered the marten's den, the strangled young ones, the two trails  that left the leaning tree. \"They must have turned back long ago,\"  thought Kagax, and darted away. His back was cold now, cold as ice.    But his feet grew very heavy ere he reached his den. A faint light  began to show over the mountain across the lake. Killooleet, the  white-throated sparrow, saw it, and his clear morning song tinkled  out of the dark underbrush. Kagax's eyes glowed red again; he stole  toward the sound for a last kill. Young sparrows' brains are a dainty  dish; he would eat his fill, since he must sleep all day. He found the  nest; he had placed his fore paws against the tree that held it, when  he dropped suddenly; the shivers began to course all over him. Just  below, from a stub in a dark thicket, a deep _Whooo-hoo-hoo!_ rolled  out over the startled woods.    It was Kookooskoos, the great horned owl, who generally hunts only in  the evening twilight, but who, with growing young ones to feed,  sometimes uses the morning twilight as well. Kagax lay still as a  stone. Over him the sparrows, knowing the danger, crouched low in  their nest, not daring to move a claw lest the owl should hear.    Behind him the same shadow that had passed over the partridge's nest  looked into the hare's form with fierce red eyes. It followed Kagax's  trail over that of the mother hare, turned back, sniffed the earth,  and came hurrying silently along the ridge.    [Illustration: Kookooskoos]    Kagax crept stealthily out of the thicket. He had an awful fear now of  his feet; for, heavy with the blood he had eaten, they would rustle  the leaves, or scratch on the stones, that all night long they had  glided over in silence. He was near his den now. He could see the old  pine that lightning had blasted, towering against the sky over the  dark spruces.    Again the deep _Whooo-hoo-hoo_! rolled over the hillside. To Kagax,  who gloats over his killing except when he is afraid, it became an  awful accusation. \"Who has killed where he cannot eat? who strangled a  brooding bird? who murdered his own kin?\" came thundering through the  woods. Kagax darted for his den. His hind feet struck a rotten twig  that they should have cleared; it broke with a sharp snap. In an  instant a huge shadow swept down from the stub and hovered over the  sound. Two fierce yellow eyes looked in upon Kagax, crouching and  trying to hide under a fir tip.    Kagax whirled when the eyes found him and two sets of strong curved  claws dropped down from the shadow. With a savage snarl he sprang up,  and his teeth met; but no blood followed the bite, only a flutter of  soft brown feathers. Then one set of sharp claws gripped his head;  another set met deep in his back. Kagax was jerked swiftly into the  air, and his evil doing was ended forever.    There was a faint rustle in the thicket as the shadow of Kookooskoos  swept away to his nest. The long lithe form of a pine marten glided  straight to the fir tip, where Kagax had been a moment before. His  movements were quick, nervous, silent; his eyes showed like two drops  of blood over his twitching nostrils. He circled swiftly about the end  of the lost trail. His nose touched a brown feather, another, and he  glided back to the fir tip. A drop of blood was soaking slowly into a  dead leaf. The marten thrust his nose into it. One long sniff, while  his eyes blazed; then he raised his head, cried out once savagely, and  glided away on the back track.          IV. KOOKOOSKOOS, WHO CATCHES THE WRONG RAT.    [Illustration: Kookooskoos]      Kookooskoos is the big brown owl, the _Bubo Virginianus_, or Great  Horned Owl of the books. But his Indian name is best. Almost any night  in autumn, if you leave the town and go out towards the big woods, you  can hear him calling it, _Koo-koo-skoos, koooo, kooo_, down in the  swamp.    Kookooskoos is always catching the wrong rat. The reason is that he is  a great hunter, and thinks that every furry thing which moves must be  game; and so he is like the fool sportsman who shoots at a sound, or a  motion in the bushes, before finding out what makes it. Sometimes the  rat turns out to be a skunk, or a weasel; sometimes your pet cat; and,  once in a lifetime, it is"]]]
