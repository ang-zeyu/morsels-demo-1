The Manyuema country is all surpassingly beautiful. Palms crown the  highest heights of the mountains, and their gracefully bended fronds  wave beautifully in the wind; and the forests, usually about five miles  broad, between groups of villages, are indescribable. Climbers of cable  size in great numbers are hung among the gigantic trees, many unknown  wild fruits abound, some the size of a child's head, and strange birds  and monkeys are everywhere. The soil is excessively rich, and the  people, although isolated by old feuds that are never settled,  cultivate largely. They have selected a kind of maize that bends its  fruit-stalk round into a hook, and hedges some eighteen feet high are  made by inserting poles, which sprout like Robinson Crusoe's hedge, and  never decay. Lines of climbing plants are tied so as to go along from  pole to pole, and the maize cobs are suspended to these by their own  hooked fruit-stalk. As the corn cob is forming, the hook is turned  round, so that the fruit-leaves of it hang down and form a thatch for  the grain beneath, or inside it. This upright granary forms a  solid-looking, wall round the villages, and the people are not stingy,  but take down maize and hand it to the men freely.    The women are very naked. They bring loads of provisions to sell,  through the rain, and are eager traders for beads. Plantains, cassava,  and maize, are the chief food. The first rains had now begun, and the  white ants took the hint to swarm and colonize.    _6th, 7th, and 8th November, 1869._--We came to many large villages, and  were variously treated; one headman presented me with a parrot, and on  my declining it, gave it to one of my people; some ordered us off, but  were coaxed to allow us to remain over night. They have no restraint;  some came and pushed off the door of my hut with a stick while I was  resting, as we should do with a wild-beast cage.    Though reasonably willing to gratify curiosity, it becomes tiresome to  be the victim of unlimited staring by the ugly, as well as by the  good-looking. I can bear the women, but ugly males are uninteresting,  and it is as much as I can stand when a crowd will follow me wherever I  move. They have heard of Dugumbe Hassani's deeds, and are evidently  suspicious of our intentions: they say, \"If you have food at home, why  come so far and spend your beads to buy it here?\" If it is replied, on  the strength of some of Mohamad's people being present, \"We want to buy  ivory too;\" not knowing its value they think that this is a mere  subterfuge to plunder them. Much palm-wine to-day at different parts  made them incapable of reasoning further; they seemed inclined to fight,  but after a great deal of talk we departed without collision.    _9th November, 1869._--We came to villages where all were civil, but  afterwards arrived where there were other palm-trees and palm-toddy, and  people low and disagreeable in consequence. The mountains all around are  grand, and tree-covered. I saw a man with two great great toes: the  double toe is usually a little one.    _11th November, 1869._--We had heard that the Manyuema were eager to buy  slaves, but that meant females only to make wives of them: they prefer  goats to men. Mohamad had bought slaves in Lunda in order to get ivory  from these Manyuema, but inquiry here and elsewhere brought it out  plainly that they would rather let the ivory lie unused or rot than  invest in male slaves, who are generally criminals--at least in Lunda. I  advised my friend to desist from buying slaves who would all \"eat off  their own heads,\" but he knew better than to buy copper, and on our  return he acknowledged that I was right.    _15th November, 1869._--We came into a country where Dugumbe's slaves  had maltreated the people greatly, and they looked on us as of the same  tribe, and we had much trouble in consequence. The country is swarming  with villages. Hassani of Dugumbe got the chief into debt, and then  robbed him of ten men and ten goats to clear off the debt: The Dutch did  the same in the south of Africa.    _17th November, 1869._--Copious rains brought us to a halt at Muana  Balange's, on the banks of the Luamo River. Moerekurambo had died  lately, and his substitute took seven goats to the chiefs on the other  side in order to induce them to come in a strong party and attack us for  Hassani's affair.    _20th to 25th November, 1869._--We were now only about ten miles from  the confluence of the Luamo and Lualaba, but all the people had been  plundered, and some killed by the slaves of Dugumbe. The Luamo is here  some 200 yards broad and deep; the chiefs everywhere were begged to  refuse us a passage. The women were particularly outspoken in asserting  our identity with the cruel strangers, and when one lady was asked in  the midst of her vociferation just to look if I were of the same colour  with Dugumbe, she replied with a bitter little laugh, \"Then you must be  his father!\"    It was of no use to try to buy a canoe, for all were our enemies. It was  now the rainy season, and I had to move with great caution. The worst  our enemies did, after trying to get up a war in vain, was to collect as  we went by in force fully armed with their large spears and huge wooden  shields, and show us out of their districts. All are kind except those  who have been abused by the Arab slaves. While waiting at Luamo a man,  whom we sent over to buy food, got into a panic and fled he knew not  whither; all concluded that he had been murdered, but some Manyuema whom  we had never seen found him, fed him, and brought him home unscathed: I  was very glad that no collision had taken place. We returned to Bambarre  19th December, 1869.    _20th December, 1869._--While we were away a large horde of Ujijians  came to Bambarre, all eager to reach the cheap ivory, of which a rumour  had spread far and wide; they numbered 500 guns, and invited Mohamad to  go with them, but he preferred waiting for my return from the west. We  now resolved to go due north; he to buy ivory, and I to reach another  part of the Lualaba and buy a canoe.    Wherever the dense primeval forest has been cleared off by man, gigantic  grasses usurp the clearances. None of the sylvan vegetation can stand  the annual grass-burnings except a species of Bauhinia, and occasionally  a large tree which sends out new wood below the burned places. The  parrots build thereon, and the men make a stair up 150 feet by tying  climbing plants (called Binayoba) around, at about four feet distance,  as steps: near the confluence of the Luamo, men build huts on this same  species of tree for safety against the arrows of their enemies.    _21st December, 1869._--The strong thick grass of the clearances dries  down to the roots at the surface of the soil, and fire does it no harm.  Though a few of the great old burly giants brave the fires, none of the  climbers do: they disappear, but the plants themselves are brought out  of the forests and ranged along the plantations like wire fences to keep  wild beasts off; the poles of these vegetable wire hedges often take  root, as also those in stages for maize.    _22nd, 23rd, and 24th December, 1869._--Mohamad presented a goat to be  eaten on our Christmas. I got large copper bracelets made of my copper  by Manyuema smiths, for they are considered very valuable, and have  driven iron bracelets quite out of fashion.    _25th December, 1869._--We start immediately after Christmas: I must try  with all my might to finish my exploration before next Christmas.    _26th December, 1869._--I get fever severely, and was down all day, but  we march, as I have always found that moving is the best remedy for  fever: I have, however, no medicine whatever. We passed over the neck of  Mount Kinyima, north-west of Moenekuss, through very slippery forest,  and encamped on the banks of the Lulwa Rivulet.    _28th December, 1869._--Away to Monangoi's village, near the Luamo  River, here 150 or more yards wide and deep. A man passed us, bearing a  human finger wrapped in a leaf; it was to be used as a charm, and  belonged to a man killed in revenge: the Arabs all took this as clear  evidence of cannibalism: I hesitated, however, to believe it.    _29th, 30th, and 31st December, 1869._--Heavy rains. The Luamo is called  the Luasse above this. We crossed in canoes.    _1st January, 1870._--May the Almighty help me to finish, the work in  hand, and retire through the Basango before the year is out. Thanks for  all last year's loving kindness.    Our course was due north, with the Luasse flowing in a gently undulating  green country on our right, and rounded mountains in Mbongo's country on  our left.    _2nd January, 1870._--Rested a day at Mbongo's, as the people were  honest.    _3rd January, 1870._--Reached a village at the edge of a great forest,  where the people were excited and uproarious, but not ill-bred, they ran  alongside the path with us shouting and making energetic remarks to each  other about us. A newly-married couple stood in a village where we  stopped to inquire the way, with arms around each other very lovingly,  and no one joked or poked fun at them. We marched five hours through  forest and crossed three rivulets and much stagnant water which the sun  by the few rays he darts in cannot evaporate. We passed several huge  traps for elephants: they are constructed thus--a log of heavy wood,  about 20 feet long, has a hole at one end for a climbing plant to pass  through and suspend it, at the lower end a mortice is cut out of the  side, and a wooden lance about 2 inches broad by 1-1/2 thick, and about  4 feet long, is inserted firmly in the mortice; a latch down on the  ground, when touched by the animal's foot, lets the beam run down on to  his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1703"],[0,"Dead Men Tell No Tales (#8)"],[1,"my duty to the public, but I certainly did no more. My  reticence was rebuked in the papers that made the most of me, but would  fain have made more. And yet I do not think that I was anything but  docile with those who had a manifest right to question me; to the  owners, and to other interested persons, with whom I was confronted on  one pretext or another, I told my tale as fully and as freely as I have  told it here, though each telling hurt more than the last. That was  necessary and unavoidable; it was the private intrusions which I  resented with all the spleen the sea had left me in exchange for the  qualities it had taken away.    Relatives I had as few as misanthropist could desire; but from  self-congratulation on the fact, on first landing, I soon came to keen  regret. They at least would have sheltered me from spies and busybodies;  they at least would have secured the peace and privacy of one who was  no hero in fact or spirit, whose noblest deed was a piece of self  preservation which he wished undone with all his heart.    Self-consciousness no doubt multiplied my flattering assailants. I  have said that my nerves were shattered. I may have imagined much and  exaggerated the rest. Yet what truth there was in my suspicions you  shall duly see. I felt sure that I was followed in the street, and my  every movement dogged by those to whom I would not condescend to turn  and look. Meanwhile, I had not the courage to go near my club, and  the Temple was a place where I was accosted in every court, effusively  congratulated on the marvellous preservation of my stale spoilt life,  and invited right and left to spin my yarn over a quiet pipe! Well,  perhaps such invitations were not so common as they have grown in my  memory; nor must you confuse my then feelings on all these matters with  those which I entertain as I write. I have grown older, and, I hope,  something kindlier and wiser since then. Yet to this day I cannot blame  myself for abandoning my chambers and avoiding my club.    For a temporary asylum I pitched upon a small, quiet, empty, private  hotel which I knew of in Charterhouse Square. Instantly the room next  mine became occupied.    All the first night I imagined I heard voices talking about me in that  room next door. It was becoming a disease with me. Either I was being  dogged, watched, followed, day and night, indoors and out, or I was the  victim of a very ominous hallucination. That night I never closed an eye  nor lowered my light. In the morning I took a four-wheel cab and  drove straight to Harley Street; and, upon my soul, as I stood on the  specialist's door-step, I could have sworn I saw the occupant of the  room next mine dash by me in a hansom!    \"Ah!\" said the specialist; \"so you cannot sleep; you hear voices;  you fancy you are being followed in the street. You don't think these  fancies spring entirely from the imagination? Not entirely--just so. And  you keep looking behind you, as though somebody were at your elbow; and  you prefer to sit with your back close to the wall. Just so--just so.  Distressing symptoms, to be sure, but--but hardly to be wondered at in a  man who has come through your nervous strain.\" A keen professional light  glittered in his eyes. \"And almost commonplace,\" he added, smiling,  \"compared with the hallucinations you must have suffered from on that  hen-coop! Ah, my dear sir, the psychological interest of your case is  very great!\"    \"It may be,\" said I, brusquely. \"But I come to you to get that hen-coop  out of my head, not to be reminded of it. Everybody asks me about the  damned thing, and you follow everybody else. I wish it and I were at the  bottom of the sea together!\"    This speech had the effect of really interesting the doctor in my  present condition, which was indeed one of chronic irritation and  extreme excitability, alternating with fits of the very blackest  despair. Instead of offending my gentleman I had put him on his mettle,  and for half an hour he honored me with the most exhaustive inquisition  ever elicited from a medical man. His panacea was somewhat in the nature  of an anti-climax, but at least it had the merits of simplicity and  of common sense. A change of air--perfect quiet--say a cottage in the  country--not too near the sea. And he shook my hand kindly when I left.    \"Keep up your heart, my dear sir,\" said he. \"Keep up your courage and  your heart.\"    \"My heart!\" I cried. \"It's at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.\"    He was the first to whom I had said as much. He was a stranger. What did  it matter? And, oh, it was so true--so true.    Every day and all day I was thinking of my love; every hour and all  hours she was before me with her sunny hair and young, young face. Her  wistful eyes were gazing into mine continually. Their wistfulness I  had never realized at the time; but now I did; and I saw it for what it  seemed always to have been, the soft, sad, yearning look of one fated  to die young. So young--so young! And I might live to be an old man,  mourning her.    That I should never love again I knew full well. This time there was no  mistake. I have implied, I believe, that it was for another woman I fled  originally to the diggings. Well, that one was still unmarried, and when  the papers were full of me she wrote me a letter which I now believe to  have been merely kind. At the time I was all uncharitableness; but words  of mine would fail to tell you how cold this letter left me; it was as a  candle lighted in the full blaze of the sun.    With all my bitterness, however, you must not suppose that I had quite  lost the feelings which had inspired me at sunset on the lonely ocean,  while my mind still held good. I had been too near my Maker ever to lose  those feelings altogether. They were with me in the better moments of  these my worst days. I trusted His wisdom still. There was a reason for  everything; there were reasons for all this. I alone had been saved out  of all those souls who sailed from Melbourne in the Lady Jermyn. Why  should I have been the favored one; I with my broken heart and now  lonely life? Some great inscrutable reason there must be; at my worst  I did not deny that. But neither did I puzzle my sick brain with the  reason. I just waited for it to be revealed to me, if it were God's will  ever to reveal it. And that I conceive to be the one spirit in which a  man may contemplate, with equal sanity and reverence, the mysteries and  the miseries of his life.          CHAPTER VII. I FIND A FRIEND        The night after I consulted the specialist I was quite determined to  sleep. I had laid in a bundle of the daily papers. No country cottage  was advertised to let but I knew of it by evening, and about all the  likely ones I had already written. The scheme occupied my thoughts.  Trout-fishing was a desideratum. I would take my rod and plenty of  books, would live simply and frugally, and it should make a new man of  me by Christmas. It was now October. I went to sleep thinking of autumn  tints against an autumn sunset. It must have been very early, certainly  not later than ten o'clock; the previous night I had not slept at all.    Now, this private hotel of mine was a very old fashioned house, dark and  dingy all day long, with heavy old chandeliers and black old oak, and  dead flowers in broken flower-pots surrounding a grimy grass-plot in the  rear. On this latter my bedroom window looked; and never am I likely to  forget the vile music of the cats throughout my first long wakeful night  there. The second night they actually woke me; doubtless they had been  busy long enough, but it was all of a sudden that I heard them, and lay  listening for more, wide awake in an instant. My window had been very  softly opened, and the draught fanned my forehead as I held my breath.    A faint light glimmered through a ground-glass pane over the door; and  was dimly reflected by the toilet mirror, in its usual place against the  window. This mirror I saw moved, and next moment I had bounded from bed.    The mirror fell with a horrid clatter: the toilet-table followed it with  a worse: the thief had gone as he had come ere my toes halted aching  amid the debris.    A useless little balcony--stone slab and iron railing--jutted out from  my window. I thought I saw a hand on the railing, another on the slab,  then both together on the lower level for one instant before they  disappeared. There was a dull yet springy thud on the grass below. Then  no more noise but the distant thunder of the traffic, and the one that  woke me, until the window next mine was thrown up.    \"What the devil's up?\"    The voice was rich, cheery, light-hearted, agreeable; all that my own  was not as I answered \"Nothing!\" for this was not the first time my  next-door neighbor had tried to scrape acquaintance with me.    \"But surely, sir, I heard the very dickens of a row?\"    \"You may have done.\"    \"I was afraid some one had broken into your room!\"    \"As a matter of fact,\" said I, put to shame by the undiminished  good-humor of my neighbor, \"some one did; but he's gone now, so let him  be.\"    \"Gone? Not he! He's getting over that wall. After him--after him!\" And  the head disappeared from the window next mine.    I rushed into the corridor, and was just in time to intercept a  singularly handsome young fellow, at whom I had hardly taken the trouble  to look until now. He was in full evening dress, and his face was  radiant with the spirit of mischief and adventure.    \"For God's sake, sir,\" I whispered, \"let this matter rest. I shall have  to come forward if you persist, and Heaven knows I have been before the  public quite enough!\"    His dark eyes questioned me an instant, then fell as though he would not  disguise that he recollected and understood. I liked him for his good  taste. I liked him for his tacit sympathy, and better still for the  amusing disappointment in his gallant, young face.    \"I "]]]
