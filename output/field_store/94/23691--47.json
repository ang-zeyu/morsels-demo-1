But before Pliny wrote, the bank  had given way, the pentup waters had made for themselves a channel into  the lake now called Birket el Kurun, and the two small pyramids, which  had hitherto been surrounded by water, then stood on dry ground. Thus  was the country slowly going to ruin by the faults of the government,  and ignorance in the foreign rulers. But, on the other hand, the  beautiful temple of Latopolis, which had been begun under the Ptolemies,  was finished in this reign; and bears the name of Claudius with those of  some later emperors on its portico and walls.    In the Egyptian language the word for a year is _Bait_, which is also  the name of a bird. In hieroglyphics this word is spelt by a palm-branch  _Bai_ and the letter T, followed sometimes by a circle as a picture of  the year. Hence arose among a people fond of mystery and allegory a mode  of speaking of the year under the name of a palm-branch or of a bird;  and they formed a fable out of a mere confusion of words. The Greeks,  who were not slow to copy Egyptian mysticism, called this fabulous bird  the _Phoenix_ from their own name for the palm-tree. The end of any long  period of time they called the return of the phonix to earth. The Romans  borrowed the fable, though perhaps without understanding the allegory;  and in the seventh year of this reign, when the emperor celebrated the  secular games at Rome, at the end of the eighth century since the city  was built, it was said that the phoenix had come to Egypt and was thence  brought to Rome. This was in the consulship of Plautius and Vitellius;  and it would seem to be only from mistakes in the name that Pliny  places the event eleven years earlier, in the consulship of Plautius  and Papinius, and that Tacitus places it thirteen years earlier in the  consulship of Fabius and Vitellius. This fable is connected with some  of the remarkable epochs in Egyptian history. The story lost nothing by  travelling to a distance. In Rome it was said that this wonderful bird  was a native of Arabia, where it lived for five hundred years, that on  its death a grub came out of its body which in due time became a perfect  bird; and that the new phonix brought to Egypt the bones of its parent  in the nest of spices in which it had died, and laid them on the altar  in the temple of the sun in Heliopolis. It then returned to Arabia to  live in its turn for five hundred years, and die and give life again  to another as before. The Christians saw in this story a type of the  resurrection; and Clement, Bishop of Rome, quotes it as such in his  Epistle to the Corinthians.    We find the name of Claudius on several of the temples of Upper Egypt,  particularly on that of Apollinopolis Magna, and on the portico of the  great temples of Latopolis, which were being built in this reign.    In the beginning of the reign of Nero, 55 A.D., an Egyptian Jew,  who claimed to be listened to as a prophet, raised the minds of his  countrymen into a ferment of religious zeal by preaching about the  sufferings of their brethren in Judaea; and he was able to get together  a body of men, called in reproach the Sicarii, or _ruffians_, whose  numbers are variously stated at four thousand and thirty thousand,  whom he led out of Egypt to free the holy city from the bondage of the  heathen. But Felix, the Roman governor, led against them the garrison of  Jerusalem, and easily scattered the half-armed rabble. By such acts of  religious zeal on the part of the Jews they were again brought to blows  with the Greeks of Alexandria. The Macedonians, as the latter still  called themselves, had met in public assembly to send an embassy to  Rome, and some Jews who entered the meeting, which as citizens they had  a full right to do, were seized and ill-treated by them as spies. They  would perhaps have even been put to death if a large body of their  countrymen had not run to their rescue. The Jews attacked the assembled  Greeks with stones and lighted torches, and would have burned the  amphitheatre and all that were in it, if the prefect, Tiberius  Alexander, had not sent some of the elders of their own nation to calm  their angry feelings. But, though the mischief was stopped for a time,  it soon broke out again; and the prefect was forced to call out the  garrison of two Roman legions and five thousand Libyans before he  could re-establish peace in the city. The Jews were always the greatest  sufferers in these civil broils; and Josephus says that fifty thousand  of his countrymen were left dead in the streets of Alexandria. But this  number is very improbable, as the prefect was a friend to the Jewish  nation, and as the Roman legions were not withdrawn to the camp till  they had guarded the Jews in carrying away and burying the bodies of  their friends.    It was a natural policy on the part of the emperors to change a prefect  whenever his province was disturbed by rebellion, as we have seen in the  case of Flaccus, who was recalled by Caligula. It was easier to send a  new governor than to inquire into a wrong or to redress a grievance; and  accordingly in the next year C. Balbillus was sent from Rome as prefect  of Egypt. He reached Alexandria on the sixth day after leaving the  Straits of Sicily, which was spoken of as the quickest voyage known. The  Alexandrian ships were better built and better manned than any others,  and, as a greater number of vessels sailed every year between that port  and Puteoli on the coast of Italy than between any other two places, no  voyage was better understood or more quickly performed. They were out of  sight of land for five hundred miles between Syracuse and Cyrene. Hence  we see that the quickest rate of sailing, with a fair wind, was at that  time about one hundred and fifty miles in the twenty-four hours. But  these ships had very little power of bearing up against the wind; and  if it were contrary the voyage became tedious. If the captain on sailing  out of the port of Alexandria found the wind westerly, and was unable to  creep along the African coast to Cyrene, he stood over to the coast of  Asia Minor, in hopes of there finding a more favourable wind. If a storm  arose, he ran into the nearest port, perhaps in Crete, perhaps in Malta,  there to wait the return of fair weather. If winter then came on, he had  to lie by till spring. Thus a vessel laden with Egyptian wheat, leaving  Alexandria in September, after the harvest had been brought down to the  coast, would sometimes spend five months on its voyage from that port to  Puteoli. Such was the case with the ship bearing the children of Jove  as its figurehead, which picked up the Apostle Paul and the historian  Josephus when they had been wrecked together on the island of Malta; and  such perhaps would have been the case with the ship which they before  found on the coast of Lycia, had it been able to reach a safe harbour,  and not been wrecked at Malta.    [Illustration: 056.jpg EGYPTIAN THRESHING MACHINE]    The rocky island of Malta, with the largest and safest harbour in  the Mediterranean, was a natural place for ships to touch at between  Alexandria and Italy. Its population was made up of those races which  had sailed upon its waters first from Carthage and then from Alexandria;  it was a mixture of Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Graeco-Egyptians. To  judge from the skulls turned up in the burial-places, the Egyptians  were the most numerous, and here as elsewhere the Egyptian superstitions  conquered and put down all the other superstitions. While the island was  under the Phoenicians, the coins had the head of the Sicilian goddess  on one side, and on the other the Egyptian trinity of Isis, Osiris, and  Nepthys. When it was under the Greek rule the head on the coins received  an Egyptian head-dress, and became that of the goddess Isis, and on the  other side of the coin was a winged figure of Osiris. It was at  this time governed by a Roman governor. The large temple, built with  barbarian rudeness, and ornamented with the Phoenician palm-branch, was  on somewhat of a Roman plan, with a circular end to every room. But it  was dedicated to the chief god of Egypt, and is even yet called by its  Greek name Hagia Chem, _the temple of Chem_. The little neighbouring  island of Cossyra, between Sicily and Carthage, also shows upon its  coins clear traces of its taste for Egyptian customs.    [Illustration: 057.jpg MALTESE COIN]    The first five years of this reign, the _quinquennium Neronis_, while  the emperor was under the tutorship of the philosopher Seneca, became in  Rome proverbial for good government, and on the coinage we see marks of  Egypt being equally well treated. In the third year we see on a coin the  queen sitting on a throne with the word _agreement_, as if to praise  the young emperor's good feeling in following the advice of his mother  Agrippina. On another the emperor is styled the young good genius, and  he is represented by the sacred basilisk crowned with the double crown  of Egypt. The new prefect, Balbillus, was an Asiatic Greek, and no doubt  received his Roman names of Tiberius Claudius on being made a freedman  of the late emperor. He governed the country mildly and justly; and  the grateful inhabitants declared that under him the Nile was more than  usually bountiful, and that its waters always rose to their just height.  But in the latter part of the reign the Egyptians smarted severely under  that cruel principle of a despotic monarchy that every prefect, every  sub-prefect, and even every deputy tax-gatherer, might be equally  despotic in his own department.    [Illustration: 058.jpg COIN OF COSSYRA]    On a coin of the thirteenth year of the reign of this ruler, we see a  ship with the word _emperor-bearer_, being that in which he then sailed  into Greece, or in which the Alexandrians thought that he would visit  their city. But if they had really hoped for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17332"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 12 (of 12) (#8)"],[1,"letters reproaching him for allowing  Moslems to be oppressed by Christian officials. He found them to be  experienced in financial matters, for, in spite of all decrees, they  had never ceased to hold secretaryships in different states: they were,  moreover, more unscrupulous than born Muhammedans, who always had  more respect for law, custom, and public opinion. Certainly the sultan  considered the ministers in whom he placed great confidence less  dangerous if they were wow-Moslems, since he was their only support,  whereas comrades in religion could always find plenty of support and  might easily betray him.    Nasir died on the 6th of June, 1341, at about fifty-eight years of age,  after a reign of forty-three years. His rule, which did not actually  begin until he mounted the throne for the third time, lasted thirty-two  years. During this period he was absolute ruler in the strongest sense  of the word; every important affair was decided by him alone. The emirs  had to refer all matters to him, and were a constant source of suspicion  and oversight. They might not speak to each other in his presence,  nor visit each other without his consent. The mildest punishment for  breaking such decrees was banishment to Syria. Nasir inspired them with  fear rather than with love and respect, and, as soon as it was known  that his illness was incurable, no one paid any further attention to  him. He died as a pious Moslem and repentant sinner in the presence  of some of his servants. His burial, which took place by night, was  attended by a few emirs, and only one wax candle and one lamp were  carried before the bier. As one of his biographers justly remarks, the  rich sultan, whose dominion had extended from the borders of Abyssinia  to Asia Minor and up the Euphrates as far as Tunis, and the father of  a large family, ended his life like a stranger, was buried like a poor  man, and brought to his grave like a man without wife or child. Nasir  was the last sultan who ruled over the Bahritic Mamluk kingdom with a  firm hand. After his death we read of one insurrection after another,  and the sultans were either deposed or became mere slaves of the emirs.  Abu Bekr, whom Nasir had appointed his successor, did not hold his own  for quite two months, because he maltreated the discontented emirs  and put his favourites in their places. An insurrection, with the Emir  Kausun at its head, was formed against him; he was dethroned and his  six-year-old brother Kujuk was proclaimed sultan in his stead. The  dethroned sultan was banished to Upper Egypt, whither his elder brother  Ahmed should have been brought; Ahmed, however, refused to leave his  fortress of Kerak, and, finding support among the Syrian emirs, he  conspired against Kausun, who was at this moment threatened also with an  insurrection in Cairo. After several bloody battles, Kausun was forced  to yield, and Ahmed was proclaimed sultan (January, 1342). Ahmed,  however, preferred a quiet, peaceful life to the dangerous post  of sultan, and not until he had received the most solemn oaths of  allegiance did he proceed to his capital, where he arrived quite  unexpectedly, so that no festivities had been prepared. After some time,  he had all the Syrian emirs arrested by his Mam-luks, because they tried  to usurp his powers; he then appointed a regent, and himself returned to  Kerak, taking with him everything he had found in the sultan's palace,  and there he remained in spite of the entreaties of the faithful emirs,  and lived simply for his own pleasure.    The natural consequence of all this was Ahmed's deposition in June,  1342. His brother Ismail, a good-hearted youth of seventeen years, sent  troops to Kerak to demand an oath of allegiance from Ahmed, but  they could effect nothing, as the fortress was well fortified and  provisioned, and, moreover, many of the emirs, both in Syria and Egypt,  were still in league with Ahmed. Not until fresh troops had been sent,  and Ahmed himself betrayed, did they succeed in taking the fortress;  and Ahmed was put to death in 1344. Ahmed's death made such a deep  impression upon the weak sultan that he fell into a fit of depression  which gradually increased until he died in August of the following year.    [Illustration: 055.jpg FRIEZE IN MOSQUE OF SULTAN HASAN]    His brother and successor, Shaban, was an utter profligate, cruel,  faithless, avaricious, immoral, and pleasure-loving. Gladiators  played an important part at his court, and he often took part in their  contests. Horse-racing, cock-fights, and such like amusements occupied  him much more than state affairs, and the whole court followed his  example. As long as Shaban did not offend the emirs, he was at liberty  to commit any atrocities he pleased, but, as soon as he seized their  riches and imprisoned and tortured them, his downfall was certain.  Ilbogha, Governor of Damascus, supported by the other Syrian emirs,  sent him a list of his crimes and summoned him to abdicate. Meanwhile an  insurrection had broken out in Cairo, and, although Shaban expressed  his willingness to abdicate, he was murdered by the rebels in September,  1346. His brother Haji met with a similar fate after a reign of fifteen  months, though some accounts affirm that he was not murdered but only  exiled.    Haji was succeeded by his brother Hasan, who was still a minor; the  emirs who ruled in his name competed for the highest posts until  Baibagharus and his brother Menjik carried off the victory. These two  ruled supreme for a time. The so-called \"black death\" was ravaging  Egypt; many families were decimated, and their riches fell to the state.  The disease, which differed from the ordinary pest in the blood-spitting  and internal heat, raged in Europe and Asia, and spread the greatest  consternation even amongst the Moslems, who generally regarded disease  with a certain amount of indifference, as being a divine decree.  According to Arabic sources, the black death had broken out in China and  from there had spread over the Tatar-land of Kipjak; from here it took  its course towards Constantinople, Asia Minor, and Syria on the one  hand, and towards Greece, Italy, Spain, France, and Germany on the  other, and was probably brought to Egypt from Syria. Not only men,  but beasts and even plants were attacked. The ravages were nowhere  so fearful as in Egypt; in the capital alone in a few days as many  as fifteen or twenty thousand people were stricken. As the disease  continued to rage for two years, there was soon a lack of men to plough  the fields and carry on the necessary trades; and to increase the  general distress, incursions were made by the tribes of Turcomans  and Bedouins, who plundered the towns and villages. Scarcely had this  desperate state of affairs begun to improve when court intrigues sprang  up afresh, and only ended with the deposition of the sultan in August,  1351. He was recalled after three years, during which his brother had  reigned, and he was subsequently deposed and put to death in March,  1361. Finally the descendants of Nasir, instead of his sons, began to  rule. First came Muhammed Ibn Haji, who, as soon as he began to show  signs of independence, was declared to be of unsound mind by his chief  emir, Ilbogha; then Shaban, the son of Husain (May, 1363), who was  strangled in March, 1377; and finally Husain's eight-year-old son Ali.  After repeated contests, Berkuk and Berekeh, two Circassian slaves,  placed themselves at the head of the government. Berkuk, however, wished  to be absolute, and soon put his co-regent out of the way (1389). He  contented himself at first with being simply regent, and, even when Ali  died, he declared his six-year-old brother Haji, sultan. The following  year, when he discovered a conspiracy of the Mamluks against him, and  when many of the older emirs were dead, he declared that it was for the  good of the state that no longer a child, but a man capable of directing  internal affairs and leading an army against the enemy, should take over  the government. The assembly, whom he had bribed beforehand, supported  him, and he was appointed sultan in November, 1382.    The external history of Egypt during this time is but scanty. She  suffered several defeats at the hands of the Turcomans in the north of  Syria, lost her supremacy in Mecca through the influence of the princes  of South Arabia, and both Alexandria and several other coast towns were  attacked and plundered by European fleets. This last event occurred  in Shaban's reign in 1365. Peter of Lusignan, King of Cyprus, had, in  league with the Genoese, the Venetians, and Knights of Rhodes, placed  himself at the head of a new Crusade, and since his expedition was a  secret even in Europe,--for he was thought to be advancing against the  Turks,--it was easy for him to take the Egyptians by surprise, and all  the more so because the Governor of Alexandria happened to be absent at  the time. The militia tried in vain to prevent their landing, and the  small garrison held out for but a short time, so that the prosperous and  wealthy town was completely sacked and many prisoners were taken before  the troops arrived from Cairo.    [Illustration: 059.jpg INSIDE THE MOSQUE OF HASSAN]    The Christians living in Egypt suffered from this attack of the King of  Cyprus. They had to find ransom money for the Moslem prisoners and to  provide means for fitting out a new fleet. All negotiations with Cyprus,  Genoa, and Venice were immediately broken off. This event, however, had  the effect of reconciling the Italian traders again with Egypt, and an  embassy came both from Genoa and Venice, expressing regret at what had  happened, with the assurance that the government had had no hint of the  intentions of the King of Cyprus. Genoa also sent back sixty prisoners  who had fallen to them as their share of the Alexandrian booty. As  Egypt's trade would also be at a standstill if"]]]
