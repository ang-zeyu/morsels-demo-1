The next day eight of the brethren  went to the temple lot, and Joseph dedicated that sacred spot.    Shortly after, Joseph with some of the other brethren went to Kirtland.    The Saints were now instructed to buy land in the region around that they  might possess it for an inheritance. At that time Missouri was not thickly  settled. There was much government land which could be bought for one  dollar and twenty-five cents per acre. Sidney Gilbert was appointed an  agent to receive money and purchase land, and Bishop Edward Partridge was  chosen to divide the land among the Saints. The rich were told to divide  with the poor that all might have land.    The Saints were especially warned that they must keep all the commandments  which the Lord gave to them or they would not be allowed to remain and  build up Zion at that time, but they first would have to go through much  tribulation, and be \"scourged from city to city.\" You will see presently  how this prediction was fulfilled.    The first winter the Saints were not very comfortably housed, as they had  arrived too late to raise crops or build good houses. The next spring,  however, many Saints arrived, and they soon had growing fields and gardens.  The Prophet visited them again early in the spring, held meetings, and  greatly encouraged the Saints. In June, 1832, the first paper published by  the Latter-day Saints was begun at Independence. It was called _The Evening  and Morning Star_, and was the only paper in that part of the country.    Thus the Saints prospered; but a time of persecution, long and fierce, was  before them.    Topics.--1. The center place of Zion. 2. Gathering to Missouri.    Questions and Review.--1.

A great many of the old settlers of Jackson county, meaning those who were  there before the Saints, were of a shiftless, ignorant class from the  Southern States. They made but little improvement in their homes, being  content to live in small, log huts, many of them without windows or board  floors. They all believed it right to have negro slaves. They were also  eager to hold public office.    At that time there were also many persons in western Missouri who had fled  from the east on account of crimes which they had committed. Being near the  boundary line of the United States, these persons would need only to cross  the line into Mexico to be safe if an officer should come after them.    You will readily see by this what kind of neighbors the new settlers had.  Of course the Saints could not join with these wicked people in their horse  racing, Sabbath breaking, idleness, drunkenness, and other things which the  Missourians took delight in. Most of the Saints were from the Eastern and  Northern States and did not believe in slavery. They worked hard, and as  the land produced good crops, they were soon prospering, while their idle  neighbors remained in poverty.    All this naturally led the Missourians to hate the \"Mormons,\" and as early  as the spring of 1832 they began to molest them by throwing stones into  their houses, etc. That same fall mobs began to come against the Saints,  burning some of their hay and shooting into their houses.    In April, 1833, the mobbers held a meeting at Independence to discuss plans  whereby they could rid the county of the \"Mormons.\" However, the meeting  broke up in a row. July 20th, they held another meeting which was more  successful. An address was read to the people wherein the Saints were  falsely accused of all manner of wrong doings. It also set forth that no  more \"Mormons\" must settle in Jackson county; that the \"Mormons\" already  there should be given a reasonable time to sell their property and then  remove; that the printing of their paper must cease; that the stores of the  Saints must close up their business as soon as possible; and that the  leading brethren should use their influence to have the Saints comply with  these requests. The meeting agreed to all this and a committee was  appointed to wait on the leaders of the Saints to see what they would do  about it. When the committee called, the brethren asked for time to  consider the matter, but fifteen minutes only were given them. Nothing  could be done in that short time, so the committee went back to the meeting  and reported.    The mob then broke loose, yelling like a band of wild Indians. They went to  the house and printing office of W.W. Phelps, forced Mrs. Phelps and the  children, one of whom was sick, out of the house and threw the furniture  out in the street. They then destroyed the printing press and tore the  office down. Then they went through the town hunting for the leading  brethren. They caught Bishop Edward Partridge and Charles Allen, dragged  them to the public square, stripped most of their clothes off, and then  smeared tar all over their bodies. This ended that day's work, and the  frightened women and children who had fled to the woods came back to their  homes.    The third day after this a mob of five hundred men came into Independence.  They were armed with guns, knives, and whips, and they swore they would  kill or whip all who would not agree to leave. The leading brethren, seeing  that it was no longer of any use to plead or resist, made an agreement with  the mob that they with their families would leave the county by the first  of January, and that they would use their influence in trying to induce the  rest of the Saints to leave, one-half by January 1st, the rest by April  1st, 1834. They were also to use all the means they could to prevent more  of the Saints from settling in the county. The mob for their part agreed  not to persecute the Saints while this was being done.    The mob, however, did not keep this promise, but daily broke into houses  and abused the inmates.    The Saints now appealed to the highest officer of the state, Governor  Dunklin, for protection. He told them that the laws were able to protect  everybody in their rights, and advised the Saints to have those arrested  who threatened them, and have them tried in court for their misdeeds.    This, seemingly, was very good advice, and would have worked all right  under other circumstances; but when it is remembered that the very  officers--the constable who would have to do the arresting, the judge who  would try the cases, and in fact all concerned--were men who were  themselves leaders of the mob, you will see how useless such a course would  be. However, the Saints engaged four lawyers to protect them in the courts.    This made the mobbers more angry than ever, and they made preparation for  further action against the Saints.    \"We will rid Jackson county of the \"Mormons\",\" they said, \"peaceably if we  can, forcibly if we must. If they will not go without, we will whip and  kill the men; we will destroy the children, and abuse their women.\"    The Saints now resolved to defend themselves, and the men gathered in small  bodies, armed with guns.    On the night of October 31, 1833, a mob marched to the Whitmer settlement  of the Saints where they whipped several of the brethren to death, drove  the women and children into the woods, and tore the roofs from about a  dozen houses.    The next night an attack was made upon the Saints living at Independence. A  party of brethren went to the aid of the Saints, and found a mob tearing  down the store of Gilbert, Whitney & Co. The mobbers fled, but the brethren  captured one of them in the act of throwing brick-bats through the window.  They brought him to a justice of the peace to have papers made out for the  mobber's arrest. The justice would not do it, so the man was released.  Three days after, this same mobber had the brethren arrested. It was no  trouble for him to get papers from the same justice. As one of the brethren  remarked at the time, \"Although we could not obtain a warrant against him  for breaking open the store, he had gotten one for us for catching him at  it!\"    Topics.--1. The character of the early Missourians. 2. Mobbers' meetings  in Independence. 3. Work of the mob.    Questions and Review.--1. From what sections did most of the early  settlers of Missouri come? 2. From what section did the Saints come? 3.  What difference of opinion existed between the people of the north and the  people of the south? 4. Why did the Missourians hate the \"Mormons?\" 5. Why  did many outlaws come to Missouri? 6. What did the mobbers want the Saints  to promise? 7. What advice did Governor Dunklin give? 8. Why did the law  not protect the Saints? 9.

In this small history, an account of all that happened in Missouri during  those cruel times can not be given; but enough can be told to show you what  the Saints had to endure in the early days of the Church. If you will but  think of the sufferings the boys and girls must have gone through when the  mobs tore the roofs from their houses, drove them out on the prairies to go  hungry and cold, and killed or whipped their fathers, you may then  appreciate God's blessings to you who live in peace and comfort.    The persecutions, which began in earnest October 31st, 1833,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16545"],[0,"King Alfred of England (#8)"],[1,"  ALFRED'S EARLY YEARS.      Before commencing the narrative of Alfred's administration of the  public affairs of his realm, it is necessary to go back a little, in  order to give some account of the more private occurrences of his  early life. Alfred, like Washington, was distinguished for a very  extraordinary combination of qualities which exhibited itself in his  character, viz., the combination of great military energy and skill  on the one hand, with a very high degree, on the other, of moral and  religious principle, and conscientious devotion to the obligations  of duty. This combination, so rarely found in the distinguished  personages which have figured among mankind, is, in a great measure,  explained and accounted for, in Alfred's case, by the peculiar  circumstances of his early history.    It was his brother Ethelred, as has already been stated, whom Alfred  immediately succeeded. His father's name was Ethelwolf; and it seems  highly probable that the peculiar turn which Alfred's mind seemed to  take in after years, was the consequence, in some considerable degree,  of this parent's situation and character. Ethelwolf was a younger son,  and was brought up in a monastery at Winchester. The monasteries of  those days were the seats both of learning and piety, that is, of such  learning and piety as then prevailed. The ideas of religious faith and  duty which were entertained a thousand years ago were certainly very  different from those which are received now; still, there was  then, mingled with much superstition, a great deal of honest and  conscientious devotion to the principles of Christian duty, and of  sincere and earnest desire to live for the honor of God and  religion, and for the highest and best welfare of mankind. Monastic  establishments existed every where, defended by the sacredness which  invested them from the storms of violence and war which swept over  every thing which the cross did not protect. To these the thoughtful,  the serious, and the intellectual retired, leaving the restless, the  rude, and the turbulent to distract and terrify the earth with their  endless quarrels. Here they studied, they wrote, they read; they  transcribed books, they kept records, they arranged exercises of  devotion, they educated youth, and, in a word, performed, in the  inclosed and secluded retreats in which they sought shelter, those  intellectual functions of civil life which now can all be performed in  open exposure, but which in those days, if there had been no monastic  retreats to shelter them, could not have been performed at all.  For the learning and piety of the present age, whether Catholic or  Protestant, to malign the monasteries of Anglo-Saxon times is for the  oak to traduce the acorn from which it sprung.    Ethelwolf was a younger son, and, consequently, did not expect to  reign. He went to the monastery at Winchester, and took the vows. His  father had no objection to this plan, satisfied with having his oldest  son expect and prepare for the throne. As, however, he advanced toward  manhood, the thought of the probability that he might be called to the  throne in the event of his brother's death led all parties to desire  that he might be released from his monastic vows. They applied,  accordingly, to the pope for a dispensation. The dispensation was  granted, and Ethelwolf became a general in the army. In the end his  brother died, and he became king.    He continued, however, during his reign, to manifest the peaceful,  quiet, and serious character which had led him to enter the monastery,  and which had probably been strengthened and confirmed by the  influences and habits to which he had been accustomed there. He had,  however, a very able, energetic, and warlike minister, who managed his  affairs with great ability and success for a long course of years.  Ethelwolf, in the mean time, leaving public affairs to his minister,  continued to devote himself to the pursuits to which his predilections  inclined him. He visited monasteries; he cultivated learning; he  endowed the Church; he made journeys to Rome. All this time, his  kingdom, which had before almost swallowed up the other kingdoms of  the Heptarchy, became more and more firmly established, until, at  length, the Danes came in, as is described in the last chapter, and  brought the whole land into the most extreme and imminent danger.  The case did not, however, become absolutely desperate until after  Ethelwolf's death, as will be hereafter explained.    Ethelwolf married a lady whose gentle, quiet, and serious character  corresponded with his own. Alfred was the youngest, and, as is often  the case with the youngest, the favorite child. He was kept near to  his father and mother, and closely under their influence, until his  mother died, which event, however, took place when he was quite young.  After this, Ethelwolf sent Alfred to Rome. Rome was still more the  great center then than it is now of religion and learning. There  were schools there, maintained by the various nations of Europe  respectively, for the education of the sons of the nobility. Alfred,  however, did not go for this purpose. It was only to make the journey,  to see the city, to be introduced to the pope, and to be presented, by  means of the fame of the expedition, to the notice of Europe, as the  future sovereign of England; for it was Ethelwolf's intention, at  this time, to pass over his older sons, and make this Benjamin his  successor on the throne.    The journey was made with great pomp and parade. A large train of  nobles and ecclesiastics accompanied the young prince, and a splendid  reception was given to him in the various towns in France which he  passed through on his way. He was but five years old; but his position  and his prospects made him, though so young, a personage of great  distinction. After spending a short time at Rome, he returned again to  England.    Two years after this, Ethelwolf, Alfred's father, determined to go to  Rome himself. His wife had died, his older sons had grown up, and his  own natural aversion to the cares and toils of government seems  to have been increased by the alarms and dangers produced by the  incursions of the Danes, and by his own advancing years. Having  accordingly arranged the affairs of the kingdom by placing his oldest  sons in command, he took the youngest, Alfred, who was now seven years  old, with him, and, crossing the Channel, landed on the Continent, on  his way to Rome.    All the arrangements for this journey were conducted on a scale of  great magnificence and splendor. It is true that it was a rude and  semi-barbarous age, and very little progress had been made in respect  to the peaceful and industrial arts of life; but, in respect to the  arts connected with war, to every thing that related to the march of  armies, the pomp and parade of royal progresses, the caparison of  horses, the armor and military dresses of men, and the parade and  pageantry of military spectacles, a very considerable degree of  advancement had been attained.    King Ethelwolf availed himself of all the resources that he could  command to give eclat to his journey. He had a numerous train of  attendants and followers, and he carried with him a number of rich and  valuable presents for the pope. He was received with great distinction  by King Charles of France, through whose dominions he had to pass on  his way to Italy. Charles had a daughter, Judith, a young girl with  whom Ethelwolf, though now himself quite advanced in life, fell deeply  in love.    Ethelwolf, after a short stay in France, went on to Rome. His arrival  and his visit here attracted great attention. As King of England he  was a personage of very considerable consequence, and then he  came with a large retinue and in magnificent state. His religious  predilections, too, inspired him with a very strong interest in the  ecclesiastical authorities and institutions of Rome, and awakened,  reciprocally, in these authorities, a strong interest in him. He made  costly presents to the pope, some of which were peculiarly splendid.  One was a crown of pure gold, which weighed, it is said, four pounds.  Another was a sword, richly mounted in gold. There were also several  utensils and vessels of Saxon form and construction, some of gold and  others of silver gilt, and also a considerable number of dresses, all  very richly adorned. King Ethelwolf also made a distribution in money  to all the inhabitants of Rome: gold to the nobles and to the clergy,  and silver to the people. How far his munificence on this occasion may  have been exaggerated by the Saxon chroniclers, who, of course, like  other early historians, were fond of magnifying all the exploits, and  swelling, in every way, the fame of the heroes of their stories,  we can not now know. There is no doubt, however, that all the  circumstances of Ethelwolf's visit to the great capital were such as  to attract universal attention to the event, and to make the little  Alfred, on whose account the journey was in a great measure performed,  an object of very general interest and attention.    In fact, there is every reason to believe that the Saxon nations had,  at that time, made such progress in wealth, population, and power as  to afford to such a prince as Ethelwolf the means of making a great  display, if he chose to do so, on such an occasion as that of a royal  progress through France and a visit to the great city of Rome. The  Saxons had been in possession of England, at this time, many hundred  years; and though, during all this period, they had been involved in  various wars, both with one another and with the neighboring nations,  they had been all the time steadily increasing in wealth, and making  constant improvements in all the arts and refinements of life.  Ethelwolf reigned, therefore, over a people of considerable wealth  and power, and he moved across the Continent on"]]]
