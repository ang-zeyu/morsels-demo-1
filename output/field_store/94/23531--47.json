The latter too is developing and changing  atoms at every moment.  And the attraction of these new sets of atoms  depends upon the Law of Affinity--the desires of the man drawing to his  bodily tenement only such particles as are necessary to give them  expression.    For Science shows that thought is dynamic, and the thought-force evolved  by nervous action expanding itself outwardly, must affect the molecular  relations of the physical man.  The inner men, however sublimated their  organism may be, are still composed of actual, not hypothetical,  particles, and are still subject to the law that an \"action\" has a  tendency to repeat itself;  a tendency to set up analogous action in the  grosser \"shell\" they are in contact with, and concealed within.--\"The  Elixir of Life\"    What is it the aspirant of Yog Vidya strives after if not to gain Mukti  by transferring himself gradually from the grosser to the next less  gross body, until all the veils of Maya being successively removed his  Atma becomes one with Paramatma?  Does he suppose that this grand result  can be achieved by a two or four hours' contemplation?  For the  remaining twenty or twenty-two hours that the devotee does not shut  himself up in his room for meditation is the process of the emission of  atoms and their replacement by others stopped?  If not, then how does he  mean to attract all this time only those suited to his end? From the  above remarks it is evident that just as the physical body requires  incessant attention to prevent the entrance of a disease, so also the  inner man requires an unremitting watch, so that no conscious or  unconscious thought may attract atoms unsuited to its progress.  This is  the real meaning of contemplation.  The prime factor in the guidance of  the thought is Will.    Without that, all else is useless.  And, to be efficient for the  purpose, it must be, not only a passing resolution of the moment, a  single fierce desire of short duration, but a settled and continued  strain, as nearly as can be continued and concentrated without one  single moment's remission.    The student would do well to take note of the italicized clause in the  above quotation.  He should also have it indelibly impressed upon his  mind that:    It is no use to fast as long as one requires food.... To get rid of the  inward desire is the essential thing, and to mimic the real thing  without it is barefaced hypocrisy and useless slavery.    Without realizing the significance of this most important fact, any one  who for a moment finds cause of disagreement with any one of his family,  or has his vanity wounded, or for a sentimental flash of the moment, or  for a selfish desire to utilize  the Divine power for gross purposes--at  once rushes into contemplation and dashes himself to pieces on the rock  dividing the known from the unknown.  Wallowing in the mire of  exotericism, he knows not what it is to live in the world and yet be not  of the world;  in other words, to guard self against self is an almost  incomprehensible axiom for the profane.  The Hindu ought to know better  from the life of Janaka, who, although a reigning monarch, was yet  styled Rajarshi and is said to have attained Nirvana. Hearing of his  widespread fame, a few sectarian bigots went to his court to test his  Yoga-power.  As soon as they entered the court-room, the king having  read their thoughts--a power which every chela attains at a certain  stage--gave secret instructions to his officials to have a particular  street in the city lined on both sides by dancing girls singing the must  voluptuous songs.  He then had some gharas (pots) filled with water up  to the brim so that the least shake would be likely to spill their  contents.  The wiseacres, each with a full ghara (pot) on his head, were  ordered to pass along the street, surrounded by soldiers with drawn  swords to be used against them if even so much as a drop of water were  allowed to run over.  The poor fellows having returned to the palace  after successfully passing the test, were asked by the King-Adept what  they had met with in the street they were made to go through.  With  great indignation they replied that the threat of being cut to pieces  had so much worked upon their minds that they thought of nothing but the  water on their heads, and the intensity of their attention did not  permit them to take cognizance of what was going on around them.  Then  Janaka told them that on the same principle they could easily understand  that, although being outwardly engaged in managing the affairs of his  State, he could, at the same time, be an Occultist.  He too, while in  the world, was not of the world.  In other words, his inward aspirations  had been leading him on continually to the goal in which his whole inner  self was concentrated.    Raj Yoga encourages no sham, requires no physical postures.  It has to  deal with the inner man whose sphere lies in the world of thought.  To  have the highest ideal placed before oneself and strive incessantly to  rise up to it, is the only true concentration recognized by Esoteric  Philosophy which deals with the inner world of noumena, not the outer  shell of phenomena.    The first requisite for it is thorough purity of heart.  Well might the  student of Occultism say with Zoroaster, that purity of thought, purity  of word, and purity of deed,--these are the essentials of one who would  rise above the ordinary level and join the \"gods.\"  A cultivation of the  feeling of unselfish philanthropy is the path which has to be traversed  for that purpose.  For it is that alone which will lead to Universal  Love, the realization of which constitutes the progress towards  deliverance from the chains forged by Maya (illusion) around the Ego.  No student will attain this at once, but as our Venerated Mahatma says  in the \"Occult World\":--    The greater the progress towards deliverance, the less this will be the  case, until, to crown all, human and purely individual personal  feelings, blood-ties and friendship, patriotism and race predilection,  will all give way to become blended into one universal feeling, the only  true and holy, the only unselfish and eternal one, Love, an Immense Love  for Humanity as a whole.    In short, the individual is blended with the ALL.    Of course, contemplation, as usually understood, is not without its  minor advantages.  It develops one set of physical faculties as  gymnastics does the muscles.  For the purposes of physical mesmerism it  is good enough;  but it can in no way help the development of the  psychological faculties, as the thoughtful reader will perceive.  At the  same time, even for ordinary purposes, the practice can never be too  well guarded.  If, as some suppose, they have to be entirely passive and  lose themselves in the object before them, they should remember that, by  thus encouraging passivity, they, in fact, allow the development of  mediumistic faculties in themselves.  As was repeatedly stated--the  Adept and the Medium are the two Poles: while the former is intensely  active and thus able to control the elemental forces, the latter is  intensely passive and thus incurs the risk of falling a prey to the  caprice and malice of mischievous embryos of human beings, and the  elementaries.    It will be evident from the above that true meditation consists in the  \"reasoning from the known to the unknown.\"  The \"known\" is the  phenomenal world, cognizable by our five senses.  And all that we see in  this manifested world are the effects, the causes of which are to be  sought after in the noumenal, the unmanifested, the \"unknown world:\"  this is to be accomplished by meditation, i.e., continued attention to  the subject.  Occultism does not depend upon one method, but employs  both the deductive and the inductive.  The student must first learn the  general axioms, which have sufficiently been laid down in the Elixir of  Life and other occult writings.  What the student has first to do is to  comprehend these axioms and, by employing the deductive method, to  proceed from universals to particulars.  He has then to reason from the  \"known to the unknown,\" and see if the inductive method of proceeding  from particulars to universals supports those axioms.  This process  forms the primary stage of true contemplation.  The student must first  grasp the subject intellectually before he can hope to realize his  aspirations. When this is accomplished, then comes the next stage of  meditation, which is \"the inexpressible yearning of the inner man to 'go  out towards the infinite.'\"  Before any such yearning can be properly  directed, the goal must first be determined.  The higher stage, in fact,  consists in practically realizing what the first steps have placed  within one's comprehension.  In short, contemplation, in its true sense,  is to recognize the truth of Eliphas Levi's saying:--    To believe without knowing is weakness;  to believe, because one knows,  is power.    The Elixir of Life not only gives the preliminary steps in the ladder of  contemplation but also tells the reader how to realize the higher  stages.  It traces, by the process of contemplation as it were, the  relation of man, \"the known,\" the manifested, the phenomenon, to \"the  unknown,\" the unmanifested, the noumenon. It shows the student what  ideal to contemplate and how to rise up to it.  It places before him the  nature of the inner capacities of man and how to develop them.  To a  superficial reader, this may, perhaps, appear as the acme of  selfishness.  Reflection will, however, show the contrary to be the  case.  For it teaches the student that to comprehend the noumenal, he  must identify himself with Nature.  Instead of looking upon himself as  an isolated being, he must learn to look upon himself as a part of the  Integral Whole.  For, in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14392"],[0,"George Du Maurier, the Satirist of the Victorians (#8)"],[1," this the very genius of the art  of editing--this and not the wholly fictitious \"what the public wants?\"  Who knows what the public want but the public themselves? It is the  artist who is allowed by his Editor to go his own way, who takes the  public with him. If he has not the same sympathies as the public no  Editorial direction will save the situation, while it will drive perhaps  a fine artist away to another trade.      Section 5    After the appearance of his first drawing in _Punch_, for more than a  year du Maurier's connection with the paper seems to have been  maintained by the execution of initial letters for it. Mr. W.L.  Bradbury, zealous in the preservation of all records that redound to the  glory of _Punch_, has in one or two instances had pulls taken from the  wood blocks upon special paper. These special proofs show all the charm  of wood engraving. In the case of the initial large C, reproduced on  page 91, Mr. Bradbury's specimen shows the beautiful quality which in  our own time Mr. Sturge Moore and Mr. Pissarro are at such pains to  secure in engravings made for love of the art. One only wishes that the  exigencies of book-production would allow us to attempt rivalry with Mr.  Bradbury's specimen in our reproduction. But we see no reason why  specimens of the wood-printing of du Maurier's work should not be on  view in the British Museum. The \"impressions\" in old volumes of _Punch_,  after the wear and tear, the opening and the shutting, and the effect of  time are not an adequate record of du Maurier's skill in accommodating  his art to the methods of reproduction of the period.    Moreover, du Maurier was better in securing an effect of painting than  of pure line work with his pen. It is just this effect which suited the  methods of engraving better than those of \"process\" work. And because it  demanded drawing to a smaller scale, with lines closer together, the  demands of engraving suited the nature of du Maurier's art better than  those of \"process\" work.    When the modern process came in artists enlarged their drawings so as to  secure delicacy of effect from the result of the reduction in printing.  In such a case they really work for the sake of a result upon the  printed page, and there is consequently less value to be attached to the  original drawing. It generally errs on the side of coarseness. And now  that a trade is driven in original drawings, artists are tempted to give  the purchaser as much in the matter of size for his money as he may  want. And, alas, it is true that many picture buyers do buy according to  measurement, or anything else on earth rather than merit.    Du Maurier could add a reason of his own for availing himself of the  opportunity to enlarge his drawings when he could, namely, that of his  weak sight. But it is certainly not among the large drawings that we  should look for the work that places him in the place we wish to claim  for him.    It will well repay the student of du Maurier's art to look into the  illustration for the novel _Wives and_ _Daughters_ reproduced on page  26. In this very highly finished picture the drawing of all the detail  seems done with the greatest pleasure to the artist. It has not the  breadth of style which du Maurier himself could admire in Keene, but the  line work is intensely sympathetic throughout; there is that enjoyment  in the actual touch of pen to paper which was always characteristic of  Keene, which is always special to great art; which, alas, was not always  characteristic of du Maurier. It is like the touch of a sympathetic  musician. Du Maurier, always generous to his contemporaries, in his  lecture upon art, instances the natural skill of Walker by his success  with the difficulties of drawing a tall hat. But Walker himself has  nothing of this kind better to show than the hat in the picture we are  describing.      Section 6    In the early eighties the change was made from drawing on wood to  drawing on paper for _Punch_, the drawing being afterwards photographed  on to the wood. Later, metal was made possible as a substitute for wood,  and this enabled illustrations and letterpress to be printed together.  The modern process of reproduction has introduced its own pleasant  qualities into journalism, and because they are different in effect they  do not rival the effect of wood engraving.    The modern methods reproduce the black lines of a drawing direct. But  the most practised engravers cut out the whites of a drawing with their  graver from between the black lines. This undoubtedly allowed the artist  a closer and less restricted use of line than modern illustration shows  us. If the reader examines du Maurier's illustration for _The Adventures  of Harry Richmond_ on page 106, he will be able to see at a glance how,  by cutting out the whites in the multiplicity of ivy leaves, detailed  drawing has been re-interpreted in the engraving with great economy.    Some of the pleasantness of the effect of lines printed from a woodcut  is due to the fact that they print a more clearly cut line. The line  eaten in by \"process\" when examined under a very strong magnifying glass  proves to be a slightly jagged one. But we should rejoice that the art  of reproduction for journalistic purposes is free of the laborious  method of engraving, and from the sort of work that was put up by  over-tired engravers when they fought their last round to lose, against  the modern invention of picture reproduction.    There is no rivalry in art. All the rivalry is in the business connected  with it. A wood-engraving possesses a charm of its own for those whose  sense of quality is delicate enough for its appreciation. The life of  this art, apart from the purpose of weekly journalism, is safe. The life  of any art is safe while it commands, as wood engraving does, the  production of any particular effect in a way that cannot be rivalled.    According to Mr. Joseph Pennell, the first really important modern  illustrated book in which wood was substituted for metal engraving  appeared in France in 1830, and this authority asserts that in England,  just before the invention of photographing on wood, some of the most  marvellous engravings appeared that have ever been done in the country.  \"It is,\" he writes, \"with the appearance of Frederick Sandys, Rossetti,  Walker, Pinwell, A. Boyd, Houghton, Small, du Maurier, Keene, Crane,  Leighton, Millais, and Tenniel, with the publication of the _Cornhill,  Once a Week, Good Words, The Shilling Magazine_, and such books as  Moxon's _Tennyson_ that the best period of English illustration  begins.\"    \"The incessant output of illustration,\" he continues, \"killed not only  the artists themselves, but the process. In its stead arose a better,  truer method, a more artistic method, which we are even now only  developing.\"    But there is another side to this question. Illustration has lost  something by the uniformity of style which the modern method encourages.  Keene, whose style was supposed to suffer most at the hands of the  engraver, found it more difficult than anyone to accommodate his free  methods to the rules that govern the results of the modern process.    It may be noted that it was about the time of the transition from  working on wood to work on paper that that slavery to the model began,  which, as we have pointed out, has not in the end been without an  unhappy effect in the loss of spontaneity to English Illustration.    [Illustration: Initial Letter from _The Cornhill_]    As for the art of wood engraving itself, we hope it will now have a  future like that which the arts of lithography and etching are enjoying.  Reproduction by process serves commercial and journalistic purposes far  better. The demands of commerce formed for this art, as it once formed  for lithography, a chrysalis in which it perfected itself.  Reproduction by process serves commercial purposes much better than  ever wood-engraving could, but while the commercial demand for it  lasted, as in the case of the arts of lithography and etching, it  continued to improve; like them, let us hope, destined to find beautiful  wings upon its release from the cramping demands of modern printing  machines, in its practice by artists for sheer love of the peculiar  qualities which are its own. It has been said that wood-engravers killed  their own art so far as journalism was concerned by their surrender to  commerciality with its frequent demand for the ready-to-hand rather than  the superior thing. But his surrender was not the fault of the  engravers, but was rendered inevitable by the advent of the middleman,  to whom application was made by the Press for blocks, and whose  employees all engravers were practically forced into becoming, instead  of being able to retain their independence and make their own terms with  the Press.      Section 7    In the British Museum some of the originals of du Maurier's _Punch_  pictures may be seen. On the margins of these are the pencilled  instructions of the Editor as to the scale of the reproduction, and  very often pencil notes from Artist to Editor. This sort of thing--\"If  they have used my page for this week's number, telegraph to me as soon  as you get this and I will have Social ready by 12 to-morrow (that is,  if it be not too late for me.)\" Or what is evidently an invitation to  lunch--\"Monday at 1 for light usual.\" The drawing where this particular  note appears is of three little girls with their dolls. The legend in  the artist's handwriting read as follows:--\"_My papa's house has got a_  conservatory! _My papa's house has got a_ billiard-room! _My papa's  house has got a_ mortgage!!\" This was printed with the much inferior  legend: \"Dolly taking her degrees (of comparison): '_My_ doll's wood!'  _My_ doll's composition!' '_My_ doll's wax!'\"    Some of these British Museum original drawings still retain in pencil  the price du Maurier put upon them for"]]]
