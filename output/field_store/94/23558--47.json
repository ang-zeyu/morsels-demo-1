So taken up with the excitement of the revolting scene were all present,  that the landing and the approach of our friends had not been observed  until Elsie, nearing the edge of the crowd, called out in a voice of  authority, and indignation, \"Stop! not another blow!\"    The crowd parted, showing a middle-aged negress stripped to the waist and  tied to a whipping post, writhing and sobbing with pain and terror, while  a white man stood over her with a horse-whip in his uplifted hand, stayed  in mid-air by the sudden appearance of those in authority over him.    \"How dare you! how _dare_ you!\" cried Elsie, stamping her foot, and  drawing a long, sobbing breath. \"Take her down this instant.\"    \"Mr. Spriggs, what is the meaning of this?\" asked Mr. Dinsmore, in tones  of calm displeasure; \"did I not forbid all cruel punishment on this  estate?\"    \"I've got to make 'em work; I'm bound they shall, and nothing but the  whip'll do it with this lazy wretch,\" muttered Spriggs, dropping his whip  and stepping back a little, while two stalwart fellows obeyed Elsie's  order to take the woman down, a murmur at the same time running from lip  to lip, \"It's Marse Dinsmore, and our young missus.\"    Elsie shuddered and wept at sight of the bleeding back and shoulders.  \"Cover her up quickly, and take her away where she can lie down and rest,\"  she said to the women who were crowding round to greet and welcome  herself. \"I will speak to you all afterwards, I'm glad to be here among  you.\" Then leaning over the sufferer for an instant, with fast-dropping  tears, \"Be comforted,\" she said, in tones of gentle compassion, \"you shall  never have this to endure again.\"    \"Come, daughter, speak to these eager people, and let us go into the  house,\" said Mr. Dinsmore.    \"Yes, papa, in one moment.\"    Drawing herself up to her full height, and flashing one look of scorn and  indignation out of her dark eyes upon the crest-fallen Spriggs, she  addressed him with the air of a queen. \"You, sir, will meet me in the  library at eight o'clock this evening.\"    Turning to the men, \"Dig up that post, and split it into kindling-wood for  the kitchen fire.\"    Her father, while shaking hands with the blacks, speaking a kindly word to  each, regarded her with mingled curiosity and admiration; thoroughly  acquainted with his child as he had believed himself to be, he now saw her  in a new character.    She took his arm, and he felt that she was trembling very much. He  supported her tenderly, while the women flocked about them, eagerly  welcoming her to Viamede; kissing her hand, and declaring with tears in  their eyes, that it was just their \"dear dead young missus come back to  them, like a beautiful white angel.\"    The first who claimed her attention, introduced herself as \"Aunt Phillis  de housekeepah. An' I'se got eberyting ready for you, honey; de beds is  aired, de fires laid in de drawin'-room, an' library, an' sleepin' rooms,  an' de pantry full ob the nicest tings dis chile an' ole Aunt Sally know  how to cook; an' I sent Jack right to de house to start de fires de fust  minute dese ole eyes catch sight ob massa an' young missus, an' knows dey  heyah.\"    \"My dear child, all this is quite too much for you,\" said Mr. Dinsmore,  attempting to draw his daughter away.    \"Just a moment, papa, please,\" she answered in a slightly unsteady voice;  \"let me speak to them all.\" He yielded, but cut short the garrulity of  some who would have liked to mingle reminiscences of her baby-hood with  their rejoicing over her return, telling them they must reserve such  communication for a more suitable time, as their young mistress was faint  and weary, and must have rest.    The appearance of Chloe and her recovered husband upon the scene, now  created a diversion in their favor, and he presently succeeded in leading  Elsie to the house.    A young mulatto girl followed them into the drawing-room, where a bright  wood-fire was blazing on the hearth, asking if she should take Miss  Elsie's things.    \"Yes,\" Mr. Dinsmore said, removing his daughter's hat and shawl, and  handing them to her.    She left the room; and taking Elsie in his arms, and gently laying her  head upon his breast, \"Let the tears have their way, darling,\" he said,  \"it will do you good.\"    For several minutes the tears came in floods. \"Oh, papa,\" she sobbed, \"to  think that my people, my poor people, should be so served. It must never,  never be again!\"    \"No,\" he said, \"we will find means to prevent it. There, you feel better  now, do you not?\"    \"Yes, sir. Papa dear, welcome, welcome to my house; the dearest guest  that could come to it.\" And wiping away her tears, she lifted her loving  eyes to his, a tender smile playing about the sweet lips.    \"Save one,\" he answered half-playfully, passing his hand caressingly over  her hair, and bending down to press his lips on brow, and cheeks, and  mouth. \"Is not that so?\"    \"No, my own dear father, save none,\" with a charming blush, but eyes  looking steadily into his; \"when he comes, it shall be as master, not  guest. But now tell me, please, what can I do with this Spriggs? I should  like to pay him a month's wages in advance, and start him off early  to-morrow morning.\"    Mr. Dinsmore shook his head gravely. \"It would not do, my child. The  sugar-making season will shortly begin; he understands the business  thoroughly; we could not supply his place at a moment's notice, or  probably in a number of months, and the whole crop would be lost. We must  not be hasty or rash, but remember the Bible command, 'Let your moderation  be known unto all men.' Nor should we allow ourselves to judge the man too  hardly.\"    \"Too hardly, papa! too hardly, when he has shown himself so cruel! But I  beg pardon for interrupting you.\"    \"Yes, too hardly, daughter. He is a New Englander, used to see every one  about him working with steady, persevering industry, and the indolent,  dawdling ways of the blacks, which we take as a matter of course, are  exceedingly trying to him. I think he has been very faithful to your  interests, and that probably his desire and determination to see them  advanced to the utmost, led, more than anything else, to the act which  seems to us so cruel.\"    \"And could he suppose that I would have blood wrung from my poor people  that a few more dollars might find their way into my purse?\" she cried in  indignant sorrow and anger. \"Oh, papa, I am not so cruel, you know I am  not.\"    \"Yes, my darling, I know you have a very tender, loving heart.\"    \"But what shall I do with Spriggs?\"    \"For to-night, express your sentiments and feelings on the subject as  calmly and moderately as you can, and enjoin it upon him to act in  accordance with them. Then we may consider at our leisure what further  measures can be taken.\"    \"Papa, you are so much wiser and better than I,\" she said, with loving  admiration, \"I'm afraid if you had not been here to advise me, I should  have sent him away at once, with never a thought of crops or anything  except securing my people from his cruelties.\"    \"You should never allow yourself to act from mere impulse, except it be  unquestionably a right one, and the case admitting of no time for  deliberation. As to my superior wisdom,\" he added with a smile, \"I have  lived some years longer than you, and had more experience in the  management of business matters.\"    \"I am very sorry, my darling, that the pleasure of your return to the home  of your infancy should be so marred. But you have scarcely taken a look  yet at even this room. What do you think of it?\"    She glanced about her with freshly aroused curiosity and interest. \"Papa,  it is just to my taste!\"    The firelight gleamed upon rare old cabinets, gems of art in painting and  statuary, and rich, massive, well-preserved, though old-fashioned sofas,  chairs, tables, etc. But it was already growing dark, deep shadows were  gathering in the more distant parts of the spacious apartment, and only  near the fire could objects be distinctly seen. Elsie was about to ring  for lights, when Sarah, the mulatto girl, appeared, bringing them, Chloe  following close in the rear.    \"Have you fires and lights in the library, the dining-room, and your  master's rooms and mine?\" inquired Elsie.    \"De fires is lit, Miss Elsie.\"    \"Then add the lights at once, and put them in all the principal rooms of  the house. We will have an illumination in honor of our arrival, papa,\"  she said, in a sprightly tone, turning to him with one of her sweetest  smiles, \"and besides, I want to see the whole house now.\"    \"Are you not too much fatigued, daughter? and would it not be better to  defer it till to-morrow?\"    \"I don't think I'm too tired, papa; but if you forbid me----\"    \"No, I don't forbid or even advise, if you are sure you feel equal to the  exertion.\"    \"Thank you, sir, I think I'll be better able to sleep if I've seen at  least the most of it; old memories are troubling me, and I want to see how  far they are correct You will go with me?\"    \"Certainly,\" he said, giving her his arm. \"But while the servants are  obeying your order in regard to the lights, let us examine these paintings  more attentively. They will repay close scrutiny, for some of them are by  the first masters. Your Grandfather Grayson seems to have been a man of  cultivated taste, as well as great business talent.\"    \"Yes, papa. What is it, mammy?\"    \"Does you want me, darlin'?\"    \"No, not now. Go and enjoy yourself with your husband and old friends.\"    Chloe expressed her grateful thanks, and withdrew.    Elsie found the paintings and statuary a study, and had scarcely finished  her survey of the drawing-room and its treasures of art, when Aunt Phillis  came to ask if they would have tea served up immediately.    Elsie looked at her father.    \"Yes,\" he said; \"you will feel stronger after eating, and it is about our  usual"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14875"],[0,"Elsie's children (#8)"],[1,"ult, many hearts besides those of his doting parents were  drawn to him in sincere affection; Elsie's among the rest; yet she dreaded  exposing her little sons to Phil's influence; Edward especially as nearer  Phil's age, and because, though much improved by good training, his  natural disposition was very similar. But she had not seen Philip for two  years, and hoped he might have changed for the better.    It seemed so at first. He was a bright, handsome youth, and came home in  fine spirits, and with a manner full of affection for parents, brothers  and sisters. She did not wonder at Lucy's fond pride in her eldest son.    \"Phil,\" said his mother, following him into his room that night, \"you have  made a good impression, and I'm very anxious you shouldn't spoil it; so do  try to keep on your good behavior while the Travillas stay.\"    \"I intend to, Mrs. Ross,\" he returned, with a laugh. Elsie, little Elsie's  been my little lady love since the first time my eyes lighted on her, and  I know that if I want to secure the prize, I've got to keep on the right  side of her father and mother.\"    Lucy laughed. \"You are beginning early, Phil,\" she said. \"I advise you not  to say a word of your hopes in their hearing, for ten years to come.\"    \"Trust me for managing the thing, ma,\" he returned, nodding his head  wisely. \"But do you s'pose now, they'd be so outrageously unreasonable as  to expect a fellow to be quite perfect?\" he queried, striking a match and  lighting a cigar.    \"Phil! Phil! throw that away!\" she said, trying to snatch it from him.    He sprang nimbly aside, \"No, you don't, ma! Why shouldn't I smoke as well  as my father? Ministers smoke too, and lots of good people.\"    \"But you're too young to begin yet, and I know your Aunt Elsie would be  horrified. She'd think you a very fast boy and hurry away with her  children, lest they should be contaminated by your bad example.\"    \"Well,\" he answered, puffing away, \"I'll not let her or them know I ever  indulge. I'll only smoke up here and at night, and the smell will be all  off my breath by morning.\"    \"I wish you'd give it up entirely. Where did you ever learn it?\"    \"Comes natural; guess I inherited the taste. But nearly all the fellows at  school do it--on the sly.\"    \"Ah, Phil, I'm afraid you're a sad fellow!\" Lucy said, shaking her head  reprovingly; but he could see the smile shining in her fond, admiring  eyes, and lurking about the corners of her mouth.    \"Oh, come now, ma, I'm not so bad; not the worst fellow in the world. I  wouldn't do a mean thing.\"    \"No, of course not,\" she said, kissing him good-night, and leaving him  with a parting, \"Don't forget to say your prayers, Phil.\"    Mr. and Mrs. Ross were not Christian parents; careful and solicitous about  the temporal welfare of their children, they gave little thought to their  spiritual needs. Lucy taught them, in their infancy, to say their prayers  before lying down to rest at night, as they grew older sent them to  Sunday-school, took them to church on pleasant Sabbath mornings, when it  was convenient, and she felt inclined to go herself, and provided each  one with a copy of the Bible.    This was about the extent of the religious training they received; and it  was strongly counteracted by the worldly atmosphere of their home, the  worldly example set them by their parents, and the worldly maxims and  precepts constantly instilled into their young minds.    From these, they learned to look upon the riches, honors and pleasures of  earth as the things to be most earnestly coveted, most worthy of untiring  efforts to secure.    Life at the Crags was a strange puzzle to the Ion children: no blessing  asked at the table, no gathering of the family morning or evening for  prayer or praise or the reading of God's word.    \"Mamma, what does it mean?\" they asked; \"why doesn't Uncle Ross do as papa  does?\"    Elsie scarce knew how to answer them. \"Don't let us talk about it, dears,\"  she said: \"but whatever others may do, let us serve God ourselves and seek  his favor above everything else; for 'in his favor is life' and his loving  kindness is better than life.\"          CHAPTER EIGHTH.        \"To each his sufferings: all are men          Condemn'd alike to groan;      The tender for another's pain,          The unfeeling for his own.\"                          --GRAY.      The weather was delightful: because of Phil's return the children were  excused altogether from lessons and nearly every day was taken up with  picnics, riding, driving and boating excursions up and down the river.    They were never allowed to go alone on the water or behind any horse but  \"Old Nan,\" an old slow moving creature that Phil said \"could not be  persuaded or forced out of a quiet even trot that was little better than a  walk, for five consecutive minutes.\"    The mothers were generally of the party;--Lily continuing so much better  that Elsie could leave her, without anxiety, in the faithful care of her  old mammy--and always one or two trusty servants were taken along.    One day Philip got permission to take old Nan and the phaeton and drive  out with the two older girls, Gertrude and Elsie.    They were gone several hours and on their return, while still some miles  from home were overtaken by a heavy shower, from which they took refuge in  a small log-house standing a few yards back from the road.    It was a rude structure built in a wild spot among the rocks and trees,  and evidently the abode of pinching poverty; but everything was clean and  neat, and the occupants, an elderly woman reclining in a high-backed  wooden rocking-chair with her feet propped up on a rude bench, and a young  girl who sat sewing by a window overlooking the road, wore an air of  refinement, and spoke English more correctly and with a purer accent than  sometimes is heard in the abodes of wealth and fashion.    The door stood wide open and the moment Philip drew rein, the girl at the  window called to them to come in out of the wet, and directed the lad to  shelter his horse and phaeton underneath a shed at the side of the house.    Gertrude ran lightly in with a laugh and jest, Elsie following close at  her heels.    The girl rose and setting out two unpainted wooden chairs, invited them to  be seated, remarking as she resumed her work, that the shower had come up  very suddenly, but she hoped they were not wet.    \"Not enough to hurt us,\" said Gertrude.    \"Hardly at all, thank you,\" I said Elsie. \"I hope our mammas will not be  alarmed about us, Gerty.\"    \"I don't think they need be so long as there's no thunder and lightning,\"  answered Gertrude. \"Ah, see how it is pouring over yonder on the mountain,  Elsie!\"    The pale face of the woman in the rocking-chair, evidently an invalid, had  grown still paler and her features worked with emotion.    \"Child! child!\" she cried, fixing her wild eyes on Elsie, \"who--who are  you?\"    \"They're the young ladies from the Crags, mother,\" said the girl  soothingly.    \"I know that, Sally,\" she answered peevishly, \"but one's a visitor, and  the other one called her Elsie, she's just the age and very image  of--child, what is your family name?\"    \"Travilla, madam,\" the little girl replied, with a look of surprise.    \"Oh, you're her daughter; yes, of course I might have known it. And so she  married him, her father's friend and so many years older.\"    The words were spoken as if to herself and she finished with a deep drawn  sigh.    This woman had loved Travilla--all unsuspected by him, for he was not a  conceited man--and there had been a time when she would have almost given  her hopes of heaven for a return of her affection.    \"Is it my mother you mean? did you know her when she was a little girl?\"  asked Elsie, rising and drawing near the woman's chair.    \"Yes; if she was Elsie Dinsmore, and lived at Roselands--how many years  ago? let me see; it was a good many; long before I was married to John  Gibson.\"    \"That was mamma's name and that was where she lived; with her grandpa,  while her papa was away in Europe so many years,\" returned the little  Elsie; then asked with eager interest, \"But how did you happen to know  her? did you live near Roselands?\"    \"I lived there; but I was a person of no consequence; only a poor  governess,\" remarked the woman in a bitter tone; an expression of angry  discontent settling down upon her features.    \"Are you Miss Day?\" asked Elsie, retreating a step or two with a look as  if she had seen a serpent.    Her mother had seldom mentioned Miss Day to her, but from her Aunts  Adelaide and Lora she had heard of her many acts of cruelty and injustice  to the little motherless girl committed to her care.    \"I was Miss Day; I'm Mrs. Gibson now. I was a little hard on your mother  sometimes, as I see you've been told; but I'd a great deal to bear; for  they were a proud, haughty family--those Dinsmores. I was not treated as  one of themselves, but as a sort of upper servant, though a lady by  birth, breeding and education,\" the woman remarked, her tone growing more  and more bitter as she proceeded.    \"But was it right? was it just and generous to vent your anger upon a poor  little innocent girl who had no mother and no father there to defend her?\"  asked the child, her soft eyes rilling with tears.    \"Well maybe not; but it's the way people generally do. Your mother was a  good little thing, provokingly good sometimes; pretty too, and heiress,  they said, to an immense fortune. Is she rich still? or did she lose it  all by the war?\"    \"She did not lose it all, I know,\" said Elsie, \"but how rich she is I do  not know; mamma and papa seldom talk of any but the true riches.\"    \"Just like her, for all the world!\" muttered the woman. Then aloud and  sneeringly, \"Pray what do you mean by the true riches?\"    \"Those which can never be taken from us; treasure laid up in heaven where  neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and thieves break not"]]]
