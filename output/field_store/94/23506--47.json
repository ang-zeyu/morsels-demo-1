The forcible intervention of the United States as a neutral to stop the  war, according to the large dictates of humanity and following many  historical precedents where neighboring states have interfered to check  the hopeless sacrifices of life by internecine conflicts beyond their  borders, is justifiable on rational grounds. It involves, however,  hostile constraint upon both the parties to the contest, as well to  enforce a truce as to guide the eventual settlement.    The grounds for such intervention may be briefly summarized as follows:    First. In the cause of humanity and to put an end to the barbarities,  bloodshed, starvation, and horrible miseries now existing there, and  which the parties to the conflict are either unable or unwilling to stop  or mitigate. It is no answer to say this is all in another country,  belonging to another nation, and is therefore none of our business.  It is specially our duty, for it is right at our door.    Second. We owe it to our citizens in Cuba to afford them that protection  and indemnity for life and property which no government there can or  will afford, and to that end to terminate the conditions that deprive  them of legal protection.    Third. The right to intervene may be justified by the very serious  injury to the commerce, trade, and business of our people and by the  wanton destruction of property and devastation of the island.    Fourth, and which is of the utmost importance. The present condition of  affairs in Cuba is a constant menace to our peace and entails upon this  Government an enormous expense. With such a conflict waged for years  in an island so near us and with which our people have such trade and  business relations; when the lives and liberty of our citizens are in  constant danger and their property destroyed and themselves ruined;  where our trading vessels are liable to seizure and are seized at  our very door by war ships of a foreign nation; the expeditions of  filibustering that we are powerless to prevent altogether, and the  irritating questions and entanglements thus arising--all these and  others that I need not mention, with the resulting strained relations,  are a constant menace to our peace and compel us to keep on a semi war  footing with a nation with which we are at peace.    These elements of danger and disorder already pointed out have been  strikingly illustrated by a tragic event which has deeply and justly  moved the American people. I have already transmitted to Congress the  report of the naval court of inquiry on the destruction of the battle  ship _Maine_ in the harbor of Havana during the night of the 15th  of February.[6] The destruction of that noble vessel has filled the  national heart with inexpressible horror. Two hundred and fifty-eight  brave sailors and marines and two officers of our Navy, reposing in the  fancied security of a friendly harbor, have been hurled to death, grief  and want brought to their homes and sorrow to the nation.    The naval court of inquiry, which, it is needless to say, commands  the unqualified confidence of the Government, was unanimous in its  conclusion that the destruction of the _Maine_ was caused by an  exterior explosion--that of a submarine mine. It did not assume to  place the responsibility. That remains to be fixed.    In any event, the destruction of the _Maine_, by whatever exterior  cause, is a patent and impressive proof of a state of things in Cuba  that is intolerable. That condition is thus shown to be such that the  Spanish Government can not assure safety and security to a vessel of the  American Navy in the harbor of Havana on a mission of peace, and  rightfully there.    Further referring in this connection to recent diplomatic  correspondence, a dispatch from our minister to Spain of the 26th ultimo  contained the statement that the Spanish minister for foreign affairs  assured him positively that Spain will do all that the highest honor  and justice require in the matter of the _Maine_. The reply above  referred to, of the 31st ultimo, also contained an expression of the  readiness of Spain to submit to an arbitration all the differences which  can arise in this matter, which is subsequently explained by the note of  the Spanish minister at Washington of the 10th instant, as follows:      As to the question of fact which springs from the diversity of views    between the reports of the American and Spanish boards, Spain proposes    that the facts be ascertained by an impartial investigation by experts,    whose decision Spain accepts in advance.      To this I have made no reply.    President Grant, in 1875, after discussing the phases of the contest as  it then appeared and its hopeless and apparent indefinite prolongation,  said:      In such event I am of opinion that other nations will be compelled to    assume the responsibility which devolves upon them, and to seriously    consider the only remaining measures possible--mediation and    intervention. Owing, perhaps, to the large expanse of water separating    the island from the peninsula, * * * the contending parties appear to    have within themselves no depository of common confidence to suggest    wisdom when passion and excitement have their sway and to assume the    part of peacemaker. In this view in the earlier days of the contest the    good offices of the United States as a mediator were tendered in good    faith, without any selfish purpose, in the interest of humanity and in    sincere friendship for both parties, but were at the time declined by    Spain, with the declaration, nevertheless, that at a future time they    would be indispensable. No intimation has been received that in the    opinion of Spain that time has been reached. And yet the strife    continues, with all its dread horrors and all its injuries to the    interests of the United States and of other nations. Each party seems    quite capable of working great injury and damage to the other, as well    as to all the relations and interests dependent on the existence of    peace in the island; but they seem incapable of reaching any adjustment,    and both have thus far failed of achieving any success whereby one party    shall possess and control the island to the exclusion of the other.    Under these circumstances the agency of others, either by mediation or    by intervention, seems to be the only alternative which must, sooner or    later, be invoked for the termination of the strife.      In the last annual message of my immediate predecessor, during the  pending struggle, it was said:      When the inability of Spain to deal successfully with the insurrection    has become manifest and it is demonstrated that her sovereignty is    extinct in Cuba for all purposes of its rightful existence, and when a    hopeless struggle for its reestablishment has degenerated into a strife    which means nothing more than the useless sacrifice of human life and    the utter destruction of the very subject-matter of the conflict, a    situation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereignty    of Spain will be superseded by higher obligations, which we can hardly    hesitate to recognize and discharge.      In my annual message to Congress December last, speaking to this  question, I said:      The near future will demonstrate whether the indispensable condition of    a righteous peace, just alike to the Cubans and to Spain, as well as    equitable to all our interests so intimately involved in the welfare    of Cuba, is likely to be attained. If not, the exigency of further and    other action by the United States will remain to be taken. When that    time conies, that action will be determined in the line of indisputable    right and duty. It will be faced, without misgiving or hesitancy, in    the light of the obligation this Government owes to itself, to the    people who have confided to it the protection of their interests and    honor, and to humanity.      Sure of the right, keeping free from all offense ourselves, actuated    only by upright and patriotic considerations, moved neither by passion    nor selfishness, the Government will continue its watchful care over    the rights and property of American citizens and will abate none of    its efforts to bring about by peaceful agencies a peace which shall    be honorable and enduring. If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty    imposed by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization, and humanity    to intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our part and only    because the necessity for such action will be so clear as to command    the support and approval of the civilized world.      The long trial has proved that the object for which Spain has waged  the war can not be attained. The fire of insurrection may flame or may  smolder with varying seasons, but it has not been and it is plain that  it can not be extinguished by present methods. The only hope of relief  and repose from a condition which can no longer be endured is the  enforced pacification of Cuba. In the name of humanity, in the name of  civilization, in behalf of endangered American interests which give us  the right and the duty to speak and to act, the war in Cuba must stop.    In view of these facts and of these considerations I ask the Congress  to authorize and empower the President to take measures to secure a full  and final termination of hostilities between the Government of Spain  and the people of Cuba, and to secure in the island the establishment  of a stable government, capable of maintaining order and observing its  international obligations, insuring peace and tranquillity and the  security of its citizens as well as our own, and to use the military  and naval forces of the United States as may be necessary for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/139"],[0,"The Lost World (#8)"],[1," to be present at the exhibition.\"  He  handed me a card from his desk.  \"You will perceive that Mr. Percival  Waldron, a naturalist of some popular repute, is announced to lecture  at eight-thirty at the Zoological Institute's Hall upon 'The Record of  the Ages.' I have been specially invited to be present upon the  platform, and to move a vote of thanks to the lecturer.  While doing  so, I shall make it my business, with infinite tact and delicacy, to  throw out a few remarks which may arouse the interest of the audience  and cause some of them to desire to go more deeply into the matter.  Nothing contentious, you understand, but only an indication that there  are greater deeps beyond.  I shall hold myself strongly in leash, and  see whether by this self-restraint I attain a more favorable result.\"    \"And I may come?\" I asked eagerly.    \"Why, surely,\" he answered, cordially.  He had an enormously massive  genial manner, which was almost as overpowering as his violence.  His  smile of benevolence was a wonderful thing, when his cheeks would  suddenly bunch into two red apples, between his half-closed eyes and  his great black beard.  \"By all means, come.  It will be a comfort to  me to know that I have one ally in the hall, however inefficient and  ignorant of the subject he may be.  I fancy there will be a large  audience, for Waldron, though an absolute charlatan, has a considerable  popular following.  Now, Mr. Malone, I have given you rather more of my  time than I had intended.  The individual must not monopolize what is  meant for the world.  I shall be pleased to see you at the lecture  to-night.  In the meantime, you will understand that no public use is  to be made of any of the material that I have given you.\"    \"But Mr. McArdle--my news editor, you know--will want to know what I  have done.\"    \"Tell him what you like.  You can say, among other things, that if he  sends anyone else to intrude upon me I shall call upon him with a  riding-whip.  But I leave it to you that nothing of all this appears in  print.  Very good.  Then the Zoological Institute's Hall at  eight-thirty to-night.\"  I had a last impression of red cheeks, blue  rippling beard, and intolerant eyes, as he waved me out of the room.                                      CHAPTER V                               \"Question!\"    What with the physical shocks incidental to my first interview with  Professor Challenger and the mental ones which accompanied the second,  I was a somewhat demoralized journalist by the time I found myself in  Enmore Park once more.  In my aching head the one thought was throbbing  that there really was truth in this man's story, that it was of  tremendous consequence, and that it would work up into inconceivable  copy for the Gazette when I could obtain permission to use it.  A  taxicab was waiting at the end of the road, so I sprang into it and  drove down to the office.  McArdle was at his post as usual.    \"Well,\" he cried, expectantly, \"what may it run to?  I'm thinking,  young man, you have been in the wars.  Don't tell me that he assaulted  you.\"    \"We had a little difference at first.\"    \"What a man it is!  What did you do?\"    \"Well, he became more reasonable and we had a chat.  But I got nothing  out of him--nothing for publication.\"    \"I'm not so sure about that.  You got a black eye out of him, and  that's for publication.  We can't have this reign of terror, Mr.  Malone.  We must bring the man to his bearings.  I'll have a leaderette  on him to-morrow that will raise a blister.  Just give me the material  and I will engage to brand the fellow for ever.  Professor  Munchausen--how's that for an inset headline?  Sir John Mandeville  redivivus--Cagliostro--all the imposters and bullies in history.  I'll  show him up for the fraud he is.\"    \"I wouldn't do that, sir.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"Because he is not a fraud at all.\"    \"What!\" roared McArdle.  \"You don't mean to say you really believe this  stuff of his about mammoths and mastodons and great sea sairpents?\"    \"Well, I don't know about that.  I don't think he makes any claims of  that kind.  But I do believe he has got something new.\"    \"Then for Heaven's sake, man, write it up!\"    \"I'm longing to, but all I know he gave me in confidence and on  condition that I didn't.\"  I condensed into a few sentences the  Professor's narrative.  \"That's how it stands.\"    McArdle looked deeply incredulous.    \"Well, Mr. Malone,\" he said at last, \"about this scientific meeting  to-night; there can be no privacy about that, anyhow.  I don't suppose  any paper will want to report it, for Waldron has been reported already  a dozen times, and no one is aware that Challenger will speak.  We may  get a scoop, if we are lucky.  You'll be there in any case, so you'll  just give us a pretty full report.  I'll keep space up to midnight.\"    My day was a busy one, and I had an early dinner at the Savage Club  with Tarp Henry, to whom I gave some account of my adventures.  He  listened with a sceptical smile on his gaunt face, and roared with  laughter on hearing that the Professor had convinced me.    \"My dear chap, things don't happen like that in real life.  People  don't stumble upon enormous discoveries and then lose their evidence.  Leave that to the novelists.  The fellow is as full of tricks as the  monkey-house at the Zoo.  It's all bosh.\"    \"But the American poet?\"    \"He never existed.\"    \"I saw his sketch-book.\"    \"Challenger's sketch-book.\"    \"You think he drew that animal?\"    \"Of course he did.  Who else?\"    \"Well, then, the photographs?\"    \"There was nothing in the photographs.  By your own admission you only  saw a bird.\"    \"A pterodactyl.\"    \"That's what HE says.  He put the pterodactyl into your head.\"    \"Well, then, the bones?\"    \"First one out of an Irish stew.  Second one vamped up for the  occasion.  If you are clever and know your business you can fake a bone  as easily as you can a photograph.\"    I began to feel uneasy.  Perhaps, after all, I had been premature in my  acquiescence.  Then I had a sudden happy thought.    \"Will you come to the meeting?\" I asked.    Tarp Henry looked thoughtful.    \"He is not a popular person, the genial Challenger,\" said he.  \"A lot  of people have accounts to settle with him.  I should say he is about  the best-hated man in London.  If the medical students turn out there  will be no end of a rag.  I don't want to get into a bear-garden.\"    \"You might at least do him the justice to hear him state his own case.\"    \"Well, perhaps it's only fair.  All right.  I'm your man for the  evening.\"    When we arrived at the hall we found a much greater concourse than I  had expected.  A line of electric broughams discharged their little  cargoes of white-bearded professors, while the dark stream of humbler  pedestrians, who crowded through the arched door-way, showed that the  audience would be popular as well as scientific.  Indeed, it became  evident to us as soon as we had taken our seats that a youthful and  even boyish spirit was abroad in the gallery and the back portions of  the hall.  Looking behind me, I could see rows of faces of the familiar  medical student type.  Apparently the great hospitals had each sent  down their contingent.  The behavior of the audience at present was  good-humored, but mischievous.  Scraps of popular songs were chorused  with an enthusiasm which was a strange prelude to a scientific lecture,  and there was already a tendency to personal chaff which promised a  jovial evening to others, however embarrassing it might be to the  recipients of these dubious honors.    Thus, when old Doctor Meldrum, with his well-known curly-brimmed  opera-hat, appeared upon the platform, there was such a universal query  of \"Where DID you get that tile?\" that he hurriedly removed it, and  concealed it furtively under his chair.  When gouty Professor Wadley  limped down to his seat there were general affectionate inquiries from  all parts of the hall as to the exact state of his poor toe, which  caused him obvious embarrassment.  The greatest demonstration of all,  however, was at the entrance of my new acquaintance, Professor  Challenger, when he passed down to take his place at the extreme end of  the front row of the platform.  Such a yell of welcome broke forth when  his black beard first protruded round the corner that I began to  suspect Tarp Henry was right in his surmise, and that this assemblage  was there not merely for the sake of the lecture, but because it had  got rumored abroad that the famous Professor would take part in the  proceedings.    There was some sympathetic laughter on his entrance among the front  benches of well-dressed spectators, as though the demonstration of the  students in this instance was not unwelcome to them.  That greeting  was, indeed, a frightful outburst of sound, the uproar of the carnivora  cage when the step of the bucket-bearing keeper is heard in the  distance.  There was an offensive tone in it, perhaps, and yet in the  main it struck me as mere riotous outcry, the noisy reception of one  who amused and interested them, rather than of one they disliked or  despised.  Challenger smiled with weary and tolerant contempt, as a  kindly man would meet the yapping of a litter of puppies.  He sat  slowly down, blew out his chest, passed his hand caressingly down his  beard, and looked with drooping eyelids and supercilious eyes at the  crowded hall before him.  The uproar of his advent had not yet died  away when Professor Ronald Murray, the chairman, and Mr. Waldron, the  lecturer, threaded their way to the front, and the proceedings began.    Professor Murray will, I am sure, excuse me if I say that he has the  common fault of most Englishmen of being inaudible.  Why on earth  people who have something to say which is worth hearing should not take  the slight trouble to learn how to make it heard is one of the strange  mysteries of modern life."]]]
