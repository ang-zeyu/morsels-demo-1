The beginning of the reign of Amenothes II. was marked by a revolt of  the Libyans inhabiting the Theban Oasis, but this rising was soon  put down by that Amenemhabi who had so distinguished himself under  Thutmosis.* Soon after, fresh troubles broke out in different parts of  Syria, in Galilee, in the country of the Amurru, and among the peoples  of Naharaim. The king's prompt action, however, prevented their  resulting in a general war.** He marched in person against the  malcontents, reduced the town of Shamshiaduma, fell upon the Lamnaniu,  and attacked their chief, slaying him with his own hand, and carrying  off numbers of captives.         * Brugsch and Wiedemann place this expedition at the time       when Amenothes IL was either hereditary prince or associated       with his father the inscription of Amenemhabi places it       explicitly after the death of Thutmosis III., and this       evidence outweighs every other consideration until further       discoveries are made.         ** The campaigns of Amenothes II. were related on a granite       stele, which was placed against the second of the southern       pylons at Karnak. The date of this monument is almost       certainly the year II.; there is strong evidence in favour       of this, if it is compared with the inscription of Amada,       where Amenothes II. relates that in the year III. he       sacrificed the prisoners whom he had taken in the country of       Tikhisa.    [Illustration: 044.jpg AMENOTHES II., FROM THE STATUE AT TURIN]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin.    He crossed the Orontes on the 26th of Pachons, in the year II., and  seeing some mounted troops in the distance, rushed upon them and  overthrew them; they proved to be the advanced guard of the enemy's  force, which he encountered shortly afterwards and routed, collecting  in the pursuit considerable booty. He finally reached Naharaim, where he  experienced in the main but a feeble resistance. Nii surrendered without  resistance on the 10th of Epiphi, and its inhabitants, both men  and women, with censers in their hands, assembled on the walls and  prostrated themselves before the conqueror. At Akaiti, where the  partisans of the Egyptian government had suffered persecution from a  considerable section of the natives, order was at once reestablished as  soon as the king's approach was made known. No doubt the rapidity of  his marches and the vigour of his attacks, while putting an end to  the hostile attitude of the smaller vassal states, were effectual in  inducing the sovereigns of Alasia, of Mitanni,* and of the Hittites to  renew with Amenothes the friendly relations which they had established  with his father.**         * Amenothes II. mentions tribute from Mitanni on one of the       columns which he decorated at Karnak, in the Hall of the       Caryatides, close to the pillars finished by his       predecessors.         ** The cartouches on the pedestal of the throne of Amenothes       IL, in the tomb of one of his officers at Sheikh-Abd-el-       Qurneh, represent--together with the inhabitants of the       Oasis, Libya, and Kush--the Kefatiu, the people of Naharaim,       and the Upper Lotanu, that is to say, the entire dominion of       Thutmosis III., besides the people of Manus, probably       Mallos, in the Cilician plain.    This one campaign, which lasted three or four months, secured a lasting  peace in the north, but in the south a disturbance again broke out among  the Barbarians of the Upper Nile. Amenothes suppressed it, and, in order  to prevent a repetition of it, was guilty of an act of cruel severity  quite in accordance with the manners of the time. He had taken prisoner  seven chiefs in the country of Tikhisa, and had brought them, chained,  in triumph to Thebes, on the forecastle of his ship. He sacrificed six  of them himself before Amon, and exposed their heads and hands on the  facade of the temple of Karnak; the seventh was subjected to a similar  fate at Napata at the beginning of his third year, and thenceforth  the sheikhs of Kush thought twice before defying the authority of the  Pharaoh.*         * In an inscription in the temple of Amada, it is there said       that the king offered this sacrifice on his return from his       first expedition into Asia, and for this reason I have       connected the facts thus related with those known to us       through the stele of Karnak.    Amenothes'reign was a short one, lasting ten years at most, and the end  of it seems to have been darkened by the open or secret rivalries which  the question of the succession usually stirred up among the kings' sons.  The king had daughters only by his marriage with one of his full  sisters, who like himself possessed all the rights of sovereignty; those  of his sons who did not die young were the children of princesses of  inferior rank or of concubines, and it was a subject of anxiety among  these princes which of them would be chosen to inherit the crown and be  united in marriage with the king's heiresses, Khuit and Mutemuau.    [Illustration: 046.jpg THE GREAT SPHINX AND THE CHAPEL OF THUTMOSIS IV.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the photograph taken in 1887 by       Emil Brugsch-Bey    [Illustration: 047.jpg THE SIMOOM. SPHINX AND PYRAMIDS AT GIZEH]    One of his sons, named Thutmosis, who resided at the \"White Wall,\" was  in the habit of betaking himself frequently to the Libyan desert to  practise with the javelin, or to pursue the hunt of lions and gazelles  in his chariot. On these occasions it was his pleasure to preserve the  strictest incognito, and he was accompanied by two discreet servants  only. One day, when chance had brought him into the neighbourhood of the  Great Pyramid, he lay down for his accustomed siesta in the shade cast  by the Sphinx, the miraculous image of Khopri the most powerful, the  god to whom all men in Memphis and the neighbouring towns raised adoring  hands filled with offerings. The gigantic statue was at that time more  than half buried, and its head alone was seen above the sand. As soon  as the prince was asleep it spoke gently to him, as a father to his  son: \"Behold me, gaze on me, O my son Thutmosis, for I, thy father  Harmakhis-Khopri-Tumu, grant thee sovereignty over the two countries, in  both the South and the North, and thou shalt wear both the white and the  red crown on the throne of Sibu, the sovereign, possessing the earth in  its length and breadth; the flashing eye of the lord of all shall cause  to rain on thee the possessions of Egypt, vast tribute from all foreign  countries, and a long life for, many years as one chosen by the Sun,  for my countenance is thine, my heart is thine, no other than thyself is  mine! Nor am I covered by the sand of the mountain on which I rest,  and have given thee this prize that thou mayest do for me what my heart  desires, for I know that thou art my son, my defender; draw nigh, I am  with thee, I am thy well-beloved father.\" The prince understood that the  god promised him the kingdom on condition of his swearing to clear the  sand from the statue. He was, in fact, chosen to be the husband of the  queens, and immediately after his accession he fulfilled his oath; he  removed the sand, built a chapel between the paws, and erected against  the breast of the statue a stele of red granite, on which he related  his adventure. His reign was as short as that of Amenothes, and his  campaigns both in Asia and Ethiopia were unimportant.*         * The latest date of his reign at present known is that of       the year VII., on the rocks of Konosso, and on a stele of       Sarbut el-Khadim. There is an allusion to his wars against       the Ethiopians in an inscription of Amada, and to his       campaigns against the peoples of the North and South on the       stele of Nofirhait.    [Illustration: 050.jpg THE STELE OF THE SPHINX OF GIZER]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-Bey.    He had succeeded to an empire so firmly established from Naharaim to  Kari,* that, apparently, no rebellion could disturb its peace. One of  the two heiress-princesses, Kuit, the daughter, sister, and wife of a  king, had no living male offspring, but her companion Mutemuau had at  least one son, named Amenothes. In his case, again, the noble birth  of the mother atoned for the defects of the paternal origin. Moreover,  according to tradition, Amon-Ka himself had intervened to renew the  blood of his descendants: he appeared in the person of Thutmosis IV.,  and under this guise became the father of the heir of the Pharaohs.**         * The peoples of Naharaim and of Northern Syria are       represented bringing him tribute, in a tomb at Sheikh-Abd-       el-Qurneh. The inscription published by Mariette, speaks of       the first expedition of Thutmosis IV. to the land of       [Naharai]na, and of the gifts which he lavished on this       occasion on the temple of Anion.         ** It was at first thought that Mutemuau was an Ethiopian,       afterwards that she was a Syrian, who had changed her name       on arriving at the court of her husband. The manner in which       she is represented at Luxor, and in all the texts where she       figures, proves not only that she was of Egyptian race, but       that she was the daughter of Amenothes II., and born of the       marriage of that prince with one of his sisters, who was       herself an hereditary princess.    Like Queen Ahmasis in the bas-reliefs of Deir el-Bahari, Mutemuau  is shown on those of Luxor in the arms of her divine lover, and  subsequently greeted by him with the title of mother; in another  bas-relief we see the queen led to her couch by the goddesses who  preside over"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17326"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 6 (of 12) (#8)"],[1,"these  would not at first give them a hearing. \"We will not return,\" they would  say to the peacemakers; \"make it clear to your superiors down below  there.\" It must have been manifest that from their point of view their  complaints were well founded, and the official, who afterwards gave an  account of the affair to the authorities, was persuaded of this. \"We  went to hear them, and they spoke true words to us.\" For the most part  these strikes had no other consequence than a prolonged stoppage of  work, until the distribution of rations at the beginning of the next  month gave the malcontents courage to return to their tasks. Attempts  were made to prevent the recurrence of these troubles by changing  the method and time of payments. These were reduced to an interval of  fifteen days, and at length, indeed, to one of eight. The result was  very much the same as before: the workman, paid more frequently, did not  on that account become more prudent, and the hours of labour lost did  not decrease. The individual man, if he had had nobody to consider but  himself, might have put up with the hardships of his situation, but  there were almost always wife and children or sisters concerned, who  clamoured for bread in their hunger, and all the while the storehouses  of the temples or those of the state close by were filled to overflowing  with durrah, barley, and wheat.*         * Khonsu, for example, excites his comrades to pillage the       storehouses of the gate.    The temptation to break open the doors and to help themselves in the  present necessity must have been keenly felt. Some bold spirits among  the strikers, having set out together, scaled the two or three boundary  walls by which the granaries were protected, but having reached this  position their hearts, failed them, and they contented themselves with  sending to the chief custodian an eloquent pleader, to lay before him  their very humble request: \"We are come, urged by famine, urged by  thirst, having no more linen, no more oil, no more fish, no more  vegetables. Send to Pharaoh, our master, send to the king, our lord,  that he may provide us with the necessaries of life.\" If one of them,  with less self-restraint, was so carried away as to let drop an oath,  which was a capital offence, saying, \"By Amon! by the sovereign, whose  anger is death!\" if he asked to be taken before a magistrate in order  that he might reiterate there his complaint, the others interceded for  him, and begged that he might escape the punishment fixed by the law  for blasphemy; the scribe, good fellow as he was, closed his ears to the  oath, and, if it were in his power, made a beginning of satisfying their  demands by drawing upon the excess of past months to such an extent as  would pacify them for some days, and by paying them a supplemental wage  in the name of the Pharaoh. They cried out loudly: \"Shall there not be  served out to us corn in excess of that which has been distributed to  us; if not we will not stir from this spot?\"    At length the end of the month arrived, and they all appeared together  before the magistrates, when they said: \"Let the scribe, Khamoisit,  who is accountable, be sent for!\" He was thereupon brought before the  notables of the town, and they said to him: \"See to the corn which thou  hast received, and give some of it to the people of the necropolis.\"  Pmontuniboisit was then sent for, and \"rations of wheat were given to  us daily.\" Famine was not caused only by the thriftlessness of the  multitude: administrators of all ranks did not hesitate to appropriate,  each one according to his position, a portion of the means entrusted  to them for the maintenance of their subordinates, and the latter often  received only instalments of what was due to them. The culprits often  escaped from their difficulties by either laying hold of half a dozen  of their brawling victims, or by yielding to them a proportion of  their ill-gotten gains, before a rumour of the outbreak could reach  head-quarters. It happened from time to time, however, when the  complaints against them were either too serious or too frequent, that  they were deprived of their functions, cited before the tribunals, and  condemned. What took place at Thebes was repeated with some variations  in each of the other large cities. Corruption, theft, and extortion had  prevailed among the officials from time immemorial, and the most active  kings alone were able to repress these abuses, or confine them within  narrow limits; as soon as discipline became relaxed, however, they began  to appear again, and we have no more convincing proof of the state of  decadence into which Thebes had fallen towards the middle of the XXth  dynasty, than the audacity of the crimes committed in the necropolis  during the reigns of the successors of Ramses III.    The priesthood of Amon alone displayed any vigour and enjoyed any  prosperity in the general decline. After the victory of the god over the  heretic kings no one dared to dispute his supremacy, and the Ramessides  displayed a devout humility before him and his ministers. Henceforward  he became united to Ra in a definite manner, and his authority not only  extended over the whole of the land of Egypt, but over all the countries  also which were brought within her influence; so that while Pharaoh  continued to be the greatest of kings, Pharaoh's god held a position  of undivided supremacy among the deities. He was the chief of the two  Bnneads, the Heliopolitan and the Hermopolitan, and displayed for  the latter a special affection; for the vague character of its eight  secondary deities only served to accentuate the position of the ninth  and principal divinity with whose primacy that of Amon was identified.  It was more easy to attribute to Amon the entire work of creation when  Shu, Sibu, Osiris, and Sit had been excluded--the deities whom the  theologians of Heliopolis had been accustomed to associate with the  demiurge; and in the hymns which they sang at his solemn festivals they  did not hesitate to ascribe to him all the acts which the priests of  former times had assigned to the Ennead collectively. \"He made earth,  silver, gold,--the true lapis at his good pleasure.--He brought forth  the herbs for the cattle, the plants upon which men live.--He made to  live the fish of the river,--the birds which hover in the air,--giving  air to those which are in the egg.--He animates the insects,--he makes  to live the small birds, the reptiles, and the gnats as well.--He  provides food for the rat in his hole,--supports the bird upon the  branch.--May he be blessed for all this, he who is alone, but with many  hands.\" \"Men spring from his two eyes,\" and quickly do they lose  their breath while acclaiming him--Egyptians and Libyans, Negroes and  Asiatics: \"Hail to thee!\" they all say; \"praise to thee because thou  dwellest amongst us!--Obeisances before thee because thou createst  us!\"--\"Thou art blessed by every living thing,--thou hast worshippers in  every place,--in the highest of the heavens, in all the breadth of  the earth,--in the depths of the seas.--The gods bow before thy  Majesty,--magnifying the souls which form them,--rejoicing at meeting  those who have begotten them,--they say to thee: 'Go in peace,--father  of the fathers of all the gods,--who suspended the heaven, levelled the  earth;--creator of beings, maker of things,--sovereign king, chief of  the gods,--we adore thy souls, because thou hast made us,--we lavish  offerings upon thee, because thou hast given us birth,--we shower  benedictions upon thee, because thou dwellest among us.'\" We have here  the same ideas as those which predominate in the hymns addressed to  Atonu,* and in the prayers directed to Phtah, the Nile, Shu, and the  Sun-god of Heliopolis at the same period.         * Breasted points out the decisive influence exercised by       the solar hymns of Amenothes IV. on the development of the       solar ideas contained in the hymns to Amon put forth or re-       edited in the XXIIIrd dynasty.    The idea of a single god, lord and maker of all things, continued to  prevail more and more throughout Egypt--not, indeed, among the lower  classes who persisted in the worship of their genii and their animals,  but among the royal family, the priests, the nobles, and people of  culture. The latter believed that the Sun-god had at length absorbed  all the various beings who had been manifested in the feudal divinities:  these, in fact, had surrendered their original characteristics in order  to become forms of the Sun, Amon as well as the others--and the new  belief displayed itself in magnifying the solar deity, but the solar  deity united with the Theban Amon, that is, Amon-Ra. The omnipotence of  this one god did not, however, exclude a belief in the existence of his  compeers; the theologians thought all the while that the beings to whom  ancient generations had accorded a complete independence in respect of  their rivals were nothing more than emanations from one supreme being.  If local pride forced them to apply to this single deity the designation  customarily used in their city--Phtah at Memphis, Anhuri-Shu at Thinis,  Khnumu in the neighbourhood of the first cataract--they were quite  willing to allow, at the same time, that these appellations were but  various masks for one face. Phtah, Hapi, Khnumu, Ra,--all the gods, in  fact,--were blended with each other, and formed but one deity--a unique  existence, multiple in his names, and mighty according to the importance  of the city in which he was worshipped. Hence Amon, lord of the capital  and patron of the dynasty, having more partisans, enjoyed more respect,  and, in a word, felt himself possessed of more claims to be the sole god  of Egypt than his brethren, who could not claim so many worshippers. He  did not at the outset arrogate to himself the same empire over the dead  as he exercised over the living;"]]]
