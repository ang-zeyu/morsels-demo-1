The student's back was toward them, and the Curator quite out of  sight behind a close-shut door.    With this doubt in his mind, Mr. Gryce started to approach the couple. As  he did so, he observed another curious fact concerning them. They were  neither of them in the place natural to people interested in the contents  of the great cases which they had crossed the hall to examine. Instead of  standing where a full view of these cases could be had, they had  withdrawn so far behind them that they presented the appearance of  persons in hiding. Yet as he drew nearer and noted their youth and  countrified appearance, Mr. Gryce was careful to assume his most benign  deportment and so to modulate his voice as to call up the pink into the  young woman's cheek and the deep red into the man's. What Mr. Gryce said  was this: \"You are interested I see in this show of old armor? I don't  wonder. It is very curious. Is this your first visit to the museum?\"    The man nodded; the woman lowered her head. Both were self-conscious to a  point painful to see.    \"It is a pity your first visit should be spoiled by anything so dreadful  as the accidental death of this young girl. It seems to have frightened  you both very much.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" muttered the man. \"We never saw anybody hurt before.\"    \"Did you know the young lady?\"    \"Oh, no; oh, no!\" they both hastened to cry out in a confused jumble,  after which the man added:    \"We--we're from up the river. We don't know anybody in this big town.\"    As he spoke, he began to edge away from the wall, the girl following.    \"Wait!\" smiled the detective. \"You are getting out of place. You were  looking at the armor when you first heard the hubbub over there?\"    Both were silent.    \"What were you looking at?\"    \"I was looking at her, and her was looking at me,\" stammered the man. \"We  were--were talking together here--we didn't notice----\"    \"Just married, eh?\"    \"Yesterday noon, sir. How--how did you know?\"    \"I didn't know; I only guessed. And I think I can guess something  else--what your reason was for stealing into this dark corner.\"    It was the man who now looked down, and the woman who looked up. In a  pinch of this kind, it is the woman who is the more courageous.    \"He was a-kissin' of me, sir,\" she whispered in a frank but shamefaced  way. \"There was no harm in that, was there? We're so fond of one another,  and how could we know that anyone was dying so near?\"    \"No, there was no harm,\" Mr. Gryce reluctantly admitted. Caught in an  absurdity amusing enough in its way, he would certainly under less  strenuous circumstances have rather enjoyed his own humiliation. But the  occasion was too serious and his part in it too pronounced for him to  take any pleasure in this misadventure. In the prosecution of so daring  a scheme for locating witnesses if not of discovering the actual user of  the bow, it would not do to fail. He _must_ find the man he sought. If  the Curator--but one glance into the room where that gentleman stood amid  a litter of prints satisfied him that Sweetwater was right as to the  impossibility of getting any information from this quarter. Nor could he  hope, remembering what he had himself seen, that he would succeed any  better with the last person now remaining on this floor--the young man  busy with the coins in No. I.    That he was to be so fortunate as to lay an immediate hand on the person  who had shot the fatal arrow was no longer regarded by him as among the  possibilities. Whoever this person was, he had found a way of escape  which rendered him for the time being safe from discovery. But there was  another possible miscalculation which he felt it his duty to recognize  before he proceeded further in his difficult task. The bow found back of  the tapestry had every appearance of being the one used for the delivery  of the arrow. But was it? Might it not, in some strange and unaccountable  way, have been flung there previous to the present event and by some hand  no longer in the building? Such coincidences have been known, and while  as a rule this old and experienced detective put little confidence in  coincidences of any kind, he had but one thought in mind in approaching  this final witness, which was to get from him some acknowledgment of  having seen, on or about the time of the accident, a movement in the  tapestry behind which this bow lay concealed. If once this fact could  be established, there could be no further question as to the direct  connection between the bow there found and the present crime.    But Mr. Gryce might have spared his pains, so far as this young man was  concerned. He had been so engrossed in his search for a particularly rare  coin, that he had had no eyes for anything beyond. Besides, he was  abnormally nearsighted, not being able, even with his glasses, to  distinguish faces at any distance, much less a movement in a piece of  tapestry.    All of this was discouraging, even if anticipated; but there were still  the people below, some one of whom might have seen what this man had not.  He would go down to them now, but by a course which would incidentally  enlighten him in regard to another matter about which he had some doubts.    In his goings to and fro through the hall, he had passed the open door of  Room H and noted how easily a direct flight could be made through it and  Rooms I and J to the small staircase running down at the rear. Whether or  not this explained the absence of anyone on this floor who by the utmost  stretch of imagination could be held responsible for the accident which  had occurred there, he felt it incumbent upon him to see in how short a  time the escape he still believed in could be made through these rooms.    Timing his steps from the pedestal nearest this end, he found that even  at his slow pace it took but three minutes for him to reach the arcade  leading into the court from the foot of the staircase. A man conscious of  wrong and eager to escape would do it in less; and if, as possibly  happened, he had to wait in the doorway of Room J till Correy and the boy  had cleared the way for him by their joint run into the farther gallery,  he would still have time to be well on his way to the lower floor before  the cry went up which shut off all further egress. Relieved, if not  contented with the prospect this gave of a new clue to his problem, he  reentered the court and was preparing to renew his investigations when  the arrival of the Coroner put a temporary end to his efforts as well as  to the impatience of the so-called pawns, who were now allowed, one and  all, to leave their posts.          V    THREE WHERE TWO SHOULD BE      It was a good half-hour before Mr. Gryce again found himself in a  position to pursue the line of investigation thus summarily interrupted.  The condition of Mrs. Taylor, which had not been improved by delay,  demanded attention, and it was with a sense of great relief that Mr.  Gryce finally saw her put into a taxi. Her hurried examination by Coroner  Price had elicited nothing new, and of all who had noticed her distraught  air on leaving the building, there was not one, if we except the  detective, but felt convinced that if she had not been of unsound mind  previous to this accident, she certainly had become so since. He still  held to his theory that her story, fantastic and out of character as it  seemed, was true in all its essentials, and that it was the warning she  believed herself to have received of her husband's death, rather than  what had taken place under her eyes, which had caused her such extreme  suffering and temporarily laid her reason low.    With the full approbation of the Coroner, to whom he had explained his  idea, Mr. Gryce began the sifting process by which he hoped to discover  the one witness he wanted.    To subject to further durance such persons as from their position at the  moment of tragedy could have no information to give bearing in any way  upon their investigation was manifestly unfair. The old woman who had  been found in Room A was of this class, and accordingly was allowed to  go, together with such others as had been within twenty feet or more of  the main entrance. These eliminated (it was curious to see how loath  these few chosen ones were to depart, now that the opportunity was given  them), Mr. Gryce settled down to business by asking Mrs. Lynch to come  forward.    She, as you will see by consulting the chart, answered to the person  marked \"2.\" A little, dried-up, eager woman rose from the bench on which  were collected the few people still remaining, and met his inquiring look  with a nervous smile. She, of all the persons moving about on the main  floor at the moment of alarm, had been in the best position for seeing  the flight of the arrow and the fall of the victim in Section II. Had she  seen them? The continued jigging of the small, wiry curls hanging out  from either side of her old-fashioned bonnet would seem to betray an  inner perturbation indicative of some hitherto suppressed information. At  all events Mr. Gryce allowed himself this hope and was most bland and  encouraging in his manner as he showed her the place which had been  assigned her on the chart drawn up by Sweetwater, and asked if the  position given her was correct.    Perhaps a ready reply was too much to expect--women of her stamp not  knowing, as a rule, very much about charts. But when he saw her hasten  to the very spot assigned her by Sweetwater, he took heart and with a  suggestive glance at the gallery intimated that he would be very glad to  hear what she had seen there. Her surprise was evident, much too evident  for his satisfaction. The little curls jigged about more than ever, and  her cheeks grew quite pink as she answered hastily:    \"I didn't see anything. I wasn't"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17766"],[0,"With Wolfe in Canada: The Winning of a Continent (#8)"],[1,"that he was younger  than his nephew, for he had expected to see a much older boy.    \"That is not the way to speak, sir,\" he said sternly, while the  constable pressed a warning hand on James's shoulder.    \"Well, sir, it's not true then,\" the boy said. \"It's all false from  beginning to end, except that I did strike him first; but I struck him,  not because he had thrown a great stone and broken my boat, but because  he pushed a little girl who was with me down into the water.\"    \"She slipped down. I never pushed her,\" Richard broke in.    \"Hold your tongue, sir,\" the squire said sternly. \"You have given your  evidence. I have now to hear what the accused has to say.    \"Now, tell your story.\"    James now gave his version of the affair.    When he had ended, Mr. Linthorne said gravely, \"Have you any witnesses  to call?\"    \"Yes, sir, there are two fishermen outside who saw it.\"    \"Bring them in,\" the magistrate said to the constable.    Not a word was spoken in the justice room until the constable returned.  As James had told his story, the magistrate had listened with  disbelief. It had not occurred to him that his nephew could have told a  lie, and he wondered at the calmness with which this boy told his  story. Why, were it true, Richard was a coward as well as a liar, for  with his superior age and height, he should have been able to thrash  this boy in a fair fight; yet James's face had not a mark, while his  nephew's showed how severely he had been punished.    But his eye fell upon Richard when James said that he had witnesses. He  saw an unmistakable look of terror come over his face, and the bitter  conviction flashed across him that James's story was the true one.    \"There is no occasion to give him the book, Hobson,\" he said, as the  constable was about to hand the Testament to one of the fishermen.  \"This is a private investigation, not a formal magisterial sitting, and  there is no occasion, at this stage, to take any evidence on oath.\"    \"What is your name, my man?\"    \"John Mullens, your honour.\"    \"Well, just tell me, Mullens, what you know about this business.\"    \"I was a-mending my nets, yer honour, along with Simon Harte, and young  Master Walsham was a-sailing his boat in a pool, along with the little  gal as lives at his mother's.\"    \"How far were you from the spot where he was?\" the squire asked.    \"Two hundred yards or so, I should say,\" the fisherman replied. \"We was  working behind a boat, but we could see over it well enough. Presently  we saw Master Horton come down, and stand alongside the others.    \"I said to Simon, 'He is a good-looking young fellow, is the squire's  nephew,'\" and the fisherman's eye twinkled with a grim humour, as he  glanced at Richard's swollen face.    \"The boat got stuck, and Master Walsham threw something in close to it  to get it off. Then I see Master Horton stoop, and pick up a chunk of  stone, and chuck it hard; and it hit the boat and knocked it over. I  see the little girl turn round and say something to Master Horton, and  then she put her apron up to her face and began to cry. He gave her a  sort of shove, and she tumbled down into the edge of the pool.    \"I says to Simon, 'What a shame!' but afore the words was out of my  mouth, Master Walsham he hits him, and hits him hard, too. Then there  was a fight, but Master Horton, he hadn't a chance with James, who gave  him as sound a licking as ever you see'd, and ending with knocking him  backwards into the pool. Then he gets up and shakes his fist at James,  and then goes off as hard as he could. That's all I know about it.\"    \"It's a wicked lie,\" Richard burst out. \"They have made it up between  them. There was nobody there.\"    \"Hold your tongue, sir, I tell you,\" the squire said, so sternly that  Richard, who had risen from his seat, shrank back again and remained  silent; while Simon Harte gave his evidence, which was almost identical  with that of the other fisherman.    \"Have you any other witnesses?\" the magistrate asked James.    \"Only the little girl, sir, but I did not bring her up. She is so  little, I thought it was better she should not come, but I can send for  her if you wish it.\"    \"It is not necessary,\" Mr. Linthorne said. \"I have heard quite  sufficient. The manner in which you and these fishermen have given your  evidence convinces me that you are speaking the truth, and I am sorry  that you should have been placed in this position. You will understand  that this is not a formal court, and therefore that there is no  question of discharging you. I can only say that, having heard the  story of what took place at this fight between you and my nephew, I am  convinced that you did what any other boy of spirit would have done,  under the same circumstances, and that the punishment which you  administered to him was thoroughly deserved.    \"Good morning!\"    James Walsham and his witnesses left the room. Mr. Linthorne rose, and  saying to his nephew, \"Follow me, sir,\" went to his study.    Without saying a word as to what had passed, he took down some books  from the shelves, and proceeded to examine Richard in them. A few  minutes sufficed to show that the boy was almost absolutely ignorant of  Latin, while a few questions in geography and history showed that he  was equally deficient in these also.    \"That will do,\" the squire said. \"Go up to your room, and remain there  until I send for you.\"    An hour after this a dog cart came round to the door. Mr. Robertson  took his place in it with his trunk, and was driven away to Exeter,  never to return.    For two days Richard remained a prisoner in his room. His meals were  brought up to him, but the servant who came with them answered no  questions, telling him that the squire's orders were that he was not to  hold any conversation with him. There was, indeed, a deep pleasure  among the servants at the Hall, at the knowledge that Richard Horton  was in disgrace. The exact circumstances of the affair were unknown,  for the fishermen had not been present when Richard had told his story,  and Mrs. Walsham, who was much shocked when James told her the  circumstances, had impressed upon him that it was better to say nothing  more about it.    \"You are clear in the matter, Jim, and that is enough for you. The  squire will, no doubt, punish his nephew for the wicked lies he has  told. Some day, you know, the boy will be master here. Don't let us set  everyone against him by telling this disgraceful story.\"    So, beyond the fact that there had been a fight between James Walsham  and the squire's nephew, and that Richard Horton had been thrashed, and  that the squire himself had said that it served him right, Sidmouth  knew nothing of what had taken place in the justice room.    Mr. Linthorne's first impulse had been to send his nephew at once back  to his parents, with the message that he would have nothing more to do  with him; but, though he had the reputation of being a stern man, the  squire was a very kind-hearted one. He was shocked to find that the boy  was a liar, and that, to shield himself, he had invented this falsehood  against his opponent; but upon reflection, he acknowledged that he  himself had been to blame in the matter. He had taken the boy into his  house, had assigned to him the position of his heir, and had paid no  further attention to him.    Unfortunately, the man he had selected as his tutor had proved false to  the trust. The boy had been permitted to run wild, his head was turned  with the change in his prospects, his faults had grown unchecked. It  was to be said for him that he had not intended, in the first place, to  bring his opponent into disgrace by making this false accusation  against him, for his tutor had acknowledged that he had said he did not  intend to tell him, or to take any step in the matter, and his position  of accuser had been, to some extent, forced upon him by the necessity  of his confirming the tale, which he had told to account for his being  thrashed by a boy smaller than himself.    Yes, it would be unfair upon the boy utterly to cast him off for this  first offence. He would give him one more trial.    The result of the squire's reflection was that, on the third day of his  imprisonment, Richard was sent for to the study. The squire did not  motion to him to sit down, and he remained standing with, as the squire  said to himself, a hang-dog look upon his face.    \"I have been thinking over this matter quietly, Richard, for I did not  wish to come to any hasty conclusion. My first impulse was to pack you  off home, and have no more to do with you, but I have thought better of  it. Mean and despicable as your conduct has been, I take some blame to  myself, for not having seen that your tutor did his duty by you.  Therefore, I have resolved to give you another chance, but not here. I  could not bear to have a boy, who has proved himself a despicable liar,  about me; but I will try and think that this was a first offence, and  that the lesson which it has taught you may influence all your future  life, and that you may yet grow up an honourable man.    \"But you will remember that, henceforth, you are on trial, and that the  position in which you will stand by my will, will depend solely and  entirely on your own conduct. If you prove, by that, that this lesson  has had its effect, that you deeply repent of your conduct, and are  resolved to do your best to be henceforth straight, honourable, and  true, you will, at my death, occupy the position I have intended for  you. If not, not one single penny of my money will you get. I am going  to put you in a school where you will be looked strictly after, and  where you will have every chance of retrieving yourself. I have just  written to a friend of mine, a post captain in his majesty's service,  asking him to receive you as a midshipman. I have told him frankly that  you have been somewhat over indulged, and that the discipline "]]]
