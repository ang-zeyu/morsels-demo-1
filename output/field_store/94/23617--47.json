Till  1369 all was poverty and internal disunion; the feud, to be so often  renewed, of the Douglas and the Steward raged.  David was made  contemptible by a second marriage with Margaret Logie, but the war with  France drove Edward III. to accept a fourteen years' truce with Scotland.  On February 22, 1371, David died in Edinburgh Castle, being succeeded,  without opposition, by the Steward, Robert II., son of Walter, and of  Marjorie, daughter of Robert Bruce.  This Robert II., somewhat outworn by  many years of honourable war in his country's cause, and the father of a  family, by Elizabeth Mure of Rowallan, which could hardly be rendered  legitimate by any number of Papal dispensations, _was the first of the  Royal Stewart line_.  In him a cadet branch of the English FitzAlans,  themselves of a very ancient Breton stock, blossomed into Royalty.        PARLIAMENT AND THE CROWN.      With the coming of a dynasty which endured for three centuries, we must  sketch the relations, in Scotland, of Crown and Parliament till the days  of the Covenant and the Revolution of 1688.  Scotland had but little of  the constitutional evolution so conspicuous in the history of England.  The reason is that while the English kings, with their fiefs and wars in  France, had constantly to be asking their parliaments for money, and  while Parliament first exacted the redress of grievances, in Scotland the  king was expected \"to live of his own\" on the revenue of crown-lands,  rents, feudal aids, fines exacted in Courts of Law, and duties on  merchandise.  No \"tenths\" or \"fifteenths\" were exacted from clergy and  people.  There could be no \"constitutional resistance\" when the Crown  made no unconstitutional demands.    In Scotland the germ of Parliament is the King's court of vassals of the  Crown.  To the assemblies, held now in one place, now in another, would  usually come the vassals of the district, with such officers of state as  the Chancellor, the Chamberlain, the Steward, the Constable or Commander-  in-Chief, the Justiciar, and the Marischal, and such Bishops, Abbots,  Priors, Earls, Barons, and tenants-in-chief as chose to attend.  At these  meetings public business was done, charters were granted, and statutes  were passed; assent was made to such feudal aids as money for the king's  ransom in the case of William the Lion.  In 1295 the seals of six Royal  burghs are appended to the record of a negotiation; in 1326 burgesses, as  we saw, were consulted by Bruce on questions of finance.    The misfortunes and extravagance of David II. had to be paid for, and  Parliament interfered with the Royal prerogative in coinage and currency,  directed the administration of justice, dictated terms of peace with  England, called to account even hereditary officers of the Crown (such as  the Steward, Constable, and Marischal), controlled the King's expenditure  (or tried to do so), and denounced the execution of Royal warrants  against the Statutes and common form of law.  They summarily rejected  David's attempt to alter the succession of the Crown.    At the same time, as attendance of multitudes during protracted  Parliaments was irksome and expensive, arose the habit of intrusting  business to a mere \"Committee of Articles,\" later \"The Lords of the  Articles,\" selected in varying ways from the Three Estates--Spiritual,  Noble, and Commons.  These Committees saved the members of Parliament  from the trouble and expense of attendance, but obviously tended to  become an abuse, being selected and packed to carry out the designs of  the Crown or of the party of nobles in power.  All members, of whatever  Estate, sat together in the same chamber.  There were no elected Knights  of the Shires, no representative system.    The reign of David II. saw two Scottish authors or three, whose works are  extant.  Barbour wrote the chivalrous rhymed epic-chronicle 'The Brus';  Wyntoun, an unpoetic rhymed \"cronykil\"; and \"Hucheoun of the Awle Ryal\"  produced works of more genius, if all that he is credited with be his  own.          CHAPTER X.  EARLY STEWART KINGS: ROBERT II.  (1371-1390).      Robert II. was crowned at Scone on March 26, 1371.  He was elderly,  jovial, pacific, and had little to fear from England when the deaths of  Edward III. and the Black Prince left the crown to the infant Richard II.  There was fighting against isolated English castles within the Scottish  border, to amuse the warlike Douglases and Percies, and there were  truces, irregular and ill kept.  In 1384 great English and Scottish raids  were made, and gentlemen of France, who came over for sport, were  scurvily entertained, and (1385) saw more plundering than honest fighting  under James, Earl of Douglas, who merely showed them an army that, under  Richard II., burned Melrose Abbey and fired Edinburgh, Perth, and Dundee.  Edinburgh was a town of 400 houses.  Richard insisted that not more than  a third of his huge force should be English Borderers, who had no idea of  hitting their Scottish neighbours, fathers-in-law and brothers-in-law,  too hard.  The one famous fight, that of Otterburn (August 15, 1388), was  a great and joyous passage of arms by moonlight.  The Douglas fell, the  Percy was led captive away; the survivors gained advancement in renown  and the hearty applause of the chivalrous chronicler, Froissart.  The  oldest ballads extant on this affair were current in 1550, and show  traces of the reading of Froissart and the English chroniclers.    In 1390 died Robert II.  Only his youth was glorious.  The reign of his  son, Robert III. (crowned August 14, 1390), was that of a weakling who  let power fall into the hands of his brother, the Duke of Albany, or his  son David, Duke of Rothesay, who held the reins after the Parliament (a  Parliament that bitterly blamed the Government) of January 1399.  (With  these two princes the title of Duke first appears in Scotland.)  The  follies of young David alienated all: he broke his betrothal to the  daughter of the Earl of March; March retired to England, becoming the man  of Henry IV.; and though Rothesay wedded the daughter of the Earl of  Douglas, he was arrested by Albany and Douglas and was starved to death  (or died of dysentery) in Falkland Castle (1402).  The Highlanders had  been in anarchy throughout the reign; their blood was let in the great  clan duel of thirty against thirty, on the Inch of Perth, in 1396.  Probably clans Cameron and Chattan were the combatants.    On Rothesay's death Albany was Governor, while Douglas was taken prisoner  in the great Border defeat of Homildon Hill, not far from Flodden.  But  then (1403) came the alliance of Douglas with Percy; Percy's quarrel with  Henry IV. and their defeat; and Hotspur's death, Douglas's capture at  Shrewsbury.  Between Shakespeare, in \"Henry IV.,\" and Scott, in 'The Fair  Maid of Perth,' the most notable events in the reign of Robert III. are  immortalised.  The King's last misfortune was the capture by the English  at sea, on the way to France, of his son James in February-March 1406.  {52}  On April 4, 1406, Robert went to his rest, one of the most unhappy  of the fated princes of his line.        THE REGENCY OF ALBANY.      The Regency of Albany, uncle of the captured James, lasted for fourteen  years, ending with his death in 1420.  He occasionally negotiated for his  king's release, but more successfully for that of his son Murdoch.  That  James suspected Albany's ambition, and was irritated by his conduct,  appears in his letters, written in Scots, to Albany and to Douglas,  released in 1408, and now free in Scotland.  The letters are of 1416.    The most important points to note during James's English captivity are  the lawlessness and oppression which prevailed in Scotland, and the  beginning of Lollard heresies, nascent Protestantism, nascent Socialism,  even \"free love.\"  The Parliament of 1399, which had inveighed against  the laxity of Government under Robert II., also demanded the extirpation  of heresies, in accordance with the Coronation Oath.  One Resby, a  heretical English priest, was arraigned and burned at Perth in 1407,  under Laurence of Lindores, the Dominican Inquisitor into heresies, who  himself was active in promoting Scotland's oldest University, St Andrews.  The foundation was by Henry Wardlaw, Bishop of St Andrews, by virtue of a  bull from the anti-pope Benedict XIII., of February 1414.  Lollard ideas  were not suppressed; the chronicler, Bower, speaks of their existence in  1445; they sprang from envy of the wealth, and indignation against the  corruptions of the clergy, and the embers of Lollardism in Kyle were not  cold when, under James V., the flame of the Reformation was rekindled.    The Celtic North, never quiet, made its last united effort in 1411, when  Donald, Lord of the Isles, who was in touch with the English Government,  claimed the earldom of Ross, in right of his wife, as against the Earl of  Buchan, a son of Albany; mustered all the wild clans of the west and the  isles at Ardtornish Castle on the Sound of Mull; marched through Ross to  Dingwall; defeated the great northern clan of Mackay, and was hurrying to  sack Aberdeen when he was met by Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar, the  gentry of the northern Lowlands, mounted knights, and the burgesses of  the towns, some eighteen miles from Aberdeen, at Harlaw.  There was a  pitched battle with great slaughter, but the Celts had no cavalry, and  the end was that Donald withdrew to his fastnesses.  The event is  commemorated by an old literary ballad, and in Elspeth's ballad in  Scott's novel, 'The Antiquary.'    In the year of Albany's death, at a great age (1420), in compliance with  the prayer of Charles VII. of France, the Earl of Buchan, Archibald,  Douglas's eldest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1597"],[0,"Andersen's Fairy Tales (#8)"],[1,"see already, by the foregoing effusion, that he is become a poet; to  give further proof of it, however, would in most cases be insipid, for  it is a most foolish notion to fancy a poet different from other men.  Among the latter there may be far more poetical natures than many an  acknowledged poet, when examined more closely, could boast of; the  difference only is, that the poet possesses a better mental memory, on  which account he is able to retain the feeling and the thought till they  can be embodied by means of words; a faculty which the others do not  possess. But the transition from a commonplace nature to one that is  richly endowed, demands always a more or less breakneck leap over a  certain abyss which yawns threateningly below; and thus must the sudden  change with the clerk strike the reader.    \"The sweet air!\" continued he of the police-office, in his dreamy  imaginings; \"how it reminds me of the violets in the garden of my aunt  Magdalena! Yes, then I was a little wild boy, who did not go to school  very regularly. O heavens! 'tis a long time since I have thought on  those times. The good old soul! She lived behind the Exchange. She  always had a few twigs or green shoots in water--let the winter rage  without as it might. The violets exhaled their sweet breath, whilst I  pressed against the windowpanes covered with fantastic frost-work the  copper coin I had heated on the stove, and so made peep-holes.  What splendid vistas were then opened to my view! What change--what  magnificence! Yonder in the canal lay the ships frozen up, and deserted  by their whole crews, with a screaming crow for the sole occupant. But  when the spring, with a gentle stirring motion, announced her arrival,  a new and busy life arose; with songs and hurrahs the ice was sawn  asunder, the ships were fresh tarred and rigged, that they might sail  away to distant lands. But I have remained here--must always remain  here, sitting at my desk in the office, and patiently see other people  fetch their passports to go abroad. Such is my fate! Alas!\"--sighed he,  and was again silent. \"Great Heaven! What is come to me! Never have I  thought or felt like this before! It must be the summer air that affects  me with feelings almost as disquieting as they are refreshing.\"    He felt in his pocket for the papers. \"These police-reports will soon  stem the torrent of my ideas, and effectually hinder any rebellious  overflowing of the time-worn banks of official duties\"; he said to  himself consolingly, while his eye ran over the first page. \"DAME  TIGBRITH, tragedy in five acts.\" \"What is that? And yet it is undeniably  my own handwriting. Have I written the tragedy? Wonderful, very  wonderful!--And this--what have I here? 'INTRIGUE ON THE RAMPARTS; or  THE DAY OF REPENTANCE: vaudeville with new songs to the most favorite  airs.' The deuce! Where did I get all this rubbish? Some one must have  slipped it slyly into my pocket for a joke. There is too a letter to me;  a crumpled letter and the seal broken.\"    Yes; it was not a very polite epistle from the manager of a theatre, in  which both pieces were flatly refused.    \"Hem! hem!\" said the clerk breathlessly, and quite exhausted he seated  himself on a bank. His thoughts were so elastic, his heart so tender;  and involuntarily he picked one of the nearest flowers. It is a simple  daisy, just bursting out of the bud. What the botanist tells us after  a number of imperfect lectures, the flower proclaimed in a minute. It  related the mythus of its birth, told of the power of the sun-light that  spread out its delicate leaves, and forced them to impregnate the air  with their incense--and then he thought of the manifold struggles of  life, which in like manner awaken the budding flowers of feeling in our  bosom. Light and air contend with chivalric emulation for the love of  the fair flower that bestowed her chief favors on the latter; full of  longing she turned towards the light, and as soon as it vanished, rolled  her tender leaves together and slept in the embraces of the air. \"It is  the light which adorns me,\" said the flower.    \"But 'tis the air which enables thee to breathe,\" said the poet's voice.    Close by stood a boy who dashed his stick into a wet ditch. The drops of  water splashed up to the green leafy roof, and the clerk thought of the  million of ephemera which in a single drop were thrown up to a height,  that was as great doubtless for their size, as for us if we were to  be hurled above the clouds. While he thought of this and of the whole  metamorphosis he had undergone, he smiled and said, \"I sleep and dream;  but it is wonderful how one can dream so naturally, and know besides so  exactly that it is but a dream. If only to-morrow on awaking, I could  again call all to mind so vividly! I seem in unusually good spirits; my  perception of things is clear, I feel as light and cheerful as though  I were in heaven; but I know for a certainty, that if to-morrow a dim  remembrance of it should swim before my mind, it will then seem nothing  but stupid nonsense, as I have often experienced already--especially  before I enlisted under the banner of the police, for that dispels like  a whirlwind all the visions of an unfettered imagination. All we hear  or say in a dream that is fair and beautiful is like the gold of the  subterranean spirits; it is rich and splendid when it is given us, but  viewed by daylight we find only withered leaves. Alas!\" he sighed quite  sorrowful, and gazed at the chirping birds that hopped contentedly from  branch to branch, \"they are much better off than I! To fly must be a  heavenly art; and happy do I prize that creature in which it is innate.  Yes! Could I exchange my nature with any other creature, I fain would be  such a happy little lark!\"    He had hardly uttered these hasty words when the skirts and sleeves  of his coat folded themselves together into wings; the clothes became  feathers, and the galoshes claws. He observed it perfectly, and laughed  in his heart. \"Now then, there is no doubt that I am dreaming; but I  never before was aware of such mad freaks as these.\" And up he flew into  the green roof and sang; but in the song there was no poetry, for the  spirit of the poet was gone. The Shoes, as is the case with anybody who  does what he has to do properly, could only attend to one thing at a  time. He wanted to be a poet, and he was one; he now wished to be a  merry chirping bird: but when he was metamorphosed into one, the former  peculiarities ceased immediately. \"It is really pleasant enough,\" said  he: \"the whole day long I sit in the office amid the driest  law-papers, and at night I fly in my dream as a lark in the gardens of  Fredericksburg; one might really write a very pretty comedy upon it.\" He  now fluttered down into the grass, turned his head gracefully on every  side, and with his bill pecked the pliant blades of grass, which, in  comparison to his present size, seemed as majestic as the palm-branches  of northern Africa.    Unfortunately the pleasure lasted but a moment. Presently black night  overshadowed our enthusiast, who had so entirely missed his part of  copying-clerk at a police-office; some vast object seemed to be thrown  over him. It was a large oil-skin cap, which a sailor-boy of the quay  had thrown over the struggling bird; a coarse hand sought its way  carefully in under the broad rim, and seized the clerk over the back  and wings. In the first moment of fear, he called, indeed, as loud as  he could--\"You impudent little blackguard! I am a copying-clerk at  the police-office; and you know you cannot insult any belonging to the  constabulary force without a chastisement. Besides, you good-for-nothing  rascal, it is strictly forbidden to catch birds in the royal gardens of  Fredericksburg; but your blue uniform betrays where you come from.\"  This fine tirade sounded, however, to the ungodly sailor-boy like a mere  \"Pippi-pi.\" He gave the noisy bird a knock on his beak, and walked on.    He was soon met by two schoolboys of the upper class--that is to say as  individuals, for with regard to learning they were in the lowest class  in the school; and they bought the stupid bird. So the copying-clerk  came to Copenhagen as guest, or rather as prisoner in a family living in  Gother Street.    \"'Tis well that I'm dreaming,\" said the clerk, \"or I really should get  angry. First I was a poet; now sold for a few pence as a lark; no doubt  it was that accursed poetical nature which has metamorphosed me  into such a poor harmless little creature. It is really pitiable,  particularly when one gets into the hands of a little blackguard,  perfect in all sorts of cruelty to animals: all I should like to know  is, how the story will end.\"    The two schoolboys, the proprietors now of the transformed clerk,  carried him into an elegant room. A stout stately dame received them  with a smile; but she expressed much dissatisfaction that a common  field-bird, as she called the lark, should appear in such high society.  For to-day, however, she would allow it; and they must shut him in the  empty cage that was standing in the window. \"Perhaps he will amuse my  good Polly,\" added the lady, looking with a benignant smile at a large  green parrot that swung himself backwards and forwards most comfortably  in his ring, inside a magnificent brass-wired cage. \"To-day is Polly's  birthday,\" said she with stupid simplicity: \"and the little brown  field-bird must wish him joy.\"    Mr. Polly uttered not a syllable in reply, but swung to and fro with  dignified condescension; while a pretty canary, as yellow as gold, that  had lately been brought from his sunny fragrant home, began to sing  aloud.    \"Noisy creature! Will you be quiet!\" screamed the lady of the house,  covering the cage with an embroidered white pocket handkerchief.    \"Chirp, chirp!\" sighed he. \"That was a dreadful snowstorm\"; and he  sighed again, and was "]]]
