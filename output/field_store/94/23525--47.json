Yet now that the chafing dish has come back to stay,  there's a flurry in the Rabbit warren and the new cooking  encyclopedias give up to a dozen variants. Actually there are easily  half a gross of valid ones in current esteem.    The two basic recipes are differentiated by the liquid ingredient, but  both the beer and the milk are used only one way--warm, or anyway at  room temperature. And again for the two, there is but one traditional  cheese--Cheddar, ripe, old or merely aged from six months onward. This  is also called American, store, sharp, Rabbit, yellow, beer, Wisconsin  Longhorn, mouse, and even rat.    The seasoned, sapid Cheddar-type, so indispensable, includes dozens of  varieties under different names, regional or commercial. These are  easily identified as sisters-under-the-rinds by all five senses:         sight: Golden yellow and mellow to the eye. It's one of those       round cheeses that also tastes round in the mouth.         hearing: By thumping, a cheese-fancier, like a melon-picker,       can tell if a Cheddar is rich, ripe and ready for the Rabbit.       When you hear your dealer say, \"It's six months old or more,\"       enough said.         smell: A scent as fresh as that of the daisies and herbs the       mother milk cow munched \"will hang round it still.\" Also a slight       beery savor.         touch: Crumbly--a caress to the fingers.         taste: The quintessence of this fivefold test. Just cuddle a       crumb with your tongue and if it tickles the taste buds it's       prime. When it melts in your mouth, that's proof it will melt in       the pan.    Beyond all this (and in spite of the school that plumps for the No. 2  temperance alternative) we must point out that beer has a special  affinity for Cheddar. The French have clearly established this in  their names for Welsh Rabbit, _Fromage Fondue a la Biere_ and _Fondue  a l'Anglaise_.    To prepare such a cheese for the pan, each Rabbit hound may have a  preference all his own, for here the question comes up of how it melts  best. Do you shave, slice, dice, shred, mince, chop, cut, scrape or  crumble it in the fingers? This will vary according to one's  temperament and the condition of the cheese. Generally, for best  results it is coarsely grated. When it comes to making all this into a  rare bit of Rabbit there is:      The One and Only Method    Use a double boiler, or preferably a chafing dish, avoiding aluminum  and other soft metals. Heat the upper pan by simmering water in the  lower one, but don't let the water boil up or touch the top pan.    Most, but not all, Rabbits are begun by heating a bit of butter or  margarine in the pan in which one cup of roughly grated cheese,  usually sharp Cheddar, is melted and mixed with one-half cup of  liquid, added gradually. (The butter isn't necessary for a cheese that  should melt by itself.)    The two principal ingredients are melted smoothly together and kept  from curdling by stirring steadily in one direction only, over an even  heat. The spoon used should be of hard wood, sterling silver or  porcelain. Never use tin, aluminum or soft metal--the taste may come  off to taint the job.    Be sure the liquid is at room temperature, or warmer, and add it  gradually, without interrupting the stirring. Do not let it come to  the bubbling point, and never let it boil.    Add seasonings only when the cheese is melted, which will take two or  three minutes. Then continue to stir in the same direction without an  instant's letup, for maybe ten minutes or more, until the Rabbit is  smooth. The consistency and velvety smoothness depend a good deal on  whether or not an egg, or a beaten yolk, is added.    The hotter the Rabbit is served, the better. You can sizzle the top  with a salamander or other branding iron, but in any case set it forth  as nearly sizzling as possible, on toast hellishly hot, whether it's  browned or buttered on one side or both.    Give a thought to the sad case of the \"little dog whose name was  Rover, and when he was dead he was dead all over.\" Something very  similar happens with a Rabbit that's allowed to cool down--when it's  cold it's cold all over, and you can't resuscitate it by heating.      BASIC WELSH RABBIT     No. 1 (with beer)    2 tablespoons butter  3 cups grated old Cheddar  1/2 teaspoon English dry mustard  1/2 teaspoon salt  A dash of cayenne  1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce  2 egg yolks, lightly beaten with  1/2 cup light beer or ale  4 slices hot buttered toast         Over boiling water melt butter and cheese together, stirring       steadily with a wooden (or other tasteless) spoon in one       direction only. Add seasonings and do not interrupt your rhythmic       stirring, as you pour in a bit at a time of the beer-and-egg       mixture until it's all used up.         It may take many minutes of constant stirring to achieve the       essential creamy thickness and then some more to slick it out as       smooth as velvet.         Keep it piping hot but don't let it bubble, for a boiled Rabbit       is a spoiled Rabbit. Only unremitting stirring (and the best of       cheese) will keep it from curdling, getting stringy or rubbery.       Pour the Rabbit generously over crisp, freshly buttered toast       and serve instantly on hot plates.    Usually crusts are cut off the bread before toasting, and some  aesthetes toast one side only, spreading the toasted side with cold  butter for taste contrast. Lay the toast on the hot plate, buttered  side down, and pour the Rabbit over the porous untoasted side so it  can soak in. (This is recommended in Lady Llanover's recipe, which  appears on page 52 of this book.)    Although the original bread for Rabbit toast was white, there is now  no limit in choice among whole wheat, graham, rolls, muffins, buns,  croutons and crackers, to infinity.       No. 2 (with milk)    For a rich milk Rabbit use 1/2 cup thin cream, evaporated milk,  whole milk or buttermilk, instead of beer as in No. 1. Then, to  keep everything bland, cut down the mustard by half or leave  it out, and use paprika in place of cayenne. As in No. 1, the  use of Worcestershire sauce is optional, although our feeling is  that any spirited Rabbit would resent its being left out.    Either of these basic recipes can be made without eggs, and more  cheaply, although the beaten egg is a guarantee against stringiness.  When the egg is missing, we are sad to record that a teaspoon or so of  cornstarch generally takes its place.    Rabbiteers are of two minds about fast and slow heating and stirring,  so you'll have to adjust that to your own experience and rhythm. As a  rule, the heat is reduced when the cheese is almost melted, and speed  of stirring slows when the eggs and last ingredients go in.    Many moderns who have found that monosodium glutamate steps up the  flavor of natural cheese, put it in at the start, using one-half  teaspoon for each cup of grated Cheddar. When it comes to pepper you  are fancy-free. As both black and white pepper are now held in almost  equal esteem, you might equip your hutch with twin hand-mills to do  the grinding fresh, for this is always worth the trouble. Tabasco  sauce is little used and needs a cautious hand, but some addicts can't  leave it out any more than they can swear off the Worcestershire.    The school that plumps for malty Rabbits and the other that goes for  milky ones are equally emphatic in their choice. So let us consider  the compromise of our old friend Frederick Philip Stieff, the  Baltimore _homme de bouche_, as he set it forth for us years ago in  _10,000 Snacks_: \"The idea of cooking a Rabbit with beer is an  exploded and dangerous theory. Tap your keg or open your case of ale  or beer and serve _with_, not in your Rabbit.\"       The Stieff Recipe BASIC MILK RABBIT (_completely  surrounded by a lake of malt beverages_)    2 cups grated sharp cheese  3 heaping tablespoons butter  1-1/2 cups milk  4 eggs  1 heaping tablespoon mustard  2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce  Pepper, salt and paprika to taste--then add more of each.         Grease well with butter the interior of your double boiler so       that no hard particles of cheese will form in the mixture later       and contribute undesirable lumps.         Put cheese, well-grated, into the double boiler and add butter       and milk. From this point vigorous stirring should be indulged in       until Rabbit is ready for serving.         Prepare a mixture of Worcestershire sauce, mustard, pepper, salt       and paprika. These should be beaten until light and then slowly       poured into the double boiler. Nothing now remains to be done       except to stir and cook down to proper consistency over a fairly       slow flame. The finale has not arrived until you can drip the       rabbit from the spoon and spell the word _finis_ on the surface.       Pour over two pieces of toast per plate and send anyone home who       does not attack it at once.         This is sufficient for six gourmets or four gourmands.    _Nota bene_: A Welsh Rabbit, to be a success, should never be of the  consistency whereby it may be used to tie up bundles, nor yet should  it bounce if inadvertently dropped on the kitchen floor.       Lady Llanover's Toasted Welsh Rabbit         Cut a slice of the real Welsh cheese made of sheep's and cow's       milk; toast it at the fire on both sides, but not so much as to       drop (melt). Toast on one side a piece of bread less than 1/4       inch thick, to be quite crisp, and spread it very thinly with       fresh, cold butter on the toasted side. (It must not be       saturated.) Lay the toasted cheese upon the untoasted bread side       and serve immediately on a very hot plate.

It has a temporary sufficient-to-the-day-for-to-morrow-we-die air.  It looks like a military post that at any moment might be abandoned.  To remove this impression the State has certain exhibits which seem  to point to a stable and good government. There is a well-conducted  hospital and clean, well-built barracks; for the amusement of the  black soldiers even a theatre, and for the higher officials  attractive bungalows, a bandstand, where twice a week a negro band  plays by ear, and plays exceedingly well. There is even a  lawn-tennis court, where the infrequent visitor to the Congo is  welcomed, and, by the courteous Mr. Vandamme, who plays tennis as  well as he does every thing else, entertained. Boma is the shop  window of Leopold's big store. The good features of Boma are like  those attractive articles one sometimes sees in a shop window, but  which in the shop one fails to find--at least, I did not find them  in the shop. Outside of Boma I looked in vain for a school  conducted by the State, like the one at Boma, such as those the  United States Government gave by the hundred to the Philippines. I  found not one. And I looked for such a hospital as the one I saw at  Boma, such as our government has placed for its employes along, and  at both ends of, the Isthmus of Panama, and, except for the one at  Leopoldville, I saw none.    In spite of the fact that Boma is a \"European watering-place,\" all  the servants of the State with whom I talked wanted to get away from  it, especially those who already had served in the interior. To  appreciate what Boma lacks one has only to visit the neighboring  seaports on the same coast; the English towns of Sierra Leone and  Calabar, the French town of Libreville in the French Congo, the  German seaport Duala in the Cameroons, but especially Calabar in  Southern Nigeria. In actual existence the new Calabar is eight years  younger than Boma, and in its municipal government, its  street-making, cleaning, and lighting, wharfs, barracks, prisons,  hospitals, it is a hundred years in advance. Boma is not a capital;  it is the distributing factory for a huge trading concern, and a  particularly selfish one. There is, as I have said, only one wharf,  and at that wharf, without paying the State, only State boats may  discharge cargo, so the English, Dutch, and German boats are forced  to \"tie up\" along the river front. There the grass is eight feet  high and breeds mosquitoes and malaria, and conceals the wary  crocodile. At night, from the deck of the steamer, all one can see  of this capital is a fringe of this high grass in the light from the  air ports, and on shore three gas-lamps. No cafes are open, no  sailors carouse, no lighted window suggests that some one is giving  a dinner, that some one is playing bridge. Darkness, gloom, silence  mark this \"European watering-place.\"    \"You ask me,\" demanded a Belgian lieutenant one night as we stood  together by the rail, \"whether I like better the bush, where there  is no white man in a hundred miles, or to be stationed at Boma?\"    He threw out his hands at the gas-lamps, rapidly he pointed at each  of them in turn.    \"Voila, Boma!\" he said.    From Boma we steamed six hours farther up the river to Matadi. On  the way we stopped at Noqui, the home of Portuguese traders on the  Portuguese bank, which, as one goes up-stream, lies to starboard.  Here the current runs at from four to five miles an hour, and has so  sharply cut away the bank that we are able to run as near to it with  the stern of our big ship as though she were a canoe. To one used  more to ocean than to Congo traffic it was somewhat bewildering to  see the five-thousand-ton steamer make fast to a tree, a sand-bank  looming up three fathoms off her quarter, and the blades of her  propeller, as though they were the knives of a lawn-mower, cutting  the eel-grass.    At Matadi the Congo makes one of her lightning changes. Her banks,  which have been low and woody, with, on the Portuguese side,  glimpses of boundless plateaux, become towering hills of rock. At  Matadi the cataracts and rapids begin, and for two hundred miles  continue to Stanley Pool, which is the beginning of the Upper Congo.  Leopoldville is situated on Stanley Pool, just to the right of where  the rapids start their race to the south. With Leopoldville above  and Boma below, still nearer the mouth of the river, Matadi makes a  centre link in the chain of the three important towns of the Lower  Congo.    When Henry M. Stanley was halted by the cataracts and forced to  leave the river he disembarked his expedition on the bank opposite  Matadi, and a mile farther up-stream. It was from this point he  dragged and hauled his boats, until he again reached smooth water at  Stanley Pool. The wagons on which he carried the boats still can be  seen lying on the bank, broken and rusty. Like the sight of old gun  carriages and dismantled cannon, they give one a distinct thrill.  Now, on the bank opposite from where they lie, the railroad runs  from Matadi to Leopoldville.    The Congo forces upon one a great admiration for Stanley. Unless  civilization utterly alters it, it must always be a monument to his  courage, and as you travel farther and see the difficulties placed  in his way, your admiration increases. There are men here who make  little of what Stanley accomplished; but they are men who seldom  leave their own compound, and, who, when they do go up the river,  travel at ease, not in a canoe, or on foot through the jungle, but  in the smoking-room of the steamer and in a first-class railroad  carriage. That they are able so to travel is due to the man they  would belittle. The nickname given to Stanley by the natives is  to-day the nickname of the government. Matadi means rock. When  Stanley reached the town of Matadi, which is surrounded entirely by  rock, he began with dynamite to blast roads for his caravan. The  natives called him Bula Matadi, the Breaker of Rocks, and, as in  those days he was the Government, the Law, and the Prophets, Bula  Matadi, who then was the white man who governed, now signifies the  white man's government. But it is a very different government, and a  very different white man. With the natives the word is universal.  They say \"Bula Matadi wood post.\" \"Not traders' chop, Bula Matadi's  chop.\" \"Him no missionary steamer, him Bula Matadi steamer.\"    The town of Matadi is of importance as the place where, owing to the  rapids, passengers and cargoes are reshipped on the railroad to the  _haut Congo_. It is a railroad terminus only, and it looks it. The  railroad station and store-houses are close to the river bank, and,  spread over several acres of cinders, are the railroad yard and  machine shops. Above those buildings of hot corrugated zinc and the  black soil rises a great rock. It is not so large as Gibraltar, or  so high as the Flatiron Building, but it is a little more steep than  either. Three narrow streets lead to its top. They are of flat  stones, with cement gutters. The stones radiate the heat of stove  lids. They are worn to a mirror-like smoothness, and from their  surface the sun strikes between your eyes, at the pit of your  stomach, and the soles of your mosquito boots. The three streets  lead to a parade ground no larger than and as bare as a brickyard.  It is surrounded by the buildings of Bula Matadi, the post-office,  the custom-house, the barracks, and the Cafe Franco-Belge. It has a  tableland fifty yards wide of yellow clay so beaten by thousands of  naked feet, so baked by the heat, that it is as hard as a brass  shield. Other tablelands may be higher, but this is the one nearest  the sun. You cross it wearily, in short rushes, with your heart in  your throat, and seeking shade, as a man crossing the zone of fire  seeks cover from the bullets. When you reach the cool, dirty  custom-house, with walls two feet thick, you congratulate yourself  on your escape; you look back into the blaze of the flaming plaza  and wonder if you have the courage to return.     [Illustration: Bush Boys in the Plaza at Matadi Seeking Shade.]    At the custom-house I paid duty on articles I could not possibly  have bought anywhere in the Congo, as, for instance, a tent and a  folding-bed, and for a license to carry arms. A young man with a  hammer and tiny branding irons beat little stars and the number of  my license to _porter d'armes_ on the stock of each weapon. Without  permission of Bula Matadi on leaving the Congo, one can not sell his  guns, or give them away. This is a precaution to prevent weapons  falling into the hands of the native. For some reason a native with  a gun alarms Bula Matadi. Just on the other bank of the river the  French, who do not seem to fear the black brother, sell him  flint-lock rifles, as many as his heart desires.    On the steamer there was a mild young missionary coming out, for the  first time, to whom some unobserving friend had given a fox-terrier.  The young man did not care for the dog. He had never owned a dog,  and did not know what to do with this one. Her name was \"Fanny,\"  and only by the efforts of all on board did she reach the Congo  alive. There was no one, from the butcher to the captain, including  the passengers, who had not shielded Fanny from the cold, and later  from the sun, fed her, bathed her, forced medicine down her throat,  and raced her up and down the spar deck. Consequently we all knew  Fanny, and it was a great shock when from the custom-house I saw her  running around the blazing parade ground, her eyes filled with fear  and \"lost dog\" written all over her, from her drooping tongue to her  drooping tail. Captain Burton and I called \"Fanny,\" and, not seeking  suicide for ourselves, sent half a dozen black boys to catch her.  But Fanny never liked her black uncles; on the steamer the Kroo boys  learned to give her the length of her chain, and so we were forced  to plunge to her"]]]
