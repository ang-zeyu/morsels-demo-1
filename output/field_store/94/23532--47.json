Having thus irrigated the  district, the waters flow out again; those nearest the Nile returning by  the same way that they flowed in, while the rest form a series of lakes,  the largest of which is known as the Birket el Kurun. If we are to believe  Herodotus, the work was not so simply done. A king, named Moeris, desired  to create a reservoir in the Fayum which should neutralise the evil effects  of insufficient or superabundant inundations. This reservoir was named,  after him, Lake Moeris. If the supply fell below the average, then the  stored waters were let loose, and Lower Egypt and the Western Delta were  flooded to the needful height. If next year the inundation came down in too  great force, Lake Moeris received and stored the surplus till such time as  the waters began to subside. Two pyramids, each surmounted by a sitting  colossus, one representing the king and the other his queen, were erected  in the midst of the lake. Such is the tale told by Herodotus, and it is a  tale which has considerably embarrassed our modern engineers and  topographers. How, in fact, was it possible to find in the Fayum a site  which could have contained a basin measuring at least ninety miles in  circumference? Linant supposed \"Lake Moeris\" to have extended over the  whole of the low-lying land which skirts the Libyan cliffs between Illahun  and Medinet el Fayum; but recent explorations have proved that the dikes by  which this pretended reservoir was bounded are modern works, erected  probably within the last two hundred years. Major Brown has lately shown  that the nucleus of \"Lake Moeris\" was the Birket el Kurun.[8] This was  known to the Egyptians as _Miri, Mi-uri,_ the Great Lake, whence the Greeks  derived their _Moiris_ a name extended also to the inundation of the Fayum.  If Herodotus did actually visit this province, it was probably in summer,  at the time of the high Nile, when the whole district presents the  appearance of an inland sea. What he took for the shores of this lake were  the embankments which divided it into basins and acted as highways between  the various towns. His narrative, repeated by the classic authors, has  been accepted by the moderns; and Egypt, neither accepting nor rejecting  it, was gratified long after date with the reputation of a gigantic work  which would in truth have been the glory of her civil engineers, if it had  ever existed. I do not believe that \"Lake Moeris\" ever did exist. The only  works of the kind which the Egyptians undertook were much less pretentious.  These consist of stone-built dams erected at the mouths of many of those  lateral ravines, or wadys, which lead down from the mountain ranges into  the valley of the Nile. One of the most important among them was pointed  out, in 1885, by Dr. Schweinfurth, at a distance of about six miles and a  half from the Baths of Helwan, at the mouth of the Wady Gerraweh (fig. 47).  It answered two purposes, firstly, as a means of storing the water of the  inundation for the use of the workmen in the neighbouring quarries; and,  secondly, as a barrier to break the force of the torrents which rush down  from the desert after the heavy rains of springtime and winter. The ravine  measures about 240 feet in width, the sides being on an average from 40 to  50 feet in height. The dam, which is 143 feet in thickness, consists of  three layers of material; at the bottom, a bed of clay and rubble; next, a  piled mass of limestone blocks (A); lastly, a wall of cut stone built in  retreating stages, like an enormous flight of steps (B). Thirty-two of the  original thirty-five stages are yet _in situ_, and about one-fourth part of  the dam remains piled up against the sides of the ravine to right and left;  but the middle part has been swept away by the force of the torrent (fig.  48). A similar dike transformed the end of Wady Genneh into a little lake  which supplied the Sinaitic miners with water.    Most of the localities from which the Egyptians derived their metals and  choicest materials in hard stone, were difficult of access, and would have  been useless had roads not been made, and works of this kind carried out,  so as to make life somewhat less insupportable there.    [Illustration: Fig. 48.--Section of dike at Wady Gerraweh.]    In order to reach the diorite and grey granite quarries of the Hammamat  Valley, the Pharaohs caused a series of rock-cut cisterns to be constructed  along the line of route. Some few insignificant springs, skilfully  conducted into these reservoirs, made it possible to plant workmen's  villages in the neighbourhood of the quarries, and also near the emerald  mines on the borders of the Red Sea. Hundreds of hired labourers, slaves,  and condemned criminals here led a wretched existence under the rule of  some eight or ten overseers, and the brutal surveillance of a company of  Libyan or negro mercenary troops. The least political disturbance in Egypt,  an unsuccessful campaign, or any untoward incident of a troubled reign,  sufficed to break up the precarious stability of these remote  establishments. The Bedawin at once attacked the colony; the workmen  deserted; the guards, weary of exile, hastened back to the valley of the  Nile, and all was at a standstill.    The choicest materials, as diorite, basalt, black granite, porphyry, and  red and yellow breccia, which are only found in the desert, were rarely  used for architectural purposes. In order to procure them, it was necessary  to organise regular expeditions of soldiers and workmen; therefore they  were reserved for sarcophagi and important works of art. Those quarries  which supplied building materials for temples and funerary monuments, such  as limestone, sandstone, alabaster, and red granite, were all found in the  Nile valley, and were, therefore, easy of access. When the vein which it  was intended to work traversed the lower strata of the rock, the miners  excavated chambers and passages, which were often prolonged to a  considerable distance. Square pillars, left standing at intervals,  supported the superincumbent mass, while tablets sculptured in the most  conspicuous places commemorated the kings and engineers who began or  continued the work. Several exhausted or abandoned quarries have been  transformed into votive chapels; as, for instance, the Speos Artemidos,  which was consecrated by Hatshepsut, Thothmes III. and Seti I. to the local  goddess Pakhet.[9]    [Illustration: Fig. 49.--Quarries of Silsilis.]    [Illustration: Fig. 50.--Draught of Hathor capital in quarry of Gebel  Abufeydeh.]    The most important limestone quarries are at Turah and Massarah, nearly  opposite Memphis. This stone lends itself admirably to the most delicate  touches of the chisel, hardens when exposed to the air, and acquires a  creamy tone most restful to the eye. Hence it was much in request by  architects and sculptors. The most extensive sandstone formations are at  Silsilis (fig. 49). Here the cliffs were quarried from above, and under the  open sky. Clean cut and absolutely vertical, they rise to a height of from  forty to fifty feet, sometimes presenting a smooth surface from top to  bottom, and sometimes cut in stages accessible by means of steps scarcely  large enough for one man at a time. The walls of these cuttings are covered  with parallel striae, sometimes horizontal, sometimes slanting to the left,  and sometimes to the right, so forming lines of serried chevrons framed, as  it were, between grooves an inch, or an inch and a half, in width, by nine  or ten feet in length. These are the scars left upon the surface by the  tools of the ancient workmen, and they show the method employed in  detaching the blocks. The size was outlined in red ink, and this outline  sometimes indicated the form which the stone was to take in the projected  building. The members of the French Commission, when they visited the  quarries of Gebel Abufeydeh, copied the diagrams and squared designs of  several capitals, one being of the campaniform pattern, and others prepared  for the Hathor-head pattern (fig. 50).[10] The outline made, the vertical  faces of the block were divided by means of a long iron chisel, which was  driven in perpendicularly or obliquely by heavy blows of the mallet. In  order to detach the horizontal faces, they made use of wooden or bronze  wedges, inserted the way of the natural strata of the stone. Very  frequently the stone was roughly blocked out before being actually  extracted from the bed. Thus at Syene (Asuan) we see a couchant obelisk of  granite, the under side of which is one with the rock itself; and at Tehneh  there are drums of columns but half disengaged. The transport of quarried  stone was effected in various ways. At Syene, at Silsilis, at Gebel Sheikh  Herideh, and at Gebel Abufeydeh, the quarries are literally washed by the  waters of the Nile, so that the stone was lowered at once into the barges.  At Kasr es Said,[11] at Turah, and other localities situate at some  distance from the river, canals dug expressly for the purpose conveyed the  transport boats to the foot of the cliffs. When water transit was out of  the question, the stone was placed on sledges drawn by oxen (fig. 51), or  dragged to its destination by gangs of labourers, and by the help of  rollers.
