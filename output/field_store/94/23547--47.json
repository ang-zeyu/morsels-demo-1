And Doll Tearsheet, and \"Greasy Jane\" in the song, and all  the rest of them? It is of the last importance that we should know.  Yet never a hint is vouchsafed us in the text. It is clear that  Shakespeare cannot bring himself to write about Anne Hathaway's  birthday--will not stain his imagination by thinking of it. That is  entirely human-natural. But why should he loathe Christmas Day itself  with precisely the same loathing? There is but one answer--and that  inevitable-final. The two days were one.    Some soul-secrets are so terrible that the most hardened realist of us  may well shrink from laying them bare. Such a soul-secret was this of  Shakespeare's. Think of it! The gentlest spirit that ever breathed,  raging and fuming endlessly in impotent-bitter spleen against the  prettiest of festivals! Here is a spectacle so tragic-piteous that,  try as we will, we shall not put it from us. And it is well that we  should not, for in our plenary compassion we shall but learn to love  the man the more.        [Mr. Fr*nk H*rr*s is very much a man of genius, and I should      be sorry if this adumbration of his manner made any one      suppose that I do not rate his writings about Shakespeare      higher than those of all \"the Professors\" together.--M.B.]          SCRUTS    _By_    ARN*LD B*NN*TT      I.    Emily Wrackgarth stirred the Christmas pudding till her right arm  began to ache. But she did not cease for that. She stirred on till her  right arm grew so numb that it might have been the right arm of some  girl at the other end of Bursley. And yet something deep down in her  whispered \"It is _your_ right arm! And you can do what you like with  it!\"    She did what she liked with it. Relentlessly she kept it moving till  it reasserted itself as the arm of Emily Wrackgarth, prickling and  tingling as with red-hot needles in every tendon from wrist to elbow.  And still Emily Wrackgarth hardened her heart.    Presently she saw the spoon no longer revolving, but wavering  aimlessly in the midst of the basin. Ridiculous! This must be seen  to! In the down of dark hairs that connected her eyebrows there was a  marked deepening of that vertical cleft which, visible at all times,  warned you that here was a young woman not to be trifled with. Her  brain despatched to her hand a peremptory message--which miscarried.  The spoon wabbled as though held by a baby. Emily knew that she  herself as a baby had been carried into this very kitchen to stir  the Christmas pudding. Year after year, as she grew up, she had been  allowed to stir it \"for luck.\" And those, she reflected, were the only  cookery lessons she ever got. How like Mother!    Mrs. Wrackgarth had died in the past year, of a complication of  ailments.[8] Emily still wore on her left shoulder that small tag of  crape which is as far as the Five Towns go in the way of mourning. Her  father had died in the year previous to that, of a still more curious  and enthralling complication of ailments.[9] Jos, his son, carried  on the Wrackgarth Works, and Emily kept house for Jos. She with her  own hand had made this pudding. But for her this pudding would not  have been. Fantastic! Utterly incredible! And yet so it was. She was  grown-up. She was mistress of the house. She could make or unmake  puddings at will. And yet she was Emily Wrackgarth. Which was absurd.    [Footnote 8: See \"The History of Sarah Wrackgarth,\" pp. 345-482.]    [Footnote 9: See \"The History of Sarah Wrackgarth,\" pp. 231-344.]    She would not try to explain, to reconcile. She abandoned herself to  the exquisite mysteries of existence. And yet in her abandonment she  kept a sharp look-out on herself, trying fiercely to make head or  tail of her nature. She thought herself a fool. But the fact that  she thought so was for her a proof of adult sapience. Odd! She gave  herself up. And yet it was just by giving herself up that she seemed  to glimpse sometimes her own inwardness. And these bleak revelations  saddened her. But she savoured her sadness. It was the wine of life  to her. And for her sadness she scorned herself, and in her conscious  scorn she recovered her self-respect.    It is doubtful whether the people of southern England have even yet  realised how much introspection there is going on all the time in the  Five Towns.    Visible from the window of the Wrackgarths' parlour was that colossal  statue of Commerce which rears itself aloft at the point where Oodge  Lane is intersected by Blackstead Street. Commerce, executed in glossy  Doultonware by some sculptor or sculptors unknown, stands pointing her  thumb over her shoulder towards the chimneys of far Hanbridge. When I  tell you that the circumference of that thumb is six inches, and the  rest to scale, you will understand that the statue is one of the prime  glories of Bursley. There were times when Emily Wrackgarth seemed to  herself as vast and as lustrously impressive as it. There were other  times when she seemed to herself as trivial and slavish as one of  those performing fleas she had seen at the Annual Ladies' Evening Fete  organised by the Bursley Mutual Burial Club. Extremist!    She was now stirring the pudding with her left hand. The ingredients  had already been mingled indistinguishably in that rich, undulating  mass of tawniness which proclaims perfection. But Emily was determined  to give her left hand, not less than her right, what she called \"a  doing.\" Emily was like that.    At mid-day, when her brother came home from the Works, she was still  at it.    \"Brought those scruts with you?\" she asked, without looking up.    \"That's a fact,\" he said, dipping his hand into the sagging pocket of  his coat.    It is perhaps necessary to explain what scruts are. In the daily  output of every potbank there are a certain proportion of flawed  vessels. These are cast aside by the foreman, with a lordly gesture,  and in due course are hammered into fragments. These fragments, which  are put to various uses, are called scruts; and one of the uses they  are put to is a sentimental one. The dainty and luxurious Southerner  looks to find in his Christmas pudding a wedding-ring, a gold thimble,  a threepenny-bit, or the like. To such fal-lals the Five Towns would  say fie. A Christmas pudding in the Five Towns contains nothing but  suet, flour, lemon-peel, cinnamon, brandy, almonds, raisins--and  two or three scruts. There is a world of poetry, beauty, romance, in  scruts--though you have to have been brought up on them to appreciate  it. Scruts have passed into the proverbial philosophy of the district.  \"Him's a pudden with more scruts than raisins to 'm\" is a criticism  not infrequently heard. It implies respect, even admiration. Of Emily  Wrackgarth herself people often said, in reference to her likeness to  her father, \"Her's a scrut o' th' owd basin.\"    Jos had emptied out from his pocket on to the table a good three dozen  of scruts. Emily laid aside her spoon, rubbed the palms of her hands  on the bib of her apron, and proceeded to finger these scruts with the  air of a connoisseur, rejecting one after another. The pudding was  a small one, designed merely for herself and Jos, with remainder to  \"the girl\"; so that it could hardly accommodate more than two or three  scruts. Emily knew well that one scrut is as good as another. Yet she  did not want her brother to feel that anything selected by him would  necessarily pass muster with her. For his benefit she ostentatiously  wrinkled her nose.    \"By the by,\" said Jos, \"you remember Albert Grapp? I've asked him to  step over from Hanbridge and help eat our snack on Christmas Day.\"    Emily gave Jos one of her looks. \"You've asked that Mr. Grapp?\"    \"No objection, I hope? He's not a bad sort. And he's considered a bit  of a ladies' man, you know.\"    She gathered up all the scruts and let them fall in a rattling shower  on the exiguous pudding. Two or three fell wide of the basin. These  she added.    \"Steady on!\" cried Jos. \"What's that for?\"    \"That's for your guest,\" replied his sister. \"And if you think you're  going to palm me off on to him, or on to any other young fellow,  you're a fool, Jos Wrackgarth.\"    The young man protested weakly, but she cut him short.    \"Don't think,\" she said, \"I don't know what you've been after, just of  late. Cracking up one young sawny and then another on the chance of me  marrying him! I never heard of such goings on. But here I am, and here  I'll stay, as sure as my name's Emily Wrackgarth, Jos Wrackgarth!\"    She was the incarnation of the adorably feminine. She was exquisitely  vital. She exuded at every pore the pathos of her young undirected  force. It is difficult to write calmly about her. For her, in another  age, ships would have been launched and cities besieged. But brothers  are a race apart, and blind. It is a fact that Jos would have been  glad to see his sister \"settled\"--preferably in one of the other four  Towns.    She took up the spoon and stirred vigorously. The scruts grated and  squeaked together around the basin, while the pudding feebly wormed  its way up among them.      II.    Albert Grapp, ladies' man though he was, was humble of heart. Nobody  knew this but himself. Not one of his fellow clerks in Clither's  Bank knew it. The general theory in Hanbridge was \"Him's got a stiff  opinion o' hisself.\" But this arose from what was really a sign of  humility in him. He made the most of himself. He had, for instance, a  way of his own in the matter of dressing. He always wore a voluminous  frock-coat, with a pair of neatly-striped vicuna trousers, which he  placed every night under his mattress, thus preserving in perfection  the crease down the centre of each. His collar was of the highest,  secured in front with an aluminium stud, to which was attached by a  patent loop a natty bow of dove-coloured sateen.

There once lived an old man in a snug, little cottage. It had two  rooms and only two windows. A small garden lay just behind it.    2. Old as the poor man was, he used to work in the fields. Often he would  come home very tired and weak, with his hoe or spade on his shoulder.    3. And who do you think met him at the door! Mary and Jane, his two little  grandchildren.    4. They were too young to work, except to weed in the garden, or bring  water from the spring.    5. In winter, as they were too poor to buy much wood or coal, they had  little fire; so they used to sit close together to keep warm. Mary would  sit on one of the old man's knees, and Jane on the other.    6. Sometimes their grandfather would tell them a droll story. Sometimes he  would teach them a hymn.    7. He would often talk to them of their father, who had gone to sea, or of  their good, kind mother, who was in her grave. Every night he prayed God  to bless them, and to bring back their father in safety.    8. The old man grew weaker every year; but the little girls were glad to  work for him, who had been so good to them.    [Illustration: Girls and grandfather greeting father at door.]    9. One cold, windy night, they heard a knock at the door. The little girls  ran and opened it. Oh, joy to them! There stood their father.    10. He had been at sea a long time. He had saved some money, and had now  come home to stay.    11. After this the old man did not have to work. His son worked for him,  and his grandchildren took care of him. Many happy days they spent  together.        LESSON LVII.    hoe      grave    knock     ex cept'    droll    hymn     prayed    cot'tage      THE GREEDY GIRL.      1. Laura English is a greedy little girl. Indeed, she is quite a glutton.  Do you know what a glutton is? A glutton is one who eats too much, because  the food tastes well.    2. Laura's mother is always willing she should have as much to eat as is  good for her; but sometimes, when her mother is not watching, she eats so  much that it makes her sick.    3. I do not know why she is so silly. Her kitten never eats more than it  needs. It leaves the nice bones on the plate, and lies down to sleep when  it has eaten enough.    4. The bee is wiser than Laura. It flies all day among the flowers to  gather honey, and might eat the whole time if it pleased. But it eats just  enough, and carries all the rest to its hive.    [Illustration: Heavy girl eating two apples. Plate on floor with food  scraps. Cat lying on footstool.]    5. The squirrel eats a few nuts or acorns, and frisks about as gayly as if  he had dined at the king's table.    6. Did you ever see a squirrel with a nut in his paws? How bright and  lively he looks as he eats it!    7. If he lived in a house made of acorns, he would never need a doctor. He  would not eat an acorn too much.    8. I do not love little girls who eat too much. Do you, my little readers?    9. I do not think they have such rosy cheeks, or such bright eyes, or such  sweet, happy tempers as those who eat less.
