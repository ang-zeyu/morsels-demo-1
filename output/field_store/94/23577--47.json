A year to be glad in,      Not to be sad in;    A year to live in,      To gain and give in.      A year for trying,      And not for sighing;    A year for striving      And healthy thriving.

[Illustration: The goose and the hen]    MAKING THE BEST OF IT      \"What a dreary day it is!\" grumbled the old gray goose to the brown hen.  They were standing at the henhouse window watching the falling snow  which covered every nook and corner of the farmyard.    \"Yes, indeed,\" said the brown hen. \"I should almost be willing to be  made into a chicken pie on such a day.\"    She had scarcely stopped talking when Pekin duck said fretfully, \"I am  so hungry that I am almost starved.\"    A little flock of chickens all huddled together wailed in sad tones,  \"And we are so thirsty!\"    In fact, all the feathered folk in the henhouse seemed cross and  fretful. It is no wonder they felt that way, for they had had nothing to  eat or drink since early in the morning. The cold wind howled around  their house. Hour after hour went by, but no one came near the henhouse.    The handsome white rooster, however, seemed as happy as usual. That is  saying a great deal, for a jollier old fellow than he never lived in a  farmyard. Sunshine, rain, or snow were all the same to him, and he  crowed quite as merrily in stormy weather as in fair.    \"Well,\" he said, laughing, as he looked about the henhouse, \"you all  seem to be having a fit of dumps.\"    Nobody answered the white rooster, but a faint cluck or two came from  some of the hens. They immediately put their heads back under their  wings, however, as if ashamed of having spoken at all.    This was too much for the white rooster. He stood first on one yellow  foot and then on the other. Turning his head from side to side, he said,  \"What's the use of looking so sad? Any one would think that you expected  to be eaten by a band of hungry foxes.\"    Just then a brave little white bantam rooster hopped down from his  perch. He strutted over to the big rooster and caused quite a flutter in  the henhouse by saying:    \"We're lively enough when our crops are full, but when we are starving,  it is a wonder that we can hold our heads up at all. If I ever see that  farmer's boy again, I'll--I'll--I'll peck his foot!\"    \"You won't see him until he feeds us,\" said the white rooster, \"and then  I guess you will peck his corn.\"    \"Oh, oh!\" moaned the brown hen. \"Don't speak of a peck of corn.\"    \"Madam,\" said the white rooster, bowing very low, \"your trouble is my  own,--that is, I'm hungry, too. But we might be worse off. We might be  in a box on our way to market. It is true that we haven't had anything  to eat to-day, but we at least have room enough to stretch our wings.\"    \"Why, that is a fact,\" clucked the brown hen. And all the feathered  family--even the smallest chickens--stretched their wings, and looked a  little more cheerful.    \"Now, then,\" went on the rooster, \"suppose we have a little music to  cheer us and help pass the hours until roosting time. Let us all crow.  There, I beg your pardon, ladies; I am sorry you can't crow. Let us sing  a happy song. Will you be kind enough to start a merry tune, Mrs. Brown  Hen?\"    The brown hen shook herself proudly, tossed her head back and  began,--\"Ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca!\" In less than two minutes every one in the  henhouse had joined her. The white rooster was the loudest of all, and  the little bantam rooster stretched his neck and did the best he could.    Now, the horses, cows, and sheep were not far away. They heard the happy  voices, and they, too, joined in the grand chorus. The pigs did their  best to sing louder than all the rest.    Higher and higher, stronger and stronger, rose the chorus. Louder and  louder quacked the ducks. Shriller and shriller squealed the pigs.    They were all so happy that they quite forgot their hunger until the  door of the henhouse burst open, and in came three chubby children. Each  was carrying a dish of hot chicken food.    \"Don't stop your music, Mr. Rooster,\" said the little girl, who was  bundled up until you could scarcely see her dear little face.    [Illustration: The children arrive with food]    \"You see, we were so lonesome that we didn't know what to do. We heard  you folk singing out here, and we laughed and laughed until we almost  cried. Then we went to tell Jack about you. He was lonesome, too, for  he's sick with a sore throat, you know. He said, 'Why, those poor hens!  They haven't been fed since morning! Go and feed them.' And so we came.\"    \"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\" said the white rooster. \"This comes of making the  best of things. Cock-a-doodle-doo!\" And nobody asked him to stop  crowing.    --FRANCES M. FOX.          THE ANIMALS AND THE MIRROR    I      Aunt Susan sent an old-fashioned looking-glass to the barn to be stored  in the loft, with other old furniture. The farm boy stood it on the  floor of the barn until he should have time to put it away. The mirror  was broad and long, and it was set in a dark wooden frame.    An old duck wandered into the barn and caught sight of herself in the  mirror. \"There is another duck,\" she said. \"I wonder who she is.\"    And she walked toward the reflection. \"She is rather friendly,\" the duck  went on. \"She is walking toward me. What large feet she has, but her  feathers are very handsome.\"    Just then she bumped into the mirror. \"Goodness!\" she cried; \"if that  duck isn't in a glass case! Why are you in there?\"    \"Well, you needn't answer if you don't want to,\" she said, walking away.  \"A glass case is a good place for you.\"    Just then a pig came along, and nosing around, he came in front of the  mirror.    \"What are you doing here?\" he asked, thinking he saw another pig. His  nose hit the glass, and he stepped back.    \"So you are in a glass pen,\" he said. \"You are not very handsome, and  your nose is not so long as mine; I cannot see why you should have a  glass pen.\"    And away he trotted to tell the other pigs about the very plain-looking  pig.    Kitty came along next and walked in front of the mirror, turning her  head and swinging her tail. She had seen a mirror before and knew what  it was. The cat wished to look in the mirror, but she saw the dog coming  in the door, and she did not want him to think her vain.    The dog walked over to the mirror and gazed in it. Then he looked  foolish, although he had seen a mirror before, too, but not so often as  puss.    \"Thought it was another dog, didn't you?\" she laughed. \"Here comes the  donkey. Let us hide behind those barrels and see what he does.\"      II      The donkey went up to the mirror.    \"If they haven't another donkey!\" he said. \"I suppose I should speak  first, as I have lived here so long. Why, he is coming to meet me. That  is friendly, indeed.\"    Bump! his nose hit the glass.    \"Well, I had better give up!\" he said. \"You are in a glass case, but I  don't know why you should be. You are a homely creature, and your ears  are not so long as mine.\" And he walked off with a disgusted air.    The cat rolled over and over, and the dog buried his head in his paws.  \"Did you ever see anything so funny?\" he said to puss.    \"Hush!\" she replied, \"Here is the rooster.\"    [Illustration: The rooster and the mirror]    The rooster stopped quite still when he saw himself in the mirror.    \"Well, where did you come from?\" he asked, ruffling up his feathers. He  walked straight to the mirror and flew at the other rooster. Bang! He  went against the glass.    \"In a glass case, are you?\" he said. He stretched out his neck and  looked very fierce. \"You should be; you are a sight--your feathers are  ruffled, and you are not half so handsome as I am.\"    And off he walked, satisfied that he was handsomer than the other  rooster.    \"Oh, dear!\" laughed the cat. \"I certainly shall scream. They all think  they are handsomer than their reflections. Here comes the turkey  gobbler. Let us see what he does.\"    The gobbler walked slowly over to the mirror and looked at his  reflection.    \"Now,\" he asked, \"where in the world did they get you? You are an old,  bald-headed creature, and your feathers need oiling. You look like a  last year's turkey.\" And off he strutted.    The cat and the dog leaned against the barrels and laughed until the  tears ran down their faces.    \"Keep still,\" said the dog. \"Here comes speckled hen and her chickens.\"    Speckled hen walked around, picking up bits of corn. Suddenly she looked  up and saw the mirror.    \"There is a hen with a brood of chicks, but they are not so handsome as  mine,\" she said, walking toward the looking-glass. \"Where do you live? I  know you do not belong here.\" And she looked closer at the other hen.    Click! Her bill hit the glass.    \"Well, if she isn't in a glass coop!\" the hen said, stepping back. \"If  master has bought her and those chicks, there will be trouble. Mercy!  One of the chicks is bow-legged, and they are a skinny looking lot.\"    Then she clucked to her chicks and walked out of the barn."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15173"],[0,"Pictures of Jewish Home-Life Fifty Years Ago (#8)"],[1,"kept very busy  washing up all the things used at meals, as no washing up is done during  the Sabbath. Then, too, all the Sabbath curtains, coverlets, glass,  china, and silver have to be carefully put away.    \"In my next letter I will write you more about our old lady.\"    When Mr Jacobs had finished the letter, the usual talk started. One said  that \"Such a Sabbath might be all very well in Palestine!\"    An elderly friend said: \"Well! in Palestine they at least _know_ what  the Sabbath is, whilst here in London, unless one keeps it strictly and  remains indoors all day, except to go to synagogue, one never sees any  difference between the Sabbath and any other day of the week.\"    Mr Jacobs said: \"I think what you both say is true, and the only way is  to try to keep our Sabbath in the spirit, as well as in the letter as  much as possible. If each of us tried to do this in his own home, even  in London, gradually a difference would be seen in the neighbourhood in  which we live. A wise man wrote: 'All reforms begin with _man_ and not  with _men_.' The first important step is to think good thoughts; for  'thoughts have wings,' and, when expressed, they are readily impressed  upon the minds of those in sympathy with the thinker.\"    \"True, very true!\" exclaimed the others. \"Let us each, with God's help,  strive to remember more often those thoughts of our Prophet Isaiah  (chap. 58): 'If thou call the Sabbath a delight, and the holy of the  Lord honourable, and shalt honour it, not doing thy wonted ways, nor  pursuing thy business, nor speaking thereof, then shalt thou delight  thyself in the Lord, and I will make thee to ride upon the high places  of the earth, and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy  father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.'\"    By this the Prophet meant that we were to drive all thoughts of business  from our minds on the Sabbath. No thoughts of scandal, evil, or  uncharitableness were to be harboured, but our minds and hearts were to  delight in words of prayer, in the study of the Holy Law. It was to be  truly a day of peace, a day of rest.          THE SUCCAH      Mr Jacob told his friends the next Friday evening, when they arrived as  usual, that he thought they would be interested in the letter describing  the Succah.    \"My dear Millie,--After the Day of Atonement, everyone was very busy  preparing for the Feast of Tabernacles, which is still celebrated here  as it must have been in Bible times.    \"With great merriment all the young people decorate their Succahs, while  their mothers with the baby in their arms watch the young folks at work.    \"The Succahs in Palestine are not made as they are in Europe. The  saplings are covered with palm-leaves woven together, the roof with  branches of trees, as there is no chance of rain at this time of the  year in Palestine. Everything that is beautiful in the home is brought  out to decorate the interior of the Succah. The poor make their Succahs  of doors or wooden boxes.    \"As this was the first Succah since our arrival, we were invited by  our neighbours to join them. The father, a patriarchal looking old  man with a saintly face, sat at the head of the table, and we were  fascinated by his looks. His eldest son came in soon after, followed  by his other grown-up sons and his daughters. He greeted his aged  father with a smile, and wished him good 'Yom Tov' and bowed his  head for his father's blessing. Then one by one all the children  came to greet him and receive his blessing, with quite a number of  grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and last but not least the  little great-great-grandchild.    \"When my parents looked astonished at the number, one of the daughters  quietly said: 'You see that here we marry our children while very young,  so that the Psalmist's words are very often fulfilled in Palestine, and  nearly everyone has his quiver full.' When all were quiet, our aged  friend repeated a prayer over the wine, and the large silver cup was  passed from one to the other. This was very solemnly and reverently  done.    \"After this, our aged neighbour's children who had large families went  to their own homes, while those of his children who had small families  remained to celebrate the Feast with him. When he had washed his hands  before eating and repeated the blessing upon the meal, he took his  youngest great-grandchild on his knee.    \"The only thing that saddened the scene was the empty chair beside our  aged friend--his wife had died during the course of the year. The  family all looked at the empty chair and sighed, and the  great-great-grandfather, with tears glistening in his eyes, also gave a  sigh, and then turned with a smile to his large family and said: 'Let us  begin. My little Samuel will start a Brocha,' and the rest listened to  hear how the little one lisped the words after his great-grandfather.    \"The following day our aged friend sat like a king in his Succah, while  relatives and friends came to pay their respects to him, and all was joy  and merriment.    \"Some of the younger grandchildren wanted to show their grandfather what  they had lately learned, and there was quite a scramble around his knees  to try and be first heard. With a wave of his hand he said: 'I will hear  you all in turn, my children.' This quietened the eager little souls,  and they waited patiently for their turns to come.    \"While the children were thus busy with their grandfather, the elder  sons and sons-in-law and their wives sat around, discussing quietly  various topics of interest, till the time for Mincha came round.    \"Then the great grandfather went to Shule, followed by all his children.    \"Visiting other neighbours during the Succah weeks, we found that they  preserved this beautiful and ancient way of keeping the Festival.    \"I never realized till then what a great influence for good the  surroundings and teaching in childhood can be, and how a father and  mother can leave the impress of their teaching in early life upon both  sons and daughters. It is the mother specially who forms the child's  soul, quite as clearly on the boys as on the girls from their  cradle-days, and the father and the teacher only builds on the  foundation laid by the mother: this is seen here more than elsewhere.\"    \"Very true,\" exclaimed the others; \"a great deal is done by the mother;  but the environment has a great influence on the character.\"    This caused a good deal of discussion and the meeting did not close till  one o'clock in the morning.          HOW CHARITY IS GIVEN      On the following Friday evening, the next letter that Mr Jacob chose for  reading to his family and friends was on the way almsgiving, or  charity, was managed in Palestine. Before starting to read, he advised  his hearers not to forget that the Jewish community in Palestine was  very small when this letter was written, and the majority of the people  were very poor. Many had spent most of their money and worldly goods in  the expenses of travelling there, with the object of ending their days  in their beloved land, and being buried with their forefathers.    Mr Jacob then began the letter.    \"My dear Millie,--You seem so interested in all I have so far told you  about our life in Palestine, that I think you will like to hear of some  of the ways that our poorer brethren are helped in Palestine.    \"Many of the ways will appear strange to you; yet I think some of them  are really better than those adopted by our community in England.    \"Here, there is no Board of Guardians, so that the giving of charity, or  a 'helping hand' to the sick or needy, is more of a direct personal  matter. The givers strive to be wise and tactful, so that our people  may not lose their self-respect; for, as a rule, they are naturally very  sensitive, and if self-respect is lost some are encouraged to become  beggars proper.    \"Mother tells us that our Jewish ethics teaches 'that true charity, or  almsgiving, is to make personal sacrifices when helping others. There is  no self-sacrifice in giving what you cannot make use of yourself.'  Indeed, one Jewish ethical teacher wrote: 'If one who has lived a  luxurious life becomes sick and in need, we should try to deny  ourselves, in order to give the sick one dainties such as chicken and  wine.'    \"Really some of our neighbours here seem to rejoice in giving away not  only all they can spare, but also in making personal sacrifices in  helping to relieve a needy neighbour.    \"From early childhood they were trained to give. In every Jewish home in  Palestine we see from two to perhaps more than a dozen boxes placed in  various parts of the house, and written on each is the special charity  to which the box is devoted. Into these boxes even tiny children are  trained to drop a coin at special times, and it is considered a happy  privilege to do so at times of Thanksgiving to God. The coins thus  collected are from time to time distributed amongst the sick and the  needy.    \"There is one hospital near us; and, though it is known to be well  managed, very few Jews whom we know go there for treatment, for it is a  Missionary Hospital, and we strongly object to the methods of Christian  missionaries. Instead of many of them as formerly, persecuting us for  clinging to our dearly beloved religion, they now try, by acts of  kindness in times of sickness and poverty, to influence our people in  favour of accepting their religion.    \"Indeed, I have heard some of our people say that they would rather go  to the Arabs for treatment than enter the Missionary Hospital! Therefore  those who cannot nurse the sick ones at home take them to the  Bikkur-Holim, which a doctor visits once every few days. A mother, wife,  or father goes with the patients to give them the necessary food and  medicine, for in the Bikkur-Cholem there are no trained nurses. The  relatives also keep the patients clean and tidy; but little cooking"]]]
