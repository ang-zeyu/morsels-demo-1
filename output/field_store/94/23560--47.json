Inside the tiny house the man fixed an old comforter then pointing at  it, he said, \"Go lie down, Jan.\"    With a sigh that was half-weariness, half gratitude, the dog stretched  his tired body on the soft quilt, but his eyes watched every movement of  his new friend. Then Jan slept in peace, for the first time since  Elizabeth had deserted him.    The odor of warm, fresh meat from a dish near his nose wakened him. As  he moved toward it a tiny yellow bird flew across the room and lit on  the floor, watching him pertly and edging cautiously to the plate. It  paused with head perked impudently on one side and its bright little  eyes fixed on the big dog. Jan kept very still, and the old man,  sitting across the room, nodded approvingly when the dog allowed the  bird to peck at the plate of food. After tasting Jan's dinner, the bird,  perched on the edge of the dish, lifted its head and sang as though its  throat would burst with music. It finished the song, gave a funny little  shake of its wings, then flew across the room and lit on the shoulder of  the Poundmaster, where it stayed while he kept moving around the room.    \"Go home, Cheepsie,\" said the old man, and the bird at once darted into  a cage hanging at the front window, but the Poundmaster did not shut the  cage door.    Then he led Jan to the back porch where the tub of clean soapsuds was  ready, and again the dog was washed thoroughly and the salve applied to  his sores. Though Jan's heart was almost bursting with gratitude, he  could only show it by poking his nose against the kindly hand, or  uttering low whimpers.    \"I know, old fellow,\" his new friend said, \"you're trying to thank me.  It's all right now. Don't worry!\"    And Prince Jan knew that it was all right. That night he slept on the  soft comforter in the little house.    As day after day went past, Jan began to feel strong again, but it took  eight long months before his beautiful hair grew out and his eyes at  last lost their pitiful pleading. At first he could not understand about  his new friend, whom he heard other men call \"Captain Smith, the  poundmaster.\" He remembered what the little white dog had said about  pounds being places where dogs were killed when they had no friends to  claim them, but Jan knew that his friend would not hurt any dog.    Each day, now, Jan followed the captain into the long room where dogs  were tied with ropes, just as he, himself, had been kept that first  night. During sunshiny days of the snowless winter, these dogs were led  into the back yard of the bungalow. It had a high board fence, so they  could run about and stretch, or lie in the warm grass.    None of these dogs ever stayed very long, but they all soon learned to  love the old captain and would rush around his feet or crawl against  him, wagging their tails. A few, bolder than the others, leaped up to  lick his hands, or pretended they were going to fight him, but when  they got near, they turned and raced about him in big circles, barking  and yelping as though they were laughing at the joke.    All the time, the old man stood smiling, his hands held out to caress  those nearest. New dogs came with the others, and often some of the  older dogs would disappear. Then Prince Jan would look at the captain,  wondering, but never doubting his friend who loved all dogs.          Chapter VII    HIPPITY-HOP      The loving care given Jan by the captain for eight months made him well  and happy, and above all brought back his lost faith in people, so that  he became the gentle, affectionate dog that he used to be before he knew  what cruelty meant.    One of Jan's ancestors had been a Newfoundland dog. These are very large  dogs with long, silky black and white hair. Though not so large as the  St. Bernards, they resemble them in build and show the same  intelligence, loyalty, and kind disposition. Newfoundland dogs are  wonderful swimmers and do not have to be trained to go out and rescue  people who are drowning. So it was very natural for Prince Jan to enjoy  swimming.    The old poundmaster and Jan walked on the beach nearly every day, and if  the dog saw a bit of driftwood near the shore, he would swim out and  get it. His master then put the wood in a basket so it could be taken  home to burn in the fireplace on cool nights. Often when Jan was alone  on the beach and spied floating wood, he dashed through the surf for it,  and, if it were not too heavy, dragged it to the bungalow. Whenever he  did this, he was petted and praised by the old man. Then Jan felt very  proud because he was helping his master.    One day as he wandered alone on the shore he saw a lot of wood floating  on the waves. Though it was quite a distance he did not hesitate to  plunge after it. The salt water splashed over his head; sometimes he was  completely under big waves, and once a high curling breaker caught and  turned him over and over, while his legs stuck up from the peak of the  wave, but Jan thought it all great sport. He shook his big head so that  his long ears flapped, and his strong paws sent him into deeper water  where the waves rolled in long lines but did not curl up and break so  roughly as nearer the shore.    The boards were fastened together, and Jan saw this was a much harder  task than he had ever attempted before. He grabbed the edge of a plank  in his powerful jaws and twisting sharply, struck back, for land.  Several times the force of the water and the weight of the little raft  made him let go, but each time he caught the driftwood and fought his  way toward the beach. Land was still quite distant when he heard a faint  noise, and then he saw that a tiny grey kitten was clinging to the  boards.    \"Hold on,\" called Jan, but the kitten did not seem to hear him. It lay  perfectly still.    He tried to swim faster, fearing the waves might wash the little  creature off, for at times the water covered the raft and Jan's head,  too. He gained the shore and dragged the wreckage far back to safety.  Jan sniffed at the kitten. Its eyes were shut and it did not move. He  knew that most cats are afraid of dogs, so he went off a little way and  sat down, waiting patiently for it to wake up.    After many minutes Jan went over and pushed it gently with his nose. It  did not stir. Then he sat down and looked at it thoughtfully,  remembering that when the dogs of the Hospice found a traveller in the  snow whom they could not waken, they hurried for help. His mother and  Bruno had told him that, and Jan had never forgotten those lessons, nor  the days he and Rollo had been trained by Brother Antoine.    His tongue licked the wet fur, but the kitten's eyes stayed shut. Jan  lifted his head, gave a loud bark and raced away through the sand,  kicking it with his fast-flying feet so that it formed tiny, yellow  clouds.    Into the little sitting-room he rushed, leaving a damp trail across the  floor. The captain looked up in surprise and stopped lighting his pipe  when the dog, dripping wet, stood in front of him and barked loudly.    \"What's the matter, Jan?\" he questioned. \"I never saw you so fussed up!  And you're dripping wet, too!\"    Jan danced around, barking, then dashed to the gate but there he stopped  and looked back, wagging his tail.    \"Do you want me to go with you?\" asked the old man, rising slowly.    The dog leaped against the gate, shoving it open, then ran ahead, only  to return and bark again.    \"All right,\" the poundmaster picked up his cap, and when he followed,  Jan's delight could not have been misunderstood by any one.    \"Woof! Woof!\" he kept shouting back, and in dog-talk that meant,  \"Hurry! Hurry!\"    And Captain Smith did hurry as fast as he could, but Jan reached the  driftwood long before the old man. The kitten was in the same place,  just as he had left it.    \"Why, it's a kitten!\" cried Jan's master, as he, too, reached the spot.  \"Poor little thing!\"    He stooped down and picked up the tiny, limp body. \"I think it's dead,  Jan, but you did your best to save it. Didn't you?\"    The dog watched intently, his tail waved slowly and his nose touched the  hand that was gently rubbing the wet fur. Then, without any warning, the  kitten's eyes opened and blinked and it uttered a faint mew.    \"Well! I declare, it's alive after all!\" the captain exclaimed. \"It must  have been washed ashore from some wrecked boat, judging from that  driftwood raft. Looks most starved to death, Jan. If there's any truth  that cats have nine lives, this little thing must have used up a good  many of its lives getting to land. Come along, Jan! We'll try to save  what's left, anyway.\"    The dog scampered toward the bungalow, running back at times to leap  about the old man. Jan was so happy that he had saved the poor little  thing. It was only a little, grey kitten, and at the Hospice, of course,  the dogs saved people; but that was in a place where there was snow.    When they all reached the kitchen, Jan crowded against the captain, who  rubbed the shivering little cat with an old towel. Then it was placed on  the floor with a saucer of milk. As the milk disappeared, the dog in his  delight, moved closer, but the frightened animal humped up its back,  fuzzed its thin tail and spit at him.    Of course, it did not know that Jan had saved its life, or that he did  not want to hurt it, now. He moved away and sat down quietly to watch  it. The saucer was filled with milk a second time, and the kitten's  tongue lapped as fast as it could go. Its sides bulged out from its  scrawny body when it had emptied the saucer and moved across the room.    \"You poor little thing!\" cried the old man, picking it up gently. \"It's  only got three legs, Jan!\"    The poundmaster fixed his glasses and examined a hind leg which had no  foot. \"I guess it was born that way,\" he spoke. \"Must have been taken  on some boat as a mascot. Well, it doesn't matter what has happened to  it, just so it's comfortable now, Jan!\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14900"],[0,"The Black Man's Place in South Africa (#8)"],[1,"to them, the white people only take what is  theirs to take.\"    \"But,\" I interpolated, \"white men do not take the girls away from you,  it is the girls themselves who leave their own kind and go to the white  men.\"    \"No,\" he replied, \"I say they take the girls because they know as well  as we do that women--all women--will always go where they can live with  ease and have plenty and be without work, and this they can do when they  go to the white man, whereas with us they must work. Therefore I say  that the white men take the girls away from us, but I do not say that  they do wrong so long as they only play with them and have no children  by them, for it is the manner of all the world that men and women come  together and no law can be made to stop them from doing so, but the  white men do wrong when they allow the black women to have children by  them because such children grow up without proper homes, and that is  very sad and wrong.\"    I think the average white man, whatever his own opinion may be on this  matter, will acknowledge that there is clear thought and strong  common-sense in the old man's dictum, and this old man is an ordinary  raw Native, without any European education.    My good friend, Mahlabanyane, is a typical Tebele of the old school. In  his youth he accompanied the hunter Selous on many wanderings, and he  never tires of telling of the ways and habits of the game and wild  animals he has seen and shot. One day he told me that he had observed  all the wild animals of Rhodesia, big and small, and that he had  examined them all after they had been killed. He had come to the  conclusion, he said, that many of the bigger animals were related to  one another in some wonderful way, and that they had probably come out  of the earth, all alike, and had then afterwards become different, \"as  people do when they separate and live always by themselves away from  other people,\" he added.    \"Look at the elephant, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus and the wild  pig,\" he said, \"they must at one time have been one kind; their teeth  are alike, and none of them chew the cud. I think they must be cousins  to one another, and, one time, perhaps, they were brothers.\"    Leaving aside the question of the absolute correctness of the old man's  observation there can be no doubt that we have here a thinker who, being  struck with the physiological similarity of some animals is attempting  to account for the fact, and does so along the lines of Darwin and his  predecessors, but without any of the facts and theories that were  recorded before they began their labours. I asked the old fellow if he  had ever heard Selous talk about this matter, and he said he had not;  the idea, he said, had come out of his own head.    One day a Zambesi woman whose husband, a petty chief, was awaiting trial  for murder at my station, sent word to me asking for permission to dance  that night in the compound. Surmising that there was a religious motive  behind this request I gave my consent, and afterwards watched the  dancing for an hour or so.    The element of rhythm in sound and movement has always been one of the  chief means of exciting and expressing religious exaltation as well as  sexual passion, and the two emotions merge easily in all primitive  people whether they be the half-civilised moujiks of Russia, or the  frequenters of modern \"Revival Meetings,\" or the naked Batonka on the  banks of the Zambesi. The Batonka, indeed, are particularly fond of  dancing to the beat of the ubiquitous drum.    The woman, who was accompanied by a few of her female friends, danced  with unusual grace, and her movements were remarkably free from erotic  incitation. Holding a pair of gourds in which little stones rattled not  unmusically, like castanets, she gyrated in the moonlight and pirouetted  on her toes with such lightness and elegance that my curiosity was  roused, and the next morning I had her brought to my office and asked  her to account, if she could, for the marked difference between her way  of dancing and that of the rest of her people.    This is what she said: \"I was very sad and my whole body was heavy. I  felt ill, so I asked that I might be allowed to dance. Dancing always  does me good when I feel unwell. I did not learn to dance in the way I  do from anyone. I think the Great Spirit gave to me the gift of dancing,  the power came down on me when I was a child. I have never seen  Europeans or Arabs dancing. I have never seen an Arab dancing woman. I  dance my way because the Spirit gave it to me to do so.\"    I then asked her what it was that made her well. Was it the dancing or  the profuse sweating which I had noticed? \"The Spirit,\" she said, \"made  me well, he gave me to dance, the dancing made we sweat thereby cooling  my body, and that made me well, it brought my heart back to its right  place.\"    This clear expression of concatenated thought from a Native woman who  had had no missionary tuition or other education of the Western kind  shows to my mind sound reasoning capacity no less developed than that  met with in Europeans generally.    Turning over my notes I select, at random, a few more instances to  illustrate my argument.    A Tebele youth of about twenty years of age, smooth-limbed and good  looking, was charged some years ago in the Rhodesian High Court with the  crime of abducting two young Native girls for his own immoral purposes.  I made a note of the chief part of his speech in his own defence at the  time. This is what he said:    \"I have the gift of singing and dancing, my father had it, and his  father before him. When I sing and dance people forget their sorrows,  and when I leave a kraal, singing as I go, the people follow me for the  joy of my song, so that sometimes I have to drive them away. Now it is  easy to drive away old men and women, but who can drive away two pretty  girls like these that have been made to speak against me to-day? When I  sang and danced at their kraal their father gave me a goat because I had  made his heart white and glad, and his daughters followed me and joined  in the play--and I am young! When I become old and can no longer sing  and dance the girls will not follow me. Why should I not be merry while  I may? I never said a word to these girls, they followed me, I did not  call them. But now, if the white men who listen to my words feel  doubtful about what I say, then I would ask the judge to allow me to  show them here and now how I can dance and sing, and if, after hearing  and seeing me do so, they still think I am to blame, then I have no more  to say; I shall go to gaol with a broken heart, and silent.\"    The offer made by this African Apollo, I need not say, was not accepted,  and he was found guilty and sentenced to a term of imprisonment with  hard labour, but I remember that several of the jurymen expressed their  astonishment afterwards at hearing so good a defence so pleasingly  expressed by a raw Native youth who had never been to any kind of  school.    On one occasion I had some trouble to make a Native complainant  understand that the evidence upon which he relied was entirely hearsay  and therefore of no avail against the man he wished to charge with a  crime of theft. While talking an elderly Tebele arrived and I put the  matter to him. He listened gravely and when I had finished he turned to  the other and said:    \"Have you not heard before that that which is heard only cannot be heard  again in Court? You must bring witnesses who saw and heard themselves  what you say has happened. The words of the man who says he heard the  story from another is no testimony against a man when he is to be tried  for a crime or a debt.\"    After writing down this crisp and explicit statement from a Native whom  I knew to have had little or no intercourse with educated Europeans I  asked the old man if he had ever heard the matter discussed in a  European Court. He said he had not, and seemed surprised that I should  consider his words worth putting down in a note-book.    When it is realised how few laymen amongst ourselves are able to grasp  the distinction between admissible and inadmissible evidence in a Court  of Law, and how few would be able to express themselves as clearly as  did this old, so-called, heathen, then the instance is seen to be worth  citing.    I remember a Native witchdoctor who in defending himself against a  charge of alleged witchcraft practice spoke thus:    \"The people you have heard to-day came to me and told me that they had  had sickness and death at their kraal. I knew these people and I knew  that there had been strife among them for a long time over the dividing  of an inheritance. I threw the bones[18]--it is our way--and I told  these people that the spirit of the old woman, who was the grand-mother  of most of them, was angry because of the quarrelling that did not  cease; I told them that the snakes, that is to say the ancestral spirits  of these people, were angry at the noise of the quarrelling, and I told  them to redeem their fault by killing a goat,--it is our way. And now it  is said that I have done wrong. In what way have I done wrong? I have  heard a white missionary say that the white man's God sends sickness to  people when they sin, and that if the sinners leave off their evil ways  then they become well and happy again, and I said the same to these  people--and if they paid me ten shillings, why, do not the whites make  payments to their priests?\"    I might add, in parenthesis, that the argument advanced did not find  favour with the magistrate on the bench who, like so many of his kind,  had little knowledge of Bantu lore and languages, and who therefore  could only perceive the letter of the law and not the human spirit  behind the acts that constituted a breach of the white man's statute.    The Natives, like most of the white people, prefer not to think overmuch  about death and whether"]]]
