This morning I had the startling news that the \"Poop\" had eaten too  much alfalfa and was all \"swellit oop,\" and, moreover, he had \"stealit  it.\" I don't know which is the more astonishing, that the Pope has  stolen alfalfa, or that he has eaten it.

IX    A CONFESSION           _April 5, 1910._    DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    I find upon re-reading your letter that I did not answer it at all when  I wrote you. You must think me very indifferent, but I really don't  mean to be.    My house joins on to Mr. Stewart's house. It was built that way so that  I could \"hold down\" my land and job at the same time. I see the wisdom  of it now, though at first I did not want it that way. My boundary  lines run within two feet of Mr. Stewart's house, so it was quite easy  to build on.    I think the Pattersons' ranch is about twenty-five miles from us. I am  glad to tell you they are doing splendidly. Gale is just as thrifty as  she can be and Bobby is steady and making money fast. Their baby is  the dearest little thing. I have heard that Sedalia is to marry a  Mormon bishop, but I doubt it. She puts on very disgusting airs about  \"our Bobby,\" and she patronizes Gale most shamefully; but Gale, bless  her unconscious heart, is so happy in her husband and son that she  doesn't know Sedalia is insulting.    My dear old grandmother whom I loved so much has gone home to God. I  used to write long letters to her. I should like a few addresses of old  persons who are lonely as she was, who would like letters such as I  write. You know I can't be brief. I have tried and cannot. If you know  of any persons who would not tire of my long accounts and would care to  have them, you will be doing me a favor to let me know.    I have not treated you quite frankly about something you had a right to  know about. I am ashamed and I regret very much that I have not told  you. I so dread the possibility of losing your friendship that I will  _never_ tell you unless you promise me beforehand to forgive me. I  know that is unfair, but it is the only way I can see out of a  difficulty that my foolish reticence has led me into. Few people,  perhaps, consider me reticent, but in some cases I am afraid I am even  deceitful. Won't you make it easy to \"'fess\" so I may be happy again?      Truly your friend,      ELINORE RUPERT.           _June 16, 1910._    MY DEAR FRIEND,--    Your card just to hand. I wrote you some time ago telling you I had a  confession to make and have had no letter since, so thought perhaps you  were scared I had done something too bad to forgive. I am suffering  just now from eye-strain and can't see to write long at a time, but I  reckon I had better confess and get it done with.    The thing I have done is to marry Mr. Stewart. It was such an  inconsistent thing to do that I was ashamed to tell you. And, too, I  was afraid you would think I didn't need your friendship and might  desert me. Another of my friends thinks that way.    I hope my eyes will be better soon and then I will write you a long  letter.    Your old friend with a new name,      ELINORE STEWART.          X    THE STORY OF CORA BELLE           _August 15, 1910._    DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    ... Grandma Edmonson's birthday is the 30th of May, and Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy suggested that we give her a party. I had never seen  Grandma, but because of something that happened in her family years ago  which a few narrow-heads whom it didn't concern in the least cannot  forgive or forget, I had heard much of her. The family consists of  Grandma, Grandpa, and little Cora Belle, who is the sweetest little bud  that ever bloomed upon the twigs of folly.    The Edmonsons had only one child, a daughter, who was to have married a  man whom her parents objected to solely because he was a sheep-man,  while their sympathies were with the cattle-men, although they owned  only a small bunch. To gain their consent the young man closed out his  interest in sheep, at a loss, filed on a splendid piece of land near  them, and built a little home for the girl he loved. Before they could  get to town to be married Grandpa was stricken with rheumatism. Grandma  was already almost past going on with it, so they postponed the  marriage, and as that winter was particularly severe, the young man  took charge of the Edmonson stock and kept them from starving. As soon  as he was able he went for the license.    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and a neighbor were hunting some cattle that had  wandered away and found the poor fellow shot in the back. He was not  yet dead and told them it was urgently necessary for them to hurry him  to the Edmonsons' and to get some one to perform the marriage ceremony  as quickly as possible, for he could not live long. They told him such  haste meant quicker death because he would bleed more; but he  insisted, so they got a wagon and hurried all they could. But they  could not outrun death. When he knew he could not live to reach home,  he asked them to witness all he said. Everything he possessed he left  to the girl he was to have married, and said he was the father of the  little child that was to come. He begged them to befriend the poor girl  he had to leave in such a condition, and to take the marriage license  as evidence that he had tried to do right. The wagon was stopped so the  jolting would not make death any harder, and there in the shadow of the  great twin buttes he died.    They took the body to the little home he had made, and Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy went to the Edmonsons' to do what she could there. Poor  Cora Jane didn't know how terrible a thing wounded pride is. She told  her parents her misdeeds. They couldn't see that they were in any way  to blame. They seemed to care nothing for her terrible sorrow nor for  her weakened condition. All they could think of was that the child  they had almost worshiped had disgraced them; so they told her to go.    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy took her to the home that had been prepared for her,  where the poor body lay. Some way they got through those dark days, and  then began the waiting for the little one to come. Poor Cora Jane said  she would die then, and that she wanted to die, but she wanted the baby  to know it was loved,--she wanted to leave something that should speak  of that love when the child should come to understanding. So Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy said they would make all its little clothes with every  care, and they should tell of the love. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy is the  daintiest needleworker I have ever seen; she was taught by the nuns at  St. Catherine's in the \"ould country.\" She was all patience with poor,  unskilled Cora Jane, and the little outfit that was finally finished  was dainty enough for a fairy. Little Cora Belle is so proud of it.    At last the time came and Mrs. O'Shaughnessy went after the parents.  Long before, they had repented and were only too glad to go. The poor  mother lived one day and night after the baby came. She laid the tiny  thing in her mother's arms and told them to call her Cora Belle. She  told them she gave them a pure little daughter in place of the sinful  one they had lost.    That was almost twelve years ago, and the Edmonsons have lived in the  new house all this time. The deed to the place was made out to Cora  Belle, and her grandfather is her guardian....    If you traveled due north from my home, after about nine hours' ride  you would come into an open space in the butte lands, and away between  two buttes you would see the glimmer of blue water. As you drew nearer  you would be able to see the fringe of willows around the lake, and  presently a low, red-roofed house with corrals and stables. You would  see long lines of \"buck\" fence, a flock of sheep near by, and cattle  scattered about feeding. This is Cora Belle's home. On the long, low  porch you would see two old folks rocking. The man is small, and has  rheumatism in his legs and feet so badly that he can barely hobble. The  old lady is large and fat, and is also afflicted with rheumatism, but  has it in her arms and shoulders. They are both cheerful and hopeful,  and you would get a cordial welcome....    When you saw Cora Belle you would see a stout, square-built little  figure with long flaxen braids, a pair of beautiful brown eyes and the  longest and whitest lashes you ever saw, a straight nose, a short upper  lip, a broad, full forehead,--the whole face, neither pretty nor ugly,  plentifully sown with the brownest freckles. She is very truly the head  of the family, doing all the housework and looking after the stock,  winter and summer, entirely by herself. Three years ago she took things  into her own hands, and since that time has managed altogether. Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy, however, tells her what to do.    The sheep, forty in number, are the result of her individual efforts.  Mrs. O'Shaughnessy told her there was more money in raising lambs than  in raising chickens, so she quit the chickens as a business and went to  some of the big sheep-men and got permission to take the \"dogie\" lambs,  which they are glad to give away. She had plenty of cows, so she milked  cows and fed lambs all day long all last year. This year she has forty  head of nice sheep worth four dollars each, and she doesn't have to  feed them the year round as she would chickens, and the wolves are no  worse to kill sheep than they are to kill chickens. When shearing-time  came she went to a sheep-man and told him she would help cook for his  men one week if he would have her sheep sheared with his. She said her  work was worth three dollars, that is what one man would get a day  shearing, and he could easily shear her sheep in one day. That is how  she got her sheep sheared. The"]]]
