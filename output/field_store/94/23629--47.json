England has a       perfect right to strive for such a state of things, and, precisely       because of the position that I take up toward the disarmament       question, I am the last to cast doubts upon it. It is quite another       thing, however, to make such a claim the basis of a convention       which must be recognized by all the other powers in peaceful       agreement. What if counterclaims are raised and the other powers       are not satisfied with the roles assigned to them?         One only requires to propound these questions in order to see       things would not go well for European dignity at any world congress       which had to decide upon such claims.           And then armies. If, for example, Germany should be required to       reduce her army by 100,000 men, by how many men must the other       powers diminish their armies? Notwithstanding all the pacific       assurances which, thank God, are being given everywhere, every       nation would reply to me at any preliminary inquiry that it claims       that position in the world which corresponds with the sum of its       national power, that the strength of its defensive forces must be       adapted to this claim. At any rate, I would give no other reply for       Germany. I should be touching the honor and national sentiment of       any other people if I expected any other statement from it.    Question of Control.         Every attempt at international disarmament must break down on the       question of control, which is absolutely impracticable. A classic       example of that is afforded by Prussia when overthrown by Napoleon.       Her army was to be limited to 45,000 men, but her patriotism,       notwithstanding the most ruthless application of every means of       control, managed to raise an army four times as large. The question       of disarmament is insoluble so long as men are men and States are       States.         In the course of the debate reference has been made to the recent       utterances of the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in       the House of Commons on the disarmament question. The English       Minister gave expression to the idea that a reciprocal exchange of       information concerning the naval construction of both countries       would insure them against surprises, and that thereby both       countries would be convinced that they were not trying mutually to       outstrip each other, while other powers would thereby be kept       informed regarding the relations of Germany and England, and so the       exchange of announcements would, on the whole, serve to promote       peace.         We were all the more able to adhere to this idea as our naval       building programme has always lain open. We have already declared       our readiness to come to an understanding on this point with       England, in the hope that it may bring about a desired appeasement.           World-embracing international arbitration treaties dictated by an       international areopagus I consider just as impossible as general       international disarmament. Germany takes up no hostile position       toward arbitration. In all the new German treaties of commerce       there are arbitration clauses. In the main it was due to Germany's       initiative that an agreement was arrived at at the second Hague       conference for the establishment of an International Prize Court.         Arbitration treaties can certainly contribute in a great measure to       maintain and fortify peaceful relations. But strength must depend       on readiness for war. The dictum still holds good that the weak       becomes the prey of the strong. If a nation can not or will not       spend enough on her defensive forces for her to be able to make her       way in the world, then she falls back into the second rank.             *       *       *       *       *          Austria-Hungary's Version of the War    By Kaiser Franz Josef and Count Berchtold.               *       *       *       *       *          The Imperial Rescript and Manifesto.           Ischl, July 28.         Dear Count Stuergkh:         I have resolved to instruct the Ministers of my Household and       Foreign Affairs to notify the Royal Servian Government of the       beginning of a state of war between the Monarchy and Servia. In       this fateful hour I feel the need of turning to my beloved peoples.       I command you, therefore, to publish the inclosed manifesto.          MANIFESTO.           To my peoples! It was my fervent wish to consecrate the years       which, by the grace of God, still remain to me, to the works of       peace and to protect my peoples from the heavy sacrifices and       burdens of war. Providence, in its wisdom, has otherwise decreed.       The intrigues of a malevolent opponent compel me, in the defense of       the honor of my Monarchy, for the protection of its dignity and its       position as a power, for the security of its possessions, to grasp       the sword after long years of peace.         With a quickly forgetful ingratitude, the Kingdom of Servia, which,       from the first beginnings of its independence as a State until       quite recently, had been supported and assisted by my ancestors,       has for years trodden the path of open hostility to       Austria-Hungary. When, after three decades of fruitful work for       peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, I extended my Sovereign rights to       those lands, my decree called forth in the Kingdom of Servia, whose       rights were in nowise injured, outbreaks of unrestrained passion       and the bitterest hate. My Government at that time employed the       handsome privileges of the stronger, and with extreme consideration       and leniency only requested Servia to reduce her army to a peace       footing and to promise that, for the future, she would tread the       path of peace and friendship. Guided by the same spirit of       moderation, my Government, when Servia, two years ago, was       embroiled in a struggle with the Turkish Empire, restricted its       action to the defense of the most serious and vital interests of       the Monarchy. It was to this attitude that Servia primarily owed       the attainment of the objects of that war.         The hope that the Servian Kingdom would appreciate the patience and       love of peace of my Government and would keep its word has not been       fulfilled. The flame of its hatred for myself and my house has       blazed always higher; the design to tear from us by force       inseparable portions of Austria-Hungary has been made manifest with       less and less disguise. A criminal propaganda has extended over the       frontier with the object of destroying the foundations of State       order in the southeastern part of the monarchy; of making       the people, to whom I, in my paternal affection, extended my full       confidence, waver in its loyalty to the ruling house and to the       Fatherland; of leading astray its growing youth and inciting it to       mischievous deeds of madness and high treason. A series of       murderous attacks, an organized, carefully prepared, and well       carried out conspiracy, whose fruitful success wounded me and my       loyal peoples to the heart, forms a visible bloody track of those       secret machinations which were operated and directed in Servia.         A halt must be called to these intolerable proceedings and an end       must be put to the incessant provocations of Servia. The honor and       dignity of my monarchy must be preserved unimpaired, and its       political, economic, and military development must be guarded from       these continual shocks. In vain did my Government make a last       attempt to accomplish this object by peaceful means and to induce       Servia, by means of a serious warning, to desist. Servia has       rejected the just and moderate demands of my Government and refused       to conform to those obligations the fulfillment of which forms the       natural and necessary foundation of peace in the life of peoples       and States. I must therefore proceed by force of arms to secure       those indispensable pledges which alone can insure tranquillity to       my States within and lasting peace without.         In this solemn hour I am fully conscious of the whole significance       of my resolve and my responsibility before the Almighty. I have       examined and weighed everything, and with a serene conscience I set       out on the path to which my duty points. I trust in my peoples,       who, throughout every storm, have always rallied in unity and       loyalty around my throne, and have always been prepared for the       severest sacrifices for the honor, the greatness, and the might of       the Fatherland. I trust in Austria-Hungary's brave and devoted       forces, and I trust in the Almighty to give the victory to my arms.         FRANZ JOSEF.             *       *       *       *       *          DECLARATION OF WAR.    Published in Special Edition of Official Gazette, Vienna, July 28.           The Royal Government of Servia not having given a satisfactory       reply to the note presented to it by the Austro-Hungarian Minister       in Belgrade on July 23, 1914, the Imperial and Royal Government of       Austria-Hungary finds it necessary itself to safeguard its rights       and interests and to have recourse for this purpose to force of       arms. Austria-Hungary, therefore, considers itself from this moment       in a state of war with Servia.             *       *       *       *       *          \"DAYS OF WORLD'S HISTORY.\"      Congratulatory Telegram to Kaiser Wilhelm II., "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16350"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature,  Vol. 2 (#8)"],[1,"  best adapted to its purpose.          ANECDOTES OF EUROPEAN MANNERS.      The following circumstances probably gave rise to the tyranny of the  feudal power, and are the facts on which the fictions of romance are  raised. Castles were erected to repulse the vagrant attacks of the  Normans; and in France, from the year 768 to 987, these places disturbed  the public repose. The petty despots who raised these castles pillaged  whoever passed, and carried off the females who pleased them. Rapine, of  every kind were the _privileges_ of the feudal lords! Mezeray observes,  that it is from these circumstances romancers have invented their tales  of _knights errant_, _monsters_, and _giants_.    De Saint Foix, in his \"Historical Essays,\" informs us that \"women and  girls were not in greater security when they passed by abbeys. The monks  sustained an assault rather than relinquish their prey: if they saw  themselves losing ground, they brought to their walls the relics of some  saint. Then it generally happened that the assailants, seized with awful  veneration, retired, and dared not pursue their vengeance. This is the  origin of the _enchanters_, of the _enchantments_, and of the _enchanted  castles_ described in romances.\"    To these may be added what the author of \"Northern Antiquities,\" Vol.  I. p. 243, writes, that as the walls of the castles ran winding round  them, they often called them by a name which signified _serpents_ or  _dragons_; and in these were commonly secured the women and young maids  of distinction, who were seldom safe at a time when so many bold  warriors were rambling up and down in search of adventures. It was this  custom which gave occasion to ancient romancers, who knew not how to  describe anything simply, to invent so many fables concerning princesses  of great beauty guarded by _dragons_.    A singular and barbarous custom prevailed during this period; it  consisted in punishments by _mutilations_. It became so general that the  abbots, instead of bestowing canonical penalties on their monks, obliged  them to cut off an ear, an arm, or a leg!    Velly, in his History of France, has described two festivals, which give  a just idea of the manners and devotion of a later period, 1230, which  like the ancient mysteries consisted of a mixture of farce and piety:  religion in fact was their amusement! The following one existed even to  the Reformation:--    In the church of Paris, and in several other cathedrals of the kingdom,  was held the _Feast of Fools_ or madmen. \"The priests and clerks  assembled elected a pope, an archbishop, or a bishop, conducted them in  great pomp to the church, which they entered dancing, masked, and  dressed in the apparel of women, animals, and merry-andrews; sung  infamous songs, and converted the altar into a beaufet, where they ate  and drank during the celebration of the holy mysteries; played with  dice; burned, instead of incense, the leather of their old sandals; ran  about, and leaped from seat to seat, with all the indecent postures with  which the merry-andrews know how to amuse the populace.\"    The other does not yield in extravagance. \"This festival was called the  _Feast of Asses_, and was celebrated at Beauvais. They chose a young  woman, the handsomest in the town; they made her ride on an ass richly  harnessed, and placed in her arms a pretty infant.[14] In this state,  followed by the bishop and clergy, she marched in procession from the  cathedral to the church of St. Stephen's; entered into the sanctuary;  placed herself near the altar, and the mass began; whatever the choir  sung was terminated by this charming burthen, _Hihan, hihan_! Their  prose, half Latin and half French, explained the fine qualities of the  animal. Every strophe finished by this delightful invitation:--        Hez, sire Ane, ca chantez,      Belle bouche rechignez,      Vous aures du foin assez,      Et de l'avoine si plantez.    They at length exhorted him, in making a devout genuflexion, to forget  his ancient food, for the purpose of repeating without ceasing, _Amen,  Amen_. The priest, instead of _Ite missa est_, sung three times, _Hihan,  hihan, hihan_! and the people three times answered, _Hihan, hihan,  hihan_! to imitate the braying of that grave animal.[15]    What shall we think of this imbecile mixture of superstition and farce?  This _ass_ was perhaps typical of the _ass_ which Jesus rode! The  children of Israel worshipped a golden ass, and Balaam made another  speak. How fortunate then was _James Naylor_, who desirous of entering  Bristol on an _ass_, Hume informs us--it is indeed but a piece of cold  pleasantry--that all Bristol could not afford him _one_!    At the time when all these follies were practised, they would not suffer  men to play at _chess_! Velly says, \"A statute of Eudes de Sully  prohibits clergymen not only from playing at chess, but even from having  a chess-board in their house.\" Who could believe, that while half the  ceremonies of religion consisted in the grossest buffoonery, a prince  preferred death rather than cure himself by a remedy which offended his  chastity! Louis VIII. being dangerously ill, the physicians consulted,  and agreed to place near the monarch while he slept a young and  beautiful lady, who, when he awoke, should inform him of the motive  which had conducted her to him. Louis answered, \"No, my girl, I prefer  dying rather than to save my life by a _mortal sin_!\" And, in fact, the  good king died! He would not be prescribed for out of the whole  Pharmacopoeia of Love!    An account of our taste in female beauty is given, by Mr. Ellis, who  observes, in his notes to Way's Fabliaux, \"In the times of chivalry the  minstrels dwelt with great complacency on the fair hair and delicate  complexion of their damsels. This taste was continued for a long time,  and to render the hair light was a great object of education. Even when  wig first came into fashion they were all flaxen. Such was the colour of  the Gauls and of their German conquerors. It required some centuries to  reconcile their eyes to the swarthy beauties of their Spanish and their  Italian neighbours.\"[16]    The following is an amusing anecdote of the difficulty in which an  honest Vicar of Bray found himself in those contentious times.    When the court of Rome, under the pontificates of Gregory IX. and  Innocent IV., set no bounds to their ambitious projects, they were  opposed by the Emperor Frederick; who was of course anathematised. A  curate of Paris, a humorous fellow, got up in his pulpit with the bull  of Innocent in his hand. \"You know, my brethren (said he), that I am  ordered to proclaim an excommunication against Frederick. I am ignorant  of the motive. All that I know is, that there exist, between this Prince  and the Roman Pontiff great differences, and an irreconcileable hatred.  God only knows which of the two is wrong. Therefore with all my power I  excommunicate him who injures the other; and I absolve him who suffers,  to the great scandal of all Christianity.\"    The following anecdotes relate to a period which is sufficiently remote  to excite curiosity; yet not so distant as to weaken the interest we  feel in those minutiae of the times.    The present one may serve as a curious specimen of the despotism and  simplicity of an age not literary, in discovering the author of a libel.  It took place in the reign of Henry VIII. A great jealousy subsisted  between the Londoners and those foreigners who traded here. The  foreigners probably (observes Mr. Lodge, in his Illustrations of English  History) worked cheaper and were more industrious.    There was a libel affixed on St. Paul's door, which reflected on Henry  VIII. and these foreigners, who were accused of buying up the wool with  the king's money, to the undoing of Englishmen. This tended to inflame  the minds of the people. The method adopted to discover the writer of  the libel must excite a smile in the present day, while it shows the  state in which knowledge must have been in this country. The plan  adopted was this: In every ward one of the King's council, with an  alderman of the same, was commanded to see every man write that could,  and further took every man's book and sealed them, and brought them to  Guildhall to confront them with the original. So that if of this number  many wrote alike, the judges must have been much puzzled to fix on the  criminal.    Our hours of refection are singularly changed in little more than two  centuries. In the reign of Francis I. (observes the author of  Recreations Historiques) they were accustomed to say,--        Lever a cinq, diner a neuf,      Souper a cinq, coucher a neuf,      Fait vivre d'ans nonante et neuf.    Historians observe of Louis XII. that one of the causes which  contributed to hasten his death was the entire change of his regimen.  The good king, by the persuasion of his wife, says the history of  Bayard, changed his manner of living: when he was accustomed to dine at  eight o'clock, he agreed to dine at twelve; and when he was used to  retire at six o'clock in the evening, he frequently sat up as late as  midnight.    Houssaie gives the following authentic notice drawn from the registers  of the court, which presents a curious account of domestic life in the  fifteenth century. Of the dauphin Louis, son of Charles VI., who died at  the age of twenty, we are told, \"that he knew the Latin and French  languages; that he had many musicians in his chapel; passed the night in  vigils; dined at three in the afternoon, supped at midnight, went to bed  at the break of day, and thus was _ascertene_ (that is threatened) with  a short life.\" Froissart mentions waiting upon the Duke of Lancaster at  five o'clock in the afternoon, when he _had supped_.    The custom of dining at nine in the morning relaxed greatly under  Francis I., successor of Louis XII. However, persons of quality dined  then the latest at ten; and"]]]
