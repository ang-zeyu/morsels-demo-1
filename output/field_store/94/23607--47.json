It is not necessary, however, to go so far afield to obtain personal  experiences, as is shown by the following newspaper and magazine  articles based on what the writers found in the course of their everyday  pursuits.    The results obtained from cultivating a quarter-acre lot in the  residence district of a city of 100,000 population were told by a writer  in the _Country Gentleman_.    A woman's experience with bees was related in _Good Housekeeping_ under  the title, \"What I Did with Bees.\"    Experience in screening a large porch on his house furnished a writer  with the necessary information for a practical story in _Popular  Mechanics_.    Some tests that he made on the power of automobiles gave a young  engineer the suggestion for an article on the term \"horse power\" as  applied to motor-cars; the article was published in the _Illustrated  World_.    \"Building a Business on Confidence\" was the title of a personal  experience article published in _System_.    The evils of tenant farming, as illustrated by the experiences of a  farmer's wife in moving during the very early spring, were vividly  depicted in an article in _Farm and Fireside_.    The diary of an automobile trip from Chicago to Buffalo was embodied in  an article by a woman writer, which she sold to the _Woman's Home  Companion_.    Both usual and unusual means employed to earn their college expenses  have served as subjects for many special articles written by  undergraduates and graduates.    Innumerable articles of the \"how-to-do-something\" type are accepted  every year from inexperienced writers by publications that print such  useful information. Results of experiments in solving various problems  of household management are so constantly in demand by women's magazines  and women's departments in newspapers, that housewives who like to  write find a ready market for articles based on their own experience.    CONFESSION ARTICLES. One particular type of personal experience article  that enjoys great popularity is the so-called \"confession story.\" Told  in the first person, often anonymously, a well-written confession  article is one of the most effective forms in which to present facts and  experiences.    Personal experiences of others, as well as the writer's own, may be  given in confession form if the writer is able to secure sufficiently  detailed information from some one else to make the story probable.    A few examples will illustrate the kind of subjects that have been  presented successfully in the confession form.    Some criticisms of a typical college and of college life were given  anonymously in the _Outlook_ under the title, \"The Confessions of an  Undergraduate.\"    \"The Story of a Summer Hotel Waitress,\" published in the _Independent_,  and characterized by the editor as \"a frank exposure of real life below  stairs in the average summer hotel,\" told how a student in a normal  school tried to earn her school expenses by serving as a waitress during  the summer vacation.    In _Farm and Fireside_ was published \"The Confession of a Timber Buyer,\"  an article exposing the methods employed by some unscrupulous lumber  companies in buying timber from farmers.    \"How I Cured Myself of Being Too Sensitive,\" with the sub-title, \"The  Autobiography of a Young Business Man Who Nearly Went to Smash through  Jealousy,\" was the subject of a confession article in the _American  Magazine_.    An exposure of the impositions practiced by an itinerant quack was made  in a series of three confession articles, in Sunday issues of the  _Kansas City Star_, written by a young man whom the doctor had employed  to drive him through the country districts.    To secure confession features from readers, magazines have offered  prizes for the best short articles on such topics as, \"The Best Thing  Experience has Taught Me,\" \"How I Overcame My Greatest Fault,\" \"The Day  of My Great Temptation,\" \"What Will Power Did for Me.\"    SUBJECTS FROM THE DAY'S NEWS. In his search for subjects a writer will  find numberless clues in newspapers. Since the first information  concerning all new things is usually given to the world through the  columns of the daily press, these columns are scanned carefully by  writers in search of suggestions. Any part of the paper, from the \"want  ads\" to the death notices or the real estate transfers, may be the  starting point of a special article. The diversity of topics suggested  by newspapers is shown by the following examples.    The death of a well-known clown in New York was followed by a special  feature story about him in the Sunday magazine section of a Chicago  paper.    A newspaper report of the discovery in Wisconsin of a method of  eliminating printing ink from pulp made from old newspapers, so that  white print paper might be produced from it, led a young writer to send  for information to the discoverer of the process, and with these  additional details he wrote an article that was published in the _Boston  Transcript._    A news story about a clever swindler in Boston, who obtained possession  of negotiable securities by means of a forged certified check, was made  the basis of a special feature story in the _Providence Journal_ on the  precautions to be taken against losses from forged checks.    News of the energetic manner in which a New Jersey sheriff handled a  strike suggested a personality sketch of him that appeared in the  _American Magazine_.    The publication, in a newspaper, of some results of a survey of rural  school conditions in a Middle Western state, led to two articles on why  the little red schoolhouse fails, one of which was published in the  _Country Gentleman_, and the other in the _Independent_.    From a brief news item about the success of a farmer's widow and her  daughter, in taking summer boarders in their old farmhouse, was  developed a practical article telling how to secure and provide for  these boarders on the ordinary farm. The article appeared in _Farm and  Fireside_.    OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS. Bulletins and reports of government officials are a  mine for both subjects and material. For new developments in agriculture  one may consult the bulletins of the United States Department of  Agriculture and those of state agricultural experiment stations. Reports  on new and better methods of preparing food, and other phases of home  economics, are also printed in these bulletins. State industrial  commissions publish reports that furnish valuable material on industrial  accidents, working-men's insurance, sanitary conditions in factories,  and the health of workers. Child welfare is treated in reports of  federal, state, and city child-welfare boards. The reports of the  Interstate Commerce Commission, like those of state railroad  commissions, contain interesting material on various phases of  transportation. State and federal census reports often furnish good  subjects and material. In short, nearly every official report of any  kind may be a fruitful source of ideas for special articles.    The few examples given below suggest various possibilities for the use  of these sources.    Investigations made by a commission of American medical experts  constituting the Committee on Resuscitation from Mine Gases, under the  direction of the U.S. Bureau of Mines, supplied a writer in the _Boston  Transcript_ with material for a special feature story on the dangers  involved in the use of the pulmotor.    A practical bulletin, prepared by the home economics department of a  state university, on the best arrangement of a kitchen to save needless  steps, was used for articles in a number of farm journals.    From a bulletin of the U.S. Department of Agriculture a writer prepared  an article on \"the most successful farmer in the United States\" and what  he did with twenty acres, for the department of \"Interesting People\" in  the _American Magazine_.    The results of a municipal survey of Springfield, Illinois, as set  forth in official reports, were the basis of an article in the _Outlook_  on \"What is a Survey?\" Reports of a similar survey at Lawrence, Kansas,  were used for a special feature story in the _Kansas City Star_.    \"Are You a Good or a Poor Penman?\" was the title of an article in  _Popular Science Monthly_ based on a chart prepared by the Russell Sage  Foundation in connection with some of its educational investigations.    The _New York Evening Post_ published an interesting special article on  the \"life tables\" that had been prepared by the division of vital  statistics of the Bureau of the Census, to show the expectation of life  at all ages in the six states from which vital statistics were obtained.    A special feature story on how Panama hats are woven, as printed in the  _Ohio State Journal_, was based entirely on a report of the United  States consul general at Guayaquil, Ecuador.    SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS. Almost every science and every  art has its own special periodicals, from which can be gleaned a large  number of subjects and much valuable material that needs only to be  popularized to be made attractive to the average reader. The printed  proceedings of scientific and technical societies, including the papers  read at their meetings, as well as monographs and books, are also  valuable. How such publications may be utilized is illustrated by the  articles given below.    The report of a special committee of an association of electrical  engineers, given at its convention in Philadelphia, furnished a writer  with material for an article on \"Farming by Electricity,\" that was  published in the Sunday edition of the _Springfield Republican_.    Studies of the cause of hunger, made by Prof. A.J. Carlson of the  University of Chicago and published in a volume entitled \"The Control of  Hunger in Health and Disease,\" furnished the subject for an article in  the _Illustrated World."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15721"],[0,"The Hawk of Egypt (#8)"],[1,"ruins of the Temple.  Also I could visit my  Tents of Purple and of Gold.  How long shall I be gone, sweet Mother?  That is known only to Allah, to whom our goings and our comings are as  the drifting of the sands.\"    \"Your tents are very beautiful, my son.  The servants are waiting for  your orders before pitching the--the--middle one.  Without asking  permission, I went to inspect them.  Just before your return, just to  see if everything was quite all right.  One can never quite trust the  servants.\"    Jill might have been sitting on a rectory lawn, talking about her  linen-cupboard or spring-cleaning with a neighbour, instead of one of  the wonders of modern Egypt.  In fact, so quaint was it that the man  laughed and swung her onto the balustrade.    \"I'm not surprised Father worships the ground your ridiculous little  feet tread on, Mater,\" he said, causing his mother to gasp, so English  did he sound, so Oriental did he look.    \"Dear!\" she said gently, as she scrutinised him with a mother's eyes  and touched his face and patted his cheek and pulled a bit here and  there at his fine white linen coat, upon which in coarse thread was  embroidered the Hawk of Old Egypt.  \"Dear! don't you think you would be  happier if you were to marry and--settle down?\"    And it was then that there came to her the full explanation of the hurt  reflected in her firstborn's eyes.    \"I shall never marry, dear,\" very gently replied the man, so fearful  was he of causing pain to the woman who had borne him.  \"I--I--you see,  I cannot.\"    \"Cannot, Hugh?  But, my dear, what is the matter?  You will have to,  some day, you know.  You are your father's eldest son,\" answered the  woman, who, wrapped in perfect love and happiness, had never given a  thought to the far-reaching effects of her marriage with the Arabian.  \"Dear son, there are so many beautiful, cultured, gentle women here and  at home--I mean in England--you------\"    \"Mother, please!  Oh, Mother, you don't understand--dear heavens! you  don't understand.  Listen--and, how I wish my father, whom I honour,  were here to comfort you.  Forgive me, dear, forgive me for the pain I  must cause you------\"    And the woman went white to the lips under a sudden blinding flash of  understanding and her proud eyes dropped to the hands clenched in her  lap.    \"I want to marry, Mother of mine.\"  He spoke in the Arabian tongue,  which, is so atune to love, \"for behold love in the space of an hour  has grown within me.  The floods of love drown me, the full-blossomed  trees of passion throw their shade upon the surging waters, and,  behold, the shade is that of tenderness.  From the midst of the flood  where I am like to drown, I stretch my arms towards the rocky shore  where stands, looking towards me, the desire of my soul.  Behold, my  eyes have seen her, and, behold, she is white, with hair like the  desert at sunset, and eyes even as the pools of Lebanon.  She is as a  rod to be bent, and as a vase of perfume to be broken upon a night of  love.  And I love her--her--out of all women--a doe to be hunted at  dawn, a mare to be spurred through the watches of the night------\"    \"Hugh!\"    \"I love her as my father loved you--my father, of whom I am the eldest  son--son of a highborn father, son of a highborn  mother--outcast--outcast!\"    \"For pity's sake, Hugh, stop!\"    But the storm swept on, tearing the veil from the woman's eyes.    \"Behold, I care not for the plucking of garden blossoms, therefore are  the beautiful, docile women of the East not for me, and the thorns upon  the hedge of convention defied, the barbed wires of racial distinction  keep me from the hedgerow flower, born of the wind and the sky and the  summer heat, which I covet.    \"Among men I am nothing; I may not claim equality with the scavenger of  the Western streets; or with the donkey-boys of the Eastern bazaar.  Here I am served with fear and servility, being a man of riches; across  the waters, I may sun myself in the smiles of women as long as I have  no desire to wed.\"  He suddenly seized the woman, holding her in a grip  of iron which left great bruises on her arms.  \"Do you know what she  called me, Mother?--that harlot of a line of noblemen--what she flung  in my teeth because, seeing in her a woman of the streets hidden under  the cloak of marriage, I refused to be tempted?\"    There fell a terrible silence, and then a few whispered words.    \"She called me a half-caste, Mother!--me--a half-caste!\"    And the mother fell at her son's feet and bowed her head to the ground,  and he swept her up into his arms, raining kisses upon the piteous face.    \"I don't blame you, sweetheart-mother,\" he said in English, whilst she  sobbed on his heart.  \"Am I not the fruit of a brave woman's great  love?  Could there be anything finer than that?  But my father in me  made my whole body clamour for the desert when I was in England; my  mother in me makes my heart throb in the desert for just one hour of  her cool, misty country, one hour on a hill-top in which to watch the  pearl-gray dawn.  Dearest, dearest, don't sob so.  It is a case of two  affirmatives making a negative; two great nationalities decried,  derided, rendered null and void in their offspring through the dictates  of those who, in religion, prate that we are all brothers.  I have just  got to stick it, my mother, and life is not very long.  But I shall  never marry.\"  And as he spoke, Fate flicked a page of an illustrated  paper, which was but the volume of the Book of Life, and perhaps only a  mother's eyes would have noticed the sudden tightening of the hand upon  the marble of the balustrade as the man looked down into the pictured  beauty of the woman he loved.    And, having read what had been written, he knelt to receive his  mother's blessing.    \"To the Tents of Purple and Gold, my darling?\" she asked, smiling so  bravely to hide her breaking heart.    \"Not just yet, dear; a bit further North first, I think.\"    \"For long?\"    \"I do not know, dear.  Bless me, O my mother.\"    She blessed him and called to him as he stood at the head of the marble  stairway:    \"Come back to me, my son!\"    \"That, O woman, is in the hands of Allah, who is God.\"    And he turned and left her, and she, having wept her heart out and her  beautiful eyes dim, took up the illustrated paper which was a volume of  the Book of Life, and turned the pages.    \"Ah!\" she said.  \"How beautiful!\"    It was just a simple photograph of Damaris at a tennis tournament, and  underneath the information that the most popular and beautiful visitor  in Cairo would celebrate her birthday in a week's time, that in honour  of the occasion her god-mother, the Duchess of Longacres, had issued  invitations for a fancy-dress ball, after which social event she and  her god-daughter would proceed to the Desert Palace Hotel, Heliopolis.    \"I wonder,\" whispered Jill, \"I wonder if she would come to see me.  She  was always such a wise old woman.  I wonder if there is a way out\"--and  she stretched her arms out towards the desert.  \"Hahmed!\" she called,  \"Beloved, I love you, and my heart is breaking,\"--and she lifted her  head and listened to the sound of many horses running; then bowed her  head and wept.    The dawn was nigh to breaking, and yet the parade of horses was not  finished; whilst the trainer, the head groom, the stud groom, the  under-grooms and the rank and file of the stables tore their beards or  their hair as they endeavoured to please their master, whilst they  waited anxiously for the return of the man who had been hurriedly sent  to fetch in the mare, Pi-Kay, who was out to grass, and as wild as a  bird on the wing.    Singly, or in pairs, every priceless quadruped had been put through its  paces upon the track of tan imported from England.    Three coal-black stallions, brothers to el-Sooltan, even then in Cairo,  and famous throughout Egypt, tore past him like a cyclone and left him  indifferent; a chestnut brood mare, whose price was above that of many  rubies, trotted up at his call and snuffled a welcome in his sleeve,  searched for sugar in his hand and found it, and whinnied gently when  he turned away; bays, piebalds, roans, greys, trotted, galloped,  jumped, whilst their master smoked endless cigarettes and the stud  groom prayed fervently to Allah.    \"By the patience of the Prophet,\" the master suddenly cried, turning on  the man, \"hast thou nothing else?  Is there no jewel amongst my horses?  Hast thou not in all my stables one of the Al Hamsa, a descendant of  the mares who found favour in the eyes of Mohammed the prophet of Allah  who is God?  The mare Alia--has she been, perchance, as sterile as thy  wits?\"    And then he stopped short and stood in silence, watching the loveliest  picture any human could wish to see.    Picking up her dainty feet as though she walked upon hot stones,  tossing her proud little head, with big, gentle eyes, spreading  nostrils and fine small ears almost touching at the tips, mane flowing,  tail set high and spread, came the snow-white mare, Pi-Kay.    Allah! but the loveliness of that picture as she stood, thoroughbred,  perfect, as proud as any queen, as scornful as any spoiled beauty, as  confused at the sight of her master as any bride!    Ten yards away and motionless she stood from this man who seemed to  take no notice of her, and then she wheeled, and flung up her heels;  then stopped and looked at him along her satin flank and piqued with  his indifference suddenly sped out into the desert.    Then, softly, melodiously, the man's voice called her, ringing like a  bell under the lightening sky, and behold, love awoke in the mare's  heart and she turned and raced back towards him, longing for his hand  and the grip of his knees upon her.  But with her feet upon the tan,  she turned her back upon him and danced across towards the coal-black  stallions, causing their grooms to hold on to them with both hands;"]]]
