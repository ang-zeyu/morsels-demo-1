Upon this he resolv'd to open her  Breast and make enquiry; in order to which he provides himself with  sharp Flints, and Splinters of dry Cane almost like Knives, with which  he made an incision between the Ribs, and cutting through the Flesh,  came to the _Diaphragma_; which he finding very Tough and not easily  broken, assur'd himself, that such a Covering must needs belong to that  part which he lookt for, and that if he could once get through that, he  should find it. He met with some difficulty in his Work, because his  Instruments were none of the best, for he had none but such as were made  either of Flint or Cane.    Sec. 20. However, he sharpned 'em again and renewed his Attempt with all  the Skill he was Master of. At last he broke through, and the first part  he met with was the Lungs, which he at first sight mistook, for that  part which he search'd for, and turn'd 'em about this way and that way,  to see if he could find in them the cause of the Disease. He first  happen'd upon that Lobe which lay next the side [which he had open'd]  and when he perceiv'd that it did lean sideways, he was satisfy'd that  it was not the part he look'd for, because he was fully perswaded, that  that must needs be in the midst of the Body, as well in regard of  Latitude as Longitude. He proceeded in his search, till at last he found  the Heart, which when he saw closed with a very strong Cover, and  fastned with strong Ligaments, and covered by the Lungs on that side  which he had open'd; he began to say to himself. \"If this part be so on  the other side as it is on this which I have open'd, then 'tis certainly  in the midst, and without doubt the same I look for; especially  considering the Conveniency of the Situation, the Comliness and  Regularity of its Figure, the Firmness and Solidity of the Flesh, and  besides, its being guarded with such a Membrane as I have not observ'd  in any part.\" Upon this he searches the other side, and finding the same  Membrane on the inside of the Ribs, and the Lungs in the same posture,  which he had observ'd on that side which he had open'd first, he  concluded the Heart to be the part which he look'd for.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration 4]           *       *       *       *       *    Sec. 21. Therefore he first Attacks the _Pericardium_, which, after a long  tryal and a great deal of pains, he made shift to tear; and when he had  laid the Heart bare, and perceiv'd that it was solid on every side, he  began to examin it, to see if he could find any hurt in it; but finding  none, he squeez'd it with his Hands, and perceiv'd that it was hollow.  He began than to think that what he look'd for, might possibly be  contain'd in that Cavity. When he came to open it, he found in it two  Cavities, one on the right side, the other on the left. That on the  right side was full of clotted Blood, that on the left quite empty.  \"Then (says he,) without all doubt, one of those two Cavites must needs  be the Receptacle of what I I look for; as for that on this side there's  nothing in it but congealed Blood, which was not so, be sure, till the  whole Body was in that condition in. which it now is\" (for he had  observ'd that all Blood congeals when it flows from the Body, and that  this Blood did not differ in the least from any other,) \"and therefore  what I look for, cannot by any means, be such a matter as this; for that  which I mean, is something which is peculiar to this place, which I find  I could not subsist without, so much as the Twinkling of an Eye. And  this is that which I look'd for at first. For as for this Blood, how  often have I lost a great deal of it in my Skirmishes with the Wild  Beasts, and yet it never did me any considerable harm, nor rendred me  incapable of performing any Action of Life, and therefore what I look  for is not in this Cavity. Now as for the Cavity on the left side, I  find 'tis altogether empty, and I have no reason in the World to think  that it was made in vain, because I find every part appointed for such  and such particular Functions. How then can this Ventricle of the Heart,  which I see is of so excellent a Frame, serve for no use at all? I  cannot think but that the same thing which I am in search of, once dwelt  here, but has now deserted his Habitation and left it empty, and that  the Absence of that thing, has occasion'd this Privation of Sense and  Cessation of Motion, which happen'd to the Body.\" Now when he perceiv'd  that the Being which had inhabited there before, had left its House  before it fell to Ruine, and forsaken it when as yet it continu'd whole  and entire, he concluded that it was highly probable that it would never  return to it any more, after its being so cut and mangled.    Sec. 22. Upon this the whole Body seem'd to him a very inconsiderable  thing, and worth nothing in respect of that Being, he believed once  inhabited, and now had left it. Therefore he applied himself wholly to  the consideration of that Being. _What it was?_ and _how it subsisted?  what joyn'd it to the Body? Whether it went, and by what passage, when  it left the Body? What was the Cause of its Departure, whether it were  forc'd to leave its Mansion, or left the Body of its own accord? and in  case it went away Voluntarily, what it was that rendred the Body so  disagreeable to it, as to make it forsake it?_ And whilst his Mind was  perplext with such variety of Thoughts, he laid aside all concern for  the Carcass, and threw it away; for now he perceiv'd that his Mother,  which had Nurs'd him so Tenderly and had Suckled him, was _that  something_ which was departed: and from it proceeded all those Actions  by which she shew'd her Care of him, and Affection, to him, and not from  this unactive Body; but that the Body was to it only as an Instrument or  Tool, like his Cudgel which he had made for himself, with which he used  to Fight with the Wild Beasts. So that now, all his regard to the Body  was remov'd, and transferr'd to that by which the Body is governed, and  by whose Power it moves. Nor had he any other desire but to make enquiry  after that.    Sec. 23. In the mean, time the Carcass of the _Roe_ began to putrifie, and  emit Noisome Vapours, which still increas'd his aversion to it, so that  he did not care to see it. 'Twas not long after that he chanc'd to see  two Ravens engag'd so furiously; that one of them struck down the other  Stark Dead; and when he had done, he began to scrape with his Claws till  he had digg'd a Pit, in which he Buried the Carcass of his Adversary.  Our Philosopher observing this, said to himself, _How well has this  Raven done in Burying the Body of his Companion, tho' he did ill in  Killing him? How much greater reason was there for me to have been  forward in performing this Office to my Mother?_ Upon this he makes a  Grave, and lays his Mother into it, and Buries her. He proceeded in his  Enquiry concerning what that should be by which the Body was govern'd,  but could not Apprehend what it was; when he look'd upon the rest of the  Roes, and perceiv'd that they were of the same form and figure with his  Mother, he believ'd that there was in every one of them something which  govern'd and actuated them, like that which had actuated and govern'd  his Mother: formerly: and for the sake of that likeness he us'd to keep  in their Company, and shew affection towards them. He continued a while  in this condition, Contemplating the various kinds of Animals and  Plants, and walking about the Coast of his Island, to see if he could  find any thing like himself; (as he observ'd that every Individual  Animal, and Plant, had a great many more like it.) But all his search  was in vain. And when he perceiv'd that his Island was encompass'd by  the Sea, he thought that there was no other Land in the World but only  that Island.    Sec. 23. It happen'd that by Collision a Fire was kindled among a parcel of  Reeds or Canes; which fear'd him at first, as being a Sight which he was  altogether a Stranger to; so that he stood at a distance a good while,  strangely surpriz'd, at last he came nearer and nearer by degrees, still  observing the Brightness of its Light and marvellous Efficacy in  consuming every thing it touch'd, and changing it into its own Nature;  till at last, his Admiration of it, and that innate Boldness and  Fortitude, which God had implanted in his Nature prompted him on, that  he ventur'd to come near it, and stretch'd out his Hand to take some of  it. But when it burnt his Fingers and he found there was no dealing with  it that way, he endeavour'd to take a stick, which the Fire had not as  yet wholly seiz'd upon; so taking hold on that part which was untouch'd  he easily gain'd his purpose, and carried it Home to his Lodging (for he  had contriv'd for himself a convenient place) there he kept this Fire  and added Fuel to it, admir'd it wonderfully, and tended it night and  day; at night especially, because its Light and Heat supply'd the  absence of the Sun; so that he was extreamly delighted with it, and  reckon'd it the most excellent of all those things which he had about  him. And when he observ'd that it always mov'd upwards, he perswaded  himself that, it was one of those Celestial Substances which he saw  shining in the Firmament, and he was continually trying of its power, by  throwing things into it, which he perceiv'd it operated upon and  consum'd, sometimes sooner, sometimes slower, according as the Bodies  which he put into it were more or less combustible.    Sec. 25. Amongst other things which he put in to try its strength, he once  flung in some Fish which had been thrown a-shore by the Water, and as  soon as e're he smelt the Steam, it rais'd his Appetite, so that he had  a Mind to Taste of them; which he did, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16847"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 3 (#8)"],[1,"of animals.    But the glory of Parakrama Bahu stands up in the later history of  Ceylon like an isolated peak and thirty years after his death the  country had fallen almost to its previous low level of prosperity. The  Tamils again occupied many districts and were never entirely dislodged  as long as the Sinhalese kingdom lasted. Buddhism tended to decline  but was always the religion of the national party and was honoured  with as much magnificence as their means allowed. Parakrama Bahu II  (c. 1240), who recovered the sacred tooth from the Tamils, is said to  have celebrated splendid festivals and to have imported learned monks  from the country of the Colas.[93] Towards the end of the fifteenth  century the inscriptions of Kalyani indicate that Sinhalese religion  enjoyed a great reputation in Burma.[94]    A further change adverse to Buddhism was occasioned by the arrival of  the Portuguese in 1505. A long and horrible struggle ensued between  them and the various kings among whom the distracted island was  divided until at the end of the sixteenth century only Kandy remained  independent, the whole coast being in the hands of the Portuguese. The  singular barbarities which they perpetrated throughout this struggle  are vouched for by their own historians,[95] but it does not appear  that the Sinhalese degraded themselves by similar atrocities.  Since the Portuguese wished to propagate Roman Catholicism as well as  to extend their political rule and used for this purpose (according to  the Mahavamsa) the persuasions of gold as well as the terrors of  torture, it is not surprising if many Sinhalese professed allegiance  to Christianity, but when in 1597 the greater part of Ceylon formally  accepted Portuguese sovereignty, the chiefs insisted that they should  be allowed to retain their own religion and customs.    The Dutch first appeared in 1602 and were welcomed by the Court of  Kandy as allies capable of expelling the Portuguese. This they  succeeded in doing by a series of victories between 1638 and 1658, and  remained masters of a great part of the island until their possessions  were taken by the British in 1795. Kandy however continued independent  until 1815. At first the Dutch tried to enforce Christianity and to  prohibit Buddhism within their territory[96] but ultimately hatred of  the Roman Catholic church made them favourable to Buddhism and they  were ready to assist those kings who desired to restore the national  religion to its former splendour.    4      In spite of this assistance the centuries when the Sinhalese were  contending with Europeans were not a prosperous time for Buddhism.  Hinduism spread in the north,[97] Christianity in the coast belt, but  still it was a point of honour with most native sovereigns to protect  the national religion so far as their distressed condition allowed.  For the seventeenth century we have an interesting account of the  state of the country called _An Historical Relation of the Island of  Ceylon_ by an Englishman, Robert Knox, who was detained by the king of  Kandy from 1660 to 1680. He does not seem to have been aware that  there was any distinction between Buddhism and Hinduism. Though he  describes the Sinhalese as idolaters, he also emphasizes the fact that  Buddou (as he writes the name) is the God \"unto whom the salvation of  souls belongs,\" and for whom \"above all others they have a high  respect and devotion.\" He also describes the ceremonies of pirit  and bana, the perahera procession, and two classes of Buddhist monks,  the elders and the ordinary members of the Sangha. His narrative  indicates that Buddhism was accepted as the higher religion, though  men were prone to pray to deities who would save from temporal danger.    About this time Vimala Dharma II[98] made great efforts to improve the  religious condition of the island and finding that the true succession  had again failed, arranged with the Dutch to send an embassy to Arakan  and bring back qualified Theras. But apparently the steps taken were  not sufficient, for when king Kittisiri Rajasiha (1747-81), whose  piety forms the theme of the last two chapters of the Mahavamsa,  set about reforming the Sangha, he found that duly ordained monks were  extinct and that many so-called monks had families. He therefore  decided to apply to Dhammika, king of Ayuthia in Siam, and like his  predecessor despatched an embassy on a Dutch ship. Dhammika sent back  a company of \"more than ten monks\" (that is more than sufficient for  the performance of all ecclesiastical acts) under the Abbot Upali in  1752 and another to relieve it in 1755.[99] They were received by the  king of Ceylon with great honour and subsequently by the ordination  which they conferred placed the succession beyond dispute. But the  order thus reconstituted was aristocratic and exclusive: only members  of the highest caste were admitted to it and the wealthy middle  classes found themselves excluded from a community which they were  expected to honour and maintain. This led to the despatch of an  embassy to Burma in 1802 and to the foundation of another branch of  the Sangha, known as the Amarapura school, distinct in so far as its  validity depended on Burmese not Siamese ordination.    Since ordination is for Buddhists merely self-dedication to a higher  life and does not confer any sacramental or sacerdotal powers, the  importance assigned to it may seem strange. But the idea goes back to  the oldest records in the Vinaya and has its root in the privileges  accorded to the order. A Bhikkhu had a right to expect much from the  laity, but he also had to prove his worth and Gotama's early  legislation was largely concerned with excluding unsuitable  candidates. The solicitude for valid ordination was only the  ecclesiastical form of the popular feeling that the honours and  immunities of the order were conditional on its maintaining a certain  standard of conduct. Other methods of reform might have been devised,  but the old injunction that a monk could be admitted only by other  duly ordained monks was fairly efficacious and could not be disputed.  But the curious result is that though Ceylon was in early times the  second home of Buddhism, almost all (if indeed not all) the monks  found there now derive their right to the title of Bhikkhu from  foreign countries.    The Sinhalese Sangha is generally described as divided into four schools,  those of Siam, Kelani, Amarapura and Ramanya, of which the first two are  practically identical, Kelani being simply a separate province of the  Siamese school, which otherwise has its headquarters in the inland  districts. This school, founded as mentioned above by priests who arrived  in 1750, comprises about half of the whole Sangha and has some pretensions  to represent the hierarchy of Ceylon, since the last kings of Kandy gave to  the heads of the two great monasteries in the capital, Asgiri and Malwatte,  jurisdiction over the north and south of the island respectively. It  differs in some particulars from the Amarapura school. It only admits  members of the highest caste and prescribes that monks are to wear the  upper robe over one shoulder only, whereas the Amarapurans admit members of  the first three castes (but not those lower in the social scale) and  require both shoulders to be covered. There are other minor differences  among which it is interesting to note that the Siamese school object to the  use of the formula \"I dedicate this gift to the Buddha\" which is used in  the other schools when anything is presented to the order for the use of  the monks. It is held that this expression was correct in the lifetime of  the Buddha but not after his death. The two schools are not mutually  hostile, and members of each find a hospitable reception in the monasteries  of the other. The laity patronize both indifferently and both frequent the  same places of pilgrimage, though all of these and the majority of the  temple lands belong to the sect of Siam. It is wealthy, aristocratic and  has inherited the ancient traditions of Ceylon, whereas the Amarapurans are  more active and inclined to propaganda. It is said they are the chief  allies of the Theosophists and European Buddhists. The Ramanya[100] school  is more recent and distinct than the others, being in some ways a reformed  community. It aims at greater strictness of life, forbidding monasteries to  hold property and insisting on genuine poverty. It also totally rejects the  worship of Hindu deities and its lay members do not recognize the monks of  other schools. It is not large but its influence is considerable.    It has been said that Buddhism flourished in Ceylon only when it was  able to secure the royal favour. There is some truth in this, for the  Sangha does not struggle on its own behalf but expects the laity to  provide for its material needs, making a return in educational and  religious services. Such a body if not absolutely dependent on royal  patronage has at least much to gain from it. Yet this admission must  not blind us to the fact that during its long and often distinguished  history Sinhalese Buddhism has been truly the national faith, as  opposed to the beliefs of various invaders, and has also ministered to  the spiritual aspirations of the nation. As Knox said in a period when  it was not particularly flourishing, the Hindu gods look after worldly  affairs but Buddha after the soul. When the island passed under  British rule and all religions received impartial recognition, the  result was not disastrous to Buddhism: the number of Bhikkhus greatly  increased, especially in the latter half of the nineteenth century.  And if in earlier periods there was an interval in which technically  speaking the Sangha did not exist, this did not mean that interest in  it ceased, for as soon as the kingdom became prosperous the first care  of the kings was to set the Church in order.
