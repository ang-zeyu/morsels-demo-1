Taken  from the 57th and 108th Psalms--        Be Thou exalted, O my God,        Above the heavens where angels dwell;      Thy power on earth be known abroad        And land to land Thy wonders tell.           *       *       *       *       *        High o'er the earth His mercy reigns,        And reaches to the utmost sky;      His truth to endless years remains        When lower worlds dissolve and die.      _THE TUNE._    Haydn furnished it out of his chorus of morning stars, and it was  christened \"Creation,\" after the name of his great oratorio. It is a  march of trumpets.      \"BEFORE JEHOVAH'S AWFUL THRONE.\"    No one could mistake the style of Watts in this sublime ode. He begins  with his foot on Sinai, but flies to Calvary with the angel preacher  whom St. John saw in his Patmos vision:        Before Jehovah's awful throne        Ye nations bow with sacred joy;      Know that the Lord is God alone;        He can create and He destroy.        His sovereign power without our aid        Made us of clay and formed us men,      And when like wandering sheep we stray,        He brought us to His fold again.           *       *       *       *       *        We'll crowd Thy gates with thankful songs,        High as the heaven our voices raise,      And earth with her ten thousand tongues        Shall fill Thy courts with sounding praise.      _TUNE--OLD HUNDRED._    Martin Madan's four-page anthem, \"Denmark,\" has some grand strains in  it, but it is a tune of florid and difficult vocalization, and is now  heard only in Old Folks' Concerts.           *       *       *       *       *    The Rev. Isaac Watts, D.D., was born at Southampton, Eng., in 1674. His  father was a deacon of the Independent Church there, and though not an  uncultured man himself, he is said to have had little patience with the  incurable penchant of his boy for making rhymes and verses. We hear  nothing of the lad's mother, but we can fancy her hand and spirit in the  indulgence of his poetic tastes as well as in his religious training.  The tradition handed down from Dr. Price, a colleague of Watts, relates  that at the age of eighteen Isaac became so irritated at the crabbed and  untuneful hymns sung at the Nonconformist meetings that he complained  bitterly of them to his father. The deacon may have felt something as  Dr. Wayland did when a rather \"fresh\" student criticised the Proverbs,  and hinted that making such things could not be \"much of a job,\" and the  Doctor remarked, \"Suppose _you_ make a few.\" Possibly there was the same  gentle sarcasm in the reply of Deacon Watts to his son, \"Make some  yourself, then.\"    Isaac was in just the mood to take his father at his word, and he  retired and wrote the hymn--        Behold the glories of the Lamb.    There must have been a decent tune to carry it, for it pleased the  worshippers greatly, when it was sung in meeting--and that was the  beginning of Isaac Watts' career as a hymnist.    So far as scholarship was an advantage, the young writer must have been  well equipped already, for as early as the entering of his fifth year he  was learning Latin, and at nine learning Greek; at eleven, French; and  at thirteen, Hebrew. From the day of his first success he continued to  indite hymns for the home church, until by the end of his twenty-second  year he had written one hundred and ten, and in the two following years  a hundred and forty-four more, besides preparing himself for the  ministry. No. 7 in the edition of the first one hundred and ten, was  that royal jewel of all his lyric work--        When I survey the wondrous cross.    Isaac Watts was ordained pastor of an Independent Church in Mark Lane,  London, 1702, but repeated illness finally broke up his ministry, and  he retired, an invalid, to the beautiful home of Sir Thomas Abney at  Theobaldo, invited, as he supposed, to spend a week, but it was really  to spend the rest of his life--thirty-six years.    Numbers of his hymns are cited as having biographical or reminiscent  color. The stanza in--        When I can read my title clear,    --which reads in the original copy,--        Should earth against my soul engage      And _hellish darts be hurled_,      Then I can smile at _Satan's rage_      And face a frowning world,    --is said to have been an allusion to Voltaire and his attack upon the  church, while the calm beauty of the harbor within view of his home is  supposed to have been in his eye when he composed the last stanza,--        There shall I bathe my weary soul        In seas of heavenly rest,      And not a wave of trouble roll        Across my peaceful breast.    According to the record,--        What shall the dying sinner do?    --was one of his \"pulpit hymns,\" and followed a sermon preached from  Rom. 1:16. Another,--        And is this life prolonged to you?    --after a sermon from 1 Cor. 3:22; and another,--        How vast a treasure we possess,    --enforced his text, \"All things are yours.\" The hymn,--        Not all the blood of beasts      On Jewish altars slain,    --was, as some say, suggested to the writer by a visit to the abattoir  in Smithfield Market. The same hymn years afterwards, discovered, we are  told, in a printed paper wrapped around a shop bundle, converted a  Jewess, and influenced her to a life of Christian faith and sacrifice.    A young man, hardened by austere and minatory sermons, was melted, says  Dr. Belcher, by simply reading,--        Show pity Lord, O Lord, forgive,      Let a repenting sinner live.    --and became partaker of a rich religious experience.    The summer scenery of Southampton, with its distant view of the Isle of  Wight, was believed to have inspired the hymnist sitting at a parlor  window and gazing across the river Itchen, to write the stanza--        Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood        Stand drest in living green;      So to the Jews old Canaan stood        While Jordan rolled between.    The hymn, \"Unveil thy bosom, faithful tomb,\" was personal, addressed by  Watts \"to Lucius on the death of Seneca.\"    A severe heart-trial was the occasion of another hymn. When a young man  he proposed marriage to Miss Elizabeth Singer, a much-admired young  lady, talented, beautiful, and good. She rejected him--kindly but  finally. The disappointment was bitter, and in the first shadow of it he  wrote,--        How vain are all things here below,      How false and yet how fair.    Miss Singer became the celebrated Mrs. Elizabeth Rowe, the spiritual and  poetic beauty of whose _Meditations_ once made a devotional text-book  for pious souls. Of Dr. Watts and his offer of his hand and heart, she  always said, \"I loved the jewel, but I did not admire the casket.\" The  poet suitor was undersized, in habitually delicate health--and not  handsome.    But the good minister and scholar found noble employment to keep his  mind from preying upon itself and shortening his days. During his long  though afflicted leisure he versified the Psalms, wrote a treatise on  _Logic_, an _Introduction to the Study of Astronomy and Geography_, and  a work _On the Improvement of the Mind_; and died in 1748, at the age of  seventy-four.      \"O FOR A THOUSAND TONGUES TO SING.\"    Charles Wesley, the author of this hymn, took up the harp of Watts when  the older poet laid it down. He was born at Epworth, Eng., in 1708, the  third son of Rev. Samuel Wesley, and died in London, March 29, 1788. The  hymn is believed to have been written May 17, 1739, for the anniversary  of his own conversion:        O for a thousand tongues to sing        My great Redeemer's praise,      The glories of my God and King,        And triumphs of His grace.    The remark of a fervent Christian friend, Peter Bohler, \"Had I a  thousand tongues I would praise Christ Jesus with them all,\" struck an  answering chord in Wesley's heart, and he embalmed the wish in his  fluent verse. The third stanza (printed as second in some hymnals), has  made language for pardoned souls for at least four generations:        Jesus! the name that calms our fears        And bids our sorrows cease;     'Tis music in the sinner's ears,       'Tis life and health and peace.    Charles Wesley was the poet of the soul, and knew every mood. In the  words of Isaac Taylor, \"There is no main article of belief ... no moral  sentiment peculiarly characteristic of the gospel that does not find  itself ... pointedly and clearly conveyed in some stanza of Charles  Wesley's poetry.\" And it does not dim the lustre of Watts, considering  the marvellous brightness, versatility and felicity of his greatest  successor, to say of the latter, with the _London Quarterly_, that he  \"was, perhaps, the most gifted minstrel of the modern Church.\"    [Illustration: Charles Wesley]    Most of the hymns of this good man were hymns of experience--and this is  why they are so dear to the Christian heart. The music of eternal life  is in them. The happy glow of a single line in one of them--        Love Divine, all loves excelling,    --thrills through them all. He led a spotless life from youth to old  age, and grew unceasingly in spiritual knowledge and sweetness. His  piety and purity were the weapons that alike humbled his scoffing fellow  scholars at Oxford, and conquered the wild colliers of Kingwood. With  his brother John, through persecution and ridicule, he preached and sang  that Divine Love to his countrymen and in the wilds of America, and on  their return to England his quenchless melodies multiplied till they  made an Evangelical literature around his name. His hymns--he wrote no  less than six thousand--are a liturgy not only for the Methodist Church  but for English-speaking Christendom.    The voices of Wesley and Watts cannot be hidden,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18445"],[0,"Bohemians of the Latin Quarter (#8)"],[1,"it away with me this morning. Ah! we shall see. I put it  in my pocket. Why, confound it, here it is still!\" he exclaimed,  displaying a key. \"This is witchcraft.\"    \"Phantasmagoria,\" said Colline.    \"Fancy,\" added Rodolphe.    \"But,\" resumed Schaunard, whose voice betrayed a commencement of alarm,  \"do you hear that?\"    \"What?\"    \"What?\"    \"My piano, which is playing of its own accord _do la mi re do, la si sol  re._ Scoundrel of a re, it is still false.\"    \"But it cannot be in your room,\" said Rodolphe, and he added in a  whisper to Colline, against whom he was leaning heavily, \"he is tight.\"    \"So I think. In the first place, it is not a piano at all, it is a  flute.\"    \"But you are screwed too, my dear fellow,\" observed the poet to the  philosopher, who had sat down on the landing, \"it is a violin.\"    \"A vio--, pooh! I say, Schaunard,\" hiccupped Colline, pulling his friend  by the legs, \"here is a joke, this gentleman makes out that it is a  vio--\"    \"Hang it all,\" exclaimed Schaunard in the height of terror, \"it is  magic.\"    \"Phantasma-goria,\" howled Colline, letting fall one of the bottles he  held by his hand.    \"Fancy,\" yelled Rodolphe in turn.    In the midst of this uproar the room door suddenly opened, and an  individual holding a triple-branched candlestick in which pink candles  were burning, appeared on the threshold.    \"What do you want, gentlemen?\" asked he, bowing courteously to the three  friends.    \"Good heavens, what am I about? I have made a mistake, this is not my  room,\" said Schaunard.    \"Sir,\" added Colline and Rodolphe, simultaneously, addressing the person  who had opened the door, \"be good enough to excuse our friend, he is as  drunk as three fiddlers.\"    Suddenly a gleam of lucidity flashed through Schaunard's intoxication,  he read on his door these words written in chalk:         \"I have called three times for my New Year's gift--PHEMIE.\"    \"But it is all right, it is all right, I am indeed at home,\" he  exclaimed, \"here is the visiting card Phemie left me on New Year's Day;  it is really my door.\"    \"Good heavens, sir,\" said Rodolphe, \"I am truly bewildered.\"    \"Believe me, sir,\" added Colline, \"that for my part, I am an active  partner in my friend's confusion.\"    The young fellow who had opened the door could not help laughing.    \"If you come into my room for a moment,\" he replied, \"no doubt your  friend, as soon as he has looked around, will see his mistake.\"    \"Willingly.\"    And the poet and philosopher each taking Schaunard by an arm, led him  into the room, or rather the palace of Marcel, whom no doubt our readers  have recognized.    Schaunard cast his eyes vaguely around him, murmuring, \"It is  astonishing how my dwelling is embellished!\"    \"Well, are you satisfied now?\" asked Colline.    But Schaunard having noticed the piano had gone to it, and was playing  scales.    \"Here, you fellows, listen to this,\" said he, striking the notes, \"this  is something like, the animal has recognized his master,_ si la sol, fa  mi re._ Ah! wretched re, you are always the same. I told you it was my  instrument.\"    \"He insists on it,\" said Colline to Rodolphe.    \"He insists on it,\" repeated Rodolphe to Marcel.    \"And that,\" added Schaunard, pointing to the star-adorned petticoat that  was lying on a chair, \"it is not an adornment of mine, perhaps? Ah!\"    And he looked Marcel straight in the face.    \"And this,\" continued he, unfastening from the wall the notice to quit  already spoken of.    And he began to read, \"Therefore Monsieur Schaunard is hereby required  to give up possession of the said premises, and to leave them in  tenantable repair, before noon on the eighth day of April. As witness  the present formal notice to quit, the cost of which is five francs.\"  \"Ha! ha! so I am not the Monsieur Schaunard to whom formal notice to  quit is given at a cost of five francs? And these, again,\" he continued,  recognizing his slippers on Marcel's feet, \"are not those my papouches,  the gift of a beloved hand? It is your turn, sir,\" said he to Marcel,  \"to explain your presence amongst my household goods.\"    \"Gentlemen,\" replied Marcel, addressing himself more especially to  Colline and Rodolphe, \"this gentleman,\" and he pointed to Schaunard, \"is  at home, I admit.\"    \"Ah!\" exclaimed Schaunard, \"that's lucky.\"    \"But,\" continued Marcel, \"I am at home too.\"    \"But, sir,\" broke in Rodolphe, \"if our friend recognizes--\"    \"Yes,\" said Colline, \"if our friend--\"    \"And if on your side you recall that--,\" added Rodolphe, \"how is it  that--\"    \"Yes,\" replied his echo Colline, \"how is it that--\"    \"Have the kindness to sit down, gentlemen,\" replied Marcel, \"and I will  explain the mystery to you.\"    \"If we were to liquify the explanation?\" risked Colline.    \"Over a mouthful of something,\" added Rodolphe.    The four young fellows sat down to table and attacked a piece of cold  veal which the wine-shop keeper had let them have.    Marcel then explained what had taken place in the morning between  himself and the landlord when he had come to move in.    \"Then,\" observed Rodolphe, \"this gentleman is quite right, and we are in  his place?\"    \"You are at home,\" said Marcel politely.    But it was a tremendous task to make Schaunard understand what had taken  place. A comical incident served to further complicate the situation.  Schaunard, when looking for something in a sideboard, found the change  of the five hundred franc note that Marcel had handed to Monsieur  Bernard that morning.    \"Ah! I was quite sure,\" he exclaimed, \"that Fortune would not desert me.  I remember now that I went out this morning to run after her. On account  of its being quarter-day she must have looked in during my absence. We  crossed one another on the way, that it is. How right I was to leave the  key in my drawer!\"    \"Delightful madness!\" murmured Rodolphe, looking at Schaunard, who was  building up the money in equal piles.    \"A dream, a falsehood, such is life,\" added the philosopher.    Marcel laughed.    An hour later they had all four fallen asleep.    The next day they woke up at noon, and at first seemed very much  surprised to find themselves together. Schaunard, Colline, and Rodolphe  did not appear to recognize one another, and addressed one another as  \"sir.\" Marcel had to remind them that they had come together the evening  before.    At that moment old Durand entered the room.    \"Sir,\" said he to Marcel, \"it is the month of April, eighteen hundred  and forty, there is mud in the streets, and His Majesty Louis-Philippe  is still King of France and Navarre. What!\" exclaimed the porter on  seeing his former tenant, \"Monsieur Schaunard, how did you come here?\"    \"By the telegraph,\" replied Schaunard.    \"Ah!\" replied the porter, \"you are still a joker--\"    \"Durand,\" said Marcel, \"I do not like subordinates mingling in  conversation with me, go to the nearest restaurant and have a breakfast  for four sent up. Here is the bill of fare,\" he added, handing him a  slip of paper on which he had written it. \"Go.\"    \"Gentlemen,\" continued Marcel, addressing the three young fellows, \"you  invited me to supper last night, allow me to offer you a breakfast this  morning, not in my room, but in ours,\" he added, holding out his hand to  Schaunard.    \"Oh! no,\" said Schaunard sentimentally, \"let us never leave one  another.\"    \"That's right, we are very comfortable here,\" added Colline.    \"To leave you for a moment,\" continued Rodolphe. \"Tomorrow the 'Scarf of  Iris,' a fashion paper of which I am editor, appears, and I must go and  correct my proofs; I will be back in an hour.\"    \"The deuce!\" said Colline, \"that reminds me that I have a lesson to give  to an Indian prince who has come to Paris to learn Arabic.\"    \"Go tomorrow,\" said Marcel.    \"Oh, no!\" said the philosopher, \"the prince is to pay me today. And then  I must acknowledge to you that this auspicious day would be spoilt for  me if I did not take a stroll amongst the bookstalls.\"    \"But will you come back?\" said Schaunard.    \"With the swiftness of an arrow launched by a steady hand,\" replied the  philosopher, who loved eccentric imagery.    And he went out with Rodolphe.    \"In point of fact,\" said Schaunard when left alone with Marcel, \"instead  of lolling on the sybarite's pillow, suppose I was to go out to seek  some gold to appease the cupidity of Monsieur Bernard?\"    \"Then,\" said Marcel uneasily, \"you still mean to move?\"    \"Hang it,\" replied Schaunard, \"I must, since I have received a formal  notice to quit, at a cost of five francs.\"    \"But,\" said Marcel, \"if you move, shall you take your furniture with  you?\"    \"I have that idea. I will not leave a hair, as Monsieur Bernard says.\"    \"The deuce! That will be very awkward for me,\" said Marcel, \"since I  have hired your room furnished.\"    \"There now, that's so,\" replied Schaunard. \"Ah! bah,\" he added in a  melancholy tone, \"there is nothing to prove that I shall find my  thousand francs today, tomorrow, or even later on.\"    \"Stop a bit,\" exclaimed Marcel, \"I have an idea.\"    \"Unfold it.\"    \"This is the state of things. Legally, this lodging is mine, since I  have paid a month in advance.\"    \"The lodging, yes, but as to the furniture, if I pay, I can legally take  it away, and if it were possible I would even take it away illegally.\"    \"So that,\" continued Marcel, \"you have furniture and no lodging, and I  have lodging and no furniture.\"    \"That is the position,\" observed Schaunard.    \"This lodging suits me,\" said Marcel.    \"And for my part is has never suited me better,\" said Schaunard.    \"Well then, we can settle this business,\" resumed Marcel, \"stay with me,  I will apply house-room, and you shall supply the furniture.\"    \"And the rent?\" said Schaunard.    \"Since I have some money just now I will pay it, it will be your turn  next time. Think about it.\"    \"I never think about anything, above all accepting a suggestion which  suits me."]]]
