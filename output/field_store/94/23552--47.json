As for Augustus Vernon Robert Todd\"--we all yelled  with laughter as Dr. Moore scrambled in hot haste through Todd's awful  list of names, but were again quiet when he dropped his eye-glasses from  his eagle's beak, a sure sign he was going to \"savage\" somebody--\"as for  _his_ performance in this _examination_, I can only regard it as  a very bad practical joke, or as his _ballon d'essai_ for some  kindergarten scholarship.\"    Raven got up from his seat near the door. He was pale to the lips, but his  voice was clear and unhesitating. \"If you please, sir, may I say a word?\"    \"Eh, what?\" said Corker. \"Say a word? Oh, certainly.\"    \"I am very glad indeed to hear that I have won the Perry Exhibition. I  know in my own mind that I could never have beaten my friend Hodgson if I  had not had Acton's help. I owe the winning of the Exhibition entirely to  him, for he has read the whole of the classics with me and helped me in  every way in his power. I cannot thank him enough for all he has done, but  at least I owe him this open acknowledgment.\"    Corker looked no end pleased, and turned round and beamed on Biffen, whose  good-natured easy face shone with pleasure and delight.    \"Biffen,\" said good old Corker, audibly, \"your house is fortunate in  having Acton, and St. Amory such a good amateur coach in classics.  Cock-house, too, bless me!\"    And can you wonder that Biffen's, frenzied with delight, carried Raven and  Acton shoulder high through the gas-lit streets?    Whilst the Biffenites were thus shouting their way home, one unhappy youth  hurried to his room feeling as though the moon had fallen out of heaven  and crushed him--Todd. After that night when he had made the bet with  Cotton, he had neither worked for the Perry nor yet left it alone, but  loafed about with Cotton as usual, and piffled with the work for the  Exhibition. As a last-lap spurt, he had, in the last week or so,  desperately stuffed himself with cunning tips leading twistingly to  nowhere. Never had any one faced a serious examination with such a rag-bag  of tips as Todd, and the examination had found him out with a vengeance.  As he slunk along to his quarters, Corker's words were buzzing in his ears  unendingly. \"As for Augustus Vernon Robert Todd\"--\"_ballon  d'essai_\"--\"Kindergarten!\" Oh! it was a sickener, and how the fellows had  laughed!    As for his bet with Cotton about cock-house, why, he had, when he saw  those goals put on at the last moment, felt a cold shiver run down his  back. He had crawled off the Acres a sick and sorry and miserable wretch.  Cotton had, being rather riled at his chum's temper for the last month,  hinted, in unmistakable terms, that the debt was to be paid on return  after holidays. Todd contemplated the ravishing prospect of the future  with unmixed feelings. Between the upper and nether millstones of the lost  Exhibition and the lost bet he had been crashed, annihilated!    When he had shut the study door, in sheer despair of spirit, he laid his  head on the table and--Well, did he blub? All I know is, the Rev. E.  Taylor knocked at the door once, twice, thrice, and Todd heard him not.  The house master came in and surveyed the bowed form of poor Gus with a  good-natured smile, tempered with some scorn. He took the liberty of  loudly poking Gus's decaying fire, whereat the young gentleman sprang up  instanter.    \"I knocked, Todd, but I suppose you were thinking too deeply to hear me.\"    \"Sorry, sir,\" said Gus, hurriedly getting the master a chair, \"and, as a  matter of fact, I was thinking.\"    \"Yes!\"    \"What an awful ass I've been, sir!\" \"I don't know quite about the ass, but  you've certainly not been an epitome of all that's wise this term. It was  on that very subject that I came here to have a word with you before we go  for the holidays.\"    Gus looked blankly into the grate.    \"This exhibition of yours, Todd, in the examination is just the answer you  might expect to the problem you've set yourself. 'How can I get something  of value by doing nothing for it?' I must say... etc.\" Taylor spoke very  much to the point to Todd for about half an hour, taking the ribs out of  Gus's conceit one by one, until he felt very much like a damp, damaged  gamp, and about as helpless. One by one he took him through the catalogue  of the aimless, stupid, footling performances in the term, and Gus blankly  wondered how the dickens Taylor knew quite so much of his doings, He felt  that the house master was not a bad imitation of Corker on a flaying  expedition. I must say that Taylor's performance was a considerable trifle  above the average \"beak's wigging,\" but the sting of his discourse was in  the tail. \"Now, Todd, would you like me to ask Dr. Moore to transfer you  to some other house, where your very intimate friends will not absorb so  much of your time?\"    Todd blushed purple at this very broad hint.    \"I'd rather stay where I am; I am not quite an incapable, sir.\"    \"No; I don't think you are--not quite. Dr. Moore, however, is somewhat out  of patience with you, and proposes drastic measures.\"    \"Home?\" inquired Todd, with gloomy conviction.    \"Yes,\" said the house master. \"Dr. Moore has written your father. But you  are coming back next term, when you will have the chance of showing that  that awful performance in the Exhibition is not your true form. I hope  you'll take it.\"    Todd said bitterly, \"I will, sir.\"    \"I am glad of that,\" said Taylor, \"and I believe you will. Good night,  Todd.\"    \"Good night, sir.\"    Todd packed up his portmanteaux that night as gloomily and as savagely as  though his shirts were his deadly enemies. But there was a square,  determined thrust-out of his weak chin which boded ill for Jim Cotton's  classics and mathematics in the future.          CHAPTER VIII    BIFFEN'S CONCERT      It was the inalienable right of the juniors of the cock-house to give a  concert the last night of the term, and to have free and undisputed  possession of the concert-room. Corker made it a rule that the captain of  the school should be there to see there were no riots, which, as the fags  were off home on the morrow, was more than possible. So when I got a  polite note from Grim about half an hour after the results of the Perry  Exhibition had been announced, telling me that Corker had given the  customary consent, I strolled about looking up a cohort of monitors to  help me in maintaining the \"sacred cause of order and decency.\" I knew of  old those junior concerts. \"Pandemonium\" was nearer the word.    Biffen's juniors, red-hot from their exertions and hoarse from their  shouting in the speech-room, held a meeting in their own private quarters  to deliberate as to their concert.    \"I vote Father Grim to the chair,\" said Wilson.    \"Thanks, my son,\" said Grim, with alacrity \"Somebody second that, and  let's get to business.\"    Somebody obligingly seconded, and Grim enthroned himself with dignity in  the chair, and said cheerfully, \"Carried _nem. con._ That's the way  to commence biz. Now, you fellows, I thank you for this unexpected honour,  which has quite taken me by surprise. I shall always--\"    \"Shut up, Grim,\" said Brown. \"You know jolly well you asked Wilson to  propose you.\"    \"All right, Brown; I'll talk with you afterwards. Sorry your Roman nose is  out of joint; but nobody proposed you, you know, so shut up. Gentlemen--\"    \"Hear, hear!\"    \"Biffen's are cock-house at last\" (deafening cheers) \"and we must make our  concert a stunner. It must go with a bang from start to finish. It must  lick every other fag's concert that ever was, and 'be the bright harbinger  of--' What is the rest of the quote, Wilson?\"    \"'Of future joys,' you ass.\"    \"'Of future joys,' you asses.\"    \"I'll punch your head, Grim; you said you remembered it.\"    \"All serene, old man, never mind the cackle.\"    \"What about our concert?\" asked Brown.    \"It's going to be great. Does any one happen to have a programme of that  awful performance of Corker's house last year?\"    \"Rather!\" said half a dozen of Biffen's ornaments. \"Did you think we'd  burn a curiosity like that?\"    \"Cut out and get yours, Rogers, my pet.\"    \"My pet\" bolted and came back with the year-old programme of the Corker's  fags.    \"Pass the abomination this way, Rogers. Gentlemen,\" said Grim, with  intense scorn, \"those unspeakable Corker asses started off with a  prologue.\"    \"We must go one better--eh, you fellows?\" said Rogers.    \"Rather!\" they all shrieked.    \"I vote,\" said young Cherry, \"that we lead off with an epilogue. That will  leave 'em standing.\"    \"Hear, hear!\" said Fruity.    \"Who'll second that?\" said Grim.    \"I will,\" said Rogers, cheerfully.    \"Then do it, you ass,\" said the chairman.    \"I second,\" said Rogers, hurriedly, \"and you needn't be so beastly strict,  Grim.\"    \"Gentlemen, the proposal before the meeting is that we lead off with an  epilogue. Item number one on the programme to be 'An Epilogue.' Those in  favour signify. Carried unanimously.\"    \"I say, Grim, what is an epilogue, anyhow?\" said a voice.    \"Oh, I say,\" said the chairman, \"pass that young ignoramus this way. Lamb,  do you mean to say you don't know what an epilogue is?\"    \"No, I don't.\"    \"This is sickening,\" said Grim, with disgust. \"A fellow in Biffen's not  know what an epilogue is! Tell him, Fruity,\" he added, with pathetic  vexation.    \"He asked you,\" said Cherry, hurriedly.    \"I'm the chairman,\" said Grim, in a wax, but with great relief. \"Explain  away, Fruity!\"    \"Oh, every first-class concert starts with one,\" he said vaguely.    \"See now, Lamb?\"    Lamb professed himself satisfied, but he did not appear absolutely blinded  by the light either.    \"Anyhow,\" said Wilson, \"Fruity will see to that. I propose he does.\"    \"I second it,\" said Lamb, viciously, whereupon Cherry kicked the seconder  on the shins, for he did not exactly thirst for that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14776"],[0,"The Arabian Art of Taming and Training Wild & Vicious Horses (#8)"],[1,"him for that? If so, he should whip him again for not knowing how to talk.  A man that wants to act with any rationality or reason should not fly into  a passion, but should always think before he strikes. It takes a steady  pressure against the collar to move a load, and you cannot expect him to  act with a steady, determined purpose while you are whipping him. There is  hardly one balking horse in five hundred that will pull true from  whipping; it is only adding fuel to fire, and will make them more liable  to balk another time. You always see horses that have been balked a few  times, turn their heads and look back, as soon as they are a little  frustrated. This is because they have been whipped and are afraid of what  is behind them. This is an invariable rule with balked horses, just as  much as it is for them to look around at their sides when they have the  bots; in either case they are deserving of the same sympathy and the same  kind, rational treatment.    When your horse balks, or is a little excited, if he wants to start  quickly, or looks around and don't want to go, there is something wrong,  and needs kind he treatment immediately. Caress him kindly, and if he  don't understand at once what you want him to do he will not be so much  excited as to jump and break things, and do everything wrong through fear.  As long as you are calm and can keep down the excitement of the horse,  there are ten chances to have him understand you, where there would not be  one under harsh treatment, and then the little _flare up_ would not carry  with it any unfavorable recollections, and he would soon forget all about  it, and learn to pull true. Almost every wrong act the horse commits is  from mismanagement, fear or excitement; one harsh word will so excite a  nervous horse as to increase his pulse ten beats in a minute.    When we remember that we are dealing with dumb brutes, and reflect how  difficult it must be for them to understand our motions, signs and  language, we should never get out of patience with them because they don't  understand us, or wonder at their doing things wrong. With all our  intellect, if we were placed in the horse's situation, it would be  difficult for us to understand the driving of some foreigner, of foreign  ways and foreign language. We should always recollect that our ways and  language are just as foreign and unknown to the horse as any language in  the world is to us, and should try to practice what we could understand,  were we the horse, endeavoring by some simple means to work on his  understanding rather than on the different parts of his body. All balked  horses can be started true and steady in a few minutes time; they are all  willing to pull as soon as they know how, and I never yet found a balked  horse that I could not teach him to start his load in fifteen, and often  less than three minutes time.    Almost any team, when first balked, will start kindly, if you let them  stand five or ten minutes, as though there was nothing wrong, and then  speak to them with a steady voice, and turn them a little to the right or  left, so as to get them both in motion before they feel the pinch of the  load. But if you want to start a team that you are not driving yourself,  that has been balked, fooled and whipped for some time, go to them and  hang the lines on their hames, or fasten them to the wagon, so that they  will be perfectly loose; make the driver and spectators (if there is any)  stand off some distance to one side, so as not to attract the attention of  the horses; unloose their checkreins, so that they can get their heads  down, if they choose; let them stand a few minutes in this condition,  until you can see that they are a little composed. While they are standing  you should be about their heads, gentling them; it will make them a little  more kind, and the spectators will think that you are doing something that  they do not understand, and will not learn the secret. When you have them  ready to start, stand before them, and as you seldom have but one balky  horse in a team, get as near in front of him as you can, and if he is too  fast for the other horse, let his nose come against your breast; this will  keep him steady, for he will go slow rather than run on you; turn them  gently to the right, without letting them pull on the traces, as far as  the tongue will let them go; stop them with a kind word, gentle them a  little, and then turn them back to the left, by the same process. You will  have them under your control by this time, and as you turn them again to  the right, steady them in the collar, and you can take them where you  please.    There is a quicker process that will generally start a balky horse, but  not so sure. Stand him a little ahead, so that his shoulders will be  against the collar, and then take up one of his fore feet in your hand,  and let the driver start them, and when the weight comes against his  shoulders, he will try to step; then let him have his foot, and he will go  right along. If you want to break a horse from balking that has long been  in that habit, you ought to set apart a half day for that purpose. Put him  by the side of some steady horse; have check lines on them; tie up all the  traces and straps, so that there will be nothing to excite them; do not  rein them up, but let them have their heads loose. Walk them about  together for some time as slowly and lazily as possible; stop often, and  go up to your balky horse and gentle him. Do not take any whip about him,  or do any thing to excite him, but keep him just as quiet as you can. He  will soon learn to start off at the word, and stop whenever you tell him.    As soon as he performs right, hitch him in an empty wagon; have it stand  in a favorable position for starting. It would be well to shorten the stay  chain behind the steady horse, so that if it is necessary he can take the  weight of the wagon the first time you start them. Do not drive but a few  rods at first; watch your balky horse closely, and if you see that he is  getting balky, stop him before he stops of his own accord, caress him a  little, and start again. As soon as they go well, drive them over a small  hill a few times, and then over a large one, occasionally adding a little  load. This process will make any horse true to pull.      TO BREAK A HORSE TO HARNESS.    Take him in a tight stable, as you did to ride him; take the harness and  go through the same process that you did with the saddle, until you get  him familiar with them, so that you can put them on him and rattle them  about without his caring for them. As soon as he will bear this, put on  the lines, caress him as you draw them over him, and drive him about in  the stable till he will bear them over his hips. The _lines_ are a great  aggravation to some colts, and often frighten them as much as if you were  to raise a whip over them. As soon as he is familiar with the harness and  line, take him out and put him by the side of a gentle horse, and go  through the same process that you did with the balking horse. Always use a  bridle without blinds when you are breaking a horse to harness.      HOW TO HITCH A HORSE IN A SULKY.    Lead him to and around it; let him look at it, touch it with his nose, and  stand by it till he does not care for it; then pull the shafts a little to  the left, and stand by your horse in front of the off wheel. Let some one  stand on the right side of the horse, and hold him by the bit, while you  stand on the left side, facing the sulky. This will keep him straight. Run  your left hand back and let it rest on his hip, and lay hold of the shafts  with your right, bringing them up very gently to the left hand, which  still remains stationary. Do not let anything but your arm touch his back,  and as soon as you have the shafts square over him, let the person on the  opposite side take hold of one of them and lower them very gently on the  shaft bearers. Be very slow and deliberate about hitching; the longer time  you take, the better, as a general thing. When you have the shafts placed,  shake them slightly, so that he will feel them against each side. As soon  as he will bear them without scaring, fasten your braces, etc., and start  him along very slowly. Let one man lead the horse to keep him gentle,  while the other gradually works back with the lines till he can get behind  and drive him. After you have driven him in this way a short distance, you  can get into the sulky, and all will go right. It is very important to  have your horse go gently, when you first hitch him. After you have walked  him awhile, there is not half so much danger of his scaring. Men do very  wrong to jump up behind a horse to drive him as soon as they have him  hitched. There are too many things for him to comprehend all at once. The  shafts, the lines, the harness, and the rattling of the sulky, all tend to  scare him, and he must be made familiar with them by degrees. If your  horse is very wild, I would advise you to put up one foot the first time  you drive him.      HOW TO MAKE A HORSE LIE DOWN.    Every thing that we want to learn the horse must be commenced in some way  to give him an idea of what you want him to do, and then be repeated till  he learns it perfectly. To make a horse lie down, bend his left fore leg,  and slip a loop over it, so that he cannot get it down. Then put a  circingle around his body, and fasten one end of a long strap around the  other fore leg, just above the hoof. Place the other end under the  circingle, so as to keep the strap in the right hand; stand on the left  side of the horse, grasp the bit in your left hand, pull steadily on the  strap with your right; bear against his shoulder till you cause him to  move. As soon as he lifts his weight, your pulling will raise the other  foot, and he will have to come on his knees. Keep the strap tight in your  hand, so that he cannot straighten"]]]
