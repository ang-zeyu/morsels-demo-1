The female has eyes smaller, darker, and very far apart, and the whole  face is perfectly black. The abdomen is broad, of a shining blue-black  color, very sparsely covered with black hairs, except on the first  large segment nearest the thorax. On this segment they are more dense  and of the same tawny color as those on the thorax. But it is  particularly from the character of the head that the amateur observer  of the perforators may soon learn to distinguish between a Xylocopa  and a Bombus as they work among the flowers. It is also interesting to  know that the Xylocopas are not so inclined to sting as the humble  bees, and the males, of course, being without stinging organs, may be  handled with impunity.    Among other insects, honey bees have been said to perforate flowers,  but authentic instances are rare of their doing much damage, or even  making holes. I have only recorded a single instance, and in this a  honey bee was seen to perforate the fragile spurs of Impatiens. When  searching for nectar they quite commonly use the perforations of other  insects. Wasps and other allied insects also perforate for nectar. My  only observations being a Vespa puncturing Cassandra calyculata, an  Andrena (?) perforating the spurs of Aguilegia, and Adynerus  foraminatus biting holes close to the base on the upper side of  rhododendron flowers. The holes made by some of the wasp-like insects  are often more or less circular and with clean-cut edges. The ravages  committed by larvae, beetles and other insects in devouring flowers, or  parts of them, do not properly come under the head of perforations.    The question as to the cause of the handsome corollas of the trumpet  creeper (Tecoma radicans) being so often split and torn has been  accounted for in various ways in published notes on the subject.  Humming birds and ants have been blamed, the humming birds being such  constant visitors of these flowers that it really seemed as though  they must be the authors of the mischief. I have often watched them  when they appeared as though they were pecking at the blossoms, but  careful examinations, both before and after their visits, always  failed to show any trace of injury. Finally, on July 26, 1890, I was  rewarded by seeing a number of Baltimore orioles vigorously pecking at  and tearing open a lot of fresh blossoms, and this observation was  afterward repeated. That the oriole should do this was not surprising,  considering its known habits in relation to some other flowers. J.G.  JACK.    [Mr. Jack adds a list of sixteen plants whose flowers he has seen  punctured by the carpenter bee and seventeen others whose flowers were  punctured by the humble bee. He names more than thirty other flowers  which he has found perforated without having seen or identified the  authors of the mischief.--ED.]--_Garden and Forest_.           *       *       *       *       *          ELECTRICITY IN HORTICULTURE.      The influence of electricity upon vegetation has been the subject of  numerous investigations. Some have been made to ascertain the effects  of the electric current through the soil; others to ascertain the  effect of the electric light upon growth through the air. Among the  latter are those of Prof. L.H. Bailey of the Cornell University  Agricultural Experiment Station. In Bulletin No. 30 of the  Horticultural Department is given an account of experiments with the  electric light upon the growth of certain vegetables, like endive,  spinach, and radish; and upon certain flowers like the heliotrope,  petunia, verbena primula, etc. The results are interesting and  somewhat variable. The forcing house where the experiments were  carried on was 20 x 60 ft., and was divided into two portions by a  partition. In one of these the plants received light from the sun by  day and were in darkness at night. In the other they received the  sunlight and in addition had the benefit of an arc light the whole or  a part of the night. The experiment lasted from January until April  during two years, six weeks of the time the first year with a naked  light and the balance of the time with the light protected by an  ordinary white globe. It is not the purpose here to enter into any  great details, but to give the general conclusions.    The effect of the naked light running all night was to hasten  maturity, the nearer the plants being to the light the greater being  the acceleration. The lettuce, spinach, etc., \"ran to seed\" in the  \"light\" house long before similar plants in the dark. An examination  of the spinach leaves with the microscope showed the same amount of  starch in each, but in the electric light plants the grains were  larger, had more distinct markings and gave a deeper color with  iodine.    With lettuce it was found that the nearer the plants were to the light  the worse the effect; and conversely those furthest away were the best  developed. Cress and endive gave the same results. In the case of the  latter, some of the plants were shaded from the light by an iron post,  and these grew better and were larger than those exposed to its direct  rays. The average weight of eight plants in full light was 49.6  grains, as opposed to an average of six plants in the shade of 93.8  grains. Radishes were strongly attracted to the light and moved toward  it during the night. During the day they straightened up, but moved  again toward the light at night. The plants nearest the lamp made a  poor growth and were nearly dead at the end of six weeks. Averaging  the weight of plant, of top and of tuber, it was found that those  grown in the dark were heavier in every instance than those grown in  the light; and the percentage of marketable tubers from the  light-grown plants was twenty-seven, as opposed to seventy-eight in  the dark. Chemical analyses showed the plants in the light to be more  mature than those in the dark, although they were much smaller. Dwarf  peas showed the same facts, those in full light being smaller than  those in the dark. The former bloomed a week earlier than the latter,  but the production of seed was less, being only about four-sevenths as  great.    Further experiments were made by excluding the sun during the day and  exposing the plants to the diffused electric light only. In all cases,  with radishes, lettuce, peas, corn, and potatoes, the plants died in  about four weeks. Only a little starch and no chlorophyl was found in  the plants deprived of sunlight and only receiving the electric light.  Thus the experiments with a naked light showed conclusively that  \"within range of an ordinary forcing house the naked arc light running  continuously through the night is injurious to some plants.\" In no  case did it prove profitable.    Experiments with the light inclosed in a white globe and running all  night were different in their results. The effect was much less  marked. Lettuce was decidedly better in the light house; radishes were  thrifty but did not produce as much as in the dark house. A third  series of experiments with the naked light running a part of the night  only were also made. Radishes, peas, lettuce, and many flowers were  experimented upon. The lettuce was greatly benefited by the light.  \"Three weeks after transplanting (Feb. 5),\" we are told, \"both  varieties in the lighthouse were fully 50 per cent. in advance of  those in the dark house in size, and the color and other characters of  the plants were fully as good. The plants had received at this time  701/2 hours of electric light. Just a month later the first heads were  sold from the light house, but it was six weeks later when the first  heads were sold from the dark house. In other words, the electric  light plants were two weeks ahead of the others. This gain had been  purchased by 1613/4 hours of electric light, worth at current prices of  street lighting about $7.\"    This experiment was repeated with the same results. In the second  experiment the plants receiving eighty-four hours of electric light,  costing $3.50, were ready for market ten days before the plants in the  dark house. The influence of the light upon color of flowers was  variable. With tulips the colors of the lighted plants were deeper and  richer than the others, but they faded after four or five days.  Verbenas were injured in every case, being of shorter growth and  losing their flowers sooner than those in the dark house. \"Scarlet,  dark red, blue and pink flowers within three feet of the light soon  turned to a grayish white.\" Chinese primulas seven feet from the light  were unaffected, but those four feet away were changed. Lilac colors  were bleached to pure white when the light struck them fairly. An  elaborate series of tables of the effect of the light is given in the  paper. The author believes it possible that the electric light may be  used some day to pecuniary advantage in floricultural establishments.    These experiments naturally open up many questions. Those which will  be of most importance to the practical man will be such as relate to  the benefits to be derived from the use of the electric light. That  electricity has a great effect upon vegetation can no longer be  denied. What remains now is to ascertain how to use the force with the  most economy and to the best advantage. If by its use early vegetables  will be made earlier, bright flowers be made brighter, it will be a  question of only a short time before it will come into general use. To  the student of plant physiology there are also many questions of  interest, but into these it is not the intention to enter. Prof.  Bailey's general conclusions are, in part, as follows: \"There are a  few points which are clear: the electric light promotes assimilation,  it often hastens growth and maturity, it is capable of producing  natural flavors and colors in fruits, it often intensifies colors of  flowers and sometimes increases the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15207"],[0,"The New Physics and Its Evolution (#8)"],[1,"of a gaseous body, we obtain a scale very near  the absolute, which almost coincides with it when the gas possesses  certain qualities which make it nearly what is called a perfect gas.  This most lucky coincidence has decided the choice of the convention  adopted by physicists. They define normal temperature by means of the  variations of pressure in a mass of hydrogen beginning with the  initial pressure of a metre of mercury at 0 deg. C.    M.P. Chappuis, in some very precise experiments conducted with much  method, has proved that at ordinary temperatures the indications of  such a thermometer are so close to the degrees of the theoretical  scale that it is almost impossible to ascertain the value of the  divergences, or even the direction that they take. The divergence  becomes, however, manifest when we work with extreme temperatures. It  results from the useful researches of M. Daniel Berthelot that we must  subtract +0.18 deg. from the indications of the hydrogen thermometer  towards the temperature -240 deg. C, and add +0.05 deg. to 1000 deg.  to equate them with the thermodynamic scale. Of course, the difference  would also become still more noticeable on getting nearer to the  absolute zero; for as hydrogen gets more and more cooled, it gradually  exhibits in a lesser degree the characteristics of a perfect gas.    To study the lower regions which border on that kind of pole of cold  towards which are straining the efforts of the many physicists who  have of late years succeeded in getting a few degrees further forward,  we may turn to a gas still more difficult to liquefy than hydrogen.  Thus, thermometers have been made of helium; and from the temperature  of -260 deg. C. downward the divergence of such a thermometer from one of  hydrogen is very marked.    The measurement of very high temperatures is not open to the same  theoretical objections as that of very low temperatures; but, from a  practical point of view, it is as difficult to effect with an ordinary  gas thermometer. It becomes impossible to guarantee the reservoir  remaining sufficiently impermeable, and all security disappears,  notwithstanding the use of recipients very superior to those of former  times, such as those lately devised by the physicists of the  _Reichansalt_. This difficulty is obviated by using other methods,  such as the employment of thermo-electric couples, such as the very  convenient couple of M. le Chatelier; but the graduation of these  instruments can only be effected at the cost of a rather bold  extrapolation.    M.D. Berthelot has pointed out and experimented with a very  interesting process, founded on the measurement by the phenomena of  interference of the refractive index of a column of air subjected to  the temperature it is desired to measure. It appears admissible that  even at the highest temperatures the variation of the power of  refraction is strictly proportional to that of the density, for this  proportion is exactly verified so long as it is possible to check it  precisely. We can thus, by a method which offers the great advantage  of being independent of the power and dimension of the envelopes  employed--since the length of the column of air considered alone  enters into the calculation--obtain results equivalent to those given  by the ordinary air thermometer.    Another method, very old in principle, has also lately acquired great  importance. For a long time we sought to estimate the temperature of a  body by studying its radiation, but we did not know any positive  relation between this radiation and the temperature, and we had no  good experimental method of estimation, but had recourse to purely  empirical formulas and the use of apparatus of little precision. Now,  however, many physicists, continuing the classic researches of  Kirchhoff, Boltzmann, Professors Wien and Planck, and taking their  starting-point from the laws of thermodynamics, have given formulas  which establish the radiating power of a dark body as a function of  the temperature and the wave-length, or, better still, of the total  power as a function of the temperature and wave-length corresponding  to the maximum value of the power of radiation. We see, therefore, the  possibility of appealing for the measurement of temperature to a  phenomenon which is no longer the variation of the elastic force of a  gas, and yet is also connected with the principles of thermodynamics.    This is what Professors Lummer and Pringsheim have shown in a series  of studies which may certainly be reckoned among the greatest  experimental researches of the last few years. They have constructed a  radiator closely resembling the theoretically integral radiator which  a closed isothermal vessel would be, and with only a very small  opening, which allows us to collect from outside the radiations which  are in equilibrium with the interior. This vessel is formed of a  hollow carbon cylinder, heated by a current of high intensity; the  radiations are studied by means of a bolometer, the disposition of  which varies with the nature of the experiments.    It is hardly possible to enter into the details of the method, but the  result sufficiently indicates its importance. It is now possible,  thanks to their researches, to estimate a temperature of 2000 deg. C. to  within about 5 deg. Ten years ago a similar approximation could hardly  have been arrived at for a temperature of 1000 deg. C.      Sec. 6. DERIVED UNITS AND THE MEASURE OF A QUANTITY OF ENERGY    It must be understood that it is only by arbitrary convention that a  dependency is established between a derived unit and the fundamental  units. The laws of numbers in physics are often only laws of  proportion. We transform them into laws of equation, because we  introduce numerical coefficients and choose the units on which they  depend so as to simplify as much as possible the formulas most in use.  A particular speed, for instance, is in reality nothing else but a  speed, and it is only by the peculiar choice of unit that we can say  that it is the space covered during the unit of time. In the same way,  a quantity of electricity is a quantity of electricity; and there is  nothing to prove that, in its essence, it is really reducible to a  function of mass, of length, and of time.    Persons are still to be met with who seem to have some illusions on  this point, and who see in the doctrine of the dimensions of the units  a doctrine of general physics, while it is, to say truth, only a  doctrine of metrology. The knowledge of dimensions is valuable, since  it allows us, for instance, to easily verify the homogeneity of a  formula, but it can in no way give us any information on the actual  nature of the quantity measured.    Magnitudes to which we attribute like dimensions may be qualitatively  irreducible one to the other. Thus the different forms of energy are  measured by the same unit, and yet it seems that some of them, such as  kinetic energy, really depend on time; while for others, such as  potential energy, the dependency established by the system of  measurement seems somewhat fictitious.    The numerical value of a quantity of energy of any nature should, in  the system C.G.S., be expressed in terms of the unit called the erg;  but, as a matter of fact, when we wish to compare and measure  different quantities of energy of varying forms, such as electrical,  chemical, and other quantities, etc., we nearly always employ a method  by which all these energies are finally transformed and used to heat  the water of a calorimeter. It is therefore very important to study  well the calorific phenomenon chosen as the unit of heat, and to  determine with precision its mechanical equivalent, that is to say,  the number of ergs necessary to produce this unit. This is a number  which, on the principle of equivalence, depends neither on the method  employed, nor the time, nor any other external circumstance.    As the result of the brilliant researches of Rowland and of Mr  Griffiths on the variations of the specific heat of water, physicists  have decided to take as calorific standard the quantity of heat  necessary to raise a gramme of water from 15 deg. to 16 deg. C., the  temperature being measured by the scale of the hydrogen thermometer of  the International Bureau.    On the other hand, new determinations of the mechanical equivalent,  among which it is right to mention that of Mr. Ames, and a full  discussion as to the best results, have led to the adoption of the  number 4.187 to represent the number of ergs capable of producing the  unit of heat.    In practice, the measurement of a quantity of heat is very often  effected by means of the ice calorimeter, the use of which is  particularly simple and convenient. There is, therefore, a very  special interest in knowing exactly the melting-point of ice. M.  Leduc, who for several years has measured a great number of physical  constants with minute precautions and a remarkable sense of precision,  concludes, after a close discussion of the various results obtained,  that this heat is equal to 79.1 calories. An error of almost a calorie  had been committed by several renowned experimenters, and it will be  seen that in certain points the art of measurement may still be  largely perfected.    To the unit of energy might be immediately attached other units. For  instance, radiation being nothing but a flux of energy, we could, in  order to establish photometric units, divide the normal spectrum into  bands of a given width, and measure the power of each for the unit of  radiating surface.    But, notwithstanding some recent researches on this question, we  cannot yet consider the distribution of energy in the spectrum as  perfectly known. If we adopt the excellent habit which exists in some  researches of expressing radiating energy in ergs, it is still  customary to bring the radiations to a standard giving, by its"]]]
