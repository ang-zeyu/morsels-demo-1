Consciousness and will disappear  with the deadening or paralysis of these two organs.    [Sidenote: Secondary Brains]    Yet these two organs constitute but a small proportion of the entire  mass of brain and nervous tissue of the body. In addition to these,  there are not only the lower brain and the spinal cord and the countless  ramifications of motor and sensory nerves throughout the body, but  there are also separate nerve-centers or ganglia in every one of the  visceral organs of the body. These ganglia have the power to maintain  movements in their respective organs. _They may in fact be looked upon  as little brains developing nerve force and communicating it to the  organs._    [Sidenote: Dependence of the Subconscious]    All these automatic parts of the bodily mechanism are dominated by  departments of the mind entirely distinct from ordinary consciousness.  In fact, ordinary consciousness has no knowledge of their existence  excepting what is learned from outward bodily manifestations.    All these different organic ganglia constitute together the sympathetic  nerve system, organ of that part of the mind which directs the vital  operations of the body in apparent independence of the intelligence  commonly called \"the mind,\" an intelligence which acts through the  cerebro-spinal system.    Yet this independence is far from being absolute. For, as we have seen,  not only is the cerebro-spinal system, which is the organ of  consciousness, the abode of all the special senses, such as sight,  hearing, etc., and therefore our only source of information of the  external world, but many organs of the body are under the joint control  of both systems.    _So it comes about that these individual intelligences governing  different organs of the body, with their intercommunications, are  dependent upon consciousness for their knowledge of such facts of the  outer world as have a bearing on their individual operations, and they  are subject to the influence of consciousness as the medium that  interprets these facts._    It is unnecessary for us to go into this matter deeply. It is enough if  you clearly understand that, in addition to consciousness, the  department of mind that knows and directly deals with the facts of the  outer world, there is also a deep-seated and seemingly unconscious  department of mind consisting of individual organic intelligences  capable of receiving, understanding and acting upon such information as  consciousness transmits.    [Sidenote: Unconsciousness and Subconsciousness]    We have spoken of conscious and \"seemingly unconscious\" departments of  the mind. In doing so we have used the word \"seemingly\" advisedly.  Obviously we have no right to apply the term \"unconscious\" without  qualification to an intelligent mentality such as we have described.    \"Unconscious\" simply means \"not conscious.\" In its common acceptation,  it denotes, in fact, an absence of all mental action. It is in no sense  descriptive. It is merely negative. Death is unconscious; but  unconsciousness is no attribute of a mental state that is living and  impellent and constantly manifests its active energy and power in the  maintenance of the vital functions of the body.    Hereafter, then, we shall continue to use the term consciousness as  descriptive of that part of our mentality which constitutes what is  commonly known as the \"mind\"; while that mental force, which, so far as  our animal life is concerned, operates through the sympathetic nerve  system, we shall hereafter describe as \"_sub_conscious.\"    [Sidenote: Synthesis of the Man-Machine]    [Sidenote: Subserviency of the Body]    Let us summarize our study of man's physical organism. We have learned  that the human body is a confederation of various groups of living  cells; that in the earliest stages of man's evolution, these cells  were all of the same general type; that as such they were free-living,  free-thinking and intelligent organisms as certainly as were those  unicellular organisms which had not become members of any group or  association; that through the processes of evolution, heredity and  adaptation, there has come about in the course of the ages, a  subdivision of labor among the cells of our bodies and a consequent  differentiation in kind whereby each has become peculiarly fitted for  the performance of its allotted functions; that, nevertheless, these  cells of the human body are still free-living, intelligent organisms,  of which each is endowed with the inherited, instinctive knowledge of  all that is essential to the preservation of its own life and the  perpetuation of its species within the living body; that, as a part of  the specializing economy of the body, there have been evolved brain  and nerve cells performing a twofold service--first, constituting the  organ of a central governing intelligence with the important business  of receiving, classifying, and recording all impressions or messages  received through the senses from the outer world, and, second,  communicating to the other cells of the body such part of the  information so derived as may be appropriate to the functions of each;  that finally, as such complex and confederated individuals, each of  us possesses a direct, self-conscious knowledge of only a small part  of his entire mental equipment; that we have not only a  _consciousness_ receiving sense impressions and issuing motor impulses  through the cerebro-spinal nervous system, but that we have also a  _subconsciousness_ manifesting itself, so far as bodily functions are  concerned, in the activity of the vital organs through the sympathetic  nerve system; that this subconsciousness is dependent on consciousness  for all knowledge of the external world; that, in accordance with the  principles of evolution, man as a whole and as a collection of cell  organisms, both consciously and unconsciously, is seeking to adapt  himself to his external world, his environment; that the human body,  both as a whole and as an aggregate of cellular intelligences, is  therefore subject in every part and in every function to the  influence of the special senses and of the mind of consciousness.          The Supremacy of Consciousness          CHAPTER VI    THE SUPREMACY OF CONSCIOUSNESS    CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM STUDIES IN HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY, ANATOMY AND  PHYSIOLOGY      [Sidenote: Striking off the Mental Shackles]    Stop a moment and mark the conclusion to which you have come. You have  been examining the human body with the scalpel and the microscope of  the anatomist and physiologist. In doing so and by watching the bodily  organs in operation, you have learned that _every part of the body, even  to those organs commonly known as involuntary, is ultimately subject to  the influence or control of consciousness_, that part of the human  intelligence which is popularly known as \"the mind.\"    Prior to this, as a matter of direct introspective knowledge, we had  come to the conclusion that the influence of the mind over all the  organs of the body was one of the most obvious facts of human life.    So, our study of the body as the instrument of the mind has brought us  to the same conclusion as did our study of the mind in its relations to  the body.    Looked at from the practical science standpoint, the evidences that  mental activity can and does produce bodily effects are so clear and  numerous as to admit of no dispute.    The world has been slow to acknowledge the mastery of mind over body.  This is because the world long persisted in looking at the question from  the point of view of the philosopher and religionist. It is because the  thought of the world has been hampered by its own definitions of terms.    The spiritualist has been so busy in the pursuit of originating \"first\"  causes, and the materialist has so emphasized the dependence of mind  upon physical conditions, that the world has received with skepticism  the assertion of the influence of mind over body, and in fact doubted  the intuitive evidence of its own consciousness.    [Sidenote: The Awakening of Enlightenment]    The distinction between the two points of view has gradually come to be  recognized. Today the fact that the mind may act as a \"cause\" in  relationship with the body is a recognized principle of applied science.  The world's deepest thinkers accept its truth. And the interest of  enlightened men and women everywhere is directed toward the mind as an  agency of undreamed resource for the cure of functional derangements of  the body and for the attainment of the highest degree of bodily  efficiency.    In some respects it is unfortunate that you should have been compelled  to begin these studies in mental efficiency and self-expression with  lessons on the relationship between the mind and the body. There is the  danger that you may jump at the conclusion that this course has some  reference to \"mental healing.\" Please disabuse your mind of any such  mistaken idea.    [Sidenote: The Vital Purpose]    Health is a boon. It is not the greatest boon. Health is not life.  Health is but a means to life. Life is service. Life is achievement.  Health is of value in so far as it contributes to achievement.    Our study of the relation between mind and body at this time has had a  deeper, broader and more vital purpose. It is the foundation stone of an  educational structure in which we shall show you how the mind may be  brought by scientific measures to a certainty and effectiveness of  operation far greater than is now common or ordinarily thought possible.    [Sidenote: Your Reservoir of Latent Power]    Remember the two fundamental propositions set forth in this book.

OF this most eminent Christian scholar of the nineteenth century,  _The Tribune_ furnishes the following brief sketch. \"The name of  JOHANN AUGUST WILHELM NEANDER is familiar to a large number of our  countrymen, both on account of his important contributions to the  science of theology, and his personal intimacy with many of our  eminent scholars, who have enjoyed the benefit of his instructions,  or who have made his acquaintance while pursuing their travels in  Germany. Although he had attained a greater age than might have been  anticipated from his habits as a confirmed invalid, being in his  sixty-second year, his decease cannot be announced without causing an  emotion of surprise and regret to a numerous circle who recognized in  him one of the most faithful and conscientious Christian teachers of  the present day.    \"NEANDER, as it is well known, was descended from Jewish parents,  by whom he was instructed in the rudiments of religion, and at a  subsequent period of life became a convert to the Christian faith, by  personal inquiry and experience. He was born at Goettingen, in 1789,  but passed a considerable portion of his youth at Hamburg, where he  was initiated into the rudiments of a classical education. After he  had made a profession of Christianity, he continued his studies for  a short time at the Universities of Halle and Goettingen, returned to  Hamburg, and finally completed his University career at Heidelberg.  The following year he was called to the University of Berlin, as  Professor of Theology, where he soon gave promise of the brilliant  eminence which he has since attained. His first publications were  on special topics of ecclesiastical history, including treatises on  'The Emperor Julian and his Age,' 'St. Bernard and his Age,' 'The  Development of the Principal Systems of the Gnostics,' 'St. Chrysostom  and the Church in his Age,' and 'The Spirit of Tertullian,' with  an 'Introduction to his Writings.' These treatises are remarkable  monuments of diligence, accuracy, profoundness of research and breadth  of comprehension, showing the same intellectual qualities which  were afterward signally exhibited in the composition of his masterly  volumes on the history of the Christian Religion. His earliest  production in this department had for its object to present the most  important facts in Church history, in a form adapted to the great mass  of readers, without aiming at scientific precision or completeness.  This attempt was eminently successful. The first volume of his  great work entitled 'General History of the Church and the Christian  Religion,' was published in 1825, and it was not till twenty years  afterward that the work was brought to a close. The appearance of this  work formed a new epoch in ecclesiastical history. It at once betrayed  the power of a bold and original mind. Instead of consisting of a  meager and arid collection of facts, without scientific order, without  any vital coherence or symmetry, and without reference to the cardinal  elements of Christian experience, the whole work, though singularly  chaste and subdued in its tone, throbs with the emotions of genuine  life, depicting the influence of Christianity as a school for the  soul, and showing its radiant signatures of Divinity in its moral  triumphs through centuries.    \"His smaller work on the first development of Christianity in the  Apostolic Age is marked by the same spirited characteristics, while  his 'Life of Jesus' is an able defense of the historical verity of  the sacred narrative against the ingenious and subtle suggestions of  Strauss.    \"The writings and theological position of NEANDER have been fully  brought before the American public by Profs. ROBINSON, TORREY,  McCLINTOCK, SEARS, and other celebrated scholars who have done much to  diffuse a knowledge of the learned labors of Germany among intelligent  thinkers in our own country. NEANDER was free from the reproach which  attaches to so many of his fellow laborers, of covertly undermining  the foundation of Christianity, under the pretense of placing it on a  philosophical basis. His opinions are considered strictly evangelical,  though doubtless embodied in a modified form. In regard to the extent  and soundness of his learning, the clearness of his perceptions,  and the purity and nobleness of his character, there can be but one  feeling among those who are qualified to pronounce a judgment on the  subject.    \"NEANDER was never married. He was the victim of almost constant ill  health. In many of his personal habits he was peculiar and eccentric.  With the wisdom of a sage, he combined the simplicity of a child. Many  amusing anecdotes are related of his oddities in the lecture-room,  which will serve to enliven the biography that will doubtless be  prepared at an early date. We have received no particulars concerning  his death, which is said to have been announced by private letters to  friends in Boston.\"           *       *       *       *       *    JACOB JONES, U.S.N.    COMMODORE JACOB JONES, of the United States Navy, died in Philadelphia  on the 6th inst. He was born in Smyrna, Kent county, Delaware, in  the year 1770, and was therefore, eighty years of age. He was of  an eminently respectable family, and commenced life as a physician,  having studied the profession at the University of Pennsylvania. He  afterward became clerk of the Supreme Court of Delaware for his native  county. When about twenty-nine years old he entered the navy, and made  his first cruises under Commodore Barry. He was a midshipman on board  the frigate United States, when she bore to France Chief Justice  Ellsworth and General Davie, as envoys extraordinary to the French  Republic. He was next appointed to the Ganges as midshipman. On the  breaking out of the war with Tripoli, he was stationed on the frigate  Philadelphia, under Commodore Bainbridge. The disaster which befell  that ship and her crew before Tripoli, forms a solemn page in our  naval history; atoned, however, by the brilliant achievements to which  it gave rise. Twenty months of severe captivity among a barbarous  people, and in a noxious climate, neither broke the spirit nor  impaired the constitution of Jones. Blest by nature with vigorous  health and an invincible resolution, when relieved from bondage by the  bravery of his countrymen, he returned home full of life and ardor.  He was soon after promoted to a lieutenancy. He was now for some time  employed on the Orleans station, where he conducted himself with  his usual judgment and propriety, and was a favorite in the polite  circles of the Orleans and Mississippi territories. He was shortly  after appointed to the command of the brig Argus, stationed for the  protection of our commerce on the southern maritime frontier. In this  situation he acted with vigilance and fidelity, and though there were  at one time insidious suggestions to the contrary, it has appeared  that he conformed to his instructions, promoted the public interest,  and gave entire satisfaction to the government. In 1811, he was  transferred to the command of the sloop-of-war Wasp, mounting eighteen  twenty-four pound carronades, and dispatched, in the spring of 1812,  with communications to the courts of St. Cloud and St. James. Before  he returned, war had been declared against Great Britain. He refitted  his ship with all possible dispatch, and repaired to sea, but met with  no other good fortune than the capture of an inconsiderable prize. He  next sailed from Philadelphia on the 13th of October, and on the 18th  of the same month encountered a heavy gale, during which the Wasp  lost her jibboom and two seamen. On the following night, the watch  discovered five strange sail steering eastward. The Wasp hauled to  the windward and closely watched their movements until daylight next  morning, when it was found that they were six large merchant vessels  under convoy of a sloop of war. The former were well manned, two  of them mounting sixteen guns each. Notwithstanding the apparent"]]]
