It is  naughty to do this, it is naughty to do that. There is no gradation in  the condemnation, and the child loses all sense of the meaning of the  word. He himself proclaims himself naughty almost with satisfaction:  his doll is naughty, the dog is naughty, his nurse and mother are  naughty, and so forth. In reality the little child is peculiarly  sensitive to blame, if he is not reproof-hardened. It is hardly  necessary to use words of blame at all. If he is asked kindly and  quietly to desist, much as we would address a grown-up person, and  does not, he can be made to feel that his conduct is unpopular by  keeping aloof from him a little, by disregarding him for the time  being, and by indicating to him that he is a troublesome little person  with whom we cannot be bothered.    Any one who has had much to do with children will realise that, if  wrongly handled, they are apt to take a positive delight in doing what  they conceive to be wrong. There is clearly a delightful element of  excitement in the process of being naughty, of daring and of braving  the wrath to come, with which they are so familiar and for which they  care nothing at all. But the perverseness of which we are now speaking  has a different origin. It arises only when children are reproved,  appealed to, and expostulated with too often and too constantly.  Negativism is a symptom which is common enough in certain mental  disorders. The unhappy patient always does the opposite of what is  desired or expected of him. If he be asked to stand up he will  endeavour to remain seated, or if asked to sit he will attempt to rise  to his feet. Like many other symptoms of nervous disturbance which we  shall study later, this negativistic spirit is often displayed to  perfection by little children when the environment is at fault and  when grown-up people have too freely exercised authority. A mother,  anxious to induce her little son to come to the doctor, and knowing  well that her call to him to enter the room, as he stands hesitating  at the door, will at once determine his retreat to the nursery, has  been heard to say, \"Run away, darling, we don't want _you_ here,\" with  the expected result that the docile child immediately comes forward.  To the doctor, that such a device should be practised almost as a  matter of course and that its success should be so confidently  anticipated, should give food for thought. It may shed light on much  that is to follow later in the interview.    The question of punishment, like that of reproof, is beset with  difficulty. There are fortunately nowadays few educated mothers who  are so foolish as to threaten punishment which they obviously do not  intend to administer and which the child knows they will not  administer. It is clear that punishment must be rare or else the child  will grow habituated to it, and with little children we cannot be  brutal or push punishment to the point of extreme physical pain. It is  more difficult to say, as one is tempted to say, that all punishment  is futile and should be discarded. Probably mothers are like  schoolmasters in that no two schoolmasters and no two mothers obtain  their effects in exactly the same way or by precisely the same means.  Nor do all children accept reproof or submit to punishment in the same  way. Some make light of it and take a pleasure in defying authority.  Others are unduly cast down by the slightest adverse criticism. It is  generally true that extreme sensitiveness to reproof is a sign of a  certain elevation of character. Always we must remember that for a  mother to inflict punishment, whether by causing physical pain or  mental suffering, is to take on her shoulders a certain  responsibility. It is a serious matter if she has misapprehended the  child's act--if the sin was not really a sin, but only some perverted  action, the intention of which was not sinful, but designed for good  in the faulty reasoning of the child. A little girl, in bed with a  feverish cold, was found shivering, with her night-dress wet and  muddy. It was an understanding mother who found that her little  brother, having heard somehow that ice was good for fevered heads, had  brought in several handfuls of snow from the garden, not of the  cleanest, and had offered them to aid his sister's recovery. It need  hardly be said that punishment should always be deliberate. The hasty  slap is nothing else than the motor discharge provoked by the  irritability of the educator, and the child, who is a good observer on  such points, discerns the truth and measures the frailty of his judge.    The frequent repetition of words of reproof and acts of punishment has  a further disadvantage that the older children are quick to practise  both upon their younger brothers and sisters. There is something wrong  in the nursery where the lives of the little ones are made a burden to  them by the constant repression of the older children. But although  set and artificial punishments are as a general rule to be used but  sparingly, the mother can see to it that the child learns by  experience that a foolish or careless act brings its own punishment.  If, for example, a child breaks his toy, or destroys its mechanism,  she need not be so quick in mending it that he does not learn the  obvious lesson. If the baby throws his doll from the perambulator, in  sheer joy at the experience of imparting motion to it, she need not  prevent him from learning the lesson that this involves also some  temporary separation from it. Throughout all his life he is to learn  that he cannot eat his cake and have it too. The use of rewards is  also beset with difficulties. Their coming must be unexpected and  occasional. They must never degenerate into bribes, to be bargained  for upon condition of good behaviour. Rewards which take the form of  special privileges are best.    The aesthetic sense of children develops very early. From the very  beginning of the second year they take delight in new clothes, and in  personal adornment of all sorts. They show evident pleasure if the  nursery acquires a new picture or a new wall-paper. They have  pronounced favourites in colours. Even tiny children show dislike of  dirt and all unpleasant things. Personal cleanliness should be clearly  desired by all children. A sense of what is pleasant and what is  unpleasant should be encouraged. Any delay in its appearance is apt to  imply a backwardness in development of mind or of body. Only children  who are tired out by physical illness or by nervous exhaustion will  lie without protest in a dirty condition.    Affection and the attempt to express affection appear clearly marked  even in the first year. Too much kissing and too much being kissed is  apt to spoil the spontaneity of the child's caresses. We must not,  however, expect to find any trace in the young child of such a complex  quality as unselfishness or self-abnegation. The child's conception of  his own self has but just emerged. It is his single impulse to develop  his own experience and his own powers, and his attitude for many  years is summed up in the phrase: \"Me do it.\" We must not expect him  to resign his toys to the little visitor, or the little visitor to  cease from his efforts to obtain them. In all our dealings with  children we must know what we may legitimately expect from them, and  judge them by their own standards, not by those of adult life. We  cannot expect self-sacrifice in a child, and, after all, when we come  to think of it, obedience is but another name for self-sacrifice. If  the tiny child could possibly obey all the behests that are heaped  upon him in the course of a day by many a nurse and mother, he would  truly be living a life of complete self-abnegation. Surely it is  because the virtue of obedience, the virtue that is proclaimed  proverbially the child's own, is so impossible of attainment that it  is become the subject of so much emphasis. As Madame Montessori has  put it: \"We ask for obedience and the child in turn asks for the  moon.\" Only when we have developed the child's reasoning powers, by  treating him as a rational being, can we expect him deliberately to  defer his wishes to ours, because he has learned that our requests are  generally reasonable.          CHAPTER III    WANT OF APPETITE AND INDIGESTION      The mind of the child is so unstable and yet so highly developed, that  symptoms of nervous disturbance are more frequent and of greater  intensity than in later life. Only rarely and in exceptional cases do  certain symptoms, common in childhood, persist into adult life or  appear there for the first time, and then usually in persons who, if  they are not actually insane, are at least suffering from intense  nervous strain. We have already mentioned the symptom of negativism  and noted its occasional occurrence as an accompaniment of mental  disorder in adult life, and its frequency among children who are  irritable or irritated. Similarly, we may cite the digestive neuroses  of adult life to explain the common refusal of food and the common  nervous vomiting of the second year of life. Thus, for example, there  exists in adult life a disturbance of the nervous system which is  called \"anorexia nervosa.\" A boy of nineteen was brought to the  Out-patient Department of Guy's Hospital suffering from this  complaint. He was little more than a skeleton, unable to stand, hardly  able to sit, and weighing only four and a half stones. His mother,  who came with him, stated that he had always been nervous, and that  lately, after receiving a call to join the army as a recruit, his  appetite, which had for some time been capricious, had completely  disappeared. In spite of coaxing he resolutely refused all food, or  took it only in the tiniest morsels, although at the same time it was  thought that he sometimes took food \"on the sly.\" A careful"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1452"],[0,"Native Life in South Africa (#8)"],[1,"rovinces.\"    In the Free State, proceeded Mr. Merriman, the people had most excellent laws  from their point of view for keeping out the Natives --  stringent, Draconian, and violent laws, but they were not carried out,  and the Natives had flooded the country.  All they wanted to do  was to turn the Native from a tenant to a labour tenant, and then salvation  would be at hand.  He could not see very much difference between the two,  except that one was a contented advancing man and the other a discontented man  approaching very closely to the Russian serf -- he was a soul.  Shortly we should hear of a farm being up for sale with so many souls.    In the Transvaal the problem had been complicated by  the decisions of the Court and the curious way in which some ground  had been given out in the Zoutpansberg district, where, he was told,  farms had been given out on which the Natives had been living for years,  and these farms -- with the Natives on them -- had come into  the possession of companies and individuals, and now it was proposed  to turn the Natives off.  That would not be an agreeable thing,  but he would not offer an opinion now as to the justice of it.    He would like to revert to the state of things which had grown up  under the Draconian laws of the Free State.  According to  a very interesting Blue-book containing reports of magistrates,  one magistrate had reported that \"the pernicious system of squatting  was detrimental to the working farmer, the Native reaping  the whole of the benefit.\"  The man who worked generally reaped  the whole benefit in the long run.  In the Harrismith district  there were some 40,000 Natives against some 8,000 Europeans.  How did they get there?  Having been a Free State burgher  he knew that the Natives had not forced their way in.  These Natives ploughed on the half-shares, and he would like to know  whether they were labour tenants or squatters.  If they were squatters  it would require very little dexterous management to convert them  into labour tenants.  The Magistrate of Hoopstad, went on Mr. Merriman,  had referred to the pernicious system of native squatters.  But why did not the Free State magistrates do something and put the law  in force?  That was the principal reason why the House was forced  to pass that Bill without information, and without giving  any opportunity to people who had the deepest interest in this matter  to have their views heard, or to let them know what the House was going to do  because the magistrates in the Free State would not enforce the law.  He did think that was rather hard.  In conclusion Mr. Merriman said:  I dare say I may have said a great many things which may be distasteful  to my hon. friends, but I do claim their attention because at a time  when they were not in such a dominant position as they are now,  I pleaded for right and justice for them.  Therefore, they should not  take it amiss from me, because now they are in a dominant position,  I plead also for justice, toleration, moderation, and delay in this matter.    MR. H. MENTZ (Zoutpansberg) said the right hon. gentleman  had earned their gratitude for the high tone in which he had carried  the debate.  The speech which he had delivered was a most instructive one,  and although the speaker was not in entire agreement with him on all points,  he was in agreement on the point that the matter was one to be handled  with prudence, but it was to be regretted that under the Bill  a Commission was to be appointed.  The Minister should not listen  to the request for a postponement of the question, by referring it  to a Select Committee.  If they were to refer the Bill to a Select Committee,  it would never be passed this year.    MR. G. L. STEYTLER (Rouxville) expressed his thanks to the Government  for bringing forward the Bill.  He said he felt that it was not  a complete solution of the whole question, but it was certainly  a step in the right direction.    MR. A. FAWCUS (Umlazi) said that as the representative of 70,000 Natives  in Natal, not one of whom so far as he knew had a vote, he should like,  on their behalf, to thank the right hon. member for Victoria West  for the manner in which he had handled this question.  In the course of his speech the right hon. gentleman asked,  what did the Natives think about this Bill before the House?  His (Mr. Fawcus') opinion was that the Natives did not think anything at all  about it.  He should not think there was one Native in a thousand  in South Africa who was aware that this matter, so vitally affecting  their future, was at present at issue.  The hon. member for Middelburg  had referred to the Natives as \"schepsels\".*  He believed  the day was rapidly passing away when we should refer to Natives  as \"schepsels\".  They were an easy-going folk, and they thought little  about title deeds and land laws.  So great was the Native's attachment  to the land on which he lived, in many instances, that they could not  rackrent him off it.  These were the people that the Bill wished  to dispossess and drive off the land.  The figures placed before them  showed that THE LAND HELD BY EUROPEANS PER HEAD WAS FIFTY TIMES THE AMOUNT  HELD PER HEAD BY THE NATIVES.  Surely there was no need at the present time  for legislation which would prevent Natives getting a little more land  than they now had.  He did not think it could be put down  to the fault of the Native if he was willing to buy and live on land  rather than pay rent.  The figures given in this connexion  were very instructive.  EIGHT ACRES PER HEAD WERE HELD BY THE NATIVES  IN THE CAPE, SIX ACRES IN NATAL, ABOUT 1 1/2 ACRES in the Transvaal,  and about one-third of an acre in the Free State.  He thought this Bill  was perhaps coming on a little before there was any necessity for it.    --  * Creatures.  --    MR. C. G. FICHARDT (Ladybrand) said he felt very much  that the Bill that was before the House did not carry out  all that should be carried out, and that was equality of justice.  IF THEY WERE TO DEAL FAIRLY WITH THE NATIVES OF THIS COUNTRY,  THEN ACCORDING TO POPULATION THEY SHOULD GIVE THEM FOUR-FIFTHS OF THE COUNTRY,  OR AT LEAST A HALF.  How were they going to do that?  As he said  in the earlier part of his remarks, he was prepared to accept the Bill  as something to go on with, but he hoped that in the future  it would not constitute a stumbling-block.  He would much rather have seen  that the matter had been gone into more fully, and that some scheme  had been laid before them so that they might have more readily been able  to judge how the Bill would work.  It was because of all these difficulties  that he felt that they could only accept the Bill if it laid down  that there was no intention of taking the country from the white people  and handing it over to the blacks.    MR. J. G. KEYTER (Ficksburg) said he wished to openly denounce, and most  emphatically so, that the people or the Government of the Orange Free State  had treated the coloured people unreasonably or unjustly,  or in any way oppressively.  On the contrary, the O.F.S. had always treated  the coloured people with the greatest consideration and the utmost justice.  The O.F.S. had made what Mr. Merriman called stringent laws.  He (Mr. Keyter) called them just laws.  They TOLD THE COLOURED PEOPLE PLAINLY  THAT THE O.F.S. WAS A WHITE MAN'S COUNTRY, AND THAT THEY INTENDED  TO KEEP IT SO.  (Hear, hear.)  THEY TOLD THE COLOURED PEOPLE  THAT THEY WERE NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO BUY OR HIRE LAND,  and that they were not going to tolerate an equality of whites and blacks;  and he said that they were not going to tolerate that in the future,  and if an attempt were made to force that on them, they would resist it  at any cost to the last,* for if they did tolerate it,  they would very soon find that they would be a bastard nation.  His experience was that the Native should be treated firmly,  kept in his place and treated honestly.  They should not give him  a gun one day and fight him for it the next day.  They should tell him,  as the Free State told him, that IT WAS A WHITE MAN'S COUNTRY,  THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO BUY LAND THERE OR TO HIRE LAND THERE,  AND THAT IF HE WANTED TO BE THERE HE MUST BE IN SERVICE.    --  * By passing the Bill, the Government conceded all the extravagant demands    of the \"Free\" Staters; yet, a year later they took up arms    against the Government.  --    MR. J. A. P. VAN DER MERWE (Vredefort) deprecated sending the Bill  to a Select Committee, arguing that the House itself should decide it.  He referred to the difficulties experienced by farmers in the Free State.  If a farmer refused to allow a Native to farm on the share system  he simply refused to work.  There were thousands of Natives on the farms there  who hired ground and did little work.  The farmers had to keep their children  at home to do the work.  Some of the Natives hired ground, did some sowing,  then went to work in Johannesburg, and paid the owner of the farm  half what he reaped from the harvest.  That was not satisfactory.  He was pleased to see the provisions the Minister proposed to make  in this regard, and expressed the hope that the Native  would only be tolerated among the whites as a labourer.  The Bill would meet  what he considered a great want, and, as it was an urgent matter,  he hoped the proposal for a Select Committee would not be agreed to.          Third Reading Debate.    SIR LIONEL PHILLIPS (Yeoville):  But why should a Bill of this sort  be brought before them now?  The Government in the past had not been bashful  in the appointing of Commissions, and one question he would ask was why,  in this important matter, the Government had not appointed a Commission  to take all the evidence and then come to the House with a measure which  the House would have to approve of.  Instead of that, they were cancelling  the rights the Natives had in South Africa, and creating a very"]]]
