Is it not the chief disgrace in the  world, not to be an unit; not to be reckoned one character; not to  yield that peculiar fruit which each man was created to bear, but to  be reckoned in the gross, in the hundred, or the thousand, of the  party, the section, to which we belong; and our opinion predicted  geographically, as the north, or the south? Not so, brothers and  friends,--please God, ours shall not be so. We will walk on our own  feet; we will work with our own hands; we will speak our own minds.  Then shall man be no longer a name for pity, for doubt, and for  sensual indulgence. The dread of man and the love of man shall be a  wall of defense and a wreath of joy around all. A nation of men will  for the first time exist, because each believes himself inspired by  the Divine Soul which also inspires all men.          COMPENSATION.[93]        The wings of Time are black and white,      Pied with morning and with night.      Mountain tall and ocean deep      Trembling balance duly keep.      In changing moon, in tidal wave,      Glows the feud of Want and Have.      Gauge of more and less through space      Electric star and pencil plays.      The lonely Earth amid the balls      That hurry through the eternal halls,      A makeweight flying to the void,      Supplemental asteroid,      Or compensatory spark,      Shoots across the neutral Dark.        Man's the elm, and Wealth the vine,      Stanch and strong the tendrils twine;      Through the frail ringlets thee deceive,      None from its stock that vine can reave.      Fear not, then, thou child infirm,      There's no god dare wrong a worm.      Laurel crowns cleave to deserts,      And power to him who power exerts;      Hast not thy share? On winged feet,      Lo! it rushes thee to meet;      And all that Nature made thy own,      Floating in air or pent in stone,      Will rive the hills and swim the sea,      And, like thy shadow, follow thee.      Ever since I was a boy, I have wished to write a discourse on  Compensation: for it seemed to me when very young, that on this  subject life was ahead of theology, and the people knew more than the  preachers taught. The documents,[94] too, from which the doctrine is  to be drawn, charmed my fancy by their endless variety, and lay always  before me, even in sleep; for they are the tools in our hands, the  bread in our basket, the transactions of the street, the farm, and the  dwelling-house, greetings, relations, debts and credits, the influence  of character, the nature and endowment of all men. It seemed to me,  also, that in it might be shown men a ray of divinity, the present  action of the soul of this world, clean from all vestige of tradition,  and so the heart of man might be bathed by an inundation of eternal  love, conversing with that which he knows was always and always must  be, because it really is now. It appeared, moreover, that if this  doctrine could be stated in terms with any resemblance to those bright  intuitions in which this truth is sometimes revealed to us, it would  be a star in many dark hours and crooked passages in our journey that  would not suffer us to lose our way.    I was lately confirmed in these desires by hearing a sermon at church.  The preacher, a man esteemed for his orthodoxy, unfolded in the  ordinary manner the doctrine of the Last Judgment. He assumed that  judgment is not executed in this world; that the wicked are  successful; that the good are miserable;[95] and then urged from  reason and from Scripture a compensation to be made to both parties in  the next life. No offense appeared to be taken by the congregation at  this doctrine. As far as I could observe, when the meeting broke up,  they separated without remark on the sermon.    Yet what was the import of this teaching? What did the preacher mean  by saying that the good are miserable in the present life? Was it that  houses and lands, offices, wine, horses, dress, luxury, are had by  unprincipled men, whilst the saints are poor and despised; and that a  compensation is to be made to these last hereafter, by giving them the  like gratifications another day,--bank stock and doubloons,[96]  venison and champagne? This must be the compensation intended; for  what else? Is it that they are to have leave to pray and praise? to  love and serve men? Why, that they can do now. The legitimate  inference the disciple would draw was: \"We are to have _such_ a good  time as the sinners have now\"; or, to push it to its extreme import:  \"You sin now; we shall sin by and by; we would sin now, if we could;  not being successful, we expect our revenue to-morrow.\"    The fallacy lay in the immense concession that the bad are successful;  that justice is not done now. The blindness of the preacher consisted  in deferring to the base estimate of the market of what constitutes a  manly success, instead of confronting and convicting the world from  the truth; announcing the presence of the soul; the omnipotence of the  will: and so establishing the standard of good and ill, of success and  falsehood.    I find a similar base tone in the popular religious works of the day,  and the same doctrines assumed by the literary men when occasionally  they treat the related topics. I think that our popular theology has  gained in decorum, and not in principle, over the superstitions it has  displaced. But men are better than this theology. Their daily life  gives it the lie. Every ingenuous and aspiring soul leaves the  doctrine behind him in his own experience; and all men feel sometimes  the falsehood which they cannot demonstrate. Few men are wiser than  they know. That which they hear in schools and pulpits without  afterthought, if said in conversation, would probably be questioned in  silence. If a man dogmatize in a mixed company on Providence and the  divine laws, he is answered by a silence which conveys well enough to  an observer the dissatisfaction of the hearer, but his incapacity to  make his own statement.    I shall attempt in this and the following chapter to record some facts  that indicate the path of the law of Compensation; happy beyond my  expectation, if I shall truly draw the smallest arc of this circle.    POLARITY,[97] or action and reaction, we meet in every part of nature;  in darkness and light; in heat and cold; in the ebb and flow of waters;  in male and female; in the inspiration and expiration of plants and  animals; in the equation of quantity and quality in the fluids of the  animal body; in the systole and diastole[98] of the heart; in the  undulations of fluids, and of sound; in the centrifugal and centripetal  gravity; in electricity, galvanism, and chemical affinity. Superinduce  magnetism at one end of a needle; the opposite magnetism takes place at  the other end. If the south attracts, the north repels. To empty here,  you must condense there. An inevitable dualism bisects nature, so that  each thing is a half, and suggests another thing to make it whole; as,  spirit, matter; man, woman; odd, even; subjective, objective; in, out;  upper, under; motion, rest; yea, nay.    Whilst the world is thus dual, so is every one of its parts. The  entire system of things gets represented in every particle. There is  somewhat that resembles the ebb and flow of the sea, day and night,  man and woman, in a single needle of the pine, in a kernel of corn, in  each individual of every animal tribe. The reaction, so grand in the  elements, is repeated within these small boundaries. For example, in  the animal kingdom the physiologist has observed that no creatures  are favorites, but a certain compensation balances every gift and  every defect. A surplusage given to one part is paid out of a  reduction from another part of the same creature. If the head and neck  are enlarged, the trunk and extremities are cut short.    The theory of the mechanic forces is another example. What we gain in  power is lost in time; and the converse. The periodic or compensating  errors of the planets is another instance. The influences of climate  and soil in political history is another. The cold climate  invigorates. The barren soil does not breed fevers, crocodiles,  tigers, or scorpions.    The same dualism underlies the nature and condition of man. Every  excess causes a defect; every defect an excess. Every sweet hath its  sour; every evil its good. Every faculty which is a receiver of  pleasure has an equal penalty put on its abuse. It is to answer for  its moderation with its life. For every grain of wit there is a grain  of folly. For everything you have missed, you have gained something  else; and for everything you gain, you lose something. If riches  increase, they are increased[99] that use them. If the gatherer  gathers too much, nature takes out of the man what she puts into his  chest, swells the estate, but kills the owner. Nature hates monopolies  and exceptions. The waves of the sea do not more speedily seek a level  from their loftiest tossing, than the varieties of condition tend to  equalize themselves. There is always some leveling circumstance that  puts down the overbearing, the strong, the rich, the fortunate,  substantially on the same ground with all others. Is a man too strong  and fierce for society, and by temper and position a bad citizen,--a  morose ruffian, with a dash of the pirate in him;--nature sends him a  troop of pretty sons and daughters, who are getting along in the  dame's classes at the village school, and love and fear for them  smooths his grim scowl to courtesy. Thus she contrives to  intenerate[100] the granite and felspar, takes the boar out and puts  the lamb in, and keeps her balance true.    The farmer imagines power and place are fine things. But the President  has paid dear for his White House.[101] It has commonly cost him all  his peace, and the best of his many attributes. To preserve for a  short time so conspicuous an appearance before the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16653"],[0,"Myths of Babylonia and Assyria (#8)"],[1,"bricks; we know that they invented the art of spinning, for  spindle-whorls are found even in the Gezer caves to which we have  referred, while in Egypt the pre-Dynastic dead were sometimes wrapped  in finely woven linen: their deftly chipped flint implements are  eloquent of artistic and mechanical skill, and undoubted mathematical  ability must be credited to the makers of smoothly polished stone  hammers which are so perfectly balanced that they revolve on a centre  of gravity. In Egypt and Babylonia the soil was tilled and its  fertility increased by irrigation. Wherever man waged a struggle with  Nature he made rapid progress, and consequently we find that the  earliest great civilizations were rooted in the little fields of the  Neolithic farmers. Their mode of life necessitated a knowledge of  Nature's laws; they had to take note of the seasons and measure time.  So Egypt gave us the Calendar, and Babylonia the system of dividing  the week into seven days, and the day into twelve double hours.    The agricultural life permitted large communities to live in river  valleys, and these had to be governed by codes of laws; settled  communities required peace and order for their progress and  prosperity. All great civilizations have evolved from the habits and  experiences of settled communities. Law and religion were closely  associated, and the evidence afforded by the remains of stone circles  and temples suggests that in the organization and division of labour  the influence of religious teachers was pre-eminent. Early rulers,  indeed, were priest-kings--incarnations of the deity who owned the  land and measured out the span of human life.    We need not assume that Neolithic man led an idyllic existence; his  triumphs were achieved by slow and gradual steps; his legal codes  were, no doubt, written in blood and his institutions welded in the  fires of adversity. But, disciplined by laws, which fostered  humanitarian ideals, Neolithic man, especially of the Mediterranean  race, had reached a comparatively high state of civilization long ages  before the earliest traces of his activities can be obtained. When  this type of mankind is portrayed in Ancient Sumeria, Ancient Egypt,  and Ancient Crete we find that the faces are refined and intellectual  and often quite modern in aspect. The skulls show that in the Late  Stone Age the human brain was fully developed and that the racial  types were fixed. In every country in Europe we still find the direct  descendants of the ancient Mediterranean race, as well as the  descendants of the less highly cultured conquerors who swept westward  out of Asia at the dawn of the Bronze Age; and everywhere there are  evidences of crossment of types in varying degrees. Even the influence  of Neolithic intellectual life still remains. The comparative study of  mythology and folk beliefs reveals that we have inherited certain  modes of thought from our remote ancestors, who were the congeners of  the Ancient Sumerians and the Ancient Egyptians. In this connection it  is of interest, therefore, to refer to the social ideals of the early  peoples who met and mingled on the southern plains of the Tigris and  Euphrates, and especially the position occupied by women, which is  engaging so much attention at the present day.    It would appear that among the Semites and other nomadic peoples woman  was regarded as the helpmate rather than the companion and equal of  man. The birth of a son was hailed with joy; it was \"miserable to have  a daughter\", as a Hindu sage reflected; in various countries it was  the custom to expose female children after birth and leave them to  die. A wife had no rights other than those accorded to her by her  husband, who exercised over her the power of life and death. Sons  inherited family possessions; the daughters had no share allotted to  them, and could be sold by fathers and brothers. Among the peoples who  observed \"male right\", social life was reflected in the conception of  controlling male deities, accompanied by shadowy goddesses who were  often little else than figures of speech.    The Ancient Sumerians, on the other hand, like the Mediterranean  peoples of Egypt and Crete, reverenced and exalted motherhood in  social and religious life. Women were accorded a legal status and  marriage laws were promulgated by the State. Wives could possess  private property in their own right, as did the Babylonian Sarah, wife  of Abraham, who owned the Egyptian slave Hagar.[26] A woman received  from her parents a marriage dowry, and in the event of separation from  her husband she could claim its full value. Some spinsters, or wives,  were accustomed to enter into business partnerships with men or  members of their own sex, and could sue and be sued in courts of law.  Brothers and sisters were joint heirs of the family estate. Daughters  might possess property over which their fathers exercised no control:  they could also enter into legal agreements with their parents in  business matters, when they had attained to years of discretion. Young  women who took vows of celibacy and lived in religious institutions  could yet make business investments, as surviving records show. There  is only one instance of a Sumerian woman ascending the throne, like  Queen Hatshepsut of Egypt. Women, therefore, were not rigidly excluded  from official life. Dungi II, an early Sumerian king, appointed two of  his daughters as rulers of conquered cities in Syria and Elam.  Similarly Shishak, the Egyptian Pharaoh, handed over the city of  Gezer, which he had subdued, to his daughter, Solomon's wife.[27] In  the religious life of ancient Sumeria the female population exercised  an undoubted influence, and in certain temples there were priestesses.  The oldest hymns give indication of the respect shown to women by  making reference to mixed assemblies as \"females and males\", just as  present-day orators address themselves to \"ladies and gentlemen\". In  the later Semitic adaptations of these productions, it is significant  to note, this conventional reference was altered to \"male and female\".  If influences, however, were at work to restrict the position of women  they did not meet with much success, because when Hammurabi codified  existing laws, the ancient rights of women received marked  recognition.    There were two dialects in ancient Sumeria, and the invocatory hymns  were composed in what was known as \"the women's language\". It must not  be inferred, however, that the ladies of Sumeria had established a  speech which differed from that used by men. The reference would  appear to be to a softer and homelier dialect, perhaps the oldest of  the two, in which poetic emotion found fullest and most beautiful  expression. In these ancient days, as in our own, the ideal of  womanhood was the poet's chief source of inspiration, and among the  hymns the highest reach of poetic art was attained in the invocation  of Ishtar, the Babylonian Venus. The following hymn is addressed to  that deity in her Valkyrie-like character as a goddess of war, but her  more feminine traits are not obscured:--        HYMN TO ISHTAR        To thee I cry, O lady of the gods,      Lady of ladies, goddess without peer,      Ishtar who shapes the lives of all mankind,      Thou stately world queen, sovran of the sky,      And lady ruler of the host of heaven--      Illustrious is thy name... O light divine,      Gleaming in lofty splendour o'er the earth--      Heroic daughter of the moon, oh! hear;      Thou dost control our weapons and award      In battles fierce the victory at will--      crown'd majestic Fate. Ishtar most high,      Who art exalted over all the gods,      Thou bringest lamentation; thou dost urge      With hostile hearts our brethren to the fray;      The gift of strength is thine for thou art strong;      Thy will is urgent, brooking no delay;      Thy hand is violent, thou queen of war      Girded with battle and enrobed with fear...      Thou sovran wielder of the wand of Doom,      The heavens and earth are under thy control.        Adored art thou in every sacred place,      In temples, holy dwellings, and in shrines,      Where is thy name not lauded? where thy will      Unheeded, and thine images not made?      Where are thy temples not upreared? O, where      Art thou not mighty, peerless, and supreme?        Anu and Bel and Ea have thee raised      To rank supreme, in majesty and pow'r,      They have established thee above the gods      And all the host of heaven... O stately queen,      At thought of thee the world is filled with fear,      The gods in heaven quake, and on the earth      All spirits pause, and all mankind bow down      With reverence for thy name... O Lady Judge,        Thy ways are just and holy; thou dost gaze      On sinners with compassion, and each morn      Leadest the wayward to the rightful path.        Now linger not, but come! O goddess fair,      O shepherdess of all, thou drawest nigh      With feet unwearied... Thou dost break the bonds      Of these thy handmaids... When thou stoopest o'er      The dying with compassion, lo! they live;      And when the sick behold thee they are healed.        Hear me, thy servant! hearken to my pray'r,      For I am full of sorrow and I sigh      In sore distress; weeping, on thee I wait.      Be merciful, my lady, pity take      And answer, \"'Tis enough and be appeased\".        How long must my heart sorrow and make moan      And restless be? How long must my dark home      Be filled with mourning and my soul with grief?      O lioness of heaven, bring me peace      And rest and comfort. Hearken to my pray'r!      Is anger pity? May thine eyes look down      With tenderness and blessings, and behold      Thy servant. Oh! have mercy; hear my cry      And unbewitch me from the evil spells,      That I may see thy glory... Oh! how long      Shall these my foes pursue me, working ill,      And robbing me"]]]
