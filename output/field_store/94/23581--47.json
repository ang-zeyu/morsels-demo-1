The principal animals, birds, etc., reared were the pig, ass, horse,  mule, cow, sheep, goat, buffalo, yak, fowl, duck, goose, pigeon,  silkworm, and bee.    The Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the successor to the Board  of Agriculture, Manufactures, and Commerce, instituted during recent  years, is now adapting Western methods to the cultivation of the  fertile soil of China, and even greater results than in the past may  be expected in the future.      Sentiments and Moral Ideas    The Chinese have always shown a keen delight in the beautiful--in  flowers, music, poetry, literature, embroidery, paintings,  porcelain. They cultivated ornamental plants, almost every house,  as we saw, having its garden, large or small, and tables were often  decorated with flowers in vases or ornamental wire baskets or fruits or  sweetmeats. Confucius made music an instrument of government. Paper  bearing the written character was so respected that it might not  be thrown on the ground or trodden on. Delight was always shown in  beautiful scenery or tales of the marvellous. Commanding or agreeable  situations were chosen for temples. But until within the last few  years streets and houses were generally unclean, and decency in public  frequently absent.    Morality was favoured by public opinion, but in spite of early  marriages and concubinage there was much laxity. Cruelty both  to human beings and animals has always been a marked trait in  the Chinese character. Savagery in warfare, cannibalism, luxury,  drunkenness, and corruption prevailed in the earliest times. The  attitude toward women was despotic. But moral principles pervaded the  classical writings, and formed the basis of law. In spite of these,  the inferior sentiment of revenge was, as we have seen, approved and  preached as a sacred duty. As a result of the universal _yin-yang_  dualistic doctrines, immorality was leniently regarded. In modern  times, at least, mercantile honour was high, \"a merchant's word  is as good as his bond\" being truer in China than in many other  countries. Intemperance was rare. Opium-smoking was much indulged in  until the use of the drug was forcibly suppressed (1906-16). Even now  much is smuggled into the country, or its growth overlooked by bribed  officials. Clan quarrels and fights were common, vendettas sometimes  continuing for generations. Suicide under depressing circumstances  was approved and honoured; it was frequently resorted to under the  sting of great injustice. There was a deep reverence for parents  and superiors. Disregard of the truth, when useful, was universal,  and unattended by a sense of shame, even on detection. Thieving was  common. The illegal exactions of rulers were burdensome. In times  of prosperity pride and satisfaction in material matters was not  concealed, and was often short-sighted. Politeness was practically  universal, though said to be often superficial; but gratitude was a  marked characteristic, and was heartfelt. Mutual conjugal affection  was strong. The love of gambling was universal.    But little has occurred in recent years to modify the above  characters. Nevertheless the inferior traits are certainly being  changed by education and by the formation of societies whose members  bind themselves against immorality, concubinage, gambling, drinking,  smoking, etc.      Religious Ideas    Chinese religion is inherently an attitude toward the spirits or gods  with the object of obtaining a benefit or averting a calamity. We  shall deal with it more fully in another chapter. Suffice it to say  here that it originated in ancestor-worship, and that the greater  part of it remains ancestor-worship to the present day. The State  religion, which was Confucianism, was ancestor-worship. Taoism,  originally a philosophy, became a worship of spirits--of the souls of  dead men supposed to have taken up their abode in animals, reptiles,  insects, trees, stones, etc.--borrowed the cloak of religion from  Buddhism, which eventually outshone it, and degenerated into a system  of exorcism and magic. Buddhism, a religion originating in India, in  which Buddha, once a man, is worshipped, in which no beings are known  with greater power than can be attained to by man, and according to  which at death the soul migrates into anything from a deified human  being to an elephant, a bird, a plant, a wall, a broom, or any piece  of inorganic matter, was imported ready made into China and took the  side of popular superstition and Taoism against the orthodox belief,  finding that its power lay in the influence on the popular mind of its  doctrine respecting a future state, in contrast to the indifference  of Confucianism. Its pleading for compassion and preservation of life  met a crying need, and but for it the state of things in this respect  would be worse than it is.    Religion, apart from ancestor-worship, does not enter largely  into Chinese life. There is none of the real 'love of God' found,  for example, in the fervent as distinguished from the conventional  Christian. And as ancestor-worship gradually loses its hold and dies  out agnosticism will take its place.      Superstitions    An almost infinite variety of superstitious practices, due to the  belief in the good or evil influences of departed spirits, exists in  all parts of China. Days are lucky or unlucky. Eclipses are due to a  dragon trying to eat the sun or the moon. The rainbow is supposed to be  the result of a meeting between the impure vapours of the sun and the  earth. Amulets are worn, and charms hung up, sprigs of artemisia or  of peach-blossom are placed near beds and over lintels respectively,  children and adults are 'locked to life' by means of locks on chains  or cords worn round the neck, old brass mirrors are supposed to cure  insanity, figures of gourds, tigers' claws, or the unicorn are worn  to ensure good fortune or ward off sickness, fire, etc., spells of  many kinds, composed mostly of the written characters for happiness  and longevity, are worn, or written on paper, cloth, leaves, etc.,  and burned, the ashes being made into a decoction and drunk by the  young or sick.    Divination by means of the divining stalks (the divining plant,  milfoil or yarrow) and the tortoiseshell has been carried on from  time immemorial, but was not originally practised with the object of  ascertaining future events, but in order to decide doubts, much as  lots are drawn or a coin tossed in the West. _Feng-shui_, \"the art of  adapting the residence of the living and the dead so as to co-operate  and harmonize with the local currents of the cosmic breath\" (the _yin_  and the _yang_: see Chapter III), a doctrine which had its root in  ancestor-worship, has exercised an enormous influence on Chinese  thought and life from the earliest times, and especially from those  of Chu Hsi and other philosophers of the Sung dynasty.      Knowledge    Having noted that Chinese education was mainly literary, and why it  was so, it is easy to see that there would be little or no demand  for the kind of knowledge classified in the West under the head of  science. In so far as any demand existed, it did so, at any rate at  first, only because it subserved vital needs. Thus, astronomy, or more  properly astrology, was studied in order that the calendar might be  regulated, and so the routine of agriculture correctly followed, for  on that depended the people's daily rice, or rather, in the beginning,  the various fruits and kinds of flesh which constituted their means of  sustentation before their now universal food was known. In philosophy  they have had two periods of great activity, the first beginning with  Lao Tzu and Confucius in the sixth century B.C. and ending with the  Burning of the Books by the First Emperor, Shih Huang Ti, in 213 B.C.;  the second beginning with Chou Tzu (A.D. 1017-73) and ending with Chu  Hsi (1130-1200). The department of philosophy in the imperial library  contained in 190 B.C. 2705 volumes by 137 authors. There can be no  doubt that this zeal for the orthodox learning, combined with the  literary test for office, was the reason why scientific knowledge was  prevented from developing; so much so, that after four thousand or more  years of national life we find, during the Manchu Period, which ended  the monarchical _regime_, few of the educated class, giants though they  were in knowledge of all departments of their literature and history  (the continuity of their traditions laid down in their twenty-four  Dynastic Annals has been described as one of the great wonders of the  world), with even the elementary scientific learning of a schoolboy  in the West. 'Crude,' 'primitive,' 'mediocre,' 'vague,' 'inaccurate,'  'want of analysis and generalization,' are terms we find applied to  their knowledge of such leading sciences as geography, mathematics,  chemistry, botany, and geology. Their medicine was much hampered  by superstition, and perhaps more so by such beliefs as that the  seat of the intellect is in the stomach, that thoughts proceed from  the heart, that the pit of the stomach is the seat of the breath,  that the soul resides in the liver, etc.--the result partly of the  idea that dissection of the body would maim it permanently during  its existence in the Otherworld. What progress was made was due to  European instruction; and this again is the _causa causans_ of the  great wave of progress in scientific and philosophical knowledge  which is rolling over the whole country and will have marked effects  on the history of the world during the coming century.      Language    Originally polysyllabic, the Chinese language later assumed a  monosyllabic, isolating, uninflected form, grammatical relations  being indicated by position. From the earliest forms of speech several  subordinate vernacular languages arose in various districts, and from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15255"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 1 (#8)"],[1,"and intellectual  activity in the north and, just as in the time of Moslim inroads, their  ravages had more serious consequences for Buddhism than for Hinduism.  The great Emperor Harsha ({~DAGGER~}647), of whom we know something from Bana and  Hsuean Chuang, became at the end of his life a zealous but eclectic  Buddhist. Yet it is plain from Hsiian Chuang's account that at this time  Buddhism was decadent in most districts both of the north and south.    This decadence was hastened by an unfortunate alliance with those forms  of magic and erotic mysticism which are called Saktism[24]. It is  difficult to estimate the extent of the corruption, for the singularity  of the evil, a combination of the austere and ethical teaching of Gotama  with the most fantastic form of Hinduism, arrests attention and perhaps  European scholars have written more about it than it deserves. It did  not touch the Hinayanist churches nor appreciably infect the Buddhism of  the Far East, nor even (it would seem) Indian Buddhism outside Bengal  and Orissa. Unfortunately Magadha, which was both the home and last  asylum of the faith, was also very near the regions where Saktism most  flourished. It is, as I have often noticed in these pages, a peculiarity  of all Indian sects that in matters of belief they are not exclusive nor  hostile to novelties. When a new idea wins converts it is the instinct  of the older sects to declare that it is compatible with their teaching  or that they have something similar and just as good. It was in this  fashion that the Buddhists of Magadha accepted Saktist and tantric  ideas. If Hinduism could summon gods and goddesses by magical methods,  they could summon Bodhisattvas, male and female, in the same way, and  these spirits were as good as the gods. In justice it must be said that  despite distortions and monstrous accretions the real teaching of Gotama  did not entirely disappear even in Magadha and Tibet.      8. _Later Forms of Hinduism_    In the eighth and ninth centuries this degenerate Buddhism was exposed  to the attacks of the great Hindu champions Kumarila and Sankara, though  it probably endured little persecution in our sense of the word. Both of  them were Smartas or traditionalists and laboured in the cause not of  Vishnuism or Sivaism but of the ancient Brahmanic religion, amplified by  many changes which the ages had brought but holding up as the religious  ideal a manhood occupied with ritual observances, followed by an old age  devoted to philosophy. Sankara was the greater of the two and would have  a higher place among the famous names of the world had not his respect  for tradition prevented him from asserting the originality which he  undoubtedly possessed. Yet many remarkable features of his life work,  both practical and intellectual, are due to imitation of the Buddhists  and illustrate the dictum that Buddhism did not disappear from India[25]  until Hinduism had absorbed from it all the good that it had to offer.  Sankara took Buddhist institutions as his model in rearranging the  ascetic orders of Hinduism, and his philosophy, a rigorously consistent  pantheism which ascribed all apparent multiplicity and difference to  illusion, is indebted to Mahayanist speculation. It is remarkable that  his opponents stigmatized him as a Buddhist in disguise and his system,  though it is one of the most influential lines of thought among educated  Hindus, is anathematized by some theistic sects[26].    Sankara was a native of southern India. It is not easy to combine in one  picture the progress of thought in the north and south, and for the  earlier centuries our information as to the Dravidian countries is  meagre. Yet they cannot be omitted, for their influence on the whole of  India was great. Greeks, Kushans, Huns, and Mohammedans penetrated into  the north but, until after the fall of Vijayanagar in 1565, no invader  professing a foreign religion entered the country of the Tamils. Left in  peace they elaborated their own version of current theological problems  and the result spread over India. Buddhism and Jainism also flourished  in the south. The former was introduced under Asoka but apparently  ceased to be the dominant religion (if it ever was so) in the early  centuries of our era. Still even in the eleventh century monasteries  were built in Mysore. Jainism had a distinguished but chequered career  in the south. It was powerful in the seventh century but subsequently  endured considerable persecution. It still exists and possesses  remarkable monuments at Sravana Belgola and elsewhere.    But the characteristic form of Dravidian religion is an emotional  theism, running in the parallel channels of Vishnuism and Sivaism and  accompanied by humbler but vigorous popular superstitions, which reveal  the origin of its special temperament. For the frenzied ecstasies of  devil dancers (to use a current though inaccurate phrase) are a  primitive expression of the same sentiment which sees in the whole world  the exulting energy and rhythmic force of Siva. And though the most  rigid Brahmanism still flourishes in the Madras Presidency there is  audible in the Dravidian hymns a distinct note of anti-sacerdotalism and  of belief that every man by his own efforts can come into immediate  contact with the Great Being whom he worships.    The Vishnuism and Sivaism of the south go back to the early centuries of  our era, but the chronology is difficult. In both there is a line of  poet-saints followed by philosophers and teachers and in both a  considerable collection of Tamil hymns esteemed as equivalent to the  Veda. Perhaps Sivaism was dominant first and Vishnuism somewhat later  but at no epoch did either extinguish the other. It was the object of  Sankara to bring these valuable but dangerous forces, as well as much  Buddhist doctrine and practice, into harmony with Brahmanism.    Islam first entered India in 712 but it was some time before it passed  beyond the frontier provinces and for many centuries it was too hostile  and aggressive to invite imitation, but the spectacle of a strong  community pledged to the worship of a single personal God produced an  effect. In the period extending from the eighth to the twelfth  centuries, in which Buddhism practically disappeared and Islam came to  the front as a formidable though not irresistible antagonist, the  dominant form of Hinduism was that which finds expression in the older  Puranas, in the temples of Orissa and Khajarao and the Kailasa at  Ellora. It is the worship of one god, either Siva or Vishnu, but a  monotheism adorned with a luxuriant mythology and delighting in the  manifold shapes which the one deity assumes. It freely used the  terminology of the Sankhya but the first place in philosophy belonged to  the severe pantheism of Sankara which, in contrast to this riotous  exuberance of legend and sculpture, sees the highest truth in one Being  to whom no epithets can be applied.    In the next epoch, say the twelfth to the seventeenth centuries, Indian  thought clearly hankers after theism in the western sense and yet never  completely acquiesces in it. Mythology, if still rampant according to  our taste, at least becomes subsidiary and more detachable from the  supreme deity, and this deity, if less anthropomorphic than Allah or  Jehovah, is still a being who loves and helps souls, and these souls are  explained in varying formulae as being identical with him and yet  distinct.    It can hardly be by chance that as the Hindus became more familiar with  Islam their sects grew more definite in doctrine and organization  especially among the Vishnuites who showed a greater disposition to form  sects than the Sivaites, partly because the incarnations of Vishnu offer  an obvious ground for diversity. About 1100 A.D.[27] the first great  Vaishnava sect was founded by Ramanuja. He was a native of the Madras  country and claimed to be the spiritual descendant of the early Tamil  saints. In doctrine he expressly accepted the views of the ancient  Bhagavatas, which had been condemned by Sankara, and he affirmed the  existence of one personal deity commonly spoken of as Narayana or  Vasudeva.    From the time of Sankara onwards nearly all Hindu theologians of the  first rank expounded their views by writing a commentary on the Brahma  Sutras, an authoritative but singularly enigmatic digest of the  Upanishads. Sankara's doctrine may be summarized as absolute monism  which holds that nothing really exists but Brahman and that Brahman is  identical with the soul. All apparent plurality is due to illusion. He  draws a distinction between the lower and higher Brahman which perhaps  may be rendered by God and the Godhead. In the same sense in which  individual souls and matter exist, a personal God also exists, but the  higher truth is that individuality, personality and matter are all  illusion. But the teaching of Ramanuja rejects the doctrines that the  world is an illusion and that there is a distinction between the lower  and higher Brahman and it affirms that the soul, though of the same  substance as God and emitted from him rather than created, can obtain  bliss not in absorption but in existence near him.    It is round these problems that Hindu theology turns. The innumerable  solutions lack neither boldness nor variety but they all try to satisfy  both the philosopher and the saint and none achieve both tasks. The  system of Sankara is a masterpiece of intellect, despite his  disparagement of reasoning in theology, and could inspire a fine piety,  as when on his deathbed he asked forgiveness for having frequented  temples, since by so doing he had seemed to deny that God is everywhere.  But piety of this kind is unfavourable to public worship and even to  those religious experiences in which the soul seems to have direct  contact with God in return for its tribute of faith and love.
