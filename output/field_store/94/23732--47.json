The molten metal took the  place of the wax as it was dissolved and flowed to all parts where it  had been. After being dropped in water the form was broken open,  revealing six nearly perfect little bells which were ready for use as  soon as the ashes were removed from them. The same method was used for  all other casting. Clay forms were made as desired, were covered with  wax, and the final coating of ashes applied before the casting. The  workers in copper and brass are under the care and guidance of a spirit,  Tolus ka towangan, for whom they make a yearly ceremony, _Gomek  towangan_.    FIG. 26. STAGES IN THE MANUFACTURE OF METAL BELLS.    FIG. 26. STAGE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF METAL BELLS.    [Transcriber's note: Two different figures on different pages are both  labeled FIG. 26.]    Of even greater importance are the smiths who are also under the care of  a powerful spirit for whom the _Gomek-gomanan_ ceremony is celebrated  each year, just prior to the planting time. Their forges are hidden away  in the hemp fields, and I was repeatedly informed that no woman might  see the smith at work. Whether or no such a rule is rigidly enforced at  all times I cannot say, but at no time did I see a woman about the forge  while the fire was burning, and although I was allowed to see and  photograph the process, my wife was at all times prevented from doing  so. The forge differs in no material respects from that used by the  brass casters, except that hollowed out logs replace the bamboo tubes,  and that a metal anvil and iron hammers are used. After an iron knife or  spear head has been roughly shaped, the smith splits the edge to a  slight depth and inserts a band of steel. The iron is pounded down on  the harder metal and the whole is brought to a white heat in the  charcoal fire. Removing it to the anvil the smith gives the blade one or  two light blows and returns it to the fire. This is repeated many times  before he begins to add the heavy strokes which finally weld the iron  and steel together. The blade having been given its final shape is again  heated and is held above a tube of water until the glowing metal begins  to turn a yellowish green, when it is plunged into the cold water. This  process, repeated many times, gives a fair temper to the whole weapon.  Charcoal for the fire is secured by burning logs and chilling them  suddenly with cold water.    Brass wire, secured in trade, is made into bracelets in the following  manner. In order to soften it and make it more easily worked the roll of  wire is heated until it begins to turn grey, when it is allowed to cool  and is scraped, so as to restore the yellow color. One end is laid on an  anvil made of an iron strip on a wooden block (Plate XXVII), and is cut  into various designs by means of metal dies. A wooden cone is used as a  form, about which the wire is placed in order to shape and measure it.    Hemp[20] grows wild in the Davao District and the Bagobo have, for  generations, used it in the manufacture of their clothing. In recent  years the demand for fiber has shown the people an easy way to secure  the trade articles which they desire and, as a result, rather extensive  plantings are found even in the more remote districts. The women strip a  large part of the fiber in local use, but all that prepared for trade is  produced by the men. When the ever-present cogon grass begins to invade  a clearing, the young hemp is planted. In about eighteen months it has  grown to a height of some sixteen feet and is ready to be cut. The man  goes to the fields, cuts down some stalks and, having removed the  leaves, splits off the outer fiber layers from the cellular matter of  the interior, using a bone knife for this purpose. When he has  accumulated a sufficient number of strips he carries them to the hemp  machine (Fig. 27). This consists of a knife which rests on a wooden  block. The handle turns on a pivot and the end is drawn upwards by means  of a bent twig, or sapling, which acts as a spring. This spring is  lowered and the knife blade raised by means of a foot treadle; a strip  of hemp is laid on the block; the foot pressure is removed, and the  knife descends. Taking a firm hold of one end of the strip, the operator  draws it toward him under the blade, thus removing the pulp and leaving  the free hemp threads. These are hung in the sun until dry, when they  are tied in bundles ready to be carried to the coast. The work is hard  and, unless necessity forces him to greater effort, a man seldom engages  in it for more than three or four days in a month. He thinks his duty  ceases with this expenditure of energy and, unless he is fortunate  enough to possess animals or slaves, is quite content to allow his wife,  or wives, to carry the product to the coast trader.    [20] _Musa textilis_.    FIG. 27. HEMP MACHINE.    During ceremonies and at festivals a fermented drink made of sugar cane  is served, and in anticipation of its pleasurable effects the Bagobo is  willing to expend a considerable amount of effort. The juice of the cane  is extracted by means of a press made of two logs arranged in parallel  horizontal positions, so that the end of a wooden lever can slip under  one and rest in a groove cut in the other (Fig. 28). The cane is placed  in the groove and the operator bears his weight on the lever, thus  squeezing out the juice. After being boiled with the bark of certain  trees and lime juice, the liquor is sealed in jars or bamboo tubes and  is stored away until needed.    FIG. 28. SUGAR CANE PRESS.    The sago palm is found in parts of the Bagobo territory, and in times of  need, the people make temporary camps near to the sago districts, where  they prepare the flour. This is done in the same manner as is fully  described on page 140.    The most important thing in the life of the Bagobo is the care of the  rice, for on this crop he depends for the greater part of his food  supply, and by its condition he can ascertain with what favor he is  looked upon by the spirits. So closely is the cultivation of this cereal  coupled with the religious beliefs that it is necessary, in this  relation, to describe the ceremonies connected with it.    We have previously stated that the incursion of the cogon grass into the  fields makes necessary some new clearings each year. In the month of  December a constellation known as _Balatik_ appears in the sky. This has  a double significance; first, it is the reminder for the yearly  sacrifice; and secondly, it notifies all workers that the tools, which  are to be used in making new clearings, shall be placed in readiness.  All those who expect to prepare new fields for themselves, or are to  assist others in such work, gather at the forge of the local smith and  there take part in a ceremony held in honor of his patron spirit. They  carry with them offerings of rice and chickens which they cook in bamboo  tubes, for food taken from a pot is not acceptable to this spirit. When  all is ready the food is placed on a rice winnower, near to the forge,  and on it the men lay their weapons and working knives (Plate XXIX).  Standing before the offering the smith, in a droning voice, calls on the  spirit, beseeching him to come and eat of the food, to accept the  weapons and tools, and having done so to be watchful over the workers  during the clearing time, so that they may not be injured in the work or  be molested by enemies. The prayer finished, the smith eats a little of  the food, and all the men follow his example, but no woman may so much  as touch this offering. Meanwhile other food which can be eaten by all  has been prepared. After the meal the weapons and tools which are to be  used during the clearing time are removed, but, as they now belong to  the spirit, they can never be disposed of without first recompensing  him. During this day there is a strict prohibition against music and  dancing. For three days the men abstain from work and the forge stands  idle. When the fire is again lighted the first knife made is the  property of the spirit.    With the ending of the period of taboo the workers go to the fields and,  in the center of each, place a _tambara_[21] fitted with a white dish  containing betel nut. This is an offering to Eugpamolak Manobo, who is  besought to drive from the field any _tigbanawa_ or _tagamaling_[22] who  may live there, to keep the workers in good health, to allow an abundant  crop, and, finally, to make the owner rich and happy. The weeds, brush,  and trees, after being cut and allowed to dry are fired, while the logs  remaining after this initial burning are piled together and again set on  fire, and the field is ready for the planting. No soil is broken and not  a seed goes into the ground until the spirits again designate the time,  by placing the constellation _Marara_ in the sky. This appears early in  April, and is followed by a period of great activity in the fields. If,  for any reason, the owner of the land cannot plant at this time, he has  two or more opportunities given him when the constellations _Mamari_ and  _Bwaya_ appear, the latter toward the end of June.    [21] See p. 66, Fig. 12.    [22] Evil spirits which are classed with the _buso_. See p. 107.    When the workers go to the field on the day set for the planting they  enter at one corner and proceed directly across it to the far left hand  corner where they erect a small house or place a _tambara_ which is  known as _pEmEg'ge_. As soon as it is complete, the _mabalian_ begin to  call on the spirits. Manama[23] is called first and after him other  spirits, according to their rank and power. They are informed that the  planting is about to begin and that the people are showing them this  mark of respect so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18274"],[0,"A Book of Natural History (#8)"],[1,"captured,  they resist by throwing their arms about their opponent, and  attempting to draw him into contact with their teeth.\"    With respect to this last point Dr. Savage is very explicit in another  place:    \"_Biting_ is their principal art of defence. I have seen one man who  had been thus severely wounded in the feet.    \"The strong development of the canine teeth in the adult would seem to  indicate a carnivorous propensity; but in no state save that of  domestication do they manifest it. At first they reject flesh, but  easily acquire a fondness for it. The canines are early developed, and  evidently designed to act the important part of weapons of defence.  When in contact with man almost the first effort of the animal is--_to  bite_.    \"They avoid the abodes of men, and build their habitations in trees.  Their construction is more that of _nests_ than _huts_, as they have  been erroneously termed by some naturalists. They generally build not  far above the ground. Branches or twigs are bent, or partly broken,  and crossed, and the whole supported by the body of a limb or a  crotch. Sometimes a nest will be found near the _end_ of a _strong  leafy branch_ twenty or thirty feet from the ground. One I have lately  seen that could not be less than forty feet, and more probably it was  fifty. But this is an unusual height.    \"Their dwelling-place is not permanent, but changed in pursuit of food  and solitude, according to the force of circumstances. We most often  see them in elevated places; but this arises from the fact that the  low grounds, being more favorable for the natives' rice-farms, are the  oftener cleared, and hence are almost always wanting in suitable trees  for their nests.... It is seldom that more than one or two nests are  seen upon the same tree, or in the same neighborhood: five have been  found, but it was an unusual circumstance.\" ...    \"They are very filthy in their habits. It is a tradition with the  natives generally here that they were once members of their own tribe;  that for their depraved habits they were expelled from all human  society, and that, through an obstinate indulgence of their vile  propensities, they have degenerated into their present state of  organization. They are, however, eaten by them, and when cooked with  the oil and pulp of the palm-nut considered a highly palatable morsel.    \"They exhibit a remarkable degree of intelligence in their habits,  and, on the part of the mother, much affection for their young. The  second female described was upon a tree when first discovered, with  her mate and two young ones (a male and a female). Her first impulse  was to descend with great rapidity and make off into the thicket with  her mate and female offspring. The young male remaining behind, she  soon returned to the rescue. She ascended and took him in her arms, at  which moment she was shot, the ball passing through the forearm of the  young one, on the way to the heart of the mother....    \"In a recent case the mother, when discovered, remained upon the tree  with her offspring, watching intently the movements of the hunter. As  he took aim, she motioned with her hand, precisely in the manner of a  human being, to have him desist and go away. When the wound has not  proved instantly fatal, they have been known to stop the flow of blood  by pressing with the hand upon the part, and when they did not  succeed, to apply leaves and grass.... When shot, they give a sudden  screech, not unlike that of a human, being in sudden and acute  distress.    \"The ordinary voice of the Chimpanzee, however, is affirmed to be  hoarse, guttural, and not very loud, somewhat like 'whoo-whoo.'\"    The analogy of the Chimpanzee to the Orang, in its nest-building habit  and in the mode of forming its nest, is exceedingly interesting,  while, on the other hand, the activity of this ape, and its tendency  to bite, are particulars in which it rather resembles the Gibbons. In  extent of geographical range, again, the Chimpanzees--which are found  from Sierra Leone to Congo--remind one of the Gibbons rather than of  either of the other man-like Apes; and it seems not unlikely that, as  is the case with the Gibbons, there may be several species spread over  the geographical area of the genus.    The same excellent observer, from whom I have borrowed the preceding  account of the habits of the adult Chimpanzee, published an account of  the Gorilla, which has, in its most essential points, been confirmed  by subsequent observers, and to which so very little has really been  added, that, in justice to Dr. Savage, I give it almost in full:    \"It should be borne in mind that my account is based upon the  statements of the aborigines of that region (the Gaboon). In this  connection it may also be proper for me to remark that, having been a  missionary resident for several years, studying, from habitual  intercourse, the African mind and character, I felt myself prepared to  discriminate and decide upon the probability of their statements.  Besides, being familiar with the history and habits of its interesting  congener (_Trogniger_, Geoff.), I was able to separate their accounts  of the two animals, which, having the same locality and a similarity  of habit, are confounded in the minds of the mass, especially as but  few--such as traders to the interior, and huntsmen--have ever seen the  animal in question.    \"The tribe from which our knowledge of the animal is derived, and  whose territory forms its habitat, is the _Mpongwe_, occupying both  banks of the River Gaboon, from its mouth to some fifty or sixty miles  upward....    \"If the word 'Pongo' be of African origin, it is probably a corruption  of the word _Mpongwe_, the name of the tribe on the banks of the  Gaboon, and hence applied to the region they inhabit. Their local name  for the Chimpanzee is _Enche-eko_, as near as it can be Anglicized,  from which the common term 'Jocko' probably conies. The _Mpongwe_  apellation for its new congener is _Enge-ena_, prolonging the sound of  the first vowel, and slightly sounding the second.    \"The habitat of the _Enge-ena_ is the interior of Lower Guinea, while  that of the _Enche-eko_ is nearer the seaboard.    \"Its height is about five feet; it is disproportionately broad across  the shoulders, thickly covered with coarse black hair, which is said  to be similar in its arrangement to that of the _Enche-eko_; with age  it becomes gray, which fact has given rise to the report that both  animals are seen of different colors.    \"Head.--The prominent features of the head are the great width and  elongation of the face, the depth of the molar region, the branches of  the lower jaw being very deep and extending far backward, and the  comparative smallness of the cranial portion; the eyes are very large,  and said to be like those of the _Enche-eko_, a bright hazel; nose  broad and flat, slightly elevated toward the root; the muzzle broad,  and prominent lips and chin, with scattered gray hairs; the under lip  highly mobile, and capable of great elongation when the animal is  enraged, then hanging over the chin; skin of the face and ears naked  and of a dark-brown, approaching to black.    \"The most remarkable feature of the head is a high ridge, or crest of  hair, in the course of the sagittal suture, which meets posteriorly  with a transverse ridge of the same, but less prominent, running round  from the back of one ear to the other. The animal has the power of  moving the scalp freely forward and back, and when enraged is said to  contract it strongly over the brow, thus bringing down the hairy ridge  and pointing the hair forward, so as to present an indescribably  ferocious aspect.    [Illustration: THE GORILLA.]    \"Neck short, thick, and hairy; chest and shoulders very broad, and  said to be fully double the size of the _Enche-ekos;_ arms very long,  reaching some way below the knee--the forearm much the shortest; hands  very large, the thumbs much larger than the fingers....    \"The gait is shuffling; the motion of the body, which is never upright  as in man, but bent forward, is somewhat rolling, or from side to  side. The arms being longer than the Chimpanzee, it does not stoop as  much in walking; like that animal, it makes progression by thrusting  its arms forward, resting the hands on the ground, and then giving the  body a half-jumping, half-swinging motion between them. In this act it  is said not to flex the fingers, as does the Chimpanzee, resting on  its knuckles, but to extend them, making a fulcrum of the hand. When  it assumes the walking posture, to which it is said to be much  inclined, it balances its huge body by flexing its arms upward.    \"They live in bands, but are not so numerous as the Chimpanzees; the  females generally exceed the other sex in number. My informants all  agree in the assertion that but one adult male is seen in a band; that  where the young males grow up a contest takes place for mastery, and  the strongest, by killing and driving out the others, establishes  himself as the head of the community.\"    Dr. Savage repudiates the stories about the Gorillas carrying off  women and vanquishing elephants, and then adds:    \"Their dwellings, if they may be so called, are similar to those of  the Chimpanzee, consisting simply of a few sticks and leafy branches,  supported by the crotches and limbs of trees; they afford no shelter,  and are occupied only at night.    \"They are exceedingly ferocious, and always offensive in their  habits, never running from man, as does the Chimpanzee. They are  objects of terror to the natives, and are never encountered by them  except on the defensive. The few that have been captured were killed  by elephant-hunters and native traders, as they came suddenly upon  them while passing through the forests.    \"It is said that when the male is first seen he gives a terrific yell,  that resounds far and wide through the forest, "]]]
