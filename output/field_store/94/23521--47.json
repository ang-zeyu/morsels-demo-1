[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14168"],[0,"Widdershins (#8)"],[1,"days away,  filling his head with a lot of moonshine about a new _Romilly_ (as if the  old one was not good enough), and now he was surprised that the devil  should enter an empty head!    Yes, he would go back. He would take a walk in the air first--he hadn't  walked enough lately--and then he would take himself in hand, settle  the hash of that sixteenth chapter of _Romilly_ (fancy, he had actually  been fool enough to think of destroying fifteen chapters!) and  thenceforward he would remember that he had obligations to his fellow-men  and work to do in the world. There was the matter in a nutshell.    He finished his brandy and went out.    He had walked for some time before any other bearing of the matter than  that on himself occurred to him. At first, the fresh air had increased  the heady effect of the brandy he had drunk; but afterwards his mind grew  clearer than it had been since morning. And the clearer it grew, the less  final did his boastful self-assurances become, and the firmer his  conviction that, when all explanations had been made, there remained  something that could not be explained. His hysteria of an hour before had  passed; he grew steadily calmer; but the disquieting conviction remained.  A deep fear took possession of him. It was a fear for Elsie.    For something in his place was inimical to her safety. Of themselves, her  two accidents might not have persuaded him of this; but she herself had  said it. \"_I'm not wanted here_...\" And she had declared that there was  something wrong with the place. She had seen it before he had. Well and  good. One thing stood out clearly: namely, that if this was so, she must  be kept away for quite another reason than that which had so confounded  and humiliated Oleron. Luckily she had expressed her intention of staying  away; she must be held to that intention. He must see to it.    And he must see to it all the more that he now saw his first impulse,  never to set foot in the place again, was absurd. People did not do that  kind of thing. With Elsie made secure, he could not with any respect to  himself suffer himself to be turned out by a shadow, nor even by a danger  merely because it was a danger. He had to live somewhere, and he would  live there. He must return.    He mastered the faint chill of fear that came with the decision, and  turned in his walk abruptly. Should fear grow on him again he would,  perhaps, take one more glass of brandy....    But by the time he reached the short street that led to the square he was  too late for more brandy. The little public-house was still lighted, but  closed, and one or two men were standing talking on the kerb. Oleron  noticed that a sudden silence fell on them as he passed, and he noticed  further that the long-nosed Barrett, whom he passed a little lower down,  did not return his good-night. He turned in at the broken gate, hesitated  merely an instant in the alley, and then mounted his stairs again.    Only an inch of candle remained in the Sheffield stick, and Oleron did  not light another one. Deliberately he forced himself to take it up and  to make the tour of his five rooms before retiring. It was as he returned  from the kitchen across his little hall that he noticed that a letter lay  on the floor. He carried it into his sitting-room, and glanced at the  envelope before opening it.    It was unstamped, and had been put into the door by hand. Its handwriting  was clumsy, and it ran from beginning to end without comma or period.  Oleron read the first line, turned to the signature, and then finished  the letter.    It was from the man Barrett, and it informed Oleron that he, Barrett,  would be obliged if Mr. Oleron would make other arrangements for the  preparing of his breakfasts and the cleaning-out of his place. The sting  lay in the tail, that is to say, the postscript. This consisted of a text  of Scripture. It embodied an allusion that could only be to Elsie  Bengough....    A seldom-seen frown had cut deeply into Oleron's brow. So! That was it!  Very well; they would see about that on the morrow.... For the rest, this  seemed merely another reason why Elsie should keep away....    Then his suppressed rage broke out....    The foul-minded lot! The devil himself could not have given a leer at  anything that had ever passed between Paul Oleron and Elsie Bengough,  yet this nosing rascal must be prying and talking!...    Oleron crumpled the paper up, held it in the candle flame, and then  ground the ashes under his heel.    One useful purpose, however, the letter had served: it had created in  Oleron a wrathful blaze that effectually banished pale shadows.  Nevertheless, one other puzzling circumstance was to close the day. As he  undressed, he chanced to glance at his bed. The coverlets bore an impress  as if somebody had lain on them. Oleron could not remember that he  himself had lain down during the day--off-hand, he would have said that  certainly he had not; but after all he could not be positive. His  indignation for Elsie, acting possibly with the residue of the brandy in  him, excluded all other considerations; and he put out his candle, lay  down, and passed immediately into a deep and dreamless sleep, which, in  the absence of Mrs. Barrett's morning call, lasted almost once round the  clock.      VIII    To the man who pays heed to that voice within him which warns him that  twilight and danger are settling over his soul, terror is apt to appear  an absolute thing, against which his heart must be safeguarded in a twink  unless there is to take place an alteration in the whole range and scale  of his nature. Mercifully, he has never far to look for safeguards. Of  the immediate and small and common and momentary things of life, of  usages and observances and modes and conventions, he builds up  fortifications against the powers of darkness. He is even content that,  not terror only, but joy also, should for working purposes be placed in  the category of the absolute things; and the last treason he will commit  will be that breaking down of terms and limits that strikes, not at one  man, but at the welfare of the souls of all.    In his own person, Oleron began to commit this treason. He began to  commit it by admitting the inexplicable and horrible to an increasing  familiarity. He did it insensibly, unconsciously, by a neglect of the  things that he now regarded it as an impertinence in Elsie Bengough to  have prescribed. Two months before, the words \"a haunted house,\" applied  to his lovely bemusing dwelling, would have chilled his marrow; now,  his scale of sensation becoming depressed, he could ask \"Haunted by  what?\" and remain unconscious that horror, when it can be proved to be  relative, by so much loses its proper quality. He was setting aside the  landmarks. Mists and confusion had begun to enwrap him.    And he was conscious of nothing so much as of a voracious  inquisitiveness. He wanted _to know_. He was resolved to know. Nothing  but the knowledge would satisfy him; and craftily he cast about for means  whereby he might attain it.    He might have spared his craft. The matter was the easiest imaginable. As  in time past he had known, in his writing, moments when his thoughts  had seemed to rise of themselves and to embody themselves in words not to  be altered afterwards, so now the questions he put himself seemed to be  answered even in the moment of their asking. There was exhilaration in  the swift, easy processes. He had known no so such joy in his own power  since the days when his writing had been a daily freshness and a delight  to him. It was almost as if the course he must pursue was being dictated  to him.    And the first thing he must do, of course, was to define the problem. He  defined it in terms of mathematics. Granted that he had not the place to  himself; granted that the old house had inexpressibly caught and engaged  his spirit; granted that, by virtue of the common denominator of the  place, this unknown co-tenant stood in some relation to himself: what  next? Clearly, the nature of the other numerator must be ascertained.    And how? Ordinarily this would not have seemed simple, but to Oleron it  was now pellucidly clear. The key, _of course_, lay in his half-written  novel--or rather, in both _Romillys_, the old and the proposed new one.    A little while before Oleron would have thought himself mad to have  embraced such an opinion; now he accepted the dizzying hypothesis without  a quiver.    He began to examine the first and second _Romillys_.    From the moment of his doing so the thing advanced by leaps and bounds.  Swiftly he reviewed the history of the _Romilly_ of the fifteen chapters.  He remembered clearly now that he had found her insufficient on the very  first morning on which he had sat down to work in his new place. Other  instances of his aversion leaped up to confirm his obscure investigation.  There had come the night when he had hardly forborne to throw the whole  thing into the fire; and the next morning he had begun the planning of  the new _Romilly_. It had been on that morning that Mrs. Barrett,  overhearing him humming a brief phrase that the dripping of a tap the  night before had suggested, had informed him that he was singing some air  he had never in his life heard before, called \"The Beckoning Fair  One.\"...    The Beckoning Fair One!...    With scarcely a pause in thought he continued:    The first _Romilly_ having been definitely thrown over, the second had  instantly fastened herself upon him, clamouring for birth in his brain.  He even fancied now, looking back, that there had been something like  passion, hate almost, in the supplanting, and that more than once a stray  thought given to his discarded creation had--(it was astonishing how  credible Oleron found the almost unthinkable idea)--had offended the  supplanter.    Yet that a malignancy almost homicidal should be extended to his  fiction's poor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14209"],[0,"The Kybalion (#8)"],[1,"the facts and  phenomena of the Universe as they present themselves to our mortal  faculties--we are not THE ALL, remember.    To take familiar illustrations, we all recognize the fact that matter  \"exists\" to our senses--we will fare badly if we do not. And yet, even  our finite minds understand the scientific dictum that there is no such  thing as Matter from a scientific point of view--that which we call  Matter is held to be merely an aggregation of atoms, which atoms  themselves are merely a grouping of units of force, called electrons or  \"ions,\" vibrating and in constant circular motion. We kick a stone and  we feel the impact--it seems to be real, notwithstanding that we know it  to be merely what we have stated above. But remember that our foot,  which feels the impact by means of our brains, is likewise Matter, so  constituted of electrons, and for that matter so are our brains. And, at  the best, if it were not by reason of our Mind, we would not know the  foot or stone at all.    Then again, the ideal of the artist or sculptor, which he is endeavoring  to reproduce in stone or on canvas, seems very real to him. So do the  characters in the mind of the author; or dramatist, which he seeks to  express so that others may recognize them. And if this be true in the  case of our finite minds, what must be the degree of Reality in the  Mental Images created in the Mind of the Infinite? Oh, friends, to  mortals this Universe of Mentality is very real indeed--it is the only  one we can ever know, though we rise from plane to plane, higher and  higher in it. To know it otherwise, but actual experience, we must be  THE ALL itself. It is true that the higher we rise in the scale--the  nearer to \"the mind of the Father\" we reach--the more apparent becomes  the illusory nature of finite things, but not until THE ALL finally  withdraws us into itself does the vision actually vanish.    So, we need not dwell upon the feature of illusion. Rather let us,  recognizing the real nature of the Universe, seek to understand its  mental laws, and endeavor to use them to the best effect in our upward  progress through life, as we travel from plane to plane of being. The  Laws of the Universe are none the less \"Iron Laws\" because of the mental  nature. All, except THE ALL, are bound by them. What is IN THE INFINITE  MIND OF THE ALL is REAL in a degree second only to that Reality itself  which is vested in the nature of THE ALL.    So, do not feel insecure or afraid--we are all HELD FIRMLY IN THE  INFINITE MIND OF THE ALL, and there is naught to hurt us or for us to  fear. There is no Power outside of THE ALL to affect us. So we may rest  calm and secure. There is a world of comfort and security in this  realization when once attained. Then \"calm and peaceful do we sleep,  rocked in the Cradle of the Deep\"--resting safely on the bosom of the  Ocean of Infinite Mind, which is THE ALL. In THE ALL, indeed, do \"we  live and move and have our being.\"    Matter is none the less Matter to us, while we dwell on the plane of  Matter, although we know it to be merely an aggregation of \"electrons,\"  or particles of Force, vibrating rapidly and gyrating around each other  in the formations of atoms; the atoms in turn vibrating and gyrating,  forming molecules, which latter in turn form larger masses of Matter.  Nor does Matter become less Matter, when we follow the inquiry still  further, and learn from the Hermetic Teachings, that the \"Force\" of  which the electrons are but units is merely a manifestation of the Mind  of THE ALL, and like all else in the Universe is purely Mental in its  nature. While on the Plane of matter, we must recognize its phenomena--  we may control Matter (as all Masters of higher or lesser degree do),  but we do so by applying the higher forces. We commit a folly when we  attempt to deny the existence of Matter in the relative aspect. We may  deny its mastery over us--and rightly so--but we should not attempt to  ignore it in its relative aspect, at least so long as we dwell upon its  plane.    Nor do the Laws of Nature become less constant or effective, when we  know them, likewise, to be merely mental creations. They are in full  effect on the various planes. We overcome the lower laws, by applying  still higher ones--and in this way only. But we cannot escape Law or  rise above it entirely. Nothing but THE ALL can escape Law--and that  because THE ALL is LAW itself, from which all Laws emerge. The most  advanced Masters may acquire the powers usually attributed to the gods  of men; and there are countless ranks of being, in the great hierarchy  of life, whose being and power transcends even that of the highest  Masters among men to a degree unthinkable by mortals, but even the  highest Master, and the highest Being, must bow to the Law, and be as  Nothing in the eye of THE ALL. So that if even these highest Beings,  whose powers exceed even those attributed by men to their gods--if even  these are bound by and are subservient to Law, then imagine the  presumption of mortal man, of our race and grade, when he dares to  consider the Laws of Nature as \"unreal!\" visionary and illusory, because  he happens to be able to grasp the truth that the Laws are Mental in  nature, and simply Mental Creations of THE ALL. Those Laws which THE ALL  intends to be governing Laws are not to be defied or argued away. So  long as the Universe endures, will they endure--for the Universe exists  by virtue of these Laws which form its framework and which hold it  together.    The Hermetic Principle of Mentalism, while explaining the true nature of  the Universe upon the principle that all is Mental, does not change the  scientific conceptions of the Universe, Life, or Evolution. In fact,  science merely corroborates the Hermetic Teachings. The latter merely  teaches that the nature of the Universe is \"Mental,\" while modern  science has taught that it is \"Material\"; or (of late) that it is  \"Energy\" at the last analysis. The Hermetic Teachings have no fault to  find with Herbert Spencer's basic principle which postulates the  existence of an \"Infinite and Eternal Energy, from which all things  proceed.\" In fact, the Hermetics recognize in Spencer's philosophy the  highest outside statement of the workings of the Natural Laws that have  ever been promulgated, and they believe Spencer to have been a  reincarnation of an ancient philosopher who dwelt in ancient Egypt  thousands of years ago, and who later incarnated as Heraclitus, the  Grecian philosopher who lived B. C. 500. And they regard his statement  of the \"Infinite and Eternal Energy\" as directly in the line of the  Hermetic Teachings, always with the addition of their own doctrine  that his \"Energy\" is the Energy of the Mind of THE ALL. With the  Master-Key of the Hermetic Philosophy, the student of Spencer will be  able to unlock many doors of the inner philosophical conceptions of the  great English philosopher, whose work shows the results of the  preparation of his previous incarnations. His teachings regarding  Evolution and Rhythm are in almost perfect agreement with the Hermetic  Teachings regarding the Principle of Rhythm.    So, the student of Hermetics need not lay aside any of his cherished  scientific views regarding the Universe. All he is asked to do is to  grasp the underlying principle of \"THE ALL is Mind; the Universe is  Mental--held in the mind of THE ALL.\" He will find that the other six of  the Seven Principles will \"fit into\" his scientific knowledge, and will  serve to bring out obscure points and to throw light in dark corners.  This is not to be wondered at, when we realize the influence of the  Hermetic thought of the early philosophers of Greece, upon whose  foundations of thought the theories of modern science largely rest. The  acceptance of the First Hermetic Principle (Mentalism) is the only great  point of difference between Modern Science and Hermetic students, and  Science is gradually moving toward the Hermetic position in its groping  in the dark for a way out of the Labyrinth into which it has wandered in  its search for Reality.    The purpose of this lesson is to impress upon the minds of our students  the fact that, to all intents and purposes, the Universe and its laws,  and its phenomena, are just as REAL, so far as Man is concerned, as they  would be under the hypotheses of Materialism or Energism. Under any  hypothesis the Universe in its outer aspect is changing, ever-flowing,  and transitory--and therefore devoid of substantiality and reality. But  (note the other pole of the truth) under the same hypotheses, we are  compelled to ACT AND LIVE as if the fleeting things were real and  substantial. With this difference, always, between the various  hypotheses--that under the old views Mental Power was ignored as a  Natural Force, while under Mentalism it becomes the Greatest Natural  Force. And this one difference revolutionizes Life, to those who  understand the Principle and its resulting laws and practice.    So, finally, students all, grasp the advantage of Mentalism, and learn  to know, use and apply the laws resulting therefrom. But do not yield to  the temptation which, as The Kybalion states, overcomes the half-wise  and which causes them to be hypnotized by the apparent unreality of  things, the consequence being that they wander about like dream-people  dwelling in a world of dreams, ignoring the practical work and life of  man, the end being that \"they are broken against the rocks and torn  asunder by the elements, by reason of their folly.\" Rather follow the  example of the wise, which the same authority states, \"use Law against  Laws; the higher against the lower; and by the Art of Alchemy transmute  that which is undesirable into that which is worthy, and thus triumph.\"  Following the authority, let us avoid the half-wisdom (which is folly)  which ignores the truth that: \"Mastery consists not in abnormal dreams,"]]]
