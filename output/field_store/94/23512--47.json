Now indeed would he hunt big game. A slow smile  touched his lips as his finger closed gradually upon the trigger.  The rifle spoke and a German machine gunner collapsed behind his  weapon. In three minutes Tarzan picked off the crew of that gun.  Then he spotted a German officer emerging from a dugout and the  three men in the bay with him. Tarzan was careful to leave no one  in the immediate vicinity to question how Germans could be shot in  German trenches when they were entirely concealed from enemy view.    Again adjusting his sights he took a long-range shot at a distant  machine-gun crew to his right. With calm deliberation he wiped them  out to a man. Two guns were silenced. He saw men running through  the trenches and he picked off several of them. By this time the  Germans were aware that something was amiss--that an uncanny sniper  had discovered a point of vantage from which this sector of the  trenches was plainly visible to him. At first they sought to discover  his location in No Man's Land; but when an officer looking over  the parapet through a periscope was struck full in the back of the  head with a rifle bullet which passed through his skull and fell  to the bottom of the trench they realized that it was beyond the  parados rather than the parapet that they should search.    One of the soldiers picked up the bullet that had killed his  officer, and then it was that real excitement prevailed in that  particular bay, for the bullet was obviously of German make.  Hugging  the parados, messengers carried the word in both directions and  presently periscopes were leveled above the parados and keen eyes  were searching out the traitor. It did not take them long to locate  the position of the hidden sniper and then Tarzan saw a machine  gun being trained upon him.  Before it had gotten into action its  crew lay dead about it; but there were other men to take their  places, reluctantly perhaps; but driven on by their officers they  were forced to it and at the same time two other machine guns were  swung around toward the ape-man and put into operation.    Realizing that the game was about up Tarzan with a farewell shot  laid aside the rifle and melted into the hills behind him. For many  minutes he could hear the sputter of machinegun fire concentrated  upon the spot he had just quit and smiled as he contemplated the  waste of German ammunition.    \"They have paid heavily for Wasimbu, the Waziri, whom they crucified,  and for his slain fellows,\" he mused; \"but for Jane they can never  pay--no, not if I killed them all.\"    After dark that night he circled the flanks of both armies and  passed through the British out-guards and into the British lines.  No man saw him come. No man knew that he was there.    Headquarters of the Second Rhodesians occupied a sheltered position  far enough back of the lines to be comparatively safe from enemy  observation. Even lights were permitted, and Colonel Capell sat  before a field table, on which was spread a military map, talking  with several of his officers.  A large tree spread above them, a  lantern sputtered dimly upon the table, while a small fire burned  upon the ground close at hand. The enemy had no planes and no other  observers could have seen the lights from the German lines.    The officers were discussing the advantage in numbers possessed by  the enemy and the inability of the British to more than hold their  present position. They could not advance. Already they had sustained  severe losses in every attack and had always been driven back by  overwhelming numbers. There were hidden machine guns, too, that  bothered the colonel considerably. It was evidenced by the fact  that he often reverted to them during the conversation.    \"Something silenced them for a while this afternoon,\" said one of  the younger officers. \"I was observing at the time and I couldn't  make out what the fuss was about; but they seemed to be having a  devil of a time in a section of trench on their left. At one time I  could have sworn they were attacked in the rear--I reported it to  you at the time, sir, you'll recall--for the blighters were pepperin'  away at the side of that bluff behind them. I could see the dirt  fly. I don't know what it could have been.\"    There was a slight rustling among the branches of the tree above  them and simultaneously a lithe, brown body dropped in their midst.  Hands moved quickly to the butts of pistols; but otherwise there  was no movement among the officers.  First they looked wonderingly  at the almost naked white man standing there with the firelight  playing upon rounded muscles, took in the primitive attire and  the equally primitive armament and then all eyes turned toward the  colonel.    \"Who the devil are you, sir?\" snapped that officer.    \"Tarzan of the Apes,\" replied the newcomer.    \"Oh, Greystoke!\" cried a major, and stepped forward with  outstretched  hand.    \"Preswick,\" acknowledged Tarzan as he took the proffered  hand.    \"I didn't recognize you at first,\" apologized the major. \"The  last time I saw you you were in London in evening dress.  Quite a  difference--'pon my word, man, you'll have to admit it.\"    Tarzan smiled and turned toward the colonel. \"I overheard your  conversation,\" he said. \"I have just come from behind the German  lines. Possibly I can help you.\"    The colonel looked questioningly toward Major Preswick who quickly  rose to the occasion and presented the ape-man to his commanding  officer and fellows. Briefly Tarzan told them what it was that  brought him out alone in pursuit of the Germans.    \"And now you have come to join us?\" asked the colonel.    Tarzan shook his head. \"Not regularly,\" he replied. \"I must fight  in my own way; but I can help you. Whenever I wish I can enter the  German lines.\"    Capell smiled and shook his head. \"It's not so easy as you think,\"  he said; \"I've lost two good officers in the last week trying it--and  they were experienced men; none better in the Intelligence Department.\"    \"Is it more difficult than entering the British lines?\" asked  Tarzan.    The colonel was about to reply when a new thought appeared to occur  to him and he looked quizzically at the ape-man. \"Who brought you  here?\" he asked. \"Who passed you through our out-guards?\"    \"I have just come through the German lines and yours and passed  through your camp,\" he replied. \"Send word to ascertain if anyone  saw me.\"    \"But who accompanied you?\" insisted Capell.    \"I came alone,\" replied Tarzan and then, drawing himself to  his full height, \"You men of civilization, when you come into the  jungle, are as dead among the quick. Manu, the monkey, is a sage  by comparison. I marvel that you exist at all--only your numbers,  your weapons, and your power of reasoning save you. Had I a few  hundred great apes with your reasoning power I could drive the  Germans into the ocean as quickly as the remnant of them could  reach the coast. Fortunate it is for you that the dumb brutes cannot  combine. Could they, Africa would remain forever free of men. But  come, can I help you? Would you like to know where several machinegun  emplacements are hidden?\"    The colonel assured him that they would, and a moment later Tarzan  had traced upon the map the location of three that had been bothering  the English. \"There is a weak spot here,\" he said, placing a finger  upon the map. \"It is held by blacks; but the machine guns out in  front are manned by whites. If--wait! I have a plan. You can fill  that trench with your own men and enfilade the trenches to its  right with their own machine guns.\"    Colonel Capell smiled and shook his head. \"It sounds very easy,\"  he said.    \"It IS easy--for me,\" replied the ape-man. \"I can empty that section  of trench without a shot. I was raised in the jungle--I know the  jungle folk--the Gomangani as well as the others. Look for me again  on the second night,\" and he turned to leave.    \"Wait,\" said the colonel. \"I will send an officer to pass you  through the lines.\"    Tarzan smiled and moved away. As he was leaving the little group  about headquarters he passed a small figure wrapped in an officer's  heavy overcoat. The collar was turned up and the visor of the  military cap pulled well down over the eyes; but, as the ape-man  passed, the light from the fire illuminated the features of the  newcomer for an instant, revealing to Tarzan a vaguely familiar  face. Some officer he had known in London, doubtless, he surmised,  and went his way through the British camp and the British lines  all unknown to the watchful sentinels of the out-guard.    Nearly all night he moved across Kilimanjaro's foothills, tracking  by instinct an unknown way, for he guessed that what he sought would  be found on some wooded slope higher up than he had come upon his  other recent journeys in this, to him, little known country. Three  hours before dawn his keen nostrils apprised him that somewhere in  the vicinity he would find what he wanted, and so he climbed into  a tall tree and settled himself for a few hours' sleep.          Chapter IV    When the Lion Fed      Kudu, the sun, was well up in the heavens when Tarzan awoke. The  ape-man stretched his giant limbs, ran his fingers through his thick  hair, and swung lightly down to earth. Immediately he took up the  trail he had come in search of, following it by scent down into  a deep ravine. Cautiously he went now, for his nose told him that  the quarry was close at hand, and presently from an overhanging  bough he looked down upon Horta, the boar, and many of his kinsmen.  Un-slinging his bow and selecting an arrow, Tarzan fitted the shaft  and, drawing it far back, took careful aim at the largest of the  great pigs. In the ape-man's teeth were other arrows, and no sooner  had the first one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14012"],[0,"Ice-Caves of France and Switzerland (#8)"],[1,"steps, and so  descended, landing on a flooring composed of broken blocks and columns  of ice, with a certain amount of what seemed to be drifted snow. This  wall of ice, which was 72 feet long and 22 feet high, was not  vertical, but sloped the wrong way, caving in under the stream of ice;  and from the projecting top of the wall a long fringe of vast icicles  hung down, along the whole breadth of the fan. The effect of this was,  that we could walk between the ice-wall and the icicles as in a  cloister, with solid ice on the one hand and Gothic arcades of ice on  the other, the floor being likewise of ice, and the roof formed by the  junction of the wall with the top of the icicle-arcade. The floor of  this cloister was not 22 feet below the top of the wall, for it formed  the upper part of a gentle descending slope of ice, rounded off like a  fall of water, which seemed to flow from the lower part of the wall;  and the height of 22 feet is reckoned from the foot of this slope,  which terminated at a few feet of horizontal distance from the foot of  the wall. The wall of ice was plainly marked with horizontal bands,  corresponding, no doubt, to a number of years of successive deposits;  sometimes a few leaves, but more generally a strip of minuter debris,  signified the divisions between the annual layers. There had been many  columns of ice from fissures in the rock, but all had fallen except  one large ice-cascade, which flowed from a hole in the side of the  cave on to the main stream, about two-thirds of the distance down from  the snow. One particularly grand column had stood on the very edge of  the ice-wall, and its remains now lay below.    The flooring of mingled ice and snow, on which we stood, sloped through  about five vertical feet from the foot of the wall, and came to an end  on broken rocks, from which the terminal wall of the cave sprang up. The  effect of the view from this point, as we looked up the long slope of  ice to where the ladders and a small piece of sky were visible, was most  striking. The accompanying engraving is from a sketch which attempts to  represent it; the reality is much less prim, and much more full of  beautiful detail, but still the engraving gives a fair idea of the  general appearance of the cave.    While I was occupied in making sketches and measurements, Mignot was  engaged in chopping discontentedly at the floor, in two or three  different places. At length he seemed to find a place to his mind, and  chopped perseveringly till his axe went through, and then he suggested  that we should follow. The hole was not tempting. It opened into the  blackest possible darkness, and Mignot thrust his legs through,  feeling for a foothold, which, by lowering himself almost to his  armpits, he soon discovered: the foothold, however, proved to be a  loose stone, which gave way under him and bounded down, apparently  over an incline of like stones, to a distance which sounded very  alarming. But he would not give in, and at length, descending still  further by means of the snow in which the hole was made, he was  rewarded by finding a solid block which bore his weight, and he  speedily disappeared altogether, summoning me to follow. I proposed to  light a candle first, not caring to go through such a hole, in such a  floor, into no one knew what; but he was so very peremptory, evidently  thinking that if he had gone through without a pioneering candle his  monsieur might do the same, that there was nothing for it but to obey.  The hole was very near the junction of the floor with the slope of  stones where the floor terminated, and the space between the hole and  the slope seemed to be filled up with a confused mass of snow and ice,  in which the snow largely predominated; so that there was good hold  for hands and feet in passing down to the stones, which might be about  7 feet below the upper surface of the floor. Here we crouched in the  darkness, with our faces turned away from the presumed slope of  stones, till a light was struck. The accomplice did not find it in the  bond that he should go down, and he preferred to reserve his energies  for his own peculiar glaciere.    [Illustration: LOWER GLACIERE OF THE PRE DE S. LIVRES.]    As soon as the candle had mastered a portion of the darkness, we found  that we were squatting on a steeply sloping descent of large blocks of  stone, while in face of us was a magnificent wall of ice, evidently the  continuation of the wall above, marked most plainly with horizontal  lines. This wall passed down vertically to join the slope on which we  were, at a depth below our feet which the light of the candle had not  yet fathomed. The horizontal bands were so clear, that, if we had  possessed climbing apparatus, we could have counted the number of layers  with accuracy. Of course we scrambled down the stones, and found after a  time that the angle formed by the ice-wall and the slope of stones was  choked up at the bottom by large pieces of rock, one piled on another  just as they had fallen from the higher parts. These blocks were so  large, that we were able to get down among the interstices, in a spiral  manner, for some little distance; and when we were finally stopped,  still the ice-wall passed on below our feet, and there was no possible  chance of determining to what depth it went. The atmosphere at this  point was a sort of frozen vapour, most unpleasant in all respects, and  the candles burned very dimly. The thermometer stood at 32 deg., half-way  down the slope of stones.    We were able to stretch a string in a straight line from the lowest  point we reached, through the interstices of the blocks of stone, and  up to the entrance-hole, and this measurement gave 50 feet.  Considering the inclination of the upper ice-floor, and the sharpness  of the angle between the wall of ice and the line of our descent to  this lowest point, I believe that 50 feet will fairly represent the  height of the ice-wall from this point to the foot of the slope from  the upper wall; so that 72 feet will be the whole depth of ice, from  the top of the third ladder to the point where our further progress  downwards was arrested. The correctness of this calculation depends  upon the honesty of Mignot, who had charge of the farther end of the  string, and was proud of the wonders of his cave. A dishonest man  might easily, under the circumstances, have pulled up a few feet more  of string than was necessary, but 50 feet seemed in no way an  improbable result of the measurement.    [Illustration: SECTION OF THE LOWER GLACIERE OF THE PRE DE S. LIVRES.]    The ice was as solid and firm as can well be conceived. The horizontal  bands would seem to prove conclusively that it was no coating of greater  or less thickness on the face of a vertical wall of rock, an idea which  might suggest itself to anyone who had not seen it, and I think it  probable that the amount of ice represented in the section of the cave  is not an exaggeration. We were unable to measure the whole length of  the wall in the lower cave, from the large number of blocks of stone  which had fallen at one end, and lay against its face. Probably, from  the nature of the case, it was not so long as the 72 feet of wall above;  but we measured 50 feet, and could see it still passing on to the right  hand as we faced it. In trying to penetrate farther along the face, I  found a wing of the brown fly we had seen in considerable abundance on  the ice in La Genolliere, frozen into the remains of a column.    There was so very much to be observed on all sides, and the measurements  took up so much time, owing to the peculiar difficulties which attended  them, that I did not examine with sufficient care the curious floor of  ice through which we cut our way to the lower cavern. Neither did I  notice the roof of the cavern thus reached, which may be very different  from the shape of the upper surface of the floor composing it. If the  ice-wall goes straight up, and the roof is formed of the ice-floor  alone, then it is a very remarkable feature indeed. But, more probably,  the lower wall leans over more and more towards the top, and so forms as  it were a part of the roof. It is possible that, as the wall has grown,  each successive annual layer has projected farther and farther, till at  last some year very favourable to the increase of ice has carried the  projection for that year nearly to the opposite stones, and then an  unfavourable year or two would form the foot of the upper wall. This  seems more probable, from the loose constitution of the floor at the  point where it joins the stones, as if it were there only made up of  drift and debris, while the part of the floor nearer the foot of the  wall is solid ice. It has been suggested to me that possibly water  accumulates in the time of greatest thaw to a very large extent in the  lower parts of the cave, and the ice-floor is formed where the frost  first takes hold of this water. But the slope of the ice-floor is  against this theory, to a certain extent; and the amount of water  necessary to fill the cavity would be so enormous, that it is contrary  to all experience to imagine such a collection, especially as the cave  showed no signs of present thaw. The appearance of the rocks, too, in  the lower cave, and the surface of the ice-wall there, gave no  indications of the action of water; and there was no trace of ice among  the stones, as there certainly would have been if water had filled the  cave, and gradually retired before the attacks of frost, or in  consequence of the opening up of drainage. There were pieces of the  trunks of trees, also, and large bones, lying about at different levels  on the rocks. I never searched for bones in these caves, owing to the  absence of the stalagmitic covering which preserves cavern-bones from  decay; nor did I take any notice of such as presented themselves without  search, for the _bergers_ "]]]
