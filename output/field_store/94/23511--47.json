The fact tells its own story touching the young man's reputation for  capacity and integrity. He had never made the trip, knew nothing of the  journey, was unaccustomed to business transactions, had never been much  upon the river, but his tact and ability and honesty were so far trusted  that the trader was willing to risk the cargo in his care. The delight  with which the youth swung loose from the shore upon his clumsy craft,  with the prospect of a ride of eighteen hundred miles before him, and a  vision of the great world of which he had read and thought so much, may  be imagined. At this time he had become a very tall and powerful young  man. He had reached the height of six feet and four inches, a length of  trunk and limb remarkable even among the tall race of pioneers to which  he belonged.    Just before the river expedition, Lincoln had walked with a young girl  down to the river to show her his flatboat. She relates a circumstance  of the evening which is full of significance. \"We were sitting on the  banks of the Ohio, or rather on the boat he had made. I said to Abe that  the sun was going down. He said to me, 'That's not so; it don't really  go down; it seems so. The earth turns from west to east and the  revolution of the earth carries us under; we do the sinking, as you call  it. The sun, as to us, is comparatively still; the sun's sinking is only  an appearance.' I replied, 'Abe, what a fool you are!' I know now that I  was the fool, not Lincoln. I am now thoroughly satisfied that he knew  the general laws of astronomy and the movements of the heavenly bodies.  He was better read then than the world knows or is likely to know  exactly. No man could talk to me as he did that night unless he had  known something of geography as well as astronomy. He often commented or  talked to me about what he had read,--seemed to read it out of the book  as he went along. He was the learned boy among us unlearned folks. He  took great pains to explain; could do it so simply. He was diffident,  too.\"    But another change was about to come into the life of Abraham Lincoln.  In 1830 his father set forth once more on the trail of the emigrant. He  had become dissatisfied with his location in southern Indiana, and  hearing favorable reports of the prairie lands of Illinois hoped for  better fortunes there. He parted with his farm and prepared for the  journey to Macon County, Illinois. Abraham visited the neighbors and  bade them goodbye; but on the morning selected for their departure, when  it came time to start, he was missing. He was found weeping at his  mother's grave, whither he had gone as soon as it was light. The thought  of leaving her behind filled him with unspeakable anguish. The household  goods were loaded, the oxen yoked, the family got into the covered  wagon, and Lincoln took his place by the oxen to drive. One of the  neighbors has said of this incident: \"Well do I remember the day the  Lincolns left for Illinois. Little did I think that I was looking at a  boy who would one day be President of the United States!\"    An interesting personal sketch of Thomas Lincoln is given by Mr. George  B. Balch, who was for many years a resident of Lerna, Coles County,  Illinois. Among other things he says: \"Thomas Lincoln, father of the  great President, was called Uncle Tommy by his friends and Old Tom  Lincoln by other people. His property consisted of an old horse, a pair  of oxen and a few sheep--seven or eight head. My father bought two of  the sheep, they being the first we owned after settling in Illinois.  Thomas Lincoln was a large, bulky man, six feet tall and weighing about  two hundred pounds. He was large-boned, coarse-featured, had a large  blunt nose, florid complexion, light sandy hair and whiskers. He was  slow in speech and slow in gait. His whole appearance denoted a man of  small intellect and less ambition. It is generally supposed that he was  a farmer; and such he was, if one who tilled so little land by such  primitive modes could be so called. He never planted more than a few  acres, and instead of gathering and hauling his crop in a wagon he  usually carried it in baskets or large trays. He was uneducated,  illiterate, content with living from hand to mouth. His death occurred  on the fifteenth day of January, 1851. He was buried in a neighboring  country graveyard, about a mile north of Janesville, Coles County. There  was nothing to mark the place of his burial until February, 1861, when  Abraham Lincoln paid a last visit to his grave just before he left  Springfield for Washington. On a piece of oak board he cut the letters  T.L. and placed it at the head of the grave. It was carried away by some  relic-hunter, and the place remained as before, with nothing to mark it,  until the spring of 1876. Then the writer, fearing that the grave of  Lincoln's father would become entirely unknown, succeeded in awakening  public opinion on the subject. Soon afterward a marble shaft twelve feet  high was erected, bearing on its western face this inscription:        THOMAS LINCOLN      FATHER OF      THE MARTYRED PRESIDENT.      BORN      JAN. 6th, 1778      DIED      JAN. 15th, 1851.      LINCOLN.    \"And now,\" concluded Mr. Balch, \"I have given all that can be known of  Thomas Lincoln. I have written impartially and with a strict regard to  facts which can be substantiated by many of the old settlers in this  county. Thomas Lincoln was a harmless and honest man. Beyond this, one  will search in vain for any ancestral clue to the greatness of Abraham  Lincoln.\"    After reaching the new home in Illinois, young Lincoln worked with his  father until things were in shape for comfortable living. He helped to  build the log cabin, break up the new land and fence it in, splitting  the rails with his own hands. It was these very rails over which so much  sentiment was expended years afterward at an important epoch in  Lincoln's political career. During the sitting of the State Convention  at Decatur, a banner attached to two of these rails and bearing an  appropriate inscription was brought into the assemblage and formally  presented to that body amid a scene of unparalleled enthusiasm. After  that they were in demand in every State of the Union in which free labor  was honored. They were borne in processions by the people, and hailed by  hundreds of thousands as a symbol of triumph and a glorious vindication  of freedom and of the right and dignity of labor. These, however, were  not the first rails made by Lincoln. He was a practiced hand at the  business. As a memento of his pioneer accomplishment he preserved in  later years a cane made from a rail which he had split on his father's  farm.    The next important record of Lincoln's career connects him with Mr.  Denton Offutt. The circumstances which brought him into this relation  are thus narrated by Mr. J.H. Barrett: \"While there was snow on the  ground, at the close of the year 1830, or early in 1831, a man came to  that part of Macon County where young Lincoln was living, in pursuit of  hands to aid him in a flatboat voyage down the Mississippi. The fact was  known that the youth had once made such a trip, and his services were  sought for this occasion. As one who had his own subsistence to earn,  with no capital but his hands, he accepted the proposition made him.  Perhaps there was something of his inherited and acquired fondness for  exciting adventure impelling him to this decision. With him were also  employed his former fellow-laborer, John Hanks, and a son of his  step-mother named John Johnston. In the spring of 1831 Lincoln set out  to fulfil his engagement. The floods had so swollen the streams that the  Sangamon country was a vast sea before him. His first entrance into that  county was over these wide-spread waters in a canoe. The time had come  to join his employer on his journey to New Orleans, but the latter had  been disappointed by another person on whom he relied to furnish him a  boat on the Illinois river. Accordingly all hands set to work, and  themselves built a boat on that river, for their purposes. This done,  they set out on their long trip, making a successful voyage to New  Orleans and back.\"    Mr. Herndon says: \"Mr. Lincoln came into Sangamon County down the North  Fork of the Sangamon river, in a frail canoe, in the spring of 1831. I  can see from where I write the identical place where he cut the timbers  for his flatboat, which he built at a little village called Sangamon  Town, seven miles northwest of Springfield. Here he had it loaded with  corn, wheat, bacon, and other provisions destined for New Orleans, at  which place he landed in the month of May, 1831. He returned home in  June of that year, and finally settled in another little village called  New Salem, on the high bluffs of the Sangamon river, then in Sangamon  County and now in Menard County, and about twenty miles northwest of  Springfield.\"    The practical and ingenious character of Lincoln's mind is shown in the  act that several years after his river experience he invented and  patented a device for overcoming some of the difficulties in the  navigation of western rivers with which this trip had made him  familiar. The following interesting account of this invention is given:    \"Occupying an ordinary and commonplace position in one of the show-cases  in the large hall of the Patent Office is one little model which in ages  to come will be prized as one of the most curious and most sacred relics  in that vast museum of unique and priceless things. This is a plain and  simple model of a steamboat roughly fashioned in wood by the hand of  Abraham Lincoln. It bears date 1849, when the inventor was known simply  as a successful lawyer and rising politician of Central Illinois.  Neither his practice nor his politics took up so much of his time as to  prevent him from giving some attention to contrivances which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14006"],[0,"An English Grammar (#8)"],[1,"name of the emperor their master_,  instead of _the emperor their master's name_.      [Sidenote: _Possessive and no noun limited._]    67. The possessive is sometimes used without belonging to any noun  in the sentence; some such word as _house_, _store_, _church_,  _dwelling_, etc., being understood with it: for example,--         Here at the _fruiterer's_ the Madonna has a tabernacle of fresh       laurel leaves.--RUSKIN.         It is very common for people to say that they are disappointed in       the first sight of _St. Peter's_.--LOWELL.         I remember him in his cradle at _St. James's_.--THACKERAY.         Kate saw that; and she walked off from the _don's_.--DE QUINCEY.      [Sidenote: _The double possessive._]    68. A peculiar form, a double possessive, has grown up and become a  fixed idiom in modern English.    In most cases, a possessive relation was expressed in Old English by  the inflection _-es_, corresponding to _'s_. The same relation was  expressed in French by a phrase corresponding to _of_ and its object.  Both of these are now used side by side; sometimes they are used  together, as one modifier, making a double possessive. For this there  are several reasons:--    [Sidenote: _Its advantages: Euphony_.]    (1) When a word is modified by _a_, _the_, _this_, _that_, _every_,  _no_, _any_, _each_, etc., and at the same time by a possessive noun,  it is distasteful to place the possessive before the modified noun,  and it would also alter the meaning: we place it after the modified  noun with _of_.    [Sidenote: _Emphasis._]    (2) It is more emphatic than the simple possessive, especially when  used with _this_ or _that_, for it brings out the modified word in  strong relief.    [Sidenote: _Clearness._]    (3) It prevents ambiguity. For example, in such a sentence as, \"This  introduction _of Atterbury's_ has all these advantages\" (Dr. Blair),  the statement clearly means only one thing,--the introduction which  Atterbury made. If, however, we use the phrase _of Atterbury_, the  sentence _might_ be understood as just explained, or it might mean  this act of introducing Atterbury. (See also Sec. 87.)    The following are some instances of double possessives:--         This Hall _of Tinville's_ is dark, ill-lighted except where she       stands.--CARLYLE.         Those lectures _of Lowell's_ had a great influence with me, and       I used to like whatever they bade me like.--HOWELLS         Niebuhr remarks that no pointed sentences _of Caesar's_ can have       come down to us.--FROUDE.         Besides these famous books _of Scott's and Johnson's_, there is a       copious \"Life\" by Thomas Sheridan.--THACKERAY         Always afterwards on occasions of ceremony, he wore that quaint       old French sword _of the Commodore's_.--E.E. HALE.      Exercises.    (_a_) Pick out the possessive nouns, and tell whether each is  appositional, objective, or subjective.    (_b_) Rewrite the sentence, turning the possessives into equivalent  phrases.    1. I don't choose a hornet's nest about my ears.    2. Shall Rome stand under one man's awe?    3. I must not see thee Osman's bride.    4. At lovers' perjuries,     They say, Jove laughs.    5. The world has all its eyes on Cato's son.    6. My quarrel and the English queen's are one.    7. Now the bright morning star, day's harbinger,         Comes dancing from the East.    8. A man's nature runs either to herbs or weeds; therefore, let him  seasonably water the one, and destroy the other.    9.     'Tis all men's office to speak patience       To those that wring under the load of sorrow.    10. A jest's prosperity lies in the ear       Of him that hears it, never in the tongue       Of him that makes it.    11. No more the juice of Egypt's grape shall moist his lip.    12. There Shakespeare's self, with every garland crowned,       Flew to those fairy climes his fancy sheen.    13.     What supports me? dost thou ask?       The conscience, Friend, to have lost them [his eyes] overplied       In liberty's defence.    14. Or where Campania's plain forsaken lies,       A weary waste expanding to the skies.    15. Nature herself, it seemed, would raise       A minster to her Maker's praise!      HOW TO PARSE NOUNS.      69. Parsing a word is putting together all the facts about its  form and its relations to other words in the sentence.    In parsing, some idioms--the double possessive, for example--do not  come under regular grammatical rules, and are to be spoken of merely  as idioms.    70. Hence, in parsing a noun, we state,--    (1) The class to which it belongs,--common, proper, etc.    (2) Whether a neuter or a gender noun; if the latter, which gender.    (3) Whether singular or plural number.    (4) Its office in the sentence, determining its case.    [Sidenote: _The correct method._]    71. In parsing any word, the following method should always be  followed: tell the facts about what the word _does_, then make the  grammatical statements as to its class, inflections, and relations.      MODEL FOR PARSING.    \"What is bolder than a miller's neckcloth, which takes a thief by the  throat every morning?\"    _Miller's_ is a name applied to every individual of its class, hence  it is a common noun; it is the name of a male being, hence it is a  gender noun, masculine; it denotes only one person, therefore  singular number; it expresses possession or ownership, and limits  _neckcloth_, therefore possessive case.    _Neckcloth_, like _miller's_, is a common class noun; it has no sex,  therefore neuter; names one thing, therefore singular number; subject  of the verb _is_ understood, and therefore nominative case.    _Thief_ is a common class noun; the connection shows a male is meant,  therefore masculine gender; singular number; object of the verb  _takes_, hence objective case.    _Throat_ is neuter, of the same class and number as the word  _neckcloth_; it is the object of the preposition _by_, hence it is  objective case.    NOTE.--The preposition sometimes takes the possessive case (see Sec.  68).    _Morning_ is like _throat_ and _neckcloth_ as to class, gender, and  number; as to case, it expresses time, has no governing word, but is  the adverbial objective.      Exercise.      Follow the model above in parsing all the nouns in the following  sentences:--      1. To raise a monument to departed worth is to perpetuate virtue.    2. The greatest pleasure I know is to do a good action by stealth, and  to have it found out by accident.    3. An old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered serving man, a fresh  tapster.    4. That in the captain's but a choleric word,       Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.    5. Now, blessings light on him that first invented ... sleep!    6. Necker, financial minister to Louis XVI., and his daughter, Madame  de Stael, were natives of Geneva.    7. He giveth his beloved sleep.    8. Time makes the worst enemies friends.    9. A few miles from this point, where the Rhone enters the lake,  stands the famous Castle of Chillon, connected with the shore by a  drawbridge,--palace, castle, and prison, all in one.    10. Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth,       And hated her for her pride.    11. Mrs. Jarley's back being towards him, the military gentleman shook  his forefinger.          PRONOUNS.      [Sidenote: _The need of pronouns._]    72. When we wish to speak of a name several times in succession, it  is clumsy and tiresome to repeat the noun. For instance, instead of  saying, \"_The pupil_ will succeed in _the pupil's_ efforts if _the  pupil_ is ambitious,\" we improve the sentence by shortening it thus,  \"The pupil will succeed in _his_ efforts if _he_ is ambitious.\"    Again, if we wish to know about the ownership of a house, we evidently  cannot state the owner's name, but by a question we say, \"_Whose_  house is that?\" thus placing a word instead of the name till we learn  the name.    This is not to be understood as implying that pronouns were _invented_  because nouns were tiresome, since history shows that pronouns are as  old as nouns and verbs. The use of pronouns must have sprung up  naturally, from a necessity for short, definite, and representative  words.    [Sidenote: _Definition._]    A pronoun is a reference word, standing for a name, or for a person  or thing, or for a group of persons or things.      [Sidenote: _Classes of pronouns._]    73. Pronouns may be grouped in five classes:--    (1) Personal pronouns, which distinguish person by their form (Sec.  76).    (2) Interrogative pronouns, which are used to ask questions about  persons or things.    (3) Relative pronouns, which relate or refer to a noun, pronoun, or  other word or expression, and at the same time connect two statements  They are also called conjunctive.    (4) Adjective pronouns, words, primarily adjectives, which are  classed as adjectives when they modify nouns, but as pronouns when  they stand for nouns.    (5) Indefinite pronouns, which cannot be used as adjectives, but  stand for an indefinite number of persons or things.    Numerous examples of all these will be given under the separate  classes hereafter treated.      PERSONAL PRONOUNS.      [Sidenote: _Person in grammar._]    74. Since pronouns stand for persons as well as names, they must  represent the person talking, the person or thing spoken to, and the  person or thing talked about.    This gives rise to a new term, \"the distinction of _person_.\"    [Sidenote: Person _of nouns_.]    75. This distinction was not needed in discussing nouns, as nouns  have the _same form_, whether representing persons and things spoken  to or spoken of. It is evident that a noun could not represent the  person speaking, even if it had a special form.    From analogy to pronouns, which have _forms_ for person, nouns are  sometimes spoken of as first or second person by their _use_; that is,  if they are in apposition with a pronoun of the first or second  person, they are said"]]]
