I will now make amends for my want of regularity, and show you that I  can begin at the beginning, like other people; but all in good time.  To-day, in those portions of which you have acquired a mastery, we will  give particular attention to the expression, and to the correct use of  the pedal. If what I suggest to you with regard to the shading at any  place does not entirely correspond to your understanding of the piece,  or to your feeling, you must at once express your difference of opinion,  and ask me for the reason of my view. You, perhaps, do not like to play  this place _crescendo_, but _diminuendo_. Very well; only play it finely  in your own way; it will also sound very well so. I proposed the  _crescendo_ there, because the feeling grows more intense; perhaps, in  the next lesson, you will acknowledge that I was right. This place I  should play a very little slower, though without a striking  _ritardando_; then a little faster here; do you think it ought to be  played _crescendo_ or _diminuendo_? We must try in this variation to  present nicely shaded little pictures. Here you might use more energy  and decision. This place you should play merely with a correct  mechanical execution, but without special expression; for we require  shadow, in order that the succeeding idea, eminently suggestive of the  theme, shall be brought out with more brilliancy. In general, the whole  must be made to sound natural, without musical pretension, and as if it  were the production of the moment; and should not create a distorted,  overdrawn effect, or exhibit modern affectation.    Each piece that I undertake to teach you will give me an opportunity to  talk to you a great deal about the correct expression in playing, and  about its innumerable beauties, shades, and delicacies; while I shall  pay constant attention to the production of a beautiful singing tone.  The next piece will be Chopin's Notturno in E flat; for your touch has  already gained in fulness, and is now unobjectionable.    This is the tyranny with regard to correct execution, which stupidity  and folly have taxed me with having exercised towards my daughters.  \"Expression must come of itself!\" How cheap is this lazy subterfuge of  the followers of routine, and of teachers wanting in talent! We see and  hear a great many _virtuosos_, old and young, with and without talent,  renowned and obscure. They either play in an entirely mechanical manner  and with faulty and miserable touch, or else, which is less bearable,  they strut with unendurable affectation and produce musical  monstrosities. In order to conceal their indistinct mode of execution,  they throw themselves upon the two pedals, and are guilty of  inconceivable perversions.    But let us proceed with your instruction. You already play your piece  intelligently, with interest and enthusiasm, and without any of the  modern, empty affectations. If any other passage should occur to you at  the _fermata_ in the second part, which shall lead appropriately to the  dominant, try it; and combine it, perhaps, with that which is written.  You may make two passing shakes upon the four final sixteenth notes; but  you must play them very distinctly and clearly, and the last one weaker  than the first, in order to give it a delicate effect, as is done by  singers. With light variations of this kind, it is allowable to  introduce various ornaments, provided they are in good taste and nicely  executed. The case is quite different in the performance of the  compositions of Beethoven, Mozart, Weber, and others, where reverence  for the composer requires a stricter interpretation, although even this  is sometimes carried to a point of exaggeration and pedantry. Now try  the first variation once more. That is better: you already play the  skipping bass with more precision, more briskly and evenly. We begin to  perceive the correct speaking tone in the bass, and a certain delicacy  and freedom in the treble. You need not play both hands together in the  second variation, which is the most difficult, until the next lesson.  To-day you may first play the bass alone, while I play the treble; and  afterwards we will change parts, and you can play the treble while I  play the bass. But we will not go farther than the fourth variation. I  have not much more to say about this piece. We will begin next a  beautiful Etude by Moscheles, which I recommend highly to you, in order  to strengthen and give facility to the fourth and fifth fingers: this  may be your companion and friend during the next two or three months.    MRS. SOLID. Your very careful mode of instruction assures me that Emily  will acquire a mastery of these variations, and will learn to perform  them finely.    DOMINIE. She will be able, after a week or two, to execute this piece  with understanding and confidence, and to play it to her own  satisfaction and that of others; while her awakened consciousness of its  beauties and of her ability to interpret it will preserve her interest  for it.    The objection is quite untenable \"that children lose their pleasure in a  piece, if they are obliged to practise it until they know it.\" Do people  suppose that it gives more pleasure, when the teacher begins in a  stupid, helpless way, and tries to make the pupil swallow several pieces  at once, while he continually finds fault and worries them, than when  the pupil is enabled to play a few short, well-sounding exercises, with  perfect freedom and correctness, and to take delight in his success? or  when afterwards, or perhaps at the same time, he is conscious that he  can play one piece nicely and without bungling, while it is all  accomplished in a quiet and pleasant manner?    MRS. SOLID. Do you pursue the same course with longer and more difficult  pieces?    DOMINIE. Certainly, on the same principle.    MRS. SOLID. But, if you are so particular about every piece, and always  take so much pains to improve the touch, it will be a long time before  Emily will be able to execute several long pieces and can learn other  new ones beside.    DOMINIE. Do you wish your daughter to learn to jingle on the piano, in  order to become musical? or shall she grow more musical by learning to  play finely? I am sure the latter is your wish, as it is mine:  otherwise, you would be contented with an ordinary teacher. You must  consider that, when she has made a beginning, by learning to play one  piece thoroughly and quite correctly, the following pieces will be  learned more and more quickly; for she will have acquired a dexterity in  playing, as you may observe with yourself and with every one. To be able  to drum off fifty pieces in an imperfect manner does not justify the  expectation that the fifty-first piece will be learned more easily or  better; but to attain a perfect mastery of four or five pieces gives a  standard for the rest.    In this way, and by mechanical studies, such as I have begun with Emily,  the greatest ease in reading at sight is gradually developed, in which  all my pupils excel, when they have remained long enough under my  instruction, and in which my daughters are pre-eminent. But for this it  is necessary to continue to study single pieces, industriously and  artistically, and with great exactness; for otherwise the practice of  reading at sight, which often amounts to a passion, leads very soon to  slovenliness in piano-playing and to more or less vulgar machine-music.    MRS. SOLID. I am more and more convinced that a style of instruction  which is illogical, intermittent, superficial, and without method, can  lead to no good result, or at least to nothing satisfactory, even with  extraordinary talents; and that the unsound and eccentric manifestations  and caricatures of art, which cause the present false and deplorable  condition of piano-playing, are the consequence of such a prevalent mode  of instruction.          CHAPTER V.    ON THE PEDAL.      I have just returned exhausted and annihilated from a concert, where I  have been hearing the piano pounded. Two grand bravoura movements have  been thundered off, with the pedal continually raised; and then were  suddenly succeeded by a soft murmuring passage, during which the  thirteen convulsed and quivering bass notes of the _fortissimo_ were all  the time resounding. It was only by the aid of the concert programme  that my tortured ears could arrive at the conclusion that this confusion  of tones was meant to represent two pieces by Doehler and Thalberg.    Cruel fate that invented the pedal! I mean the pedal which raises the  dampers on the piano. A grand acquisition, indeed, for modern times!  Good heavens! Our piano performers must have lost their sense of  hearing! What is all this growling and buzzing? Alas, it is only the  groaning of the wretched piano-forte, upon which one of the modern  _virtuosos_, with a heavy beard and long hanging locks, whose hearing  has deserted him, is blustering away on a bravoura piece, with the pedal  incessantly raised,--with inward satisfaction and vain self-assertion!  Truly time brings into use a great deal that is far from beautiful:  does, then, this raging piano revolutionist think it beautiful to bring  the pedal into use at every bar? Unhappy delusion.    But enough of this serious jesting. Hummel never used the pedal. He was  an extremist; and, in his graceful, clear, elegant, neat, though not  grand playing, often lost fine effects, which would have been produced  by the correct and judicious use of the pedal; particularly on the  instruments of Stein, Brodmann, Conrad Graff, and others then in use,  which were usually lightly leathered, and had a thin, sharp tone. The  use of the pedal, of course always allowing it to fall frequently with  precision, was especially desirable in the upper treble, in cases where  the changes of the harmony were not very frequent; for the tone of those"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16667"],[0,"Young Folks' History of Rome (#8)"],[1,"of being declared accursed and losing his property; and they had  the power of stopping any decision of the senate by saying solemnly,  _Veto_, I forbid. They were called tribunes of the people, while the  officers in war were called military tribunes; and as it was on the Mons  Sacer, or Sacred Mount, that this was settled, these laws were called  the _Leges Sacrariae_. An altar to the Thundering Jupiter was built to  consecrate them: and, in gratitude for his management, Menenius Agrippa  was highly honored all his life, and at his death had a public funeral.    But the struggles of the plebeians against the patricians were not by  any means over. The Roman land--Agri (acre), it was called--had at first  been divided in equal shares--at least so it was said--but as belonging  to the state all the time, and only held by the occupier. As time went  on, some persons of course gathered more into their own hands, and  others of spendthrift or unfortunate families became destitute. Then  there was an outcry that, as the lands belonged to the whole state, it  ought to take them all back and divide them again more equally: but the  patricians naturally regarded themselves as the owners, and would not  hear of this scheme, which we shall hear of again and again by the name  of the Agrarian Law. One of the patricians, who had thrice been consul,  by name Spurius Cassius, did all he could to bring it about, but though  the law was passed he could not succeed in getting it carried out. The  patricians hated him, and a report got abroad that he was only gaining  favor with the people in order to get himself made king. This made even  the plebeians turn against him as a traitor; he was condemned by the  whole assembly of the people, and beheaded, after being scourged by the  lictors. The people soon mourned for their friend, and felt that they  had been deceived in giving him up to their enemies. The senate would  not execute his law, and the plebeians would not enlist in the next war,  though the senate threatened to cut down the fruit trees and destroy the  crops of every man who refused to join the army. When they were  absolutely driven into the ranks, they even refused to draw their swords  in face of the enemy, and would not gain a victory lest their consul  should have the honor of it.    [Illustration: SENATORIAL PALACE.]    This consul's name was Kaeso Fabius. He belonged to a very clever, wary  family, whose name it was said was originally _Foveus_ (ditch), because  they had first devised a plan of snaring wolves in pits or ditches. They  were thought such excellent defenders of the claims of the patricians  that for seven years following one or other of the Fabii was chosen  consul. But by-and-by they began either to see that the plebeians had  rights, or that they should do best by siding with them, for they went  over to them; and when Kaeso next was consul he did all he could to get  the laws of Cassius carried out, but the senate were furious with  him, and he found it was not safe to stay in Rome when his consulate was  over. So he resolved at any rate to do good to his country. The  Etruscans often came over the border and ravaged the country; but there  was a watch-tower on the banks of the little river Cremera, which flows  into the Tiber, and Fabius offered, with all the men of his name--306 in  number, and 4000 clients--to keep guard there against the enemy. For  some time they prospered there, and gained much spoil from the  Etruscans; but at last the whole Etruscan army came against them,  showing only a small number at first to tempt them out to fight, then  falling on them with the whole force and killing the whole of them, so  that of the whole name there remained only one boy of fourteen who had  been left behind at Rome. And what was worse, the consul, Titus  Menenius, was so near the army that he could have saved the Fabii, but  for the hatred the patricians bore them as deserters from their cause.    [Illustration: VIEW OF A ROMAN HARBOR.]    However, the tribune Publilius gained for the plebeians that there  should be five tribunes instead of two, and made a change in the manner  of electing them which prevented the patricians from interfering. Also  it was decreed that to interrupt a tribune in a public speech deserved  death. But whenever an Appius Claudius was consul he took his revenge,  and was cruelly severe, especially in the camp, where the consul as  general had much more power than in Rome. Again the angry plebeians  would not fight, but threw down their arms in sight of the enemy.  Claudius scourged and beheaded; they endured grimly and silently,  knowing that when he returned to Rome and his consulate was over their  tribunes would call him to account. And so they did, and before all the  tribes of Rome summoned him to answer for his savage treatment of free  Roman citizens. He made a violent answer, but he saw how it would go  with him, and put himself to death to avoid the sentence. So were the  Romans proving again and again the truth of Agrippa's parable, that  nothing can go well with body or members unless each will be ready to  serve the other.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER IX.    CORIOLANUS AND CINCINNATUS.    B.C. 458.      All the time these struggles were going on between the patricians and  the plebeians at home, there were wars with the neighboring tribes, the  Volscians, the Veians, the Latins, and the Etruscans. Every spring the  fighting men went out, attacked their neighbors, drove off their cattle,  and tried to take some town; then fought a battle, and went home to reap  the harvest, gather the grapes and olives in the autumn, and attend to  public business and vote for the magistrates in the winter. They were  small wars, but famous men fought in them. In a war against the  Volscians, when Cominius was consul, he was besieging a city called  Corioli, when news came that the men of Antium were marching against  him, and in their first attack on the walls the Romans were beaten off,  but a gallant young patrician, descended from the king Ancus Marcius,  Caius Marcius by name, rallied them and led them back with such spirit  that the place was taken before the hostile army came up; then he fought  among the foremost and gained the victory. When he was brought to the  consul's tent covered with wounds, Cominius did all he could to show his  gratitude--set on the young man's head the crown of victory, gave him  the surname of Coriolanus in honor of his exploits, and granted him the  tenth part of the spoil of ten prisoners. Of them, however, Coriolanus  only accepted one, an old friend of the family, whom he set at liberty  at once. Afterwards, when there was a great famine in Rome, Coriolanus  led an expedition to Antium, and brought away quantities of corn and  cattle, which he distributed freely, keeping none for himself.    But though he was so free of hand, Coriolanus was a proud, shy man, who  would not make friends with the plebeians, and whom the tribunes hated  as much as he despised them. He was elected consul, and the tribunes  refused to permit him to become one; and when a shipload of wheat  arrived from Sicily, there was a fierce quarrel as to how it should be  distributed. The tribunes impeached him before the people for  withholding it from them, and by the vote of a large number of citizens  he was banished from Roman lands. His anger was great, but quiet. He  went without a word away from the Forum to his house, where he took  leave of his mother Veturia, his wife Volumnia, and his little children,  and then went and placed himself by the hearth of Tullus the Volscian  chief, in whose army he meant to fight to revenge himself upon his  countrymen.    Together they advanced upon the Roman territory, and after ravaging the  country threatened to besiege Rome. Men of rank came out and entreated  him to give up this wicked and cruel vengeance, and to have pity on his  friends and native city; but he answered that the Volscians were now his  nation, and nothing would move him. At last, however, all the women of  Rome came forth, headed by his mother Veturia and his wife Volumnia,  each with a little child, and Veturia entreated and commanded her son in  the most touching manner to change his purpose and cease to ruin his  country, begging him, if he meant to destroy Rome, to begin by slaying  her. She threw herself at his feet as she spoke, and his hard spirit  gave way.    \"Ah! mother, what is it you do?\" he cried as he lifted her up. \"Thou  hast saved Rome, but lost thy son.\"    [Illustration: ROMAN CAMP]    And so it proved, for when he had broken up his camp and returned to the  Volscian territory till the senate should recall him as they proceeded,  Tullus, angry and disappointed, stirred up a tumult, and he was killed  by the people before he could be sent for to Rome. A temple to \"Women's  Good Speed\" was raised on the spot where Veturia knelt to him.    Another very proud patrician family was the Quinctian. The father,  Lucius Quinctius, was called Cincinnatus, from his long flowing curls of  hair. He was the ablest man among the Romans, but stern and grave, and  his eldest son Kaeso was charged by the tribunes with a murder and fled  the country. Soon after there was a great inroad of the AEqui and  Volscians, and the Romans found themselves in great danger. They saw no  one could save them but Cincinnatus, so they met in haste and chose him  Dictator, though he was not present. Messengers were sent to his little  farm on the Tiber, and there they found him holding the stilts of the  plough. When they told their errand, he turned to his wife, who was  helping him, and said, \"Racilia, fetch me my toga;\" then he washed his  face and hands, and was saluted as Dictator. A boat was ready to take  him to Rome, and as he landed, he was met by the four-and-twenty lictors  belonging to the two consuls and escorted to his dwelling. In the"]]]
