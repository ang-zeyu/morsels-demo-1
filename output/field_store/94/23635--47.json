Yea, doubtless he craves only to be a king and he would  be very happy indeed.    THE SERVANT. Do not be hard, O king. Thou art ever wise and just.  This fellow is exceedingly hungry. Dost thou not command me to  fling him just one small crust from the window?    THE KING. My commands I have already given thee. See that the  beggar is driven away.    THE SERVANT. But alas! O king, if he is driven away he will  return again even as he did before.    THE KING. Then see to it that he is slain. I cannot be annoyed  with the sound of his voice.    THE SERVANT. But alas! O great and illustrious king, if he is  slain he will come to life again even as he did before.    THE KING. Ah! that is true. But his voice troubles me. I do not  like to hear it.    THE SERVANT. His lungs are fattened with hunger. Of a truth they  are quite strong.    THE KING. Well, propose a remedy to weaken them.    THE SERVANT. A remedy, O king?    (_He stops fanning._)    THE KING. That is what I said. A remedy--and do not stop fanning  me. I am exceedingly warm.    THE SERVANT (_fanning vigorously_). A crust of bread, O king,  dropped from yonder window--forsooth that might prove a remedy.    THE KING (_angrily_). I have said I will not give him a crust of  bread. If I gave him a crust to-day he would be just as hungry  again to-morrow, and my troubles would be as great as before.    THE SERVANT. That is true, O king. Thy mind is surely filled with  great learning.    THE KING. Therefore, some other remedy must be found.    THE SERVANT. O king, the words of thy illustrious mouth are as  very meat-balls of wisdom.    THE KING (_musing_). Now let me consider. Thou sayest he does not  suffer pain--    THE SERVANT. Therefore he cannot be tortured.    THE KING. And he will not die--    THE SERVANT. Therefore it is useless to kill him.    THE KING. Now let me consider. I must think of some other way.    THE SERVANT. Perhaps a small crust of bread, O king--    THE KING. Ha! I have it. I have it. I myself will order him to  stop.    THE SERVANT (_horrified_). O king!    THE KING. Send the beggar here.    THE SERVANT. O king!    THE KING. Ha! I rather fancy the fellow will stop his noise when  the king commands him to. Ha, ha, ha!    THE SERVANT. O king, thou wilt not have a beggar brought into thy  royal chamber!    THE KING (_pleased with his idea_). Yea. Go outside and tell this  fellow that the king desires his presence.    THE SERVANT. O great and illustrious king, thou wilt surely not  do this thing. Thou wilt surely not soil thy royal eyes by  looking on such a filthy creature. Thou wilt surely not  contaminate thy lips by speaking to a common beggar who cries  aloud in the streets for bread.    THE KING. My ears have been soiled too much already. Therefore go  now and do as I have commanded thee.    THE SERVANT. O great and illustrious king, thou wilt surely not--    THE KING (_roaring at him_). I said, Go! (THE SERVANT, _abashed,  goes out._) Forsooth, I fancy the fellow will stop his bawling  when I order him to. Forsooth, I fancy he will be pretty well  frightened when he hears that the king desires his presence. Ha,  ha, ha, ha!    THE SERVANT (_returning_). O king, here is the beggar.    (_A shambling creature hung in filthy rags follows_ THE SERVANT  _slowly into the royal chamber._)    THE KING. Ha! A magnificent sight, to be sure. Art thou the  beggar who has been crying aloud in the streets for bread?    THE BEGGAR (_in a faint voice, after a slight pause_). Art thou the  king?    THE KING. I am the king.    THE SERVANT (_aside to_ THE BEGGAR). It is not proper for a beggar  to ask a question of a king. Speak only as thou art spoken to.    THE KING (_to_ THE SERVANT). Do thou likewise. (_To_ THE BEGGAR) I  have ordered thee here to speak to thee concerning a very grave  matter. Thou art the beggar, I understand, who often cries aloud  in the streets for bread. Now, the complaint of thy voice annoys  me greatly. Therefore, do not beg any more.    THE BEGGAR (_faintly_). I--I do not understand.    THE KING. I said, do not beg any more.    THE BEGGAR. I--I do not understand.    THE SERVANT (_aside to_ THE BEGGAR). The king has commanded thee  not to beg for bread any more. The noise of thy voice is as  garbage in his ears.    THE KING (_to_ THE SERVANT). Ha! An excellent flower of speech. Pin  it in thy buttonhole. (_To_ THE BEGGAR) Thine ears, I see, are in  need of a bath even more than thy body. I said, _Do not beg any  more._    THE BEGGAR. I--I do not understand.    THE KING (_making a trumpet of his hands and shouting_). _DO NOT  BEG ANY MORE._    THE BEGGAR. I--I do not understand.    THE KING. Heavens! He is deafer than a stone wall.    THE SERVANT. O king, he cannot be deaf, for he understood me  quite easily when I spoke to him in the street.    THE KING (_to_ THE BEGGAR). Art thou deaf? Canst thou hear what I  am saying to thee now?    THE BEGGAR. Alas! I can hear every word perfectly.    THE KING. Fft! The impudence. Thy tongue shall be cut out for  this.    THE SERVANT. O king, to cut out his tongue is useless, for he  will grow another.    THE KING. No matter. It shall be cut out anyway. (_To_ THE BEGGAR)  I have ordered thee not to beg any more in the streets. What  meanest thou by saying thou dost not understand?    THE BEGGAR. The words of thy mouth I can hear perfectly. But  their noise is only a foolish tinkling in my ears.    THE KING. Fft! Only a--! A lash will tinkle thy hide for thee if  thou dost not cure thy tongue of impudence. I, thy king, have  ordered thee not to beg any more in the streets for bread.  Signify, therefore, that thou wilt obey the orders of thy king by  quickly touching thy forehead thrice to the floor.    THE BEGGAR. That is impossible.    THE SERVANT (_aside to_ THE BEGGAR). Come. It is not safe to tempt  the patience of the king too long. His patience is truly great,  but he loses it most wondrous quickly.    THE KING. Come, now: I have ordered thee to touch thy forehead to  the floor.    THE SERVANT (_nudging him_). And quickly.    THE BEGGAR. Wherefore should I touch my forehead to the floor?    THE KING. In order to seal thy promise to thy king.    THE BEGGAR. But I have made no promise. Neither have I any king.    THE KING. Ho! He has made no promise. Neither has he any king.  Ha, ha, ha. I have commanded thee not to beg any more, for the  sound of thy voice is grievous unto my ears. Touch thy forehead  now to the floor, as I have commanded thee, and thou shall go  from this palace a free man. Refuse, and thou wilt be sorry  before an hour that thy father ever came within twenty paces of  thy mother.    THE BEGGAR. I have ever lamented that he did. For to be born into  this world a beggar is a more unhappy thing than any that I  know--unless it is to be born a king.    THE KING. Fft! Thy tongue of a truth is too lively for thy  health. Come, now, touch thy forehead thrice to the floor and  promise solemnly that thou wilt never beg in the streets again.  And hurry!    THE SERVANT (_aside_). It is wise to do as thy king commands thee.  His patience is near an end.    THE KING. Do not be afraid to soil the floor with thy forehead. I  will graciously forgive thee for that.    (THE BEGGAR _stands motionless._)    THE SERVANT. I said, it is not wise to keep the king waiting.    (THE BEGGAR _does not move._)    THE KING. Well? (_A pause._) _Well?_ (_In a rage_) _WELL?_    THE BEGGAR. O king, thou hast commanded me not to beg in the  streets for bread, for the noise of my voice offends thee. Now  therefore do I likewise command thee to remove thy crown from thy  forehead and throw it from yonder window into the street. For  when thou hast thrown thy crown into the street, then will I no  longer be obliged to beg.    THE KING. Fft! _Thou_ commandest _me!_ _Thou_, a  beggar from the streets, commandest _me_, a king, to remove  my crown from my forehead and throw it from yonder window into  the street!    THE BEGGAR. That is what I said.    THE KING. Why, dost thou not know I can have thee slain for such  words?    THE BEGGAR. No. Thou canst not have me slain. The spears of thy  soldiers are as straws against my body.    THE KING. Ha! We shall see if they are. We shall see!    THE SERVANT. O king, it is indeed true. It is even as he has told  thee.    THE BEGGAR. I have required thee to remove thy crown from thy  forehead. If so be thou wilt throw it from yonder window into the  street, my voice will cease to annoy thee any more. But if thou  refuse, then thou wilt wish thou hadst never had any crown at  all. For thy days will be filled with a terrible boding and thy  nights will be full of horrors, even as a ship is full of rats.    THE KING. Why, this is insolence. This is treason!    THE BEGGAR. Wilt thou throw thy crown from yonder window?    THE KING. Why, this is high treason!    THE BEGGAR. I ask thee, wilt thou throw thy crown from yonder  window?    THE SERVANT (_aside to_ THE KING). Perhaps it were wise to humor  him, O king. After thou hast thrown thy crown away I can go  outside and bring it to thee again.    THE BEGGAR. Well? Well? (_He points to the window._) Well?    THE KING. No! I will not throw my crown from that window--no, nor  from any other window. What! Shall I obey the orders of a beggar?  Never!    THE BEGGAR (_preparing to leave_). Truly, that is spoken like a  king. Thou art a king, so thou wouldst prefer to lose thy head  than that silly circle of gold that so foolishly sits upon it.  But it is well. Thou art a king. Thou couldst not prefer  otherwise. (_He walks calmly toward the door._)    THE KING (_to_ THE SERVANT). Stop him! Seize him! Does he think to  get off so easily with his impudence!    THE BEGGAR (_coolly_). One of thy servants cannot stop me. Neither  can ten thousand of them do me any harm. I am stronger than a  mountain. I am stronger than the sea!    THE KING. Ha!

The irascible  Culpeper, Digby's contemporary, poured scorn on such doctors as knew not  the high science, \"Physick without astronomy being like a lamp without  Oil.\"    As for the poetry I promised--well, I have been quoting it, have I not? But  there is more, and better. Surely it was a romantic folk that kept in its  store-rooms the \"best Blew raisins of the sun,\" or \"plumpsome raisins of  the sun,\" and made its mead with dew, and eagerly exchanged with each other  recipes for \"Conserve of Red Roses.\" And now we come to an essential  feature of the whole. It is a _cuisine_ that does not reek of shops and  co-operative stores, but of the wood, the garden, the field and meadow.  Like Culpeper's pharmacopeia, it is made for the most part of \"Such Things  only as grow in England, they being most fit for English Bodies.\" Is it any  wonder that the metheglin should be called the \"Liquor of Life,\" which has  these among its ingredients: Bugloss, borage, hyssop, organ,  sweet-marjoram, rosemary, French cowslip, coltsfoot, thyme, burnet,  self-heal, sanicle, betony, blew-button, harts-tongue, meadowsweet,  liverwort, bistort, St. John's wort, yellow saunders, balm, bugle,  agrimony, tormentilla, comfrey, fennel, clown's allheal, maidenhair,  wall-rue, spleen-wort, sweet oak, Paul's betony, and mouse-ear?    The housewife of to-day buys unrecognisable dried herbs in packets or  bottles. In those days she gathered them in their season out of doors. The  companions to _The Closet Opened_ should be the hasty and entertaining  Culpeper, the genial Gerard, and Coles of the delightful _Adam in Eden_,  all the old herbals that were on Digby's bookshelves, so full of  absurdities, so full of pretty wisdom. They will tell you how to mix in  your liquor eglantine for coolness, borage, rosemary, and sweet-marjoram  for vigour, and by which planet each herb or flower is governed. Has our  sentiment for the flowers of the field increased now we no longer drink  their essence, or use them in our dishes? I doubt it. It is surely a  pardonable grossness that we should desire the sweet fresh things to become  part of us--like children, who do indeed love flowers, and eat them. In the  Appendix I have transcribed a list of the plants referred to. Most cooks  would be unable to tell one from another; and even modern herbalists have  let many fall out of use, while only a few are on the lists of the English  pharmacopeia. To go simpling once more by field and wood and hedgerow would  be a pleasant duty for country housewives to impose upon themselves; and as  to the herbalists' observations on their virtues, we may say with old  Coles, \"Most of them I am confident are true, and if there be any that are  not so, yet they are pleasant.\"    There is an air of flippancy about that reflexion of Coles you will never  find in Sir Kenelm. Of the virtues of each plant and flower he used he was  fully convinced; and when he tells of their powers, as in his \"Aqua  Mirabilis,\" the tale is like a solemn litany, and we are reminded of  Clarendon's testimony to \"the gravity of his motion.\" And so, his Closet  once more open, he stands at the door, his majesty not greatly lessened;  for the book contains a reminiscence of his rolling eloquence, something  of his romance, and not a little of his poetry.

[_Facsimile of the original title-page._]                TO THE READER      This Collection full of pleasing variety, and of such usefulness in the  Generality of it, to the Publique, coming to my hands, I should, had I  forborn the Publication thereof, have trespassed in a very considerable  concern upon my Countrey-men, The like having not in every particular  appeared in Print in the English tongue. There needs no Rhetoricating  Floscules to set it off. The Authour, as is well known, having been a  Person of Eminency for his Learning, and of Exquisite Curiosity in his  Researches, Even that Incomparable Sir Kenelme Digbie Knight, Fellow of the  Royal Society and Chancellour to the Queen Mother, (Et omen in Nomine) His  name does sufficiently Auspicate the Work. I shall only therefore add, That  there is herein (as by the Table hereunto affix'd will evidently to thee  appear) a sufficiency of Solids as well as Liquids for the sating the  Curiosities of each or the nicest Palate; and according to that old Saw in  the Regiment of Health, Incipe cum Liquido, &c. The Liquids premitted to  the Solids. These being so Excellent in their kinde, so beneficial and so  well ordered, I think it unhandsome, if not injurious, by the trouble of  any further Discourse, to detain thee any longer from falling to; Fall to  therefore, and much good may it do thee,    FARE-WELL.      A RECEIPT TO MAKE METHEGLIN AS IT IS MADE AT LIEGE, COMMUNICATED BY MR.  MASILLON    Take one Measure of Honey, and three Measures of Water, and let it boil  till one measure be boiled away, so that there be left three measures in  all; as for Example, take to one Pot of Honey, three Pots of Water, and let  it boil so long, till it come to three Pots. During which time you must  Skim it very well as soon as any scum riseth; which you are to continue  till there rise no scum more. You may, if you please, put to it some spice,  to wit, Cloves and Ginger; the quantity of which is to be proportioned  according as you will have your Meath, strong or weak. But this you do  before it begin to boil. There are some that put either Yeast of Beer, or  Leaven of bread into it, to make it work. But this is not necessary at all;  and much less to set it into the Sun. Mr. Masillon doth neither the one nor  the other. Afterwards for to Tun it, you must let it grow Luke-warm, for to  advance it. And if you do intend to keep your Meathe a long time, you may  put into it some hopps on this fashion. Take to every Barrel of Meathe a  Pound of Hops without leaves, that is, of Ordinary Hops used for Beer, but  well cleansed, taking only the Flowers, without the Green-leaves and  stalks. Boil this pound of Hops in a Pot and half of fair water, till it  come to one Pot, and this quantity is sufficient for a Barrel of Meathe. A  Barrel at Liege holdeth ninety Pots, and a Pot is as much as a Wine quart  in England. (I have since been informed from Liege, that a Pot of that  Countrey holdeth 48 Ounces of Apothecary's measure; which I judge to be a  Pottle according to London measure, or two Wine-quarts.) When you Tun your  Meath, you must not fill your Barrel by half a foot, that so it may have  room to work. Then let it stand six weeks slightly stopped; which being  expired, if the Meath do not work, stop it up very close. Yet must you not  fill up the Barrel to the very brim. After six Months you draw off the  clear into another Barrel, or strong Bottles, leaving the dregs, and  filling up your new Barrel, or Bottels, and stopping it or them very close.    The Meath that is made this way, (_Viz._ In the Spring, in the Month of  April or May, which is the proper time for making of it,) will keep many a  year.      WHITE METHEGLIN OF MY LADY HUNGERFORD: WHICH IS EXCEEDINGLY PRAISED    Take your Honey, and mix it with fair water, until the Honey be quite  dissolved. If it will bear an Egge to be above the liquor, the breadth of a  groat, it is strong enough; if not, put more Honey to it, till it be so  strong; Then boil it, till it be clearly and well skimmed; Then put in one  good handful of Strawberry-leaves, and half a handful of Violet leaves; and  half as much Sorrel: a Douzen tops of Rosemary; four or five tops of  Baulme-leaves: a handful of Harts-tongue, and a handful of Liver-worth; a  little Thyme, and a little Red-sage; Let it boil about an hour; then put it  into a Woodden Vessel, where let it stand, till it be quite cold; Then put  it into the Barrel; Then take half an Ounce of Cloves, as much Nutmeg; four  or five Races of Ginger; bruise it, and put it into a fine bag, with a  stone to make it sink, that it may hang below the middle: Then stop it very  close.    The Herbs and Spices are in proportion for six Gallons.    Since my Lady Hungerford sent me this Receipt, she sent me word, that she  now useth (and liketh better) to make the Decoction of Herbs before you put  the Honey to it, This Proportion of Herbs is to make six Gallons of  Decoction, so that you may take eight or nine Gallons of water. When you  have drawn out into your water, all the vertue of the Herbs, throw them  away, and take the clear Decoction (leaving the settlings) and when it is  Lukewarm, Dissolve your proportion of Honey in it. After it is well  dissolved and laved with strong Arms or woodden Instruments, like  Battle-doors or Scoops, boil it gently; till you have taken away all the  scum; then make an end of well boyling it, about an hour in all. Then pour  it into a wooden vessel, and let it stand till it be cold. Then pour the  clear through a Sieve of hair, ceasing pouring when you come to the foul  thick settling. Tun"]]]
