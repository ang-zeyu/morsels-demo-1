The system does not appear to be advantageous to the increase of  population: the wives of these birds of passage hardly bear two children  a-piece. Indeed there are very few children in Tintalous. We have not  yet sufficient data or experience for a conclusion on this part of  statistics; but, up to the present, all that we have seen in Africa  during this journey exhibits it as singularly miserable and destitute of  population. We can hear of no man, not even a sultan with his fifty  female slaves, having more than four or five children. As for the poor,  one or two are all that they can bring up.    Whence, then, comes the supply of slaves? So far as this part of Africa  is concerned I may observe, in reply, that the annual number of slaves  brought is exceedingly limited, amounting only to a few thousands. When  we get nearer the western coast, we shall probably be able to account  for the supplies of slaves which are transported across the Atlantic.    This afternoon a well was commenced near our tents. The digging of a  well is an important matter; his highness En-Noor, therefore, vouchsafed  his presence. A number of the excavators came to me to beg for sugar. I  brought out a piece of white loaf sugar, and broke it into thirty pieces  or so; then ordered one of them to divide it fairly amongst themselves:  but this was impossible. Anything like fairness amongst the Kailouees,  all of whom are addicted to thieving (a habit acquired from Soudan), was  out of the question. As soon as I rose from the ground, after breaking  the sugar on a leathern apron, there was a general rush upon it, and  some got a great deal and others none. Was not this a fine miniature  picture of mankind?    _24th._--En-Noor paid me a very early visit, and drank coffee. I heard  that a courier to Mourzuk would cost forty dollars. I begin to learn a  little Soudanese; there are some beautiful soft words in it. Yusuf says  there is no name for God in this language; but his statement requires  further examination.    From what we learn respecting Barth's reception at Aghadez, it would  appear that the people were disposed to look upon him with the same  complacency as they are wont to regard the pagans, or En-sara as they  call them, of Gouber and Maradee. Indeed, the Tanelkums and Kailouees  consider that we shall be well received by our brethren, the pagans of  Soudan.    Here is a most extraordinary trait of the barbarity of the Tibboos. It  often happens that they are out foraging for twenty days without finding  anything to eat. If they light upon the bones of a dead camel, they take  them and pound them to dust; this done, they bleed their own living  camels (maharees) from the eye, and of the blood and powdered bones they  make a paste, which they eat! This is somewhat analogous to what Bruce  relates of the Abyssinians cutting out beefsteaks from the rump of a  live bullock. The Tibboos possess the finest maharees; and the breed in  the rest of the Sahara is always being improved or kept up by a constant  supply from their country.    I continue to supply his highness En-Noor with either tea or coffee  every day. I sent him some early this morning. He is a greedy old dog,  and will not buy a loaf of sugar because I will not give it him at the  price of Mourzuk, and thus lose the freight. I hold out, and we have  sold him none for the present.    Overweg is making a small commercial lexicon of the things brought to  the market of Kanou: a most excellent idea. I myself intend, if I go to  Kanou, to make a list of all the things I find in the Souk, with some  account of their produce and mode of importation into that mart.    The great gong sounded throughout the village this afternoon, to give  note of preparation to all the people, that every one of the males must  be ready to leave this place in the course of three or four days. The  Sheikh says he is determined to leave in three days, whether the people  come from Aghadez or not. Yusuf laid before En-Noor this evening the  necessity of our sending a courier to Mourzuk, stating that we had  nothing left. His highness pitied our case, and said he would look about  for a courier; observing, \"The Consul has need of much money and many  presents in Soudan.\" He said, also, that he would recommend us to go to  Bornou.    _25th._--The days are now pretty hot, and the nights correspondingly  cool. We have a good deal of wind. I wrote a letter to Drs. Overweg and  Barth jointly, calling upon them to assist me in case the Sfaxee would  not wait for his money until the return of the courier. Dr. Overweg  consents. I wrote out the Tuarick alphabet.    The account of the Tibboos pounding the camels' bones and bleeding their  animals to make paste, is confirmed by the Gatronee of the Germans.[4]  He says, moreover, that this is the way in which they proceed. Every  Tibboo must fast three days before he thinks about eating. If on the  fourth day he do not arrive at the _belad_, or country, he then takes  his left sandal from his foot, and stews or soddens it, making something  of a soup. These sandals being leather, or untanned hide, it is,  perhaps, not impossible to make of them a palatable soup! If on the  fifth day he find no village, he then devours the sandal of his right  foot. After this, still not finding a village, he collects bleached  camels' bones and bleeds his camel as before mentioned.      [4] People are called here by the nation, and even town, to        which they belong, or in which they were born, as sometimes        in Europe.    A Tibboo always has a girdle with seven knots, and when travelling hard  takes in, as the sailors would say, a reef every day; if after seven  days he find nothing to eat, he is considered hungry and unfortunate.  The three Tuaricks who followed us from the well of Aisou declared that  they had had nothing to eat for fifteen days; and there cannot be a  doubt of the fact, that both the Tibboos and the Tuaricks can, on a  pinch, remain without food for a considerable time--say ten or twelve  days.    A Tuatee, who knows Algiers well, arrived here this afternoon, and is  going with us to Zinder. He brings an extraordinary report about the  copy of the treaty which I left with Haj Ahmed at Ghat. He says he heard  it read, and from it learned that \"the Queen of England is now in  Tripoli, and wishes to come and live in Ghat, and has offered to buy  half Ghat.\" Such is the nature of Saharan reports.    More authentic intelligence arrived to-day by a courier, who made the  journey from Ghat to Seloufeeat in fourteen days--sufficiently quick.  This courier brings a warning from Khanouhen to the caravans now  proceeding to Ghat, not to come in twos or threes, as they were wont,  but to come altogether, as he fears reprisals from the Shanbah and the  Haghar.    The history of the thing is this:--A tribe of Tuaricks has always acted  as the guides of the Shanbah in their foraging parties--on the Tuarick  territory, for example--always pointing out to them the camels of the  people of Ghat. Khanouhen has chastised this treacherous tribe,  destroying a great many of them; but the Shanbah and Haghar not choosing  to desert their old friends, have determined to take vengeance upon the  Ghat Tuaricks. It is this revenge which Khanouhen fears. He anticipates  a combined attack on the caravans. The wonder is how these routes are  kept open at all, when these distant tribes, who have no interest in the  commerce that moves along them, are notorious for their predatory  feelings and education. It is now said that the Fadeea, our friends on  the frontier, are in league with the Shanbah against the Ghat Tuaricks.    En-Noor, it appears, had sent his son to salute the new Sultan of  Aghadez, and to assist in establishing or placing him on his throne. He  got as far as Asoudee, when he fell in love with a pretty woman of the  town, and at once married her, proceeding no farther on his mission.  Yesterday evening a man arrived mounted on a maharee, bringing with him  all the finery of the bride, which he exhibited to the people, riding  about the town! All were greatly astonished at the splendour of the  bride's dowry. Are not these fit materials for an Arabian Night's  entertainment? My servant, Said, also married the other evening, but not  so romantically; taking up with the divorced wife of another freed  black. I heard nothing of it until all was over. The parties guessed  rightly that I should take no interest in the matter, or rather  disapprove of it, as the fellow has abandoned his own and natural wife.  This divorced negress, who has at last found a master, has gone the  round of all the tents since she has parted from her former husband, and  is a little intriguing wretch. The Sfaxee and Yusuf countenanced the  affair, but kept it quite unknown to me. They, however, fetched Overweg,  and presented him with a portion of the marriage-supper--bazeen. I felt  much disgusted on hearing of the affair. The old wife is a native of  Kanemboo, and is going thither. She will, of course, gladly take leave  of her husband and this young wife and rival. Marriage is an excessively  loose tie here, at any rate amongst the poor. The rich pretend to  respect marriage.    We have all done little in clearing up difficulties, or obtaining  correct information of the Tuaricks of the Sahara. No good informants  are to be found. From the Sheikhs of Ghat it is quite impossible to  learn anything. We hope to get some information from a Tanelkum now  going with us. Many tribes have been mentioned, casually; but the  principal are--the three great tribes of Ghat, those to which Khanouhen,  Shafou, Jabour, and Hateetah belong--a tribe in Janet--the Haghar of  Ghamama--the Isokamara, located on the Tuat route from Aisou--the  Tanelkums of Fezaan--the Maraga, a breed produced from the slaves of the  Haghar and the Sorgou of Timbuctoo.    _26th._--"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18556"],[0,"Catalogue of Violent and Destructive Earthquakes in the Philippines (#8)"],[1,"   |                    |     |of about 300 kilometers.      |                    |     |  ----+--------------------+-----+------------------------------------------  No. |       Date.        |Intensity.      |                    |     |       Epicenter and effects.  ----+--------------------+-----+------------------------------------------      | _Y.
