But, in the etudes I mentioned a  moment ago, there are melodies which, I should think, would tempt even  angels to leave their happy home and indulge, for a moment, in the  luxury of idealized human sorrow. There is in these twenty-seven  etudes, as in the twenty-five preludes, an inexhaustible wealth of  melody, modulation, poetry and passion. One can play them every day  and never tire of them. Of most of them one might say what Schumann  said of one--that they are \"poems rather than studies;\" and much  surprise has been expressed that Chopin should have chosen such a  modest and apparently inappropriate name for them as \"studies.\" Now, I  have a theory on this subject: I believe it was partly an ironic  intention which induced Chopin to call some of his most inspired  pieces \"studies.\" Pianists have always been too much in the habit of  looking at their art from purely technical or mechanical points of  view. They looked for mere five-finger exercises in Chopin's etudes,  and finding at the same time an abundance of musical ideas, they were  surprised. It did not occur to them that Chopin might have intended  them also as studies in musical composition--studies in melody,  harmony, rhythm and emotional expression. I believe he did so intend  them; and finding that his contemporaries did not take his idea, he  probably laughed in his sleeve, and exclaimed, \"_O tempora!_\"    This conjecture seems the more plausible, from the fact that there was  a pronounced ironic and comic vein in Chopin's character. The accounts  of his melancholy, in fact, like those of his ill-health, have been  too much exaggerated. He was often in a cheerful mood. Sometimes he  would amuse himself for a whole evening playing blind-man's buff with  the children. As a mere child he had formed the habit of mimicking and  caricaturing pianists and other distinguished men. Liszt often  suffered from this mischievous habit, but he did not complain, and  even seemed to enjoy it. Of Chopin's wit, two specimens may be cited.  A rich Parisian one day invited him to dinner, with the intention of  getting him to entertain the guests afterward. In this case, however,  the host had reckoned without the guest, for, when asked to play,  Chopin exclaimed, \"But, my dear sir, I have eaten so little.\" The  other instance occurs in one of his letters, where he says of the  pianist Aloys Schmitt, that he was forty years old, and his  compositions eighty--a _bon mot_ worthy of Heine.    There was much, indeed, in common between Chopin and Heine. Nothing is  more characteristic of Heine than the way in which he works up our  sentimental feelings only to knock us on the head with a comic or  grotesque line at the end. Similarly, Chopin, after improvising for  his friends for an hour or two, would suddenly rouse them from their  reveries by a _glissando_--sliding his fingers from one end of the  key-board to the other. In almost all of Chopin's or Heine's poems  there is this peculiar mixture of the sad and the comic veins--even  in the scherzos, which represent the gay and cheerful moods of  Chopin's muse.    Another point between these two poets is their elegance of style, and  their ironic abhorrence of tawdry sentimentality and commonplace.  Heine is the most elegant and graceful writer of his country, and  Chopin the most elegant and graceful of all composers. Not a redundant  note or a meaningless bar in all his compositions. Heine owed his  formal finish to French influences, but Chopin did not need them, for  the Poles are as noted as the French for elegance and grace. He  avoided not only the modulatory monotony of the classical school, but,  especially, the commonplace endings which marred so many classical  compositions. \"All's well that ends well,\" is a rule that was  generally ignored by composers till Chopin taught them its value and  effect. Chopin's pen always stopped when his thoughts stopped, and he  never appends a meaningless end formula as if to warn the audience  that they may now put on their hats. On the contrary, some of his  later compositions, especially of the last period, end with exquisite  miniature poems, connected in spirit with the preceding music and yet  distinct--separate inspirations. I refer, especially, to the endings  of his last two nocturnes and to the final bars of the mazurka, opus  59, No. 3.    George Sand has given us a vivid sketch of Chopin's conscientiousness  as a composer. \"He shut himself up in his room for entire days,\" she  says, \"weeping, walking about, breaking his pen, repeating and  changing a bar a hundred times, and beginning again next day with  minute and desperate perseverance. He spent six weeks over a single  page, only to go back and write that which he had traced at the first  essay.\" As regards his creativeness, George Sand says that \"it  descended upon his piano suddenly, completely, sublimely, or it sang  itself in his head during his walks, and he made haste to hear it by  rushing to the instrument.\" I have already mentioned the fact that  when he wrote his last mazurka he was too weak to try it on the piano.  In one of his letters he speaks of a polonaise being ready in his  head. These facts indicate that he composed mentally, although, no  doubt, during the improvisations, many themes occurred to him which he  remembered and utilized. When he improvised he did not watch the  key-board, but generally looked at the ceiling. Already as a youth he  used to be so absorbed that he forgot his meals; and, in the street,  he was often so absent-minded that he very narrowly escaped being run  over by a wagon. Visions of female loveliness and patriotic  reminiscences inspired many of his best works. Sometimes the pictures  in his mind became so vivid as to form real hallucinations. Thus it  is related that one evening when he was alone in the dark, trying over  the A major polonaise which he had just completed, he saw the door  open and in marched a procession of Polish knights and ladies in  mediaeval costumes--the same, no doubt, that his imagination had  pictured while he was composing. He was so alarmed at this vision that  he fled through the opposite door and did not venture to return.  Another illustration of the relations between genius and insanity.    The foregoing remarks on Chopin's compositions suffice, I think, to  show how absurd is the prevalent notion that he is the composer for  the drawing-room, and that his pieces reflect the spirit of  fashionable Parisian society. They do, perhaps, in their elegant form,  but certainly not in their spirit. The frivolous aristocratic circles  that heard Chopin could never have comprehended the depth of his  emotional life. The pianists for them, the real drawing-room composers  were Kalkbrenner, and Field, and Thalberg, with their operatic  fantasias. Chopin is the composer for the few, and he is the composer  _par excellence_ for musicians. From him they can get more ideas, and  learn more as regards form, than from anyone else, except Bach and  Wagner. In comparing his last works with his first, and noting their  progress, the mind tries in vain to conceive where he would have led  the world had he lived eighty instead of forty years. One thing is  certain: he would have probably written more for other instruments.  His pianoforte concertos belong to his early period, and betray a lack  of experience in the treatment of the orchestra. But he wrote two  pieces of chamber music which have never been excelled--a 'cello  sonata and a trio. The 'cello sonata was the last of his larger works,  and in my opinion it is superior to any of the 'cello sonatas of  Mendelssohn, Brahms, and even Beethoven and Rubinstein. The trio,  though an earlier work, is, like the 'cello sonata, admirably adapted  to the instruments for which it is written. I once belonged to an  amateur trio club. Our tastes naturally differed on many points, but  in one thing we all agreed: we always closed our entertainment with  this Chopin trio. It was the climax of the evening's enjoyment. Yet,  only a few years ago, the leader of one of the principal chamber music  organizations in New York admitted to me that he had never heard of  this trio!--an incident which vividly illustrates the truth of my  assertion that Chopin's genius is still far from being esteemed at its  full value.          II    HOW COMPOSERS WORK      Forty years ago Robert Schumann complained that the musical critics  had so much to say about singers and players, while the composer was  almost entirely ignored. To-day this reproach could hardly be made,  for although vocalists still receive perhaps a disproportionate share  of attention, compositions, new and old, are also discussed at great  length in the press. Nevertheless, I believe that the vast majority of  those who attend an operatic performance in New York, and are  delighted with \"Siegfried\" or \"Faust,\" have but vague and shadowy  notions as to the way in which such an opera is composed. My object  here is to illustrate the way composers work, and to prove that the  creating of an opera is perhaps the most difficult and marvellous  achievement of the human intellect.    Professor Langhans notes, in his history of music, that in the Middle  Ages, as late as Luther's time, it took two men to compose the  simplest piece of music: one who conceived the melody, and the other  who added the harmonic accompaniment. The theoretical writer,  Glareanus, deliberately expressed his opinion, in 1547, that it might  be _possible_ to unite these two functions in one person, but that one  would rarely find the inventor of a melody able to work it out  artistically. We have made much progress in music within these three  hundred years, and to-day every composer is not only expected to  invent his own harmonies and accompaniments to his melodies, but,  since Wagner set the example,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18564"],[0,"The Religion of Ancient Rome (#8)"],[1,", when his religion was one of fear, he  regarded the dead as normally hostile, and their presence as something  to be averted; this is the stage which gave birth to the Lemuria. As  civilisation increased, and the sense of the unity of household and  community developed, fear, proving ungrounded, gave place to a kindlier  feeling of the continued existence of the dead as members of household  and state, and even in some sense as an additional bond between the  living: this is the period which produced the _sacra privata_ and the  Parentalia. When the _numen_-feeling began to pass into that of _deus_,  in the first place a connection was felt between the spirits of the  dead and the deities of the earth associated with the growth of the  crops, in the second the notion that the underworld must have its gods  as well as the world above, produced the shadowy female deities and  Vediovis. Lastly, the same kind of feeling which added Parentalia to  Lemuria developed the vague general notion of the Di Manes, not the  deified spirits of the dead, but peaceful and on the whole kindly  divinities holding sway in the world of dead spirits, yet accessible to  the prayers of the living. The dead, then, were not themselves  worshipped, but they needed commemoration and kindly gifts, and they  had in their lower world deities to whom prayer might be made and  worship given.    FOOTNOTES:    [5] It is right to state that there is a totally different theory,  according to which the Lares were the spirits of the dead ancestors and  the Lar Familiaris an embodiment, as it were, of all the family dead.    [6] It is significant that even when the dead were cremated, one bone  was carefully preserved in order to be symbolically buried.    [7] We may note that, though it is a state festival, our information is  solely of rites in individual households.    [8] Their mention in sepulchral inscriptions dates from the time of the  Empire, when a new conception of their nature had sprung up.          CHAPTER VI    WORSHIP OF THE FIELDS      The life of the early Roman in the fields, his activities, his hopes  and fears, are reflected in the long list of agricultural festivals  which constitute the greater part of the celebrations in the Calendar,  and follow closely the seasons and occupations of the agricultural  year. We are, of course, in the Calendar dealing, to speak strictly,  with the worship of the state, and not with the semi-private festivals  of groups of farmers, but in many instances, such as the Robigalia, the  state seems only to have taken over the cult of the farmers, preserving  carefully the site on which the celebration took place; in others, such  as the Terminalia and the Parilia, it seems to have established, as it  were, a state-counterpart of a rite performed independently at many  rustic centres: in both cases we are justified in inferring the  practice of the early Roman agriculturalist. We shall see that in most  cases these festivals are associated--though often loosely  enough--with the worship of a particular divinity. Sometimes,  however,--as in the case of the Lupercalia--it is very difficult to  discover who this divinity was; in other festivals, such as the  Robigalia, it looks as if the eponymous deity was a comparatively late  development. We may, therefore, suppose, on the analogy of what we have  already seen to be the general lines of development in Roman religion,  that the festivals in origin centred round a purpose rather than a  personality, and were addressed 'to all spirits whom it might concern';  and that later, when the _deus_ notion was on the increase, they either  attached themselves to some god whose personality was already distinct,  as the Vinalia were attached to Iuppiter, or 'developed' a deity of  their own. Among these deities, strictly functional as a rule and  existing only in connection with their special festival, we shall  notice the frequent recurrence of a divinity pair, not, of course,  mythologically related as husband and wife, but representing, perhaps,  the male and female aspects of the same process of development.    The festivals divide themselves naturally into three groups: those of  Spring, expressive of the hopes and fears for the growing crops and  herds; those of Summer, the festivals of fulfilment, including the  celebration of harvest; and those of Winter, the festivals of sowing,  of social rejoicing, and in the later months of purificatory  anticipation of the coming year.    =1. Festivals of Spring.=--The old Roman year--as may be seen clearly  enough from the names of the months still known by numbers, September,  October, etc.--began in March: according to tradition Romulus reckoned  a year of ten months altogether, and Numa added January and February.  The Spring months properly speaking may be reckoned as March, April,  and May. In March there were in the developed Calendar no festivals of  an immediately recognisable agricultural character, but the whole month  was practically consecrated to its eponymous deity, Mars. Now, to the  Roman of the Republic, Mars was undoubtedly the deity associated with  war, and his special festivals in this month are of a warlike  character: on the 9th the priests (_Salii_) began the ancient custom of  carrying his sacred shields (_ancilia_) round the town from one  ordained resting-place to another: on the 19th, Quinquatrus, the  shields were solemnly purified, and on the 23rd the same ceremony was  performed with the war-trumpets: the Equirria (horse-races) of March  14 may have had an agricultural origin--we shall meet with races later  on as a feature of rustic festivals--but they were certainly celebrated  in a military manner. Yet there is good reason for believing that Mars  was in origin associated not with war, but with the growth of  vegetation: he was, as we shall see, the chief deity addressed in the  solemn lustration of the fields (_Ambarvalia_), and if our general  notion of the development of religion with the growing needs of the  agricultural community crystallising into a state be correct, it may  well be that a deity originally concerned with the interests of the  farmer took on himself the protection of the soldier, when the fully  developed state came into collision with its neighbours. If so, we may  well have in these recurring festivals of Mars the sense, as Mr. Warde  Fowler has put it, of 'some great _numen_ at work, quickening  vegetation, and calling into life the powers of reproduction in man and  the animals.' Possibly another agricultural note is struck in the  Liberalia of the 17th: though the cult of Liber was almost entirely  overlaid by his subsequent identification with Dionysus, it seems right  to recognise in him and his female counterpart, Libera, a general  spirit of creativeness.    The character of April is much more clearly marked: the month is filled  with a series of festivals--all of a clearly agricultural  nature--prayers for the crops now in the earth, and the purification of  the men and animals on the farm. The series opens with the Fordicidia  on the 15th, when pregnant cows were sacrificed: their unborn calves  were torn from them and burnt, the ashes being kept by the Vestal  Virgin in Vesta's storehouse (_penus Vestae_) for use at the Parilia.  The general symbolism of fertility is very clear; the goddess  associated with the festival is Tellus, the earth herself, and the  local origin of these festivals is shown in the fact that not only was  the sacrifice made for the whole people on the Capitol, but separately  in each one of the _curiae_. The Fordicidia is closely followed by the  Cerealia on the 19th--the festival of another earth-goddess (_Ceres_,  _creare_)--more especially connected with the growth of corn. A very  curious feature of the ritual was the fastening of fire-brands to the  tails of foxes, which were then let loose in what was afterwards the  Circus Maximus: a symbol possibly, as Wissowa thinks, of sunlight,  possibly of the vegetation-spirit. But the most important of the April  ceremonies is undoubtedly the Parilia of the 21st, the festival of the  very ancient rustic _numen_, Pales. Ovid's[9] description of the  celebration is so interesting and so full of the characteristic colour  of the Roman rustic festivals that I may perhaps be pardoned for  reproducing it at greater length. 'Shepherd,' he says, addressing the  rustic worshipper, 'at the first streak of dawn purify thy well-fed  flocks: let water first besprinkle them, and a branch sweep clean the  ground. Let the folds be adorned with leaves and branches fastened to  them, while a trailing wreath covers the gay-decked gates. Let blue  flames rise from the living sulphur and the sheep bleat loud as she  feels the touch of the smoking sulphur. Burn the male olive-branch and  the pine twig and juniper, and let the blazing laurel crackle amid the  hearth. A basket full of millet must go with the millet cakes: this is  the food wherein the country goddess finds pleasure most of all. Give  her too her own share of the feast and her pail of milk, and when her  share has been set aside, then with milk warm from the cow make prayer  to Pales, guardian of the woods.' The poet then recites a long prayer,  in which the farmer first begs forgiveness for any unwitting sins he  may have committed against the rustic deities, such as trespassing on  their groves or sheltering his flocks beneath their altar, and then  prays for the aversion of disease and the prosperity of crops, flocks,  and herds. 'Thus must the goddess be won, this prayer say four times  turning to the sunrise, and wash thy hands in the running stream. Then  set the rustic bowl upon the table in place of the wine-bowl, and drink  the snowy milk and dark must, and soon through the heaps of crackling  straw leap in swift course with eager limbs.' All the worshippers then  set to leaping through the blazing fires, even the flocks"]]]
