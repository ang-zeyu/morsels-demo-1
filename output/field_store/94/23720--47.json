Still resting her elbows upon the table and bending down between us,  Zarmi turned her slumbering, half-closed black eyes again upon me,  then slowly, languishingly, upon Fletcher. She replaced the yellow  cigarette between her lips. He continued to toy with the ear-ring.    Suddenly the girl sprang upright, and from its hiding-place within  the silken scarf, plucked out a Malay _kris_ with a richly jeweled  hilt. Her eyes now widely opened and blazing, she struck at my  companion!    I half rose from my chair, stifling a cry of horror; but Fletcher,  regarding her fixedly, never moved ... and Zarmi stayed her hand just  as the point of the dagger had reached his throat!    \"You see,\" she whispered softly but intensely, \"how soon I can kill  you.\"    Ere I had overcome the amazement and horror with which her action  had filled me, she had suddenly clutched me by the shoulder, and,  turning from Fletcher, had the point of the _kris_ at _my_ throat!    \"You, too!\" she whispered, \"you too!\"    Lower and lower she bent, the needle point of the weapon pricking my  skin, until her beautiful, evil face almost touched mine. Then,  miraculously, the fire died out of her eyes; they half closed again  and became languishing, luresome _Ghazeeyeh_ eyes. She laughed softly,  wickedly, and puffed cigarette smoke into my face.    Thrusting her dagger into her waist-belt, and snatching up the brass  tray, she swayed down the room, chanting some barbaric song in her  husky Eastern voice.    I inhaled deeply and glanced across at my companion. Beneath the  make-up with which I had stained my skin, I knew that I had grown  more than a little pale.    \"Fletcher!\" I whispered, \"we are on the eve of a great discovery--that  girl ...\"    I broke off, and clutching the table with both hands, sat listening  intently. From the room behind me, the opium-room, whose entrance was  less than two paces from where we sat, came a sound of dragging and  tapping! Slowly, cautiously, I began to turn my head; when a sudden  outburst of simian chattering from the _fan-tan_ players drowned that  other sinister sound.    \"You heard it, Doctor!\" hissed Fletcher.    \"The man with the limp!\" I said hoarsely; \"he is in there! Fletcher!  I am utterly confused. I believe this place to hold the key to the  whole mystery, I believe ...\"    Fletcher gave me a warning glance--and, turning anew, I saw Zarmi  approaching with her sinuous gait, carrying two glasses and jug upon  the ornate tray. These she set down upon the table; then stood  spinning the salver cleverly upon the point of her index finger and  watching us through half-closed eyes.    My companion took out some loose coins, but the girl thrust the  proffered payment aside with her disengaged hand, the salver still  whirling upon the upraised finger of the other.    \"Presently you pay for drink,\" she said. \"You do something for me--eh?\"    \"Yep,\" replied Fletcher nonchalantly, watering the rum in the  tumblers. \"What time?\"    \"Presently I tell you. You stay here. This one a strong feller?\"--  indicating myself.    \"Sure,\" drawled Fletcher; \"strong as a mule he is.\"    \"All right. I give him one little kiss if he good boy!\"    Tossing the tray in the air she caught it, rested its edge upon her  hip, turned, and walked away down the room, puffing her cigarette.    \"Listen,\" I said, bending across the table, \"it was Zarmi who drove  the cab that came for Nayland Smith to-day!\"    \"My God!\" whispered Fletcher, \"then it was nothing less than the hand  of Providence that brought us here to-night. Yes! I know how you feel,  Doctor!--but we must play our cards as they're dealt to us. We must  wait--wait.\"    Out from the den of the opium-smokers came Zarmi, one hand resting  upon her hip and the other uplifted, a smoldering yellow cigarette  held between the first and second fingers. With a movement of her  eyes she summoned us to join her, then turned and disappeared again  through the low doorway.    The time for action was arrived--we were to see behind the scenes of  the Joy-Shop! Our chance to revenge poor Smith even if we could not  save him. I became conscious of an inward and suppressed excitement;  surreptitiously I felt the hilt of the Browning pistol in my pocket.  The shadow of the dead Fu-Manchu seemed to be upon me. God! how I  loathed and feared that memory!    \"We can make no plans,\" I whispered to Fletcher, as together we rose  from the table; \"we must be guided by circumstance.\"    In order to enter the little room laden with those sickly opium fumes  we had to lower our heads. Two steps led down into the place, which  was so dark that I hesitated, momentarily, peering about me.    Apparently some four of five persons squatted and lay in the darkness  about me. Some were couched upon rough wooden shelves ranged around  the walls, others sprawled upon the floor, in the center whereof, upon  a small tea-chest, stood a smoky brass lamp. The room and its  occupants alike were indeterminate, sketchy; its deadly atmosphere  seemed to be suffocating me. A sort of choking sound came from one of  the bunks; a vague, obscene murmuring filled the whole place  revoltingly.    Zarmi stood at the further end, her lithe figure silhouetted against  the vague light coming through an open doorway. I saw her raise her  hand, beckoning to us.    Circling around the chest supporting the lamp we crossed the foul  den and found ourselves in a narrow, dim passage-way, but in cleaner  air.    \"Come,\" said Zarmi, extending her long, slim hand to me.    I took it, solely for guidance in the gloom, and she immediately drew  my arm about her waist, leant back against my shoulder and, raising  her pouted red lips, blew a cloud of tobacco smoke fully into my eyes!    Momentarily blinded, I drew back with a muttered exclamation.  Suspecting what I did of this tigerish half-caste, I could almost have  found it in my heart to return her savage pleasantries with interest.    As I raised my hands to my burning eyes, Fletcher uttered a sharp cry  of pain. I turned in time to see the girl touch him lightly on the  neck with the burning tip of her cigarette.    \"You jealous, eh, Charlie?\" she said. \"But I love you, too--see! Come  along, you strong fellers....\"    And away she went along the passage, swaying her hips lithely and  glancing back over her shoulders in smiling coquetry.    Tears were still streaming from my eyes when I found myself standing  in a sort of rough shed, stone-paved, and containing a variety of  nondescript rubbish. A lantern stood upon the floor; and beside it ...    The place seemed to be swimming around me, the stone floor to be  heaving beneath my feet....    Beside the lantern stood a wooden chest, some six feet long, and  having strong rope handles at either end. Evidently the chest had but  recently been nailed up. As Zarmi touched it lightly with the pointed  toe of her little red slipper I clutched at Fletcher for support.    Fletcher grasped my arm in a vice-like grip. To him, too, had come  the ghastly conviction--the gruesome thought that neither of us dared  to name.    It was Nayland Smith's coffin that we were to carry!    \"Through here,\" came dimly to my ears, \"and then I tell you what to  do....\"    Coolness returned to me, suddenly, unaccountably. I doubted not for an  instant that the best friend I had in the world lay dead there at the  feet of the hellish girl who called herself Zarmi, and I knew since it  was she, disguised, who had driven him to his doom, that she must have  been actively concerned in his murder.    But, I argued, although the damp night air was pouring in through the  door which Zarmi now held open, although sound of Thames-side activity  came stealing to my ears, we were yet within the walls of the Joy-Shop,  with a score or more Asiatic ruffians at the woman's beck and call....    With perfect truth I can state that I retain not even a shadowy  recollection of aiding Fletcher to move the chest out on to the brink  of the cutting--for it was upon this that the door directly opened.  The mist had grown denser, and except a glimpse of slowly moving water  beneath me, I could discern little of our surrounding.    So much I saw by the light of a lantern which stood in the stern of a  boat. In the bows of this boat I was vaguely aware of the presence of  a crouched figure enveloped in rugs--vaguely aware that two filmy  eyes regarded me out of the darkness. A man who looked like a lascar  stood upright in the stern.    I must have been acting like a man in a stupor; for I was aroused to  the realities by the contact of a burning cigarette with the lobe of  my right ear!    \"Hurry, quick, strong feller!\" said Zarmi softly.    At that it seemed as though some fine nerve of my brain, already  strained to utmost tension, snapped. I turned, with a wild,  inarticulate cry, my fists raised frenziedly above my head.    \"You fiend!\" I shrieked at the mocking Eurasian, \"you yellow fiend of  hell!\"    I was beside myself, insane. Zarmi fell back a step, flashing a glance  from my own contorted face to that, now pale even beneath its artificial  tan, of Fletcher.    I snatched the pistol from my pocket, and for one fateful moment the  lust of slaying claimed my mind.... Then I turned towards the river,  and, raising the Browning, fired shot after shot in the air.    \"Weymouth!\" I cried. \"Weymouth!\"    A sharp hissing sound came from behind me; a short, muffled cry ...  and something descended, crushing, upon my skull. Like a wild cat  Zarmi hurled herself past me and leapt into the boat. One glimpse I  had of her pallidly dusky face, of her blazing black eyes, and the  boat was thrust off into the waterway ... was swallowed up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17966"],[0,"Life History of the Kangaroo Rat (#8)"],[1," ON RANGE RESERVE.

From about February to April a decrease may be noted,  followed, if the spring growth of annuals be good, by a slight increase;  and we can very nearly predict the general character of the increases  and decreases by the precipitation and consequent growth conditions.

Mex.; others from      United States Range Reserve, near the Santa Rita Mountains, Ariz.]    In presenting Table 2, showing quantity of storage per burrow correlated  with the time of year and the character of the preceding growing season,  the fact may be emphasized that the growing seasons in southern Arizona  are two in number--early spring and midsummer. The spring season is the  less important, the plants consisting chiefly of a variety of small  annuals, while the important range grasses make their chief growth and  head out almost exclusively in the July-August rainy season. It may be  noted also that the actual increases in storage appear somewhat after  the growth period proper, since storing does not get well under way  until the seed crop is mature. The banner-tailed kangaroo rat shows a  marked adaptability to different foods available in the neighborhood of  its burrows. It must, perforce, adapt itself and its storage program to  the food that it can get, and this varies enormously with the climatic  conditions of successive seasons. The large numbers present in suitable  localities clearly indicate that the animal is successful in meeting the  changing and sometimes extremely adverse conditions of its environment.      [Illustration: PLATE VIII. FIG. 1.--CONTENT OF DEN EXCAVATED IN NEW MEXICO.    Storage content of Den No. 24, of Table 1, from Sandia Mountains, N.  Mex. This is the largest lot of storage taken in the course of the  investigations. The larger pile consists wholly of a valuable grass,  _Sporobolus cryptandrus strictus_: the smaller of Russian thistle  (_Salsola pestifer._)]    [Illustration: PLATE VIII. FIG. 2.--GROWTH FOLLOWING ELIMINATION OF  KANGAROO RATS.    The same mound as shown in Plate III, Figure 1, after three years of  protection, the rodents having been killed out. Nearly as good grass  recovery following poisoning operations occurred in the single excellent  season of 1921.]      At times, more especially in the seasons of active growth, some of the  green and succulent portions of plants are eaten. This was very  noticeable in the spring of 1919, when a most luxuriant growth of  Mexican poppy (_Eschscholtzia mexicana_) occurred. Stomachs at this time  were filled with the yellow and green mixture undoubtedly produced by  the grinding up of the buds and flowers of this plant. Small caches of  about a tablespoonful of these buds were also found in the burrows at  this time. Occasionally in spring one may find a few green leaves of  various plants, _Gaertneria_ very commonly, tucked away in small pockets  along the underground tunnels, indicating that such materials are used  to some extent. As has been shown in detail, however (Table 1), the  chief storage, and undoubtedly the chief food, consists of air-dry  seeds.    The character of the storage, the absence of rain for months at a time  in some years, and the consequent failure of green succulents show that  without doubt _spectabilis_ possesses remarkable power, as to its water  requirements, of existing largely if not wholly upon the water derived  from air-dry starchy foods, i.e., metabolic water serves it in lieu of  drink (Nelson, 1918, 400), this being formed in considerable quantities  by oxidation of carbohydrates and fats (Babcock, 1912, 159, 170). During  the long dry periods characteristic of southern Arizona, no evidence  that the animal seeks a supply of succulent food, as cactus, is found;  and if it may go for two, three, or six months without water or  succulent food, it is reasonable to suppose that it may do so  indefinitely. In the laboratory _spectabilis_ ordinarily does not drink,  but rather shows a dislike for getting its nose wet. During the periods  of drought the attacks upon the cactuses by other rodents of the same  region, as _Lepus_, _Sylvilagus_, _Neotoma_, and _Ammospermophilus_,  become increasingly evident. The list of plant species thus far found  represented in the storage materials of _spectabilis_ on the Range  Reserve is shown in Table 3.
