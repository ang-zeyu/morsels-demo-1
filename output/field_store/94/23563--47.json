Little by little he got the habit of slyly  following them when they were hunting, always keeping out of sight. In  this way, he managed to get many meals of scraps. But these scraps  never wholly satisfied him, and his mouth used to water as he watched  the others feast on the very best when they had had a successful hunt.  He knew it wouldn't be of the least use to go out and boldly ask for  some, for in those hard times everybody was very, very selfish.    \"The times grew harder and harder, until it seemed as if Old Mother  Nature had wholly forgotten her little people of the Green Meadows and  the Green Forest. Mr. Coyote still managed to pick up a living, but he  was hungry most of the time, and the less he had to put in his  stomach, the sharper his wits grew. At last one day, as he stole  soft-footed through the Green Forest, he discovered Mr. Lynx having a  great feast. To keep still and watch him was almost more than Mr.  Coyote could stand, for he was so hungry that it seemed as if the  sides of his stomach almost met, it was so empty.    \"'If I could make myself into three, we could take that dinner away  from Mr. Lynx!\" thought he, and right on top of that thought came a  great idea. Why not make Mr. Lynx think he had a lot of friends with  him? It would do no harm to try. So Mr. Coyote put his nose up in the  air and howled. Mr. Lynx looked up and grinned. He had no fear of Mr.  Coyote. Then Mr. Coyote hurried around to the other side of Mr. Lynx,  all the time keeping out of sight, and howled again, and this time he  tried to make his voice sound different. Mr. Lynx stopped eating and  looked up a little surprised. 'I wonder if Mr. Coyote has got a  brother with him,' thought he. A minute later Mr. Coyote howled again  from the place where he had howled in the first place. 'He certainly  has,' thought Mr. Lynx, 'but I'm a match for two of them,' and once  more he went on eating.    \"Then Mr. Coyote began to run in a circle around Mr. Lynx, always  keeping out of sight in the thick brush, and every few steps he  yelped or howled, and each yelp or howl he tried to make sound  different. Now Mr. Coyote could run very fast, and he ran now as hard  as ever he could in a big circle, yelping and howling and making his  voice sound as different as possible each time. Mr. Lynx grew anxious  and lost his appetite. 'Mr. Coyote must have a whole crowd of  brothers,' thought he. 'I guess this is no place for me!' With that he  started to sneak away.    \"Mr. Coyote followed him, still trying to make his voice sound like  the voices of many. Mr. Lynx gave a hurried look over his shoulder and  began to run. Mr. Coyote kept after him, yelping and howling, until he  was sure that Mr. Lynx was so frightened that he wouldn't dare come  back. Then Mr. Coyote returned to the dinner Mr. Lynx had left, and  ate and ate until he couldn't hold another mouthful. His throat was  very raw and sore because he had strained it trying to make his voice  change so often, but he didn't mind this, because, you know, it felt  so good to have all he could eat at one time once more.    \"Now it just happened that Old Mother Nature had come along just in  time to see and hear Mr. Coyote, and it tickled her so to think that  Mr. Coyote had been so smart that what do you think she did? Why,  while he slept that night, she healed his sore throat, and she gave  him a new voice; and this voice was very wonderful, for it sounded for  all the world like many voices, all yelping and howling at the same  time. After that, all Mr. Coyote had to do when he wanted to frighten  some one bigger and stronger than himself was to open his mouth and  send forth his new voice, which sounded like many voices.    \"So he had plenty to eat from that time on. And all his children and  his children's children had that same wonderful voice, just as Old Man  Coyote has now. Chug-a-rum! Now scamper home, Peter Rabbit, and see  that you don't let Old Man Coyote's sharp wits get you into trouble.\"    \"Thank you, Grandfather Frog!\" cried Peter and scampered as fast as he  could go for the dear, safe Old Briar-patch.          IX    WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND      Striped Chipmunk sat staring at a little ridge where the grass was  raised up. He had often seen little ridges like that without thinking  much about them. He knew that they were made by Miner the Mole. He had  known that ever since he was big enough to begin to ask questions. But  now as he looked at this one, it suddenly struck him that he had not  seen Miner the Mole more than once or twice in all his life.    \"What a queer way of living!\" thought Striped Chipmunk. \"It's all very  well to have a snug house under the ground, where one can sleep the  long cold winter away and be perfectly safe, but what any one wants to  live under the ground all the time for, in the beautiful springtime  and summertime and autumntime, I can't understand. Just think of all  that Miner misses--the sunshine, the flowers, the songs of the birds,  and the Merry Little Breezes to play with! I wonder--\"    \"What do you wonder?\" The voice was so close to Striped Chipmunk that  it made him jump. He whirled about. There was Johnny Chuck, who had  tiptoed up as softly as he knew how, to give Striped Chipmunk a scare.  Johnny grinned. \"What do you wonder?\" he repeated.    Striped Chipmunk made a face at Johnny. \"I wonder something that I bet  you don't know,\" he replied.    \"That's easy,\" replied Johnny. \"There are more things I don't know  than I do know, but I'm always ready to learn. What is it this time?\"    \"Why does Miner the Mole live under ground all the time?\" Striped  Chipmunk pointed to the ridge made by Miner.    Johnny Chuck scratched his head thoughtfully.    \"I don't know,\" he confessed finally. \"I never thought of it before.  Of course there must be a reason. He never comes out to play with the  rest of us--just spends all his time by himself down in the dark,  digging and digging. I wonder--\"    \"Well, what do _you_ wonder?\"    \"The same thing you wonder,\" laughed Johnny Chuck. \"If you haven't got  anything else to do, let's go down to the Smiling Pool and ask  Grandfather Frog; he'll be sure to know.\"    Striped Chipmunk hadn't anything else to do, so off they started. On  the way they met Jimmy Skunk and Danny Meadow Mouse. Neither of them  knew why Miner the Mole lives under ground, and because they hadn't  anything better to do, they also started for the Smiling Pool.    Grandfather Frog was sitting on his big green lily-pad in the warm  sunshine, and for once he didn't have to be teased for a story.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" said he in his deep voice. \"It's very strange to me how  little some folks know about their nearest neighbors.\" He looked up  and winked at jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun.    Striped Chipmunk, Johnny Chuck, Jimmy Skunk, and Danny Meadow Mouse  looked as though they felt very foolish, as indeed they did. You see,  all their lives Miner the Mole had been one of their nearest  neighbors, and yet they didn't know the first thing about him.    \"It happened a long time ago,\" continued Grandfather Frog.    \"When the world was young?\" interrupted Danny Meadow Mouse.    \"Of course,\" replied Grandfather Frog, pretending to be very much put  out at such a foolish question. Danny hung his head and resolved that  he would bite his tongue before he asked another question.    \"In those days Miner's great-great-grandfather a thousand times  removed didn't live under ground,\" continued Grandfather Frog. \"Nobody  did. He wasn't so very different from a lot of other animals. Food was  plenty, and everybody was on the best of terms with everybody else.  Mr. Mole lived just as the rest did. He went and came as he pleased,  and enjoyed the sunshine and took part in all the good times of his  neighbors. Everybody liked him, and whenever he made a call, he was  sure of a welcome. But one thing Mr. Mole never did; he never meddled  in other people's affairs. No, Sir, Mr. Mole never poked his nose in  where he had no business.    \"For a long time everything went smoothly with all the people of the  Green Forest and the Green Meadows. Then came hard times. They grew  harder and harder. Food was scarce and kept growing more scarce.  Everybody was hungry, and you know how it is with hungry people--they  grow ugly and quarrelsome. Matters grew worse and worse, and then it  was that fear was born. The big people, like Old King Bear and Mr.  Wolf and Mr. Panther and Mr. Lynx, began to look with hungry eyes on  the little people, and the little people began to grow afraid and hide  from the big people, and all the time they were continually quarreling  among themselves and stealing from each other to get enough to eat.    \"Now, as I said before, Mr. Mole never had meddled with other people's  business, and he didn't now. He went off by himself to think things  over. 'It isn't safe to run around any more,' said he. 'I met Mr. Wolf  this morning, and he looked at me with such a hungry look in his eyes  that it gave me the cold shivers. I believe he would have eaten me, if  I hadn't crawled into an old hollow stump. Now I can't run fast,  because my legs are too short. I can't climb trees like Mr. Squirrel,  and I can't swim like Mr. Muskrat. The only thing I can do is to dig.'    \"You see, Mr. Mole always had been very fond of digging, and he had  done so much of it that his front legs and claws had grown very stout.    \"'Now if I dig a hole and keep out of sight, I won't have to worry  about Mr. Wolf or anybody else,' continued Mr. Mole to himself. So he  went to work at once and dug a hole on the Green Meadows, and, because  he wanted to be comfortable, he made a big hole. When it was finished,  he was tired, so he curled up at the bottom for a nap. He was awakened  by hearing voices "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14959"],[0,"The Hymns of Prudentius (#8)"],[1,"eam.          50        Hanc obsequelam praeparabat nuntius    mox adfuturo construens iter Deo,    clivosa planis, confragosa ut lenibus    converterentur, neve quidquam devium    inlapsa terris inveniret veritas.            55        Non usitatis ortus his natalibus    oblita lactis iam vieto in pectore    matris tetendit serus infans ubera:    nec ante partu de senili effusus est,    quam praedicaret virginem plenam Deo.        60        Post in patentes ille solitudines    amictus hirtis bestiarum pellibus    setisve tectus hispida et lanugine    secessit, horrens inquinari et pollui    contaminatis oppidorum moribus.              65        Illic dicata parcus abstinentia    potum cibumque vir severae industriae    in usque serum respuebat vesperum,    parvum locustis et favorum agrestium    liquore pastum corpori suetus dare.          70        Hortator ille primus et doctor novae    fuit salutis, nam sacrato in flumine    veterum piatas lavit errorum notas:    sed tincta postquam membra defaecaverat,    caelo refulgens influebat spiritus.          75        Hoc ex lavacro labe dempta criminum    ibant renati non secus, quam si rudis    auri recocta vena pulchrum splendeat,    micet metalli sive lux argentei,    sudum polito praenitens purgamine.           80        Referre prisci stemma mine ieiunii    libet fideli proditum volumine,    ut diruendae civitatis incolis    fulmen benigni mansuefactum Patris    pie repressis ignibus pepercerit.            85        Gens insolenti praepotens iactantia    pollebat olim, quam fluentem nequiter    conrupta vulgo solverat lascivia,    et inde bruto contumax fastidio    cultum superni negligebat numinis.           90        Offensa tandem iugis indulgentiae    censura iustis excitatur motibus,    dextram perarmat rhompheali incendio    nimbos crepantes et fragosos turbines    vibrans tonantum nube flammarum quatit.      95        Sed paenitendi dum datur diecula,    si forte vellent inprobam libidinem    veteresque nugas condomare ac frangere,    suspendit ictum terror exorabilis    paullumque dicta substitit sententia.       100        Ionam prophetam mitis ultor excitat,    paenae inminentis iret ut praenuntius,    sed nosset ille qui minacem iudicem    servare malle, quam ferire ac plectere,    tectam latenter vertit in Tharsos fugam.    105        Celsam paratis pontibus scandit ratem,    udo revincta fune puppis solvitur,    itur per altum, fit procellosum mare:    tum causa tanti quaeritur periculi,    sors in fugacem missa vatem decidit.        110        Iussus perire solus e cunctis reus,    cuius voluta crimen urna expresserat,    praeceps rotatur et profundo inmergitur:    exceptus inde beluinis faucibus    alvi capacis vivus hauritur specu.          115           *       *       *       *       *        Intactus exin tertiae noctis vice    monstri vomentis pellitur singultibus,    qua murmuranti fine fluctus frangitur,    salsosque candens spuma tundit pumices,    ructatus exit seque servatum stupet.        130        In Ninivitas se coactus percito    gressu reflectit, quos ut increpaverat    pudenda censor inputans opprobria;

HYMN FOR THOSE WHO FAST        O Jesus, Light of Bethlehem,      True Son of God, Incarnate Word;    Thou offspring of a Virgin's womb,      Be present at our frugal board;    Accept our fast, our sacrifice,      And smile upon us, gracious Lord.      For by this holiest mystery      The inward parts are cleansed from stain,    And, taming all the unbridled lusts,      Our sinful flesh we thus restrain,    Lest gluttony and drunkenness      Should choke the soul and cloud the brain.      Hence appetite and luxury      Are forced their empire to resign;    The wanton sport, the jest obscene,      The ignoble sway of sleep and wine,    And all the plagues of languid sense      Feel the strict bonds of discipline.      For if, full fed with meat and drink,      The flesh thou ne'er dost mortify,    The mind, that spark of sacred flame,      By pleasure dulled, must fail and die,    And pent in its gross prison-house      The soul in shameful torpor lie.      So be thy carnal lusts controlled,      So be thy judgment clear and bright;    Then shall thy spirit, swift and free,      Be gifted with a keener sight,    And breathing in an ampler air      To the All-Father pray aright.      Elias by such abstinence,      Seer of the desert, grew in grace,    Who left the madding haunts of men      And found a peaceful resting-place,    Where, far from sinful crowds, he trod      The pure and silent wilderness.      Till by those fiery coursers drawn      The swift car bore him through the air,    Lest earth's defiling touch should mar      The holiness it might not share,    Or some polluting breath disturb      The peace attained by fast and prayer.      Moses, through whom from His dread throne      The will of God to man was told,    No food might touch till through the sky      The sun full forty times had rolled,    Ere God before him stood revealed,      Lord of the heavens sevenfold.      Tears were his meat, while bent in prayer      Through the long night he bowed his head    E'en to the thirsty dust, that drank      The drops in bitter weeping shed;    Till, at God's call, he saw the flame      No eye may bear, and was afraid.      The Baptist, too, was strong in fast--      Forerunner in a later day    Of God's Eternal Son--who made      The byepaths plain, the crooked way    A road direct, wherein His feet      Might travel on without delay.      This was the messenger's great task      Who for God's advent zealously    Prepared the way, the rough made smooth,      The mountain levelled to the sea;    That, when Truth came from heaven to earth,      All fair and straight His path should be.      He was not born in common wise,      For dry and wrinkled was the breast    Of her that bare him late in years,      Nor found she from her labour rest,    Till she had hailed with lips inspired      The Maid with unborn Godhead blest.      For him the hairy skins of beasts      Furnished a raiment rude and wild,    As forth into the lonely waste      He fared, an unbefriended child,    Who dwelt apart, lest he should be      By evil city-life defiled.      There, vowed to"]]]
