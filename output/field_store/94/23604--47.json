What I have here said about currents, winds, calms, etc. in this passage  is chiefly for the farther illustration of what I have heretofore  observed in general about these matters, and especially as to crossing  the Line, in my Discourse of the Winds, etc. in the Torrid Zone: which  observations I have had very much confirmed to me in the course of this  voyage; and I shall particularise in several of the chief of them as they  come in my way. And indeed I think I may say this of the main of the  observations in that treatise that the clear satisfaction I had about  them and how much I might rely upon them was a great ease to my mind  during this vexatious voyage; wherein the ignorance, and obstinacy  withal, of some under me, occasioned me a great deal of trouble: though  they found all along, and were often forced to acknowledge it, that I was  seldom out in my conjectures when I told them usually beforehand what  winds, etc. we should meet with at such or such particular places we  should come at.    Pernambuco was the port that I designed for at my first setting out from  St. Jago; it being a place most proper for my purpose, by reason of its  situation, lying near the extremity of Cape St. Augustine, the  easternmost promontory of Brazil; by which means it not only enjoys the  greater benefit of the seabreezes, and is consequently more healthy than  other places to the southward, but is withal less subject to the  southerly coasting tradewinds that blow half the year on this shore;  which were now drawing on, and might be troublesome to me: so that I  might both hope to reach soonest Pernambuco as most directly and nearest  in my run; and might thence also more easily get away to the southward  than from Bahia de todos los Santos or Rio de Janeiro.    But notwithstanding these advantages I proposed to myself in going to  Pernambuco I was soon put by that design through the refractoriness of  some under me, and the discontents and backwardness of some of my men.  For the calms and shiftings of winds which I met with, as I was to  expect, in crossing the Line, made them who were unacquainted with these  matters almost heartless as to the pursuit of the voyage, as thinking we  should never be able to weather Cape St. Augustine: and though I told  them that by that time we should get to about three degrees south of the  Line we should again have a true brisk general tradewind from the  north-east, that would carry us to what part of Brazil we pleased, yet  they would not believe it till they found it so. This, with some other  unforeseen accidents, not necessary to be mentioned in this place,  meeting with the aversion of my men to a long unknown voyage, made me  justly apprehensive of their revolting, and was a great trouble and  hindrance to me. So that I was obliged partly to alter my measures, and  met with many difficulties, the particulars of which I shall not trouble  the reader with: but I mention thus much of it in general for my own  necessary vindication, in my taking such measures sometimes for  prosecuting the voyage as the state of my ship's crew, rather than my own  judgment and experience, determined me to. The disorders of my ship made  me think at present that Pernambuco would not be so fit a place for me;  being told that ships ride there 2 or 3 leagues from the town, under the  command of no forts; so that whenever I should have been ashore it might  have been easy for my discontented crew to have cut or slipped their  cables and have gone away from me: many of them discovering already an  intention to return to England, and some of them declaring openly that  they would go no further onwards than Brazil. I altered my course  therefore, and stood away for Bahia de todos los Santos, or the Bay of  All Saints, where I hoped to have the governor's help, if need should  require, for securing my ship from any such mutinous attempt; being  forced to keep myself all the way upon my guard, and to lie with my  officers, such as I could trust, and with small arms upon the  quarter-deck; it scarce being safe for me to lie in my cabin by reason of  the discontents among my men.    HIS ARRIVAL ON THAT COAST AND IN THE BAY.    On the 23rd of March we saw the land of Brazil; having had thither, from  the time when we came into the true tradewind again after crossing the  Line, very fair weather and brisk gales, mostly at east-north-east. The  land we saw was about 20 leagues to the north of Bahia; so I coasted  alongshore to the southward. This coast is rather low than high, with  sandy bays all along by the sea.    OF THE SEVERAL FORTS, THE ROAD, SITUATION, TOWN, AND BUILDINGS OF BAHIA.    A little within land are many very white spots of sand appearing like  snow; and the coast looks very pleasant, being chequered with woods and  savannahs. The trees in general are not tall; but they are green and  flourishing. There are many small houses by the seaside, whose  inhabitants are chiefly fishermen. They come off to sea on bark logs,  made of several logs fastened side to side, that have one or two masts  with sails to them. There are two men in each bark log, one at either  end, having small low benches, raised a little above the logs, to sit and  fish on, and two baskets hanging up at the mast or masts; one to put  their provisions in, the other for their fish. Many of these were  a-fishing now, and 2 of them came aboard, of whom I bought some fish. In  the afternoon we sailed by one very remarkable piece of land where, on a  small pleasant hill, there was a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. See  a sight of some parts of this coast and of the hill the church stands on.    I coasted along till the evening and then brought to, and lay by till the  next morning. About 2 hours after we were brought to, there came a sail  out of the offing (from seaward) and lay by about a mile to windward of  us and so lay all night. In the morning upon speaking with her she proved  to be a Portuguese ship bound to Bahia; therefore I sent my boat aboard  and desired to have one of his mates to pilot me in: he answered that he  had not a mate capable of it, but that he would sail in before me, and  show me the way; and that if he went into the harbour in the night he  would hang out a light for me. He said we had not far in, and might reach  it before night with a tolerable gale; but that with so small an one as  now we had we could not do it: so we jogged on till night and then he  accordingly hung out his light, which we steered after, sounding as we  went in. I kept all my men on deck and had an anchor ready to let go on  occasion. We had the tide of ebb against us, so that we went in but  slowly; and it was about the middle of the night when we anchored.  Immediately the Portuguese master came aboard to see me, to whom I  returned thanks for his civilities; and indeed I found much respect, not  only from this gentleman but from all of that nation both here and in  other places, who were ready to serve me on all occasions. The place that  we anchored in was about two miles from the harbour where the ships  generally ride; but the fear I had lest my people should run away with  the ship made me hasten to get a licence from the governor to run up into  the harbour and ride among their ships, close by one of their forts. So  on the 25th of March about ten o'clock in the morning, the tide serving,  I went thither, being piloted by the superintendent there, whose business  it is to carry up all the King of Portugal's ships that come hither, and  to see them well moored. He brought us to an anchor right against the  town, at the outer part of the harbour, which was then full of ships,  within 150 yards of a small fort that stands on a rock half a mile from  the shore. See a prospect of the harbour and the town as it appeared to  us while we lay at anchor.    Bahia de todos los Santos lies in latitude 13 degrees south. It is the  most considerable town in Brazil, whether in respect of the beauty of its  buildings, its bulk, or its trade and revenue. It has the convenience of  a good harbour that is capable of receiving ships of the greatest burden:  the entrance of which is guarded with a strong fort standing without the  harbour, called St. Antonio: a sight of which I have given as it appeared  to us the afternoon before we came in; and its lights (which they hang  out purposely for ships) we saw the same night. There are other smaller  forts that command the harbour, one of which stands on a rock in the sea,  about half a mile from the shore. Close by this fort all ships must pass  that anchor here, and must ride also within half a mile of it at farthest  between this and another fort (that stands on a point at the inner part  of the harbour and is called the Dutch Fort) but must ride nearest to the  former, all along against the town: where there is good holding ground,  and less exposed to the southerly winds that blow very hard here. They  commonly set in about April, but blow hardest in May, June, July and  August: but the place where the ships ride is exposed to these winds not  above 3 points of the compass.    Beside these there is another fort fronting the harbour, and standing on  the hill upon which the town stands. The town itself consists of about  2000 houses; the major part of which cannot be seen from the harbour; but  so many as appear in sight with a great mixture of trees between them,  and all placed on a rising hill, make a very pleasant prospect; as may be  judged by the draught.    There are in the town 13 churches, chapels, hospitals, convents, beside  one nunnery, namely the ecclesia major or cathedral, the Jesuits'  college, which are the chief, and both in sight from the harbour: St.  Antonio, St. Barbara, both parish churches; the Franciscans' church, and  the Dominicans'; and 2 convents of Carmelites; a chapel for seamen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15697"],[0,"True Stories of History and Biography (#8)"],[1,"the children from the more cruel bondage of  ignorance and idolatry. Chiefly for this end, it may be, we were directed  across the ocean.\"    When these other visitors were gone, Mr. Eliot bent himself again over the  half written page. He dared hardly relax a moment from his toil. He felt  that, in the book which he was translating, there was a deep human, as  well as heavenly wisdom, which would of itself suffice to civilize and  refine the savage tribes. Let the Bible be diffused among them, and all  earthly good would follow. But how slight a consideration was this, when  he reflected that the eternal welfare of a whole race of men depended upon  his accomplishment of the task which he had set himself! What if his hands  should be palsied? What if his mind should lose its vigor? What if death  should come upon him, ere the work were done? Then must the red man wander  in the dark wilderness of heathenism for ever.    Impelled by such thoughts as these, he sat writing in the great chair,  when the pleasant summer breeze came in through his open casement; and  also when the fire of forest logs sent up its blaze and smoke, through the  broad stone chimney, into the wintry air. Before the earliest bird sang,  in the morning, the apostle's lamp was kindled; and, at midnight, his  weary head was not yet upon its pillow. And at length, leaning back in the  great chair, he could say to himself, with a holy triumph,--\"The work is  finished!\"    It was finished. Here was a Bible for the Indians. Those long lost  descendants of the ten tribes of Israel would now learn the history of  their forefathers. That grace, which the ancient Israelites had forfeited,  was offered anew to their children.    There is no impiety in believing that, when his long life was over, the  apostle of the Indians was welcomed to the celestial abodes by the  prophets of ancient days, and by those earliest apostles and evangelists,  who had drawn their inspiration from the immediate presence of the  Saviour. They first had preached truth and salvation to the world. And  Eliot, separated from them by many centuries, yet full of the same spirit,  had borne the like message to the new world of the West. Since the first  days of Christianity, there has been no man more worthy to be numbered in  the brotherhood of the apostles, than Eliot.        \"My heart is not satisfied to think,\" observed Laurence, \"that Mr. Eliot's  labors have done no good, except to a few Indians of his own time.  Doubtless, he would not have regretted his toil, if it were the means of  saving but a single soul. But it is a grievous thing to me, that he should  have toiled so hard to translate the Bible, and now the language and the  people are gone! The Indian Bible itself is almost the only relic of  both.\"    \"Laurence,\" said his Grandfather, \"if ever you should doubt that man is  capable of disinterested zeal for his brother's good, then remember how  the apostle Eliot toiled. And if you should feel your own self-interest  pressing upon your heart too closely, then think of Eliot's Indian Bible.  It is good for the world that such a man has lived, and left this emblem  of his life.\"    The tears gushed into the eyes of Laurence, and he acknowledged that Eliot  had not toiled in vain. Little Alice put up her arms to Grandfather, and  drew down his white head beside her own golden locks.    \"Grandfather,\" whispered she, \"I want to kiss good Mr. Eliot!\"    And, doubtless, good Mr. Eliot would gladly receive the kiss of so sweet a  child as little Alice, and would think it a portion of his reward in  heaven.    Grandfather now observed, that Dr. Francis had written a very beautiful  Life of Eliot, which he advised Laurence to peruse. He then spoke of King  Philip's war, which began in 1675, and terminated with the death of King  Philip, in the following year. Philip was a proud, fierce Indian, whom Mr.  Eliot had vainly endeavored to convert to the Christian faith.    \"It must have been a great anguish to the apostle,\" continued Grandfather,  \"to hear of mutual slaughter and outrage between his own countrymen, and  those for whom he felt the affection of a father. A few of the praying  Indians joined the followers of King Philip. A greater number fought on  the side of the English. In the course of the war, the little community of  red people whom Mr. Eliot had begun to civilize, was scattered, and  probably never was restored to a flourishing condition. But his zeal did  not grow cold; and only about five years before his death he took great  pains in preparing a new edition of the Indian Bible.\"    \"I do wish Grandfather,\" cried Charley, \"you would tell us all about the  battles in King Philip's war.\"    \"O, no!\" exclaimed Clara. \"Who wants to hear about tomahawks and scalping  knives!\"    \"No, Charley,\" replied Grandfather, \"I have no time to spare in talking  about battles. You must be content with knowing that it was the bloodiest  war that the Indians had ever waged against the white men; and that, at  its close, the English set King Philip's head upon a pole.\"    \"Who was the captain of the English?\" asked Charley.    \"Their most noted captain was Benjamin Church,--a very famous warrior,\"  said Grandfather. \"But I assure you, Charley, that neither Captain Church,  nor any of the officers and soldiers who fought in King Philip's war, did  any thing a thousandth part so glorious, as Mr. Eliot did, when he  translated the Bible for the Indians.\"    \"Let Laurence be the apostle,\" said Charley to himself, \"and I will be the  captain.\"          Chapter IX      The children were now accustomed to assemble round Grandfather's chair, at  all their unoccupied moments; and often it was a striking picture to  behold the white-headed old sire, with this flowery wreath of young people  around him. When he talked to them, it was the past speaking to the  present,--or rather to the future, for the children were of a generation  which had not become actual. Their part in life, thus far, was only to be  happy, and to draw knowledge from a thousand sources. As yet, it was not  their time to do.    Sometimes, as Grandfather gazed at their fair, unworldly countenances, a  mist of tears bedimmed his spectacles. He almost regretted that it was  necessary for them to know any thing of the past, or to provide aught for  the future. He could have wished that they might be always the happy,  youthful creatures, who had hitherto sported around his chair, without  inquiring whether it had a history. It grieved him to think that his  little Alice, who was a flower-bud fresh from paradise, must open her  leaves to the rough breezes of the world, or ever open them in any clime.  So sweet a child she was, that it seemed fit her infancy should be  immortal!    But such repinings were merely flitting shadows across the old man's  heart. He had faith enough to believe, and wisdom enough to know, that the  bloom of the flower would be even holier and happier than its bud. Even  within himself,--though Grandfather was now at that period of life, when  the veil of mortality is apt to hang heavily over the soul,--still, in his  inmost being, he was conscious of something that he would not have  exchanged for the best happiness of childhood. It was a bliss to which  every sort of earthly experience,--all that he had enjoyed or suffered, or  seen, or heard, or acted, with the broodings of his soul upon the  whole,--had contributed somewhat. In the same manner must a bliss, of which  now they could have no conception, grow up within these children, and form  a part of their sustenance for immortality.    So Grandfather, with renewed cheerfulness, continued his history of the  chair, trusting that a profounder wisdom than his own would extract, from  these flowers and weeds of Time, a fragrance that might last beyond all  time.    At this period of the story, Grandfather threw a glance backward, as far  as the year 1660. He spoke of the ill-concealed reluctance with which the  Puritans in America had acknowledged the sway of Charles the Second, on  his restoration to his father's throne. When death had stricken Oliver  Cromwell, that mighty protector had no sincerer mourners than in New  England. The new king had been more than a year upon the throne before his  accession was proclaimed in Boston; although the neglect to perform the  ceremony might have subjected the rulers to the charge of treason.    During the reign of Charles the Second, however, the American colonies had  but little reason to complain of harsh or tyrannical treatment. But when  Charles died, in 1685, and was succeeded by his brother James, the  patriarchs of New England began to tremble. King James was a bigoted Roman  Catholic, and was known to be of an arbitrary temper. It was feared by all  Protestants, and chiefly by the Puritians, that he would assume despotic  power, and attempt to establish Popery throughout his dominions. Our  forefathers felt that they had no security either for their religion or  their liberties.    The result proved that they had reason for their apprehensions. King James  caused the charters of all the American colonies to be taken away. The old  charter of Massachusetts, which the people regarded as a holy thing, and  as the foundation of all their liberties, was declared void. The colonists  were now no longer freemen; they were entirely dependent on the king's  pleasure. At first, in 1685, King James appointed Joseph Dudley, a native  of Massachusetts, to be president of New England. But soon afterwards, Sir  Edmund Andros, an officer of the English army, arrived, with a commission  to be governor-general of New England and New York.    The king had given such powers to Sir Edmund Andros, that there was now no  liberty, nor scarcely any law, in the colonies over which he ruled. The  inhabitants were not allowed to choose representatives, and consequently  had no voice whatever in the government, nor"]]]
