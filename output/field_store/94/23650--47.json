It is said that a majority of the Commission are in favour of  introducing an auxiliary language into the schools, when one has been  chosen by the Delegation or by the Association of Academies. It is  therefore possible that in a year or two Esperanto may be officially  recognized in France; and if this is so, other nations will have to  examine the matter seriously.    Considering that the French are notoriously bad linguists and, above all  other peoples, devoted to the cult of their own language and literature,  it is somewhat remarkable that the cause of an artificial language  should have made more progress among them than elsewhere. It might have  been anticipated that the obstructionist outcry, raised so freely in all  countries by those who imagine that an insidious attack is being made on  taste, culture, and national language and literature, would have been  particularly loud in France. On the contrary, it is precisely in that  country that the movement has made most popular progress, and that it  numbers the most scientists, scholars, and distinguished men among its  adherents. Is it that history will one day have to record another case  of France leading Europe in the van of progress?    Encouraged by the number of distinguished signatures obtained in France  to their petition in 1901, the Delegation drew up a formula of assent  to their Declaration, which they circulate amongst (1) members of  academies, (2) members of universities, in all countries. They also  keep a list of societies of all kinds who have declared their adherence  to the scheme. The latest lists (February and March 1907) show 1,060  signatures of academicians and university members, and 273 societies.  In both cases the most influential backing is in France. Thus among the  signatures figure in Paris alone:                    10 professors of the College de France;                   8      \"     \"   \"  Faculty of Medicine;                  13      \"     \"   \"  Faculty of Science;                  11      \"     \"   \"  Faculty of Letters;                  12      \"     \"   \"  École Normale;                  37  members   of the Academy of Science;    besides a host of other members of various learned bodies. Many of these  are members of that august body the Institut de France, and one is a  member of the Académie française--M. Lavisse.    It is the same in the other French Universities: Lyons University, 53  professors; Dijon, 34; Caen, 18; Besançon, 15; Grenoble, 26; Marseilles,  56, and so on.    Universities in other lands make a fair showing. America contributes  supporters from John Hopkins University, 20 professors; Boston Academy  of Arts and Sciences, 13 members; Harvard, 7 professors; Columbia  University, 23 professors; Washington Academy of Science, 19 members;  Columbus University, Ohio, 21 professors, etc. Dublin and Edinburgh both  contribute a few. England is represented by one entry: \"Cambridge, 2  professors.\" Perhaps the Cambridge Congress will change this somewhat.  It will be strange if any one can actually witness a congress without  having his imagination to some extent stirred by the possibilities.    A noticeable feature of the action of the Delegation throughout has been  the scientific spirit in which it has gone to work, and its absolute  impartiality as to the language to be adopted. It has everywhere, in  its propaganda and circulars, spoken of \"an international auxiliary  language,\" and has been careful not to prejudge in any way the question  as to which shall be adopted.    It may be news to many that there are several rival languages in the  field. Even the enthusiastic partisans of Esperanto are often completely  ignorant of the existence of competitors. It was partly with the object  of furnishing full information to the Delegates who are to make the  choice, that MM. Couturat and Leau composed their admirable _Histoire  de la langue universelle_. It contains a brief but scientific account  of each language mentioned, the leading principles of its construction,  and an excellent critique. The main principles are disengaged by the  authors with a masterly clearness and precision of analysis from the  mass of material before them. Though they are careful to express no  personal preference, and let fall nothing which might unfairly prejudice  the delegates in favour of any scheme, it is not difficult to judge, by  a comparison of the scientific critiques, which of the competing schemes  analysed most fully carries out the principles which experience now  shows to be essential to success for any artificial language.    The impression left is, that whether judged by the test of conformity to  necessary principles, or by the old maxim \"possession is nine points of  the law,\" Esperanto has no serious rival.                                        VII                    CAN THE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE BE LATIN?    There are some who fully admit the desirability of an international  language, but say that we have no need to invent one, as we have Latin.  This tends to be the argument of literary persons.[1] They back it up by  pointing out that Latin has already done duty in the Middle Ages as  a common medium, and therefore, they say, what it has once done with  success it can do again.       [1]It has even cropped up again in the able articles in _The     Times_ on the reformed pronunciation of Latin (April 1907).    It is hard to argue with such persons, because they have not grasped  the fact that the nature of international communication has undergone  a complete change, and that therefore there is no presumption that  the same medium will suffice for carrying it on. In the Middle Ages  the cosmopolitan public was almost entirely a learned one. The only  people who wanted to communicate with foreigners (except for a certain  amount of commerce) were scholars, and the only things they wanted to  communicate about were learned subjects, mostly of a philosophical  or literary nature, which Latin was adapted to express. The educated  public was extremely small, and foreign travel altogether beyond the  reach of all but the very few. The overwhelming mass of the people were  illiterate, and fast tied to their native spot by lack of pence, lack of  communications, and the general conditions of life.    Now that everybody can read and write and get about, and all the  conditions of life have changed, the cosmopolitan public, so far from  being confined to a handful of scholars and merchants, extends down  to and is largely made up of that terrible modern production, \"the  man in the street.\" It is quite ridiculous to pretend that because  an Erasmus or a Casaubon could carry on literary controversies, with  amazing fluency and hard-hitting, in Ciceronian Latin, therefore \"the  bald-headed man at the back of the omnibus\" can give up the time  necessary to obtaining a control of Latin sufficient for the conduct of  his affairs, or for hobnobbing with his kind abroad.    It is waste of time to argue with those who do not realize that the  absolute essentials of any auxiliary language in these days are ease  of acquirement and accessibility to all. There are actually some  newspapers published in Latin and dealing with modern topics. As an  amusement for the learned they are all very well; but the portentous  periphrases to which they are reduced in describing tramway accidents  or motor-cars, the rank obscurity of the terms in which advertisements  of the most ordinary goods are veiled, ought to be enough to drive  their illusions out of the heads of the modern champions of Latin for  practical purposes. Let these persons take in the Roman _Vox Urbis_ for  a month or two, or get hold of a copy of the London _Alaudae_, and see  how they feel then.    A dim perception of the requirements of the modern world has inspired  the various schemes for a barbarized and simplified Latin. It is almost  incredible that the authors of such schemes cannot see that debased  Latin suffers from all the defects alleged against an artificial  language, plus quite prohibitory ones of its own, without attaining  the corresponding advantages. It is just as artificial as an entirely  new language, without being nearly so easy (especially to speak) or  adaptable to modern life. It sins against the cardinal principle that  an auxiliary language shall inflict no damage upon any natural one. In  short, it disgusts both parties (scholars and tradesmen), and satisfies  the requirements of neither. Those who want an easy language, within  the reach of the intelligent person with only an elementary school  groundwork of education, don't get it; and the scholarly party, who  treat any artificial language as a cheap commercial scheme, have their  teeth set on edge by unparalleled barbarisms, which must militate most  seriously against the correct use of classical Latin.    Such schemes are dead of their own dogginess.    Latin, pure or mongrel, won't do.                                        VIII                    CAN THE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE BE GREEK?    This chapter might be as short and dogmatic as Mark Twain's celebrated  chapter upon snakes in Ireland. It would be enough to merely answer  \"No,\" but that the indefatigable Mr. Henderson, after running through  three artificial languages of his own, has come to the conclusion that  Greek is the thing. Certainly, as regards flexibility and power of  word-formation, Greek would be better than Latin on its own merits. But  it is too hard, and the scheme has nothing practical about it.                                         IX              CAN THE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE BE A MODERN LANGUAGE?    Jingoes are not wanting who say that it is unpatriotic of any Englishman  to be a party to the introduction of a neutral language, because English  is manifestly destined to be the language of the world.

A simile, in poetry, should usually he read in a lower key and more  rapidly than other parts of the passage--somewhat as a parenthesis is  read.      EXAMPLES. (45)    1. Part curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal     With rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form.     As when, to warn proud cities, war appears,     Waged in the troubled sky, and armies rush     To battle in the clouds.     Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell,     Rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air     In whirlwind. Hell scarce holds the wild uproar.     As when Alcides felt the envenomed robe, and tore,     Through pain, up by the roots, Thessialian pines,     And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw     Into the Euboic sea.    2.                    Each at the head,     Leveled his deadly aim; their fatal hands     No second stroke intend; and such a frown     Each cast at th' other, as when two black clouds,     With heaven's artillery fraught, came rolling on     Over the Caspian, there stand front to front,     Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow     To join the dark encounter, in mid-air:     So frowned the mighty combatants.    3. Then pleased and thankful from the porch they go     And, but the landlord, none had cause of woe:     His cup was vanished; for, in secret guise,     The younger guest purloined the glittering prize.     As one who spies a serpent in his way,     Glistening and basking in the summer ray,     Disordered, stops to shun the danger near,     Then walks with faintness on, and looks with fear,--     So seemed the sire, when, far upon the road,     The shining spoil his wily partner showed.        V. THE VOICE. (46)    PITCH AND COMPASS.    The natural pitch of the voice is its keynote, or governing note. It is  that on which the voice usually dwells, and to which it most frequently  returns when wearied. It is also the pitch used in conversation, and the  one which a reader or speaker naturally adopts--when he reads or speaks--  most easily and agreeably.    The compass of the voice is its range above and below this pitch. To avoid  monotony in reading or speaking, the voice should rise above or fall below  this keynote, but always with reference to the sense or character of that  which is read or spoken. The proper natural pitch is that above and below  which there is most room for variation.    To strengthen the voice and increase its compass, select a short sentence,  repeat it several times in succession in as low a key as the voice can  sound naturally; then rise one note higher, and practice on that key, then  another, and so on, until the highest pitch of the voice has been reached.  Next, reverse the process, until the lowest pitch has been reached.      EXAMPLES IN PITCH (46)    High Pitch.    NOTE.--Be careful to distinguish pitch from power in the following  exercise. Speaking in the open air, at the very top of the voice, is an  exercise admirably adapted to strengthen the voice and give it compass,  and should be frequently practiced.    1. Charge'! Chester\" charge'! On'! Stanley, on'!    2. A horse'! a horse'! my kingdom' for a horse'!    3. Jump far out', boy' into the wave'!     Jump', or I fire'!    4. Run'! run'! run for your lives!    5. Fire'! fire'! fire'! Ring the bell'!    6. Gentlemen may cry peace'! peace'! but there is no peace!    7. Rouse' ye Romans!  rouse' ye slaves'!     Have ye brave sons'? Look in the next fierce brawl     To see them die'. Have ye fair daughters'? Look     To see them live, torn from your arms', distained',     Dishonored', and if ye dare call for justice',     Be answered by the lash'!    Medium Pitch. (47)    NOTE.--This is the pitch in which we converse. To strengthen it, we should  read or speak in it as loud as possible, without rising to a higher key.  To do this requires long-continued practice.    1. Under a spreading chestnut tree,       The village smithy stands';     The smith, a mighty man is he,       With large and sinewy hands';     And the muscles of his brawny arms       Are strong as iron bands.    2. There is something in the thunder's voice that makes me tremble like a  child. I have tried to conquer' this unmanly weakness'. I have called  pride' to my aid'; I have sought for moral courage in the lessons of  philosophy', but it avails me nothing'.

Thou little valiant, great in villainy!     Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!     Thou fortune's champion, thou dost never fight     But when her humorous ladyship is by     To teach thee safety! Thou art perjured too,     And sooth'st up greatness. What a fool art thou,     A ramping fool; to brag, and stamp, and sweat,     Upon my party! thou cold-blooded slave!    3. God! thou art mighty!  At thy footstool bound,     Lie, gazing to thee, Chance, and Life, and Death;     Nor in the angel circle flaming round,     Nor in the million worlds that blaze beneath,     Is one that can withstand thy wrath's hot breath.     Woe, in thy frown: in thy smile, victory:     Hear my last prayer! I ask no mortal wreath;     Let but these eyes my rescued country see,     Then take my spirit, all Omnipotent, to thee.    4. O Thou eternal One! whose presence bright       All space doth occupy, all motion guide,     Unchanged through time's all-devastating blight!       Thou only God, there is no god beside!     Being above all things, mighty One,       Whom none can comprehend and none explore;     Who fill'st existence with thyself alone,--       Embracing all, supporting, ruling o'er,--       Being whom we call God, and know no more!        QUANTITY AND QUALITY. (49)    Quantity, in reading and speaking, means the length of time occupied in  uttering a syllable or a word. Sounds and syllables vary greatly in  quantity. Some are long, some short, and others intermediate between those  which are long or short. Some sounds, also, may be prolonged or shortened  in utterance to any desired extent. Quantity may be classified as Long,  Medium, or Short.    DIRECTIONS FOR PRACTICE ON LONG QUANTITY.--Select some word of one  syllable ending with a long vocal or a subvocal sound; pronounce it many  times in succession, increasing the quantity at each repetition, until you  can dwell upon it any desired length of time, without drawling, and in a  natural tone.    REMARK.--Practice in accordance with this direction will enable the pupil  to secure that fullness and roundness of voice which is exemplified in the  hailing of a ship, \"ship aho--y;\" in the reply of the sailor, when, in the  roar of the storm, he answers his captain, \"ay--e. ay--e;\" and in the  command of the officer to his troops, when, amid the thunder of artillery,  he gives the order, \"ma--rch,\" or \"ha--lt.\"    This fullness or roundness of tone is secured, by dwelling on the vocal  sound, and indefinitely protracting it, The mouth should be opened wide,  the tongue kept down, and the aperture left as round and as free for the  voice as possible.    It is this artificial rotundity which, in connection with a distinct  articulation, enables one who speaks in the open air, or in a very large  apartment, to send his voice to the most distant point. It is a certain  degree of this quality, which distinguishes declamatory or public speaking  or reading from private conversation, and no one can accomplish much, as a  public speaker, without cultivating it. It must be carefully distinguished  from the \"high tone,\" which is an elevation of pitch, and from \"loudness.\"  or \"strength\" of voice.    It will be observed that clearness and distinctness of utterance are  secured by a proper use of the subvocals and aspirates--these sounds  giving to words their shape, as it were; but a clear, full, and  well-modulated utterance of the vocals gives to words their fullness.      LONG QUANTITY. (49)    1. Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!    2. Woe, woe, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem!    3. O righteous Heaven! ere Freedom found a grave,     Why slept the sword, omnipotent to save?     Where was thine arm, O Vengeance! where thy rod,     That smote the foes of Zion and of God?    4. O sailor boy! sailor boy! never again     Shall home, love, or kindred thy wishes repay;     Unblessed and unhonored, down deep in the main,     Full many a fathom, thy frame shall decay.    5. O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast  set thy glory above the heavens! When I consider thy heavens, the work of  thy fingers; the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is  man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest  him? For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast  crowned him with glory and honor. Thou madest him to have dominion over  the work of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet. O Lord,  our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!      MEDIUM QUANTITY. (50)    1.
