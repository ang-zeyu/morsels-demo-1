He worked farms in the forests of the North, but the locusts  obliterated his crops in a few hours. He was a cattle-driver, with the  aid of only two peons, driving a herd of oxen and mules over the snowy  solitudes of the Andes to Bolivia and Chile. In this life, making  journeys of many months' duration, across interminable plains, he lost  exact account of time and space. Just as he thought himself on the verge  of winning a fortune, he lost it all by an unfortunate speculation.  And in a moment of failure and despair, being now thirty years old, he  became an employee of Julio Madariaga.    He knew of this rustic millionaire through his purchases of flocks--a  Spaniard who had come to the country when very young, adapting himself  very easily to its customs, and living like a cowboy after he had  acquired enormous properties. The country folk, wishing to put a title  of respect before his name, called him Don Madariaga.    \"Comrade,\" he said to Desnoyers one day when he happened to be in a good  humor--a very rare thing for him--\"you must have passed through many ups  and downs. Your lack of silver may be smelled a long ways off. Why lead  such a dog's life? Trust in me, Frenchy, and remain here! I am growing  old, and I need a man.\"    After the Frenchman had arranged to stay with Madariaga, every landed  proprietor living within fifteen or twenty leagues of the ranch, stopped  the new employee on the road to prophesy all sorts of misfortune.    \"You will not stay long. Nobody can get along with Don Madariaga. We  have lost count of his overseers. He is a man who must be killed or  deserted. Soon you will go, too!\"    Desnoyers did not doubt but that there was some truth in all this.  Madariaga was an impossible character, but feeling a certain sympathy  with the Frenchman, had tried not to annoy him with his irritability.    \"He's a regular pearl, this Frenchy,\" said the plainsman as though  trying to excuse himself for his considerate treatment of his latest  acquisition. \"I like him because he is very serious. . . . That is the  way I like a man.\"    Desnoyers did not know exactly what this much-admired seriousness could  be, but he felt a secret pride in seeing him aggressive with everybody  else, even his family, whilst he took with him a tone of paternal  bluffness.    The family consisted of his wife Misia Petrona (whom he always called  the China) and two grown daughters who had gone to school in Buenos  Aires, but on returning to the ranch had reverted somewhat to their  original rusticity.    Madariaga's fortune was enormous. He had lived in the field since his  arrival in America, when the white race had not dared to settle outside  the towns for fear of the Indians. He had gained his first money as a  fearless trader, taking merchandise in a cart from fort to fort. He had  killed Indians, was twice wounded by them, and for a while had lived as  a captive with an Indian chief whom he finally succeeded in making his  staunch friend. With his earnings, he had bought land, much land, almost  worthless because of its insecurity, devoting it to the raising of  cattle that he had to defend, gun in hand, from the pirates of the  plains.    Then he had married his China, a young half-breed who was running around  barefoot, but owned many of her forefathers' fields. They had lived in  an almost savage poverty on their property which would have taken many a  day's journey to go around. Afterwards, when the government was pushing  the Indians towards the frontiers, and offering the abandoned lands  for sale, considering it a patriotic sacrifice on the part of any one  wishing to acquire them, Madariaga bought and bought at the lowest  figure and longest terms. To get possession of vast tracts and populate  it with blooded stock became the mission of his life. At times,  galloping with Desnoyers through his boundless fields, he was not able  to repress his pride.    \"Tell me something, Frenchy! They say that further up the country, there  are some nations about the size of my ranches. Is that so?\" . . .    The Frenchman agreed. . . . The lands of Madariaga were indeed greater  than many principalities. This put the old plainsman in rare good humor  and he exclaimed in the cowboy vernacular which had become second nature  to him--\"Then it wouldn't be absurd to proclaim myself king some day?  Just imagine it, Frenchy;--Don Madariaga, the First. . . . The worst of  it all is that I would also be the last, for the China will not give me  a son. . . . She is a weak cow!\"    The fame of his vast territories and his wealth in stock reached even to  Buenos Aires. Every one knew of Madariaga by name, although very few had  seen him. When he went to the Capital, he passed unnoticed because of  his country aspect--the same leggings that he was used to wearing in the  fields, his poncho wrapped around him like a muffler above which rose  the aggressive points of a necktie, a tormenting ornament imposed by his  daughters, who in vain arranged it with loving hands that he might look  a little more respectable.    One day he entered the office of the richest merchant of the capital.    \"Sir, I know that you need some young bulls for the European market, and  I have come to sell you a few.\"    The man of affairs looked haughtily at the poor cowboy. He might explain  his errand to one of the employees, he could not waste his time on such  small matters. But the malicious grin on the rustic's face awoke his  curiosity.    \"And how many are you able to sell, my good man?\"    \"About thirty thousand, sir.\"    It was not necessary to hear more. The supercilious merchant sprang from  his desk, and obsequiously offered him a seat.    \"You can be no other than Don Madariaga.\"    \"At the service of God and yourself, sir,\" he responded in the manner of  a Spanish countryman.    That was the most glorious moment of his existence.    In the outer office of the Directors of the Bank, the clerks offered him  a seat until the personage the other side of the door should deign to  receive him. But scarcely was his name announced than that same director  ran to admit him, and the employee was stupefied to hear the ranchman  say, by way of greeting, \"I have come to draw out three hundred thousand  dollars. I have abundant pasturage, and I wish to buy a ranch or two in  order to stock them.\"    His arbitrary and contradictory character weighed upon the inhabitants  of his lands with both cruel and good-natured tyranny. No vagabond ever  passed by the ranch without being rudely assailed by its owner from the  outset.    \"Don't tell me any of your hard-luck stories, friend,\" he would yell as  if he were going to beat him. \"Under the shed is a skinned beast;  cut and eat as much as you wish and so help yourself to continue your  journey. . . . But no more of your yarns!\"    And he would turn his back upon the tramp, after giving him a few  dollars.    One day he became infuriated because a peon was nailing the wire fencing  too deliberately on the posts. Everybody was robbing him! The following  day he spoke of a large sum of money that he would have to pay for  having endorsed the note of an acquaintance, completely bankrupt. \"Poor  fellow! His luck is worse than mine!\"    Upon finding in the road the skeleton of a recently killed sheep, he was  beside himself with indignation. It was not because of the loss of the  meat. \"Hunger knows no law, and God has made meat for mankind to eat.  But they might at least have left the skin!\" . . . And he would rage  against such wickedness, always repeating, \"Lack of religion and good  habits!\" The next time, the bandits stripped the flesh off of three  cows, leaving the skins in full view, and the ranchman said, smiling,  \"That is the way I like people, honorable and doing no wrong.\"    His vigor as a tireless centaur had helped him powerfully in his task  of populating his lands. He was capricious, despotic and with the  same paternal instincts as his compatriots who, centuries before when  conquering the new world, had clarified its native blood. Like the  Castilian conquistadors, he had a fancy for copper-colored beauty with  oblique eyes and straight hair. When Desnoyers saw him going off on some  sudden pretext, putting his horse at full gallop toward a neighboring  ranch, he would say to himself, smilingly, \"He is going in search of a  new peon who will help work his land fifteen years from now.\"    The personnel of the ranch often used to comment on the resemblance of  certain youths laboring here the same as the others, galloping from the  first streak of dawn over the fields, attending to the various duties  of pasturing. The overseer, Celedonio, a half-breed thirty years old,  generally detested for his hard and avaricious character, also bore a  distant resemblance to the patron.    Almost every year, some woman from a great distance, dirty and  bad-faced, presented herself at the ranch, leading by the hand a little  mongrel with eyes like live coals. She would ask to speak with the  proprietor alone, and upon being confronted with her, he usually  recalled a trip made ten or twelve years before in order to buy a herd  of cattle.    \"You remember, Patron, that you passed the night on my ranch because the  river had risen?\"    The Patron did not remember anything about it. But a vague instinct  warned him that the woman was probably telling the truth. \"Well, what of  it?\"    \"Patron, here he is. . . . It is better for him to grow to manhood by  your side than in any other place.\"    And she presented him with the little hybrid. One more, and offered with  such simplicity! . . . \"Lack of religion and good habits!\" Then with  sudden modesty, he doubted the woman's veracity. Why must it necessarily  be his? . . . But his wavering was generally short-lived.    \"If it's mine, put it with the others.\"    The mother went away tranquilly,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1487"],[0,"The Perfect Wagnerite: A Commentary on the Niblung's Ring (#8)"],[1,"es ewig: mit mir nur  rath' ich, red' ich zu dir.\"    But from Brynhild no hero can spring until there is a man of Wotan's  race to breed with her. Wotan wanders further; and a mortal woman bears  him twins: a son and a daughter. He separates them by letting the girl  fall into the hands of a forest tribe which in due time gives her as a  wife to a fierce chief, one Hunding. With the son he himself leads the  life of a wolf, and teaches him the only power a god can teach, the  power of doing without happiness. When he has given him this terrible  training, he abandons him, and goes to the bridal feast of his daughter  Sieglinda and Hunding. In the blue cloak of the wanderer, wearing the  broad hat that flaps over the socket of his forfeited eye, he appears in  Hunding's house, the middle pillar of which is a mighty tree. Into that  tree, without a word, he strikes a sword up to the hilt, so that only  the might of a hero can withdraw it. Then he goes out as silently as he  came, blind to the truth that no weapon from the armory of Godhead can  serve the turn of the true Human Hero. Neither Hunding nor any of his  guests can move the sword; and there it stays awaiting the destined  hand. That is the history of the generations between The Rhine Gold and  The Valkyries.    The First Act    This time, as we sit looking expectantly at the curtain, we hear, not  the deep booming of the Rhine, but the patter of a forest downpour,  accompanied by the mutter of a storm which soon gathers into a roar  and culminates in crashing thunderbolts. As it passes off, the curtain  rises; and there is no mistaking whose forest habitation we are in; for  the central pillar is a mighty tree, and the place fit for the dwelling  of a fierce chief. The door opens: and an exhausted man reels in: an  adept from the school of unhappiness. Sieglinda finds him lying on the  hearth. He explains that he has been in a fight; that his weapons not  being as strong as his arms, were broken; and that he had to fly. He  desires some drink and a moment's rest; then he will go; for he is an  unlucky person, and does not want to bring his ill-luck on the woman  who is succoring him. But she, it appears, is also unhappy; and a strong  sympathy springs up between them. When her husband arrives, he observes  not only this sympathy, but a resemblance between them, a gleam of the  snake in their eyes. They sit down to table; and the stranger tells them  his unlucky story. He is the son of Wotan, who is known to him only as  Wolfing, of the race of the Volsungs. The earliest thing he remembers is  returning from a hunt with his father to find their home destroyed, his  mother murdered, and his twin-sister carried off. This was the work of  a tribe called the Neidings, upon whom he and Wolfing thenceforth waged  implacable war until the day when his father disappeared, leaving no  trace of himself but an empty wolfskin. The young Volsung was thus cast  alone upon the world, finding most hands against him, and bringing no  good luck even to his friends. His latest exploit has been the slaying  of certain brothers who were forcing their sister to wed against her  will. The result has been the slaughter of the woman by her brothers'  clansmen, and his own narrow escape by flight.    His luck on this occasion is even worse than he supposes; for Hunding,  by whose hearth he has taken refuge, is clansman to the slain brothers  and is bound to avenge them. He tells the Volsung that in the morning,  weapons or no weapons, he must fight for his life. Then he orders the  woman to bed, and follows her himself, taking his spear with him.    The unlucky stranger, left brooding by the hearth, has nothing to  console himself with but an old promise of his father's that he shall  find a weapon to his hand when he most needs one. The last flicker of  the dying fire strikes on the golden hilt of the sword that sticks in  the tree; but he does not see it; and the embers sink into blackness.  Then the woman returns. Hunding is safely asleep: she has drugged him.  She tells the story of the one-eyed man who appeared at her forced  marriage, and of the sword. She has always felt, she says, that her  miseries will end in the arms of the hero who shall succeed in drawing  it forth. The stranger, diffident as he is about his luck, has no  misgivings as to his strength and destiny. He gives her his affection at  once, and abandons himself to the charm of the night and the season; for  it is the beginning of Spring. They soon learn from their confidences  that she is his stolen twin-sister. He is transported to find that the  heroic race of the Volsungs need neither perish nor be corrupted by a  lower strain. Hailing the sword by the name of Nothung (or Needed), he  plucks it from the tree as her bride-gift, and then, crying \"Both bride  and sister be of thy brother; and blossom the blood of the Volsungs!\"  clasps her as the mate the Spring has brought him.    The Second Act    So far, Wotan's plan seems prospering. In the mountains he calls his  war-maiden Brynhild, the child borne to him by the First Mother, and  bids her see to it that Hunding shall fall in the approaching combat.  But he is reckoning without his consort, Fricka. What will she, the Law,  say to the lawless pair who have heaped incest on adultery? A hero may  have defied the law, and put his own will in its place; but can a god  hold him guiltless, when the whole power of the gods can enforce itself  only by law? Fricka, shuddering with horror, outraged in every instinct,  comes clamoring for punishment. Wotan pleads the general necessity of  encouraging heroism in order to keep up the Valhalla bodyguard; but his  remonstrances only bring upon him torrents of reproaches for his own  unfaithfulness to the law in roaming through the world and begetting  war-maidens, \"wolf cubs,\" and the like. He is hopelessly beaten in the  argument. Fricka is absolutely right when she declares that the ending  of the gods began when he brought this wolf-hero into the world;  and now, to save their very existence, she pitilessly demands his  destruction. Wotan has no power to refuse: it is Fricka's mechanical  force, and not his thought, that really rules the world. He has to  recall Brynhild; take back his former instructions; and ordain that  Hunding shall slay the Volsung.    But now comes another difficulty. Brynhild is the inner thought and will  of Godhead, the aspiration from the high life to the higher that is its  divine element, and only becomes separated from it when its resort to  kingship and priestcraft for the sake of temporal power has made it  false to itself. Hitherto, Brynhild, as Valkyrie or hero chooser, has  obeyed Wotan implicitly, taking her work as the holiest and bravest in  his kingdom; and now he tells her what he could not tell Fricka--what  indeed he could not tell to Brynhild, were she not, as she says, his  own will--the whole story of Alberic and of that inspiration about the  raising up of a hero. She thoroughly approves of the inspiration; but  when the story ends in the assumption that she too must obey Fricka,  and help Fricka's vassal, Hunding, to undo the great work and strike the  hero down, she for the first time hesitates to accept his command. In  his fury and despair he overawes her by the most terrible threats of his  anger; and she submits.    Then comes the Volsung Siegmund, following his sister bride, who has  fled into the mountains in a revulsion of horror at having allowed  herself to bring her hero to shame. Whilst she is lying exhausted and  senseless in his arms, Brynhild appears to him and solemnly warns him  that he must presently leave the earth with her. He asks whither he must  follow her. To Valhalla, to take his place there among the heroes. He  asks, shall he find his father there? Yes. Shall he find a wife there?  Yes: he will be waited on by beautiful wishmaidens. Shall he meet his  sister there? No. Then, says Siegmund, I will not come with you.    She tries to make him understand that he cannot help himself. Being a  hero, he will not be so persuaded: he has his father's sword, and does  not fear Hunding. But when she tells him that she comes from his father,  and that the sword of a god will not avail in the hands of a hero, he  accepts his fate, but will shape it with his own hand, both for himself  and his sister, by slaying her, and then killing himself with the last  stroke of the sword. And thereafter he will go to Hell, rather than to  Valhalla.    How now can Brynhild, being what she is, choose her side freely in a  conflict between this hero and the vassal of Fricka? By instinct she  at once throws Wotan's command to the winds, and bids Siegmund nerve  himself for the combat with Hunding, in which she pledges him the  protection of her shield. The horn of Hunding is soon heard; and  Siegmund's spirits rise to fighting pitch at once. The two meet; and  the Valkyrie's shield is held before the hero. But when he delivers his  sword-stroke at his foe, the weapon shivers on the spear of Wotan, who  suddenly appears between them; and the first of the race of heroes  falls with the weapon of the Law's vassal through his breast. Brynhild  snatches the fragments of the broken sword, and flies, carrying off the  woman with her on her war-horse; and Wotan, in terrible wrath,  slays Hunding with a wave of his hand, and starts in pursuit of his  disobedient daughter.    The Third Act    On a rocky peak, four of the Valkyries are waiting for the rest. The  absent ones soon arrive, galloping through the air with slain heroes,  gathered from the battle-field, hanging over their saddles. Only,  Brynhild, who comes last, has for her spoil a live woman. When her eight  sisters learn that she has defied Wotan, they dare not help her; and  Brynhild has to rouse Sieglinda to make an effort to save herself, by  reminding her that she bears in her the seed of a hero, and must"]]]
