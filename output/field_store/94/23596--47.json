[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1557"],[0,"Men of Iron (#8)"],[1," boy; thou must not even look  to be taken into the household to serve with gentlemen as the other  squires do serve, but must even live thine own life here and fight thine  own way.\"    Myles's eyes blazed. \"Then,\" cried he, fiercely, \"it is shame and  attaint upon my Lord the Earl, and cowardice as well, and never will I  ask favor of him who is so untrue a friend as to turn his back upon a  comrade in trouble as he turneth his back upon my father.\"    \"Thou art a foolish boy,\" said Sir James with a bitter smile, \"and  knowest naught of the world. An thou wouldst look for man to befriend  man to his own danger, thou must look elsewhere than on this earth. Was  I not one time Mackworth's dear friend as well as thy father? It could  cost him naught to honor me, and here am I fallen to be a teacher of  boys. Go to! thou art a fool.\"    Then, after a little pause of brooding silence, he went on to say that  the Earl was no better or worse than the rest of the world. That men of  his position had many jealous enemies, ever seeking their ruin, and  that such must look first of all each to himself, or else be certainly  ruined, and drag down others in that ruin. Myles was silenced, but the  bitterness had entered his heart, and abided with him for many a day  afterwards.    Perhaps Sir James read his feelings in his frank face, for he sat  looking curiously at him, twirling his grizzled mustache the while.  \"Thou art like to have hard knocks of it, lad, ere thou hast gotten thee  safe through the world,\" said he, with more kindness in his harsh voice  than was usual. \"But get thee not into fights before thy time.\" Then he  charged the boy very seriously to live at peace with his fellow-squires,  and for his father's sake as well as his own to enter into none of the  broils that were so frequent in their quarters.    It was with this special admonition against brawling that Myles was  dismissed, to enter, before five minutes had passed, into the first  really great fight of his life.      Besides Gascoyne and Wilkes, he found gathered in the dormitory six  or eight of the company of squires who were to serve that day upon  household duty; among others, Walter Blunt and three other bachelors,  who were changing their coarse service clothes for others more fit for  the household.    \"Why didst thou tarry so long, Myles?\" said Gascoyne, as he entered.  \"Methought thou wert never coming.\"    \"Where goest thou, Falworth?\" called Blunt from the other end of the  room, where he was lacing his doublet.    Just now Myles had no heart in the swimming or sport of any sort, but he  answered, shortly, \"I go to the river to swim.\"    \"Nay,\" said Blunt, \"thou goest not forth from the castle to-day. Hast  thou forgot how thou didst answer me back about fetching the water  this morning? This day thou must do penance, so go thou straight to the  armory and scour thou up my breastplate.\"    From the time he had arisen that morning everything had gone wrong with  Myles. He had felt himself already outrated in rendering service to  the bachelors, he had quarrelled with the head of the esquires, he had  nearly quarrelled with Gascoyne, and then had come the bitterest and  worst of all, the knowledge that his father was an outlaw, and that  the Earl would not stretch out a hand to aid him or to give him any  countenance. Blunt's words brought the last bitter cut to his heart,  and they stung him to fury. For a while he could not answer, but stood  glaring with a face fairly convulsed with passion at the young man, who  continued his toilet, unconscious of the wrath of the new recruit.    Gascoyne and Wilkes, accepting Myles's punishment as a thing of course,  were about to leave the dormitory when Myles checked them.    \"Stop, Francis!\" he cried, hoarsely. \"Thinkest thou that I will stay  behind to do yon dog's dirty work? No; I go with ye.\"    A moment or two of dumb, silent amazement followed his bold words; then  Blunt cried, \"Art thou mad?\"    \"Nay,\" answered Myles in the same hoarse voice, \"I am not mad. I tell  thee a better man than thou shouldst not stay me from going an I list to  go.    \"I will break thy cockerel head for that speech,\" said Blunt, furiously.  He stooped as he spoke, and picked up a heavy clog that lay at his feet.    It was no insignificant weapon either. The shoes of those days were  sometimes made of cloth, and had long pointed toes stuffed with tow or  wool. In muddy weather thick heavy clogs or wooden soles were strapped,  like a skate, to the bottom of the foot. That clog which Blunt had  seized was perhaps eighteen or twenty inches long, two or two and a half  inches thick at the heel, tapering to a point at the toe. As the older  lad advanced, Gascoyne stepped between him and his victim.    \"Do not harm him, Blunt,\" he pleaded. \"Bear thou in mind how new-come he  is among us. He knoweth not our ways as yet.\"    \"Stand thou back, Gascoyne,\" said Blunt, harshly, as he thrust him  aside. \"I will teach him our ways so that he will not soon forget them.\"    Close to Myles's feet was another clog like that one which Blunt held.  He snatched it up, and set his back against the wall, with a white face  and a heart beating heavily and tumultuously, but with courage steeled  to meet the coming encounter. There was a hard, grim look in his blue  eyes that, for a moment perhaps, quelled the elder lad. He hesitated.  \"Tom! Wat! Ned!\" he called to the other bachelors, \"come hither, and  lend me a hand with this knave.\"    \"An ye come nigh me,\" panted Myles, \"I will brain the first within  reach.\"    Then Gascoyne dodged behind the others, and, without being seen, slipped  out of the room for help.    The battle that followed was quick, sharp, and short. As Blunt strode  forward, Myles struck, and struck with might and main, but he was too  excited to deliver his blow with calculation. Blunt parried it with the  clog he held, and the next instant, dropping his weapon, gripped Myles  tight about the body, pinning his arms to his sides.    Myles also dropped the clog he held, and, wrenching out his right  arm with a sudden heave, struck Blunt full in the face, and then with  another blow sent him staggering back. It all passed in an instant; the  next the three other bachelors were upon him, catching him by the body,  the arms, the legs. For a moment or two they swayed and stumbled hither  and thither, and then down they fell in a struggling heap.    Myles fought like a wild-cat, kicking, struggling, scratching; striking  with elbows and fists. He caught one of the three by his collar, and  tore his jacket open from the neck to the waist; he drove his foot into  the pit of the stomach of another, and knocked him breathless. The other  lads not in the fight stood upon the benches and the beds around, but  such was the awe inspired by the prestige of the bachelors that not one  of them dared to lend hand to help him, and so Myles fought his fierce  battle alone.    But four to one were odds too great, and though Myles struggled as  fiercely as ever, by-and-by it was with less and less resistance.    Blunt had picked up the clog he had dropped when he first attacked the  lad, and now stood over the struggling heap, white with rage, the blood  running from his lip, cut and puffed where Myles had struck him, and  murder looking out from his face, if ever it looked out of the face of  any mortal being.    \"Hold him a little,\" said he, fiercely, \"and I will still him for you.\"    Even yet it was no easy matter for the others to do his bidding, but  presently he got his chance and struck a heavy, cruel blow at Myles's  head. Myles only partly warded it with his arm. Hitherto he had fought  in silence, now he gave a harsh cry.    \"Holy Saints!\" cried Edmund Wilkes. \"They will kill him.\"    Blunt struck two more blows, both of them upon the body, and then at  last they had the poor boy down, with his face upon the ground and his  arms pinned to his sides, and Blunt, bracing himself for the stroke,  with a grin of rage raised a heavy clog for one terrible blow that  should finish the fight.        CHAPTER 9    \"How now, messieurs?\" said a harsh voice, that fell upon the turmoil  like a thunder-clap, and there stood Sir James Lee. Instantly the  struggle ceased, and the combatants scrambled to their feet.    The older lads stood silent before their chief, but Myles was deaf and  blind and mad with passion, he knew not where he stood or what he said  or did. White as death, he stood for a while glaring about him, catching  his breath convulsively. Then he screamed hoarsely.    \"Who struck me? Who struck me when I was down? I will have his blood  that struck me!\" He caught sight of Blunt. \"It was he that struck me!\"  he cried. \"Thou foul traitor! thou coward!\" and thereupon leaped at his  enemy like a wild-cat.    \"Stop!\" cried Sir James Lee, clutching him by the arm.    Myles was too blinded by his fury to see who it was that held him. \"I  will not stop!\" he cried, struggling and striking at the knight. \"Let me  go! I will have his life that struck me when I was down!\"    The next moment he found himself pinned close against the wall, and  then, as though his sight came back, he saw the grim face of the old  one-eyed knight looking into his.    \"Dost thou know who I am?\" said a stern, harsh voice.    Instantly Myles ceased struggling, and his arms fell at his side. \"Aye,\"  he said, in a gasping voice, \"I know thee.\" He swallowed spasmodically  for a moment or two, and then, in the sudden revulsion of feeling, burst  out sobbing convulsively.    Sir James marched the two off to his office, he himself walking  between them, holding an arm of each, the other lads following behind,  awe-struck and silent. Entering the office, Sir James shut the door  behind him, leaving the group of squires clustered outside about the  stone steps, speculating in whispers as to what would be the outcome of  the matter.    After Sir James had seated"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15580"],[0,"The Rustlers of Pecos County (#8)"],[1,"to place, corner to corner, bar to bar, watching,  listening, recording; and not until long after sunset did I go out to  the ranch.    The excitement had preceded me and speculation was rife. Hurrying  through my supper, to get away from questions and to go on with my  spying, I went out to the front of the house.    The evening was warm; the doors were open; and in the twilight the only  lamps that had been lit were in Sampson's big sitting room at the far  end of the house. Neither Sampson nor Wright had come home to supper.    I would have given much to hear their talk right then, and certainly  intended to try to hear it when they did come home.    When the buckboard drove up and they alighted I was well hidden in the  bushes, so well screened that I could get but a fleeting glimpse of  Sampson as he went in.    For all I could see, he appeared to be a calm and quiet man, intense  beneath the surface, with an air of dignity under insult. My chance to  observe Wright was lost.    They went into the house without speaking, and closed the door.    At the other end of the porch, close under a window, was an offset  between step and wall, and there in the shadow I hid. If Sampson or  Wright visited the girls that evening I wanted to hear what was said  about Steele.    It seemed to me that it might be a good clue for me--the circumstance  whether or not Diane Sampson was told the truth. So I waited there in  the darkness with patience born of many hours of like duty.    Presently the small lamp was lit--I could tell the difference in light  when the big one was burning--and I heard the swish of skirts.    \"Something's happened, surely, Sally,\" I heard Miss Sampson say  anxiously. \"Papa just met me in the hall and didn't speak. He seemed  pale, worried.\"    \"Cousin George looked like a thundercloud,\" said Sally. \"For once, he  didn't try to kiss me. Something's happened. Well, Diane, this has been  a bad day for me, too.\"    Plainly I heard Sally's sigh, and the little pathetic sound brought me  vividly out of my sordid business of suspicion and speculation. So she  was sorry.    \"Bad for you, too?\" replied Diane in amused surprise. \"Oh, I see--I  forgot. You and Russ had it out.\"    \"Out? We fought like the very old deuce. I'll never speak to him again.\"    \"So your little--affair with Russ is all over?\"    \"Yes.\" Here she sighed again.    \"Well, Sally, it began swiftly and it's just as well short,\" said Diane  earnestly. \"We know nothing at all of Russ.\"    \"Diane, after to-day I respect him in--in spite of things--even though  he seems no good. I--I cared a lot, too.\"    \"My dear, your loves are like the summer flowers. I thought maybe your  flirting with Russ might amount to something. Yet he seems so different  now from what he was at first. It's only occasionally I get the  impression I had of him after that night he saved me from violence. He's  strange. Perhaps it all comes of his infatuation for you. He is in love  with you. I'm afraid of what may come of it.\"    \"Diane, he'll do something dreadful to George, mark my words,\"  whispered Sally. \"He swore he would if George fooled around me any  more.\"    \"Oh, dear. Sally, what can we do? These are wild men. George makes life  miserable for me. And he teases you unmer...\"    \"I don't call it teasing. George wants to spoon,\" declared Sally  emphatically. \"He'd run after any woman.\"    \"A fine compliment to me, Cousin Sally,\" laughed Diane.    \"I don't agree,\" replied Sally stubbornly. \"It's so. He's spoony. And  when he's been drinking and tries to kiss me, I hate him.\"    \"Sally, you look as if you'd rather like Russ to do something dreadful  to George,\" said Diane with a laugh that this time was only half mirth.    \"Half of me would and half of me would not,\" returned Sally. \"But all  of me would if I weren't afraid of Russ. I've got a feeling--I don't  know what--something will happen between George and Russ some day.\"    There were quick steps on the hall floor, steps I thought I recognized.    \"Hello, girls!\" sounded out Wright's voice, minus its usual gaiety. Then  ensued a pause that made me bring to mind a picture of Wright's glum  face.    \"George, what's the matter?\" asked Diane presently. \"I never saw papa as  he is to-night, nor you so--so worried. Tell me, what has happened?\"    \"Well, Diane, we had a jar to-day,\" replied Wright, with a blunt,  expressive laugh.    \"Jar?\" echoed both the girls curiously.    \"Jar? We had to submit to a damnable outrage,\" added Wright  passionately, as if the sound of his voice augmented his feeling.  \"Listen, girls. I'll tell you all about it.\"    He coughed, clearing his throat in a way that betrayed he had been  drinking.    I sunk deeper in the shadow of my covert, and stiffening my muscles for  a protracted spell of rigidity, prepared to listen with all acuteness  and intensity.    Just one word from this Wright, inadvertently uttered in a moment of  passion, might be the word Steele needed for his clue.    \"It happened at the town hall,\" began Wright rapidly. \"Your father and  Judge Owens and I were there in consultation with three ranchers from  out of town. First we were disturbed by gunshots from somewhere, but not  close at hand. Then we heard the loud voices outside.    \"A crowd was coming down street. It stopped before the hall. Men came  running in, yelling. We thought there was a fire. Then that Ranger,  Steele, stalked in, dragging a fellow by the name of Snell. We couldn't  tell what was wanted because of the uproar. Finally your father restored  order.    \"Steele had arrested Snell for alleged assault on a restaurant keeper  named Hoden. It developed that Hoden didn't accuse anybody, didn't know  who attacked him. Snell, being obviously innocent, was discharged. Then  this--this gun fighting Ranger pulled his guns on the court and halted  the proceedings.\"    When Wright paused I plainly heard his intake of breath. Far indeed was  he from calm.    \"Steele held everybody in that hall in fear of death, and he began  shouting his insults. Law was a farce in Linrock. The court was a farce.  There was no law. Your father's office as mayor should be impeached. He  made arrests only for petty offenses. He was afraid of the rustlers,  highwaymen, murderers. He was afraid or--he just let them alone. He used  his office to cheat ranchers and cattlemen in law-suits.    \"All of this Steele yelled for everyone to hear. A damnable outrage!  Your father, Diane, insulted in his own court by a rowdy Ranger! Not  only insulted, but threatened with death--two big guns thrust almost  in his face!\"    \"Oh! How horrible!\" cried Diane, in mingled distress and anger.    \"Steele's a Ranger. The Ranger Service wants to rule western Texas,\"  went on Wright. \"These Rangers are all a low set, many of them worse  than the outlaws they hunt. Some of them were outlaws and gun fighters  before they became Rangers.    \"This Steele is one of the worst of the lot. He's keen, intelligent,  smooth, and that makes him more to be feared. For he is to be feared. He  wanted to kill. He meant to kill. If your father had made the least move  Steele would have shot him. He's a cold-nerved devil--the born gunman.  My God, any instant I expected to see your father fall dead at my feet!\"    \"Oh, George! The--the unspeakable ruffian!\" cried Diane, passionately.    \"You see, Diane, this fellow Steele has failed here in Linrock. He's  been here weeks and done nothing. He must have got desperate. He's  infamous and he loves his name. He seeks notoriety. He made that play  with Snell just for a chance to rant against your father. He tried to  inflame all Linrock against him. That about law-suits was the worst!  Damn him! He'll make us enemies.\"    \"What do you care for the insinuations of such a man?\" said Diane  Sampson, her voice now deep and rich with feeling. \"After a moment's  thought no one will be influenced by them. Do not worry, George, tell  papa not to worry. Surely after all these years he can't be injured in  reputation by--by an adventurer.\"    \"Yes, he can be injured,\" replied George quickly. \"The frontier is a  queer place. There are many bitter men here, men who have failed at  ranching. And your father has been wonderfully successful. Steele has  dropped some poison, and it'll spread.\"    Then followed a silence, during which, evidently, the worried Wright  bestrode the floor.    \"Cousin George, what became of Steele and his prisoner?\" suddenly asked  Sally.    How like her it was, with her inquisitive bent of mind and shifting  points of view, to ask a question the answering of which would be gall  and wormwood to Wright!    It amused while it thrilled me. Sally might be a flirt, but she was no  fool.    \"What became of them? Ha! Steele bluffed the whole town--at least all of  it who had heard the mayor's order to discharge Snell,\" growled Wright.  \"He took Snell--rode off for Del Rio to jail him.\"    \"George!\" exclaimed Diane. \"Then, after all, this Ranger was able to  arrest Snell, the innocent man father discharged, and take him to jail?\"    \"Exactly. That's the toughest part....\" Wright ended abruptly, and then  broke out fiercely: \"But, by God, he'll never come back!\"    Wright's slow pacing quickened and he strode from the parlor, leaving  behind him a silence eloquent of the effect of his sinister prediction.    \"Sally, what did he mean?\" asked Diane in a low voice.    \"Steele will be killed,\" replied Sally, just as low-voiced.    \"Killed! That magnificent fellow! Ah, I forgot. Sally, my wits are sadly  mixed. I ought to be glad if somebody kills my father's defamer. But,  oh, I can't be!    \"This bloody frontier makes me sick. Papa doesn't want me to stay for  good. And no wonder. Shall I go back? I hate to show a white feather.    \"Do you know, Sally, I was--a little taken with this Texas Ranger.  Miserably, I confess. He seemed so like in spirit to the grand stature  of him. How can so splendid a man be so bloody,"]]]
