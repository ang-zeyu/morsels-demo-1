Though the contrivance is an awkward one,  we cannot help thinking the excuse of the Lieutenant was weak, but the  result was a failure on his part to carry out the important work  assigned to him.    Captain Jones was a different kind of man. Although day had fully  dawned, he kept his men rowing rapidly. Reaching the south side of the  harbor, he came upon a small fort garrisoned by a few soldiers. Leaping  out of the boat, the American dashed forward, bounded over the walls and  captured the sentinels before they knew their danger. The guns were  spiked and the garrison made prisoners.    \"Set fire to the shipping!\" he commanded to his men, while he, with only  a single companion, ran for a second fort some distance away and spiked  the guns in that. Then he hurried back to the first fort and found to  his surprise that the fire had not been started.    \"The candles have given out,\" was the reply to his angry inquiry.    It being broad daylight, his men expected him to jump into the boat and  order them to return with all haste to the ship; but, instead of doing  so, he darted into one of the nearest houses, procured some tinder and  candles and began himself the work of destruction. Fixing his attention  upon a large vessel, he climbed quickly aboard and started a fire in her  steerage. To help matters, he flung a barrel of tar over the flames and  in a few minutes they were roaring fiercely. It meant prodigious damage,  for the vessel was surrounded by more than a hundred others, none of  which could move, since they were aground and the tide was out.    As may be supposed, there was great excitement by that time. The alarm  had been given. Men were running to and fro, and a number hurried toward  the burning ship with the purpose of extinguishing the flames. All the  Americans had entered the small boat and were impatiently awaiting their  commander. Instead of joining them, Jones drew his pistol, and, standing  alone in front of the crowd, kept them back until the fire burst out of  the steerage and began running up the rigging. Backing slowly with drawn  pistol, he stepped into the boat and told his men to row with might and  main for the vessel.    The instant this was done the crowd rushed forward and by desperate  efforts succeeded in putting out the blaze before it had done much  damage. Then the forts attempted to fire on the Americans, but their  guns were spiked. Some cannon on the ships were discharged at the boats,  but their shots went wild. When the _Ranger_ was reached Captain Jones  made the discovery that one of his men was missing. The reason was  clear. He was a deserter and had been seen by his former comrades  running from house to house and giving the alarm. Such was the narrow  chance by which one of the most destructive conflagrations of British  shipping was averted.    As may be supposed, this daring act caused alarm throughout England.  Jones was denounced as a freebooter and pirate, and every effort was  made to capture him. Had his enemies succeeded, little mercy would have  been shown the dauntless hero.    England was very cruel to many of her American prisoners, and Captain  Jones fixed upon a bold and novel plan for compelling her to show more  mercy toward those unfortunate enough to fall into her power. It was to  capture some prominent nobleman and hold him as a hostage for the better  treatment of our countrymen. It must be remembered that Jones was  cruising near his birthplace and when a sailor boy had become familiar  with the Scottish and the English coasts. The _Ranger_ was a fast  vessel, and, as I have shown, Jones himself was a master of seamanship.  It would seem, therefore, that all he had to do was to be alert, and it  need not be said that he and his crew were vigilant at all times.    The Earl of Selkirk was a Scottish nobleman who had his country seat at  the mouth of the Dee, and Jones made up his mind that he was just the  man to serve for a hostage. At any rate, he could not be put to a  better use and certainly would not suspect the purpose of the American  vessel which, as night was closing in, anchored offshore. Indeed, no one  dreamed that the vessel was the terrible American \"pirate,\" which had  thrown the whole country into terror.    Fortunately the night was dark and the men rowed to land without being  noticed. The task was an easy one, for there was no one to resist them.  They walked silently through the darkness to the fine grounds, and,  having surrounded the handsome building, the officer in charge of the  party presented himself at the door and made known his startling errand.  He was informed that the Earl was absent. A careful search revealed that  such was the fact, and all the trouble of the Americans went for naught.    It was a keen disappointment and the party decided to compensate  themselves so far as they could. The Earl was wealthy and the house  contained a great deal of valuable silver plate. A quantity of this was  carried to the _Ranger_.    Captain Jones was angered when he learned what had been done. He knew  the Earl and Lady Selkirk well and personally liked them both. The  singular scheme he had in mind was solely for the benefit of his adopted  countrymen.    \"I am accused of being a pirate, robber and thief,\" he exclaimed, \"and  you are doing all you can to justify the charges. Every ounce of plate  shall be returned.\"    He kept his word. The messengers who took back the silver carried a note  from Captain Jones apologizing to Lady Selkirk for the misconduct of his  men.    Now, if there was anything which Paul Jones loved it was to fight. It  was simply diversion for him to capture merchantmen or vessels that  could make only a weak resistance, and he longed to give the enemy a  taste of his mettle. It may be said that his situation grew more  dangerous with every hour. His presence was known and a score of  cruisers were hunting for him.    The British sloop of war _Drake_, which the gale prevented him from  attacking, was still at Carrickfergus, and Jones sailed thither in the  hope of inducing her to come out and fight him. Being uncertain of his  identity, the captain of the _Drake_ sent an officer in a boat to learn  the truth. Captain Jones suspected the errand and skilfully kept his  broadsides turned away until the officer, determined to know his  identity, went aboard. As soon as he stepped on deck he was made a  prisoner and sent below.    Captain Jones reasoned that the captain of the _Drake_ would miss his  officer after awhile and come out to learn what had become of him. He,  therefore, headed toward the North Channel, the _Drake_ following, with  the tide against her and the wind unfavorable until the mid-channel was  reached, when, to quote Maclay, Paul Jones \"in plain view of three  kingdoms, hove to, ran up the flag of the new Republic and awaited the  enemy.\"    In reply to the demand of the _Drake's_ captain, Jones gave the name of  his vessel and expressed the pleasure it would give him to engage him in  battle. The American was astern of the _Drake_, and, to show his  earnestness, Captain Jones ordered his helm put up and let fly with a  broadside. The _Drake_ replied and then the battle was on. There was  little manoeuvring, the contest being what is known as a square  yardarm and yardarm fight.    The comparative strength of the two vessels was as follows: The _Ranger_  carried 18 guns and 123 men, the _Drake_ 20 guns and 160 men, a number  of the latter being volunteers for the fight, which lasted one hour and  four minutes, at the end of which time the _Ranger_ had lost two killed  and six wounded and the _Drake_ forty-two killed. The latter was so  badly damaged by the well directed fire of the American that the captain  called for quarter. Ceasing her firing, Captain Jones lowered a boat  and sent it to the _Drake_ to take possession.    As an evidence of the effect of the fire of the _Ranger_, the following  words may be quoted from Jones's official report: \"Her fore and  maintopsail yards being cut away and down on the caps, the topgallant  yard and mizzen gaff both hanging up and down along the mast, the second  ensign which they had hoisted shot away and hanging on the quarter  gallery in the water, the jib shot away and hanging in the water, her  sails and rigging cut entirely to pieces, her masts and yards all  wounded and her hull very much galled.\"    The damages to the _Ranger_ were so slight they were repaired by the  close of the following day, when she got under sail with her prize.  Despite the swarm of cruisers that were hunting for him, Jones passed  unscathed through North Channel, along the western coast of Ireland and  arrived at Brest, in France, within a month of the day he left the port,  his cruise having been one of the most remarkable in naval history.          CHAPTER VI.      One of the Most Memorable Sea Fights Ever Known--The Wonderful Exploit  of Captain Paul Jones.        I have taken Paul Jones as the highest type of the infant American navy.  There were others who fought with great bravery and did much to aid in  the struggle for American independence, but none combined in such  perfection the qualities of perfect seamanship, cool but dauntless  courage and skill in fighting.    Of course, no matter how daring our cruisers, they did not always escape  disaster. At the close of the Revolution there had been twenty-four  vessels lost, carrying 470 guns. Several of these met their fate through  shipwreck. Contrast with this the loss of Great Britain, which was 102  war vessels, carrying in all 2,624 guns. The total vessels of all kinds  captured from the English by our cruisers and privateers was about 800.    Captain Jones had made so successful a cruise with the _Ranger_ that he  felt, upon returning to Brest, in France, he was entitled to a better  ship. He wrote to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1726"],[0,"Theaetetus (#8)"],[1,"that  which we think, and we cannot know and be ignorant at the same time; we  cannot confuse one thing which we do not know, with another thing which  we do not know; nor can we think that which we do not know to be that  which we know, or that which we know to be that which we do not know.  And what other case is conceivable, upon the supposition that we either  know or do not know all things? Let us try another answer in the sphere  of being: 'When a man thinks, and thinks that which is not.' But would  this hold in any parallel case? Can a man see and see nothing? or hear  and hear nothing? or touch and touch nothing? Must he not see, hear, or  touch some one existing thing? For if he thinks about nothing he does  not think, and not thinking he cannot think falsely. And so the path of  being is closed against us, as well as the path of knowledge. But may  there not be 'heterodoxy,' or transference of opinion;--I mean, may not  one thing be supposed to be another? Theaetetus is confident that this  must be 'the true falsehood,' when a man puts good for evil or evil  for good. Socrates will not discourage him by attacking the paradoxical  expression 'true falsehood,' but passes on. The new notion involves a  process of thinking about two things, either together or alternately.  And thinking is the conversing of the mind with herself, which is  carried on in question and answer, until she no longer doubts, but  determines and forms an opinion. And false opinion consists in saying to  yourself, that one thing is another. But did you ever say to yourself,  that good is evil, or evil good? Even in sleep, did you ever imagine  that odd was even? Or did any man in his senses ever fancy that an ox  was a horse, or that two are one? So that we can never think one thing  to be another; for you must not meet me with the verbal quibble that  one--eteron--is other--eteron (both 'one' and 'other' in Greek are  called 'other'--eteron). He who has both the two things in his mind,  cannot misplace them; and he who has only one of them in his mind,  cannot misplace them--on either supposition transplacement is  inconceivable.    But perhaps there may still be a sense in which we can think that  which we do not know to be that which we know: e.g. Theaetetus may know  Socrates, but at a distance he may mistake another person for him. This  process may be conceived by the help of an image. Let us suppose that  every man has in his mind a block of wax of various qualities, the gift  of Memory, the mother of the Muses; and on this he receives the seal or  stamp of those sensations and perceptions which he wishes to remember.  That which he succeeds in stamping is remembered and known by him as  long as the impression lasts; but that, of which the impression is  rubbed out or imperfectly made, is forgotten, and not known. No one can  think one thing to be another, when he has the memorial or seal of both  of these in his soul, and a sensible impression of neither; or when he  knows one and does not know the other, and has no memorial or seal of  the other; or when he knows neither; or when he perceives both, or one  and not the other, or neither; or when he perceives and knows both,  and identifies what he perceives with what he knows (this is still more  impossible); or when he does not know one, and does not know and does  not perceive the other; or does not perceive one, and does not know  and does not perceive the other; or has no perception or knowledge  of either--all these cases must be excluded. But he may err when he  confuses what he knows or perceives, or what he perceives and does not  know, with what he knows, or what he knows and perceives with what he  knows and perceives.    Theaetetus is unable to follow these distinctions; which Socrates  proceeds to illustrate by examples, first of all remarking, that  knowledge may exist without perception, and perception without  knowledge. I may know Theodorus and Theaetetus and not see them; I  may see them, and not know them. 'That I understand.' But I could not  mistake one for the other if I knew you both, and had no perception of  either; or if I knew one only, and perceived neither; or if I knew  and perceived neither, or in any other of the excluded cases. The only  possibility of error is: 1st, when knowing you and Theodorus, and having  the impression of both of you on the waxen block, I, seeing you both  imperfectly and at a distance, put the foot in the wrong shoe--that  is to say, put the seal or stamp on the wrong object: or 2ndly, when  knowing both of you I only see one; or when, seeing and knowing you  both, I fail to identify the impression and the object. But there could  be no error when perception and knowledge correspond.    The waxen block in the heart of a man's soul, as I may say in the words  of Homer, who played upon the words ker and keros, may be smooth and  deep, and large enough, and then the signs are clearly marked and  lasting, and do not get confused. But in the 'hairy heart,' as the  all-wise poet sings, when the wax is muddy or hard or moist, there is  a corresponding confusion and want of retentiveness; in the muddy and  impure there is indistinctness, and still more in the hard, for there  the impressions have no depth of wax, and in the moist they are too  soon effaced. Yet greater is the indistinctness when they are all jolted  together in a little soul, which is narrow and has no room. These are  the sort of natures which have false opinion; from stupidity they see  and hear and think amiss; and this is falsehood and ignorance. Error,  then, is a confusion of thought and sense.    Theaetetus is delighted with this explanation. But Socrates has no  sooner found the new solution than he sinks into a fit of despondency.  For an objection occurs to him:--May there not be errors where there is  no confusion of mind and sense? e.g. in numbers. No one can confuse  the man whom he has in his thoughts with the horse which he has in his  thoughts, but he may err in the addition of five and seven. And observe  that these are purely mental conceptions. Thus we are involved once more  in the dilemma of saying, either that there is no such thing as false  opinion, or that a man knows what he does not know.    We are at our wit's end, and may therefore be excused for making a  bold diversion. All this time we have been repeating the words 'know,'  'understand,' yet we do not know what knowledge is. 'Why, Socrates,  how can you argue at all without using them?' Nay, but the true hero  of dialectic would have forbidden me to use them until I had explained  them. And I must explain them now. The verb 'to know' has two senses,  to have and to possess knowledge, and I distinguish 'having' from  'possessing.' A man may possess a garment which he does not wear; or he  may have wild birds in an aviary; these in one sense he possesses, and  in another he has none of them. Let this aviary be an image of the mind,  as the waxen block was; when we are young, the aviary is empty; after  a time the birds are put in; for under this figure we may describe  different forms of knowledge;--there are some of them in groups, and  some single, which are flying about everywhere; and let us suppose  a hunt after the science of odd and even, or some other science. The  possession of the birds is clearly not the same as the having them in  the hand. And the original chase of them is not the same as taking them  in the hand when they are already caged.    This distinction between use and possession saves us from the absurdity  of supposing that we do not know what we know, because we may know in  one sense, i.e. possess, what we do not know in another, i.e. use. But  have we not escaped one difficulty only to encounter a greater? For how  can the exchange of two kinds of knowledge ever become false opinion?  As well might we suppose that ignorance could make a man know, or that  blindness could make him see. Theaetetus suggests that in the aviary  there may be flying about mock birds, or forms of ignorance, and we  put forth our hands and grasp ignorance, when we are intending to grasp  knowledge. But how can he who knows the forms of knowledge and the forms  of ignorance imagine one to be the other? Is there some other form of  knowledge which distinguishes them? and another, and another? Thus we go  round and round in a circle and make no progress.    All this confusion arises out of our attempt to explain false opinion  without having explained knowledge. What then is knowledge? Theaetetus  repeats that knowledge is true opinion. But this seems to be refuted by  the instance of orators and judges. For surely the orator cannot convey  a true knowledge of crimes at which the judges were not present; he  can only persuade them, and the judge may form a true opinion and truly  judge. But if true opinion were knowledge they could not have judged  without knowledge.    Once more. Theaetetus offers a definition which he has heard: Knowledge  is true opinion accompanied by definition or explanation. Socrates has  had a similar dream, and has further heard that the first elements are  names only, and that definition or explanation begins when they are  combined; the letters are unknown, the syllables or combinations  are known. But this new hypothesis when tested by the letters of the  alphabet is found to break down. The first syllable of Socrates' name  is SO. But what is SO? Two letters, S and O, a sibilant and a vowel,  of which no further explanation can be given. And how can any one  be ignorant of either of them, and yet know both of them? There is,  however, another alternative:--We may suppose that the syllable has a  separate form or idea distinct from the letters or parts. The all of the  parts may not be the whole. Theaetetus is very much inclined to adopt  this suggestion, but when interrogated by Socrates he is unable to  draw any distinction between the whole"]]]
