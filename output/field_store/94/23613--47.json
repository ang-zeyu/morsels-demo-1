Surely you forgive me, or at least excuse me.  Do not you? Here was this fast steamer under me. I ought not to be in  Bahia before October 25. It was June 1. Of course we went to Upernavik.    I will not say I regret it now. Yet I will say that on that decision,  cautiously made, though it was \"on my discretion,\" all our subsequent  misfortunes hang. The Danes were kind to us,--the Governor especially,  though I had to carry the poor fellow bad news about the Duchies and the  Danish war, which was all fresh then. He got up a dance for us, I  remember, and there I wrote No. 1 to you. I could not of course  help--when we left him--running her up a few degrees to the north, just  to see whether there is or is not that passage between Igloolik and  Prince Rupert's Headland (and by the way there _is_). After we passed  Igloolik, there was such splendid weather, that I just used up a little  coal to drive her along the coast of King William's Land; and there, as  we waited for little duck-shooting on the edge of a floe one day, as our  luck ordered, a party of natives came on board, and we treated them with  hard-tack crumbs and whale-oil. They fell to dancing, and we to  laughing,--they danced more and we laughed more, till the oldest woman  tumbled in her bear-skin bloomers, and came with a smash right on the  little cast-iron frame by the wheel, which screened binnacle and  compass. My dear child, there was such a hullalu and such a mess  together as I remember now. We had to apologize, the doctor set her  head as well as he could. We gave them gingerbread from the cabin, to  console them, and got them off without a fight. But the next morning  when I cast off from the floe, it proved the beggars had stolen the  compass card, needle and all.    My dear Mary, there was not another bit of magnetized iron in the ship.  The government had been very shy of providing instruments of any kind  for Confederate cruisers. Poor Ethan had traded off two compasses only  the day before for whalebone spears and skin breeches, neither of which  knew the north star from the ace of spades. And this thing proved of  more importance than you will think; it really made me feel that the  stuff in the books and the sermons about the mariners' needle was not  quite poetry.    As you shall see, if I ever get through. (Since I began, I have seen the  Consul,--and heard the glorious news from home,--and am to be presented  to the port authorities to-morrow.) It was the most open summer, Mary,  ever known there. If I had not had to be here in October, I would have  driven right through Lancaster Sound, by Baring's Island, and come out  into the Pacific. But here was the honor of the country, and we merely  stole back through the Straits. It was well enough there,--all daylight,  you know. But after we passed Cape Farewell, we worked her into such  fogs, child, as you never saw out of Hyde Park. Did not I long for that  compass-card! We sailed, and we sailed, and we sailed. For thirty-seven  days I did not get an observation, nor speak a ship! October! It was  October before we were warm. At noon we used to sail where we thought it  was lightest. At night I used to keep two men up for a lookout, lash the  wheel, and let her drift like a Dutchman. One way as good as another.  Mary, when I saw the sun at last, enough to get any kind of observation,  we were wellnigh three hundred miles northeast of Iceland! Talk of fogs  to me!    Well, I set her south again, but how long can you know if you are  sailing south, in those places where the northeast winds and Scotch  mists come from! Thank Heaven, we got south, or we should have frozen to  death. We got into November, and we got into December. We were as far  south as 37 deg. 29'; and were in 31 deg. 17' west on New Year's Day, 1866, when  the second officer wished me a happy new year, congratulated me on the  fine weather, said we should get a good observation, and asked me for  the new nautical almanac! You know they are only calculated for five  years. We had two Greenwich ones on board, and they ran out December 31,  1865. But the government had been as stingy in almanacs as in coal and  compasses. They did not mean to keep the Confederacy in almanacs.    That was the beginning of our troubles. I had to take the old almanac,  with Prendergast, and we figured like Cocker, and always kept ahead with  a month's tables. But somehow,--I feel sure we were right,--but  something was wrong; and after a few weeks the lunars used to come out  in the most beastly way, and we always proved to be on the top of the  Andes or in the Marquesas Islands, or anywhere but in the Atlantic  Ocean. Well then, by good luck, we spoke the Winged Batavian; could not  speak a word of Dutch, nor he a word of English; but he let Ethan copy  his tables, and so we ran for St. Sacrament. I posted 8, 9, and 10  there; I gave the Dutchman 7, which I hope you got, but fear.    Well, this story is running long; but at St. Sacrament we started again,  but, as ill-luck would have it, without a clean bill of health. At that  time I could have run into Bahia with coal--of which I had bought  some--in a week. But there was fever on shore,--and bad,--and I knew we  must make pratique when we came into the outer harbor here; so, rather  than do that, we stretched down the coast, and met that cyclone I wrote  you about, and had to put into Loando. Understand, this was the first  time we went into Loando. I have learned that wretched hole well enough  since. And it was as we were running out of Loando, that, in reversing  the engine too suddenly, lest we should smash up an old Portuguese  woman's bum-boat, that the slides or supports of the piston-rod just  shot out of the grooves they run in on the top, came cleverly down on  the outside of the carriage, gave that odious _g-r-r-r_, which I can  hear now, and then, _dump_,--down came the whole weight of the  walking-beam, bent rod and carriages all into three figure 8's, and  there we were! I had as lief run the boat with a clothes-wringer as with  that engine, any day, from then to now.    Well, we tinkered, and the Portuguese dock-yard people tinkered. We took  out this, and they took out that. It was growing sickly, and I got  frightened, and finally I shipped the propeller and took it on board,  and started under such canvas as we had left,--not much after the  cyclone,--for the North and the South together had rather rotted the  original duck.    Then,--as I wrote you in No. 11,--it was too late to get to Bahia before  that summer's sickly season, and I stretched off to cooler regions  again, \"in my best discretion.\" That was the time when we had the fever  so horribly on board; and but for Wilder the surgeon, and the Falkland  Islands, we should be dead, every man of us, now. But we touched in  Queen's Bay just in time. The Governor (who is his own only subject) was  very cordial and jolly and kind. We all went ashore, and pitched tents,  and ate ducks and penguins till the men grew strong. I scraped her,  nearly down to the bends, for the grass floated by our side like a  mermaid's hair as we sailed, and the once swift Florida would not make  four knots an hour on the wind;--and this was the ship I was to get into  Bahia in good order, at my best discretion!    Meanwhile none of these people had any news from America. The last  paper at the Falkland Islands was a London Times of 1864, abusing the  Yankees. As for the Portuguese, they were like the people Logan saw at  Vicksburg. \"They don't know anything good!\" said he; \"they don't know  anything at all!\" It was really more for news than for water I put into  Sta. Lucia,--and a pretty mess I made of it there. We looked so like  pirates (as at bottom the old tub is), that they took all of us who  landed to the guard-house. None of us could speak Sta. Lucia, whatever  that tongue may be, nor understand it. And it was not till Ethan fired a  shell from the 100-pound Parrott over the town that they let us go. I  hope the dogs sent you my letters. I suppose there was another  infringement of neutrality. But if the Brazilian government sends this  ship to Sta. Lucia, I shall not command her, that's all!    Well! what happened at Loando the second time, Valencia, and Puntos  Pimos, and Nueva Salamanca, and Loando this last time, you know and will  know, and why we loitered so. At last, thank fortune, here we are.  Actually, Mary, this ship logged on the average only thirty-two knots a  day for the last week before we got her into port.    Now think of the ingratitude of men! I have brought her in here,  \"according to my best discretion,\" and do you believe, these hidalgos,  or dons, or senores, or whatever they are, had forgotten she existed.  And when I showed them to her, they said in good Portugal that I was a  liar. Fortunately the Consul is our old friend Kingsley. He was  delighted to see me; thought I was at the bottom of the sea. From him we  learned that the Confederacy was blown sky-high long ago. And from all I  can learn, I may have the Florida back again for my own private yacht or  peculium, unless she goes to Sta. Lucia.    Not I, my friends! Scrape her, and mend her, and give her to the  marines,--and tell them her story; but do not intrust her again to my  own Polly's own    FREDERIC INGHAM          A PIECE OF POSSIBLE HISTORY.      [This essay was first published in the Monthly Religious Magazine,  Boston, for October, 1851. One or another professor of chronology has  since taken pains to tell me that it is impossible. But until they  satisfy themselves whether Homer ever lived at all, I shall hold to the  note which I wrote to Miss Dryasdust's cousin, which I printed  originally at the end of the article, and which will be found there in  this collection. The difficulties in the geography are perhaps worse  than those of chronology.]        "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15869"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World Volume 2 (#8)"],[1,"S.E. by S. The nearest to us we reached by ten  o'clock, and not being able to weather it, we tacked a mile from its shore  in fourteen fathoms water. This island is about four leagues in circuit, is  remarkable by having three high peaked hills upon it, by which it has  obtained that name. In the p.m. the wind veering more to the north, we  resumed our course to the east; and having weathered Threehills, stood for  the group of small isles which lie off the S.E. point of Apee. These I  called Shepherd's Isles, in honour of my worthy friend Dr Shepherd, Plumian  professor of astronomy at Cambridge. Having a fine breeze, I had thoughts  of going through between them; but the channels being narrow, and seeing  broken water in the one we were steering for, I gave up the design, and  bore up, in order to go without, or to the south of them. Before this could  be accomplished, it fell calm, and we were left to the mercy of the  current, close to the isles, where we could find no soundings with a line  of an hundred and eighty fathoms. We had now land or islands in every  direction, and were not able to count the number which lay round us. The  mountain on Paoon was seen over the east end of Apee, bearing N.N.W. at  eight o'clock. A breeze at S.E. relieved us from the anxiety the calm had  occasioned; and we spent the night in making short boards.    The night before we came out of Port Sandwich, two reddish fish, about the  size of large bream, and not unlike them, were caught with hook and line.  On these fish most of the officers, and some of the petty officers, dined  the next day. The night following, every one who had eaten of them was  seized with violent pains in the head and bones, attended with a scorching  heat all over the skin, and numbness in the joints. There remained no doubt  that this was occasioned by the fish being of a poisonous nature, and  having communicated its bad effects to all who partook of them, even to the  hogs and dogs. One of the former died about sixteen hours after; it was not  long before one of the latter shared the same fate; and it was a week or  ten days before all the gentlemen recovered. These must have been the same  sort of fish mentioned by Quiros,* under the name of pargos, which  poisoned the crews of his ships, so that it was some time before they  recovered; and we should, doubtless, have been in the same situation, had  more of them been eaten.    [* Dalrymple's Collection of Voyages, vol. I. p. 140, 141.]    At day break on the 25th, we made a short stretch to the east of Shepherd's  Isles till after sun-rise, when seeing no more land in that direction, we  tacked and stood for the island we had seen in the south, having a gentle  breeze at S.E. We passed to the east of Threehills, and likewise of a low  isle, which lies on the S.E. side of it, between a remarkable peaked rock  which obtained the name of Monument, and a small island named Twohills, on  account of two peaked hills upon it, disjoined by a low and narrow isthmus.  The channel between this island and the Monument is near a mile broad, and  twenty-four fathoms deep. Except this rock, which is only accessible to  birds, we did not find an island on which people were not seen. At noon, we  observed, in latitude 17 deg. 18' 30\"; longitude, made from Port Sandwich, 45'  E. In this situation, the Monument bore N. 16 deg. E. distant two miles;  Twohills bore N. 25 deg. W. distant two miles, and in a line with the S.W. part  of Threehills; and the islands to the south extended from S. 16 deg. 30' E. to  S. 42 deg. W.    Continuing our course to the south, at five p.m. we drew near the southern  lands, which we found to consist of one large island, whose southern and  western extremities extended beyond our sight, and three or four smaller  ones lying off its north side. The two northernmost are much the largest,  have a good height, and lie in the direction of E. by S. and W. by N. from  each other, distant two leagues; I named the one Montagu and the other  Hinchinbrook, and the large island Sandwich, in honour of my noble patron  the Earl of Sandwich. Seeing broken water ahead, between Montagu and  Hinchinbrook isles, we tacked; and soon after it fell calm. The calm  continued till seven o'-clock the next morning, when it was succeeded by a  breeze from the westward. During the calm, having been carried by the  currents and a S.E. swell, four leagues to the W.N.W., we passed  Hinchinbrook Isle, saw the western extremity of Sandwich Island, bearing  S.S.W., about five leagues distant, and at the same time discovered a small  island to the west of this direction. After getting the westerly breeze, I  steered S.E. in order to pass between Montagu Isle and the north end of  Sandwich Island. At noon we were in the middle of the channel, and observed  in latitude 17 deg. 31' S. The distance from one island to the other is about  four or five miles; but the channel is not much above half that breadth,  being contracted by breakers. We had no soundings in it with a line of  forty fathoms.    As we passed Montagu Isle several people came down to the sea-side, and, by  signs, seemed to invite us ashore. Some were also seen on Sandwich Island,  which exhibited a most delightful prospect, being spotted with woods and  lawns, agreeably diversified over the whole surface. It hath a gentle slope  from the hills, which are of a moderate height, down to the sea coast. This  is low, and guarded by a chain of breakers, so that there is no approaching  it at this part. But more to the west, beyond Hinchinbrook Island, there  seemed to run in a bay sheltered from the reigning winds. The examining it  not being so much an object, with me as the getting to the south, in order  to find the southern extremity of the Archipelago, with this view I steered  S.S.E., being the direction of the coast of Sandwich Island. We had but  just got through the passage, before the west wind left us to variable  light airs and calms; so that we were apprehensive of being carried back  again by the currents, or rather of being obliged to return, in order to  avoid being driven on the shoals, as there was no anchorage, a line of an  hundred and sixty fathoms not reaching to the bottom. At length a breeze  springing up at S.W. we stood to S.E., and at sun-set the Monument bore N.  14 deg. 30' W., and Montagu Island N. 28 deg. W. distant three leagues. We judged  we saw the S.E. extremity of Sandwich Island, bearing about S. by E.    We continued to stand S.E. till four a.m. on the 27th, when we tacked to  the west. At sun-rise, having discovered a new land bearing south, and  making in three hills, this occasioned us to tack and stand towards it. At  this time Montagu Isle bore N. 52 deg. W., distant thirteen leagues; at noon it  was nearly in the same direction, and the new land extended from S. 1/2 E.  to S. by W., and the three hills seemed to be connected. Our latitude by  observation, was 18 deg. 1' S., and the longitude, made from Port Sandwich, 1 deg.  23' E. We continued to stand to the S.E., with a gentle breeze at S.W. and  S.S.W. till the 28th at sun-rise, when, the wind veering to the south, we  tacked and stood to the west. The three hills mentioned above, we now saw,  belonging to one island, which extended from S. 35 deg. to 71 deg. W. distant about  ten or twelve leagues.    1774 August    Retarded by contrary winds, calms, and the currents, that set to N.W., we  were three days in gaining this space; in which time we discovered an  elevated land to the south of this; It first appeared in detached hummocks,  but we judged it to be connected. At length, on the 1st of August, about  ten a.m. we got a fine breeze at E.S.E., which soon after veered to N.E.,  and we steered for the N.W. side of the island. Reaching it about two p.m.,  we ranged the west coast at one mile from shore, on which the inhabitants  appeared in several parts, and by signs invited us to land. We continued to  sound without finding bottom, till we came before a small bay, or bending  of the coast, where, near a mile from shore, we found thirty and twenty-two  fathoms water, a sandy bottom. I had thoughts of anchoring here, but the  wind almost instantly veered to N.W.; which being nearly on shore, I laid  this design aside. Besides, I was unwilling to lose the opportunity that  now offered of getting to the south-east, in order first to explore the  lands which lay there. I therefore continued to range the coast to the  south, at about the same distance from shore; but we soon got out of  soundings. About a league to the south of this bay, which hath about two  miles extent, is another more extensive. Towards the evening, the breeze  began to abate, so that it was sun-set before we got the length of it. I  intended not to stop here, and to stand to the south under an easy sail all  night; but at eight o'clock, as we were steering S.S.E. we saw a light  ahead. Not knowing but it might be on some low detached isle, dangerous to  approach while dark, we hauled the wind, and spent the night standing off  and on, or rather driving to and fro; for we had but very little wind.    At sun-rise on the 2d, we saw no more land than the coast we were upon; but  found that the currents had carried us some miles to the north, and we  attempted, to little purpose, to regain what we had lost. At noon we were  about a league from the coast, which extended from S.S.E. to N.E. Latitude  observed 18 deg. 45' S. In the afternoon, finding the ship to drift not only to  the north, but in shore also, and being yet to the south of the bay we  passed the day before, I had thoughts of getting to an anchor before night,  while we had it in our power to make choice of a place. With this view,  having hoisted out two boats, one of them was sent ahead to tow the ship;  in the other Mr Gilbert went to sound for anchorage. Soon after, the towing  boat was sent to assist him. So much time was"]]]
