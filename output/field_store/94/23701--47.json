He embodied  the spirit of Protestantism in music; and a recognition of this fact  is probably the key of the admiration felt for him by the Anglo-Saxon  races.    Handel possessed an inexhaustible fund of melody of the noblest order;  an almost unequaled command of musical expression; perfect power over  all the resources of his science; the faculty of wielding huge masses  of tone with perfect ease and felicity; and he was without rival in the  sublimity of ideas. The problem which he so successfully solved in the  oratorio was that of giving such dramatic force to the music, in which  he clothed the sacred texts, as to be able to dispense with all scenic  and stage effects. One of the finest operatic composers of the time,  the rival of Bach as an instrumental composer, and performer on the  harpsichord or organ, the unanimous verdict of the musical world is that  no one has ever equaled him in completeness, range of effect, elevation  and variety of conception, and sublimity in the treatment of sacred  music. We can readily appreciate Handel's own words when describing  his own sensations in writing the \"Messiah:\" \"I did think I did see all  heaven before me, and the great God himself.\"    The great man died on Good Friday night, 1759, aged seventy-five years.  He had often wished \"he might breathe his last on Good Friday, in  hope,\" he said, \"of meeting his good God, his sweet Lord and Saviour, on  the day of his resurrection.\" The old blind musician had his wish.          GLUCK      Gluck is a noble and striking figure in musical history, alike in the  services he rendered to his art and the dignity and strength of his  personal character. As the predecessor of Wagner and Meyerbeer, who  among the composers of this century have given opera its largest and  noblest expression, he anticipated their important reforms, and in his  musical creations we see all that is best in what is called the new  school.    The man, the Ritter Christoph Wilibald von Gluck, is almost as  interesting to us as the musician. He moved in the society of princes  with a calm and haughty dignity, their conscious peer, and never  prostituted his art to gain personal advancement or to curry favor with  the great ones of the earth. He possessed a majesty of nature which was  the combined effect of personal pride, a certain lofty self-reliance,  and a deep conviction that he was the apostle of an important musical  mission.    Gluck's whole life was illumined by an indomitable sense of his own  strength, and lifted by it into an atmosphere high above that of his  rivals, whom, the world has now almost forgotten, except as they were  immortalized by being his enemies. Like Milton and Bacon, who put on  record their knowledge that they had written for all time, Gluck had a  magnificent consciousness of himself. \"I have written,\" he says, \"the  music of my 'Ar-mida' in such a manner as to prevent its soon growing  old.\" This is a sublime vanity inseparable from the great aggressive  geniuses of the world, the wind of the speed which measures their force  of impact.    Duplessis's portrait of Gluck almost takes the man out of paint to put  him in flesh and blood. He looks down with wide-open eyes, swelling  nostrils, firm mouth, and massive chin. The noble brow, dome-like  and expanded, relieves the massiveness of his face; and the whole  countenance and figure express the repose of a powerful and passionate  nature schooled into balance and symmetry: altogether the presentment  of a great man, who felt that he could move the world and had found the  _pou sto_. Of a large and robust type of physical beauty, Nature seems  to have endowed him on every hand with splendid gifts. Such a man as  this could say with calm simplicity to Marie Antoinette, who inquired  one night about his new opera of \"Armida,\" then nearly finished:  \"_Madame, il est bientot fini, et vraiment ce sera superbe._\"    One night Handel listened to a new opera from a young and unknown  composer, the \"Caduta de' Giganti,\" one of Gluck's very earliest works,  written when he was yet corrupted with all the vices of the Italian  method. \"Mein Gott! he is an idiot,\" said Handel; \"he knows no more of  counterpoint then mein cook.\" Handel did not see with prophetic eyes. He  never met Gluck afterward, and we do not know his later opinion of the  composer of \"Orpheus and Eurydice\" and \"Iphigenia in Tauris.\" But Gluck  had ever the profoundest admiration for the author of the \"Messiah.\"  There was something in these two strikingly similar, as their music was  alike characterized by massive simplicity and strength, not rough-hewn,  but shaped into austere beauty.    Before we relate the great episode of our composer's life, let us take  a backward glance at his youth. He was the son of a forester in the  service of Prince Lobkowitz born at Weidenwang in the Upper Palatinate,  July 2,1714. Gluck was devoted to music from early childhood, but  received, in connection with the musical art, an excellent education at  the Jesuit College of Kommotau. Here he learned singing, the organ, the  violin and harpsichord, and had a mind to get his living by devoting  his musical talents to the Church. The Prague public recognized in him  a musician of fair talent, but he found but little encouragement to stay  at the Bohemian capital. So he decided to finish his musical education  at Vienna, where more distinguished masters could be had. Prince  Lobkowitz, who remembered his gamekeeper's son, introduced the young man  to the Italian Prince Melzi, who induced him to accompany him to Milan.  As the pupil of the Italian organist and composer, Sammartini, he made  rapid progress in operatic composition. He was successful in pleasing  Italian audiences, and in four years produced eight operas, for which  the world has forgiven him in forgetting them. Then Gluck must go to  London to see what impression he could make on English critics; for  London then, as now, was one of the great musical centres, where every  successful composer or singer must get his brevet.    Gluck's failure to please in London was, perhaps, an important epoch  in his career. With a mind singularly sensitive to new impressions, and  already struggling with fresh ideas in the laws of operatic composition,  Handel's great music must have had a powerful effect in stimulating  his unconscious progress. His last production in England, \"Pyramus and  Thisbe,\" was a _pasticcio_ opera, in which he embodied the best bits out  of his previous works. The experiment was a glaring failure, as it ought  to have been; for it illustrated the Italian method, which was designed  for mere vocal display, carried to its logical absurdity.      II.    In 1748 Gluck settled in Vienna, where almost immediately his opera of  \"Semiramide\" was produced. Here he conceived a passion for Marianne, the  daughter of Joseph Pergin, a rich banker; but on account of the father's  distaste for a musical son-in-law, the marriage did not occur till 1750.  \"Telemacco\" and \"Clemenza di Tito\" were composed about this time, and  performed in Vienna, Rome, and Naples. In 1755 our composer received the  order of the Golden Spur from the Roman pontiff in recognition of the  merits of two operas performed at Rome, called \"Il Trionfo di Camillo\"  and \"Antigono.\" Seven years were now actively employed in producing  operas for Vienna and Italian cities, which, without possessing great  value, show the change which had begun to take place in this composer's  theories of dramatic music. In Paris he had been struck with the operas  of Rameau, in which the declamatory form was strongly marked. His early  Italian training had fixed in his mind the importance of pure melody.  From Germany he obtained his appreciation of harmony, and had made a  deep study of the uses of the orchestra. So we see this great reformer  struggling on with many faltering steps toward that result which he  afterward summed up in the following concise description: \"My purpose  was to restrict music to its true office, that of ministering to the  expression of poetry, without interrupting the action.\"    In Calzabigi Gluck had met an author who fully appreciated his ideas,  and had the talent of writing a libretto in accordance with them. This  coadjutor wrote all the librettos that belonged to Gluck's greatest  period. He had produced his \"Orpheus and Eurydice\" and \"Alceste\" in  Vienna with a fair amount of success; but his tastes drew him strongly  to the French stage, where the art of acting and declamation was  cultivated then, as it is now, to a height unknown in other parts of  Europe. So Ave find him gladly accepting an offer from the managers of  the French Opera to migrate to the great city, in which were fermenting  with much noisy fervor those new ideas in art, literature, politics,  and society, which were turning the eyes of all Europe to the French  capital.    The world's history has hardly a more picturesque and striking  spectacle, a period more fraught with the working of powerful forces,  than that exhibited by French society in the latter part of Louis XV.'s  reign. We see a court rotten to the core with indulgence in every form  of sensuality and vice, yet glittering with the veneer of a social  polish which made it the admiration of the world. A dissolute king  was ruled by a succession of mistresses, and all the courtiers vied in  emulating the vice and extravagance of their master. Yet in this foul  compost-heap art and literature nourished with a tropical luxuriance.  Voltaire was at the height of his splendid career, the most brilliant  wit and philosopher of his age. The lightnings of his mockery attacked  with an incessant play the social, political, and religious shams of  the period. People of all classes, under the influence of his unsparing  satire, were learning to see with clear eyes what an utterly artificial  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17474"],[0,"How to Listen to Music, 7th ed. (#8)"],[1,"te: _The movement of water._]    We find the gentle flux and reflux of water as if it were lapping a  rocky shore in the exquisite figure out of which Mendelssohn  constructed his \"Hebrides\" overture:    [Music illustration]    and in fancy we ride on mighty surges when we listen to the principal  subject of Rubinstein's \"Ocean\" symphony:    [Music illustration]    In none of these instances can the composer be said to be imitative.  Music cannot copy water, but it can do what water does, and so suggest  water.    [Sidenote: _High and low._]    Some of the most common devices of composers are based on conceptions  that are wholly arbitrary. A musical tone cannot have position in  space such as is indicated by high or low, yet so familiar is the  association of acuteness of pitch with height, and gravity of pitch  with depth, that composers continually delineate high things with  acute tones and low things with grave tones, as witness Handel in one  of the choruses of \"The Messiah:\"    [Music illustration: Glo-ry to God in the high-est, and peace on  earth.]    [Sidenote: _Ascent, descent, and distance delineated._]    Similarly, too, does Beethoven describe the ascent into heaven and the  descent into hell in the Credo of his mass in D. Beethoven's music,  indeed, is full of tone-painting, and because it exemplifies a double  device I make room for one more illustration. It is from the cantata  \"Becalmed at Sea, and a Prosperous Voyage,\" and in it the composer  pictures the immensity of the sea by a sudden, extraordinary spreading  out of his harmonies, which is musical, and dwelling a long time on  the word \"distance\" (_Weite_) which is rhetorical:    [Music illustration: In der un-ge-heu-'ren Wei-te.]    [Sidenote: _Bald imitation bad art._]    [Sidenote: _Vocal music and delineation._]    [Sidenote: _Beethoven's canon._]    The extent to which tone-painting is justified is a question which  might profitably concern us; but such a discussion as it deserves  would far exceed the limits set for this book, and must be foregone.  It cannot be too forcibly urged, however, as an aid to the listener,  that efforts at musical cartooning have never been made by true  composers, and that in the degree that music attempts simply to copy  external things it falls in the scale of artistic truthfulness and  value. Vocal music tolerates more of the descriptive element than  instrumental because it is a mixed art; in it the purpose of music is  to illustrate the poetry and, by intensifying the appeal to the fancy,  to warm the emotions. Every piece of vocal music, moreover, carries  its explanatory programme in its words. Still more tolerable and even  righteous is it in the opera where it is but one of several factors  which labor together to make up the sum of dramatic representation.  But it must ever remain valueless unless it be idealized. Mendelssohn,  desiring to put _Bully Bottom_ into the overture to \"A Midsummer  Night's Dream,\" did not hesitate to use tones which suggest the bray  of a donkey, yet the effect, like Handel's frogs and flies in  \"Israel,\" is one of absolute musical value. The canon which ought  continually to be before the mind of the listener is that which  Beethoven laid down with most painstaking care when he wrote the  \"Pastoral\" symphony. Desiring to inform the listeners what were the  images which inspired the various movements (in order, of course, that  they might the better enter into the work by recalling them), he gave  each part a superscription thus:    [Sidenote: _The \"Pastoral\" symphony._]         I. \"The agreeable and cheerful sensations awakened by       arrival in the country.\"         II. \"Scene by the brook.\"         III. \"A merrymaking of the country folk.\"         IV. \"Thunder-storm.\"         V. \"Shepherds' song--feelings of charity combined with       gratitude to the Deity after the storm.\"    In the title itself he included an admonitory explanation which should  have everlasting validity: \"Pastoral Symphony; more expression of  feeling than painting.\" How seriously he thought on the subject we  know from his sketch-books, in which occur a number of notes, some of  which were evidently hints for superscriptions, some records of his  convictions on the subject of descriptive music. The notes are  reprinted in Nottebohm's \"Zweite Beethoveniana,\" but I borrow Sir  George Grove's translation:    [Sidenote: _Beethoven's notes on descriptive music._]         \"The hearers should be allowed to discover the situations.\"         \"Sinfonia caracteristica, or a recollection of country       life.\"         \"All painting in instrumental music, if pushed too far, is a       failure.\"         \"Sinfonia pastorella. Anyone who has an idea of country life       can make out for himself the intentions of the author       without many titles.\"         \"People will not require titles to recognize the general       intention to be more a matter of feeling than of painting in       sounds.\"         \"Pastoral symphony: No picture, but something in which the       emotions are expressed which are aroused in men by the       pleasure of the country (or), in which some feelings of       country life are set forth.\"[C]    As to the relation of programme to music Schumann laid down an  admirable maxim when he said that while good music was not harmed by a  descriptive title it was a bad indication if a composition needed one.    [Sidenote: _Classic and Romantic._]    There are, among all the terms used in music, no words of vaguer  meaning than Classic and Romantic. The idea which they convey most  widely in conjunction is that of antithesis. When the Romantic School  of composers is discussed it is almost universally presented as  something opposed in character to the Classical School. There is  little harm in this if we but bear in mind that all the terms which  have come into use to describe different phases of musical development  are entirely artificial and arbitrary--that they do not stand for  anything absolute, but only serve as platforms of observation. If the  terms had a fixed meaning we ought to be able, since they have  established themselves in the language of history and criticism, to  describe unambiguously and define clearly the boundary which separates  them. This, however, is impossible. Each generation, nay, each  decade, fixes the meaning of the words for itself and decides what  works shall go into each category. It ought to be possible to discover  a principle, a touchstone, which shall emancipate us from the  mischievous and misleading notions that have so long prompted men to  make the partitions between the schools out of dates and names.    [Sidenote: _Trench's definition of \"classical.\"_]    The terms were borrowed from literary criticism; but even there, in  the words of Archbishop Trench, \"they either say nothing at all or say  something erroneous.\" Classical has more to defend it than Romantic,  because it has greater antiquity and, in one sense, has been used with  less arbitrariness.         \"The term,\" says Trench, \"is drawn from the political       economy of Rome. Such a man was rated as to his income in       the third class, such another in the fourth, and so on, and       he who was in the highest was emphatically said to be of the       class, _classicus_, a class man, without adding the number       as in that case superfluous; while all others were _infra       classem_. Hence by an obvious analogy the best authors were       rated as _classici_, or men of the highest class; just as in       English we say 'men of rank' absolutely for men who are in       the highest ranks of the State.\"    Thus Trench, and his historical definition, explains why in music also  there is something more than a lurking suggestion of excellence in the  conception of \"classical;\" but that fact does not put away the quarrel  which we feel exists between Classic and Romantic.    [Sidenote: _Romantic in literature._]    [Sidenote: _Schumann and Jean Paul._]    [Sidenote: _Weber's operas._]    [Sidenote: _Mendelssohn._]    As applied to literature Romantic was an adjective affected by certain  poets, first in Germany, then in France, who wished to introduce a  style of thought and expression different from that of those who  followed old models. Intrinsically, of course, the term does not imply  any such opposition but only bears witness to the source from which  the poets drew their inspiration. This was the imaginative literature  of the Middle Ages, the fantastical stories of chivalry and knighthood  written in the Romance, or Romanic languages, such as Italian,  Spanish, and Provencal. The principal elements of these stories were  the marvellous and the supernatural. The composers whose names first  spring into our minds when we think of the Romantic School are men  like Mendelssohn and Schumann, who drew much of their inspiration from  the young writers of their time who were making war on stilted  rhetoric and conventionalism of phrase. Schumann touches hands with  the Romantic poets in their strivings in two directions. His artistic  conduct, especially in his early years, is inexplicable if Jean Paul  be omitted from the equation. His music rebels against the formalism  which had held despotic sway over the art, and also seeks to disclose  the beauty which lies buried in the world of mystery in and around us,  and give expression to the multitude of emotions to which unyielding  formalism had refused adequate utterance. This, I think, is the chief  element of Romanticism. Another has more of an external nature and  genesis, and this we find in the works of such composers as Von Weber,  who is Romantic chiefly in his operas, because of the supernaturalism  and chivalry in their stories, and Mendelssohn, who, while distinctly  Romantic in many of his strivings, was yet so great a master of form,  and so attached to it, that the Romantic side of him was not fully  developed.
