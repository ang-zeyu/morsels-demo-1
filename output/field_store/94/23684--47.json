[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17306"],[0,"The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 (#8)"],[1,"the English middle-class will not as yet admit it, though they try  to evade this great question, and to represent their own particular  interests as the truly national ones, their action is utterly useless.  With every session of Parliament the working-class gains ground, the  interests of the middle-class diminish in importance; and, in spite of  the fact that the middle-class is the chief, in fact, the only power in  Parliament, the last session of 1844 was a continuous debate upon  subjects affecting the working-class, the Poor Relief Bill, the Factory  Act, the Masters' and Servants' Act; and Thomas Duncombe, the  representative of the working-men in the House of Commons, was the great  man of the session; while the Liberal middle-class with its motion for  repealing the Corn Laws, and the Radical middle-class with its resolution  for refusing the taxes, played pitiable roles.  Even the debates about  Ireland were at bottom debates about the Irish proletariat, and the means  of coming to its assistance.  It is high time, too, for the English  middle-class to make some concessions to the working-men who no longer  plead but threaten; for in a short time it may be too late.    In spite of all this, the English middle-class, especially the  manufacturing class, which is enriched directly by means of the poverty  of the workers, persists in ignoring this poverty.  This class, feeling  itself the mighty representative class of the nation, is ashamed to lay  the sore spot of England bare before the eyes of the world; will not  confess, even to itself, that the workers are in distress, because it,  the property-holding, manufacturing class, must bear the moral  responsibility for this distress.  Hence the scornful smile which  intelligent Englishmen (and they, the middle-class, alone are known on  the Continent) assume when any one begins to speak of the condition of  the working-class; hence the utter ignorance on the part of the whole  middle-class of everything which concerns the workers; hence the  ridiculous blunders which men of this class, in and out of Parliament,  make when the position of the proletariat comes under discussion; hence  the absurd freedom from anxiety, with which the middle-class dwells upon  a soil that is honeycombed, and may any day collapse, the speedy collapse  of which is as certain as a mathematical or mechanical demonstration;  hence the miracle that the English have as yet no single book upon the  condition of their workers, although they have been examining and mending  the old state of things no one knows how many years.  Hence also the deep  wrath of the whole working-class, from Glasgow to London, against the  rich, by whom they are systematically plundered and mercilessly left to  their fate, a wrath which before too long a time goes by, a time almost  within the power of man to predict, must break out into a Revolution in  comparison with which the French Revolution, and the year 1794, will  prove to have been child's play.          THE INDUSTRIAL PROLETARIAT.      The order of our investigation of the different sections of the  proletariat follows naturally from the foregoing history of its rise.  The  first proletarians were connected with manufacture, were engendered by  it, and accordingly, those employed in manufacture, in the working up of  raw materials, will first claim our attention.  The production of raw  materials and of fuel for manufacture attained importance only in  consequence of the industrial change, and engendered a new proletariat,  the coal and metal miners.  Then, in the third place, manufacture  influenced agriculture, and in the fourth, the condition of Ireland; and  the fractions of the proletariat belonging to each, will find their place  accordingly.  We shall find, too, that with the possible exception of the  Irish, the degree of intelligence of the various workers is in direct  proportion to their relation to manufacture; and that the factory hands  are most enlightened as to their own interests, the miners somewhat less  so, the agricultural labourers scarcely at all.  We shall find the same  order again among the industrial workers, and shall see how the factory  hands, eldest children of the industrial revolution, have from the  beginning to the present day formed the nucleus of the Labour Movement,  and how the others have joined this movement just in proportion as their  handicraft has been invaded by the progress of machinery.  We shall thus  learn from the example which England offers, from the equal pace which  the Labour Movement has kept with the movement of industrial development,  the historical significance of manufacture.    Since, however, at the present moment, pretty much the whole industrial  proletariat is involved in the movement, and the condition of the  separate sections has much in common, because they all are industrial, we  shall have first to examine the condition of the industrial proletariat  as a whole, in order later to notice more particularly each separate  division with its own peculiarities.    It has been already suggested that manufacture centralises property in  the hands of the few.  It requires large capital with which to erect the  colossal establishments that ruin the petty trading bourgeoisie and with  which to press into its service the forces of Nature, so driving the hand  labour of the independent workman out of the market.  The division of  labour, the application of water and especially steam, and the  application of machinery, are the three great levers with which  manufacture, since the middle of the last century, has been busy putting  the world out of joint.  Manufacture, on a small scale, created the  middle-class; on a large scale, it created the working-class, and raised  the elect of the middle-class to the throne, but only to overthrow them  the more surely when the time comes.  Meanwhile, it is an undenied and  easily explained fact that the numerous, petty middle-class of the \"good  old times\" has been annihilated by manufacture, and resolved into rich  capitalists on the one hand and poor workers on the other. {20}    The centralising tendency of manufacture does not, however, stop here.  Population becomes centralised just as capital does; and, very naturally,  since the human being, the worker, is regarded in manufacture simply as a  piece of capital for the use of which the manufacturer pays interest  under the name of wages.  A manufacturing establishment requires many  workers employed together in a single building, living near each other  and forming a village of themselves in the case of a good-sized factory.  They have needs for satisfying which other people are necessary;  handicraftsmen, shoemakers, tailors, bakers, carpenters, stonemasons,  settle at hand.  The inhabitants of the village, especially the younger  generation, accustom themselves to factory work, grow skilful in it, and  when the first mill can no longer employ them all, wages fall, and the  immigration of fresh manufacturers is the consequence.  So the village  grows into a small town, and the small town into a large one.  The  greater the town, the greater its advantages.  It offers roads,  railroads, canals; the choice of skilled labour increases constantly, new  establishments can be built more cheaply because of the competition among  builders and machinists who are at hand, than in remote country  districts, whither timber, machinery, builders, and operatives must be  brought; it offers a market to which buyers crowd, and direct  communication with the markets supplying raw material or demanding  finished goods.  Hence the marvellously rapid growth of the great  manufacturing towns.  The country, on the other hand, has the advantage  that wages are usually lower than in town, and so town and country are in  constant competition; and, if the advantage is on the side of the town to-  day, wages sink so low in the country to-morrow, that new investments are  most profitably made there.  But the centralising tendency of manufacture  continues in full force, and every new factory built in the country bears  in it the germ of a manufacturing town.  If it were possible for this mad  rush of manufacture to go on at this rate for another century, every  manufacturing district of England would be one great manufacturing town,  and Manchester and Liverpool would meet at Warrington or Newton; for in  commerce, too, this centralisation of the population works in precisely  the same way, and hence it is that one or two great harbours, such as  Hull and Liverpool, Bristol, and London, monopolise almost the whole  maritime commerce of Great Britain.    Since commerce and manufacture attain their most complete development in  these great towns, their influence upon the proletariat is also most  clearly observable here.  Here the centralisation of property has reached  the highest point; here the morals and customs of the good old times are  most completely obliterated; here it has gone so far that the name Merry  Old England conveys no meaning, for Old England itself is unknown to  memory and to the tales of our grandfathers.  Hence, too, there exist  here only a rich and a poor class, for the lower middle-class vanishes  more completely with every passing day.  Thus the class formerly most  stable has become the most restless one.  It consists to-day of a few  remnants of a past time, and a number of people eager to make fortunes,  industrial Micawbers and speculators of whom one may amass a fortune,  while ninety-nine become insolvent, and more than half of the ninety-nine  live by perpetually repeated failure.    But in these towns the proletarians are the infinite majority, and how  they fare, what influence the great town exercises upon them, we have now  to investigate.          THE GREAT TOWNS.      A town, such as London, where a man may wander for hours together without  reaching the beginning of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17309"],[0,"The Summons of the Lord of Hosts (#8)"],[1," cling to a single one of Our Names, and are debarred from recognizing  Him Who is the Creator of all Names. We testify that such men are of a  truth amongst the people of the Fire. They ask the sun to expound the  words of the shadow, and the True One to explain the utterances of His  creatures, could ye but perceive it! Say: O people! The sun offereth  naught save the effulgence of its own light and that which appeareth  therefrom, whilst all else seek illumination from its rays. Fear God, and  be not of the ignorant! Among them also were those who inquired of the  darkness about the light. Say: Open thine eyes, that thou mayest behold  the brightness which hath visibly enveloped the earth! This, verily, is a  light which hath risen and shone forth above the horizon of the Dayspring  of divine knowledge with manifest radiance. Would ye ask the Jews whether  Jesus was the True One from God, or the idols if Muhammad was an Apostle  of His Lord, or inquire from the people of the Qur'an as to Him Who was  the Remembrance of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Great?    80 Say: O people! Cast away, before the splendours of this Revelation, the  things that ye possess, and cleave to that which God hath bidden you  observe. Such is His command unto you, and He, verily, is best able to  command. By My Beauty! My purpose in revealing these words is to cause all  men to draw nigh unto God, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised. Beware lest  ye deal with Me as ye dealt with My Herald. Do not object, when the verses  of God are sent down unto you from the Court of My favour, saying, \"these  do not proceed from an innate and untaught nature\", for that nature itself  hath been created by My word and circleth round Me, if ye be of them that  apprehend this truth. Inhale from the utterances of your Lord, the  All-Merciful, the sweet smell of the garment of inner meanings, which hath  been diffused throughout the entire creation and hath shed its fragrance  over all created things. Happy are those who perceive it and hasten unto  God with radiant hearts.    81 O Living Temple! We, verily, have made Thee a mirror unto the kingdom  of names, that Thou mayest be, amidst all mankind, a sign of My  sovereignty, a herald unto My presence, a summoner unto My beauty, and a  guide unto My straight and perspicuous Path. We have exalted Thy Name  among Our servants as a bounty from Our presence. I, verily, am the  All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. We have, moreover, adorned Thee with  the ornament of Our own Self, and have imparted unto Thee Our Word, that  Thou mayest ordain in this contingent world whatsoever Thou willest and  accomplish whatsoever Thou pleasest. We have destined for Thee all the  good of the heavens and of the earth, and decreed that none may attain  unto a portion thereof unless he entereth beneath Thy shadow, as bidden by  Thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have conferred upon Thee  the Staff of authority and the Writ of judgement, that Thou mayest test  the wisdom of every command. We have caused the oceans of inner meaning  and explanation to surge from Thy heart in remembrance of Thy Lord, the  God of mercy, that Thou mayest render thanks and praise unto Him and be of  those who are truly thankful. We have singled Thee out from amongst all  Our creatures, and have appointed Thee as the Manifestation of Our own  Self unto all who are in the heavens and on the earth.    82 Bring then into being, by Our leave, resplendent mirrors and exalted  letters that shall testify to Thy sovereignty and dominion, bear witness  to Thy might and glory, and be the manifestations of Thy Names amidst  mankind. We have caused Thee again to be the Origin and the Creator of all  mirrors, even as We brought them forth from Thee aforetime. And We shall  cause Thee to return unto Mine own Self, even as We called Thee forth in  the beginning. Thy Lord, verily, is the Unconstrained, the All-Powerful,  the All-Compelling. Warn, then, these mirrors, once they have been made  manifest, lest they swell with pride before their Creator and Fashioner  when He appeareth amongst them, or let the trappings of leadership delude  and debar them from bowing in submission before God, the Almighty, the  All-Beauteous.    83 Say: O concourse of mirrors! Ye are but a creation of My will and have  come to exist by virtue of My command. Beware lest ye deny the verses of  My Lord, and be of them who have wrought injustice and are numbered with  the lost. Beware lest ye cling unto that which ye possess, or take pride  in your fame and renown. That which behoveth you is to wholly detach  yourselves from all that is in the heavens and on the earth. Thus hath it  been ordained by Him Who is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.    84 O Temple of My Cause! Say: Should I wish to transform, in a single  moment, all things into mirrors of My Names, this undoubtedly is in My  power, how much more in the power of My Lord, Who hath called Me into  being through His all-compelling and inscrutable command. And should I  choose to revolutionize the entire creation in the twinkling of an eye,  this assuredly is possible unto Me, how much more unto that sovereign  Purpose enshrined in the Will of God, My Lord and the Lord of all the  worlds.    85 Say: O ye manifestations of My Names! Should ye offer up all that ye  possess, nay your very lives, in the path of God, and invoke Him to the  number of the grains of sand, the drops of rain, and the waves of the sea,  and yet oppose the Manifestation of His Cause at the time of His  appearance, your works shall in no wise be mentioned before God. Should  ye, however, neglect all righteous works and yet choose to believe in Him  in these days, God perchance will put away your sins. He, verily, is the  All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful. Thus doth the Lord inform you of His  purpose, that haply ye may not wax proud before the One through Whom  whatsoever hath been revealed from all eternity hath been confirmed. Happy  is he who approacheth this Most Sublime Vision, and woe to them that turn  aside!    86 How numerous those who expend all their wealth in the path of God, and  whom We find, at the hour of His Revelation, to be of the rebellious and  the froward! How many those who keep the fast in the daytime, only to  protest against the One by Whose very command the ordinance of the fast  was first established! Such men are, in truth, of the ignorant. And how  many those who subsist on the coarsest bread, who take for their only seat  the grass of the field, and who undergo every manner of hardship, merely  to maintain their superiority in the eyes of men! Thus do We expose their  deeds, that this may serve as a warning unto others. These are the ones  who subject themselves to all manner of austerities before the gaze of  others in the hope of perpetuating their names, whilst in reality no  mention shall remain of them save in the curses and imprecations of the  dwellers of earth and heaven.    87 Say: Would it profit you in the least if, as ye fondly imagine, your  names were to endure? Nay, by the Lord of all worlds! Was the idol  'Uzza(10) made any greater by this, that its name lived on amidst the  worshippers of names? Nay, by Him Who is the Self of God, the  All-Glorious, the All-Compelling! Should your names fade from every mortal  mind, and yet God be well pleased with you, ye will indeed be numbered  among the treasures of His name, the Most Hidden. Thus have We sent down  Our verses that they may attract you unto the Source of all Lights, and  acquaint you with the purpose of your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.  Abstain, then, from all that hath been forbidden unto you in the Book, and  eat of the lawful things which God hath provided for your sustenance.  Deprive not yourselves of His goodly bestowals, for He, verily, is the  Most Generous, the Lord of grace abounding. Subject not yourselves to  excessive hardships, but follow the way We have made plain unto you  through Our luminous verses and perspicuous proofs, and be not of the  negligent.    88 O concourse of divines! It is not yours to boast if ye abstain from  drinking wine and from similar transgressions which have been forbidden  you in the Book, for should ye commit such deeds, the dignity of your  station would then be tainted in the eyes of the people, your affairs  would be disrupted, and your name disgraced and dishonoured. Nay, your  true and abiding glory resideth in submission to the Word of Him Who is  the Eternal Truth, and in your inward and outward detachment from aught  else besides God, the All-Compelling, the Almighty. Great is the  blessedness of that divine that hath not allowed knowledge to become a  veil between him and the One Who is the Object of all knowledge, and who,  when the Self-Subsisting appeared, hath turned with a beaming face towards  Him. He, in truth, is numbered with the learned. The inmates of Paradise  seek the blessing of his breath, and his lamp sheddeth its radiance over  all who are in heaven and on earth. He, verily, is numbered with the  inheritors of the Prophets. He that beholdeth him hath, verily, beheld the  True One, and he that turneth towards him hath, verily, turned towards  God, the Almighty, the All-Wise.    89 O ye the dawning-places of knowledge! Beware that ye suffer not  yourselves to become changed, for as ye change, most men will, likewise,  change. This, verily, is an injustice unto yourselves and unto others.  Unto this beareth witness every man of discernment and insight. Ye are  even as a spring. If it be changed, so will the streams that branch out  from it be changed. Fear God, and be numbered with the godly. In like  manner, if the heart of man be corrupted, his limbs will also be  corrupted. And similarly, if the root of a tree be corrupted, its  branches, and its offshoots, and its leaves, and its fruits, will be  corrupted. Thus have We set forth similitudes for your instruction, that"]]]
