Arrange the meat in the  center with dumplings around the edge and a sprig of parsley between  each. Thicken the liquid and season with salt and pepper as needed and a  rounding tablespoon of butter.      ~CHICKEN TIMBALES~--Mix three-fourths of a cupful of flour with a half  teaspoonful of salt. Add gradually while stirring constantly, one-half  cupful of milk and one well beaten egg and one tablespoonful of olive  oil. Shape, using a hot Swedish timbale iron, and cook in deep fat until  delicately brown. Take from the iron and invert on brown paper to drain.  To make the filling for a dozen timbales, remove bones and skin from a  pint bowlful of the white or white and dark meat mixed of cold boiled or  roasted chicken, and cut in half inch pieces. Put over the first in a  saucepan two tablespoonfuls of butter and two of flour and when melted  and blended add milk and chicken broth, a cupful and a half or more as  desired to make a rich cream sauce. Season with salt and pepper, add the  chicken and, if preferred, one-half cupful of mushrooms cut in pieces  the same size as the chicken. Then brown in butter before adding to the  sauce. Fill the timbales.    ~DEVILED CHICKEN~--Split the chickens down the back and broil until  done, lay on a hot dripping pan and spread on a sauce, scatter fine  crumbs over and set in a quick oven to brown. For the sauce beat a  rounding tablespoon of butter light with one-half teaspoon of mixed  mustard, one teaspoon of vinegar and a pinch of cayenne.      ~FRICASSED TURKEY OR GOOSE GIBLETS~--Scald and pick giblets. Put them in  a saucepan with a piece of butter, a bunch of parsley, green onions,  thyme, bay-leaf and a few mushrooms; warm these over the fire, with a  sprinkle of flour moistened with stock or water, adding salt and pepper  to taste. Reduce to a thick sauce, adding to it the yolks of two eggs,  and let simmer without boiling. Serve with sprinkling of vinegar.      ~FRIED CHICKEN~--Cut up two chickens. Put a quarter of a pound of  butter, mixed with a spoonful of flour, into a saucepan with pepper,  salt, little vinegar, parsley, green onions, carrots and turnips, into a  saucepan and heat. Steep the chicken in this marinade three hours,  having dried the pieces and floured them. Fry a good brown. Garnish with  fried parsley.      ~JELLIED CHICKEN~--For jellied chicken have on hand three pounds of  chicken that has been boiled and cut from the bone in strips. Mix a  quart of rich chicken stock that has been boiled down and cleared with a  teaspoonful each of lemon juice, chopped parsley, a dash of celery salt  and a quarter teaspoonful each of salt and paprika. At the last stir in  a teaspoonful of granulated gelatin that has been dissolved. When the  jelly begins to thicken add the chicken and turn it into a mold. To have  the chicken scattered evenly through the jelly, stand the dish  containing the jelly in a pan of ice and turn in the jelly layer by  layer, covering each with chicken as soon as it begins to thicken.      ~MARBLED CHICKEN~--Steam a young fowl until tender or cook it gently in  a small amount of water. Cut all the meat from the bones, keeping the  white and dark meat separate. Chop the meat with a sharp knife, but do  not grind it, season with salt and pepper. Press into a mold making  alternate layers of light and dark meat. Strain the broth in which the  fowl was cooked and which should be reduced by cooking to a small  amount, season with salt and pepper, add a tablespoon of butter after  skimming clear of all fat. Pour this broth over the meat and set all in  the ice chest until cold and firm. Unmold and cut in thin slices with a  sharp knife, then if liked garnish with cress and sliced lemon and  serve.      ~POTTED CHICKEN~--Truss a small broiler in shape and lay in casserole.  Brush it generously with melted butter, put on the cover, and cook  twenty minutes. Now add one cup of rich stock or beef extract dissolved  in hot water to make a good strength. Cover and finish cooking. Serve  uncovered in the same dish with spoonfuls of potato balls, small carrots  sliced and tiny string beans laid alternately round the chicken. The  vegetables should each be cooked separately.      ~PRESSED CHICKEN~--Cut as for a stew. Skin the feet and place in the  bottom of a stew pan. Arrange the fowl on top, just cover with water,  and cook slowly until tender. Do not let the meat brown. Separate the  dark and light meat and throw away the feet, from which the gluten has  been extracted. Chop liver, skin, heart and gizzard fine. Add these  chopped giblets to a dressing of stale bread crumbs seasoned and  moistened with a little hot water and butter. Arrange the large pieces  of meat around the sides and bottom of a baking dish, alternating dark  and light, and fill alternately with dressing and chicken until the dish  is full. Remove the fat from the water in which the chicken was cooked,  heat boiling hot and pour over the chicken. Put into a press for several  hours and when cold slice.      ~ROAST CHICKEN~--Having drawn and trussed the chicken put it between  some slices of bacon, take care to fasten the feet to the spit to keep  it together, baste it with its gravy, when well done through, serve with  cress round the dish, season with salt and vinegar. The chicken and  bacon should be covered with buttered paper, until five minutes of the  bird being done, then take off the paper, and finish the roasting by a  very bright fire.      ~STUFFED CHICKEN~--Put a pint of milk into a saucepan with a good  handful of crumbs of bread and boil until very thick. Set away to cool.  Add to this parsley, chopped green onion, thyme, salt, pepper, piece of  butter and the yolks of four eggs, and place in body of chicken, sewing  up the opening. Roast the chicken between rashers of bacon.      ~TURKEY GIBLETS A LA BOURGEOISE~--The giblets of turkey consist of the  pinions, feet, neck and gizzard. After having scalded pick them well and  put in a saucepan with a piece of butter, some parsley, green onions,  clove of garlic, sprig of thyme, bay-leaf, a spoonful of flour moistened  with stock, salt and pepper. Brown to a good color.    ~TURKEY TRUFFLES~--Take a fat turkey, clean and singe it. Take three or  four pounds of truffles, chopping up a handful with some fat bacon and  put into a saucepan, together with the whole truffles, salt, pepper,  spices and a bay-leaf. Let these ingredients cook over a slow fire for  three-quarters of a hour, take off, stir and let cool. When quite cold  place in body of turkey, sew up the opening and let the turkey imbibe  the flavor of the truffles by remaining in a day or two, if the season  permits. Cover the bird with slices of bacon and roast.      ~ANCHOVY STUFFING~--Put some large fine chopped onions into a frying pan  with a little oil or butter and fry them to a light brown. Put them in a  basin and add some breadcrumbs that have been dipped in water and  squeeze quite dry. Then add a small piece of liver of the bird to be  stuffed. The filling of seven or eight salted anchovies, a pinch of  parsley, with a few chopped capers. Work these well together, sprinkle  over a little pepper and thicken the mixture with yolks of eggs, when it  is ready for use.      ~CHESTNUT STUFFING~--Peel a sound good-sized shallot, chop it up fine,  place it in a saucepan on a hot fire with one tablespoonful of butter  and heat it for three minutes without browning. Then add one-fourth  pound of sausage meat and cook for five minutes longer. Add ten finely  chopped mushrooms and a dozen well pounded cooked peeled chestnuts and  stir all well together, season with one pinch of salt, half pinch of  pepper, one-half saltspoon of powdered thyme, and one teaspoonful of  finely chopped parsley. Let this come to a boil, add one half ounce of  sifted bread crumbs and twenty-five or thirty whole cooked and shelled  chestnuts and mix all well together, being careful not to break the  chestnuts. Allow to cool and then is ready for use.      ~CHESTNUT STUFFING FOR TURKEY~--Put a dozen or fifteen large chestnuts  into a saucepan of water, and boil them until they are quite tender,  then take off the shells and skins, put into a mortar and pound them.  Put four ounces of shredded beef suet into a basin, stir in one-half  pound of bread crumbs, season with salt and pepper to taste, and squeeze  in a little lemon juice. Mix in a pound of chestnuts and stuffing will  be ready for use.      ~CHESTNUT STUFFING WITH TRUFFLES~--Remove the dark or outer skins from  some chestnuts, immerse in boiling water for a few minutes, remove the  light skins and boil for about twenty minutes, put in a saucepan one  pound of fat bacon and two shallots, and keep these over the fire for a  few minutes. Then add the whole chestnuts, also one-half pound of  chestnuts previously cut out into small pieces, put in pepper, spices  and salt to taste, and a small quantity of powdered margoram and thyme.  Hold it over the fire a little longer, turning it occasionally. It is  then ready for use.      ~CHICKEN LIVER STUFFING FOR BIRDS~--Chop a half pound of fat chicken  livers in small pieces and put them in a frying pan, with two finely  chopped shallots, two ounces of fat ham, also chopped thyme, grated  nutmeg, pepper, salt and a small lump of butter. Toss it about over the  fire until partly cooked. Then take it off and leave it until cold.  Pound in a mortar, then it is ready to use.      ~CHICKEN STUFFING~--Take the heart, liver, and gizzard of a fowl, chop  fine, season to taste and mix with boiled rice, worked up with a little  butter. Stuff the chicken with this.      ~GIBLET STUFFING FOR TURKEY~--Put the giblets in a saucepan over the  fire with boiling water to cover, sprinkle over a teaspoonful of salt  and a quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper and boil gently until tender.  Save the water in which the giblets were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18440"],[0,"Logic: Deductive and Inductive (#8)"],[1,"small letter  represents the negative. The same device may be adopted to express  contradictory terms: either of them being _X_, the other is _x_ (see  chap. iv., Sec.Sec. 7-8); or the contradictory terms may be expressed by _x_  and _[x]_, _y_ and _[y]_.    And as terms are often compounded, it may be convenient to express them  by a combination of letters: instead of illustrating such a case by  _boiling water_ or _water that is boiling_, we may write _XY_; or since  positive and negative terms may be compounded, instead of illustrating  this by _water that is not boiling_, we may write _Xy_.    The convenience of this is obvious; but it is more than convenient; for,  if one of the uses of Logic be to discipline the power of abstract  thought, this can be done far more effectually by symbolic than by  concrete examples; and if such discipline were the only use of Logic it  might be best to discard concrete illustrations altogether, at least in  advanced text-books, though no doubt the practice would be too severe  for elementary manuals. On the other hand, to show the practical  applicability of Logic to the arguments and proofs of actual life, or  even of the concrete sciences, merely symbolic illustration may be not  only useless but even misleading. When we speak of politics, or poetry,  or species, or the weather, the terms that must be used can rarely have  the distinctness and isolation of X and Y; so that the perfunctory use  of symbolic illustration makes argument and proof appear to be much  simpler and easier matters than they really are. Our belief in any  proposition never rests on the proposition itself, nor merely upon one  or two others, but upon the immense background of our general knowledge  and beliefs, full of circumstances and analogies, in relation to which  alone any given proposition is intelligible. Indeed, for this reason, it  is impossible to illustrate Logic sufficiently: the reader who is in  earnest about the cogency of arguments and the limitation of proofs, and  is scrupulous as to the degrees of assent that they require, must  constantly look for illustrations in his own knowledge and experience  and rely at last upon his own sagacity.          CHAPTER III    OF TERMS AND THEIR DENOTATION      Sec. 1. In treating of Deductive Logic it is usual to recognise three  divisions of the subject: first, the doctrine of Terms, words, or other  signs used as subjects or predicates; secondly, the doctrine of  Propositions, analysed into terms related; and, thirdly, the doctrine of  the Syllogism in which propositions appear as the grounds of a  conclusion.    The terms employed are either letters of the alphabet, or the words of  common language, or the technicalities of science; and since the words  of common language are most in use, it is necessary to give some account  of common language as subserving the purposes of Logic. It has been  urged that we cannot think or reason at all without words, or some  substitute for them, such as the signs of algebra; but this is an  exaggeration. Minds greatly differ, and some think by the aid of  definite and comprehensive picturings, especially in dealing with  problems concerning objects in space, as in playing chess blindfold,  inventing a machine, planning a tour on an imagined map. Most people  draw many simple inferences by means of perceptions, or of mental  imagery. On the other hand, some men think a good deal without any  continuum of words and without any imagery, or with none that seems  relevant to the purpose. Still the more elaborate sort of thinking, the  grouping and concatenation of inferences, which we call reasoning,  cannot be carried far without language or some equivalent system of  signs. It is not merely that we need language to express our reasonings  and communicate them to others: in solitary thought we often depend on  words--'talk to ourselves,' in fact; though the words or sentences that  then pass through our minds are not always fully formed or articulated.  In Logic, moreover, we have carefully to examine the grounds (at least  the proximate grounds) of our conclusions; and plainly this cannot be  done unless the conclusions in question are explicitly stated and  recorded.    Conceptualists say that Logic deals not with the process of thinking  (which belongs to Psychology) but with its results; not with conceiving  but with concepts; not with judging but with judgments. Is the concept  self-consistent or adequate? Logic asks; is the judgment capable of  proof? Now, it is only by recording our thoughts in language that it  becomes possible to distinguish between the process and the result of  thought. Without language, the act and the product of thinking would be  identical and equally evanescent. But by carrying on the process in  language and remembering or otherwise recording it, we obtain a result  which may be examined according to the principles of Logic.    Sec. 2. As Logic, then, must give some account of language, it seems  desirable to explain how its treatment of language differs from that of  Grammar and from that of Rhetoric.    Grammar is the study of the words of some language, their classification  and derivation, and of the rules of combining them, according to the  usage at any time recognised and followed by those who are considered  correct writers or speakers. Composition may be faultless in its  grammar, though dull and absurd.    Rhetoric is the study of language with a view to obtaining some special  effect in the communication of ideas or feelings, such as  picturesqueness in description, vivacity in narration, lucidity in  exposition, vehemence in persuasion, or literary charm. Some of these  ends are often gained in spite of faulty syntax or faulty logic; but  since the few whom bad grammar saddens or incoherent arguments divert  are not carried away, as they else might be, by an unsophisticated  orator, Grammar and Logic are necessary to the perfection of Rhetoric.  Not that Rhetoric is in bondage to those other sciences; for foreign  idioms and such figures as the ellipsis, the anacoluthon, the oxymoron,  the hyperbole, and violent inversions have their place in the  magnificent style; but authors unacquainted with Grammar and Logic are  not likely to place such figures well and wisely. Indeed, common idioms,  though both grammatically and rhetorically justifiable, both correct and  effective, often seem illogical. 'To fall asleep,' for example, is a  perfect English phrase; yet if we examine severally the words it  consists of, it may seem strange that their combination should mean  anything at all.    But Logic only studies language so far as necessary in order to state,  understand, and check the evidence and reasonings that are usually  embodied in language. And as long as meanings are clear, good Logic is  compatible with false concords and inelegance of style.    Sec. 3. Terms are either Simple or Composite: that is to say, they may  consist either of a single word, as 'Chaucer,' 'civilisation'; or of  more than one, as 'the father of English poetry,' or 'modern civilised  nations.' Logicians classify words according to their uses in forming  propositions; or, rather, they classify the uses of words as terms, not  the words themselves; for the same word may fall into different classes  of terms according to the way in which it is used. (Cf. Mr. Alfred  Sidgwick's _Distinction and the Criticism of Beliefs_, chap. xiv.)    Thus words are classified as Categorematic or Syncategorematic. A word  is Categorematic if used singly as a term without the support of other  words: it is Syncategorematic when joined with other words in order to  constitute the subject or predicate of a proposition. If we say _Venus  is a planet whose orbit is inside the Earth's_, the subject, 'Venus,'  is a word used categorematically as a simple term; the predicate is a  composite term whose constituent words (whether substantive, relative,  verb, or preposition) are used syncategorematically.    Prepositions, conjunctions, articles, adverbs, relative pronouns, in  their ordinary use, can only enter into terms along with other words  having a substantive, adjectival or participial force; but when they are  themselves the things spoken of and are used substantively (_suppositio  materialis_), they are categorematic. In the proposition, _'Of' was used  more indefinitely three hundred years ago than it is now_, 'of' is  categorematic. On the other hand, all substantives may be used  categorematically; and the same self-sufficiency is usually recognised  in adjectives and participles. Some, however, hold that the  categorematic use of adjectives and participles is due to an ellipsis  which the logician should fill up; that instead of _Gold is heavy_, he  should say _Gold is a heavy metal_; instead of _The sun is shining_,  _The sun is a body shining_. But in these cases the words 'metal' and  'body' are unmistakable tautology, since 'metal' is implied in gold and  'body' in sun. But, as we have seen, any of these kinds of word,  substantive, adjective, or participle, may occur syncategorematically in  connection with others to form a composite term.    Sec. 4. Most terms (the exceptions and doubtful cases will be discussed  hereafter) have two functions, a denotative and a connotative. A term's  denotative function is, to be the name or sign of something or some  multitude of things, which are said to be called or denoted by the term.  Its connotative function is, to suggest certain qualities and  characteristics of the things denoted, so that it cannot be used  literally as the name of any other things; which qualities and  characteristics are said to be implied or connoted by the term. Thus  'sheep' is the name of certain animals, and its connotation prevents its  being used of any others. That which a term directly indicates, then,  is its _Denotation_; that sense or customary use of it which"]]]
