All those on board the Queen had their own hobbies. The monotony of  voyaging through hyper-space had long ago impressed upon men the need for  occupying both hands and mind during the sterile days while they were  forced into close companionship with few duties to keep them alert.  Jellico's cabin was papered with tri-dee pictures of the rare animals and  alien creatures he had studied in their native haunts or of which he kept  careful and painstaking records. Tau had his magic, Mura not only his  plants but the delicate miniature landscapes he fashioned, to be  imprisoned forever in the hearts of protecting plasta balls. But Weeks  had never shown his work before and now he had an artist's supreme  pleasure of completely confounding his shipmates.    The Cargo-master returned to the business on hand first. \"You're willing  to transfer these to 'cargo'?\" he asked briskly. \"How many do you have?\"    Weeks, now lifting a third and then a fourth tray from the box, replied  without looking up.    \"Two hundred. Yes, I'll transfer, sir.\"    The Captain was turning about in his fingers the beautifully shaped  figure of an Astran duocorn. \"Pity to trade these here,\" he mused aloud.  \"Will Paft or Halfer appreciate more than just their scent?\"    Weeks smiled shyly. \"I've filled this case, sir. I was going to offer  them to Mr. Van Rycke on a venture. I can always make another set. And  right now--well, maybe they'll be worth more to the Queen, seeing as how  they're made out of aromatic woods, then they'd be elsewhere. Leastwise  the Eysies aren't going to have anything like them to show!\" he ended in  a burst of honest pride.    \"Indeed they aren't!\" Van Rycke gave honor where it was due.    So they made plans and then separated to sleep out the rest of the night.  Dane knew that his lapse was not forgotten nor forgiven, but now he was  honestly too tired to care and slept as well as if his conscience were  clear.    But morning brought only a trickle of lower class clansmen for trading  and none of them had much but news to offer. The storm priests, as  neutral arbitrators, had divided up the Koros grounds. And the clansmen,  under the personal supervision of their chieftains were busy hunting the  stones. The Terrans gathered from scraps of information that gem seeking  on such a large scale had never been attempted before.    Before night there came other news, and much more chilling. Paft, one of  the two major chieftains of this section of Sargol--while supervising the  efforts of his liege men on a newly discovered and richly strewn length  of shoal water--had been attacked and killed by gorp. The unusual  activity of the Salariki in the shallows had in turn drawn to the spot  battalions of the intelligent, malignant reptiles who had struck in  strength, slaying and escaping before the Salariki could form an adequate  defense, having killed the land dwellers' sentries silently and  effectively before advancing on the laboring main bodies of gem hunters.    A loss of a certain number of miners or fishers had been preseen as the  price one paid for Koros in quantity. But the death of a chieftain was  another thing altogether, having repercussions which carried far beyond  the fact of his death. When the news reached the Salariki about the Queen  they melted away into the grass forest and for the first time the Terrans  felt free of spying eyes.    \"What happens now?\" Ali inquired. \"Do they declare all deals off?\"    \"That might just be the unfortunate answer,\" agreed Van Rycke.    \"Could be,\" Rip commented to Dane, \"that they'd think we were in some way  responsible--\"    But Dane's conscience, sensitive over the whole matter of Salariki trade,  had already reached that conclusion.    The Terran party, unsure of what were the best tactics, wisely decided to  do nothing at all for the time being. But, when the Salariki seemed to  have completely vanished on the morning of the second day, the men were  restless. Had Paft's death resulted in some interclan quarrel over the  heirship and the other clans withdrawn to let the various contendents for  that honor fight it out? Or--what was more probable and dangerous--had  the aliens come to the point of view that the Queen was in the main  responsible for the catastrophe and were engaged in preparing too warm a  welcome for any Traders who dared to visit them?    With the latter idea in mind they did not stray far from the ship. And  the limit to their traveling was the edge of the forest from which they  could be covered and so they did not learn much.    It was well into the morning before they were dramatically appraised  that, far from being considered in any way an enemy, they were about to  be accepted in a tie as close as clan to clan during one of the temporary  but binding truces.    The messenger came in state, a young Salarik warrior, his splendid cloak  rent and hanging in tattered pieces from his shoulders as a sign of his  official grief. He carried in one hand a burned out torch, and in the  other an unsheathed claw knife, its blade reflecting the sunlight with a  wicked glitter. Behind him trotted three couples of retainers, their  cloaks also ragged fringes, their knives drawn.    Standing up on the ramp to receive what could only be a formal deputation  were Captain, Astrogator, Cargo-master and Engineer, the senior officers  of the spacer.    In the rolling periods of the Trade Lingo the torch bearer identified  himself as Groft, son and heir of the late lamented Paft. Until his  chieftain father was avenged in blood he could not assume the high seat  of his clan nor the leadership of the family. And now, following custom,  he was inviting the friends and sometimes allies of the dead Paft to a  gorp hunt. Such a gorp hunt, Dane gathered from amidst the flowers of  ceremonial Salariki speech, as had never been planned before on the face  of Sargol. Salariki without number in the past had died beneath the  ripping talons of the water reptiles, but it was seldom that a chieftain  had so fallen and his clan were firm in their determination to take a  full blood price from the killers.    \"--and so, sky lords,\" Groft brought his oration to a close, \"we come to  ask that you send your young men to this hunting so that they may know  the joy of plunging knives into the scaled death and see the horned ones  die bathed in their own vile blood!\"    Dane needed no hint from the Queen's officers that this invitation was a  sharp departure from custom. By joining with the natives in such a foray  the Terrans were being admitted to kinship of a sort, cementing relations  by a tie which the I-S, or any other interloper from off-world, would  find hard to break. It was a piece of such excellent good fortune as they  would not have dreamed of three days earlier.    Van Rycke replied, his voice properly sonorous, sounding out the rounded  periods of the rolling tongue which they had all been taught during the  voyage, using Cam's recording. Yes, the Terrans would join with pleasure  in so good and great a cause. They would lend the force of their arms to  the defeat of all gorp they had the good fortune to meet. Groft need only  name the hour for them to join him--    It was not needful, the young Salariki chieftain-to-be hastened to tell  the Cargo-master, that the senior sky lords concern themselves in this  matter. In fact it would be against custom, for it was meet that such a  hunt be left to warriors of few years, that they might earn glory and be  able to stand before the fires at the Naming as men. Therefore--the thumb  claw of Groft was extended to its greatest length as he used it to single  out the Terrans he had been eyeing--let this one, and that, and that, and  the fourth be ready to join with the Salariki party an hour after nooning  on this very day and they would indeed teach the slimy, treacherous  lurkers in the depths a well needed lesson.    The Salarik's choice with one exception had unerringly fallen upon the  youngest members of the crew, Ali, Rip, and Dane in that order. But his  fourth addition had been Jasper Weeks. Perhaps because of his native  pallor of skin and slightness of body the oiler had seemed, to the alien,  to be younger than his years. At any rate Groft had made it very plain  that he chose these men and Dane knew that the Queen's officers would  raise no objection which might upset the delicate balance of favorable  relations.    Van Rycke did ask for one concession which was reluctantly granted. He  received permission for the spacer's men to carry their sleep rods.  Though the Salariki, apparently for some reason of binding and hoary  custom, were totally opposed to hunting their age-old enemy with anything  other than their duelists' weapons of net and claw knife.    \"Go along with them,\" Captain Jellico gave his final orders to the four,  \"as long as it doesn't mean your own necks--understand? On the other hand  dead heroes have never helped to lift a ship. And these gorp are tough  from all accounts. You'll just have to use your own judgment about  springing your rods on them--\" He looked distinctly unhappy at that  thought.    Ali was grinning and little Weeks tightened his weapon belt with a touch  of swagger he had never shown before. Rip was his usual soft voiced self,  dependable as a rock and a good base for the rest of them--taking command  without question as they marched off to join Groft's company.          Chapter V    THE PERILOUS SEAS      The gorp hunters straggled through the grass forest in family groups, and  the Terrans saw that the enterprise had forced another uneasy truce upon  the district, for there were representatives from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16927"],[0,"Tacitus: The Histories, Volumes I and II (#8)"],[1,"good of waiting  until Otho sets his camp in order and approaches the Capitol, while  Galba peeps out of a window? Are this famous general and his gallant  friends to shut the doors and not to stir a foot over the threshold,  as if they were anxious to endure a siege? Much help may we hope from  slaves, when once the unwieldy crowd loses its unity and their first  indignation, which counts for so much, begins to cool. No, cowardice  is too risky. Or if we must fall, let us meet the danger half-way, and  cover Otho with disgrace, ourselves with honour.'    When Vinius resisted this proposal, Laco, prompted by Icelus,  assailed him with threats, persisting in his private quarrel to the  ruin of his country. Galba without further delay supported those        34  whose plan would look best. However, Piso was first dispatched to the  camp. The young man had a great name, his popularity was still fresh,  and moreover, he disliked Titus Vinius, or, if he did not, Vinius'  enemies hoped he did: it is so easy to believe in hatred. Scarcely had  Piso departed, when there arrived a rumour that Otho had been killed  in the camp. At first it was vague and uncertain, but eventually, as  so often happens with daring lies, people began to assert that they  had been present and seen the deed. Some were glad and some  indifferent, so the news gained easy credence. Many, however, thought  that the report had been concocted and disseminated by friends of  Otho, who now mingled in the crowd and tried to lure Galba out by  spreading this agreeable falsehood. At this point not only the          35  populace and the inexperienced mob but many of the knights and  senators as well broke out into applause and unbridled enthusiasm.  With their fear they had lost their caution. Breaking open the palace  gates they rushed in and presented themselves before Galba,  complaining that they had been forestalled in the task of revenge. All  the cowards who, as events proved, could show no pluck in action,  indulged in excessive heroics and lip-courage. Nobody knew, everybody  talked. At last, for lack of the truth, Galba yielded to the consensus  of error. When he had put on his breastplate he was lifted into a  chair, for he was too old and infirm to stand against the crowds that  kept flocking in. In the palace he was met by Julius Atticus, of the  Body Guard, who displayed a dripping sword and shouted out that he had  killed Otho. 'Comrade,' said Galba, 'who bade you?' Galba had a  remarkable power of curbing soldiers' presumption, for he was not  afraid of threats nor moved by flattery.    Meanwhile in Otho's camp there was no longer any doubt of the           36  soldiers' unanimity. Such was their enthusiasm that they were not  content with carrying Otho shoulder-high in procession; they placed  him among the standards on the platform, where shortly before a gilt  statue of Galba had stood, and made a ring round him with their  colours.[61] Tribunes and centurions were allowed no approach: the  common soldiers even called out, 'Beware of the officers.' The whole  camp resounded with confused shouts of mutual encouragement. It was  quite unlike the wavering and spiritless flattery of a civil mob. As  new adherents streamed in, directly a soldier caught sight of one of  them, he grasped him by the hand, flung his arms round him, kept him  at his side, and dictated the oath of allegiance. Some commended their  general to his soldiers, and some the soldiers to their general. Otho,  for his part, was not slow to greet the crowd with outstretched hand  and throw kisses to them. In every way he played the slave to gain a  throne. When the whole legion of the marines had sworn allegiance, he  gained confidence in his strength, and, considering that those whom he  had incited individually needed a few words of general encouragement,  he stood out on the rampart and began as follows:--'In what guise       37  I come forward to address you, Fellow Soldiers, I cannot tell. Dubbed  emperor by you, I dare not call myself a private citizen: yet  \"emperor\" I cannot say with another on the throne. And what am I to  call you? That too will remain in doubt until it is decided whether  you have here in your camp an enemy or an emperor of Rome. You hear  how they clamour at once for my death and your punishment. So clear is  it that we must fall or stand together. Doubtless Galba--such is his  clemency--has already promised our destruction. Is he not the man who  without the least excuse butchered thousands of utterly innocent  soldiers?[62] I shudder whenever I recall his ghastly entry into the  city, when before the face of Rome he ordered the decimation of the  troops whom at their humble petition he had taken under his  protection. That is Galba's only \"victory\". These were the auspices  under which he made his entry; and what glory has he brought to the  throne he occupies, save the murder of Obultronius Sabinus and  Cornelius Marcellus in Spain, of Betuus Cilo in Gaul, of Fonteius  Capito in Germany, of Clodius Macer in Africa, of Cingonius on his  march to Rome, of Turpilianus in the city, and of Nymphidius in the  camp? What province is there in the empire that has not been polluted  with massacre? He calls it \"salutary correction\". For his \"remedies\"  are what other people call crimes: his cruelty is disguised as  \"austerity\", his avarice as \"economy\", while by \"discipline\" he means  punishing and insulting you. It is but seven months since Nero's  death, and already Icelus alone has embezzled more than all the  depredations of Polyclitus and Vatinius and Aegialus[63] put together.  Why, Vinius would have been less greedy and lawless had he been  emperor himself. As it is, he treats us as his own subjects and  despises us as Galba's. His own fortune alone could provide the  largess which they daily cast in your teeth but never pay into your  pocket.    'Nor in Galba's successor either is there any hope for you. Galba       38  has seen to that. He has recalled from exile the man whose avarice and  sour temper he judged most like his own. You witnessed for yourselves,  my comrades, the extraordinary storm which signified Heaven's  abhorrence at that ill-starred adoption. The Senate and People of Rome  feel the same. They are counting on your courage. You alone can give  strength to the right policy: it is powerless without you, however  good it be. It is not to war and danger that I call you. All the  troops are with us. That single plain-clothes cohort[64] is no longer  a defence to Galba, but a hindrance. When once they have caught sight  of you, when once they come to take their orders from me, the only  quarrel between you will be who can do most to put me in their debt.  There is no room for delay in plans which cannot be commended until  they are put into action.'    Otho then gave orders to open the arsenal. The soldiers immediately  seized their arms in such haste that all the ordinary distinctions of  the service were neglected: neither Guards nor Legionaries carried  their own arms:[65] in the confusion they took the helmets and shields  of the auxiliaries. There were no tribunes or centurions to encourage  them: each man followed his own lead, and the rascals found their  chief incentive in the consternation of the loyal. As the riot          39  increased, Piso, alarmed by the din of their shouts, which could be  heard even in the city, had overtaken Galba, who had meanwhile left  the palace and was approaching the Forum. Marius Celsus had also  brought back no good news. Some were for returning to the palace,  others for seeking the shelter of the Capitol, many for seizing the  Rostra. The majority merely disagreed with other people's proposals,  and, as so often happens in these disasters, the best course always  seemed the one for which it was now too late. It is said that Laco,  without Galba's knowledge, proposed the assassination of Titus Vinius,  either with the idea that his execution would be a sop to the  soldiers, or because he believed him Otho's accomplice, or, as a last  alternative, hatred may have been his motive. However, the time and  the place both bred scruples; when killing once begins it is difficult  to set a limit: besides, their plans were upset by the arrival of  terrified messengers, by the continual desertion of their supporters,  and by a general waning of enthusiasm even among those who at first  had been the keenest to display their loyalty and courage.    Galba was driven hither and thither by the tide of the surging          40  mob. The temples and public buildings[66] were crowded with  spectators, who viewed a sorry scene. No shouts came from the crowd:  astonishment was on their faces, and their ears open to every sound.  There was neither uproar nor quiet, but the silence of strong emotion  and alarm. However, a report reached Otho that the populace was  arming. He bade his men fly headlong to forestall the danger. Off went  the Roman soldiers as if they were going to drag Vologaesus or Pacorus  from the ancestral throne of the Arsacids[67]--and not to butcher  their own emperor, a helpless old man. Armed to the teeth, they broke  at a full gallop into the Forum, scattering the populace and trampling  senators under foot. Neither the sight of the Capitol nor the sanctity  of the temples towering above them, nor the thought of Roman emperors  past and to come, could avail to deter them from committing that crime  which the next successor always avenges.    Seeing the armed ranks now close at hand, the standard-bearer of        41  the cohort on guard over Galba[68]--tradition says his name was  Atilius Vergilio--tore off the medallion of Galba[69] and flung it to  the ground. This signal clearly showed that all the troops were for  Otho: the people fled from the deserted Forum and swords were drawn  against any who lingered.
