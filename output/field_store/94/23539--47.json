You observe, we must have made it quite  full of steam to have it sent out in that great quantity. And now, as we  can convert the water into steam by heat, we convert it back into liquid  water by the application of cold. And if we take a glass, or any other  cold thing, and hold it over this steam, see how soon it gets damp with  water; it will condense it until the glass is warm--it condenses the water  which is now running down the sides of it.  I have here another experiment  to shew the condensation of water from a vaporous state back into a liquid  state, in the same way as the vapour, one of the products of the candle,  was condensed against the bottom of the dish, and obtained in the form of  water; and to shew you how truly and thoroughly these changes take place,  I will take this tin flask, which is now full of steam, and close the top.  We shall see what takes place when we cause this water or steam to return  back to the fluid state by pouring some cold water on the outside. [The  Lecturer poured the cold water over the vessel, when it immediately  collapsed.]  You see what has happened.  If I had closed the stopper, and  still kept the heat applied to it, it would have burst the vessel; yet,  when the steam returns to the state of water, the vessel collapses, there  being a vacuum produced inside by the condensation of the steam. I shew  you these experiments for the purpose of pointing out that in all these  occurrences there is nothing that changes the water into any other  thing--it still remains water; and so the vessel is obliged to give way,  and is crushed inwards, as in the other case, by the further application  of heat, it would have been blown outwards.    [Illustration: Fig. 12.]    And what do you think the bulk of that water is when it assumes the  vaporous condition? You see that cube [pointing to a cubic foot]. There,  by its side, is a cubic inch, exactly the same shape as the cubic foot,  and that bulk of water [the cubic inch] is sufficient to expand into that  bulk [the cubic foot] of steam; and, on the contrary, the application of  cold will contract that large quantity of steam into this small quantity  of water.    [Illustration: Fig. 13.]    [One of the iron bottles burst at that moment.] Ah! There is one of our  bottles burst, and here you see is a crack down one side an eighth of an  inch in width. [The other now exploded, sending the freezing mixture in  all directions.] This other bottle is also broken; although the iron was  nearly half-an-inch thick, the ice has burst it asunder. These changes  always take place in water: they do not require to be always produced by  artificial means,--we only use them here because we want to produce a  small winter round that little bottle, instead of a long and severe one.  But if you go to Canada, or to the North, you will find the temperature  there out of doors will do the same thing as has been done here by the  freezing mixture.    To return to our quiet philosophy. We shall not in future be deceived,  therefore, by any changes that are produced in water. Water is the same  everywhere, whether produced from the ocean or from the flame of the  candle. Where, then, is this water which we get from a candle? I must  anticipate a little, and tell you. It evidently comes, as to part of it,  from the candle; but is it within the candle beforehand? No. It is not in  the candle; and it is not in the air round about the candle which is  necessary for its combustion. It is neither in one nor the other, but it  comes from their conjoint action, a part from the candle, a part from the  air; and this we have now to trace, so that we may understand thoroughly  what is the chemical history of a candle when we have it burning on our  table. How shall we get at this? I myself know plenty of ways, but I want  _you_ to get at it from the association in your own minds of what I have  already told you.    I think you can see a little in this way. We had just now the case of a  substance which acted upon the water in the way that Sir Humphrey Davy  shewed us[13], and which I am now going to recall to your minds by making  again an experiment upon that dish. It is a thing which we have to handle  very carefully, for you see, if I allow a little splash of water to come  upon this mass, it sets fire to part of it; and if there were free access  of air, it would quickly set fire to the whole. Now, this is a metal--a  beautiful and bright metal--which rapidly changes in the air, and, as you  know, rapidly changes in water. I will put a piece on the water, and you  see it burns beautifully, making a floating lamp, using the water in the  place of air. Again, if we take a few iron filings or turnings, and put  them in water, we find that they likewise undergo an alteration. They do  not change so much as this potassium does, but they change somewhat in the  same way; they become rusty, and shew an action upon the water, though in  a different degree of intensity to what this beautiful metal does: but  they act upon the water in the same manner generally as this potassium. I  want you to put these different facts together in your minds. I have  another metal here [zinc], and when we examined it with regard to the  solid substance produced by its combustion, we had an opportunity of  seeing that it burned; and I suppose, if I take a little strip of this  zinc and put it over the candle, you will see something half-way, as it  were, between the combustion of potassium on the water and the action of  iron,--you see there is a sort of combustion. It has burned, leaving a  white ash or residuum, and here also we find that the metal has a certain  amount of action upon water.    By degrees we have learned how to modify the action of these different  substances, and to make them tell us what we want to know. And now, first  of all, I take iron. It is a common thing in all chemical reactions, where  we get any result of this kind, to find that it is increased by the action  of heat; and if we want to examine minutely and carefully the action of  bodies one upon another, we often have to refer to the action of heat. You  are aware, I believe, that iron-filings burn beautifully in the air; but I  am about to shew you an experiment of this kind, because it will impress  upon you what I am going to say about iron in its action on water. If I  take a flame and make it hollow;--you know why, because I want to get air  to it and into it, and therefore I make it hollow--and then take a few  iron-filings and drop them into the flame, you see how well they burn.  That combustion results from the chemical action which is going on when we  ignite those particles. And so we proceed to consider these different  effects, and ascertain what iron will do when it meets with water. It will  tell us the story so beautifully, so gradually and regularly, that I think  it will please you very much.    I have here a furnace with a pipe going through it like an iron  gun-barrel, and I have stuffed that barrel full of bright iron-turnings,  and placed it across the fire, to be made red-hot. We can either send air  through the barrel to come in contact with the iron, or we can send steam  from this little boiler at the end of the barrel. Here is a stop-cock  which shuts off the steam from the barrel until we wish to admit it. There  is some water in these glass jars, which I have coloured blue, so that you  may see what happens. Now, you know very well that any steam I might send  through that barrel, if it went through into the water, would be  condensed; for you have seen that steam cannot retain its gaseous form if  it be cooled down.    [Illustration: Fig. 14.]    You saw it here [pointing to the tin flask] crushing itself into a small  bulk, and causing the flask holding it to collapse; so that if I were to  send steam through that barrel, it would be condensed--supposing the  barrel were cold: it is, therefore, heated to perform the experiment I am  now about to shew you. I am going to send the steam through the barrel in  small quantities; and you shall judge for yourselves, when you see it  issue from the other end, whether it still remains steam. Steam is  condensible into water, and when you lower the temperature of steam, you  convert it back into fluid water; but I have lowered the temperature of  the gas which I have collected in this jar, by passing it through water  after it has traversed the iron barrel, and still it does not change back  into water. I will take another test and apply to this gas. (I hold the  jar in an inverted position, or my substance would escape.) If I now apply  a light to the mouth of the jar, it ignites with a slight noise. That  tells you that it is not steam. Steam puts out a fire--it does not burn;  but you saw that what I had in that jar burnt. We may obtain this  substance equally from water produced from the candle-flame as from any  other source. When it is obtained by the action of the iron upon the  aqueous vapour, it leaves the iron in a state very similar to that in  which these filings were after they were burnt. It makes the iron heavier  than it was before. So long as the iron remains in the tube and is heated,  and is cooled again without the access of air or water, it does not change  in its weight; but after having had this current of steam passed over it,  it then comes out heavier that it was before, having taken something out  of the steam, and having allowed something else to pass forth, which we  see here. And now, as we have another jar full, I will shew you something  most interesting. It is a combustible gas; and I might at once take this  jar and set fire to the contents, and shew you that it is combustible; but  I intend to shew you more if I can. It is also a very light substance.  Steam will condense: this body will rise in the air, and not condense.

If not  coincidences, such likenesses are too vague to be valuable  historically.[15]    Another much disputed point must be spoken of in connection with this  subject. In the Veda and in the Avesta there is mentioned the land of  the 'seven rivers.' Now seven rivers are often spoken of in the Rig  Veda, but only once does this term mean the country, while in the  'Hymn to the Rivers' no less than twenty-one streams are enumerated  (RV. X. 75). In order to make out the 'seven rivers' scholars have  made different combinations, that most in favor being Mueller's, the  five rivers of the Punj[=a]b together with the Kabul and (Swat or)  Sarasvat[=i]. But in point of fact 'seven' quite as often means many,  as it does an exact number, and this, the older use, may well be  applied here. It is quite impossible to identify the seven, and it is  probable that no Vedic poet ever imagined them to be a group of this  precise number. It would be far easier to select a group of seven  conspicuous rivers, if anywhere, on the west of the Indus. A very  natural group from the Iranian side would be the Her[=i]r[=u]d,  Hilmund, Arghand[=a]b, Kurum, Kabul, Indus, and Vitast[=a]. Against  this, however, can be urged that the term 'seven rivers' may be  Bactrian, older than the Vedic period; and that, in particular, the  Avesta distinguishes Vaikerta, Urva, and other districts from the  'seven rivers.' It is best to remain uncertain in so doubtful a  matter, bearing in mind that even Kurukshetra, the 'holy land,' is  said to-day to be watered by 'seven streams,' although some say nine;  apropos of which fact Cunningham remarks, giving modern examples, that  \"the Hindus invariably assign seven branches to all their rivers.\"[16]    Within the Punj[=a]b, the Vedic Aryans, now at last really 'Hindus,'  having extended themselves to the Cutudri (Catadru, Sutlej), a  formidable barrier, and eventually having crossed even this, the last  tributary's of the Indus, descended to the jumna (Yamun[=a]), over the  little stream called 'the Rocky' (Drishadvat[=i]) and the lesser  Sarasvat[=i], southeast from Lahore and near Delhi, in the region  Kurukshetra, afterwards famed as the seat of the great epic war, and  always regarded as holy in the highest degree.    Not till the time of the Atharva Veda do the Aryans appear as far east  as Benares (V[=a]r[=a]nas[=i], on the 'Varan[=a]vat[=i]'), though the  Sarayu is mentioned in the Rik. But this scarcely is the tributary of  the Ganges, Gogra, for the name seems to refer to a more western  stream, since it is associated with the Gomat[=i] (Gomal). One may  surmise that in the time of the Rig Veda the Aryans knew only by name  the country east of Lucknow. It is in the Punj[=a]b and a little to  the west and east of it (how far it is impossible to state with  accuracy) where lies the real theatre of activity of the Rig Vedic  people.    Some scholars believe that this people had already heard of the two  oceans. This point again is doubtful in the extreme. No descriptions  imply a knowledge of ocean, and the word for ocean means merely a  'confluence' of waters, or in general a great oceanic body of water  like the air. As the Indus is too wide to be seen across, the name may  apply in most cases to this river. An allusion to 'eastern and western  floods,'[17] which is held by some to be conclusive evidence for a  knowledge of the two seas, is taken by others to apply to the  air-oceans. The expression may apply simply to rivers, for it is said  that the Vip[=a]c and Cutudr[=i] empty into the 'ocean', i.e., the  Indus or the Cutudr[=i]'s continuation.[18] One late verse alone  speaks of the Sarasvat[=i] pouring into the ocean, and this would  indicate the Arabian Sea.[19] Whether the Bay of Bengal was known,  even by hearsay and in the latest time of this period, remains  uncertain. As a body the Aryans of the Rig Veda were certainly not  acquainted with either ocean. Some straggling adventurers probably  pushed down the Indus, but Zimmer doubtless is correct in asserting  that the popular emigration did not extend further south than the  junction of the Indus and the Pa[=n]canada (the united five  rivers).[20] The extreme south-eastern geographical limit of the Rig  Vedic people may be reckoned (not, however, in Oldenberg's opinion,  with any great certainty) as being in Northern Beh[=a]r (M[=a]gadha).  The great desert, Marusthala, formed an impassable southern obstacle  for the first immigrants.[21]    On the other hand, the two oceans are well known to the Atharva Veda,  while the geographical (and hence chronological) difference between  the Rik and the Atharvan is furthermore illustrated by the following  facts: in the Rig Veda wolf and lion are the most formidable beasts;  the tiger is unknown and the elephant seldom alluded to; while in the  Atharvan the tiger has taken the lion's place and the elephant is a  more familiar figure. Now the tiger has his domicile in the swampy  land about Benares, to which point is come the Atharvan Aryan, but not  the Rig Vedic people. Here too, in the Atharvan, the panther is first  mentioned, and for the first time silver and iron are certainly  referred to. In the Rig Veda the metals are bronze and gold, silver  and iron being unknown.[22] Not less significant are the trees. The  ficus religiosa, the tree later called the 'tree of the gods'  (_deva-sadana, acvattha_), under which are fabled to sit the  divinities in heaven, is scarcely known in the Rig Veda, but is well  known in the Atharvan; while India's grandest tree, the _nyagrodha_,  ficus indica, is known to the Atharvan and Brahmanic period, but is  utterly foreign to the Rig Veda. Zimmer deems it no less significant  that fishes are spoken of in the Atharvan and are mentioned only once  in the Rig Veda, but this may indicate a geographical difference less  than one of custom. In only one doubtful passage is the north-east  monsoon alluded to. The storm so vividly described in the Rig Veda is  the south-west monsoon which is felt in the northern Punj[=a]b. The  north-east monsoon is felt to the southeast of the Punj[=a]b, possibly  another indication of geographical extension, withal within the limits  of the Rig Veda itself.    The seat of culture shifts in the Brahmanic period, which follows that  of the Vedic poems, and is found partly in the 'holy land' of the  west, and partly in the east (Beh[=a]r, Tirhut).[23] The literature of  this period comes from Aryans that have passed out of the Punj[=a]b.  Probably, as we have said, settlements were left all along the line of  progress. Even before the wider knowledge of the post-Alexandrine  imperial age (at which time there was a north-western military  retrogression), and, from the Vedic point of view, as late as the end  of the Brahmanic period, in the time of the Upanishads, the northwest  seems still to have been familiarly known.[24]           *       *       *       *       *           FOOTNOTES:         [Footnote 1: We take this opportunity of stating that by the       religions of the Aryan Hindus we mean the religions of a       people who, undoubtedly, were full-blooded Aryans at first,       however much their blood may have been diluted later by       un-Aryan admixture. Till the time of Buddhism the religious       literature is fairly Aryan. In the period of \"Hinduism\"       neither people nor religion can claim to be quite Aryan.]         [Footnote 2: If, as thinks Schrader, the Aryans' original       seat was on the Volga, then one must imagine the       Indo-Iranians to have kept together in a south-eastern       emigration.]         [Footnote 3: That is to say, frequent reference is made to       'five tribes.'
