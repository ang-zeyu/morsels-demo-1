But Philochorus says that Theseus had one Nausithous sent him from  Skirus of Salamis, to steer the ship, and Phaeax to act as look-out, as  the Athenians had not yet turned their attention to the sea.    One of the youths chosen by lot was Menestheos the son of Skirus's  daughter. The truth of this account is attested by the shrines of  Nausithous and Phaeax, which Theseus built at Phalerum, and by the feast  called the Kybernesia or pilot's festival, which is held in their  honour.    XVIII. When the lots were drawn Theseus brought the chosen youths from  the Prytaneum, and proceeding to the temple of the Delphian Apollo,  offered the suppliants' bough to Apollo on their behalf. This was a  bough of the sacred olive-tree bound with fillets of white wool. And  after praying he went to sea on the sixth day of the month Munychion, on  which day even now they send maidens as suppliants to the temple of the  Delphian Apollo. And there is a legend that the Delphian oracle told him  that Aphrodite would be his guide and fellow-traveller, and that when he  was sacrificing a she-goat to her by the seaside, it became a he-goat;  wherefore the goddess is called Epitragia.    XIX. When they reached Crete, according to most historians and poets,  Ariadne fell in love with him, and from her he received the clue of  string, and was taught how to thread the mazes of the Labyrinth. He slew  the Minotaur, and, taking with him Ariadne and the youths, sailed away.  Pherekydes also says that Theseus also knocked out the bottoms of the  Cretan ships, to prevent pursuit. But Demon says that Taurus, Minos's  general, was slain in a sea-fight in the harbour, when Theseus sailed  away. But according to Philochorus, when Minos instituted his games,  Taurus was expected to win every prize, and was grudged this honour; for  his great influence and his unpopular manners made him disliked, and  scandal said, that he was too intimate with Pasiphae. On this account,  when Theseus offered to contend with him, Minos agreed. And, as it was  the custom in Crete for women as well as men to be spectators of the  games, Ariadne was present, and was struck with the appearance of  Theseus, and his strength, as he conquered all competitors. Minos was  especially pleased, in the wrestling match, at Taurus's defeat and  shame, and, restoring the children to Theseus, remitted the tribute for  the future. Kleidemus tells the story in his own fashion and at  unnecessary length, beginning much farther back. There was, he says, a  decree passed by all the Greeks, that no ship should sail from any post  with more than five hands on board, but Jason alone, the master of the  great ship Argo, should cruise about, and keep the sea free of pirates.  Now when Daedalus fled to Athens, Minos, contrary to the decree, pursued  him in long war galleys, and being driven to Sicily by a storm, died  there. When his son Deukalion sent a warlike message to the Athenians,  bidding them give up Daedalus to him, or else threatening that he would  put to death the children whom Minos had taken as hostages, Theseus  returned him a gentle answer, begging for the life of Daedalus, who was  his own cousin and blood relation, being the son of Merope, the daughter  of Erechtheus. But he busied himself with building a fleet, some of it  in Attica, in the country of the Thymaitadae, far from any place of  resort of strangers, and some in Troezen, under the management of  Pittheus, as he did not wish his preparations to be known. But when the  ships were ready to set sail, having with him as pilots, Daedalus  himself and some Cretan exiles, as no one knew that he was coming, and  the Cretans thought that it was a friendly fleet that was advancing, he  seized the harbour, and marched at once to Knossus before his arrival  was known. Then he fought a battle at the gates of the Labyrinth, and  slew Deukalion and his body-guard. As Ariadne now succeeded to the  throne, he made peace with her, took back the youths, and formed an  alliance between the Cretans and the Athenians, in which each nation  swore that it would not begin a war against the other.    XX. There are many more stories about these events, and about Ariadne,  none of which agree in any particulars. Some say that she hanged herself  when deserted by Theseus, and some, that she was taken to Naxos by his  sailors, and there dwelt with Oenarus, the priest of Dionysus, having  been deserted by Theseus, who was in love with another.        \"For Aegle's love disturbed his breast.\"    This line, we are told by Hereas of Megara, was struck out of Hesiod's  poems by Peisistratus; and again he says that he inserted into Homer's  description of the Shades,        \"Peirithous and Theseus, born of gods,\"    to please the Athenians. Some writers say that Theseus had by Ariadne  two sons, Staphylus and Oenopion, whom Ion of Chios follows when he  speaks of his own native city as that        \"Which erst Oenopion stablished, Theseus' son.\"    The pleasantest of these legends are in nearly every one's mouth. But  Paeon of Amathus gives an account peculiar to himself, that Theseus was  driven by a storm to Cyprus, and that Ariadne, who was pregnant,  suffered much from the motion of the ship, and became so ill, that she  was set on shore, but Theseus had to return to take charge of the ship,  and was blown off to sea. The women of the country took care of Ariadne,  and comforted her in her bereavement, even bringing forged letters to  her as if from Theseus, and rendering her assistance during her  confinement; and when she died in childbirth, they buried her. Theseus,  on his return, grieved much, and left money to the people of the  country, bidding them sacrifice to Ariadne; he also set up two little  statues, one of silver, and the other of brass. And at this sacrifice,  which takes place on the second day of the month Gorpiaeus, one of the  young men lies down on the ground, and imitates the cries of a woman in  travail; and the people of Amathus call that the grove of Ariadne  Aphrodite, in which they show her tomb.    But some writers of Naxos tell a different story, peculiar to  themselves, that there were two Minoses and two Ariadnes, of whom one,  they say, was married to Dionysus in Naxos, and was the mother of  Staphylus and his brother, while the younger was carried off by Theseus,  and came to Naxos after he deserted her; and a nurse called Korkyne came  with her, whose tomb they point out. Then Naxians also says that this  Ariadne died there, and is honoured, but not so much as the elder; for  at the feast in honour of the elder, there are merriment and revelry,  but at that of the younger gloomy rites are mingled with mirth.    XXI. Theseus, when he sailed away from Crete, touched at Delos; here he  sacrificed to the god and offered up the statue of Aphrodite, which  Ariadne had given him; and besides this, he and the youths with him  danced a measure which they say is still practised by the people of  Delos to this day, being an imitation of the turnings and windings of  the Labyrinth expressed by complicated evolutions performed in regular  order. This kind of dance is called by the Delians \"the crane dance,\"  according to Dikaearchus. It was danced round the altar of the Horns,  which is all formed of horns from the left side. They also say that he  instituted games at Delos, and that then for the first time a palm was  given by him to the victor.    XXII. As he approached Attica, both he and his steersman in their  delight forgot to hoist the sail which was to be a signal of their  safety to Aegeus; and he in his despair flung himself down the cliffs  and perished. Theseus, as soon as he reached the harbour, performed at  Phalerum the sacrifices which he had vowed to the gods if he returned  safe, and sent off a herald to the city with the news of his safe  return. This man met with many who were lamenting the death of the king,  and, as was natural, with others who were delighted at the news of their  safety, and who congratulated him and wished to crown him with garlands.  These he received, but placed them on his herald's staff, and when he  came back to the seashore, finding that Theseus had not completed his  libation, he waited outside the temple, not wishing to disturb the  sacrifice. When the libation was finished he announced the death of  Aegeus, and then they all hurried up to the city with loud lamentations:  wherefore to this day, at the Oschophoria, they say that it is not the  herald that is crowned, but his staff, and that at the libations the  bystanders cry out, \"Eleleu, Iou, Iou;\" of which cries the first is used  by men in haste, or raising the paean for battle, while the second is  used by persons in surprise and trouble.    Theseus, after burying his father, paid his vow to Apollo, on the  seventh day of the month Pyanepsion; for on this day it was that the  rescued youths went up into the city. The boiling of pulse, which is  customary on this anniversary, is said to be done because the rescued  youths put what remained of their pulse together into one pot, boiled it  all, and merrily feasted on it together. And on this day also, the  Athenians carry about the Eiresione, a bough of the olive tree garlanded  with wool, just as Theseus had before carried the suppliants' bough, and  covered with first-fruits of all sorts of produce, because the  barrenness of the land ceased on that day; and they sing,        \"Eiresione, bring us figs         And wheaten loaves, and oil,      And wine to quaff, that we may all         Host merrily from toil.\"    However, some say that these ceremonies are performed in memory of the  Herakleidae, who were thus entertained by the Athenians; but most  writers tell the tale as I have told it.    XXIII. Now the thirty-oared ship, in which Theseus sailed with the  youths, and came back safe, was kept by the Athenians up to the time of  Demetrius Phalereus.

Only when we come to his quite recent landscapes (1896), can we link him  to Monet and Renoir as colourist, and he has been more their friend than  their colleague.    Degas is known by the select few, and almost ignored by the public. This  is due to several reasons. Degas has never wished to exhibit at the  Salons, except, I believe, once or twice at the beginning of his  career. He has only shown his works at those special exhibitions  arranged by the Impressionists in hired apartments (rue le Peletier, rue  Laffitte, Boulevard des Capucines), and at some art-dealers. The art of  Degas has never had occasion to shock the public by the exuberance of  its colour, because he restricted himself to grey and quiet harmonies.  Degas is a modest character, fond of silence and solitude, with a horror  of the crowd and of controversies, and almost disinclined to show his  works. He is a man of intelligence and ready wit, whose sallies are  dreaded; he is almost a misanthrope. His pictures have been gradually  sold to foreign countries and dispersed in rich galleries without having  been seen by the public. His character is, in short, absolutely opposed  to that of Manet, who, though he suffered from criticism, thought it his  duty to bid it defiance. Degas's influence has, however, been  considerable, though secretly so, and the young painters have been  slowly inspired by his example.    [Illustration: DEGAS    THE BEGGAR WOMAN]    Degas is beyond all a draughtsman of the first order. His spirit is  quite classical. He commenced by making admirable copies of the Italian  Primitives, notably of Fra Angelico, and the whole first series of his  works speaks of that influence: portraits, heads of deep, mat, amber  colour, on a ground of black or grey tones, remarkable for a severity of  intense style, and for the rare gift of psychological expression. To  find the equal of these faces--after having stated their classic  descent--one would have to turn to the beautiful things by Ingres, and  certainly Degas is, with Ingres, the most learned, the most perfect  French draughtsman of the nineteenth century. An affirmation of this  nature is made to surprise those who judge Impressionism with  preconceived ideas. It is none the less true that, if a series of  Degas's first portraits were collected, the comparison would force  itself upon one's mind irrefutably. In face of the idealist painting of  Romanticism, Ingres represented quite clearly the cult of painting for  its own sake. His ideas were mediocre, and went scarcely beyond the  poor, conventional ideal of the Academy; but his genius was so great,  that it made him paint, together with his tedious allegories, some  incomparable portraits and nudes. He thought he was serving official  Classicism, which still boasts of his name, but in reality he dominated  it; and, whilst he was an imitator of Raphael, he was a powerful  Realist. The Impressionists admire him as such, and agree with him in  banishing from the art of painting all literary imagination, whether it  be the tedious mythology of the School, or the historical anecdote of  the Romanticists. Degas and Besnard admire Ingres as colossal  draughtsman, and, beyond all, as man who, in spite of the limitations of  his mind, preserved the clear vision of the mission of his art at a time  when art was used for the expression of literary conceptions. Who would  have believed it? Yet it is true, and Manet, too, held the same view of  Ingres, little as our present academicians may think it! It happens that  to-day Impressionism is more akin to Ingres than to Delacroix, just as  the young poets are more akin to Racine than to Hugo. They reject the  foreign elements, and search, before anything else, for the strict  national tradition. Degas follows Ingres and resembles him. He is also  reminiscent of the Primitives and of Holbein. There is, in his first  period, the somewhat dry and geometrical perfection, the somewhat heavy  colour which only serves to strengthen the correctness of the planes. At  the Exposition of 1900, there was a Degas which surprised everybody. It  was an _Interior of a cotton factory_ in an American town. This small  picture was curiously clear: it would be impossible to paint better and  with a more accomplished knowledge of the laws of painting. But it was  the work of a soulless, emotionless Realist; it was a coloured  photograph of unheard-of truth, the mathematical science of which left  the beholder cold. This work, which is very old (it dates back to about  1860), gave no idea of what Degas has grown into. It was the work of an  unemotional master of technique; only just the infinitely delicate value  of the greys and blacks revealed the future master of harmony. One  almost might have wished to find a fault in this aggravating perfection.  But Degas was not to remain there, and already, about that time, certain  portraits of his are elevated by an expression of ardent melancholy, by  warm, ivory-like, grave colouring which attracts one's eye. Before this  series one feels the firm will of a very logical, serious, classic  spirit who wants to know thoroughly the intimate resources of design,  before risking to choose from among them the elements which respond best  to his individual nature. If Degas was destined to invent, later on, so  personal a style of design that he could be accused of \"drawing badly,\"  this first period of his life is before us, to show the slow maturing of  his boldness and how carefully he first proved to himself his knowledge,  before venturing upon new things. In art the difficulty is, when one has  learnt everything, to forget,--that is, to appear to forget, so as to  create one's own style, and this apparent forgetting cloaks an  amalgamation of science with mind. And Degas is one of those patient and  reticent men who spend years in arriving at this; he has much in common  with Hokusai, the old man \"mad with painting,\" who at the close of his  prodigious life invented arbitrary forms, after having given immortal  examples of his interpretation of the real.    [Illustration: DEGAS    THE LESSON IN THE FOYER]    Degas is also clearly related to Corot, not only in the silvery  harmonies of his suave landscapes, but also, and particularly, in his  admirable faces whose inestimable power and moving sincerity we have  hardly commenced to understand. Degas passed slowly from classicism to  modernity. He never liked outbursts of colour; he is by no means an  Impressionist from this point of view. As a draughtsman of genius he  expresses all by the precision of the planes and values; a grey, a black  and some notes of colour suffice for him. This might establish a link  between him and Whistler, though he is much less mysterious and diffuse.  Whenever Degas plays with colour, it is with the same restraint of his  boldness; he never goes to excess in abandoning himself to its charm. He  is neither lyrical, nor voluptuous; his energy is cold; his wise spirit  affirms soberly the true character of a face or an object.    Since a long time this spirit has moved Degas to revel in the  observation of contemporary life. His nature has been that of a patient  psychologist, a minute analyst, and also of a bitter ironist. The man is  very little known. His friends say that he has an easily ruffled  delicacy, a sensibility open to poetry, but jealous of showing its  emotion. They say that Degas's satirical bitterness is the reverse side  of a soul wounded by the spectacle of modern morality. One feels this  sentiment in his work, where the sharp notation of truth is painful,  where the realism is opposed by colouring of a sober distinction, where  nothing, not even the portrait of a drab, could be vulgar. Degas has  devoted himself to the profound study of certain classes of women, in  the state of mind of a philosopher and physiologist, impartially  inclined towards life.    His work can be divided into several great series: the race-courses, the  ballet-dancers, and the women bathing count among the most important.  The race-courses have inspired Degas with numerous pictures. He shows in  them a surprising knowledge of the horse. He is one of the most perfect  painters of horses who have ever existed. He has caught the most curious  and truest actions with infallible sureness of sight. His racecourse  scenes are full of vitality and picturesqueness. Against clear skies,  and light backgrounds of lawn, indicated with quiet harmony, Degas  assembles original groups of horses which one can see moving,  hesitating, intensely alive; and nothing could be fresher, gayer and  more deliciously pictorial, than the green, red and yellow notes of the  jockey's costumes strewn like flowers over these atmospheric, luminous  landscapes, where colours do not clash, but are always gently  shimmering, dissolved in uniform clearness. The admirable drawing of  horses and men is so precise and seems so simple, that one can only  slowly understand the extent of the difficulty overcome, the truth of  these attitudes and the nervous delicacy of the execution.    [Illustration: DEGAS    THE DANCING LESSON--PASTEL]    The dancers go much further still in the expression of Degas's  temperament. They have been studied at the _foyer_ of the Opera and at  the rehearsal, sometimes in groups, sometimes isolated. Some pictures  which will always count among the masterpieces of the nineteenth  century, represent the whole _corps de ballet_ performing on the stage  before a dark and empty house. By the feeble light of some lamps the  black coats of the stage managers mix themselves with the gauze skirts.  Here the draughtsman joins the great colourist: the petticoats of pink  or white tulle, the graceful legs covered with flesh-coloured silk, the  arms and the shoulders, and the hair crowned with flowers, offer  motives of exquisite colour and of a tone of living flowers. But the  psychologist "]]]
