The kettle drum is a caldron,  usually of brass or copper, covered with a vellum head bound at the  edge round an iron ring, which fits the circle formed by the upper  part of the metal body. Screws working on this ring tune the vellum  head, or vibrating membrane as we may call it, by tightening or  slackening it, so as to obtain any note of the scale within its  compass. The tonic and dominant are generally required, but other  notes are, in some compositions, used; even octaves have been  employed. The use Beethoven made of kettle drums may be regarded among  the particular manifestations of his genius. Two kettle drums may be  considered among the regular constituents of the orchestra, but this  number has been extended; in one remarkable instance, that of Berlioz  in his Requiem, to eight pairs. According to Mr. Victor de Pontigny,  whose article I am much indebted to (in Sir George Grove's dictionary)  upon the drum, the relative diameters, theoretically, for a pair of  kettle drums are in the proportion of 30 to 26, bass and tenor;  practically the diameter of the drums at the French opera is 29 and  251/4 inches, and of the Crystal Palace band, 28 and 241/4 inches. In  cavalry regiments the drums are slung so as to hang on each side of  the drummers horse's neck. The best drum sticks are of whalebone, each  terminating in a small wooden button covered with sponge. For the bass  drum and side drum I must be content to refer to Mr. Victor de  Pontigny's article, and also for the tambourine, but the Provencal  tambourines I have met with have long, narrow sound bodies, and are  strung with a few very coarse strings which the player sounds with a  hammer. This instrument is the rhythmic bass and support to the simple  galoubet, a cylindrical pipe with two holes in front and one behind,  sounded by the same performer. The English pipe and tabor is a similar  combination, also with one player, of such a pipe and a small  drum-head tambourine. Lastly, to conclude percussion instruments,  cymbals are round metal plates, consisting of an alloy of copper and  tin--say 80 parts to 20--with sunk hollow centers, from which the  Greek name. They are not exactly clashed together to elicit their  sound, but rubbed across each other in a sliding fashion. Like the  triangle, a steel rod, bent into the form indicated by the name, but  open at one corner so as to make it an elastic rod, free at both ends;  the object is to add to the orchestral matter luminous crashes, as it  were, and dazzling points of light, when extreme brilliancy is  required.    In conclusion, I must be allowed to express my obligations to Dr. W.H.  Stone and Mr. Victor Mahillon, to Mr. Ebenezer Prout, Mr. Richard  Shepherd Rockstro, Mr. Lavoix fils, and Dr. H. Riemann, whose writings  concerning wind instruments have materially helped me; to Messrs.  Boosey & Co., and to Messrs. Rudall, Carte & Co., for the loan of the  instruments used in the illustrations; and also to Mr. D.J. Blaikley  and Mr. Henry Carte, for valuable personal aid on the present  occasion. Their kindness in reading through my manuscript--Mr.  Blaikley throughout--and in offering friendly and generous criticisms;  also their presence and assistance by trial of the various  instruments, I cannot adequately thank them for, or sufficiently  extol.    (In the course of this lecture, Mr. Henry Carte played upon a concert  flute, also a B flat and a G flute, an eight-keyed flute, and a  recorder. Mr. D.J. Blaikley continued the illustrations upon the oboe,  bassoon, clarinet, French horn, slide trumpet, valve tenor horn,  cornet a piston, B flat tenor slide trombone, B flat euphonium, B flat  contrabass tuba, and B flat contrabass double slide trombone.)           *       *       *       *       *          HOW GAS CYLINDERS ARE MADE.      The supply of compressed gas in metal cylinders has now assumed the  proportions of an important industry, more especially since it was  found possible, by the Brin process, to obtain oxygen direct from the  atmosphere. The industry is not exactly a new one, for carbon dioxide  and nitrous oxide (the latter for the use of dentists) have been  supplied in a compressed state for many years. Now, with the creation  of the modern amateur photographer, who can make lantern slides, and  the more general adoption of the optical lantern for the purposes of  demonstration and amusement, there has arisen a demand for the  limelight such as was never experienced before, and as the limelight  is dependent upon the two gases, hydrogen and oxygen, for its support,  these gases are now supplied in large quantities commercially. At  first the gas cylinders were made of wrought iron; they were cumbrous  and heavy, and the pressure of the inclosed gas was so low that a  receptacle to hold only ten feet was a most unwieldy concern. But  times have changed, and a cylinder of about the same size, but half  the weight, is now made to hold four times the quantity of gas at the  enormous initial pressure of 1,800 pounds on every square inch. This  means the pressure which an ordinary locomotive boiler has to  withstand multiplied by twelve. The change is due to improved methods  of manufacture and to the employment of mild steel of special quality  in lieu of the wrought iron previously employed. The cylinders are now  made without joint or seam, and the process of manufacture is most  interesting. A short time ago we had an opportunity of watching the  various necessary operations involved in making these cylinders at the  Birmingham works of Messrs. Taunton, Delamard & Co., by whose courtesy  we were enabled to make notes of the process.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    Beginning with the raw material, we were shown a disk of metal like  that shown in Fig. 1, and measuring thirty inches in diameter and  three-quarters of an inch in thickness. From such a \"blank\" a cylinder  destined to hold 100 feet of compressed gas can be constructed, and  the first operation is to heat the \"blank\" in a furnace, and afterward  to stamp it into the cup-like form shown in Fig. 2. To all intents and  purposes this represents the end of a finished cylinder, but it is far  too bulky to form the end of one of the size indicated; indeed, it in  reality contains enough metal to make the entire vessel. By a series  of operations it is now heated and drawn out longer and longer, while  its thickness diminishes and its diameter grows less. These operations  are carried out by means of a number of hydraulic rams, which  regularly decrease in size. Fig. 3 roughly represents one of these  rams with the plunger ready to descend and force its way into the  partially formed red hot gas cylinder, C, and further into the well,  W. The plunger may be compared to a finger and the cylinder to a  glove, while the well may represent a hole into which both are thrust  in order to reduce the thickness of the glove. With huge tongs the  cylinder, fresh from the furnace, is placed in position, but just  before the plunger presses into the red hot cup, one of the workmen  empties into the latter a little water, so as to partially cool the  bottom and prevent its being thrust out by the powerful plunger. Oil  is also used plentifully, so that as the plunger works slowly down the  red hot mass, it is surrounded by smoky flames. It presently forces  the cylinder into the well, and when the end of the stroke is reached,  a stop piece is inserted through an opening in the upper part of the  well, so as to arrest the edge of the cylinder while the reverse  action of drawing out the plunger is proceeded with. Directly the  finger is drawn out of the glove--in other words, immediately the  plunger is raised out of the cylinder--the latter drops down below  with a heavy thud, still in a red hot condition.    [Illustration: FIG 3.]    This operation of hot drawing is repeated again and again in rams of  diminishing size until the cylinder assumes the diameter and length  required. This hot drawing leaves the surface of the metal marked with  longitudinal lines, not unlike the glacier scratches on a rock, albeit  they are straighter and more regular. But the next operation not only  obliterates these markings, and gives the metal a smooth surface like  that of polished silver, but it also confers upon the material a  homogeneity which it did not before possess, and without which it  would never bear the pressure which it is destined to withstand when  finished. This operation consists in a final application of the  hydraulic ram while the metal remains perfectly cold, instead of red  hot, as in the previous cases.    As the result of these various hydraulic operations, we have a  perfectly formed cylinder closed at one end, and we now follow it into  another department of the works, when its open end is once more  brought in a furnace to a red heat. The object of this is to make the  metal soft while the shoulder and neck of the vessel are formed. To  accomplish this, the heated open end of the cylinder is laid  horizontally upon a kind of semicircular cradle, and is held there by  tongs handled by two men. Another workman places over the open end a  die of the form shown in Fig. 4, and while the cylinder is slowly  turned round in its cradle, two sledge hammers are brought down with  frequent blows upon the die, closing in the end of the cylinder, but  leaving a central hole as shown in Fig. 5. Further operations reduce  the opening still more until it is closed altogether, and a projection  is formed as shown at Fig. 6. This projection is now bored through,  and the cylinder is ready for testing.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    [Illustration: FIG. 6.]    The cylinder is submitted to a water test, the liquid being forced in  until the gauge shows a pressure of two tons to the square inch.

But he was sensitive, and yielded to  pressure. He signed the paper presented to him as if he had been a  criminal, and shook the dust of the University from his feet. Within  ten years a new Rector, quite as orthodox as the old, had invited  him to replace his name on the books of the college. It was long,  however, before he returned to an Oxford where only the buildings  were the same. Twenty years from this date an atheistic treatise  might have been written with perfect impunity by any Fellow of any  college. Nobody would even have read it if atheism had been its only  recommendation. The wise indifference of the wise had relieved true  religion from the paralysis of official patronage. But in 1849 the  action of the Rector and Fellows was heartily applauded by the  Visitor, Bishop Phillpotts, the famous Henry of Exeter. Their  behaviour was conscientious, and Dr. Richards, the Rector, was a  model of dignified urbanity. It is unreasonable to blame men for not  being in advance of their age.      CHAPTER III    LIBERTY    Froude's position was now, from a worldly point of view, deplorable.  For the antagonism of High Churchmen he was of course prepared.  \"Never mind,\" he wrote to Clough of The Nemesis, \"if the Puseyites  hate it; they must fear it, and it will work in the mind they have  made sick.\" But he was also assailed in the Protestant press as an  awful example of what the Oxford Movement might engender. His book  was denounced on all sides, even by freethinkers, who regarded it as  a reproach to their cause. The professors of University College,  London, had appointed him to a mastership at Hobart Town in  Australia, for which he applied the year before in the hope that  change of scene might help to re-settle his mind. On reading the  attacks in the newspapers they pusillanimously asked him to  withdraw, and he withdrew. A letter to Clough, dated the 6th of  March, 1849, explains his intellectual and material position at this  time in a vivid and striking manner.    \"I admire Matt. to a very great extent, only I don't see what  business he has to parade his calmness, and lecture us on  resignation, when he has never known what a storm is, and doesn't  know what to resign himself to. I think he only knows the shady side  of nature out of books. Still I think his versifying, and generally  his aesthetic power is quite wonderful .... On the whole he shapes  better than you, I think, but you have marble to cut out, and he has  only clay .... Do you think that if the Council do ask me to give up  I might fairly ask Lord Brougham as their President to get me helped  instead to ever so poor an honest living in the Colonies? I can't  turn hack writer, and I must have something fixed to do. Congreve is  down-hearted about Oxford: not so I. I quite look to coming back in  a very few years.\"    The Archdeacon, conceiving that the best remedy for free thought was  short commons, stopped his son's allowance. Froude would have been  alone in the world, if the brave and generous Kingsley had not come  to his assistance. Like a true Christian, he invited Froude to his  house, and made him at home there. To appreciate the magnanimity of  this offer we must consider that Kinglsey was himself suspected of  being a heretic, and that his prominent association with Froude  brought him letters of remonstrance by every post. He said nothing  about them, and Froude, in perfect ignorance of what he was  inflicting upon his host, stayed two months with him at Ilfracombe  and Lynmouth. Yet Kingsley did not, and could not, agree with  Froude. He was a resolved, serious Christian, and never dreamt of  giving up his ministry. He did not in the least agree with Froude,  who made no impression upon him in argument. He acted from kindness,  and respect for integrity.    Froude, however, could not stay permanently with the Kingsleys. His  father would have nothing to do with him, and in his son's opinion  was right to leave him with the consequences of his own errors. But  the outcry against him had been so violent and excessive as to  provoke a reaction. Froude might be an \"infidel,\" he was not a  criminal, and in resigning his Fellowship he had shown more honesty  than prudence. His position excited the sympathy of influential  persons. Crabb Robinson, though an entire stranger to him, wrote a  public protest against Froude's treatment. Other men, not less  distinguished, went farther. Chevalier Bunsen, the Prussian  Minister, Monckton Milnes, afterwards Lord Houghton, and others  whose names he never knew, subscribed a considerable sum of money  for maintaining the unpopular writer at a German university while he  made a serious study of theological science. But he had had enough  of theology, and the munificent offer was declined, though Bunsen  harangued him enthusiastically for five hours in Carlton Gardens on  the exquisite adaptation of Evangelical doctrines to the human soul,  until Froude began to suspect that they must have originated in the  soul itself.    At this time a greater change than the loss of his Fellowship came  upon Froude. While staying with the Kingsleys at Ilfracombe, he met  Mrs. Kingsley's sister, Charlotte Grenfell, the Argemone of Yeast, a  lady of somewhat wilful, yet most brilliant spirit, with a small  fortune of her own. Miss Grenfell had joined the Church of Rome two  years before, and at that time thought of entering a convent. This  idea was extremely distasteful to her sister and her sister's  husband. Their favourite remedy for feminine caprice was marriage,  and they soon had the satisfaction of seeing Miss Grenfell become  Mrs. Froude. There were some difficulties in the way, for Froude's  prospects were by no means assured, and Mrs. Kingsley felt  occasional scruples. But Froude had confidence in himself, and when  his mind was made up he would not look back.    \"You remember,\" he wrote to Mrs. Kingsley, in 1849, \"I warned you  that I intended to take my own way in life, doing (as I always have  done) in all important matters just what I should think good, at  whatever risk of consequences, and taking no other person's opinion  when it crossed with my own. Now in this matter I feel certain that  the way to save Charlotte most pain is to shorten the struggle, and  that will be best done by being short, peremptory, and decided in  allowing no dictation and no interference .... Charlotte herself is  really magnificent. Every letter shows me larger nobleness of heart.  You cannot go back now, Mrs. Kingsley.\"    Mrs. Kingsley did not go back, and Froude had his way. Before the  wedding, however, another and a novel experience awaited him. His  misfortunes aroused the interest of a rich manufacturer at  Manchester, Mr. Darbishire, who offered him a resident tutorship,  and would have taken him into his own firm, even, as it would seem,  into his own family, if he had desired to become a man of business,  and to live in a smoky town. But Froude was engaged to be married,  and had a passionate love of the country. His keen, clear, rapid  intelligence would probably have served him well in commercial  affairs when once he had learnt to understand them. He was reserved  for a very different destiny, and he gratefully declined Mr.  Darbishire's offer. Nevertheless, his stay at Manchester as private  tutor had some share in his mental development. He made acquaintance  with interesting persons, such as Harriet Martineau, Geraldine  Jewsbury, Mrs. Gaskell, and William Edward Forster, then known as a  young Quaker who had devoted himself, in the true Quaker spirit of  self-sacrifice, to relieving the sufferers from the Irish famine.  Besides Manchester friends, Froude imbibed Manchester principles. He  had been half inclined to sympathise with the socialism of Louis  Blanc and other French revolutionists. Manchester cured him. He  adopted the creed of individualism, private enterprise, no  interference by Government, and free trade. In these matters he did  not, at that time, go with Carlyle, as in ecclesiastical matters he  had not gone with Newman. His mind was intensely practical, though  in personal questions of self-interest he was careless, and even  indifferent. Henceforth he abandoned speculation, as well  philosophical as theological, and reverted to the historical studies  of his youth. Philosophy at Oxford in those days meant Plato,  Aristotle, and Bishop Butler. Froude was a good Greek scholar, and  he had the true Oxford reverence for Butler. But he had not gone  deeper into philosophy than his examinations and his pupils  required. He liked positive results, and metaphysicians always  suggested to him the movements of a squirrel in a cage.    The alternative to business was literature. Biographies of literary  men, said Carlyle, are the most wretched documents in human history,  except the Newgate Calendar. But Carlyle said many things he did not  believe, and this was probably one of them. The truth is, that the  literary profession, like the commercial, requires some little  capital with which to set out, and Froude received this with his  wife. Besides it he had brilliant talents, unflagging industry, and  powers of writing such as have seldom been given to any of the sons  of men. While at Manchester he composed The Cat's Pilgrimage, the  earliest of his Short Studies in date. The moral of this fanciful  fable is very like the moral of Candide.    The discontented cat, tired of her monotonously comfortable place on  the hearthrug, goes out into the world, and gets nothing more than  experience for her pains. She finds the other animals occupied with  their own concerns, and enjoying life because they do not go beyond  them. Not a very elevating paper, perhaps,"]]]
