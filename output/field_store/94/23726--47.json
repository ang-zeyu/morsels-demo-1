Their sacred nature too would  enable us to understand how naturally pipes would be selected as the  medium for totemic representations. It is also known to be a custom  among Indian tribes for individuals to carve out or etch their totems  upon weapons and implements of the more important and highly prized  class, and a variety of ideas, superstitious and other, are associated  with the usage; as, for instance, in the case of weapons of war or  implements of the chase, to impart greater efficiency to them. The  etching would also serve as a mark of ownership, especially where  property of certain kinds was regarded as belonging to the tribe or gens  and not to the individual. Often, indeed, in the latter case the  individual used the totem of his gens instead of the symbol or mark for  his own name.    As a theory to account for the number and character of these animal  carvings the totemic theory is perhaps as tenable as any. The origin and  significance of the carvings may, however, involve many different and  distinct ideas. It is certain that it is a common practice of Indians to  endeavor to perpetuate the image of any strange bird or beast,  especially when seen away from home, and in order that it may be shown  to his friends. As what are deemed the marvellous features of the animal  are almost always greatly exaggerated, it is in this way that many of  the astonishing productions noticeable in savage art have originated.  Among the Esquimaux this habit is very prominent, and many individuals  can show etchings or carvings of birds and animals exhibiting the most  extraordinary characters, which they stoutly aver and doubtless have  come to believe they have actually seen.          ANIMAL MOUNDS.      As having, for the purposes of the present paper, a close connection  with the animal carvings, another class of remains left by the  Mound-Builders--the animal mounds--may next engage attention. As in the  case of the carvings, the resemblance of particular mounds to the  animals whose names they bear is a matter of considerable interest on  account of the theories to which they have given rise.    The conclusion reached with respect to the carvings that it is safe to  rely upon their identification only in the case of animals possessed of  striking and unique characters or presenting unusual forms and  proportions, applies with far greater force to the animal mounds.  Perhaps in none of the latter can specific resemblances be found  sufficient for their precise determination. So general are the  resemblances of one class that it has been an open question among  archaeologists whether they were intended to represent the bodies and  arms of men, or the bodies and wings of birds. Other forms are  sufficiently defined to admit of the statement that they are doubtless  intended for animals, but without enabling so much as a reasonable guess  to be made as to the kind. Of others again it can be asserted that  whatever significance they may have had to the race that built them, to  the uninstructed eyes of modern investigators they are meaningless and  are as likely to have been intended for inanimate as animate objects.    There are many examples among the animal shapes that possess  peculiarities affording no hint of animals living or extinct, but which  are strongly suggestive of the play of mythologic fancy or of  conventional methods of representing totemic ideas. As in the case of  the animal carvings, the latter suggestion is perhaps the one that best  corresponds with their general character.      THE \"ELEPHANT\" MOUND.    By far the most important of the animal mounds, from the nature of the  deductions it has given rise to, is the so-called \"Elephant Mound,\" of  Wisconsin.    By its discovery and description the interesting question was raised as  to the contemporaneousness of the Mound-Builder and the mastodon, an  interest which is likely to be further enhanced by the more recent  bringing to light in Iowa of two pipes carved in the semblance of the  same animal, as well as a tablet showing two figures asserted by some  archaeologists to have been intended for the same animal.    Although both the mound and pipes have been referred in turn to the  peccary, the tapir, and the armadillo, it is safe to exclude these  animals from consideration. It is indeed perhaps more likely that the  ancient inhabitants of the Upper Mississippi Valley were autoptically  acquainted with the mastodon than with either of the above-named  animals, owing to their southern habitat.    Referring to the possibility that the mastodon was known to the  Mound-Builders, it is impossible to fix with any degree of precision the  time of its disappearance from among living animals. Mastodon bones have  been exhumed from peat beds in this country at a depth which, so far as  is proved by the rate of deposition, implies that the animal may have  been alive within five hundred years. The extinction of the mastodon,  geologically speaking, was certainly a very recent event, and, as an  antiquity of upwards of a thousand or more years has been assigned to  some of the mounds, it is entirely within the possibilities that this  animal was living at the time these were thrown up, granting even that  the time of their erection has been overestimated. It must be admitted,  therefore, that there are no inherent absurdities in the belief that the  Mound-Builders were acquainted with the mastodon. Granting that they may  have been acquainted with the animal, the question arises, what proof is  there that they actually were? The answer to this question made by  certain archaeologists is--the Elephant Mound, of Wisconsin.    [Illustration: Fig. 27.--The Elephant Mound, Grant County,  Wisconsin.]    Recalling the fact that among the animal mounds many nondescript shapes  occur which cannot be identified at all, and as many others which have  been called after the animals they appear to most nearly resemble, carry  out their peculiarities only in the most vague and general way, it is a  little difficult to understand the confidence with which this effigy has  been asserted to represent the mastodon; for the mound (a copy of which  as figured in the Smithsonian Annual Report for 1872 is here given) can  by no means be said to closely represent the shape, proportions, and  peculiarities of the animal whose name it bears. In fact, it is true of  this, as of so many other of the effigies, the identity of which must be  guessed, that the resemblance is of the most vague and general kind, the  figure simulating the elephant no more closely than any one of a score  or more mounds in Wisconsin, except in one important particular, viz,  the head has a prolongation or snout-like appendage, which is its chief,  in fact its only real, elephantine character. If this appendage is too  long for the snout of any other known animal, it is certainly too short  for the trunk of a mastodon. Still, so far as this one character goes,  it is doubtless true that it is more suggestive of the mastodon than of  any other animal. No hint is afforded of tusks, ears, or tail, and were  it not for the snout the animal effigy might readily be called a bear,  it nearly resembling in its general make-up many of the so-called bear  mounds figured by Squier and Davis from this same county in Wisconsin.  The latter, too, are of the same gigantic size and proportions.    If it can safely be assumed that an animal effigy without tusks, without  ears, and without a tail was really intended to represent a mastodon, it  would be stretching imagination but a step farther to call all the  large-bodied, heavy-limbed animal effigies hitherto named bears,  mastodons, attributing the lack of trunks, as well as ears, tusks, and  tails, to inattention to slight details on the part of the mound artist.    It is true that one bit of good, positive proof is worth many of a  negative character. But here the one positive resemblance, the trunk of  the supposed elephant, falls far short of an exact imitation, and, as  the other features necessary to a good likeness of a mastodon are wholly  wanting, is not this an instance where the negative proof should be held  sufficient to largely outweigh the positive?    In connection with this question the fact should not be overlooked that,  among the great number of animal effigies in Wisconsin and elsewhere,  this is the only one which even thus remotely suggests the mastodon. As  the Mound Builders were in the habit of repeating the same animal form  again and again, not only in the same but in widely distant localities,  why, if this was really intended for a mastodon, are there no others  like it? It cannot be doubted that the size and extraordinary features  of this monster among mammals would have prevented it being overlooked  by the Mound-Builders when so many animals of inferior interest engaged  their attention. The fact that the mound is a nondescript, with no  others resembling it, certainly lessens the probability that it was an  intentional representation of the mastodon, and increases the likelihood  that its slight resemblance was accidental; a slide of earth from the  head, for instance, might readily be interpreted by the modern artist  as a trunk, and thus the head be made to assume a shape in his sketch  not intended by the original maker. As is well known, no task is more  difficult for the artist than to transfer to paper an exact copy of such  a subject. Especially hard is it for the artist to avoid unconsciously  magnifying or toning down peculiarities according to his own conceptions  of what was originally intended, when, as is often the case, time and  the elements have combined to render shape and outlines obscure.

Then the weighted beam would be laid  across the top, with flat stones under it, fitting down into the  hollow over the olives. The oil, trickling out below, was strained and  stored in jars.      HARD WORK AND BRIGHT HOPES    Most of these different kinds of crops called for an immense amount of  hard work and drudgery. Think of the weariness of the reapers,  swinging their sickles in the wheat or barley all day long under the  hot Syrian sun. Think of the winnowers, tossing the grain into the  wind. Think of the aching backs of the plower and the sower. Of course  there were happy hours, also. It was great fun to ride home behind the  oxen, on a cart packed full and pressed down with golden sheaves. The  time of treading out the grapes was a festival of laughter,  love-making, and song. And in the rainy season, after a year of  plentiful harvests, when the granaries and cellars were well stored,  there must have been many happy days of quiet rest and play in Hebrew  homes.    But most of all, what cheered them on was the hope of better days to  come, when their children at least, or their children's children,  would not have to toil quite so hard or so long each day, and when the  danger of famine and starvation would not loom up quite so grimly as  in the old days in the desert when one summer of drought might mean  death for all. Here in Canaan, they thought, we will surely be happy  by and by.      STUDY TOPICS    1.

No farmer would  have dreamed of building an isolated house for his family on his own  field out of sight of his nearest neighbor as our American farmers do.  The danger from robbers would have been too great. Instead of that,  the Hebrew farmer lived in the nearest village or town. Early in the  morning he went out to his field, and in the evening returned to his  home inside the protecting village walls.    These ancient villages would have seemed to us most unattractive  places. The houses were crowded close together. The streets were only  narrow crooked lanes between the houses. In the rear room of each  house were the stalls of the family ox and ass. The brays of the ass  were the alarm clock in the early morning. There was no drainage.  Garbage was thrown into the street. There were smells of all  varieties. One is not surprised by the frequent stories of pestilences  in the Old-Testament history.    =Compensations of village life.=--It seems strange that people who  were accustomed to life in the open desert should have ever brought  themselves to settle down in these dirty, ill-smelling places. Surely,  at first they must often have been homesick for the clean, pure air of  the plains. On the other hand, probably most of them were willing to  put up with the disagreeable odors and the dirty streets for the sake  of being near other people. The desert was lonesome. In the village  there was always something going on, something to hear and see, gossip  of weddings and courtships and quarrels. Even to-day we find it hard  to persuade those who are accustomed to the city to live in the  country. Even though their city home may be a dark tenement in the  slums, yet they enjoy being in a crowd of their fellow men. The  country seems lonesome.      LESSONS IN HOUSE BUILDING    This village and town life, like the work on the farm, was a new  school for the Hebrew shepherds, and set many an interesting problem  for them to solve. They had to learn to build and repair houses. They  were most often built of rough stones set in mud. The mud, when dry,  became fairly hard, but not like mortar or cement. It was always easy  for a thief \"to dig through and steal,\" as Jesus so graphically  described. Even though no thief came the dried mud was always  crumbling, leaving holes between the stones through which snakes or  lizards could crawl. In such a house, if a man should lean against the  wall, it might easily happen that a serpent would bite him, as the  prophet Amos suggests.[3]    =Primitive Homes.=--The floor of the average poor man's house was  simply the hard ground. The flat roof was made of poles thatched with  straw or brushwood and covered over with mud or clay. There was seldom  more than one room. Often there were no windows; even in the palaces  of kings there were in those days no windows of glass. In one corner  of the room there was a fireplace where the family cooking was done.  There was no chimney, however, and the smoke had to go out through the  open door. The door itself was generally fastened to a post, the  lower end of which turned in a hollow socket in a heavy stone. When  the family went away from home the door was locked with a huge wooden  key, which was carried, not in the pocket, like our keys, but over the  shoulder. Such keys had this advantage, at any rate, over ours. You  could not very well lose them and you did not need a key ring.    =Houses of the well-to-do.=--Rich men's houses were, of course, more  substantially and comfortably built. Real mortar made of lime was used  in the walls. There were several rooms, including perhaps a cool  \"summer house\" on the roof, making a kind of second story. One climbed  up to these upper rooms by a ladder on the outside. The roof was  solidly built and surrounded by a railing, so that on a hot summer  evening the family could sit there and enjoy the cool evening breeze.  There were windows also, covered with wooden lattice work, which let  in light and air.    No doubt every Hebrew father hoped that some day he or his children  might live in such a house. Some of them learned the builder's trade  and were able to lay stones in mortar and to use saws and axes and  nails and other tools for woodwork. Yet when David built his palace,  he had to send to Tyre for skilled masons. Evidently in his day the  Hebrews had not progressed very far in the manual training department  of their new school.      OTHER VILLAGE ARTS AND CRAFTS    Many trades, which with us are carried on in separate shops, were a  part of the household work among the ancient Hebrews: for example,  spinning and weaving and the making of baskets, of shoes, girdles,  and other articles of skin or leather. We will study some of these  household activities in another chapter. Other trades, however, even  in the early days, were carried on by special artisans who worked at  nothing else.    =Trained artisans.=--Metal workers, for example, formed a special  trade. Among the excavations of ancient Canaanite cities have been  found the ruins of a blacksmith shop. When the Hebrews entered Canaan  no one had as yet learned the art of working in iron and steel by  means of a forge with a forced draft. All tools and metal implements,  such as plowshares, knives, axes, saws, and so on, were made of  bronze, which consists of copper mixed and hardened with tin. The  blacksmith melted the metals in a very simple and rough furnace of  clay heated by charcoal. The bronze itself, although harder than  copper, could be worked into the desired shape by hammering and  filing, without the use of heat. We who are used to our sharp, finely  tempered tools of steel would certainly have found these clumsy bronze  affairs most unsatisfactory.    =The pottery shop.=--Another very ancient trade is that of the potter.  This worker did not need much of a shop; only an oven in which to fire  his products, a pile of clay, and a wheel. This consisted of a frame,  in which turned an upright rod on which were two flat wooden wheels,  one small at about the height of the worker's hands as he sat in front  of it, and the other larger, to be turned by the feet. A heap of clay  was placed on the upper wheel, which was then turned by the revolving  rod, the potter's feet all the time kicking on the larger wheel below.  The whirling mass was shaped by the fingers, according to the plan in  the worker's mind.     +-------------------------------------------------------------------+   | [Illustration: MODERN ARAB WOMAN SPINNING]                        |   |                                                                   |   | [Illustration: ANCIENT HEBREW DOOR KEY]                           |   |                                                                   |   | [Illustration: HEBREW NEEDLES OF BONE]                            |   |                                                                   |   | [Illustration: SMALLER KEY]                                       |   |                                                                   |   | Cuts on this page used by permission of the Palestine Exploration |   | Fund.
