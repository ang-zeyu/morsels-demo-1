The  social side of his character may be more rugged and less acceptable, but  as a rule he has had neither the time nor the inclination to fritter  away his manhood in sporting pursuits which do not make for proficiency  in his profession, and he therefore excels in it; in spite of trying  conditions which do not exist in any other calling, for with some  rhetorical exaggeration it may be said that in the lower ranks he is an  abject slave, in the higher an irresponsible despot.]    [Footnote 14: To the various courses, ranging from Balloons to  Economics, which are open to British Officers, might be added a course  in English Grammar and Composition, for the instruction of staff  officers and others who may have to formulate battle orders and despatch  important telegrams on active service. The art of composing a clear,  terse, and unambiguous order or telegraphic message is not studied in  the Army. Not a few telegrams of vital importance in the South African  War were composed by impressionist staff officers who lightly assumed  that what was present in their own minds must necessarily also be  present in the mind of the recipient. The author particularly remembers  a certain telegram from a staff officer of a column, in which it was  impossible to discover from the context whether the word \"they\" in the  concluding paragraph referred to British Columns or to Boer Commandos  previously mentioned.]    [Footnote 15: Major-General Baden-Powell, in _Cavalry Journal_, April.]          CHAPTER II    The Natal Wedge    [Sidenote: Map p. 50]      The northern section of Natal before the war[16] roughly assumed the  shape of a wedge driven in between the Transvaal and the Orange Free  State. The Drakensberg Range on the one side and the Buffalo River on  the other formed the cleaving surfaces, Majuba and Laing's Nek were the  cutting edge, and the base was the Tugela River.    In mechanics a wedge is an instrument which can be usefully employed  only under favourable circumstances. It has many disadvantages. It is  easily jammed. The driving power at the base must be considerable; much  of the force is absorbed by the friction on the surfaces; the progress  made is very slow; and if the surfaces encounter a more tenacious  material they will be perforated. A wedge is intended chiefly for  cleavage and disruption when less clumsy methods are not at hand.    The defects of a wedge as a mechanical power at once became apparent to  the British force which occupied Natal when war became inevitable. The  cutting edge was inaccessible and liable to injury which could not be  easily repaired; much trouble was anticipated from the presence of Boer  commandos in contact with the surfaces; the base did not appear to be  sufficiently well designed to receive the impact of the propelling  force; and there were grave doubts as to the soundness of the material  of which an important section of the wedge, namely Ladysmith, was  constructed.    It was therefore proposed by the military authorities that the Natal  wedge should not be used as an instrument in the war. To this the civil  government at Pietermaritzburg strongly objected on account of the evil  moral effect which the abandonment of a considerable proportion of the  Colony to the enemy would exercise upon the general situation in South  Africa, and of the loss of prestige which the evacuation would entail in  the minds of the natives, who numbered three-quarters of a million.  Under pressure from the Colonial Office, and against its own judgment,  the Army of Natal set itself to work upon the Wedge.    The mistake soon became manifest, although the artisans did their best.  The Wedge was not an effective instrument; its cutting edge was never in  operation; and in a very few weeks it was hewn into a mangled, cumbrous  and irregular mass, which could neither be advanced nor withdrawn and  which for nearly five months led a precarious and unhappy existence. Its  distress necessitated the recasting of the plan of the South African  campaign and a pernicious \"moral effect\" was not avoided. One British  Army besieged in an open town surrounded by heights, while another was  lying impotent upon the banks of the Tugela, eighteen miles distant, was  the result of a few weeks' work with the Natal Wedge, which had been  forced by the civilian strategists into the reluctant hands of the  troops.[17]    When Sir George White arrived in Natal on October 7 he found Sir W. Tenn  Symons carrying out the wedge policy of the Colonial Government. Part of  the latter's force was at Ladysmith and part was protecting the  collieries in the Dundee district. It was his intention to advance  northwards to Newcastle as soon as he was reinforced by the contingent  on its way from India, the full strength of which had not arrived at  Durban. The position at Dundee was strategically defective, as it was  exposed to a raid from the Transvaal border only twelve miles distant,  and it was actually further from the Orange Free State than Ladysmith.  Its defects as a tactical position were still more obvious as it was  commanded by hills.    Such, in a few words, was the situation with which White was called upon  to deal. He had two courses before turn; he could accommodate himself to  it or he could endeavour to modify it. He attempted the latter, and  failing he recurred to the former. He saw at once the insecurity of  Symons' detached force, but being unable to convince the Natal  Government of the necessity of withdrawing it he reluctantly allowed it  to remain.    Soon the Boer plan of campaign, which aimed at the isolation of the  British Troops in the wedge, began to unroll itself. Fourteen thousand  Transvaalers under Joubert, who had first tested the cutting edge by  sending a coal truck through the tunnel at Laing's Nek and who suspected  an ambush when he found it clear, were moving south on Newcastle, while  six thousand Free Staters under Martin Prinsloo were pouring through the  Drakensberg passes west of Ladysmith. The Natal Government now began to  feel uneasy about the safety of the colonial capital and even of Durban;  and informed White that undue importance had been attached to the  occupation of Dundee and that its retention was no longer desirable.  Thus in little more than a week White's original objection was  reconsidered and upheld. But again he allowed his better judgment to be  over-borne. Symons, whom he instructed to withdraw southwards unless he  felt his position to be absolutely secure, was at his own urgent request  allowed to remain. Next day, October 19, Elandslaagte, on the railway  between Ladysmith and Dundee, was occupied by a Boer commando, and it  was reported that 4,000 burghers were ready to cross the Buffalo River  at Jager's Drift during the night.    Symons' camp was pitched about a mile west of Dundee which lay between  it and Talana and Lennox Hills, which commanded the town from the east.  Some hours before sunrise on October 20 a British picket on Talana was  attacked. The incident was reported to Head Quarters, where it was not  deemed to be of much importance and the routine duties of the morning  were not interrupted. The artillery horses had been taken down as usual  to water, and some companies had even fallen in for skirmishing drill,  when the curtain of the morning mist upon the higher ground was raised  to the first scene in the Natal drama. The eastward hills, looming up  darkly into the brightening sky, were seen to be occupied in force by  the enemy under L. Meyer, and soon his shells were falling among the  tents.    The troops in camp, though taken by surprise, pulled themselves together  with admirable promptitude. The Boer guns were soon silenced, the  figures of men silhouetted along the sky line vanished, and the infantry  was ordered out to clear the hill. It was a formidable and dangerous  task, but it was facilitated by some of the features of the ground.  There was a dry river bed in which the troops could be formed up for  attack, and, half a mile beyond, a farmhouse and a plantation afforded  some cover; while a donga on the left at right angles to the river bed  apparently offered a covered way up the hill to the crest. In the  plantation occurred the first calamity of the war. Symons, who had come  up impatiently from the lower ground to hurry up the assault, which he  thought was being unnecessarily delayed, was mortally wounded. Three  days later he paid with his life for his adherence to a forward policy  in tactics as well as in strategy; and the command devolved upon Yule.    The donga on the left was found to be useless, as it led nowhere; and  the advance was made directly from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/157"],[0,"Daddy-Long-Legs (#8)"],[1,"and a lot of wooded hills, and way in the distance a tall blue  mountain that simply melts in your mouth.    We churn twice a week; and we keep the cream in the spring house which  is made of stone with the brook running underneath.  Some of the  farmers around here have a separator, but we don't care for these  new-fashioned ideas.  It may be a little harder to separate the cream  in pans, but it's sufficiently better to pay.  We have six calves; and  I've chosen the names for all of them.    1.  Sylvia, because she was born in the woods.    2.  Lesbia, after the Lesbia in Catullus.    3.  Sallie.    4.

I started to write to you yesterday afternoon, but as  far as I got was the heading, 'Dear Daddy-Long-Legs', and then I  remembered I'd promised to pick some blackberries for supper, so I went  off and left the sheet lying on the table, and when I came back today,  what do you think I found sitting in the middle of the page?  A real  true Daddy-Long-Legs!    I picked him up very gently by one leg, and dropped him out of the  window.  I wouldn't hurt one of them for the world.  They always remind  me of you.    We hitched up the spring wagon this morning and drove to the Centre to  church.  It's a sweet little white frame church with a spire and three  Doric columns in front (or maybe Ionic--I always get them mixed).    A nice sleepy sermon with everybody drowsily waving palm-leaf fans, and  the only sound, aside from the minister, the buzzing of locusts in the  trees outside.  I didn't wake up till I found myself on my feet singing  the hymn, and then I was awfully sorry I hadn't listened to the sermon;  I should like to know more of the psychology of a man who would pick  out such a hymn.  This was it:               Come, leave your sports and earthly toys             And join me in celestial joys.             Or else, dear friend, a long farewell.             I leave you now to sink to hell.      I find that it isn't safe to discuss religion with the Semples.  Their  God (whom they have inherited intact from their remote Puritan  ancestors) is a narrow, irrational, unjust, mean, revengeful, bigoted  Person.  Thank heaven I don't inherit God from anybody!  I am free to  make mine up as I wish Him.  He's kind and sympathetic and imaginative  and forgiving and understanding--and He has a sense of humour.    I like the Semples immensely; their practice is so superior to their  theory.  They are better than their own God.  I told them so--and they  are horribly troubled.  They think I am blasphemous--and I think they  are!  We've dropped theology from our conversation.    This is Sunday afternoon.    Amasai (hired man) in a purple tie and some bright yellow buckskin  gloves, very red and shaved, has just driven off with Carrie (hired  girl) in a big hat trimmed with red roses and a blue muslin dress and  her hair curled as tight as it will curl.  Amasai spent all the morning  washing the buggy; and Carrie stayed home from church ostensibly to  cook the dinner, but really to iron the muslin dress.    In two minutes more when this letter is finished I am going to settle  down to a book which I found in the attic.  It's entitled, On the  Trail, and sprawled across the front page in a funny little-boy hand:                   Jervis Pendleton                 if this book should ever roam,                 Box its ears and send it home.      He spent the summer here once after he had been ill, when he was about  eleven years old; and he left On the Trail behind.  It looks well  read--the marks of his grimy little hands are frequent!  Also in a  corner of the attic there is a water wheel and a windmill and some bows  and arrows.  Mrs. Semple talks so constantly about him that I begin to  believe he really lives--not a grown man with a silk hat and walking  stick, but a nice, dirty, tousle-headed boy who clatters up the stairs  with an awful racket, and leaves the screen doors open, and is always  asking for cookies.  (And getting them, too, if I know Mrs. Semple!) He  seems to have been an adventurous little soul--and brave and truthful.  I'm sorry to think he is a Pendleton; he was meant for something better.    We're going to begin threshing oats tomorrow; a steam engine is coming  and three extra men.    It grieves me to tell you that Buttercup (the spotted cow with one  horn, Mother of Lesbia) has done a disgraceful thing.  She got into the  orchard Friday evening and ate apples under the trees, and ate and ate  until they went to her head.  For two days she has been perfectly dead  drunk!  That is the truth I am telling.  Did you ever hear anything so  scandalous?

Indians in the first chapter and highwaymen in the second.  I hold  my breath.  What can the third contain?  'Red Hawk leapt twenty feet in  the air and bit the dust.'  That is the subject of the frontispiece.  Aren't Judy and Jervie having fun?                                                         15th September    Dear Daddy,    I was weighed yesterday on the flour scales in the general store at the  Comers.  I've gained nine pounds!  Let me recommend Lock Willow as a  health resort.                                   Yours ever,                                                 Judy          Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    Behold me--a Sophomore!  I came up last Friday, sorry to leave Lock  Willow, but glad to see the campus again.  It is a pleasant sensation  to come back to something familiar.  I am beginning to feel at home in  college, and in command of the situation; I am beginning, in fact, to  feel at home in the world--as though I really belonged to it and had  not just crept in on sufferance.    I don't suppose you understand in the least what I am trying to say.  A  person important enough to be a Trustee can't appreciate the feelings  of a person unimportant enough to be a foundling.    And now, Daddy, listen to this.  Whom do you think I am rooming with?  Sallie McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton.  It's the truth.  We have  a study and three little bedrooms--VOILA!    Sallie and I decided last spring that we should like to room together,  and Julia made up her mind to stay with Sallie--why, I can't imagine,  for they are not a bit alike; but the Pendletons are naturally  conservative and inimical (fine word!) to change.  Anyway, here we are.  Think of Jerusha Abbott, late of the John Grier Home for Orphans,  rooming with a Pendleton.  This is a democratic country.    Sallie is running for class president, and unless all signs fail, she  is going to be elected.  Such an atmosphere of intrigue you should see  what politicians we are!  Oh, I tell you, Daddy, when we women get our  rights, you men will have to look alive in order to keep yours.  Election comes next Saturday, and we're going to have a torchlight  procession in the evening, no matter who wins.    I am beginning chemistry, a most unusual study.  I've never seen  anything like it before.  Molecules and Atoms are the material  employed, but I'll be in a position to discuss them more definitely  next month.    I am also taking argumentation and logic.    Also history of the whole world.    Also plays of William Shakespeare.    Also French.    If this keeps up many years longer, I shall become quite intelligent.    I should rather have elected economics than French, but I didn't dare,  because I was afraid that unless I re-elected French, the Professor  would not let me pass--as it was, I just managed to squeeze through the  June examination.  But I will say that my high-school preparation was  not very adequate.    There's one girl in the class who chatters away in French as fast as  she does in English.  She went abroad with her parents when she was a  child, and spent three years in a convent school.  You can imagine how  bright she is compared with the rest of us--irregular verbs are mere  playthings.  I wish my parents had chucked me into a French convent  when I was little instead of a foundling asylum.  Oh no, I don't  either!  Because then maybe I should never have known you.  I'd rather  know you than French.    Goodbye, Daddy.  I must call on Harriet Martin now, and, having  discussed the chemical situation, casually drop a few thoughts on the  subject of our next president.                           Yours in politics,                                             J. Abbott                                                         17th October    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    Supposing the swimming tank in the gymnasium were filled full of lemon  jelly, could a person trying to swim manage to keep on top or would he  sink?    We were having lemon jelly for dessert when the question came up.  We  discussed it heatedly for half an hour and it's still unsettled.  Sallie thinks that she could swim in it, but I am perfectly sure that  the best swimmer in the world would sink.  Wouldn't it be funny to be  drowned in lemon jelly?    Two other problems are"]]]
