Choice Secrets made known.      _To make true Magistery of Pearl._    Dissolve two or three ounces of fine seed Pearl in distilled Vinegar, &  when it is perfectly dissolved, and all taken up, pour the Vinegar into  a clean glass Bason; then drop some few drops of Oyl of Tartar upon it,  & it will cast down the Pearl into fine Powder, then pour the Vinegar  clean off softly, then put to the Pearl clear Conduit or Spring water;  pour that off, and do so often untill the taste of the Vinegar and  Tartar be clean gone, then dry the powder of Pearl upon warm embers, and  keep it for your use.        _How to make Hair grow._    Take half a pound of Aqua Mellis in the Spring time of the year, warm a  little of it every Morning when you rise in a Sawcer, and tie a little  spunge to a fine box comb, and dip it in the water, and therewith  moisten the roots of the Hair in combing it, and it will grow long,  thick, and curled in a very short time.        _To write Letters of Secret, that they cannot be read without the  directions following._    Take fine Allum, beat it small, and put a reasonable quantity of it into  water, then write with the said water.    The work cannot be read, but by steeping your paper in fair running  water.    You may likewise write with Vinegar, or the juyce of Lemon or Onion; if  you would read the same, you must hold it before the fire.        _How to keep Wine from Sowring._    Tye a piece of very salt Bacon on the inside of your barrel, so as it  touch not the Wine, which will preserve Wine from sowring.        _To take out Spots of Grease or Oyl._    Take bones of sheeps feet, burn them almost to ashes, then bruise them  to powder, and put of it on the spot, and lay it in the sun when it  shineth hottest, when the powder becomes black, lay on fresh in the  place till it fetch out the spots, which will be done in a very short  time.        _To make hair grow black, though any colour._    Take a little Aqua Fortis, put therein a groat or sixpence, as to the  quantity of the aforesaid water, then set both to dissolve before the  fire, then dip a small spunge in the said water, and wet your beard or  hair therewith; but touch not the skin.        _King_ Edwards _perfume._    Take twelve spoonfuls of right red Rose-water, the weight of six pence  in fine powder of Sugar, and boil it on hot Embers and Coles softly, and  the house will smell as though it were full of Roses; but you must burn  the sweet Cypress wood before, to take away the gross air.        _Queen_ Elizabeths _Perfume._    Take eight spoonfuls of Compound water, the weight of two pence in fine  powder of Sugar, and boil it on hot Embers and Coals, softly, and half  an ounce of sweet Marjoram dried in the Sun, the weight of two pence of  the powder of Benjamin. This Perfume is very sweet, and good for the  time.        _Mr._ Ferene _of the_ New Exchange, _Perfumer to the Queen, his rare  Dentifrice, so much approved of at Court._    First take eight ounces of Ireos roots, also four ounces of Pomistone,  and eight ounces of Cutle-bone, also eight ounces of Corral, and a pound  of Brick if you desire to make them red; but he did oftener make them  white, and then instead of the Brick did take a pound of fine Alabaster;  all this being throughly beaten, and sifted through a fine searse, the  powder is then ready prepared to make up in a paste, which must be done  as follows.        _To make the said Powder into Paste._    Take a little Gum Dragant, and lay it in steep twelve hours, in Orange  flower water, or Damask Rose-water, and when it is dissolved, take the  sweet Gum, and grind it on a Marble stone with the aforesaid powder, and  mixing some crums of white bread, it will come into a Paste, the which  you may make Dentifrices, of what shape or fashion you please, but rolls  is the most commodious for your use.        _The Receipt of the Lady_ Kents _powder, presented by her Ladyship to  the Queen._    Take white Amber, Crabs eyes, red Corral, Harts-horn and Pearl, all  prepared several, of each a like proportion, tear and mingle them, then  take Harts-horn gelly, that hath some Saffron put into a bag, dissolve  into it while the gelly is warm, then let the gelly cool, and therewith  make a paste of the powders, which being made up into little balls, you  must dry gently by the fire side. Pearl is prepared by dissolving it  with the juyce of Lemons, Amber prepared by beating it to powder; so  also Crabs-eyes and Coral, Harts-horn prepared by burning it in the  fire, and taking the shires of it especially, the pith wholly rejected.        _A Cordial Water of Sir_ Walter Raleigh.    Take a gallon of Strawberries, and put them into a pint of _Aqua vitae_,  let them stand for four or five days, strain them gently out, and  sweeten the water as you please with fine Sugar; or else with perfume.        _The Lady_ Malets _Cordial Water._    Take a pound of fine Sugar beaten and put to it a quart of running  water, pour it three or four times through a bag; then put a pint of  Damask Rose-water, which you must always pour still through the bag,  then four penniworth of Angelica water, four pence in Clove-water, four  pence of Rosa Solis, one pint of Cinnamon-water, or three pints and a  half _Aqua vitae_, as you find it in taste; put all these together three  or four times through the bag or strainer, and then take half an ounce  of good Muskallis and cut them grosly, & put them into a glass, and fill  them with the water, &c.           *       *       *       *       *    _A Sovereign Water of Dr._ Stephens, _which he long times used,  wherewith he did many Cures; he kept secretly till a little before his  death, and then he gave it to the Lord Arch-bishop of_ Canterbury _in  writing, being as followeth_, viz.           *       *       *       *       *    Take a Gallon of good Gascoine Wine, and take Ginger, Gallingale,  Cinamon, Nutmegs, Cloves, Grains, Anniseeds, Fennil-seed, of every of  them a dram, then take Caraway-seed, of red Mints, Roses, Thime,  Pellitory of the Wall, Rosemary, wild Thime, Camomil, the leaves if you  cannot get the flowers, of small Lavander, of each a handful, then bray  the Spices small, and bray the Herbs, and put all into the Wine, and let  it stand for twelve hours, stirring divers times, then still it in a  Limbeck, and keep the first water, for it is best, then put the second  water by it self, for it is good, but not of such vertues, &c.      _The Vertues of this water._    It comforts the Spirits Vital, and helps all inward Diseases that come  of cold, it is good against the shaking of the Palsie; it cures the  contraction of the Sinews, helps the conception of Women if they be  Barren, it kills the Worms in the Belly and Stomach; it cures the cold  Dropsie, and helps the Stone in the Bladder, and in the Reins of the  back;

with this water did Dr. _Stephens_ preserve his life, till  extream age would not let him go or stand and he continued five years,  when all the Physicians judged he would not live a year longer, nor did  he use any other Medicine but this, &c.        _A Plague Water to be taken one spoonful every four hours with one sweat  every time._    Take Scabious; Betony, Pimpernel, and Turmentine-roots, of each a pound,  steep these all night in three gallons of strong Beer, and distil them  all in a Limbeck, and when you use it, take a spoonful thereof every  four hours, and sweat well after it, draw two quarts of water, if your  Beer be strong, and mingle them both together.        _Poppy water._    Take four pound of the flower of Poppies well pickt and sifted, steep  them all night in three Gallons of Ale that is strong, and still it in a  Limbeck;

What she said to her I did not hear, for the  brief words were uttered in a low voice; but I noticed, as she spoke, one  small, fair hand rested on the woman's hand.    17. Was there magic in that touch? The woman's repulsive aspect changed  into one of kindly welcome, and she said, \"Yes, it's a long way to G--. I  guess we can find a place for him.\"    18. Many times more during that evening, did I observe the magic power of  that hand and voice--the one gentle yet potent as the other. On the next  morning, breakfast being over, I was preparing to take my departure when  my host informed me that if I would wait for half an hour he would give me  a ride in his wagon to G--, as business required him to go there. I was  very well pleased to accept of the invitation.    19. In due time, the farmer's wagon was driven into the road before the  house, and I was invited to get in. I noticed the horse as a rough-looking  Canadian pony, with a certain air of stubborn endurance. As the farmer  took his seat by my side, the family came to the door to see us off.    20. \"Dick!\" said the farmer in a peremptory voice, giving the rein a quick  jerk as he spoke. But Dick moved not a step. \"Dick! you vagabond! get up.\"  And the farmer's whip cracked sharply by the pony's ear.    21. It availed not, however, this second appeal. Dick stood firmly  disobedient. Next the whip was brought down upon him with an impatient  hand; but the pony only reared up a little. Fast and sharp the strokes  were next dealt to the number of half a dozen. The man might as well have  beaten the wagon, for all his end was gained.    22. A stout lad now came out into the road, and, catching Dick by the  bridle, jerked him forward, using, at the same time, the customary  language on such occasions, but Dick met this new ally with increased  stubbornness, planting his fore feet more firmly and at a sharper angle  with the ground.    23. The impatient boy now struck the pony on the side of the head with his  clinched hand, and jerked cruelly at his bridle. It availed nothing,  however; Dick was not to be wrought upon by any such arguments.    24. \"Don't do so, John!\" I turned my head as the maiden's sweet voice  reached my ear. She was passing through the gate into the road, and in the  next moment had taken hold of the lad and drawn him away from the animal.  No strength was exerted in this; she took hold of his arm, and he obeyed  her wish as readily as if he had no thought beyond her gratification.    25. And now that soft hand was laid gently on the pony's neck, and a  single low word spoken. How instantly were the tense muscles relaxed--how  quickly the stubborn air vanished!    26. \"Poor Dick!\" said the maiden, as she stroked his neck lightly, or  softly patted it with a childlike hand. \"Now, go along, you provoking  fellow!\" she added, in a half-chiding, yet affectionate voice, as she drew  up the bridle.    27. The pony turned toward her, and rubbed his head against her arm for an  instant or two; then, pricking up his ears, he started off at a light,  cheerful trot, and went on his way as freely as if no silly crotchet had  ever entered his stubborn brain.    28. \"What a wonderful power that hand possesses!\" said I, speaking to my  companion, as we rode away.    29. He looked at me for a moment, as if my remark had occasioned surprise.  Then a light came into his countenance, and he said briefly, \"She's good!  Everybody and everything loves her.\"    30. Was that, indeed, the secret of her power? Was the quality of her soul  perceived in the impression of her hand, even by brute beasts! The  father's explanation was doubtless the true one. Yet have I ever since  wondered, and still do wonder, at the potency which lay in that maiden's  magic touch. I have seen something of the same power, showing itself in  the loving and the good, but never to the extent as instanced in her,  whom, for want of a better name, I must still call \"Gentle Hand.\"      DEFINITIONS.--2.

Eastman (b. 1816, d.1861) was born in Maine, but removed at an  early age to Vermont, where he was connected with the press at Burlington,  Woodstock, and Montpelier. He published a volume of poems in 1848, written  in a happy lyric and ballad style, and faithfully portraying rural life in  New England.    1. The farmer sat in his easy-chair       Smoking his pipe of clay,     While his hale old wife with busy care,       Was clearing the dinner away;     A sweet little girl with fine blue eyes,     On her grandfather's knee, was catching flies.    2. The old man laid his hand on her head,       With a tear on his wrinkled face,     He thought how often her mother, dead,       Had sat in the selfsame place;     As the tear stole down from his half-shut eye,     \"Don't smoke!\" said the child, \"how it makes you cry!\"    3. The house dog lay stretched out on the floor,       Where the shade, afternoons, used to steal;     The busy old wife by the open door       Was turning the spinning wheel,     And the old brass clock on the manteltree     Had plodded along to almost three.    4. Still the farmer sat in his easy-chair,       While close to his heaving breast     The moistened brow and the cheek so fair       Of his sweet grandchild were pressed;     His head bent down, all her soft hair lay;     Fast asleep were they both on that summer day.    DEFINITIONS.--1. Hale, healthy. 3. Man'tel-tree, shelf over a fireplace.  Plod'ded, went slowly. 4. Heaving, rising and falling.        V. A BOY ON A FARM.    Charles Dudley Warner (b. 1829,--) was born at Plainfield, Mass. In 1851  he graduated at Hamilton College, and in 1856 was admitted to the bar at  Philadelphia, but moved to Chicago to practice his profession. There he  remained until 1860, when he became connected with the press at Hartford,  Conn., and has ever since devoted himself to literature. \"My Summer in a  Garden,\" \"Saunterings,\" and \"Backlog Studies\" are his best known works.  The following extract is from \"Being a Boy.\"    1. Say what you will about the general usefulness of boys, it is my  impression that a farm without a boy would very soon come to grief. What  the boy does is the life of the farm. He is the factotum, always in  demand, always expected to do the thousand indispensable things that  nobody else will do. Upon him fall all the odds and ends, the most  difficult things.    2. After everybody else is through, he has to finish up. His work is like  a woman's,--perpetually waiting on others. Everybody knows how much easier  it is to eat a good dinner than it is to wash the dishes afterwards.  Consider what a boy on a farm is required to do,--things that must be  done, or life would actually stop.    3. It is understood, in the first place, that he is to do all the errands,  to go to the store, to the post office, and to carry all sorts of  messages. If he had as many legs as a centiped, they would tire before  night. His two short limbs seem to him entirely inadequate to the task. He  would like to have as many legs as a wheel has spokes, and rotate about in  the same way.    4. This he sometimes tries to do; and the people who have seen him  \"turning cart wheels\" along the side of the road, have supposed that he  was amusing himself and idling his time; he was only trying to invent a  new mode of locomotion, so that he could economize his legs, and do his  errands with greater dispatch.    5. He practices standing on his head, in order to accustom himself to any  position. Leapfrog is one of his methods of getting over the ground  quickly. He would willingly go an errand any distance if he could leapfrog  it with a few other boys.    6. He has a natural genius for combining pleasure with business. This is  the reason why, when he is sent to the spring for a pitcher of water, he  is absent so long; for he stops to poke the frog that sits on the stone,  or, if there is a penstock, to put his hand over the spout, and squirt the  water a little while.    7. He is the one who spreads the grass when the men have cut it; he mows  it away in the barn; he rides the horse, to cultivate the corn, up and  down the hot, weary rows; he picks up the potatoes when they are dug; he  drives the cows night and morning; he brings wood and water, and splits  kindling; he gets up the horse, and puts out the horse; whether he is in  the house or out of it, there is always something for him to do.    8. Just before the school in winter he shovels paths; in summer he turns  the grindstone. He knows where there are lots of wintergreens and sweet  flags, but instead of going for them, he is to stay indoors and pare  apples, and stone raisins, and pound something in a mortar. And yet, with  his mind full of schemes of what he would like to do, and his hands full  of occupations, he is an idle boy, who has nothing to busy himself with  but school and chores!    9. He would gladly do all the work if somebody else would do the chores,  he thinks; and yet I doubt if any boy ever amounted to anything in the  world, or was of much use as a man, who did not enjoy the advantages of a  liberal education in the way of chores.      DEFINITIONS.--1. Fac-to'tum, a person employed to do all kinds of work.  In-dis-pen'sa-ble, absolutely necessary. 2. Per-pet'u-al-ly, continually.  3. Cen'ti-ped, an insect with a great number of feet. 4. E-con'o-mize, to  save. Dis-p"]]]
