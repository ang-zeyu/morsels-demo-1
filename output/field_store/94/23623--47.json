As they passed under  the Crow two beautiful feathers fell behind them and lay on the grass  shining in the sunlight with a hundred colors.    \"Once more the cast-off plumage of the Peacock family is left for me!\"  croaked the Crow to himself. \"Am I only to be made beautiful by  borrowing from others? Perhaps I might collect feathers enough from all  the birds to conceal my inky coat. Aha! I have it.\" And this was the  plan of the Crow. He would steal from every dweller in Birdland a  feather, and see whether he could not make himself more beautiful than  the Peacock's cousin himself.    Now the Crow was a skilful thief. He could steal the silver off the  King's table from under the steward's very nose. He could steal a maid's  thimble from her finger as she nodded sleepily over her work. He could  steal the pen from behind a scribe's ear, as he paused to scratch his  head and think over the spelling of a word. So the Crow felt sure that  he could steal their feathers from the birds without any trouble.    When the Peacock and his cousin had passed by, the Crow swooped down and  carried off the two feathers which were to begin his collection. He hid  them in his treasure-house in the hollow tree, and started out for more.    It was great fun for the Crow, and he almost forgot to be miserable. He  followed old lady Ostrich about for some time before he dared tweak a  handful of feathers from her tail. But finally he succeeded; and though  she squawked horribly and turned, quick as a flash, she was not quick  enough to catch the nimble thief, who was already hidden under a bush.  In the same way he secured some lovely plumes from the Bird of  Paradise, the Parrot, and the Cock. He robbed the Redbreast of his ruddy  vest, the Hoopoe of his crown, and he secured a swallow-tail which he  had long coveted. He took some rosy-redness from the Flamingo, the  gilding of the Goldfinch, the gray down of an Eider-Duck. He burgled the  Bluebird and the Redbird and the Yellowbird; and not one single  feathered creature escaped his clever beak. At last his hole in the tree  was brimming with feathers of every color, length, and degree of  softness, a gorgeous feather-bed on which it would dazzle one to sleep.    Then the Crow set to work to make himself a coat of many colors, like  Joseph's. He was a very clever bird, and a wondrous coat it turned out  to be. It had no particular cut nor style; it was not like the coat  which any bird had ever before worn. The feathers were placed in any  fashion that happened to please his original fancy. Some pointed up and  some down; some were straight and some were curled; some drooped about  his feet and others curved gracefully over his head; some trailed far  behind. He was completely covered from top to toe, so that not one blot  of his own inky feathers showed through the gorgeousness. A red vest he  wore, and a swallow-tail, of course, and there was a crown of feathers  on his head. Never was there seen a more extraordinary bird nor one more  gaudy. Perhaps he was not in the best of taste, but at least he was  striking.    When all was finished the Crow went and looked at himself in the  fountain mirror; and he was much pleased.    \"Well now!\" he cried. \"How am I for a bird? I believe no one will know  me, and that is just as well; for now I am so fine that I shall myself  refuse to know any one. Ho! This ought to give some ideas to that  conceited Peacock family! I am a self-made man. I am an artist who knows  how to adapt his materials. I am a genius. King Solomon himself will  wonder at my glory. And as for the Eagle, King of the Birds, he will  grow pale with envy. King of the Birds, indeed! It is now I who should  rightfully be King. No other ever wore clothes so fine as mine. By right  of them I ought to be King of the Birds. I _will_ be King of the Birds!\"    You see the poor old Crow was quite crazy with his one idea.    Forth he stalked into Birdland to show his gorgeous plumage and to get  himself elected King of the Birds. The first persons he met were the  Peacock and his cousin,--he who was once the Crow's best friend. The  Crow ruffled himself his prettiest when he saw them coming.    \"Good gracious! Who is that extraordinary fowl?\" drawled the Peacock.  \"He must be some great noble from a far country.\"    \"How beautiful!\" murmured his silly cousin. \"How odd! How fascinating!  How distinguished! I wish the Crow had painted me like that!\" The Crow  heard these words and swelled with pride, casting a scornful glance at  his old friend as he swept by.    Next he met a little Sparrow who was picking bugs from the grass. \"Out  of my way, Birdling!\" cried the Crow haughtily. \"I am the King.\"    \"The King!\" gasped the Sparrow, nearly choking over a fat bug, he was so  surprised. \"I did not know that the King wore such a robe. How  gorgeous--but how queer!\"    Next the Crow met Mr. Stork, standing gravely on one leg and thinking of  the little baby which he was going to bring that night to the cottage by  the lake. The Stork looked up in surprise as the wonderful stranger  approached.    \"Bless me!\" he exclaimed, \"whom have we here? I thought I knew all  Birdland, but I never before saw such a freak as this!\"    [Illustration: _\"Bless me!\" he exclaimed, \"whom have we here?\"_]    \"I am the King. I am to be the new King,\" announced the Crow. \"Is  there any bird more gorgeous than I?\"    \"Truly, I hope not,\" said the Stork gravely. \"Yet the Woodcock is a very  foolish bird. One never knows what he will do next. If he should try to  be fashionable\"--    But the Crow had passed on without listening to the Stork's sarcasm.    As he went through Birdland he drew behind him a following of feathered  citizens, chattering, screaming, tittering all together like the crowd  after a circus procession. All the birds, big and little, plain and  pretty, flocked to see this wonderful stranger who because of his fine  clothes was coming to have himself named King. Some of them thought him  truly beautiful, some thought him ridiculous; some envied him, some  jeered. But they all stared; and the more they stared the more conceited  became the Crow, the more sure that the kingdom was to be his.    At last they came into the presence of the Eagle himself. That royal  bird was perched upon his eyrie far up on the cliff. Below him gathered  the dense flock of birds, waiting to see what would happen when the Crow  demanded to be made King in the Eagle's place. The Eagle had been warned  of the matter by the little Humming-Bird, and was looking very majestic  and scornful. But the Swallow flew round and round in great circles,  twittering excitedly, and in each circle sweeping nearer and nearer to  the ground. The Swallow was angry because some one had stolen his  beautiful swallow-tail.    Presently the Crow swaggered forth, and cocking his impertinent eye  towards the Eagle he croaked,--    \"Hello there, Old High-perch! Give me your crown and sceptre, for I am  King of the Birds, not you. Look at my gorgeous clothes; look at your  own dull plumage. Am I not kingly?--look at me.\"    The King made no reply, merely gazing sternly at the Crow. But the  Swallow took up the word.    \"Look at him, look at him indeed, O King!\" he screamed. \"There is  something strange about his kingly plumage. That swallow-tail is mine, I  know it!\" And with a vicious tweak the Swallow pulled out the long  forked feathers of which the Crow was especially proud. Oh, what a  shriek of rage the mad old bird gave! At that moment the Hoopoe came up  and said, \"Ha! Methinks I too recognize my property. This is my crown,\"  and forthwith he snatched the plumes from the Crow's forehead, leaving  it quite ugly and bare. Next the gentle Redbreast claimed his vest, and  the Bluebird her azure feathers, and the Ostrich her train which she had  sorely missed. Each of the birds in turn came up and with much  chattering and scolding twitched away the property of which he or she  had been robbed, until the Crow stood before them in his customary suit  of solemn black, a bird ashamed and sore. For they had pecked him with  their bills and beaten him with their wings and scratched him with their  claws until even his own plain old coat was frayed and rent.    \"Oh ho, oh ho! It is only old Daddy Crow, after all!\" screamed the birds  in chorus. And then, because the Eagle burst out laughing, they saw that  it was really funny. Since the King did not mind being robbed for a time  of his title, surely they need not mourn over the few feathers which the  thief had borrowed, especially since each now had his own. Chattering  with glee they all flew home to their various nests, leaving the Crow  alone with his shame and soreness.    Just at this moment the Peacock and his cousin came hurrying up out of  breath.    \"Oh, what is it? What is the matter? What was all that noise just now?\"  asked the Peacock.    \"Oh, what has become of the beautiful, noble, splendid, remarkable,  graceful, gorgeous, stylish, long-tailed, kingly stranger?\" questioned  the Peacock's cousin, speaking affably to the Crow, for the first time  since his adoption into high society.    The Crow looked at him sideways, and all his madness went away as he saw  how very, very silly this creature was.    \"He was a fool in fools' feathers,\" he croaked. \"He is no more. But  before the end he bade me return these to you, saying, 'Fine feathers do  not make fine birds.'\" Speaking thus, he presented to the pair their two  long feathers with which he had started his collection and which were  the only ones now remaining to the masquerading Crow.    Then with a harsh _Caw_! he flew away to his tree. He is not a happy  bird, but since that time he has never been so mad as to think that  clothes are the chief thing in the world.          KING SOLOMON AND THE BIRDS      King Solomon was wiser than all men, and his fame was in all nations  round about Jerusalem."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16145"],[0,"Journals of Two Expeditions of Discovery in North-West and Western Australia, (#8)"],[1,"seven miles of a circuitous course and found ourselves at the  foot of the high-peaked hill seen this morning, named by me Water Peak. I  still hurried along the native path, and was so wrapped up in the  thoughts of our present position that I passed, without seeing it, a  beautiful spring that rose to within a few inches of the surface. Near  this the natives had built a small hut, covered with boughs, concealed in  which they might kill the birds and animals which came to drink at this  lone water; the keen eye of Coles in a moment detected the little pool,  and our thirst was soon assuaged.    For a few minutes we lay on the bank of this clear spring, resting our  wearied limbs and admiring the scenery around us. There is a something in  the wild luxuriance of a totally new and uncultivated country which words  cannot convey to the inhabitant of an old and civilized land, the rich  and graceful forms of the trees, the massy moss-grown trunks which cumber  the soil, the tree half uptorn by some furious gale and still remaining  in the falling posture in which the winds have left it, the drooping  disorder of dead and dying branches, the mingling of rich grasses and  useless weeds, all declare that here man knows not the luxuries the soil  can yield him: it was over such a scene, rendered still more lovely by  the falling shadows of night, that our eyes now wandered.    BENIGHTED IN RETURNING TO THE PARTY.    I roused the men again and we commenced our return to the party, loaded  with a supply of water. It was now dark and we soon wandered from the  path. Kaiber took a star for his guide and led us straight across the  country; but our route lay through a warran ground, full of holes, and in  the darkness of the night we every now and then had a tremendous tumble,  so that at the end of about four miles I thought that it would be  imprudent to proceed farther, as we every moment were in danger of  breaking a limb or seriously injuring ourselves. I therefore halted for  the night, and as we were unable to light a fire both on account of the  heavy dew and of having no proper materials with us, the first portion of  it passed wretchedly enough, indeed, weary as I was, I found it necessary  to walk about in order to preserve some slight degree of warmth in my  frame.    At length however the men, who were much too cold to sleep, got up and,  renewing their efforts, succeeded in kindling a blaze. Kaiber soon  collected plenty of wood, and as I was unable to sleep I passed the night  in meditating on our present state.    POSITION AND PROSPECTS.    I felt sure that if the men persisted in their resolution of moving  slowly a lingering and dreadful death awaited us all; yet my opinion was  a solitary one. Mr. Walker had in many instances plainly and publicly  shown that he on this point differed with me; and he was a medical man,  and one who certainly never shrank from any danger or toil which he  thought it his duty to encounter. The most therefore I could say against  those who were opposed to my system of moving was that I conceived them  to be guilty of a grievous error in judgment; but it was not until our  separate opinions had been tested by the future that it could be  definitely pronounced who was right. Nevertheless those who have been  much with men compelled to make long marches cannot fail to have remarked  how readily and foolishly they find excuses to enable them to obtain a  halt, and such persons would probably have agreed with me in suspecting  that natural indolence of disposition, strengthened by fatigue and  privation, might induce men to adopt, without a very strict  investigation, any opinion falling in with their immediate feelings of  feebleness.    Being firmly convinced that these men intended to pursue a plan of  operations which would entail great misery both upon themselves and the  others, I considered that I ought undoubtedly to endeavour to save them  from the danger which I foresaw impending over them; and this could only  be accomplished by my making forced marches to Perth and sending out  supplies to meet them before they were reduced to the last extremities.  Had I foreseen a week ago that I should be compelled eventually to adopt  such a step I would then have taken with me all such as were willing to  march and have left the others; but this time had passed. My movement to  Perth must now be accomplished with the greatest expedition or it would  be useless; and to take anyone with me who was so much reduced as to have  delayed, impeded, or perhaps altogether to have arrested our progress,  would have sacrificed the lives of all.      CHAPTER 3. FROM WATER PEAK TO GAIRDNER'S RANGE.    RETURN TO THE PARTY.    April 10.    The morning's dawn found us in the vicinity of our comrades, and, just as  the thick grey mists began heavily to ascend from the low plains on which  I had left the party, we emerged from the bush upon the native path down  which we had travelled the preceding evening; here I turned northward,  and a few minutes more placed the party in our view. Some of them were  missing. I felt alarmed lest a new misfortune had happened and, hurrying  on, eagerly asked where they were. The answer given will describe more  truly their position than the most minute detail could do; it was: \"They  are just gone into the bush to suck grass, Sir.\" This semblance of  extreme thirst must however, I suspect, have been in some measure a piece  of affectation upon their parts, for upon the morning of the day before  they had had a plentiful supply of water: whether however their extreme  sufferings were true or feigned mattered not, we fully supplied their  wants; and then I immediately ordered preparations to be made for our  further progress.    We moved on in the direction of the spring of water which lay about half  a mile to the eastward of our true line of route. Our movements were soon  again delayed by Woods, who began as usual to lie down and declare his  inability to proceed any further.    DELAYS CAUSED BY USELESS BAGGAGE. DESTRUCTION OF USELESS BAGGAGE.    I desired him to leave behind the heavy load he was carrying; but as upon  former occasions he again declared his determination to die rather than  part with this mysterious bundle, which appeared to possess an  extraordinary value in his estimation. It was easy to see from his  appearance that he was now really ill and unable to carry such a weight  as he was striving to do. At length he again laid himself down, declaring  that he was dying, and, as I determined no longer to see his life  endangered by his so obstinately insisting on carrying this bundle, I  took it up, and, informing him of my intention to pay him the full value  of any property of his that I might destroy, I proceeded to open it with  the intention of throwing all useless articles away.    Upon this announcement of mine he burst into tears, deplored alternately  his dying state and the loss of the bundle, and then poured forth a  torrent of invectives against me, in the midst of which I quietly went on  unfolding the treasured parcel and exposing to view the following  articles: Three yards of thick heavy canvas; some duck which he had  purloined; a large roll of sewing thread, ditto; a thick pea jacket which  I had abandoned at the boats, and had, at his request, given to him; and  various other old pieces of canvas and duck; also a great part of the  cordage of one of the boats, which he had taken without permission.    When these various articles were produced it was difficult to tell which  was the prevailing sentiment in the minds of some of the party--mirth at  thus seeing the contents of the mysterious bundle exposed, or indignation  that a man should have been so foolish as to endanger his own life and  delay our movements for the sake of such a collection of trash. A pair of  shoes and one or two useful articles were retained, the remainder were  thrown away, and in a few minutes we were again under weigh for the  spring of water.    HALT AT WATER PEAK.    Another hour's march brought us to the spring; and those who with me had  been marching through a great part of the night gladly laid down to rest;  but I soon roused myself again, being urged by the pangs of hunger.  Fortunately I had shot a crow in the morning, and now, gathering a few  wild greens that grew about the water, I cooked a breakfast for myself  and the native without being obliged to draw upon my little store of  flour. This frugal repast having been washed down by a few mouthfuls of  water, I resumed my meditations of the previous night.    CRITICAL SITUATION.    The following appeared to be our true position. We were about one hundred  and ninety miles from Perth, in a direct line measured through the air.  None of the party had more than six or seven pounds of flour left; whilst  I had myself but one pound and a half, and half a pound of arrowroot; the  native had nothing left and was wholly dependant on me for his  subsistence. Now we had been seven days on our route, and had made but  little more than seventy miles, and as the men were much weaker than when  they first started it appeared to me to be extremely problematical  whether we should ever reach Perth unless some plan different from what  we had hitherto pursued was adopted. And even granting that we did  eventually make this point, it was evident that we must previously be  subjected to wants and necessities of the most cruel and distressing  nature.    NEW PLAN OF PROCEEDING.    Yet it was quite manifest from recent events that the majority of the  party had not only made up their minds not to accelerate their movements,  but had fully resolved to compel me to pursue their system of short  marches and long halts. Being fully aware of the danger which threatened  them, it remained for me to act with that decision which circumstances  appeared to require, and to proceed by rapid and forced marches to"]]]
