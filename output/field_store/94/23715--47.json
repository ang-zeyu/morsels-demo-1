And then, before we had time to make reply,  he turned aside a little and lifted his face toward heaven, and, in a  tone far louder than that in which he had spoken to us, but yet so  sweet that it did not startle us at all, came forth from his lips the  first strain of the great song:        \"'Glory to God in the highest!'    \"When he had uttered that, he paused a moment, and the echoes, one  after another, from hills that were near and hills that were far away,  came flying home to us; so that I knew for once what the prophet meant  when he said that all the mountains and the hills should break forth  into singing. But before the echoes had all faded we began to hear  other voices above our heads, a great chorus, taking up the strain  that the angel first had sung. At first it seemed dim and far away;  but gradually it came nearer, and filled all the air, filled all the  earth, filled all our souls with a most entrancing sweetness. Glory to  God in the highest!--that was the grandest part. It seemed as though  there could be no place so high that that strain would not mount up to  it, and no place so happy that that voice would not make it thrill  with new gladness. But then came the softer tones, less grand, but  even sweeter: 'Peace on earth; good will to men.'    \"Oh! my boy, if you had heard that music as I did, you would not  wonder when I tell you that it has been hard for me to wait here, in  the midst of the dreary noises of earth, for fifty years before  hearing it again. But earth that night was musical as heaven. You  should have heard the echoes that came back, when the angels' chorus  ceased, from all these mountains and all these little hills on every  side. There is music enough even in this world, if one can only call  it forth; chords divine that will vibrate with wonderful harmony. It  only needs an angel's hand to touch the trembling strings.\"    \"Did you see the choir of angels overhead, grandfather?\"    \"Nay, I saw nothing. The brightness was too dazzling for mortal eyes.  We all stood there, with downcast eyes, listening spell-bound to the  wonderful melody, until the chorus ceased, and the echoes, one after  another, died away, and the glory faded out of the sky and the stars  came back again, and no sound was heard but the faint voice of a young  lamb, calling for its mother.    \"The first to break the silence was my father. 'Come,' he said, in a  solemn voice. 'Let us go at once to Bethlehem, and see this thing  which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.'    \"So the sheep were quietly gathered into the fold at the tower, and we  hastened to Bethlehem. Never shall I forget that journey by night. We  spake not many words, as we traveled swiftly the twenty furlongs; talk  seemed altogether tame; but now and then my father broke forth in a  song, and the others joined in the chorus. We were not so spent with  running but that we could find voice for singing; and such words as  these of the prophet were the only ones that could give voice to our  swelling hearts:        \"'Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth;        And break forth into singing, O mountains;        For the Lord hath comforted His people,        And will have mercy on His afflicted.        \"'How beautiful upon the mountains        Are the feet of Him that bringeth good tidings,        That publisheth peace,        That bringeth good tidings of good,        That publisheth salvation.'    \"It was midnight when we climbed the hill to the little city of  Bethlehem; the constellation Cesil, called by the Greeks Orion, was  just setting in the west. We knew not whither to go. We had only the  sign of the angel by which we should know the infant Messiah. He was a  babe of one day. He was lying in a manger.    \"'Let us go to the inn Chimham,' said my father. 'It stands on the  very spot where King David was born. Peradvanture we shall find him  there.'    \"Over the entrance to the court of the inn a lantern was swinging from  a rope stretched across from post to post. Guided by its light, we  entered, and found the courtyard full of beasts of burden, showing  that the inn was crowded with travelers. In the arched shelter of the  hostelry as many as could find room were lying; some who could not  sleep were sitting up and waiting drearily for the morning. Two aged  women near the entrance, were talking in a low tone.    \"'Peace be unto you!' said my father.    \"'The Lord be gracious unto thee,' answered the oldest woman, in a  solemn voice, as she looked upon my father's white beard; 'but,' she  quickly added, 'there is scanty cheer in this place for late comers.'    \"'We seek not lodging,' said my father; 'but know you whether among  these guests is an infant born this day?'    \"'Verily there is,' answered the aged dame; 'a man-child more  beautiful than any my eyes have ever beheld. He is lying in a manger  there in the cave that serves for stable.'    \"We hastened to the mouth of the cave, and there beheld our King. The  oxen and the asses were lying near, and a strong man, with a grave and  benignant face, was leaning on his staff above the manger. A beautiful  young mother lay close beside it, her cheek resting on her hands, that  were clasped over the edge of the rock-hewn crib. Into this a little  straw had been thrown, and over it a purple robe had been cast,  whereon the infant lay. A lamp, set upon a projection of the wall of  the cave, burned brightly near. The great eyes of the wonderful child  were wandering about the room; his hand touched his mother's lips. I  waited to hear him open his mouth and speak.    \"There was a moment of silence after we entered the cave. My father  broke it with his salutation:    \"'Hail, thou blessed among women!' he cried. 'This child of thine is a  Prince and a Savior.'    \"And then we all bowed low upon our faces before him and worshipped  him with praise and gladness.    \"The two aged women, with whom we had spoken, had followed us to the  door of the stable, and, seeing us worshipping there, had run to call  others who were awake in the inn, so that when we arose quite a  company were standing at the door, or just within, gazing upon the  King in his beauty and listening to our thanksgiving with great  wonder.    \"Then my father told them all the things that we had heard and  seen--the message of the angel, the song in the air, the glory of the  Lord that had appeared to us--and how we had quickly come to  Bethlehem, and had found things as the angel had told us. 'And it is  even,' he cried, 'as the prophet himself hath spoken: \"Thou Bethlehem  Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out  of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel,  whose going forth hast been of old; even from everlasting.\"'    \"All that heard were full of astonishment--all save the mother. I saw  no wonder on her face; the great things that my father told caused her  no astonishment; she listened with a quiet and solemn joy, like one  who was saying in her heart: 'I knew it all before.'    \"When my father had finished speaking, we all bowed low again before  the young child; and the mother lifted him in her arms and placed his  cheek against her own, smiling graciously on us, but uttering no word.  And we came forth from the stable and stood again beneath the stars in  the courtyard of the inn. By this time many of the travelers were  awake, and an eager company had gathered around us, all of whom  desired to be told of the sign that had been shown to us. To one and  another we rehearsed our story, lingering long to make known the good  tidings, until the morning star appeared and the dawn began to kindle  over the eastern hills. Then we hastened to our own homes in the city,  and told our kindred what had happened unto us. In the early morning  we came back again unto our pastures and our flocks, rejoicing to  stand again in the place where the glory of God had shone and the  music of heaven had filled the air.\"    Stephanus paused, his face all aglow with the tale that he had been  telling. His eyes swept again the circuit of the moonlit hills and  were lifted reverently up to the sky.    \"Did you ever see the Lord Christ after that?\" asked Joseph.    \"Once only. My father and I were at Jerusalem at the passover. It was  the year before my father died, seventeen years ago; it was the same  week on which our Lord was crucified. My father was then an aged  man--fourscore and five years old. Our tent was pitched on the slope  of the Mount of Olives, near the Bethany road. While we sat there one  morning, a great noise of shouting was heard, and presently we saw one  riding on an ass, followed by a great company, crying 'Hosanna!' As we  drew nearer, we heard them say that it was Jesus of Nazareth; and,  when we saw His face, we knew that it was He, by the wonderful eyes,  though it was the face of a bearded man, and not of an infant, and was  very pale and sad. As He drew near to our tent, the city came full  into His view, with its gilded roofs and marble pinnacles, blazing  under the morning sun. Suddenly He paused in the way, and we heard Him  weeping aloud, though we could not hear His words of lamentation. The  multitude halted, too, when we did; and the cheering ceased, and some  of those who stood nearest Him wept also, though no one seemed to know  what had caused His grief. But soon they went on again, and before  they reached the foot of the hill another multitude met them, coming  forth from the city, and we heard their shouts of 'Hosanna in the  Highest!' as they entered the gate of Jerusalem.\"    \"What said your father when he saw all this?\" queried Joseph.    \"He said but little. There was a shadow on his face, yet he spoke  cheerfully. 'I cannot understand it,' he murmured.

When such a prospect is not attainable, one of the chief uses of the  mountain cottage, paradoxical as the idea may appear, is to increase  this sense of solitude. Now, as it will only do so when it is seen at a  considerable distance, it is necessary that it should be visible, or, at  least, that its presence should be indicated, over a considerable  portion of surrounding space. It must not, therefore, be too much shaded  by trees, or it will be useless; but if, on the contrary, it be too  conspicuous on the open hillside, it will be liable to most of the  objections which were advanced against the Swiss cottage, and to  another, which was not then noticed. Anything which, to the eye, is  split into parts, appears less as a whole than what is undivided. Now, a  considerable mass, of whatever tone or color it may consist, is as  easily divisible by dots as by lines; that is, a conspicuous point, on  any part of its surface, will divide it into two portions, each of which  will be individually measured by the eye, but which will never make the  impression which they would have made, had their unity not been  interrupted. A conspicuous cottage on a distant mountain side has this  effect in a fatal degree, and is, therefore, always intolerable.    49. It should accordingly, in order to reconcile the attainment of the  good, with the avoidance of the evil, be barely visible: it should not  tell as a cottage on the eye, though it should on the mind; for be it  observed that, if it is only by the closest investigation that we can  ascertain it to be a human habitation, it will answer the purpose of  increasing the solitude quite as well as if it were evidently so;  because this impression is produced by its appeal to the thoughts, not  by its effect on the eye. Its color, therefore, should be as nearly as  possible that of the hill on which, or the crag beneath which, it is  placed; its form, one that will incorporate well with the ground, and  approach that of a large stone more than of anything else. The color  will consequently, if this rule be followed, be subdued and grayish,  but rather warm; and the form simple, graceful, and unpretending. The  building should retain the same general character on a closer  examination. Everything about it should be natural, and should appear as  if the influences and forces which were in operation around it had been  too strong to be resisted, and had rendered all efforts of art to check  their power, or conceal the evidence of their action, entirely  unavailing. It cannot but be an alien child of the mountains; but it  must show that it has been adopted and cherished by them. This effect is  only attainable by great ease of outline and variety of color;  peculiarities which, as will be presently seen, the Westmoreland cottage  possesses in a supereminent degree.    50. Another feeling, with which one is impressed during a mountain  ramble, is humility. I found fault with the insignificance of the Swiss  cottage, because \"it was not content to sink into a quiet corner, and  personify humility.\" Now, had it not been seen to be pretending, it  would not have been felt to be insignificant; for the feelings would  have been gratified with its submission to, and retirement from, the  majesty of the destructive influences which it rather seemed to rise up  against in mockery. Such pretension is especially to be avoided in the  mountain cottage: it can never lie too humbly in the pastures of the  valley, nor shrink too submissively into the hollows of the hills; it  should seem to be asking the storm for mercy, and the mountain for  protection: and should appear to owe to its weakness, rather than to its  strength, that it is neither overwhelmed by the one, nor crushed by the  other.    51. Such are the chief attributes, without which a mountain cottage  cannot be said to be beautiful. It may possess others, which are  desirable or objectionable, according to their situation, or other  accidental circumstances. The nature of these will be best understood by  examining an individual building. The material is, of course, what is  most easily attainable and available without much labor. The Cumberland  and Westmoreland hills are, in general, composed of clay-slate and  gray-wacke, with occasional masses of chert[7] (like that which forms  the summit of Scawfell), porphyritic greenstone, and syenite. The chert  decomposes deeply, and assumes a rough brown granular surface, deeply  worn and furrowed. The clay-slate or gray-wacke, as it is shattered by  frost, and carried down by torrents, of course forms itself into  irregular flattish masses. The splintery edges of these are in some  degree worn off by the action of water; and, slight decomposition taking  place on the surface of the clay-slate, furnishes an aluminous soil,  which is immediately taken advantage of by innumerable lichens, which  change the dark gray of the original substance into an infinite variety  of pale and warm colors. These stones, thus shaped to his hand, are the  most convenient building materials the peasant can obtain.[8] He lays  his foundation and strengthens his angles with large masses, filling up  the intervals with pieces of a more moderate size; and using here and  there a little cement to bind the whole together, and to keep the wind  from getting through the interstices; but never enough to fill them  altogether up, or to render the face of the wall smooth. At intervals of  from 4 ft. to 6 ft. a horizontal line of flat and broad fragments is  introduced projecting about a foot from the wall. Whether this is  supposed to give strength, I know not; but as it is invariably covered  by luxuriant stonecrop, it is always a delightful object.    [Footnote 7: That is to say, a _flinty_ volcanic ash.]    [Footnote 8: Compare the treatment of a similar theme in _Modern  Painters_, vol. iv., chaps. viii.-x.]    52. The door is flanked and roofed by three large oblong sheets of gray  rock, whose form seems not to be considered of the slightest  consequence. Those which form the cheeks of the windows are generally  selected with more care from the debris of some rock, which is naturally  smooth and polished, after being subjected to the weather, such as  granite or syenite. The window itself is narrow and deep set; in the  better sort of cottages, latticed, but with no affectation of  sweetbrier or eglantine about it. It may be observed of the whole of the  cottage, that, though all is beautiful, nothing is pretty. The roof is  rather flat, and covered with heavy fragments of the stone of which the  walls are built, originally very loose; but generally cemented by  accumulated soil, and bound together by houseleek, moss, and stonecrop:  brilliant in color, and singular in abundance. The form of the larger  cottages, being frequently that of a cross, would hurt the eye by the  sharp angles of the roof, were it not for the cushion-like vegetation  with which they are rounded and concealed. Varieties of the fern  sometimes relieve the massy forms of the stonecrop, with their light and  delicate leafage. Windows in the roof are seldom met with. Of the  chimney I shall speak hereafter.    53. Such are the prevailing peculiarities of the Westmoreland cottage.  \"Is this all?\" some one will exclaim: \"a hovel, built of what first  comes to hand, and in the most simple and convenient form; not one  thought of architectural beauty ever coming into the builder's head!\"  Even so; to this illustration of an excellent rule, I wished  particularly to direct attention: that the material which Nature  furnishes, in any given country, and the form which she suggests, will  always render the building the most beautiful, because the most  appropriate. Observe how perfectly this cottage fulfills the conditions  which were before ascertained to be necessary to perfection. Its color  is that of the ground on which it stands, always subdued and gray, but  exquisitely rich, the color being disposed crumblingly, in groups of  shadowy spots; a deep red brown, passing into black, being finely  contrasted with the pale yellow of the _Lichen geographicus_, and the  subdued white of another lichen, whose name I do not know; all mingling  with each other as on a native rock, and with the same beautiful effect:  the mass, consequently, at a distance, tells only as a large stone  would, the simplicity of its form contributing still farther to render  it inconspicuous. When placed on a mountain-side such a cottage will  become a point of interest, which will relieve its monotony, but will  never cut the hill in two, or take away from its size. In the valley,  the color of these cottages agrees with everything: the green light,  which trembles through the leafage of the taller trees, falls with  exquisite effect on the rich gray of the ancient roofs: the deep pool of  clear water is not startled from its peace by their reflection; the ivy,  or the creepers to which the superior wealth of the peasant of the  valley does now and then pretend, in opposition to the general custom,  cling gracefully and easily to its innumerable crevices; and rock, lake,  and meadow seem to hail it with a brotherly affection, as if Nature had  taken as much pains with it as she has with them.    54. Again, observe its ease of outline. There is not a single straight  line to be met with from foundation to roof; all is bending or broken.  The form of every stone in its walls is a study; for, owing to the  infinite delicacy of structure in all minerals, a piece of stone 3 in.  in diameter, irregularly fractured, and a little worn by the weather,  has precisely the same character of outline which we should find and  admire in a mountain of the same material 6000 ft. high;[9] and,  therefore, the eye, though not feeling the cause, rests on every cranny,  and crack, and fissure with delight. It is true that we have no idea  that every small projection, if"]]]
