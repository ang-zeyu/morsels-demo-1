Leopardi  declared that it were best never to see the light, but denounced suicide  as a cowardly act of selfishness; and yet at the approach of an  epidemic of cholera, he clung so tenaciously to life that he urged a  hurried departure from Naples, regardless of the hardships of such a  journey in his feeble condition, and took refuge in a little villa near  Vesuvius. Hoelderlin's Weltschmerz was absolutely sincere.    Numerous passages might be quoted to show that Hoelderlin's mind was  intensely introspective. This is true also of Lenau, even to a greater  extent, and may be taken as generally characteristic of poets of this  type. The fact that this introspection is an inevitable symptom in many  mental derangements, hypochondria, melancholia and others, indicates a  not very remote relation of Weltschmerz to insanity. In Hoelderlin's  poems there are not a few premonitions of the sad fate which awaited  him. One illustration from the poem \"An die Hoffnung,\" 1801, may  suffice:        Wo bist du? wenig lebt' ich, doch atmet kalt      Mein Abend schon. Und stille, den Schatten gleich,      Bin ich schon hier; und schon gesanglos      Schlummert das schau'rende Herz im Busen.[74]    It is impossible to read these lines without feeling something of the  cold chill of the heart that Hoelderlin felt was already upon him, and  which he expresses in a manner so intensely realistic and yet so  beautiful.    Having thus attempted a review of the growth of Hoelderlin's Weltschmerz  and of its chief characteristics, it merely remains to conclude the  chapter with a brief resume. We have then in Friedrich Hoelderlin a youth  peculiarly predisposed to feel himself isolated from and repelled by the  world, growing up without a strong fatherly hand to guide, giving  himself over more and more to solitude and so becoming continually less  able to cope with untoward circumstances and conditions. Growing into  manhood, he was unfortunate in all his love-affairs and as though doomed  to unceasing disappointments. Early in life he devoted himself to the  study of antiquity, making Greece his hobby, and thus creating for  himself an ideal world which existed only in his imagination, and taking  refuge in it from the buffetings of the world about him. He was a man  of a deeply philosophical trend of mind, and while not often speaking of  it, felt very keenly the humiliating condition of Germany, although his  patriotic enthusiasm found its artistic expression not with reference to  Germany but to Greece. As a poet, finally, his intimacy with nature was  such that nature-worship and pantheism became his religion.    In reviewing the whole range of Hoelderlin's writings, we cannot avoid  the conclusion, that in him we have a type of Weltschmerz in the  broadest sense of the term; we might almost term it Byronism, with the  sensual element eliminated. He shows the hypersensitiveness of Werther,  fanatical enthusiasm for a vague ideal of liberty, vehement opposition  to existing social and political conditions; there is, in fact, a  breadth in his Weltschmerz, which makes the sorrows of Werther seem very  highly specialized in comparison. Bearing in mind the distinction made  between the two classes, we must designate Hoelderlin's Weltschmerz as  cosmic rather than egoistic; the egoistic element is there, but it is  outweighed by the cosmic and finds its poetic expression not so  frequently nor so intensely with reference to the poet himself, as with  reference to mankind at large.

He is par excellence the \"Pathetiker\" of Weltschmerz.    Without presuming even to attempt a final solution of a problem of  pathology concerning which specialists have failed to agree, there seems  to be sufficient circumstantial as well as direct evidence to warrant  the assumption that Lenau's case presents an instance of hereditary  taint. Notwithstanding the fact that Dr. Karl Weiler[75] discredits the  idea of \"erbliche Belastung\" and calls heredity \"den vielgerittenen  Verlegenheitsgaul,\" the conclusion forces itself upon us that if the  theory has any scientific value whatsoever, no more plausible instance  of it could be found than the one under consideration. The poet's  great-grandfather and grandfather had been officers in the Austrian  army, the latter with some considerable distinction. Of his five  children, only Franz, the poet's father, survived. The complete lack of  anything like a systematic education, and the nomadic life of the army  did not fail to produce the most disastrous results in the wild and  dissolute character of the young man. Even before the birth of the poet,  his father had broken his marriage vows and his wife's heart by his  abominable dissipations and drunkenness. Lenau was but five years old  when his father, not yet thirty-five, died of a disease which he is  believed to have contracted as a result of these sensual and senseless  excesses. To the poet he bequeathed something of his own pathological  sensuality, instability of thought and action, lack of will-energy, and  the tears of a heartbroken mother, a sufficient guarantee, surely, of a  poet of melancholy. Even though we cannot avoid the reflection that the  loss of such a father was a blessing in disguise, the fact remains that  Lenau during his childhood and youth needed paternal guidance and  training even more than did Hoelderlin. He became the idol of his mother,  who in her blind devotion did not hesitate to show him the utmost  partiality in all things. This important fact alone must account to a  large extent for that presumptuous pride, which led him to expect  perhaps more than his just share from life and from the world.    Lenau's aimlessness and instability were so extreme that they may  properly be counted a pathological trait. It is best illustrated by his  university career. In 1819 he went to Vienna to commence his studies.  Beginning with Philosophy, he soon transferred his interests to Law,  first Hungarian, then German; finding the study of Law entirely unsuited  to his tastes, he now declared his intention of pursuing once more a  philosophical course, with a view to an eventual professorship. But this  plan was frustrated by his grandmother, the upshot of it all being"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17373"],[0,"The Madonna in Art (#8)"],[1," the work of some Flemish  painter of later date.    By the seventeenth century, the Holy Family in a home environment can  be found somewhat more often in various localities. By the French  painter Mignard there is a well-known picture in the Louvre called La  Vierge a la Grappe. By F. Barocci of Urbino there is an example in the  National Gallery known as the Madonna del Gatto, in which the child  holds a bird out of the reach of a cat. A similar _motif_, certainly  not a pleasant one, is seen in Murillo's Holy Family of the Bird, in  Madrid. By Salimbeni, in the Pitti, is a Holy Family in an interior,  showing the boy Jesus and his cousin St. John playing with puppies.    Rembrandt's domestic Madonna pictures, equally homely as to  environment, are by no means scenes of hilarity, but rather of frugal  contentment. Two similar works bear the title of Le Menage du  Menuisier--the Carpenter's Home. In both, the scene is the interior of  a common room devoted to work and household purposes. Joseph is seen  in the rear at his bench, while the central figures are the mother and  child.    In the Louvre picture, the Virgin's mother is present, caressing her  grandchild, who is held at his mother's breast. The composition at St.  Petersburg (Hermitage Gallery) is simpler, and shows the Virgin  contemplating her babe as he lies asleep in the cradle. Another  well-known picture by Rembrandt is in the Munich Gallery, where again  we have signs of the carpenter's toil, but where the laborer has  stopped for a moment to peep at the babe, who has gone off to  dreamland at his mother's breast and now sleeps sweetly in her lap.  Let those who think such pictures too homely for a sacred theme  compare them with the simplicity of the Gospels.          PART II.    MADONNAS CLASSED ACCORDING TO THEIR SIGNIFICANCE AS TYPES OF  MOTHERHOOD.          CHAPTER VI.    THE MADONNA OF LOVE.    (THE MATER AMABILIS.)      Undoubtedly the most popular of all Madonna subjects--certainly the  most easily understood--is the Mater Amabilis. The mother's mood may  be read at a glance: she is showing in one of a thousand tender ways  her motherly affection for her child. She clasps him in her arms,  holding him to her breast, pressing her face to his, kissing him,  caressing him, or playing with him. Love is written in every line of  her face; love is the key-note of the picture.    The style of composition best adapted to such a theme is manifestly  the simplest. The more formal types of the enthroned and glorified  Madonnas are the least suitable for the display of maternal affection,  while the portrait Madonna, and the Madonna in landscape or domestic  scenes, are readily conceived as the Mater Amabilis. Nevertheless,  these distinctions have not by any means been rigidly regarded in art.  This is manifest in some of the illustrations in Part I., as the  Enthroned Madonna, by Quentin Massys, where the mother kisses her  child, and Angelico's Madonna in Glory, where she holds him to her  cheek.    Gathering our examples from so many methods of composition, we are in  the midst of a multitude of pictures which no man can number, and  which set forth every conceivable phase of motherliness.    Let us make Raphael our starting-point. From the same master whose  influence led him to the study of external nature, he learned also  the study of human nature. To the interpretation of mother-love he  brought all the fresh ardor of youth, and a sunny temperament which  saw only joy in the face of Nature. One after another of the series of  his Florentine pictures gives us a new glimpse of the loving relation  between mother and child.    The Belle Jardiniere gazes into her boy's face in fond absorption. The  Tempi Madonna holds him to her heart, pressing her lips to his soft  cheek. In the Orleans and Colonna pictures she smiles indulgently into  his eyes as he lies across her lap, plucking at the bosom of her  dress. Other pictures show the two eagerly reading together from the  Book of Wisdom (The Conestabile and Ansidei Madonnas).    The painter's later work evinces a growing maturity of thought. In the  Holy Family of Francis I., how strong and tender is the mother's  attitude, as she stoops to lift her child from his cradle; in the  Chair Madonna, how protecting is the capacious embrace with which she  gathers him to herself in brooding love. No technical artistic  education is necessary for the appreciation of such pictures. All who  have known a mother's love look and understand, and look again and are  satisfied.    Correggio touches the heart in much the same way; he, too, saw the  world through rose-colored glasses. His interpretation of life is full  of buoyant enjoyment. Beside the tranquil joy of Raphael's ideals, his  figures express a tumultuous gladness, an overflowing gayety. This is  the more curious because of the singular melancholy which is  attributed to him. The outer circumstances of his life moved in a  quiet groove which was almost humdrum. He passed his days in  comparative obscurity at Parma, far from the great art influences of  his time. But isolation seemed the better to develop his rare  individuality. He was the architect of his own fortunes, and wrought  out independently a style peculiar to himself. His most famous Madonna  pictures are large compositions, crowded with figures of extravagant  attitudes and expression. The fame of these more pretentious works  rests not so much upon their inner significance as upon their splendid  technique. They are unsurpassed for masterly handling of color, and  for triumphs of chiaroscuro.    There are better qualities of sentiment in the smaller pictures, where  the mother is alone with her child. It is here that we find something  worthy to compare with Raphael. There are several of these, produced  in rapid succession during the period when the artist was engaged upon  the frescoes of S. Giovanni (Parma), and soon after marriage had  opened his heart to sweet, domestic influences.    The first was the Uffizi picture, so widely known and loved. The  mother has gathered up her mantle so that it covers her head and drops  at one side on a step, forming a soft, blue cushion for the babe. Here  the little darling lies, looking up into his mother's face. Kneeling  on the step below, she bends over him, with her hands playfully  outstretched, in a transport of maternal affection.    Following this came the picture now in the National Gallery, called  the Madonna della Cesta, from the basket that lies on the ground. It  is a domestic scene in the outer air: the mother is dressing her babe,  and smilingly arrests his hand, which, on a sudden impulse, he has  stretched towards some coveted object. The same face is almost exactly  repeated in the Madonna of the Hermitage Gallery (St. Petersburg),  who offers her breast to her boy, at that moment turning about to  receive some fruit presented by a child angel. There are two  duplicates of this picture in other galleries.    The Zingarella (the Gypsy) is so called from the gypsy turban worn by  the Madonna. The mother, supposed to be painted from the artist's  wife, sits with the child asleep on her lap. With motherly tenderness  she bends so closely over him that her forehead touches his little  head. It is unfortunate that this beautiful work is not better known.  It is in the Naples Gallery.    A comparison of these pictures discloses a remarkable variety in  action and grouping. On the other hand, the Madonnas are quite similar  in general type. With the exception of the Zingarella, who is the most  motherly, they are all in a playful mood. The same playfulness, but  of a more sweet and motherly kind, lights the face of the Madonna  della Scala. The composition is somewhat in the portrait style,  showing the mother in half length, seated under a sort of canopy. The  babe clings closely to her neck, turning about at the spectator with a  glance half shy and half mischievous. His coyness awakens a smile of  tender amusement in the gentle, young face above him.    The picture has an interesting history. It was originally painted in  fresco over the eastern gate of Parma, where Vasari saw and admired  it. In after years, the wall which it decorated was incorporated into  a small new church, of which it formed the rear wall. To accommodate  the high level of the Madonna, the building was somewhat elevated,  and, being entered by a flight of steps, was known as S. Maria della  Scala (of the staircase). The name attached itself to the picture  even after the church was destroyed (in 1812), and the fresco  removed to the town gallery. The marks of defacement which it bears  are due to the votive offerings which were formerly fastened upon  it,--among them, a silver crown worn by the Madonna as late as the  eighteenth century. Though such scars injure its artistic beauty, they  add not a little to the romantic interest which invests it.    [Illustration: CORREGGIO.--MADONNA DELLA SCALA.]    Beside such names as Raphael and Correggio, history furnishes but one  other worthy of comparison for the portrayal of the Mater Amabilis--it  is Titian. His Madonna is by no means uniformly motherly. There are  times when we look in vain for any softening of her aristocratic  features; when her stately dignity seems quite incompatible with  demonstrativeness.[4] But when love melts her heart how gracious is  her unbending, how winning her smile! Once she goes so far as to play  in the fields with her little boy, quieting a rabbit with one hand for  him to admire. (La Vierge au Lapin, Louvre.) In other pictures she  holds him lying across her lap, smiling thoughtfully upon him. Such an  one is the Madonna with Sts. Ulfo and Brigida, in the Madrid Gallery.  The child is taking the flowers St. Brigida offers him, and his mother  looks down with the pleased expression of fond pride. Again, when her  babe holds his two little hands full of the roses his cousin"]]]
