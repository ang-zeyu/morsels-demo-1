We pass to more legitimate observations, noticing in passing that Sirius  is a double star, the companion being of the tenth magnitude, and  distant about ten seconds from the primary. But our beginner is not  likely to see the companion, which is a very difficult object, vowing to  the overpowering brilliancy of the primary.    Orion affords the observer a splendid field of research. It is a  constellation rich in double and multiple stars, clusters, and nebulae.  We will begin with an easy object.    The star [delta] (Plate 3), or _Mintaka_, the uppermost of the three  stars forming the belt, is a wide double. The primary is of the second  magnitude, the secondary of the seventh, both being white.    The star [alpha] (_Betelgeuse_) is an interesting object, on account of  its colour and brilliance, and as one of the most remarkable variables  in the heavens. It was first observed to be variable by Sir John  Herschel in 1836. At this period its variations were \"most marked and  striking.\" This continued until 1840, when the changes became \"much less  conspicuous. In January, 1849, they had recommenced, and on December  5th, 1852, Mr. Fletcher observed [alpha] Orionis brighter than Capella,  and actually the largest star in the northern hemisphere.\" That a star  so conspicuous, and presumably so large, should present such remarkable  variations, is a circumstance which adds an additional interest to the  results which have rewarded the spectrum-analysis of this star by Mr.  Huggins and Professor Miller. It appears that there is decisive evidence  of the presence in this luminary of many elements known to exist in our  own sun; amongst others are found sodium, magnesium, calcium, iron, and  bismuth. Hydrogen appears to be absent, or, more correctly, there are no  lines in the star's spectrum corresponding to those of hydrogen in the  solar spectrum. Secchi considers that there is evidence of an actual  change in the spectrum of the star, an opinion in which Mr. Huggins does  not coincide. In the telescope Betelgeuse appears as \"a rich and  brilliant gem,\" says Lassell, \"a rich topaz, in hue and brilliancy  differing from any that I have seen.\"    Turn next to [beta] (Rigel), the brightest star below the belt. This is  a very noted double, and will severely test our observer's telescope, if  small. The components are well separated (see Plate 3), compared with  many easier doubles; the secondary is also of the seventh magnitude, so  that neither as respects closeness nor smallness of the secondary, is  Rigel a difficult object. It is the combination of the two features  which makes it a test-object. Kitchener says a 1-3/4-inch object-glass  should show Rigel double; in earlier editions of his work he gave  2-3/4-inches as the necessary aperture. Smyth mentions Rigel as a test  for a 4-inch aperture, with powers of from 80 to 120. A 3-inch aperture,  however, will certainly show the companion. Rigel is an orange star, the  companion blue.    Turn next to [lambda] the northernmost of the set of three stars in the  head of Orion. This is a triple star, though an aperture of 3 inches  will show it only as a double. The components are 5\" apart, the colours  pale white and violet. With the full powers of a 3-1/2-inch glass a  faint companion may be seen above [lambda].    The star [zeta], the lowest in the belt, may be tried with a 3-1/2-inch  glass. It is a close double, the components being nearly equal, and  about 2-1/2\" apart (see Plate 3).    For a change we will now try our telescope on a nebula, selecting the  great nebula in the Sword. The place of this object is indicated in  Plate 2. There can be no difficulty in finding it since it is clearly  visible to the naked eye on a moonless night--the only sort of night on  which an observer would care to look at nebulae. A low power should be  employed.    The nebula is shown in Plate 3 as I have seen it with a 3-inch aperture.  We see nothing of those complex streams of light which are portrayed in  the drawings of Herschel, Bond, and Lassell, but enough to excite our  interest and wonder. What is this marvellous light-cloud? One could  almost imagine that there was a strange prophetic meaning in the words  which have been translated \"Canst thou loose the bands of Orion?\"  Telescope after telescope had been turned on this wonderful object with  the hope of resolving its light into stars. But it proved intractable to  Herschel's great reflector, to Lassell's 2-feet reflector, to Lord  Rosse's 3-feet reflector, and even partially to the great 6-feet  reflector. Then we hear of its supposed resolution into stars, Lord  Rosse himself writing to Professor Nichol, in 1846, \"I may safely say  there can be little, if any, doubt as to the resolvability of the  nebula;--all about the trapezium is a mass of stars, the rest of the  nebula also abounding with stars, and exhibiting the characteristics of  resolvability strongly marked.\"    It was decided, therefore, that assuredly the great nebula is a  congeries of stars, and not a mass of nebulous matter as had been  surmised by Sir W. Herschel. And therefore astronomers were not a little  surprised when it was proved by Mr. Huggins' spectrum-analysis that the  nebula consists of gaseous matter. How widely extended this gaseous  universe may be we cannot say. The general opinion is that the nebulae  are removed far beyond the fixed stars. If this were so, the dimensions  of the Orion nebula would be indeed enormous, far larger probably than  those of the whole system whereof our sun is a member. I believe this  view is founded on insufficient evidence, but this would not be the  place to discuss the subject. I shall merely point out that the nebula  occurs in a region rich in stars, and if it is not, like the great  nebula in Argo, clustered around a remarkable star, it is found  associated in a manner which I cannot look upon as accidental with a set  of small-magnitude stars, and notably with the trapezium which surrounds  that very remarkable black gap within the nebula. The fact that the  nebula shares the proper motion of the trapezium appears inexplicable if  the nebula is really far out in space beyond the trapezium. A very small  proper motion of the trapezium (alone) would long since have destroyed  the remarkable agreement in the position of the dark gap and the  trapezium which has been noticed for so many years.    But whether belonging to our system or far beyond it, the great nebula  must have enormous dimensions. A vast gaseous system it is, sustained by  what arrangements or forces we cannot tell, nor can we know what  purposes it subserves. Mr. Huggins' discovery that comets have gaseous  nuclei, (so far as the two he has yet examined show) may suggest the  speculation that in the Orion nebula we see a vast system of comets  travelling in extensive orbits around nuclear stars, and so slowly as to  exhibit for long intervals of time an unchanged figure. \"But of such  speculations\" we may say with Sir J. Herschel \"there is no end.\"    To return to our telescopic observations:--The trapezium affords a  useful test for the light-gathering power of the telescope. Large  instruments exhibit nine stars. But our observer may be well satisfied  with his instrument and his eye-sight if he can see five with a  3-1/2-inch aperture.[3] A good 3-inch glass shows four distinctly. But  with smaller apertures only three are visible.    The whole neighbourhood of the great nebula will well repay research.  The observer may sweep over it carefully on any dark night with profit.  Above the nebula is the star-cluster 362 H. The star [iota] (double as  shown in Plate 3) below the nebula is involved in a strong nebulosity.  And in searching over this region we meet with delicate double, triple,  and multiple stars, which make the survey interesting with almost any  power that may be applied.    Above the nebula is the star [sigma], a multiple star. To an observer  with a good 3-1/2-inch glass [sigma] appears as an octuple star. It is  well seen, however, as a fine multiple star with a smaller aperture.  Some of the stars of this group appear to be variable.    The star [rho] Orionis is an unequal, easy double, the components being  separated by nearly seven seconds. The primary is orange, the smaller  star smalt-blue (see Plate 3).    The middle star of the belt ([epsilon]) has a distant blue companion.  This star, like [iota], is nebulous. In fact, the whole region within  the triangle formed by stars [gamma], [kappa] and [beta] is full of  nebulous double and multiple stars, whose aggregation in this region I  do not consider wholly accidental.    We have not explored half the wealth of Orion, but leave much for future  observation. We must turn, however, to other constellations.    Below Orion is Lepus, the Hare, a small constellation containing some  remarkable doubles. Among these we may note [xi], a white star with a  scarlet companion; [gamma], a yellow and garnet double; and [iota], a  double star, white and pale violet, with a distant red companion. The  star [kappa] Leporis is a rather close double, white with a small green  companion. The intensely red star R Leporis (a variable) will be found  in the position indicated in the map.    Still keeping within the boundary of our map, we may next turn to the  fine cluster 2 H (vii.) in Monoceros. This cluster is visible to the  naked eye, and will be easily found. The nebula 2 H (iv.) is a  remarkable one with a powerful telescope.    The star 11 Monocerotis is a fine triple star described by the elder  Herschel as one of the finest sights in the heavens. Our observer,  however, will see it as a double (see Plate 3). [delta] Monocerotis is  an easy double, yellow and lavender.

My  Father was away on a journey, and could not return as early as  usual. It was about two or three o'clock in the afternoon; the sun  was shining brightly, and all the world seemed gay. I was alone at  the window, looking on to the kitchen garden, my mind full of  cheerful thoughts, when I saw before me, in front of the  wash-house, a man dressed exactly like Papa, of the same height  and appearance, but more bent and aged. I say _aged,_ to describe  his general appearance, for I did not see his face as his head was  covered with a thick veil. He advanced slowly, with measured step,  along my little garden; at that instant a feeling of supernatural  fear seized me, and I called out loudly in a trembling voice:  \"Papa, Papa!\" The mysterious person seemed not to hear, he  continued his walk without even turning, and went towards a clump  of firs which grew in the middle of the garden. I expected to see  him reappear at the other side of the big trees, but the prophetic  vision had vanished.    It was all over in a moment, but it was a moment which impressed  itself so deeply on my memory that even now, after so many years,  the remembrance of it is as vivid as the vision itself.    My sisters were all together in an adjoining room. Hearing me call  \"Papa!\" they were frightened themselves, but Marie, hiding her  feelings, ran to me and said: \"Why are you calling Papa, when he  is at Alencon?\" I told her what I had seen, and to reassure me  they said that Nurse must have covered her head with her apron on  purpose to frighten me. Victoire, however, when questioned,  declared she had not left the kitchen--besides, the truth was too  deeply impressed on my mind: I had seen a man, and that man was  exactly like my Father. We all went to look behind the clump of  trees, and, finding nothing, my sisters told me to think no more  about it. Ah, that was not in my power! Often and often my  imagination brought before me this mysterious vision, often and  often I tried to raise the veil which hid its true meaning, and  deep down in my heart I had a conviction that some day it would be  fully revealed to me. And you know all, dear Mother. You know that  it was really my Father whom God showed me, bent by age, and  bearing on his venerable face and his white head the symbol of his  terrible trial.[4]    As the Adorable Face of Jesus was veiled during His Passion, so it  was fitting that the face of His humble servant should be veiled  during the days of his humiliation, in order that it might shine  with greater brilliancy in Heaven. How I admire God's ways! He  showed us this precious cross beforehand, as a father shows his  children the glorious future he is preparing for them--a future  which will bring them an inheritance of priceless treasures.    But a thought comes into my mind: \"Why did God give this light to  a child who, if she had understood it, would have died of grief?\"  \"Why?\" Here is one of those incomprehensible mysteries which we  shall only understand in Heaven, where they will be the subject of  our eternal admiration. My God, how good Thou art! How well dost  Thou suit the trial to our strength!    At that time I had not courage even to think that Papa could die,  without being terrified. One day he was standing on a high  step-ladder, and as I was close by he called out: \"Move away,  little Queen; if I fall I shall crush you.\" Instantly I felt an  inward shock, and, going still nearer to the ladder, I thought:  \"At least if Papa falls I shall not have the pain of seeing him  die, for I shall die with him.\" I could never say how much I loved  him. I admired everything he did. When he explained his ideas on  serious matters, as if I were a big girl, I answered him naively:  \"It is quite certain, Papa, that if you spoke like that to the  great men who govern the country they would take you and make you  King. Then France would be happier than it was ever been; but you  would be unhappy, because that is the lot of kings; besides you  would no longer be my King alone, so I am glad that they do not  know you.\"    When I was six or seven years old I saw the sea for the first  time. The sight made a deep impression on me, I could not take my  eyes off it. Its majesty, and the roar of the waves, all spoke to  my soul of the greatness and power of God. I remember, when we  were on the beach, a man and woman looked at me for a long time,  then, asking Papa if I was his child, they remarked that I was a  very pretty little girl. Papa at once made a sign to them not to  flatter me; I was delighted to hear what they said, for I did not  think I was pretty. My sisters were most careful never to talk  before me in such a way as to spoil my simplicity and childish  innocence; and, because I believed so implicitly in them, I  attached little importance to the admiration of these people and  thought no more about it.    That evening at the hour when the sun seems to sink into the vast  ocean, leaving behind it a trail of glory, I sat with Pauline on a  bare rock, and gazed for long on this golden furrow which she told  me was an image of grace illumining the way of faithful souls here  below. Then I pictured my soul as a tiny barque, with a graceful  white sail, in the midst of the furrow, and I resolved never to  let it withdraw from the sight of Jesus, so that it might sail  peacefully and quickly towards the Heavenly Shore.  ______________________________    [1] This holy nun had been professed at the Carmel of Poitiers,  and was sent from there to make the foundation at Lisieux in 1838.  Her memory is held in benediction in both these convents; in the  sight of God she constantly practised the most heroic virtue, and  on December 5, 1891, crowned a life of good works by a holy death.  She was then eighty-six years of age.    [2] This house, an object of deep interest to the clients of Soeur  Therese, is much frequented by pilgrims to Lisieux.

At the age of sixty-six, having already had several  partial attacks, he was struck with general paralysis, and his  mind gave way altogether.    ______________________________    CHAPTER III  PAULINE ENTERS THE CARMEL    I was eight and a half when Leonie left school, and I took her  place at the Benedictine Abbey in Lisieux. The girls of my class  were all older than myself; one of them was fourteen, and, though  not clever, she knew how to impose on the little ones. Seeing me  so young, nearly always first in class, and a favourite with all  the nuns, she was jealous, and used to pay me out in a thousand  ways. Naturally timid and sensitive, I did not know how to defend  myself, and could only cry in silence. Celine and my elder sisters  did not know of my grief, and, not being advanced enough in virtue  to rise above these troubles, I suffered considerably.    Every evening I went home, and then my spirits rose. I would climb  on to Papa's knee, telling him what marks I had, and his caresses  made me forget all my troubles. With what delight I announced the  result of my first essay, for I won the maximum number of marks.  In reward I received a silver coin which I put in my money box for  the poor, and nearly every Thursday I was able to increase the  fund.    Indeed, to be spoilt was a real necessity for me. The Little  Flower had need to strike its tender roots deeper and deeper into  the dearly loved garden of home, for nowhere else could it find  the nourishment it required. Thursday was a holiday, but it was  not like the holidays I had under Pauline, which I generally spent  upstairs with Papa. Not knowing how to play like other children, I  felt myself a dull companion. I tried my best to do as the others  did, but without success.    After Celine, who was, so to say, indispensable to me, I sought  the company of my little cousin Marie, because she left me free to  choose the games I liked best. We were already closely united in  heart and will, as if God were showing us in advance how one day  in the Carmel we should embrace the same religious life.[1]    Very often, at my uncle's house, we used to play at being two  austere hermits, with only a poor hut, a little patch of corn, and  a garden in which to grow a few vegetables. Our life was to be  spent in continual contemplation, one praying while the other  engaged in active duties. All was done with religious gravity and  decorum. If we went out, the make-believe continued even in the  street; the two hermits would say the Rosary, using their fingers  to count on, so as not to display their devotion before those who  might scoff. One day, however, the hermit Therese forgot  herself--before eating a cake, given her for lunch, she made a  large Sign of the Cross, and some worldly folk did not repress a  smile.    We were so bent on always doing the same thing that sometimes we  carried it too far. Endeavouring one evening, on our way home from  school, to imitate the modest demeanour of the hermits, I said to  Marie: \"Lead me, I am going to shut my eyes.\" \"So am I,\" she  answered. Being on the pavement we were in no fear of vehicles,  and for a short while all went well, and we enjoyed walking with  our eyes shut; but presently we both fell over some boxes standing  at a shop door and knocked them down. The shopkeeper came out in a  rage to replace them, but the would-be blind pair picked  themselves up and ran off as fast as they could, with eyes wide  open. Then the hermits had to listen to a well-deserved scolding  from Jeanne, the maid, who seemed as vexed as the shopkeeper.    I have not yet told you"]]]
