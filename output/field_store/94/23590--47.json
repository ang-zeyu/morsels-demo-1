They restrict their claim to the  stopping of cargoes destined for or coming from the enemy's territory.    \"5. As regards cotton, full particulars of the arrangements contemplated  have already been explained. It will be admitted that every possible  regard has been had to the legitimate interests of the American cotton  trade.    \"6. Finally, in reply to the penultimate paragraph of your Excellency's  note, I have the honor to state that it is not intended to interfere  with neutral vessels carrying enemy cargo of non-contraband nature  outside European waters, including the Mediterranean.\"    (Here follows the text of the Order in Council, which already has been  printed.)    American Ambassador, London.      VI.    FRENCH GOVERNMENT'S ANSWER.    _The French Government transmitted the following message:_    PARIS, March 14, 1915.    French Government replies as follows:    \"In a letter dated March 7 your Excellency was good enough to draw my  attention to the views of the Government of the United States regarding  the recent communications from the French and British Governments  concerning a restriction to be laid upon commerce with Germany.  According to your Excellency's letter, the declaration made by the  allied Governments presents some uncertainty as regards its application,  concerning which the Government of the United States desires to be  enlightened in order to determine what attitude it should take.    \"At the same time your Excellency notified me that, while granting the  possibility of using new methods of retaliation against the new use to  which submarines have been put, the Government of the United States was  somewhat apprehensive that the allied belligerents might (if their  action is to be construed as constituting a blockade) capture in waters  near America any ships which might have escaped the cruisers patrolling  European waters. In acknowledging receipt of your Excellency's  communication I have the honor to inform you that the Government of the  republic has not failed to consider this point as presented by the  Government of the United States, and I beg to specify clearly the  conditions of application, as far as my Government is concerned of the  declaration of the allied Governments. As well set forth by the Federal  Government, the old methods of blockade cannot be entirely adhered to in  view of the use Germany has made of her submarines, and also by reason  of the geographical situation of that country. In answer to the  challenge to the neutrals as well as to its own adversaries contained in  the declaration, by which the German Imperial Government stated that it  considered the seas surrounding Great Britain and the French coast on  the Channel as a military zone, and warned neutral vessels not to enter  the same on account of the danger they would run, the allied Governments  have been obliged to examine what measures they could adopt to interrupt  all maritime communication with the German Empire and thus keep it  blockaded by the naval power of the two allies, at the same time,  however, safeguarding as much as possible the legitimate interests of  neutral powers and respecting the laws of humanity which no crime of  their enemy will induce them to violate.    \"The Government of the republic, therefore, reserves to itself the right  of bringing into a French or allied port any ship carrying a cargo  presumed to be of German origin, destination, or ownership, but it will  not go to the length of seizing any neutral ship except in case of  contraband. The discharged cargo shall not be confiscated. In the event  of a neutral proving his lawful ownership of merchandise destined to  Germany, he shall be entirely free to dispose of same, subject to  certain conditions. In case the owner of the goods is a German, they  shall simply be sequestrated during the war.    \"Merchandise of enemy origin shall only be sequestrated when it is at  the same time the property of an enemy. Merchandise belonging to  neutrals shall be held at the disposal of its owner to be returned to  the port of departure.    \"As your Excellency will observe, these measures, while depriving the  enemy of important resources, respect the rights of neutrals and will  not in any way jeopardize private property, as even the enemy owner will  only suffer from the suspension of the enjoyment of his rights during  the term of hostilities.    \"The Government of the republic, being desirous of allowing neutrals  every facility to enforce their claims, (here occurred an undecipherable  group of words,) give the prize court, an independent tribunal,  cognizance of these questions, and in order to give the neutrals as  little trouble as possible it has specified that the prize court shall  give sentence within eight days, counting from the date on which the  case shall have been brought before it.    \"I do not doubt, Mr. Ambassador, that the Federal Government, comparing  on the one hand the unspeakable violence with which the German Military  Government threatens neutrals, the criminal actions unknown in maritime  annals already perpetrated against neutral property and ships, and even  against the lives of neutral subjects or citizens, and on the other hand  the measures adopted by the allied Governments of France and Great  Britain, respecting the laws of humanity and the rights of individuals,  will readily perceive that the latter have not overstepped their strict  rights as belligerents.    \"Finally, I am anxious to assure you that it is not and it has never  been the intention of the Government of the republic to extend the  action of its cruisers against enemy merchandise beyond the European  seas, the Mediterranean included.\"    SHARP.      British Order in Council    Declaring a Blockade of German Ports    _LONDON, March 15.--The British Order in Council decreeing retaliatory  measures on the part of the Government to meet the declaration of the  Germans that the waters surrounding the United Kingdom are a military  area, was made public today. The text of the order follows:_    Whereas, the German Government has issued certain orders which, in  violation of the usages of war, purport to declare that the waters  surrounding the United Kingdom are a military area in which all British  and allied merchant vessels will be destroyed irrespective of the safety  and the lives of the passengers and the crews, and in which neutral  shipping will be exposed to similar danger in view of the uncertainties  of naval warfare, and    Whereas, in the memorandum accompanying the said orders, neutrals are  warned against intrusting crews, passengers, or goods to British or  allied ships, and    Whereas, such attempts on the part of the enemy give to his Majesty an  unquestionable right of retaliation; and    Whereas, his Majesty has therefore decided to adopt further measures in  order to prevent commodities of any kind from reaching or leaving  Germany, although such measures will be enforced without risk to neutral  ships or to neutral or non-combatant life and in strict observance of  the dictates of humanity; and    Whereas, the allies of his Majesty are associated with him in the steps  now to be announced for restricting further the commerce of Germany, his  Majesty is therefore pleased by and with the advice of his Privy Council  to order, and it is hereby ordered, as follows:    First--No merchant vessel which sailed from her port of departure after  March 1, 1915, shall be allowed to proceed on her voyage to any German  port. Unless this vessel receives a pass enabling her to proceed to some  neutral or allied port to be named in the pass, the goods on board any  such vessel must be discharged in a British port and placed in custody  of the Marshal of the prize court. Goods so discharged, if not  contraband of war, shall, if not requisitioned for the use of his  Majesty, be restored by order of the court and upon such terms as the  court may in the circumstances deem to be just to the person entitled  thereto.    Second--No merchant vessel which sailed from any German port after March  1, 1915, shall be allowed to proceed on her voyage with any goods on  board laden at such port. All goods laden at such port must be  discharged in a British or allied port. Goods so discharged in a British  port shall be placed in the custody of the Marshal of the prize court,  and if not requisitioned for the use of his Majesty shall be detained or  sold under the direction of the prize court.    The proceeds of the goods so sold shall be paid into the court and dealt  with in such a manner as the court may in the circumstances deem to be  just, provided that no proceeds of the sale of such goods shall be paid  out of the court until the conclusion of peace, except on the  application of a proper officer of the Crown, unless it be shown that  the goods had become neutral property before the issue of this order,  and provided also that nothing herein shall prevent the release of  neutral property, laden at such enemy port, on the application of the  proper officer of the Crown.    Third--Every merchant vessel which sailed from her port of departure  after March 1, 1915, on her way to a port other than a German port and  carrying goods with an enemy destination, or which are enemy property,  may be required to discharge such goods in a British or allied port. Any  goods so discharged in a British port shall be placed in the custody of  the Marshal of the prize court, and unless they are contraband of war  shall, if not requisitioned for the use of his Majesty, be restored by  an order of the court upon such terms as the court may in the  circumstances deem to be just to the person entitled"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15479"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 2, May, 1915 (#8)"],[1,"s, O.N. 174,232, New Zealand.

Doveton-Sturdee, K.C.B., C.V.O., C.M.G., reporting the action off the  Falkland Islands on Tuesday, the 8th of December, 1914:_    INVINCIBLE, at Sea,  Dec. 19, 1914.    Sir: I have the honor to forward a report on the action which took place  on Dec. 8, 1914, against a German squadron off the Falkland Islands.    I have the honor to be, Sir,    Your obedient servant,    F.C.D. STURDEE,  Vice Admiral, Commander in Chief.  The Secretary, Admiralty.    (A)--PRELIMINARY MOVEMENTS.    The squadron, consisting of H.M. ships Invincible, flying my flag, Flag  Capt. Percy T.M. Beamish; Inflexible, Capt. Richard F. Phillimore;  Carnarvon, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Archibald P. Soddart, Flag  Capt. Harry L.d'E. Skipwith; Cornwall, Capt. Walter M. Ellerton; Kent,  Capt. John D. Allen; Glasgow, Capt. John Loce; Bristol, Capt. Basil H.  Fanshawe, and Macedonia, Capt. Bertram S. Evans, arrived at Port  Stanley, Falkland Islands, at 10:30 A.M. on Monday, Dec. 7, 1914.  Coaling was commenced at once, in order that the ships should be ready  to resume the search for the enemy's squadron the next evening, Dec. 8.    At 8 A.M. on Tuesday, Dec. 8, a signal was received from the signal  station on shore:    \"A four-funnel and two-funnel man-of-war in sight from Sapper Hill,  steering northward.\"    [Illustration: THE BATTLE OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS FROM THE OFFICIAL  REPORT OF ADMIRAL STURDEE.    The numbers given on the plan show the corresponding positions of  vessels at various times. All ships bearing the same number were  simultaneously in the positions charted.]    At this time the positions of the various ships of the squadron were as  follows:    Macedonia: At anchor as lookout ship.    Kent (guard ship): At anchor in Port William.    Invincible and Inflexible: In Port William.    Carnarvon: In Port William.    Cornwall: In Port William.    Glasgow: In Port Stanley.    Bristol: In Port Stanley.    The Kent was at once ordered to weigh, and a general signal was made to  raise steam for full speed.    At 8:20 A.M. the signal station reported another column of smoke in  sight to the southward, and at 8:45 A.M. the Kent passed down the harbor  and took up a station at the entrance.    The Canopus, Capt. Heathcoat S. Grant, reported at 8:47 A.M. that the  first two ships were eight miles off, and that the smoke reported at  8:20 A.M. appeared to be the smoke of two ships about twenty miles off.    At 8:50 A.M. the signal station reported a further column of smoke in  sight to the southward.    The Macedonia was ordered to weigh anchor on the inner side of the other  ships, and await orders.    At 9:20 A.M. the two leading ships of the enemy, (Gneisenau and  Nuernberg,) with guns trained on the wireless station, came within range  of the Canopus, which opened fire at them across the low land at a range  of 11,000 yards. The enemy at once hoisted their colors and turned away.  At this time the masts and smoke of the enemy were visible from the  upper bridge of the Invincible at a range of approximately 17,000 yards  across the low land to the south of Port William.    A few minutes later the two cruisers altered course to port, as though  to close the Kent at the entrance to the harbor, but about this time it  seems that the Invincible and Inflexible were seen over the land, as the  enemy at once altered course and increased speed to join their  consorts.    The Glasgow weighed and proceeded at 9:40 A.M. with orders to join the  Kent and observe the enemy's movements.    At 9:45 A.M. the squadron--less the Bristol--weighed, and proceeded out  of harbor in the following order: Carnarvon, Inflexible, Invincible, and  Cornwall. On passing Cape Pembroke Light the five ships of the enemy  appeared clearly in sight to the southeast, hull down. The visibility  was at its maximum, the sea was calm, with a bright sun, a clear sky,  and a light breeze from the northwest.    At 10:20 A.M. the signal for a general chase was made. The battle  cruisers quickly passed ahead of the Carnarvon and overtook the Kent.  The Glasgow was ordered to keep two miles from the Invincible, and the  Inflexible was stationed on the starboard quarter of the flagship. Speed  was eased to twenty knots at 11:15 A.M., to enable the other cruisers to  get into station.    At this time the enemy's funnels and bridges showed just above the  horizon.    Information was received from the Bristol at 11:27 A.M. that three enemy  ships had appeared off Port Pleasant, probably colliers or transports.  The Bristol was therefore directed to take the Macedonia under orders  and destroy transports.    The enemy were still maintaining their distance, and I decided, at 12:20  P.M., to attack with the two battle cruisers and the Glasgow.    At 12:47 P.M. the signal to \"Open fire and engage the enemy\" was made.    The Inflexible opened fire at 12:55 P.M. from her fore turret at the  right-hand ship of the enemy, a light cruiser; a few minutes later the  Invincible opened fire at the same ship.    The deliberate fire from a range of 16,500 to 15,000 yards at the  right-hand light cruiser, which was dropping astern, became too  threatening, and when a shell fell close alongside her at 1:20 P.M. she  (the Leipzig) turned away, with the Nuernberg and Dresden, to the  southwest.    These light cruisers were at once followed by the Kent, Glasgow, and  Cornwall, in accordance with my instructions.    The action finally developed into three separate encounters, besides the  subsidiary one dealing with the threatened landing.    (B.)--ACTION WITH THE ARMORED CRUISERS.    The fire of the battle cruisers was directed on the Scharnhorst and  Gneisenau. The effect of this was quickly seen when, at 1:25 P.M., with  the Scharnhorst leading, they turned about seven points to port in  succession into line ahead and opened fire at 1:30 P.M. Shortly  afterward speed was eased to twenty-four knots and the battle cruisers  were ordered to turn together, bringing them into line ahead, with the  Invincible leading.    The range was about 13,500 yards at the final turn, and increased until  at 2 P.M. it had reached 16,450 yards.    The enemy then (2:10 P.M.) turned away about ten points to starboard,  and a second chase ensued until at 2:45 P.M. the battle cruisers again  opened fire; this caused the enemy, at 2:53 P.M., to turn into line  ahead to port and open fire at 2:55 P.M."]]]
