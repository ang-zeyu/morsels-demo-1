The kopjes  on the farther side of the stream were bristling with Boers, and away on  the veldt beyond was drawn up the Staats artillery. And then one  realized a most awful blunder of the Reform Committee, from their point  of view. The Boer forces, arriving hereabouts in hot haste, from a rapid  mobilization, had been almost entirely without ammunition. We were told  on good authority that each burgher had but six rounds, and that the  field-guns were without any shells at all. During the night the  necessary supply was brought by rail from Pretoria, actually right  through Johannesburg. Either by accident or mature reflection on the  part of the conspirators in that city, this train was allowed to pass to  its destination unmolested. It proved to be one of those small  happenings that completely alter the course of events. If the burghers  had not stopped the Raiders there, nothing could have prevented them  from entering Johannesburg, for after another three miles the  long-sought-for chimneys--the overhanging cloud of smoke--would have  come into view. The very stars in their courses seemed to have fought  for the Boers, and justified President Kruger's belief that his people  were specially under the protection of Providence.[11] Neither will  anyone ever determine the number of Boers killed at Krugersdorp. One  _Veldtcornet_ inserted in all the papers that he defied anyone to prove  that more than four burghers were shot, and of these two were killed  accidentally by their own rifles. Residents on the spot, however,  averred that many more fell; but I think the point was not disputed in  view of President Kruger's famous claim for \"moral and intellectual  damages,\" which was then already beginning to be mooted.    The lengthening shadows at last reminded us that we had to return to  town for a dinner-party given in our honour. It usually takes some time  to catch a team of six mules and two horses turned out to graze on the  veldt; it is endless, however, when they are as frightened of their  drivers as ours appeared to be. At length they were collected and we  made a start, and then our adventures began. First the leader, a white  horse, jibbed. Off jumped the Kaffir coachman, and commenced hammering  the poor brute unmercifully over head, ears, and body, with what they  called in Africa the _shambok_.[12] In consequence the team suddenly  started off, but the long whip, left on the carriage roof, slipped down,  and was broken in two by the wheel passing over it. Anyone who has  driven behind mules knows how absolutely powerless the Jehu is without a  long whip; so here we were face to face with a real misfortune:  increasing darkness, jibbing leaders, no whip, and fifteen sandy miles  to traverse before dinner-time. With every sort of ejaculation and yell,  and a perfect rain of blows with the _shambok_ from the Kaffir still on  foot, we lurched forward at a gallop, escaping by a hair's-breadth  another gold-prospector's trench. But the same leader jibbed again after  another mile. I must admit he was a most irritating brute, whose  obstinacy had been increased by the cruelty of the driver. It was now  decided to put him in the \"wheel,\" where he would be obliged to do his  work. We crawled on again till our white friend literally threw himself  down. I have related this incident to show how cruel Kaffirs can be, for  now the rage of the evil-looking driver burst forth. He not only  hammered the prostrate horse to any extent, but then made the rest of  the team pull on, so as to drag him along on his side. Of course this  could not be allowed, and Major ---- jumped out and commanded him to  desist, take out the useless horse, and tie him behind. At first the  Kaffir was very mutinous, and it was only when a stick was laid  threateningly across his back that he sulkily complied, looking the  while as if he would like to murder the man he was forced to obey. One  hears so much nowadays of the black population having equal rights with  the white inhabitants, that it is well to remember how ferociously their  lack of civilization occasionally comes out. Doubtless there are cruel  men both white and black, but for downright brutality the nigger is hard  to beat, and it is also quite certain that whom the latter does not fear  he will not love. I have personally experienced great devotion and most  attentive service on the part of natives, and they are deserving of the  kindest and most considerate treatment; but it has often made me  indignant to hear people, who have had little or no experience of living  in the midst of a native population, prate of the rights of our \"black  brothers,\" and argue as if the latter thought, judged, amused  themselves, or, in short, behaved, as the white men do, who have the  advantage of hundreds of years of culture.    The day following our drive to Krugersdorp we left for Cape Town and  England. We made the voyage on the old _Roslin Castle_. Always a slow  boat, she had on this occasion, in sporting parlance, a \"wing down,\"  having broken a piston-rod on her way out from England, when we had  vainly awaited her at Cape Town, and I think it was nearly three weeks  before we landed at Plymouth. Again Randolph's African journey was  brought back to my recollection. The captain of the _Roslin Castle_,  Travers by name, had commanded the _Scot_, which brought his party home  from Mashonaland, and he had very agreeable recollections of many an  interesting conversation and of quiet rubbers of whist.    Numerous and exciting events had been crowded into the past six weeks,  and in spite of revolutions and strife we had found our South African  visit a very pleasant one. A curious thing about that continent is: you  may dislike it or fall under its charm, but in any case it nearly always  calls you back. It certainly did in my case; and while recalling the  people we had met and the information we had acquired it was impossible  not to think a little of the Boers themselves, their characteristics and  their failings. At Johannesburg I had been specially struck by men, who  knew them from long experience, telling me how fully they appreciated  the good points of the burghers--for instance, their bravery, their love  of their country, and their simple, unquestioning, if unattractive  faith, which savoured of that of the old Puritans. Against these  attributes their pig-headedness, narrow-mindedness, laziness, and  slovenliness had to be admitted. All these defects militated against  their living in harmony with a large, increasing, and up-to-date  community like the Johannesburg Uitlanders. Still, one could not forget  that the Transvaal was their country, ceded to them by the English  nation. They left Cape Colony years ago, to escape our laws, which they  considered unjust. It is certain we should never have followed them into  the Transvaal but for the sudden discovery of the gold industry; it is  equally true they had not the power or the wish to develop this for  themselves, and yet without it they were a bankrupt nation. There is no  doubt that the men who made the most mischief, and who for years  embarrassed the President, were the \"Hollanders,\" or officials sent out  from the mother-country of the Dutch. They looked on the Transvaal only  as a means for getting rich. Hence the fearful state of bribery and  corruption among them, from the highest official downwards. But this  very bribery and corruption were sometimes exceedingly convenient, and I  remember well, when I revisited Johannesburg in 1902, at the conclusion  of the war, hearing people inveigh against the hard bargains driven by  the English Government; they even went so far as to sigh again for the  good old days of Kruger's rule. Now all is changed once more, after  another turn of the kaleidoscope of time, and yet it is well to remember  that such things have indeed been.            CHAPTER V         THREE YEARS AFTER--LORD MILNER AT CAPE TOWN BEFORE THE       WAR--MR. CECIL RHODES AT GROOT SCHUURR--OTHER INTERESTING       PERSONAGES         \"There are many echoes in the world, but few voices.\"                                                    GOETHE.      On May 6, 1899, we sailed from Southampton on the S.S. _Norman_. We  purposed to spend a few months in Rhodesia, but such is the frailty of  human plans that eventually we stayed in South Africa for one year and  three months.    Dr. Jameson was our fellow-passenger to Cape Town, and with him we  travelled up to Bulawayo, and passed five weeks there as the guests of  Major Maurice Heaney.[13] Part of this time we spent on the veldt, far  from civilization, sleeping in tents, and using riding ponies and mule  waggons as transport. I can recommend this life as a splendid cure for  any who are run down or overworked. The climate of Rhodesia in the month  of June is perfection; rain is unknown, except as the accompaniment of  occasional thunderstorms; and it is never too hot to be pleasant. Game  was even then practically non-existent in Matabeleland, but our object  was to inspect the mines of Major Heaney's various companies. The  country was pretty and well wooded, and we crossed many river-beds,  amongst them the wide Umzingwani. This stream is a mighty torrent during  the rains, but, like many others in South Africa, it becomes perfectly  dry during the winter season, a peculiarity of the continent, which  caused a disappointed man to write that South Africa produced \"birds  without song, flowers without smell, and rivers without water.\"    While camped on the banks of this vanished river, we used to hear lions  roaring as evening fell, and could distinguish their soft pads in the  dry sand next morning; but they were so shy that we never caught a  glimpse of one, nor could they be tempted into any ambush.    During these weeks the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14470"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 12 (#8)"],[1,"tably_).    Nonsense, you are not his wife nor even openly his fiancee. You are in  your father's house and belong in my circle.--H'm! I see he treasures  it up against me that I did some plain speaking the other day. I think  I was a little impatient.    ADELAIDE (_nodding her head_).    Yes, a little, I hear.    IDA.    He is worried about the way you feel, dear father.    COLONEL.    Well, I have reason enough to be vexed; don't remind me of it. And  that, in addition, he lets himself be mixed up in these elections, is  unpardonable.    [_Walks up and down._]    But you had better send for him, Ida.    IDA _rings. Enter_ CARL.    IDA.    Our compliments to the professor and we are waiting coffee for him.    [_Exit_ CARL.]    COLONEL.    Well, that about waiting was not quite necessary. Why, we have  finished our coffee.    ADELAIDE.    Ida has not finished yet.    IDA.    Hush!    ADELAIDE.    Why did he ever let himself be put up as candidate? He has plenty to  do as it is.    COLONEL.    Pure ambition, girls. The devil of ambition possesses these young men.  He impels them as steam does a locomotive.    IDA.    No, father, _he_ never thought of himself in the matter.    COLONEL.    It does not stand out quite so nakedly as, \"I must make a career for  myself,\" or \"I wish to become a famous man.\" The procedure is more  delicate. The good friends come along and say: \"Your duty to the good  cause requires you to--it is a crime against your country if you do  not--it is a sacrifice for you but we demand it.\" And so a pretty  mantle is thrown around vanity, and the candidate issues forth--from  pure patriotism of course! Don't teach an old soldier worldly wisdom.  We, dear Adelaide, sit calmly by and laugh at such weaknesses.    ADELAIDE.    And are indulgent toward them when we have so good a heart as you.    COLONEL.    Yes, one profits by experience.    _Enter_ CARL.    CARL.    Mr. von Senden and two other gentlemen.    COLONEL.    What do they want? Pleased to see them!    [_Exit_ CARL.]    Allow me to have them shown in here, children. Senden never stays  long. He is a roving spirit.    [_The ladies rise._]    IDA.    The hour is again spoiled for us.    ADELAIDE.    Don't mind it; we shall have all the more time to dress.    [_Exeunt_ IDA _and_ ADELAIDE _on the left._]    _Enter_ SENDEN, BLUMENBERG, _a third gentleman._    SENDEN.    Colonel, we come on behalf of the committee for the approaching  election to notify you that that committee has unanimously voted to  make you, Colonel, our party's candidate.    COLONEL. _Me?_    SENDEN.    The committee begs you to accept this nomination so that the necessary  announcement can be made to the voters at this evening's fete.    COLONEL.    Are you in earnest, dear Senden? Where did the committee get such an  idea?    SENDEN.    Colonel, our president, who had previously agreed to run for our town,  found that it would be more advantageous to be candidate from a  provincial district; apart from him no one of our townsmen is so well  known and so popular with the citizens as yourself. If you accede to  our request our party is certain of victory; if you refuse, there is  every probability that our opponents will have their own way. You will  agree with us that such an eventuality must be avoided under all  circumstances.    COLONEL.    I see all that; but, on personal grounds, it is impossible for me to  help our friends in this matter.    SENDEN (_to the others_).    Let me explain to the Colonel certain things which will possibly make  him look favorably on our request.    [_Exeunt_ BLUMENBERG _and the other gentlemen into the garden, where  they are visible from time to time._]    COLONEL.    But, Senden, how could you put me in this embarrassing position! You  know that for years Oldendorf has frequented my house and that it will  be extremely unpleasant for me openly to oppose him.    SENDEN.    If the professor is really so devoted to you and your household, he  has now the best opportunity to show it. It is a foregone conclusion  that he will at once withdraw.    COLONEL.    I am not quite so sure of that; he is very stubborn in many ways.    SENDEN.    If he do not withdraw such egotism can scarcely still be called  stubbornness. And in such a case you would scarcely be under  obligations to him; obligations, Colonel, which might work injury to  the whole country. Besides, he has no chance of being elected if you  accept, for you will defeat him by a majority not large but sure.    COLONEL.    Are we so perfectly certain of this majority!    SENDEN.    I think I can guarantee it. Blumenberg and the other gentlemen have  made very thorough inquiries.    COLONEL.    It would serve the professor quite right if he had to withdraw in my  favor.--But no--no; it will not do at all, my friend.    SENDEN.    We know, Colonel, what a sacrifice we are asking of you, and that  nothing could compensate you for it save the consciousness of having  done your country a great service.    COLONEL.    To be sure.    SENDEN.    It would be so regarded in the capital, too, and I am convinced that  your entering the House would also cause pleasure in other circles  than those of your numerous friends and admirers.    COLONEL.    I should meet there many old friends and comrades. (_Aside_.) I should  be presented at Court.    SENDEN.    The minister of war asked very warmly after you the other day; he too  must have been one of your companions in arms.    COLONEL.    Yes indeed! As young blades we served in the same company and played  many mad pranks together. It would be a pleasure to see him now in the  House, drawing his honest face into dark lines. He was a wild devil in  the regiment, but a fine boy.    SENDEN.    Nor will he be the only one to receive you with open arms.    COLONEL.    In any case, I should have to think the matter over.    SENDEN.    Don't be angry, Colonel, if I urge you to decide. This evening we have  to introduce their candidate to our citizen guests. It is high time,  or all is lost.    COLONEL (_hesitating_).    Senden, you put a knife to my throat!    [SENDEN, _from the door, motions the gentlemen in the garden to come  in_.]    BLUMENBERG.    We venture to urge you, knowing that so good a soldier as you,  Colonel, makes up his mind quickly.    COLONEL (_after struggling inwardly_).    Well, so be it, gentlemen, I accept! Tell the committee I appreciate  their confidence. This evening we will talk over details.    BLUMENBERG.    We thank you, Colonel. The whole town will be rejoiced to hear of your  decision.    COLONEL.    Good-by until this evening.    [_Exeunt the visitors_;    COLONEL _alone, thoughtfully_.]    I fear I ought not to have accepted so quickly; but I had to do the  minister of war that favor. What will the girls say to it? And  Oldendorf?    [_Enter_ OLDENDORF.]    There he is himself.    [_Clears his throat_.]    He will be astonished. I can't help it, he must withdraw. Good  morning, Professor, you come just at the right moment.    OLDENDORF (_hastily_).    Colonel, there is a report in town that Mr. von Senden's party have  put you up as their candidate. I ask for your own assurance that you  would not accept such a nomination.    COLONEL.    And, supposing the proposition had been made to me, why should I not  accept as well as you? Yes, rather than you; for the motives that  would determine me are sounder than your reasons.    OLDENDORF.    So there is some foundation then to the rumor?    COLONEL.    To be frank, it is the truth. I have accepted. You see in me your  opponent.    OLDENDORF.    Nothing so bad has yet occurred to trouble our relations. Colonel,  could not the memory of a friendship, hearty and undisturbed for  years, induce you to avoid this odious conflict?    COLONEL.    Oldendorf, I could not act otherwise, believe me. It is your place now  to remember our old friendship. You are a younger man, let alone other  relationships; you are the one now to withdraw.    OLDENDORF (_more excitedly_).    Colonel, I have known you for years. I know how keenly and how deeply  you feel things and how little your ardent disposition fits you to  bear the petty vexations of current politics, the wearing struggle of  debates. Oh, my worthy friend, do listen to my exhortations and take  back your consent.    COLONEL.    Let that be my concern. I am an old block of hard timber. Think of  yourself, dear Oldendorf. You are young, you have fame as a scholar;  your learning assures you every success. Why, in another sphere of  activity, do you seek to exchange honor and recognition for naught but  hatred, mockery, and humiliation? For with such views as yours you  cannot fail to harvest them. Think it over. Be sensible, and withdraw.    OLDENDORF.    Colonel, could I follow my own inclinations I should do so on the  spot. But in this contest I am under obligations to my friends. I  cannot withdraw now.    COLONEL (_excitedly_).    Nor can I withdraw, lest I harm the good cause. We are no further now  than in the beginning. (_Aside_.) Obstinate fellow!    [_Both walk up and down on opposite sides of the stage._]    You have not the least chance whatever of being elected, Oldendorf; my  friends are sure of having the majority of the votes. You are exposing  yourself to a public defeat. (_Kindly_.) I should dislike having you  of all people beaten by me; it will cause gossip and scandal. Just  think of it! It is perfectly useless for you to conjure up the  conflict.    OLDENDORF.    Even if it were such a foregone conclusion as you assume, Colonel, I  should still have to hold out to the end. But as far as I can judge  the general sentiment, the result is by no means so certain. And  think, Colonel, if you should happen to be defeated--    COLONEL (_irritated_).    I tell you, that will not be the case.    OLDENDORF.    But if it should be? How odious that would be for both of us! How  would you feel toward me then! I might"]]]
