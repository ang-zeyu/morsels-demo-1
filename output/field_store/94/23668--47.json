Indeed his father-in-law swore with many oaths that  if it were not in its proper place by eight o'clock next morning Jack's  life should be forfeit.    Now this, of course, was exactly what Jack had wanted and intended from  the beginning; because when death was nigh he could open the golden  snuff-box and order about the little red men. But he had opened it so  often of late and they had become so cross that he was in a stew what to  do; whether to give them time to show their temper, or to hustle them  out of it. At last he decided to do half and half. So just as the hands  of the clock were at five minutes to eight he opened the box, and  stopped his ears!    Well! you never heard such a yawning, and scolding, and threatening, and  blustering. What did he mean by it? Why should he take four bites at one  cherry? If he was always in fear of death why didn't he die and have  done with it?    In the midst of all this the tower clock began to whirr--    \"Gentlemen!\" says Jack--he was really quaking with fear--\"do as you are  told.\"    \"For the last time,\" they shrieked. \"We won't stay and serve a master  who thinks he is going to die every day.\"    And with that they flew out of the window.                        _AND THEY NEVER CAME BACK._    The golden snuff-box remained empty for evermore.    But when Jack looked out of window there was the Castle in the middle of  the lake on its twelve golden pillars, and there was his young wife ever  so pretty and gay in her nightcap looking out of the window too.    So they lived happily ever after.          TATTERCOATS      In a great Palace by the sea there once dwelt a very rich old lord, who  had neither wife nor children living, only one little granddaughter,  whose face he had never seen in all her life. He hated her bitterly,  because at her birth his favourite daughter died; and when the old nurse  brought him the baby he swore that it might live or die as it liked, but  he would never look on its face as long as it lived.    So he turned his back, and sat by his window looking out over the sea,  and weeping great tears for his lost daughter, till his white hair and  beard grew down over his shoulders and twined round his chair and crept  into the chinks of the floor, and his tears, dropping on to the  window-ledge, wore a channel through the stone, and ran away in a little  river to the great sea. Meanwhile, his granddaughter grew up with no one  to care for her, or clothe her; only the old nurse, when no one was by,  would sometimes give her a dish of scraps from the kitchen, or a torn  petticoat from the rag-bag; while the other servants of the palace would  drive her from the house with blows and mocking words, calling her  \"Tattercoats,\" and pointing to her bare feet and shoulders, till she ran  away, crying, to hide among the bushes.    So she grew up, with little to eat or to wear, spending her days out of  doors, her only companion a crippled gooseherd, who fed his flock of  geese on the common. And this gooseherd was a queer, merry little chap,  and when she was hungry, or cold, or tired, he would play to her so  gaily on his little pipe, that she forgot all her troubles, and would  fall to dancing with his flock of noisy geese for partners.    Now one day people told each other that the King was travelling through  the land, and was to give a great ball to all the lords and ladies of  the country in the town near by, and that the Prince, his only son, was  to choose a wife from amongst the maidens in the company. In due time  one of the royal invitations to the ball was brought to the Palace by  the sea, and the servants carried it up to the old lord, who still sat  by his window, wrapped in his long white hair and weeping into the  little river that was fed by his tears.    But when he heard the King's command, he dried his eyes and bade them  bring shears to cut him loose, for his hair had bound him a fast  prisoner, and he could not move. And then he sent them for rich clothes,  and jewels, which he put on; and he ordered them to saddle the white  horse, with gold and silk, that he might ride to meet the King; but he  quite forgot he had a granddaughter to take to the ball.    Meanwhile Tattercoats sat by the kitchen-door weeping, because she could  not go to see the grand doings. And when the old nurse heard her crying  she went to the Lord of the Palace, and begged him to take his  granddaughter with him to the King's ball.    But he only frowned and told her to be silent; while the servants  laughed and said, \"Tattercoats is happy in her rags, playing with the  gooseherd! Let her be--it is all she is fit for.\"    A second, and then a third time, the old nurse begged him to let the  girl go with him, but she was answered only by black looks and fierce  words, till she was driven from the room by the jeering servants, with  blows and mocking words.    Weeping over her ill-success, the old nurse went to look for  Tattercoats; but the girl had been turned from the door by the cook, and  had run away to tell her friend the gooseherd how unhappy she was  because she could not go to the King's ball.    Now when the gooseherd had listened to her story, he bade her cheer up,  and proposed that they should go together into the town to see the King,  and all the fine things; and when she looked sorrowfully down at her  rags and bare feet he played a note or two upon his pipe, so gay and  merry, that she forgot all about her tears and her troubles, and before  she well knew, the gooseherd had taken her by the hand, and she and he,  and the geese before them, were dancing down the road towards the town.    \"Even cripples can dance when they choose,\" said the gooseherd.    Before they had gone very far a handsome young man, splendidly dressed,  riding up, stopped to ask the way to the castle where the King was  staying, and when he found that they too were going thither, he got off  his horse and walked beside them along the road.    \"You seem merry folk,\" he said, \"and will be good company.\"    \"Good company, indeed,\" said the gooseherd, and played a new tune that  was not a dance.    It was a curious tune, and it made the strange young man stare and stare  and stare at Tattercoats till he couldn't see her rags--till he  couldn't, to tell the truth, see anything but her beautiful face.    Then he said, \"You are the most beautiful maiden in the world. Will you  marry me?\"    Then the gooseherd smiled to himself, and played sweeter than ever.    But Tattercoats laughed. \"Not I,\" said she; \"you would be finely put to  shame, and so would I be, if you took a goose-girl for your wife! Go and  ask one of the great ladies you will see to-night at the King's ball,  and do not flout poor Tattercoats.\"    But the more she refused him the sweeter the pipe played, and the deeper  the young man fell in love; till at last he begged her to come that  night at twelve to the King's ball, just as she was, with the gooseherd  and his geese, in her torn petticoat and bare feet, and see if he  wouldn't dance with her before the King and the lords and ladies, and  present her to them all, as his dear and honoured bride.    [Illustration: Tattercoats dancing while the gooseherd pipes]    Now at first Tattercoats said she would not; but the gooseherd said,  \"Take fortune when it comes, little one.\"    So when night came, and the hall in the castle was full of light and  music, and the lords and ladies were dancing before the King, just as  the clock struck twelve, Tattercoats and the gooseherd, followed by his  flock of noisy geese, hissing and swaying their heads, entered at the  great doors, and walked straight up the ball-room, while on either side  the ladies whispered, the lords laughed, and the King seated at the far  end stared in amazement.    But as they came in front of the throne Tattercoats' lover rose from  beside the King, and came to meet her. Taking her by the hand, he kissed  her thrice before them all, and turned to the King.    \"Father!\" he said--for it was the Prince himself--\"I have made my  choice, and here is my bride, the loveliest girl in all the land, and  the sweetest as well!\"    Before he had finished speaking, the gooseherd had put his pipe to his  lips and played a few notes that sounded like a bird singing far off in  the woods; and as he played Tattercoats' rags were changed to shining  robes sewn with glittering jewels, a golden crown lay upon her golden  hair, and the flock of geese behind her became a crowd of dainty pages,  bearing her long train.    And as the King rose to greet her as his daughter the trumpets sounded  loudly in honour of the new Princess, and the people outside in the  street said to each other:    \"Ah! now the Prince has chosen for his wife the loveliest girl in all  the land!\"    But the gooseherd was never seen again, and no one knew what became of  him; while the old lord went home once more to his Palace by the sea,  for he could not stay at Court, when he had sworn never to look on his  granddaughter's face.    So there he still sits by his window,--if you could only see him, as you  may some day--weeping more bitterly than ever. And his white hair has  bound him to the stones, and the river of his tears runs away to the  great sea.          THE THREE FEATHERS      Once upon a time there lived a girl who was wooed and married by a man  she never saw; for he came a-courting her after nightfall, and when they  were married he never came home till it was dark, and always left before  dawn.    Still he was good and kind to her, giving her everything her heart could  desire, so she was well content for a while. But, after a bit, some of  her friends, doubtless full of envy for her good"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17071"],[0,"Folk-Lore and Legends: Scotland (#8)"],[1,"litter, upon which some person seemed to  be borne.  Being a man of dauntless courage, and, as he said, impelled by  some internal impulse, he pushed his horse close to the litter, drew his  sword, laid it across the vehicle, and in a firm tone exclaimed--    \"In the name of God, release your captive.\"    The tiny troop immediately disappeared, dropping the litter on the  ground.  The laird dismounted, and found that it contained his own wife,  dressed in her bedclothes.  Wrapping his coat around her, he placed her  on the horse before him, and, having only a short distance to ride,  arrived safely at home.    Placing her in another room, under the care of an attentive friend, he  immediately went to the chamber where he had left his wife in the  morning, and there to all appearance she still lay, very sick of a fever.  She was fretful, discontented, and complained much of having been  neglected in his absence, at all of which the laird affected great  concern, and pretending much sympathy, insisted upon her rising to have  her bed made.  She said that she was unable to rise, but her husband was  peremptory, and having ordered a large wood fire to warm the room, he  lifted the impostor from the bed, and bearing her across the floor as if  to a chair, which had been previously prepared, he threw her on the fire,  from which she bounced like a sky-rocket, and went through the ceiling,  and out at the roof of the house, leaving a hole among the slates.  He  then brought in his own wife, a little recovered from her alarm, who  said, that sometime after sunset, the nurse having left her for the  purpose of preparing a little candle, a multitude of elves came in at the  window, thronging like bees from a hive.  They filled the room, and  having lifted her from the bed carried her through the window, after  which she recollected nothing further, till she saw her husband standing  over her on the Cur-hills, at the back of Carlungy.  The hole in the  roof, by which the female fairy made her escape, was mended, but could  never be kept in repair, as a tempest of wind happened always once a  year, which uncovered that particular spot, without injuring any other  part of the roof.          MICHAEL SCOTT.      In the early part of Michael Scott's life he was in the habit of  emigrating annually to the Scottish metropolis, for the purpose of being  employed in his capacity of mason.  One time as he and two companions  were journeying to the place of their destination for a similar object,  they had occasion to pass over a high hill, the name of which is not  mentioned, but which is supposed to have been one of the Grampians, and  being fatigued with climbing, they sat down to rest themselves.  They had  no sooner done so than they were warned to take to their heels by the  hissing of a large serpent, which they observed revolving itself towards  them with great velocity.  Terrified at the sight, Michael's two  companions fled, while he, on the contrary, resolved to encounter the  reptile.  The appalling monster approached Michael Scott with distended  mouth and forked tongue; and, throwing itself into a coil at his feet,  was raising its head to inflict a mortal sting, when Michael, with one  stroke of his stick, severed its body into three pieces.  Having rejoined  his affrighted comrades, they resumed their journey; and, on arriving at  the next public-house, it being late, and the travellers being weary,  they took up their quarters at it for the night.  In the course of the  night's conversation, reference was naturally made to Michael's recent  exploit with the serpent, when the landlady of the house, who was  remarkable for her \"arts,\" happened to be present.  Her curiosity  appeared much excited by the conversation; and, after making some  inquiries regarding the colour of the serpent, which she was told was  white, she offered any of them that would procure her the middle piece  such a tempting reward, as induced one of the party instantly to go for  it.  The distance was not very great; and on reaching the spot, he found  the middle and tail piece in the place where Michael left them, but the  head piece was gone.    The landlady on receiving the piece, which still vibrated with life,  seemed highly gratified at her acquisition; and, over and above the  promised reward, regaled her lodgers very plentifully with the choicest  dainties in her house.  Fired with curiosity to know the purpose for  which the serpent was intended, the wily Michael Scott was immediately  seized with a severe fit of indisposition, which caused him to prefer the  request that he might be allowed to sleep beside the fire, the warmth of  which, he affirmed, was in the highest degree beneficial to him.    Never suspecting Michael Scott's hypocrisy, and naturally supposing that  a person so severely indisposed would feel very little curiosity about  the contents of any cooking utensils which might lie around the fire, the  landlady allowed his request.  As soon as the other inmates of the house  were retired to bed, the landlady resorted to her darling occupation;  and, in his feigned state of indisposition, Michael had a favourable  opportunity of watching most scrupulously all her actions through the  keyhole of a door leading to the next apartment where she was.  He could  see the rites and ceremonies with which the serpent was put into the  oven, along with many mysterious ingredients.  After which the  unsuspicious landlady placed the dish by the fireside, where lay the  distressed traveller, to stove till the morning.    Once or twice in the course of the night the \"wife of the change-house,\"  under the pretence of inquiring for her sick lodger, and administering to  him some renovating cordials, the beneficial effects of which he  gratefully acknowledged, took occasion to dip her finger in her saucepan,  upon which the cock, perched on his roost, crowed aloud.  All Michael's  sickness could not prevent him considering very inquisitively the  landlady's cantrips, and particularly the influence of the sauce upon the  crowing of the cock.  Nor could he dissipate some inward desires he felt  to follow her example.  At the same time, he suspected that Satan had a  hand in the pie, yet he thought he would like very much to be at the  bottom of the concern; and thus his reason and his curiosity clashed  against each other for the space of several hours.  At length passion, as  is too often the case, became the conqueror.  Michael, too, dipped his  finger in the sauce, and applied it to the tip of his tongue, and  immediately the cock perched on the _spardan_ announced the circumstance  in a mournful clarion.  Instantly his mind received a new light to which  he was formerly a stranger, and the astonished dupe of a landlady now  found it her interest to admit her sagacious lodger into a knowledge of  the remainder of her secrets.    Endowed with the knowledge of \"good and evil,\" and all the \"second  sights\" that can be acquired, Michael left his lodgings in the morning,  with the philosopher's stone in his pocket.  By daily perfecting his  supernatural attainments, by new series of discoveries, he became more  than a match for Satan himself.  Having seduced some thousands of Satan's  best workmen into his employment, he trained them up so successfully to  the architective business, and inspired them with such industrious  habits, that he was more than sufficient for all the architectural work  of the empire.  To establish this assertion, we need only refer to some  remains of his workmanship still existing north of the Grampians, some of  them, stupendous bridges built by him in one short night, with no other  visible agents than two or three workmen.    On one occasion work was getting scarce, as might have been naturally  expected, and his workmen, as they were wont, flocked to his doors,  perpetually exclaiming, \"Work! work! work!\"  Continually annoyed by their  incessant entreaties, he called out to them in derision to go and make a  dry road from Fortrose to Arderseir, over the Moray Firth.  Immediately  their cry ceased, and as Scott supposed it wholly impossible for them to  execute his order, he retired to rest, laughing most heartily at the  chimerical sort of employment he had given to his industrious workmen.  Early in the morning, however, he got up and took a walk at the break of  day down to the shore to divert himself at the fruitless labours of his  zealous workmen.  But on reaching the spot, what was his astonishment to  find the formidable piece of work allotted to them only a few hours  before already nearly finished.  Seeing the great damage the commercial  class of the community would sustain from the operation, he ordered the  workmen to demolish the most part of their work; leaving, however, the  point of Fortrose to show the traveller to this day the wonderful exploit  of Michael Scott's fairies.    On being thus again thrown out of employment, their former clamour was  resumed, nor could Michael Scott, with all his sagacity, devise a plan to  keep them in innocent employment.  He at length discovered one.  \"Go,\"  says he, \"and manufacture me ropes that will carry me to the back of the  moon, of these materials--_miller's-sudds_ and sea-sand.\"  Michael Scott  here obtained rest from his active operators; for, when other work failed  them, he always despatched them to their rope manufactory.  But though  these agents could never make proper ropes of those materials, their  efforts to that effect are far from being contemptible, for some of their  ropes are seen by the sea-side to this day.    We shall close our notice of Michael Scott by reciting one anecdote of  him in the latter part of his life.    In consequence of a violent quarrel which Michael Scott once had with a  person whom he conceived to have caused him some injury, he resolved, as  the highest punishment he could inflict upon him, to send his adversary"]]]
