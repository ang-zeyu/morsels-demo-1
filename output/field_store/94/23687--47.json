Ramman       is the thunder which growls in the cloud; Nebo, Merodach,       Nera the Great (Nergal), and Ninib, denote the different       phases of the hurricane from the moment when the wind gets       up until it is at its height; the Anunnaki represent the       lightning which flashes carelessly across the heaven.

In heaven, the gods were afraid of the deluge;* they betook themselves  to flight, they clambered to the firmament of Anu; the gods, howling  like dogs, cowered upon the parapet.** Ishtar wailed like a woman  in travail; she cried out, \"the lady of life, the goddess with the  beautiful voice: 'The past returns to clay, because I have prophesied  evil before the gods! Prophesying evil before the gods, I have  counselled the attack to bring my men to nothing; and these to whom I  myself have given birth, where are they? Like the spawn of fish they  encumber the sea! 'The gods wept with her over the affair of the  Anunnaki;' the gods, in the place where they sat weeping, their lips  were closed.\" It was not pity only which made their tears to flow:  there were mixed up with it feelings of regret and fears for the future.  Mankind once destroyed, who would then make the accustomed offerings?  The inconsiderate anger of Bel, while punishing the impiety of their  creatures, had inflicted injury upon themselves. \"Six days and nights  the wind continued, the deluge and the tempest raged. The seventh day at  daybreak the storm abated; the deluge, which had carried on warfare like  an army, ceased, the sea became calm and the hurricane disappeared, the  deluge ceased. I surveyed the sea with my eyes, raising my voice; but  all mankind had returned to clay, neither fields nor woods could be  distinguished.*** I opened the hatchway and the light fell upon my face;  I sank down, I cowered, I wept, and my tears ran down my cheeks when I  beheld the world all terror and all sea. At the end of twelve days, a  point of land stood up from the waters, the ship touched the land of  Nisir:**** the mountain of Nisir stopped the ship and permitted it to  float no longer. One day, two days, the mountain of Nisir stopped the  ship and permitted it to float no longer.         * The gods enumerated above alone took part in the drama of       the Deluge: they were the confederates and emissaries of       Bel. The others were present as spectators of the disaster,       and were terrified.         ** The upper part of the mountain wall is here referred to,       upon which the heaven is supported. There was a narrow space       between the escarpment and the place upon which the vault of       the firmament rested: the Babylonian poet represented the       gods as crowded like a pack of hounds upon this parapet, and       beholding from it the outburst of the tempest and the       waters.         ***The translation is uncertain: the text refers to a legend       which has not come down to us, in which Ishtar is related to       have counselled the destruction of men.         **** The Anunnaki represent here the evil genii whom the       gods that produced the deluge had let loose, and whom       Ramman, Nebo, Merodach, Nergal, and Ninib, all the followers       of Bel, had led to the attack upon men: the other deities       shared the fears and grief of Ishtar in regard to the       ravages which these Anunnaki had brought about (cf. below,       pp. 141-143 of this History).        Three days, four days, the mountain of Nisir* stopped the ship and  permitted it to float no longer. Five days, six days, the mountain of  Nisir stopped the ship and permitted it to float no longer. The seventh  day, at dawn, I took out a dove and let it go: the dove went, turned  about, and as there was no place to alight upon, came back. I took out a  swallow and let it go: the swallow went, turned about, and as there was  no place to alight upon, came back. I took out a raven and let it go:  the raven went, and saw that the water had abated, and came near the  ship flapping its wings, croaking, and returned no more.\"  Shamashnapishtim escaped from the deluge, but he did not know whether  the divine wrath was appeased, or what would be done with him when it  became known that he still lived.** He resolved to conciliate the  gods by expiatory ceremonies. \"I sent forth the inhabitants of the ark  towards the four winds, I made an offering, I poured out a propitiatory  libation on the summit of the mountain. I set up seven and seven  vessels, and I placed there some sweet-smelling rushes, some cedar-wood,  and storax.\" He thereupon re-entered the ship to await there the effect  of his sacrifice.         * I have adopted, in the translation of this difficult       passage, the meaning suggested by Haupt, according to which       it ought to be translated, \"The field makes nothing more       than one with the mountain;\" that is to say, \"mountains and       fields are no longer distinguishable one from another.\" I       have merely substituted for mountain the version wood, piece       of land covered with trees, which Jensen has suggested.         ** The mountain of Nisir is replaced in the version of       Berossus by the Gordyaean mountains of classical geography; a       passage of Assur-nazir-pal informs us that it was situated       between the Tigris and the Great Zab, according to Delitzsch       between 35 deg. and 36 deg. N. latitude. The Assyrian-speaking       people interpreted the name as _Salvation_, and a play upon       words probably decided the placing upon its slopes the       locality where those _saved_ from the deluge landed on the       abating of the waters. Fr. Lenormant proposes to identify it       with the peak Rowandiz.    The gods, who no longer hoped for such a wind-fall, accepted the  sacrifice with a wondering joy. \"The gods sniffed up the odour, the gods  sniffed up the excellent odour, the gods gathered like flies above the  offering. \"When Ishtar, the mistress of life, came in her turn, she held  up the great amulet which Anu had made for her.\"* She was still furious  against those who had determined upon the destruction of mankind,  especially against Bel: \"These gods, I swear it on the necklace of my  neck! I will not forget them; these days I will remember, and will not  forget them for ever. Let the other gods come quickly to take part in  the offering. Bel shall have no part in the offering, for he was not  wise: but he has caused the deluge, and he has devoted my people to  destruction.\" Bel himself had not recovered his temper: \"When he arrived  in his turn and saw the ship, he remained immovable before it, and his  heart was filled with rage against the gods of heaven. 'Who is he who  has come out of it living? No man must survive the destruction!'\" The  gods had everything to fear from his anger: Ninib was eager to exculpate  himself, and to put the blame upon the right person. Ea did not disavow  his acts: \"he opened his mouth and spake; he said to Bel the warrior:  'Thou, the wisest among the gods, O warrior, why wert thou not wise, and  didst cause the deluge? The sinner, make him responsible for his sin;  the criminal, make him responsible for his crime: but be calm, and do  not cut off all; be patient, and do not drown all. What was the good of  causing the deluge? A lion had only to come to decimate the people.  What was the good of causing the deluge? A leopard had only to come to  decimate the people. What was the good of causing the deluge? Famine  had only to present itself to desolate the country. What was the good  of causing the deluge? Nera the Plague had only to come to destroy the  people. As for me, I did, not reveal the judgment of the gods: I caused  Khasisadra to dream a dream, and he became aware of the judgment of the  gods, and then he made his resolve.'\" Bel was pacified at the words of  Ea: \"he went up into the interior of the ship; he took hold of my hand  and made me go up, even me; he made my wife go up, and he pushed her to  my side; he turned our faces towards him, he placed himself between  us, and blessed us: 'Up to this time Shamashnapishtim was a man:  henceforward let Shamashnapishtim and his wife be reverenced like us,  the gods, and let Shamashnapishtim dwell afar off, at the mouth of the  seas, and he carried us away and placed us afar off, at the mouth of the  seas.'\" Another form of the legend relates that by an order of the god,  Xisuthros, before embarking, had buried in the town of Sippara all the  books in which his ancestors had set forth the sacred sciences--books  of oracles and omens, \"in which were recorded the beginning, the middle,  and the end. When he had disappeared, those of his companions who  remained on board, seeing that he did not return, went out and set off  in search of him, calling him by name. He did not show himself to them,  but a voice from heaven enjoined upon them to be devout towards the  gods, to return to Babylon and dig up the books in order that they might  be handed down to future generations; the voice also informed them that  the country in which they were was Armenia. They offered sacrifice in  turn, they regained their country on foot, they dug up the books of  Sippara and wrote many more; afterwards they refounded Babylon.\" It was  even maintained in the time of the Seleucido, that a portion of the ark  existed on one of the summits of the Gordyaean mountains.** Pilgrimages  were made to it, and the faithful scraped off the bitumen which covered  it, to make out"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17324"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 4 (of 12) (#8)"],[1,"vernment.         * Madaktu, Mataktu, the Badaka of Diodorus, situated on the       Eulaaos, between Susa and Ecbatana, has been placed by       Rawlinson near the bifurcation of the Kerkhah, either at       Paipul or near Aiwan-i-Kherkah, where there are some rather       important and ancient ruins; Billerbeck prefers to put it at       the mouth of the valley of Zal-fer, on the site at present       occupied by the citadel of Kala-i-Riza.         ** Naditu is identified by Finzi with the village of       Natanzah, near Ispahan; it ought rather to be looked for in       the neighbourhood of Sarna.         *** Til-Khumba, the Mound of Khumba, so named after one of       the principal Elamite gods, was, perhaps, situated among the       ruins of Budbar, towards the confluence of the Ab-i-Kirind       and Kerkhah, or possibly higher up in the mountain, in the       vicinity of Asmanabad.         **** Dur-Undash, Dur-Undasi, has been identified, without       absolutely conclusive reason, with the fortress of Kala-i-       Dis on the Disful-Rud.         ^ Khaidalu, Khidalu, is perhaps the present fortress of Dis-       Malkan.         ^^ The countries of Yatbur and Yamutbal extended into the       plain between the marshes of the Tigris and the mountain;       the town of Durilu was near the Yamutbal region, if not in       that country itself. Umliyash lay between the Uknu and the       Tigris.    [Illustration: 050.jpg Page Image]    The language is not represented by any idioms now spoken, and its  affinities with the Sumerian which some writers have attempted to  establish, are too uncertain to make it safe to base any theory upon  them.*         * A great part of the Susian inscriptions have been       collected by Fr. Lenormant. An attempt has been made to       identify the language in which they are written with the       Sumero-accadian, and authorities now generally agree in       considering the Arcaemenian inscriptions of the second type       as representative of its modern form. Hommel connects it       with Georgian, and includes it in a great linguistic family,       which comprises, besides these two idioms, the Hittite, the       Cappadocian, the Armenian of the Van inscriptions, and the       Cosstean. Oppert claims to have discovered on a tablet in       the British Museum a list of words belonging to one of the       idioms (probably Semitic) of Susiana, which differs alike       from the Suso-Medic and the Assyrian.    The little that we know of Elamite religion reveals to us a mysterious  world, full of strange names and vague forms. Over their hierarchy  there presided a deity who was called Shushinak (the Susian), Dimesh or  Samesh, Dagbag, As-siga, Adaene, and possibly Khumba and AEmman, whom  the Chaldaens identified with their god Ninip; his statue was concealed  in a sanctuary inaccessible to the profane, but it was dragged from  thence by Assurbanipal of Nineveh in the VIIth century B.C.* This deity  was associated with six others of the first rank, who were divided into  two triads--Shumudu, Lagamaru, Partikira; Ammankasibar, Uduran, and  Sapak: of these names, the least repellent, Ammankasibar, may possibly  be the Memnon of the Greeks. The dwelling of these divinities was near  Susa, in the depths of a sacred forest to which the priests and kings  alone had access: their images were brought out on certain days to  receive solemn homage, and were afterwards carried back to their shrine  accompanied by a devout and reverent multitude. These deities received  a tenth of the spoil after any successful campaign--the offerings  comprising statues of the enemies' gods, valuable vases, ingots of  gold and silver, furniture, and stuffs. The Elamite armies were well  organized, and under a skilful general became irresistible. In other  respects the Elamites closely resembled the Chaldaeans, pursuing the same  industries and having the same agricultural and commercial instincts. In  the absence of any bas-reliefs and inscriptions peculiar to this people,  we may glean from the monuments of Lagash and Babylon a fair idea of the  extent of their civilization in its earliest stages.         * _Shushinak_ is an adjective derived from the name of the       town of Susa. The real name of the god was probably kept       secret and rarely uttered. The names which appear by the       side of Shushinak in the text published by H. Rawlinson, as       equivalents of the Babylonian Ninip, perhaps represent       different deities; we may well ask whether the deity may not       be the Khumba, Umma, Umman, who recurs so frequently in the       names of men and places, and who has hitherto never been met       with alone in any formula or dedicatory tablet.    The cities of the Euphrates, therefore, could have been sensible of but  little change, when the chances of war transferred them from the rule of  their native princes to that of an Elamite. The struggle once over, and  the resulting evils repaired as far as practicable, the people of these  towns resumed their usual ways, hardly conscious of the presence of  their foreign ruler. The victors, for their part, became assimilated so  rapidly with the vanquished, that at the close of a generation or so  the conquering dynasty was regarded legitimate and national one, loyally  attached to the traditions and religion of its adopted country. In the  year 2285 B.C., towards the close of the reign of Nurramman, or in  the earlier part of that of Siniddinam, a King of Elam, by name  Kudur-nakhunta, triumphantly marched through Chaldaea from end to end,  devastating the country and sparing neither town nor temple: Uruk lost  its statue of Nana, which was carried off as a trophy and placed in the  sanctuary of Susa. The inhabitants long mourned the detention of their  goddess, and a hymn of lamentation, probably composed for the occasion  by one of their priests, kept the remembrance of the disaster fresh in  their memories. \"Until when, oh lady, shall the impious enemy ravage the  country!--In thy queen-city, Uruk, the destruction is accomplished,--in  Eulbar, the temple of thy oracle, blood has flowed like water,--upon the  whole of thy lands has he poured out flame, and it is spread abroad like  smoke.--Oh, lady, verily it is hard for me to bend under the yoke of  misfortune!--? Oh, lady, thou hast wrapped me about, thou hast plunged  me, in sorrow!--The impious mighty one has broken me in pieces like a  reed,--and I know not what to resolve, I trust not in myself,--like a  bed of reeds I sigh day and night!--I, thy servant, I bow myself before  thee!\" It would appear that the whole of Chaldaea, including Babylon  itself, was forced to acknowledge the supremacy of the invader;* a  Susian empire thus absorbed Chaldaea, reducing its states to feudal  provinces, and its princes to humble vassals. Kudur-nakhunta having  departed, the people of Larsa exerted themselves to the utmost to repair  the harm that he had done, and they succeeded but too well, since their  very prosperity was the cause only a short time after of the outburst  of another storm. Siniddinam, perhaps, desired to shake off the Elamite  yoke. Simtishilkhak, one of the successors of Kudur-nakhunta, had  conceded the principality of Yamutbal as a fief to Kudur-mabug, one  of his sons. Kudur-mabug appears to have been a conqueror of no mean  ability, for he claims, in his inscriptions, the possession of the whole  of Syria.**         * The submission of Babylon is evident from the title Adda       Martu, \"sovereign of the West,\" assumed by several of the       Elamite princes (of. p. 65 of the present work): in order to       extend his authority beyond the Euphrates, it was necessary       for the King of Elam to be first of all master of Babylon.       In the early days of Assyriology it was supposed that this       period of Elamite supremacy coincided with the Median       dynasty of Berosus.         ** His preamble contains the titles _adda Martu,_ \"prince of       Syria;\" _adda lamutbal_, \"prince of Yamutbal.\" The word       _adda_ seems properly to mean \"lather,\" and the literal       translation of the full title would probably be \"father of       Syria,\" \"_father_ of Yamutbal,\" whence the secondary       meanings \"master, lord, prince,\" which have been       provisionally accepted by most Assyriologists. Tiele, and       Winckler after him, have suggested that Martu is here       equivalent to Yamutbal, and that it was merely used to       indicate the western part of Elam; Winckler afterwards       rejected this hypothesis, and has come round to the general       opinion.    He obtained a victory over Siniddinam, and having dethroned him, placed  the administration of the kingdom in the hands of his own son Eimsin.  This prince, who was at first a feudatory, afterwards associated in the  government with his father, and finally sole monarch after the  latter's death, married a princess of Chaldaean blood, and by this means  legitimatized his usurpation in the eyes of his subjects. His domain,  which lay on both sides of the Tigris and of the Euphrates, comprised,  besides the principality of Yamutbal, all the towns dependent on Sumer  and Accad--Uru, Larsa, Uruk, and Nippur, He acquitted himself as a good  sovereign in the sight of gods and men: he repaired the brickwork in the  temple of Nannar at Uru; he embellished the temple of Shamash at Larsa,  and caused two statues of copper to be cast in honour of the god; he  also rebuilt Lagash and Grirsu. The city of Uruk had been left a heap of  ruins after the withdrawal of Kudur-nakhunta: he set about the work of  restoration, constructed a sanctuary to Papsukal, raised the ziggurat of  Nana, and consecrated to the goddess an entire set of temple furniture  to replace that carried off by the Elamites. He won the adhesion of the  priests by piously augmenting their revenues, and throughout his reign  displayed remarkable energy. Documents "]]]
