[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16985"],[0,"The Proclamation of Bahá'u'lláh (#8)"],[1," Omnipotent Protector, the Self-Subsisting!'    O ye leaders of religion! Who is the man amongst you that can rival Me in  vision or insight? Where is he to be found that dareth to claim to be My  equal in utterance or wisdom? No, by My Lord, the All-Merciful! All on the  earth shall pass away; and this is the face of your Lord, the Almighty,  the Well-Beloved.    We have decreed, O people, that the highest and last end of all learning  be the recognition of Him Who is the Object of all knowledge; and yet,  behold how ye have allowed your learning to shut you out, as by a veil,  from Him Who is the Dayspring of this Light, through Whom every hidden  thing hath been revealed. Could ye but discover the source whence the  splendour of this utterance is diffused, ye would cast away the peoples of  the world and all that they possess, and would draw nigh unto this most  blessed Seat of glory.    Say: This, verily, is the heaven in which the Mother Book is treasured,  could ye but comprehend it. He it is Who hath caused the Rock to shout,  and the Burning Bush to lift up its voice, upon the Mount rising above the  Holy Land, and proclaim: 'The Kingdom is God's, the sovereign Lord of all,  the All-Powerful, the Loving!'    We have not entered any school, nor read any of your dissertations.  Incline your ears to the words of this unlettered One, wherewith He  summoneth you unto God, the Ever-Abiding. Better is this for you than all  the treasures of the earth, could ye but comprehend it.          \"O CONCOURSE of divines! When My verses were sent...\"      O CONCOURSE of divines! When My verses were sent down, and My clear tokens  were revealed, We found you behind the veils. This, verily, is a strange  thing.... We have rent the veils asunder. Beware lest ye shut out the  people by yet another veil. Pluck asunder the chains of vain imaginings,  in the name of the Lord of all men, and be not of the deceitful. Should ye  turn unto God, and embrace His Cause, spread not disorder within it, and  measure not the Book of God with your selfish desires. This, verily, is  the counsel of God aforetime and hereafter.... Had ye believed in God,  when He revealed Himself, the people would not have turned aside from Him,  nor would the things ye witness today have befallen Us. Fear God, and be  not of the heedless.... This is the Cause that hath caused all your  superstitions and idols to tremble.... O concourse of divines! Beware lest  ye be the cause of strife in the land, even as ye were the cause of the  repudiation of the Faith in its early days. Gather the people around this  Word that hath made the pebbles to cry out: 'The Kingdom is God's, the  Dawning-Place of all signs!'... Tear the veils asunder in such wise that  the inmates of the Kingdom will hear them being rent. This is the command  of God, in days gone by, and for those to come. Blessed the man that  observeth that whereunto he was bidden, and woe betide the negligent.          \"HOW long will ye, O concourse of divines, level the...\"      HOW long will ye, O concourse of divines, level the spears of hatred at  the face of Baha? Rein in your pens. Lo, the Most Sublime Pen speaketh  betwixt earth and heaven. Fear God, and follow not your desires which have  altered the face of creation. Purify your ears that they may hearken unto  the Voice of God. By God! It is even as fire that consumeth the veils, and  as water that washeth the souls of all who are in the universe.          \"O CONCOURSE of divines! Can any one of you race with...\"      O CONCOURSE of divines! Can any one of you race with the Divine Youth in  the arena of wisdom and utterance, or soar with Him into the heaven of  inner meaning and explanation? Nay, by My Lord, the God of mercy! All have  swooned away in this Day from the Word of thy Lord. They are even as dead  and lifeless, except him whom thy Lord, the Almighty, the Unconstrained,  hath willed to exempt. Such a one is indeed of those endued with knowledge  in the sight of Him Who is the All-Knowing. The inmates of Paradise, and  the dwellers of the sacred Folds, bless him at eventide and at dawn. Can  the one possessed of wooden legs resist him whose feet God hath made of  steel? Nay, by Him Who illumineth the whole of creation!          \"WHEN We observed carefully, We discovered that Our...\"      WHEN We observed carefully, We discovered that Our enemies are, for the  most part, the divines... Among the people are those who said: He hath  repudiated the divines. Say: Yea, by My Lord! I, in very truth, was the  One Who abolished the idols! We, verily, have sounded the Trumpet, which  is Our Most Sublime Pen, and lo, the divines and the learned, and the  doctors and the rulers, swooned away except such as God preserved, as a  token of His grace, and He, verily, is the All-Bounteous, the Ancient of  Days...    O concourse of divines! Fling away idle fancies and imaginings, and turn,  then, towards the Horizon of Certitude. I swear by God! All that ye  possess will profit you not, neither all the treasures of the earth, nor  the leadership ye have usurped. Fear God, and be not of the lost ones...  Say: O concourse of divines! Lay aside all your veils and coverings. Give  ear unto that whereunto calleth you the Most Sublime Pen, in this wondrous  Day.... The world is laden with dust, by reason of your vain imaginings,  and the hearts of such as enjoy near access to God are troubled because of  your cruelty. Fear God, and be of them that judge equitably.          \"O YE the dawning-places of knowledge! Beware that ye...\"      O YE the dawning-places of knowledge! Beware that ye suffer not yourselves  to become changed, for as ye change, most men will, likewise, change.  This, verily, is an injustice unto yourselves and unto others.... Ye are  even as a spring. If it be changed, so will the streams that branch out  from it be changed. Fear God, and be numbered with the godly. In like  manner, if the heart of man be corrupted, his limbs will also be  corrupted. And similarly, if the root of a tree be corrupted, its  branches, and its offshoots, and its leaves, and its fruits, will be  corrupted....    O concourse of divines! Be fair, I adjure you by God, and nullify not the  Truth with the things ye possess. Peruse that which We have sent down with  truth. It will, verily, aid you, and will draw you nigh unto God, the  Mighty, the Great. Consider and call to mind how when Muhammad, the  Apostle of God, appeared, the people denied Him. They ascribed unto Him  what caused the Spirit (Jesus) to lament in His Most Sublime Station, and  the Faithful Spirit to cry out. Consider, moreover, the things which  befell the Apostles and Messengers of God before Him, by reason of what  the hands of the unjust have wrought. We make mention of you for the sake  of God, and remind you of His signs, and announce unto you the things  ordained for such as are nigh unto Him in the most sublime Paradise and  the all-highest Heaven, and I, verily, am the Announcer, the Omniscient.  He hath come for your salvation, and hath borne tribulations that ye may  ascend, by the ladder of utterance, unto the summit of understanding....  Peruse, with fairness and justice, that which hath been sent down. It  will, verily, exalt you through the truth, and will cause you to behold  the things from which ye have been withheld, and will enable you to quaff  His sparkling Wine.          \"THOSE divines ... who are truly adorned with the ornament...\"      THOSE divines ... who are truly adorned with the ornament of knowledge and  of a goodly character are, verily, as a head to the body of the world, and  as eyes to the nations. The guidance of men hath, at all times, been and  is dependent upon these blessed souls.          \"THE divine whose conduct is upright, and the sage who...\"      THE divine whose conduct is upright, and the sage who is just, are as the  spirit unto the body of the world. Well is it with that divine whose head  is attired with the crown of justice, and whose temple is adorned with the  ornament of equity.          \"THE divine who hath seized and quaffed the most holy...\"      THE divine who hath seized and quaffed the most holy Wine, in the name of  the sovereign Ordainer, is as an eye unto the world. Well is it with them  who obey him, and call him to remembrance.          \"GREAT is the blessedness of that divine that hath not...\"      GREAT is the blessedness of that divine that hath not allowed knowledge to  become a veil between him and the One Who is the Object of all knowledge,  and who, when the Self-Subsisting appeared, hath turned with a beaming  face towards Him. He, in truth, is numbered with the learned. The inmates  of Paradise seek the blessing of his breath, and his lamp sheddeth its  radiance over all who are in heaven and on earth. He, verily, is numbered  with the inheritors of the Prophets. He that beholdeth him hath, verily,  beheld the True One, and he that turneth towards him hath, verily, turned  towards God, the Almighty, the All-Wise.          \"O CONCOURSE of divines! Ye shall not henceforth behold...\"      O CONCOURSE of divines! Ye shall not henceforth behold yourselves  possessed of any power, inasmuch as We have seized it from you, and  destined it for such as have believed in God, the One, the All-Powerful,  the Almighty, the Unconstrained.          POPE PIUS IX      O POPE! Rend the veils asunder. He Who is the Lord of Lords is come  overshadowed with clouds, and the decree hath been fulfilled by God, the  Almighty, the Unrestrained... He, verily, hath again come down from Heaven  even as He came down from it the first time. Beware that thou dispute not  with Him even as the Pharisees disputed with Him (Jesus) without a clear  token or proof. On His right hand flow the living waters of grace, and on  His left the choice Wine of justice, whilst before Him march the angels of  Paradise, bearing the banners of His signs.

Shari'at, or        Religious Laws; 2. Tariqat, or the Path on which the mystic wayfarer        journeys in search of the True One; this stage also includes        anchoretism. 3. Haqiqat, or the Truth which, to the Sufi, is the        goal of the journey through all three stages. Here Baha'u'llah        teaches that, contrary to the belief of certain Sufis who in their        search for the Truth consider themselves above all law, obedience to        the Laws of Religion is essential.       73 Maqam-i-Mahmud.

As used here        one connotation is that the Shaykh might have considered his station        as a mystic leader compromised by the fact of his being taught the        new truth by Baha'u'llah.       84 Qur'an 41:30.       85 Qur'an 11:114; 42:14.       86 Sa'di.       87 Ibid.       88 Senna, capital of Persian Kurdistan.       89 This preamble to The Four Valleys is written in the finest Persian        epistolary style.
