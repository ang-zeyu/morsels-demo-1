[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14360"],[0,"The Dawn and the Day (#8)"],[1,",    Checkered with orchards, vineyards, pastures, fields,    The vale beneath peaceful as sleeping babe,    The city nestling round the shining lake,    And near the park and palace, her sweet home.      O noble, peaceful, beautiful Cashmere!    Well named the garden of eternal spring!    But yet, with home and all its joys so near.    She often turned and strained her eager eyes    To catch one parting glimpse of that sweet spot    Where more than half of her young heart was left.      At length their horns, whose mocking echoes    Rolled from hill to hill, were answered from below,    While from the park a gay procession comes,    Increasing as it moves, to welcome her,    Light of the palace, the people's idol, home.      The prince's thoughts by day and dreams by night    Meanwhile were filled with sweet Yasodhara,    And this bright vision ever hovering near    Hid from his eyes those grim and ghastly forms,    Night-loving and light-shunning brood of sin,    That ever haunt poor fallen human lives,    And from the darkened corners of the soul    Are quick to sting each pleasure with sharp pain,    To pour some bitter in life's sweetest cup,    And shadow with despair its brightest hopes--    Made him forget how sorrow fills the world,    How strength is used to crush and not to raise,    How creeds are bandages to blind men's eyes,    Lest they should see and walk in duty's path    That leads to peace on earth and joy in heaven,    And even made him for the time forget    His noble mission to restore and save.      He sought her for his bride, but waited long,    For princes cannot wed like common folk--    Friends called, a feast prepared, some bridal gifts,    Some tears at parting and some solemn vows,    Rice scattered, slippers thrown with noisy mirth,    And common folk are joined till death shall part.    Till death shall part!  O faithless, cruel thought!    Death ne'er shall part souls joined by holy love,    Who through life's trials, joys and cares    Have to each other clung, faithful till death,    Tender and true in sickness and in health,    Bearing each other's burdens, sharing griefs,    Lightening each care and heightening every joy.    Such life is but a transient honeymoon,    A feeble foretaste of eternal joys.    But princes when they love, though all approve,    Must wait on councils, embassies and forms.    But how the coach of state lumbers and lags    With messages of love whose own light wings    Glide through all bars, outstrip all fleetest things--    No bird so light, no thought so fleet as they.      But while the prince chafed at the long delay,    The sweet Yasodhara began to feel    The bitter pangs of unrequited love.    But her young hands, busy with others' wants,    And her young heart, busy with others' woes,    With acts of kindness filled the lagging hours,    Best of all medicines for aching hearts.    Yet often she would seek a quiet nook    Deep in the park, where giant trees cross arms,    Making high gothic arches, and a shade    That noonday's fiercest rays could scarcely pierce,    And there alone with her sad heart communed:    \"Yes!  I have kept it for the giver's sake,    But he has quite forgot his love, his gift, and me.    How bright these jewels seemed warmed by his love,    But now how dull, how icy and how dead!\"    But soon the soft-eyed antelopes and fawns    And fleet gazelles came near and licked her hands;    And birds of every rich and varied plume    Gathered around and filled the air with song;    And even timid pheasants brought their broods,    For her sweet loving life had here restored    The peace and harmony of paradise;    And as they shared her bounty she was soothed    By their mute confidence and perfect trust.      But though time seems to lag, yet still it moves,    Resistless as the ocean's swelling tide,    Bearing its mighty freight of human lives    With all their joys and sorrows, hopes and fears,    Onward, forever onward, to life's goal.    At length the embassy is sent, and now,    Just as the last faint rays of rosy light    Fade from the topmost Himalayan peaks,    And tired nature sinks to quiet rest,    A horseman dashes through the silent streets    Bearing the waiting prince the welcome word    That one short journey of a single day    Divides him from the sweet Yasodhara;    And light-winged rumor spreads the joyful news,    And ere the dawn had danced from mountain-top    O'er hill and vale and plain to the sweet notes    Of nature's rich and varied orchestra,    And dried the pearly tears that night had wept,    The prince led forth his train to meet his bride,    Wondering that Kantaka, always so free,    So eager and so fleet, should seem to lag.    And in that fragrant garden's cooling shade,    Where they had parted, now again they meet,    And there we leave them reverently alone,    For art can never paint nor words describe    The peace and rest and rapture of that scene.      Meanwhile the city rings with busy stir.    The streets are swept and sprinkled with perfumes,    And when the evening shades had veiled the earth,    And heaven's blue vault was set with myriad stars,    The promised signal from the watchtower sounds,    And myriad lamps shine from each house and tree,    And merry children strew their way with flowers,    And all come forth to greet Siddartha's bride,    And welcome her, their second Maya, home.    And at the palace gate the good old king    Receives her with such loving tenderness,    As fondest mother, sick with hope deferred,    Waiting and watching for an absent child,    At length receives him in her open arms.

Perhaps these ruins may yet be found by some chance traveler in some  unexplored jungle.            BOOK III.      And now his cup with every blessing filled    Full to the brim, to overflowing full,    What more has life to give or heart to wish?    Stately in form, with every princely grace,    A very master of all manly arts,    His gentle manners making all his friends,    His young blood bounding on in healthful flow,    His broad domains rich in all earth can yield,    Guarded by nature and his people's love,    And now that deepest of all wants supplied,    The want of one to share each inmost thought,    Whose sympathy can soothe each inmost smart,    Whose presence, care and loving touch can make    The palace or the humblest cottage home,    His life seemed rounded, perfect, full, complete.    And they were happy as the days glide on,    And when at night, locked in each other's arms,    They sink to rest, heart beating close to heart,    Their thoughts all innocence and trust and love,    It almost seemed as if remorseless Time    Had backward rolled his tide, and brought again    The golden age, with all its peace and joy,    And our first parents, ere the tempter came,    Were taking sweet repose in paradise.    But as one night they slept, a troubled dream    Disturbed the prince.  He dreamed he saw one come,    As young and fair as sweet Yasodhara,    But clad in widow's weeds, and in her arms    A lifeless child, crying: \"Most mighty prince!    O bring me back my husband and my child!\"    But he could only say \"Alas! poor soul!\"    And started out of sleep he cried \"Alas!\"    Which waked the sweet Yasodhara, who asked,    \"What ails my love?\"  \"Only a troubled dream,\"    The prince replied, but still she felt him tremble,    And kissed and stroked his troubled brow,    And soothed him into quiet sleep again.    And then once more he dreamed--a pleasing dream.    He dreamed he heard strange music, soft and sweet;    He only caught its burden: \"Peace, be still!\"    And then he thought he saw far off a light,    And there a place where all was peace and rest,    And waking sighed to find it all a dream.      One day this happy couple, side by side,    Rode forth alone, Yasodhara unveiled--    \"For why,\" said she, \"should those whose thoughts are pure    Like guilty things hide from their fellow-men?\"--    Rode through the crowded streets, their only guard    The people's love, strongest and best of guards;    For many arms would spring to their defense,    While some grim tyrant, at whose stern command    A million swords would from their scabbards leap,    Cringes in terror behind bolts and bars,    Starts at each sound, and fears some hidden mine    May into atoms blow his stately towers,    Or that some hand unseen may strike him down,    And thinks that poison lurks in every cup,    While thousands are in loathsome dungeons thrust    Or pine in exile for a look or word.    And as they pass along from street to street    A sea of happy faces lines their way,    Their joyful greetings answered by the prince.    No face once seen, no name once heard, forgot,    While sweet Yasodhara was wreathed in smiles,    The kind expression of her gentle heart,    When from a little cottage by the way,    The people making room for him to pass,    There came an aged man, so very old    That time had ceased to register his years;    His step was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14366"],[0,"Argentina from a British Point of View, and Notes on Argentine Life (#8)"],[1,"its rights to the land in dispute on the  understanding that if the Company failed to establish its claim, the  Government of the Province of Santa Fe would indemnify it for its loss.  In the result the Company was evicted from the lands, and entered into  negotiations with the Government of the Province of Santa Fe for  indemnification. These negotiations went on for some years without  coming to any practical conclusion, and at last the Company commenced a  lawsuit against the Province and won it. After further delays and  negotiations the Government agreed to issue bonds in respect of the  Company's claim, and, in July, 1909, the Company agreed to accept  $3,212,000 paper Bonds of the Province, carrying interest at 3-1/2 per  cent., with an amortisation of 1/2 per cent., the coupons being  available for payment of land tax. The Government further undertook to  ratify the original titles of the Company, and to make a survey at the  joint expense of both parties, for the purpose of ascertaining the exact  area comprised in the original transfer. Any lands found to be in excess  were to be paid for by the Company to the Government at the rate of  $13.50, paper, per hectarea (about 8s. an acre). The price of such  excess lands was to be recouped by the Government from the Bonds issued  to the Company, and the Government retained $712,000 Bonds for this  purpose, pending the result of the survey.    [Illustration: _Cattle Train on Central Argentine Railway, bringing  Cattle to Barrancosa._]      RAILWAY COMMUNICATION.    At the time of the formation of the Company, the nearest railway was  that belonging to the Central Argentine Railway, and the nearest  railway station was Rosario, but some years later, the lines now  belonging to the French Railway Company of the Province of Santa Fe were  laid between Santa Fe and San Cristobal. Subsequently the Central Norte  Railway, which stretches northwards from San Cristobal to Tucuman, was  built by the National Government, and in 1907, the National Government  built a line from Santa Fe to San Cristobal _via_ San Justo.    The Company have built a railway from a point north of Vera running into  their forests, and extend it from time to time as the development of the  wood industry demands. They further own a line from Margarita to La  Gallareta, where the extract factory of the Compania Tanin de Santa Fe  is situated. The Company propose to build a railway from San Cristobal  to penetrate to their northern properties, and have applied to the  Argentine National Government for a railway concession in connection  therewith.      ADMINISTRATION.    After various changes of centre the administration offices of the  Company were, in the year 1902, divided between San Cristobal for the  cattle and lands department, and Vera for the woods department, but, in  1906, the woods department was placed under the supervision of the  General Manager of the Company, who lived at San Cristobal, and, in  1908, the central offices were moved from San Cristobal to Buenos Aires.  Through the latter office all the work of the Company in Argentina  passes on to the London office, the managers at San Cristobal, Vera,  Santa Catalina, and La Barrancosa, having to concern themselves only  with the technical and administrative work carried on under them  respectively.      COMPANY'S BUSINESS.    The Company's business has been mainly divided into three branches,  viz.: (1) land sales and rentals; (2) cattle industry, and (3) timber  trade.    The first two branches are conducted from San Cristobal, situated at the  S.W. corner of the Company's original lands, and for many years the site  of the central offices of the Company in Argentina, whilst the timber  trade is conducted from Vera.      SAN CRISTOBAL DEPARTMENT.    A township was started at San Cristobal in 1884, and now numbers 4,500  persons.    The Administration House and other buildings for the use of the General  Manager and Staff of the Cattle and Lands Department were erected about  three miles from the town, and the whole now forms a large and handsome  establishment, equipped with the most modern requisites for carrying on  the work of the estancia.    The cattle lands have been divided up into sections, which are managed  by officials of the Company, under the control of the administration at  San Cristobal. The office there and the offices on the various sections  have recently been connected up by telephone. These sections are  Polvareda, Michelot, Los Moyes, and Lucero (which lie to the North and  North-East of San Cristobal), and Las Chunas, which forms the  North-Western corner of the Company's lands.    [Illustration: _Loading Wheat at Rosario from the \"Barranca.\"_]    [Illustration: _San Cristobal Estancia House._]      SANTA CATALINA AND LA BARRANCOSA.    In January, 1897, the Company rented the estancia of Santa Catalina,  which is situated about five miles from Los Cardos on the Central  Argentine Railway and about 150 miles South of San Cristobal. Here the  stock which was brought down from San Cristobal was fattened before  passing on to the markets. At the same time the Company continued the  sowing of alfalfa which had been begun by the proprietor, and ultimately  decided to buy the camp and use it as an establishment for breeding fine  stock. The terms of the purchase were that the price should be paid by  way of an annuity, payable during the joint lifetime of the owner and  his wife. In 1909 this method of payment was compounded and satisfied in  full by an allotment of shares of the Company.    The practice has been that the male calves born on this estancia should  be sent North to the general herds kept at San Cristobal and the  adjoining sections, and that the progeny of these animals should in turn  be sold as fat cattle.    To facilitate this business the Company found it necessary to acquire a  camp specially adapted for fattening purposes in the Southern part of  the Province, so that they might be brought into closer touch with the  markets of Rosario and Buenos Aires. They accordingly bought the  estancia La Barrancosa in 1906, and have been constantly increasing the  area there under alfalfa, equipping it with a full complement of wells  and fencing. This estancia lies half way between the towns of San Isabel  and Venado Tuerto, from the latter of which it is distant about sixteen  miles. But, during the year 1909, a new broad-gauge railway line was  opened, leading from Rosario to Bahia Blanca. It passes right through  the estancia, and by means of a station just outside the boundary the  Company have fresh means of despatching their animals to Rosario.      VERA DEPARTMENT.    The headquarters of the Woods Department is situated about eight miles  N.W. of the town of Vera, which stands at kilometre 250 north of the  City of Santa Fe on the line of the French Railway Company leading from  Santa Fe to Resistencia. Sawmills and offices were built, which involved  the presence of a considerable number of work-people, for whom houses  had to be provided. Consequently, a small village has grown up at the  place.    A branch railway was begun in 1905, at a point 13 kilometres north of  Vera town, on the French Railway, to penetrate westwards into the  Company's forests, and has been extended to a point called Olmos, lying  30 miles away. Along the line two or three hamlets have sprung up, where  people connected with the wood industry reside, as well as the Company's  officials who control the timber in the neighbourhood.    In 1904 the Company entered into an agreement with Messrs. Albert and  Charles Harteneck, Frederick and Charles Portalis, and Hermann Renner,  to bring out a Company to work a factory for the manufacture of tannin  extract from the wood of the Quebracho Colorado tree, and this factory  was ultimately built within the Company's properties at a place called  La Gallareta, which is situated 17 kilometres north-west of the Station  of Margarita on the French Railway line. The Santa Fe Land Company have  also built a branch line from Margarita to this tannin factory.
