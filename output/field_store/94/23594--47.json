At length he was torn from his hold, but did not  disappear; the animal continuing on the surface crunching his prey with  his teeth, and digging at him with his jaws, as if trying to gorge a  morsel too large to be swallowed, and making the water flash up in foam  over the boats in pursuit, by the powerful strokes of his tail, but  without ever letting go his hold. The poor lad only cried once more--but  such a cry--oh, God, I never shall forget it!--and, could it be  possible, in his last shriek, his piercing expiring cry, his young voice  seemed to pronounce my name--at least so I thought at the time, and  others thought so too. The next moment he appeared quite dead. No less  than three boats had been in the water alongside when the accident  happend, and they were all on the spot by this time. And there was the  bleeding and mangled boy, torn along the surface of the water by the  shark, with the boats in pursuit, leaving a long stream of blood,  mottled with white specks of fat and marrow in his wake. At length the  man in the bow of the gig laid hold of him by the arm, another sailor  caught the other arm, boat-hooks and oars were dug into and launched at  the monster, who relinquished his prey at last, stripping off the flesh,  however, from the upper part of the right thigh, until his teeth reached  the knee, where he nipped the shank clean off, and made sail with the  leg in his jaws. Poor little Louis never once moved after we took him  in.--I thought I heard a small, still, stern voice thrill along my  nerves, as if an echo of the beating of my heart had become articulate.  \"Thomas, a fortnight ago, you impressed that poor boy, who _was_,  and _now is not_, out of a Bristol ship.\" Alas, conscience spoke no  more than the truth.    Our instructions were to lie at St. Jago, until three British ships,  then loading, were ready for sea, and then to convey them through the  Caicos, or windward passage. As our stay was therefore likely to be ten  days or a fortnight at the shortest, the boats were hoisted out, and  we made our little arrangements and preparations for taking all the  recreation in our power, and our worthy skipper, taught and stiff as he  was at sea, always encouraged all kinds of fun and larking, both amongst  the men and the officers on occasions like the present. Amongst his  other pleasant qualities, he was a great boat-racer, constantly building  and altering gigs, and pulling-boats, at his own expense, and matching  the men against each other for small prizes. He had just finished  what the old carpenter considered his _chef-d'oeuvre_, and a curious  affair this same masterpiece was. In the first place it was forty-two  feet long over all, and only three and a half feet beam--the planking  was not much above an eighth of an inch in thickness, so that if one  of the crew had slipped his foot off the stretcher, it must have gone  through the bottom. There was a standing order that no man was to go  into it with shoes on. She was to pull six oars, and her crew were the  captains of the tops, the primest seamen in the ship, and the steersman  no less a character than the skipper himself.    Her name, for I love to be particular, was the Dragon-fly; she was  painted out and in of a bright red, amounting to a flame colour--oars  red--the men wearing trousers and shirts of red flannel, and red net  night caps--which common uniform the captain himself wore, I think I  have said before, that he was a very handsome man, and when he had taken  his seat, and the _gigs_, all fine men, were seated each with his oar  held upright upon his knees ready to be dropped into the water at the  same instant, the craft and her crew formed to my eye as pretty a  plaything for grown children as ever was seen. \"Give way, men,\" the  oars dipped as clean as so many knives, without a sparkle, the gallant  fellows stretched out, and away shot the Dragon-fly, like an arrow, the  green water foaming into white smoke at the bows, and hissing away in  her wake.    She disappeared in a twinkling round a reach of the canal where we were  anchored, and we, that is the gunroom-officers, all except the second  lieutenant, who had the watch, and the master, now got into our own gig  also, rowed by ourselves, and away we all went in a covey; the purser  and doctor, and three of the middies forward, Thomas Cringle, gent.,  pulling the stroke oar, with old Moses Yerk as coxswain;--and as  the Dragon-flies were all red, so we were all sea-green, boat,  oars, trousers, shirts, and night-caps. The strain was between the  _Devil's Darning Needle_ and our boat, the _Watersprite_, which was  making capital play, for although we had not the _bottom_ of the  _top_men, yet we had more blood, so to speak, and we had already  beaten them, in their last gig, all to sticks. But the Dragon-fly was  a new boat, and now in the water for the first time. * * *    We were both of us so intent on our own match, that we lost sight of  the Spaniard altogether, and the captain and the first lieutenant were  bobbing in the sternsheets of their respective gigs like a couple of  _souple Tams_, as intent on the game as if all our lives had  depended on it, when in an instant the long, black, dirty prow of the  canoe was thrust in between us, the old Don singing out, \"_Dexa mi  lugar, paysanos, dexa mi lugar, mis hijos._\"[12] We kept away right  and left, to look at the miracle; and there lay the canoe, rumbling and  splashing, with her crew walloping about, and grinning and yelling like  incarnate fiends, and as naked as the day they were born, and the old  Don himself, so staid and sedate, and drawley as he was a minute before,  now all alive, shouting, \"_Tira, diablitos, tira_,\"[13] flourishing  a small paddle, with which he steered, about his head like a wheel, and  dancing and jumping about in his seat, as if his bottom had been a  _haggis_ with quicksilver in it.    \"Zounds,\" roared the skipper,--\"why, topmen--why gentlemen, give way for  the honour of the ship--Gentlemen, stretch out--Men, pull like devils;  twenty pounds if you beat him.\"    It was now the evening, near night-fall. A splendid scene burst upon  our view, on rounding a precipitous rock, from the crevices of which  some magnificent trees shot up--their gnarled trunks and twisted  branches overhanging the canal where we were pulling, and anticipating  the fast falling darkness that was creeping over the fair face of  nature; and there we floated, in the deep shadow of the cliff and  trees--Dragon-flies and Water-sprites, motionless and silent, and the  boats floating so lightly that they scarcely seemed to touch the water,  the men resting on their oars, and all of us wrapped with the  magnificence of the scenery around us, beneath us, and above us.    The left or western bank of the narrow entrance to the harbour, from  which we were now debouching, ran out in all its precipitousness and  beauty, (with its dark evergreen bushes overshadowing the deep blue  waters, and its gigantic trees shooting forth high into the glowing  western sky, their topmost branches gold-tipped in the flood of radiance  shed by the rapidly sinking sun, while all below where we lay was grey  cold shade,) until it joined the northern shore, when it sloped away  gradually towards the east; the higher parts of the town sparkling in  the evening sun, on this dun ridge, like a golden tower on the back  of an elephant, while the houses that were in the shade covered the  declivity, until it sank down to the water's edge. On the right hand the  haven opened boldly out into a basin about four miles broad by seven  long, in which the placid waters spread out beyond the shadow of the  western bank into one vast sheet of molten gold, with the canoe tearing  along the shining surface, her side glancing in the sun, and her paddles  flashing back his rays, and leaving a long train of living fire  sparkling in her wake.--It was now about six o'clock in the evening; the  sun had set to us, as we pulled along under the frowning brow of the  cliff, where the birds were fast settling on their nightly perches, with  small happy twitterings, and the lizards and numberless other chirping  things began to send forth their evening hymn to the great Being who  made them and us, and a solitary white-sailing owl would every now and  then flit spectrelike from one green tuft, across the bald face of the  cliff, to another, and the small divers around us were breaking up the  black surface of the waters into little sparkling circles as they fished  for their suppers. All was becoming brown and indistinct near us; but  the level beams of the setting sun still lingered with a golden radiance  upon the lovely city, and the shipping at anchor before it, making their  sails, where loosed to dry, glance like leaves of gold, and their spars,  and masts, and rigging like wires of gold, and gilding their flags,  which were waving majestically and slow from the peaks in the evening  breeze; and the Moorish-looking steeples of the churches were yet  sparkling in the glorious blaze, which was gradually deepening into  gorgeous crimson, while the large pillars of the cathedral, then  building on the highest part of the ridge, stood out like brazen  monuments, softening even as we looked into a Stonehenge of amethysts.    We had not pulled fifty yards, when we heard the distant rattle of the  muskets of the sentries at the gangways, as they discharged them at  sundown, and were remarking, as we were rowing "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15540"],[0,"Across India; Or, Live Boys in the Far East (#8)"],[1,"boats. Those from the Blanche had noticed this fact, and were  pulling in that direction. Mr. Boulong had directed his boat, after taking  in Dr. Ferrolan, as the Hindu called him, to the person the farthest to the  eastward, leaving the others to be saved by the boats nearer to them.    It is enough to say that all the wrecked party were saved, without giving  the details of the picking up of each of them. The vessel in which they had  foundered had entirely disappeared, and nothing was seen belonging to her.  Against the head sea all the boats pulled back to the two steamers. The  first cutter of the Guardian-Mother had saved three, the second three, and  the two boats of the Blanche had picked up five.    \"Now give three cheers, Mr. Scott,\" said Louis Belgrave in a low tone, as  the second cutter, ahead of the first on the return, approached the ship.  \"The captain will understand from that we have saved all the party.\"    Scott approved the suggestion, and the cheers were given with a will, and  repeated by the crew of the first cutter, not far behind. They were  returned from the ship; and the voices included those who belonged in the  cabin, as well as the officers, seamen, and waiters, while the ladies,  clinging to the rails of the promenade, vigorously waved their  handkerchiefs, as the sun rose clear from the eastern waves, though it soon  disappeared in the clouds. It was evident to the officers that the gale was  breaking; or perhaps, as the commander put it, the ship was running out of  it.    Each of the boats got under the lee in turn; the falls were hooked on, and  both cutters were hoisted up to their davits, as they had come from the  scene of their exploits. Mr. Gaskette was directed to get the ship on her  course again; and Captain Ringgold went aft to welcome the shipwrecked  mariners, or whatever they were.    The seamen assisted the dripping passengers to the deck; and the masculine  tenants of the state-cabin crept along the life-lines to take part in the  scene, or at least to witness it. As the steamer was headed to the  eastward, the second cutter was the first to be hoisted up. The first  person to be assisted to the deck was Lord Tremlyn, though those who had  saved him were not yet aware of his quality. The commander extended his  hand to him, and it was cordially grasped.    \"I congratulate you, sir, on your escape from the wreck of your ship,\" said  he. \"I thank God most earnestly that we have been able to save all your  party. I hope none were lost before we made you out on the wreck.\"    \"Not one, Captain; and I join with you in reverent gratitude to Him who  rules the sea in calm and storm, for our preservation from certain death,  which would have been our fate, one and all, but for the care and skill  with which you have worked out our salvation. I thank you and the brave and  noble officers and crews of your boats with all my mind and heart. I speak  not for myself alone, but for all the ship's company of the Travancore, now  gone to the bottom,\" replied Lord Tremlyn, again grasping the hand of the  commander.    In a short time the saved from the first cutter joined the others on the  promenade deck, and the Guardian-Mother proceeded on her course to Bombay.    \"Were you the captain of the Travancore, sir?\" asked the commander.    \"I am only an amateur sailor,\" said his lordship; \"but I was in command of  the unfortunate vessel, which was a steam-yacht of small dimensions, in the  service of the Indian government. Ah, Dr. Ferrolan,\" he continued as those  from the first cutter crossed the deck; and he grasped the hand of the  person addressed, \"let us thank God first, and then the commander of this  ship, that we have been preserved,--all the ship's company, I am informed.\"    \"I join you most heartily, my Lord,\" replied the doctor. \"Captain----\"    \"Captain Ringgold,\" prompted Mr. Boulong, by whose boat he had been saved.    \"Captain Ringgold, I am your debtor for life;\" and he proceeded to express  his obligations more at length. \"Permit me to present to you Lord Tremlyn,  a gentleman who came to India on semi-official business.\"    \"I am happy to know you, Lord Tremlyn,\" replied the commander; but the  title did not appear to make a very profound impression upon him.    \"Captain Ringgold, allow me to introduce my particular friend, Sir Modava  Rao, a gentleman high in the favor of the Indian government, and I may add  of all the native princes.\"    \"I am very happy to make your acquaintance, Sir Modava,\" replied the  commander, taking his dusky hand.    The captain then invited the two titled gentlemen and the doctor of the  party to the cabin, while the two engineers were turned over to Mr.  Sentrick, the chief engineer.                                           CHAPTER VI                        THE GENERAL INTRODUCTION IN THE CABIN      It was still early in the morning, and the cabin party were not disposed to  remain any longer on the promenade deck; for it was almost impossible for  some of them to stand up, even with the aid of the life-lines and the  rails, and all of them retreated to the boudoir and music-room. None of  them had been introduced to the strangers; for they had asked to be  excused, as they were not in a presentable condition.    The trio of distinguished individuals who had been conducted to the main  cabin by the commander were of course soaked with water, and chilled after  remaining so long in their involuntary bath; and for this reason no  questions were asked of them to bring out an explanation of the cause of  the disaster of which they had been the victims. There were three vacant  state-rooms, to which they were assigned, and each of them had a bathroom  connected with it. The two cabin stewards had already been ordered to  prepare these rooms for the occupancy of the newcomers. Warm baths were  ready for them when they took possession of the apartments.    \"All this is more luxurious than we have been accustomed to lately,\" said  Lord Tremlyn, when the commander ushered him into No. 11, which was  provided with everything belonging to a suite of rooms in the best hotels  of the United States.    \"I hope you will be able to make yourself comfortable, sir; but your  greatest need at the present moment appears to be dry clothing, when you  have restored your limbs to their normal condition in the bath, and I will  endeavor to supply this want,\" replied the commander.    \"You are very kind, Captain Ringgold, and I shall never cease to be  grateful to you for the service you have rendered to me and my companions;  for all of us would have perished when the wreck of our steamer went down,  without the prompt assistance you rendered to us,\" said the principal  personage of the party, who was still shivering under the influence of the  chill he had received in the cold waters of the sea.    The captain retired, closing the door of the room. He went to No. 12, to  which Sir Modava Rao had been shown, and then to No. 13, which had been  appropriated to Dr. Ferrolan. He assured both of them that dry clothing  would be provided for them, and both of them stammered forth their  obligations very profusely from between their chattering teeth. The doors  were closed upon them after they had been instructed to call upon the  stewards outside for anything they needed.    The commander had taken the measure of the trio, and knew where to apply  for the clothing needed. The surgeon of the party was about the size of Mr.  Sage, the chief steward of the ship; and he was asked to supply a full  suit, including undergarments, shirt, socks, collar, and cravat. His  lordship was about the size of Mr. Woolridge, who was more than happy to  provide for the needs of this gentleman. Professor Giroud was a rather  slender person; and from his wardrobe came the suit and other furnishings  for the titled Hindu. The clothing of each person was placed on a stool at  the door of his room, and he was notified where to obtain it.    \"Mr. Sage, you understand by this time that we have sixteen places to be  taken at the table,\" said Captain Ringgold to the chief steward.    \"I think I had better set two tables, for sixteen would be rather crowded  in the space we use now,\" replied Mr. Sage, who was a Napoleon in his  calling. \"I propose to arrange them as they were at the big dinner you gave  at Aden.\"    \"And while you are about it you may arrange for nineteen places at the  tables,\" replied the captain; but he did not explain who were to occupy the  three he had added to the number.    The commander went to his private cabin, after he had visited the  pilot-house, and made a diagram of the two tables, assigning places to each  of the party and the guests, but leaving three of the end places vacant. He  showed it to Louis and Mrs. Belgrave, and they made no objection to the new  arrangement. It was handed to the chief steward, who put a card with the  name of the occupant of each seat on the plate in front of it. The  revolving chairs at the tables had to be all changed, and more added to it;  and Stevens the carpenter, with his assistants from the crew, were busy for  an hour making the change.    When the commander visited the music-room, he was unable to answer any of  the questions of his passengers as to the details of the wreck of the  Travancore, though he gave the names and quality of the three gentlemen who  had been invited to go below. The sleepers in the cabin had been aroused by  the erratic movements of the steamer before daylight, especially by the  change from rolling to pitching. There was a thundering roar of escaping  steam at times, and all of them had \"turned out\" to ascertain the cause of  the commotion. Felix and Morris had been the first to go on deck, and they  had informed the others of the nature of the event which had caused the  commotion on board.    The regular passengers had seen the strangers as they came down to the  promenade deck from "]]]
