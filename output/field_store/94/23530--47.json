Taking the word      in the sense of \"strike,\" or \"producing a ringing sound,\"      another Rabbi tells us that the hairs of Samson's head stood      upright, tinkling one against another like bells, the jingle of      which might be heard from Zoreah to Eshtaol. The version in the      text takes the same word in the sense of to \"strike together.\"    On the day when Isaac was weaned, Abraham made a great feast, to which  he invited all the people of the land. Not all of those who came to  enjoy the feast believed in the alleged occasion of its celebration, for  some said contemptuously, \"This old couple have adopted a foundling, and  provided a feast to persuade us to believe that the child is their own  offspring.\" What did Abraham do? He invited all the great men of the  day, and Sarah invited their wives, who brought their infants, but not  their nurses, along with them. On this occasion Sarah's breasts became  like two fountains, for she supplied, of her own body, nourishment to  all the children. Still some were unconvinced, and said, \"Shall a child  be born to one that is a hundred years old, and shall Sarah, who is  ninety years old, bear?\" (Gen. xvii. 17.) Whereupon, to silence this  objection, Isaac's face was changed, so that it became the very picture  of Abraham's; then one and all exclaimed, \"Abraham begat Isaac.\"    _Bara Metzia_, fol. 87, col. 1.    Rava relates the following in the name of Rabbi Yochanan:--\"Two Jewish  slaves were one day walking along, when their master, who was following,  overheard the one saying to the other, 'There is a camel ahead of us, as  I judge--for I have not seen--that is blind of one eye and laden with  two skin-bottles, one of which contains wine and the other oil, while  two drivers attend it, one of them an Israelite, and the other a  Gentile.' 'You perverse men,' said their master, 'how can you fabricate  such a story as that?' The slave answered, and gave this as his reason,  'The grass is cropped only on one side of the track, the wine, that must  have dripped, has soaked into the earth on the right, and the oil has  trickled down, and may be seen on the left; while one of the drivers  turned aside from the track to ease himself, but the other has not even  left the road for the purpose.' Upon this the master stepped on before  them in order to verify the correctness of their inferences, and found  the conclusion true in every particular. He then turned back, and ...  after complimenting the two slaves for their shrewdness, he at once gave  them their liberty.\"    _Sanhedrin_, fol. 104, col. 2.    When the disciples of Shamai and Hillel increased in Israel, contention  increased along with them, so much so, that the one law became as two  laws (and these contradictory).    _Soteh_, fol. 47, col. 2.    If two parties deposit money with a third, one a single manah and the  other two hundred, and both afterward appear and claim the larger sum,  the depositary should give each depositor one manah only, and leave the  rest undivided till the coming of Elijah.    _Bava Metzia_, fol. 37, col. 2.        \"Till Elijah comes\" is a phrase which is in use among the Jews      to express postponement forever, like _ad Kalendas Graecas_. It      is applied to questions that would take Elijah to settle, which,      it is believed, he will not appear to do till doomsday.    \"And I will make thy windows of agates\" (Isa. liv. 12). Two of the  angels in heaven, Gabriel and Michael, once disputed about this: one  maintained that the stone should be an onyx, and the other asserted it  should be a jasper; but the Holy One--blessed be He!--said unto them,  \"Let it be as both say, which, in Hebrew, abbreviated, is an agate.\"    _Bava Bathra_, fol. 75, col. 1.    \"The horseleech has two daughters, crying, Give! give!\" (Prov. xxx. 15.)  Mar Ukva says, \"This has reference to the voice of two daughters crying  out from torture in hell, because their voice is heard in this world  crying, 'Give! give!'--namely--heresy and officialism.\"    _Avodah Zarah_, fol. 17, col. 1.        Rashi says heresy here refers to the \"heresy of James,\" or, in      other words, Christianity.    Two cemeteries were provided by the judicial authorities, one for  beheaded and strangled criminals, and the other for those that were  stoned or burned. When the flesh of these was consumed, they collected  the bones and buried them in their own place, after which the relations  came and saluted the judge and the witnesses, and said, \"We owe you no  grudge, for you passed a just judgment.\"    _Sanhedrin_, fol. 46, col. 1.    Alas! for the loss which the world has sustained in the degradation of  the helpful serpent. If the serpent had not been degraded, every  Israelite would have been attended by two of kindly disposition, one of  which might have been sent to the north, and the other to the south, to  bring for its owner precious corals and costly stones and pearls.    _Sanhedrin_, fol. 59, col. 2.    Here are two or three other sayings from the Talmud relative to the  serpent.    Benjamin the son of Jacob, Amram the father of Moses, and Jesse the  father of David all died, not because of their own sin (for they had  none, says Rashi), but because of the (original) sin committed under the  serpent's temptation.    _Shabbath_, fol. 55, col. 2.    No man was ever injured by a serpent or scorpion in Jerusalem.    _Yoma_, fol. 21, col. 1.    \"And dust is the serpent's food\" (Isa. lxv. 25). Rav Ammi says, \"To the  serpent no delicacy in the world has any other flavor than that of  dust;\" and Rav Assi says, \"No delicacy in the world satisfies him like  dust.\"    Ibid., fol. 75, col. 1.    Two negatives or two affirmatives are as good as an oath.    _Shevuoth_, fol. 36, col. 1.    Like two pearls were the two drops of holy oil that were suspended from  the two corners of the beard of Aaron.    _Horayoth_, fol. 12, col. 1.    For two to sit together and have no discourse about the law, is to sit  in the seat of the scornful; as it is said (Ps. i. I), \"And sitteth not  in the seat of the scornful.\"    _Avoth_, chap. iii.    When two are seated together at table, the younger shall not partake  before the elder, otherwise the younger shall be justly accounted a  glutton.    _Derech Eretz_, chap. vii.    Philemo once asked Rabbi (the Holy), \"If a man has two heads, on which  is he to put the phylactery?\" To which Rabbi replied, \"Either get up and  be off, or take an anathema; for thou art making fun of me.\"    _Menachoth_, fol. 37, col. 1.    It is thus Rav Yoseph taught what is meant when it is written in Isaiah  xii. I, \"I will praise Thee, O Lord, because Thou wast angry with me:  Thine anger will depart and Thou wilt comfort me.\" \"The text applies,\"  he says, \"to two men who were going abroad on a mercantile enterprise,  one of whom, having had a thorn run into his foot, had to forego his  intended journey, and began in consequence to utter reproaches and  blaspheme. Having afterward learned that the ship in which his companion  had sailed had sunk to the bottom of the sea, he confessed his  shortsightedness and praised God for His mercy.\"    _Niddah_, fol. 31, col. 1.    The night is divided into three watches, and at each watch the Holy  One--blessed be He!--sits and roars like a lion; as it is written (Jer.  xxv. 30), \"The Lord will roar from on high, ... roaring, He will roar  over his habitation.\" The marks by which this division of the night is  recognized are these:--In the first watch the ass brays; in the second  the dog barks; and in the third the babe is at the breast and the wife  converses with her husband.    _Berachoth_, fol. 3, col. 1.    The Rabbis have taught that there are three reasons why a person should  not enter a ruin:--1. Because he may be suspected of evil intent; 2.  Because the walls might tumble upon him; 3. And because of evil spirits  that frequent such places.    Ibid., fol. 3, col. 1.    He who three times a day repeats David's psalm of praise (Ps. cxlv.) may  be sure of an inheritance in the world to come.    Ibid., fol. 4, col. 2.    Three precious gifts were given to Israel, but none of them without a  special affliction: these three gifts were the law, the land of Israel,  and the world to come.    Ibid., fol. 5, col. 1.        These are also from the Talmud anent Israel and the Israelites.    All Israelites are princes.    _Shabbath_, fol. 57, col. 1.    All Israelites are holy.    Ibid., fol. 86, col. 1.    Happy are ye, O Israel! for every one of you, from the least to the  greatest, is a great philosopher. (_Eiruvin_, fol. 53, col. 1.) The  Machzor for Pentecost says, Israelites are as \"full of meritorious works  as a pomegranate is full of pips.\"    See also _Chaggigah_, fol. 27, col, 1.    As it is impossible for the world to be without air, so also is it  impossible for the world to be without Israel.    _Taanith_, fol. 3, col. 2.    If the ox of an Israelite bruise the ox of a Gentile, the Israelite is  exempt from paying damages; but should the ox of a Gentile bruise the ox  of an Israelite, the Gentile is bound to recompense him in full.    _Bava Kama_, fol. 38, col. 1.    When an Israelite and a Gentile have a lawsuit before thee, if thou  canst, acquit the former according to the laws of Israel, and tell the  latter such is our law; if thou canst get him off in accordance with  Gentile law, do so, and say to the plaintiff such is your law; but if he  cannot be acquitted according to either law, then bring forward adroit  pretexts and secure his acquittal. These are the words of the Rabbi  Ishmael. Rabbi Akiva says, \"No false pretext should be brought forward,  because, if found out, the name of God would be blasphemed; but if there  be no fear of that, then it may be adduced.\"    Ibid., fol. 113, col. 1.

Striped Chipmunk was so surprised that he let go of the string  and nearly fell over backward.    \"Why, Grandfather Frog, what under the sun are you doing here?\" he  shouted.    When Striped Chipmunk let go of the string, Grandfather Frog promptly  drew his feet back under the old board, but when he heard Striped  Chipmunk's voice, he slowly and painfully crawled out. He told how he  had been caught and tied by Farmer Brown's boy and finally dropped near  the old board. He told how terribly frightened he was, and how sore his  legs were. Striped Chipmunk didn't wait for him to finish. In a flash he  was at work with his sharp teeth and had cut the cruel string before  Grandfather Frog had finished his story.          XVIII    GRANDFATHER FROG HURRIES AWAY      When Striped Chipmunk cut the string that bound the long legs of  Grandfather Frog together, Grandfather Frog was so relieved that he  hardly knew what to do. Of course he thanked Striped Chipmunk over and  over again. Striped Chipmunk said that it was nothing, just nothing at  all, and that he was very glad indeed to help Grandfather Frog.    \"We folks who live out in the Great World have to help one another,\"  said Striped Chipmunk, \"because we never know when we may need help  ourselves. Now you take my advice, Grandfather Frog, and go back to the  Smiling Pool as fast as you can. The Great World is no place for an old  fellow like you, because you don't know how to take care of yourself.\"    Now when he said that, Striped Chipmunk made a great mistake. Old people  never like to be told that they are old or that they do not know all  there is to know. Grandfather Frog straightened up and tried to look  very dignified.    \"Chugarum!\" said he, \"I'd have you to know, Striped Chipmunk, that  people were coming to me for advice before you were born. It was just an  accident that Farmer Brown's boy caught me, and I'd like to see him do  it again. Yes, Sir, I'd like to see him do it again!\"    Dear me, dear me! Grandfather Frog was boasting. If he had been safe at  home in the Smiling Pool, there might have been some excuse for  boasting, but way over here in the Long Lane, not even knowing the way  back to the Smiling Pool, it was foolish, very foolish indeed. No one  knew that better than Striped Chipmunk, but he has a great deal of  respect for Grandfather Frog, and he knew too that Grandfather Frog was  feeling very much out of sorts and very much mortified to think that he  had been caught in such a scrape, so he put a hand over his mouth to  hide a smile as he said:    \"Of course he isn't going to catch you again. I know how wise and smart  you are, but you look to me very tired, and there are so many dangers  out here in the Great World that it seems to me that the very best thing  you can do is to go back to the Smiling Pool.\"    But Grandfather Frog is stubborn, you know. He had started out to see  the Great World, and he didn't want the little people of the Green  Meadows and the Green Forest to think that he was afraid. The truth is,  Grandfather Frog was more afraid of being laughed at than he was of the  dangers around him, which shows just how foolish wise people can be  sometimes. So he shook his head.    \"Chugarum!\" said he, \"I am going to see the Great World first, and then  I am going back to the Smiling Pool. Do you happen to know where there  is any water? I am very thirsty.\"    Now over on the other side of the Long Lane was a spring where Farmer  Brown's boy filled his jug with clear cold water to take with him to the  cornfield when he had to work there. Striped Chipmunk knew all about  that spring, for he had been there for a drink many times. So he told  Grandfather Frog just where the spring was and how to get to it. He even  offered to show the way, but Grandfather Frog said that he would rather  go alone.    \"Watch out, Grandfather Frog, and don't fall in, because you might not  be able to get out again,\" warned Striped Chipmunk.    Grandfather Frog looked up sharply to see if Striped Chipmunk was making  fun of him. The very idea of any one thinking that he, who had lived in  the water all his life, couldn't get out when he pleased! But Striped  Chipmunk looked really in earnest, so Grandfather Frog swallowed the  quick retort on the tip of his tongue, thanked Striped Chipmunk, and  hurried away to look for the spring, for he was very, very thirsty.  Besides, he was very, very hot, and he hurried still faster as he  thought of the cool bath he would have when he found that spring.          XIX    GRANDFATHER FROG JUMPS INTO MORE TROUBLE      Some people are heedless and run into trouble. Some people are stupid  and walk into trouble. Grandfather Frog was both heedless and stupid and  jumped into trouble. When Striped Chipmunk told him where the spring  was, it seemed to him that he couldn't wait to reach it. You see,  Grandfather Frog had spent all his life in the Smiling Pool, where he  could get a drink whenever he wanted it by just reaching over the edge  of his big green lily-pad. Whenever he was too warm, all he had to do  was to say \"Chugarum!\" and dive head first into the cool water. So he  wasn't used to going a long time without water.    Jump, jump, jump! Grandfather Frog was going as fast as ever he could  in the direction Striped Chipmunk had pointed out. Every three or four  jumps he would stop for just a wee, wee bit of rest, then off he would  go again, jump, jump, jump! And each jump was a long one. Peter Rabbit  certainly would have been envious if he could have seen those long jumps  of Grandfather Frog.    At last the ground began to grow damp. The farther he went, the damper  it grew. Presently it became fairly wet, and there was a great deal of  soft, cool, wet moss. How good it did feel to Grandfather Frog's poor  tired feet!    \"Must be I'm most there,\" said Grandfather Frog to himself, as he  scrambled up on a big mossy hummock, so as to look around. Right away he  saw a little path from the direction of the Long Lane. It led straight  past the very hummock on which Grandfather Frog was sitting, and he  noticed that where the ground was very soft and wet, old boards had been  laid down. That puzzled Grandfather Frog a great deal.    \"It's a sure enough path,\" said he. \"But what under the blue, blue sky  does any one want to spoil it for by putting those boards there?\"    You see, Grandfather Frog likes the soft wet mud, and he couldn't  understand how any one, even Farmer Brown's boy, could prefer a hard dry  path. Of course he never had worn shoes himself, so he couldn't  understand why any one should want dry feet when they could just as well  have wet ones. He was still puzzling over it when he heard a sound that  made him nearly lose his balance and tumble off the hummock. It was a  whistle, the whistle of Farmer Brown's boy! Grandfather Frog knew it  right away, because he often had heard it over by the Smiling Pool. The  whistle came from over in the Long Lane. Farmer Brown's boy had had his  dinner and was on his way back to look for Grandfather Frog where he had  been dropped.    Grandfather Frog actually grinned as he thought how surprised Farmer  Brown's boy was going to be when he could find no trace of him. Suddenly  the smile seemed to freeze on Grandfather Frog's face. That whistle was  coming nearer! Farmer Brown's boy had left the Long Lane and was coming  along the little path. The truth is, he was coming for a drink at the  spring, but Grandfather Frog didn't think of this. He was sure that in  some way Farmer Brown's boy had found out which way he had gone and was  coming after him. He crouched down as flat as he could on the big  hummock and held his breath. Farmer Brown's boy went straight past.  Just a few steps beyond, he stopped and knelt down. Peeping through the  grass, Grandfather Frog saw him dip up beautiful clear water in an old  cup and drink. Then Grandfather Frog knew just where the spring was.    A few minutes later, Farmer Brown's boy passed again, still whistling,  on his way to the Long Lane. Grandfather Frog waited only long enough to  be sure that he had really gone. Then, with bigger jumps than ever, he  started for the spring. A dozen long jumps, and he could see the water.  Two more jumps and then a long jump, and he had landed in the spring  with a splash!    \"Chugarum!\" cried Grandfather Frog. \"How good the water feels!\"    And all the time, Grandfather Frog had jumped straight into more  trouble.          XX    GRANDFATHER FROG LOSES HEART      Look before you leap;    The water may be deep.      That is the very best kind of advice, but most people find that out when  it is too late. Grandfather Frog did. Of course he had heard that little  verse all his life. Indeed, he had been very fond of saying it to those  who came to the Smiling Pool to ask his advice. But Grandfather Frog  seemed to have left all his wisdom behind him when he left the Smiling  Pool to go out into the Great World. You see, it is very hard work for  any one whose advice has been sought to turn right around and take  advice themselves. So Grandfather Frog had been getting into scrapes  ever since he started out on his foolish journey, and now here he was in  still another, and he had landed in it head first, with a great splash.    Of course, when he had seen the cool, sparkling water of the spring, it  had seemed to him that he just couldn't wait another second to get into  it. He was so hot and dry and dreadfully thirsty and uncomfortable! And  so--oh, dear me!--Grandfather Frog didn't look at all before he leaped.  No, Sir, he didn't! He just dived in with a great long jump. Oh, how  good that water felt! For a few minutes he couldn't think of anything  else. It was cooler than the water of the Smiling Pool, because, as you  know, it was a spring. But it felt all the better for that, and  Grandfather Frog just closed his eyes and floated there in pure  happiness."]]]
