It's we who are going to make its history. So far we can't say it  has had any annals; in the future it must show a whole splendid list of  achievements and successes. Years afterwards, when it's the most famous  school in the county, we shall be proud to have had the privilege of  taking our share in pushing it on, and our names may be handed down to  long generations of girls as those who founded its best traditions.\"    Margaret paused, quite out of breath with her long speech. A storm of  applause rose from the audience; the girls clapped and stamped, a few  even cheered. Margaret had touched the right string. The idea of making  school history appealed to them, and they were ready to respond with  enthusiasm to her appeal. Even the ten-year-olds were eager to show  their zeal. Winona had never taken her eyes off the speaker. It was a  new gospel to her that she was one of the great community, bound to help  the common weal. The realization of it stirred her spirit; her  imagination danced ahead, and performed prodigies. Suppose she could do  something wonderful for the school, and leave her name as a memory to  others? The vision gleamed golden. It would be worth living to  accomplish that.    \"Not half a bad speech!\" murmured Garnet approvingly by her side.    Winona started, and came back from the clouds.    \"I think it's--just immense!\" she answered with a long sigh of  admiration.    Margaret was again ringing the bell for silence.    \"I'm glad to find you all agree with me,\" she announced. \"Now I want us  to get solidly to business, and elect a Games Captain. You remember I  asked each to nominate a candidate, and I find that more than two-thirds  have handed in the same name--that of Kirsty Paterson. I therefore put  Kirsty up for election. It's only fair that I should first go over her  qualifications for the office. She was our best center forward last year  at hockey, and our best bowler at cricket. She's a thoroughly steady and  reliable player herself, and--this is most important--she's able to  train others. You know from experience that she's fair and just, and  she's tremendously keen. I feel sure that in her hands the games would  prosper, and we'd soon show some improvement. Will all those in favor of  electing Kirsty kindly stand up?\"    There was such a general rising among the girls that most presidents  would have considered the matter settled. Margaret, however, liked to do  things strictly in order.    \"Thanks I Will you please sit down again. Now those against the election  kindly stand.\"    A certain section in the school had intended to vote against Kirsty, but  when they saw themselves so enormously outnumbered, they changed their  minds. To belong to a minority often means to be unpopular, and it is  wise to go with the stream. After all, Kirsty was a thoroughly eligible  and desirable candidate. So though a few neighbors elbowed each other,  nobody rose.    Margaret waited a moment.    \"Do I understand that you're all in favor? Then the motion is carried  unanimously. I'm very glad, for I think Kirsty will make an ideal  captain. Let's give three cheers for her. Are you ready? Hip-hip-hip  hooray!\"    The girls responded with full lung power. Some even began to sing: \"For  she's a jolly good fellow!\" and there was a general outcry of \"Speech!  Speech!\" The blushing Kirsty--a bonny, rosy, athletic looking  lassie--was seized by her fellow prefects, and dragged, in spite of her  protests, to the front of the platform. Kirsty had been born north of  the Tweed, and in moments of excitement her pretty Scottish burr  asserted itself.    \"It's verra kind of you to elect me,\" she began. \"I'm afraid I'm no hand  at making speeches. I preferr deeds to worrds. We'll all put ourr  shoulderrs to the wheel, and win forr the school, won't we? I hope we'll  have a splendid yearr!\"    At that she retired amidst rapturous applause. Margaret again rang the  bell for silence, and proceeded with the business of the meeting, which  was to elect the officers for the various societies and guilds. This  being satisfactorily settled, she turned to affairs of lighter moment.    \"I'm sure you'll all agree that it is very desirable for us to have a  form trophy, for hockey, at any rate. Perhaps by next summer we'll get  one for cricket as well. It will spur us on to have a little wholesome  competition amongst ourselves. As I announced on the notice board, we  are now going to give a short entertainment, at the close of which a  collection will be taken for the object I have just mentioned. I hate  begging, so give what you like, but of course it depends on your  generosity this afternoon what kind of a trophy we are able to buy. The  first item on our program is a piano solo by Hester King.\"    Hester was one of the best music pupils in the school. She had a good  crisp touch and considerable execution, and led off the concert with a  sprightly tarantella. A violin solo followed, by Sibyl Lee, a member of  V.b., who was rather nervous, but acquitted herself fairly well  on the whole.    \"I thought I'd break down,\" she confided to her friends. \"The sight of  all those eyes staring at me quite put me off. I don't wonder blind  musicians are generally successes, they can't see the audience. Well,  never mind, I've done my bit, at any rate!\"    The next on the list was a song from Annie Hardy. She had chosen \"Keep  the Home Fires Burning,\" and rendered it with great effect, the whole  room joining with enthusiasm in the chorus. It took so well that there  were shouts of \"Encore!\" and Annie came back smiling to give \"Khaki  Boys,\" which roused her audience to an even higher pitch of patriotic  fervor. A recitation, \"Our Hockey Match,\" by Agnes Heath, was felt to be  particularly appropriate to the occasion. It was a very good \"school  piece,\" humorous as well as exciting, and Agnes had enough dramatic  ability to do justice to it. Her own form in particular stamped lustily.  The prefects motioned her forward again, but she shook her head. The  clapping redoubled. Agnes, escorted to the front by Margaret, bowed and  announced:    \"Fearfully sorry not to oblige, but this is absolutely the only thing I  know, and it's too long to say all over again!\"    There was a general laugh, and the audience settled itself to enjoy the  next item on the program. Margaret was signaling to Winona and Garnet,  and the pair slipped from their places, and made their way to the  platform.    \"I'm all upset! I hope I shan't break down!\" whispered Winona.    \"Nonsense! A duet's not so bad as a solo. You'll get on all right. Do  for goodness' sake brace up!\" implored Garnet. \"If you muddle your  accompaniment you'll spoil my part. You'll surely never go and fail me!\"    The instruments had been put under the piano. Patricia Marshall handed  them forth, and sounded the notes for them to be tuned. Clarice Nixon  was placing chairs and music-stands. Garnet was tolerably composed, but  Winona was suffering from a bad attack of that most unpleasant malady  \"stage fright.\" She would have given worlds for a trapdoor in the  platform to open, and allow her to subside out of sight. No such  convenient arrangement, however, had been provided for the use of  bashful performers, the planks were solid, and guaranteed not to give  way under any circumstances. There was nothing for it but to take her  seat in full view of the audience. There were slightly over two hundred  girls in the room, but to Winona's fevered imagination there appeared to  be thousands. She wondered how she could ever have had the folly to  place herself in such a public situation. Garnet was sounding a few  notes and looking at her to begin. For one dreadful moment the room  whirled. Perhaps Margaret saw and understood; she laid her hand on  Winona's shaking arm, and whispered encouragingly:    \"Go on! Don't mind the audience. Just remember that you're playing for  the form trophy!\"    A sudden revulsion of feeling swept over Winona. All the school  patriotism aroused within her by Margaret's speech surged up to meet the  crisis. She was no longer an isolated atom, a girl fresh from home, and  on trial before the critical eyes of her new form, but a unit in the  great life of the school, bound to play her part for the good of the  whole, and specially pledged not to fail Garnet in this emergency. Self  faded in the larger vision. The color flooded back into her face. She  made a desperate effort, and struck the opening chords.    As her friend had reminded her, a duet was quite a different matter from  a solo. Directly the mandoline part began, her confidence returned. She  tried to think that she was only playing an accompaniment for Garnet.  The piece was not difficult, it was in D, quite the easiest key for the  guitar, with very few accidentals or high positions. She took courage,  and struck her strings crisply, so that the tone rang out well. Her  instrument was a good one, very true and mellow, and her mother had  taught her the liquid Spanish touch which showed it to its best  advantage. Garnet also was doing her best. Her plectrum vibrated evenly  and rapidly, and the metallic twang, her gravest fault, was not nearly  so evident as usual. The audience, unfamiliar with these particular  instruments, was not hypercritical, and so long as the players kept well  together, and sounded no discords, their skill was judged to be  excellent. The Barcarolle had an attractive swing about it, and a  romantic suggestion of gondolas and lapping water and moonlight  serenades. As the last notes of the air on the mandoline died away,  Winona swept her thumb over the strings of her guitar in a tremendous  final chord. It had quite a magnificent and professional effect. There  was no mistake about the applause; it was simply clamorous.    \"Stand up and bow!\" whispered Margaret, nudging the unaccustomed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18087"],[0,"Historic Doubts Relative To Napoleon Buonaparte (#8)"],[1," FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL  LETTER ETA WITH DASIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER ZETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  ETA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK  SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL  LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} {~GREEK  SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL  LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}, {~GREEK SMALL LETTER  KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH  VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH PSILI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER  TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER  EPSILON WITH DASIA AND OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL  LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL  LETTER ALPHA WITH PERISPOMENI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL  LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}  {~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  EPSILON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK  SMALL LETTER ALPHA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}.

PIND. Olymp. 1    [14] This doctrine, though hardly needing confirmation from authority,  is supported by that of Hume; his eighth essay is, throughout, an  argument for the doctrine of \"Philosophical necessity,\" drawn entirely  from the general uniformity, observable in the course of nature with  respect to the principles of _human conduct_, as well as those of the  material universe; from which uniformity, he observes, it is that we  are enabled _in both cases_, to form our judgment by means of  _Experience:_ \"and if,\" says he, \"we would explode any forgery in  history, we cannot make use of a more convincing argument, than to  prove that the actions ascribed to any person, are directly contrary  to the course of nature....    \"... The Veracity of Quintus Curtius is as suspicious when he  describes the supernatural courage of Alexander, by which he was  hurried on singly to attack multitudes, as when he describes his  supernatural force and activity, by which he was able to resist them.  So readily and universally do we acknowledge a _uniformity in human  motives and actions, as well as in the operations of body_.\"--_Eighth  Essay_, p. 131, 12mo; p. 85, 8vo, 1817.    Accordingly, in the tenth essay, his use of the term \"miracle,\" after  having called it \"a transgression of a law of nature,\" plainly shows  that he meant to include _human_ nature: \"no testimony,\" says he, \"is  sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a  nature that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which  it endeavours to establish.\" The term \"prodigy\" also (which he all  along employs as synonymous with \"miracle\") is applied to testimony, in  the same manner, immediately after; \"In the foregoing reasoning we have  supposed ... that the falsehood of that testimony would be a kind of  _prodigy_.\" Now had he meant to confine the meaning of \"miracle,\" and  \"prodigy,\" to a violation of the laws of _matter_, the epithet  \"_miraculous_,\" applied even thus hypothetically, to _false testimony_,  would be as unmeaning as the epithets \"green\" or \"square;\" the only  possible sense in which we can apply to it, even"]]]
