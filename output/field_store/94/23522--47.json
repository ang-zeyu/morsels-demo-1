The continued use of  corruptible food rendered their bodies more and more gross; and human  life was soon reduced to a very brief span.\"    Basil Valentine then deals with the formation of the three  _Principles_ of things, by the mutual action of the four Elements.  Fire acting on Air produced _Sulphur_; Air acting on Water produced  _Mercury_; Water acting on Earth produced _Salt_. Earth having nothing  to act on produced nothing, but became the nurse of the three  Principles. \"The three Principles,\" he says, \"are necessary because  they are the immediate substance of metals. The remoter substance of  metals is the four elements, but no one can produce anything out of  them but God; and even God makes nothing of them but these three  Principles.\"    To endeavour to obtain the four pure Elements is a hopeless task. But  the Sage has the three Principles at hand. \"The artist should  determine which of the three Principles he is seeking, and should  assist it so that it may overcome its contrary.\" \"The art consists in  an even mingling of the virtues of the Elements; in the natural  equilibrium of the hot, the dry, the cold, and the moist.\"    The account of the Elements given by Philalethes differs from that of  Basil Valentine.    Philalethes enumerates three Elements only: Air, Water, and Earth.  Things are not formed by the mixture of these Elements, for  \"dissimilar things can never really unite.\" By analysing the  properties of the three Elements, Philalethes reduced them finally to  one, namely, Water. \"Water,\" he says, \"is the first principle of all  things.\" \"Earth is the fundamental Element in which all bodies grow  and are preserved. Air is the medium into which they grow, and by  means of which the celestial virtues are communicated to them.\"    According to Philalethes, _Mercury_ is the most important of the three  Principles. Although gold is formed by the aid of Mercury, it is only  when Mercury has been matured, developed, and perfected, that it is  able to transmute inferior metals into gold. The essential thing to do  is, therefore, to find an agent which will bring about the maturing  and perfecting of Mercury. This agent, Philalethes calls \"Our divine  Arcanum.\"    Although it appears to me impossible to translate the sayings of the  alchemists concerning Elements and Principles into expressions which  shall have definite and exact meanings for us to-day, still we may,  perhaps, get an inkling of the meaning of such sentences as those I  have quoted from Basil Valentine and Philalethes.    Take the terms _Fire_ and _Water_. In former times all liquid  substances were supposed to be liquid because they possessed something  in common; this hypothetical something was called the _Element,  Water_. Similarly, the view prevailed until comparatively recent  times, that burning substances burn because of the presence in them of  a hypothetical imponderable fluid, called \"_Caloric_\"; the alchemists  preferred to call this indefinable something an Element, and to name  it _Fire_.    We are accustomed to-day to use the words _fire_ and _water_ with  different meanings, according to the ideas we wish to express. When we  say \"do not touch the fire,\" or \"put your hand into the water,\" we are  regarding fire and water as material things; when we say \"the house is  on fire,\" or speak of \"a diamond of the first water,\" we are thinking  of the condition or state of a burning body, or of a substance as  transparent as water. When we say \"put out the fire,\" or \"his heart  became as water,\" we are referring to the act of burning, or are using  an image which likens the thing spoken of to a substance in the act of  liquefying.    As we do to-day, so the alchemists did before us; they used the words  _fire_ and _water_ to express different ideas.    Such terms as hardness, softness, coldness, toughness, and the like,  are employed for the purpose of bringing together into one point of  view different things which are alike in, at least, one respect. Hard  things may differ in size, weight, shape, colour, texture, &c. A soft  thing may weigh the same as a hard thing; both may have the same  colour or the same size, or be at the same temperature, and so on. By  classing together various things as hard or soft, or smooth or rough,  we eliminate (for the time) all the properties wherein the things  differ, and regard them only as having one property in common. The  words hardness, softness, &c., are useful class-marks.    Similarly the alchemical Elements and Principles were useful  class-marks.    We must not suppose that when the alchemists spoke of certain things  as formed from, or by the union of, the same Elements or the same  Principles, they meant that these things contained a common substance.  Their Elements and Principles were not thought of as substances, at  least not in the modern meaning of the expression, _a substance_; they  were qualities only.    If we think of the alchemical elements earth, air, fire, and water, as  general expressions of what seemed to the alchemists the most  important properties of all substances, we may be able to attach some  kind of meaning to the sayings of Basil Valentine, which I have  quoted. For instance, when that alchemist tells us, \"Fire is the most  passive of all elements, and resembles a chariot; when it is drawn, it  moves; when it is not drawn, it stands still\"--we may suppose he meant  to express the fact that a vast number of substances can be burnt, and  that combustion does not begin of itself, but requires an external  agency to start it.    Unfortunately, most of the terms which the alchemists used to  designate their Elements and Principles are terms which are now  employed to designate specific substances. The word _fire_ is still  employed rather as a quality of many things under special conditions,  than as a specific substance; but _earth_, _water_, _air_, _salt_,  _sulphur_, and _mercury_, are to-day the names applied to certain  groups of properties, each of which is different from all other groups  of properties, and is, therefore, called, in ordinary speech, a  definite kind of matter.    As knowledge became more accurate and more concentrated, the words  _sulphur_, _salt_, _mercury_, &c., began to be applied to distinct  substances, and as these terms were still employed in their alchemical  sense as compendious expressions for certain qualities common to great  classes of substances, much confusion arose. Kunckel, the discoverer  of phosphorus, who lived between 1630 and 1702, complained of the  alchemists' habit of giving different names to the same substance, and  the same name to different substances. \"The sulphur of one,\" he says,  \"is not the sulphur of another, to the great injury of science. To  that one replies that everyone is perfectly free to baptise his infant  as he pleases. Granted. You may if you like call an ass an ox, but you  will never make anyone believe that your ox is an ass.\" Boyle is very  severe on the vague and loose use of words practised by so many  writers of his time. In _The Sceptical Chymist_ (published 1678-9) he  says: \"If judicious men, skilled in chymical affairs, shall once agree  to write clearly and plainly of them, and thereby keep men from being  stunned, as it were, or imposed upon by dark and empty words; it is to  be hoped that these [other] men finding, that they can no longer write  impertinently and absurdly, without being laughed at for doing so,  will be reduced either to write nothing, or books that may teach us  something, and not rob men, as formerly, of invaluable time; and so  ceasing to trouble the world with riddles or impertinences, we shall  either by their books receive an advantage, or by their silence escape  an inconvenience.\"    Most of the alchemists taught that the elements produced what they  called _seed_, by their mutual reactions, and the principles matured  this seed and brought it to perfection. They supposed that each class,  or kind, of things had its own seed, and that to obtain the seed was  to have the power of producing the things which sprung from that seed.    Some of them, however, asserted that all things come from a common  seed, and that the nature of the products of this seed is conditioned  by the circumstances under which it is caused to develop.    Thus Michael Sendivogius writes as follows in _The New Chemical Light,  drawn from the fountain of Nature and of Manual Experience_ (17th  century):--      \"Wherever there is seed, Nature will work through it, whether it    be good or bad.\" \"The four Elements, by their continued action,    project a constant supply of seed to the centre of the earth,    where it is digested, and whence it proceeds again in generative    motions. Now the centre of the earth is a certain void place where    nothing is at rest, and upon the margin or circumference of this    centre the four Elements project their qualities.... The magnetic    force of our earth-centre attracts to itself as much as is needed    of the cognate seminal substance, while that which cannot be used    for vital generation is thrust forth in the shape of stones and    other rubbish. This is the fountain-head of all things    terrestrial. Let us illustrate the matter by supposing a glass of    water to be set in the middle of a table, round the margin of    which are placed little heaps of salt, and of powders of different    colours. If the water be poured out, it will run all over the    table in divergent rivulets, and will become salt where it touches    the salt, red where it touches the red powder,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14226"],[0,"Lobo, Rag and Vixen (#8)"],[1,"ownie's feathers, scattered around, and now  he knew the meaning of that shot.    Who can tell what his horror and his mourning were? The outward signs  were few, some minutes dumbly gazing at the place with downcast,  draggled look, and then a change at the thought of their helpless brood.  Back to the hiding-place he went, and called the well-known '_Kreet,  kreet_.' Did every grave give up its little inmate at the magic word?  No, barely more than half; six little balls of down unveiled their  lustrous eyes, and, rising, ran to meet him, but four feathered little  bodies had found their graves indeed. Redruff called again and again,  till he was sure that all who could respond had come, then led them from  that dreadful place, far, far away up-stream, where barbed-wire fences  and bramble thickets were found to offer a less grateful, but more  reliable, shelter.    Here the brood grew and were trained by their father just as his mother  had trained him; though wider knowledge and experience gave him many  advantages. He knew so well the country round and all the  feeding-grounds, and how to meet the ills that harass partridge-life,  that the summer passed and not a chick was lost. They grew and  flourished, and when the Gunner Moon arrived they were a fine family of  six grown-up grouse with Redruff, splendid in his gleaming copper  feathers, at their head. He had ceased to drum during the summer after  the loss of Brownie, but drumming is to the partridge what singing is to  the lark; while it is his love-song, it is also an expression of  exuberance born of health, and when the molt was over and September food  and weather had renewed his splendid plumes and braced him up again, his  spirits revived, and finding himself one day near the old log he mounted  impulsively, and drummed again and again.    From that time he often drummed, while his children sat around, or one  who showed his father's blood would mount some nearby stump or stone,  and beat the air in the loud tattoo.    The black grapes and the Mad Moon now came on. But Redruff's brood were  of a vigorous stock; their robust health meant robust wits, and though  they got the craze, it passed within a week, and only three had flown  away for good.    Redruff, with his remaining three, was living in the glen when the snow  came. It was light, flaky snow, and as the weather was not very cold,  the family squatted for the night under the low, flat boughs of a  cedar-tree. But next day the storm continued, it grew colder, and the  drifts piled up all day. At night the snowfall ceased, but the frost  grew harder still, so Redruff, leading the family to a birch-tree above  a deep drift, dived into the snow, and the others did the same. Then  into the holes the wind blew the loose snow--their pure white  bed-*clothes, and thus tucked in they slept in comfort, for the snow is  a warm wrap, and the air passes through it easily enough for breathing.  Next morning each partridge found a solid wall of ice before him from  his frozen breath, but easily turned to one side and rose on the wing at  Redruff's morning '_Kreet, kreet, kwit_.' (Come children, come children,  fly.)    This was the first night for them in a snowdrift, though it was an old  story to Redruff, and next night they merrily dived again into bed, and  the north wind tucked them in as before. But a change of weather was  brewing. The night wind veered to the east. A fall of heavy flakes gave  place to sleet, and that to silver rain. The whole wide world was  sheathed in ice, and when the grouse awoke to quit their beds, they  found themselves sealed in with a great, cruel sheet of edgeless ice.    The deeper snow was still quite soft, and Redruff bored his way to the  top, but there the hard, white sheet defied his strength. Hammer and  struggle as he might he could make no impression, and only bruised his  wings and head. His life had been made up of keen joys and dull  hardships, with frequent sudden desperate straits, but this seemed the  hardest brunt of all, as the slow hours wore on and found him weakening  with his struggles, but no nearer to freedom. He could hear the  struggling of his family, too, or sometimes heard them calling to him  for help with their long-drawn plaintive '_p-e-e-e-e-e-t-e,  p-e-e-e-e-e-t-e_.'    They were hidden from many of their enemies, but not from the pangs of  hunger, and when the night came down the weary prisoners, worn out with  hunger and useless toil, grew quiet in despair. At first they had been  afraid the fox would come and find them imprisoned there at his mercy,  but as the second night went slowly by they no longer cared, and even  wished he would come and break the crusted snow, and so give them at  least a fighting chance for life.    But when the fox really did come padding over the frozen drift, the  deep-laid love of life revived, and they crouched in utter stillness  till he passed. The second day was one of driving storm. The north wind  sent his snow-horses, hissing and careering over the white earth,  tossing and curling their white manes and kicking up more snow as they  dashed on. The long, hard grinding of the granular snow seemed to be  thinning the snow-crust, for though far from dark below, it kept on  growing lighter. Redruff had pecked and pecked at the under side all  day, till his head ached and his bill was wearing blunt, but when the  sun went down he seemed as far as ever from escape. The night passed  like the others, except no fox went trotting overhead. In the morning he  renewed his pecking, though now with scarcely any force, and the voices  or struggles of the others were no more heard. As the daylight grew  stronger he could see that his long efforts had made a brighter spot  above him in the snow, and he continued feebly pecking. Outside, the  storm-horses kept on trampling all day, the crust was really growing  thin under their heels, and late that afternoon his bill went through  into the open air. New life came with this gain, and he pecked away,  till just before the sun went down he had made a hole that his head, his  neck, and his ever-beautiful ruffs could pass. His great, broad  shoulders were too large, but he could now strike downward, which gave  him fourfold force; the snow-crust crumbled quickly, and in a little  while he sprang from his icy prison once more free. But the young ones!  Redruff flew to the nearest bank, hastily gathered a few red hips to  stay his gnawing hunger, then returned to the prison-drift and clucked  and stamped. He got only one reply, a feeble '_peete, peete_,' and  scratching with his sharp claws on the thinned granular sheet he soon  broke through, and Graytail feebly crawled out of the hole. But that was  all; the others, scattered he could not tell where in the drift, made no  reply, gave no sign of life, and he was forced to leave them. When the  snow melted in the spring their bodies came to view, skin, bones, and  feathers--nothing more.          VII      It was long before Redruff and Graytail fully recovered, but food and  rest in plenty are sure cure-alls, and a bright, clear day in midwinter  had the usual effect of setting the vigorous Redruff to drumming on the  log. Was it the drumming, or the tell-tale tracks of their snowshoes on  the omnipresent snow, that betrayed them to Cuddy? He came prowling  again and again up the ravine, with dog and gun, intent to hunt the  partridges down. They knew him of old, and he was coming now to know  them well. That great copper-ruffed cock was becoming famous up and down  the valley. During the Gunner Moon many a one had tried to end his  splendid life, just as a worthless wretch of old sought fame by burning  the Ephesian wonder of the world. But Redruff was deep in woodcraft. He  knew just where to hide, and when to rise on silent wing, and when to  squat till overstepped, then rise on thunder wing within a yard to  shield himself at once behind some mighty tree-trunk and speed away.    But Cuddy never ceased to follow with his gun that red-ruffed cock; many  a long snap-shot he tried, but somehow always found a tree, a bank, or  some safe shield between, and Redruff lived and throve and drummed.    When the Snow Moon came he moved with Graytail to the Castle Frank  woods, where food was plenty as well as grand old trees. There was in  particular, on the east slope among the creeping hemlocks, a splendid  pine. It was six feet through, and its first branches began at the tops  of the other trees. Its top in summer-time was a famous resort for the  bluejay and his bride. Here, far beyond the reach of shot, in warm  spring days the jay would sing and dance before his mate, spread his  bright blue plumes and warble the sweetest fairyland music, so sweet and  soft that few hear it but the one for whom it is meant, and books know  nothing at all about it.    This great pine had an especial interest for Redruff, now living near  with his remaining young one, but its base, not its far-away crown,  concerned him. All around were low, creeping hemlocks, and among them  the partridge-vine and the wintergreen grew, and the sweet black acorns  could be scratched from under the snow. There was no better  feeding-ground, for when that insatiable gunner came on them there it  was easy to run low among the hemlock to the great pine, then rise with  a derisive _whirr_ behind its bulk, and keeping the huge trunk in line  with the deadly gun, skim off in safety. A dozen times at least the pine  had saved them during the lawful murder season, and here it was that  Cuddy, knowing their feeding habits, laid a new trap. Under the bank he  sneaked and watched in ambush while an accomplice went around the Sugar  Loaf to drive the birds. He came trampling through the low thicket where  Redruff and Graytail were feeding, and long before the gunner was  dangerously near Redruff gave a low warning '_rrr-rrr_' (danger) and  walked quickly toward the"]]]
