Don't you see, Inspector, that this is a deeply and cunningly laid  trap? What I had taken for a series of unfortunate coincidences I  perceive now to be the workings of an elaborate scheme involving  perfectly innocent people in the crime.\"    \"H'm,\" said Gatton doubtfully; \"it may be as you suggest; at any rate  it is a new point of view and one which I confess had not occurred to  me. There is one witness who can clear up any doubt on the subject.\"    \"You mean Marie?\"    \"Exactly. She will lie, beyond doubt, but we shall find means to reach  the truth.\"    \"Would it not be advisable, Inspector,\" I asked excitedly, \"to make  sure of her at once?\"    Gatton smiled grimly, and:    \"Marie would have to make herself invisible to evade Scotland Yard  now,\" he replied. \"She is being watched closely. But,\" he continued,  \"what do you make of these marks on the door?\"    We had reclosed the garage door and now were standing immediately  inside. The marks to which my companion had drawn my attention were  situated high up near the roof.    \"This may account for the statement of Bolton that the door seemed  more difficult to open last night than to-day,\" he said. \"Unless I am  greatly mistaken, some sort of attachment existed here until quite  recently.\"    \"Possibly a contrivance for reclosing the door?\" I suggested.    The marks in fact roughly corresponded to those which would be made by  the presence of such a contrivance and there seemed to have been some  attempt where it had been removed to disguise the holes left by the  screws.    \"But the purpose of it?\" muttered Gatton helplessly.    \"God knows,\" I said; \"the purpose of the whole thing is a mystery  beyond me entirely.\"    \"Assuming that such a piece of mechanism as you suggest had been  attached to the door,\" mused Gatton, \"you would have noticed its  operation last night, unless one of you held the door open.\"    \"Neither of us held the door!\" I interrupted excitedly. \"I remember  that we stood just outside looking in. I was behind the constable and  he was directing the rays of his lantern into the place.\"    \"H'm,\" muttered Gatton. \"Then it wasn't a contrivance for closing the  door; it was something else. Suppose we investigate the other door?\"    We proceeded to the other door and I became aware of an intense  curiosity respecting what we should find, and of a conviction too that  there would be evidence here of another attachment. In this I was  quite correct. Some piece of mechanism had evidently been fastened to  this door also. Together we stood staring up at these tell-tale  screw-holes and then rather blankly we stared at one another.    \"We only lack one thing,\" said Gatton; \"the scheme upon which all  these contrivances and apparently isolated episodes were hung  together. Nothing, as we have already assumed, was accident, and  nothing coincidence. It was with some deliberate purpose that the  constable was instructed to walk through this garage, opening and  shutting the doors behind him.\"    \"From whom did these instructions come?\"    \"That is one of the minor points which I have already cleared up,\" he  replied. \"On my way here I called at the house agent's, as you know,  since I have the keys; I also called at the station. The sergeant who  was on duty last night I could not see, unfortunately, but I  learned--that it was a woman who rang up.\"    My heart sank lower and lower. It seemed to me as we stood in that  empty garage that an invisible hand was drawing a net closer and  closer about Isobel and my ideas became increasingly chaotic, for the  purpose of it all eluded me, try how I would to conceive of a scheme  by which any one could profit which necessitated the imprisonment, or  worse, of Isobel.    \"And the agent?\" I asked in a rather toneless voice.    Gatton shook his head.    \"I have no reason to doubt the word of this man of business,\" he  replied, \"because at the time when I saw him he could not possibly  have learned of the crime, but nevertheless his account is almost  unbelievable. It appears then, he, too, received his instructions  throughout by telephone.\"    \"What?\" I exclaimed.    \"By telephone,\" repeated Gatton. \"He was rung up about ten days ago by  some one who made a verbal offer to lease the Red House for a period  of twelve months. A foreigner, who in lieu of the usual references,  was prepared to pay the annual rent in advance. As the Red House, to  use an Irishism, was regarded as something of a white elephant, the  agent was interested, apparently; and when on the following day the  sum agreed upon arrived by post, he did not demur about delivering the  keys to the prospective lessee, who desired to take certain  measurements in regard to carpets and so forth.\"    \"Wait a moment,\" I interrupted; \"to whom did he deliver these keys?\"    \"To a district messenger who called for them, as the agent had been  advised that one would do.\"    \"Very well. What then?\"    \"That is all that the agent had to say.\"    \"What, that is all?\"    \"Substantially there is nothing more. It is quite evident that the  sole intention of this unknown lessee was to secure possession of the  house for the purpose of the crime only.\"    \"Do you mean that from first to last no one but the district messenger  appeared in the matter?\"    \"No one,\" Gatton assured me, \"and the rent, payment of which quite  disarmed the agent of course, was sent in the form of Treasury notes  and not by check.\"    \"But surely some name, some address, must have been given?\"    \"A name was given,\" replied Gatton, \"and a hotel address, but  confirmation of their accuracy was never sought, after the receipt of  the money.\"    \"And the voice on the telephone?\"    Again I saw that odd expression creep over Gatton's face, and:    \"It was a woman's voice,\" he answered.    \"Great heavens!\" I muttered--\"what does it all mean?\"    That the evidence of the cabman when he was discovered and of the  carter who had taken the box from the garage to the docks, and (for it  was possibly the same man) who had first delivered it at the Red  House, would but tighten the net about Isobel, whom I knew to be  innocent, I felt assured.    \"Gatton,\" I said, \"this case appears to me to resolve itself into a  deliberate conspiracy of which the end was not the assassination of  Sir Marcus, but the conviction of Miss Merlin!\"    Gatton looked at me with evident complexity written all over him.    \"I begin to think the same,\" he confessed. \"This business was never  planned and carried out by a woman, I'll swear to that. There is a  woman concerned in it, for at every point we come upon evidence of her  voice issuing the mysterious instructions; but she is not alone in the  matter. Already the intricacy of the thing points to a criminal of  genius. When we know the whole truth, if we ever do, that the crime  was planned by a man of amazing, if perverted, intellect, will be put  beyond dispute, I think.\"    \"What is puzzling me, Gatton,\" I said, \"is the connection existing  between the incidents which took place in this garage and those,  unknown at present, which took place in the furnished room in the Red  House.\"    \"Obviously,\" replied Gatton, \"a supper for two had been prepared, and  that one of those two was the late Sir Marcus is perfectly obvious.  That he expected the other to be Miss Merlin is at least suggested by  the presence of her photograph in the room; for you will have noticed  that it is the _only_ photograph there.\"    \"Nevertheless,\" I said firmly, \"I am positive that no one would be  more surprised than herself to learn of its presence.\"    \"And as I have already said,\" replied Gatton, \"I am rapidly coming  round to your way of thinking. But even if I were quite sure of it the  evidence at the moment is all the other way, you will admit. As to the  connection between this garage and the interrupted supper party (for  obviously it was interrupted) this it must be my business to find  out.\"    \"Don't you think,\" I said, \"that we are attaching perhaps undue  importance to the fact that some kind of fittings have been removed  from the doors? They may have been removed by the late occupier, and  the call to the police depot may have been made with the idea of  securing a witness, and a credible one, to the presence of the crate  here on the night of the murder.\"    \"At the moment,\" replied Gatton, musingly, \"I cannot see that this  would have served any useful purpose; but nevertheless you may be  right. I am going to assume, however, that you are wrong, and that the  object of sending Bolton here last night was to open and shut these  doors. I propose now to return again to the scene of the interrupted  supper.\"    Leaving the garage not very much wiser than when we had entered it,  we paced once more up the drive in the shade of the big trees and  were greeted again by the malarious smell of rotting leaves. Entering  the Red House, Gatton and I proceeded first to that incredible oasis  in the desert of empty rooms and my companion made a detailed  examination of everything in the place, even sounding the walls,  examining the fittings of the door, and finally proceeding through the  hall in the direction of the south wing of the house--that nearest to  the garage.    What he expected to find I had no idea, but his attention seemed to be  more particularly directed towards the wainscot and the picture-rails  of the empty and uncarpeted rooms which we entered. Whatever he had  sought he failed to find, and at last we stood in a desolate apartment  looking out into the tangled shrubbery before the windows. The back of  the garage was visible from there and I viewed it dully, wondering  what evil secret it held, and marveling at the trick of fate which had  made me witness of an act in this gruesome drama.    \"Of course, Gatton,\" I said, \"we are all along assuming that Sir  Marcus"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15344"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Sophomore Year at High School (#8)"],[1,"pain and would have fallen had they not held her.    \"She has sprained her ankle!\" exclaimed Miss Thompson. \"How did it happen,  Grace? I did not see you fall.\"    \"I don't know, Miss Thompson,\" said Grace faintly. \"It all happened so  quickly I didn't have time to think about it.\"    \"It certainly is a shame,\" cried Anne. \"And I know----\"    Just then Grace gave Anne a warning glance and shook her head slightly.  Anne closed her lips and was silent.    \"What were you saying, Anne?\" asked Miss Thompson.    But Anne had received her orders.    \"I am so sorry that Grace has been hurt,\" she said lamely.    A carriage was ordered and Grace was taken home, Anne and Mrs. Harlowe  accompanying her. Mrs. Harlowe sent for their physician, who bandaged the  swollen ankle, and told Grace that the sprain was not serious. She  refused, however, to go to bed, but lay on the wide lounge in the sitting  room.    \"Just keep quiet for a few days, and you'll be all right,\" said Dr. Gale.  \"You girls are as bad as boys about getting hard knocks. It looks as  though basketball were about as barbarous as football.\"    \"It is a dear old game, and I love it in spite of hard knocks,\" said Grace  emphatically.    \"I like your spirit, Grace,\" laughed Dr. Gale. \"Now, remember to treat  that ankle well if you want to appear again in the basketball arena.\"    \"Grace,\" said Anne, after the doctor had gone. \"You know how it happened,  don't you?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Grace, after a little hesitation. \"I do.\"    \"What are you going to do about it?\" asked Anne.    \"I don't know,\" said Grace. \"I am not sure it was intentional.\"    \"Grace,\" said Anne with decision, \"it was intentional. I watched her every  minute of the game, for I didn't trust her, and I saw her do it. I was so  angry that when Miss Thompson asked how it happened I felt that I must  tell, then and there. It was you who prevented me. I think such a trick  should be exposed.\"    \"What a vengeful little Anne,\" said Grace. \"You are usually the last one  to tell anything.\"    She took Anne's hand in hers.    \"It's just this way, Anne,\" she continued. \"If I were to tell what Julia  Crosby did, Miss Thompson might forbid basketball. That would be dreadful.  Besides, the juniors would hardly believe me, and would say it was a case  of sour grapes, on account of the sophomores losing the game. So you see I  should gain nothing and perhaps lose a great deal. I believe that people  that do mean things are usually repaid in their own coin. Julia didn't  really intend to hurt me. Her idea was to prevent me from getting the  ball. Of course it was dishonorable and she knew it. It is strictly  forbidden in basketball, and if her own team knew positively that she was  guilty, it would go hard with her. There is honor even among thieves, you  know.\"    There was a brief silence. Grace lay back among the cushions, looking very  white and tired. Her ankle pained her severely, but the defeat of her  beloved team was a deeper hurt to her proud spirit.    Anne sat apparently wrapped in thought. She nervously clasped and  unclasped her small hands.    \"Grace,\" she said, \"don't you think it was queer the way the juniors  seemed to understand our signals. They knew every one of them. I believe  that they found that list and it is all my fault. I had no business to  lose it. I felt when I couldn't find it that it would fall into the wrong  hands and cause trouble. I don't care for myself but if the girls find it  out they will blame you for giving it to me. You know what Miriam said the  other day. Now she will have a chance to be disagreeable to you about it.\"    Anne was almost in tears.    \"Anne, dear,\" said Grace soothingly, \"don't worry about it. I am not  afraid to tell the girls about that list, and I shall certainly do so.  They will understand that it was an accident, and overlook it. Besides, we  are not sure that the juniors found it. I will admit that everything  points that way. You know David warned us that they had some mischief on  hand. If they did find it, the only honorable thing to do was to return  it. They are far more at fault than we are, and the girls will agree with  me, I know.\"    But Anne was not so confident.    \"Miriam will try to make trouble about it, I know she will. And I am to  blame for the whole thing,\" she said.    Grace was about to reply when Mrs. Harlowe appeared in the door with a  tray of tempting food.    Anne rose and began donning her wraps.    \"Won't you stay, Anne, and have supper with my invalid girl?\" said Mrs.  Harlowe.    \"Please do, Anne,\" coaxed Grace. \"I hate eating alone, and having you here  takes my mind off my pain.\"    Anne stayed, and the two girls had a merry time over their meal. Grace,  knowing Anne's distress over the lost signals, refused to talk of the  subject. Jessica and Nora, David, Hippy and Reddy dropped in, one after  the other, to inquire for Grace.    \"There is nothing like accidents to bring one's friends together,\"  declared Grace, as the young people gathered around her.    \"I told you to look out for squalls, Grace,\" said David. \"But you didn't  weather the gale very well.\"    \"Those juniors must have been eavesdropping when you made your signal  code. They understood every play you made. By George, I wonder if that  were the meaning of that pow-wow the other day. Some one must have put  Julia Crosby wise, and that's why she called a meeting at the Omnibus  House. It's an out-of-the-way place, and she thought there was no danger  of being disturbed.    \"Who could have been mean enough to betray us?\" cried Nora. \"I am sure  none of the team did, unless----\" Nora stopped short.    She had been on the point of using Miriam's name, but remembered just in  time that Miriam's brother was present.    \"If we knew the girl who did it, we'd certainly cut her acquaintance,\"  said Reddy Brooks.    \"Never again should she bask in the light of our society,\" said Hippy  dramatically.    \"None of our friends would do such a thing,\" said David soberly. Then,  turning to Anne, \"What's your opinion on the subject, Queen Anne?\"    But Anne could find no answer. She simply shook her head.    Grace, knowing Anne's feelings over the affair, came to the rescue.    \"Anne's opinion and mine are the same. We feel sure that they knew our  signals, but we believe they accidentally hit upon the knowledge. There is  no use in crying over spilt milk. We shall have to change all our signals  and take care that it doesn't happen again. And now let's talk of  something more agreeable, for basketball is a sore subject with me in more  than one sense.\" The talk drifted into other channels much to Anne's  relief.    \"I have an idea!\" exclaimed Hippy.    \"Impossible,\" said Reddy. \"No one would ever accuse you of such a thing.\"    \"Be silent, fellow,\" commanded Hippy. \"I will not brook such idle  babbling.\" He strutted up and down the room, his chest inflated and one  hand over his heart, presenting such a ridiculous figure that he raised a  general laugh.    \"Speak on, fat one. I promise not to make any more remarks,\" said Reddy.    \"I propose,\" said Hippy, pausing in his march, \"that we give an impromptu  vaudeville show for the benefit of Miss Grace Harlowe, once an active  member of this happy band, but now laid on the shelf--couch, I mean--for  repairs.\"    \"Done,\" was the unanimous reply.    \"Now,\" continued Hippy, \"get cozy, and the show will begin. Miss Nora  O'Malley will open the show by singing 'Peggy Brady,' as only an Irish  colleen of her pretensions can.\"    Nora rose, looked toward Jessica, who went at once to the piano to  accompany her, and sang the song demanded with a fascinating brogue that  always brought forth the applause of her friends. She responded to an  encore. Then Anne's turn came, and she recited \"Lasca.\" Hippy next favored  the company with a comic song, which caused them to shout with laughter.  Jessica did her Greek dance for which she was famous. The performance  ended with an up-to-date version of \"Antony and Cleopatra,\" enacted by  David, Reddy and Hippy, with dialogue and stage business of which  Shakespeare never dreamed.    It was a product of Hippy's fertile brain, and the boys had been  rehearsing it with great glee, in view of appearing in it, on some fitting  occasion, before the girls.    David, gracefully draped in the piano cover, represented Egypt's queen,  and languished upon Marc Antony's shoulder in the most approved manner.  Reddy, as the Roman conqueror left nothing to be desired. The star actor  of the piece, however, was Hippy, who played the deadly asp. He writhed  and wriggled in a manner that would have filled a respectable serpent with  envy, and in the closing scene bit the unfortunate Cleopatra so venomously  that she howled for mercy, and instead of dying gracefully, arose and  engaged in battle with his snakeship.    Grace forgot her sprained ankle and laughed until the tears rolled down  her cheeks.    \"You funny, funny boys,\" she gasped, \"how did you ever think of anything  so ridiculous!\"    \"Hippy perpetrated the outrage,\" said David \"and we agreed to help him  produce it. We have been practising it for two weeks, only we don't  generally end up with a scuffle. I hope you will pardon us, Grace, but the  desire to shake that husky Egyptian reptile was irresistible.\"    \"There is nothing to pardon,\" replied Grace, \"and we have only thanks to  offer for the fun you have given us.\"    \"It was indeed a notable performance,\" agreed Nora.    \"Girls and boys,\" said Anne, \"it is almost ten o'clock and Grace ought to  be in bed. I move that we adjourn.\"    \"Second the motion,\" said David. \"We have been very selfish in keeping  poor Grace up when she is ill.\"    \"Poor Grace is glad you came, and isn't a bit tired,\" replied Grace,  looking fondly at her friends. \"You must all come to see me as often as  you can while I am laid up. I shall be pretty lonely for a few days.\"    The young folks departed,"]]]
