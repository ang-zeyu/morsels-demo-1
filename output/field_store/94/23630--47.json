[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16351"],[0,"Critical and Historical Essays (#8)"],[1," by  making seventy-two different arrangements of the scale by means  of sharps and flats, the only rule being that each degree of  the scale must be represented; for instance, one of the modes  _Dehrasan-Karabharna_ corresponds to our major scale. Our minor  (harmonic) scale figures as _Kyravani_. _Tanarupi_ corresponds  to the following succession of notes,        [G: c' d-' e--' f' g' a+' b' c'']    _Gavambodi_, to [G: c' d-' e-' f+' g' a-' b--' c'']    _Maya-Malavagaula_, to [G: c' d' e-' f' g-' a' b-' c'']    It can thus easily be seen how the seventy-two modes are  possible and practicable. Observe that the seven degrees of  the scale are all represented in these modes, the difference  between them being in the placing of half-tones by means of  sharps or flats. Not content with the complexity that this modal  system brought into their music, the Hindus have increased it  still more by inventing a number of formulae called _ragas_  (not to be confounded with those rhapsodical songs, the modern  descendant of the magic chants, previously mentioned).    In making a Hindu melody (which of course must be in one of  the seventy-two modes, just as in English we should say that a  melody must be in one of our two modes, either major or minor)  one would have to conform to one of the _ragas_, that is to  say, the melodic outline would have to conform to certain  rules, both in ascending and descending. These rules consist  of omitting notes of the modes, in one manner when the melody  ascends, and in another when it descends. Thus, in the _raga_  called _Mohanna_, in ascending the notes must be arranged in  the following order: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8; in descending it is 8,  7, 5, 4, 2, 1. Thus if we wished to write a melody in the mode  _Tanarupi_--_raga Mohanna_--we could never use the fourth,  F, or the seventh, B, if our melody ascended; if our melody  descended we should have to avoid the sixth, A[sharp], and the  third, E[double-flat]. As one can easily perceive, many strange  melodic effects are produced by these means. For instance,  in the _raga Mohanna_, in which the fourth and seventh degrees  of the scale are avoided in ascending, if it were employed in  the mode _Dehrasin-Karabharna_, which corresponds to our own  major scale, it would have a pronounced Scotch tinge so long  as the melody ascended; but let it _descend_ and the Scotch  element is deserted for a decided North American Indian,  notably Sioux tinge. The Hindus are an imaginative race, and  invest all these _ragas_ and modes with mysterious attributes,  such as anger, love, fear, and so on. They were even personified  as supernatural beings; each had his or her special name and  history. It was proper to use some of them only at midday,  some in the morning, and some at night. If the mode or _raga_  is changed during a piece, it is expressed in words, by saying,  for instance, that \"_Mohanna_\" (the new \"_raga_\") is here  introduced to the family of _Tanarupi_. The melodies formed  from these modes and _ragas_ are divided into four classes,  _Rektah_, _Teranah_, _Tuppah_, and _Ragni_. The _Rektah_ is in  character light and flowing. It falls naturally into regular  periods, and resembles the _Teranah_, with the exception that  the latter is only sung by men. The character of the _Tuppah_  is not very clear, but the _Ragni_ is a direct descendant  of the old magic songs and incantations; in character it is  rhapsodical and spasmodic.          IV    THE MUSIC OF THE EGYPTIANS, ASSYRIANS, AND CHINESE      In speaking of the music of antiquity we are seriously hampered  by the fact that there is practically no actual music in  existence which dates back farther than the eighth or tenth  century of the present era. Even those well-known specimens of  Greek music, as they are claimed to be, the hymns to Apollo,  Nemesis, and Calliope, do not date farther back than the third  or fourth century, and even these are by no means generally  considered authentic. Therefore, so far as actual sounds go,  all music of which we have any practical knowledge dates from  about the twelfth century.    Theoretically, we have the most minute knowledge of the  scientific aspect of music, dating from more than five hundred  years before the Christian era. This knowledge, however, is  worse than valueless, for it is misleading. For instance,  it would be a very difficult thing for posterity to form any  idea as to what our music was like if all the actual music in  the world at the present time were destroyed, and only certain  scientific works such as that of Helmholtz on acoustics and a  few theoretical treatises on harmony, form, counterpoint and  fugue were saved.    From Helmholtz's analysis of sounds one would get the idea  that the so-called tempered scale of our pianos caused thirds  and sixths to sound discordantly.    From the books on harmony one would gather that consecutive  fifths and octaves and a number of other things were never  indulged in by composers, and to cap the climax one would  naturally accept the harmony exercises contained in the books  as being the very acme of what we loved best in music. Thus  we see that any investigation into the music of antiquity must  be more or less conjectural.    Let us begin with the music of the Egyptians. The oldest  existing musical instrument of which we have any knowledge is  an Egyptian lyre to be found in the Berlin Royal Museum. It  is about four thousand years old, dating from the period just  before the expulsion of the Hyksos or \"Shepherd\" kings.    At that time (the beginning of the eighteenth dynasty, 1500-2000  B.C.) Egypt was just recovering from her five hundred years of  bondage, and music must already have reached a wonderful state  of development. In wall paintings of the eighteenth dynasty  we see flutes, double flutes, and harps of all sizes, from  the small one carried in the hand, to the great harps, almost  seven feet high, with twenty-one strings; the never-failing  sistrum (a kind of rattle); kitharas, the ancestors of our  modern guitars; lutes and lyres, the very first in the line  of instruments culminating in the modern piano.    One hesitates to class the trumpets of the Egyptians in the  same category, for they were war instruments, the tone of  which was probably always forced, for Herodotus says that  they sounded like the braying of a donkey. The fact that the  cheeks of the trumpeter were reinforced with leather straps  would further indicate that the instruments were used only  for loud signalling.    According to the mural paintings and sculptures in the tombs  of the Egyptians, all these instruments were played together,  and accompanied the voice. It has long been maintained that  harmony was unknown to the ancients because of the mathematical  measurement of sounds. This might be plausible for strings,  but pipes could be cut to any size. The positions of the hands  of the executants on the harps and lyres, as well as the use  of short and long pipes, make it appear probable that something  of what we call harmony was known to the Egyptians.    We must also consider that their paintings and sculptures were  eminently symbolic. When one carves an explanation in hard  granite it is apt to be done in shorthand, as it were. Thus, a  tree meant a forest, a prisoner meant a whole army; therefore,  two sculptured harpists or flute players may stand for twenty  or two hundred. Athenaeus, who lived at the end of the second  and beginning of the third century, A.D., speaks of orchestras  of six hundred in Ptolemy Philadelphus's time (300 B.C.),  and says that three hundred of the players were harpers, in  which number he probably includes players on other stringed  instruments, such as lutes and lyres. It is therefore to be  inferred that the other three hundred played wind and percussion  instruments. This is an additional reason for conjecturing  that they used chords in their music; for six hundred players,  not to count the singers, would hardly play entirely in unison  or in octaves. The very nature of the harp is chordal, and  the sculptures always depict the performer playing with both  hands, the fingers being more or less outstretched. That the  music must have been of a deep, sonorous character, we may  gather from the great size of the harps and the thickness of  their strings. As for the flutes, they also are pictured as  being very long; therefore they must have been low in pitch.  The reed pipes, judging from the pictures and sculptures,  were no higher in pitch than our oboes, of which the highest  note is D and E above the treble staff.    It is claimed that so far as the harps were concerned,  the music must have been strictly diatonic in character.  To quote Rowbotham, \"the harp, which was the foundation of the  Egyptian orchestra, is an essentially non-chromatic instrument,  and could therefore only play a straight up and down diatonic  scale.\" Continuing he says, \"It is plain therefore that the  Egyptian harmony was purely diatonic; such a thing as modern  modulation was unknown, and every piece from beginning to end  was played in the same key.\" That this position is utterly  untenable is very evident, for there was nothing to prevent  the Egyptians from tuning their harps in the same order of  tones and half tones as is used for our modern pianos. That  this is even probable may be assumed from the scale of a flute  dating back to the eighteenth or nineteenth century B.C. (1700  or 1600 B.C.), which was found in the royal tombs at Thebes,  and which is now in the Florence Museum.    Its scale was        [G: (a a+ b c' c+' d') (a' a+' b' c'' c+'' d'') (e'')          f'' f+'' g'' g+'' (a'' a+'' b'' c''' c+''' d''')]    The only thing about which we may be reasonably certain in  regard to Egyptian music is that, like Egyptian architecture,  it must have been very massive, on account of the preponderance  in the orchestra of the low tones of the stringed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16358"],[0,"The English Gipsies and Their Language (#8)"],[1,"now-a-days,\" replied the Gipsy, gloomily.  \"The business is  quite spiled, and not to get a livin' by.\"    \"Avo.  And by the time the people had almost gone crazy, one day there  came a man--a Gipsy--the first Gipsy who had ever been seen in _dovo tem_  (or that country).  And he agreed for a thousand crowns to clear all the  rats away.  So he blew on a pipe, and the rats all followed him out of  town.\"    \"What did he blow on a pipe for?\"    \"Just for _hokkerben_, to humbug them.  I suppose he had oils rubbed on  his heels.  But when he had drawn the rats away and asked for his money,  they would not give it to him.  So then, what do you think he did?\"    \"I suppose--ah, I see,\" said the Gipsy, with a shrewd look.  \"He went and  drew 'em all back again.\"    \"No; he went, and this time piped all the children away.  They all went  after him--all except one little lame boy--and that was the last of it.\"    The Gipsy looked earnestly at me, and then, as if I puzzled, but with an  expression of perfect faith, he asked--    \"And is that all _tacho_--all a fact--or is it made up, you know?\"    \"Well, I think it is partly one and partly the other.  You see, that in  those days Gipsies were very scarce, and people were very much astonished  at rat-drawing, and so they made a queer story of it.\"    \"But how about the children?\"    \"Well,\" I answered; \"I suppose you have heard occasionally that Gipsies  used to chore Gorgios' chavis--steal people's children?\"    Very grave indeed was the assent yielded to this explanation.  He _had_  heard it among other things.    My dear Mr Robert Browning, I little thought, when I suggested to the  artist your poem of the piper, that I should ever retail the story in  Rommany to a tinker.  But who knows with whom he may associate in this  life, or whither he may drift on the great white rolling sea of humanity?  Did not Lord Lytton, unless the preface to Pelham err, himself once tarry  in the tents of the Egyptians? and did not Christopher North also wander  with them, and sing--       \"Oh, little did my mother think,        The day she cradled me,     The lands that I should travel in,        Or the death that I should dee;     Or gae rovin' about wi' tinkler loons,        And sic-like companie\"?    \"You know, sir,\" said the Gipsy, \"that we have two languages.  For  besides the Rummany, there's the reg'lar cant, which all tinkers talk.\"    \"_Kennick_ you mean?\"    \"Yes, sir; that's the Rummany for it.  A 'dolly mort' is Kennick, but  it's _juva_ or _rakli_ in Rummanis.  It's a girl, or a rom's _chi_.\"    \"You say _rom_ sometimes, and then _rum_.\"    \"There's _rums_ and _roms_, sir.  The _rum_ is a Gipsy, and a _rom_ is a  husband.\"    \"That's your English way of calling it.  All the rest of the world over  there is only one word among Gipsies, and that is _rom_.\"    Now, the allusion to _Kennick_ or cant by a tinker, recalls an incident  which, though not strictly Gipsy in its nature, I will nevertheless  narrate.    In the summer of 1870 I spent several weeks at Spa, in the Ardennes.  One  day while walking I saw by the roadside a picturesque old tinker, looking  neither better nor worse than the grinder made immortal by Teniers.    I was anxious to know if all of his craft in Belgium could speak Gipsy,  and addressed him in that language, giving him at the same time my knife  to grind.  He replied politely in French that he did not speak Rommany,  and only understood French and Walloon.  Yet he seemed to understand  perfectly the drift of my question, and to know what Gipsy was, and its  nature, since after a pause he added, with a significant smile--    \"But to tell the truth, monsieur, though I cannot talk Rommany, I know  another secret language.  I can speak _Argot_ fluently.\"    Now, I retain in my memory, from reading the Memoirs of Vidocq thirty  years ago, one or two phrases of this French thieves' slang, and I at  once replied that I knew a few words of it myself, adding--    \"_Tu sais jaspiner en bigorne_?\"--you can talk argot?    \"_Oui, monsieur_.\"    \"_Et tu vas roulant de vergne en vergne_?\"--and you go about from town to  town?    Grave and keen, and with a queer smile, the tinker replied, very slowly--    \"Monsieur knows the Gipsies\" (here he shook his head), \"and monsieur  speaks _argot_ very well.\"  (A shrug.)  \"Perhaps he knows more than he  credits himself with.  Perhaps\" (and here his wink was diabolical)--  \"_perhaps monsieur knows the entire tongue_!\"    Spa is full not only of gamblers, but of numbers of well-dressed Parisian  sharpers who certainly know \"the entire tongue.\"  I hastened to pay my  tinker, and went my way homewards.  Ross Browne was accused in Syria of  having \"burgled\" onions, and the pursuit of philology has twice subjected  me to be suspected by tinkers as a flourishing member of the \"dangerous  classes.\"    But to return to my rat-catcher.  As I quoted a verse of German Gipsy  song, he manifested an interest in it, and put me several questions with  regard to the race in other lands.    \"I wish I was a rich gentleman.  I would like to travel like you, sir,  and have nothing to do but go about from land to land, looking after our  Rummany people as you do, and learnin' everything Rummany.  Is it true,  sir, we come from Egypt?\"    \"No.  I think not.  There are Gipsies in Egypt, but there is less Rommany  in their _jib_ (language) than in any other Gipsy tribe in the world.  The  Gipsies came from India.\"    \"And don't you think, sir, that we're of the children of the lost Ten  Tribes?\"    \"I am quite sure that you never had a drop of blood in common with them.  Tell me, do you know any Gipsy _gilis_--any songs?\"    \"Only a bit of a one, sir; most of it isn't fit to sing, but it begins--\"    And here he sang:       \"Jal 'dree the ker my honey,     And you shall be my rom.\"    And chanting this, after thanking me, he departed, gratified with his  gratuity, rejoiced at his reception, and most undoubtedly benefited by  the beer with which I had encouraged his palaver--a word, by the way,  which is not inappropriate, since it contains in itself the very word of  words, the _lav_, which means a word, and is most antiquely and  excellently Gipsy.  Pehlevi is old Persian, and to _pen lavi_ is Rommany  all the world over \"to speak words.\"          CHAPTER IV.  GIPSY RESPECT FOR THE DEAD.      Gipsies and Comteists identical as to \"Religion\"--Singular Manner of  Mourning for the Dead, as practised by Gipsies--Illustrations from  Life--Gipsy Job and the Cigars--Oaths by the Dead--Universal Gipsy Custom  of never Mentioning the Names of the Dead--Burying valuable Objects with  the Dead--Gipsies, Comteists, Hegelians, and Jews--The Rev. James Crabbe.    Comte, the author of the Positivist philosophy, never felt the need of a  religion until he had fallen in love; and at the present day his \"faith\"  appears to consist in a worship of the great and wise and good among the  dead.  I have already spoken of many Gipsies reminding me, by their  entirely unconscious ungodliness, of thorough Hegelians.  I may now add,  that, like the Positivists, they seem to correct their irreligion through  the influence of love; and by a strange custom, which is, in spirit and  fact, nothing less than adoring the departed and offering to the dead a  singular sacrifice.    He who has no house finds a home in family and friends, whence it results  that the Gipsy, despite his ferocious quarrels in the clan, and his sharp  practice even with near relations, is--all things considered--perhaps the  most devoted to kith and kin of any one in the world.  His very name--rom,  a husband--indicates it.  His children, as almost every writer on him,  from Grellmann down to the present day, has observed, are more thoroughly  indulged and spoiled than any non-gipsy can conceive; and despite all the  apparent contradictions caused by the selfishness born of poverty,  irritable Eastern blood, and the eccentricity of semi-civilisation, I  doubt if any man, on the whole, in the world, is more attached to his  own.    It was only three or four hours ago, as I write, on the fifth day of  February 1872, that a Gipsy said to me, \"It is nine years since my wife  died, and I would give all Anglaterra to have her again.\"    That the real religion of the Gipsies, as I have already observed,  consists like that of the Comteists, in devotion to the dead, is  indicated by a very extraordinary custom, which, notwithstanding the very  general decay, of late years, of all their old habits, still prevails  universally.  This is the refraining from some usage or indulgence in  honour of the departed--a sacrifice, as it were, to their _manes_--and I  believe that, by inquiring, it will be found to exist among all Gipsies  in all parts of the world.  In England it is shown by observances which  are maintained at great personal inconvenience, sometime for years, or  during life.  Thus, there are many Gipsies who, because a deceased  brother was fond of spirits, have refrained, after his departure, from  tasting them, or who have given up their favourite pursuits, for the  reason that they were last indulged in, in company with the lost and  loved one.    As a further illustration, I will give in the original Gipsy-language, as  I myself took it down rapidly, but literally, the comments of a  full-blooded Gipsy on this custom--the translation being annexed.  I  should state that the narrative which precedes his comments was a reply  to my question, Why he invariably declined my offer of cigars?    \"No; I never toovs cigaras, kek.  I never toovs 'em kenna since my pal's  chavo Job mullered.  And I'll pooker tute how it welled.\"    \"It was at the boro wellgooro where the graias prasters.
