Sir: Your request of August 7 for a report concerning a    recommendation by Reverend Isaac T. Whittemore, under date of July    25, that provision be made for further protecting Casa Grande ruin,    near Florence, Arizona, by the erection of a suitable roof, has been    under consideration.      In many respects Casa Grande ruin is one of the most noteworthy    relics of a prehistoric age and people remaining within the limits    of the United States. It was discovered, already in a ruinous    condition, by Padre Kino in 1694, and since that time it has been a    subject of record by explorers and historians. Thus its history is    exceptionally extended and complete. By reason of its early    discovery and its condition when first seen by white men, it is    known that Casa Grande is a strictly aboriginal structure; and    archeologic researches in this country and Mexico afford grounds for    considering it a typical structure for its times and for the natives    of the southwestern region. Many other structures were mentioned or    described by the Spanish explorers, but the impressions of these    explorers were tinctured by previous experience in an inhospitable    region, and their descriptions were tinged by the romantic ideas of    the age; very few of these structures were within the limits of the    United States, and nearly all of these situated in the neighboring    republic of Mexico disappeared long ago; there is hardly a structure    left, except Casa Grande ruin, by which the early accounts of    Spanish explorers in North America can be checked and    interpreted--none other of its class exists in the United States.    Casa Grande ruin is, therefore, a relic of exceptional importance    and of essentially unique character.      Unfortunately this structure, like others erected by the most    advanced among the native races in the southwest, is of perishable    material; it is built of adobe, or rather of cajon, i.e., of a    puddled clay, molded into walls, dried in the sun. Such walls would    stand a short time only in humid regions; but in the arid region the    material is desiccated and baked under cloudless sky and sun for    many months at a time, and becomes so hard as to resist, fairly, the    rare storms of the region. It is by reason of climatal conditions    that cajon and adobe have come into general use for building in    southwestern United States, as in contiguous parts of Mexico; and it    is by reason of the same conditions that a few of the ancient    structures remain, and the best preserved of all is found in the    Gila valley, one of the most desert regions on the western    hemisphere. Yet the best of the cajon structures is perishable; so    long as the roof remains and the summits of the walls are protected,    disintegration proceeds slowly; but when the projecting roof is    removed, the rare but violent storms attack the walls, and they are    gradually channeled and gullied by the storm waters, while the    exterior surface gradually disintegrates and falls away under the    alternate wetting and drying. Even in the most arid regions, the    earth-built structures typical of the southwest are surely, albeit    slowly, ravaged and destroyed.      Several years ago Casa Grande ruin was brought into general notice    throughout the United States in consequence of southwestern    explorations; and in 1889, in response to a petition from several    illustrious Americans, the Congress of the United States, at the    instance of Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, made an appropriation of    $2,000 for the purpose of undertaking the preservation of this ruin.    This appropriation was expended in works urgently required to    prevent the falling of the walls and final destruction of the ruin;    they included metal stays for the walls, with brickwork for the    support and protection of the walls at their bases. Subsequently an    area of about 480 acres, including the ruin, was reserved from    settlement by Executive order. A custodian was also appointed, and,    as this office has been informed, has been continued down to the    present. This action on the part of the legislative and executive    branches of the Government can only be regarded as indicating a    desire and continued intention to preserve the ruin for the benefit    of the people of the United States.      The expenditures thus far authorized for the preservation of Casa    Grande ruin have been made in such manner as to meet the most urgent    needs only, and without them the structure would probably have been,    before this time, beyond the reach of preservation. The preservative    works were undertaken as emergency measures, rather than as steps in    carrying out a well-considered plan. From the outset it has been    understood by architects and archeologists and others familiar with    the structure that preservation can be insured only by throwing a    roof over the entire ruin in such manner as to protect the walls    from the fierce rainstorms which occasionally occur in the Gila    valley. No lesser work will preserve the ruin more than a generation    or two; and unless this work of roofing is contemplated and is    undertaken within a few years, the emergency work will be of little    avail and the money expended therein will be lost. Accordingly,    assuming a desire and continued intention on the part of the    Government to preserve this noteworthy relic, no hesitation is felt    in recommending that a suitable roof be placed over Casa Grande    ruin, at such time as may be expedient; and, in view of the rapidity    with which destruction is now in progress, there is no hesitation in    saying that the work should be undertaken at the earliest    practicable date.      It should be added that neither the Director nor any of the    collaborators in the Bureau of American Ethnology have visited Casa    Grande ruin for some three years, and accordingly that there are no    data in this office to indicate whether there is especially urgent    necessity for undertaking preservative work at this time; but much    confidence is placed in the judgment of the custodian, Reverend    Isaac T. Whittemore, who is known to several collaborators in the    Bureau.      The subject of the preservation of Casa Grande, in many respects the    most noteworthy ruin in the United States, is deemed important; and    if the Secretary of the Interior desires more specific information    concerning the present condition of the ruin, as a basis for further    action or judgment, it will be a pleasure to have an officer of this    Bureau make a special examination of, and report on, the ruin during    the autumn.      I have the honor to be, yours, with great respect,      W J McGee, _Acting Director_.        The Secretary of the Interior.

The Director of the Bureau of American Ethnology,                _Smithsonian Institution_.      Dear Sir: I am in receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo    submitting a report upon the recommendation made by the Reverend    Isaac T. Whittemore, custodian, that provision be made for further    protection of the Casa Grande ruin near Florence, Arizona, by the    erection of a suitable roof.      In response thereto I have to state that more specific information    concerning the present condition of the ruin and the probable cost    of providing proper protection for it is desirable in the    preparation of an estimate to be submitted to Congress with a view    of securing appropriation for the work. To this end the Department    gladly avails itself of your offer to send an officer of your    Bureau, at its expense, to make a special examination and report on    the ruin during the autumn of this year.      Very respectfully,        John M. Reynolds,            _Acting Secretary_.

The moment I left, I heard the laughing  again, with fresh protests from the house.  I returned with a municipal  guard, who turned them out.  They protested, still laughing, saying  they would not go unless they had their money back.  At last, they  became quiet and I allowed them to enter the box again.  The laughter  at once recommenced; and, this time, I had them turned out definitely.    \"Send for the inspector,\" said Richard to his secretary, who had  already read the report and marked it with blue pencil.    M. Remy, the secretary, had foreseen the order and called the inspector  at once.    \"Tell us what happened,\" said Richard bluntly.    The inspector began to splutter and referred to the report.    \"Well, but what were those people laughing at?\" asked Moncharmin.    \"They must have been dining, sir, and seemed more inclined to lark  about than to listen to good music.  The moment they entered the box,  they came out again and called the box-keeper, who asked them what they  wanted.  They said, 'Look in the box:  there's no one there, is there?'  'No,' said the woman.  'Well,' said they, 'when we went in, we heard a  voice saying THAT THE BOX WAS TAKEN!'\"    M. Moncharmin could not help smiling as he looked at M. Richard; but M.  Richard did not smile.  He himself had done too much in that way in his  time not to recognize, in the inspector's story, all the marks of one  of those practical jokes which begin by amusing and end by enraging the  victims.  The inspector, to curry favor with M. Moncharmin, who was  smiling, thought it best to give a smile too.  A most unfortunate  smile!  M. Richard glared at his subordinate, who thenceforth made it  his business to display a face of utter consternation.    \"However, when the people arrived,\" roared Richard, \"there was no one  in the box, was there?\"    \"Not a soul, sir, not a soul!  Nor in the box on the right, nor in the  box on the left: not a soul, sir, I swear!  The box-keeper told it me  often enough, which proves that it was all a joke.\"    \"Oh, you agree, do you?\" said Richard.  \"You agree!  It's a joke!  And  you think it funny, no doubt?\"    \"I think it in very bad taste, sir.\"    \"And what did the box-keeper say?\"    \"Oh, she just said that it was the Opera ghost.  That's all she said!\"    And the inspector grinned.  But he soon found that he had made a  mistake in grinning, for the words had no sooner left his mouth than M.  Richard, from gloomy, became furious.    \"Send for the box-keeper!\" he shouted.  \"Send for her!  This minute!  This minute!  And bring her in to me here!  And turn all those people  out!\"    The inspector tried to protest, but Richard closed his mouth with an  angry order to hold his tongue.  Then, when the wretched man's lips  seemed shut for ever, the manager commanded him to open them once more.    \"Who is this 'Opera ghost?'\" he snarled.    But the inspector was by this time incapable of speaking a word.  He  managed to convey, by a despairing gesture, that he knew nothing about  it, or rather that he did not wish to know.    \"Have you ever seen him, have you seen the Opera ghost?\"    The inspector, by means of a vigorous shake of the head, denied ever  having seen the ghost in question.    \"Very well!\" said M. Richard coldly.    The inspector's eyes started out of his head, as though to ask why the  manager had uttered that ominous \"Very well!\"    \"Because I'm going to settle the account of any one who has not seen  him!\" explained the manager.  \"As he seems to be everywhere, I can't  have people telling me that they see him nowhere.  I like people to  work for me when I employ them!\"    Having said this, M. Richard paid no attention to the inspector and  discussed various matters of business with his acting-manager, who had  entered the room meanwhile.  The inspector thought he could go and was  gently--oh, so gently!--sidling toward the door, when M. Richard nailed  the man to the floor with a thundering:    \"Stay where you are!\"    M. Remy had sent for the box-keeper to the Rue de Provence, close to  the Opera, where she was engaged as a porteress.  She soon made her  appearance.    \"What's your name?\"    \"Mme. Giry.  You know me well enough, sir; I'm the mother of little  Giry, little Meg, what!\"    This was said in so rough and solemn a tone that, for a moment, M.  Richard was impressed.  He looked at Mme. Giry, in her faded shawl, her  worn shoes, her old taffeta dress and dingy bonnet.  It was quite  evident from the manager's attitude, that he either did not know or  could not remember having met Mme. Giry, nor even little Giry, nor even  \"little Meg!\"  But Mme. Giry's pride was so great that the celebrated  box-keeper imagined that everybody knew her.    \"Never heard of her!\" the manager declared.  \"But that's no reason,  Mme. Giry, why I shouldn't ask you what happened last night to make you  and the inspector call in a municipal guard.\"    \"I was just wanting to see you, sir, and talk to you about it, so that  you mightn't have the same unpleasantness as M. Debienne and M.  Poligny.  They wouldn't listen to me either, at first.\"    \"I'm not asking you about all that.  I'm asking what happened last  night.\"    Mme. Giry turned purple with indignation.  Never had she been spoken to  like that.  She rose as though to go, gathering up the folds of her  skirt and waving the feathers of her dingy bonnet with dignity, but,  changing her mind, she sat down again and said, in a haughty voice:    \"I'll tell you what happened.  The ghost was annoyed again!\"    Thereupon, as M. Richard was on the point of bursting out, M.  Moncharmin interfered and conducted the interrogatory, whence it  appeared that Mme. Giry thought it quite natural that a voice should be  heard to say that a box was taken, when there was nobody in the box.  She was unable to explain this phenomenon, which was not new to her,  except by the intervention of the ghost.  Nobody could see the ghost in  his box, but everybody could hear him.  She had often heard him; and  they could believe her, for she always spoke the truth.  They could ask  M. Debienne and M. Poligny, and anybody who knew her; and also M.  Isidore Saack, who had had a leg broken by the ghost!    \"Indeed!\" said Moncharmin, interrupting her.  \"Did the ghost break poor  Isidore Saack's leg?\"    Mme. Giry opened her eyes with astonishment at such ignorance.  However, she consented to enlighten those two poor innocents.  The  thing had happened in M. Debienne and M. Poligny's time, also in Box  Five and also during a performance of FAUST.  Mme. Giry coughed,  cleared her throat--it sounded as though she were preparing to sing the  whole of Gounod's score--and began:    \"It was like this, sir.  That night, M. Maniera and his lady, the  jewelers in the Rue Mogador, were sitting in the front of the box, with  their great friend, M. Isidore Saack, sitting behind Mme. Maniera.  Mephistopheles was singing\"--Mme. Giry here burst into song  herself--\"'Catarina, while you play at sleeping,' and then M. Maniera  heard a voice in his right ear (his wife was on his left) saying, 'Ha,  ha!  Julie's not playing at sleeping!'  His wife happened to be called  Julie.  So.  M. Maniera turns to the right to see who was talking to  him like that.  Nobody there!  He rubs his ear and asks himself, if  he's dreaming.  Then Mephistopheles went on with his serenade...  But,  perhaps I'm boring you gentlemen?\"    \"No, no, go on.\"    \"You are too good, gentlemen,\" with a smirk.  \"Well, then,  Mephistopheles went on with his serenade\"--Mme. Giry, burst into song  again--\"'Saint, unclose thy portals holy and accord the bliss, to a  mortal bending lowly, of a pardon-kiss.' And then M. Maniera again  hears the voice in his right ear, saying, this time, 'Ha, ha!  Julie  wouldn't mind according a kiss to Isidore!'  Then he turns round again,  but, this time, to the left; and what do you think he sees?  Isidore,  who had taken his lady's hand and was covering it with kisses through  the little round place in the glove--like this, gentlemen\"--rapturously  kissing the bit of palm left bare in the middle of her thread gloves.  \"Then they had a lively time between them!  Bang!  Bang!  M. Maniera,  who was big and strong, like you, M. Richard, gave two blows to M.  Isidore Saack, who was small and weak like M. Moncharmin, saving his  presence.  There was a great uproar.  People in the house shouted,  'That will do!  Stop them!  He'll kill him!'  Then, at last, M. Isidore  Saack managed to run away.\"    \"Then the ghost had not broken his leg?\" asked M. Moncharmin, a little  vexed that his figure had made so little impression on Mme. Giry.    \"He did break it for him, sir,\" replied Mme. Giry haughtily.  \"He broke  it for him on the grand staircase, which he ran down too fast, sir, and  it will be long before the poor gentleman will be able to go up it  again!\"    \"Did the ghost tell you what he said in M. Maniera's right ear?\" asked  M. Moncharmin, with a gravity which he thought exceedingly humorous.    \"No, sir, it was M. Maniera himself.  So----\"    \"But you have spoken to the ghost, my good lady?\"    \"As I'm speaking to you now, my good sir!\"  Mme. Giry replied.    \"And, when the ghost speaks to you, what does he say?\"    \"Well, he tells me to bring him a footstool!\"    This time, Richard burst out laughing, as did Moncharmin and Remy, the  secretary.  Only the inspector, warned by experience, was careful not  to laugh, while Mme. Giry ventured to adopt an attitude that was  positively threatening.    \"Instead of laughing,\" she cried indignantly, \"you'd do better to do as  M. Poligny did, who found out for himself.\"    \"Found out about what?\" asked Moncharmin, who had never been so much  amused in his life.    \"About the ghost, of course! ... Look here ...\"    She suddenly calmed herself, feeling that this was a solemn moment in  her life:    \"LOOK HERE,\" she repeated.  \""]]]
