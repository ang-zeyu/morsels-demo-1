Memorizing nosological facts without an understanding of underlying  principles is of no more practical benefit for qualification as a  diagnostician in cases of lameness, than is the employment of similar  methods in the study of theory and practice. A knowledge of the dosage  of drugs does not in itself qualify one as being competent to administer  such therapeutic agents to a proper effect. How much is a practitioner  benefited by the knowledge that a high temperature is usually present in  septic intoxication, if he is not possessed of a scientific  understanding of anatomy, physiology, bacteriology and pathology, as  well as the principles of clinical diagnosis?    In order to determine the reasons for certain symptoms manifested by the  subject, an analysis of these symptoms is the proper method of  procedure, insofar as this is possible. If one may reason that an animal  assumes a certain position while at rest to allow relaxation of an  inflamed tendon or ligament, such a fact enables the diagnostician to  recall that this is indicative of some specific ailment. In acute  tendinitis, the subject while at rest, maintains the affected member in  volar flexion because this position permits relaxation of the inhibitory  apparatus, including the inflamed tendon. Likewise, the various abnormal  positions assumed,--adduction, abduction, undue flexion or  pointing--have their own significance and are taken into account by the  trained diagnostician in the course of an examination.    In the examination of lame subjects, where the cause is not obvious, a  systematic method of diagnosis is pursued even by the most expert  practitioners. In all obscure cases of lameness a methodical and  thoroughly practical examination of the animal according to an  established procedure is necessary to determine the nature and source of  the affliction.      Anamnesis.    The first thing to be given consideration in diagnosis is the fact that  related history of the case is not always dependable, because of lack of  accurate observation or wilful deceit on the part of the owner or  attendant. The successful veterinarian soon acquires the faculty of  obtaining information in a manner best adapted to his client,--either by  direct interrogation or by subtle means of suggestion, and in this way  he draws out evaded facts essential to his diagnosis. In time he learns  to make allowance for misstatements made to shield the owner or driver  and to hide the facts of apparent neglect or abuse that the subject may  have experienced. A suppurating cartilaginous quittor, complicated by  the presence of a large amount of hyperplastic tissue, cannot be  successfully represented to be an acute and recently developed  affection, where a trained practitioner is left to judge the validity of  the statement.    In complicated conditions, where there is evident a chronic disturbance  which could not be conceived as sufficient cause for a marked  manifestation of lameness, accurate history of the case may be of great  aid in arriving at a diagnosis. An aged animal, having recently become  very lame, showing a small exostosis on the first phalanx, and with the  history given that the osseous deposit was of long standing, should at  once lead the veterinarian to seek the source of trouble elsewhere.      Visual Examination.    As in all diagnostic work, a careful visual examination of the subject  should be made before it is approached. The novice is given to hasty  examination by palpation, not realizing how much may be revealed by a  careful scrutiny of the subject. In this way he is led to erroneous  conclusions which the skilled diagnostician has learned from experience  to avoid. _Too much emphasis cannot be placed on the importance of  making a thoughtful visual examination in every instance before the  subject is approached._ In this examination, type, conformation and  temperament are taken into account at once, for each of these qualities  is in itself, a determining factor in predisposing a subject to certain  ailments or inherent attributes, which may exert a favorable or  unfavorable influence upon existing conditions and thus make recovery  probable or otherwise.    Draft animals are less likely to be permanently incapacitated as a  result of tendinitis, than are thoroughbreds. Likewise, one would not  expect to find this affection present in heavy harness horses as  frequently as in light harness animals.    Mal-formation of a part, or an asymmetrical development of the body as a  whole, may render an animal susceptible to certain affections which  cause lameness. A \"tied in\" hock predisposes the subject to curb, and an  animal having powerful and well-developed hips and imperfectly formed  hocks, will, if subjected to heavy work, be a favorable subject for bone  spavin.    The matter of temperament cannot be disregarded in diagnosis, for in  some instances, it is the chief determining factor which materially  influences the outcome of the case. A nervous, excitable animal, that is  kept at hard work, may, under some conditions, be expected to experience  disturbances which more lethargic subjects escape. Nervous subjects, it  is known, are more prone to azoturia than are those of lymphatic  temperament. Furthermore, the lymphatic subject often recovers from  certain bone fractures which are successfully treated only when the  animal is sufficiently resigned by nature to remain confined in a sling  for weeks without resistance.    The physiognomy of a subject is often indicative of the gravity of its  condition. The facial expression of an animal suffering the throes of  tetanus, azoturia, or acute synovitis, is readily recognized by the  experienced eye, and upon physiognomy alone, in many instances, may the  opinions regarding prognosis be based. Particularly is this true where  death is a matter of minutes, or at most is only a few hours distant.    Due allowance should be made for restiveness manifested by some more  nervous animals when the surroundings are strange and unusual. In such  instances, even pathognomic symptoms may be masked to the extent that  little, if any, sign of pain or malaise is evinced. In these cases the  subject should be given sufficient time to adjust itself to the new  environment, or it should be removed to a more suitable place for  examination. Animals quickly detect the note of friendly reassurance in  the human voice and can very often be calmed by being spoken to.    By visual examination one may detect the presence of various swellings  or enlargements, such as characterize bruises and strains of tendons  where inflammation is acute. Inflammation of the plantar  (calcaneocuboid) ligament in curb is readily detected when the affected  member is viewed in profile. Spavin, ringbone, splints, quittor and many  other anomalous conditions may all be observed from certain proper  angles.    The fact that the skins of most animals are pigmented and covered with  hair, precludes the easy detection of erythema by visual examination,  consequently this indicator of possible inflammation is not often made  use of in the examination of equine subjects.      Attitude of the Subject.    The position assumed while the subject is in repose, is often  characteristic of certain affections and this, of course, is noted at  once. The manner in which the weight is borne by the animal at rest,  should attract the attention of the diagnostician and if the attitude of  the subject is abnormal or peculiar, the examiner tries to determine the  reason for it. If weight-bearing causes symptoms of pain, the affected  member will invariably be favored and held in some one of a number of  positions. The foot may contact the ground squarely and yet the leg may  remain relaxed and free from pressure; volar flexion, in such cases, is  indicative of inflammation of a part of the flexor apparatus. If the  condition be very painful, position of the afflicted member is  frequently shifted, but in all cases where the pain is not so keenly  felt, the inflamed member is held in a state of relaxation. There is  need then, for a knowledge of anatomy and certain principles in physics  to enable the observer to determine just which structures are purposely  eased in this manner. Where palpation of parts is possible, one does not  need to depend on visual examination alone, and it is always wise to  take into consideration every factor that may influence conditions.  Manipulation or palpation of the structures thought to be involved,  should not be resorted to until a careful and thorough observation of  the subject has revealed all that it can reveal to the diagnostician.    In all conditions where extreme pain is manifested by the constant  desire of the animal to keep its foot in motion off the ground,  examination should be made for local cause. This is seen in certain  septic inflammations of the feet such as those caused by nail punctures  invading the navicular joint, or in newly made wounds where nerves have  been divided and the proximal end of such a nerve is exposed to pressure  or irritation.    \"Pointing\" affords a comfortable position in some cases of navicular  disease, and in a unilateral affection, one may observe the subject  bearing weight with one sound member, while the affected foot is planted  well ahead of the sound one. In a bilateral involvement of this kind,  weight may be frequently shifted from one foot to the other, or in  chronic cases, where no marked pain is experienced, the subject stands  squarely upon both front feet and no peculiar shifting of weight or  pointing is evident.    In some cases of hip or shoulder involvement, complete relaxation of all  parts of the affected member may be noticed. In brachial paralysis, the  pectoral member is held limply; if the patient is made to move, it is  evident there is lack of innervation to the afflicted part. In some  cases where"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16378"],[0,"The Art of Perfumery, and Methods of Obtaining the Odors of Plants (#8)"],[1," We hope that those of our readers who feel inclined to try experiments  of this nature will not be deterred by saying, \"they are not worth the  trouble.\" It must be remembered, that very fine essences realize in the  London perfumery warehouses 16_s._ per pint of 16 ounces, and that fine  _flowery-scented_ pomades fetch the same sum per pound. If the  experiments are successful they should be published, as then we may hope  to establish a new and important manufacture in this country. But we are  digressing.    The odor of heliotrope resembles a mixture of almonds and vanilla, and  is well imitated thus:--    EXTRACT OF HELIOTROPE.    Spirituous extract of vanilla,               1/2 pint.       \"       \"    French rose pomatum,       1/4   \"       \"       \"    orange-flower pomatum,         2 oz.       \"       \"    ambergris,                     1 oz.  Essential oil of almonds,                     5 drops.    A preparation made in this manner under the name of _Extract de  Heliotrope_ is that which is sold in the shops of Paris and London, and  is really a very nice perfume, passing well with the public for a  genuine extract of heliotrope.    HONEYSUCKLE or WOODBINE:--        \"Copious of flower the woodbine, pale and wan,      But well compensating her sickly looks      With never-cloying odors.\"    What the poet Cowper here says is quite true; nevertheless, it is a  flower that is not used in practical perfumery, though there is no  reason for abandoning it. The experiments suggested for obtaining the  odor of Heliotrope and Millefleur (thousand flowers) are also applicable  to this, as also to Hawthorn. A good IMITATION OF HONEYSUCKLE  is made thus:--    Spirituous extract of rose pomatum,     1 pint.                \"   \"   violet    \"       1 \"                \"   \"   tubereuse \"       1 \"  Extract of vanilla,                   1/4 \"         \"   Tolu,                      1/4 \"  Otto neroli,                          10 drops.     \" almonds,                          5    \"    The prime cost of a perfume made in this manner would probably be too  high to meet the demand of a retail druggist; in such cases it may be  diluted with rectified spirit to the extent \"to make it pay,\" and will  yet be a nice perfume. The formula generally given herein for odors is  in anticipation that when bottled they will retail for at least  eighteen-pence the fluid ounce! which is the average price put on the  finest perfumery by the manufacturers of London and Paris.    HOVENIA.--A perfume under this name is sold to a limited  extent, but if it did not smell better than the plant _Hovenia dulcis_  or _H. inequalis_, a native of Japan, it would not sell at all. The  article in the market is made thus:--    Rectified spirit,        1 quart.  Rose-water,             1/2 pint.  Otto lemons,              1/2 oz.  Otto of rose,           1 drachm.        \" cloves,          1/2 \"        \" neroli,         10 drops.    First dissolve the ottos in the spirit, then add the rose-water. After  filtration it is ready for sale. When compounds of this kind do not  become bright by passing through blotting-paper, the addition of a  little carbonate of magnesia prior to filtering effectually clears them.  The water in the above recipe is only added in order that the article  produced may be retailed at a moderate price, and would, of course, be  better without that \"universal friend.\"    JASMINE.--                        \"Luxuriant above all,      The jasmine throwing wide her elegant sweets.\"    This flower is one of the most prized by the perfumer. Its odor is  delicate and sweet, and so peculiar that it is without comparison, and  as such cannot be imitated. When the flowers of the _Jasminum  odoratissimum_ are distilled, repeatedly using the water of  distillation over fresh flowers, the essential oil of jasmine may be  procured. It is, however, exceedingly rare, on account of the enormous  cost of production. There was a fine sample of six ounces exhibited in  the Tunisian department of the Crystal Palace, the price of which was  9_l._ the fluid ounce! The plant is the Yasmyn of the Arabs, from which  our name is derived.    In the perfumer's laboratory, the method of obtaining the odor is by  absorption, or, as the French term it, _enfleurage_; that is, by  spreading a mixture of pure lard and suet on a glass tray, and sticking  the fresh-gathered flowers all over it, leaving them to stand a day or  so, and repeating the operation with fresh flowers--the grease absorbs  the odor. Finally, the pomade is scraped off the glass or slate, melted  at as low a temperature as possible, and strained.    Oils strongly impregnated with the fragrance are also prepared much in  the same way. Layers of cotton wool, previously steeped in oil of ben  (obtained by pressure from the blanched nuts of the _Moringa oleifera_)  are covered with jasmine flowers, which is repeated several times;  finally, the cotton or linen cloths which some perfumers use, are  squeezed under a press. The jasmine oil thus produced is the _Huile  antique au jasmin_ of the French houses.    The \"extract of jasmine\" is prepared by pouring rectified spirit on the  jasmine pomade or oil, and allowing them to remain together for a  fortnight at a summer heat. The best quality extract requires two  pounds of pomatum to every quart of spirit. The same can be done with  the oil of jasmine. If the pomade is used, it must be cut up fine  previously to being put into the spirit; if the oil is used, it must be  shaken well together every two or more hours, otherwise, on account of  its specific gravity, the oil separates, and but little surface is  exposed to the spirit. After the extract is strained off, the \"washed\"  pomatum or oil is still useful, if remelted, in the composition of  pomatum for the hair, and gives more satisfaction to a customer than any  of the \"creams and balms,\" &c. &c., made up and scented with essential  oils; the one smells of the flower, the other \"a nondescript.\"    [Illustration: Jasmine.]    The extract of jasmine enters into the composition of a great many of  the most approved handkerchief perfumes sold by the English and French  perfumers. Extract of jasmine is sold for the handkerchief often pure,  but is one of those scents which, though very gratifying at first,  becomes what people call \"sickly\" after exposure to the oxidizing  influence of the air, but if judiciously mixed with other perfumes of an  opposite character is sure to please the most fastidious customer.    JONQUIL.--The scent of the jonquil is very beautiful; for  perfumery purposes it is however but little cultivated in comparison  with jasmine and tubereuse. It is prepared exactly as jasmine. The  Parisian perfumers sell a mixture which they call \"extract of jonquil.\"  The plant, however, only plays the part of a godfather to the offspring,  giving it its name. The so-called jonquil is made thus:--    Spirituous extract of jasmine pomade,           1 pint.  \"           \"         tubereuse \"               1 \"  \"           \"         fleur d'orange,         1/2 \"  Extract of vanilla,                     2 fluid ounces.    LAUREL.--By distillation from the berries of the _Laurus  nobilis_, and from the leaves of the _Laurus cerasus_, an oil and  perfumed water are procurable of a very beautiful and fragrant  character. Commercially, however, it is disregarded, as from the  similarity of odor to the oil distilled from the bitter almond, it is  rarely, if ever, used by the perfumer, the latter being more economical.    LAVENDER.--The climate of England appears to be better adapted  for the perfect development of this fine old favorite perfume than any  other on the globe. \"The ancients,\" says Burnett, \"employed the flowers  and the leaves to aromatize their baths, and to give a sweet scent to  water in which they washed; hence the generic name of the plant,  _Lavandula_.\"    Lavender is grown to an enormous extent at Mitcham, in Surrey, which is  the seat of its production, in a commercial point of view. Very large  quantities are also grown in France, but the fine odor of the British  produce realizes in the market four times the price of that of  Continental growth. Burnett says that the oil of _Lavandula spica_ is  more pleasant than that derived from the other species, but this  statement must not mislead the purchaser to buy the French spike  lavender, as it is not worth a tenth of that derived from the _Lavandulae  verae_. Half-a-hundred weight of good lavender flowers yield, by  distillation, from 14 to 16 oz. of essential oil.    All the inferior descriptions of oil of lavender are used for perfuming  soaps and greases; but the best, that obtained from the Mitcham  lavender, is entirely used in the manufacture of what is called lavender  water, but which, more properly, should be called essence or extract of  lavender, to be in keeping with the nomenclature of other essences  prepared with spirit.    The number of formulae published for making a liquid perfume of lavender  is almost endless, but the whole of them may be resolved into essence of  lavender, simple; essence of lavender, compound; and lavender water.    There are two methods of making essence of lavender:--1. By distilling  a mixture of essential oil of lavender and rectified spirit; and the  other--2. By merely mixing the oil and the spirit together.    The first process yields the finest quality: it is that which is adopted  by the firm of Smyth and Nephew, whose reputation for this article is  such that it gives a good character in foreign markets, especially  India, to all products of lavender of English manufacture. Lavender  essence, that which is made by the still, is quite white, while that by  mixture only always has a yellowish tint, which by age becomes darker  and resinous.    SMYTH'S LAVENDER.    To produce a very fine distillate, take--    Otto of English Lavender,                 4 oz.  Rectified spirit (60"]]]
