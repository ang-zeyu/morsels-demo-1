But being got       _Loose_ and having no Time to _Lose_, I gave them good Words,       and so the Business was done. From thence I soon slip'd       through _Ludgate_, but was damnably fearful of an _Old Bailey_       always lurking thereabout, who might have brought me to the       _Fleet_ for being too _Nimble_, besides, I was wonderfully       apprehensive of receiving some unwelcome _Huggings_ from the       _W....n_ there; therefore with a step and a stride I soon got       over _Fleet-ditch_, and (as in Justice I ought) I prais'd the       _Bridge_ I got over. Being a _Batchelor_, and not being       capable to to manage a Bridewell you know. I had no Business       near _St. Brides_, so kept the right handside, designing to       _Pop_ into the _Alley_ as usual; but fearing to go thro'       there, and _harp_ too much on the same _String_, it gave an       _Allay_ to my Intention, and on I went to _Shoe-lane_ end but       there meeting with a _Bully Hack_ of the Town, he wou'd have       shov'd me down, which my Spirit resenting, tho' a _brawny       Dog_, I soon _Coller'd_ him, fell Souse at him, then with his       own Cane I _strapped_ till he was force to _Buckle_ too, and       hold his _Tongue_, in so much he durst not say his _Soul_ was       his own, and was glad to pack of at _Last_, and turn his       _Heels_ upon me: I was glad he was gone you may be sure, and       _dextrously_ made a _Hand_ of my _Feet_ under the       _Leg-Tavern_; but the very Thoughts of _Fetter-Lane_ call'd to       mind some Passages, which made me avoid the _Passage_ at the       end of it, (next to the Coffee House you know) so I soon       whip'd over the way, yet going along two wooden _Logger-heads_       at _St. Dunstan's_ made just them a damn'd Noise about their       _Quarters_, but the sight of me made perfectly _Hush_ in a       _Minute_; now fearing to goe by _Chance-a wry-Lane_, as being       upon the _Watch_ my self and not to be _debarr'd_ at       _Temple-Bar_; I stole up _Bell-Yard_, but narrowly escap'd       being _Clapper-claw'd_ by two Fellows I did not like in the       Alley, so was forc'd to goe round with a design to _Sheer-off_       into _Sheer-Lane_, but the _Trumpet_ sounding at that very       time, alarm'd me so, I was forc'd to Grope my way back through       _Hemlock-Court_, and take my _Passage_ by _Ship-Yard_ without       the Bar again; but there meeting with one of our trusty       Friends, (all Ceremonies a-part) he told me under the _Rose_ I       must expect no _Mercy_ in _St. Clement's_ Parish, for the       _Butchers_ there on the _Back_ on't would _Face_ me, and with       their _Cleavers_ soon bring me down on my _marrow_ Bones; you       may believe I soon hastened thence, but by this time being       Fainty and night Spent, I put forward, and seeing a _Light_       near the _Savoy-Gate_, I was resolv'd not to make _Light_ of       the Opportunity, but call'd for an hearty Dram of _Luther_ and       _Calvin_, that is, _Mum_ and _Geneva_ mix'd; but having Fasted       so long before, it soon got into my Noddle, and e'er I had       gone twenty steps, it had so intirely _Stranded_ my Reason,       that by the time I came to _Half-Moon-Street_ end, it gave a       _New-Exchange_ to my Senses, and made me quite _Lunatick_.         However, after a little Rest, I stole down _George-Passage_       into _Oaf-Alley_ in _York-Buildings_, and thence (tho' a vile       Man) into _Villiers-Street_, and so into the _Strand_ again,       where having gone a little way, _Hefford's-Harp_ at the Sign       of the _Irish-Harp_, put me a _Jumping and Dancing_ to that       degree that I could not forbear making a _Somerset_ or two       before _Northumberland-House_. I thought once of taking the       _Windsor_ Coach for my self _John Sheppard_, by the Name of       _Crook_---- but fearing to be _Hook'd_ in before my Journey's       End, I stept into _Hedge-Lane_, where two Harlots were up in       the _Boughs_ (it seems) _Branching_ out their Respects to one       another, through their Windows, and People beginning to gather       thereabout, I ran _Pelmel_ to _Piccadilly_, where meeting by       meer chance a _Bakers_ Cart going to _Turnham-Green_, I being       not _Mealy Mouth'd_, nor the Man being _Crusty_ I _wheel'd_       out of Town.         I did call at _Hammersmith_, having no occasion directly. I       shall stay two or three Days in that Neighbourhood, so, if you       Direct a letter for Mr. Sligh Bolt, to be left with Mrs.       _Tabitha Skymmington_ at _Cheesewick_, it's Safety will _Bear       Water_ by any _Boat_, and come _Current_ with the Tyde to         Dear BOB       Yours from the Top       of _Newgate_ to the Bottom                       J. _SHEPPARD_.         _P.S._ If you see _Blewskin_, tell him I am well, and hope he       receiv'd my last--I wou'd write by the _Post_ if I durst, but       it wou'd be, certainly _Post-pon'd_ if I did, and it would be       _stranger_ too, to trust a Line by a _Stranger_, who might       _Palm_ upon us both and never Deliver it to _Hand_.         I send this by a _Waterman_, (I dare trust) who is very Merry       upon me, and says he wou'd not be in my _Jacket_. _Saturday       Octob._ 17, 1724.    We shall conclude with what had been often observ'd by many Persons to  _Sheppard_; _viz._ That it was very Imprudent in him to take Shelter in  the City, or the adjacent Parts of it, after his Escape from the  Condemn'd Hold; and withal to commit a _Capital Offence_, almost within  Sight of _Newgate_, when his Life and all was in such Danger. His Reply  was general, _viz._ That it was his Fate: But being ask'd a particular  Reason for his not taking a longer Rout than the City, and the  Neighbouring parts: pleaded Poverty as his Excuse for Confinement within  those Limits; at the same time urging, that had he been Master at that  time of five Pounds, _England_ should not have been the Place of his  Residence, having a good Trade in his Hands to live in any populated  Part of the World."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14070"],[0,"English Grammar in Familiar Lectures (#8)"],[1,"one;  as in _bard, card, regard_. In the unaccented termination _re_, the _r_  is sounded after the e; as _in fibre, centre_.    S.--_S_ has a flat sound like _z_; as in _besom, nasal_; and, at the  beginning of words, a sharp, hissing sound; as in _saint, sister,  sample_. It has the sound of _sh_ when preceded by the accent and  another s or a liquid, and followed by a diphthong or long _u_; as in  _expulsion, censure_. _S_ sounds like _zh_ when preceded by the accent  and a vowel, and followed by a diphthong or long _u_ as in _brasier,  usual_. It is mute in _isle, corps, demesne, viscount_.    T.--_T_ is sounded in _take, temper_. _T_ before _u_, when the accent  precedes, and generally before _eou_, sounds like _tsh_; as, _nature,  virtue, righteous_, are pronounced _natshure, virtshue, richeus_. _Ti_  before a vowel, preceded by the accent, has the sound of _sh_; as in  _salvation, negotiation_; except in such words as _tierce, tiara_, &c.  and unless an _s_ goes before; as, _question_; and excepting also  derivatives from words ending in _ty_; as in _mighty, mightier_.    _Th_, at the beginning, _middle_, and end of words, is sharp; as in  _thick, panther, breath_. Exceptions; _then, booth, worthy_, &c.    U.--_U_ has three sounds; a long; as in _mule, cubic_; a short; as in  _dull, custard_; and an obtuse sound; as in _full, bushel_. It is  pronounced like short _e_ in _bury_; and like short _i_ in _busy,  business_.    V.--_V_ has uniformly the sound of flat _f_; as in _vanity, love_.    W.--_W_, when a consonant, has its sound, which is heard in _wo,  beware_. _W_ is silent before _r_; as in _wry, wrap, wrinkle_; and also  in _answer, sword_, &c. Before _h_ it is pronounced as if written after  the _h_; as in _why, when, what_;--_hwy, hwen, hwat_. When heard as a  vowel, it takes the sound of _u_; as in _draw, crew, now_.    X.--_X_ has a sharp sound, like _ks_, when it ends a syllable with the  accent on it; as, _exit, exercise_; or when it precedes an accented  syllable which begins with any consonant except _h_; as, _excuse,  extent_; but when the following accented syllable begins with a vowel or  _h_, it has, generally, a flat sound, like _gz_; as in _exert, exhort_.  _X_ has the sound of _Z_ at the beginning of proper names of Greek  original; as in _Xanthus, Xenophon, Xerxes_.    Y.--_Y_, when a consonant, has its proper sound; as in _youth, York,  yes, new-year_. When _y_ is employed as a vowel, it has exactly the  sound that _i_ would have in the same situation; as in _rhyme, system,  party, pyramid_.    Z.--_Z_ has the sound of flat _s_; as in _freeze, brazen_.      RULES FOR SPELLING.    SPELLING is the art of expressing a word by its proper letters.    The following rules are deemed important in practice, although they  assist us in spelling only a small portion of the words of our language.  This useful art is to be chiefly acquired by studying the spelling-book  and dictionary, and by strict attention in reading.    RULE I. Monosyllables ending in _f, l_, or _s_, double the final or  ending consonant when it is preceded by a _single_ vowel; as _staff,  mill, pass_. Exceptions; _of, if, is, as, lids, was, yes, his, this,  us_, and _thus_.        _False Orthography for the learner to correct_.--Be thou like the      gale that moves the gras, to those who ask thy aid.--The aged hero      comes forth on his staf; his gray hair glitters in the beam.--Shal      mortal man be more just than God?--Few know the value of health til      they lose it.--Our manners should be neither gros, nor excessively      refined.          And that is not the lark, whose notes do beat        The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:        I have more care to stay, than wil to go.      RULE II. Monosyllables ending in any consonant but _f, l_, or _s_, never  double the final consonant when it is preceded by a _single_ vowel; as,  _man, hat_. Exceptions; _add, ebb, butt, egg, odd, err, inn, bunn,  purr_, and _buzz_.        _False Orthography_.--None ever went sadd from Fingal.--He rejoiced      over his sonn.--Clonar lies bleeding on the bedd of death.--Many a      trapp is set to insnare the feet of youth.          The weary sunn has made a golden sett,        And, by the bright track of his golden carr,        Gives token of a goodly day to-morrow.      RULE III. Words ending in _y_, form the plural of nouns, the persons of  verbs, participial nouns, past participles, comparatives, and  superlatives, by changing _y_ into _i_, when the _y_ is preceded by a  _consonant_; as, _spy, spies; I carry, thou carriest, he carries;  carrier, carried; happy, happier, happiest_.    The present participle in _ing_, retains the _y_ that _i_ may not be  doubled; as, _carry, carrying_.    But when _y_ is preceded by a _vowel_, in such instances as the above,  it is not changed into _i_; as, _boy, boys; I cloy, he cloys_; except  in the words _lay, pay_, and _say I_ from which are formed _laid, paid_,  and _said_; and their compounds, _unpaid, unsaid_, &c.        _False Orthography_.--Our fancys should be governed by reason.--Thou      wearyest thyself in vain.--He denyed himself all sinful pleasures.          Win straiing souls with modesty and love;        Cast none away.        The truly good man is not dismaied by poverty.        Ere fresh morning streak the east, we must be risen to reform yonder          allies green.      RULE IV. When words ending in _y_, assume an additional syllable  beginning with a consonant, the _y_, if it is preceded by a consonant,  is commonly changed to _i_; as, _happy, happily, happiness_.    But when _y_ is preceded by a vowel, in such instances, it is very  rarely changed to _i_; as, _coy, coyless; boy, boyish; boyhood; joy,  joyless, joyful_.        _False Orthography_.--His mind is uninfluenced by fancyful      humors.--The vessel was heavyly laden.--When we act against      conscience, we become the destroiers of our own peace.          Christiana, mayden of heroic mien!        Star of the north! of northern stars the queen!      RULE V. Monosyllables, and words accented on the last syllable,  ending with a single consonant that is preceded by a single vowel,  double that consonant when they assume another syllable that begins  with a vowel; as, _wit, witty; thin, thinnish; to abet, an abetter_.    But if a diphthong precedes, or the accent is _not_ on the last  syllable, the consonant remains single; as, _to toil, toiling; to offer,  an offering; maid, maiden_.        _False Orthography_.--The business of to-day, should not be defered      till to-morrow.--That law is annuled.--When we have outstriped our      errors we have won the race.--By defering our repentance, we      accumulate our sorrows.--The Christian Lawgiver has prohibited many      things which the heathen philosophers allowed.          At summer eve, when heaven's aerial bow        Spans with bright arch the glitterring hills below.--        Thus mourned the hapless man; a thunderring sound        Rolled round the shudderring walls and shook the ground.    RULE VI. Words ending in double _l_, in taking _ness, less, ly_, or  _ful_, after them, generally omit one _l_; as, _fulness, skilless, fully  skilful_.    But words ending in any double letter but _l_, and taking _ness, less,  ly_, or _ful_, after them, preserve the letter double; as,  _harmlessness, carelessness, carelessly, stiffly, successful_.        _False Orthography_.--A chillness generally precedes a fever.--He is      wed to dullness.          The silent stranger stood amazed to see        Contempt of wealth and willful poverty.        Restlesness of mind impairs our peace.--The road to the blisful      regions, is as open to the peasant as to the king.--The arrows of      calumny fall harmlesly at the feet of virtue.    RULE VII. _Ness, less, ly_, or _ful_, added to words ending in silent  _e_, does not cut it off; as, _paleness, guileless, closely, peaceful_;  except in a few words; as, _duly, truly, awful_.        _False Orthography_.--Sedatness is becoming.          All these with ceasless praise his works behold.        Stars rush: and final ruin fiercly drives        Her ploughshare o'er creation!        ------Nature made a pause,        An aweful pause! prophetic of her end!    RULE VIII. When words ending in silent _e_, assume the termination,  _ment_, the _e_ should not be cut off; as, _abatement, chastisement_.    _Ment_, like other terminations, changes _y_ into _i_ when the _y_ is  preceded by a consonant; as, _accompany, accompaniment; merry,  merriment_.        _False Orthography_.--A judicious arrangment of studies facilitates      improvment.--Encouragment is greatest when we least need it.          To shun allurments is not hard,        To minds resolv'd, forwarn'd, and well prepared.    RULE IX. When words ending in silent _e_, assume the termination, _able_  or _ible_, the _e_ should generally be cut off; as, _blame, blamable;  cure, curable; sense, sensible_. But if _c_ or _g_ soft comes before _e_  in the original word, the _e_ is preserved in words compounded with  _able_; as, _peace, peaceable; change, changeable_.        _False Orthography_.--Knowledge is desireable.--Misconduct is      inexcuseable.--Our natural defects are not chargable upon us.--We      are made to be servicable to others as well as to ourselves.    RULE X. When _ing_ or _ish_ is added to words ending in silent  _e_, the _e_ is almost always omitted; as, _place, placing; lodge,  lodging; slave, slavish; prude, prudish_.        _False Orthography_.--Labor and expense are lost upon a droneish      spirit.--An obligeing and humble disposition, is totally unconnected      with a servile and cringeing humor.          Conscience anticipateing time,        Already rues th' unacted crime.        One self-approveing hour, whole years outweighs        Of stupid starers, and of loud huzzas.    RULE XI. Compound words are generally spelled in the same manner as the  simple"]]]
