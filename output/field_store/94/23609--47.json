I am sure that Americans will be reasonable enough  to believe that our two countries cannot discuss the _Lusitania_ matter  _until both have the same basis of facts_.\"      The American people were demanding an answer from Germany and because  the two branches of the Government could not agree on what should be  said von Jagow had to do something to gain time.  Germany, therefore,  submitted in her reply of the 28th of May certain facts about the  _Lusitania_ for the consideration of the American Government saying  that Germany reserved final statements of its position with regard \"to  the demands made in connection with the sinking of the _Lusitania_  until a reply was received from the American Government.\"  After the  note was despatched the chasm between the Navy and Foreign Office was  wider than ever.  Ambassador Gerard, who went to the Foreign Office  daily, to try to convince the officials that they were antagonising the  whole world by their attitude on the _Lusitania_ question, returned to  the Embassy one day after a conference with Zimmermann and began to  prepare a scrap book of cartoons and clippings from American  newspapers.  Two secretaries were put to work pasting the comments,  interviews, editorials and cartoons reflecting American opinion in the  scrap book.  Although the German Foreign Office had a big press  department its efforts were devoted more to furnishing the outside  world with German views than with collecting outside opinions for the  information of the German Government.  Believing that this information  would be of immeasurable benefit to the German diplomats in sounding  the depths of public sentiment in America, Gerard delivered the book to  von Jagow personally.    In the meantime numerous conferences were held at Great Headquarters.  Financiers, business men and diplomats who wanted to keep peace with  America sided with the Foreign Office.  Every anti-American influence  in the Central Powers joined forces with the Navy.  The _Lusitania_  note was printed and the public discussion which resulted was greater  than that which followed the first declarations of war in August, 1914.  The people, who before had accepted everything their Government said,  began to think for themselves.  One heard almost as much criticism as  praise of the _Lusitania_ incident.  For the first time the quarrel,  which had been nourished between the Foreign Office and the Admiralty,  became nation-wide and forces throughout Germany lined up with one side  or the other.  But the Navy Department was the cleverer of the two.  The press bureau sent out inspired stories that the submarines were  causing England a loss of a million dollars a week.  They said that  every week the Admiralty was launching two U-boats.  It was stated that  reliable reports to Admiral von Tirpitz proved the high toll taken by  the submarines in two weeks had struck terror to the hearts of English  ship-owners.  The newspapers printed under great headlines: \"Toll of  Our Tireless U-Boats,\" the names and tonnage of ships lost.  The press  bureau pointed to the rise in food prices in Great Britain and France.  The public was made to feel a personal pride in submarine exploits.  And at the same time the Navy editorial writers brought up the old  issue of American arms and ammunition to further embitter the people.    Thus the first note which President Wilson wrote in the _Lusitania_  case not only brought the quarrel between the Navy and Foreign Office  to a climax but it gave the German people the first opportunity they  had had seriously to discuss questions of policy and right.    In the Rhine Valley, where the ammunition interests dominated every  phase of life, the Navy found its staunchest supporters.  In  educational circles, in shipping centres, such as Hamburg and Bremen,  in the financial districts of Frankfort and Berlin, the Foreign Office  received its support.  Press and Reichstag were divided.  Supporting  the Foreign Office were the _Lokal Anzeiger_, the _Berliner Tageblatt_,  the _Cologne Gazette_, the _Frankforter Zeitung_, the _Hamburger  Fremdemblatt_, and the _Vorwaerts_.    The Navy had the support of Count Reventlow, Naval Critic of the  _Deutsche Tageszeitung_, the _Taeglische Rundscha_, the _Vossische  Zeitung_, the _Morgen Post_, the _B. Z. Am Mittag_, the _Muenchener  Neueste Nachrichten_, the _Rheinische Westfaelische Zeitung_, and the  leading Catholic organ, the _Koelnische Volks-Zeitung_.    Government officials were also divided.  Chancellor von  Bethmann-Hollweg led the party which demanded an agreement with the  United States.  He was supported by von Jagow, Zimmermann, Dr. Karl  Helfferich, Secretary of the Treasury; Dr. Solf, the Colonial Minister;  Dr. Siegfried Heckscher, Vice Chairman of the Reichstag Committee on  Foreign Relations; and Philip Scheidemann, leader of the majority of  the Socialists in the Reichstag.    The opposition was led by Grand Admiral von Tirpitz.  He was supported  by General von Falkenhayn, Field Marshal von Mackensen and all army  generals; Admirals von Pohl and von Bachmann; Major Bassermann, leader  of the National Liberal Party in the Reichstag; Dr. Gustav Stressemann,  member of the Reichstag and Director of the North German Lloyd  Steamship Company; and von Heydebrand, the so-called \"Uncrowned King of  Prussia,\" because of his control of the Prussian Diet.    With these forces against each other the internal fight continued more  bitter than ever.  President Wilson kept insisting upon definite  promises from Germany but the Admiralty still had the upper hand.  There was nothing for the Foreign Office to do except to make the best  possible excuses and depend upon Wilson's patience to give them time to  get into the saddle.  The Navy Department, however, was so confident  that it had the Kaiser's support in everything it did, that one of the  submarines was instructed to sink the _Arabic_.    President Wilson's note in the _Arabic_ case again brought the  submarine dispute within Germany to a head.  Conferences were again  held at Great Headquarters.  The Chancellor, von Jagow, Helfferich, von  Tirpitz and other leaders were summoned by the Kaiser.  On the 28th of  August I succeeded in sending by courier to The Hague the following  despatch:      \"With the support of the Kaiser, the German Chancellor, Dr. von  Bethmann-Hollweg, is expected to win the fight he is now making for a  modification of Germany's submarine warfare that will forever settle  the difficulties with America over the sinking of the _Lusitania_ and  the _Arabic_.  Both the Chancellor and von Jagow are most anxious to  end at once and for all time the controversies with Washington desiring  America's friendship.\"  (Published in the Chicago _Tribune_, August  29th, 1915.)      \"The Marine Department, headed by von Tirpitz, creator of the submarine  policy, will oppose any disavowal of the action of German's submarines.  But the Kaiser is expected to approve the steps the Chancellor and  Foreign Secretary contemplate taking, swinging the balance in favour of  von Bethmann-Hollweg's contention that ships in the future must be  warned before they are torpedoed.\"      One day I went to the Foreign Office and told one of the officials I  believed that if the American people knew what a difficult time the  Foreign Office was having in trying to win out over the Admiralty that  public opinion in the United States might be mobilised to help the  Foreign Office against the Admiralty.  I took with me a brief despatch  which I asked him to pass.  He censored it with the understanding that  I would never disclose his name in case the despatch was read in  Germany.    A few days later the Manchester, England, _Guardian_ arrived containing  my article, headed as follows:        HOLLWEG'S CHANGE OF TUNE      Respect for Scraps of Paper      LAW AT SEA      Insists on Warning by Submarines      TIRPITZ PARTY BEATEN      Kaiser Expected to Approve New Policy      \"New York, Sunday.    \"Cables from Mr. Carl W. Ackerman, Berlin correspondent of the United  Press published here, indicate that the real crisis following the  _Arabic_ is in Germany, not America.  He writes:    \"The Berlin Foreign Office is unalterably opposed to submarine  activity, such as evidenced by the _Arabic_ affair, and it was on the  initiative of this Government department that immediate steps were  taken with Mr. Gerard the American Ambassador.  The nature of these  negotiations is still unknown to the German public.    \"It is stated on the highest authority that Herr von Jagow, Secretary  of Foreign Affairs, and Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg are unanimous  in their anxiety to settle American difficulties once and for all,  retaining the friendship of the United States in any event.    \"The Kaiser is expected to approve the course suggested by the Imperial  Chancellor, despite open opposition to any disavowal of submarine  activities which constantly emanates from the German Admiralty.    \"The Chancellor is extremely desirous of placing Germany on record as  an observer of international law as regards sea warfare, and in this  case will win his demand that submarines in the future shall thoroughly  warn enemy ships before firing their torpedoes or shells.    \"There is considerable discussion in official circles as to whether the  Chancellor's steps create a precedent, but it is agreed that it will  probably close all complications with America, including the  _Lusitania_ case, which remained unsettled following President Wilson's  last note to Germany.    \"Thus if the United States approves the present attitude of the  Chancellor this step will aid in clearing the entire situation and will  materially strengthen the policy of von Bethmann-Hollweg and von Jagow,  which is a deep desire for peace with America.\"      After this despatch was printed I was called to the home "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15777"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World, Volume 1 (#8)"],[1," from its height, have been seen at  a much greater distance. We now crowded all the sail we could, thinking to  get into the bay before dark. But when we found this could not be  accomplished, we shortened sail, and spent the night standing off and on.  Between eight and nine o'clock, the whole sea, within the compass of our  sight, became at once, as it were illuminated; or, what the seamen call,  all on fire. This appearance of the sea, in some degree, is very common;  but the cause is not so generally known. Mr Banks and Dr Solander had  satisfied me that it was occasioned by sea-insects. Mr Forster, however,  seemed not to favour this opinion. I therefore had some buckets of water  drawn up from alongside the ship, which we found full of an innumerable  quantity of small globular insects, about the size of a common pin's-head,  and quite transparent. There was no doubt of their being living animals,  when in their own proper element, though we could not perceive any life in  them: Mr Forster, whose province it is more minutely to describe things of  this nature, was now well satisfied with the cause of the sea's  illumination.    At length day-light came and brought us fair weather; and having stood into  Table Bay, with the Adventure in company, we anchored in five fathom water.  We afterwards moored N.E. and S.W., Green Point on the west point of the  bay, bearing N.W. by W., and the church, in one with the valley between the  Table Mountain and the Sugar-Loaf, or Lion's Head, bearing S.W. by S., and  distant from the landing-place near the fort, one mile.    We had no sooner anchored than we were visited by the captain of the port,  or master-attendant, some other officers belonging to the company, and Mr  Brandt. This last gentleman brought us off such things as could not fail of  being acceptable to persons coming from sea. The purport of the master  attendant's visit was, according to custom, to take an account of the  ships; to enquire into the health of the crews; and, in particular, if the  small-pox was on board; a thing they dread, above all others, at the Cape,  and for these purposes a surgeon is always one of the visitants.    My first step after anchoring, was, to send an officer to wait on Baron  Plettenberg, the governor, to acquaint him with our arrival, and the  reasons which induced me to put in there. To this the officer received a  very polite answer; and, upon his return, we saluted the garrison with  eleven guns, which compliment was returned. Soon after I went on shore  myself, and waited upon the governor, accompanied by Captain Furneaux, and  the two Mr Forsters. He received us, with very great politeness, and  promised me every assistance the place could afford. From him I learned  that two French ships from the Mauritius, about eight months before, had  discovered land, in the latitude of 48 deg. S., and in the meridian of that  island, along which they sailed forty miles, till they came to a bay into  which they were about to enter, when they were driven off and separated in  a hard gale of wind, after having lost some of their boats and people,  which they had sent to sound the bay. One of the ships, viz. the La  Fortune, soon after arrived at the Mauritius, the captain of which was sent  home to France with an account of the discovery. The governor also informed  me, that in March last, two other French ships from the island of  Mauritius, touched at the Cape in their way to the South Pacific Ocean;  where they were going to make discoveries, under the command of M. Marion.  Aotourou, the man M. de Bougainville brought from Otaheite, was to have  returned with M. Marion, had he been living.    After having visited the governor and some other principal persons of the  place, we fixed ourselves at Mr Brandt's, the usual residence of most  officers belonging to English ships. This gentleman spares neither trouble  nor expence to make his house agreeable to those who favour him with their  company, and to accommodate them with every thing they want. With him I  concerted measures for supplying the ships with provisions, and all other  necessaries they wanted; which he set about procuring without delay, while  the seamen on board were employed in overhauling the rigging; and the  carpenters in caulking the ships' sides and decks, &c.    Messrs Wales and Bayley got all their instruments on shore, in order to  make astronomical observations for ascertaining the going of the watches,  and other purposes. The result of some of these observations shewed, that  Mr Kendal's watch had answered beyond all expectation, by pointing out the  longitude of this place to within one minute of time to what it was  observed by Messrs Mason and Dixon in 1761.    Three or four days after us, two Dutch Indiamen arrived here from Holland;  after a passage of between four and five months, in which one lost, by the  scurvy and other putrid diseases, 150 men, and the other 41. They sent, on  their arrival, great numbers to the hospital in very dreadful  circumstances. It is remarkable that one of these ships touched at Port  Praya, and left it a month before we arrived there; and yet we got here  three days before her. The Dutch at the Cape having found their hospital  too small for the reception of their sick, were going to build a new one at  the east part of the town; the foundation of which was laid with great  ceremony while we were there.    1772 November    By the healthy condition of the crews of both ships at our arrival, I  thought to have made my stay at the Cape very short. But, as the bread we  wanted was unbaked, and the spirit, which I found scarce, to be collected  from different parts out of the country, it was the 18th of November before  we had got every thing on board, and the 22d before we could put to sea.  During this stay the crews of both ships were served every day with fresh  beef or mutton, new-baked bread, and as much greens as they could eat. The  ships were caulked and painted; and, in every respect, put in as good a  condition as when they left England. Some alterations in the officers took  place in the Adventure. Mr Shank the first lieutenant having been in an ill  state of health ever since we sailed from Plymouth, and not finding himself  recover here, desired my leave to quit, in order to return home for the re-  establishment of his health. As his request appeared to be well-founded, I  granted him leave accordingly, and appointed Mr Kemp, first lieutenant in  his room, and Mr Burney, one of my midshipmen, second, in the room of Mr  Kemp.    Mr Forster, whose whole time was taken up in the pursuit of natural history  and botany, met with a Swedish gentleman, one Mr Sparman, who understood  something of these sciences, having studied under Dr Linnaeus. He being  willing to embark with us, Mr Forster strongly importuned me to take him on  board, thinking that he would be of great assistance to him in the course  of the voyage. I at last consented, and he embarked with us accordingly, as  an assistant to Mr Forster, who bore his expences on board, and allowed him  a yearly stipend besides.    Mr Hodges employed himself here in drawing a view of the Cape, town, and  parts adjacent, in oil colours, which, was properly packed up with some  others, and left with Mr Brandt, in order to be forwarded to the Admiralty  by the first ship that should sail for England.    CHAPTER II.    _Departure from the Cape of Good Hope, in search of a Southern  Continent._    1772 November    Having at length finished my business at the Cape, and taken leave of the  governor and some others of the chief officers, who, with very obliging  readiness, had given me all the assistance I could desire, on the 22d of  November we repaired on board; and at three o'clock in the afternoon  weighed, and came to sail with the wind at N. by W. As soon as the anchor  was up, we saluted the port with fifteen guns, which was immediately  returned; and after making a few trips, got out of the bay by seven  o'clock, at which time the town bore S.E. distant four miles. After this we  stood to the westward all night, in order to get clear of the land, having  the wind at N.N.W. and N.W., blowing in squalls attended with rain, which  obliged us to reef our topsails. The sea was again illuminated for some  time, in the same manner as it was the night before we arrived in Table  Bay.    Having got clear of the land, I directed my course for Cape Circumcision.  The wind continued at N.W. a moderate gale, until the 24th, when it veered  round to the eastward. On the noon of this day, we were in the latitude of  35 deg. 25' S., and 29' west of the Cape; and had abundance of albatrosses  about us, several of which were caught with hook and line; and were very  well relished by many of the people, notwithstanding they were at this time  served with fresh mutton. Judging that we should soon come into cold  weather, I ordered slops to be served to such as were in want; and gave to  each man the fearnought jacket and trowsers allowed them by the Admiralty.    1772 December    The wind continued easterly for two days, and blew a moderate gale, which  brought us into the latitude of 39 deg. 4', and 2 deg. of longitude west of the  Cape, thermometer 52-1/2 The wind now came to W. and S.W.; and on the  29th fixed at W.N.W., and increased to a storm, which continued, with some  few intervals of moderate weather, till the 6th of December, when we were  in the latitude of 48 deg. 41' S., and longitude 18 deg. 24' E. This gale, which  was attended with rain and hail, blew at times with such violence that we  could carry no sails; by which means we were driven far to the eastward of  our intended course, and no hopes were left me of reaching Cape  Circumcision. But the greatest misfortune that attended us, was the loss of  great part of our live stock, which we had brought from the Cape, and which  consisted of sheep, hogs, and"]]]
