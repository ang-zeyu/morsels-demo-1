When the General asked the boy how he secured the prisoners the lad  replied, nonchalantly, \"Oh, I surrounded them.\" These youths who  accompanied the commando were known as the \"Penkop Regiment\"--a regiment  composed of school children--and in their connection an amusing story has  been current in the Boer country ever since the war of 1881, when large  numbers of children less than fifteen years old went with their fathers to  battle. The story is that after the fight at Majuba Hill, while the peace  negotiations were in progress, Sir Evelyn Wood, the Commander of the  British forces, asked General Joubert to see the famous Penkop  Regiment. The Boer General gave an order that the regiment should be drawn  up in a line before his tent, and when this had been done General Joubert  led General Wood into the open and introduced him to the corps. Sir Evelyn  was sceptical for some time, and imagined that General Joubert was joking,  but when it was explained to him that the youths really were the  much-vaunted Penkop Regiment he advised them to return to their  school-books.    When a man has reached the age of sixty it may be assumed that he has  outlived his usefulness as a soldier; but not so with the Boer. There was  not one man, but hundreds, who had passed the Biblical threescore years  and ten but were fighting valiantly in defence of their country.  Grey-haired men who, in another country, might be expected to be found at  their homes reading the accounts of their grandsons' deeds in the war,  went out on scouting duty and scaled hills with almost as much alacrity as  the burghers only half their age. Men who could boast of being  grandfathers were innumerable, and in almost any laager there could be  seen father, sons, and grandsons, all fighting with equal vigour and  enthusiasm. Paul Kruger is seventy-five years old, but there were many of  his burghers several years older than he who went to the frontier with  their commandos and remained there for several months at a time. A  great-grandfather serving in the capacity of a private soldier, may appear  like a mythical tale, but there were several such. Old Jan van der  Westhuizen, of the Middleberg laager, was active and enthusiastic at  eighty-two years, and felt more than proud of four great-grand-children.  Piet Kruger, a relative of the President, and four years his senior, was  an active participant in every battle in which the Rustenburg commando was  engaged while it was in Natal, and he never once referred to the fact that  he fought in the 1881 war and in the attack upon Jameson's men. Four of  Kruger's sons shared the same tent and fare with him, and ten of his  grandsons were burghers in different commandos. Jan C. ven [Transcriber's  note: sic] Tander, of Boshof, exceeded the maximum of the military age  by eight years, but he was early in the field, and was seriously wounded  at the battle of Scholtznek on December 11th. General Joubert himself  was almost seventy years old but as far as physical activity was  concerned there were a score of burghers in his commando, each from five  to ten years older, who exhibited more energy in one battle than he did  during the entire Natal campaign. The hundreds of bridges and culverts  along the railway lines in the Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and  Upper Natal were guarded day and night by Boers more than sixty years  old, who had volunteered to do the work in order that younger men might  be sent to localities where their services might be more necessary.  Other old Boers and cripples attended to the commissariat arrangements  along the railways, conducted commissariat waggons, gathered forage for  the horses at the front, and arranged the thousands of details which  are necessary to the well-being and comfort of every army, however  simple its organisation.    Among the Boers were many burghers who had assisted Great Britain in her  former wars in South Africa--men who had fought under the British flag,  but were now fighting against it. Colonel Ignace Ferreira, a member of one  of the oldest Boer families, fought under Lord Wolseley in the Zulu war,  and had the Order of the Commander of the Bath conferred upon him by the  Queen. Colonel Ferreira was at the head of a commando at Mafeking. Paul  Dietzch, the military secretary of General Meyer, fought under the British  flag in the Gaika and several other native wars.    It was not only the extremely old and the extremely young who went to war;  it was a transfer of the entire population of the two Republics to the  frontiers, and no condition or position was sufficient excuse to remain  behind. The professional man of Pretoria and Johannesburg was in a laager  which was adjacent to a laager of farthest-back veld-farmers. Lawyers and  physicians, photographers and grocers, speculators and sextons, judges and  schoolmasters, schoolboys and barkeepers--all who were burghers locked  their desks and offices and journeyed to the front. Even clergymen closed  their houses of worship in the towns and remained among the commandos to  pray and preach for those who did the fighting. The members of the  Volksraads, who brought on the war by their ultimatum, were among the  first in the field, and foremost in attacking the soldiers of their enemy.  Students in European universities, who hastened home when war-clouds were  gathering, went shoulder to shoulder into battle with the backwoodsman,  the Boer takhaar. There was no pride among them; no class distinction  which prevented a farmer from speaking to a millionaire. A graduate of  Cambridge had as his boon companion for five months a farmer who thought  the earth a square, and imagined the United States to be a political  division of Australia.    [Illustration: BOERS WATCHING THE FIGHT AT DUNDEE]    The Boer who was bred in a city or town good-naturedly referred to his  country cousin as a \"takhaar\"--a man with grizzly beard and unkempt hair.  It was a good descriptive term, and the takhaar was not offended when it  was applied to him. The takhaar was the modern type of the old voortrekker  Boer who, almost a hundred years ago, trekked north from Cape Colony, and  after overcoming thousands of difficulties settled in the present Boer  country. He was a religious, big-hearted countryman of the kind who would  suspect a stranger until he proved himself worthy of trust. After that  period was passed the takhaar would walk the veld in order that you might  ride his horse. If he could not speak your language he would repeat a  dozen times such words as he knew, meanwhile offering to you coffee,  mutton, bread, and all the best that his laager larder afforded. He  offered to exchange a pipe-load of tobacco with you, and when that  occurred you could take it for granted that he was your friend for life.  The takhaar was the man who went to the frontiers on his own  responsibility weeks before the ultimatum was sent, and watched day and  night lest the enemy might trample a rod beyond the bounds. He was the man  who stopped Jameson, who climbed Majuba, and who fought the natives. The  takhaar was the Boer before gold brought restlessness into the country,  and he was proud of his title. The fighting ability of the takhaar is best  illustrated by repeating an incident which occurred after the battle of  Dundee when a large number of Hussars were captured. One of the Hussar  officers asked for the name of the regiment he had been fighting against.  A fun-loving Boer replied that the Boers had no regiments; that their men  were divided into three brigades--the Afrikanders, the Boers, and the  Takhaars--a distinction which carried with it but a slight difference.  \"The Afrikander brigade,\" the Boer explained, \"is fighting now. They fight  like demons. When they are killed, then the Boers take the field. The  Boers fight about twice as well and hard as the Afrikanders. As soon as  all the Boers are killed, then come the takhaars, and they would rather  fight than eat.\" The officer remained silent for a moment, then sighed and  said, \"Well, if that is correct, then our job is bigger than I thought it  was.\"    The ideal Boer is a man with a bearded face and a flowing moustache, and  in order to appear idyllic almost every Boer burgher, who was not thus  favoured before war was began, engaged in the peaceful process of growing  a beard. Young men who, in times of peace, detested hirsute adornments of  the face allowed their beards and moustaches to grow, and after a month or  two it was almost impossible to find one burgher who was without a growth  of hair on his face. The wearing of a beard was almost equal to a badge of  Boer citizenship, and for the time being every Boer was a takhaar in  appearance if not in fact. The adoption of beards was not so much fancy as  it was a matter of discretion. The Boer was aware of the fact that few of  the enemy wore beards, and so it was thought quite ingenious for all  burghers to wear facial adornments of that kind in order that friend and  foe might be distinguished more readily at a distance.    Notwithstanding their ability to fight when it is necessary, it is  doubtful whether twenty per cent of the Boer burghers in the commandos  would be accepted for service in any continental or American army. The  rigid physical examinations of many of the armies would debar thousands  from becoming regular soldiers. There were men in the Boer forces who had  only one arm, some with only one leg, others with only one eye; some were  almost totally blind, while others would have felt happy if they could  have heard the reports of their rifles. Men who were suffering from  various kinds of illnesses, and who should have been in a physician's  care, were to be seen in every laager. Men who wore spectacles were  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16467"],[0,"Musicians of To-Day (#8)"],[1,", or remains insensible to his skill and mastery in the  mechanism of expression, and his power over sonorous matter, which make  him, apart from his creative power, a sort of magician of music, a king  of tone and rhythm. This gift is recognised even by his enemies--by  Wagner, who seeks with some unfairness to restrict his genius within  narrow limits, and to reduce it to \"a structure with wheels of infinite  ingenuity and extreme cunning ... a marvel of mechanism.\"[70]    But though there is hardly anyone that Berlioz does not irritate or  attract, he always strikes people by his impetuous ardour, his glowing  romance, and his seething imagination, all of which makes and will  continue to make his work one of the most picturesque mirrors of his  age. His frenzied force of ecstasy and despair, his fulness of love and  hatred, his perpetual thirst for life, which \"in the heart of the  deepest sorrow lights the Catherine wheels and crackers of the wildest  joy\"[71]--these are the qualities that stir up the crowds in _Benvenuto_  and the armies in the _Damnation_, that shake earth, heaven, and hell,  and are never quenched, but remain devouring and \"passionate even when  the subject is far removed from passion, and yet also express sweet and  tender sentiments and the deepest calm.\"[72]    [Footnote 70: \"Berlioz displayed, in calculating the properties of  mechanism, a really astounding scientific knowledge. If the inventors of  our modern industrial machinery are to be considered benefactors of  humanity to-day, Berlioz deserves to be considered as the true saviour  of the musical world; for, thanks to him, musicians can produce  surprising effects in music by the varied use of simple mechanical  means.... Berlioz lies hopelessly buried beneath the ruins of his own  contrivances\" (_Oper und Drama_, 1851).]    [Footnote 71: Letter from Berlioz to Ferrand.]    [Footnote 72: \"The chief characteristics of my music are passionate  expression, inward warmth, rhythmic in pulses, and unforeseen effects.  When I speak of passionate expression, I mean an expression that  desperately strives to reproduce the inward feeling of its subject, even  when the theme is contrary to passion, and deals with gentle emotions or  the deepest calm. It is this kind of expression that may be found in  _L'Enfance du Christ_, and, above all, in the scene of _Le Ciel_ in the  _Damnation de Faust_ and in the _Sanctus_ of the _Requiem_\" (_Memoires_,  II, 361).]    Whatever one may think of this volcanic force, of this torrential stream  of youth and passion, it is impossible to deny them; one might as well  deny the sun.    And I shall not dwell on Berlioz's love of Nature, which, as M.  Prudhomme shows us, is the soul of a composition like the _Damnation_  and, one might say, of all great compositions. No musician, with the  exception of Beethoven, has loved Nature so profoundly. Wagner himself  did not realise the intensity of emotion which she roused in  Berlioz,[73] and how this feeling impregnated the music of the  _Damnation_, of _Romeo_, and of _Les Troyens_.    [Footnote 73: \"So you are in the midst of melting glaciers in your  _Niebelungen_! To be writing in the presence of Nature herself must be  splendid. It is an enjoyment which I am denied. Beautiful landscapes,  lofty peaks, or great stretches of sea, absorb me instead of evoking  ideas in me. I feel, but I cannot express what I feel. I can only paint  the moon when I see its reflection in the bottom of a well\" (Berlioz to  Wagner, 10 September, 1855).]    But this genius had other characteristics which are less well known,  though they are not less unusual. The first is his sense of pure beauty.  Berlioz's exterior romanticism must not make us blind to this. He had a  Virgilian soul; and if his colouring recalls that of Weber, his design  has often an Italian suavity. Wagner never had this love of beauty in  the Latin sense of the word. Who has understood the Southern nature,  beautiful form, and harmonious movement like Berlioz? Who, since Gluck,  has recognised so well the secret of classical beauty? Since _Orfeo_ was  composed, no one has carved in music a bas-relief so perfect as the  entrance of Andromache in the second act of _Les Troyens a Troie_. In  _Les Troyens a Carthage_, the fragrance of the Aeneid is shed over the  night of love, and we see the luminous sky and hear the murmur of the  sea. Some of his melodies are like statues, or the pure lines of  Athenian friezes, or the noble gesture of beautiful Italian girls, or  the undulating profile of the Albanian hills filled with divine  laughter. He has done more than felt and translated into music the  beauty of the Mediterranean--he has created beings worthy of a Greek  tragedy. His Cassandre alone would suffice to rank him among the  greatest tragic poets that music has ever known. And Cassandre is a  worthy sister of Wagner's Bruennhilde; but she has the advantage of  coming of a nobler race, and of having a lofty restraint of spirit and  action that Sophocles himself would have loved.    Not enough attention has been drawn to the classical nobility from which  Berlioz's art so spontaneously springs. It is not fully acknowledged  that he was, of all nineteenth-century musicians, the one who had in the  highest degree the sense of plastic beauty. Nor do people always  recognise that he was a writer of sweet and flowing melodies.  Weingartner expressed the surprise he felt when, imbued with current  prejudice against Berlioz's lack of melodic invention, he opened, by  chance, the score of the overture of _Benvenuto_ and found in that short  composition, which barely takes ten minutes to play, not one or two, but  four or five melodies of admirable richness and originality:--    \"I began to laugh, both with pleasure at having discovered such a  treasure, and with annoyance at finding how narrow human judgment is.  Here I counted five themes, all of them plastic and expressive of  personality; of admirable workmanship, varied in form, working up by  degrees to a climax, and then finishing with strong effect. And this  from a composer who was said by critics and the public to be devoid of  creative power! From that day on there has been for me another great  citizen in the republic of art.\"[74]    [Footnote 74: _Musikfuehrer_, 29 November, 1903.]    Before this, Berlioz had written in 1864:--         \"It is quite easy for others to convince themselves that, without       even limiting me to take a very short melody as the theme of a       composition--as the greatest musicians have often done--I have       always endeavoured to put a wealth of melody into my compositions.       One may, of course, dispute the worth of these melodies, their       distinction, originality, or charm--it is not for me to judge       them--but to deny their existence is either unfair or foolish. They       are often on a large scale; and an immature or short-sighted       musical vision may not clearly distinguish their form; or, again,       they may be accompanied by secondary melodies which, to a limited       vision, may veil the form of the principal ones. Or, lastly,       shallow musicians may find these melodies so unlike the funny       little things that they call melodies, that they cannot bring       themselves to give the same name to both.\"[75]    And what a splendid variety there is in these melodies: there is the  song in Gluck's style (Cassandre's airs), the pure German _lied_  (Marguerite's song, \"D'amour l'ardente flamme\"), the Italian melody,  after Bellini, in its most limpid and happy form (arietta of Arlequin in  _Benvenuto_), the broad Wagnerian phrase (finale of _Romeo_), the  folk-song (chorus of shepherds in _L'Enfance du Christ_), and the freest  and most modern recitative (the monologues of Faust), which was  Berlioz's own invention, with its full development, its pliant outline,  and its intricate nuances.[76]    [Footnote 75: _Memoires_, II, 361.]    [Footnote 76: M. Jean Marnold has remarked this genius for monody in  Berlioz in his article on _Hector Berlioz, musicien (Mercure de France_,  15 January, and 1 February, 1905).]    I have said that Berlioz had a matchless gift for expressing tragic  melancholy, weariness of life, and the pangs of death. In a general way,  one may say that he was a great elegist in music. Ambros, who was a very  discerning and unbiassed critic, said: \"Berlioz feels with inward  delight and profound emotion what no musician, except Beethoven, has  felt before.\" And Heinrich Heine had a keen perception of Berlioz's  originality when he called him \"a colossal nightingale, a lark the size  of an eagle.\" The simile is not only picturesque, but of remarkable  aptness. For Berlioz's colossal force is at the service of a forlorn and  tender heart; he has nothing of the heroism of Beethoven, or Haendel, or  Gluck, or even Schubert. He has all the charm of an Umbrian painter, as  is shown in _L'Enfance du Christ_, as well as sweetness and inward  sadness, the gift of tears, and an elegiac passion.           *       *       *       *       *    Now I come to Berlioz's great originality, an originality which is  rarely spoken of, though it makes him more than a great musician, more  than the successor of Beethoven, or, as some call him, the forerunner of  Wagner. It is an originality that entitles him to be known, even more  fitly than Wagner himself, as the creator of \"an art of the future,\" the  apostle of a new music, which even to-day has hardly made itself felt.    Berlioz is original in a double sense. By the extraordinary complexity  of his genius he touched the two opposite poles of his art, and showed  us two entirely different aspects of music--that of a great popular art,  and that of music made free.    We are all enslaved by the musical tradition of the past. For  generations we have been so accustomed to carry this yoke that we  scarcely notice it. And in consequence of"]]]
