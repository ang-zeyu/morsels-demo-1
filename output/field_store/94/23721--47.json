An estimated 13 million tourists visit annually, attracted by    Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. The    banking sector, with its \"tax haven\" status, also contributes    substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is limited by a    scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The    principal livestock activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists    mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Andorra is a member of    the EU Customs Union; it is unclear what effect the European Single    Market will have on the advantages Andorra obtains from its duty-free    status.

The two black parallel stripes at the corner of the eye  seem to be folds of skin or marks on the skin, which may represent a  peculiarity of this particular species of frog. His head ornament is very  characteristic and contains the sign for the year of 360 days. He  therefore bears some unknown relation also to the computation of time. It  should be recalled in this connection that one of the Maya months is  called Uo, frog. The god is pictured again in Tro. 30a and b, Tro. 22  (top, scattering seed) and Cort. 5 (at the very bottom, the figure lying  down). Finally his neck ornament must be mentioned, which, as a rule,  consists of a neck-chain with pointed, oblong or pronged objects,  probably shells.    In the Dresden manuscript he occurs but once, Dr. 4a (first figure),  with some variations it is true. The text at this place contains H's  hieroglyph. God P does not occur in the Peresianus.    His hieroglyph is Fig. 53. It occurs in Tro. 31 (top) and can be  unerringly recognized by the two black parallel stripes at the corner of  the eye; which correspond exactly to the same marks on the face of the  picture of the god himself.    This is all that can be said respecting this deity from the pictures in  the manuscripts. Its meaning is obscure. Seler's assumption that god P is  Kukulcan (Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie, 1898, p. 403) has certainly very  slight foundation, and in view of the material from the manuscripts  described in the preceding pages, it is in the highest degree improbable.               *       *       *       *       *    The foregoing is an almost complete enumeration of the god-figures proper  in the Maya manuscripts. Whatever other figures of gods occur in the  manuscripts are details of slight importance. This is especially true of  the Dresden manuscript, which is well nigh exhausted by the types  enumerated here; there may be, I think, a few figures still undescribed  in the Madrid manuscript, the careless drawing of which renders the  identification very difficult. An isolated figure of the Dresden  manuscript still remains to be mentioned, concerning which it is doubtful  whether it is intended to represent a deity or only a human personage.    This is the figure characterized by a peculiar head ornament in Dr. 20b.  It is designated in the text by two hieroglyphs, which belong together,  Figs. 54 and 55, the latter occurring once with K (Dr. 7a). It seems to  represent blowing from the mouth, screaming or speaking.    [Illustration: Figs. 54-55]          II. MYTHOLOGICAL ANIMALS.      1. THE MOAN BIRD.    [Illustration: Figs. 56-59]    This bird[41-1] belongs to the death-god as his symbol and attendant. Its  hieroglyph (Fig. 56) contains the numeral 13; other forms are Figs. 57-59.  It is pictured in Dr. 7c, 10a, 11a, 16c, 18b, and its hieroglyph  without the picture is seen in Dr. 8b. A realistic representation of the  whole figure of the moan as a bird, occurs on the head of the woman in  16c (1st figure) and 18b. God B sits on the head of the moan in Dr.  38c; the third hieroglyph of the accompanying text refers to this  representation. Just as in Dr. 16 and 18, the moan bird appears in Tro.  18*c on the head of a woman. Its character as an attribute of the  death-god is expressed by the Cimi-sign, which it wears upon its head  (_e. g._, Dr. 10a), and also by the regular occurrence of symbols of the  death-god in the written characters, which refer to the moan bird. In the  same manner the sign of the owl, Fig. 5, also occurs frequently with it.        [41-1] See plate for representations of the Mythological Animals,      1-6.    The moan confers name and symbol alike on one of the eighteen months of  the Maya year, and thus, as Foerstemann conjectures (Die Plejaden bei den  Mayas, in Globus, 1894), has an astronomic bearing on the constellation  of the Pleiades.    According to Brinton the moan is a member of the falcon family and its  zoological name is _Spizaetus tyrannus_.      2. THE SERPENT.    This is one of the most common and most important mythological animals,  and is closely related to different deities, as has already been more  fully discussed in connection with the individual cases. Apparently it  has no _independent_ significance as a deity. Its most important  personification is that in god B, Kukulcan, the feathered serpent. Hence  a fixed hieroglyph designating the serpent as a deity, as a mythologic  form, does not occur, though there are numerous hieroglyphs which refer  to serpents or represent individual parts of the serpent, as its coils,  its jaws, the rattles of the rattlesnake, etc. The serpent appears in the  mythologic conceptions of the Mayas chiefly as the symbol of water and of  time. In the great series of numbers of the Dresden manuscript, certain  numbers occur which are introduced in the coils of a large serpent  (compare in regard to this, Foerstemann, Zur Entzifferung der  Mayahandschriften, II, Dresden, 1891). The serpent is very frequently  represented in all the manuscripts, sometimes realistically and sometimes  with the head of a god, etc. In the Dresden manuscript it occurs in the  following places: 1a, 26, 27, 28c, 35b, 36a, 36b, 37b 40, 42a, 61,  62, 65c 66a and 69. It is prominent also in the Madrid manuscript,  occurring for example in Cort. 4-6, 12-18, Tro. 25, 26, 27 and elsewhere.      3. THE DOG.    [Illustration: Fig. 60]    Fig. 60 is its hieroglyph. It is the symbol of the death-god and the  bearer of the lightning. The latter follows quite clearly from the  picture in Dr. 40b where the god is distinguished by its hieroglyph.  This animal is again represented in Dr. 7a, 13c on the right, 21b with  its hieroglyph, 29a, 30a (forming a part of 31a, where god B holds the  bound dog by the tail), and 39a without the hieroglyph, 47 (bottom) with  a variant of the hieroglyph.    In Dr. 36a the dog bears the Akbal-sign on its forehead. The writing  above it contains a variant of the hieroglyph for the dog; this is the  third of the rubric. It shows (somewhat difficult of recognition) the  Akbal-sign on the forehead of the dog's head occurring in it, and on the  back of the head the Kin-sign, as symbols of the alternation of day and  night. The same sign occurs again with adjuncts in Dr. 74 (last line, 2nd  sign) and once with the _death-god_ in Dr. 8a. The dog as  lightning-beast occurs with the Akbal-sign in the eye instead of on the  forehead in Codex Tro. 23*a; here again its hieroglyph is an entirely  different one (the third of the rubric).    That the dog belongs to the death-god is proved beyond a doubt by the  regular recurrence in the writing belonging to the dog, of the  hieroglyphs, which relate to this deity, especially of Fig. 5. According  to Foerstemann his day is Oc.      4. THE VULTURE.    [Illustration: Fig. 61]    This bird is distinctly pictured as a mythological figure in Dr. 8a. It  appears again, in feminine form, together with the dog, in Dr. 13c and  also in 19a. In the first passage, its hieroglyph is almost effaced; the  hieroglyph is very striking and occurs nowhere else in the whole  collection of manuscripts. The body of this animal-deity is striped black  and white; in Dr. 38b it is almost entirely black. The same passage  displays a second hieroglyph for this figure (Fig. 61); this hieroglyph  also occurs with the numeral 4 in Dr. 56b. In Dr. 36b this bird of prey  is pictured fighting with the serpent; its hieroglyph occurs in the  second form; the serpent is designated by the Chuen, the gaping jaws of  the serpent (first character of the rubric).    Finally it should be mentioned that the head of this bird occurs  frequently as a head ornament, thus in Dr. 11a, 11b, 12b and 14b.  Mention should also be made of the realistic representations of the  vulture, eating the eye of a human sacrifice (Dr. 3, Tro. 26*a and  27*a).    According to Foerstemann his day is Cib.      5. The Jaguar.    [Illustration: Fig. 62]    The jaguar is likewise an animal with mythological significance. It is  represented in Dr. 8a, where its hieroglyph is the third sign in the  writing; it also occurs in Dr. 26 (at the top). It occurs in Tro. 17 (at  the end) with a hieroglyph which represents the jaguar's head and  contains the numeral 4 (Fig. 62); again it appears without a hieroglyph  on p. 20 (bottom) and on 21 and 22 (bottom).    Its day is Ix, and hence it also relates occasionally as year regent to  the Ix years, for example in Dr. 26a.      6. The Tortoise.    [Illustration: Figs. 63-65]    This animal, like the dog, appears as a lightning-beast (see Dr. 40b,  middle). Its hieroglyph is Figs. 63, 64. This sign also is connected with  the numeral 4, which occurs so often with animals (but not alone with  quadrupeds) as to be worthy of attention. The sign of the tortoise  without the numeral is seen in Cort. 17a, where the tortoise itself is  also represented. It must have reference to the 17th month of the Maya  year, for the month Kayab (and apparently also Pop) contains the head of  the tortoise (compare Fig. 65). It occurs several times in the  Cortesianus, thus on pp. 13, 19, 37, 38; on p. 19 with the hieroglyph (on  the top of the lower half of the page, 1st line and at the right of the  margin). In Dr. 69 (at the top) we see the sign of the tortoise with the  Kin-sign as its eye and the numeral 12; under this group B, with a black  body, is seated on the serpent; on the same page the sign occurs again;  each time, moreover, apparently as a month-hieroglyph.    According to Foerstemann the tortoise is the symbol of the summer  solstice, as the _snail_, which occurs only as a head ornament in the  manuscripts and not independently, is the symbol of the winter solstice;  both, as the animals of slowest motion, represent the apparent standstill  of the sun at the periods specified."]]]
