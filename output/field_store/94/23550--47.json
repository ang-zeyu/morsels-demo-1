January 2, 1851_      Dear Johnston, Your request for eighty dollars I do not think it best to  comply with now. At the various times when I have helped you a little  you have said to me, \"We can get along very well now\"; but in a very  short time I find you in the same difficulty again. Now, this can only  happen by some defect in your conduct. What that defect is, I think I  know. You are not lazy, and still you are an idler. I doubt whether,  since I saw you, you have done a good whole day's work in any one day.  You do not very much dislike to work, and still you do not work much,  merely because it does not seem to you that you could get much for it.  This habit of uselessly wasting time is the whole difficulty; it is  vastly important to you, and still more so to your children, that you  should break the habit. It is more important to them, because they have  longer to live, and can keep out of an idle habit before they are in it,  easier than they can get out after they are in.    You are now in need of some money; and what I propose is, that you shall  go to work, \"tooth and nail,\" for somebody who will give you money for  it. Let father and your boys take charge of your things at home,  prepare for a crop, and make the crop, and you go to work for the best  money wages, or in discharge of any debt you owe, that you can get; and,  to secure you a fair reward for your labour, I now promise you, that for  every dollar you will, between this and the first of May, get for your  own labour, either in money or as your own indebtedness, I will then  give you one other dollar. By this, if you hire yourself at ten dollars  a month, from me you will get ten more, making twenty dollars a month  for your work. In this I do not mean you shall go off to St. Louis, or  the lead mines, or the gold mines in California, but I mean for you to  go at it for the best wages you can get close to home in Coles County.  Now, if you will do this, you will be soon out of debt, and, what is  better, you will have a habit that will keep you from getting in debt  again. But, if I should now clear you out of debt, next year you would  be just as deep in as ever. You say you would almost give your place in  heaven for seventy or eighty dollars. Then you value your place in  heaven very cheap, for I am sure you can, with the offer I make, get the  seventy or eighty dollars for four or five months' work. You say if I  will furnish you the money you will deed me the land, and, if you don't  pay the money back, you will deliver possession. Nonsense! If you can't  now live with the land, how will you then live without it? You have  always been kind to me, and I do not mean to be unkind to you. On the  contrary, if you will but follow my advice, you will find it worth more  than eighty times eighty dollars to you.          _Letter to John D. Johnston. Shelbyville. November 4, 1851_      Dear Brother, When I came into Charleston day before yesterday, I  learned that you are anxious to sell the land where you live and move to  Missouri. I have been thinking of this ever since, and cannot but think  such a notion is utterly foolish. What can you do in Missouri better  than here? Is the land any richer? Can you there, any more than here,  raise corn and wheat and oats without work? Will anybody there, any more  than here, do your work for you? If you intend to go to work, there is  no better place than right where you are; if you do not intend to go to  work, you cannot get along anywhere. Squirming and crawling about from  place to place can do no good. You have raised no crop this year; and  what you really want is to sell the land, get the money, and spend it.  Part with the land you have, and, my life upon it, you will never after  own a spot big enough to bury you in. Half you will get for the land you  will spend in moving to Missouri, and the other half you will eat,  drink, and wear out, and no foot of land will be bought. Now, I feel it  my duty to have no hand in such a piece of foolery. I feel that it is so  even on your own account, and particularly on mother's account. The  eastern forty acres I intend to keep for mother while she lives; if you  will not cultivate it, it will rent for enough to support her--at least,  it will rent for something. Her dower in the other two forties she can  let you have, and no thanks to me. Now, do not misunderstand this  letter; I do not write it in any unkindness. I write it in order, if  possible, to get you to face the truth, which truth is, you are  destitute because you have idled away all your time. Your thousand  pretences for not getting along better are all nonsense; they deceive  nobody but yourself. Go to work is the only cure for your case.    A word to mother. Chapman tells me he wants you to go and live with him.  If I were you I would try it awhile. If you get tired of it (as I think  you will not), you can return to your own home. Chapman feels very  kindly to you, and I have no doubt he will make your situation very  pleasant.          _Note for Law Lecture. Written about July 1, 1850_      I am not an accomplished lawyer. I find quite as much material for a  lecture in those points wherein I have failed, as in those wherein I  have been moderately successful. The leading rule for a lawyer, as for  the man of every other calling, is diligence. Leave nothing for  to-morrow which can be done to-day. Never let your correspondence fall  behind. Whatever piece of business you have in hand, before stopping, do  all the labour pertaining to it which can then be done. When you bring a  common law-suit, if you have the facts for doing so, write the  declaration at once. If a law point be involved, examine the books, and  note the authority you rely on upon the declaration itself, where you  are sure to find it when wanted. The same of defences and pleas. In  business not likely to be litigated,--ordinary collection cases,  foreclosures, partitions, and the like,--make all examinations of  titles, and note them and even draft orders and decrees in advance. The  course has a triple advantage; it avoids omissions and neglect, saves  your labour when once done, performs the labour out of court when you  have leisure, rather than in court when you have not.    Extemporaneous speaking should be practised and cultivated. It is the  lawyer's avenue to the public. However able and faithful he may be in  other respects, people are slow to bring him business if he cannot make  a speech. And yet there is not a more fatal error to young lawyers than  relying too much on speech-making. If any one, upon his rare powers of  speaking, shall claim an exemption from the drudgery of the law, his  case is a failure in advance.    Discourage litigation. Persuade your neighbours to compromise whenever  you can. Point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real  loser--in fees, expenses, and waste of time. As a peace-maker the lawyer  has a superior opportunity of being a good man. There will still be  business enough.    Never stir up litigation. A worse man can scarcely be found than one who  does this. Who can be more nearly a fiend than he who habitually  overhauls the register of deeds in search of defects in titles, whereon  to stir up strife, and put money in his pocket? A moral tone ought to be  infused into the profession which should drive such men out of it.    The matter of fees is important, far beyond the mere question of bread  and butter involved. Properly attended to, fuller justice is done to  both lawyer and client. An exorbitant fee should never be claimed. As a  general rule, never take your whole fee in advance, nor any more than a  small retainer. When fully paid beforehand, you are more than a common  mortal if you can feel the same interest in the case as if something was  still in prospect for you, as well as for your client. And when you lack  interest in the case the job will very likely lack skill and diligence  in the performance. Settle the amount of fee and take a note in advance.  Then you will feel that you are working for something, and you are sure  to do your work faithfully and well. Never sell a fee-note--at least not  before the consideration service is performed. It leads to negligence  and dishonesty--negligence by losing interest in the case, and  dishonesty in refusing to refund when you have allowed the consideration  to fail.    There is a vague popular belief that lawyers are necessarily dishonest.  I say vague, because when we consider to what extent confidence and  honours are reposed in and conferred upon lawyers by the people, it  appears improbable that their impression of dishonesty is very distinct  and vivid. Yet the impression is common, almost universal. Let no young  man choosing the law for a calling for a moment yield to the popular  belief. Resolve to be honest at all events; and if in your own judgment  you cannot be an honest lawyer, resolve to be honest without being a  lawyer. Choose some other occupation, rather than one in the choosing of  which you do, in advance, consent to be a knave.          _A Fragment. Written about July 1, 1854_    Equality in society alike beats inequality, whether the latter be of the  British aristocratic sort or of the domestic slavery sort.    We know Southern men declare that their slaves are better off than hired  labourers amongst us. How little they know whereof they speak! There is  no permanent class of hired labourers amongst us. Twenty-five years ago  I was a hired labourer. The hired labourer of yesterday labours on his  own account to-day, and will hire others to labour for him to-morrow.    Advancement--improvement in condition--is the order of things in a  society of equals. As labour is the common burden of our race, so the  effort of some to shift their share of the burden on to the shoulders of  others is the great durable curse of the race.

This was the earliest work of a local architect, Henry Bell, who is  almost unknown. He was mayor of King's Lynn, and died in 1717, and his  memory has been saved from oblivion by Mr. Beloe of that town, and is  enshrined in Mr. Blomfield's _History of Renaissance Architecture_:--      \"This admirable little building originally consisted of an open    loggia about 40 feet by 32 feet outside, with four columns down    the centre, supporting the first floor, and an attic storey above.    The walls are of Portland stone, with a Doric order to the ground    storey supporting an Ionic order to the first floor. The cornice    is of wood, and above this is a steep-pitched tile roof with    dormers, surmounted by a balustrade inclosing a flat, from which    rises a most picturesque wooden cupola. The details are extremely    refined, and the technical knowledge and delicate sense of scale    and proportion shown in this building are surprising in a designer    who was under thirty, and is not known to have done any previous    work.\"[5]      [5] _History of Renaissance Architecture_, by R. Blomfield.    A building which the town should make an effort to preserve is the old  \"Greenland Fishery House,\" a tenement dating from the commencement of  the seventeenth century.    The Duke's Head Inn, erected in 1689, now spoilt by its coating of  plaster, a house in Queen's Street, the old market cross, destroyed in  1831 and sold for old materials, and the altarpieces of the churches  of St. Margaret and St. Nicholas, destroyed during \"restoration,\" and  North Runcton church, three miles from Lynn, are other works of this  very able artist.    Until the Reformation Lynn was known as Bishop's Lynn, and galled  itself under the yoke of the Bishop of Norwich; but Henry freed the  townsfolk from their bondage and ordered the name to be changed to  Lynn Regis. Whether the good people throve better under the control of  the tyrant who crushed all their guilds and appropriated the spoil  than under the episcopal yoke may be doubtful; but the change pleased  them, and with satisfaction they placed the royal arms on their East  Gate, which, after the manner of gates and walls, has been pulled  down. If you doubt the former greatness of this old seaport you must  examine its civic plate. It possesses the oldest and most important  and most beautiful specimen of municipal plate in England, a grand,  massive silver-gilt cup of exquisite workmanship. It is called \"King  John's Cup,\" but it cannot be earlier than the reign of Edward III. In  addition to this there is a superb sword of state of the time of Henry  VIII, another cup, four silver maces, and other treasures. Moreover,  the town had a famous goldsmiths' company, and several specimens of  their handicraft remain. The defences of the town were sorely tried in  the Civil War, when for three weeks it sustained the attacks of the  rebels. The town was forced to surrender, and the poor folk were  obliged to pay ten shillings a head, besides a month's pay to the  soldiers, in order to save their homes from plunder. Lynn has many  memories. It sheltered King John when fleeing from the revolting  barons, and kept his treasures until he took them away and left them  in a still more secure place buried in the sands of the Wash. It  welcomed Queen Isabella during her retirement at Castle Rising,  entertained Edward IV when he was hotly pursued by the Earl of  Warwick, and has been worthy of its name as a loyal king's town.    Another walled town on the Norfolk coast attracts the attention of all  who love the relics of ancient times, Great Yarmouth, with its  wonderful record of triumphant industry and its associations with many  great events in history. Henry III, recognizing the important  strategical position of the town in 1260, granted a charter to the  townsfolk empowering them to fortify the place with a wall and a moat,  but more than a century elapsed before the fortifications were  completed. This was partly owing to the Black Death, which left few  men in Yarmouth to carry on the work. The walls were built of cut  flint and Caen stone, and extended from the north-east tower in St.  Nicholas Churchyard, called King Henry's Tower, to Blackfriars Tower  at the south end, and from the same King Henry's Tower to the  north-west tower on the bank of the Bure. Only a few years ago a large  portion of this, north of Ramp Row, now called Rampart Road, was taken  down, much to the regret of many. And here I may mention a grand  movement which might be with advantage imitated in every historic  town. A small private company has been formed called the \"Great  Yarmouth Historical Buildings, Limited.\" Its object is to acquire  and preserve the relics of ancient Yarmouth. The founders deserve the  highest praise for their public spirit and patriotism. How many  cherished objects in Vanishing England might have been preserved if  each town or county possessed such a valuable association! This  Yarmouth society owns the remains of the cloisters of Grey Friars and  other remains of ancient buildings. It is only to be regretted that it  was not formed earlier. There were nine gates in the walls of the  town, but none of them are left, and of the sixteen towers which  protected the walls only a very few remain.    [Illustration: The \"Bone Tower\", Town walls, Great Yarmouth]    These walls guard much that is important. The ecclesiastical buildings  are very fine, including the largest parish church in England, founded  by the same Herbert de Losinga whose good work we saw at King's Lynn.  The church of St. Nicholas has had many vicissitudes, and is now one  of the finest in the country. It was in medieval times the church of a  Benedictine Priory; a cell of the monastery at Norwich and the Priory  Hall remains, and is now restored and used as a school. Royal guests  have been entertained there, but part of the buildings were turned  into cottages and the great hall into stables. As we have said, part  of the Grey Friars Monastery remains, and also part of the house of  the Augustine Friars. The Yarmouth rows are a great feature of the  town. They are not like the Chester rows, but are long, narrow streets  crossing the town from east to west, only six feet wide, and one row  called Kitty-witches only measures at one end two feet three inches.  It has been suggested that this plan of the town arose from the  fishermen hanging out their nets to dry and leaving a narrow passage  between each other's nets, and that in course of time these narrow  passages became defined and were permanently retained. In former days  rich merchants and traders lived in the houses that line these rows,  and had large gardens behind their dwellings; and sometimes you can  see relics of former greatness--a panelled room or a richly decorated  ceiling. But the ancient glory of the rows is past, and the houses  are occupied now by fishermen or labourers. These rows are so narrow  that no ordinary vehicle could be driven along them. Hence there arose  special Yarmouth carts about three and a half feet wide and twelve  feet long with wheels underneath the body. Very brave and gallant have  always been the fishermen of Yarmouth, not only in fighting the  elements, but in defeating the enemies of England. History tells of  many a sea-fight in which they did good service to their king and  country. They gallantly helped to win the battle of Sluys, and sent  forty-three ships and one thousand men to help with the siege of  Calais in the time of Edward III. They captured and burned the town  and harbour of Cherbourg in the time of Edward I, and performed many  other acts of daring.    [Illustration: Row No. 83, Great Yarmouth]    One of the most interesting houses in the town is the Tolhouse, the  centre of the civic life of Yarmouth. It is said to be six hundred  years old, having been erected in the time of Henry III, though some  of the windows are decorated, but may have been inserted later. Here  the customs or tolls were collected, and the Corporation held its  meetings. There is a curious open external staircase leading to the  first floor, where the great hall is situated. Under the hall is a  gaol, a wretched prison wherein the miserable captives were chained to  a beam that ran down the centre. Nothing in the town bears stronger  witness to the industry and perseverance of the Yarmouth men than the  harbour. They have scoured the sea for a thousand years to fill their  nets with its spoil, and made their trade of world-wide fame, but  their port speaks louder in their praise. Again and again has the  fickle sea played havoc with their harbour, silting it up with sand  and deserting the town as if in revenge for the harvest they reap from  her. They have had to cut out no less than seven harbours in the  course of the town's existence, and royally have they triumphed over  all difficulties and made Yarmouth a great and prosperous port.    Near Yarmouth is the little port of Gorleston with its old jetty-head,  of which we give an illustration. It was once the rival of Yarmouth.  The old magnificent church of the Augustine Friars stood in this  village and had a lofty, square, embattled tower which was a landmark  to sailors. But the church was unroofed and despoiled at the  Reformation, and its remains were pulled down in 1760, only a small  portion of the tower remaining, and this fell a victim to a violent  storm at the beginning of the last century. The grand parish church  was much plundered at the Reformation, and left piteously bare by the  despoilers.    [Illustration: The Old Jetty, Gorleston]    The town, now incorporated with Yarmouth, has a proud boast:--            Gorleston was Gorleston ere Yarmouth begun,          And will be Gorleston when Yarmouth is done.
