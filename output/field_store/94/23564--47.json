The more  remarkable thing in the compulsion neurosis is the significance of the  impulses which create new sexual aims and appear independently of the  erogenous zones. Nevertheless, the eye corresponds to an erogenous zone  in the looking and exhibition mania, while the skin takes on the same  part in the pain and cruelty components of the sexual impulse. The skin,  which in special parts of the body becomes differentiated as sensory  organs and modified by the mucous membrane, is the erogenous zone,  [Greek: kat] ex ogen.[28]      EXPLANATION OF THE MANIFEST PREPONDERANCE OF SEXUAL PERVERSIONS IN THE  PSYCHONEUROSES    The sexuality of psychoneurotics has perhaps been placed in a false  light by the above discussions. It appears that the sexual behavior of  the psychoneurotic approaches in predisposition to the pervert and  deviates by just so much from the normal. Nevertheless, it is very  possible that the constitutional disposition of these patients besides  containing an immense amount of sexual repression and a predominant  force of sexual impulse also possesses an unusual tendency to  perversions in the broadest sense. However, an examination of milder  cases shows that the last assumption is not an absolute requisite, or at  least that in pronouncing judgment on the morbid effects one ought to  discount the effect of one of the factors. In most psychoneurotics the  disease first appears after puberty following the demands of the normal  sexual life. Against these the repression above all directs itself. Or  the disease comes on later, owing to the fact that the libido is unable  to attain normal sexual gratification. In both cases the libido behaves  like a stream the principal bed of which is dammed; it fills the  collateral roads which until now perhaps have been empty. Thus the  manifestly great (though to be sure negative) tendency to perversion in  psychoneurotics may be collaterally conditioned; at any rate, it is  certainly collaterally increased. The fact of the matter is that the  sexual repression has to be added as an inner factor to such external  ones as restriction of freedom, inaccessibility to the normal sexual  object, dangers of the normal sexual act, etc., which cause the origin  of perversions in individuals who might have otherwise remained normal.    In individual cases of neurosis the behavior may be different; now the  congenital force of the tendency to perversion may be more decisive and  at other times more influence may be exerted by the collateral increase  of the same through the deviation of the libido from the normal sexual  aim and object. It would be unjust to construe a contrast where a  cooperation exists. The greatest results will always be brought about by  a neurosis if constitution and experience cooperate in the same  direction. A pronounced constitution may perhaps be able to dispense  with the assistance of daily impressions, while a profound disturbance  in life may perhaps bring on a neurosis even in an average constitution.  These views similarly hold true in the etiological significance  of the congenital and the accidental experiences in other spheres.    If, however, preference is given to the assumption that an especially  formed tendency to perversions is characteristic of the psychoneurotic  constitution, there is a prospect of being able to distinguish a  multiformity of such constitutions in accordance with the congenital  preponderance of this or that erogenous zone, or of this or that partial  impulse. Whether there is a special relationship between the  predisposition to perversions and the selection of the morbid picture  has not, like many other things in this realm, been investigated.      REFERENCE TO THE INFANTILISM OF SEXUALITY    By demonstrating the perverted feelings as symptomatic formations in  psychoneurotics, we have enormously increased the number of persons who  can be added to the perverts. This is not only because neurotics  represent a very large proportion of humanity, but we must consider also  that the neuroses in all their gradations run in an uninterrupted series  to the normal state. Moebius was quite justified in saying that we are  all somewhat hysterical. Hence, the very wide dissemination of  perversions urged us to assume that the predisposition to perversions is  no rare peculiarity but must form a part of the normally accepted  constitution.    We have heard that it is a question whether perversions should be  referred to congenital determinations or whether they originate from  accidental experiences, just as Binet showed in fetichisms. Now we are  forced to the conclusion that there is indeed something congenital at  the basis of perversions, but it is something _which is congenital in  all persons_, which as a predisposition may fluctuate in intensity and  is brought into prominence by influences of life. We deal here with  congenital roots in the constitution of the sexual impulse which in one  series of cases develop into real carriers of sexual activity  (perverts); while in other cases they undergo an insufficient  suppression (repression), so that as morbid symptoms they are enabled to  attract to themselves in a round-about way a considerable part of the  sexual energy; while again in favorable cases between the two extremes  they originate the normal sexual life through effective restrictions and  other elaborations.    But we must also remember that the assumed constitution which shows the  roots of all perversions will be demonstrable only in the child, though  all impulses can be manifested in it only in moderate intensity. If we  are led to suppose that neurotics conserve the infantile state of their  sexuality or return to it, our interest must then turn to the sexual  life of the child, and we will then follow the play of influences which  control the processes of development of the infantile sexuality up to  its termination in a perversion, a neurosis or a normal sexual life.    [1] The facts contained in the first \"Contribution\" have been gathered  from the familiar publications of Krafft-Ebing, Moll, Moebius, Havelock  Ellis, Schrenk-Notzing, Loewenfeld, Eulenberg, J. Bloch, and M.  Hirschfeld, and from the later works published in the \"Jahrbuch fuer  sexuelle Zwischenstufen.\" As these publications also mention the other  literature bearing on this subject I may forbear giving detailed  references.    The conclusions reached through the investigation of sexual inverts are  all based on the reports of J. Sadger and on my own experience.    [2] For general use the word \"libido\" is best translated by \"craving.\"  (Prof. James J. Putnam, Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Vol. IV, 6.)    [3] For the difficulties entailed in the attempt to ascertain the  proportional number of inverts compare the work of M. Hirschfeld in the  Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen, 1904. Cf. also Brill, The  Conception of Homosexuality, Journal of the A.M.A., August 2, 1913.    [4] Such a striving against the compulsion to inversion favors cures by  suggestion of psychoanalysis.    [5] Many have justly emphasized the fact that the autobiographic  statements of inverts, as to the time of the appearance of their  tendency to inversion, are untrustworthy as they may have repressed from  memory any evidences of heterosexual feelings.    Psychoanalysis has confirmed this suspicion in all cases of inversion  accessible, and has decidedly changed their anamnesis by filling up the  infantile amnesias.    [6] With what reserve the diagnosis of degeneration should be made and  what slight practical significance can be attributed to it can be  gathered from the discussions of Moebius (Ueber Entartung; Grenzfragen  des Nerven- und Seelenlebens, No. III, 1900). He says: \"If we review the  wide sphere of degeneration upon which we have here turned some light we  can conclude without further ado that it is really of little value to  diagnose degeneration.\"    [7] We must agree with the spokesman of \"Uranism\" that some of the most  prominent men known have been inverts and perhaps absolute inverts.    [8] In the conception of inversion the pathological features have been  Separated from the anthropological. For this credit is due to I. Bloch  (Beitraege zur Aetiologie der Psychopathia Sexualis, 2 Teile, 1902-3), who  has also brought into prominence the existence of inversion in the old  civilized nations.    [9] Compare the last detailed discussion of somatic hermaphroditism  (Taruffi, Hermaphroditismus und Zeugungsunfaehigkeit, German edit. by R.  Teuscher, 1903), and the works of Neugebauer in many volumes of the  Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen.    [10] J. Halban, \"Die Entstehung der Geschlechtscharaktere,\" Arch. fuer  Gynaekologie, Bd. 70, 1903. See also there the literature on the subject.    [11] According to a report in Vol. 6 of the Jahrbuch f. sexuelle  Zwischenstufen, E. Gley is supposed to have been the first to mention  bisexuality as an explanation of inversion. He published a paper (Les  Aberrations de l'instinct Sexuel) in the Revue Philosophique as early as  January, 1884. It is moreover noteworthy that the majority of authors  who trace the inversion to bisexuality assume this factor not only for  the inverts but also for those who have developed normally, and justly  interpret the inversion as a result of a disturbance in development.  Among these authors are Chevalier (Inversion Sexuelle, 1893), and v.  Krafft-Ebing (\"Zur Erklaerung der kontraeren Sexualempfindung,\" Jahrbuecher  f. Psychiatrie u. Nervenheilkunde, XIII), who states that there are a  number of observations \"from which at least the virtual and continued  existence of this second center (of the underlying sex) results.\" A Dr.  Arduin (Die Frauenfrage und die sexuellen Zwischenstufen, 2d vol. of the  Jahrbuch f. sexuelle Zwischenstufen, 1900) states that \"in every man  there exist male and female elements.\" See also "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14970"],[0,"Academica (#8)"],[1,"that Cicero was afraid of  the effect the work might produce on the public. This notion Cicero assured  him to be wrong; the only cause for his vacillation was his doubt as to how  Varro would receive the dedication[184]. Atticus would seem to have  repeatedly communicated with Varro, and to have assured Cicero that there  was no cause for fear; but the latter refused to take a general assurance,  and anxiously asked for a detailed account of the reasons from which it  proceeded[185]. In order to stimulate his friend, Atticus affirmed that  Varro was jealous of some to whom Cicero had shown more favour[186]. We  find Cicero eagerly asking for more information, on this point: was it  Brutus of whom Varro was jealous? It seems strange that Cicero should not  have entered into correspondence with Varro himself. Etiquette seems to  have required that the recipient of a dedication should be assumed ignorant  of the intentions of the donor till they were on the point of being  actually carried out. Thus although Cicero saw Brutus frequently while at  Tusculum, he apparently did not speak to him about the _De Finibus_, but  employed Atticus to ascertain his feeling about the dedication[187].    Cicero's own judgment about the completed second edition of the _Academica_  is often given in the letters. He tells us that it extended, on the whole,  to greater length than the first, though much had been omitted; he adds,  \"Unless human self love deceives me, the books have been so finished that  the Greeks themselves have nothing in the same department of literature to  approach them.... This edition will be more brilliant, more terse, and  altogether better than the last[188].\" Again: \"The Antiochean portion has  all the point of Antiochus combined with any polish my style may  possess[189].\" Also: \"I have finished the book with I know not what  success, but with a care which nothing could surpass[190].\" The binding and  adornment of the presentation copy for Varro received great attention, and  the letter accompanying it was carefully elaborated[191]. Yet after  everything had been done and the book had been sent to Atticus at Rome,  Cicero was still uneasy as to the reception it would meet with from Varro.  He wrote thus to Atticus: \"I tell you again and again that the presentation  will be at your own risk. So if you begin to hesitate, let us desert to  Brutus, who is also a follower of Antiochus. 0 Academy, on the wing as thou  wert ever wont, flitting now hither, now thither!\" Atticus on his part  \"shuddered\" at the idea of taking the responsibility[192]. After the work  had passed into his hands, Cicero begged him to take all precautions to  prevent it from getting into circulation until they could meet one another  in Rome[193]. This warning was necessary, because Balbus and Caerellia had  just managed to get access to the _De Finibus_[194]. In a letter, dated  apparently a day or two later, Cicero declared his intention to meet  Atticus at Rome and send the work to Varro, should it be judged advisable  to do so, after a consultation[195]. The meeting ultimately did not take  place, but Cicero left the four books in Atticus' power, promising to  approve any course that might be taken[196]. Atticus wrote to say that as  soon as Varro came to Rome the books would be sent to him. \"By this time,  then,\" says Cicero, when he gets the letter, \"you have taken the fatal  step; oh dear! if you only knew at what peril to yourself! Perhaps my  letter stopped you, although you had not read it when you wrote. I long to  hear how the matter stands[197].\" Again, a little later: \"You have been  bold enough, then, to give Varro the books? I await his judgment upon them,  but when will he read them?\" Varro probably received the books in the first  fortnight of August, 45 B.C., when Cicero was hard at work on the _Tusculan  Disputations_[198]. A copy of the first edition had already got into  Varro's hands, as we learn from a letter, in which Cicero begs Atticus to  ask Varro to make some alterations in his copy of the _Academica_, at a  time when the fate of the second edition was still undecided[199]. From  this fact we may conclude that Cicero had given up all hope of suppressing  the first edition. If he consoles Atticus for the uselessness of his copies  of the first edition, it does not contradict my supposition, for Cicero of  course assumes that Atticus, whatever may be the feeling of other people,  wishes to have the \"Splendidiora, breviora, meliora.\" Still, on every  occasion which offered, the author sought to point out as his authorised  edition the one in four books. He did so in a passage written immediately  after the _Academica Posteriora_ was completed[200], and often  subsequently, when he most markedly mentioned the number of the books as  four[201]. That he wished the work to bear the title _Academica_ is  clear[202]. The expressions _Academica quaestio_, [Greek: Akademike  syntaxis], and _Academia_, are merely descriptive[203]; so also is the  frequent appellation _Academici libri_[204]. The title _Academicae  Quaestiones_, found in many editions, is merely an imitation of the  _Tusculanae Quaestiones_, which was supported by the false notion, found as  early as Pliny[205], that Cicero had a villa called Academia, at which the  book was written. He had indeed a Gymnasium at his Tusculan villa, which he  called his Academia, but we are certain from the letters to Atticus that  the work was written entirely at Astura, Antium, and Arpinum.    Quintilian seems to have known the first edition very well[206], but the  second edition is the one which is most frequently quoted. The four books  are expressly referred to by Nonius, Diomedes, and Lactantius, under the  title _Academica_. Augustine speaks of them only as _Academici libri_, and  his references show that he knew the second edition only. Lactantius also  uses this name occasionally, though he generally speaks of the _Academica_.  Plutarch shows only a knowledge of the first edition[207].    I have thought it advisable to set forth in plain terms the history of the  genesis of the book, as gathered from Cicero's letters to Atticus. That it  was not unnecessary to do so may be seen from the astounding theories which  old scholars of great repute put forward concerning the two editions. A  fair summary of them may be seen in the preface of Goerenz. I now proceed  to examine into the constitution and arrangement of the two editions.    a. _The lost dialogue \"Catulus.\"_    The whole of the characters in this dialogue and the _Lucullus_ are among  those genuine Optimates and adherents of the senatorial party whom Cicero  so loves to honour. The Catulus from whom the lost dialogue was named was  son of the illustrious colleague of Marius. With the political career of  father and son we shall have little to do. I merely inquire what was their  position with respect to the philosophy of the time, and the nature of  their connection with Cicero.    Catulus the younger need not detain us long. It is clear from the  _Lucullus_[208] that he did little more than put forward opinions he had  received from his father. Cicero would, doubtless, have preferred to  introduce the elder man as speaking for himself, but in that case, as in  the _De Oratore_, the author would have been compelled to exclude himself  from the conversation[209]. The son, therefore, is merely the mouthpiece of  the father, just as Lucullus, in the dialogue which bears his name, does  nothing but render literally a speech of Antiochus, which he professes to  have heard[210]. For the arrangement in the case of both a reason is to be  found in their [Greek: atripsia] with respect to philosophy[211]. This  [Greek: atripsia] did not amount to [Greek: apaideusia], or else Cicero  could not have made Catulus the younger the advocate of philosophy in the  _Hortensius_[212]. Though Cicero sometimes classes the father and son  together as men of literary culture and perfect masters of Latin style, it  is very evident on a comparison of all the passages where the two are  mentioned, that no very high value was placed on the learning of the  son[213]. But however slight were the claims of Catulus the younger to be  considered a philosopher, he was closely linked to Cicero by other ties.  During all the most brilliant period of Cicero's life, Catulus was one of  the foremost Optimates of Rome, and his character, life, and influence are  often depicted in even extravagant language by the orator[214]. He is one  of the pillars of the state[215], Cicero cries, and deserves to be classed  with the ancient worthies of Rome[216]. When he opposes the Manilian law,  and asks the people on whom they would rely if Pompey, with such gigantic  power concentrated in his hands, were to die, the people answer with one  voice \"On you[217].\" He alone was bold enough to rebuke the follies, on the  one hand, of the mob, on the other, of the senate[218]. In him no storm of  danger, no favouring breeze of fortune, could ever inspire either fear or  hope, or cause to swerve from his own course[219]. His influence, though he  be dead, will ever live among his countrymen[220]. He was not only glorious  in his life, but fortunate in his death[221].    Apart from Cicero's general agreement with Catulus in politics, there were  special causes for his enthusiasm. Catulus was one of the _viri consulares_  who had given their unreserved approval to the measures taken for the  suppression of the Catilinarian conspiracy, and was the first to confer on  Cicero the greatest glory of his life, the title \"Father of his  country[222].\" So closely did Cicero suppose himself to be allied to  Catulus, that a friend tried to console him for the death of Tullia, by  bidding him remember \"Catulus and the olden times[223].\" The statement of  Catulus, often referred to by Cicero, that Rome had never been so  unfortunate as to have two bad consuls in "]]]
