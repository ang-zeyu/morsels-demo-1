[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18206"],[0,"Navaho Houses (#8)"],[1,"are the sweat houses, called in the Navaho language  _co'tce_, a term probably derived from _qaco'tsil_, \"sweat\" and  _[)i]nc[)i]nil'tce_, the manner in which fire is prepared for heating  the stones placed in it when it is used. The structure is designed to  hold only one person at a time, and he must crawl in and squat on his  heels with his knees drawn up to his chin.    In the construction of these little huts a frame is made of three boughs  with forked ends, and these have the same names as the corresponding  timbers in a hogan. They are placed, as in the hogan, with the lower  ends spread apart like a low tripod. Two straight sticks leaned against  the apex form a narrow entrance, which, as in the hogan, invariably  faces the east. Numerous other sticks and boughs inclose the frame,  and enough bark and earth are laid on to make the structure practically  air-tight when the entrance is closed.    When the place is to be used a fire is made close beside it, and in  this fire numerous stones are heated. The patient to be treated is  then stripped, placed inside the little hut, and given copious drafts  sometimes of warm or hot water. The nearly red-hot stones are rolled in  beside him and the entrance is closed with several blankets, forming in  fact a hot-air bath. In a short time the air in the interior rises to a  high temperature and the subject sweats profusely. When he is released  he rubs himself dry with sand, or if he be ill and weak he is rubbed  dry by his friends. This ceremony has a very important place in the  medicine-man's therapeutics, for devils as well as diseases are thus  cast out; but aside from their religious use, the _co'tce_ are often  visited by the Indians for the cleansing and invigorating effect of  the bath, with no thought of ceremonial. The Navaho, as a race or  individually, are not remarkable for cleanliness, but they use the  _co'tce_ freely.      [Illustration: Fig. 240--Low earth-covered shelter]    During the _Yeb[)i]tcai_ dance or ceremony four _co'tce_ are set around  the song house, about 40 yards distant from it, one at each cardinal  point. The _qacal'i_, or chief medicine-man, sweats the patient in them  on four successive mornings, just at dawn, beginning with the east and  using one each morning. The _co'tce_ on the east is merely an uncovered  frame, and after the patient enters it and hot stones have been rolled  in it is covered with many blankets and a large buckskin is spread over  all. On this skin the _qacal'i_ sprinkles iron ochers and other colored  sands in striated bands, symbolic of the rainbow and sunbeams which  covered the early mythic houses. He and his assistants stand near the  hut shaking rattles and singing a brief song to Qastcej[)i]ni, at the  conclusion of which the patient is released. The initial spark of the  fire used at these ceremonies and for all religious purposes is obtained  by friction, and is regarded as essentially different from fire produced  by flint and steel or otherwise, because the first spark of friction  fire was brought from Qastcej[)i]ni, who is the god of the underworld  fire. The production of fire by friction is a very simple matter to  these Indians and is often done in play; frequently, under the windy  conditions that prevail in their country, in but little more time than a  white man can accomplish the same result with matches. For this purpose  they often use the dry, brittle stalks of the common bee weed (_Cleome  pungens_). The drill, which is whirled between the palms of the hands,  consists of a stalk perhaps a quarter of an inch in diameter. This is  made to revolve on the edge of a small notch cut into a larger stalk,  perhaps an inch in diameter. A pinch of sand is sometimes placed under  the point of the drill, the rapid revolution of which produces a fine  powder. This powder runs down the notch or groove, forming a little pile  on the ground. Smoke is produced in less than a minute, and finally, in  perhaps two minutes, tiny sparks drop on the little pile of dry powder,  which takes fire from them. By careful fostering by feeding with bits  of bark and grass, and with much blowing, a blaze is produced.    It is said that First-man made the first _co'tce_. After coming up the  _qadjinai_, or magic reed, he was very dirty; his skin was discolored  and he had a foul smell like a coyote. He washed with water, but that  did not cleanse him. Then Qastcej[)i]ni sent the firefly to instruct him  concerning the _co'tce_ and how to rotate a spindle of wood in a notched  stick. As First-man revolved the spindle, or drill, between his hands,  Firefly ignited the dust at its point with a spark of fire which  Qastcej[)i]ni had given it for that purpose. There is another myth  concerning the origin of these little sweat houses which does not agree  with that just stated. According to this myth, the _co'tce_ were made by  the Sun when the famous twins, Nayen[)e]zgani and Co'badj[)i]stcini,  who play so large a part in Navaho mythology, were sent to him by  Estsanatlehi. When they reached the house of the Sun they called him  father, as they had been instructed to do, but the Sun disowned them and  subjected them to many ordeals, and even thrust at them with a spear,  but the mother had given each of the youths a magic feather mantle  impervious to any weapon. Klehanoai (the night bearer--the moon) also  scoffed at them and filled the mind of the Sun with doubts concerning  the paternity of the twins, so he determined to subject them to a  further ordeal.    He made four _co'tce_, but instead of using wood in their construction  he made them of a metallic substance, like iron. He placed these at the  cardinal points and sent the moon to make a fire near each of them. This  fire was obtained from the \"burning stars,\" the comets. The _co'tce_  were made exceedingly hot and the twins were placed in them  successively; but instead of being harmed they came out of the last one  stronger and more vigorous than ever. Then the Sun acknowledged them  as his sons and gave the elder one the magic weapons with which he  destroyed the evil genii who infested the Navaho land. This is the  reason, the Navaho say, why it is well to have many _co'tce_ and to use  them frequently. Their use gives rest and sweet sleep after hard work;  it invigorates a man for a long journey and refreshes him after its  accomplishment.    First-woman, after coming up the _qadjinai_, was also foul and ill  smelling, and after First-man she also used the _co'tce_. Hence the  Navaho women use the _co'tce_ like the men, but never together except  under a certain condition medical in character. The _co'tce_ is built  usually in some secluded spot, and frequently large parties of men go  together to spend the better part of a day in the enjoyment of the  luxury of a sweat bath and a scour with sand. On another day the women  of the neighborhood get together and do the same, and the men regard  their privacy strictly.      EFFECT OF MODERN CONDITIONS    Up to a comparatively recent period the Navaho have been what is usually  termed a \"wild tribe;\" that is, they have existed principally by war and  plunder. Since the conquest of the country by General Kearny and the  \"Army of the West,\" in 1846, they have given us but little trouble, but  prior to that time they preyed extensively on the Pueblo Indians and the  Mexican settlements along the Rio Grande. Practically all their wealth  today, and they are a wealthy tribe, consists of thousands of sheep  and goats and hundreds of horses, all descended from flocks and herds  originally stolen. When the country came into the possession of the  United States marauding expeditions became much less frequent, and  almost insensibly the tribe changed from a predatory to a pastoral  people. But aside from the infrequency or absence of armed expeditions  the life of the people remained much the same under the changed  conditions. When the Atlantic and Pacific railroad entered the country  some sixteen or seventeen years ago traders came with it, although there  were a few in the country before, and numerous trading posts were  established in the reservation and about its borders. The effect of  this was to fix the pastoral habits of the people. Wool and pelts were  exchanged for flour, sugar, and coffee, and for calico prints and dyes,  and gradually a demand for these articles was established.    The men looked after their herds of horses and took very good care of  the few cattle that drifted into the reservation; the women attended  to their domestic duties and, with the aid of the children, took care  of the sheep and goats, which, according to long-established custom,  belonged exclusively to them. Agriculture was practically unknown. But  with the removal of the duty on wool a new era opened for the Navaho.  The price of wool fell to about one-half of the former figure, and a  flock of sheep no longer furnished the means for procuring the articles  which had grown to be necessities. The people were gradually but surely  forced to horticulture to procure the means of subsistence. It is this  tendency which is especially destructive of the old house-building  ideas, and which will eventually cause a complete change in the houses  of the people. Recently the tendency has been emphasized by the  construction, under governmental supervision, of a number of small  irrigating ditches in the mountain districts. The result of these works  must be eventually to collect the Navaho into small communities, and  practically to destroy the present pastoral life and replace it with  new and, perhaps, improved conditions.    But many of the arts of the Navaho, and especially their house building,  grew out of and conformed to the old methods of life. It is hardly to be  supposed that they will continue under the new conditions, and, in fact,  pronounced variations are already apparent. Up to ten years ago there  was so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18222"],[0,"The Religion of Numa (#8)"],[1," Her  great festival was on the 19th of March, a day which had been originally  sacred to Mars, but the presence of Minerva's celebrations on that day  soon caused the associations with Mars to be almost entirely forgotten.  Socially her temple became the meeting-place of all the artisans of  Rome, it was at once their religious centre and their business  headquarters. There they met in their primitive guilds (_collegia_) and  arranged their affairs, and thus it continued to be as long as pagan  Rome lasted. The respect shown to these guilds of Minerva is nowhere  more clearly exhibited than in an incident which happened in the time of  the Second Punic War, several centuries after the introduction of the  cult. Terrified by adverse portents the Roman Senate instructed the old  poet Livius Andronicus to write a hymn in honour of Juno and to train a  chorus of youths and maidens to sing it. The hymn was sung, and was such  a great success that the gratitude of the Senate took the form of  granting permission to the poets of the city to have a guild of their  own, and a meeting-place along with the older guilds in the temple of  Minerva on the Aventine. This was the Roman state's first expression of  literary appreciation; from her standpoint it was flattery indeed, for  were not poets by this decree made equal to butchers, bakers, and  cloth-makers, and was not poetry acknowledged to be of some practical  use and adjudged a legitimate occupation?    The history of the cult of Minerva is much more complicated than that of  Hercules or Castor. Like them she was subjected to strong Greek  influence, and, as we shall see later, not very long after her  introduction she was taken into the company of Juppiter and Juno, thus  forming the famous Capitoline triad. Also temples were built to her  individually under various aspects of the worship of Athena with whom  she gradually became identified, but in the old Aventine temple the  original idea of Minerva, the working man's friend, continued  practically unchanged. Doubtless the society of Servius's day, who  witnessed the coming of Minerva, did not realise what this introduction  meant, and how absolutely necessary it was for Rome's future  development that the artisan class should be among her people, and that  this class should be represented in the world of the gods. They little  knew that in the temple on the Aventine was being brought to expression  the trade-union idea, which was to pass over into the mediaeval guild of  both workmen and masters, still under religious auspices, and to find a  latter-day parody in the modern labour-union, with its spirit of  hostility to employers, and its indifference, at least as an  organisation, to things religious.    Trade and handicraft were thus added to the Roman world, of men on  earth, and of the gods above the earth, and it remains for us to  consider the awakening of the political spirit and its corresponding  religious phenomenon; but before we do this, we must clear the way by  casting aside one ancient hypothesis connected with Servius's religious  reforms, which is not correct, at least in the way in which the ancients  meant it.    The writing of the earlier period of Rome's history is sometimes  complicated rather than helped by the statements of the generally  well-meaning but often misguided historians of later times. Their real  knowledge of the facts was in many cases no greater than ours, while  they lacked what modern historians possess: a breadth of view and a  knowledge of the phenomena of history in many periods and among many  nations. The study of the social and religious movements under Servius  presents us with an interesting illustration of this. It was customary  namely to ascribe to Servius Tullius the introduction of the cult of  Fortuna, and Plutarch takes occasion twice in his _Moralia_ to describe  the interest of Servius in this cult and to recount the extraordinary  number of temples which he built to the great goddess of chance under  her various attributes. The Romans of Plutarch's day thought of Fortuna  in very much the way in which their poets, especially Horace, described  her, as a great and powerful goddess of chance, the personification of  the element of apparent caprice which seems to be present in the running  of the universe. It is very much our way of thinking of her, and of  course both our own concept and the later Roman concept go back to  Greece. But Greece had not always had this idea of the goddess of luck.  The older purer age of Greek thought was permeated with the idea of the  absolute immutable character of the divine will, a belief which  precluded the possibility of chance or caprice. The earliest Greek Tyche  (Fortuna) was the daughter of Zeus who fulfilled his will; and that his  will through her was often a beneficent will is shown in the tendency to  think of her as a goddess of plenty. It was only the growth of  scepticism, the failure of faith to bear up under the apparently  contradictory lessons of experience, which brought into being in the  Alexandrian age Tyche, the goddess of chance, the winged capricious  deity poised on the ball. It was this habit of thought which eventually  gave the Romans that idea of Fortuna which has became our idea because  it is the prevalent one in Roman literature and life in the periods with  which we are most familiar. Now if Fortuna be thought of in this latter  way, it is a very easy matter to connect her with Servius Tullius, for  the legendary accounts of Servius's career picture him as a very child  of \"fortune,\" raised from the lowest estate to the highest power, the  little slave boy who became king. What goddess would he delight to  honour, if not the goddess of the happy chance which had made him what  he was?    All this is very pretty, but it is unfortunately quite impossible,  because whatever the time may have been when Fortuna began to be  worshipped in Rome, it is certain that the idea of chance did not enter  into the concept of her until long after Servius's day. Instead the  early Fortuna was a goddess of plenty and fertility, among mankind as a  protectress of women and of childbirth, among the crops and the herds as  a goddess of fertility and fecundity. Her full name was probably Fors  Fortuna, a name which survived in two old temples across the river from  Rome proper, in Trastevere, where she was worshipped in the country by  the farmers in behalf of the crops. Fortuna is thus merely the cult-name  added to the old goddess Fors to intensify her meaning, which finally  broke off from her and became independent, expressing the same idea of  a goddess of plenty. Later under Greek influence the concept of luck,  especially good-luck, slowly displaced the older idea. The possibility  of such a transition from fertility to good-luck is shown us in the  phrase \"_arbor felix_,\" which originally meant a fruitful tree and later  a tree of good omen. As regards Fortuna and Servius therefore there is  no inherent reason why they should have been connected, and whenever it  was that Fortuna began to exist, be it before or after Servius, she came  into the world as a goddess of plenty and did not turn into a goddess of  luck till centuries after her birth.    It must not be supposed that Rome in this sixth century before Christ  could take into herself all these traders and artisans, and become thus  interested also among her own citizens in these new employments, without  receiving a corresponding impulse toward a larger political life. Thus  there began that ever-increasing participation in the affairs of the  Latin league, which was her first step toward acquiring a world  dominion. It is probable that Rome had always belonged to this league,  but at first as a very insignificant member. Those were the days in  which Alba Longa stood out as leader, a leadership which she afterwards  lost, but of which the recollection was retained because the Alban Mount  behind Alba Longa remained the cult-centre, connected with the worship  of the god of the league, the Juppiter of the Latins (Juppiter  Latiaris), not only until B.C. 338 when the league ceased to exist, but  even later when Rome kept up a sentimental celebration of the old  festival. In the course of time, for reasons which we do not know, Alba  Longa's power declined and the mantle of her supremacy fell upon Aricia,  a little town still in existence not far from Albano. The coming of  Aricia to the presidency of the league started a religious movement  which is one of the most extraordinary in the checkered history of Roman  religion. The ultimate result of this movement was the introduction of  the goddess Diana into the state-cult of Rome, where she was  subsequently identified with Apollo's sister Artemis. But this is a long  story, and to understand it we must go back some distance to make our  beginning.    Among the more savage tribes and in the wilder mountain regions of both  Greece and Italy there was worshipped a goddess who had a different name  in each country, Artemis in Greece, Diana in Italy, but who was in  nature very much the same. This does not imply that it was the same  goddess originally or that the early Artemis of Greece had any influence  on the Diana of Italy. Their similarity was probably caused merely by  the similarity of the conditions from which they sprang, the similar  needs of the two peoples. She was a goddess of the woods, and of nature,  and especially of wild animals, a patroness of the hunt and the  huntsman, but also a goddess of all small animals, of all helpless  little ones, and a helper too of those that bore them, hence a goddess  of birth, and in the sphere of mankind a goddess of women and of  childbirth. Later in Greece Artemis was absorbed into the sea-cult of  Apollo on the island of Delos, where she became Apollo's sister, like  him the child of Latona; but naturally Diana experienced no similar  change"]]]
