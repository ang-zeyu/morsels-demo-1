His daughter Amytis and his  son-in-law Spitamas concealed him so successfully on the top of the  palace, that he escaped discovery up to the moment when Cyrus was on  the point of torturing his grandchildren to force them to reveal his  hiding-place: thereupon he gave himself up to his enemies, but was at  length, after being subjected to harsh treatment for a time, set at  liberty and entrusted with the government of a mountain tribe dwelling  to the south-east of the Caspian Sea, that of the Barcanians. Later on  he perished through the treachery of OEbaras, and his corpse was left  unburied in the desert, but by divine interposition relays of lions were  sent to guard it from the attacks of beasts of prey: Cyrus, acquainted  with this miraculous circumstance, went in search of the body and gave  it a magnificent burial.* Another legend asserted, on the contrary,  that Cyrus was closely connected with the royal line of Cyaxares; this  tradition was originally circulated among the great Median families who  attached themselves to the Achaemenian dynasty.**         * The passage in Herodotus leads Marquart to believe that       the murder of Astyages formed part of the primitive legend,       but was possibly attributed to Cambysos, son of Cyrus,       rather than to OEbaras, the companion of the conqueror's       early years.         ** This is the legend as told to Herodotus in Asia Minor,       probably by the members of the family of Harpagus, which the       Greek historian tried to render credible by interpreting the       miraculous incidents in a rationalising manner.    [Illustration: 042.jpg REMAINS OF THE PALACE OF ECBATANA]         Drawn by Boudier, from Coste and Flandin.    According to this legend Astyages had no male heirs, and the sceptre  would have naturally descended from him to his daughter Mandane and  her sons. Astyages was much alarmed by a certain dream concerning his  daughter: he dreamt that water gushed forth so copiously from her  womb as to flood not only Ecbatana, but the whole of Asia, and the  interpreters, as much terrified as himself, counselled him not to give  Mandane in marriage to a Persian noble of the race of the Achaemenids,  named Cambyses; but a second dream soon troubled the security into which  this union had lulled him: he saw issuing from his daughter's womb a  vine whose branches overshadowed Asia, and the interpreters, being once  more consulted, predicted that a grandson was about to be born to him  whose ambition would cost him his crown. He therefore bade a certain  nobleman of his court, named Harpagus--he whose descendants preserved  this version of the story of Cyrus--to seize the infant and put it to  death as soon as its mother should give it birth; but the man, touched  with pity, caused the child to be exposed in the woods by one of the  royal shepherds. A bitch gave suck to the tiny creature, who, however,  would soon have succumbed to the inclemency of the weather, had not the  shepherd's wife, being lately delivered of a still-born son, persuaded  her husband to rescue the infant, whom she nursed with the same  tenderness as if he had been her own child. The dog was, as we know, a  sacred animal among the Iranians: the incident of the bitch seems, then,  to have been regarded by them as an indication of divine intervention,  but the Greeks were shocked by the idea, and invented an explanation  consonant with their own customs. They supposed that the woman had borne  the name of Spako: Spako signifying _bitch_ in the language of Media.*         * Herodotus asserts that the child's foster-mother was       called in Greek _Kyno_, in Median _Spalco_, which comes to       the same thing, for _spaha_ means _bitch_ in Median. Further       on he asserts that the parents of the child heard of the       name of his nurse with joy, as being of good augury; \"and,       in order that the Persians might think that Cyrus had been       preserved alive by divine agency, _they spread abroad the       report that Cyrus had been suckled by a bitch_. And thus       arose the fable commonly accepted.\" Trogus Pompeius received       the original story probably through Dinon, and inserted it       in his book.    Cyrus grew to boyhood, and being accepted by Mandane as her son,  returned to the court; his grandfather consented to spare his life, but,  to avenge himself on Harpagus, he caused the limbs of the nobleman's own  son to be served up to him at a feast. Thenceforth Harpagus had but  one idea, to overthrow the tyrant and transfer the crown to the young  prince: his project succeeded, and Cyrus, having overcome Astyages,  was proclaimed king by the Medes as well as by the Persians. The real  history of Cyrus, as far as we can ascertain it, was less romantic. We  gather that Kurush, known to us as Cyrus, succeeded his father Cambyses  as ruler of Anshan about 559 or 558 B.C.,* and that he revolted against  Astyages in 553 or 552 B.C.,** and defeated him. The Median army  thereupon seizing its own leader, delivered him into the hands of the  conqueror: Ecbatana was taken and sacked, and the empire fell at one  blow, or, more properly speaking, underwent a transformation (550 B.C.).  The transformation was, in fact, an internal revolution in which the  two peoples of the same race changed places. The name of the Medes lost  nothing of the prestige which it enjoyed in foreign lands, but that of  the Persians was henceforth united with it, and shared its renown: like  Astyages and his predecessors, Cyrus and his successors reigned equally  over the two leading branches of the ancient Iranian stock, but whereas  the former had been kings of the Medes and Persians, the latter became  henceforth kings of the Persians and Medes.***         * The length of Cyrus' reign is fixed at thirty years by       Ctesias, followed by Dinon and Trogus Pompeius, but at       twenty-nine years by Herodotus, whose computation I here       follow. Hitherto the beginning of his reign has been made to       coincide with the fall of Astyages, which was consequently       placed in 569 or 568 B.C., but the discovery of the _Annals       of Nabonidus_ obliges us to place the taking of Ecbatana in       the sixth year of the Babylonian king, which corresponds to       the year 550 B.C., and consequently to hold that Cyrus       reckoned his twenty-nine years from the moment when he       succeeded his father Cambyses.         ** The inscription on the _Rassam Cylinder of Abu-Habba_,       seems to make the fall of the Median king, who was suzerain       of the Scythians of Harran, coincide with the third year of       Nabonidus, or the year 553-2 B.C. But it is only the date of       the commencement of hostilities between Cyrus and Astyages       which is here furnished, and this manner of interpreting the       text agrees with the statement of the Median traditions       handed down by the classical authors, that three combats       took place between Astyages and Cyrus before the final       victory of the Persians.         *** This equality of the two peoples is indicated by the       very terms employed by Darius, whom he speaks of them, in       the _Great Inscription of Behistun_. He says, for example,       in connection with the revolt of the false Smerdis, that       \"the deception prevailed greatly in the land, in Persia and       Media as well as in the other provinces,\" and further on,       that \"the whole people rose, and passed over from Cambyses       to him, Persia and Media as well as the other countries.\" In       the same way he mentions \"the army of Persians and Medes       which was with him,\" and one sees that he considered Medes       and Persians to be on exactly the same footing.    The change effected was so natural that their nearest neighbours, the  Chaldaeans, showed no signs of uneasiness at the outset. They confined  themselves to the bare registration of the fact in their annals at the  appointed date, without comment, and Nabonidus in no way deviated from  the pious routine which it had hitherto pleased him to follow. Under  a sovereign so good-natured there was little likelihood of war, at all  events with external foes, but insurrections were always breaking out in  different parts of his territory, and we read of difficulties in Khume  in the first year of his reign, in Hamath in his second year, and  troubles in Plionicia in the third year, which afforded an opportunity  for settling the Tyrian question. Tyre had led a far from peaceful  existence ever since the day when, from sheer apathy, she had accepted  the supremacy of Nebuchadrezzar.*         * All these events are known through the excerpt from       Menander preserved to us by Josephus in his treatise       _Against Apion_.    Baal II. had peacefully reigned there for ten years (574-564), but after  his death the people had overthrown the monarchy, and various _suffetes_  had followed one another rapidly--Eknibaal ruled two months, Khelbes ten  months, the high priest Abbar three months, the two brothers Mutton  and Gerastratus six years, all of them no doubt in the midst of endless  disturbances; whereupon a certain Baalezor restored the royal dignity,  but only to enjoy it for the space of one year. On his death, the  inhabitants begged the Chaldaeans to send them, as a successor to the  crown, one of those princes whom, according to custom, Baal had not long  previously given over as hostages for a guarantee of his loyalty, and  Nergal-sharuzur for this purpose selected from their number Mahar-baal,  who was probably a son of Ithobaal (558-557).* When, at the end of four  years, the death of Mahar-baal left the throne vacant (554-553), the  Tyrians petitioned for his brother Hirom, and Nabonidus, who was then  engaged in Syria, came south as far as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17330"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 10 (of 12) (#8)"],[1,"him as the conqueror, and for the moment  he stood in unequivocal possession of that power for which Perdiccas  had worked so hard, and which he had so much abused. Who was now to  be Perdiccas' successor, and to manage the kingdom in the name of the  kings? With one voice the people begged Ptolemy to undertake this task.  The foresight and presence of mind of the son of Lagus were not clouded  by the allurement of such an offer gained by his sudden change of  fortune. At this supreme moment he acted with consummate sagacity. He  divined that a refusal of the proffered honour would make him in reality  more powerful, although, at the moment, he would seem to be acting in an  unselfish manner. He recommended to the army, as a favour which he had  to bestow, those he thought worthy of his thanks; they were Python,  the Median strategist, who had taken the first decisive step against  Perdiccas; and Arridaeus, who, in spite of Perdiccas' orders, had taken  the body of the king to Egypt. These two were nominated regents with  loud cheers.    The Macedonian army, accordingly, chose Python and Arridaeus as  guardians, and as rulers with unlimited power over the whole of  Alexander's conquests; but, though none of the Greek generals who now  held Asia Minor, Syria, Babylonia, Thrace, or Egypt dared to acknowledge  it to the soldiers, yet in reality the power of the guardians was  limited to the little kingdom of Macedonia. With the death of Perdiccas,  and the withdrawal of his army, Phoenicia and Coele-Syria were left  unguarded, and almost without a master. In order that Egypt might take  an important part in the universal policy, Ptolemy felt he must possess  Syria, which would open up the way for him to the countries along the  Euphrates and the Tigris, and also the island of Cyprus, where he would  be near the coast of Asia Minor. He could not yet think of conquering  Cyprus, which had an important fleet. He felt that, if he annexed Syria,  either by diplomacy or by force, the organisation of the kingdom and the  territorial division of power would be changed in a tangible manner.  The Egyptian satraps already possessed some measure of authority, and he  could also depend upon the satrap of Syria joining him.    Perdiccas had bestowed this satrapy upon Laomedon, the Amphysolite,  who had taken no part in the great fight between Perdiccas and Ptolemy.  Ptolemy now informed him that he wished to possess his satrapy, but was  ready to compensate him with a sum of money. Laomedon refused this offer  with scorn. Thereupon, an army under Nicanor, one of the \"friends\" of  Ptolemy, marched into Palestine. Jerusalem was the only place that  held out against the Egyptian army; but Nicanor, says the historian  Agathareides, seeing that on every seventh day the garrison withdrew  from the walls, chose that day for the assault, and thus gained the  city. Without further opposition the Egyptians marched onwards. At  last he met Laomedon, took him prisoner, and brought him back to Egypt.  Egyptian sentries now guarded the strongholds of the country; Egyptian  ships took the towns along the coast. A great number of the Jews were  transported to Alexandria; they received the rights of citizenship  there.    [Illustration: 049.jpg A THEBAN BELLE]    Without altering local conditions, Syria gradually came under the sway  of the Egyptian satraps. Laomedon found means of escaping from Egypt;  he fled to Alcetas in Caria, who had just withdrawn himself to the  mountainous regions of Pisida, thence to begin the decisive war against  Antigonus.    [Illustration: 049b.jpg Prayer to Isis]         Painted by Alexander Cabanel    In the earlier times of Egyptian history, when navigation was less easy,  and when seas separated kingdoms instead of joining them, the Thebaid  enjoyed, under the Koptic kings, the trading wealth which followed the  stream of its great river, the longest piece of inland navigation  then known; but, with the improvement in navigation and ship-building,  countries began to feel their strength in the timber of their forests  and the number of their harbours; and, as timber and sea-coast were  equally unknown in the Thebaid, that country fell as Lower Egypt rose;  the wealth which before centred in Thebes was then found in the ports  of the Delta, where the barges of the Nile met the ships of the  Mediterranean. What used to be Egypt was an inland kingdom, surrounded by  the desert; but Egypt under Ptolemy was country on the sea-coast; and,  on the conquest of Phoenicia and Coele-Syria, he was master of the  forests of Lebanon and Antilibanus, and stretched his coast from Cyrene  to Antioch, a distance of twelve hundred miles. The wise and mild plans  which were laid down by Alexander for the government of Egypt when a  province were easily followed by Ptolemy when it became his own kingdom.  The Greek soldiers lived in their garrisons or in Alexandria under the  Macedonian laws, while the Egyptian laws were administered by their own  priests, who were upheld in all the rights of their order and in their  freedom from land-tax. The temples of Phtah, of Amon-Ra, and the other  gods of the country were not only kept open, but were repaired and even  built at the cost of the king; the religion of the people, and not that  of their rulers, was made the established religion of the state. On  the death of the god Apis, the sacred bull of Memphis, the chief of the  animals which were kept and fed at the cost of the several cities, and  who had died of old age soon after Ptolemy came to Egypt, he spent the  sum of fifty talents, or $42,500, on its funeral; and the priests, who  had not forgotten that Cambyses, their former conqueror, had wounded the  Apis of his day with his own sword, must have been highly pleased with  this mark of his care for them. The burial-place for the bulls is an  arched gallery tunnelled into the hill behind Memphis for more than two  thousand feet, with a row of cells on each side of it. In every cell is  a huge granite sarcophagus, within which were placed the remains of a  bull that had once been the Apis of its day, which, after having for  perhaps twenty years received the honours of a god, was there buried  with more than kingly state. The cell was then walled up, and ornamented  on the outside with various tablets in honour of the deceased  animal, which were placed in these dark passages by the piety of his  worshippers. The priests of Thebes were now at liberty to cut out from  their monuments the names of usurping gods, and to restore those that  had been before cut out. They also rebuilt the inner room, or the holy  of holies, in the great temple of Karnak.    It had been overthrown by the Persians in wantonness, or in hatred  of the Egyptian religion; and the priests now put upon it the name of  Philip Arridaeus, for whom Ptolemy was nominally governing Egypt.    [Illustration: 052.jpg TOMBS OF THE SACRED BULLS]    The Egyptians, who during the last two centuries had sometimes seen  their temples plundered and their trade crushed by the grasping tyranny  of the Persian satraps, and had at other times been almost as much hurt  by their own vain struggles for freedom, now found themselves in the  quiet enjoyment of good laws, with a prosperity which promised soon to  equal that of the reigns of Necho or Amasis. It is true that they had  not regained their independence and political liberty; that, as compared  with the Greeks, they felt themselves an inferior race, and that they  only enjoyed their civil rights during the pleasure of a Greek autocrat;  but then it is to be remembered that the native rulers with whom Ptolemy  was compared were the kings of Lower Egypt, who, like himself, were  surrounded by Greek mercenaries, and who never rested their power on the  broad base of national pride and love of country; and that nobody  could have hoped to see a Theban king arise to bring back the days  of Thutmosis and Ramses. Thebes was every day sinking in wealth and  strength; and its race of hereditary soldiers, proud in the recollection  of former glory, who had, after centuries of struggles, been forced  to receive laws from Memphis, perhaps yielded obedience to a Greek  conqueror with less pain than they did formerly to their own vassals of  Lower Egypt.    Ptolemy's government was in form nearly the same in Alexandria as in the  rest of Egypt, but in reality it was wholly different. His sway over the  Egyptians was supported by Greek force, but over the Greeks it rested  on the broad base of public opinion. Every Greek had the privilege of  bearing arms, and of meeting in the gymnasium in public assembly, to  explain a grievance, and petition for its redress. The citizens and  the soldiers were the same body of men; they at the same time held the  force, and had the spirit to use it. But they had no senate, no body  of nobles, no political constitution which might save their freedom in  after generations from the ambitious grasp of the sovereign, or from  their own degeneracy. While claiming to be equal among themselves they  were making themselves slaves; and though at present the government so  entirely bore the stamp of their own will that they might fancy they  enjoyed a democracy, yet history teaches us that the simple paternal  form of government never fails to become sooner or later a cruel  tyranny. The building of Alexandria must be held the master-stroke of  policy by which Egypt was kept in obedience. Here, and afterwards in  a few other cities, such as Ptolemais in the Thebaid and Parembole in  Nubia, the Greeks lived without insulting or troubling the Egyptians,  and by their numbers held the country like so many troops in garrison.  It was a wise policy to make no greater change than necessary in  the kingdom, and to leave the Egyptians under their own laws and  magistrates, and in the enjoyment of their own religion; and yet it was  necessary to have the"]]]
