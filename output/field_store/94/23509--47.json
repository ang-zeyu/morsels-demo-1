Some were only accidental or occasional, occasioned by special  necessity of times and seasons, or some present appearance of scandal,  or some such accidental emergency. Thus primitive Christians had all  things common, Acts iv. 32, but that is no ground for anabaptistical  community. Paul wrought at his trade of tent-making, made his hands  _minister to his necessities_, Acts xx. 34; would not take wages for  preaching to the church of Corinth, 2 Cor. xi. 7-9; but this lays no  necessity on ministers to preach the gospel _gratis_, and maintain  themselves by their own manual labors, except when cases and seasons are  alike, Gal. vi. 6-8; 1 Cor. ix. 6-13; 1 Tim. v. 17, 18.    5. Some were of a moral nature, and upon moral grounds, wherein they  followed Christ, and we are to follow them, 1 Cor. xi. 1; Phil. iv. 8,  9, and other places forementioned; for, whatsoever actions were done  then, upon such grounds as are of a moral, perpetual, and common  concernment to one person as well as another, to one church as well as  another, in one age as well as another, those actions are obligatory on  all, and a rule to after generations. Thus the baptizing of women in the  primitive churches, Acts viii. 12, and xvi. 15, though only the males  were circumcised under the Old Testament, is a rule for our baptizing of  women as well as men, they being _all one in Christ,_ Gal. iii. 28. So  the admitting of infants to the first initiating sacrament of the Old  Testament, circumcision, because they with their parents' were accounted  within the covenant of grace by God, Gen. xvii., is a rule for us now to  admit infants to the first initiating sacrament of the New Testament,  baptism, because infants are federally holy, and within the covenant  with their believing parents now, as well as then, Rom. xi. 16; 1 Cor.  vii. 14; Col. ii. 11, 12. Thus the baptizing of divers persons formerly,  though into no particular congregation, nor as members of any  particular congregation, as the eunuch, Acts viii.; Lydia, Acts xvi.;  the jailer, Acts xvi.; because it was sufficient they were baptized into  that one general visible body of Christ, 1 Cor. xii. 12, 13, is a rule  for us what to do in like cases upon the same common ground. Thus the  Church's practice of preaching the word, and breaking bread on the first  day of the week, Acts xx. 7, &c., is our rule for sanctifying the Lord's  day, by celebrating the word, sacraments, and other holy ordinances, at  these times. And in like manner, the primitive practices of ordaining  preaching presbyters, by laying on of hands, 1 Tim. iv. 14; 2 Tim. i. 6;  Acts xiii. 3; of governing all the congregations of a city by one common  presbytery, in which respect they are all called by the name of one  church, as the church of Jerusalem, Acts viii. 1, and xv. 4; the church  of Antioch, Acts xiii. 1, and xi. 25, 26; the church of Corinth, 1 Cor.  i. 2, 2 Cor. i. 1; which had churches in it, 1 Cor. xiv. 34. Of healing  common scandals and errors, troubling divers presbyterial churches by  the authoritative decrees of a synod, made up of members from divers  presbyterial churches, as Acts xv., and such like, are our rules in like  particulars, which the Lord hath left for our direction, the same  grounds of such actions reaching us as well as them.    Now this last kind of examples are those which we are, by divers divine  commands, especially enjoined to follow; and therefore such examples  amount to a divine right or institution; and what we ought to do by  virtue of such binding examples is of divine right, and by the will and  appointment of Jesus Christ.    What discriminatory notes or rules may we walk by, for finding out the  obligatory force of scripture examples; and what manner of examples  those be? For discovery hereof, take these ensuing general rules:    1. Those examples in Scripture, which the Spirit of Christ commands us  to imitate, are undoubtedly obligatory. Such are the moral examples of  God, Christ, apostles, prophets, saints, and churches, recorded in  Scripture, with command to follow them, Eph. iv. 32, and v. 1, 2; 1 John  ii. 6; 1 Cor. xi. 1; Phil. iv. 6; Heb. vi. 12, and xiii. 7; James v. 10;  3 John 11.    2. Those examples in Scripture, which the Spirit of Christ commends and  praises, are obligatory; his commendings are virtual commandings; and we  ought to follow whatsoever is praiseworthy, especially in God's account,  Phil. iv. 8, 9; 2 Cor. x. 18. Now the Spirit of Christ commends many  examples to us: as, _Enoch's walking with God_, Gen. v. 24; _Noah's  uprightness,_ Gen. vi.; _Abraham's faith_, Rom. iv., _and obedience_,  Gen. xxii.; _Lot's zeal against Sodom's sins_, 2 Pet. ii. 9; _Job's  patience_, James v. 10, 11. And in a word, all the examples of the  saints, which the Lord approves and speaks well of; as Heb. xi.; 1 Pet.  iii. 5, 6: together with all such examples, whose imitation by others is  commended in Scripture; as, 1 Thess. i. 6, 7, and ii. 14.    3. Those examples in Scripture are obligatory, whose ground, reason,  scope, or end, are obligatory, and of a moral nature, and as much  concern one Christian as another, one church as another, one time as  another, &c., whether they be the examples under the Old or New  Testament. Thus the example of the church of Corinth, in excommunicating  the incestuous person, because he was a wicked person--and lest he  should _leaven the whole lump;_ and that they might keep the  evangelical passover sincerely, and for that they had power _to judge  them within_; and that his \"flesh might be destroyed, and his spirit  saved in the day of the Lord Jesus,\" 1 Cor. v. 5-8, 11-13: which grounds  and ends being moral, oblige us to use the like remedy against all  wicked and scandalous persons.    4. Those acts which are propounded in Scripture as patterns or examples,  that we should act the like good, or avoid the like ill, are an  obligatory law to us. There is an example of caution, and an example of  imitation.    Thus in reference to well-doing, or suffering for well-doing, the  examples of Christ, his apostles, and other saints, are propounded as  patterns to write after, as John xiii. 14, 15; Heb. xi. tot. with Heb.  xii. 1, _with such a cloud of witnesses_. This verse is as the epilogue  of the former chapter, (saith the learned Calvin,) showing to what end  the catalogue of saints was reckoned up, who under the law excelled in  faith, viz: that every one may fit himself to imitate them. Another  adds,[12] He calls them a cloud, whereby we may be directed; in allusion  to that cloud that went before Israel in the wilderness, to conduct them  to the land of Canaan. See also 1 Pet. ii. 21-23; James v. 10.    Thus also, in reference to ill-doing, that it may be avoided by us, the  bad examples of saints and others are laid before us as warnings and  cautions to us, binding us to eschew like evils, 1 Cor. x. 5, 6, 11.  \"Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust  after evil things, as they also lusted. Now all these things happened  unto them for examples,\" &c., Jude 7.    5. Those acts of saints or Christians, which were done by them as saints  and Christians, are obligatory upon, and to be followed by all  Christians; but those acts which are done by magistrates, prophets,  apostles, ministers, &c., only as such, are only obligatory on such as  have like offices, not on all; according to the maxim, that which agrees  to any thing as such, agrees to every thing that is such. Thus James  urges the example of Elias in praying, James v. 17. Paul presses the  example of Abraham in being justified by believing, Rom. iv. 23,24.  Peter prescribes, as a pattern to wives, the example of Sarah, and other  holy women of old, for \"adorning themselves with a meek and quiet  spirit,--being in subjection to their own husbands,\" 1 Pet. iii. 4-6.    6. Those acts that were commonly and ordinarily done, are ordinarily to  be imitated; as, baptizing _in water only_, and not in any other  element, was the ordinary practice of the New Testament, Matt. iii. 11,  16; Mark i. 6, 10; Luke iii. 16; John i. 26, 31, 33; Acts i. 5, and  viii. 36, 38, and x. 47, and xi. 16; and by that practice we are obliged  to baptize in water only. Joining of many Christians together in  receiving the Lord's supper was an ordinary practice, Matt. xxvi. 20,  26, 27; Acts ii. 42, and xx. 7, &c.; 1 Cor. xi. 20, and by us ordinarily  to be imitated; how else is it a communion? 1 Cor. x. 16, 17.    But such acts as were done only upon special causes or singular reasons,  are only to be imitated in like cases. Thus Christ argues from a like  special cause, that he was not to do miracles at Nazareth without a  call, as he did in other places where he had a call of God; from the  particular example of Elijah and Elisha, who only went to them to whom  God called them, Luke ix. 25-27; so he proves that in like case of  necessity it was lawful for his disciples on the sabbath-day to rub ears  of corn and eat them, &c., from David's example of eating show-bread when  he had need, Matt. xii. 1-5.    7. Those acts that were done from extraordinary calling and gifts, are  to be imitated (in regard of their special way of acting) only by those  that have such extraordinary calling and gifts. Christ therefore blames  his apostles for desiring to imitate Elijah's extraordinary act in  calling for fire from heaven, &c., when they had not his spirit, Luke ix.  54, 55. Papists are blameworthy for imitating the extraordinary forty  days' and nights' fast of Moses, Elijah, and Christ, in their Lent fast.  Prelates argue corruptly for bishops' "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13944"],[0,"After London; Or, Wild England (#8)"],[1," city, and with the route to the next, but beyond that  they were ignorant, and had no desire to learn. Yet the Lake cannot  really be so long and broad as it seems, for the country could not  contain it. The length is increased, almost trebled, by the islands and  shoals, which will not permit of navigation in a straight line. For the  most part, too, they follow the southern shore of the mainland, which is  protected by a fringe of islets and banks from the storms which sweep  over the open waters.    Thus rowing along round the gulfs and promontories, their voyage is  thrice prolonged, but rendered nearly safe from the waves, which rise  with incredible celerity before the gales. The slow ships of commerce,  indeed, are often days in traversing the distance between one port and  another, for they wait for the wind to blow abaft, and being heavy,  deeply laden, built broad and flat-bottomed for shallows, and bluff at  the bows, they drift like logs of timber. In canoes the hunters, indeed,  sometimes pass swiftly from one place to another, venturing farther out  to sea than the ships. They could pass yet more quickly were it not for  the inquisition of the authorities at every city and port, who not only  levy dues and fees for the treasury of the prince, and for their own  rapacious desires, but demand whence the vessel comes, to whom she  belongs, and whither she is bound, so that no ship can travel rapidly  unless so armed as to shake off these inquisitors.    The canoes, therefore, travel at night and in calm weather many miles  away from the shore, and thus escape, or slip by daylight among the  reedy shallows, sheltered by the flags and willows from view. The ships  of commerce haul up to the shore towards evening, and the crews,  disembarking, light their fires and cook their food. There are, however,  one or two gaps, as it were, in their usual course which they cannot  pass in this leisurely manner; where the shore is exposed and rocky, or  too shallow, and where they must reluctantly put forth, and sail from  one horn of the land to the other.    The Lake is also divided into two unequal portions by the straits of  White Horse, where vessels are often weather-bound, and cannot make way  against the wind, which sets a current through the narrow channel. There  is no tide; the sweet waters do not ebb and flow; but while I thus  discourse, I have forgotten to state how they came to fill the middle of  the country. Now, the philosopher Silvester, and those who seek after  marvels, say that the passage of the dark body through space caused an  immense volume of fresh water to fall in the shape of rain, and also  that the growth of the forests distilled rain from the clouds. Let us  leave these speculations to dreamers, and recount what is known to be.    For there is no tradition among the common people, who are extremely  tenacious of such things, of any great rainfall, nor is there any  mention of floods in the ancient manuscripts, nor is there any larger  fall of rain now than was formerly the case. But the Lake itself tells  us how it was formed, or as nearly as we shall ever know, and these  facts were established by the expeditions lately sent out.    At the eastern extremity the Lake narrows, and finally is lost in the  vast marshes which cover the site of the ancient London. Through these,  no doubt, in the days of the old world there flowed the river Thames. By  changes of the sea level and the sand that was brought up there must  have grown great banks, which obstructed the stream. I have formerly  mentioned the vast quantities of timber, the wreckage of towns and  bridges which was carried down by the various rivers, and by none more  so than by the Thames. These added to the accumulation, which increased  the faster because the foundations of the ancient bridges held it like  piles driven in for the purpose. And before this the river had become  partially choked from the cloacae of the ancient city which poured into  it through enormous subterranean aqueducts and drains.    After a time all these shallows and banks became well matted together by  the growth of weeds, of willows, and flags, while the tide, ebbing lower  at each drawing back, left still more mud and sand. Now it is believed  that when this had gone on for a time, the waters of the river, unable  to find a channel, began to overflow up into the deserted streets, and  especially to fill the underground passages and drains, of which the  number and extent was beyond all the power of words to describe. These,  by the force of the water, were burst up, and the houses fell in.    For this marvellous city, of which such legends are related, was after  all only of brick, and when the ivy grew over and trees and shrubs  sprang up, and, lastly, the waters underneath burst in, this huge  metropolis was soon overthrown. At this day all those parts which were  built upon low ground are marshes and swamps. Those houses that were  upon high ground were, of course, like the other towns, ransacked of all  they contained by the remnant that was left; the iron, too, was  extracted. Trees growing up by them in time cracked the walls, and they  fell in. Trees and bushes covered them; ivy and nettles concealed the  crumbling masses of brick.    The same was the case with the lesser cities and towns whose sites are  known in the woods. For though many of our present towns bear the  ancient names, they do not stand upon the ancient sites, but are two or  three, and sometimes ten miles distant. The founders carried with them  the name of their original residence.    Thus the low-lying parts of the mighty city of London became swamps, and  the higher grounds were clad with bushes. The very largest of the  buildings fell in, and there was nothing visible but trees and hawthorns  on the upper lands, and willows, flags, reeds, and rushes on the lower.  These crumbling ruins still more choked the stream, and almost, if not  quite, turned it back. If any water ooze past, it is not perceptible,  and there is no channel through to the salt ocean. It is a vast stagnant  swamp, which no man dare enter, since death would be his inevitable  fate.    There exhales from this oozy mass so fatal a vapour that no animal can  endure it. The black water bears a greenish-brown floating scum, which  for ever bubbles up from the putrid mud of the bottom. When the wind  collects the miasma, and, as it were, presses it together, it becomes  visible as a low cloud which hangs over the place. The cloud does not  advance beyond the limit of the marsh, seeming to stay there by some  constant attraction; and well it is for us that it does not, since at  such times when the vapour is thickest, the very wildfowl leave the  reeds, and fly from the poison. There are no fishes, neither can eels  exist in the mud, nor even newts. It is dead.    The flags and reeds are coated with slime and noisome to the touch;  there is one place where even these do not grow, and where there is  nothing but an oily liquid, green and rank. It is plain there are no  fishes in the water, for herons do not go thither, nor the kingfishers,  not one of which approaches the spot. They say the sun is sometimes  hidden by the vapour when it is thickest, but I do not see how any can  tell this, since they could not enter the cloud, as to breathe it when  collected by the wind is immediately fatal. For all the rottenness of a  thousand years and of many hundred millions of human beings is there  festering under the stagnant water, which has sunk down into and  penetrated the earth, and floated up to the surface the contents of the  buried cloacae.    Many scores of men have, I fear, perished in the attempt to enter this  fearful place, carried on by their desire of gain. For it can scarcely  be disputed that untold treasures lie hidden therein, but guarded by  terrors greater than fiery serpents. These have usually made their  endeavours to enter in severe and continued frost, or in the height of a  drought. Frost diminishes the power of the vapour, and the marshes can  then, too, be partially traversed, for there is no channel for a boat.  But the moment anything be moved, whether it be a bush, or a willow,  even a flag, if the ice be broken, the pestilence rises yet stronger.  Besides which, there are portions which never freeze, and which may be  approached unawares, or a turn of the wind may drift the gas towards the  explorer.    In the midst of summer, after long heat, the vapour rises, and is in a  degree dissipated into the sky, and then by following devious ways an  entrance may be effected, but always at the cost of illness. If the  explorer be unable to quit the spot before night, whether in summer or  winter, his death is certain. In the earlier times some bold and  adventurous men did indeed succeed in getting a few jewels, but since  then the marsh has become more dangerous, and its pestilent character,  indeed, increases year by year, as the stagnant water penetrates deeper.  So that now for very many years no such attempts have been made.    The extent of these foul swamps is not known with certainty, but it is  generally believed that they are, at the widest, twenty miles across,  and that they reach in a winding line for nearly forty. But the outside  parts are much less fatal; it is only the interior which is avoided.    Towards the Lake the sand thrown up by the waves has long since formed a  partial barrier between the sweet water and the stagnant, rising up to  within a few feet of the surface. This barrier is overgrown with flags  and reeds, where it is shallow. Here it is possible to sail along the  sweet water within an arrow-shot of the swamp. Nor, indeed, would the  stagnant mingle with the sweet, as is evident at other parts of the  swamp, where streams flow side by side with the dark or reddish water;  and there are pools, upon one side of which the deer drink, while the  other is"]]]
