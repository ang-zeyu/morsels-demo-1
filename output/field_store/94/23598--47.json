As I have explained before, the Precession of the  Equinoxes caused the Sun, at its moment of triumph over the powers of  darkness, to stand at one period in the constellation of the Bull, and  at a period some two thousand years later in the constellation of the  Ram. It was perfectly natural therefore that a change in the sacred  symbols should, in the course of time, take place; yet perfectly natural  also that these symbols, having once been consecrated and adopted,  should continue to be honored and clung to long after the time of their  astronomical appropriateness had passed, and so to be found side by side  in later centuries. The devotee of Mithra or Attis on the Vatican  Hill at Rome in the year 200 A.D. probably had as little notion or  comprehension of the real origin of the sacred Bull or Ram which he  adored, as the Christian in St. Peter's to-day has of the origin of the  Lamb-god whose vicegerent on earth is the Pope.    It is indeed easy to imagine that the change from the worship of the  Bull to the worship of the Lamb which undoubtedly took place among  various peoples as time went on, was only a ritual change initiated  by the priests in order to put on record and harmonize with the  astronomical alteration. Anyhow it is curious that while Mithra in the  early times was specially associated with the bull, his association with  the lamb belonged more to the Roman period. Somewhat the same happened  in the case of Attis. In the Bible we read of the indignation of  Moses at the setting up by the Israelites of a Golden Calf, AFTER  the sacrifice of the ram-lamb had been instituted--as if indeed the  rebellious people were returning to the earlier cult of Apis which they  ought to have left behind them in Egypt. In Egypt itself, too, we find  the worship of Apis, as time went on, yielding place to that of the  Ram-headed god Amun, or Jupiter Ammon. (1) So that both from the Bible  and from Egyptian history we may conclude that the worship of the Lamb  or Ram succeeded to the worship of the Bull.     (1) Tacitus (Hist. v. 4) speaks of ram-sacrifice by the Jews in  honor of Jupiter Ammon. See also Herodotus (ii. 42) on the same in  Egypt.      Finally it has been pointed out, and there may be some real connection  in the coincidence, that in the quite early years of Christianity the  FISH came in as an accepted symbol of Jesus Christ. Considering that  after the domination of Taurus and Aries, the Fish (Pisces) comes next  in succession as the Zodiacal sign for the Vernal Equinox, and is now  the constellation in which the Sun stands at that period, it seems  not impossible that the astronomical change has been the cause of the  adoption of this new symbol.    Anyhow, and allowing for possible errors or exaggerations, it becomes  clear that the travels of the Sun through the belt of constellations  which forms the Zodiac must have had, from earliest times, a profound  influence on the generation of religious myths and legends. To say that  it was the only influence would certainly be a mistake. Other causes  undoubtedly contributed. But it was a main and important influence. The  origins of the Zodiac are obscure; we do not know with any certainty the  reasons why the various names were given to its component sections, nor  can we measure the exact antiquity of these names; but--pre-supposing  the names of the signs as once given--it is not difficult to imagine the  growth of legends connected with the Sun's course among them.    Of all the ancient divinities perhaps Hercules is the one whose role  as a Sungod is most generally admitted. The helper of gods and men, a  mighty Traveller, and invoked everywhere as the Saviour, his labors  for the good of the world became ultimately defined and systematized  as twelve and corresponding in number to the signs of the Zodiac. It  is true that this systematization only took place at a late period,  probably in Alexandria; also that the identification of some of the  Labors with the actual signs as we have them at present is not always  clear. But considering the wide prevalence of the Hercules myth over  the ancient world and the very various astronomical systems it must have  been connected with in its origin, this lack of exact correspondence is  hardly to be wondered at.    The Labors of Hercules which chiefly interest us are: (1) The capture  of the Bull, (2) the slaughter of the Lion, (3) the destruction of the  Hydra, (4) of the Boar, (5) the cleansing of the stables of Augeas, (6)  the descent into Hades and the taming of Cerberus. The first of these  is in line with the Mithraic conquest of the Bull; the Lion is of course  one of the most prominent constellations of the Zodiac, and its conquest  is obviously the work of a Saviour of mankind; while the last four  labors connect themselves very naturally with the Solar conflict in  winter against the powers of darkness. The Boar (4) we have seen already  as the image of Typhon, the prince of darkness; the Hydra (3) was said  to be the offspring of Typhon; the descent into Hades (6)--generally  associated with Hercules' struggle with and victory over Death--links on  to the descent of the Sun into the underworld, and its long and doubtful  strife with the forces of winter; and the cleansing of the stables  of Augeas (5) has the same signification. It appears in fact that the  stables of Augeas was another name for the sign of Capricorn through  which the Sun passes at the Winter solstice (1)--the stable of course  being an underground chamber--and the myth was that there, in this  lowest tract and backwater of the Ecliptic all the malarious and evil  influences of the sky were collected, and the Sungod came to wash them  away (December was the height of the rainy season in Judaea) and cleanse  the year towards its rebirth.     (1) See diagram of Zodiac.      It should not be forgotten too that even as a child in the cradle  Hercules slew two serpents sent for his destruction--the serpent and the  scorpion as autumnal constellations figuring always as enemies of the  Sungod--to which may be compared the power given to his disciples by  Jesus (1) \"to tread on serpents and scorpions.\" Hercules also as a  Sungod compares curiously with Samson (mentioned above, ii), but we  need not dwell on all the elaborate analogies that have been traced (2)  between these two heroes.     (1) Luke x. 19.     (2) See Doane's Bible Myths, ch. viii, (New York, 1882.)      The Jesus-story, it will now be seen, has a great number of  correspondences with the stories of former Sungods and with the actual  career of the Sun through the heavens--so many indeed that they cannot  well be attributed to mere coincidence or even to the blasphemous wiles  of the Devil! Let us enumerate some of these. There are (1) the birth  from a Virgin mother; (2) the birth in a stable (cave or underground  chamber); and (3) on the 25th December (just after the winter solstice).  There is (4) the Star in the East (Sirius) and (5) the arrival of the  Magi (the \"Three Kings\"); there is (6) the threatened Massacre of the  Innocents, and the consequent flight into a distant country (told also  of Krishna and other Sungods). There are the Church festivals of (7)  Candlemas (2nd February), with processions of candles to symbolize the  growing light; of (8) Lent, or the arrival of Spring; of (9) Easter Day  (normally on the 25th March) to celebrate the crossing of the Equator  by the Sun; and (10) simultaneously the outburst of lights at the Holy  Sepulchre at Jerusalem. There is (11) the Crucifixion and death of the  Lamb-God, on Good Friday, three days before Easter; there are (12) the  nailing to a tree, (13) the empty grave, (14) the glad Resurrection (as  in the cases of Osiris, Attis and others); there are (15) the twelve  disciples (the Zodiacal signs); and (16) the betrayal by one of the  twelve. Then later there is (17) Midsummer Day, the 24th June, dedicated  to the Nativity of John the Baptist, and corresponding to Christmas  Day; there are the festivals of (18) the Assumption of the Virgin  (15th August) and of (19) the Nativity of the Virgin (8th September),  corresponding to the movement of the god through Virgo; there is the  conflict of Christ and his disciples with the autumnal asterisms, (20)  the Serpent and the Scorpion; and finally there is the curious fact that  the Church (21) dedicates the very day of the winter solstice (when any  one may very naturally doubt the rebirth of the Sun) to St. Thomas, who  doubted the truth of the Resurrection!    These are some of, and by no means all, the coincidences in question.  But they are sufficient, I think, to prove--even allowing for possible  margins of error--the truth of our general contention. To go into the  parallelism of the careers of Krishna, the Indian Sungod, and  Jesus would take too long; because indeed the correspondence is so  extraordinarily close and elaborate. (1) I propose, however, at the  close of this chapter, to dwell now for a moment on the Christian  festival of the Eucharist, partly on account of its connection with the  derivation from the astronomical rites and Nature-celebrations already  alluded to, and partly on account of the light which the festival  generally, whether Christian or Pagan, throws on the origins of  Religious Magic--a subject I shall have to deal with in the next  chapter.     (1) See Robertson's Christianity and Mythology, Part II, pp.  129-302; also Doane's Bible Myths, ch. xxviii, p. 278.      I have already (Ch. II) mentioned the Eucharistic rite held in  commemoration of Mithra, and the indignant ascription of this by Justin  Martyr to the wiles of the Devil. Justin Martyr clearly had no doubt  about the resemblance of the Mithraic to the Christian ceremony. A  Sacramental meal, as mentioned a few pages back, seems to have been held  by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15620"],[0,"Recreations in Astronomy (#8)"],[1,"refracting  telescope. Difficulties innumerable arise as we attempt to enlarge  the instruments. These have been overcome, one after another, until  it is now felt that the best modern telescope, with an object lens  of twenty-six inches, has fully reached the limit of optical power.    _The Reflecting Telescope_.    This is the only kind of instrument differing radically from the  refracting one already described. It receives the light in a concave  mirror, M (Fig. 14), which reflects it to the focus F, producing the  same result as the lens of the refracting telescope. Here a mirror  may be placed obliquely, reflecting the image at right angles to the  eye, outside the tube, in which case it is called the Newtonian  telescope; or a mirror at R may be placed perpendicularly, and send  the rays through [Page 45] an opening in the mirror at M. This form  is called the Gregorian telescope. Or the mirror M may be slightly  inclined to the coming rays, so as to bring the point F entirely  outside the tube, in which case it is called the Herschelian  telescope. In either case the image may be magnified, as in the  refracting telescope.    [Illustration: Fig. 14.--Reflecting Telescope.]    Reflecting telescopes are made of all sizes, up to the Cyclopean  eye of the one constructed by Lord Rosse, which is six feet in  diameter. The form of instrument to be preferred depends on the  use to which it is to be put. The loss of light in passing through  glass lenses is about two-tenths. The loss by reflection is often  one-half. In view of this peculiarity and many others, it is held  that a twenty-six-inch refractor is fully equal to any six-foot  reflector.    The mounting of large telescopes demands the highest engineering  ability. The whole instrument, with its vast weight of a twenty-six-inch  glass lens, with its accompanying tube and appurtenances, must be  pointed as nicely as a rifle, and held as steadily as the axis  of the globe. To give it the required steadiness, the foundation  on which it is placed is sunk deep in the earth, far from rail or  other roads, and no part of the observatory is allowed to touch  this support. When a star is once found, the earth swiftly rotates  the telescope away from it, and it passes out of the field. To  avoid this, clock-work is so arranged that the great telescope  follows the star by the hour, if required. It will take a star at  its eastern rising, and hold it constantly in view while it climbs  to the meridian and sinks in the west (Fig. 15). The reflector  demands still more difficult engineering. That of Lord Rosse has  a metallic mirror [Page 46] weighing six tons, a tube forty feet  long, which, with its appurtenances, weighs seven tons more. It  moves between two walls only 10 deg. east and west. The new Paris  reflector (Fig. 16) has a much wider range of movement.    [Illustration: Fig. 15.--Cambridge Equatorial.]    [Illustration: Fig. 16.--New Paris Reflector.]    _The Spectroscope._    A spectrum is a collection of the colors which are dispersed by  a prism from any given light. If it is sunlight, it is a solar  spectrum; if the source of light is a [Page 49] star, candle,  glowing metal, or gas, it is the spectrum of a star, candle, glowing  metal, or gas. An instrument to see these spectra is called a  spectroscope. Considering the infinite variety of light, and its  easy modification and absorption, we should expect an immense number  of spectra. A mere prism disperses the light so imperfectly that  different orders of vibrations, perceived as colors, are mingled. No  eye can tell where one commences or ends. Such a spectrum is said to  be impure. What we want is that each point in the spectrum should be  made of rays of the same number of vibrations. As we can let only a  small beam of light pass through the prism, in studying celestial  objects with a telescope and spectroscope we must, in every  instance, contract the aperture of the instrument until we get only  a small beam of light. In order to have the colors thoroughly  dispersed, the best instruments pass the beam of light through a  series of prisms called a battery, each one spreading farther the  colors which the previous ones had spread. In Fig. 17 the ray is  seen entering through the telescope A, which renders the rays  parallel, and passing [Page 50] through the prisms out to telescope  B, where the spectrum can be examined on the retina of the eye for a  screen. In order to still farther disperse the rays, some batteries  receive the ray from the last prism at O upon an oblique mirror,  send it up a little to another, which delivers it again to the prism  to make its journey back again through them all, and come out to be  examined just above where it entered the first prism.    [Illustration: Fig. 17.--Spectroscope, with Battery of Prisms.]    Attached to the examining telescope is a diamond-ruled scale of glass,  enabling us to fix the position of any line with great exactness.    [Illustration: Fig. 18.--Spectra of glowing Hydrogen and the Sun.]    In Fig. 18 is seen, in the lower part, a spectrum of the sun, with  about a score of its thousands of lines made evident. In the upper  part is seen the spectrum of bright lines given by glowing hydrogen  gas. These lines are given by no other known gas; they are its  autograph. It is readily observed that they precisely correspond  with certain dark lines in the solar spectrum. Hence we easily  know that a glowing gas gives the same bright lines that it absorbs  from the light of another source passing through it--that is, glowing  gas gives out the same rays of light that it absorbs when it is  not glowing.    The subject becomes clearer by a study of the chromolithic plate.  No. 1 represents the solar spectrum, with a few of its lines on an  accurately graduated scale. [Page 51] No.3 shows the bright line of  glowing sodium, and, corresponding to a dark line in the solar  spectrum, shows the presence of salt in that body. No. 2 shows that  potassium has some violet rays, but not all; and there being no dark  line to correspond in the solar spectrum, we infer its absence from  the sun. No.6 shows the numerous lines and bands of barium--several  red, orange, yellow, and four are very bright green ones. The lines  given by any volatilized substances are always in the same place on  the scale.    A patient study of these signs of substances reveals, richer results  than a study of the cuniform characters engraved on Assyrian slabs;  for one is the handwriting of men, the other the handwriting of  God.    One of the most difficult and delicate problems solved by the  spectroscope is the approach or departure of a light-giving body  in the line of sight. Stand before a locomotive a mile away, you  cannot tell whether it approaches or recedes, yet it will dash by  in a minute. How can the movements of the stars be comprehended  when they are at such an immeasurable distance?    It can best be illustrated by music. The note C of the G clef is  made by two hundred and fifty-seven vibrations of air per second.  Twice as many vibrations per second would give us the note C an octave  above. Sound travels at the rate of three hundred and sixty-four  yards per second. If the source of these two hundred and fifty-seven  vibrations could approach us at three hundred and sixty-four yards  per second, it is obvious that twice as many waves would be put  into a given space, and we should hear the upper C when only waves  enough were made for the lower C. The same [Page 52] result would  appear if we carried our ear toward the sound fast enough to take up  twice as many valves as though we stood still. This is apparent to  every observer in a railway train. The whistle of an approaching  locomotive gives one tone; it passes, and we instantly detect  another. Let two trains, running at a speed of thirty-six yards a  second, approach each other. Let the whistle of one sound the note  E, three hundred and twenty-three vibrations per second. It will be  heard on the other as the note G, three hundred and eighty-eight  vibrations per second; for the speed of each train crowds the  vibrations into one-tenth less room, adding 32+ vibrations per  second, making three hundred and eighty-eight in all. The trains  pass. The vibrations are put into one-tenth more space by the  whistle making them, and the other train allows only nine-tenths of  what there are to overtake the ear. Each subtracts 32+ vibrations  from three hundred and twenty-three, leaving only two hundred and  fifty-eight, which is the note C. Yet the note E was constantly  uttered.    [Illustration: 1. Solar Spectrum. 2. Spectrum of Potassium. 3.  Spectrum of Sodium. 4. Spectrum of Strontium. 5. Spectrum of Calcium.  6. Spectrum of Barium.]    If a source of light approach or depart, it will have a similar  effect on the light waves. How shall we detect it? If a star approach  us, it puts a greater number of waves into an inch, and shortens their  length. If it recedes, it increases the length of the wave--puts  a less number into an inch. If a body giving only the number of  vibrations we call green were to approach sufficiently fast, it  would crowd in vibrations enough to appear what we call blue, indigo,  or even violet, according to its speed. If it receded sufficiently  fast, it would leave behind it only vibrations enough to fill up  [Page 53] the space with what we call yellow, orange, or red,  according to its speed; yet it would be green, and green only, all  the time. But how detect the change? If red waves are shortened they  become orange in color; and from below the red other rays, too far  apart to be seen by the eye, being shortened, become visible as red,  and we cannot know that anything has taken place. So, if a star  recedes fast enough, violet vibrations being lengthened become  indigo; and from above the violet other rays, too short to be seen,  become lengthened into visible"]]]
