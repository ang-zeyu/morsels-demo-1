These motions are accelerated or retarded, as their correspondent  irritations are increased or diminished, without our attention or  consciousness, in the same manner as the various secretions of fruit, gum,  resin, wax, and, honey, are produced in the vegetable world, and as the  juices of the earth and the moisture of the atmosphere are absorbed by  their roots and foliage.    2. Other muscular motions, that are most frequently connected with our  sensations, as those of the sphincters of the bladder and anus, and the  musculi erectores penis, were originally excited into motion by irritation,  for young children make water, and have other evacuations without attention  to these circumstances; \"et primis etiam ab incunabulis tenduntur saepius  puerorum penes, amore nondum expergefacto.\" So the nipples of young women  are liable to become turgid by irritation, long before they are in a  situation to be excited by the pleasure of giving milk to the lips of a  child.    3. The contractions of the larger muscles of our bodies, that are most  frequently connected with volition, were originally excited into action by  internal irritations: as appears from the stretching or yawning of all  animals after long sleep. In the beginning of some fevers this irritation  of the muscles produces perpetual stretching and yawning; in other periods  of fever an universal restlessness arises from the same cause, the patient  changing the attitude of his body every minute. The repeated struggles of  the foetus in the uterus must be owing to this internal irritation: for the  foetus can have no other inducement to move its limbs but the taedium or  irksomeness of a continued posture.    The following case evinces, that the motions of stretching the limbs after  a continued attitude are not always owing to the power of the will. Mr.  Dean, a mason, of Austry in Leicestershire, had the spine of the third  vertebra of the back enlarged; in some weeks his lower extremities became  feeble, and at length quite paralytic: neither the pain of blisters, the  heat of fomentations, nor the utmost efforts of the will could produce the  least motion in these limbs; yet twice or thrice a day for many months his  feet, legs, and thighs, were affected for many minutes with forceable  stretchings, attended with the sensation of fatigue; and he at length  recovered the use of his limbs, though the spine continued protuberant. The  same circumstance is frequently seen in a less degree in the common  hemiplagia; and when this happens, I have believed repeated and strong  shocks of electricity to have been of great advantage.    4. In like manner the various organs of sense are originally excited into  motion by various external stimuli adapted to this purpose, which motions  are termed perceptions or ideas; and many of these motions during our  waking hours are excited by perpetual irritation, as those of the organs of  hearing and of touch. The former by the constant low indistinct noises that  murmur around us, and the latter by the weight of our bodies on the parts  which support them; and by the unceasing variations of the heat, moisture,  and pressure of the atmosphere; and these sensual motions, precisely as the  muscular ones above mentioned, obey their correspondent irritations without  our attention or consciousness.    5. Other classes of our ideas are more frequently excited by our sensations  of pleasure or pain, and others by volition: but that these have all been  originally excited by stimuli from external objects, and only vary in their  combinations or reparations, has been fully evinced by Mr. Locke: and are  by him termed the ideas of perception in contradistinction to those, which  he calls the ideas of reflection.    II. 1. These muscular motions, that are excited by perpetual irritation,  are nevertheless occasionally excitable by the sensations of pleasure or  pain, or by volition; as appears by the palpitation of the heart from fear,  the increased secretion of saliva at the sight of agreeable food, and the  glow on the skin of those who are ashamed. There is an instance told in the  Philosophical Transactions of a man, who could for a time stop the motion  of his heart when he pleased; and Mr. D. has often told me, be could so far  increase the peristaltic motion of his bowels by voluntary efforts, as to  produce an evacuation by stool at any time in half an hour.    2. In like manner the sensual motions, or ideas, that are excited by  perpetual irritation, are nevertheless occasionally excited by sensation or  volition; as in the night, when we listen under the influence of fear, or  from voluntary attention, the motions excited in the organ of hearing by  the whispering of the air in our room, the pulsation of our own arteries,  or the faint beating of a distant watch, become objects of perception.    III. 1. Innumerable trains or tribes of other motions are associated with  these muscular motions which are excited by irritation; as by the stimulus  of the blood in the right chamber of the heart, the lungs are induced to  expand themselves; and the pectoral and intercostal muscles, and the  diaphragm, act at the same time by their associations with them. And when  the pharinx is irritated by agreeable food, the muscles of deglutition are  brought into action by association. Thus when a greater light falls on the  eye, the iris is brought into action without our attention; and the ciliary  process, when the focus is formed before or behind the retina, by their  associations with the increased irritative motions of the organ of vision.  Many common actions of life are produced in a similar manner. If a fly  settle on my forehead, whilst I am intent on my present occupation, I  dislodge it with my finger, without exciting my attention or breaking the  train of my ideas.    2. In like manner the irritative ideas suggest to us many other trains or  tribes of ideas that are associated with them. On this kind of connection,  language, letters, hieroglyphics, and every kind of symbol, depend. The  symbols themselves produce irritative ideas, or sensual motions, which we  do not attend to; and other ideas, that are succeeded by sensation, are  excited by their association with them. And as these irritative ideas make  up a part of the chain of our waking thoughts, introducing other ideas that  engage our attention, though themselves are unattended to, we find it very  difficult to investigate by what steps many of our hourly trains of ideas  gain their admittance.    It may appear paradoxical, that ideas can exist, and not be attended to;  but all our perceptions are ideas excited by irritation, and succeeded by  sensation. Now when these ideas excited by irritation give us neither  pleasure nor pain, we cease to attend to them. Thus whilst I am walking  through that grove before my window, I do not run against the trees or the  benches, though my thoughts are strenuously exerted on some other object.  This leads us to a distinct knowledge of irritative ideas, for the idea of  the tree or bench, which I avoid, exists on my retina, and induces by  association the action of certain locomotive muscles; though neither itself  nor the actions of those muscles engage my attention.    Thus whilst we are conversing on this subject, the tone, note, and  articulation of every individual word forms its correspondent irritative  idea on the organ of hearing; but we only attend to the associated ideas,  that are attached by habit to these irritative ones, and are succeeded by  sensation; thus when we read the words \"PRINTING-PRESS\" we do not attend to  the shape, size, or existence of the letters which compose these words,  though each of them excites a correspondent irritative motion of our organ  of vision, but they introduce by association our idea of the most useful of  modern inventions; the capacious reservoir of human knowledge, whose  branching streams diffuse sciences, arts, and morality, through all nations  and all ages.           *       *       *       *       *    SECT. VIII.    OF SENSITIVE MOTIONS.        I. 1. _Sensitive muscular motions were originally excited into action      by irritation._ 2. _And sensitive sensual motions, ideas of      imagination, dreams._ II. 1. _Sensitive muscular motions are      occasionally obedient to volition._ 2. _And sensitive sensual motions._      III. 1. _Other muscular motions are associated with the sensitive      ones._ 2. _And other sensual motions._    I. 1. Many of the motions of our muscles, that are excited into action by  irritation, are at the same time accompanied with painful or pleasurable  sensations; and at length become by habit causable by the sensations. Thus  the motions of the sphincters of the bladder and anus were originally  excited into action by irritation; for young children give no attention to  these evacuations; but as soon as they become sensible of the inconvenience  of obeying these irritations, they suffer the water or excrement to  accumulate, till it disagreeably affects them; and the action of those  sphincters is then in consequence of this disagreeable sensation. So the  secretion of saliva, which in young children is copiously produced by  irritation, and drops from their mouths, is frequently attended with the  agreeable sensation produced by the mastication of tasteful food;, till at  length the sight of such food to a hungry person excites into action these  salival glands; as is seen in the slavering of hungry dogs.    The motions of those muscles, which are affected by lascivious ideas, and  those which are exerted in smiling, weeping, starting from fear, and  winking at the approach of danger to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15709"],[0,"The Christmas Angel (#8)"],[1,"recalled her own  childhood. The Angel regarded her with beaming eyes. After some time he  said quietly, \"Now let us see what became of your last experiment.\"    Miss Terry started. It seemed as if she had been interrupted in pleasant  dreaming. \"_You_ were the last experiment,\" she said. \"I know what became  of you. Here you are!\"    \"Yet more may have happened than you guessed,\" replied the Angel meaningly.  \"I have tried to show you how often that is the case. Look again.\"    Without moving from her chair Miss Terry seemed to be looking out on her  sidewalk, where, so it seemed, she had just laid the pink figure of the  Angel. She saw the drunken man approach. She heard his coarse laugh; saw  his brutal movement as he kicked the Christmas token into the street. In  sick disgust she saw him reel away out of sight. She saw herself run down  the steps, rescue the image, and bring it into the house. Surely the story  was finished. What more could there be?    But something bade her vision follow the steps of the wretched man. Down  the street he reeled, singing a blasphemous song. With a whoop he rounded a  corner and ran into a happy party which filled sidewalk and street, as it  hurried in the direction from which he came. Good-naturedly they jostled  him against the wall, and he grasped a railing to steady himself as they  swept by. It was the choir on their way to carol in the next street. Before  them went the cross-bearer, lifting high his simple wooden emblem.    [Illustration: HE GRASPED A RAILING TO STEADY HIMSELF]    The eyes of the drunken man caught sight of this, and wavered. The presence  of the crowd conveyed no meaning to his dazed brains. But there was  something in the familiar symbol which held his vision. He looked, and  crossed himself, remembering the traditions of his childhood. Some of  the boys were humming as they went the stirring strains of an ancient  Christmas march known to all nations; a carol which began, some say, as a  rousing drinking chorus.    The familiar strain touched some chord in the sodden brain. The man gave a  feeble whinny, trying to follow the melody. He pulled himself together and  lurched forward in a sudden impulse to join the band of pilgrims. But by  the time he had taken three steps they had vanished, miraculously, as it  seemed to him.    \"Begorra, they're gone!\" he cried. \"Who were they? Were they rale folks?  What was it they was singin'?\"    He sank back helplessly on a flight of steps. \"_Ve-ni-te a-do-re-mus!_\" he  croaked in a quavering basso. And his tangled mind went through strange  processes. Suddenly, there came to him in a flash of exaggerated memory the  figure of the Christmas Angel which not ten minutes earlier he had kicked  into the street. A pious horror fell upon him.    \"Mither o' mercy!\" he cried, again crossing himself. \"What have I been an'  done? It was a howly image; an' what did I do to ut? Lemme go back an' find  ut, an' take ut up out av the street.\"    Greatly sobered by his fear, he staggered down the block and around the  corner to the steps of Miss Terry's house.    \"This is the place,\" he mused. \"I know ut; here's where the frindly  lam'post hild me in its arrums. I rimimber there was a dark house forninst  me. Here's where ut lay on the sidewalk, all pink an' pretty. An' I kicked  ut into the street! Where is ut now? Where gone? Howly Mither! Here's the  spot where ut fell, look now! The shape of uts little body and the wings of  ut in the snow. But 'tis gone intirely!\" He rubbed his eyes and crossed  himself again. \"'Tis flown away,\" he muttered. \"'Tis gone back to Hiven to  tell Mary Mither o' the wicked thing I done this night. Oh, 'tis a miracle  that's happened! An' oh! The wicked man I am, drunk and disorderly on the  Howly Eve!\"        \"O come, all ye faithful,        Joyful and triumphant!\"    Once more he heard the familiar strain taken up lustily by many voices.    \"Hear all the world singin' on the way to Bethlehem!\" he said, and the  stupor seemed to leave his brain. He no longer staggered.    \"I'll run an' join 'em, an' I won't drink another drop this night.\" He  looked up at the starry sky. \"Maybe the Angel hears me. Maybe he'll help  me to keep straight to-morrow. It might be my Guardian Angel himsilf that I  treated so! Saints forgive me!\"    With head bowed humbly, but no longer reeling, he moved away towards the  sound of music.           *       *       *       *       *    \"You were his Guardian Angel,\" said Miss Terry, when once more she saw the  figure on the mantel-shelf. And she spoke with reverent gentleness.    The Angel smiled brightly. \"The Christmas Spirit is a guardian angel to  many,\" he said. \"Never again despise me, Angelina. Never again make light  of my influence.\"    \"Never again,\" murmured Miss Terry half unconsciously. \"I wish it were not  too late--\"    \"It is never too late,\" said the Christmas Angel eagerly, as if he read her  unspoken thought. \"Oh, never too late, Angelina.\"          CHAPTER XIII    THE CHRISTMAS CANDLE      Suddenly there was a sound,--a dull reverberating sound. It seemed to Miss  Terry to come from neither north, south, east, nor west, but from a  different world. Ah! She recognized it now. It was somebody knocking on the  library door.    Miss Terry gave a long sigh and drew herself up in her chair. \"It must be  Norah just come back,\" she said to herself. \"I had forgotten Norah  completely. It must be shockingly late. Come in,\" she called, as she  glanced at the clock.    She rubbed her eyes and looked again. A few minutes after nine! She had  thought it must be midnight!    Norah entered to find her mistress staring at the mantel where the clock  stood. She saw lying beside the clock the pink Angel which had fallen from  the box as she brought it in,--the box now empty by the fire.    \"Law, Miss,\" she said, \"have you burned them all up but him? I'm glad you  saved him, he's so pretty.\"    \"Norah,\" said Miss Terry with an effort, \"is that clock right?\"    \"Yes'm,\" said Norah. \"I set it this morning. I came back as soon as I  could, Miss,\" she added apologetically.    \"It isn't that,\" answered Miss Terry, drawing her hand across her forehead  dazedly. \"I did not mind your absence. But I thought it must be later.\"    \"Oh, no, I wouldn't stay out any later when you was alone here, Miss,\" said  Norah penitently. \"I felt ashamed after I had gone. I ought not to have  left you so,--on Christmas Eve. But oh, Miss! The singing was so beautiful,  and the houses looked so grand with the candles in the windows. It is like  a holy night indeed!\"    Miss Terry stooped and picked up something from the floor. It was the bit  of candle-end which had escaped the holocaust.    \"Are the candles still lighted, Norah?\" she asked, eyeing the bit of wax in  her hand.    \"Yes'm, some of them,\" answered the maid. \"It is getting late, and a good  many have burned out. But some houses are still as bright as ever.\"    \"Perhaps it is not too late, then,\" murmured Miss Terry, as if yielding a  disputed point. \"Let us hurry, Norah.\"    She rose, and going to the mantel-shelf gently took up the figure of the  Angel, while Norah looked on in amazement.    \"Norah,\" said Miss Terry, with an eagerness which made her voice tremble,  \"I want you to hang the Christmas Angel in the window there. I too have a  fancy to burn a candle to-night. If it is not too late I'd like to have a  little share in the Christmas spirit.\"    Norah's eyes lighted. \"Oh, yes'm,\" she said. \"I'll hang it right away. And  I'll find an empty spool to hold the candle.\"    She bustled briskly about, and presently in the window appeared a little  device unlike any other in the block. Against the darkness within, the  figure of the Angel with arms outstretched towards the street shone in a  soft light from the flame of a single tiny candle such as blossom on  Christmas trees.    It caught the attention of many home-goers, who said, smiling, \"How simple!  How pretty! How quaint! It is a type of the Christmas spirit which is  abroad to-night. You can feel it everywhere, blessing the city.\"    For some minutes before the candle was lighted, a man muffled in a heavy  overcoat had been standing in a doorway opposite Miss Terry's house. He was  tall and grizzled and his face was sad. He stared up at the gloomy windows,  the only oblongs of blackness in the illuminated block, and he shivered,  shrugging his shoulders.    \"The same as ever!\" he said to himself. \"I might have known she would never  change. Any one else, on Christmas Eve, after the letter I wrote her, would  have softened a little. But I might have known. She is hard as nails! Of  course, it was my fault in the first place to leave her as I did. But when  I acknowledged it, and when I wrote that letter on Christmas Eve, I thought  Angelina might feel differently.\" He looked at his watch. \"Nearly half-past  nine,\" he muttered. \"I may as well go home. She said she wanted to be let  alone; that Christmas meant nothing to her. I don't dare to call,--on my  only sister! I suppose she is there all alone, and here I am all alone,  too. What a pity! If I saw the least sign--\"    Just then there was the spark of a match against the darkness framed in by  the window opposite. A hand and arm shone in the flicker of light across  the upper sash. A tiny spark, tremulous at first, like a bird alighting on  a frail branch, paused, steadied, and became fixed. In the light of a  small taper the man caught a glimpse of a pale, long face in a frame of  silver hair. It faded into the background. But above the candle he now saw,  with arms outstretched as it seemed toward himself, a pink little angel  with gauzy wings.    The man's heart gave a leap. Sudden memories thronged his brain, making him  almost dizzy. At last they formulated into one smothered cry. \"The  Christmas Angel! It is the very same pink Angel that Angelina and I used to  hang on our Christmas tree!\"    In three great"]]]
