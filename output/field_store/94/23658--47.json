And so it is between father and  son, for should the son believe and the father deny, they will be severed  and forever dissociated from each other. Nay rather, thou witnesseth how  the son slayeth the father and the father the son. Consider in the same  light all that We have explained and related unto thee.    78 Wert thou to behold all things with the eye of discernment, thou  wouldst indeed see that this divine sword doth cleave asunder generations.  Would that ye could understand it! All this is by virtue of the word of  separation that is manifested on the Day of Judgement and Separation, were  the people to take heed in the days of their Lord. Nay, couldst thou but  sharpen thy sight and refine thy heart, thou wouldst witness that all the  material swords which in every day and age have slain the infidels and  waged war against the impious proceed from this divine and invisible  sword. Open then thine eyes, that thou mayest behold all that We have  revealed to thee and attain unto that which none other hath attained. We  verily exclaim: \"Praise be to God, He Who is the Lord of the Day of  Reckoning!\"(54)    79 Yea, inasmuch as these people have failed to acquire true knowledge  from its source and wellspring, and from the ocean of fresh and  soft-flowing waters that stream, by the leave of God, through hearts that  are pure and stainless, they have been veiled from that which God hath  intended by those words and allusions and have remained confined within  the prison of their own selves.    80 We render thanks unto God for that which He hath bestowed upon us of  His grace. He it is Who hath caused us to be assured of the truth of His  Faith--a Faith which the combined forces of earth and heaven are powerless  to resist. He it is Who hath enabled us to acknowledge Him in the day of  His presence, to testify unto Him Whom God shall make manifest in the  latter Resurrection, and to be among them that have believed in Him ere  His appearance, that His favour may be made complete unto us and unto all  mankind.    81 But hear, O My brother, My plaint against them that claim to be  associated with God and with the Manifestations of His knowledge, and yet  follow their corrupt inclinations, consume the substance of their  neighbour, are given to wine, commit murder, defraud and slander each  other, hurl calumnies against God, and are wont to speak falsely. The  people attribute all these deeds unto Us, whilst their perpetrators remain  shameless before God. They cast aside that which He hath enjoined upon  them and commit that which He hath forbidden. Yet it behoveth the people  of truth that the signs of humility should shine upon their faces, that  the light of sanctity should radiate from their countenances, that they  should walk upon the earth as though they were in the presence of God and  distinguish themselves in their deeds from all the dwellers of the earth.  Such must be their state that their eyes should behold the evidences of  His might, their tongues and hearts make mention of His name, their feet  be set towards the lands of His nearness, and their hands take fast hold  upon His precepts. And were they to pass through a valley of pure gold and  mines of precious silver, they should regard them as wholly unworthy of  their attention.    82 These people, however, have turned aside from all this and placed  instead their affections upon that which accordeth with their own corrupt  inclinations. Thus do they roam in the wilderness of arrogance and pride.  I bear witness at this moment that God is wholly quit of them, and  likewise are We. We beseech God to suffer Us not to associate with them  either in this life or in the life to come. He, verily, is the Eternal  Truth. No God is there but Him, and His might is equal to all things.    83 Quaff then, O My brother, from the living waters that We have caused to  flow in the oceans of these words. Methinks the seas of grandeur are  surging within them, and the gems of divine virtue are shining within and  upon them. Divest then thyself of that which debarreth thee from this  fathomless crimson sea, and to the cry of \"In the name of God and by His  grace!\" immerse thyself therein. Let the fear of no one dismay thee. Trust  in the Lord, thy God, for He is sufficient unto whosoever trusteth in Him.  He, verily, shall protect thee, and in Him shalt thou abide in safety.    84 Know thou, moreover, that in this most hallowed and resplendent city  thou shalt find the wayfarer to be lowly before all men and humble before  all things. For naught doth he behold save that he perceiveth God therein.  He beholdeth the effulgent glories of God in the lights of His Revelation  that have encompassed the Sinai of creation. In this station the wayfarer  must not claim the seat of honour in any gathering or walk before others  in the desire to vaunt and exalt himself. Rather must he regard himself as  standing at all times in the presence of his Lord. He must not wish for  anyone that which he doth not wish for himself, nor speak that which he  would not bear to hear spoken by another, nor yet desire for any soul that  which he would not have desired for himself. It befitteth him, rather, to  walk upon the earth with undeviating steps in the kingdom of His new  creation.    85 Know, however, that the seeker, at the outset of his journey,  witnesseth change and transformation, as hath already been mentioned. This  is undoubtedly the truth, as hath been revealed concerning those days: \"On  the day when the earth shall be changed into another earth.\"(55) These are  indeed days the like of which no mortal eye hath ever seen. Blessed is he  that attaineth thereunto and realizeth their full worth. \"We had sent  Moses with Our signs, saying unto him: 'Bring forth thy people from  darkness into light and remind them of the days of God.'\"(56) And these  are in truth the days of God, could ye but know it.    86 In this station, all changing and varying realities are manifest before  thee. Whosoever denieth this truth hath verily turned aside from the Cause  of God, rebelled against His rule, and gainsaid His sovereignty. For it is  indeed within the power of Him Who changeth the earth into another earth  to transform all that dwell and move thereon. Wherefore marvel not at how  He turneth darkness into light, light into darkness, ignorance into  knowledge, error into guidance, death into life, and life into death. It  is in this station that the law of transformation taketh effect. Ponder  thereon, if thou be of them that tread this path, that all thou didst ask  of this owly One may be made plain unto thee and that thou mayest abide  within the tabernacle of this guidance. For He doeth whatsoever He willeth  and ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth. Nor shall He be asked of His doings,  whilst all men will be asked of their every deed.(57)    87 O My brother! In this stage, which marketh the beginning of the  journey, thou shalt behold divers stations and differing signs, even as  was mentioned in connection with the City of Search. All these hold true  in their respective planes. It behoveth thine eminence in this station to  consider each created thing in its own place, neither abasing nor exalting  its true rank. For instance, if thou wert to reduce the unseen world to  the realm of creation, this would be an act of sheer blasphemy, and the  converse would likewise be the essence of impiety. Wert thou, however, to  describe the unseen world and the realm of creation within their own  stations, this would be the undoubted truth. In other words, wert thou to  witness any transformation in the realm of the divine unity, no greater  sin could be conceived in all creation, but wert thou to consider  transformation in its own place and understand it accordingly, no harm  could befall thee.    88 By My Lord! Notwithstanding all that We have revealed unto thee of the  mysteries of utterance and the degrees of exposition, methinks I have  spoken not a single letter of the ocean of God's hidden knowledge and the  essence of His inscrutable wisdom. God willing, this We shall erelong  accomplish in its appointed time. He verily, remembereth all things in  their own place, and we, in truth, all yield praise unto Him.    89 Know thou, moreover, that the bird that taketh flight in the atmosphere  of the realm on high will never be able to soar unto the heaven of  transcendent holiness, nor taste of the fruits which God hath brought  forth therein, nor quaff from the streams which He hath caused to flow in  its midst. And were it to partake but a drop thereof, it would perish  forthwith. Even as thou dost witness in these days with regard to those  who profess allegiance unto Us, and yet perform such deeds, utter such  words, and advance such claims as they have. Methinks they lie as dead  within their own veils.    90 Comprehend, in like manner, every station, sign, and allusion, that  thou mayest perceive all things in their own place and consider all  matters in their proper light. For in this station, the City of Divine  Unity, are to be found those who have entered within the ark of divine  guidance and journeyed through the heights of divine unity. Thou shalt  behold the lights of beauty upon their faces and the mysteries of glory in  their human temples. Thou shalt perceive the musk-laden fragrance of their  words and behold the signs of His sovereignty in all their ways and  doings. Nor wilt thou be veiled by the deeds of them that have failed to  quaff from the crystal springs or to attain unto the cities of holiness,  and who follow their selfish desires and spread disorder in the land, all  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1694"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: The First Thousand Years: 600 - 1600 (#8)"],[1," a monastery manor and a private  manor. The monastery was granted by Edward the Confessor full  freedom and these jurisdictions: sac and soke, toll and team,  hamsocne [the authority to fine a person for breaking into and  making entry by force into the dwelling of another], forestall  [the authority to fine a person for robbing others on the road],  blodwite [the authority to impose a forfeiture for assault  involving bloodshed], fihtwite [the authority to fine for  fighting], weordwite [the authority to fine for manslaughter,  but not for willful murder], and mundbryce [the authority to  fine for any breach of the peace, such as trespass on lands].    Marriages were determined by men asking women to marry them. If a  woman said yes, he paid a sum to her kin for her \"mund\"  [jurisdiction or protection over her] and gave his oath to them  to maintain and support the woman and any children born. As  security for this oath, he gave a valuable object or \"wed\". The  couple were then betrothed. Marriage ceremonies were performed by  priests in churches. The marriage was written into church  records. Friends witnessed the wedding and afterwards ate the  great loaf, or first bread made by the bride. This was the  forerunner of the wedding cake. They drank special ale, the  \"bride ale\" (from hence the work \"bridal\"), to the health of the  couple.    This marriage agreement with an Archbishop's sister provides her  with land, money, and horsemen:    \"Here in this document is stated the agreement which Wulfric and  the archbishop made when he obtained the archbishop's sister as  his wife, namely he promised her the estates at Orleton and  Ribbesford for her lifetime, and promised her that he would  obtain the estate at Knightwick for her for three lives from the  community at Winchcombe, and gave her the estate at Alton to  grant and bestow upon whomsoever she pleased during her lifetime  or at her death, as she preferred, and promised her 50 mancuses  of gold and 30 men and 30 horses.    The witnesses that this agreement was made as stated were  Archbishop Wulfstan and Earl Leofwine and Bishop AEthelstan and  Abbot AElfweard and the monk Brihtheah and many good men in  addition to them, both ecclesiastics and laymen. There are two  copies of this agreement, one in the possession of the  archbishop at Worcester and the other in the possession of  Bishop AEthelstan at Hereford.\"    This marriage agreement provided the wife with money, land, farm  animals and farm laborers; it also names sureties, the survivor  of whom would receive all this property:    \"Here is declared in this document the agreement which Godwine  made with Brihtric when he wooed his daughter. In the first  place he gave her a pound's weight of gold, to induce her to  accept his suit, and he granted her the estate at Street with  all that belongs to it, and 150 acres at Burmarsh and in addition  30 oxen and 20 cows and 10 horses and 10 slaves.    This agreement was made at Kingston before King Cnut, with the  cognizance of Archbishop Lyfing and the community at  Christchurch, and Abbot AElfmaer and the community at St.  Augustine's, and the sheriff AEthelwine and Sired the old and  Godwine, Wulfheah's son, and AElfsige cild and Eadmaer of Burham  and Godwine, Wulfstan's son, and Carl, the king's cniht. And  when the maiden was brought from Brightling AElfgar, Sired's  son, and Frerth, the priest of Forlstone, and the priests  Leofwine and Wulfsige from Dover, and Edred, Eadhelm's son, and  Leofwine, Waerhelm's son, and Cenwold rust and Leofwine, son of  Godwine of Horton, and Leofwine the Red and Godwine, Eadgifu's  son, and Leofsunu his brother acted as security for all this.  And whichever of them lives the longer shall succeed to all the  property both in land and everything else which I have given  them. Every trustworthy man in Kent and Sussex, whether thegn or  commoner, is cognizant of these terms.    There are three of these documents; one is at Christchurch,  another at St. Augustine's, and Brihtric himself has the third.\"    Nuns and monks lived in nunneries and monasteries on church land  and grew their own food. The local bishop usually was also an  abbot of a monastery. The priests and nuns wore long robes with  loose belts and did not carry weapons. Their life was ordered by  the ringing of the bell to start certain activities, such as  prayer; meals; meetings; work in the fields, gardens, or  workshops; copying and illuminating books; taught justice,  piety, chastity, peace, and charity; and cared for the sick.  Caring for the sick entailed mostly praying to God as it was  thought that only God could cure. The large monasteries had  libraries, dormitories, guest-houses, kitchens, butteries to  store wine, bakehouses, breweries, dairies, granaries, barns,  fish-ponds, orchards, vineyards, gardens, workshops, laundries,  lavatories with long stone or marble washing-troughs, and  towels. Slavery was diminished by the church by excommunication  for the sale of a child over seven. The clergy taught that  manumission of slaves was good for the soul of the dead, so it  became frequent in wills. The clergy were to be celibate and not  marry, but in lax times this rule was not followed.    The Archbishop of Canterbury began anointing new Kings at the  time of coronation to emphasize that the King was ruler by the  grace of God.    Illness was thought to be caused by demons. People hung charms  around their neck for cure and treatments of magic and herbs  were given. For instance, the remedy for \"mental vacancy and  folly\" was a drink of \"fennel, agrimony, cockle, and marche\".  Leeches were used for healing wounds, such as those from snake  bites.      The Law    Every free man who did not hold land had to find a lord to answer  for him. The act of homage was symbolized by placing his hands  within those of his lord. Every lord shall be personally  responsible as surety for the men of his household.    Every free man who held land had to be in a local tithing,  usually about ten men, in which they served as personal sureties  for each other's peaceful behavior [frankpledge]. If one of them  were accused of an offense, the others had to produce him in  court or pay for the offense, unless they could prove that they  had no complicity in it.    \"And every man shall see that he has a surety, and this surety  shall bring and keep him to [the performance of] every lawful  duty.    1. And if anyone does wrong and escapes, his surety shall incur  what the other should have incurred.    2. If the case be that of a thief and his surety can lay hold of  him within 12 months, he shall deliver him up to justice, and  what he has paid shall be returned to him.\"    Only a priest could declare a marriage. The groom had to bring  friends to his wedding as sureties to guarantee his oath to  maintain and support his wife and children. Those who swore to  take care of the children were called their \"godfathers\".    \"No woman or maiden shall be forced to marry a man she dislikes  or given for money.\"    \"Violence to a widow or maiden is punishable by payment of one's  wergeld.\"    No man shall have more wives than one.    No man may marry among his own kin within six degrees of  relationship or with the widow of a man as nearly related to him  as that, or with a near relative of his first wife's, or his  god-mother, or a divorced woman. Incest is punishable by payment  of one's wergeld or a fine or forfeiture of all his possessions.    Grounds for divorce were mutual consent or adultery or desertion.    Adultery was prohibited for men as well as for women.    Prostitutes shall be driven out of the land or destroyed in the  land, unless they cease from their wickedness and make amends to  the utmost of their ability.    Neither husband nor wife could sell family property without the  consent of the other.    If there was a marriage agreement, it determined the wife's  \"dower\", which would be hers upon his death. Otherwise, if a man  who held his land in socage [owned it freely and not subject to  a larger landholder] died before his wife, she got half this  property. If there were minor children, she got all this  property.    Inheritance of land to adult children was by the custom of the  land held. In some places, the custom was for the oldest son to  take it and in other places, the custom was for the youngest son  to take it. Usually, the sons each took an equal portion by  partition, but the eldest son had the right to buy out the  others as to the chief messuage [dwelling and supporting land and  buildings] as long as he compensated them with property of equal  value. If there were no legitimate sons, then each daughter took  an equal share when she married.    In London, one-third of the personal property of a decedent went  to his wife, one-third went to his children in equal shares, and  one-third he could bequeath as he wished.    \"If a man dies intestate [without a will], his lord shall have  heriot [horses, weapons, shields, and helmets] of his property  according to the deceased's rank and [the rest of] the property  shall be divided among his wife, children, and near kinsmen.\"    A man could justifiably kill an adulterer in the act with the  man's wife, daughter, sister, or mother. In Kent, a lord could  fine any bondswoman of his who had become pregnant without his  permission [childwyte].    A man could kill in defense of his own life, the life of his  kinsmen, his lord, or a man whose lord he was. The offender was  \"caught red-handed\" if the blood of his victim was still on him.  He could also kill a thief in the act of carrying off his  property, e.g. the thief hand-habbende [a thief found with the  stolen goods in his hand] or the thief back-berend [a thief  found carrying stolen goods on his back]. Self-help was  available for hamsocne [breaking into a man's house to assault  him].    Cattle theft could be dealt with only by speedy pursuit. The"]]]
