So, this deficiency can be  controlled by software (education, for instance).    XD4: This is a deficiency associated only with image-models. It does not exist  in a symbolic-model environment.    For an image-model there is no possibility to know the importance of an  element or relation. The brain will choose in a more or less arbitrary way the  importance. A model can be harmonic (stable) for any importance which is  associated with its elements and relations.    A \"lightly\" negative consequence of this deficiency is the fact that, faced  with a given external reality, almost any person makes a personal image-model  associated with that external reality. We will see later that, for extreme  situations, such deficiency is associated with the psychiatric disorder called  \"paranoia\".    The symbolic models do not have such problems. Once a symbolic model is made  in a mathematical environment, the \"law of the propagation of the errors\" is  able to predict the importance of any element or relation.    For instance, if we have a complex mathematical formula, the law of the  propagation of the errors will tell us how much the result is changed if an  element is changed with, let's say, 1%.    We already used the term \"correct\" associated with the importance of an  element or relation in an image model. If there is an external reality and two  associated models, one image-model and one symbolic-model, and if the two  models have the same predictions, then the importance associated with the  elements and relations of the image model is correct. If not, the right  importance is that of the symbolic model.    The above method is not good in any practical situation. In fact, there is no  method to know if we associated the right importance to any element or  relation of an image-model. This is XD4.    XD5: this deficiency is a technological one. It means that there is no  hardware or software method to erase a model of the brain. A model is made  forever. It can be destroyed only in an uncontrolled way due to the  biological deficiencies or the brain.    The consequence of this deficiency is huge in many practical situations. The  problem is developed more in another section of this book.        THE STRUCTURE OF THE BRAIN, THE PSM MODEL    The Protection and Surviving Model (PSM) is the basic image-model of any  brain. When a new being is born, it has only this model in its brain. This  model is very complex and it will be described in this chapter.    There is a section of the PSM, which contains a collection of short-range  models. They have to act very fast to provide minimal protection for that  being (including newborn beings) in some specific dangerous situation. These  activities are called \"reflex actions\".    The PSM contains also some basic models, like the model to keep in the  eyesight a moving entity from external reality, or the model to touch by hand  an entity in the range of the hand. There is also a collection of models  associated with equilibrium and the general stability of the external body,  together with a model of it, of course.    There are also a number of long range models which contain the instincts to  survive unconditionally, forever (basic design requirement).    During the period of growing, others models can be included in the PSM, models  which are associated with the educational process. Such models have to prepare  the being to live in a specific external reality.    By accident, any other models can enter the PSM, but some of them can produce  big problems for the future mature being, mainly paranoia type illnesses (see  ETAs).    The basic characteristic of any model from the PSM is that such a model is  invariant. It cannot be changed regardless of the information obtained from  the external reality.    The main goal of the PSM is to ensure that the being will survive  unconditionally, forever. To do this, the PSM is able to build elements, which  are activated to self-develop as models.    So, when a new situation from the external reality is met, and there is no  model to understand it, the PSM is automatically activated and tries to solve  the problem, based on some reflex actions, or based on some instincts. It also  makes a specialized element, which is activated as a model. The new model  tries to understand the new situation by independent activity, in interaction  with the external reality. When that situation is met again, the PSM is not  activated, and the specialized model solves the case. So, as a being gains  more and more experience, the PSM is not activated, but one of the specialized  models is activated instead.    Regardless of how many models are in a brain, if a new external reality occurs  and there is no model to understand it, the PSM will take the control in the  way already described.    When PSM controls a being, this can be recognized by the fact that the  consciousness disappears, as the normal structure of models is deactivated by  the PSM. This situation is called as shock-status.        THE STRUCTURE OF THE BRAIN: FUNCTIONAL FACILITIES AND TYPES OF MODELS    A basic functional facility of the brain is that any model can develop any of  its elements as a model. Once a model activates an element, that element is  able to develop itself as a model, by direct interaction with the external  reality and with any other model of the brain.    Another functional facility is described here. We see that a model can  activate any of its elements to develop itself as a model. But, even if an  element is already developed as a model, the main model continues to treat it  as an element. This important feature will be developed below.    So, a main model has an element. This element has some properties. To  integrate that element, the main model uses these properties. Now, the  problems could be like: \"why that element has such properties?\" or \"how such  properties can be changed?\" To answer such questions, the main model has to  develop the element as a model. Once an element is developed as a model, its  properties appear to be truths generated by the model. So, depending of the  point of view, referring to the same entity, we discuss about an element with  some properties, or about a model with some associated truths.    Once an element is developed as a model, the model can be changed.  A changed  model will have other associated truths, so that, when treated as an element  of the main model, it has another set of properties. Thus the properties  cannot be changed in a direct way, but through the changes in the model.  In any case, a main model can operate only with elements, regardless of the  fact that the element is or not already developed as a model.    We already use terms as \"long range models\" or \"short range models\". Let's  define them.    A long-range model has already been defined as a model with its own elements  developed as models. But here we will prefer another alternative definition. A  long-range model is a model which reaches its aims by activation and  deactivation of some of its elements. Such elements are already developed as  models.    A short-range model reaches its aims by direct activation.    Example: to switch on the light in a room, a ZM model will make a ZAM. That  ZAM will simulate the action. Based on this simulation it will activate an AZM  which, in turn, will switch on the light. The ZM-model will confirm the  success of the activity of the short-range ZAM model.    Example: To travel from a place to another, a ZM will make a ZAM. The ZAM will  make some ZAMs. These ZAMs will make some others ZAMs. For any specific  activity there will be a ZAM. Once a ZAM has reached its aim, it will be  deactivated by the ZAM-model which activated it, and a new ZAM is activated.  The general control belongs to the main-ZAM. The main-ZAM can be modified by  the main ZM. Long-range models do such activity.    Example: we enter a room and switch on the light. The light really switches  on. A local-ZM gets this information based on IR. But, a long-range ZM, which  contains the local-ZM as an element, understands that the light had been  broken, and now it is on. The local-ZM acts here as a shorter-range model. It  does not understand the general environment. The main-ZM (which contains the  local-ZM as element) is a long-range model.    We already saw that any model can activate any of its elements to self-develop  as a model. Once an element is activated, it develops itself as a model. In  turn, this new model can also activate as a model any of its elements. This  \"depth\" has only technological limits. In fact, almost any model of the brain  is a long-range model. The definitions, which are already given, respect this  feature.    Now we shall present a list with the main models of a brain:    ZAM: these models are usually long-range models. A ZM model makes them. Their  main function is to change the external reality. They are made for immediate  activation (to drink water from a glass, for instance) or they could be models  that give the orientation of the whole life of a person or anything between  these very large limits.    Such models are not changed by direct interaction with the external reality.  If a ZAM fails to do something, the upper ZAM or the local-ZM will build and  activate another ZAM.    During their activity, they have full access to any resource of the brain  (internal or external, by a ZM model).    AZM: these short-range models are direct-action models. They are connected  directly to different organs which can act on the external reality (hands,  legs..) They keep precise information about such organs. When a ZAM model has  to make a simulation of a specific action, the AZM models have to give precise  information about every feature of the associated organs.    Referring to ZAM and AZM models, any action on the external reality is based  on a simulation. Without a successful"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14591"],[0,"Faust [part 1].

Yes, he deserves your favor thoroughly,--  The clever scholar of the students, he!    (_They pass in the city-gate_.)    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          III      THE STUDY    FAUST    (_Entering, with the poodle_.)         Behind me, field and meadow sleeping,       I leave in deep, prophetic night,       Within whose dread and holy keeping       The better soul awakes to light.       The wild desires no longer win us,       The deeds of passion cease to chain;       The love of Man revives within us,       The love of God revives again.    Be still, thou poodle; make not such racket and riot!  Why at the threshold wilt snuffing be?  Behind the stove repose thee in quiet!  My softest cushion I give to thee.  As thou, up yonder, with running and leaping  Amused us hast, on the mountain's crest,    So now I take thee into my keeping,  A welcome, but also a silent, guest.         Ah, when, within our narrow chamber       The lamp with friendly lustre glows,       Flames in the breast each faded ember,       And in the heart, itself that knows.       Then Hope again lends sweet assistance,       And Reason then resumes her speech:       One yearns, the rivers of existence,       The very founts of Life, to reach.    Snarl not, poodle! To the sound that rises,  The sacred tones that my soul embrace,  This bestial noise is out of place.  We are used to see, that Man despises  What he never comprehends,  And the Good and the Beautiful vilipends,  Finding them often hard to measure:  Will the dog, like man, snarl _his_ displeasure?    But ah! I feel, though will thereto be stronger,  Contentment flows from out my breast no longer.  Why must the stream so soon run dry and fail us,  And burning thirst again assail us?  Therein I've borne so much probation!  And yet, this want may be supplied us;  We call the Supernatural to guide us;  We pine and thirst for Revelation,  Which nowhere worthier is, more nobly sent,  Than here, in our New Testament.  I feel impelled, its meaning to determine,--  With honest purpose, once for all,  The hallowed Original  To change to my beloved German.    (_He opens a volume, and commences_.)  'Tis written: \"In the Beginning was the _Word_.\"  Here am I balked: who, now can help afford?  The _Word?_--impossible so high to rate it;  And otherwise must I translate it.  If by the Spirit I am truly taught.  Then thus: \"In the Beginning was the _Thought_\"  This first line let me weigh completely,  Lest my impatient pen proceed too fleetly.  Is it the _Thought_ which works, creates, indeed?  \"In the Beginning was the _Power,\"_ I read.  Yet, as I write, a warning is suggested,  That I the sense may not have fairly tested.  The Spirit aids me: now I see the light!  \"In the Beginning was the _Act_,\" I write.    If I must share my chamber with thee,  Poodle, stop that howling, prithee!  Cease to bark and bellow!  Such a noisy, disturbing fellow  I'll no longer suffer near me.  One of us, dost hear me!  Must leave, I fear me.  No longer guest-right I bestow;  The door is open, art free to go.  But what do I see in the creature?  Is that in the course of nature?  Is't actual fact? or Fancy's shows?  How long and broad my poodle grows!  He rises mightily:  A canine form that cannot be!  What a spectre I've harbored thus!  He resembles a hippopotamus,  With fiery eyes, teeth terrible to see:  O, now am I sure of thee!  For all of thy half-hellish brood  The Key of Solomon is good.    SPIRITS (_in the corridor_)         Some one, within, is caught!       Stay without, follow him not!       Like the fox in a snare,       Quakes the old hell-lynx there.       Take heed--look about!       Back and forth hover,       Under and over,       And he'll work himself out.       If your aid avail him,       Let it not fail him;       For he, without measure,       Has wrought for our pleasure.    FAUST    First, to encounter the beast,  The Words of the Four be addressed:      Salamander, shine glorious!      Wave, Undine, as bidden!      Sylph, be thou hidden!      Gnome, be laborious!    Who knows not their sense  (These elements),--  Their properties  And power not sees,--  No mastery he inherits  Over the Spirits.         Vanish in flaming ether,       Salamander!       Flow foamingly together,       Undine!       Shine in meteor-sheen,       Sylph!       Bring help to hearth and shelf.       Incubus! Incubus!       Step forward, and finish thus!    Of the Four, no feature  Lurks in the creature.  Quiet he lies, and grins disdain:  Not yet, it seems, have I given him pain.  Now, to undisguise thee,  Hear me exorcise thee!  Art thou, my gay one,  Hell's fugitive stray-one?  The sign witness now,  Before which they bow,  The cohorts of Hell!    With hair all bristling, it begins to swell.         Base Being, hearest thou?       Knowest and fearest thou       The One, unoriginate,       Named inexpressibly,       Through all Heaven impermeate,       Pierced irredressibly!    Behind the stove still banned,  See it, an elephant, expand!  It fills the space entire,  Mist-like melting, ever faster.  'Tis enough: ascend no higher,--  Lay thyself at the feet of the Master!  Thou seest, not vain the threats I bring thee:  With holy fire I'll scorch and sting thee!  Wait not to know  The threefold dazzling glow!  Wait not to know  The strongest art within my hands!    MEPHISTOPHELES    (_while the vapor is dissipating, steps forth from behind the  stove, in the costume of a Travelling Scholar_.)  Why such a noise? What are my lord's commands?    FAUST    This was the poodle's real core,  A travelling scholar, then? The _casus_ is diverting.    MEPHISTOPHELES    The learned gentleman I bow before:  You've made me roundly sweat, that's certain!    FAUST    What is thy name?    MEPHISTOPHELES    A question small, it seems,  For one whose mind the Word so much despises;  Who, scorning all external gleams,  The depths of being only prizes.    FAUST    With all you gentlemen, the name's a test,  Whereby the nature usually is expressed.  Clearly the latter it implies  In names like Beelzebub, Destroyer, Father of Lies.  Who art thou, then?    MEPHISTOPHELES    Part of that Power, not understood,  Which always wills the Bad, and always works the Good.    FAUST    What hidden sense in this enigma lies?    MEPHISTOPHELES    I am the Spirit that Denies!  And justly so: for all things, from the Void  Called forth, deserve to be destroyed:  'Twere better, then, were naught created.  Thus, all which you as Sin have rated,--  Destruction,--aught with Evil blent,--  That is my proper element.    FAUST    Thou nam'st thyself a part, yet show'st complete to me?    MEPHISTOPHELES    The modest truth I speak to thee.  If Man, that microcosmic fool, can see  Himself a whole so frequently,  Part of the Part am I, once All, in primal Night,--  Part of the Darkness which brought forth the Light,  The haughty Light, which now disputes the space,  And claims of Mother Night her ancient place.  And yet, the struggle fails; since Light, howe'er it weaves,  Still, fettered, unto bodies cleaves:  It flows from bodies, bodies beautifies;  By bodies is its course impeded;  And so, but little time is needed,  I hope, ere, as the bodies die, it dies!    FAUST    I see the plan thou art pursuing:  Thou canst not compass general ruin,  And hast on smaller scale begun.    MEPHISTOPHELES    And truly 'tis not much, when all is done.  That which to Naught is in resistance set,--  The Something of this clumsy world,--has yet,  With all that I have undertaken,  Not been by me disturbed or shaken:  From earthquake, tempest, wave, volcano's brand,  Back into quiet settle sea and land!  And that damned stuff, the bestial, human brood,--  What use, in having that to play with?  How many have I made away with!  And ever circulates a newer, fresher blood.  It makes me furious, such things beholding:  From Water, Earth, and Air unfolding,  A thousand germs break forth and grow,  In dry, and wet, and warm, and chilly;  And had I not the Flame reserved, why, really,  There's nothing special of my own to show!    FAUST    So, to the actively eternal  Creative force, in cold disdain  You now oppose the fist infernal,  Whose wicked clench is all in vain!  Some other labor seek thou rather,  Queer Son of Chaos, to begin!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Well, we'll consider: thou canst gather  My views, when next I venture in.  Might I, perhaps, depart at present?    FAUST    Why thou shouldst ask, I don't perceive.  Though our acquaintance is so recent,  For further visits thou hast leave.  The window's here, the door is yonder;  A chimney, also, you behold.    MEPHISTOPHELES    I must confess that forth I may not wander,  My steps by one slight obstacle controlled,--  The wizard's-foot, that on your threshold made is.    FAUST    The pentagram prohibits thee?  Why, tell me now, thou Son of Hades,  If that prevents, how cam'st thou in to me?  Could such a spirit be so cheated?    MEPHISTOPHELES    Inspect the thing: the drawing's not completed.  The outer angle, you may see,  Is open left--the lines don't fit it.    FAUST    Well,--Chance, this time, has fairly hit it!  And thus, thou'rt prisoner to me?  It seems the business has succeeded.    MEPHISTOPHELES    The poodle naught remarked, as after thee he speeded;  But other aspects now obtain:  The Devil can't get out again.    FAUST    Try, then, the open window-pane!    MEPHISTOPHELES    For Devils and for spectres this is law:  Where they have entered in,"]]]
