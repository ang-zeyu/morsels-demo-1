I glanced at Draper, sitting huddled in his chair, his  clammy face as pale as that of the corpse in the mortuary hard by, his  hands tremulous and restless; and, scoundrel as I believed him to be, I  could not but pity the abject misery that was written large all over  him, from his damp hair to his incessantly shifting feet.    The jury took but a short time to consider their verdict. At the end of  five minutes the foreman announced that they were agreed, and, in answer  to the coroner's formal inquiry, stood up and replied:    \"We find that the deceased met his death by being stabbed in the chest  by the accused man, Alfred Draper.\"    \"That is a verdict of wilful murder,\" said the coroner, and he entered  it accordingly in his notes. The Court now rose. The spectators  reluctantly trooped out, the jurymen stood up and stretched themselves,  and the two constables, under the guidance of the sergeant, carried the  wretched Draper in a fainting condition to a closed fly that was waiting  outside.    \"I was not greatly impressed by the activity of the defence,\" I remarked  maliciously as we walked home.    Thorndyke smiled. \"You surely did not expect me to cast my pearls of  forensic learning before a coroner's jury,\" said he.    \"I expected that you would have something to say on behalf of your  client,\" I replied. \"As it was, his accusers had it all their own way.\"    \"And why not?\" he asked. \"Of what concern to us is the verdict of the  coroner's jury?\"    \"It would have seemed more decent to make some sort of defence,\" I  replied.    \"My dear Jervis,\" he rejoined, \"you do not seem to appreciate the great  virtue of what Lord Beaconsfield so felicitously called 'a policy of  masterly inactivity'; and yet that is one of the great lessons that a  medical training impresses on the student.\"    \"That may be so,\" said I. \"But the result, up to the present, of your  masterly policy is that a verdict of wilful murder stands against your  client, and I don't see what other verdict the jury could have found.\"    \"Neither do I,\" said Thorndyke.    I had written to my principal, Dr. Cooper, describing the stirring  events that were taking place in the village, and had received a reply  from him instructing me to place the house at Thorndyke's disposal, and  to give him every facility for his work. In accordance with which edict  my colleague took possession of a well-lighted, disused stable-loft, and  announced his intention of moving his things into it. Now, as these  \"things\" included the mysterious contents of the hamper that the  housemaid had seen, I was possessed with a consuming desire to be  present at the \"flitting,\" and I do not mind confessing that I purposely  lurked about the stairs in the hopes of thus picking up a few crumbs of  information.    But Thorndyke was one too many for me. A misbegotten infant in the  village having been seized with inopportune convulsions, I was  compelled, most reluctantly, to hasten to its relief; and I returned  only in time to find Thorndyke in the act of locking the door of the  loft.    \"A nice light, roomy place to work in,\" he remarked, as he descended the  steps, slipping the key into his pocket.    \"Yes,\" I replied, and added boldly: \"What do you intend to do up there?\"    \"Work up the case for the defence,\" he replied, \"and, as I have now  heard all that the prosecution have to say, I shall be able to forge  ahead.\"    This was vague enough, but I consoled myself with the reflection that  in a very few days I should, in common with the rest of the world, be in  possession of the results of his mysterious proceedings. For, in view of  the approaching assizes, preparations were being made to push the case  through the magistrate's court as quickly as possible in order to obtain  a committal in time for the ensuing sessions. Draper had, of course,  been already charged before a justice of the peace and evidence of  arrest taken, and it was expected that the adjourned hearing would  commence before the local magistrates on the fifth day after the  inquest.    The events of these five days kept me in a positive ferment of  curiosity. In the first place an inspector of the Criminal Investigation  Department came down and browsed about the place in company with the  sergeant. Then Mr. Bashfield, who was to conduct the prosecution, came  and took up his abode at the \"Cat and Chicken.\" But the most surprising  visitor was Thorndyke's laboratory assistant, Polton, who appeared one  evening with a large trunk and a sailor's hammock, and announced that he  was going to take up his quarters in the loft.    As to Thorndyke himself, his proceedings were beyond speculation. From  time to time he made mysterious appearances at the windows of the loft,  usually arrayed in what looked suspiciously like a nightshirt. Sometimes  I would see him holding a negative up to the light, at others  manipulating a photographic printing-frame; and once I observed him with  a paintbrush and a large gallipot; on which I turned away in despair,  and nearly collided with the inspector.    \"Dr. Thorndyke is staying with you, I hear,\" said the latter, gazing  earnestly at my colleague's back, which was presented for his inspection  at the window.    \"Yes,\" I answered. \"Those are his temporary premises.\"    \"That is where he does his bedevilments, I suppose?\" the officer  suggested.    \"He conducts his experiments there,\" I corrected haughtily.    \"That's what I mean,\" said the inspector; and, as Thorndyke at this  moment turned and opened the window, our visitor began to ascend the  steps.    \"I've just called to ask if I could have a few words with you, Doctor,\"  said the inspector, as he reached the door.    \"Certainly,\" Thorndyke replied blandly. \"If you will go down and wait  with Dr. Jervis, I will be with you in five minutes.\"    The officer came down the steps grinning, and I thought I heard him  murmur \"Sold!\" But this may have been an illusion. However, Thorndyke  presently emerged, and he and the officer strode away into the  shrubbery. What the inspector's business was, or whether he had any  business at all, I never learned; but the incident seemed to throw some  light on the presence of Polton and the sailor's hammock. And this  reference to Polton reminds me of a very singular change that took place  about this time in the habits of this usually staid and sedate little  man; who, abandoning the somewhat clerical style of dress that he  ordinarily affected, broke out into a semi-nautical costume, in which he  would sally forth every morning in the direction of Port Marston. And  there, on more than one occasion, I saw him leaning against a post by  the harbour, or lounging outside a waterside tavern in earnest and  amicable conversation with sundry nautical characters.    On the afternoon of the day before the opening of the proceedings we  had two new visitors. One of them, a grey-haired spectacled man, was a  stranger to me, and for some reason I failed to recall his name,  Copland, though I was sure I had heard it before. The other was Anstey,  the barrister who usually worked with Thorndyke in cases that went into  Court. I saw very little of either of them, however, for they retired  almost immediately to the loft, where, with short intervals for meals,  they remained for the rest of the day, and, I believe, far into the  night. Thorndyke requested me not to mention the names of his visitors  to anyone, and at the same time apologized for the secrecy of his  proceedings.    \"But you are a doctor, Jervis,\" he concluded, \"and you know what  professional confidences are; and you will understand how greatly it is  in our favour that we know exactly what the prosecution can do, while  they are absolutely in the dark as to our line of defence.\"    I assured him that I fully understood his position, and with this  assurance he retired, evidently relieved, to the council chamber.    The proceedings, which opened on the following day, and at which I was  present throughout, need not be described in detail. The evidence for  the prosecution was, of course, mainly a repetition of that given at the  inquest. Mr. Bashfield's opening statement, however, I shall give at  length, inasmuch as it summarized very clearly the whole of the case  against the prisoner.    \"The case that is now before the Court,\" said the counsel, \"involves a  charge of wilful murder against the prisoner Alfred Draper, and the  facts, in so far as they are known, are briefly these: On the night of  Monday, the 27th of September, the deceased, Charles Hearn, dined with  some friends on board the yacht _Otter_. About midnight he came ashore,  and proceeded to walk towards Sundersley along the beach. As he entered  St. Bridget's Bay, a man, who appears to have been lying in wait, and  who came down the Shepherd's Path, met him, and a deadly struggle seems  to have taken place. The deceased received a wound of a kind calculated  to cause almost instantaneous death, and apparently fell down dead.    \"And now, what was the motive of this terrible crime? It was not  robbery, for nothing appears to have been taken from the corpse. Money  and valuables were found, as far as is known, intact. Nor, clearly, was  it a case of a casual affray. We are, consequently, driven to the  conclusion that the motive was a personal one, a motive of interest or  revenge, and with this view the time, the place, and the evident  deliberateness of the murder are in full agreement.    \"So much for the motive. The next question is, Who was the perpetrator  of this shocking crime? And the answer to that question is given in a  very singular and dramatic circumstance, a circumstance that illustrates  once more the amazing lack of precaution shown by persons who commit  such crimes."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13888"],[0,"Bacon (#8)"],[1,"me, when she knoweth me better. For myself, I have lost       some opinion, some time, and some means; this is my account; but       then for opinion, it is a blast that goeth and cometh; for time, it       is true it goeth and cometh not; but yet I have learned that it may       be redeemed. For means, I value that most; and the rather, _because       I am purposed not to follow the practice of the law_ (_if her       Majesty command me in any particular, I shall be ready to do her       willing service_); and my reason is only, _because it drinketh too       much time, which I have dedicated to better purposes_. But even for       that point of estate and means, I partly lean to Thales' opinion,       That a philosopher may be rich if he will. Thus your Lordship seeth       how I comfort myself; to the increase whereof I would fain please       myself to believe that to be true which my Lord Treasurer writeth;       which is, that it is more than a philosopher morally can disgest.       But without any such high conceit, I esteem it like the pulling out       of an aching tooth, which, I remember, when I was a child, and had       little philosophy, I was glad of when it was done. For your       Lordship, I do think myself more beholding to you than to any man.       And I say, I reckon myself as a _common_ (not popular but       _common_); and as much as is lawful to be enclosed of a common, so       much your Lordship shall be sure to have.--Your Lordship's to obey       your honourable commands, more settled than ever.\"    It may be that, as Bacon afterwards maintained, the closing sentences of  this letter implied a significant reserve of his devotion. But during  the brilliant and stormy years of Essex's career which followed, Bacon's  relations to him continued unaltered. Essex pressed Bacon's claims  whenever a chance offered. He did his best to get Bacon a rich wife--the  young widow of Sir Christopher Hatton--but in vain. Instead of Bacon she  accepted Coke, and became famous afterwards in the great family quarrel,  in which Coke and Bacon again found themselves face to face, and which  nearly ruined Bacon before the time. Bacon worked for Essex when he was  wanted, and gave the advice which a shrewd and cautious friend would  give to a man who, by his success and increasing pride and  self-confidence, was running into serious dangers, arming against  himself deadly foes, and exposing himself to the chances of fortune.  Bacon was nervous about Essex's capacity for war, a capacity which  perhaps was not proved, even by the most brilliant exploit of the time,  the capture of Cadiz, in which Essex foreshadowed the heroic but  well-calculated audacities of Nelson and Cochrane, and showed himself as  little able as they to bear the intoxication of success, and to work in  concert with envious and unfriendly associates. At the end of the year  1596, the year in which Essex had won such reputation at Cadiz, Bacon  wrote him a letter of advice and remonstrance. It is a lively picture  of the defects and dangers of Essex's behaviour as the Queen's  favourite; and it is a most characteristic and worldly-wise summary of  the ways which Bacon would have him take, to cure the one and escape the  other. Bacon had, as he says, \"good reason to think that the Earl's  fortune comprehended his own.\" And the letter may perhaps be taken as an  indirect warning to Essex that Bacon must, at any rate, take care of his  own fortune, if the Earl persisted in dangerous courses. Bacon shows how  he is to remove the impressions, strong in the Queen's mind, of Essex's  defects; how he is, by due submissions and stratagems, to catch her  humour--         \"But whether I counsel you the best, or for the best, duty bindeth       me to offer to you my wishes. I said to your Lordship last time,       _Martha, Martha, attendis ad plurima, unum sufficit_; win the       Queen: if this be not the beginning, of any other course I see no       end.\"    Bacon gives a series of minute directions how Essex is to disarm the  Queen's suspicions, and to neutralize the advantage which his rivals  take of them; how he is to remove \"the opinion of his nature being  _opiniastre_ and not rulable;\" how, avoiding the faults of Leicester and  Hatton, he is, as far as he can, to \"allege them for authors and  patterns.\" Especially, he must give up that show of soldier-like  distinction, which the Queen so disliked, and take some quiet post at  Court. He must not alarm the Queen by seeking popularity; he must take  care of his estate; he must get rid of some of his officers; and he must  not be disquieted by other favourites.    Bacon wished, as he said afterwards, to see him \"with a white staff in  his hand, as my Lord of Leicester had,\" an honour and ornament to the  Court in the eyes of the people and foreign ambassadors. But Essex was  not fit for the part which Bacon urged upon him, that of an obsequious  and vigilant observer of the Queen's moods and humours. As time went on,  things became more and more difficult between him and his strange  mistress; and there were never wanting men who, like Cecil and Raleigh,  for good and bad reasons, feared and hated Essex, and who had the craft  and the skill to make the most of his inexcusable errors. At last he  allowed himself, from ambition, from the spirit of contradiction, from  the blind passion for doing what he thought would show defiance to his  enemies, to be tempted into the Irish campaign of 1599. Bacon at a later  time claimed credit for having foreseen and foretold its issue. \"I did  as plainly see his overthrow, chained as it were by destiny to that  journey, as it is possible for any man to ground a judgment on future  contingents.\" He warned Essex, so he thought in after years, of the  difficulty of the work; he warned him that he would leave the Queen in  the hands of his enemies: \"It would be ill for her, ill for him, ill for  the State.\" \"I am sure,\" he adds, \"I never in anything in my life dealt  with him in like earnestness by speech, by writing, and by all the means  I could devise.\" But Bacon's memory was mistaken. We have his letters.  When Essex went to Ireland, Bacon wrote only in the language of sanguine  hope--so little did he see \"overthrow chained by destiny to that  journey,\" that \"some good spirit led his pen to presage to his Lordship  success;\" he saw in the enterprise a great occasion of honour to his  friend; he gave prudent counsels, but he looked forward confidently to  Essex being as \"fatal a captain to that war, as Africanus was to the war  of Carthage.\" Indeed, however anxious he may have been, he could not  have foreseen Essex's unaccountable and to this day unintelligible  failure. But failure was the end, from whatever cause; failure,  disgraceful and complete. Then followed wild and guilty but abortive  projects for retrieving his failure, by using his power in Ireland to  make himself formidable to his enemies at Court, and even to the Queen  herself. He intrigued with Tyrone; he intrigued with James of Scotland;  he plunged into a whirl of angry and baseless projects, which came to  nothing the moment they were discussed. How empty and idle they were was  shown by his return against orders to tell his own story at Nonsuch, and  by thus placing himself alone and undeniably in the wrong, in the power  of the hostile Council. Of course it was not to be thought of that Cecil  should not use his advantage in the game. It was too early, irritated  though the Queen was, to strike the final blow. But it is impossible not  to see, looking back over the miserable history, that Essex was treated  in a way which was certain, sooner or later, to make him, being what he  was, plunge into a fatal and irretrievable mistake. He was treated as a  cat treats a mouse; he was worried, confined, disgraced, publicly  reprimanded, brought just within verge of the charge of treason, but not  quite, just enough to discredit and alarm him, but to leave him still a  certain amount of play. He was made to see that the Queen's favour was  not quite hopeless; but that nothing but the most absolute and  unreserved humiliation could recover it. It was plain to any one who  knew Essex that this treatment would drive Essex to madness. \"These same  gradations of yours\"--so Bacon represents himself expostulating with the  Queen on her caprices--\"are fitter to corrupt than to correct any mind  of greatness.\" They made Essex desperate; he became frightened for his  life, and he had reason to be so, though not in the way which he feared.  At length came the stupid and ridiculous outbreak of the 8th of  February, 1600/1601, a plot to seize the palace and raise the city  against the ministers, by the help of a few gentlemen armed only with  their rapiers. As Bacon himself told the Queen, \"if some base and  cruel-minded persons had entered into such an action, it might have  caused much blow and combustion; but it appeared well that they were  such as knew not how to play the malefactors!\" But it was sufficient to  bring Essex within the doom of treason.    Essex knew well what the stake was. He lost it, and deserved to lose it,  little as his enemies deserved to win it; for they, too, were doing what  would have cost them their heads if Elizabeth had known  it--corresponding, as Essex was accused of doing, with Scotland about  the succession, and possibly with Spain. But they were playing  cautiously and craftily; he with bungling passion. He had been so long  accustomed to power and place, that he could not endure that rivals  should keep him out of it. They were content to have their own way,  while affecting to be the humblest of servants; he would be nothing less  than a Mayor of the Palace. He was guilty of a great public crime, as  every man is who appeals to arms for anything short of the most sacred  cause. He was bringing into England, which had settled down into  peaceable ways, an"]]]
