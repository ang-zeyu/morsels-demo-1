If ye have been  careless of the Qur'an, the Bayan cannot be regarded to be remote from  you. Behold it open before your eyes. Read ye its verses, that perchance  ye desist from committing that which will cause the Messengers of God to  mourn and lament.    Speed out of your sepulchers. How long will ye sleep? The second blast  hath been blown on the trumpet. On whom are ye gazing? This is your Lord,  the God of Mercy. Witness how ye gainsay His signs! The earth hath quaked  with a great quaking, and cast forth her burdens. Will ye not admit it?  Say: Will ye not recognize how the mountains have become like flocks of  wool, how the people are sore vexed at the awful majesty of the Cause of  God? Witness how their houses are empty ruins, and they themselves a  drowned host.    This is the Day whereon the All-Merciful hath come down in the clouds of  knowledge, clothed with manifest sovereignty. He well knoweth the actions  of men. He it is Whose glory none can mistake, could ye but comprehend it.  The heaven of every religion hath been rent, and the earth of human  understanding been cleft asunder, and the angels of God are seen  descending. Say: This is the Day of mutual deceit; whither do ye flee? The  mountains have passed away, and the heavens have been folded together, and  the whole earth is held within His grasp, could ye but understand it. Who  is it that can protect you? None, by Him Who is the All-Merciful! None,  except God, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Beneficent. Every woman  that hath had a burden in her womb hath cast her burden. We see men  drunken in this Day, the Day in which men and angels have been gathered  together.    Say: Is there any doubt concerning God? Behold how He hath come down from  the heaven of His grace, girded with power and invested with sovereignty.  Is there any doubt concerning His signs? Open ye your eyes, and consider  His clear evidence. Paradise is on your right hand, and hath been brought  nigh unto you, while Hell hath been made to blaze. Witness its devouring  flame. Haste ye to enter into Paradise, as a token of Our mercy unto you,  and drink ye from the hands of the All-Merciful the Wine that is life  indeed.    Drink with healthy relish, O people of Baha. Ye are indeed they with whom  it shall be well. This is what they who have near access to God have  attained. This is the flowing water ye were promised in the Qur'an, and  later in the Bayan, as a recompense from your Lord, the God of Mercy.  Blessed are they that quaff it.    O My servant that hath turned thy face towards Me! Render thanks unto God  for having sent down unto thee this Tablet in this Prison, that thou  mayest remind the people of the days of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, the  All-Knowing. Thus have We established for thee, through the waters of Our  wisdom and utterance, the foundations of thy belief. This, verily, is the  water whereon the Throne of thy Lord hath been raised. \"His Throne had  stood upon the waters.\" Ponder this in thine heart, that thou mayest  comprehend its meaning. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.            XIX: TO EVERY DISCERNING AND ILLUMINATED HEART IT...      To every discerning and illuminated heart it is evident that God, the  unknowable Essence, the Divine Being, is immensely exalted beyond every  human attribute, such as corporeal existence, ascent and descent, egress  and regress. Far be it from His glory that human tongue should adequately  recount His praise, or that human heart comprehend His fathomless mystery.  He is, and hath ever been, veiled in the ancient eternity of His Essence,  and will remain in His Reality everlastingly hidden from the sight of men.  \"No vision taketh in Him, but He taketh in all vision; He is the Subtile,  the All-Perceiving.\"...    The door of the knowledge of the Ancient of Days being thus closed in the  face of all beings, the Source of infinite grace, according to His saying,  \"His grace hath transcended all things; My grace hath encompassed them  all,\" hath caused those luminous Gems of Holiness to appear out of the  realm of the spirit, in the noble form of the human temple, and be made  manifest unto all men, that they may impart unto the world the mysteries  of the unchangeable Being, and tell of the subtleties of His imperishable  Essence.    These sanctified Mirrors, these Day Springs of ancient glory, are, one and  all, the Exponents on earth of Him Who is the central Orb of the universe,  its Essence and ultimate Purpose. From Him proceed their knowledge and  power; from Him is derived their sovereignty. The beauty of their  countenance is but a reflection of His image, and their revelation a sign  of His deathless glory. They are the Treasuries of Divine knowledge, and  the Repositories of celestial wisdom. Through them is transmitted a grace  that is infinite, and by them is revealed the Light that can never  fade.... These Tabernacles of Holiness, these Primal Mirrors which reflect  the light of unfading glory, are but expressions of Him Who is the  Invisible of the Invisibles. By the revelation of these Gems of Divine  virtue all the names and attributes of God, such as knowledge and power,  sovereignty and dominion, mercy and wisdom, glory, bounty, and grace, are  made manifest.    These attributes of God are not, and have never been, vouchsafed specially  unto certain Prophets, and withheld from others. Nay, all the Prophets of  God, His well-favored, His holy and chosen Messengers are, without  exception, the bearers of His names, and the embodiments of His  attributes. They only differ in the intensity of their revelation, and the  comparative potency of their light. Even as He hath revealed: \"Some of the  Apostles We have caused to excel the others.\"    It hath, therefore, become manifest and evident that within the  tabernacles of these Prophets and chosen Ones of God the light of His  infinite names and exalted attributes hath been reflected, even though the  light of some of these attributes may or may not be outwardly revealed  from these luminous Temples to the eyes of men. That a certain attribute  of God hath not been outwardly manifested by these Essences of Detachment  doth in no wise imply that they who are the Day Springs of God's  attributes and the Treasuries of His holy names did not actually possess  it. Therefore, these illuminated Souls, these beauteous Countenances have,  each and every one of them, been endowed with all the attributes of God,  such as sovereignty, dominion, and the like, even though to outward  seeming they be shorn of all earthly majesty....            XX: KNOW THOU OF A CERTAINTY THAT THE UNSEEN...      Know thou of a certainty that the Unseen can in no wise incarnate His  Essence and reveal it unto men. He is, and hath ever been, immensely  exalted beyond all that can either be recounted or perceived. From His  retreat of glory His voice is ever proclaiming: \"Verily, I am God; there  is none other God besides Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. I have  manifested Myself unto men, and have sent down Him Who is the Day Spring  of the signs of My Revelation. Through Him I have caused all creation to  testify that there is none other God except Him, the Incomparable, the  All-Informed, the All-Wise.\" He Who is everlastingly hidden from the eyes  of men can never be known except through His Manifestation, and His  Manifestation can adduce no greater proof of the truth of His Mission than  the proof of His own Person.            XXI: O SALMAN! THE DOOR OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF...      O Salman! The door of the knowledge of the Ancient Being hath ever been,  and will continue for ever to be, closed in the face of men. No man's  understanding shall ever gain access unto His holy court. As a token of  His mercy, however, and as a proof of His loving-kindness, He hath  manifested unto men the Day Stars of His divine guidance, the Symbols of  His divine unity, and hath ordained the knowledge of these sanctified  Beings to be identical with the knowledge of His own Self. Whoso  recognizeth them hath recognized God. Whoso hearkeneth to their call, hath  hearkened to the Voice of God, and whoso testifieth to the truth of their  Revelation, hath testified to the truth of God Himself. Whoso turneth away  from them, hath turned away from God, and whoso disbelieveth in them, hath  disbelieved in God. Every one of them is the Way of God that connecteth  this world with the realms above, and the Standard of His Truth unto every  one in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. They are the Manifestations of  God amidst men, the evidences of His Truth, and the signs of His glory.            XXII: THE BEARERS OF THE TRUST OF GOD ARE MADE...      The Bearers of the Trust of God are made manifest unto the peoples of the  earth as the Exponents of a new Cause and the Revealers of a new Message.  Inasmuch as these Birds of the celestial Throne are all sent down from the  heaven of the Will of God, and as they all arise to proclaim His  irresistible Faith, they, therefore, are regarded as one soul and the same  person. For they all drink from the one Cup of the love of God, and all  partake of the fruit of the same Tree of Oneness.    These Manifestations of God have each a twofold station. One is the  station of pure abstraction and essential unity. In this respect, if thou  callest them all by one name, and dost ascribe to them the same  attributes, thou hast not erred from the truth. Even as He hath revealed:  \"No distinction do We make between any of His Messengers.\" For they, one  and all, summon the people of the earth to acknowledge the unity of God,  and herald unto them the Kaw_th_ar of an infinite grace and bounty. They  are all invested with the robe of prophethood, and are honored with the  mantle of glory. Thus hath Muhammad, the Point of the Qur'an, revealed: \"I  am all the Prophets.\" Likewise, He saith: \"I am the first Adam, Noah,  Moses,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16941"],[0,"The Hidden Words of Bahá'u'lláh (#8)"],[1,"of mystic  holiness and not the regions of satanic fancy. The comb, too, have I given  thee that thou mayest dress My raven locks, and not lacerate My throat.        \"80: O MY SERVANTS! Ye are the trees of My garden; ye must give forth...\"      O MY SERVANTS! Ye are the trees of My garden; ye must give forth goodly  and wondrous fruits, that ye yourselves and others may profit therefrom.  Thus it is incumbent on every one to engage in crafts and professions, for  therein lies the secret of wealth, O men of understanding! For results  depend upon means, and the grace of God shall be all-sufficient unto you.  Trees that yield no fruit have been and will ever be for the fire.        \"81: O MY SERVANT! The basest of men are they that yield no fruit...\"      O MY SERVANT! The basest of men are they that yield no fruit on earth.  Such men are verily counted as among the dead, nay better are the dead in  the sight of God than those idle and worthless souls.        \"82: O MY SERVANT! The best of men are they that earn a livelihood...\"      O MY SERVANT! The best of men are they that earn a livelihood by their  calling and spend upon themselves and upon their kindred for the love of  God, the Lord of all worlds. The mystic and wondrous Bride, hidden ere  this beneath the veiling of utterance, hath now, by the grace of God and  His divine favor, been made manifest even as the resplendent light shed by  the beauty of the Beloved. I bear witness, O friends! that the favor is  complete, the argument fulfilled, the proof manifest and the evidence  established. Let it now be seen what your endeavors in the path of  detachment will reveal. In this wise hath the divine favor been fully  vouchsafed unto you and unto them that are in heaven and on earth. All  praise to God, the Lord of all Worlds."]]]
