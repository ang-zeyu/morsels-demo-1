But waving these aside like flies,      Young Fairfax through the wall does rise.      Then the unfrequented vault appeared,      And superstition, vainly feared;      The relicks false were set to view;      Only the jewels there were true,      And truly bright and holy Thwaites,      That weeping at the altar waits.      But the glad youth away her bears,      And to the Nuns bequeathes her tears,      Who guiltily their prize bemoan,      Like gypsies who a child have stol'n.\"    The poet then goes on to glorify the results of this union and to  describe happy days spent at Nunappleton by the descendants of Isabella  Thwaites.        \"At the demolishing, this seat      To Fairfax fell, as by escheat;      And what both nuns and founders willed,      'Tis likely better thus fulfilled.      For if the virgin proved not theirs,      The cloister yet remained hers;      Though many a nun there made her vow,      'Twas no religious house till now.      From that blest bed the hero came      Whom France and Poland yet does fame;      Who, when retired here to peace,      His warlike studies could not cease;      But laid these gardens out, in sport,      In the just figure of a fort,      And with five bastions it did fence,      As aiming one for every sense.      When in the east the morning ray      Hangs out the colours of the day,      The bee through these known alleys hums,      Beating the dian with its drums.      Then flowers their drowsy eyelids raise,      Their silken ensigns each displays,      And dries its pan, yet dank with dew,      And fills its flask with odours new.      These as their Governor goes by      In fragrant volleys they let fly,      And to salute their Governess      Again as great a charge they press:      None for the virgin nymph; for she      Seems with the flowers a flower to be.      And think so still! though not compare      With breath so sweet, or cheek so fair!      Well shot, ye firemen! Oh, how sweet      And round your equal fires do meet,      Whose shrill report no ear can tell,      But echoes to the eye and smell!      See how the flowers, as at parade,      Under their colours stand displayed;      Each regiment in order grows,      That of the tulip, pink and rose.      But when the vigilant patrol      Of stars walk round about the pole,      Their leaves, which to the stalks are curled,      Seem to their staves the ensigns furled.      Then in some flower's beloved hut,      Each bee, as sentinel, is shut,      And sleeps so too, but, if once stirred,      She runs you through, nor asks the word.        Oh, thou, that dear and happy isle,      The garden of the world erewhile,      Thou Paradise of the four seas,      Which heaven planted us to please,      But, to exclude the world, did guard      With watery, if not flaming sword,--      What luckless apple did we taste,      To make us mortal, and thee waste?      Unhappy! shall we never more      That sweet militia restore,      When gardens only had their towers      And all the garrisons were flowers,      When roses only arms might bear,      And men did rosy garlands wear?      Tulips, in several colours barred,      Were then the Switzers of our guard;      The gardener had the soldier's place,      And his more gentle forts did trace;      The nursery of all things green      Was then the only magazine;      The winter quarters were the stoves,      Where he the tender plants removes.      But war all this doth overgrow:      We ordnance plant, and powder sow.        The arching boughs unite between      The columns of the temple green,      And underneath the winged quires      Echo about their tuned fires.      The nightingale does here make choice      To sing the trials of her voice;      Low shrubs she sits in, and adorns      With music high the squatted thorns;      But highest oaks stoop down to hear,      And listening elders prick the ear;      The thorn, lest it should hurt her, draws      Within the skin its shrunken claws.      But I have for my music found      A sadder, yet more pleasing sound;      The stock-doves, whose fair necks are graced      With nuptial rings, their ensigns chaste,      Yet always, for some cause unknown,      Sad pair, unto the elms they moan.      O why should such a couple mourn,      That in so equal flames do burn!      Then as I careless on the bed      Of gelid strawberries do tread,      And through the hazels thick espy      The hatching throstle's shining eye,      The heron, from the ash's top,      The eldest of its young lets drop,      As if it stork-like did pretend      That tribute to its lord to send.        Thus I, easy philosopher,      Among the birds and trees confer;      And little now to make me, wants,      Or of the fowls, or of the plants;      Give me but wings as they, and I      Straight floating on the air shall fly;      Or turn me but, and you shall see      I was but an inverted tree.      Already I begin to call      In their most learn'd original,      And where I language want, my signs      The bird upon the bough divines,      And more attentive there doth sit      Than if she were with lime-twigs knit,      No leaf does tremble in the wind,      Which I returning cannot find.      One of these scattered Sibyls' leaves      Strange prophecies my fancy weaves,      And in one history consumes,      Like Mexique paintings, all the plumes;      What Rome, Greece, Palestine e'er said,      I in this light mosaic read.      Thrice happy he, who, not mistook,      Hath read in Nature's mystic book!      And see how chance's better wit      Could with a mask my studies hit!      The oak-leaves me embroider all,      Between which caterpillars crawl;      And ivy, with familiar trails,      Me licks and clasps, and curls and hales.      Under this Attic cope I move,      Like some great prelate of the grove;      Then, languishing with ease, I toss      On pallets swoln of velvet moss,      While the wind, cooling through the boughs,      Flatters with air my panting brows.      Thanks for your rest, ye mossy banks,      And unto you, cool zephyrs, thanks,      Who, as my hair, my thoughts too shed,      And winnow from the chaff my head!        How safe, methinks, and strong behind      These trees, have I encamped my mind,      Where beauty, aiming at the heart,      Bends in some tree its useless dart,      And where the world no certain shot      Can make, or me it toucheth not,      But I on it securely play      And gall its horsemen all the day.      Bind me, ye woodbines, in your twines      Curl me about, ye gadding vines,      And oh so close your circles lace,      That I may never leave this place!      But, lest your fetters prove too weak,      Ere I your silken bondage break,      Do you, O brambles, chain me too,      And, courteous briars, nail me through!        Oh what a pleasure 'tis to hedge      My temples here with heavy sedge,      Abandoning my lazy side,      Stretched as a bank unto the tide,      Or to suspend my sliding foot      On the osier's undermined root,      And in its branches tough to hang,      While at my lines the fishes twang?      But now away, my hooks, my quills,      And angles, idle utensils!      The young MARIA walks to-night;        'Tis she that to these gardens gave      That wondrous beauty which they have;      She straightness on the woods bestows;      To her the meadow sweetness owes;      Nothing could make the river be      So crystal pure, but only she,      She yet more pure, sweet, straight, and fair      Than gardens, woods, meads, rivers are.        This 'tis to have been from the first      In a domestic heaven nursed,      Under the discipline severe      Of FAIRFAX, and the starry VERE;      Where not one object can come nigh      But pure, and spotless as the eye,      And goodness doth itself entail      On females, if there want a male.\"    This poem, having a biographical value, I have quoted at, perhaps, too  great length. Other poems of this garden-period of Marvell's life are  better known. His own English version of his Latin poem _Hortus_  contains lovely stanzas:--        \"How vainly men themselves amaze      To win the palm, the oak, or bays;      And their uncessant labours see      Crowned from some single herb or tree,      Whose short and narrow-verged shade      Does prudently their toils upbraid;      While all the flowers and trees do close,      To weave the garlands of Repose!        Fair Quiet, have I found thee here,      And Innocence, thy sister dear?      Mistaken long, I sought you then      In busy companies of men.      Your sacred plants, if here below,      Only among the plants will grow;      Society is all but rude      To this delicious solitude.        No white nor red was ever seen      So amorous as this lovely green.        What wond'rous life is this I lead!      Ripe apples drop about my head;      The luscious clusters of the vine      Upon my mouth do crush their wine;      The nectarine, and curious peach,      Into my hands themselves do reach;      Stumbling on melons, as I pass,      Insnared with flowers, I fall on grass.        Meanwhile the mind, from pleasure less,      Withdraws into its happiness;--      The mind, that ocean where each kind      Does straight its own resemblance find;--      Yet it creates, transcending these,      Far other worlds, and other seas,      Annihilating all that's made      To a green thought in a green shade.\"[46:1]    Well known as are Marvell's lines to his Coy Mistress, I have not the  heart to omit them, so eminently characteristic are they of his style  and humour:--    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17396"],[0,"The Secret Garden (#8)"],[1," beak.    \"It is the garden,\" she said. \"I am sure it is.\"    She walked round and looked closely at that side of the orchard wall,  but she only found what she had found before--that there was no door in  it. Then she ran through the kitchen-gardens again and out into the walk  outside the long ivy-covered wall, and she walked to the end of it and  looked at it, but there was no door; and then she walked to the other  end, looking again, but there was no door.    \"It's very queer,\" she said. \"Ben Weatherstaff said there was no door  and there is no door. But there must have been one ten years ago,  because Mr. Craven buried the key.\"    This gave her so much to think of that she began to be quite interested  and feel that she was not sorry that she had come to Misselthwaite  Manor. In India she had always felt hot and too languid to care much  about anything. The fact was that the fresh wind from the moor had begun  to blow the cobwebs out of her young brain and to waken her up a little.    She stayed out of doors nearly all day, and when she sat down to her  supper at night she felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable. She did not  feel cross when Martha chattered away. She felt as if she rather liked  to hear her, and at last she thought she would ask her a question. She  asked it after she had finished her supper and had sat down on the  hearth-rug before the fire.    \"Why did Mr. Craven hate the garden?\" she said.    She had made Martha stay with her and Martha had not objected at all.  She was very young, and used to a crowded cottage full of brothers and  sisters, and she found it dull in the great servants' hall down-stairs  where the footman and upper-housemaids made fun of her Yorkshire speech  and looked upon her as a common little thing, and sat and whispered  among themselves. Martha liked to talk, and the strange child who had  lived in India, and been waited upon by \"blacks,\" was novelty enough to  attract her.    She sat down on the hearth herself without waiting to be asked.    \"Art tha' thinkin' about that garden yet?\" she said. \"I knew tha' would.  That was just the way with me when I first heard about it.\"    \"Why did he hate it?\" Mary persisted.    Martha tucked her feet under her and made herself quite comfortable.    \"Listen to th' wind wutherin' round the house,\" she said. \"You could  bare stand up on the moor if you was out on it to-night.\"    Mary did not know what \"wutherin'\" meant until she listened, and then  she understood. It must mean that hollow shuddering sort of roar which  rushed round and round the house as if the giant no one could see were  buffeting it and beating at the walls and windows to try to break in.  But one knew he could not get in, and somehow it made one feel very safe  and warm inside a room with a red coal fire.    \"But why did he hate it so?\" she asked, after she had listened. She  intended to know if Martha did.    Then Martha gave up her store of knowledge.    \"Mind,\" she said, \"Mrs. Medlock said it's not to be talked about.  There's lots o' things in this place that's not to be talked over.  That's Mr. Craven's orders. His troubles are none servants' business, he  says. But for th' garden he wouldn't be like he is. It was Mrs. Craven's  garden that she had made when first they were married an' she just loved  it, an' they used to 'tend the flowers themselves. An' none o' th'  gardeners was ever let to go in. Him an' her used to go in an' shut th'  door an' stay there hours an' hours, readin' an' talkin'. An' she was  just a bit of a girl an' there was an old tree with a branch bent like a  seat on it. An' she made roses grow over it an' she used to sit there.  But one day when she was sittin' there th' branch broke an' she fell on  th' ground an' was hurt so bad that next day she died. Th' doctors  thought he'd go out o' his mind an' die, too. That's why he hates it. No  one's never gone in since, an' he won't let any one talk about it.\"    Mary did not ask any more questions. She looked at the red fire and  listened to the wind \"wutherin'.\" It seemed to be \"wutherin'\" louder  than ever.    At that moment a very good thing was happening to her. Four good things  had happened to her, in fact, since she came to Misselthwaite Manor. She  had felt as if she had understood a robin and that he had understood  her; she had run in the wind until her blood had grown warm; she had  been healthily hungry for the first time in her life; and she had found  out what it was to be sorry for some one. She was getting on.    But as she was listening to the wind she began to listen to something  else. She did not know what it was, because at first she could scarcely  distinguish it from the wind itself. It was a curious sound--it seemed  almost as if a child were crying somewhere. Sometimes the wind sounded  rather like a child crying, but presently Mistress Mary felt quite sure  that this sound was inside the house, not outside it. It was far away,  but it was inside. She turned round and looked at Martha.    \"Do you hear any one crying?\" she said.    Martha suddenly looked confused.    \"No,\" she answered. \"It's th' wind. Sometimes it sounds like as if some  one was lost on th' moor an' wailin'. It's got all sorts o' sounds.\"    \"But listen,\" said Mary. \"It's in the house--down one of those long  corridors.\"    And at that very moment a door must have been opened somewhere  down-stairs; for a great rushing draft blew along the passage and the  door of the room they sat in was blown open with a crash, and as they  both jumped to their feet the light was blown out and the crying sound  was swept down the far corridor so that it was to be heard more plainly  than ever.    \"There!\" said Mary. \"I told you so! It is some one crying--and it isn't a  grown-up person.\"    Martha ran and shut the door and turned the key, but before she did it  they both heard the sound of a door in some far passage shutting with a  bang, and then everything was quiet, for even the wind ceased  \"wutherin'\" for a few moments.    \"It was th' wind,\" said Martha stubbornly. \"An' if it wasn't, it was  little Betty Butterworth, th' scullery-maid. She's had th' toothache all  day.\"    But something troubled and awkward in her manner made Mistress Mary  stare very hard at her. She did not believe she was speaking the truth.          CHAPTER VI    \"THERE WAS SOME ONE CRYING--THERE WAS!\"      The next day the rain poured down in torrents again, and when Mary  looked out of her window the moor was almost hidden by gray mist and  cloud. There could be no going out to-day.    \"What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?\" she asked  Martha.    \"Try to keep from under each other's feet mostly,\" Martha answered. \"Eh!  there does seem a lot of us then. Mother's a good-tempered woman but she  gets fair moithered. The biggest ones goes out in th' cow-shed and plays  there. Dickon he doesn't mind th' wet. He goes out just th' same as if  th' sun was shinin'. He says he sees things on rainy days as doesn't  show when it's fair weather. He once found a little fox cub half drowned  in its hole and he brought it home in th' bosom of his shirt to keep it  warm. Its mother had been killed nearby an' th' hole was swum out an'  th' rest o' th' litter was dead. He's got it at home now. He found a  half-drowned young crow another time an' he brought it home, too, an'  tamed it. It's named Soot because it's so black, an' it hops an' flies  about with him everywhere.\"    The time had come when Mary had forgotten to resent Martha's familiar  talk. She had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when she  stopped or went away. The stories she had been told by her Ayah when she  lived in India had been quite unlike those Martha had to tell about the  moorland cottage which held fourteen people who lived in four little  rooms and never had quite enough to eat. The children seemed to tumble  about and amuse themselves like a litter of rough, good-natured collie  puppies. Mary was most attracted by the mother and Dickon. When Martha  told stories of what \"mother\" said or did they always sounded  comfortable.    \"If I had a raven or a fox cub I could play with it,\" said Mary. \"But I  have nothing.\"    Martha looked perplexed.    \"Can tha' knit?\" she asked.    \"No,\" answered Mary.    \"Can tha' sew?\"    \"No.\"    \"Can tha' read?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then why doesn't tha' read somethin', or learn a bit o' spellin'?  Tha'st old enough to be learnin' thy book a good bit now.\"    \"I haven't any books,\" said Mary. \"Those I had were left in India.\"    \"That's a pity,\" said Martha. \"If Mrs. Medlock'd let thee go into th'  library, there's thousands o' books there.\"    Mary did not ask where the library was, because she was suddenly  inspired by a new idea. She made up her mind to go and find it herself.  She was not troubled about Mrs. Medlock. Mrs. Medlock seemed always to  be in her comfortable housekeeper's sitting-room down-stairs. In this  queer place one scarcely ever saw any one at all. In fact, there was no  one to see but the servants, and when their master was away they lived a  luxurious life below stairs, where there was a huge kitchen hung about  with shining brass and pewter, and a large servants' hall where there  were four or five abundant meals eaten every day, and where a great deal  of lively romping went on when Mrs. Medlock was out of the way.    Mary's meals were served regularly, and Martha waited on her, but no one  troubled themselves about her in the least. Mrs. Medlock came and looked  at her every day or two, but no one inquired what she did or told her  what to do. She supposed that perhaps this was the English way of  treating children. In India she had always been attended by her Ayah,  who had followed her about and waited on her, hand and foot. She had  often been tired of her company. Now she was followed by nobody and was  learning to dress herself because Martha looked as though she thought  she "]]]
