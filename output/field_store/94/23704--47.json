Maida  stood for a long time at the window listening to a parrot who called  at intervals from somewhere in the neighborhood. \"Get up, you  sleepy-heads! Get up! Get up!\"    A huge puddle stretched across Primrose Court. When Maida took her  place in the swivel-chair, three children had begun already to float  shingles across its muddy expanse. Two of them were Molly and Tim  Doyle, the third a little girl whom Maida did not know. For a time  she watched them, fascinated. But, presently, the school children  crowding into the shop took all her attention. After the bell rang  and the neighborhood had become quiet again, she resumed her watch  of the mud-puddle fun.    Now they were loading their shingles with leaves, twigs, pebbles,  anything that they could find in the gutters. By lashing the water  into waves, as they trotted in the wake of their frail craft, they  managed to sail them from one end of the puddle to the other. Maida  followed the progress of these merchant vessels as breathlessly as  their owners. Some capsized utterly. Others started to founder and  had to be dragged ashore. A few brought the cruise to a triumphant  finish.    But Tim soon put an end to this fun. Unexpectedly, his foot caught  somewhere and he sprawled headlong in the tide. \"Oh, Tim!\" Molly  said. But she said it without surprise or anger. And Tim lay flat on  his stomach without moving, as if it were a common occurrence with  him. Molly waded out to him, picked him up and marched him into the  house.    The other little girl had disappeared. Suddenly she came out of one  of the yards, clasping a Teddy-bear and a whole family of dolls in  her fat arms. She sat down at the puddle's edge and began to undress  them. Maida idly watched the busy little fingers--one, two, three,  four, five--now there were six shivering babies. What was she going  to do with them? Maida wondered.    \"Granny,\" Maida called, \"do come and see this little girl! She's--\"  But Maida did not finish that sentence in words. It ended in a  scream. For suddenly the little girl threw the Teddy-bear and all  the six dolls into the puddle. Maida ran out the door. Half-way  across the court she met Dicky Dore swinging through the water.  Between them they fished all the dolls out. One was of celluloid and  another of rubber--they had floated into the middle of the pond. Two  china babies had sunk to the very bottom--their white faces smiled  placidly up through the water at their rescuers. A little rag-doll  lay close to the shore, water-logged. A pretty paper-doll had melted  to a pulp. And the biggest and prettiest of them, a lovely blonde  creature with a shapely-jointed body and a bisque head, covered with  golden curls, looked hopelessly bedraggled.    \"Oh, Betsy Hale!\" Dicky said. \"You naughty, naughty girl! How could  you drown your own children like that?\"    \"I were divin' them a baff,\" Betsy explained.    Betsy was a little, round butterball of a girl with great brown eyes  all tangled up in eyelashes and a little pink rosebud of a mouth,  folded over two rows of mice-teeth. She smiled deliciously up into  Maida's face:    \"I aren't naughty, is I?\" she asked.    \"Naughty? You bunny-duck! Of course you are,\" Maida said, giving her  a bear-hug. \"I don't see how anybody can scold her,\" she whispered  to Dicky.    \"Scold her! You can't,\" Dicky said disgustedly. \"She's too cute. And  then if you did scold her it wouldn't do any good. She's the  naughtiest baby in the neighborhood--although,\" he added with pride,  \"I think Delia's going to be pretty nearly as naughty when she gets  big enough. But Betsy Hale--why, the whole street has to keep an eye  on her. Come, pick up your dollies, Betsy,\" he wheedled, \"they'll  get cold if you leave them out here.\"    The thought of danger to her darlings produced immediate activity on  Betsy's part. She gathered the dolls under her cape, hugging them  close. \"Her must put her dollies to bed,\" she said wisely.    \"Calls herself _her_ half the time,\" Dicky explained. He gathered up  the dresses and shooing Betsy ahead of him, followed her into the  yard.    \"She's the greatest child I ever saw,\" he said, rejoining Maida a  little later. \"The things she thinks of to do! Why, the other day,  Miss Allison--the sister of the blind lady what sits in the window  and knits--the one what owns the parrot--well, Miss Allison painted  one of her old chairs red and put it out in the yard to dry. Then  she washed a whole lot of lace and put that out to dry. Next thing  she knew she looked out and there was Betsy washing all the red  paint off the chair with the lace. You'd have thought that would  have been enough for one day, wouldn't you? Well, that afternoon she  turned the hose on Mr. Flanagan--that's the policeman on the beat.\"    \"What did he say?\" Maida asked in alarm. She had a vague imaginary  picture of Betsy being dragged to the station-house.    \"Roared! But then Mr. Flanagan thinks Betsy's all right. Always  calls her 'sophy Sparkles.' Betsy runs away about twice a week. Mr.  Flanagan's always finding her and lugging her home. I guess every  policeman in Charlestown knows her by this time. There, look at her  now! Did you ever see such a kid?\"    Betsy had come out of the yard again. She was carrying a huge  feather duster over her head as if it were a parasol.    \"The darling!\" Maida said joyously. \"I hope she'll do something  naughty every day.\"    \"Queer how you love a naughty child,\" Dick said musingly. \"They're  an awful lot of trouble but you can't help liking them. Has Tim  Doyle fallen into the puddle yet?\"    \"Yes, just a little while ago.\"    \"He's always falling in mud puddles. I guess if Molly fishes him out  once after a rain, she does a half a dozen times.\"    \"Do come and see me, Dicky, won't you?\" Maida asked when they got to  the shop door. \"You know I shall be lonely when all the children are  in school and--then besides--you're the first friend I've made.\"    At the word _friend_, Dicky's beautiful smile shone bright. \"Sure,  I'll come,\" he said heartily. \"I'll come often.\"    \"Granny,\" Maida exclaimed, bursting into the kitchen, \"wait until  you hear about Betsy Hale.\" She told the whole story. \"Was I ever a  naughty little girl?\" she concluded.    \"Naughty? Glory be, and what's ailing you? 'Twas the best choild  this side of Heaven that you was. Always so sick and yet niver a  cross wurrud out of you.\"    A shadow fell over Maida's face. \"Oh, dear, dear,\" she grieved. \"I  wish I had been a naughty child--people love naughty children so. Are  you quite sure I was always good, Granny?\"    \"Why, me blessid lamb, 'twas too sick that you was to be naughty.  You cud hardly lift one little hand from the bed.\"    \"But, Granny, dear,\" Maida persisted, \"can't you think of one  single, naughty thing I did? I'm sure you can if you try hard.\"    Maida's face was touched with a kind of sad wistfulness. Granny  looked down at her, considerably puzzled. Then a light seemed to  break in her mind. It shone through her blue eyes and twinkled in  her smile.    \"Sure and Oi moind wance when Oi was joost afther giving you some  medicine and you was that mad for having to take the stuff that you  sat oop in bed and knocked iv'ry bottle off the table. Iv'ry wan!  Sure, we picked oop glass for a wake afther.\"    Maida's wistful look vanished in a peal of silvery laughter. \"Did I  really, Granny?\" she asked in delight. \"Did I break every bottle?  Are you sure? Every one?\"    \"Iv'ry wan as sure as OI'm a living sinner,\" said Granny. \"Faith and  'twas the bad little gyurl that you was often--now that I sthop to  t'ink av ut.\"    Maida bounded back to the shop in high spirits. Granny heard her say  \"Every bottle!\" again and again in a whispering little voice.    \"Just think, Granny,\" she called after a while. \"I've made one, two,  three, four, five friends--Dicky, Molly, Tim, Betsy and Laura--though  I don't call her quite a friend yet. Pretty good for so soon!\"    Maida was to make a sixth friend, although not quite so quickly.    It began that noontime with a strange little scene that acted itself  out in front of Maida's window. The children had begun to gather for  school, although it was still very quiet. Suddenly around the corner  came a wild hullaballoo--the shouts of small boys, the yelp of a dog,  the rattle and clang of tin dragged on the brick sidewalk. In  another instant appeared a dog, a small, yellow cur, collarless and  forlorn-looking, with a string of tin cans tied to his tail, a horde  of small boys yelling after him and pelting him with stones.    Maida started up, but before she could get to the door, something  flashed like a scarlet comet from across the street. It was the  little girl whom Maida had seen twice before--the one who always wore  the scarlet cape.    Even in the excitement, Maida noticed how handsome she was. She  seemed proud. She carried her slender, erect little body as if she  were a princess and her big eyes cast flashing glances about her.  Jet-black were her eyes and hair, milk-white were her teeth but in  the olive of her cheeks flamed a red such as could be matched only  in the deepest roses. Maida christened her Rose-Red at once.    Rose-Red lifted the little dog into her arms with a single swoop of  her strong arm. She yanked the cans from its tail with a single  indignant jerk. Fondling the trembling creature against her cheek,  she talked first to him, then to his abashed persecutors.    \"You sweet, little, darling puppy, you! Did they tie the wicked cans  to his poor little tail!\" and then--\"if ever I catch one of you boys  treating a poor, helpless animal like this again, I'll shake the  breath out of your body--was he the beautifullest dog that ever was?  And if that isn't enough, Arthur Duncan will lick you all, won't  you, Arthur?\" She turned pleadingly to Arthur.    Arthur nodded.    \"Nobody's going to hurt helpless creatures"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17546"],[0,"The Lion of Saint Mark: A Story of Venice in the Fourteenth Century (#8)"],[1,"party who were trying to  board her from the other craft, but their resistance was well nigh over  by the time Francis brought his gondola alongside.    One of the retainers had fallen with a sword thrust through his body,  and a gondolier had been knocked overboard by a blow from an oar. The  two girls were standing up screaming, and the surviving retainer was  being borne backwards by three or four armed men, who were slashing  furiously at him.    \"Quick, ladies, jump into my boat!\" Francis exclaimed as he came  alongside, and, leaning over, he dragged them one after the other into  his boat, just as their last defender fell.    With a fierce oath the leader of the assailants was about to spring  into the gondola, when Francis, snatching up his oar, smote him with  all his strength on the head as he was in the act of springing, and he  fell with a heavy splash into the water between the boats.    A shout of alarm and rage rose from his followers, but the gondolas  were now separated, and in another moment that of Francis was flying  along the canal at the top of its speed.    \"Calm yourselves, ladies,\" Francis said. \"There is no fear of pursuit.  They will stop to pick up the man I knocked into the canal, and by the  time they get him on board we shall be out of their reach.\"    \"What will become of the signora?\" the eldest girl asked, when they  recovered a little from their agitation.    \"No harm will befall her, you may be sure,\" Francis said. \"It was  evidently an attempt to carry you off, and now that you have escaped  they will care nothing for your duenna. She seemed to have lost her  head altogether, for as I lifted you into the boat she clung so fast to  your garments that I fancy a portion of them were left in her grasp.\"    \"Do you know where to take us? I see you are going in the right  direction?\" the girl asked.    \"To the Palazzo Polani,\" Francis said. \"I have the honour of being a  friend of your cousin, Matteo Giustiniani, and being with him one day  when you passed in your gondola, he named you to me.\"    \"A friend of Matteo!\" the girl repeated in surprise. \"Pardon me,  signor, I thought you were two passing gondoliers. It was so dark that  I could not recognize you; and, you see, it is so unusual to see a  gentleman rowing.\"    \"I am English, signora, and we are fond of strong exercise, and so  after nightfall, when it cannot shock my friends, I often take an oar  myself.\"    \"I thank you, sir, with all my heart, for my sister and myself, for the  service you have rendered us. I can hardly understand what has passed,  even now it seems like a dream. We were going quietly along home, when  a large dark gondola dashed out from one of the side canals, and nearly  ran us down. Our gondolier shouted to warn them, but they ran  alongside, and then some men jumped on board, and there was a terrible  fight, and every moment I expected that the gondola would have been  upset. Beppo was knocked overboard, and I saw old Nicolini fall; and  then, just as it seemed all over, you appeared suddenly by our side,  and dragged us on board this boat before I had time to think.\"    \"I am afraid I was rather rough, signora, but there was no time to  stand on ceremony. Here is the palazzo.\"    The boat was brought up by the side of the steps. Francis leapt ashore  and rang the bell, and then assisted the girls to land. In a minute the  door was thrown open, and two servitors with torches appeared. There  was an exclamation of astonishment as they saw the young ladies alone  with a strange attendant.    \"I will do myself the honour of calling tomorrow to inquire if you are  any the worse for your adventure, signora.\"    \"No, indeed,\" the eldest girl said. \"You must come up with us and see  our father. We must tell him what has happened; and he will be angry  indeed, did we suffer our rescuer to depart without his having an  opportunity of thanking him.\"    Francis bowed and followed the girls upstairs. They entered a large,  very handsomely furnished apartment where a tall man was sitting  reading.    \"Why, girls,\" he exclaimed as he rose, \"what has happened? you look  strangely excited. Where is your duenna? and who is this young  gentleman who accompanies you?\"    \"We have been attacked, father, on our way home,\" both the girls  exclaimed.    \"Attacked?\" Signor Polani repeated. \"Who has dared to venture on such  an outrage?\"    \"We don't know, father,\" Maria said. \"It was a four-oared gondola that  ran suddenly into us. We thought it was an accident till a number of  men, with their swords drawn, leaped on board. Then Nicolini and  Francia drew their swords and tried to defend us, and Beppo and Jacopo  both fought bravely too with their oars; but Beppo was knocked  overboard, and I am afraid Nicolini and Francia are killed, and in  another moment they would have got at us, when this young gentleman  came alongside in his gondola, and dragged us on board, for we were too  bewildered and frightened to do anything. One of them--he seemed the  leader of the party--tried to jump on board, but our protector struck  him a terrible blow with his oar, and he fell into the water, and then  the gondola made off, and, so far as we could see, they did not chase  us.\"    \"It is a scandalous outrage, and I will demand justice at the hands of  the council.    \"Young sir, you have laid me under an obligation I shall never forget.  You have saved my daughter from the worst calamity that could befall  her. Who is it to whom I am thus indebted?\"    \"My name is Francis Hammond. My father is an English merchant who has,  for the last four years, established himself here.\"    \"I know him well by repute,\" Polani said. \"I trust I shall know more of  him in the future.    \"But where is your duenna, girls?\"    \"She remained behind in the gondola, father; she seemed too frightened  to move.\"    \"The lady seemed to have lost her head altogether,\" Francis said. \"As I  was lifting your daughters into my gondola, in a very hasty and  unceremonious way--for the resistance of your servitors was all but  overcome, and there was no time to be lost--she held so tightly to  their robes that they were rent in her hands.\"    Signor Polani struck a gong.    \"Let a gondola be manned instantly,\" he said, \"and let six of you take  arms and go in search of our boat. Let another man at once summon a  leech, for some of those on board are, I fear, grievously wounded, if  not killed.\"    But there was no occasion to carry out the order concerning the boat,  for before it was ready to start the missing gondola arrived at the  steps, rowed by the remaining gondolier. The duenna was lifted out  sobbing hysterically, and the bodies of the two retainers were then  landed. One was dead; the other expired a few minutes after being  brought ashore.    \"You did not observe anything particular about the gondola, Maria, or  you, Giulia?\"    \"No, father, I saw no mark or escutcheon upon it, though they might  have been there without my noticing them. I was too frightened to see  anything; it came so suddenly upon us.\"    \"It was, as far as I noticed, a plain black gondola,\" Francis said.  \"The men concerned in the affair were all dressed in dark clothes,  without any distinguishing badges.\"    \"How was it you came to interfere in the fray, young gentleman? Few of  our people would have done so, holding it to be a dangerous thing, for  a man to mix himself up in a quarrel in which he had no concern.\"    \"I should probably have mixed myself up in it, in any case, when I  heard the cry of women,\" Francis replied; \"but, in truth, I recognized  the signoras as their gondola passed mine, and knew them to be cousins  of my friend Matteo Giustiniani. Therefore when I heard the outcry  ahead, I naturally hastened up to do what I could in the matter.\"    \"And well you did it,\" Polani said heartily. \"I trust that the man you  felled into the water is he who is the author of this outrage. I do not  think I need seek far for him. My suspicions point very strongly in one  direction, and tomorrow I will lay the matter before the council and  demand reparation.\"    \"And now, signor, if you will permit me I will take my leave,\" Francis  said. \"The hour is late, and the signoras will require rest after their  fright and emotion.\"    \"I will see you tomorrow, sir. I shall do myself the honour of calling  early upon your father, to thank him for the great service you have  rendered me.\"    Signor Polani accompanied Francis to the steps, while two servants held  torches while he took his seat in the gondola, and remained standing  there until the barque had shot away beyond the circle of light.    \"We seem fated to have adventures, Giuseppi.\"    \"We do indeed, Messer Francisco, and this is more to my liking than the  last. We arrived just at the nick of time; another half minute and  those young ladies would have been carried off. That was a rare blow  you dealt their leader. I fancy he never came up again, and that that  is why we got away without being chased.\"    \"I am of that opinion myself, Giuseppi.\"    \"If that is the case we shall not have heard the last of it, Messer  Francisco. Only someone of a powerful family would venture upon so bold  a deed, as to try to carry off ladies of birth on the Grand Canal, and  you may find that this adventure has created for you enemies not to be  despised.\"    \"I can't help it if it has,\" Francis said carelessly. \"On the other  hand, it will gain for me an influential friend in Signor Polani, who  is not only one of the richest merchants of Venice, but closely related  to a number of the best families of the city.\"    \"His influence will not protect you against the point of a dagger,\"  Giuseppi said. \"Your share in this business cannot but become public,  and I think that it would be wise to give up our evening excursions at  present.\"    \"I don't agree with you, Giuseppi. We don't go about with torches  burning, so no one who meets us is"]]]
