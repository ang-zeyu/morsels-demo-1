The dualism of Buto and Hierakonpolis really lasted throughout  Egyptian history. The king was always called \"Lord of the Two Lands,\"  and wore the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt; the snakes of Buto and  Nekhebet (the goddess of Nekheb, opposite Nekhen or Hierakonpolis)  always typified the united kingdom. This dualism of course often led to  actual division and reversion to the predynastic order of things, as,  for instance, in the time of the XXIst Dynasty.    It might well seem that both the impulses to culture development in the  North and South came from Semitic inspiration, and that it was to  the Semitic invaders in North and South that the founding of the two  kingdoms was due. This may be true to some extent, but it is at the same  time very probable that the first development of political culture at  Hierakonpolis was really of pre-Semitic origin. The kingdom of Buto,  since its capital is situated so near to the seacoast, may have owed  its origin to oversea Mediterranean connections. There is much in  the political constitution of later Egypt which seems to have been of  indigenous and pre-Semitic origin. Especially does this seem to be so in  the case of the division and organization of the country into nomes. It  is obvious that so soon as agriculture began to be practised on a large  scale, boundaries would be formed, and in the unique conditions of  Egypt, where all boundaries disappear beneath the inundation every  year, it is evident that the fixing of division-lines as permanently as  possible by means of landmarks was early essayed. We can therefore with  confidence assign the formation of the nomes to very early times. Now  the names of the nomes and the symbols or emblems by which they were  distinguished are of very great interest in this connection. They are  nearly all figures of the magic animals of the primitive religion, and  fetish-emblems of the older deities. The names are, in fact, those of  the territories of the Neolithic Egyptian tribes, and their emblems are  those of the protecting tribal demons. The political divisions of the  country seem, then, to be of extremely ancient origin, and if the nomes  go back to a time before the Semitic invasions, so may also the kingdoms  of the South and North.    Of these predynastic kingdoms we know very little, except from legendary  sources. The Northerners who were conquered by Aha, Narmer, and  Khasekhehiui do not look very much like Egyptians, but rather resemble  Semites or Libyans. On the \"Stele of Palermo,\" a chronicle of early  kings inscribed in the period of the Vth Dynasty, we have a list of  early kings of the North,--Seka, Desau, Tiu, Tesh, Nihab, Uatjantj,  Mekhe. The names are primitive in form. We know nothing more about them.  Last year Mr. C. T. Currelly attempted to excavate at Buto, in order to  find traces of the predynastic kingdom, but owing to the infiltration of  water his efforts were unsuccessful. It is improbable that anything is  now left of the most ancient period at that site, as the conditions in  the Delta are so very different from those obtaining in Upper Egypt.  There, at Hierakonpolis, and at el-Kab on the opposite bank of the Nile,  the sites of the ancient cities Nekhen and Nekheb, the excavators have  been very successful. The work was carried out by Messrs. Quibell and  Green, in the years 1891-9. Prehistoric burials were found on the hills  near by, but the larger portion of the antiquities were recovered from  the temple-ruins, and date back to the beginning of the 1st Dynasty,  exactly the time when the kings of Hierakonpolis first conquered the  kingdom of Buto and founded the united Egyptian monarchy.    The ancient temple, which was probably one of the earliest seats of  Egyptian civilization, was situated on a mound, now known as _el-Kom  el-ahmar_, \"the Red Hill,\" from its colour. The chief feature of the  most ancient temple seems to have been a circular mound, revetted by a  wall of sandstone blocks, which was apparently erected about the end of  the predynastic period. Upon this a shrine was probably erected. This  was the ancient shrine of Nekhen, the cradle of the Egyptian monarchy.  Close by it were found some of the most valuable relics of the earliest  Pharaonic age, the great ceremonial mace-heads and vases of Narmer and  \"the Scorpion,\" the shields or \"palettes\" of the same Narmer, the vases  and stelas of Khasekhemui, and, of later date, the splendid copper  colossal group of King Pepi I and his son, which is now at Cairo. Most  of the 1st Dynasty objects are preserved in the Ashmo-lean Museum at  Oxford, which is one of the best centres for the study of early Egyptian  antiquities. Narmer and Khasekhemui are, as we shall see, two of the  first monarchs of all Egypt. These sculptured and inscribed mace-heads,  shields, etc., are monuments dedicated by them in the ancestral shrine  at Hierakonpolis as records of their deeds. Both kings seem to have  waged war against the Northerners, the _Anu_ of Heliopolis and the  Delta, and on these votive monuments from Hierakonpolis we find  hieroglyphed records of the defeat of the _Anu_, who have very  definitely Semitic physiognomies.    On one shield or palette we see Narmer clubbing a man of Semitic  appearance, who is called the \"Only One of the Marsh\" (Delta), while  below two other Semites fly, seeking \"fortress-protection.\" Above is a  figure of a hawk, symbolizing the Upper Egyptian king, holding a rope  which is passed through the nose of a Semitic head, while behind is a  sign which may be read as \"the North,\" so that the whole symbolizes the  leading away of the North into captivity by the king of the South. It  is significant, in view of what has been said above with regard to the  probable Semitic origin of the Heliopolitan Northerners, to find the  people typical of the North-land represented by the Southerners as  Semites. Equally Semitic is the overthrown Northerner on the other  side of this well-known monument which we are describing; he is being  trampled under the hoofs and gored by the horns of a bull, who, like the  hawk, symbolizes the king. The royal bull has broken down the wall of a  fortified enclosure, in which is the hut or tent of the Semite, and the  bricks lie about promiscuously.    In connection with the Semitic origin of the Northerners, the form of  the fortified enclosures on both sides of this monument (that to whose  protection the two Semites on one side fly, and that out of which the  kingly bull has dragged the chief on the other) is noticeable. As usual  in Egyptian writing, the hieroglyph of these buildings takes the form of  a plan. The plan shows a crenelated enclosure, resembling the walls of  a great Babylonian palace or temple, such as have been found at Telloh,  Warka, or Mukayyar. The same design is found in Egypt at the Shuret  ez-Zebib, an Old Kingdom fortress at Abydos, in the tomb of King Aha at  Nakada, and in many walls of mastaba-tombs of the early time. This is  another argument in favour of an early connection between Egypt and  Babylonia. We illustrate a fragment of another votive shield or palette  of the same kind, now in the museum of the Louvre, which probably came  originally from Hierakonpolis. It is of exactly similar workmanship to  that of Narmer, and is no doubt a fragment of another monument of that  king. On it we see the same subject of the overthrowing of a Northerner  (of Semitic aspect) by the royal bull. On one side, below, is a  fortified enclosure with crenelated walls of the type we have described,  and within it a lion and a vase; below this another fort, and a bird  within it. These signs may express the names of the two forts, but,  owing to the fact that at this early period Egyptian orthography was  not yet fixed, we cannot read them. On the other side we see a row of  animated nome-standards of Upper Egypt, with the symbols of the god Min  of Koptos, the hawk of Horus of Edfu, the ibis of Thot of Eshmunen, and  the jackals of Anubis of Abydos, which drag a rope; had we the rest  of the monument, we should see, bound at the end of the rope, some  prisoner, king, or animal symbolic of the North. On another slate  shield, which we also reproduce, we see a symbolical representation of  the capture of seven Northern cities, whose names seem to mean the \"Two  Men,\" the \"Heron,\" the \"Owl,\" the \"Palm,\" and the \"Ghost\" Cities.    \"Ghost City\" is attacked by a lion, \"Owl City\" by a hawk, \"Palm City\" by  two hawk nome-standards, and another, whose name we cannot guess at, is  being opened up by a scorpion.    [Illustration: 050.jpg (left) OBVERSE OF A SLATE RELIEF.]    The operating animals evidently represent nomes and tribes of the Upper  Egyptians. Here again we see the same crenelated walls of the Northern  towns, and there is no doubt that this slate fragment also, which is  preserved in the Cairo Museum, is a monument of the conquests of Narmer.  It is executed in the same archaic style as those from Hierakonpolis.  The animals on the other side no doubt represent part of the spoil of  the North.    Returning to the great shield or palette found by Mr. Quibell, we see  the king coming out, followed by his sandal-bearer, the _Hen-neter_ or  \"God's Servant,\"* to view the dead bodies of the slain Northerners which  lie arranged in rows, decapitated, and with their heads between their  feet. The king is preceded by a procession of nome-standards.    [Illustration: 051.jpg (right)]    Above the dead men are symbolic representations of a hawk perched on a  harpoon over a boat, and a hawk and a door, which doubtless again refer  to the fights of the royal hawk of Upper Egypt on the Nile and at the  gate of the North. The designs on the mace-heads refer to the same  conquest of the North.

We have first the  people who immediately surrounded the Pharaoh,** the retainers of  the palace and of the harem, whose highly complex degrees of rank are  revealed to us on the monuments.*** His person was, as it were, minutely  subdivided into departments, each requiring its attendants and their  appointed chiefs.         * The song of the harp-player on the tomb of King Antuf       contains an allusion to these ruined palaces: \"The gods       [kings] who were of yore, and who repose in their tombs,       mummies and manes, all buried alike in their pyramids, when       castles are built they no longer have a place in them; see,       thus it is done with them! I have heard the poems in praise       of Imhotpu and of Hardidif which are sung in the songs, and       yet, see, where are their places to-day? their walls are       destroyed, their places no more, as though they have never       existed!\"         ** They are designated by the general terms of Shonitiu, the       \"people of the circle,\" and Qonbitiu, the \"people of the       corner.\" These words are found in religious inscriptions       referring to the staff of the temples, and denote the       attendants or court of each god; they are used to       distinguish the notables of a town or borough, the sheikhs,       who enjoyed the right to superintend local administration       and dispense justice.         *** The Egyptian scribes had endeavoured to draw up an       hierarchical list of these offices. At present we possess       the remains of two lists of this description. One of these,       preserved in the \"Hood Papyrus\" in the British Museum, has       been published and translated by Maspero, in _Etudes       Egyptiennes,_ vol. ii. pp. 1-66; another and more complete       copy, discovered in 1890, is in the possession of M.       Golenischeff. The other list, also in the British Museum,       was published by Prof. Petrie in a memoir of _The Egypt       Exploration Fund _; in this latter the names and titles are       intermingled with various other matter. To these two works       may be added the lists of professions and trades to be found       _passim_ on the monuments, and which have been commented on       by Brugsch.    His toilet alone gave employment to a score of different trades. There  were royal barbers, who had the privilege of shaving his head and chin;  hairdressers who made, curled, and put on his black or blue wigs and  adjusted the diadems to them; there were manicurists who pared and  polished his nails, perfumers who prepared the scented oils and pomades  for the anointing of his body, the kohl for blackening his eyelids, the  _rouge_ for spreading on his lips and cheeks. His wardrobe required a  whole troop of shoemakers, belt-makers, and tailors, some of whom had  the care of stuffs in the piece, others presided over the body-linen,  while others took charge of his garments, comprising long or short,  transparent or thick petticoats, fitting tightly to the hips or cut with  ample fulness, draped mantles and flowing pelisses. Side by side  with these officials, the laundresses plied their trade, which was an  important one among a people devoted to white, and in whose estimation  want of cleanliness in dress entailed religious impurity. Like the  fellahin of the present time, they took their linen daily to wash in  the river; they rinsed, starched, smoothed, and pleated it without  intermission to supply the incessant demands of Pharaoh and his family.*         * The \"royal laundrymen\" and their chiefs are mentioned in       the Conte des deux freres under the XIXth dynasty, as well       as their laundries on the banks of the Nile.      [Illustration: 051.jpg MEN AND WOMEN SINGERS, FLUTE-PLAYERS, HARPISTS,  AND DANCERS, FROM THE TOMB OF TI]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin from a squeeze taken at Saqqara in       1878 by Mariette    The task of those set over the jewels was no easy one, when we consider  the enormous variety of necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings, and  sceptres of rich workmanship which ceremonial costume required for  particular times and occasions. The guardianship of the crowns almost  approached to the dignity of the priesthood; for was not the uraeus,  which ornamented each one, a living goddess? The queen required numerous  waiting-women, and the same ample number of attendants were to be  encountered in the establishments of the other ladies of the harem.  Troops of musicians, singers, dancers, and almehs whiled away the  tedious hours, supplemented by buffoons and dwarfs. The great Egyptian  lords evinced a curious liking for these unfortunate beings, and amused  themselves by getting together the ugliest and most deformed creatures.  They are often represented on the tombs beside their masters in company  with his pet dog, or a gazelle, or with a monkey which they sometimes  hold in leash, or sometimes are engaged in teasing. Sometimes the  Pharaoh bestowed his friendship on his dwarfs, and confided to  them occupations in his household. One of them, Khnumhotpu, died  superintendent of the royal linen. The staff of servants required for  supplying the table exceeded all the others in number. It could scarcely  be otherwise if we consider that the master had to provide food, not  only for his regular servants,* but for all those of his _employes_ and  subjects whose business brought them to the royal residence: even those  poor wretches who came to complain to him of some more or less imaginary  grievance were fed at his expense while awaiting his judicial verdict.  Head-cooks, butlers, pantlers, pastrycooks, fishmongers, game or fruit  dealers--if all enumerated, would be endless. The bakers who baked the  ordinary bread were not to be confounded with those who manufactured  biscuits. The makers of pancakes and dough-nuts took precedence of the  cake-bakers, and those who concocted delicate fruit preserves ranked  higher than the common dryer of dates.         * Even after death they remained inscribed on the registers       of the palace, and had rations served out to them every day       as funeral offerings.    [Illustration: 052.jpg THE DWARF KHNUMHOTPU, SUPERINTENDENT OF THE ROYAL  LINEN]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-       Bey; the original is at Gizeh    If one had held a post in the royal household, however low the  occupation, it was something to be proud of all one's life, and after  death to boast of in one's epitaph. The chiefs to whom this army of  servants rendered obedience at times rose from the ranks; on some  occasion their master had noticed them in the crowd, and had transferred  them, some by a single promotion, others by slow degrees, to the  highest offices of the state. Many among them, however, belonged to  old families, and held positions in the palace which their fathers  and grandfathers had occupied before them, some were members of the  provincial nobility, distant descendants of former royal princes and  princesses, more or less nearly related to the reigning sovereign.*         * It was the former who, I believe, formed the class of       _rokhu suton_ so often mentioned on the monuments. This       title is generally supposed to have been a mark of       relationship with the royal family. M. de Rouge proved long       ago that this was not so, and that functionaries might bear       this title even though they were not blood relations of the       Pharaohs. It seems to me to have been used to indicate a       class of courtiers whom the king condescended to \"know\"       (_rokhu_) directly, without the intermediary of a       chamberlain, the \"persons known by the king;\" the others       were only his \"friends\" (samiru).    They had been sought out to be the companions of his education and of  his pastimes, while he was still living an obscure life in the \"House  of the Children;\" he had grown up with them and had kept them about his  person as his \"sole friends\" and counsellors. He lavished titles and  offices upon them by the dozen, according to the confidence he felt in  their capacity or to the amount of faithfulness with which he credited  them. A few of the most favoured were called \"Masters of the Secret of  the Royal House;\" they knew all the innermost recesses of the palace,  all the passwords needed in going from one part of it to another, the  place where the royal treasures were kept, and the modes of access to  it. Several of them were \"Masters of the Secret of all the Royal Words,\"  and had authority over the high courtiers of the palace, which gave  them the power of banishing whom they pleased from the person of the  sovereign. Upon others devolved the task of arranging his amusements;  they rejoiced the heart of his Majesty by pleasant songs, while the  chiefs of the sailors and soldiers kept watch over his safety. To these  active services were attached honorary privileges which were highly  esteemed, such as the right to retain their sandals in the palace, while  the general crowd of courtiers could only enter unshod; that of kissing  the knees and not the feet of the \"good god,\" and that of wearing the  panther's skin. Among those who enjoyed these distinctions were the  physicians of the king, chaplains, and men of the roll--\"khri-habi.\"  The latter did not confine themselves to the task of guiding Pharaoh  through the intricacies of ritual, nor to that of prompting him with the  necessary formulas needed to make the sacrifice efficacious; they were  styled \"Masters of the Secrets of Heaven,\" those who see what is in the  firmament, on the earth and in Hades, those who know all the charms  of the soothsayers, prophets, or magicians.
