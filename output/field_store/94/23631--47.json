After this the German  offensive began, with the French coast ports as the objective, but this  movement, like those of the Allies, met with failure.    The Field Marshal, doubtless in response to the demands of the British  public, tells what the various units of the expeditionary force have  been doing--those that failed and were cut off and those who against  superior numbers held the trenches for a month. He gives it as his  opinion that the German losses have been thrice as great as those of the  Allies, and speaks optimistically of the future.    The report covers in a general way the activities of the British troops  from Oct. 11 to Nov. 20.    Summing up the situation in concluding his report, the Field Marshal  says:    \"As I close this dispatch, signs are in evidence that we are possibly in  the last stages of the battle from Ypres to Armentieres. For several  days past the artillery fire of the enemy has slackened considerably,  and his infantry attacks have practically ceased.\"    Discussing the general military situation of the Allies, as it appears  to him at the time of writing, Sir John says:    \"It does not seem to be clearly understood that the operations in which  we have been engaged embrace nearly all of the central part of the  Continent of Europe, from the east to the west. The combined French,  Belgian, and British Armies in the west and the Russian Army in the east  are opposed to the united forces of Germany and Austria, acting as  combined armies between us.    \"Our enemies elected at the commencement of the war to throw the weight  of their forces against our armies in the west and to detach only a  comparatively weak force, composed of very few of the first line troops  and several corps of second and third line troops, to stem the Russian  advance until the western forces could be defeated and overwhelmed.  Their strength enabled them from the outset to throw greatly superior  forces against us in the west. This precludes the possibility of our  taking vigorous offensive action except when miscalculations and  mistakes are made by their commanders, opening up special opportunities  for successful attacks and pursuit.    \"The battle of the Marne was an example of this, as was also our advance  from St. Omer and Hazebrouck to the line of the River Lys at the  commencement of this battle. The role which our armies in the west have  consequently been called upon to fulfill has been to occupy strong  defensive positions, holding ground gained and inviting the enemy's  attack, and to throw back these attacks, causing the enemy heavy losses  in his retreat and following him up with powerful and successful  counter-attacks to complete his discomfiture.    \"The value and significance of operations of this nature since the  commencement of hostilities by the Allies' forces in the west lie in the  fact that at the moment when the eastern provinces of Germany are in  imminent danger of being overrun by the numerous and powerful armies of  Russia, nearly the whole active army of Germany is tied down to a line  of trenches extending from Verdun, on the Alsatian frontier, to the sea  at Nieuport, east of Dunkirk, a distance of 260 miles, where they are  held, with much reduced numbers and impaired morale, by the successful  action of our troops in the west.    \"I cannot speak too highly of the services rendered by the Royal  Artillery throughout the battle. In spite of the fact that the enemy  brought up in support of his attacks guns of great range and shell  power, our men have succeeded throughout in preventing the enemy from  establishing anything in the nature of superiority in artillery. The  skill, courage, and energy displayed by the commanders of the Royal  Artillery have been very marked. The Royal Engineers have been  indefatigable in their efforts to assist the infantry in field,  fortification, and trench work.    \"I deeply regret the heavy casualties which we have suffered, but the  nature of the fighting has been very desperate, and we have been  assailed by vastly superior numbers. I have every reason to know that  throughout the course of the battle we have placed at least three times  as many of the enemy hors de combat in dead, wounded and prisoners.    \"Throughout these operations Gen. Foch has strained his resources to the  utmost to afford me all the support he could. An expression of my warm  gratitude is also due to Gen. Dubail, commanding the Eighth French Army  Corps on my left, and to Gen. de Maud'huy, commanding the Tenth Army  Corps on my right.\"    Discussing the details of the engagement from Ypres to Armentieres,  Field Marshal Sir John French explains that he was impressed early in  October with the necessity of giving the greatest possible support to  the northern flank of the Allies in the effort to outflank the Germans  and compel them to evacuate their positions. He says that the situation  on the Aisne warranted the withdrawal of British troops from positions  they held there, as the enemy had been weakened by continual attacks and  the fortifications of the Allies much improved.    The Field Marshal made known his view to Gen. Joffre, who agreed with  it. The French General Staff arranged for the withdrawal of the British,  which began on Oct. 3 and was completed on Oct. 19, when the First Army  Corps, under Gen. Sir Douglas Haig detrained at St. Omer.    The general plan, as arranged by Field Marshal French and Gen. Foch,  commanding the French troops to the north of Noyon, was that the English  should pivot on the French at Bethune, attacking the Germans on their  flank and forcing their way north. In the event that the British forced  the Germans out of their positions, making possible a forward movement  of the Allies, the French and British were to march east, with Lille as  the dividing line between the two armies, the English right being  directed on Lille.    The battle which forms the chief feature of Gen. French's report really  began on Oct. 11, when Major Gen. Gough of the Second British Cavalry  Brigade, first came in contact with German cavalry in the woods along  the Bethune-Aire Canal. The English cavalry moved toward Hazebrouck,  clearing the way for two army corps, which advanced rapidly in a  northeasterly direction. For several days the progress of the British  was only slightly interrupted, except at La Bassee, a high position,  which Field Marshal French mentions as having stubbornly resisted.    Field Marshal French says the Second Corps, under Gen. Smith-Dorrien,  was opposed by overpowering forces of Germans, but nevertheless advanced  until Oct. 18, when the German opposition compelled a reinforcement. Six  days later the Lahore Division of the Indian army was sent to support  the Second Corps.    On Oct. 16 Sir Henry Rawlinson, who had covered the retreat of the  Belgian army from Antwerp with two divisions of English cavalry and two  divisions of French infantry, was stationed on the line east of Ypres  under orders to operate over a wide front and to keep possession of all  the ground held by the Allies until the First Army Corps could reach  Ypres.    Gen. Rawlinson was opposed by superior forces and was unable to prevent  the Germans from getting large reinforcements. With four army corps  holding a much wider front than their size justified, Field Marshal  French says he faced a stubborn situation. The enemy was massed from the  Lys, and there was imperative need for a strengthened line.    However, the Field Marshal decided to send the First Corps north of  Ypres to stop the reinforcements which might enable the Germans to flank  the Allies. The shattered Belgian army and the wearied French troops'  endeavors to check the German reinforcements were powerless, so the  British commander sent fresh troops to prevent the Germans from  executing movements which would have given them access to Channel ports.    Sir Douglas Haig, with the First Army Corps, was sent Oct. 19 to capture  Bruges and drive the enemy back toward Ghent, if possible. Meantime the  Belgians intrenched themselves along the Ypres Canal. Sir John French  commends the valor of the Belgians, who, he says, exhausted by weeks of  constant fighting, maintained these positions gallantly.    Because of the overwhelming numbers of the Germans opposing them, he  says he enjoined a defensive role upon the three army corps located  south of Ypres. While Gen. Haig made a slight advance, Sir John says it  was wonderful that he was able to advance at all, owing to the bad roads  and the overwhelming number of Germans, which made it impossible to  carry out the original plan of moving to Bruges.    The fighting gradually developed into bayonet charges. Field Marshal  French says that Oct. 21 brought forth the hardest attack, made on the  First Corps at Ypres, in the checking of which the Worcestershire  Regiment displayed great gallantry. This day marked the most critical  period in the great battle, according to the Commander in Chief, who  says the recapture of the village of Gheluvelt through a rally of the  Worcestershires was fraught with much consequence to the Allies.    After referring to some of the battles in which the Indian troops took  part, Field Marshal French says:    \"Since their arrival in this country and their occupation of the line  allotted to them I have been much impressed by the initiative and  resource displayed by the Indian troops. Some of the ruses they have  employed to deceive the enemy have been attended with the best results  and have doubtless kept the superior forces in front of them at bay. Our  Indian sappers and miners have long enjoyed a high reputation for skill  and resource. Without going into detail I can confidently assert that  throughout their work in this campaign they have fully justified that  reputation.    \"The General officer commanding the Indian army describes"]]]
