As we shall see, water charged with carbonic acid attacks certain  substances insoluble in pure water, and brings them into solution, and  thus the water soon becomes hard. About the close of the last lecture, I  said that lime is, to a certain extent, soluble in cold water. The  solution is called lime-water; it might be called a solution of caustic  lime. When carbonic acid gas first comes in contact with such a  solution, chalk or carbonate of lime, which is insoluble in water, is  formed, and the lime is thus precipitated as carbonate. Supposing,  however, we continued to pass carbonic acid gas into that water,  rendered milky with chalk powder, very soon the liquid would clear, and  we should get once more a solution of lime, but not caustic lime as it  was at first, simply now a solution of carbonate of lime in carbonic  acid, or a solution of bicarbonate of lime. I will take some lime-water,  and I will blow through; my breath contains carbonic acid, and you will  see the clear liquid become milky owing to separation of insoluble  carbonate of lime, or chalk. I now continue blowing, and at length that  chalk dissolves with the excess of carbonic acid, forming bicarbonate of  lime. This experiment explains how it is that water percolating through  or running over limestone strata dissolves out the insoluble chalk. Such  water, hard from dissolved carbonate of lime, can be softened by merely  boiling the water, for the excess of carbonic acid is then expelled, and  the chalk is precipitated again. This would be too costly for the  softening of large quantities of water, the boiling process consuming  too much coal, and so another process is adopted. Quicklime, or milk of  lime, is added to the water in the proper quantity. This lime unites  with the excess of carbonic acid holding chalk in solution, and forms  with it insoluble chalk, and so all deposits together as chalk. By this  liming process, also, the iron of the water dissolved likewise in  ferruginous streams, etc., by carbonic acid, would be precipitated. To  show this deposition I will now add some clear lime-water to the  solution I made of chalk with the carbonic acid of my breath, and a  precipitate is at once formed, all the lime and carbonic acid together  depositing as insoluble chalk. Hence clear lime-water forms a good test  for the presence of bicarbonates of lime or iron in a water. But water  may be hard from the presence of other salts, other lime salts. For  example, certain parts of the earth contain a great deal of gypsum, or  natural sulphate of lime, and this is soluble to some extent in water.  Water thus hardened is not affected by boiling, or the addition of lime,  and is therefore termed permanently hard water, the water hardened with  dissolved chalk being termed temporarily hard water. I have said nothing  of solid or undissolved impurities in water, which are said to be in  suspension, for the separation of these is a merely mechanical matter of  settling, or filtration and settling combined. As a general rule, the  water of rivers contains the most suspended and vegetable matter and the  least amount of dissolved constituents, whereas spring and well waters  contain the most dissolved matters and the least suspended. Serious  damage may be done to the dyer by either of these classes of impurities,  and I may tell you that the dissolved calcareous and magnesian  impurities are the most frequent in occurrence and the most injurious. I  told you that on boiling, the excess of carbonic acid holding chalk or  carbonate of lime in solution as bicarbonate, is decomposed and  carbonate of lime precipitated. You can at once imagine, then, what  takes place in your steam boilers when such water is used, and how  incrustations are formed. Let us now inquire as to the precise nature of  the waste and injury caused by hard and impure waters. Let us also take,  as an example, those most commonly occurring injurious constituents, the  magnesian and calcareous impurities. Hard water only produces a lather  with soap when that soap has effected the softening of the water, and  not till then. In that process the soap is entirely wasted, and the  fatty acids in it form, with the lime and magnesia, insoluble compounds  called lime and magnesia soaps, which are sticky, greasy, adhesive  bodies, that precipitate and fix some colouring matters like a mordant.  We have in such cases, then, a kind of double mischief--(i) waste of  soap, (ii) injury to colours and dyes on the fabrics. But this is not  all, for colours are precipitated as lakes, and mordants also are  precipitated, and thus wasted, in much the same sense as the soaps are.  Now by taking a soap solution, formed by dissolving a known weight of  soap in a known volume of water, and adding this gradually to hard water  until a permanent lather is just produced, we can directly determine the  consumption of soap by such a water, and ascertain the hardness. Such a  method is called Clark's process of determination or testing, or Clark's  soap test. We hear a great deal just now of soaps that will wash well in  hard water, and do wonders under any conditions; but mark this fact,  none of them will begin to perform effective duty until such hard water  has been rendered soft at the expense of the soap. Soaps made of some  oils, such as cocoa-nut oil, for example, are more soluble in water than  when made of tallow, etc., and so they more quickly soften a hard water  and yield lather, but they are wasted, as far as consumption is  concerned, to just the same extent as any other soaps. They do not,  however, waste so much time and trouble in effecting the end in view,  and, as you know, \"Time is money\" in these days of work and competition.  After making a soap test as described above, and knowing the quantity of  water used, it is, of course, easy to calculate the annual loss of soap  caused by the hardness of the water. The monthly consumption of soap in  London is 1,000,000 kilograms (about 1000 tons), and it is estimated  that the hardness of the Thames water means the use of 230,000 kilograms  (nearly 230 tons) more soap per month than would be necessary if soft  water were used. Of course the soap manufacturers around London would  not state that fact on their advertising placards, but rather dwell on  the victorious onslaught their particular brand will make on the dirt in  articles to be washed, in the teeth of circumstances that would be  hopeless for any other brand of soap! I have referred to the sticky and  adhesive character of the compounds called lime soaps, formed in hard  waters. Now in washing and scouring wool and other fibres, these sticky  lime soaps adhere so pertinaciously that the fibres, be they of wool,  silk, or any other article, remain in part untouched, impermeable to  mordant or colouring matter, and hence irregular development of colour  must be the consequence. Also an unnatural lustre or peculiar bloom may  in parts arise, ruining the appearance of the goods. In some cases the  lime soaps act like mordants, attracting colouring matter unequally, and  producing patchy effects. In the dye-baths in which catechu and tannin  are used, there is a waste of these matters, for insoluble compounds are  formed with the lime, and the catechu and tannin are, to a certain  extent, precipitated and lost. Some colours are best developed in an  acid bath, such as Cochineal Scarlet, but the presence of the  bicarbonate of lime tends to cause neutralisation of the acidity, and so  the dyeing is either retarded or prevented. Such mordants as \"red  liquor\" and \"iron liquor,\" which are acetates of alumina and iron  respectively, are also wasted, a portion of them being precipitated by  the lime, thus weakening the mordant baths.    _Ferruginous Impurities in Water._--Iron in solution in water is very  objectionable in dyeing operations. When the iron is present as  bicarbonate, it acts on soap solutions like the analogous lime and  magnesia compounds, producing even worse results. In wool scouring,  cotton bleaching, and other processes requiring the use of alkaline  carbonates, ferric oxide is precipitated on the fibre. A yellowish tinge  is communicated to bleached fabrics, and to dye bright and light colours  is rendered almost out of the question. You may always suspect iron to  be present in water flowing from or obtained directly out of old coal  pits, iron mines, or from places abounding in iron and aluminous shales.  Moreover, you sometimes, or rather generally, find that surface water  draining off moorland districts, and passing over ochre beds, contains  iron, and on its way deposits on the beds of the streamlets conveying  it, and on the stones, red or brown oxide of iron. All water of this  kind ought to be avoided in dyeing and similar operations. The iron in  water from old coal pits and shale deposits is usually present as  sulphate due to the oxidation of pyrites, a sulphuret or sulphide of  iron. Water from heaths and moorlands is often acid from certain  vegetable acids termed \"peaty acids.\" This acidity places the water in  the condition of a direct solvent for iron, and that dissolved iron may  cause great injury. If such water cannot be dispensed with, the best way  is to carefully neutralise it with carbonate of soda; the iron is then  precipitated as carbonate of iron, and can be removed.    _Contamination of Water by Factories._--You may have neighbours higher  up the stream than yourselves, and these firms may cast forth as waste  products substances which will cause immense waste and loss. Amongst  these waste products the worst are those coming from chemical works,  paper works, bleach works, etc. If the paper works be those working up  wood pulp, the pollutions of effluent water will be about as noxious as  they well can be.

He seems like a huge ox running wild.    The magnificent dark brown frontlet and beard of the buffalo, the shaggy  coat of hair upon the neck, hump, and shoulders, terminating at the  knees in a thick mass of luxuriant black locks, to say nothing of the  dense coat of finer fur on the body and hindquarters, give to our  species not only an apparent height equal to that of the gaur, but a  grandeur and nobility of presence which are beyond all comparison  amongst ruminants.    The slightly larger bulk of the gaur is of little significance in a  comparison of the two species; for if size alone is to turn the scale,  we must admit that a 500-pound lioness, with no mane whatever, is a more  majestic looking animal than a 450-pound lion, with a mane which has  earned him his title of king of beasts.    2. _Change of form in captivity._--By a combination of unfortunate  circumstances, the American bison is destined to go down to posterity  shorn of the honor which is his due, and appreciated at only half his  worth. The hunters who slew him were from the very beginning so absorbed  in the scramble for spoils that they had no time to measure or weigh  him, nor even to notice the majesty of his personal appearance on his  native heath.    In captivity he fails to develop as finely as in his wild state, and  with the loss of his liberty he becomes a tame-looking animal. He gets  fat and short-bodied, and the lack of vigorous and constant exercise  prevents the development of bone and muscle which made the prairie  animal what he was.    From observations made upon buffaloes that have been reared in  captivity, I am firmly convinced that confinement and  semi-domestication are destined to effect striking changes in the form  of _Bison americanus_. While this is to be expected to a certain extent  with most large species, the changes promise to be most conspicuous in  the buffalo. The most striking change is in the body between the hips  and the shoulders. As before remarked, it becomes astonishingly short  and rotund, and through liberal feeding and total lack of exercise the  muscles of the shoulders and hindquarters, especially the latter, are  but feebly developed.    The most striking example of the change of form in the captive buffalo  is the cow in the Central Park Menagerie, New York. Although this animal  is fully adult, and has given birth to three fine calves, she is small,  astonishingly short-bodied, and in comparison with the magnificently  developed cows taken in 1886 by the writer in Montana, she seems almost  like an animal of another species.    Both the live buffaloes in the National Museum collection of living  animals are developing the same shortness of body and lack of muscle,  and when they attain their full growth will but poorly resemble the  splendid proportions of the wild specimens in the Museum mounted group,  each of which has been mounted from a most careful and elaborate series  of post-mortem measurements. It may fairly be considered, however, that  the specimens taken by the Smithsonian expedition were in every way more  perfect representatives of the species than have been usually taken in  times past, for the simple reason that on account of the muscle they had  developed in the numerous chases they had survived, and the total  absence of the fat which once formed such a prominent feature of the  animal, they were of finer form, more active habit, and keener  intelligence than buffaloes possessed when they were so numerous. Out of  the millions which once composed the great northern herd, those  represented the survival of the fittest, and their existence at that  time was chiefly due to the keenness of their senses and their splendid  muscular powers in speed and endurance.    Under such conditions it is only natural that animals of the highest  class should be developed. On the other hand, captivity reverses all  these conditions, while yielding an equally abundant food supply.    In no feature is the change from natural conditions to captivity more  easily noticeable than in the eye. In the wild buffalo the eye is always  deeply set, well protected by the edge of the bony orbit, and perfect in  form and expression. The lids are firmly drawn around the ball, the  opening is so small that the white portion of the eyeball is entirely  covered, and the whole form and appearance of the organ is as shapely  and as pleasing in expression as the eye of a deer.    In the captive the various muscles which support and control the eyeball  seem to relax and thicken, and the ball protrudes far beyond its normal  plane, showing a circle of white all around the iris, and bulging out in  a most unnatural way. I do not mean to assert that this is common in  captive buffaloes generally, but I have observed it to be disagreeably  conspicuous in many.    Another change which takes place in the form of the captive buffalo is  an arching of the back in the middle, which has a tendency to make the  hump look lower at the shoulders and visibly alters the outline of the  back. This tendency to \"hump up\" the back is very noticeable in domestic  cattle and horses during rainy weather. While a buffalo on his native  heath would seldom assume such an attitude of dejection and misery, in  captivity, especially if it be anything like close confinement, it is  often to be observed, and I fear will eventually become a permanent  habit. Indeed, I think it may be confidently predicted that the time  will come when naturalists who have never seen a wild buffalo will  compare the specimens composing the National Museum group with the  living representatives to be seen in captivity and assert that the  former are exaggerations in both form and size.    3. _Mounted Specimens in Museums._--Of the \"stuffed\" specimens to be  found in museums, all that I have ever seen outside of the National  Museum and even those within that institution up to 1886, were \"stuffed\"  in reality as well as in name. The skins that have been rammed full of  straw or excelsior have lost from 8 to 12 inches in height at the  shoulders, and the high and sharp hump of the male has become a huge,  thick, rounded mass like the hump of a dromedary, and totally unlike the  hump of a bison. It is impossible for any taxidermist to stuff a  buffalo-skin with loose materials and produce a specimen which fitly  represents the species. The proper height and form of the animal can be  secured and retained only by the construction of a manikin, or statue,  to carry the skin. In view of this fact, which surely must be apparent  to even the most casual observer, it is to be earnestly hoped that here  no one in authority will ever consent to mount or have mounted a  valuable skin of a bison in any other way than over a properly  constructed manikin.    4. _The Calf._--The breeding season of the buffalo is from the 1st of  July to the 1st of October. The young cow does not breed until she is  three years old, and although two calves are sometimes produced at a  birth, one is the usual number. The calves are born in April, May, and  June, and sometimes, though rarely, as late as the middle of August. The  calf follows its mother until it is a year old, or even older. In May,  1886, the Smithsonian expedition captured a calf alive, which had been  abandoned by its mother because it could not keep up with her. The  little creature was apparently between two and three weeks old, and was  therefore born about May 1. Unlike the young of nearly all other  _Bovidæ_, the buffalo calf during the first months of its existence is  clad with hair of a totally different color from that which covers him  during the remainder of his life. His pelage is a luxuriant growth of  rather long, wavy hair, of a uniform brownish-yellow or \"sandy\" color  (cinnamon, or yellow ocher, with a shade of Indian yellow) all over the  head, body, and tail, in striking contrast with the darker colors of the  older animals. On the lower half of the leg it is lighter, shorter, and  straight. On the shoulders and hump the hair is longer than on the  other portions, being 11/2 inches in length, more wavy, and already  arranges itself in the tufts, or small bunches, so characteristic in the  adult animal.    On the extremity of the muzzle, including the chin, the hair is very  short, straight, and as light in color as the lower portions of the leg.  Starting on the top of the nose, an inch behind the nostrils, and  forming a division between the light yellowish muzzle and the more  reddish hair on the remainder of the head, there is an irregular band of  dark, straight hair, which extends down past the corner of the mouth to  a point just back of the chin, where it unites. From the chin backward  the dark band increases in breadth and intensity, and continues back  half way to the angle of the jaw. At that point begins a sort of under  mane of wavy, dark-brown hair, nearly 3 inches long, and extends back  along the median line of the throat to a point between the fore legs,  where it abruptly terminates. From the back of the head another streak  of dark hair extends backward along the top of the neck, over the hump,  and down to the lumbar region, where it fades out entirely. These two  dark bands are in sharp contrast to the light sandy hair adjoining.    The tail is densely haired. The tuft on the end is quite luxuriant, and  shows a center of darker hair. The hair on the inside of the ear is  dark, but that on the outside is sandy.    The naked portion of the nose is light Vandyke-brown, with a pinkish  tinge, and the edge of the eyelid the same. The iris is dark brown. The  horn at three months is about 1 inch in length, and is a mere little  black stub. In the male, the hump is clearly defined, but by no means so  high in proportion as in the adult animal. The hump of the calf from  which this description is drawn is of about the same relative angle and  height as"]]]
