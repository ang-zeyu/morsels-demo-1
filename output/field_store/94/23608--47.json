But even this was not enough to satisfy the lust of the Russian  censorship. It was now suspected that even the \"dependable\" rabbis might  pass many a book as \"harmless,\" though its contents were subversive of  the public weal. As a result, a new ukase was issued in 1841, placing  the rabbinical censors themselves under Government control. All  uncensored books, including those already passed as \"harmless,\" were  ordered to be taken away from the private libraries and forwarded to the  censorship committees in Vilna and Kiev. The latter were instructed to  attach their seals to the approved books and \"deliver to the flames\" the  books condemned by them. Endless wagonloads of these confiscated books  could be seen moving towards Vilna and Kiev, and for many years  afterwards the literature of the \"People of the Book,\" covering a period  of three milleniums, was still languishing in the gaol of censorship,  waiting to be saved from or to be sentenced to a fiery death by a  Russian official.    It is almost unnecessary to add that the primitive method of solving the  Jewish problem by means of conversion, was still the guiding principle  of the Government. The Russian legislation of that period teems with  regulations concerning apostasy. The surrender of the Synagogue to the  Church seemed merely a question of time. In reality, however, the  Government itself believed but half-heartedly in the sincerity of the  converted Jews. In 1827 the Tzar put down in his own handwriting the  following resolution: \"It is to be strictly observed that the baptismal  ceremony shall take place unconditionally on a Sunday, and with all  possible publicity, so as to remove all suspicion of a pretended  adoption of Christianity.\" Subsequently, this watchfulness had to be  relaxed in the case of those \"who avoid publicity in adopting  Christianity,\" more especially in the case of the cantonists, \"who have  declared their willingness to embrace the orthodox faith\"--under the  effect, we may add, of the tortures in the barracks. Sincerity under  these circumstances was out of the question, and, in 1831, the battalion  chaplains were authorized to baptize these helpless creatures, even  \"without applying for permission to the ecclesiastical authorities.\"    The barrack missionaries were frequently successful among these  unfortunate military prisoners. In the imperial rescripts of that period  the characteristic expression \"privates from among the Jews _remaining  in the above faith_\" figures as a standing designation for that group of  refractory and incorrigible soldiers who disturbed the officially  pre-established harmony of epidemic conversions by remaining loyal to  Judaism. But among the \"civilian\" Jews, who had not been detached from  their Jewish environment, apostasy was extraordinarily rare, and law  after law was promulgated in vain, offering privileges to converts or  leniency to criminals who were ready to embrace the orthodox creed. [1]    [Footnote 1: Under Clause 157 of the Russian Penal Code of 1845, the  penalty of the law was softened, not only in degree but also in kind,  for those criminals who had embraced the Greek-Orthodox faith during the  investigation or trial.]          CHAPTER XIV      COMPULSORY ENLIGHTENMENT AND INCREASED OPPRESSION    1. ENLIGHTENMENT AS A MEANS OF ASSIMILATION    There was a brief moment of respite when, in the phrase of the Russian  poet, \"the fighter's hand was tired of killing.\" The Russian Government  suddenly felt the need of passing over from the medieval forms of  patronage to more enlightened and perfected methods. Among the leading  statesmen of Russia were men, such as the Minister of Public  Instruction, Sergius Uvarov, who were well acquainted with Western  European ways and fully aware of the fact that the reactionary  governments of Austria and Prussia had invented several contrivances for  handling the Jewish problem which might be usefully applied in their own  country. Though anxious to avoid all contact with the \"rotten West,\" and  being in constant fear of European political movements, the Russian  Government was nevertheless ready to seize upon the relics of  \"enlightened absolutism\" which were still stalking about, particularly  in Austria, in the early decades of the nineteenth century. As far as  Prussia was concerned, the abundance of assimilated and converted Jews  in that country and their attempts at religious reform, which to a  missionary's imagination were identical with a change of front in favor  of Christianity, had a fascination of its own for the Russian  dignitaries. No wonder then that the Government yielded to the  temptation to use some of the contrivances of Western European reaction,  while holding in reserve the police knout of genuine Russian  manufacture.    In 1840 the Council of State was again busy discussing the Jewish  question, this time from a theoretic point of view. The reports of the  provincial administrators, in particular that of Bibikov,  governor-general of Kiev, dwelled on the fact that even the \"Statute\" of  1835 had not succeeded in \"correcting\" the Jews. The root of the evil  lay rather in their \"religious fanaticism and separatism,\" which could  only be removed by changing their inner life. The Ministers of Public  Instruction and of the Interior, Uvarov and Stroganov, took occasion to  expound the principles of their new system of correction before the  Council of State. The discussions culminated in a remarkable memorandum  submitted by the Council to Nicholas I.    In this document the Government confesses its impotence in grappling  with the \"defects\" of the Jewish masses, such as \"the absence of useful  labor, their harmful pursuit of petty trading, vagrancy, and obstinate  aloofness from general civic life.\" Its failure the Government ascribes  to the fact that the evil of Jewish exclusiveness has hitherto not been  attacked at its root, the latter being imbedded in the religious and  communal organization of the Jews. The fountain-head of all misfortunes  is the Talmud, which \"fosters in the Jews utmost contempt towards the  nations of other faiths,\" and implants in them the desire \"to rule over  the rest of the world.\" As a result of the obnoxious teachings of the  Talmud, \"the Jews cannot but regard their presence in any other land  except Palestine as a sojourn in captivity,\" and \"they are held to obey  their own authorities rather than a strange government.\" This explains  \"the omnipotence of the Kahals,\" which, contrary to the law of the  state, employ secret means to uphold their autonomous authority both in  communal and judicial matters, using for this purpose the uncontrolled  sums of the special Jewish revenue, the meat tax. The education of the  Jewish youth is entrusted to melammeds, \"a class of domestic teachers  immersed in profoundest ignorance and superstition,\" and, \"under the  influence of these fanatics, the children imbibe pernicious notions of  intolerance towards other nations.\" Finally, the special dress worn by  the Jews helps to keep them apart from the surrounding Christian  population.    The Russian Government \"had adopted a series of protective measures  against the Jews,\" without producing any marked effect. Even the  Conscription Statute \"had succeeded to a limited extent only in altering  the habits of the Jews.\" Mere promotion of agriculture and of Russian  schooling had been found inadequate. The expulsions from the villages  had proved equally fruitless; \"the Jews, to be sure, have been ruined,  but the condition of the rustics has shown no improvement.\"      It is evident, therefore--the Council declares--that restrictions    which go only half way or are externally imposed by the police are    not sufficient to direct this huge mass of people towards useful    occupations. With the patience of martyrs the Jews of Western Europe    had endured the most atrocious persecutions, and had yet succeeded    in keeping their national type intact until the governments took the    trouble to inquire more deeply into the causes separating the Jews    from general civic life, so as to be able to attack the causes    themselves.    After blurting out the truth that the Government's ultimate aim was the  obliteration of the Jewish individuality, and modestly yielding the palm  in inflicting \"the most atrocious persecutions\" upon the Jews to Western  Europe, where after all they were receding into the past, while in  Russia they were still the order of the day, the Council of State  proceeds to consider \"the example set by foreign countries,\" and lingers  with particular affection over the Prussian Regulation of 1797 issued by  that country for its recently occupied Polish provinces--the Prussian  Emancipation Edict of 1812 the memorandum very shrewdly passes over in  silence--and on the system of compulsory schooling adopted by Austria.    Taking its clue from the West, the Council delineates three ways of  bringing about \"a radical transformation of this people\":    1: _Cultural reforms_, such as the establishment of special secular  schools for the Jewish youth, the fight against the old-fashioned  heders and melammeds, the transformation of the rabbinate, and the  prohibition of Jewish dress.    2. _Abolition of Jewish autonomy_, consisting in the dissolution of  the Kahals and the modification of the system of special Jewish  taxation.    3. _Increase of Jewish disabilities_, by segregating from their  midst all those who have no established domicile and are without a  definite financial status,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15767"],[0,"The Texan Scouts: A Story of the Alamo and Goliad (#8)"],[1,"had been blowing all day. But  the breeze had died with the night, and the camp was so still that Ned  could hear the faint trickle of the water over the sand. It was a fair  night, with a cold moon and cold stars looking down. The air was full  of chill, and Ned began to walk up and down again in order to keep warm.  He noticed Roylston still sitting with eyes wide open and the rifle  across his lap.    As Ned came near in his walk the merchant turned his bright eyes upon  him.    \"I hear,\" he said, \"that you have seen Santa Anna.\"    \"More than once. Several times when I was a prisoner in Mexico, and  again when I was recaptured.\"    \"What do you think of him?\"    The gaze of the bright eyes fixed upon Ned became intense and  concentrated.    \"A great man! A wickedly great man!\"    Roylston turned his look away, and interlaced his fingers thoughtfully.    \"A good description, I think,\" he said. \"You have chosen your words  well. A singular compound is this Mexican, a mixture of greatness,  vanity and evil. I may talk to you more of him some day. But I tell you  now that I am particularly desirous of not being carried a prisoner to  him.\"    He lifted the rifle, put its stock to his shoulder, and drew a bead.    \"I think I could hit at forty or fifty yards in this good moonlight,\" he  said.    He replaced the rifle across his knees and sighed. Ned was curious, but  he would not ask questions, and he walked back to his old position by  the bank. Here he made himself easy, and kept his eyes on the deep  trench that had been cut by the stream. The shadows were dark against  the bank, but it seemed to him that they were darker than they had been  before.    Ned's blood turned a little colder, and his scalp tingled. He was  startled but not afraid. He looked intently, and saw moving figures in  the river bed, keeping close against the bank. He could not see faces,  he could not even discern a clear outline of the figures, but he had no  doubt that these were Urrea's Mexicans. He waited only a moment longer  to assure himself that the dark moving line was fact and not fancy.  Then, aiming his rifle at the foremost shape, he fired. While the echo  of the sharp crack was yet speeding across the plain he cried:    \"Up, men! up! Urrea is here!\"    A volley came from the creek bed, but in an instant the Panther, Obed,  Will and Fields were by Ned's side.    \"Down on your faces,\" cried the Panther, \"an' pot 'em as they run! So  they thought to go aroun' the grove, come down from the north an'  surprise us this way! Give it to 'em, boys!\"    The rifles flashed and the dark line in the bed of the creek now broke  into a huddle of flying forms. Three fell, but the rest ran, splashing  through the sand and water, until they turned the curve and were  protected from the deadly bullets. Then the Panther, calling to the  others, rushed to the other side of the grove, where a second attack,  led by Urrea in person, had been begun. Here men on horseback charged  directly at the wood, but they were met by a fire which emptied more  than one saddle.    Much of the charge was a blur to Ned, a medley of fire and smoke, of  beating hoofs and of cries. But one thing he saw clearly and never  forgot. It was the lame man with the thick white hair sitting with his  back against a tree calmly firing a rifle at the Mexicans. Roylston had  time for only two shots, but when he reloaded the second time he placed  the rifle across his knees as before and smiled.    Most Mexican troops would have been content with a single charge, but  these returned, encouraged by shouts and driven on by fierce commands.  Ned saw a figure waving a sword. He believed it to be Urrea, and he  fired, but he missed, and the next moment the horseman was lost in the  shadows.    The second charge was beaten back like the first, and several  skirmishers who tried to come anew down the bed of the creek were also  put to flight. Two Mexicans got into the thickets and tried to stampede  the horses, but the quickness of Obed and Fields defeated their aim. One  of the Mexicans fell there, but the other escaped in the darkness.    When the second charge was driven back and the horses were quieted the  Panther and Obed threshed up the woods, lest some Mexican musketeer  should lie hidden there.    Nobody slept any more that night. Ned, Will and the Panther kept a sharp  watch upon the bed of the creek, the moon and stars fortunately aiding  them. But the Mexicans did not venture again by that perilous road,  although toward morning they opened a scattering fire from the plain,  many of their bullets whistling at random among the trees and thickets.  Some of the Texans, crawling to the edge of the wood, replied, but they  seemed to have little chance for a good shot, as the Mexicans lay behind  a swell. The besiegers grew tired after a while and silence came again.    Three of the Texans had suffered slight wounds, but the Panther and  Fields bound them up skillfully. It was still light enough for these  tasks. Fields was particularly jubilant over their success, as he had a  right to be. The day before he could look forward only to his own  execution. Now he was free and victorious. Exultantly he hummed:        You've heard, I s'pose, of New Orleans,        It's famed for youth and beauty;      There are girls of every hue, it seems,        From snowy white to sooty.      Now Packenham has made his brags,        If he that day was lucky,      He'd have the girls and cotton bags        In spite of Old Kentucky.        But Jackson, he was wide awake,        And was not scared at trifles,      For well he knew Kentucky's boys,        With their death-dealing rifles.      He led them down to cypress swamp,        The ground was low and mucky;      There stood John Bull in martial pomp,        And here stood old Kentucky.    \"Pretty good song, that of yours,\" said the Panther approvingly. \"Where  did you get it?\"    \"From my father,\" replied Fields. \"He's a Kentuckian, an' he fit at New  Orleans. He was always hummin' that song, an' it come back to me after  we drove off the Mexicans. Struck me that it was right timely.\"    Ned and Will, on their own initiative, had been drawing all the fallen  logs that they could find and move to the edge of the wood, and having  finished the task they came back to the bed of the creek. Roylston, the  rifle across his knees, was sitting with his eyes closed, but he opened  them as they approached. They were uncommonly large and bright eyes, and  they expressed pleasure.    \"It gratifies me to see that neither of you is hurt,\" he said. \"This has  been a strange night for two who are as young as you are. And it is a  strange night for me, too. I never before thought that I should be  firing at any one with intent to kill. But events are often too powerful  for us.\"    He closed his eyes again.    \"I am going to sleep a little, if I can,\" he said.    But Ned and Will could not sleep. They went to Ned's old position at the  edge of the creek bed, and together watched the opening dawn. They saw  the bright sun rise over the great plains, and the dew sparkle for a  little while on the brown grass. The day was cold, but apparently it had  come with peace. They saw nothing on the plain, although they had no  doubt that the Mexicans were waiting just beyond the first swell. But  Ned and Will discerned three dark objects lying on the sand up the bed  of the creek, and they knew that they were the men who had fallen in the  first rush. Ned was glad that he could not see their faces.    At the suggestion of the Panther they lighted fires and had warm food  and coffee again, thus putting heart into all the defenders. Then the  Panther chose Ned for a little scouting work on horseback. Ned found Old  Jack seeking blades of grass within the limits allowed by his lariat.  But when the horse saw his master he stretched out his head and neighed.    \"I think I understand you,\" said Ned. \"Not enough food and no water.  Well, I'll see that you get both later, but just now we're going on a  little excursion.\"    The Panther and Ned rode boldly out of the trees, and advanced a short  distance upon the plain. Two or three shots were fired from a point  behind the first swell, but the bullets fell far short.    \"I counted on that,\" said the Panther. \"If a Mexican has a gun it's  mighty hard for him to keep from firing it. All we wanted to do was to  uncover their position an' we've done it. We'll go back now, an' wait  fur them to make the first move.\"    But they did not go just yet. A man on horseback waving a large white  handkerchief appeared on the crest of the swell and rode toward them. It  was Urrea.    \"He knows that he can trust us, while we don't know that we can trust  him,\" said the Panther, \"so we'll just wait here an' see what he has to  say.\"    Urrea, looking fresh and spirited, came on with confidence and saluted  in a light easy fashion. The two Americans did not return the salute,  but waited gravely.    \"We can be polite, even if we are enemies,\" said Urrea, \"so I say good  morning to you both, former friends of mine.\"    \"I have no friendship with spies and traitors,\" growled the Panther.    \"I serve my country in the way I think best,\" said Urrea, \"and you must  remember that in our view you two are rebels and traitors.\"    \"We don't stab in the back,\" said the Panther.    Urrea flushed through his swarthy skin.    \"We will not argue the point any further,\" he said, \"but come at once to  the business before us. First, I will admit several things. Your rescue  of the prisoners was very clever. Also you beat us off last night, but I  now have a hundred men with me and we have plenty of arms. We are bound  to take you sooner or later.\"    \"Then why talk to us about it?\" said the Panther.    \"Because I wish to save bloodshed.\"    \"Wa'al, then, what do you have to say?\"    \"Give us the man, Roylston, and the rest of you can go free.\"    \"Why are"]]]
