He also gets credit for having composed books on medicine.    In George Agricola's De Re Metallica (1561) there is a curious set of  woodcuts representing the manufacture of salt, and in the first, in  which the whole process of evaporating sea-water by the sun's rays is  shown most completely from the raising of the sluices to allow the water  to flow into the various evaporating ponds, to the packing of the  finished salt in barrels--it is a curious fact that the trees which are  introduced are _palms_, and the figure in the distance is dressed in  _Oriental costume_, while even the ship seems to partake of this  character.    A more advanced state of things is shown in the third drawing of the  12th book, where a pan is shown, made of iron plates riveted together so  as to form a flat sheet, which forms the bottom of the pan, of which the  sides are composed of thick wood, strengthened with plates of iron at  the corners.    The bottom of the pan has a series of iron eyes or loops, and these,  when it is fixed over its furnace, are attached to iron rods, which are  hung from a network of wooden bars, so that the whole bottom of the pan  is supported securely at a considerable number of points.    The furnace is very simple, being simply a wall surrounding an oblong  space, a little smaller than the pan, so that the sides of the latter  may rest on the walls all round, except for a small space in front where  the fuel is introduced, which apparently burns on the ground alone.    The method of manufacturing salt in Japan is almost identical with that  figured in Agricola. There is the same arrangement of salt garden or  series of ponds and ditches, and the dirty salts mixed with sand are  again lixiviated, and the filtered liquid is boiled down in curiously  formed pans or boilers.    Of these there are two chief forms, the first being a tank or pan formed  of large pieces of slate, with the joints made with clay, and surrounded  with a mud wall. The whole is covered with an arch or vault and is  filled with the brine, which is then evaporated by surface heat, the  fire being placed at one end and the flue at the other.    The other form is very curious and interesting, and is almost identical  in its principle of construction with the pan I have referred to as  figured in Agricola, only in this case the materials are very different,  being, instead of wood and iron, nothing more than clay or mud.    It was described officially by the Japanese, in their publications at  the Philadelphia Exhibition in 1876. The Japanese description of this  apparatus is highly interesting. It is as follows:--    A low wall is built, enclosing a space of about 13 feet by 9 feet, the  bottom forming a kind of prismatical depression, 3 feet deep in the  centre line. An ashpit, 3 feet deep, is then excavated, starting from  the front wall, and extending about 4 feet into this depression at its  deepest place; it communicates with the outside by a channel sloping  gradually upwards, and passing underneath the front wall. The ashpit is  covered by a clay vault, with holes in its sides, so as to establish a  communication between the ashpit and the hollow space under the pan.  This vault is used as a fire grate, the fuel (brown coal and small wood)  being inserted by the fire-door in the front wall. The air-draught  necessary for burning the fuel enters partly by the fire-door, partly  through the ashpit and the openings left in the vaulted grate. Through  these same openings the ashes and cinders are from time to time pushed  down into the ashpit, for which purpose small openings are left in the  side-wall of the furnace, through which the rakes may be introduced. A  passage in the back wall supporting the pan leads off the products of  combustion and the hot air into a short flue, sloping upwards, and  ending in a short vertical chimney. At the lower part some iron kettles  are placed in the flue for the purpose of heating the lye before it is  ladled into the evaporating pan.    With reference to the pan, it is made in a way that requires a great  deal of skill and practice. In the first place, beams reaching from the  one side to the other are laid on the top of the furnace walls, and are  covered with wooden boards, forming a temporary floor. Two or three feet  above this floor a strong horizontal network of poles of wood sustains a  number of straw ropes, with iron hooks hanging down, and of such a  length that the hooks nearly touch the wooden floor. The floor is  thereupon covered with a mixture of clay and small stones, 4 to 5 inches  thick, the workman being careful to incrustate the iron hooks into this  material. It is allowed to dry gradually, and when considered  sufficiently hardened, the wooden beams and flooring are removed with  the necessary precautions. The bottom of the pan remains suspended by  means of the ropes. The open spaces left all round between the bottom  and the top of the furnace walls are then filled up, and the border of  the pan, 9 inches to 10 inches high, is made of a similar mixture. It is  said that this extraordinary construction lasts from 40 to 50 days when  well made, and that it can be filled 16 times in 24 hours, with an  average of 500 litres of concentrated lye at each filling; but the  quantity depends upon the weather, and is less in winter than in summer.  During the cold season one pan yields 140 litres (of salt) each time it  is filled, and in the hot season from 190 to 210 litres. The average  consumpt of fuel is said to be 1500 kilos. in 24 hours.    In Persia, near Ballakhan, salt is still made, and has been made from  time immemorial, in a very primitive way, which is described by Bellen,  in his description of his journey in 1872 from the Indus to the Tigris,  as follows:--    \"For several miles our road led over a succession of salt pits and  ovens, and lying about we found several samples of the alimentary salt  prepared here from the soil. It was in fine white granules massed  together in the form of the earthen vessel in which the salt had been  evaporated. The process of collecting the salt is very rough and simple.  A conical pit or basin, 7 or 8 feet deep and about 12 feet in diameter  is dug, and around it are excavated a succession of smaller pits, each  about 2 feet diameter by 11/2 feet deep. On one side of the large pit  is a deep excavation, to which the descent from the pit is by a sloping  bank. In this excavation is a domed oven with a couple of fireplaces. At  a little distance off are the piles of earth scraped from the surface  and ready for treatment. And, lastly, circling round each pit is a small  water-cut led off from a larger stream running along the line of pits.    \"Such is the machinery. The process is simply this:--A shovelful of  earth is taken from the heap and washed in the basins (a shovelful to  each) circling the pit.    \"The liquor from these is, whilst yet turbid, run into the great central  pit, by breaking away a channel for it with the fingers. The channel is  then closed with a dab of clay, and a fresh lot of earth washed, and the  liquor run off as before; and so on till the pit is nearly full of  brine. This is allowed to stand till the liquor clears. It is then  ladled out into earthen jars, set on the fire and boiled to evaporation  successively, till the jar is filled with a cake of granular salt. The  jars are then broken, and the mass of salt (which retains its shape) is  ready for conveyance to market.    \"Large quantities of this salt are used by the nomad population, and a  good deal is taken to Kandahar. The quantity turned out here must  annually be very great. The salt pits extend over at least ten miles of  the country we traversed, and we certainly saw some thousands of pits.\"      From what I have laid before you, it will be seen that I am strongly of  opinion that we must go far beyond the time of Geber or the Arabian  school for the origin of our science. The study of the question of its  antiquity leads up to such remote times that there is little probability  of any date being assigned to its beginning, and to some it may appear  but a waste of time to indulge in researches upon the subject; but it  has a fascination peculiar to itself, and, in addition, brings before  our minds so many phases in the philosophical thought of the world, that  it will no doubt long continue to exercise the minds and attract the  attention of chemists.    In the course of my own study of the subject, I have felt much  dissatisfied with the derivation of the name chemistry or alchemy, as it  is given in all works to which I have had access. It is said to be  derived from a word meaning dark, hidden, black, and from the ancient  name for Egypt, but to my own mind this is an unsatisfactory  explanation, and seeking for another more consonant with the character  of the science, I think I have found it in quite a different direction.    It is well known that in the old Hindoo philosophy there were recognized  five elementary bodies or rather types. These were Water, Fire, Ether,  Earth, and Air, and the system of Menu, of which the antiquity is  enormous, recognizes as the greatest conception of the universe--      1st, God.    2nd, Mind.    3rd, Consciousness.    4th, Matras.    5th, Elements.    (matras being the invisible types of the visible atoms which compose the  five elements previously named--viz., Water, Fire, Ether, Earth, and  Air).    Now, these elements, with the sun and moon, composed the attributes of  the dual deity Iswara and Isi, representing the male and female natural  powers, and, applying this to the famous Pythagorean triangle, we find  that the upright symbol or male, which was the number or power 3, when  combined with the female prostrate symbol, which was the number or power  4, gives a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17760"],[0,"How to Enjoy Paris in 1842 (#8)"],[1,"the Faubourg St.  Denis; the street, it is true, is wide and the houses large, but they  have a dirty gloomy forlorn aspect, which gives them an uninhabited  appearance, or as if the inmates did not belong to them; as no care  appears to have been taken to give them some degree of neatness and  comfort; in fact, to bestow upon them an air of home; the stranger  continues rattling over the stones between these great lumbering-looking  dwellings, until his eye is attracted by the Porte St. Denis, which is  a triumphal arch built by Louis the Fourteenth, and certainly presents a  most imposing mass of sculpture, which, although blackened by time, is  an object well worthy the attention of the observing traveller; and here  he crosses the Boulevards, by which he gets a little peep at the  inspiring gaiety of Paris, but is soon hurried into noisy streets until  his brain feels in a whirl; and on his arrival at the Diligence-yard,  when he hopes to obtain a little repose, he is annoyed by being asked  for the keys of his trunks, for the Custom House officers, to make  believe to look into them to ascertain that you have not smuggled any  liquors or other material within the walls of Paris. Those who are  fortunate enough to travel in their own carriages, are exempted from  such tiresome ceremony. Some of the other entries to Paris are somewhat  better, but none of them sufficiently so, to be worthy notice; perhaps  the best amongst the bad is by the Faubourg St. Antoine, the Barrieres du  Trone, at the commencement and summit of the street, presenting a most  noble appearance; indeed, as far as the barriers are concerned, there  are many which are well worthy of notice, being mostly handsome stone  buildings with columns that give them an imposing effect, particularly  when we recollect the little turnpike gates at the principal entrances  of London, with the exception of the recent erections at Knightsbridge,  which sink into nothingness when compared to the Triumphal Arch at the  entrance already described; and, except foreigners, particularly the  English, enter by that quarter, the first aspect of Paris mostly  excites disappointment; the generality of the streets wanting that  straight line of regularity so prevalent throughout London, the French  capital has an incongruous patchy sort of effect, and its beauties and  objects of interest have to be sought, but to the eye of an artist it is  much more gratifying than that dull sameness which reigns throughout  London, which Canova very justly designated as consisting of walls with  square holes in them; for what otherwise can be said of our houses in  general, but that they are literally upright walls, with square holes  for doors and windows. Regent Street and a few others, which have been  recently erected, form an exception to the rule. But in almost every  street in Paris a draftsman finds subject for his pencil; their richly  carved gateways, their elaborately wrought iron balconies, their  ornamented windows, and even their protruding signs, all help to break  the formal straight line and afford ample food for sketching; and in  many of their old and least fashionable streets, an ancient church with  its gothic doorway, adorned by rich and crumbling sculpture, invites the  artist to pause and exercise his imitative art. Paris at first strikes a  stranger as still more bustling and noisy than London, as the streets  being narrower and hack vehicles more used in proportion, the  circulation gets sooner choked up, and the rattling over the stones of  the carriages is still more deafening, being within so confined a space;  hence also the confusion is greater; then there is always a sort of  bewilderment when one first arrives in a large city, that makes it  appear much more astounding than is found to be the case as soon as the  visiter becomes accustomed to its apparent labyrinth.    According to comparative calculations, and taking the medium, Paris is  about twenty-two miles round, and the population, foreigners included,  one million; many estimate it at eleven hundred thousand, which I have  no doubt it may be, if several villages be included which absolutely  join Paris; such as Passy, Belleville, etc. The extreme height of the  houses would induce a belief, that a more, dense mass of people  inhabited the same space of ground than could be the case in London; but  to counterbalance that circumstance, it must be taken into consideration  that there are such an immense number of large gardens and court-yards  in Paris, which occupy a great extent of ground. I have often been  surprised to find, that in nasty dirty narrow streets, the back windows  of the houses looked over extensive gardens, with lofty trees; these are  oftener to be found in the old parts of Paris than in the modern  quarters. A much greater proportion of the population consists of  foreigners, than is the case in London, consequently it is more moving  and changeable. It is the great post town for almost all Europeans who  visit England, and hundreds of thousands come to Paris, who never think  of going to London, deterred by an exaggerated idea of the expense;  hence it will be found that very few persons from the Continent visit  London who have not already been to Paris, although, now that steam  conveyance affords such facilities of accommodation between London and  many of the large cities in Europe, the case is somewhat altered. But  Paris has been long regarded as the Museum of the Continent, and few men  possessing good fortunes from civilised countries, if gifted with  enquiring minds, consider their education complete if they have not  sojourned some time at Paris, which has for time immemorial had the  reputation of being the seat of the polite arts. Nearly a third of the  houses in Paris are designated hotels, many of which do not provide  meals but merely furnished lodgings, and most of their inmates are  foreigners, others, persons from the provinces, consequently at least  one quarter of the population of Paris is constantly changing. But  perhaps no city is anywhere to be found where a stranger can sooner  accommodate himself in every respect, as the customs are such that a  person may live as he likes, go where he likes, and do as he likes,  provided he do no harm. In London, if a lady and gentleman from the  country arrive for the purpose of passing a day, and have no  acquaintances, there are no houses as in Paris where one can take a  wife, sister, or daughter to breakfast or dine, without being subject to  remark, unless indeed you can draw up to the door of a hotel with an  equipage; then certainly every attention and accommodation is to be  found, but only such as will suit a very limited number of purses;  whereas, at Paris a family may find in most of the restaurateurs small  apartments where they can dine by themselves if they object to the  public room, but even in the latter they might take their meal very  undisturbed and without exciting the slightest observation, at various  prices that will either suit the economist or the wealthy individual.  This is amongst many of the conveniences of Paris; as also that of the  libraries being open to the public, any one having the privilege to call  for the book he wishes, where he may read as quietly as in his own  house. This is extremely useful to studious and literary men, as there  are so many works of reference too expensive to be within the compass of  a small private library, which may be found in the liberal  establishments in which Paris abounds. Museums, exhibitions, academies,  gardens, public buildings, etc., are, with a very few exceptions,  accessible to the foreigner merely on the exhibition of his passport.          CHAPTER III.    TO AN HISTORIAN.         A very brief account of the foundation of Paris, its progress       during the most remarkable epochs, and under the reigns of some of       its most celebrated monarchs with its, gradual advance in       civilisation to the present period. Some allusions also to the       customs which existed in the earlier ages, and a statement of the       different dates as regards the erection and foundation of the       various monuments and institutions still extant.    [Illustration: Paris in the 16th Century. View taken from the towers of  Notre Dame.]      France, under the ancient appellation of Gaul, is cited in history as  early as 622 years before the Christian era, when Belloveaus, a  celebrated leader from that country, defeated the Hetrurians and made  himself master of Piedmont and Lombardy, by crossing the Rhone and the  Alps with his army, which at that period had never before been  attempted. Increasing in power, we find, 180 years after, the Gauls,  headed by Brennus, sacking and burning Rome; and the same chief, after  having been defeated and cut off by Camillus, the Roman general, with  the loss of 40,000 men, again appears in the year 387 before Christ at  the head of 150,000 foot and 60,000 horse, invading Macedonia, and after  ravaging the country and being ultimately defeated in Greece, to have  put an end to his existence. Some idea may be formed of the ferocious  and obdurate spirit of the Gauls, from the circumstance of the women  fighting as bravely as the men against Marius, who successfully defended  Italy against them; and when these desperate amazons found that they  were overpowered, they slew themselves and their children rather than  surrender. This occurred 101 years anterior to the birth of our Saviour,  and from that period scarcely a century has passed in which history does  not record many instances of heroic devotion of Frenchwomen, often wrong  in its object, but ever displaying a determined courage, reckless of all  selfish consideration. The names of Joan of Arc, Jeanne Hachette,  Charlotte Corday, and the Chevalier d'Eon are known to all, and hundreds  of others must live in the memory of those who are"]]]
