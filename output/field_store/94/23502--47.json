Cooley & Keese at their splendid hall in Broadway present this year a  richer and more extensive series of invoices than has ever before been  sold in America.           *       *       *       *       *          THE FINE ARTS.           *       *       *       *       *    Bavaria is a sort of artists' paradise, both the late King Louis and  the present Maximilian being determined to leave behind them the glory  of munificent patrons of art. In this they have so far succeeded, that  Munich, which before their time was by no means among German cities  the most worthy a traveler's attention, may now dispute the palm even  with Dresden, notwithstanding the unrivaled gallery of paintings,  possessed by the latter. For students of modern art, and especially  of the German schools, Munich is incomparable, while its collection of  ancient sculptures cannot be equaled out of Italy. We now learn that  King Maximilian has conceived the plan of a grand series of pictures  to comprehend the prominent epochs and events of history. The most  eminent German and foreign artists are to be invited to assist in  carrying out this immense undertaking; so that thus the series will  not only represent the great experiences of mankind, but will, it is  hoped, contain specimens of all the great schools of modern painting.           *       *       *       *       *    An exhibition of indisputable works by the old painters is now open  at Valenciennes, in France. It consists of pictures belonging to the  family of the Belgian general Rottiers. They are for sale, either  single or together. Among them is a St. Denis, bearing his Head, by  Rubens, said to have been painted by order of Pope Urban VIII. It was  deposited in the Convent of the _Annunciades_, at Antioch; in 1747,  Louis XV. offered 100,000 francs for it, but was refused, the convent  having no right to dispose of it. Afterward, on the suppression  of the convent, it fell into the hands of the family to which it  now belongs. The exhibition also contains a landscape by Salvator  Rosa, representing a scene in the Appenines; a Magdalen kneeling  in a Cavern, by Kneller; two Allegories, by Giulio Romano; several  portraits by Rubens and Van Dyke, besides other works of less value.           *       *       *       *       *    Darley's \"Sleepy Hollow.\"--The London Art Journal, for July, has the  following notice of Mr. Darley's illustrations of Irving's \"Legends of  Sleepy Hollow,\" published by the _American Art Union_: \"The charmingly  quaint original legend told with so much quiet humor by Washington  Irving, is here illustrated by a native artist in a congenial spirit,  and his scenes realized in a manner which must give its author  satisfaction, and redound to the credit of the designer. We have  before noticed the great ability exhibited by Mr. Darley for the mode  of illustration he adopts, which we may add is that rendered famous  by Retzsh. The series we are now noticing are quite as meritorious as  that designed by the same artist to Rip Van Winkle; but the subject  matter is not equally capable of such broad contrasts in drollery  as that legend presents. Nevertheless, Mr. Darley has executed his  task in the truest appreciation of his author; and his hero is the  veritable Ichabod Crane of Irving; his love-making scene with \"the  peerless daughter of Van Tassel\" is exquisite in its quiet humor;  so also is the merry-making in the Dutch Farmer's home. Altogether,  the series is extremely good, and does the greatest credit to the  designer. American literature thus illustrated by American artists  cannot fail to achieve honor to that country in the old world as well  as the new. We believe Mr. Darley, in his line, to be as great as any  American artist whose works have fallen under our notice.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Chaucer's Monument.--The _Athenaeum_ says, \"One of the objections  formerly urged against taking steps to restore the perishing memorial  of the Father of English Poetry in Poet's Corner was, that it was not  really his tomb, but a monument erected to do honor to his memory a  century and a half after his death. An examination, however, of the  tomb itself, by competent authorities, has proved this objection to  be unfounded--inasmuch as there can exist no doubt, we hear, from  the difference of workmanship, material, &c., that the altar tomb is  the original tomb of Geoffrey Chaucer,--and that instead of Nicholas  Brigham having erected an entirely new monument, he only added to that  which then existed the overhanging canopy, &c. So that the sympathy of  Chaucer's admirers is now invited to the restoration of what till now  was really not known to exist--_the original tomb_ of the Poet--as  well as to the additions made to it by the affectionate remembrance of  Nicholas Brigham.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Lessing's new picture.--A letter from Duesseldorf under date of  9th July, in the _Courier and Enquirer_, says that Lessing's great  painting, \"The Martyrdom of Huss,\" Sad just been finished and had been  exhibited for the last few days at the Academy of Fine Arts, where  it was visited by thousands. When it became known that orders for its  immediate shipment had arrived from New York, the desire to obtain a  last view of this truly great work became so intense that it was found  necessary to put the Police in requisition to keep back the throng,  and the gates of the Academy had to be closed. It causes general  regret that it is to be sent out of the country. The _Cologne Gazette_  calls this picture the most sublime production of the great artist,  and expresses the conviction that a speedy fortune might be realized  by its exhibition in Europe.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. George Flagg has just completed a portrait of Mrs. E. Oakes Smith,  which will be ranked among the first productions of his pencil. We  know of scarce a picture as beautiful or a portrait as truthful. It is  to be engraved, we believe, by Cheney.           *       *       *       *       *    Mlle. Rachel.--The wonderful accuracy of the death-scene in \"Adrienne  Lecouvreur\" has been the object of universal praise in London, not  merely from the thrilled and thralled public, but from men of art  and science. A physician, it is said, was complimenting Mademoiselle  on her amazing truth to the symptoms of mortal agony: \"You must have  studied death closely,\" said he. \"Yes, I have,\" was the quiet reply;  \"my maid's. I went up to her--I stayed with her--she recommended her  mother to me!--I was studying my part.\" This is probably merely one  of those cynical stories with which the sharp people of Paris love  to environ and encircle every one who stands a dangerous chance of  becoming too popular. But smaller artists than Mademoiselle Rachel  have sometimes had recourse to curious expedients to give their  dramatic personations a show at reality. The French _prima donna_, who  not very long ago appeared in M. Clapisson's poor opera, \"Jeanne la  Folle,\" is said to have shut herself up in the _Salpetriere_, by way  of studying _her_ part, and to have been rewarded for her zealous  curiosity by receiving a basin of scalding soup dashed in her face by  one of the poor miserable objects of her examination.           *       *       *       *       *    A Frankfort journal states that the colossal statue of Bavaria, by  SCHWANTHALER, which is to be placed on the hill of Seudling, surpasses  in its gigantic proportions all the works of the moderns. It will have  to be removed in pieces from the foundry where it is cast to its place  of destination,--and each piece will require sixteen horses to draw  it. The great toes are each half a metre in length. In the head two  persons could dance a polka very conveniently,--while the nose might  lodge the musician. The thickness of the robe--which forms a rich  drapery descending to the ankles--is about six inches, and its  circumference at the bottom about two hundred metres. The Crown  of Victory which the figure holds in her hands weighs one hundred  quintals (a quintal is a hundred-weight).           *       *       *       *       *    The death of SIR ROBERT PEEL, says the _Literary Gazette_, has  awakened a busy competing spirit for the production of articles  relating to him, and especially in connection with Literature and the  Arta. In the one, Memoirs, Speeches, Recollections, Anecdotes, &c.,  have been abundantly supplied; and in the other, every printshop  window in London displays its Peels of every style and every degree,  but mostly very indifferent, absolutely bad, or utter caricature.           *       *       *       *       *    Goupil, Vibert & Co. have published a series of portraits of eminent  Americans which is deserving of the largest approval and sale.  The head of Mr. Bryant is the best ever published of that poet; it  presents his fine features and striking phrenology with great force  and with pleasing as well as just effect. A portrait of Mr. Willis  is wonderfully truthful, in detail, and is in an eminent degree  characteristic. The admirers of that author who have not seen him will  find in it their ideal, and all his acquaintances will see in it as  distinctly the real man who sits in the congress of editors as the  representative of the polite world. The head of the artist Mount,  after Elliott, is not by any means less successful.

I looked at them for some time and nothing happened, when,  without a word, one of the sheep walked up to the shepherd and  borrowed his pipe and smoked it--an incident that struck me as  unlikely; but in the Hills of Sneg I met an honest politician. Over  these plains went Jones and over the Hills of Sneg, meeting at first  unlikely things, and then incredible things, till he came to the long  slope beyond the hills that leads up to the Edge of the World, and  where, as all guidebooks tell, anything may happen. You might at the  foot of this slope see here and there things that could conceivably  occur in the fields we know; but soon these disappeared, and the  traveller saw nothing but fabulous beasts, browsing on flowers as  astounding as themselves, and rocks so distorted that their shapes had  clearly a meaning, being too startling to be accidental. Even the  trees were shockingly unfamiliar, they had so much to say, and they  leant over to one another whenever they spoke and struck grotesque  attitudes and leered. Jones saw two fir-trees fighting. The effect of  these scenes on his nerves was very severe; still he climbed on, and  was much cheered at last by the sight of a primrose, the only familiar  thing he had seen for hours, but it whistled and skipped away. He saw  the unicorns in their secret valley. Then night in a sinister way  slipped over the sky, and there shone not only the stars, but lesser  and greater moons, and he heard dragons rattling in the dark.    With dawn there appeared above him among its amazing crags the town of  Tong Tong Tarrup, with the light on its frozen stairs, a tiny cluster  of houses far up in the sky. He was on the steep mountain now: great  mists were leaving it slowly, and revealing, as they trailed away,  more and more astonishing things. Before the mist had all gone he  heard quite near him, on what he had thought was bare mountain, the  sound of a heavy galloping on turf. He had come to the plateau of the  centaurs. And all at once he saw them in the mist: there they were,  the children of fable, five enormous centaurs. Had he paused on  account of any astonishment he had not come so far: he strode on over  the plateau, and came quite near to the centaurs. It is never the  centaurs' wont to notice men; they pawed the ground and shouted to one  another in Greek, but they said no word to him. Nevertheless they  turned and stared at him when he left them, and when he had crossed  the plateau and still went on, all five of them cantered after to the  edge of their green land; for above the high green plateau of the  centaurs is nothing but naked mountains, and the last green thing that  is seen by the mountaineer as he travels to Tong Tong Tarrup is the  grass that the centaurs trample. He came into the snow fields that the  mountain wears like a cape, its head being bare above it, and still  climbed on. The centaurs watched him with increasing wonder.    Not even fabulous beasts were near him now, nor strange demoniac  trees--nothing but snow and the clean bare crag above it on which was  Tong Tong Tarrup. All day he climbed and evening found him above the  snow-line; and soon he came to the stairway cut in the rock and in  sight of that grizzled man, the long porter of Tong Tong Tarrup,  sitting mumbling amazing memories to himself and expecting in vain  from the stranger a gift of bash.    It seems that as soon as the stranger arrived at the bastion gateway,  tired though he was, he demanded lodgings at once that commanded a  good view of the Edge of the World. But the long porter, that grizzled  man, disappointed of his bash, demanded the stranger's story to add to  his memories before he would show him the way. And this is the story,  if the long porter has told me the truth and if his memory is still  what it was. And when the story was told, the grizzled man arose, and,  dangling his musical keys, went up through door after door and by many  stairs and led the stranger to the top-most house, the highest roof in  the world, and in its parlour showed him the parlour window. There the  tired stranger sat down in a chair and gazed out of the window sheer  over the Edge of the World. The window was shut, and in its glittering  panes the twilight of the World's Edge blazed and danced, partly like  glow-worms' lamps and partly like the sea; it went by rippling, full  of wonderful moons. But the traveller did not look at the wonderful  moons. For from the abyss there grew with their roots in far  constellations a row of hollyhocks, and amongst them a small green  garden quivered and trembled as scenes tremble in water; higher up,  ling in bloom was floating upon the twilight, more and more floated up  till all the twilight was purple; the little green garden low down was  hung in the midst of it. And the garden down below, and the ling all  round it, seemed all to be trembling and drifting on a song. For the  twilight was full of a song that sang and rang along the edges of the  World, and the green garden and the ling seemed to flicker and ripple  with it as the song rose and fell, and an old woman was singing it  down in the garden. A bumble-bee sailed across from over the Edge of  the World. And the song that was lapping there against the coasts of  the World, and to which the stars were dancing, was the same that he  had heard the old woman sing long since down in the valley in the  midst of the Northern moor.    But that grizzled man, the long porter, would not let the stranger  stay, because he brought him no bash, and impatiently he shouldered  him away, himself not troubling to glance through the World's  outermost window, for the lands that Time afflicts and the spaces that  Time knows not are all one to that grizzled man, and the bash that he  eats more profoundly astounds his mind than anything man can show him  either in the World we know or over the Edge. And, bitterly  protesting, the traveller went back and down again to the World.                          .     .     .     .     .    Accustomed as I am to the incredible from knowing the Edge of the  World, the story presents difficulties to me. Yet it may be that the  devastation wrought by Time is merely local, and that outside the  scope of his destruction old songs are still being sung by those that  we deem dead. I try to hope so. And yet the more I investigate the  story that the long porter told me in the town of Tong Tong Tarrup the  more plausible the alternative theory appears--that that grizzled man  is a liar.            The Loot of Loma    Coming back laden with the loot of Loma, the four tall men looked  earnestly to the right; to the left they durst not, for the precipice  there that had been with them so long went sickly down on to a bank of  clouds, and how much further below that only their fears could say.    Loma lay smoking, a city of ruin, behind them, all its defenders dead;  there was no one left to pursue them, and yet their Indian instincts  told them that all was scarcely well. They had gone three days along  that narrow ledge: mountain quite smooth, incredible, above them, and  precipice as smooth and as far below. It was chilly there in the  mountains; at night a stream or a wind in the gloom of the chasm below  them went like a whisper; the stillness of all things else began to  wear the nerve--an enemy's howl would have braced them; they began to  wish their perilous path were wider, they began to wish that they had  not sacked Loma.    Had that path been any wider the sacking of Loma must indeed have been  harder for them, for the citizens must have fortified the city but  that the awful narrowness of that ten-league pass of the hills had  made their crag-surrounded city secure. And at last an Indian had  said, \"Come, let us sack it.\" Grimly they laughed in the wigwams. Only  the eagles, they said, had ever seen it, its hoard of emeralds and its  golden gods; and one had said he would reach it, and they answered,  \"Only the eagles.\"    It was Laughing Face who said it, and who gathered thirty braves and  led them into Loma with their tomahawks and their bows; there were  only four left now, but they had the loot of Loma on a mule. They had  four golden gods, a hundred emeralds, fifty-two rubies, a large silver  gong, two sticks of malachite with amethyst handles for holding  incense at religious feasts, four beakers one foot high, each carved  from a rose-quartz crystal; a little coffer carved out of two  diamonds, and (had they but known it) the written curse of a priest.  It was written on parchment in an unknown tongue, and had been slipped  in with the loot by a dying hand.    From either end of that narrow, terrible ledge the third night was  closing in; it was dropping down on them from the heights of the  mountain and slipping up to them out of the abyss, the third night  since Loma blazed and they had left it. Three more days of tramping  should bring them in triumph home, and yet their instincts said that  all was scarcely well. We who sit at home and draw the blinds and shut  the shutters as soon as night appears, who gather round the fire when  the wind is wild, who pray at regular seasons and in familiar shrines,  know little of the demoniac look of night when it is filled with  curses of false, infuriated gods. Such a night was this. Though in the  heights the fleecy clouds were idle, yet the wind was stirring  mournfully in the abyss and moaning as it stirred, unhappily at first  and full of sorrow; but as day turned away from that awful path a very  definite menace entered its voice which fast grew louder and louder,  and night came on with a long howl. Shadows repeatedly passed over the  stars, and then a mist fell swiftly, as though there were something  suddenly to be done and utterly to be hidden, as in very truth there  was.    And in the chill of that mist the four tall men prayed "]]]
