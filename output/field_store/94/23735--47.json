Many springs upon my farm are  excellent, but this is peerless.\"    The house in the woods was built by uncle to suit Aunt Mary's taste,  and very comfortable and complete it is.  Uncle says of it:    \"It is not much--hastily erected, small, slight, and wooden, it has at  length been almost deserted for one recently purchased and refitted on  the edge of the village; but the cottage in the woods is still my home,  where my books remain, and where I mean to garner my treasures.\"    The house consists of two stories with that most necessary addition to  a country house, a broad piazza.  To the right stands a white cottage,  built for the servants.  Almost in front of the house is a large  boulder, moss-grown and venerable.  This, Aunt Mary would not have  removed, for she loved Nature in its wildest primeval beauty, and now  the rock is associated with loving memories of Raffie's little hands  that once prepared fairy banquets upon it, with acorn-cups for dishes;  but now those baby hands have long since been folded quietly in the  grave.    The little play-house, that has since been removed to the  croquet-ground, once stood not far from this rock, and has been used,  as I said, by Gabrielle as a menagerie for her pets.  A strange  assortment they often were for a little girl.  Inheriting her mother's  exquisite tenderness of feeling towards helpless animals, Gabrielle  would splinter and bandage up the little legs of any baby robin or  sparrow that had met with an accident from trying its wings too early,  would nurse it till well, and then let it fly away.  At one time she  had in the play-house a little regiment of twelve toads, a red  squirrel, and a large turtle.  Aunt Mary never wished her to cage her  pets, as she thought it cruel; consequently they had the range of the  play-house, and Gabrielle fed them very conscientiously.  She ought,  however, to have followed the example of St. Francis, who used to  preach to animals and insects when he had no human audience, and given  her pets a daily dissertation upon brotherly love and tolerance, for  they did not, I regret to say, live together in the Christian harmony  that distinguished Barnum's Happy Family.  The result was, that one day  when Gabrielle went to minister to their physical wants, she found only  a melancholy _debris_ of little legs.  Her supposition was that the  turtle had consumed the toads and then died of dyspepsia, and that the  squirrel had by some unknown means escaped from the play-house, and  returned to primeval liberty.    [Illustration: The Children's Play House.]    Forgetting this sad experience, Gabrielle endeavored at another time to  bring up a snake and a toad in the way they should go (this time in an  empty hen-coop); but the snake certainly did depart from it, and  astonished the family much by gliding into the kitchen with the unhappy  toad in his mouth.  Poor Gabrielle's feelings can be imagined.  She  endeavored courageously to wrest the toad from its enemy's jaws, but  all in vain; she was obliged to see the hapless creature consumed by  the snake.    Mamma has often described Aunt Mary to me as she looked when she first  met her.  The portrait mamma draws of her as a bride would scarcely be  recognized by those who only knew her after long years of weary illness  had      \"Paled her glowing cheek.\"    I will give it in mamma's own words:    \"Immediately after your uncle's marriage, he sent for me to come from  my parents' quiet farm in Pennsylvania, to spend the winter in the city  with himself and his wife.  A great event this was to me--far greater  than your first visit to Europe, for the journey occupied double the  time that is now spent between New York and Liverpool, and I was a  young girl whose acquaintance with the world was confined to the narrow  limits of the little village of Clymer; I had never even been sent away  to boarding-school.    \"One bright September morning I started upon my eventful journey.  Your  uncle Barnes drove me in a buggy to Buffalo, a distance of three days  at that time.  At this city--the first large one that I had ever seen,  my brother left me in charge of a party going through, as he supposed,  to New York.  Then ensued two weeks upon a canal boat; very slow  travelling you children would consider it, accustomed as you are to  whirling over the country in an express train; but at my romantic age,  this dreamy, delicious style of boat travel was the perfection of  happiness.    \"At Rochester my friends left me, first placing me under the care of  the captain of the canal-boat, who promised to put me upon the  steamboat when we should reach Albany.    \"The prospect of the day to be spent upon the Hudson possessed no  charms for me, but on the contrary, untold terror.  I had never before  seen a steamboat, but they had been introduced upon Lake Erie, near  enough to my home for me to hear, with alarm, of all the accidents that  had so far befallen them upon that very turbulent sheet of water;  consequently, I embarked upon the 'Washington,' in the full conviction  that I was about to meet with my doom.    \"All that day I sat motionless in a corner of the promenade deck,  reading my Bible.  Perfectly oblivious alike to the magnificent scenery  that I was passing, and to the elegant toilettes such as my  country-bred eyes had never before beheld, by which I was surrounded; I  neither spoke to nor looked at any one, nor dared to leave my seat even  to go to dinner; but endeavored to gain, from the sacred volume in my  hands, strength for the terrible fate that I was confident awaited me.  I have often since wondered what my fellow-travellers thought of the  still, shy little figure whose eyes were never once lifted from her  Bible.    \"About four o'clock a terrible explosion was heard, the boat was thrown  violently upon her side, and a scene of confusion, shrieks, and  fainting-fits then ensued.  I did not faint--I was much too alarmed for  that; I merely turned very white, and trembled from head to foot.  The  wheel-house had been blown away, I learnt before long, but no one  fortunately was injured, and after a delay of an hour or so the boat  was righted, and we proceeded upon our journey, at a snail's pace,  however.    \"Owing to the accident, we did not reach New York until ten o'clock.  No one was at the pier to meet me, for brother had supposed that I  would arrive before sunset.  As I did not appear, however, he concluded  that I had not left Albany at the time appointed.  But my adventures of  the day were not yet over.  I secured a cab, and drove to the address  he had given me, 123 Hudson Street, which in 1836 was by no means the  plebeian locality it is at present, but a fashionable street, devoted  exclusively to elegant residences.  Upon inquiring for Mr. Greeley, my  consternation was great to learn that although he had looked at rooms  in that house, he had not engaged them, and the landlady had no idea of  his address.  I was almost as timid about cabs as I had been about the  steamboat; for I had heard stories of young girls being robbed and  murdered by New York cab-drivers, and here I was, late at night, in all  the whirl and excitement of the metropolis, driving I knew not where,  and entirely at the mercy of an assassin.  However, my modest trunk did  not look very inviting, I suppose, for I reached _The New Yorker_  office--the only other address I knew in the city--without further  adventure, where I ascertained that brother was now living at 124  Greenwich Street--a most beautiful situation close by the Battery--then  the fashionable promenade of New York.  He had written to tell me of  his change of residence, but the letter failed to reach me.    \"It was half-past eleven when I finally reached my home.  The large  parlor was ablaze with lights, and crowded with people; for it was  Friday, the night that _The New Yorker_ went to press, and brother's  reception evening.  I was trembling with fatigue and excitement, and  very faint, for I had not eaten since early in the morning; but all  these emotions vanished when I was introduced to my new sister.  I had  seen no pictures of her, and knew her only through brother's  description, and a few letters she had written me since her marriage,  and I was quite unprepared for the exquisite, fairy-like creature I now  beheld.  A slight, girlish figure, rather _petite_ in stature, dressed  in clouds of white muslin, cut low, and her neck and shoulders covered  by massive dark curls, from which gleamed out an Oriental-looking  _coiffure_, composed of strands of large gold and pearl beads.  Her  eyes were large, dark, and pensive, and her rich brunette complexion  was heightened by a flush, not brilliant like Gabrielle's, but delicate  as a rose-leaf.  She appeared to me like a being from another world.\"    To continue mamma's reminiscences of uncle's first year of married life:    \"I found my sister-in-law's tastes,\" she said, \"quite different from  those of the majority of young ladies.  In literature her preference  was for the solid and philosophic, rather than the romantic class of  reading; indeed, I may say that she never read, she _studied_; going  over a paragraph several times, until she had fully comprehended its  subtleties of thought, and stored them away in her retentive memory for  future use.  During that year, I never knew her to read a work of  fiction; but philosophy or science formed her daily nourishment; whilst  brother, whenever he had a free evening, read aloud to Mary and I from  Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, sweetened now and then  with a selection from Lord Byron or Mrs. Hemans--the two poets that at  that time he preferred.    \"But although your Aunt Mary had such severe literary tastes, she was  by no means gloomy in her disposition, as you might perhaps infer.

The fry, as soon as they are strong enough, will make  their way into this ditch, and will find abundance of food among  the water plants; thence they ought to be able to make their way  into the brook, river, or lake which it is intended to store with  them. All ducks, wild and tame, should be driven from this ditch,  or few of the Trout will be allowed to find their way to their  final place of destination.    These rules, with some modification, are applicable to the  breeding of Salmon as well as Trout; the only difference being in  the mode of placing the female fish, when obtaining the roe, and  the size of the gravel in which the spawn is deposited in the  boxes. The Salmon is too large a fish to put into the vessels in  which the diluted milt is placed, but I think that she should be  held by an assistant, in such a manner that the tail and lower  part of the body up to the vent are immersed in the water  containing the milt. And it is also very necessary to hold her  firmly, otherwise a large fish, in the struggles which it makes to  get free, is apt to upset the vessel containing the milt, and then  the experiment is at an end, at least for the time. Being held  firmly by the assistant, as above stated, the belly of the fish  must be gently pressed by the hands to promote the exclusion of  the spawn, which on exclusion must be gently stirred in the  diluted milt, to bring every grain into contact with it; but the  roe ought not to remain in contact with the milt a minute, if it  can sooner be got out, as I have found that if the diluted milt be  too strong, or if the ova remain too long in contact with it, they  become opaque, and never hatch at all, apparently because they are  over-impregnated. In the ordinary way in which Salmon and Trout  are bred, the milt must be largely diluted with water, and the  contact between the milt and ova can only be momentary, for the  streams in which these fish spawn (particularly the Salmon) are so  rapid, that the milt on exclusion must be carried away immediately.    There is another method, which is preferred by Ramsbottom, to the  one I have been describing, and it is certainly less troublesome.  This is to take the ova from the female fish in the first place  (taking care to exclude the air from it, by immersing the fish  into water up to the vent), and when all the roe has been  collected into a large bowl or basin, then mix the milt with it,  the same diluted in the proportion which has been before  described, namely, until the water which covers the roe becomes  lightly opalescent.    I am quite aware that there is another theory which assumes that  impregnation takes place twelve months before the exclusion of the  ova. [8] But a very careful and long continued examination of the  spawning of minnows and lampreys (I have never been able closely  to examine the spawning of Salmon), convinces me that it is not a  correct one. Besides, did any one ever succeed in hatching the ova  of a fish which had not been allowed to come in contact with milt  after exclusion? If they have, when, where, and how has this been  accomplished, and where is it recorded? I know that I could never  succeed, although I have often tried the experiment. On the other  hand, it is the easiest thing imaginable, with due care and a  suitable situation, to hatch those which have been properly  impregnated after exclusion. But if, to avoid argument, I admit  that this theory is correct, it will not at all interfere with  artificial breeding of Trout and Salmon; on the contrary, it will  materially facilitate it. It will only be necessary to catch  female fish with the ova ready for exclusion, and place these ova  in clean gravel in a box, as before described, but there will be  no occasion for males. But supposing Trout and Salmon can be bred  in this manner, which I by no means believe, there would be no  means of breeding hybrids, which I consider a far more important  achievement, and to which I will now refer.    Ever since my attention was turned to the artificial breeding of  fish, it has always appeared to me exceedingly desirable and  important to breed hybrids between the Trout and the Salmon. The  fry of the Salmon, which, by-the-bye, is perhaps the most  delicately flavoured fish that exists in this country, although it  lives and thrives in fresh water for two or three years, if kept  in a locality where it cannot escape to the sea, yet, if kept  longer than that time, pines away and dies. If, therefore, we  could obtain a hybrid fish, bred between the river Trout and the  Salmon, we should probably produce a fish which, being a mule,  would be always in good condition; being crossed with a river  fish, it would probably never require a visit to salt water to  keep it in good health. Being crossed with a Salmon, it ought to  get to a good size in a comparatively short period; and, if it  would rise at the artificial fly, or the minnow, ought to afford  first-rate sport to the angler.    There does not appear to be a greater specific difference between  the Trout and the Salmon than there is between the horse and the  ass, between the mallard and the musk duck, or between a cabbage  and a turnip. But hitherto, in all my experiments, I have never  succeeded in producing a hybrid between the Trout and the  Salmon. [9] Yet I do not despair of doing so, for there was always  a something to complain of, and to doubt about, in every one I  tried, and I still think I shall succeed by perseverance. Even if  I shall succeed, the result may not prove quite so favourable as I  anticipate, but may turn out as unfortunately as the marriage of  the gentleman in the story, which relates that, being good-  tempered but ugly himself, he married a handsome ill-tempered  wife, hoping that his children would have his good-temper and  their mother's good looks; but when they came, they were as ugly  as the father and as ill-tempered as the mother. So it may prove  with these hybrids--they may not always thrive in fresh water;  they may not grow to a good size; they may not rise at the  artificial fly; they may be worthless for the table. Nevertheless,  it is desirable if possible that this should be ascertained. The  progeny of a male Salmon and a female Trout may be much better or  much worse fitted for a continual residence in fresh water than  the descendants of a male Trout and a female Salmon; but this can  only be determined by experiment. Dr. Lindley says, in his  introduction to the \"Guide to the Orchard,\" that in the cross  fertilization of fruits, the seedlings always partake more of the  character of the male than of the female parent. But I believe  that in breeding mules it is found more desirable that the father  should be an ass than a horse. In my poultry yard I breed hybrids  between the musk duck and the common duck, and I find that I have  a much better progeny from the musk drake and the common duck than  from the common drake and the musk duck. In the latter cross,  although the males are fine birds, the females are not larger than  a widgeon, and fly about almost like wild ducks. This may not  always be the case, but it has proved so with me.    But to return to the fish. If any gentleman who is interested in  such matters will do me the honour to read this paper, and wishes  for further information on the subject, I shall be happy to give  it, so far as I am able. Very sure I am that the sportsman who  once fairly starts as a fly-fisher, and is so fortunate as to hook  a Salmon or a large Trout, will thenceforward despise or lightly  esteem corks and floats, ground-bait and trimmers, punts and Perch  fishing, and will fairly wish them all exchanged for a nice stream  well stocked with Trout--as a gentleman lately said to me, fly-  fishing is a perfect infatuation! He was quite right. The extreme  avidity with which it is followed by the thoroughly initiated, can  only be explained on that supposition; to the casual observer,  there does not appear to be any strong excitement in it. But that  is a great mistake. Let me get to the bank of a river well stocked  with Trout in a good humour, early in the morning, and I feel  neither hunger, thirst, nor fatigue if I fish until dark without  tasting of anything. And the excitement of hooking a ten or twelve  pound Salmon is not much inferior to that produced by a long run  after the hounds.    I cannot conclude without calling the attention of all interested,  and who are able to render assistance in remedying the evil, to  the great falling off in the quantity of fish there is in all the  Salmon rivers in England. With those in Scotland and Ireland I am  not acquainted, but believe that matters are not in a much better  state there. I believe that the unsatisfactory state of the laws  has a great deal to do with this decline in the value of the  fisheries, and I also believe that it is quite possible so to  alter the law as to very greatly improve them, and that without  improperly interfering with what is of far more importance--I mean  the manufactories of the country. As the law stands at present the  proprietors of the upper parts of rivers have not the slightest  interest in the preservation of the fish in the breeding season,  for, as they are seldom allowed to see a fish when it is fit for  the table, why should they look after the poachers in close time?  Why should they be put to much expense and trouble, as well as the  risk of the lives of their game-keepers, merely to breed fish for  the proprietors of stake nets and estuary fisheries, who don't  spend a farthing in the preservation of the fish when breeding,  and yet reap all the benefit? I had occasion, some years ago, to  examine the evidence on this subject given before the House of  Commons in 1825, and was exceedingly amused at the schemes  resorted to to"]]]
