[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/146"],[0,"A Little Princess (#8)"],[1,"she fell fast asleep.  She had really been only about ten minutes  in the room when Sara entered, but she was in as deep a sleep as if she  had been, like the Sleeping Beauty, slumbering for a hundred years.  But she did not look--poor Becky--like a Sleeping Beauty at all.  She  looked only like an ugly, stunted, worn-out little scullery drudge.    Sara seemed as much unlike her as if she were a creature from another  world.    On this particular afternoon she had been taking her dancing lesson,  and the afternoon on which the dancing master appeared was rather a  grand occasion at the seminary, though it occurred every week. The  pupils were attired in their prettiest frocks, and as Sara danced  particularly well, she was very much brought forward, and Mariette was  requested to make her as diaphanous and fine as possible.    Today a frock the color of a rose had been put on her, and Mariette had  bought some real buds and made her a wreath to wear on her black locks.  She had been learning a new, delightful dance in which she had been  skimming and flying about the room, like a large rose-colored  butterfly, and the enjoyment and exercise had brought a brilliant,  happy glow into her face.    When she entered the room, she floated in with a few of the butterfly  steps--and there sat Becky, nodding her cap sideways off her head.    \"Oh!\" cried Sara, softly, when she saw her.  \"That poor thing!\"    It did not occur to her to feel cross at finding her pet chair occupied  by the small, dingy figure.  To tell the truth, she was quite glad to  find it there.  When the ill-used heroine of her story wakened, she  could talk to her.  She crept toward her quietly, and stood looking at  her.  Becky gave a little snore.    \"I wish she'd waken herself,\" Sara said.  \"I don't like to waken her.  But Miss Minchin would be cross if she found out.  I'll just wait a few  minutes.\"    She took a seat on the edge of the table, and sat swinging her slim,  rose-colored legs, and wondering what it would be best to do. Miss  Amelia might come in at any moment, and if she did, Becky would be sure  to be scolded.    \"But she is so tired,\" she thought.  \"She is so tired!\"    A piece of flaming coal ended her perplexity for her that very moment.  It broke off from a large lump and fell on to the fender. Becky  started, and opened her eyes with a frightened gasp.  She did not know  she had fallen asleep.  She had only sat down for one moment and felt  the beautiful glow--and here she found herself staring in wild alarm at  the wonderful pupil, who sat perched quite near her, like a  rose-colored fairy, with interested eyes.    She sprang up and clutched at her cap.  She felt it dangling over her  ear, and tried wildly to put it straight.  Oh, she had got herself into  trouble now with a vengeance!  To have impudently fallen asleep on such  a young lady's chair!  She would be turned out of doors without wages.    She made a sound like a big breathless sob.    \"Oh, miss!  Oh, miss!\" she stuttered.  \"I arst yer pardon, miss!  Oh, I  do, miss!\"    Sara jumped down, and came quite close to her.    \"Don't be frightened,\" she said, quite as if she had been speaking to a  little girl like herself.  \"It doesn't matter the least bit.\"    \"I didn't go to do it, miss,\" protested Becky.  \"It was the warm  fire--an' me bein' so tired.  It--it WASN'T impertience!\"    Sara broke into a friendly little laugh, and put her hand on her  shoulder.    \"You were tired,\" she said; \"you could not help it.  You are not really  awake yet.\"    How poor Becky stared at her!  In fact, she had never heard such a  nice, friendly sound in anyone's voice before.  She was used to being  ordered about and scolded, and having her ears boxed. And this one--in  her rose-colored dancing afternoon splendor--was looking at her as if  she were not a culprit at all--as if she had a right to be tired--even  to fall asleep!  The touch of the soft, slim little paw on her shoulder  was the most amazing thing she had ever known.    \"Ain't--ain't yer angry, miss?\" she gasped.  \"Ain't yer goin' to tell  the missus?\"    \"No,\" cried out Sara.  \"Of course I'm not.\"    The woeful fright in the coal-smutted face made her suddenly so sorry  that she could scarcely bear it.  One of her queer thoughts rushed into  her mind.  She put her hand against Becky's cheek.    \"Why,\" she said, \"we are just the same--I am only a little girl like  you. It's just an accident that I am not you, and you are not me!\"    Becky did not understand in the least.  Her mind could not grasp such  amazing thoughts, and \"an accident\" meant to her a calamity in which  some one was run over or fell off a ladder and was carried to \"the  'orspital.\"    \"A' accident, miss,\" she fluttered respectfully.  \"Is it?\"    \"Yes,\" Sara answered, and she looked at her dreamily for a moment. But  the next she spoke in a different tone.  She realized that Becky did  not know what she meant.    \"Have you done your work?\" she asked.  \"Dare you stay here a few  minutes?\"    Becky lost her breath again.    \"Here, miss?  Me?\"    Sara ran to the door, opened it, and looked out and listened.    \"No one is anywhere about,\" she explained.  \"If your bedrooms are  finished, perhaps you might stay a tiny while.  I thought--perhaps--you  might like a piece of cake.\"    The next ten minutes seemed to Becky like a sort of delirium.  Sara  opened a cupboard, and gave her a thick slice of cake. She seemed to  rejoice when it was devoured in hungry bites. She talked and asked  questions, and laughed until Becky's fears actually began to calm  themselves, and she once or twice gathered boldness enough to ask a  question or so herself, daring as she felt it to be.    \"Is that--\" she ventured, looking longingly at the rose-colored frock.  And she asked it almost in a whisper.  \"Is that there your best?\"    \"It is one of my dancing-frocks,\" answered Sara.  \"I like it, don't  you?\"    For a few seconds Becky was almost speechless with admiration.  Then  she said in an awed voice, \"Onct I see a princess.  I was standin' in  the street with the crowd outside Covin' Garden, watchin' the swells go  inter the operer.  An' there was one everyone stared at most.  They ses  to each other, 'That's the princess.' She was a growed-up young lady,  but she was pink all over--gownd an' cloak, an' flowers an' all.  I  called her to mind the minnit I see you, sittin' there on the table,  miss.  You looked like her.\"    \"I've often thought,\" said Sara, in her reflecting voice, \"that I  should like to be a princess; I wonder what it feels like. I believe I  will begin pretending I am one.\"    Becky stared at her admiringly, and, as before, did not understand her  in the least.  She watched her with a sort of adoration. Very soon Sara  left her reflections and turned to her with a new question.    \"Becky,\" she said, \"weren't you listening to that story?\"    \"Yes, miss,\" confessed Becky, a little alarmed again.  \"I knowed I  hadn't orter, but it was that beautiful I--I couldn't help it.\"    \"I liked you to listen to it,\" said Sara.  \"If you tell stories, you  like nothing so much as to tell them to people who want to listen. I  don't know why it is.  Would you like to hear the rest?\"    Becky lost her breath again.    \"Me hear it?\" she cried.  \"Like as if I was a pupil, miss!  All about  the Prince--and the little white Mer-babies swimming about  laughing--with stars in their hair?\"    Sara nodded.    \"You haven't time to hear it now, I'm afraid,\" she said; \"but if you  will tell me just what time you come to do my rooms, I will try to be  here and tell you a bit of it every day until it is finished. It's a  lovely long one--and I'm always putting new bits to it.\"    \"Then,\" breathed Becky, devoutly, \"I wouldn't mind HOW heavy the coal  boxes was--or WHAT the cook done to me, if--if I might have that to  think of.\"    \"You may,\" said Sara.  \"I'll tell it ALL to you.\"    When Becky went downstairs, she was not the same Becky who had  staggered up, loaded down by the weight of the coal scuttle. She had an  extra piece of cake in her pocket, and she had been fed and warmed, but  not only by cake and fire.  Something else had warmed and fed her, and  the something else was Sara.    When she was gone Sara sat on her favorite perch on the end of her  table.  Her feet were on a chair, her elbows on her knees, and her chin  in her hands.    \"If I WAS a princess--a REAL princess,\" she murmured, \"I could scatter  largess to the populace.  But even if I am only a pretend princess, I  can invent little things to do for people. Things like this.  She was  just as happy as if it was largess. I'll pretend that to do things  people like is scattering largess.  I've scattered largess.\"        6    The Diamond Mines      Not very long after this a very exciting thing happened. Not only Sara,  but the entire school, found it exciting, and made it the chief subject  of conversation for weeks after it occurred.  In one of his letters  Captain Crewe told a most interesting story. A friend who had been at  school with him when he was a boy had unexpectedly come to see him in  India.  He was the owner of a large tract of land upon which diamonds  had been found, and he was engaged in developing the mines.  If all  went as was confidently expected, he would become possessed of such  wealth as it made one dizzy to think of; and because he was fond of the  friend of his school days, he had given him an opportunity to share in  this enormous fortune by becoming a partner in his scheme.  This, at  least, was what Sara gathered from his letters.  It is true that any  other business scheme, however magnificent, would have had but small  attraction for her or for the schoolroom; but \"diamond mines\" sounded  so like the Arabian Nights that no one could be indifferent.  Sara  thought them enchanting, and painted pictures, for Ermengarde and  Lottie, of labyrinthine passages in the bowels of the earth, where"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14600"],[0,"Theory of Silk Weaving (#8)"],[1,"ting-in is paid for at so much per hundred or thousand  ends, no matter how short or long the warp is, it is a saving to make the  warps as long as possible, especially in raw, black and staple colors.    The calculator must not forget the cost of entering the first warp in a  harness, also the reeding.    Most mills figure the cost of harness and reed in the expense accounts. If  plain and fancy goods are made an extra percentage should be figured for  the latter.                                                                     [Page 102]  EXPENSES are figured differently, as almost every manufacturer has his own  system. If a mill makes only a few staple articles it is easy to put down  the cost of expenses. Say the mill has a production of 500,000 yards per  year, that the expense amounts to $35,000, the cost then is 7 cents per  yard.    Manufacturers making all kinds of goods sometimes figure the expenses in  percentage, say, for plain goods, with a few picks, like gros-grain, peau  de soie, etc., 10 per cent. per yard. Taffeta, satin, etc., having more  picks, 121/2 per cent. per yard, and fancy and jacquard goods, 15 per cent.  per yard. In the expense account we include all charges except raw silk,  throwing, dyeing and piece work.    SELLING EXPENSES. Before a calculation is finished we must add the selling  expenses to the cost, also take account of the trade discount. Small mills  usually sell through a commission house, which pays all expenses and  charges a certain commission. Many large firms have their own selling end,  and some have their sales guaranteed by a commission house or a bank.                                                                     [Page 103]  CALCULATIONS    The prices marked in the following calculations are about as in \"normal  times.\" Absolutely correct piece work prices cannot be given as different  localities have different prices.    Calculations are usually made per 100 yards, 100-meter warps.    Most goods gain from 3 to 7 per cent. in weaving. That is, if we make a  warp of 300 meters for a satin and we obtain 315 yards of cloth, this gain  should not be calculated, as usually there is no account taken of samples  used in the selling department. But the loss in length should be figured  and taken account of on goods with a heavy rib, such as moire, faille, etc.    DISP. 7--A 3 1/3-inch repeat can be obtained with a 600-hook jacquard  machine, seven repeats in a width of 23 inches.    DISP. 8--Taffeta weave, but the two cotton picks must go in one hole. This  article can only be made with at least two shuttle boxes on each side. For  warping use a single and double cross reed, heavy cotton, no knots must be  tied.    DISP. 10--This article must be warped with as much tension as possible and  no knots should be tied in. Silk is to be delivered on bobbins from  throwster.    CANTON CREPE    DISP. 9--Can also be made with Canton silk for filling and may be called  Canton crepe. As Canton silk is much cheaper than Japan, the manufacturer  can use 4-thread Canton instead of 3-thread Japan for filling at a little  difference in cost, thus the cloth will be heavier, but Canton silk is not  as even and clean as Japan.
