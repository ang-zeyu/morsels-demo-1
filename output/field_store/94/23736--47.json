Passing  a quiet street, we saw on the window of one of the houses a bill,  'Apartments, Furnished.'  The situation suited us; we entered the  house, liked the rooms, engaged them by the week,--and left them  the third day.  No power on earth could have reconciled my wife to  stay longer; and I don't wonder at it.\"    \"What did you see?\"    \"Excuse me; I have no desire to be ridiculed as a superstitious  dreamer,--nor, on the other hand, could I ask you to accept on my  affirmation what you would hold to be incredible without the  evidence of your own senses.  Let me only say this, it was not so  much what we saw or heard (in which you might fairly suppose that  we were the dupes of our own excited fancy, or the victims of  imposture in others) that drove us away, as it was an indefinable  terror which seized both of us whenever we passed by the door of a  certain unfurnished room, in which we neither saw nor heard  anything.  And the strangest marvel of all was, that for once in my  life I agreed with my wife, silly woman though she be,--and  allowed, after the third night, that it was impossible to stay a  fourth in that house.  Accordingly, on the fourth morning I  summoned the woman who kept the house and attended on us, and told  her that the rooms did not quite suit us, and we would not stay out  our week.  She said dryly, 'I know why; you have stayed longer than  any other lodger.  Few ever stayed a second night; none before you  a third.  But I take it they have been very kind to you.'    \"'They,--who?' I asked, affecting to smile.    \"'Why, they who haunt the house, whoever they are.  I don't mind  them.  I remember them many years ago, when I lived in this house,  not as a servant; but I know they will be the death of me some day.  I don't care,--I'm old, and must die soon anyhow; and then I shall  be with them, and in this house still.'  The woman spoke with so  dreary a calmness that really it was a sort of awe that prevented  my conversing with her further.  I paid for my week, and too happy  were my wife and I to get off so cheaply.\"    \"You excite my curiosity,\" said I; \"nothing I should like better  than to sleep in a haunted house.  Pray give me the address of the  one which you left so ignominiously.\"    My friend gave me the address; and when we parted, I walked  straight toward the house thus indicated.    It is situated on the north side of Oxford Street, in a dull but  respectable thoroughfare.  I found the house shut up,--no bill at  the window, and no response to my knock.  As I was turning away, a  beer-boy, collecting pewter pots at the neighboring areas, said to  me, \"Do you want any one at that house, sir?\"    \"Yes, I heard it was to be let.\"    \"Let!--why, the woman who kept it is dead,--has been dead these  three weeks, and no one can be found to stay there, though Mr. J----  offered ever so much.  He offered mother, who chars for him, one  pound a week just to open and shut the windows, and she would not.\"    \"Would not!--and why?\"    \"The house is haunted; and the old woman who kept it was found dead  in her bed, with her eyes wide open.  They say the devil strangled  her.\"    \"Pooh!  You speak of Mr. J----.  Is he the owner of the house?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Where does he live?\"    \"In G---- Street, No. --.\"    \"What is he?  In any business?\"    \"No, sir,--nothing particular; a single gentleman.\"    I gave the potboy the gratuity earned by his liberal information,  and proceeded to Mr. J---- , in G---- Street, which was close by  the street that boasted the haunted house.  I was lucky enough to  find Mr. J---- at home,--an elderly man with intelligent  countenance and prepossessing manners.    I communicated my name and my business frankly.  I said I heard the  house was considered to be haunted, that I had a strong desire to  examine a house with so equivocal a reputation; that I should be  greatly obliged if he would allow me to hire it, though only for a  night.  I was willing to pay for that privilege whatever he might  be inclined to ask.  \"Sir,\" said Mr. J----, with great courtesy,  \"the house is at your service, for as short or as long a time as  you please.  Rent is out of the question,--the obligation will be  on my side should you be able to discover the cause of the strange  phenomena which at present deprive it of all value.  I cannot let  it, for I cannot even get a servant to keep it in order or answer  the door.  Unluckily the house is haunted, if I may use that  expression, not only by night, but by day; though at night the  disturbances are of a more unpleasant and sometimes of a more  alarming character.  The poor old woman who died in it three weeks  ago was a pauper whom I took out of a workhouse; for in her  childhood she had been known to some of my family, and had once  been in such good circumstances that she had rented that house of  my uncle.  She was a woman of superior education and strong mind,  and was the only person I could ever induce to remain in the house.  Indeed, since her death, which was sudden, and the coroner's  inquest, which gave it a notoriety in the neighborhood, I have so  despaired of finding any person to take charge of the house, much  more a tenant, that I would willingly let it rent free for a year  to anyone who would pay its rates and taxes.\"    \"How long is it since the house acquired this sinister character?\"    \"That I can scarcely tell you, but very many years since.  The old  woman I spoke of, said it was haunted when she rented it between  thirty and forty years ago.  The fact is, that my life has been  spent in the East Indies, and in the civil service of the Company.  I returned to England last year, on inheriting the fortune of an  uncle, among whose possessions was the house in question.  I found  it shut up and uninhabited.  I was told that it was haunted, that  no one would inhabit it.  I smiled at what seemed to me so idle a  story.  I spent some money in repairing it, added to its old-  fashioned furniture a few modern articles,--advertised it, and  obtained a lodger for a year.  He was a colonel on half pay.  He  came in with his family, a son and a daughter, and four or five  servants: they all left the house the next day; and, although each  of them declared that he had seen something different from that  which had scared the others, a something still was equally terrible  to all.  I really could not in conscience sue, nor even blame, the  colonel for breach of agreement.  Then I put in the old woman I  have spoken of, and she was empowered to let the house in  apartments.  I never had one lodger who stayed more than three  days.  I do not tell you their stories,--to no two lodgers have  there been exactly the same phenomena repeated.  It is better that  you should judge for yourself, than enter the house with an  imagination influenced by previous narratives; only be prepared to  see and to hear something or other, and take whatever precautions  you yourself please.\"    \"Have you never had a curiosity yourself to pass a night in that  house?\"    \"Yes.  I passed not a night, but three hours in broad daylight  alone in that house.  My curiosity is not satisfied, but it is  quenched.  I have no desire to renew the experiment.  You cannot  complain, you see, sir, that I am not sufficiently candid; and  unless your interest be exceedingly eager and your nerves unusually  strong, I honestly add, that I advise you NOT to pass a night in  that house.    \"My interest IS exceedingly keen,\" said I; \"and though only a  coward will boast of his nerves in situations wholly unfamiliar to  him, yet my nerves have been seasoned in such variety of danger  that I have the right to rely on them,--even in a haunted house.\"    Mr. J---- said very little more; he took the keys of the house out  of his bureau, gave them to me,--and, thanking him cordially for  his frankness, and his urbane concession to my wish, I carried off  my prize.    Impatient for the experiment, as soon as I reached home, I summoned  my confidential servant,--a young man of gay spirits, fearless  temper, and as free from superstitious prejudice as anyone I could  think of.    F----,\" said I, \"you remember in Germany how disappointed we were  at not finding a ghost in that old castle, which was said to be  haunted by a headless apparition?  Well, I have heard of a house in  London which, I have reason to hope, is decidedly haunted.  I mean  to sleep there to-night.  From what I hear, there is no doubt that  something will allow itself to be seen or to be heard,--something,  perhaps, excessively horrible.  Do you think if I take you with me,  I may rely on your presence of mind, whatever may happen?\"    \"Oh, sir, pray trust me,\" answered F----, grinning with delight.    \"Very well; then here are the keys of the house,--this is the  address.  Go now,--select for me any bedroom you please; and since  the house has not been inhabited for weeks, make up a good fire,  air the bed well,--see, of course, that there are candles as well  as fuel.  Take with you my revolver and my dagger,--so much for my  weapons; arm yourself equally well; and if we are not a match for a  dozen ghosts, we shall be but a sorry couple of Englishmen.    I was engaged for the rest of the day on business so urgent that I  had not leisure to think much on the nocturnal adventure to which I  had plighted my honor.  I dined alone, and very late, and while  dining, read, as is my habit.  I selected one of the volumes of  Macaulay's Essays.  I thought to myself that I would take the book  with me; there was so much of healthfulness in the style, and  practical life in the subjects, that it would serve as an antidote  against the influences of superstitious fancy.    Accordingly, about half-past nine, I put the book into my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18333"],[0,"The Illustrated War News, Number 15, Nov. 18, 1914 (#8)"],[1,"         _Awarded Gold Medal, International    :                  :             Medical Congress Exhibition, 1913.    :                  :       By Royal Appointment to the Court of Spain_.    :                  :    :                  : This is because Glaxo is enriched milk, made    :                  : germ-free by the Glaxo Process, which also breaks    :                  : down the nourishing curd of the milk into minute,    :                  : easily digested particles.
