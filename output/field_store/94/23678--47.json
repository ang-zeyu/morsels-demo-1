[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17213"],[0,"The Future of Islam (#8)"],[1,"Hakim, a descendant of the house of Abbas, whom  he found living as titular Caliph in Cairo, took to himself the  following style and title: Sultan es Salatin, wa Hakan el Hawakin, Malek  el Bahreyn, wa Hami el Barreyn, Khalifeh Rasul Allah, Emir el Mumenin,  wa Sultan, wa Khan--titles which may be thus interpreted: King of Kings  and Lord of Lords, Monarch of the two seas (the Mediterranean and the  Red Sea), and Protector of the two lands (Hejaz and Syria, the holy  lands of Islam), Successor of the Apostle of God, Prince of the  Faithful, and Emperor. It is said that he first had the satisfaction of  hearing his name mentioned in the public prayers as Caliph when he  visited the great mosque of Zacharias at Aleppo on his return northwards  in 1519.[10]    Such, in a few words, is historically the origin of the modern  Caliphate, and such are the titles now borne by Selim's descendant, Abd  el Hamid. It is difficult at this distance of time, and in the absence  of detailed contemporary narratives, to do more than guess the effect on  Mussulmans of his day of Selim's religious pretensions. To all alike,  friends as well as foes, he must in the first instance have appeared as  an usurper, for before him no man not of the house of Koreysh, and so a  kinsman of their Prophet, had ever claimed to be his spiritual heir.  Indeed, it was a maxim with all schools of theology of all ages that  descent from the Koreysh was the first title to the Caliphate; but we  may reasonably suppose that within the limits of his own dominions, and  even to the mass of the vulgar beyond them, the Ottoman Emperor's  sublime proceedings met with approval.    Selim was a portentous figure in Islam; and the splendour of his  apparition in the north dazzled the eyes of all. Mussulmans must have  seen in him and his house the restorers of their political fortunes and  the champion of their religion against Christendom; and a departure from  established rule in his favour may well have seemed justified to pious  persons as the best hope for the future of their creed. Selim was  already temporal lord of the greater part of Islam, and he might be  expected thus to restore the spiritual sovereignty also. Besides, to the  ears of Mussulmans of the sixteenth century, the Caliphal title was no  longer a familiar sound, and the title of Sultan which Selim already  bore was that of the highest temporal authority they knew.    The Caliphate, if it existed at all, was in the modern world a less  imposing name than the Sultanate; and the two had since the destruction  of Bagdad become confused, as they still remain, in men's minds who do  not any more now make common use of the older title. Thus it was not  difficult for the new Sultan of Damascus and Cairo and Medina to impose  himself on the multitude--not merely as heir to the Caliphal  possessions, but to the title also of the Caliphs and their spiritual  rank. Advantage, too, seems to have been taken in the first instance, as  it has been subsequently, of the accidental resemblance of name between  Othman, Selim's ancestor, and Othman the third Caliph. The vulgar ear  caught the sound as one familiar to it, and was satisfied, for there is  all the world in a name.    With the Ulema, however, it was necessary to be more precise; and we  know that the question of the Ottoman right to the spiritual succession  of the Prophet was one long and hotly debated in the schools. Tradition  was formal on the point of excluding aliens to the Koreysh from this its  legal inheritance, for Mohammed himself had repeatedly distinguished his  own tribe as being the sole heirs to his authority; nor would any doctor  of the specially Arabian schools listen to a departure from ideas so  absolute. The Hanefite school, however, representing those chiefly  interested in accepting the Ottoman pretension, undertook its legal  defence, and succeeded, in spite of the one great obstacle of birth, in  making out a very tolerable case for themselves and the Beni Othman--a  case which, in the absence of any rival candidate to oppose to them, has  since been tacitly accepted by the majority of the Sunite Ulema.    The difficulty, however, was in practice settled by a compromise, and  the dispute itself had long been forgotten by all but the learned, until  within the present generation its arguments were once more dragged out  publicly to serve a political purpose. The Hanefite arguments are on  this account interesting, and I have been at pains to ascertain and  understand them; but perhaps before I state them in detail it will be  best first briefly to run over the Caliphal history of an earlier age  and describe the state of things which Selim's act superseded.    Orthodox Mussulman writers recognize four distinct phases which the  office of Khalifeh has undergone, and four distinct periods of its  history. The word Khalifeh, derived from the Arabic root _khalafa_, to  \"leave behind,\" signifies literally one left behind, and in the legal  sense the relict or successor of the prophet and heir to his temporal  and spiritual power.    The _first_ historical phase noticed is one of pure theocracy, in which  the Caliph or successor of Mohammed was saint as well as priest and  king, and was to a certain extent inspired. It lasted thirty years only,  and is represented by the four great Caliphs--Abu Bekr, Omar, Othman,  and Ali--who receive from the faithful when they speak of them the  title of Seydna, or Our Lord.    The _second_ phase, which lasted nearly six hundred years, is that of  the Arabian monarchy, in which the Caliphate took the shape of  hereditary temporal dominion. Its representatives are neither saints nor  doctors of the law, and stand on a quite different footing from those  who precede them. They begin with Mawiyeh ibn Ommiyah, founder of the  Ommiad dynasty, and end with Mostasem Billah, the last Sultan of the  Abbasides.    The _third_ period is a phase of temporal inter-regnum during which for  nearly three hundred years the Khalifeh exercised no sovereign rights,  and resided as a spiritual chief only, or as we should now say Sheykh el  Islam, at Cairo. The temporal authority of Islam, which is theoretically  supposed to have been continued without break even during this period,  was then in delegation with the Memluk Sultans of Egypt and other  Mussulman princes.    The _last_ phase is that of the Ottoman Caliphate.    As nearly all modern arguments respecting the Caliphate appeal to  examples in the earliest period, it will be well to consider the origin  of its institution and the political basis of Islam itself. Mohammedan  doctors affirm that the Apostle of God, Mohammed (on whose name be  peace), when he fled from Mecca, did so not as a rebellious citizen but  as a pretender to authority. He was by birth a prince of the princely  house of the Koreysh, itself the noblest tribe of Hejaz, and his  grandfather had been supreme ruler in Mecca. He established himself,  therefore, with his companions in exile as head of an independent  political community, following in this the ancient custom of Arabia  where sections constantly cut themselves off from the parent tribe and  form new nations under the separate leadership of one or another member  of their princely families. Islam, therefore, was from its commencement  a political as well as a religious body, and while Mohammed preached to  his disciples as a prophet, he also gave laws to them as their king and  governor. He was their Imam, the leader of their prayer, and he was  their Emir and Kadi, prince and magistrate. Thus the supreme temporal  and spiritual authority became linked, and Islam was from its beginning  a nation no less than a church.    As long as Mohammed lived, this state of things remained unquestioned,  and difficulties began only at his death. It is a point which has been  much disputed what were the prophet's intentions regarding this event.  In early times the sect of Ali maintained that he had appointed his  son-in-law his heir, and others have held that Abu Bekr had the  nomination; but Sunites are now mostly agreed that no individual  appointment was made, and that the choice of a successor was left to be  decided by election. In any case the procedure followed by Mohammed's  bereaved followers was elective, and its details were in strict  accordance with that Arabian custom on which the Koranic law is mainly  built.    Now, in an Arab tribe, when the Sheykh dies, the elders of the tribe,  heads of its great houses and sections, assemble in one of their  number's tent and, sitting in a circle, discuss the subject of his  succession. Theoretically, the choice of a successor is open to any one  of them, for the tribe, however large, is all one great family,  descended from a common ancestor, and though no one from without could  be admitted to the supreme rule, any one from within the tribe can hold  office. But in practice the choice is limited to a few persons. The  reverence of the Arabs for blood, and for selected strains of blood,  prevent them, except in very exceptional cases, from changing the  dynasty of their rulers. If the dead man has left behind him a son of  full age and respectable qualities, he will, without dispute, be  acknowledged Sheykh. If not, an uncle, a nephew, or a cousin will be  chosen. Only in extreme circumstances of general danger, or of failure  of heirs male, can the member of a new family reasonably aspire to  power. Moreover, there is no uniform law of election. The meeting does  not pretend to give a right, only to confirm one; for the right lies not  with the electors but with him who can maintain his election. There is,  therefore, no formal system of voting, but the elders having ascertained  who among the dead man's relations commands the strongest following,  proceed to acknowledge him by the ceremony of giving him their hands. He  then becomes their Sheykh.

Here is  Realism, frank and straightforward, almost defiant in its strength. Turn  to the portrait of _A Jewish Rabbi_. Here is Idealism. You peer and peer,  and from the brown background emerges a brown garment, relieved by the  black cap, and the black cloak that falls over his left shoulder. Luminous  black and luminous brown! Brown is the side of the face in shadow, brown is  the brow in shadow. All is tributary to the glory of the golden brown on  the lighted portion of the face. The portrait composes into a perfect  whole. The dim blacks and browns lead up to the golden brown illuminating  the old weary head, that wonderful golden brown--the secret of Rembrandt.  This old Jew lives through the magic art of Rembrandt. He crouches in the  frame, wistful and waiting, the eternal type, eternally dreaming the Jews'  dream that is still a dream.
