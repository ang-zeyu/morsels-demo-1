Hommel       believes that the country of Khamanu was the Amanos in       Cilicia, and he admits, but unwillingly, that Assur-nazir-       pal made a detour beyond the Euphrates. I should look for       Shura, and consequently for Khamanu, in the Tur-Abdin, and       should identify them with Saur, in spite of the difference       of the two initial articulations.    However high we may rate the value of this campaign, it was eclipsed by  the following one. The Aramaeans on the Khabur and the middle Euphrates  had not witnessed without anxiety the revival of Ninevite activity,  and had begged for assistance against it from its rival. Two of their  principal tribes, the Sukhi and the Laqi, had addressed themselves to  the sovereign then reigning at Babylon. He was a restless, ambitious  prince, named Nabu-baliddin, who asked nothing better than to excite a  hostile feeling against his neighbour, provided he ran no risk by his  interference of being drawn into open warfare. He accordingly despatched  to the Prince of Sukhi the best of his Cossoan troops, commanded by  his brother Zabdanu and one of the great officers of the crown,  Bel-baliddin. In the spring of 879 B.C., Assur-nazir-pal determined once  for all to put an end to these intrigues. He began by inspecting the  citadels flanking the line of the Kharmish* and the Khabur,--Tabiti,**  Magarisi,*** Shadikanni, Shuru in Bit-Khafupi, and Sirki.****         * The Kharmish has been identified with the Hirmas, the       river flowing by Nisibis, and now called the Nahr-Jaghjagha.         ** Tabiti is the Thebeta (Thebet) of Roman itineraries and       Syrian writers, situated 33 miles from Nisibis and 52 from       Singara, on the Nahr-Hesawy or one of the neighbouring       wadys.         *** Magarisi ought to be found on the present Nahr-       Jaghjagha, near its confluence with the Nahr-Jerrahi and its       tributaries; unfortunately, this part of Mesopotamia is       still almost entirely unexplored, and no satisfactory map of       it exists as yet.         **** Sirki is Circesium at the mouth of the Khabur.    Between the embouchures of the Khabur and the Balikh, the Euphrates  winds across a vast table-land, ridged with marly hills; the left bank  is dry and sterile, shaded at rare intervals by sparse woods of poplars  or groups of palms. The right bank, on the contrary, is seamed with  fertile valleys, sufficiently well watered to permit the growth of  cereals and the raising of cattle. The river-bed is almost everywhere  wide, but strewn with dangerous rocks and sandbanks which render  navigation perilous. On nearing the ruins of Halebiyeh, the river  narrows as it enters the Arabian hills, and cuts for itself a regular  defile of three or four hundred paces in length, which is approached by  the pilots with caution.*         * It is at this defile of El-Hammeh, and not at that of       Birejik at the end of the Taurus, that we must place the       _Khinqi sha Purati_--the narrows of the Euphrates--so often       mentioned in the account of this campaign.    Assur-nazir-pal, on leaving Sirki, made his way along the left bank,  levying toll on Supri, Naqarabani, and several other villages in his  course. Here and there he called a halt facing some town on the opposite  bank, but the boats which could have put him across had been removed,  and the fords were too well guarded to permit of his hazarding an  attack. One town, however, Khindanu, made him a voluntary offering  which, he affected to regard as a tribute, but Kharidi and Anat appeared  not even to suspect his presence in their vicinity, and he continued  on his way without having obtained from them anything which could be  construed into a mark of vassalage.*         * The detailed narrative of the _Annals_ informs us that       Assur-nazir-pal encamped on a mountain between Khindanu and       Bit-Shabaia, and this information enables us to determine on       the map with tolerable certainty the localities mentioned in       this campaign. The mountain in question can be none other       than El-Hammeh, the only one met with on this bank of the       Euphrates between the confluents of the Euphrates and the       Khabur. Khindanu is therefore identical with the ruins of       Tabus, the Dabausa of Ptolemy; hence Supri and Naqabarani       are situated between this point and Sirki, the former in the       direction of Tayebeh, the latter towards El-Hoseiniyeh. On       the other hand, the ruins of Kabr Abu-Atish would correspond       very well to Bit-Shabaia: is the name of Abu-Sbe borne by       the Arabs of that neighbourhood a relic of that of Shabaia.       Kharidi ought in that case to be looked for on the opposite       bank, near Abu-Suban and Aksubi, where Chesney points out       ancient remains. A day's march beyond Kabr Abu-Atish brings       us to El-Khass, so that the town of Anat would be in the       Isle of Moglah. Shuru must be somewhere near one of the two       Tell-Menakhirs on this side the Balikh.    [Illustration: 044.jpg THE CAMPAIGNS OF ASSUR-NAZIR-PAL IN MESOPOTAMIA]    At length, on reaching Shuru, Shadadu, the Prince of Sukhi, trusting  in his Cossoans, offered him battle; but he was defeated by  Assur-na'zir-pal, who captured the King of Babylon's brother, forced  his way into the town after an assault lasting two days, and returned to  Assyria laden with spoil. This might almost be considered as a repulse;  for no sooner had the king quitted the country than the Aramaeans in  their turn crossed the Euphrates and ravaged the plains of the Khabur.*  Assur-nazir-pal resolved not to return until he was in a position  to carry his arms into the heart of the enemy's country. He built  a flotilla at Shuru in Bit-Khalupi on which he embarked his troops.  Wherever the navigation of the Euphrates proved to be difficult, the  boats were drawn up out of the water and dragged along the banks over  rollers until they could again be safely launched; thus, partly afloat  and partly on land, they passed through the gorge of Halebiyeh, landed  at Kharidi, and inflicted a salutary punishment on the cities which had  defied the king's wrath on his last expedition. Khindanu, Kharidi, and  Kipina were reduced to ruins, and the Sukhi and the Laqi defeated, the  Assyrians pursuing them for two days in the Bisuru mountains as far as  the frontiers of Bit-Adini.**         * The _Annals_ do not give us either the _limmu_ or the date       of the year for this new expedition. The facts taken       altogether prove that it was a continuation of the preceding       one, and it may therefore be placed in the year B.C. 878.         ** The campaign of B.C. 878 had for its arena that of the       Euphrates which lies between the Khabur and the Balikh; this       time, however, the principal operations took place on the       right bank. If Mount Bisuru is the Jebel-Bishri, the town of       Kipina, which is mentioned between it and Kharidi, ought to       be located between Maidan and Sabkha.    A complete submission was brought about, and its permanency secured  by the erection of two strongholds, one of which, Kar-assur-nazir-pal,  commanded the left, and the other, Nibarti-assur, the right bank of the  Euphrates.*    This last expedition had brought the king into contact with the most  important of the numerous Aramaean states congregated in the western  region of Mesopotamia. This was Bit-Adini, which lay on both sides of  the middle course of the Euphrates.** It included, on the right bank, to  the north of Carchemish, between the hills on the Sajur and Araban-Su, a  mountainous but fertile district, dotted over with towns and fortresses,  the names of some of which have been preserved--Pakarrukhbuni, Sursunu,  Paripa, Dabigu, and Shitamrat.*** Tul-Barsip, the capital, was situated  on the left bank, commanding the fords of the modern Birejik,****  and the whole of the territory between this latter and the Balikh  acknowledged the rule of its princes, whose authority also extended  eastwards as far as the basaltic plateau of Tul-Aba, in the Mesopotamian  desert.         * The account in the Annals is confused, and contains       perhaps some errors with regard to the facts. The site of       the two towns is nowhere indicated, but a study of the map       shows that the Assyrians could not become masters of the       country without occupying the passes of the Euphrates; I am       inclined to think that Kar-assur-nazir-pal is El-Halebiyeh,       and Nibarti-assur, Zalebiyeh, the Zenobia of Roman times.         ** Bit-Adini appears to have occupied, on the right bank of       the Euphrates, a part of the cazas of Ain-Tab, Rum-kaleh,       and Birejik, that of Suruji, minus the nakhiyeh of Harran,       the larger part of the cazas of Membij and of Rakkah, and       part of the caza of Zor, the cazas being those represented       on the maps of Vital Cuinet.         *** None of these localities can be identified with       certainty, except perhaps Dabigu, a name we may trace in       that of the modern village of Dehbek.         **** Tul-Barsip has been identified with Birejik.    To the south-east, Bit-Adini bordered upon the country of the Sukhi and  the Laqi,* lying to the east of Assyria; other principalities, mainly of  Aramoan origin, formed its boundary to the north and north-west--Shugab  in the bend of the Euphrates, from Birejik to Samosata,** Tul-Abni  around Edessa,*** the district of Harran,**** Bit-Zamani, Izalla in  the Tektek-dagh and on the Upper Khabur, and Bit-Bakhiani in the plain  extending from the Khabur to the Kharmish.^         * In his previous campaign Assur-nazir-pal had taken two       towns of Bit-Adini, situated on the right bank of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17328"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 8 (of 12) (#8)"],[1,"have been so aggressive as to arouse  serious anxiety in the minds of the Ninevite rulers; it is certain  that Sennacherib, though apparently hindered by no revolt, delayed the  execution of the projects he had formed against Merodach-baladan for  three years; and it is possible his inaction may be attributed to the  fear of some complication arising on his north-western frontier. He did  not carry out his scheme till 695 B.C., when all danger in that quarter  had passed away. The enterprise was a difficult one, for Nagitu and  the neighbouring districts were dependencies of Susa, and could not be  reached by land without a violation of Blamite neutrality, which would  almost inevitably lead to a conflict. Shutruk-nakhunta was no longer  alive. In the very year in which his rival had set up Assur-nadin-shumu  as King of Karduniash, a revolution had broken out in Elam, which was in  all probability connected with the events then taking place in Babylon.  His subjects were angry with him for having failed to send timely  succour to his allies the Kalda, and for having allowed Bit-Yakin to be  destroyed: his own brother Khalludush sided with the malcontents, threw  Shutruk-nakhunta into prison, and proclaimed himself king. This time the  Ninevites, thinking that Elam was certain to intervene, sought how they  might finally overpower Merodach-baladan before this interference  could prove effectual. The feudal constitution of the Blamite monarchy  rendered, as we know, the mobilisation of the army at the opening of  a war a long and difficult task: weeks might easily elapse before the  first and second grades of feudatory nobility could join the royal  troops and form a combined army capable of striking an important  blow. This was a cause of dangerous inferiority in a conflict with the  Assyrians, the chief part of whose forces, bivouacking close to the  capital during the winter months, could leave their quarters and set  out on a campaign at little more than a day's notice; the kings of Elam  minimised the danger by keeping sufficient troops under arms on their  northern and western frontiers to meet any emergency, but an attack by  sea seemed to them so unlikely that they had not, for a long time past,  thought of protecting their coast-line. The ancient Chaldaean cities,  Uru, Bagash, Uruk, and Bridu had possessed fleets on the Persian Gulf;  but the times were long past when they used to send to procure stone and  wood from the countries of Magan and Melukhkha, and the seas which they  had ruled were now traversed only by merchant vessels or fishing-boats.  Besides this, the condition of the estuary seemed to prohibit all attack  from that side. The space between Bit-Yakin and the long line of dunes  or mud-banks which blocked the entrance to it was not so much a gulf as  a lagoon of uncertain and shifting extent; the water flowed only in  the middle, being stagnant near the shores; the whole expanse was  irregularly dotted over with mud-banks, and its service was constantly  altered by the alluvial soil brought down by the Tigris, the Euphrates,  the Ulai, and the Uknu. The navigation of this lagoon was dangerous,  for the relative positions of the channels and shallows were constantly  shifting, and vessels of deep draught often ran aground in passing from  one end of it to the other.*         * The condition I describe here is very similar to what       Alexander's admirals found 350 years later. Arrian has       preserved for us the account of Nearchus' navigation in       these waters, and his description shows such a well-defined       condition of the estuary that its main outline must have       remained unchanged for a considerable time; the only       subsequent alterations which had taken place must have been       in the internal configuration, where the deposit of alluvium       must have necessarily reduced the area of the lake since the       time of Sennacherib. The little map on the next page has no       pretension to scientific exactitude; its only object is to       show roughly what the estuary of the Euphrates was like, and       to illustrate approximately the course of the Assyrian       expedition.    [Illustration: 048.jpg MAP THE NAR-MARRATUM IN THE TIME OF SENNACHERIB]    Sennacherib decided to march his force to the mouth of the Euphrates,  and, embarking it there, to bring it to bear suddenly on the portion  of Elamite territory nearest to Nagitu: if all went well, he would thus  have time to crush the rising power of Merodach-baladan and regain his  own port of departure before Khalludush could muster a sufficient army  to render efficient succour to his vassal.    More than a year was consumed in preparations. The united cities of  Chaldaea being unable to furnish the transports required to convey such  a large host across the Nar-Marratum, it was necessary to construct  a fleet, and to do so in such a way that the enemy should have no  suspicion of danger. Sennacherib accordingly set up his dockyards at  Tul-barsip on the Euphrates and at Nineveh on the Tigris, and Syrian  shipwrights built him a fleet of vessels after two distinct types.  Some were galleys identical in build and equipment with those which the  Mediterranean natives used for their traffic with distant lands. The  others followed the old Babylonian model, with stem and stern both  raised, the bows being sometimes distinguished by the carving of a  horse's head, which justified the name of _sea-horse_ given to a vessel  of this kind. They had no masts, but propelling power was provided  by two banks of oars one above the other, as in the galleys. The two  divisions of the fleet were ready at the beginning of 694 B.C., and  it was arranged that they should meet at Bit-Dakkuri, to the south of  Babylon.    [Illustration: 049.jpg THE FLEET OF SENNACHERIB ON THE NAR-MARRATUM]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Layard.    The fleet from Tul-barsip had merely to descend the Euphrates to reach  the meeting-place,* but that from Nineveh had to make a more complicated  journey.         * The story of the preparations, as it has been transmitted       to us in Sennacherib's inscriptions, is curiously similar to       the accounts given by the Greek historians of the vessels       Alexander had built at Babylon and Thap-sacus by Phoenician       workmen, which descended the Euphrates to join the fleet in       the Persian Gulf. This fleet consisted of quinquiremos,       according to Aristobulus, who was present at their       construction: Quintus-Curtius makes them all vessels with       seven banks of oars, but he evidently confuses the galleys       built at Thapsacus with those which came in sections from       Phoenicia and which Alexander had put together at Babylon.    By following the course of the Tigris to its mouth it would have had  to skirt the coast of Elam for a considerable distance, and would  inevitably have aroused the suspicions of Khalludush; the passage of  such a strong squadron must have revealed to him the importance of the  enterprise, and put him on his guard. The vessels therefore stayed their  course at Upi, where they were drawn ashore and transported on rollers  across the narrow isthmus which separates the Tigris from the Arakhtu  canal, on which they were then relaunched. Either the canal had not been  well kept, or else it never had the necessary depth at certain places;  but the crews managed to overcome all obstacles and rejoined their  comrades in due time. Sennacherib was ready waiting for them with all  his troops--foot-soldiers, charioteers, and horsemen--and with supplies  of food for the men, and of barley and oats for the horses; as soon as  the last contingent had arrived, he gave the signal for departure, and  all advanced together, the army marching along the southern bank, the  fleet descending the current, to the little port of Bab-Salimeti, some  twelve miles below the mouth of the river.*         * The mouth of the Euphrates being at that time not far from       the site of Kornah, Bab-Salimeti, which was about twelve       miles distant, must have been somewhere near the present       village of Abu-Hatira, on the south bank of the river.    There they halted in order to proceed to the final embarcation, but at  the last moment their inexperience of the sea nearly compromised the  success of the expedition. Even if they were not absolutely ignorant of  the ebb and flow of the tide, they certainly did not know how dangerous  the spring tide could prove at the equinox under the influence of a  south wind. The rising tide then comes into conflict with the volume  of water brought down by the stream, and in the encounter the banks are  broken down, and sometimes large districts are inundated: this is what  happened that year, to the terror of the Assyrians. Their camp was  invaded and completely flooded by the waves; the king and his soldiers  took refuge in haste on the galleys, where they were kept prisoners  for five days \"as in a huge cage.\" As soon as the waters abated, they  completed their preparations and started on their voyage. At the point  where the Euphrates enters the lagoon, Sennacherib pushed forward to the  front of the line, and, standing in the bows of his flag-ship, offered a  sacrifice to Ea, the god of the Ocean. Having made a solemn libation, he  threw into the water a gold model of a ship, a golden fish, and an  image of the god himself, likewise in gold; this ceremony performed, he  returned to the port of Bab-Salimeti with his guard, while the bulk  of his forces continued their voyage eastward. The passage took place  without mishap, but they could not disembark on the shore of the  gulf itself, which was unapproachable by reason of the deposits of  semi-liquid mud which girdled it; they therefore put into the mouth  of the Ulai, and ascended the river till they reached a spot where the  slimy reed-beds gave place to firm ground, which"]]]
