L.--GOD IS NOT MADE FOR MAN, NOR MAN FOR GOD.    If God is infinite, He is created still less for man, than man is for  the ants. Would the ants of a garden reason pertinently with reference  to the gardener, if they should attempt to occupy themselves with his  intentions, his desires, and his projects? Would they reason correctly  if they pretended that the park of Versailles was made but for them, and  that a fastidious monarch had had as his only object to lodge them  superbly? But according to theology, man in his relation to God is far  beneath what the lowest insect is to man. Thus by the acknowledgment of  theology itself, theology, which does but occupy itself with the  attributes and views of Divinity, is the most complete of follies.          LI.--IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THE OBJECT OF THE FORMATION OF THE UNIVERSE WAS  TO RENDER MEN HAPPY.    It is pretended, that in forming the universe, God had no object but to  render man happy. But, in a world created expressly for him and governed  by an all-mighty God, is man after all very happy? Are his enjoyments  durable? Are not his pleasures mingled with sufferings? Are there many  people who are contented with their fate? Is not mankind the continual  victim of physical and moral evils? This human machine, which is shown  to us as the masterpiece of the Creator's industry, has it not a  thousand ways of deranging itself? Would we admire the skill of a  mechanic, who should show us a complicated machine, liable to be out of  order at any moment, and which would after a while destroy itself?          LII.--WHAT IS CALLED PROVIDENCE IS BUT A WORD VOID OF SENSE.    We call Providence the generous care which Divinity shows in providing  for our needs, and in watching over the happiness of its beloved  creatures. But, as soon as we look around, we find that God provides for  nothing. Providence neglects the greatest part of the inhabitants of  this world. Against a very small number of men, who are supposed to be  happy, what a multitude of miserable ones are groaning beneath  oppression, and languishing in misery! Whole nations are compelled to  starve in order to indulge the extravagances of a few morose tyrants,  who are no happier than the slaves whom they oppress! At the same time  that our philosophers energetically parade the bounties of Providence,  and exhort us to place confidence in it, do we not see them cry out at  unforeseen catastrophes, by which Providence plays with the vain  projects of men; do we not see that it overthrows their designs, laughs  at their efforts, and that its profound wisdom pleases itself in  misleading mortals? But how can we place confidence in a malicious  Providence which laughs at and sports with mankind? How can I admire the  unknown course of a hidden wisdom whose manner of acting is inexplicable  to me? Judge it by its effects! you will say; it is by these I do judge  it, and I find that these effects are sometimes useful and sometimes  injurious to me.    We think to justify Providence by saying, that in this world there are  more blessings than evil for each individual man. Let us suppose that  the blessings which this Providence makes us enjoy are as one hundred,  and that the evils are as ten per cent.; would it not always result that  against these hundred degrees of goodness, Providence possesses a tenth  degree of malignity?--which is incompatible with the perfection we  suppose it to have.    All the books are filled with the most flattering praises of Providence,  whose attentive care is extolled; it would seem to us, as if in order to  live happy here below, man would have no need of exerting himself.  However, without labor, man could scarcely live a day. In order to live,  I see him obliged to sweat, work, hunt, fish, toil without relaxation;  without these secondary causes, the First Cause (at least in the  majority of countries) could provide for none of his needs. If I examine  all parts of this globe, I see the uncivilized as well as the civilized  man in a perpetual struggle with Providence; he is compelled to ward off  the blows which it sends in the form of hurricanes, tempests, frost,  hail, inundations, sterility, and the divers accidents which so often  render all their labors useless. In a word, I see the human race  continually occupied in protecting itself from the wicked tricks of this  Providence, which is said to be busy with the care of their happiness. A  devotee admired Divine Providence for having wisely made rivers to flow  through all the places where men had built large cities. Is not this  man's way of reasoning as sensible as that of many learned men who do  not cease from telling us of Final Causes, or who pretend to perceive  clearly the benevolent views of God in the formation of things?          LIII.--THIS PRETENDED PROVIDENCE IS LESS OCCUPIED IN CONSERVING THAN IN  DISTURBING THE WORLD--MORE AN ENEMY THAN A FRIEND OF MAN.    Do we see, then, that Divine Providence manifests itself in a sensible  manner in the conservation of its admirable works, for which we honor  it? If it is Divine Providence which governs the world, we find it as  much occupied in destroying as in creating; in exterminating as in  producing. Does it not at every instant cause thousands of those same  men to perish, to whose preservation and well-being it is supposed to  give its continual attention? Every moment it loses sight of its beloved  creatures; sometimes it tears down their dwellings; sometimes it  destroys their harvests, inundates their fields, devastates by a  drought, arms all nature against man, sets man against man, and finishes  by causing him to expire in pain. Is this what you call preserving a  universe? If we attempted to consider without prejudice the equivocal  conduct of Providence relative to mankind and to all sentient beings, we  should find that very far from resembling a tender and careful mother,  it rather resembles those unnatural mothers who, forgetting the  unfortunate fruits of their illicit amours, abandon their children as  soon as they are born; and who, pleased to have conceived them, expose  them without mercy to the caprices of fate.    The Hottentots--wiser in this particular than other nations, who treat  them as barbarians--refuse, it is said, to adore God, because if He  sometimes does good, He as often does harm. Is not this reasoning more  just and more conformed to experience than that of so many men who  persist in seeing in their God but kindness, wisdom, and foresight; and  who refuse to see that the countless evils, of which the world is the  theater, must come from the same Hand which they kiss with transport?          LIV.--NO! THE WORLD IS NOT GOVERNED BY AN INTELLIGENT BEING.    The logic of common sense teaches us that we should judge a cause but by  its effects. A cause can not be reputed as constantly good, except when  it constantly produces good, useful, and agreeable effects. A cause  which produces good at one time, and evil at another, is a cause which  is sometimes good and sometimes bad. But the logic of Theology destroys  all this. According to it, the phenomena of nature, or the effects which  we see in this world, prove to us the existence of an infinitely good  Cause, and this Cause is God. Although this world is full of evils,  although disorder reigns here very often, although men groan every  moment under the fate which oppresses them, we ought to be convinced  that these effects are due to a benevolent and immutable Cause; and many  people believe it, or pretend to believe it!    Everything which takes place in the world proves to us in the clearest  way that it is not governed by an intelligent being. We can judge of the  intelligence of a being but by the means which he employs to accomplish  his proposed design. The aim of God, it is said, is the happiness of our  race; however, the same necessity regulates the fate of all sentient  beings--which are born to suffer much, to enjoy little, and to die. Man's  cup is full of joy and of bitterness; everywhere good is side by side  with evil; order is replaced by disorder; generation is followed by  destruction. If you tell me that the designs of God are mysteries, and  that His views are impossible to understand, I will answer, that in this  case it is impossible for me to judge whether God is intelligent.          LV.--GOD CAN NOT BE CALLED IMMUTABLE.    You pretend that God is immutable! But what is it that occasions the  continual instability in this world, which you claim as His empire? Is  any state subject to more frequent and cruel revolutions than that of  this unknown monarch? How can we attribute to an immutable God, powerful  enough to give solidity to His works, the government of a world where  everything is in a continual vicissitude? If I think to see a God  unchanging in all the effects advantageous to my kind, what God can I  discover in the continual misfortunes by which my kind is oppressed? You  tell me that it is our sins that force Him to punish us. I will answer  that God, according to yourselves, is not immutable, because the sins of  men compel Him to change His conduct in regard to them. Can a being who  is sometimes irritated, and sometimes appeased, be constantly the same?          LVI.--EVIL AND GOOD ARE THE NECESSARY EFFECTS OF NATURAL CAUSES. WHAT IS  A GOD WHO CAN CHANGE NOTHING?    The universe is but what it can be; all sentient beings enjoy and suffer  here: that is to say, they are moved sometimes in an agreeable, and at  other times in a disagreeable way. These effects are necessary; they  result from causes that act according to their inherent tendencies.,  These effects necessarily please or displease me, according to my own  nature. This same nature compels me to avoid, to remove, and to combat  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17615"],[0,"In Search of the Okapi (#8)"],[1," the skipper, \"back her, or by the Lord I'll  fling you in as well.\"    \"Fetch the rifles,\" said Compton to Venning.    A moment later the two boys stood at the ready with their rifles,  and amid a babel of cries the skipper signaled \"Stop her.\" The  steamer slowed up, swung gently round, and shaped back to where  three dark spots showed.    \"There are four,\" cried Venning, at his first swift glance; \"and one  is a crocodile. It is making for the jackal.\"    \"Take the wheel, Compton,\" said Mr. Hume, quite calm again. \"Give me  your gun, Venning.\"    The hunter, with the gun, went to the side and looked over. Nearest  him was the man he had thrown overboard;  beyond was the jackal,  making a great splashing; and further on was the face of Muata, who  was crying out encouragement to his faithful companion as he swam  swiftly towards it; and to the left, moving rapidly towards the  jackal, was the crocodile, swimming in a great swirl, with only his  eyes showing, and the end of his snout. The hunter steadied himself  with a shoulder against a stanchion, and then, without hurry or  excitement, and after a look round the deck at the people, to see if  there was any further mischief brewing, took deliberate aim and  fired.    A shout went up, and the very people who had a minute before been so  hostile, now were abject in their praise of Mr. Hume, for the  crocodile span round and round in answer to the shot.    \"Stand by with a rope, Mr. Compton,\" cried the hunter, taking  command as if by right; and Compton obeyed promptly, but without  excitement.    The first man caught the line and swarmed up wet, but subdued in  spirit, casting an appealing glance at his late assailant. Muata, in  the mean time, reached the half-drowned jackal, held it by the  scruff of the neck with one hand, and, turning over on his back,  waited for the rope. This flung and seized, he also climbed on  board, but there was nothing abject in his appearance. Standing with  his head thrown back and his nostrils quivering, he glared a moment  at the group of natives; then, seizing a bar of iron, he made a  bound forward, uttering a wild war-whoop.    There would have been bloodshed had not Mr. Hume, with surprising  quietness, flung himself forward and seized the chief round the  waist.    Compton, cool and ready, wrenched the bar away; and, seeing this,  the natives plucked up spirit, calling on the white man to throw the  \"black dog\" to the crocodiles, which had been attracted by the blood  of their wounded fellow, still beating the water in his flurry.    Venning, however, stepped between with his rifle, and the uproar  ceased once more.    \"Now,\" said Mr. Hume, holding the chief by his arm, \"what does this  mean? What harm have those men done you?\"    \"My father has the lion's grip. Mawoh! Muata was a babe in his  arms.\"    \"That may be, but it is no answer.\"    \"What harm! Did not my father hear the jackal give tongue?\"    \"I heard; and those jackals there\"--indicating the watching group--  \"yelped at me, so that I flung one into the water. But--what then?  Do you seek to slay when your beast howls?\"    \"My father does not know, then.\"    \"I want to know, for it seems to me you were all mad together.\"    \"Ohe! it is the madness that slays. Ask of those mudfish there for  news of the man who stood behind them to slay Muata, who had the gun  aimed to shoot when Muata leapt into the water. Ask them, and they  will lie.\"    \"What manner of man was this?\"    \"One of those who hound me in the canoe--even one of the man-hunters  who seized my mother.\"    Mr. Hume looked at the boys. \"Did either of you see an Arab on  board? Muata says a man was about to fire at him when he sprang  overboard.\"    \"I thought he fell,\" said Compton. \"I saw no one with a gun.\"    \"Nor I,\" said Venning; \"but the Arab may have gone below.\"    Mr. Hume hailed the captain. \"My man said an attempt was made on his  life. Have you taken an Arab onboard?\"    \"I have some mad English on board,\" said the captain, gruffly; \"and  I will see they do not stay on longer than I can help.\"    \"As to that we will see.\"    The captain nodded his head and signaled full speed ahead, turning  his back on the Englishman.    \"I think we can manage the lot,\" said Compton, coolly.    Mr. Hume laughed. \"Perhaps so; but it would be very awkward to be  detained at the next station as prisoners, or to be sent back. We  must let the matter slide.\"    \"Shall we search the ship, sir?\"    Mr. Hume shook his head. \"Suppose we found some suspicious  passenger. What then? There was no actual attempt on Muata, and we  have only his word; besides\"--and he glanced at the angry captain--  \"there is no need to look for trouble--it will come.\"    He was right. At the next station, reached within a few hours, the  captain lodged a complaint to the  authorities in the persons of the  Belgian officials, who  were evidently charmed with the opportunity  of teaching the Englishmen a lesson.    First of all, they placed Muata in chains straight away on their  finding that he was a dangerous person. When Mr. Hume protested,  they placed him under restraint; and that done, they pronounced  judgment. The English would pay a fine of Pounds 100, surrender  their weapons, and return to Banana Point by the next steamer down.    \"Is that all?\"    \"That is all. But stay. As you will be possibly detained a  fortnight, there would be a charge for  maintenance.\"    \"Be good enough,\" said Mr. Hume, producing a document,  \"to read  that paper. It is a passport from the President of the Congo State--  your king--authorizing Mr. Hume and party to proceed with his  servants by land or water anywhere within the State for purposes of  exploration.\"    The officers examined the document with sour faces, and one of them  made an observation in a low tone.    \"Precisely,\" said the other.  \"This document,\" he remarked, turning  to Mr. Hume, \"is not in order. It has not been visaed by the  officers at the sub-stations.\"    \"But it was initialed by your superior at the coast.\"    \"It must go back to the sub-stations for endorsement.\"    Mr. Hume put a restraint on his temper. \"And how long will that  take?\"    \"Who knows? Perhaps a month.\"    \"And in the mean time?\"    \"In the mean time, m'sieur, you will remain our guests.\"    \"Is there no other way?\"    \"Monsieur must surrender himself to the unpleasant delay. There is  no other way.\"  \"Unless--but m'sieur would not perhaps face the  expense.\"    \"Explain, gentlemen.\"    \"There is a special transport for State business, but to call upon  the service for other than State purpose there would be a charge of  ten pounds per day.\"    \"I see.\" Mr. Hume saw that these gentlemen wished to make money out  of him. \"Very good. I will myself go to the sub-stations by your  special transport, and if the Governor says the charge is  reasonable, I will pay on my return. I think that will meet the  matter.\"    But it did not at all meet the matter, and the junior officer at  once informed his senior that unhappily the special transport had  that very morning developed a leak in the boiler.    There followed an embarrassing delay. The authorities waited for Mr.  Hume to make a business-like proposal, but the hunter remained  grimly silent. The two officers whispered.    \"Observe, m'sieur,\" said the senior, clearing his throat, \"my  colleague suggests a middle way. If you will place sum demanded by  the State in these cases, in the nature of a surety for good faith,  we may permit you and your friends to proceed.\"    \"My servant also?\"    \"Your servant?\"    \"The man you have bound.\"    \"Ohe! Pardon, m'sieur; you are not aware that he is an offender  against the laws--a notorious criminal. He will be detained and  tried.\"    \"I will remain to attend his trial, unless a sum will secure his  freedom also?\"    \"There is a price on his bead.\"    \"Offered by the slave-hunters?\"    The shot went home. The officers had been hand in glove with the  lawless traders, but they did not want the matter bruited about by  meddlesome Englishmen. They scowled.    \"He has broken the peace,\" said the senior, sharply; \"he has slain  the servants of the State. Am I to understand that you claim to be  his master, responsible for his conduct?\"    \"No, m'sieur,\" exclaimed the hunter, quickly, fearing he had gone  too far, and shifting his ground. \"The man is a stranger; do with  him as you please; but as for us, since we are here, we will, with  your permission, make the place our headquarters. We could not be in  better hands.\"    \"You wish to wait for another steamer while your passports are  visaed?\"    \"We will proceed in our own boat, which we would put together.\"    \"Ah, you have a little boat?\"    \"A very small boat, m'sieur, with barely room for four men. We  should be honoured to have your opinion on its qualities, and also  upon our stores and their suitability.\"    Venning looked at Mr. Hume with puzzled eyes. He could not  understand his callous abandonment of Muata.    \"But,\" he began, \"we cannot----\"    \"I think it is an excellent place,\" said Compton, quickly; \"and  perhaps these gentlemen would be good enough to assist us with  advice out of their great  experience.\"    \"We should be delighted,\" said Mr. Hume, politely.    The senior officer stroked his huge moustache with an air of renewed  importance.    \"There are two spare rooms in my little house,\" murmured the junior--  \"one for the stores, the other for sleeping quarters.\"    \"It is understood,\" said Mr. Hume, \"that we pay rent, and also that  we pay for the protection you may afford us. I insist on that,  messieurs.\"    The senior nodded a dignified assent, but he was not quite won over,  and retired to his quarters, while his junior inspected the landing  of the goods, including the sections of the boat. In the afternoon,  however, after his nap, the senior succumbed to the influence of a  good cigar, and condescended to sample some of the stores. He was "]]]
