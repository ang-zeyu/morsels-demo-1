Thereupon he was executed, and  we cannot be altogether surprised at it.[1]    Besides these two isolated cases of martyrdom, we do not find any more  recorded until the reign of Abdurrahman II. (May 822-Aug. 852). In the  second year of this king's reign, two Christians, John and Adulphus,  making public profession of their faith, and denouncing Mohammed, were  put to death on Sept 17, 824.[2]        [1] We give the account as Fleury, v. 88 (Bk. 42), gives it,      but with great doubts as to its genuineness, no other writer      that we have seen mentioning it.        [2] Florez, x. 358: Fleury, v. 487. They were buried in St      Cyprian's Church, Cordova. See \"De translatione martyrum      Georgii etc.,\" sec. 7.    This is the first definite indication we have that the toleration shown  by the Moslems was beginning to be abused by their Christian subjects;  and there can be no reasonable doubt that this ill-advised conduct on  the part of the latter was the main cause of the so-called persecution  which followed. But besides this fanaticism on the part of a small  section of the subject Christians, there were other causes at work  calculated to produce friction between the two peoples. During the  century which had elapsed since the conquest, the Christians and  Mohammedans, living side by side under the same government, and one  which, considering the times in which it arose, was remarkable no less  for its equity and moderation than for its external splendour and  magnificence, had gradually been drawn closer together. Intermarriages  had become frequent among them;[1] and these proved the fruitful cause  of religious dissensions. Accordingly we find that the religious  troubles in the reigns of Abdurrahman II. (822-852) and Mohammed I.  (852-886) began with the execution of two children of mixed parents.  Nunilo and Alodia were the children of a Moslem father and a Christian  mother. Their father was a tolerant man, and, apparently, while he  lived, permitted his children to profess the faith of their mother. On  his death, the mother married again, and the new husband, being a  bigoted Mohammedan, and actuated, as we may suppose, by the _odio  vitrici_, immediately set about reclaiming his step-children to the true  faith of Islam, his efforts in this direction leading him to ill-treat,  even to torture,[2] the young confessors. His utmost endeavour to effect  their conversion failing, he delivered them over to the judge on the  charge of apostasy, and the judge to the executioner, by whom they were  beheaded on Oct. 21, 840.[3]        [1] Due in part no doubt to the marriage of captives. See also      below for \"the maiden tribute,\" pp. 96, 97.        [2] So Miss Yonge.        [3] This date is given by Morales, apud Migne, vol. cxv. p.      886, and by Fleury, v. 487, who accuse Eulogius, \"Mem. Sanct.,\"      ii. c. 10, of being in error when he assigns the date 851. The      Pseudo-Luitprand gives 951, vouching for this date as an      eye-witness: \"Me vivente, in castro Wergeti, id est Castellon,      etc.\"    Though there were some cases of martyrdom of this character, where the  sufferers truly earned their title of martyrs,--and we may believe that  all such cases have not been recorded--yet the vast majority of those  which followed in the years 851-860 were of a different type. They were  due to an outbreak of fanatical zeal on the part of a certain section of  the Christians such as to overpower the spirit of toleration, which the  Moslem authorities had so far shown in dealing with their Christian  subjects, and to raise a corresponding tide of bigotry in the less  enlightened, and therefore more intolerant, masses of the Mohammedans.  The sudden mania for martyrdom which manifested itself at this time is  certainly the most remarkable phenomenon of the kind that has been  recorded in the annals of the Christian Church. There had been  occasional instances before of Christians voluntarily offering  themselves to undergo the penalty of the laws for the crime of being  Christians. One such instance in the case of a Phrygian, named Quintus,  had caused grave scandal to the Church of Smyrna; for, having gone  before the proconsul and professed himself ready to die for the faith,  when the reality of the death, which he courted, had been brought home  to him by the sight of the wild beasts ready to rend him, the courage of  the Phrygian had failed, and he had offered incense to the gods. Africa  also had had her self-accused martyrs.    But the Spanish confessors have an interest over and above these, both  by reason of their number and the constancy which they displayed in  their self-imposed task. Not a single instance is recorded, though there  may have been some such, where the would-be martyr from fear or any  other cause forwent his crown. Moreover these martyrdoms, by dividing  the Church on the question of their merit, whether, that is, the  victims were to be ranked as true martyrs or not, and, giving rise to a  written controversy on the subject, has supplied us with ample, if  rather one-sided, materials for estimating the provocation given, and  received, on either side.    As time went on, and the Christians and Moslems mingled more closely  together in political and social life, the Church no doubt suffered some  deterioration. Every interested motive was enlisted in favour of  dropping as far as possible out of sight[1] those distinctive features  of Christianity which might be calculated to give offence to the  Moslems; of conforming to all those Mohammedan customs, which are not in  the Bible expressly forbidden to a Christian;[2] and, generally, of  emphasizing the points on which Christianity agrees with Mohammedanism,  and ignoring those (far more important ones) in which they differ. The  Moslems had no such reason for dissembling their convictions, or  modifying their tenets. Consequently a spiritual paralysis was creeping  upon the Church, which threatened in the course of time, if not checked,  to destroy the very life of Christianity throughout the peninsula. The  case of Africa, from which Islam had extirpated Christianity, showed  that this was no imaginary danger. But Spain had this advantage over  Africa: it contained a free Christian community which had never passed  under the Moslem yoke, where the fire of Christianity, in danger of  being swept away by the devouring flames of Mohammedanism, might be  nursed and cherished, till it could again blaze forth with its former  brilliancy.        [1] See below, p. 72, note 5.        [2] _E.g.,_ circumcision.    Yet in Mohammedan Spain religious fervour was not wholly vanished: it  was still to be found among the clergy, and specially among the dwellers  in convents. Monks and nuns, severed from all worldly influences, in the  silence of their cloisters, would read the lives of the Saints[1] of  old, and meditate upon their glorious deeds, and the miracles which  their faith had wrought. They would brood over such texts as, \"Ye shall  be brought before rulers and kings for My sake;\"[2] and, \"Every one who  shall confess Me before men, him will I also confess before My Father,  which is in Heaven;\"[3] till they brought themselves to believe that it  was their imperative duty to bring themselves before rulers and kings,  and not only to confess Christ, but to revile Mohammed.        [1] See Dozy, ii. 112.        [2] St Mark xiii. 9.        [3] St Matt. x. 32.    However, the reproach of fanatical self-destruction will not apply, as  the apologists of their doings have not failed to point out, to the  first two victims that suffered in this persecution.    Perfectus,[1] a priest of Cordova, who had been brought up in the school  attached to the church of St Acislus, on going out one day to purchase  some necessaries for domestic use, was stopped by some of the Moslems in  the street, and asked to give his opinion of their Prophet. What led  them to make this strange request, we are not told,[2] but stated thus  barely it certainly gives us the impression that it was intended to  bring the priest into trouble. For it was a well-known law in Moslem  countries that if any one cursed a Mohammedan, he was to be scourged,[3]  if he struck him, killed: the latter penalty also awaiting any one who  spoke evil of Mohammed, and extending even to a Mussulman ruler, if he  heard the blasphemy without taking notice of it.[4] Perfectus,  therefore, being aware of this law, gave a cautious[5] answer, declining  to comply with their request until they swore that he should receive no  hurt in consequence of what he might say. On their giving the required  stipulation, he quoted the words, \"For there shall arise false Christs  and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch  that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect,\"[6] and  proceeded to speak of Mohammed in the usual fashion, as a lying impostor  and a dissolute adulterer, concluding with the words, \"Thus hath he, the  encourager of all lewdness, and the wallower in his own filthy lusts,  delivered you all over to the indulgence of an everlasting sensuality.\"  This ill-advised abuse of one, whom the Moslems revere as we revere  Christ, and the ungenerous advantage taken of the oath, which they had  made, naturally incensed his hearers to an almost uncontrollable degree.  They respected their promise, however, and refrained from laying hands  on him at that time, with the intention, says Eulogius, of revenging  themselves on a future occasion.[7]        [1] Eulogius, \"Mem. Sanct.,\" ii., ch. i. secs. 1-4: Alvar,      \"Indic. Lum.,\" sec. 3.        [2] See, however, Appendix A, p. 158.        [3] Alvar, \"Ind.

STILL'S ANSWER.            PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 16th, 1851.        To B. McKIERNON, ESQ.: _Sir_--I have received your letter from      South Florence, Ala., under date of the 6th inst. To say that it      took me by surprise, as well as afforded me pleasure, for which      I feel to be very much indebted to you, is no more than true. In      regard to your informants of myself--Mr. Thornton, of Ala., and      Mr. Samuel Lewis, of Cincinnati--to them both I am a stranger.      However, I am the brother of Peter, referred to, and with the      fact of his having a wife and three children in your service I      am also familiar. This brother, Peter, I have only had the      pleasure of knowing for the brief space of one year and thirteen      days, although he is now past forty and I twenty-nine years of      age. Time will not allow me at present, or I should give you a      detailed account of how Peter became a slave, the forty long      years which intervened between the time he was kidnapped, when a      boy, being only six years of age, and his arrival in this city,      from Alabama, one year and fourteen days ago, when he was      re-united to his mother, five brothers and three sisters.        None but a father's heart can fathom the anguish and sorrows      felt by Peter during the many vicissitudes through which he has      passed. He looked back to his boyhood and saw himself snatched      from the tender embraces of his parents and home to be made a      slave for life.        During all his prime days he was in the faithful and constant      service of those who had no just claim upon him. In the      meanwhile he married a wife, who bore him eleven children, the      greater part of whom were emancipated from the troubles of life      by death, and three only survived. To them and his wife he was      devoted. Indeed I have never seen attachment between parents and      children, or husband and wife, more entire than was manifested      in the case of Peter.        Through these many years of servitude, Peter was sold and      resold, from one State to another, from one owner to another,      till he reached the forty-ninth year of his age, when, in a good      Providence, through the kindness of a friend and the sweat of      his brow, he regained the God-given blessings of liberty. He      eagerly sought his parents and home with all possible speed and      pains, when, to his heart's joy, he found his relatives.        Your present humble correspondent is the youngest of Peter's      brothers, and the first one of the family he saw after arriving      in this part of the country. I think you could not fail to be      interested in hearing how we became known to each other, and the      proof of our being brothers, etc., all of which I should be most      glad to relate, but time will not permit me to do so. The news      of this wonderful occurrence, of Peter finding his kindred, was      published quite extensively, shortly afterwards, in various      newspapers, in this quarter, which may account for the fact of      \"Miller's\" knowledge of the whereabouts of the \"fugitives.\" Let      me say, it is my firm conviction that no one had any hand in      persuading \"Miller\" to go down from Cincinnati, or any other      place, after the family. As glad as I should be, and as much as      I would do for the liberation of Peter's family (now no longer      young), and his three \"likely\" children, in whom he prides      himself--how much, if you are a father, you can imagine; yet I      would not, and could not, think of persuading any friend to      peril his life, as would be the case, in an errand of that kind.        As regards the price fixed upon by you for the family, I must      say I do not think it possible to raise half that amount, though      Peter authorized me to say he would give you twenty-five hundred      for them. Probably he is not as well aware as I am, how      difficult it is to raise so large a sum of money from the      public. The applications for such objects are so frequent among      us in the North, and have always been so liberally met, that it      is no wonder if many get tired of being called upon. To be sure      some of us brothers own some property, but no great amount;      certainly not enough to enable us to bear so great a burden.      Mother owns a small farm in New Jersey, on which she has lived      for nearly forty years, from which she derives her support in      her old age. This small farm contains between forty and fifty      acres, and is the fruit of my father's toil. Two of my brothers      own small places also, but they have young families, and      consequently consume nearly as much as they make, with the      exception of adding some improvements to their places.        For my own part, I am employed as a clerk for a living, but my      salary is quite too limited to enable me to contribute any great      amount towards so large a sum as is demanded. Thus you see how      we are situated financially. We have plenty of friends, but      little money. Now, sir, allow me to make an appeal to your      humanity, although we are aware of your power to hold as      property those poor slaves, mother, daughter and two sons,--that      in no part of the United States could they escape and be secure      from your claim--nevertheless, would your understanding, your      heart, or your conscience reprove you, should you restore to      them, without price, that dear freedom, which is theirs by right      of nature, or would you not feel a satisfaction in so doing      which all the wealth of the world could not equal? At all      events, could you not so reduce the price as to place it in the      power of Peter's relatives and friends to raise the means for      their purchase? At first, I doubt not, but that you will think      my appeal very unreasonable; but, sir, serious reflection will      decide, whether the money demanded by you, after all, will be of      as great a benefit to you, as the satisfaction you would find in      bestowing so great a favor upon those whose entire happiness in      this life depends mainly upon your decision in the matter. If      the entire family cannot be purchased or freed, what can Vina      and her daughter be purchased for? Hoping, sir, to hear from      you, at your earliest convenience, I subscribe myself,        Your obedient servant, WM. STILL.        To B. McKiernon, Esq.      No reply to this letter was ever received from McKiernon. The cause of  his reticence can be as well conjectured by the reader as the writer.    Time will not admit of further details kindred to this narrative. The  life, struggles, and success of Peter and his family were ably brought  before the public in the \"Kidnapped and the Ransomed,\" being the  personal recollections of Peter Still and his wife \"Vina,\" after forty  years of slavery, by Mrs. Kate E.R. Pickard; with an introduction by  Rev. Samuel J. May, and an appendix by William H. Furness, D.D., in  1856. But, of course it was not prudent or safe, in the days of Slavery,  to publish such facts as are now brought to light; all such had to be  kept concealed in the breasts of the fugitives and their friends.    [Illustration: PETER STILL ]      [Illustration: CHARITY STILL ]    The following brief sketch, touching the separation of Peter and his  mother, will fitly illustrate this point, and at the same time explain  certain mysteries which have been hitherto kept hidden--        THE SEPARATION.      With regard to Peter's separation from his mother, when a little boy, in  few words, the facts were these: His parents, Levin and Sidney, were  both slaves on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. \"I will die before I  submit to the yoke,\" was the declaration of his father to his young  master before either was twenty-one years of age. Consequently he was  allowed to buy himself at a very low figure, and he paid the required  sum and obtained his \"free papers\" when quite a young man--the young  wife and mother remaining in slavery under Saunders Griffin, as also her  children, the latter having increased to the number of four, two little  boys and two little girls. But to escape from chains, stripes, and  bondage, she took her four little children and fled to a place near  Greenwich, New Jersey. Not a great while, however, did she remain there  in a state of freedom before the slave-hunters pursued her, and one  night they pounced upon the whole family, and, without judge or jury,  hurried them all back to slavery. Whether this was kidnapping or not is  for the reader to decide for himself.    Safe back in the hands of her owner, to prevent her from escaping a  second time,"]]]
