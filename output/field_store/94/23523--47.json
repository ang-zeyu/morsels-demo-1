Tom knew not what to do for a weapon; his whip would be but little good  against a monstrous beast twelve foot in length and six foot about the  waist. But whilst the giant went for his club, bethinking him of a very  good weapon, he made no more ado, but took his cart, turned it upside  down, and took axle-tree and wheel for shield and buckler. And very good  weapons they were found!    Out came the giant and began to stare at Tom. \"You are like to do great  service with those weapons,\" roared he. \"I have here a twig that will  beat you and your wheel to the ground.\" Now this twig was as thick as  some mileposts are, but Tom was not daunted for all that, though the  giant made at him with such force that the wheel cracked again. But Tom  gave as good as he got, taking the giant such a weighty blow on the side  of the head that he reeled again. \"What,\" said Tom, \"are you drunk with  my strong beer already?\"    So at it they went, Tom laying such huge blows at the giant, down whose  face sweat and blood ran together, so that, being fat and foggy and  tired with the long fighting, he asked Tom would he let him drink a  little? \"Nay, nay,\" said Tom, \"my mother did not teach me such wit;  who'd be a fool then?\" And seeing the giant beginning to weary and fail  in his blows, Tom thought best to make hay whilst the sun shone, and,  laying on as fast as though he had been mad, he brought the giant to the  ground. In vain were the giant's roars and prayers and promises to yield  himself and be Tom's servant. Tom laid at him till he was dead, and  then, cutting off his head, he went into the cave, and found a great  store of silver and gold, which made his heart to leap. So he loaded his  cart, and after delivering his beer at Wisbeach, he came home and told  his master what had befallen him. And on the morrow he and his master  and more of the towns-folk of Lynn set out for the giant's cave. Tom  showed them the head, and what silver and gold there was in the cave,  and not a man but leapt for joy, for the giant was a great enemy to all  the country.    The news was spread all up and down the country-side how Tom Hickathrift  had killed the giant. And well was he that could run to see the cave;  all the folk made bonfires for joy, and if Tom was respected before, he  was much more so now. With common consent he took possession of the cave  and every one said, had it been twice as much, he would have deserved  it. So Tom pulled down the cave, and built himself a brave house. The  ground that the giant kept by force for himself, Tom gave part to the  poor for their common land, and part he turned into good wheat-land to  keep himself and his old mother, Jane Hickathrift. And now he was become  the chiefest man in the country-side; 't was no longer plain Tom, but  Mr. Hickathrift, and he was held in due respect I promise you. He kept  men and maids and lived most bravely; made him a park to keep deer, and  time passed with him happily in his great house till the end of his  days.          The Hedley Kow      There was once an old woman, who earned a poor living by going errands  and such like, for the farmers' wives round about the village where she  lived. It wasn't much she earned by it; but with a plate of meat at one  house, and a cup of tea at another, she made shift to get on somehow,  and always looked as cheerful as if she hadn't a want in the world.    Well, one summer evening as she was trotting away homewards, she came  upon a big black pot lying at the side of the road.    \"Now _that_,\" said she, stopping to look at it, \"would be just the very  thing for me if I had anything to put into it! But who can have left it  here?\" and she looked round about, as if the person it belonged to must  be not far off. But she could see no one.    \"Maybe it'll have a hole in it,\" she said thoughtfully:--    \"Ay, that'll be how they've left it lying, hinny. But then it 'd do fine  to put a flower in for the window; I'm thinking I'll just take it home,  anyways.\" And she bent her stiff old back, and lifted the lid to look  inside.    \"Mercy me!\" she cried, and jumped back to the other side of the road;  \"_if it is fit brim full o' gold_ PIECES!!\"    For a while she could do nothing but walk round and round her treasure,  admiring the yellow gold and wondering at her good luck, and saying to  herself about every two minutes, \"Well, I _do_ be feeling rich and  grand!\" But presently she began to think how she could best take it home  with her; and she couldn't see any other way than by fastening one end  of her shawl to it, and so dragging it after her along the road.    \"It'll certainly be soon dark,\" she said to herself, \"and folk'll not  see what I'm bringing home with me, and so I'll have all the night to  myself to think what I'll do with it. I could buy a grand house and all,  and live like the Queen herself, and not do a stroke of work all day,  but just sit by the fire with a cup of tea; or maybe I'll give it to the  priest to keep for me, and get a piece as I'm wanting; or maybe I'll  just bury it in a hole at the garden-foot, and put a bit on the chimney,  between the chiney teapot and the spoons--for ornament like. Ah! I feel  so grand, I don't know myself rightly!\"    And by this time, being already rather tired with dragging such a heavy  weight after her, she stopped to rest for a minute, turning to make sure  that her treasure was safe.    But when she looked at it, it wasn't a pot of gold at all, but a great  lump of shining silver!    She stared at it, and rubbed her eyes and stared at it again; but she  couldn't make it look like anything but a great lump of silver. \"I'd  have sworn it was a pot of gold,\" she said at last, \"but I reckon I must  have been dreaming. Ay, now, that's a change for the better; it'll be  far less trouble to look after, and none so easy stolen; yon gold pieces  would have been a sight of bother to keep 'em safe. Ay, I'm well quit of  them; and with my bonny lump I'm as rich as rich--!\"    And she set off homewards again, cheerfully planning all the grand  things she was going to do with her money. It wasn't very long, however,  before she got tired again and stopped once more to rest for a minute or  two.    Again she turned to look at her treasure, and as soon as she set eyes on  it she cried out in astonishment. \"Oh, my!\" said she; \"now it's a lump  o' iron! Well, that beats all; and it's just real convenient! I can sell  it as _easy_ as _easy_, and get a lot o' penny pieces for it. Ay, hinny,  an' it's much handier than a lot o' yer gold and silver as 'd have kept  me from sleeping o' nights thinking the neighbours were robbing me--an'  it's a real good thing to have by you in a house, ye niver can tell what  ye mightn't use it for, an' it'll sell--ay, for a real lot. Rich? I'll  be just _rolling!_\"    And on she trotted again chuckling to herself on her good luck, till  presently she glanced over her shoulder, \"just to make sure it was there  still,\" as she said to herself.    \"Eh, my!\" she cried as soon as she saw it; \"if it hasn't gone and turned  itself into a great stone this time! Now, how could it have known that I  was just _terrible_ wanting something to hold my door open with? Ay, if  that isn't a good change! Hinny, it's a fine thing to have such good  luck.\"    And, all in a hurry to see how the stone would look in its corner by her  door, she trotted off down the hill, and stopped at the foot, beside her  own little gate.    When she had unlatched it, she turned to unfasten her shawl from the  stone, which this time seemed to lie unchanged and peaceably on the path  beside her, There was still plenty of light, and she could see the stone  quite plainly as she bent her stiff back over it, to untie the shawl  end; when, all of a sudden, it seemed to give a jump and a squeal, and  grew in a moment as big as a great horse; then it threw down four lanky  legs, and shook out two long ears, flourished a tail, and went off  kicking its feet into the and laughing like a naughty mocking boy.    The old woman stared after it, till it was fairly out of sight.    \"WELL!\" she said at last, \"I _do_ be the luckiest body hereabouts! Fancy  me seeing the Hedley Kow all to myself, and making so free with it too!  I can tell you, I _do_ feel that GRAND--\"    And she went into her cottage, and sat down by the fire to think over  her good luck.          Gobborn Seer      Once there was a man Gobborn Seer, and he had a son called Jack.    One day he sent him out to sell a sheep skin, and Gobborn said, \"You  must bring me back the skin and the value of it as well.\"    So Jack started, but he could not find any who would leave him the skin  and give him its price too. So he came home discouraged.    But Gobborn Seer said, \"Never mind, you must take another turn at it  to-morrow.\"    So he tried again, and nobody wished to buy the skin on those terms.    When he came home his father said, \"You must go and try your luck  to-morrow,\" and the third day it seemed as if it would be the same thing  over again. And he had half a mind not to go back at all, his father  would be so vexed. As he came to a bridge, like the Creek Road one  yonder, he leaned on the parapet thinking of his trouble, and that  perhaps it would be foolish to run away from home, but he could not tell  which to do; when he saw a girl washing her clothes on the bank below.  She looked up and said:    \"If it may be no offence asking, what is it you feel so badly about?\"    \"My father has given me this skin, and I am to fetch it back and the  price of it beside.\"    \"Is that all? Give it here, and it's easy done.\"    So the girl washed the skin in the stream, took the wool from it, and  paid him the value of it, and gave him the skin to carry back.    His father was well pleased, and said to Jack, \"T"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14264"],[0,"The Practice and Science of Drawing (#8)"],[1,"far as things had gone in the direction of the  representation of form, until well on in the Italian Renaissance.  Botticelli used nothing else than an outline lightly shaded to indicate  form. Light and shade were not seriously perceived until Leonardo da  Vinci. And a wonderful discovery it was thought to be, and was, indeed,  although it seems difficult to understand where men's eyes had been for  so long with the phenomena of light and shade before them all the time.  But this is only another proof of what cannot be too often insisted on,  namely that the eye only sees what it is on the look-out for, and it may  even be there are things just as wonderful yet to be discovered in  vision.    But it was still the touch association of an object that was the  dominant one; it was within the outline demanded by this sense that the  light and shade were to be introduced as something as it were put on the  object. It was the \"solids in space\" idea that art was still appealing  to.    \"The first object of a painter is to make a simple flat surface appear  like a relievo, and some of its parts detached from the ground; he who  excels all others in that part of the art deserves the greatest  praise,\"[1] wrote Leonardo da Vinci, and the insistence on this  \"standing out\" quality, with its appeal to the touch sense as something  great in art, sounds very strange in these days. But it must be  remembered that the means of creating this illusion were new to all and  greatly wondered at.    [Footnote 1: Leonardo da Vinci, _Treatise on Painting_, paragraph 178.]    And again, in paragraph 176 of his treatise, Leonardo writes: \"The  knowledge of the outline is of most consequence, and yet may be acquired  to great certainty by dint of study; as the outlines of the human  figure, particularly those which do not bend, are invariably the same.  But the knowledge of the situation, quality and quantity of shadows,  being infinite, requires the most extensive study.\"    The outlines of the human figure are \"invariably the same\"? What does  this mean? From the visual point of view we know that the space occupied  by figures in the field of our vision is by no means \"invariably the  same,\" but of great variety. So it cannot be the visual appearance he is  speaking about. It can only refer to the mental idea of the shape of  the members of the human figure. The remark \"particularly those that do  not bend\" shows this also, for when the body is bent up even the mental  idea of its form must be altered. There is no hint yet of vision being  exploited for itself, but only in so far as it yielded material to  stimulate this mental idea of the exterior world.    [Illustration: Plate IX.    STUDY BY WATTEAU    From an original drawing in the collection of Charles Ricketts and  Charles Shannon.]    All through the work of the men who used this light and shade (or  chiaroscuro, as it was called) the outline basis remained. Leonardo,  Raphael, Michael Angelo, Titian, and the Venetians were all faithful to  it as the means of holding their pictures together; although the  Venetians, by fusing the edges of their outline masses, got very near  the visual method to be introduced later by Velazquez.    In this way, little by little, starting from a basis of simple outline  forms, art grew up, each new detail of visual appearance discovered  adding, as it were, another instrument to the orchestra at the disposal  of the artist, enabling him to add to the somewhat crude directness and  simplicity of the early work the graces and refinements of the more  complex work, making the problem of composition more difficult but  increasing the range of its expression.    But these additions to the visual formula used by artists was not all  gain; the simplicity of the means at the disposal of a Botticelli gives  an innocence and imaginative appeal to his work that it is difficult to  think of preserving with the more complete visual realisation of later  schools. When the realisation of actual appearance is most complete, the  mind is liable to be led away by side issues connected with the things  represented, instead of seeing the emotional intentions of the artist  expressed through them. The mind is apt to leave the picture and  looking, as it were, not at it but through it, to pursue a train of  thought associated with the objects represented as real objects, but  alien to the artistic intention of the picture. There is nothing in  these early formulae to disturb the contemplation of the emotional  appeal of pure form and colour. To those who approach a picture with the  idea that the representation of nature, the \"making it look like the  real thing,\" is the sole object of painting, how strange must be the  appearance of such pictures as Botticelli's.    The accumulation of the details of visual observation in art is liable  eventually to obscure the main idea and disturb the large sense of  design on which so much of the imaginative appeal of a work of art  depends. The large amount of new visual knowledge that the naturalistic  movements of the nineteenth century brought to light is particularly  liable at this time to obscure the simpler and more primitive qualities  on which all good art is built. At the height of that movement line  drawing went out of fashion, and charcoal, and an awful thing called a  stump, took the place of the point in the schools. Charcoal is a  beautiful medium in a dexterous hand, but is more adaptable to mass than  to line drawing. The less said about the stump the better, although I  believe it still lingers on in some schools.    Line drawing is happily reviving, and nothing is so calculated to put  new life and strength into the vagaries of naturalistic painting and get  back into art a fine sense of design.    This obscuring of the direct appeal of art by the accumulation of too  much naturalistic detail, and the loss of power it entails, is the cause  of artists having occasionally gone back to a more primitive  convention. There was the Archaistic movement in Greece, and men like  Rossetti and Burne-Jones found a better means of expressing the things  that moved them in the technique of the fourteenth century. And it was  no doubt a feeling of the weakening influence on art, as an expressive  force, of the elaborate realisations of the modern school, that prompted  Puvis de Chavannes to invent for himself his large primitive manner. It  will be noticed that in these instances it is chiefly the insistence  upon outline that distinguishes these artists from their contemporaries.    Art, like life, is apt to languish if it gets too far away from  primitive conditions. But, like life also, it is a poor thing and a very  uncouth affair if it has nothing but primitive conditions to recommend  it. Because there is a decadent art about, one need not make a hero of  the pavement artist. But without going to the extreme of flouting the  centuries of culture that art inherits, as it is now fashionable in many  places to do, students will do well to study at first the early rather  than the late work of the different schools, so as to get in touch with  the simple conditions of design on which good work is built. It is  easier to study these essential qualities when they are not overlaid by  so much knowledge of visual realisation. The skeleton of the picture is  more apparent in the earlier than the later work of any school.    The finest example of the union of the primitive with the most refined  and cultured art the world has ever seen is probably the Parthenon at  Athens, a building that has been the wonder of the artistic world for  over two thousand years. Not only are the fragments of its sculptures  in the British Museum amazing, but the beauty and proportions of its  architecture are of a refinement that is, I think, never even attempted  in these days. What architect now thinks of correcting the poorness of  hard, straight lines by very slightly curving them? Or of slightly  sloping inwards the columns of his facade to add to the strength of its  appearance? The amount of these variations is of the very slightest and  bears witness to the pitch of refinement attempted. And yet, with it  all, how simple! There is something of the primitive strength of  Stonehenge in that solemn row of columns rising firmly from the steps  #without any base#. With all its magnificence, it still retains the  simplicity of the hut from which it was evolved.    Something of the same combination of primitive grandeur and strength  with exquisite refinement of visualisation is seen in the art of Michael  Angelo. His followers adopted the big, muscular type of their master,  but lost the primitive strength he expressed; and when this primitive  force was lost sight of, what a decadence set in!    This is the point at which art reaches its highest mark: when to the  primitive strength and simplicity of early art are added the infinite  refinements and graces of culture without destroying or weakening the  sublimity of the expression.    In painting, the refinement and graces of culture take the form of an  increasing truth to natural appearances, added bit by bit to the  primitive baldness of early work; until the point is reached, as it was  in the nineteenth century, when apparently the whole facts of visual  nature are incorporated. From this wealth of visual material, to which  must be added the knowledge we now have of the arts of the East, of  China, Japan, and India, the modern artist has to select those things  that appeal to him; has to select those elements that answer to his  inmost need of expressing himself as an artist. No wonder a period of  artistic dyspepsia is upon us, no wonder our exhibitions, particularly  those on the Continent, are full of strange, weird things. The problem  before the artist was never so complex, but also never so interesting.  New forms, new combinations, new simplifications are to be found. But  "]]]
