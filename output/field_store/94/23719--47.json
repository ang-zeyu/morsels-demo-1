[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17910"],[0,"The Mafulu: Mountain People of British New Guinea (#8)"],[1," cloth are made and worn by men and women. They are  only put on after recovery from an illness by which the wearer has  been laid up, including childbirth. The cape is simply a plain long  narrow piece of undyed bark cloth. The corners of one end are fastened  together, and the whole of that end is bunched up into a sort of hood,  which is placed over the head, whilst the rest of the cloth hangs  down as a narrow strip behind. The cape in no way covers or conceals  any part of the body when viewed from the front or side. It is only  worn for a few days; but whilst wearing it the wearer discards all,  or nearly all, his or her ornaments. I could learn no reason for the  custom. Plates 18 and 19 show these capes, and the way in which they  are worn.    Mourning strings (Plate 30, Fig. 1) are made and worn by both men and  women. These are plain undecorated necklaces varying much in size and  appearance; sometimes they are made of undyed twisted bark cloth, and  vary in thickness from one-sixteenth of an inch to an inch; sometimes  they are only made of string, and are quite thin. There is always  an end or tassel to the necklace, made out of the extremities of the  neck part, and hanging in front over the chest; and, if the necklace  is of string, and not of bark cloth, some bark cloth is twisted round  this tassel. This sign of grief is after a death worn by the widow or  widower or other nearest relative (male or female) of the deceased;  and at times two people of equal degree of relationship will both wear  it. It is worn until the formal ending of the mourning. The woman to  the extreme right in Plate 26 is wearing one of these.    Widows' vests. These are mourning garments, only worn by the widows of  chiefs. The garment, which is made by women, is a vest made of string  network (like a string bag), the mesh of which is the special Mafulu  mesh, which will be described hereafter, and it is not coloured. It  is plainly and simply made, with openings at the top for the neck,  and at the sides for the arms (no sleeves), and coming down to  about the waist, without any other opening either in front or at the  back. This garment is also worn until the formal end of the period  of mourning. [39] I was unable to secure a picture of one of these.    There is no special dress for chiefs to distinguish them from other  people.    European calico clothing has not been adopted by these people, even  in the district where they are in touch with the missionaries. Indeed  I may say that the people, happily for their own health, show no  inclination to wear more clothing; and no doubt as a result of their  conservatism in this respect they escape many a fatal cold and attack  of pneumonia, and the spread of infectious skin diseases is somewhat  reduced. I may also add that the Bishop and Fathers of the Mission  do not attempt, or seem to desire, to urge the people who come under  their influence to endanger their health and their lives for the sake  of conforming to views as to clothing which have played such havoc  with tropical natives in many parts of the globe. [40]      Physical Body Decoration, &c.    Tattooing and body-scarring are not practised by either men or women  among the Mafulu.    Depilation. When a young man's beard begins to grow, the hairs  of the beard and moustache and eye-brows are extracted. No other  depilation is practised by men, and none whatever by women; and none  of them shave any part of the body. The depilation is effected with  two fibre threads twisted round each other, the hair to be extracted  being inserted between the threads. Anyone can do this, and there is  no ceremony connected with it.    Nose-piercing. The septa of the noses of both men and women are  pierced at or after the age of 15 or 18, and either before or after  marriage. This is done for men by men, and for women by women. There  is no special person whose duty it is to do it, but he or she must  be one who knows the incantations which are required. There is no  restriction as to diet or otherwise placed upon the operator prior  to the operation, but there is a day's food restriction imposed upon  the person whose nose is to be pierced.    Two instruments are used for the operation, one being a piercing  instrument made of pig bone and sharpened, and the other being a small  wooden plug, also sharpened. The operator first visibly, but silently,  engages in two incantations, during the former of which he holds up  the thumb and first finger of his right hand, and during the latter  of which he holds up the two instruments. He then with the thumb  and first finger of his right hand holds the septum of the nose of  the person to be operated upon, whom I will call the \"patient,\" and  with the left hand pierces the septum with the bone instrument. He  next inserts the wooden plug into the hole, so as to make it larger,  and leaves the plug there. Then he takes a blade of grass, which he  also inserts through the hole, by the side of the plug, and, holding  the grass by the two ends, he makes it rotate round and round the  plug. This is a painful process, which frequently causes tears and  cries from the patient. He then probably goes through the same process  with various other patients, as it is the custom to operate on several  persons at the same time.    The patients are then all lodged in houses built for the purpose, one  house being for men and one for women. These are not houses which are  kept permanently standing, but are specially built on each occasion  on which the nose-boring operation is going to be performed. A great  swelling of the patients' noses develops, and this spreads more or  less over their faces. The patients are confined in the special houses  until the holes in their noses are large enough and the wounds are  healed. During this confinement each patient has himself to do what  is requisite to further enlarge the hole by the insertion into it from  time to time of pieces of wood and by putting in rolled up leaves and  pushing pieces of wood inside these leaves. During all this period he  is not allowed to come out of the house, at all events not so as to be  seen, and his diet is confined to sweet potato, cooked in a certain  way. The cooking for all the patients, men and women, is done by the  woman nose-piercing operator, assisted by other women. The potatoes  are wrapped up in leaves (usually banana), each potato being generally  wrapped up separately in one or more leaves; and, when so wrapped up,  they are cooked in red-hot ashes, and then taken to the houses where  the patients are.    When the hole in any patient's nose has reached the requisite size,  and the wound is healed, he inserts a large croton leaf [41] into  the hole; he may then come out and return to his own house, retaining  the croton leaf in his nose. He must next occupy himself in searching  for a black non-poisonous snake about 12 or 18 inches long, which is  commonly found in the grass. I cannot say what snake this is, but  I am advised that it is probably _Tropidonotus mairii_. Its native  name is _fal' ul' obe_, which means \"germ of the ground.\" Until he  finds this snake he must keep the croton leaf in his nose, and is  still under the same restriction as to food, which is cooked in the  same way and by the same persons as before. On finding the snake,  he secures it alive, removes the croton leaf from the hole in his  nose, and inserts into it the tail end of the living snake; then,  holding the head of the snake in one of his hands, and the tail in  the other, he draws the snake slowly through the hole, until its head  is close to the hole. He then lets the head drop from his hand, and  with a quick movement of the other hand draws it through the nose,  and throws the snake, still living, away. [42] This completes the  nose-piercing; but there still rests upon the patient the duty of  going to the river, and there catching an eel, which he gives to the  people who have been feeding him during his illness.    The nose-piercing is generally done at one of the big feasts; and,  as these are rare in any one village, you usually find in the villages  many fully-grown people whose noses have not been pierced; though as  to this I may say that nose-piercing is more generally indulged in by  chiefs and important people and their families than by the village rank  and file. It commonly happens, however, that a good many people have  to be done when the occasion arises. Each person to be operated upon  has to provide a domestic pig for the big feast. I have been unable  to discover the origin and meaning of the nose-piercing ceremony. [43]    Ear-piercing is done to both men and women, generally when quite young,  say at seven or twelve years of age. Both the lower and the upper lobes  are pierced, sometimes only one or the other, and sometimes both;  but the lower lobe is the one more commonly pierced. They can do it  themselves, or can get someone else to do it. There is no ceremony. The  piercing is done with the thorn of a tree, and the hole is afterwards  gradually widened by the insertion of small pieces of wood. They never  make large holes, or enlarge them greatly afterwards, as the holes are  only used for the hanging of pendants, and not for the insertion of  discs. After the piercing the patient must, until the wound is healed,  abstain from all food except sweet potato; but there is no restriction  as to the way in which this food is to be cooked, or the person who  is to cook it. There is as regards ear-piercing no difference between  the case of chiefs' children and those of other people.    Body-staining is usual with both men and women, who do it for  themselves, or get others to help them. There is no ceremony  in connection with it. The colours generally adopted are red,  greyish-yellow and black. The red stain is procured from an earth,  which is obtained from the low countries; but they themselves also"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17928"],[0,"The Influence of India and Persia on the Poetry of Germany (#8)"],[1,"first _Ghaselen_:        Der Orient sei neu bewegt,      Soll nicht nach dir die Welt vernuechtern,      Du selbst, du hast's in uns erregt:      So nimm hier, was ein Juengling schuechtern      In eines Greisen Haende legt.[115]    The poetic spirit of the Orient had been brought into German literature;  it was reserved for Rueckert and Platen to complete the work by bringing  over also the poetic forms.

SCHILLER.          Schiller's Interest in Sakuntala--Turandot.      While the Orient, as we have seen, cast its spell over Germany's  greatest poet and inspired the lyric genius of his later years for one  of its most remarkable efforts, it remained practically without any  influence on his illustrious friend and brother-poet Schiller. If  Schiller had lived longer, it is not impossible that he too might have  contributed to the West-Eastern literature. As it is, however, he died  before the Oriental movement in Germany had really begun. At no time did  he feel any particular interest in the East. Once, indeed, he mentions  _Sakuntala_. Goethe had drawn his attention to a German version of the  _Gitagovinda_ and this reminded Schiller of the famous Hindu drama which  he read with the idea of possibly utilizing it for the theatre.[116]  This idea he abandons owing to the delicacy of the piece and its lack of  movement.    An attempt has been made to prove that to Kalidasa's drama Schiller was  indebted for the motive of his \"Alpenjaeger,\" but it cannot be said to  have been successful.[117]           *       *       *       *       *    Though there was no direct Oriental influence on Schiller's poetry,  there is one dramatic poem of his which indirectly goes back to a  Persian source. It is _Turandot_. The direct source for this composition  was Gozzi's play of the same name in the translation of August Clemens  Werthes, which Schiller, however, used with such freedom that his own  play may be regarded as an original production rather than a version.  The Italian poet based his _fiaba_ on the story of Prince Kalaf in the  Persian tales of Petis de La Croix.[118] Now, as has been pointed out  by scholars,[119] the name of the heroine, who gives the name to the  play, is genuinely Persian, _Turan-ducht_, \"the daughter of Turan,\"[120]  and although the scene is laid in China, most of the proper names, both  in Gozzi and Schiller, are not at all Chinese, but Persian or Arabic.  The oldest known model for the story is the fourth romance of Nidami's  _Haft Paikar_, the story of Bahramgur and the Russian princess, written  1197.[121] Whether Schiller was aware of the ultimate origin of the  legend or not, he certainly made no attempt to give Persian local color  to his piece, but on the contrary he studiously tried to impart to it a  Chinese atmosphere.[122] It is interesting nevertheless to notice that  when _Turandot_ was given at Hamburg (July 9 to Sept. 9, 1802) its real  provenence was recognized, and, accordingly Turandot was no longer the  princess of China, but that of Shiraz, her father being transformed into  the Shah of Persia and the doctors of the _divan_ into Oriental  Magi.[123] At Dresden the same thing happened, and here even Tartaglia  and Brigella, who had been allowed to retain their Italian names in  Hamburg, were made to assume the Oriental names of Babouk and Osmin. The  specifically Chinese riddles disappeared, and instead of Tien and Fohi,  Hormuz was now invoked.[124]      FOOTNOTES:    [116] A Letter dated from Weimar, Feb. 20, 1802.

Friedrich Schlegel's Weisheit der Indier--Foundation of        Sanskrit Study in Germany.      We have now come to the period of the foundation of Sanskrit philology  in Germany. English statesmanship had completed the material conquest of  India; German scholarship now began to join in the spiritual conquest of  that country. With this undertaking the names of Friedrich and August  Wilhelm Schlegel are prominently identified. The chief work of these  brothers lies in the field of philosophy, translation and criticism, and  is therefore beyond the scope of this investigation. Suffice it to say  that Friedrich's famous little book _Die Weisheit der Indier_, published  in 1808, besides marking the beginning of Sanskrit studies and  comparative grammar in Germany,[125] is also of interest to us because  here for the first time a German version of selections from the  _Mahabharata_, _Ramayana_ and the _Code of Manu_, as well as a  description of some of the most common Sanskrit metres is  presented,[126] and an attempt is even made to reproduce these metres in  the translation. The work of August Wilhelm Schlegel as critic,  translator and editor of important works from Sanskrit literature is too  familiar to need more than mention.[127] It is well known that to his  lectures Heine owed his fondness for the lotus-flowers and gazelles on  the banks of the Ganges.    On the poetry of the Schlegels their Oriental studies exercised very  little influence. Friedrich translated some maxims from the _Hitopadesa_  and from Bhartrhari;[128] August likewise translated from the same  works, as well as from the Epics and Puranas.[129] There are only two  original poems of his that have anything to do with India, and both of  these were written before he had begun the study of Sanskrit. The first  is \"Die Bestattung des Braminen,\"[130] a somewhat morbid description of  the burning of a corpse. It was addressed to his brother Karl August,  who had joined a Hanoverian regiment in the service of the East India  Company. The second of these poems is \"Neoptolemus an Diokles\" (ii. 13),  written in 1800, and dedicated to the memory of this same brother who  had died at Madras in 1789.[131] As a matter of fact, there is really  nothing Oriental in the spirit of the poem.    Aside from translations, the only poems that are connected with  Schlegel's Sanskrit studies, are the epigrams against his illustrious  contemporaries, Bopp and Rueckert. Those against the former (ii. 234) are  of no special interest here. With those against Rueckert, however, the  case is different. It is worth while noting that towards the  distinguished scholar-poet Schlegel assumed a patronizing attitude. To"]]]
