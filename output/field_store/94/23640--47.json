How sweet and  pleasant is it to see zealous and godly brethren temperate and of  good discipline; and how sad is it and grievous to see them  walking disorderly, not practising the duties to which they are  called. How hurtful a thing it is to neglect the purpose of their  calling, and turn their inclinations to things which are none of  their business.    6. Be mindful of the duties which thou hast undertaken, and set  always before thee the remembrance of the Crucified.  Truly  oughtest thou to be ashamed as thou lookest upon the life of  Jesus Christ, because thou hast not yet endeavoured to conform  thyself more unto Him, though thou hast been a long time in the  way of God.  A religious man who exercises himself seriously and  devoutly in the most holy life and passion of our Lord shall find  there abundantly all things that are profitable and necessary for  him, neither is there need that he shall seek anything better  beyond Jesus.  Oh! if Jesus crucified would come into our hearts,  how quickly, and completely should we have learned all that we  need to know!    7. He who is earnest receiveth and beareth well all things that  are laid upon him.  He who is careless and lukewarm hath trouble  upon trouble, and suffereth anguish upon every side, because he  is without inward consolation, and is forbidden to seek that  which is outward.  He who is living without discipline is exposed  to grievous ruin.  He who seeketh easier and lighter discipline  shall always be in distress, because one thing or another will  give him displeasure.    8. O! if no other duty lay upon us but to praise the Lord our God  with our whole heart and voice!  Oh! if thou never hadst need to  eat or drink, or sleep, but wert always able to praise God, and  to give thyself to spiritual exercises alone; then shouldst thou  be far happier than now, when for so many necessities thou must  serve the flesh.  O! that these necessities were not, but only  the spiritual refreshments of the soul, which alas we taste too  seldom.    9. When a man hath come to this, that he seeketh comfort from no  created thing, then doth he perfectly begin to enjoy God, then  also will he be well contented with whatsoever shall happen unto  him.  Then will he neither rejoice for much nor be sorrowful for  little, but he committeth himself altogether and with full trust  unto God, who is all in all to him, to whom nothing perisheth nor  dieth, but all things live to Him and obey His every word  without delay.    10. Remember always thine end, and how the time which is lost  returneth not.  Without care and diligence thou shalt never get  virtue.  If thou beginnest to grow cold, it shall begin to go ill  with thee, but if thou givest thyself unto zeal thou shalt find  much peace, and shalt find thy labour the lighter because of the  grace of God and the love of virtue.  A zealous and diligent  man is ready for all things.  It is greater labour to resist sins  and passions than to toil in bodily labours.  He who shunneth not  small faults falleth little by little into greater.  At eventide  thou shalt always be glad if thou spend the day profitably.  Watch over thyself, stir thyself up, admonish thyself, and  howsoever it be with others, neglect not thyself. The more  violence thou dost unto thyself, the more thou shall profit.  Amen.    (1) Psalm xxxvii. 3.          THE SECOND BOOK        ADMONITIONS CONCERNING THE INNER LIFE    CHAPTER I    Of the inward life    The kingdom of God is within you,(1) saith the Lord.  Turn thee  with all thine heart to the Lord and forsake this miserable  world, and thou shalt find rest unto thy soul.  Learn to despise  outward things and to give thyself to things inward, and thou  shalt see the kingdom of God come within thee.  For the kingdom  of God is peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, and it is not given to  the wicked.  Christ will come to thee, and show thee His  consolation, if thou prepare a worthy mansion for Him within  thee.  All His glory and beauty is from within, and there it  pleaseth Him to dwell.  He often visiteth the inward man and  holdeth with him sweet discourse, giving him soothing  consolation, much peace, friendship exceeding wonderful.    2. Go to, faithful soul, prepare thy heart for this bridegroom  that he may vouchsafe to come to thee and dwell within thee, for  so He saith, if any man loveth me he will keep my words: and my  Father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our  abode with him.(2)  Give, therefore, place to Christ and refuse  entrance to all others.  When thou hast Christ, thou art rich,  and hast sufficient.  He shall be thy provider and faithful  watchman in all things, so that thou hast no need to trust in  men, for men soon change and swiftly pass away, but Christ  remaineth for ever and standeth by us firmly even to the end.    3. There is no great trust to be placed in a frail and mortal  man, even though he be useful and dear to us, neither should  much sorrow arise within us if sometimes he oppose and contradict  us.  They who are on thy side to-day, may to-morrow be against  thee, and often are they turned round like the wind. Put thy  whole trust in God and let Him be thy fear and thy love, He will  answer for thee Himself, and will do for thee what is best.  Here  hast thou no continuing city,(3)  and wheresoever thou art, thou  art a stranger and a pilgrim, and thou shalt never have rest  unless thou art closely united to Christ within thee.    4. Why dost thou cast thine eyes hither and thither, since this  is not the place of thy rest?  In heaven ought thy habitation to  be, and all earthly things should be looked upon as it were in  the passing by.  All things pass away and thou equally with them.  Look that thou cleave not to them lest thou be taken with them  and perish.  Let thy contemplation be on the Most High, and let  thy supplication be directed unto Christ without ceasing.  If  thou canst not behold high and heavenly things, rest thou in the  passion of Christ and dwell willingly in His sacred wounds.  For  if thou devoutly fly to the wounds of Jesus, and the precious  marks of the nails and the spear, thou shalt find great comfort  in tribulation, nor will the slights of men trouble thee much,  and thou wilt easily bear their unkind words.    5. Christ also, when He was in the world, was despised and  rejected of men, and in His greatest necessity was left by His  acquaintance and friends to bear these reproaches.  Christ was  willing to suffer and be despised, and darest thou complain of  any?  Christ had adversaries and gainsayers, and dost thou wish  to have all men thy friends and benefactors?  Whence shall thy  patience attain her crown if no adversity befall thee?  If thou  art unwilling to suffer any adversity, how shalt thou be the  friend of Christ?  Sustain thyself with Christ and for Christ if  thou wilt reign with Christ.    6. If thou hadst once entered into the mind of Jesus, and hadst  tasted yea even a little of his tender love, then wouldst thou  care nought for thine own convenience or inconvenience, but  wouldst rather rejoice at trouble brought upon thee, because the  love of Jesus maketh a man to despise himself.  He who loveth  Jesus, and is inwardly true and free from inordinate affections,  is able to turn himself readily unto God, and to rise above  himself in spirit, and to enjoy fruitful peace.    7. He who knoweth things as they are and not as they are said or  seem to be, he truly is wise, and is taught of God more than of  men. He who knoweth how to walk from within, and to set little  value upon outward things, requireth not places nor waiteth for  seasons, for holding his intercourse with God.  The inward man  quickly recollecteth himself, because he is never entirely given  up to outward things.  No outward labour and no necessary  occupations stand in his way, but as events fall out, so doth he  fit himself to them.  He who is rightly disposed and ordered  within careth not for the strange and perverse conduct of men.  A  man is hindered and distracted in so far as he is moved by  outward things.    8. If it were well with thee, and thou wert purified from evil,  all things would work together for thy good and profiting.  For  this cause do many things displease thee and often trouble thee,  that thou art not yet perfectly dead to thyself nor separated  from all earthly things.  Nothing so defileth and entangleth the  heart of man as impure love towards created things.  If thou  rejectest outward comfort thou wilt be able to contemplate  heavenly things and frequently to be joyful inwardly.    (1) Luke xvii. 21.   (2) John xiv. 23.   (3) Hebrews xiii. 14.      CHAPTER II    Of lowly submission    Make no great account who is for thee or against thee, but mind  only the present duty and take care that God be with thee in  whatsoever thou doest.  Have a good conscience and God will defend  thee, for he whom God will help no man's perverseness shall be  able to hurt.  If thou knowest how to hold thy peace and to  suffer, without doubt thou shalt see the help of the Lord.  He  knoweth the time and the way to deliver thee, therefore must thou  resign thyself to Him.  To God it belongeth to help and to  deliver from all confusion.  Oftentimes it is very profitable for  keeping us in greater humility, that others know and rebuke our  faults.    2. When a man humbleth himself for his defects, he then easily  pacifieth others and quickly satisfieth those that are angered  against him.  God protecteth and delivereth the humble man, He  loveth and comforteth the humble man, to the humble man He  inclineth Himself, on the humble He bestoweth great grace, and  when he is cast down He raiseth him to glory: to the humble He  revealeth His secrets, and sweetly draweth and inviteth him to  Himself.  The humble man having received"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16531"],[0,"Old St. Paul's Cathedral (#8)"],[1," have any  report in St. Paul's. His text was Rev. iv. 6, and he interpreted \"the  living creatures\" as the bishops who surrounded his legatine throne,  whose eyes were to be everywhere and on all sides. The chroniclers  tell how a terrific storm burst over the cathedral at this moment, to  the terror of the whole congregation, including the Legate, and lasted  for fifteen days. It did much harm to the building. The bishop, Roger  Niger, exerted himself strenuously in repairing this. Edmund Rich, the  Archbishop of Canterbury, indignantly protested against the intrusion  of foreign authority, and was joined by Walter de Cantelupe, the  saintly Bishop of Worcester, but for a long time they were powerless.  Besides direct taxation, wealth raised from the appropriation of  rich canonries was drained away from church and state into the Papal  treasury. The Legate remained for four years in power. The Archbishop,  in despair, retired abroad, and died as a simple monk at Pontigny. The  Bishop of London, Roger Niger, was so called from his dark complexion,  and people whimsically noted his being confronted with the Cardinal  Otto Albus. Bishop Roger, before his episcopate, was Archdeacon of  Rochester, a very wise and energetic administrator. He was now on the  side of Rich, bent on defending his clergy from being over-ridden by  the foreigners. He exerted himself as bishop not only to repair the  mischief done by the storm, but to enlarge and beautify the still  unfinished structure. Fourteen years later King Henry was offering  devotion at the shrine of Rich, for he had been canonised, and that  on the strength of his having resisted the King's criminal folly in  betraying the rights of his people; for by this time the nation was  aroused. The Londoners rose and burned the houses of the foreigners.  Bishop Roger, though he, of course, declared against the scenes of  violence, let it be seen that he was determined, by constitutional  methods, to defend his clergy from being plundered. On his death,  in 1241, there was a long vacancy, the King wanting one man and  the canons determined on another, and they carried their man, Fulk  Bassett, though he was not consecrated for three years. Pope Innocent  IV., in 1246, sent a demand of one-third of their income from the  resident clergy, and half from non-resident. Bishop Fulk indignantly  called a council at St. Paul's, which declared a refusal, and even the  King supported him. The remonstrance ended significantly with a call  for a General Council. But he was presently engaged in a more serious  quarrel. The King forced the monks of Canterbury, on the death of  Edmund Rich, to elect the queen's uncle, Boniface of Savoy, to the  primacy. He came and at once began to enrich himself, went \"on  visitation\" through the country demanding money. The Dean of St.  Paul's, Henry of Cornhill, shut the door in his face, Bishop Fulk  approving. The old Prior of the Monastery of St. Bartholomew,  Smithfield, protested, and the Archbishop, who travelled with a  cuirass under his pontifical robe, knocked him down with his fist.[2]  Two canons, whom he forced into St. Paul's chapter, were killed by the  indignant populace. The same year (1259) brave Bishop Fulk died of the  plague. For years the unholy exactions went on, and again and again  one has records of meetings in St. Paul's to resist them.    When Simon de Montfort rose up against the evil rule of Henry III. the  Londoners met in folkmote, summoned by the great bell of St. Paul's,  and declared themselves on the side of the great patriot. They are  said to have tried to sink the queen's barge when she was escaping  from London to join the King at Windsor.    King Edward I. demanded a moiety of the clerical incomes for his war  with Scotland. The Dean of St. Paul's (Montfort) rose to protest  against the exaction, and fell dead as he was speaking. Two years  later, the King more imperiously demanded it, and Archbishop  Winchelsey wrote to the Bishop of London (Gravesend) commanding him to  summon the whole of the London clergy to St. Paul's to protest, and to  publish the famous Bull, \"clericis laicos,\" of Pope Boniface VIII.,  which forbade any emperor, king, or prince to tax the clergy without  express leave of the Pope. Any layman who exacted, or any cleric who  paid, was at once excommunicate. Boniface, who had been pope two  years, put forward far more arrogant pretensions than Gregory or  Innocent had done, but times were changed. The Kings of England and  France were at once in opposition. The latter (Philip IV.) was more  cautious than his English neighbour, and in the uncompromising  struggle between king and pope, the latter died of grief at defeat,  and his successor was compelled, besides making other concessions, to  remove the papal residence from Rome to Avignon, where it continued  for seventy years, the popes being French nominees. King Edward, with  some trouble, got his money, but promised to repay it when the war was  over, and the clergy succeeded in wresting some additional privileges  from him, which they afterwards used to advantage.    We pass over the unhappy reign of Edward II., only noting that the  Bishop of Exeter, Stapylton, who was ruling for him in London, was  dragged out of St. Paul's, where he had taken sanctuary, and beheaded  in Cheapside. He was the founder of Exeter College, Oxford.    The exile of the popes to Avignon, so far from diminishing their  rapacity, increased it, if possible, and Green shows that the immense  outlay on their grand palace there caused the passing of the Statute  of Provisors in 1350, for the purpose of stopping the incessant  draining away of English wealth to the papacy. During that  \"seventy years' captivity,\" as it was called, Italy and Rome were  revolutionised, and when at length the popes returned to their ancient  city (1376) the great \"papal schism\" began, which did so much to bring  on the Reformation. It arose out of the Roman people's determination  to have an Italian pope, and the struggle of the French cardinals to  keep the dignity for Frenchmen. The momentous results of that fierce  conflict only concern us here indirectly. We simply note now that the  year following the return to Rome saw John Wyclif brought to account  at St. Paul's.    But before following that history, it will not be out of place to  take another survey of our cathedral during these years, apart  from fightings and controversies. St. Paul's had been most closely  connected with the continually growing prosperity of the city.  The Lord Mayor was constantly worshipping there in state with his  officers. On the 29th of October each year (the morrow of SS. Simon  and Jude) he took his oath of office at the Court of Exchequer, dined  in public, and, with the aldermen, proceeded from the church of St.  Thomas Acons (where the Mercers' Chapel now is) to the cathedral.  There a requiem was said for Bishop William, as already described,[3]  then they went on to the tomb of Thomas Becket's parents, and the  requiem was again said. This done they returned by Cheapside to the  Church of St. Thomas Acons, where each man offered a penny. On All  Saints' Day (three days later) they went to St. Paul's again for  Vespers, and again at Christmas, on the Epiphany, and on Candlemas Day  (Purification). On Whitsun Monday they met at St. Peter's, Cornhill,  and on this occasion the City clergy all joined the procession, and  again they assembled in the cathedral nave, while the _Veni Creator  Spiritus_ was sung antiphonally, and a chorister, robed as an angel,  waved incense from the rood screen above.[4] Next day the same  ceremony was repeated, but this time it was \"the common folk\" who  joined in the procession, which returned by Newgate, and finished  at the Church of St. Michael le Querne.[5] And once more they went  through the ceremony, the \"common folk of Essex\" this time assisting.  There could not be fuller proof of the sense of religious duty in  civil and commercial life. The history of the City Guilds is full of  the same interweaving of the life of the people with the duties of  religion. There is an amusing incident recorded of one of these  Pentecostal functions. On Whitsun Monday, 1382, John Sely, Alderman of  Walbrook, wore a cloak without a lining. It ought to have been lined  with green taffeta. There was a meeting of the Council about this, and  they gave sentence that the mayor and aldermen should dine with the  offender at his cost on the following Thursday, and that he should  line his cloak. \"And so it was done.\"    At one of these Whitsun festivals (it was in 1327) another procession  was held, no doubt to the delight of many spectators. A roguish baker  had a hole made in his table with a door to it, which could be opened  and shut at pleasure. When his customers brought dough to be baked he  had a confederate under the table who craftily withdrew great pieces.  He and some other roguish bakers were tried at the Guildhall, and  ordered to be set in the pillory, in Cheapside, with lumps of dough  round their necks, and there to remain till vespers at St. Paul's were  ended.

The Norman despotism of the Crown was crumbling away, so  was the Latin despotism of the Church. On both sides there was evident  change at hand, and Wiclif gave form to the new movement. He was born  about 1324, educated at Oxford,"]]]
