The superficial self-righteous critic may  find it an agreeable pursuit to search out their blemishes; but these  men cannot be airily dismissed in that manner. They towered above  their fellows, the supreme product of the spirit of their day in  adventure and daring; they fulfilled their great destiny, and left  their indelible mark upon the life of their nation and of the world.  Their great emancipating heroism and reckless self-abnegation more  than counterbalanced the faults with which the modern mind, judging  their day by ours, is too prone to credit them, and whatever their  deeds of perfidy may have been, they were imbued more with the idea of  patriotism than with that of avarice. They were remarkable men, nor  did they come into the life of the nation by chance, but for a  purpose, and their memories are enshrined in human history.    Drake sailed for home as soon as he had embarked what was left of  Raleigh's colonists at Roanoke River, Virginia, and after a protracted  and monotonous passage, arrived at Plymouth on the 28th July, 1586.  The population received the news with acclamation. Drake wrote to Lord  Burleigh, bemoaning his fate in having missed the gold fleet by a few  hours, and again placing his services at the disposal of his Queen and  country.    The most momentous of all his commissions, especially to his own  country, was in 1587, when he destroyed a hundred ships in Cadiz  Harbour. It was a fine piece of work, this \"singeing of the King of  Spain's beard\" as he called it, and by far excelled anything he had  previously done. He captured the _San Philip_, the King of Spain's  ship, which was the largest afloat. Her cargo was valued at over one  million sterling, in addition to which papers were found on board  revealing the wealth of the East India trade. The knowledge of this  soon found a company of capitalists, who formed the East India  Company, out of which our great Indian Empire was established. When  the _San Philip_ was towed into Dartmouth Harbour, and when it became  known generally, the whole country was ablaze with excitement, and  people travelled from far and near to see the leviathan.    Drake bore himself on this occasion with that sober modesty that  characterized him always under any circumstances. His reputation stood  higher now than ever, and it was no detriment to him that Philip  should shudder, and when he became virtuously agitated speak of him as  \"that fearful man Drake.\" Everywhere he was a formidable reality,  strong, forbidding and terrible; his penetrating spirit saw through  the plans of the enemies of his country and his vigorous  counter-measures were invariably successful. The exalted part he took  in the defeat of the Armada has been briefly referred to in another  part of this book. He was then at the height of his imposing  magnificence and fame, but owing to the caprice of his royal mistress,  who had an insatiable habit of venting her Tudor temper  indiscriminately, he fell under her displeasure, and for a time was in  disgrace; but she soon discovered that his services, whatever his lack  of success on apparently rash enterprises may have been, were  indispensable at so critical a moment. He was recalled, and soon after  sent on his melancholy last voyage. He had worn himself out in the  service of his country. Born at Tavistock in 1539, his eager spirit  passed into the shadows off Puerto Bello on the 28th January, 1596,  and, as previously stated, he was buried three miles out at sea, and  two of his prizes were sunk and laid beside him.    The following beautiful lines of Sir Henry Newbolt not only describe  his patriotic and heroic end, but breathe the very spirit of the man  who was one of the most striking figures of the Elizabethan age:--    DRAKE'S DRUM.    _3rd Verse_:        Drake, he's in his hammock till the great Armadas come,      (Capten, art tha sleepin' there below?)      Slung atween the round shot, listenin' for the drum,      An' dreamin' arl the time o' Plymouth Hoe.      Call him on the deep sea, call him up the Sound,      Call him when ye sail to meet the foe;      Where the old trade's plyin', and the old flag flyin',      They shall find him ware an' wakin',      As they found him long ago!            NELSON AND HIS CIRCLE      I    The tradition created by Drake and Hawkins was carried on by Nelson  and Collingwood in a different age and under different conditions, and  the same heroic spirit animated them all. Nelson must certainly have  been familiar with the enthralling tales of these men and of their  gallant colleagues, but without all the essential qualities born in  him he could not have been the victor of Trafalgar. Men have to do  something distinctive, that sets the human brain on fire, before they  are really recognized as being great; then all others are put in the  shade, no matter how necessary their great gifts may be to fill up the  gaps in the man of initiative and of action. Drake could not have done  what he did had he not had the aid of Frobisher, and Jervis would not  have become Earl St. Vincent had he not been supported by Nelson at  the battle of that name; and we should never have seen the imposing  monument erected in Trafalgar Square had Nelson been without his  Collingwood. Victorious and valiant performances do not come by  chance, and so it comes to pass in the natural course of human law  that if our Jervises, Nelsons, and Collingwoods, who are the  prototypes of our present-day heroes, had not lived, we should not  have had our Fishers, Jellicoes, and Beattys.    Nelson was always an attractive personality and by no means the type  of man to allow himself to be forgotten. He believed he was a  personage with a mission on earth, and never an opportunity was given  him that did not confirm this belief in himself.    Horatio Nelson was the son of the Rev. Edmund Nelson, and was born at  Burnham Thorpe on the 29th September, 1758. His mother died in 1767,  and left eight children. Her brother, Captain Maurice Suckling, was  appointed to the _Raisonable_ three years after her death, and agreed,  at the request of Horatio himself and the instigation of his father,  after some doubtful comments as to the boy's physical suitableness for  the rough life of a sailor, to take him; so on the 1st January, 1771,  he became a midshipman on the _Raisonable._ On the 22nd May he either  shipped of his own accord or was put as cabin-boy on a merchant vessel  which went to the West Indies, and ended his career in the merchant  service at the end of an eventful voyage. In July 1772 he became  midshipman on board the _Triumph_. This was the real starting-point of  his naval career and of the development of those great gifts that made  him the renowned Admiral of the world. Twenty-two years after joining  his uncle's ship he was made captain of the _Agamemnon_. At the siege  of Calvi in 1794 he was wounded in the right eye and lost the sight  of it. Three years afterwards he lost his right arm while commanding  an attack on Santa Cruz, and although he had put so many sensational  events into his life up to that time, it was not until the battle of  St. Vincent that he began to attract attention. He had been promoted  Rear-Admiral before the news of the battle was known, and when the  news reached England the public enthusiasm was irrepressible. Jervis  was made an Earl, with L3,000 a year pension, and the King requested  that he should take his title from the name of the battle. Nelson  refused a baronetcy, and was made, at his own request, a Knight of the  Bath, receiving the thanks of the City of London and a sword. All  those who were in prominent positions or came to the front in this  conflict received something. It was not by a freak of chance that the  authorities began to see in Nelson the elements of an extraordinary  man. Nor was it mere chance that they so far neglected him that he was  obliged to force himself upon the Admiralty in order to get them to  employ him. The nation was in need of a great spirit, and Providence  had been preparing one for many years before the ruling authorities  discovered that Nelson was their man of the future.    For several months he was tearing about the seas in search of the  French fleet. He popped into Naples on the 17th June, 1798, ostensibly  to know if anything had been heard of it, and no doubt he took the  opportunity of having a word with Sir William and Lady Hamilton, who  were to come so romantically into his life. He found the French fleet  at anchor in Aboukir Bay and sailed upon it with such amazing audacity  that the heart was knocked out of them at the very outset. Neither the  French Admiral nor anybody else would have expected the British fleet  to run their ships between them and the shore at the risk of  grounding. The _Culloden_ _did_ ground. The French had 11 out of 13  ships put out of action, but the British fleet suffered severely also,  and the loss of men was serious.[1] Out of a total of 7,401 men, 218  were killed and 678 wounded. Nelson himself was badly wounded on the  forehead, and as the skin fell down on his good eye and the blood  streamed into it, he was both dazed and blinded. He shouted to Captain  Berry as he was staggering to a fall, \"I am killed; remember me to my  wife.\" But there was a lot more work for him to do before the fatal  day. He was carried below, believing the injury would prove fatal, in  spite of the assurances to the contrary of the surgeon who was in  attendance.    Although Nelson's courage can never be doubted, there is something  very curious in his constant, eccentric foreboding of death and the  way in which he scattered his messages about to one and another. This  habit increased amazingly after his conflict with the French at the  Nile. He seems to have had intermittent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15319"],[0,"The Government Class Book (#8)"],[1,"_capital_, applied to a city, now generally indicates the seat of  government.    Sec.3. When the two houses have assembled in their respective chambers,  some person designated for that purpose administers to the members of  each house the oath of office, in which they solemnly swear (or affirm,)  that they will support the constitution of the United States, and the  constitution of the state, and faithfully discharge the duties of their  office.    Sec.4. Each house then proceeds to _organize_ for business, by appointing  proper officers, and determining the right of members to seats in the  house. In organizing a legislative body, the first thing done is the  election of a presiding officer, or chairman, who is usually called  _speaker_. The lieutenant-governor, in states in which there is one,  presides in the senate, and is called _president of the senate_. In the  absence of the presiding officer, a temporary speaker or president is  chosen, who is called speaker or president _pro tempore_, commonly  abbreviated, _pro tem._, which is a Latin phrase, meaning _for the  time_.    Sec.5. The duty of the person presiding is to keep order, and to see that  the business of the house is conducted according to certain established  rules. When a vote is to be taken, he puts the question, which is done  by requesting all who are in favor of a proposed measure, to say _aye_,  and those opposed to say _no_. And, when a vote has been taken, he  declares the question to be carried or lost. This part of a speaker's  business is similar to that of the chairman of an ordinary public  meeting.    Sec.6. The other officers chosen by each house are, a _clerk_ to keep a  record or journal of its proceedings; to take charge of papers, and to  read such as are to be read to the house; and to do such other things as  may be required of him; a _sergeant-at-arms_, to arrest members and  other persons guilty of disorderly conduct, to compel the attendance of  absent members, and to do other business of a like nature: also one or  more _door-keepers_. The officers mentioned in this section are not  chosen from the members of the house.    Sec.7. The constitution does not prescribe to either house the order of  business, or the particular manner in which it shall be done; but  authorizes each house to determine for itself the rules of its  proceedings. But there are sundry things which it expressly enjoins. It  determines what portion of the members shall constitute a quorum to do  business. _Quorum_ is the Latin of the English words, _of whom_, and has  strangely come to signify the _number_ or _portion_ of any body of men  who have power to act for the whole. Thus with reference to a  legislative body consisting of a certain number of members, instead of  saying, A majority _quorum_ shall have power to act; or, A majority _of  whom_ shall have power to act, our constitutions generally say, A  majority shall constitute a quorum to do business. In some states, more  than a bare majority is required for a quorum.    Sec.8. Constitutions generally require also that the proceedings of  legislative bodies shall be open to public inspection. The doors may be  closed against spectators only when the public good shall require  secrecy. And that the people may be fully informed of what is done, each  house is required to keep and publish a journal of its proceedings.    Sec.9. Provision is also made, either by the constitution or by laws  against injury or interruption to the business of the legislature.  Members may not, by any prosecution at law, except for crimes and  misdemeanors, be hindered during their attendance at the sessions of the  legislature, nor in going to or returning from the same. Each house may  compel the attendance of absent members. It may for good cause expel a  member, and punish, not only its members and officers, but other  persons, for disorderly conduct, or for obstructing its proceedings.          Chapter XI.    Manner of Enacting Laws.        Sec.1. When the two houses are duly organized and ready for business, the  governor sends to both houses a written communication called _message_,  in which, as the constitution requires, he gives to the legislature  information of the condition of the affairs of the state, and recommends  such measures as he judges necessary and expedient. The message is read  to each house by its clerk.    Sec.2. But the measures to which the governor calls the attention of the  legislature, are but a small portion of those which are considered and  acted upon. Many are introduced by individual members. Others are  brought into notice by the petitions of the people in different parts of  the state. _Petition_ generally signifies a request or prayer. As here  used, it means a written request to the legislature for some  favor--generally for a law granting some benefit or relief to the  petitioners. Petitions are sent to members, usually to those who  represent the counties or districts in which the petitioners live, and  are by these members presented to the house.    Sec.3. Now it is evident, that a proper consideration of the numerous  subjects pressed upon the attention of the legislature--some of them of  very great importance--must require much labor. If the necessary  investigation of so many subjects should occupy the time of the whole  house, there would not be time enough to act upon one-half of them.  Therefore, in order to dispatch business, the labor of the house must be  divided, that the investigation of all the different subjects may be  going on at the same time.    Sec.4. Hence arises the practice which prevails in all legislative bodies,  of the appointment of committees. As soon as may be, after a house is  organized, committees are appointed on all subjects usually acted on in  the legislature. A legislative committee is generally composed of three,  five, or seven members, who examine the subjects referred to them, and  report the result of their examination to the house. Committees are  appointed by the presiding officer of each house. Occasionally, though  very rarely, they are elected by the house itself.    Sec.5. Some or all of the following committees are appointed in every  legislature: a committee on finance, or the funds, income, and other  money matters of the state, sometimes called the committee of ways and  means; a committee on agriculture; a committee on manufactures;  committees on the incorporation of cities and villages; on banks and  insurance companies; on railroads; on canals; on education; on  elections; on public printing, besides many others. So numerous are  these subjects, that in constituting the committees, every member may be  put on some committee.    Sec.6. All matters relating to these subjects of a general nature, which  arise during the session, are referred to their appropriate committees.  Thus, a question or proposition relating to banks, is referred to the  committee on banks; matters relating to rail-roads, are referred to the  committee on rail-roads; those relating to schools, are referred to the  committee on education, &c. As these committees continue during the  session, they are called _standing_ committees. When a question arises  having no relation to any subject on which there is a standing  committee, it is usually referred to a _special_ or _select_ committee  appointed to consider this particular matter.    Sec.7. Committees meet in private rooms, during hours when the house is not  in session; and any person wishing to be heard in favor of or against a  proposed measure, may appear before the committee having it in charge.  Having duly considered the subject, the committee reports to the house  the information it has obtained, with the opinion whether the measure  ought or ought not to become a law. Measures reported against by  committees, seldom receive any further notice from the house.    Sec.8. From what has been said, the utility of committees is readily seen.  Although no proposed measure can become a law unless acted on and  approved by the two houses, its necessity may be inquired into, and the  information necessary to enable the house to act understandingly upon  the question, may be obtained, as well by a few members as by the whole  house. By the daily examination of so many subjects in committee, a  large amount of business is soon prepared for the house to act upon, and  much of its time is saved.    Sec.9. If a committee reports favorably upon a subject, it usually brings  in a bill with its report. A _bill_ is the form or draft of a law. Not  all bills, however, are reported by committees. Any member of the house  desiring the passage of a law, may give notice that he will, on some  future day, ask leave of the house to introduce a bill for that purpose;  and if, at the time specified, the house shall grant leave, he may  introduce the bill. But at least one day's previous notice must be given  of his intention to ask leave, before it can be granted.    Sec.10. The different steps in the progress of a bill, or the different  forms of action through which it has to pass, are numerous. A minute  description of them in a work designed chiefly for youth, will scarcely  be expected. A thorough knowledge of the proceedings of legislative  assemblies, can be practically beneficial, in after life, to but few of  those who shall study this elementary treatise. Those who shall  hereafter have occasion for this knowledge, will find works adapted to a  more mature age, in which the subject is fully treated.    Sec.11. A bill, before it is passed, must be read three times; but it may  not be read twice on any one day without unanimous consent, that is, the  consent of the whole house; or, as is believed to be the rule in some  bodies, the consent of three-fourths, or two-thirds of the house. In  some legislatures, the rule allows the first and second readings to be  on the same day. A bill is not to be amended"]]]
