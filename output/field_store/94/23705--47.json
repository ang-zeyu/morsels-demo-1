She had been there half-a-year, asleep,  hibernating, and in that state, without any other protection than the  summer-house roof and walls, had survived the frosts of winter.    The wasp did not move further.    The spider appeared to be taking things in, measuring her chances,  weighing the risk against her famished hunger--possibly her late  husband had been her last meal, months ago--marking the vital spot upon  her prey, aiming for the shot, which must be true, for one does not  miss in attacking a wasp--and live.  Only, she would not have risked it  at all, perhaps, if the wasp had seemed alive, or more alive, at any  rate.    Then came the shot--one cannot in justice call it a spring; it was too  instant to be termed that.  The spider simply was upon the wasp without  seeming to go there; but the wasp was not there, or, rather, her vital  spot wasn't.  She had kicked herself round on her side, like a  cart-wheel, lying flat, with her feet, and the spider's jaws struck  only hard cuirass.  Before the spider, leaping back, wolf-like, could  lunge in her lightning second stroke, the wasp was on her feet, a live  thing, after all.    The warmth had been already soaking the message of spring into her  cold-drugged brain, and now this sudden attack had finished what the  warmth had begun.  She was awake, on her feet, a live and dangerous  proposition; groggy, it is true; dazed, half-working, so to speak; but  a force to be reckoned with--after half-a-year.  And one saw, too, at a  glance that she was different from ordinary wasps--would make two, in  fact, of any ordinary wasp; and her great jaws looked as if they could  eat one and comfortably deal with more; whilst her dagger-sting, now  unsheathed and ready--probably for the first time--could deliver a  wound twice as deep and deadly as the ordinary wasp.  She was, in  short, a queen-wasp; a queen of the future, if Fate willed; a queen as  yet without a kingdom, a sovereign uncrowned, but of regal proportions  and queenly aspect, for all that; for in the insect world royalties are  fashioned upon a super-standard that marks them off from the common  herd.    The spider hesitated.  She knew the danger of the stripes of  yellow--the yellow flag, so to speak.  The fear of it is upon every  insect that lives.  At the same time, the queen was undoubtedly yet  numb.    Antagonists decide in the insect world like a flash of light, and quick  as thought they act.  The spider attacked now so quickly that she  seemed to have vanished, and she met--jaws.  Back she shot, circled,  shot in again, and she met--sting!    It was never clear whether that sting went home.  The spider did.  She  fell--fell plump to the floor, only not breaking what spiders have in  place of a neck because of the fact that, being a spider, she never  moved anywhere, not even upon a spring, without anchoring a line of web  down first.  Therefore, an inch from the ground, she fetched up with a  jerk upon the line that she had anchored up on the joist, spun round,  let herself drop the rest of the way, and ran into the crack between  the boards of the floor.  Goodness knows if she lived.    The wasp, with that extremely droll, lugubrious look on her long,  mask-like face which makes the faces of insects so funny and uncanny,  like pantomime masks, sat down as if nothing had happened, apparently  to scheme out the best way to possess herself of a kingdom and become a  queen in fact as well as in name.  Really, she was cleaning  herself--combing her antennae with her forelegs, provided with bristle  hairs for the purpose, scraping and polishing her wings, as if they did  not already shine like mother-o'-pearl, and washing her quaint face.    She was still rather groggy from the effects of her long sleep and the  cold endured--it is a wonder how she had stood the latter at all--and  when, with a subdued inward sort of hum, she finally launched herself  in flight, she nearly fell to the ground before righting herself and  flying in a zigzag heavily across the lawn.    A cock-chaffinch up in the limes saw her, and condescending at last to  break his song, described a flashing streak of wine-red breast and  white wing-bars in the sun.  He appeared to recognize her sinister  yellow shield in time, however, and returned to his perch with a  flourish, leaving the wasp to go on and begin dancing up the wall of  the house till she came to the open window.  Here she vanished within.    The sunlight sat on the floor of the room inside, and the baby sat in  the sunlight; and the wasp, apparently still half-awake, went, or,  rather, nearly tumbled, and sat beside the baby.    They made an odd picture there--the golden sun, the sunny,  golden-headed baby, and that silent, yellow she-devil, crawling,  crawling, crawling, with her narrow wings gleaming like gems.    Then the child put out her chubby hand to seize that bright-yellow  object--how was she to know that it was the yellow signal of danger in  the insect world that she saw?  And, of course, being a baby, she was  going to stuff it into her mouth.  But Fate had use for that  wasp--perhaps for that baby.  Wherefore there was a little scream, a  pair of woman's arms swept down and whisked that baby into the air, and  a high-heeled shoe whisked the astonished wasp into a corner.  Here she  swore savagely, vibrating her head with tremendous speed in the  process, rose heavily and menacingly, made to fly out, hit the upper  window, which was shut, and which she could not see, but felt, and fell  to the floor again, where she apparently had brain-fever, buzzing round  and round on her back like a top the while.    And then, rising suddenly, the queen flew away, hitting nothing in the  process, but getting through the lower and open part of the window.  She seemed anxious to make sure of not getting into the house again.  She flew right away, rising high to top the garden hedge, and dropping  low on the far side, to buzz and poke about in and out, up along the  hedge-bank that bordered the hayfield.    She flew as one looking for something, and every insect in her way took  jolly good care--in the shape of scintillating streaks and dashes--to  get out of it.  The mere sight of that yellow-banded cuirass shining in  the sun was apparently quite enough for them--most of them, anyway.  As  a matter of fact, she was looking for a site for a city.  She had  ambition, and would found her a city, a city of her very own, with  generous streets at right angles, on the American plan; and she would  be queen of it.  It was a big idea, and we should have said an  impossible one, seeing that at that moment she was the city and its  population and its queen all rolled into one, so to speak.  Queen-wasps, however, also on the American plan, ruled the word  \"impossible\" out of their dictionary long ago.  They \"attempt the end,  and never stand to doubt.\"    The queen came to rest on a bare patch of ground an front of a hole,  and a black and hairy spider, with two hindlegs missing on the offside,  spun round in the entrance of that hole to face her.  He had not been  noticeable until he moved.    She left him in a hurry, and thereafter resumed her endless searching  along the hedge-bank.  A dozen times she vanished into a hole, and,  after a minute or so, came out again with the air of one dissatisfied.  Half-a-dozen times she came out tail first, buzzing warnings and very  angry, at the invitation of a bumble-bee queen, a big, hook-jawed,  carnivorous beetle in shining mail, and so forth, but she never lost  her head.    Finally, she came to a mole-hole that suited her.  The other burrows  had all turned out to be field-mouse holes, leading ultimately into a  main tunnel that ran the whole length of the hedge apparently, and was  a public way for all the little whiskered ones.  But this tunnel, bored  by the miner mole, ran nowhither, having caved in not far from the  entrance, and was very sound of construction, with a nice dry slope.  She selected a wide spot where the tunnel branched, each branch forming  a _cul-de-sac_.  Here she slew swiftly several suspicious-looking  little tawny beetles and one field-cricket, who put up a rare good  fight for it, found loafing about the place.    It pleased the queen that here, in this spot, she would found her a  city.  But first she must, as it were, take the latitude and the  longitude of this her stronghold to be.  She must know where her city  was, must make absolutely dead sure, certain, of finding it again when  she went out.  Otherwise, if she lost it--well, there would be an end  to it before it had begun, so to speak.  For this purpose, therefore,  she rose slowly, humming to herself some royal incantation--rose, upon  a gradually widening corkscrew spiral, into the air.    She was, in point of fact, surveying the district round her capital to  be, marking each point--bush, stone, grass-tuft, tree-trunk,  flower-cluster, clod, branch, anything and everything, great and  small--and jotting down in indelible memory fluid, upon whatever she  kept for a brain, just precisely the position of every landmark.  And  as she rose her circles ever widened, so that at last her big compound  eyes took in quite a big stretch of sunlit picture, to be photographed  upon her memory, and there remain forevermore.    It took her some time, for it was some job; but once done, it was done  for good.    Next, alighting with great hustle--now that the work was once  begun--the queen ran into her tunnel, and made sure that nobody had  \"jumped her claim\" in the interval.  She found an ant, red and  ravenous, taking too professional an interest in the place, and she  abolished that ant with one nip; though, as you may be sure, the tiny  insect fought like a bulldog.    Then she executed a shallow excavation upon the site of the future city  itself, carrying"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17571"],[0,"Piano Tuning: A Simple and Accurate Method for Amateurs (#8)"],[1,"nds, lay a nicely fitting piece  of wood, well coated with glue, on each side and wrap with binding  wire. If it is broken off up so close to the hammer as not to permit  this, drill a hole through the hammer head in line with the center of  the shank, with a small-sized screwdriver such as watchmakers use, and  run the wire through this and around the shank, drawing it firm; glue  as before; when dry it will be as strong as ever. When the shank is  broken off close to the butt, the same treatment will sometimes  answer, but the strain here is so much greater that it is sometimes  necessary to put in a new shank. In fact, it is always better to do  so.    2. _Flanges, damper heads_, and all small wooden parts are liable to  break or come unglued. The watchmaker's screwdriver, the binding wire  and the glue must always be at hand for these emergencies. These  breaks are generally in places where wrapping is not permissible, and  you are compelled to drill. Keep the screwdriver well sharpened and  the drilling is easy.    3. _Ivories_.--When unglued, scrape the old glue off, apply glue to  both surfaces and clamp with an ivory clamp or rubber band until the  glue is firm. Apply the same treatment to ebony sharps.    4. _Leads_ in the keys and the dampers of the square piano get loose  and rattle. Hammer them just enough to tighten; too much might split  the key.    5. _Friction_.--Where different materials, such as wood and felt,  would rub together they are covered with black lead to lubricate them.  The point of the jack where it comes in contact with the butt, the toe  of the jack which strikes the regulating button, and the long wooden  capstan which takes the place of the extension and works directly on  the under side of the wippen, which is covered with felt, are  black-leaded. When a key squeaks and goes down reluctantly, the  trouble can usually be traced to these places; especially to the  wooden capstan, the black lead having worn away. Use powdered black  lead on these parts.    There are many things in this kind of work that require only the  exercise of \"common sense.\" These we have omitted to mention, treating  only of those things the student does not know intuitively.      QUESTIONS ON LESSON VI.        1. When a key snaps or clicks at the instant it is let up, give      two or more conditions that might cause it.        2. When a key simply rattles, what parts of the action would you      examine for the trouble?        3. When a key is struck and there is no response, what may be the      cause?        4. Give two causes for defective damping in a square piano.        5. Give cause of and remedy for a squeaking key.          LESSON VII.    ~THE STUDY AND PRACTICE OF PIANO TUNING.~      Before commencing the systematic study of piano tuning, we want to  impress the student with a few important facts that underlie the great  principles of scale building and general details of the art.    If you have followed the suggestions, and thoroughly mastered the work  up to this point you should now have some idea of the natural and  artificial phenomena of musical tones; you should have a clear  knowledge at least of the fundamental principles of harmony and the  technical terms by which we designate intervals and their relation to  each other; a knowledge of the general and specific construction of  the different types of pianos and their actions, and the methods  employed to put them in perfect working condition mechanically. This  admitted, we are ready to consider the art of tuning--one, the  appreciation of which is in direct proportion to the understanding of  it. Let us now view this art for a moment in its past, present and  future phases.    You may be a little surprised at what we are about to tell you, but it  is a fact, gleaned from long experience in traveling and observation,  that many, verily, the majority of pretending tuners have not so much  practical knowledge of a piano as you should now have. We have no  doubt that you, if you have a musical ear, could, without further  instruction, improve an instrument that was extremely out of tune. You  could detect and improve a tone which you should find extremely sharp  or flat; you could detect and improve a unison that might be badly  out, and you might produce an entire scale in which none of the chords  would be unbearably rasping. But this is not enough. You should aspire  to perfection, and not stop short of it.    It may seem to us who are musicians with thorough knowledge of the  simpler laws of music, that a scale of eight tones is a simple affair;  simply a natural consequence; the inevitable arrangement; but a  historical investigation will prove our mistake. We will not go into  the complexities of musical history; suffice it to say that the wisest  philosophers who lived prior to the fourteenth century had no idea of  a scale like that we have at the present day.    In piano tuning, as in other arts, many theories and conjectures have  been advanced regarding the end to be sought and the means by which to  gain it. There must be a plan--a system by which to work. The question  is: What plan will insure the most perfect results with the least  amount of labor? In Piano Tuning, this plan is called the Temperament.    Webster defines the word thus: \"A system of compromises in the tuning  of pianofortes, organs,\" etc. Later on we will discuss fully what  these compromises are, and why they exist; for it is in them that the  tuner demonstrates his greatest skill, and to them that the piano owes  its surpassing excellence as a musical instrument, and, consequently,  its immense popularity. For the present, the term \"temperament\" may be  considered as meaning the plan or pattern from which the tuner works.    No subject of so great importance in the whole realm of musical  science has been so strangely neglected as the method of setting a  temperament. Even musicians of high learning, in other respects, give  little attention to scale building, and hence they differ widely on  this topic. There can be but one \"best way\" of doing a thing, and that  best way should be known and followed by the profession; but, strange  to say, there are a half dozen systems of setting the temperament in  vogue at the present time. The author has, in his library, a book on  \"Temperament\" which, if followed, would result in the production of a  scale in which every chord would be unbalanced, harsh and unbearable.  This is mentioned merely to call attention to the fact that great  differences of opinion exist among scientific men regarding this  important subject.    In the author's practice, he was curious to try the different methods,  and has tuned by all the systems of temperament in vogue at the  present, or that have ever been used extensively. His experience has  proved that all but one is hampered with uncertainty, difficulty of  execution or imperfection in some respect.    A system which will positively insure the strictest uniformity of  difference in pitch of any given interval in all the keys, and that  makes use of the fewest intervals in tuning and the easiest  ones--those in which a discrepancy is most readily perceived by the  ear, is the best system to adopt and follow. Such a system is the one  followed by the author for years with the most satisfying results. He  does not claim any high honor by this statement, but does claim that,  while his system differs but slightly from some of the others, it is  more certain to produce the best results, is the simplest to  understand, is the easiest to follow, and, consequently, is the best.    To become a piano tuner of the highest skill, many things are  necessary; but what may be lacking at the outset may be acquired by  study and practice. More depends upon the ear than upon anything else;  but no person, however talented, has a sufficiently acute perception  to tune perfectly without some culture. Some practice in tuning is  necessary to bring the ear to that acuteness of perception so  indispensable in certain portions of the instrument. It may also be  said that no extraordinary talent for music is absolutely necessary,  since many of the best tuners are not musicians in any sense of the  word. Patience and perseverance, associated with conscientiousness and  an insatiable desire to excel, are among the foremost requirements.  Having these it only remains to gain a thorough knowledge of every  detail of the work; a little practice will bring skill and dexterity.    Finally, we would impress the student with the strenuous importance of  thoroughly mastering the lessons which immediately follow. You should  be inspired with the utmost confidence, both in yourself and in the  possibilities of the profession to those who merit a reputation. And,  while this lesson contains little technical instruction, if by its  study the pupil is impressed with the maxims herein presented, and is  inspired to make earnest effort in his future work, both in acquiring  and in practicing the art of Piano Tuning, the author will feel that  its mission is, by no means, the least significant one in the course.          LESSON VIII.    ~THE TEMPERAMENT.~      Some tuners favor the term, \"laying the bearings,\" others say \"setting  the temperament.\" The former is more commonplace, as it merely  suggests the idea of laying a number of patterns by which all others  are to be measured. The latter term is extremely comprehensive. A  lucid definition of the word \"temperament,\" in the sense in which it  is used here, would require a discourse of considerable length. The  following statements will elicit the full meaning of the term:    The untutored would, perhaps, not think of setting a temperament to  tune by. He would likely begin at some unfavorable point, and tune by  various intervals, relying wholly upon his conception of pitch for the  accuracy of the tones tuned, the same as a violinist in tuning his  four strings.
