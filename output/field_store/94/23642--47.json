[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16546"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 2 (#8)"],[1," this is not a late travesty of Buddhism but a relatively  early development which must have begun about the Christian era. The  principal works in which it is preached are the Greater  Sukhavati-vyuha or Description of the Happy Land, translated into  Chinese between 147 and 186 A.D., the lesser work of the same name  translated in 402 A.D. and the Sutra of meditation on Amitayus[83]  translated in 424. The first of these works purports to be a discourse  of Sakyamuni himself, delivered on the Vulture's Peak in answer to the  questions of Ananda. He relates how innumerable ages ago there was a  monk called Dharmakara who, with the help of the Buddha of that  period, made a vow or vows[84] to become a Buddha but on conditions.  That is to say he rejected the Buddhahood to which he might become  entitled unless his merits obtained certain advantages for others, and  having obtained Buddhahood on these conditions he can now cause them  to be fulfilled. In other words he can apportion his vast store of  accumulated merit to such persons and in such manner as he chooses.  The gist of the conditions is that he should when he obtained  Buddhahood be lord of a paradise whose inhabitants live in unbroken  happiness until they obtain Nirvana. All who have thought of this  paradise ten times are to be admitted therein, unless they have  committed grievous sin, and Amitabha will appear to them at the moment  of death so that their thoughts may not be troubled. The Buddha shows  Ananda a miraculous vision of this paradise and its joys are described  in language recalling the account of the New Jerusalem in the book of  Revelation and, though coarser pleasures are excluded, all the  delights of the eye and ear, such as jewels, gardens, flowers, rivers  and the songs of birds await the faithful.    The smaller Sukhavati-vyuha, represented as preached by Sakyamuni at  Sravasti, is occupied almost entirely with a description of the  paradise. It marks a new departure in definitely preaching salvation  by faith only, not by works, whereas the previous treatise, though  dwelling on the efficacy of faith, also makes merit a requisite for  life in heaven. But the shorter discourse says dogmatically \"Beings  are not born in that Buddha country as a reward and result of good  works performed in this present life. No, all men or women who hear  and bear in mind for one, two, three, four, five, six or seven nights  the name of Amitayus, when they come to die, Amitayus will stand  before them in the hour of death, they will depart this life with  quiet minds and after death they will be born in Paradise.\"    The Amitayur-dhyana-sutra also purports to be the teaching of  Sakyamuni and has an historical introduction connecting it with Queen  Vaidehi and King Bimbisara. In theology it is more advanced than the  other treatises: it is familiar with the doctrine of Dharma-kaya  (which will be discussed below) and it represents the rulers of  paradise as a triad, Amitayus being assisted by Avalokita and  Mahasthamaprapta.[85] Admission to the paradise can be obtained in  various ways, but the method recommended is the practice of a series  of meditations which are described in detail. The system is  comprehensive, for salvation can be obtained by mere virtue with  little or no prayer but also by a single invocation of Amitayus, which  suffices to free from deadly sins.    Strange as such doctrines appear when set beside the Pali texts, it is  clear that in their origin and even in the form which they assume in  the larger Sukhavati-vyuha they are simply an exaggeration of ordinary  Mahayanist teaching.[86] Amitabha is merely a monk who devotes himself  to the religious life, namely seeking _bodhi_ for the good of others.  He differs from every day devotees only in the degree of sanctity and  success obtained by his exertions. The operations which he performs  are nothing but examples on a stupendous scale of parinamana or the  assignment of one's own merits to others. His paradise, though in  popular esteem equivalent to the Persian or Christian heaven, is not  really so: strictly speaking it is not an ultimate ideal but a blessed  region in which Nirvana may be obtained without toil or care.    Though this teaching had brilliant success in China and Japan, where  it still flourishes, the worship of Amitabha was never predominant in  India. In Nepal and Tibet he is one among many deities: the Chinese  pilgrims hardly mention him: his figure is not particularly frequent  in Indian iconography[87] and, except in the works composed specially  in his honour, he appears as an incidental rather than as a necessary  figure. The whole doctrine is hardly strenuous enough for Indians. To  pray to the Buddha at the end of a sinful life, enter his paradise and  obtain ultimate Nirvana in comfort is not only open to the same charge  of egoism as the Hinayana scheme of salvation but is much easier and  may lead to the abandonment of religious effort. And the Hindu, who  above all things likes to busy himself with his own salvation, does  not take kindly to these expedients. Numerous deities promise a long  spell of heaven as a reward for the mere utterance of their names,[88]  yet the believer continues to labour earnestly in ceremonies or  meditation. It would be interesting to know whether this doctrine of  salvation by the utterance of a single name or prayer originated among  Buddhists or Brahmans. In any case it is closely related to old ideas  about the magic power of Vedic verses.    The five Jinas and other supernatural personages are often regarded as  manifestations of a single Buddha-force and at last this force is  personified as Adi-Buddha.[89] This admittedly theistic form of  Buddhism is late and is recorded from Nepal, Tibet (in the Kalacakra  system) and Java, a distribution which implies that it was exported  from Bengal.[90] But another form in which the Buddha-force is  impersonal and analogous to the Parabrahma of the Vedanta is much  older. Yet when this philosophic idea is expressed in popular language  it comes very near to Theism. As Kern has pointed out, Buddha is not  called Deva or Isvara in the Lotus simply because he is above such  beings. He declares that he has existed and will exist for  incalculable ages and has preached and will preach in innumerable  millions of worlds. His birth here and his nirvana are illusory,  kindly devices which may help weak disciples but do not mark the real  beginning and end of his activity. This implies a view of Buddha's  personality which is more precisely defined in the doctrine known as  Trikaya or the three bodies[91] and expounded in the  Mahayana-sutralankara, the Awakening of Faith, the Suvarna-prabhasa  sutra[92] and many other works. It may be stated dogmatically as  follows, but it assumes somewhat divergent forms according as it is  treated theologically or metaphysically.    A Buddha has three bodies or forms of existence. The first is the  Dharma-kaya, which is the essence of all Buddhas. It is true knowledge  or Bodhi. It may also be described as Nirvana and also as the one  permanent reality underlying all phenomena and all individuals. The  second is the Sambhoga-kaya, or body of enjoyment, that is to say the  radiant and superhuman form in which Buddhas appear in their paradises  or when otherwise manifesting themselves in celestial splendour. The  third is the Nirmana-kaya, or the body of transformation, that is to  say the human form worn by Sakyamuni or any other Buddha and regarded  as a transformation of his true nature and almost a distortion,  because it is so partial and inadequate an expression of it. Later  theology regards Amitabha, Amitayus and Sakyamuni as a series  corresponding to the three bodies. Amitabha does not really express  the whole Dharma-kaya, which is incapable of personification, but when  he is accurately distinguished from Amitayus (and frequently they are  regarded as synonyms) he is made the more remote and ethereal of the  two. Amitayus with his rich ornaments and his flask containing the  water of eternal life is the ideal of a splendidly beneficent saviour  and represents the Sambhoga-kaya.[93] Sakyamuni is the same beneficent  being shrunk into human form. But this is only one aspect, and not the  most important, of the doctrine of the three bodies. We can easily  understand the Sambhoga-kaya and Nirmana-kaya: they correspond to a  deity such as Vishnu and his incarnation Krishna, and they are  puzzling in Buddhism simply because we think naturally of the older  view (not entirely discarded by the Mahayana) which makes the human  Buddha the crown and apex of a series of lives that find in him their  fulfilment. But it is less easy to understand the Dharma-kaya.    The word should perhaps be translated as body of the law and the  thought originally underlying it may have been that the essential  nature of a Buddha, that which makes him a Buddha, is the law which he  preaches. As we might say, the teacher lives in his teaching: while it  survives, he is active and not dead.    The change from metaphor to theology is illustrated by Hsuean Chuang  when he states[94] (no doubt quoting from his edition of the Pitakas)  that Gotama when dying said to those around him \"Say not that the  Tathagata is undergoing final extinction: his spiritual presence  abides for ever unchangeable.\" This apparently corresponds to the  passage in the Pali Canon,[95] which runs \"It may be that in some of  you the thought may arise, the word of the Master is ended: we have no  more a teacher. But it is not thus that you should regard it. The  truths and the rules which I have set forth, let them, after I am  gone, be the Teacher to you.\" But in Buddhist writings, including the  oldest Pali texts, Dharma or Dhamma has another important meaning. It  signifies phenomenon or mental state (the two being identical for an  idealistic philosophy) and comprises both the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16572"],[0,"Indians of the Yosemite Valley and Vicinity (#8)"],[1,"are the finest made, but are very  seldom seen by any white person, and are not for sale at any  price. This finest style of work seems to have been made a  specialty by certain of the most artistic workers in each tribe.    [Illustration: MRS. JORGENSEN'S COLLECTION OF BASKETS.  For the mythical origin of basket-making in the Yosemite see  \"Legend of To-tau-kon-nu'-la and Tis-sa'-ack.\"]    At the present time, in their more modern style of living, they  do not require so many baskets, and the industry of making them  is fast on the decline. Some of the old women, however, still  continue to make such as are required for their own use, and a  few others for sale.    Most of the ornamental figures and designs worked into the finest  basketry are symbolical in character, and of so ancient an origin  that Indians of the present day do not know what many of them are  intended to represent. They have simply been copied from time  immemorial, with the idea that they were necessary for the  complete finish and beauty of the article made.    In recent years they sometimes make use of more modern styles of  ornamentation, which they see in print.    [Illustration: _Photograph by Fiske_.  INDIAN BEAD WORK.  Mrs. George Fiske's collection of Yosemite and Pai-ute' bead  work.]    Many of the young women are now giving their attention to making  fancy bead work, in the form of ornamental belts and hat-bands,  but this is an industry of very modern origin. Some of them are  employed by white people to do laundry and other work, and any  labor of this kind pays them better than making baskets for sale.  Forty years ago a finely made basket could have been bought for  less than ten dollars. At present, if the time spent in getting  and preparing the necessary materials, and in working them into  the basket, were paid for at the same rate per day that a young  woman receives for doing washing in the hotel laundry, or for  private families, it would amount to over one hundred dollars.    Most of the baskets made for domestic use are so closely woven  that they are practically water-tight, and are used for cooking  and similar purposes. Over on the eastern side of the Sierra  Nevada Mountains, near the dry, desert country, the Indians make  some of their baskets in the form of jugs of various sizes. These  are smeared over with a pitch composition, which renders them  perfectly water-tight, and they are used for carrying water when  traveling over those desolate, sandy wastes.      BOWS AND ARROWS.    The Indian men showed no less ingenuity artistic skill in their  special lines of work than the women, especially in manufacture  of their bows and arrows, in the making of fish lines and coarser  twine out of the soft, flexible bark of the milkweed (_Asclepias  speciosa_), and in making other useful implements and utensils  with the very limited means at their disposal.    Their bows were made of a branch of the incense cedar  (_Libocedrus decurrens_), or of the California nutmeg (_Tumion  Californicum [Torreya])_, made flat on the outer side, and  rounded smooth on the inner or concave side when the bow is  strung for use. The flat, outer side was covered with sinew,  usually that from the leg of a deer, steeped in hot water until  it became soft and glutinous, and then laid evenly and smoothly  over the wood, and so shaped at the ends as to hold the string in  place. When thoroughly dry the sinew contracted, so that the bow  when not strung was concave on the outer side.    [Illustration: _Photograph by Boysen._  A BASKET MAKER.  She is weaving a burden basket. The one to the left is for  cooking, and a baby basket stands against the tent.]    When not in use the bow was always left unstrung. To string it  for use, it was necessary in cold weather to warm it, thus making  it more elastic and easily bent. The best strings were also  made of sinew, or of pax-wax cartilage, for their finest bows.    The arrows were made of reeds and various kinds of wood,  including the syringa (_Philadelphus Lewisii_) and a small shrub  or tree which the Indians called _Le-ham'-i-tee,_ or  arrow-wood, and which grew quite plentifully in what is now known  as Indian Canyon, near the Yosemite Falls.    The finest arrows were furnished with points made of obsidian, or  volcanic glass, which was obtained in the vicinity of Mono Lake  on the eastern side of the Sierras. It required great care and  delicate skill to work this brittle material into the fine sharp  points, and the making of them seemed to be a special business or  trade with some of the old men. Arrows furnished with these  points were only used in hunting large game, or in hostile combat  with enemies; for common use, in hunting small game, the hard  wooden arrow was merely sharpened to a point.    The butt, or end used on the string, was furnished with three or  four short strips of feathers taken from a hawk's wing, and  fastened on lengthwise. These strips of feathers are supposed to  aid in the more accurate flight of the arrow when shot from the  bow.    When out on a hunt the Indian carried his bow strung ready for  use, and his bundle of assorted arrows in a quiver made of the  skin of a small fox, wild-cat or fisher, hung conveniently over  his shoulder.    These primitive weapons, which were in universal use by the  Yosemite Indians fifty years ago, are now never seen except in  some collection of Indian relics and curios.    Other articles manufactured by these tribes were stone hammers,  and also others made from the points of deer horns mounted on  wooden handles, which they used in delicately chipping the  brittle obsidian in forming arrowheads. Rude musical instruments,  principally drums and flageolets, were also made.          Chapter Seven.    MYTHS AND LEGENDS.      The Indians of the Yosemite Valley and vicinity have a great fund  of mythological lore, which has been handed down verbally from  generation to generation for hundreds of years, but they are very  reluctant to speak of these legends to white people, and it is  extremely difficult to get reliable information on the subject.  Moreover, the Indians most familiar with them have not a  sufficient knowledge of the English language to be able to  express their ideas clearly.    Many Yosemite legends have been published at different times and  in various forms, and it is probable that most of them have had  at least a foundation in real Indian myths, but many are  obviously fanciful in some particulars, and it is impossible to  tell how much is of Indian origin and how much is due to poetic  embellishment. When asked about some of these legends, many years  ago, one of the old Yosemite Indians remarked contemptuously,  \"White man too much lie.\"    On the other hand, red men as well as white men are sometimes  given to romancing, and I have known of cases where \"legends\"  would be manufactured on the spur of the moment by some young  Indian to satisfy an importunate and credulous questioner, to the  keen but suppressed amusement of other Indians present.    It will therefore be seen that this subject is surrounded with  some difficulty, and it must not be understood that the legends  here given are vouched for as of wholly Indian origin. Some of  them, notably those of the Tul-tok'-a-na and the second legend  of Tis-sa'-ack, have been accepted by eminent ethnologists, and  are believed to be purely aboriginal, while others have doubtless  been somewhat idealized in translation and in the course of  numerous repetitions.    The legend of To-tau-kon-nu'-la and Tis-sa'-ack is made up of  fragments of mythological lore obtained from a number of old  Indians at various times during the past fifty years. It varies  somewhat from other legends which have been published regarding  these same characters, but it is well known that the Indians  living in Yosemite in recent years are of mixed tribal origin and  do not all agree as to the traditional history of the region, nor  the names of the prominent scenic features, nor even of the  Valley itself. And this largely accounts for the fact that some  of the legends do not harmonize with each other in details or in  sentiment. All of them, however, are picturesque, and they  certainly give an added interest to the natural beauties and  wonders with which they are associated.      LEGEND OF TO-TAU-KON-NU'-LA AND TIS-SA'-ACK.    Innumerable moons and snows have passed since the Great Spirit  guided a little band of his favorite children into the beautiful  vale of Ah-wah'-nee [Yosemite Valley], and bid them stop and  rest from their long and weary wanderings, which had lasted ever  since they had been separated by the great waters from the happy  land of their forefathers in the far distant _El-o'-win_  (West).    Here they found food in abundance for all. The rivers gave them  plenty of _la-pe'-si_ (trout). They found in the meadows sweet  _ha'-ker_ (clover), and sour _yu-yu-yu-mah_ (oxalis) for spring  medicine, and sweet _toon'-gy_ and other edible roots in  abundance. The trees and bushes yielded acorns, pine nuts, fruits  and berries. In the forests were herds of _he'-ker_ (deer) and  other animals, which gave meat for food and skins for clothing  and beds. And here they lived and multiplied, and, as instructed  by their medicine men, worshipped the Great Spirit which gave  them life, and the sun which warmed and made them happy.    [Illustration: _Photograph by Boysen_.  MARY.  Daughter of Captain John, one of the last Chiefs of the  Yosemites.]    They also kept in memory the happy land of their forefathers. The  story was told by the old people to the young, and they again  told it to their children from generation to generation, and they  all believed that after death their spirits would return to dwell  forever in that distant country.    They prospered and built other towns outside of Ah-wah'-nee,  and became a great nation. They learned wisdom by experience and"]]]
