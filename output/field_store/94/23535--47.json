The prizes of  victory were given to Napoleon Hurney, who had saved the lives of  fourteen persons, and to Marguerite Briand, for having supported and  taken care for forty-five years of her mistress, who had fallen from  wealth into the extremest poverty. M. de Salvandy, who bestowed these  prizes, delivered the usual eulogy on virtue in general, winding up with  praise of Louis Philippe and his reign, a thing more creditable perhaps  to the fidelity and consistency of the speaker, who has never renounced  his allegiance to the Orleans family, than proper to the occasion.    The literary prizes were distributed by M. Villemain. The grand prize of  ten thousand francs for the best work on the history of France, was given  to Augustin Thierry. Emile Angier received a prize of seven thousand  francs for his comedy of \"Gabrielle,\" and M. Antran one of three thousand  for his \"Daughter of AEsehylus.\" Three ladies got prizes worth two  thousand francs each for works of a popular nature on moral subjects; M.  A. Garnier got one of one thousand for his _Morale Sociale_; M. Martin  the same for his _Philosophie Spiritualiste de la Nature_, and M. Kastus  the same for his _Psycologie d'Aristote_. The crown for the best  specimen of eloquence was awarded to M. Baudrillast for his Eulogy on  Madame de Stael, in which the literary history and character of the  subject were served up in the most florid style. The same writer once  before won the same prize by a eulogy on Turgot. His productions are more  elaborate and showy than substantial and permanent in their character.    It must be said that this Academy is rather a respectable and slow-moving  institutution. The most illustrious names of France are not always  included in the list of its members. Neither Beranger nor Lamenais belong  to it. A writer in the Paris _National_ says that after three hours at  its meeting everybody he met in the street seemed to belong to the time  of Louis XI.           *       *       *       *       *    EDWARD EVERETT has been many years engaged in the collection and  arrangement of materials for a systematic Treatise on the Modern Law of  Nations; more especially in reference to those questions which nave been  discussed between the governments of the United States and Europe since  the Peace of 1783. This will be Mr. Everett's \"life poem.\" Hitherto he  has written nothing very long except the \"Defense of the Christian  Religion,\" published when he was about twenty-one years of age. We have  just received from Little & Brown their edition of the \"Orations and  Speeches\" of Mr. Everett, in two very large and richly-printed volumes,  which we shall hereafter notice more largely. These are to be followed,  at the author's leisure, by his Political Reports and Speeches and  Official Papers, in two large volumes, and his contributions to the  _North American Review_, which, if all included, we think will make four  others: so that his works, beside the new treatise above mentioned, will  be completed in not less than eight volumes. We are gratified at the  prospect of such a collection of these masterpieces of rhetoric, so full  of learning and wisdom, and infused by so genial a spirit. We wish some  publisher would give us in the same style all the writings of Alexander  Everett.    CHARLES MACKAY has lately published in London, a work upon which he had  long been engaged, under the title of \"Progress of the Intellect.\" We  suspect, from the reviewals of it which appear in the journals, that it  is of the German free thinking class of philosophical histories. It  embraces dissertations on Intellectual Religion, Ancient Cosmogony, the  Metaphysical Idea of God, the Moral Notion of God, the Theory of  Mediation, Hebrew Theory of Retribution and Immortality, the Messianic  Theory prevailing in the days of Jesus, Christian Forms and Reforms, and  Speculative Christianity. And these dissertations are written with an  eloquence and power unexampled in a work of so much learning.           *       *       *       *       *    M. AND MAD. DE LAMARTINE having returned from the East, are at present  Staying at the Villa du Prado, a branch of the Hotel des Empereurs, a  pleasant house on the banks of the Huveaune, in the midst of the most  beautiful landscape. It was in a country box, upon the Avenue du Prado,  that Lamartine wrote, in 1847, his \"Histoire des Girondins.\" Lamartine is  pleased with his Smyrna estate; he was received there by his vassals _en  grand seigneur_, but he found that he would be obliged to expend a good  deal of money before the estate would be profitable.           *       *       *       *       *    THEODORE PARKER'S \"Massachusetts Quarterly Review,\" is dead, and--God be  Praised that New England refused to support it any longer. Mr. Parker  says in the farewell to his readers, that the work \"has never become what  its projector designed that it should be;\" and expresses a hope that  \"some new journal will presently be started, in a more popular form,  which will promote the great ideas of our times, by giving them an  expression in literature, and so help them to a permanent organization in  the life of mankind.\"           *       *       *       *       *    CAPT. SIR EDWARD BELCHER, R.N., known in the literary and scientific  world by his extensive voyages of survey and discovery, is now on a visit  to New York, whence he will shortly proceed to Texas.

It consists simply of a prize of twenty thousand francs offered  to the competition of the literary and artistic world. The first year it  will be given to the best among the poems, romances, and dramatic works  submitted; the second year to the best picture; the third year to the  best piece of statuary; the fourth year to the best piece of music,  whether sacred or profane, opera or oratorio. This circle having been  completed, the prize will next be given as at the first year; and so on  in regular succession. The successful competitor is to remain proprietor  of his work, as are all the others. The prize will he allotted by two  committees, one at Weimar the other at Berlin. The establishment of the  fund was celebrated at Weimar on the 23d of August.           *       *       *       *       *    GIFFORD, some five-and-twenty years ago, declared that all the fools of  the country had taken to write plays; and it would appear that all the  dull Englishmen of our day have taken to write pamphlets on the  slave-trade. The London _Times_ is very severe upon a book just issued by  Mr. W. Gore Ouseley, who was several years British Charge d'Affaires at  Rio, as such conducted a voluminous correspondence on the subject with  the government of Brazil, and might have been expected to have there  learned something on the slave-trade worth telling. According to his  reviewer he appears, however, to be one of that class of persons  described by Sterne, who, traveling from Dan to Beersheba, found all to  be barren; and no amount of observation can in any human being supply  defective reasoning faculties. So, says the _Times_, he has little or  nothing to say about the Brazilian slave-trade that has not been better  said a thousand times before; and when he does venture on a special  statement of his own, it topples down the whole superstructure of his  argument.    A work of rather more interest is \"Seven Years' Service on the Slave  Coast of Africa\", by Sir Henry Huntley, who, when a lieutenant in the navy  in 1831, was ordered to the scene of his observations. Shortly after his  arrival, he was appointed to the independent command of a small vessel,  in which he visited stations, looked out for slavers, chased them when he  saw them, and captured them when he could. A few years subsequently he  was nominated Governor of the settlements on the Gambia. His two volumes  contain his adventures during the whole or nearly the whole of his seven  years' service upon the station; the last closing abruptly in the middle  of preparations for a congress of black kings. The public is already  familiar with many of the topics, from the occasional narratives of  voyages and adventures along the coast. Visits to the commandants of the  so-called castles; a description of the European and native mode of life  at the settlements; accounts of the slave-stations, the slave-dealers,  the slaves, and the slave-trade, together with sketches of more  legitimate commerce, and occasional trips to the islands lying off the  coast, for change of air and fresh supplies, are frequent features. Sir  Henry Huntley's duties sometimes brought him in contact with native  chiefs, and continually with slavers, in the search, the capture, and the  pursuit. During the latter part of his career, the office of Governor  gave great variety and largeness to his subjects; consisting of public  business, palavers with native potentates, and matters connected with  home policy. In point of literary character this work very nearly  resembles the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14451"],[0,"African Camp Fires (#8)"],[1,"more baggage, stepped briskly  aboard a very bobby little craft, clambered over a huge pile of baggage,  and stowed ourselves as best we could. A figure in a long white robe sat  astern, tiller ropes in hand; two half-naked blacks far up towards the  prow manipulated a pair of tremendous sweeps. With a vast heaving,  jabbering, and shouting, our boat disengaged itself from the swarm of  other craft. We floated around the stern of our ship, and were  immediately suspended in blackness dotted with the stars and their  reflections, and with various twinkling scattered lights. To one of  these we steered, and presently touched at a stone quay with steps. At  last we set foot on the land to which so long we had journeyed and  towards which our expectations had grown so great. We experienced \"the  pleasure that touches the souls of men landing on strange shores.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [2] 82-88 deg. degrees in daytime, and 75-83 deg. degrees at night.          VIII.    MOMBASA.      A single light shone at the end of the stone quay, and another inside a  big indeterminate building at some distance. We stumbled towards this,  and found it to be the biggest shed ever constructed out of corrugated  iron. A bearded Sikh stood on guard at its open entrance. He let any one  and every one enter, with never a flicker of his expressionless black  eyes; but allowed no one to go out again without the closest scrutiny  for dutiable articles that lacked the blue customs plaster. We entered.  The place was vast and barnlike and dim, and very, very hot. A  half-dozen East Indians stood behind the counters; another, a babu, sat  at a little desk ready to give his clerical attention to what might be  required. We saw no European; but next morning found that one passed his  daylight hours in this inferno of heat. For the moment we let our main  baggage go, and occupied ourselves only with getting through our smaller  effects. This accomplished, we stepped out past the Sikh into the  grateful night.    We had as guide a slender and wiry individual clad in tarboush and long  white robe. In a vague, general way we knew that the town of Mombasa was  across the island and about four miles distant. In what direction or how  we got there we had not the remotest idea.    The guide set off at a brisk pace with which we tried in vain to keep  step. He knew the ground, and we did not; and the night was black dark.  Commands to stop were of no avail whatever; nor could we get hold of him  to restrain him by force. When we put on speed he put on speed too. His  white robe glimmered ahead of us just in sight; and in the darkness  other white robes, passing and crossing, glimmered also. At first the  ground was rough, so that we stumbled outrageously. Billy and B. soon  fell behind, and I heard their voices calling plaintively for us to slow  down a bit.    \"If I ever lose this nigger, I'll never find him again,\" I shouted back,  \"but I can find you. Do the best you can!\"    We struck a smoother road that led up a hill on a long slant.  Apparently for miles we followed thus, the white-robed individual ahead  still deaf to all commands and the blood-curdling threats I had now come  to uttering. All our personal baggage had long since mysteriously  disappeared, ravished away from us at the customs house by a ragged  horde of blacks. It began to look as though we were stranded in Africa  without baggage or effects. Billy and B. were all the time growing  fainter in the distance, though evidently they too had struck the long,  slanting road.    Then we came to a dim, solitary lantern glowing feebly beside a bench at  what appeared to be the top of the hill. Here our guide at last came to  a halt and turned to me a grinning face.    \"Samama hapa,\" he observed.    There! That was the word I had been frantically searching my memory for!  Samama--stop!    The others struggled in. We were very warm. Up to the bench led a tiny  car track, the rails not over two feet apart, like the toy railroads  children use. This did not look much like grownup transportation, but it  and the bench and the dim lantern represented all the visible world.    We sat philosophically on the bench and enjoyed the soft tropical  night. The air was tepid, heavy with unknown perfume, black as a band of  velvet across the eyes, musical with the subdued undertones of a  thousand thousand night insects. At points overhead the soft blind  darkness melted imperceptibly into stars.    After a long interval we distinguished a distant faint rattling, that  each moment increased in loudness. Shortly came into view along the  narrow tracks a most extraordinary vehicle. It was a small square  platform on wheels, across which ran a bench seat, and over which spread  a canopy. It carried also a dim lantern. This rumbled up to us and  stopped. From its stern hopped two black boys. Obeying a smiling  invitation, we took our places on the bench. The two boys immediately  set to pushing us along the narrow track.    We were off at an astonishing speed through the darkness. The night was  deliciously tepid; and, as I have said, absolutely dark. We made out the  tops of palms and the dim loom of great spreading trees, and could smell  sweet, soft odours. The bare-headed, lightly-clad boys pattered  alongside whenever the grade was easy, one hand resting against the  rail; or pushed mightily up little hills; or clung alongside like  monkeys while we rattled and swooped and plunged down hill into the  darkness. Subsequently we learned that a huge flat beam projecting  amidships from beneath the seat operated a brake which we above were  supposed to manipulate; but being quite ignorant as to the ethics and  mechanics of this strange street-car system, we swung and swayed at  times quite breathlessly.    After about fifteen minutes we began to pick up lights ahead, then to  pass dimly-seen garden walls with trees whose brilliant flowers the  lantern revealed fitfully. At last we made out white stucco houses, and  shortly drew up with a flourish before the hotel itself.    This was a two-story stucco affair, with deep verandas sunken in at each  story. It fronted a wide white street facing a public garden; and this,  we subsequently discovered, was about the only clear and open space in  all the narrow town. Antelope horns were everywhere hung on the walls;  and teakwood easy-chairs, with rests on which comfortably to elevate  your feet above your head, stood all about. We entered a bare,  brick-floored dining-room, and partook of tropical fruits quite new to  us--papayes, mangoes, custard apples, pawpaws, and the small red eating  bananas too delicate for export. Overhead the punkahs swung back and  forth in lazy hypnotic rhythm. We could see the two blacks at the ends  of the punkah cords outside on the veranda, their bodies swaying lithely  in alternation as they threw their weight against the light ropes. Other  blacks, in the long white robes and exquisitely worked white skull caps  of the Swahili, glided noiselessly on bare feet, serving.    After dinner we sat out until midnight in the teakwood chairs of the  upper gallery, staring through the arches into the black, mysterious  night, for it was very hot, and we rather dreaded the necessary mosquito  veils as likely to prove stuffy. The mosquitoes are few in Mombasa, but  they are very deadly--very. At midnight the thermometer stood 87 deg. F.    Our premonitions as to stuffiness were well justified. After a restless  night we came awake at daylight to the sound of a fine row of some sort  going on outside in the streets. Immediately we arose, threw aside the  lattices, and hung out over the sill.    The chalk-white road stretched before us. Opposite was a public square,  grown with brilliant flowers, and flowering trees. We could not doubt  the cause of the trouble. An Indian on a bicycle, hurrying to his  office, had knocked down a native child. Said child, quite naked, sat  in the middle of the white dust and howled to rend the heavens--whenever  he felt himself observed. If, however, the attention of the crowd  happened for the moment to be engrossed with the babu, the injured one  sat up straight and watched the row with interested, rolling, pickaninny  eyes. A native policeman made the centre of a whirling, vociferating  group. He was a fine-looking chap, straight and soldierly, dressed in  red tarboosh, khaki coat bound close around the waist by yards and yards  of broad red webbing, loose, short drawers of khaki, bare knees and  feet, and blue puttees between. His manner was inflexible. The babu  jabbered excitedly; telling, in all probability, how he was innocent of  fault, was late for his work, etc. In vain. He had to go; also the kid,  who now, seeing himself again an object of interest, recommenced his  howling. Then the babu began frantically to indicate members of the  crowd whom he desired to retain as witnesses. Evidently not pleased with  the prospect of appearing in court, those indicated promptly ducked and  ran. The policeman as promptly pursued and collared them one by one. He  was a long-legged policeman, and he ran well. The moment he laid hands  on a fugitive, the latter collapsed; whereupon the policeman dropped him  and took after another. The joke of it was that the one so abandoned did  not try again to make off, but stayed as though he had been tagged at  some game. Finally the whole lot, still vociferating, moved off down the  white road.    For over an hour we hung from our window sill, thoroughly interested and  amused by the varied life that deployed before our eyes. The morning  seemed deliciously cool after the hot night, although the thermometer  stood high. The sky was very blue, with big piled white clouds down near  the horizon. Dazzling sun shone on the white road, the white buildings  visible up and down the street, the white walls enclosing their gardens,  and the greenery and colours of the trees within them."]]]
