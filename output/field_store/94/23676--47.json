DEPOSITIONS AGAINST COLLAS BECQUET.    _MAY 17, 1617._    _Susanne Le Tellier_, widow of _Pierre Rougier_, deposed that after  her husband was dead she found witches' spells in his bed; and that  while he was upon his said deathbed he complained of being bewitched  by _Collas Becquet_, with whom he had had a quarrel, and who during  the quarrel told him he would repent of it; whereupon he was taken  with ...[A], whereof he was ill for twelve days; they also found  forty-four witches' spells in her child's pillow, some of which were  made like hedgehogs, others round like apples, and others again flat  like the palm of the hand; and they were of hempen thread twisted with  feathers.    [Footnote A: Illegible in the record.]    _Susanne_, wife of _Jean Le Messurier_, deposed that her husband and  _Collas Becquet_ had angry words together one day; they had an infant  about six weeks old, and as she was undressing it in the evening to  put it to bed, there fell upon the stomach of the said infant, a  black beast which melted away as soon as it fell, so that although she  carefully sought for it, she could never discover what had become of  it; immediately afterwards the infant was taken ill and would not  suck, but was much tormented; being advised to look into the said  infant's pillow, she found there several witches' spells sewn with  thread; these she took out and carefully dressed all the feathers in  the pillow; yet when she examined it again a week afterwards, she  found there a black bean with a hole in it; of which, the said  _Becquet_ hearing that he was suspected, his wife came to witness's  house while the said _Becquet_ was at sea, and told her that on  account of the rumour which witness had raised about her husband, he  the said _Becquet_ would thrash the said _Messurier_, her husband, and  herself, and would kill them; after that, witness went to their house  to say they were not afraid either of him or her, or of their threats  to kill her husband and her; witness had six big chickens which ran  after their mother, going out of the house in the morning and  returning at night; and one by one they began to jump up against the  chimney and eat the soot, so that they all died one after the other,  ...[B] as they jumped, until the last one which remained alive up to  one hour of daybreak, when it died; after they had told this to _Mr.  de Lisle_, and he had threatened the people, her infant recovered and  remained well.    [Footnote B: Illegible in the record.]    _Collas Rougier_ deposed that his brother _Pierre Rougier_ when dying  charged _Collas Becquet_ with causing his death.    _Collas Hugues_ reported that being at a wedding, _Collas Becquet_  arrived there, and began to toy with his daughter-in-law, who repelled  his advances; the very same evening she was taken ill in such a manner  that they thought she would have died from one hour to another;  besides which she remained under the charm, and they found one of the  witches' spells in her bed, which was shown to the Members of the  Court, who were making an inspection at St. Peter's; the said girl  sometimes fell to the ground quite blinded.    The wife of the said _Hugues_ deposed to exactly the same as her  husband.    _Jean de Garis_, son of _William_, deposed that about two or three  years ago, having lent some money on pledge to _Collas Becquet_, he  asked him for the money, or else for a verification of his security;  when the said _Becquet_ replied that he would let him know what his  security was; the said _de Garis_ having then returned home, found his  daughter sick and afflicted; they found witches' spells and other  conjurations several times in their child's pillow; but the mother of  the said _Becquet_ having come to the said _de Garis's_ house, he gave  her a drink of water and half-a-loaf of bread, as he had been advised  to do; since which time they had found nothing more in the child's  pillow; however to avoid all risk of the said witches' spells they had  always since then let their child sleep upon straw; he fully believed  that this evil had come upon them by their means.    _Mr. Thomas de Lisle_ deposed that _Thomas Brouart_, who resided in  his house, having called the son of _Collas Becquet_ a wizard, it  happened that there was one day found in the said _Thomas's_ bed a  great number of maggots, which the said _Sieur de Lisle_ saw, and  compared to an ant-hill, so lively and thick were they, and they could  hardly clear the said child of them, although they put it in different  places; afterwards the said child gathered lice in such a manner that  although its shirts and clothes were changed every day they could not  free it; the said _Thomas Brouart_ also had a brand new vest, which  was so covered with lice that it was impossible to see the cloth, and  he was compelled to have it thrown among the cabbages; upon which he  went and threatened _Massi's_ wife that he would beat her if she did  not abstain from thus treating his child; and on returning he found  the said vest among the cabbages clear of lice, which had also since  then quitted the said _Brouart_.    _Jacques le Mesurier_ deposed that about two or three years ago he met  _Collas Becquet_ and _Perot Massi_, who had some fish and who moreover  owed him money; he wished to take some of their fish at a reduced  price, but they would not agree to it, and they quarrelled; whereupon  one of the two, either _Becquet_ or _Massi_, threatened him that he  would repent of it; and at the end of two or three days, he was seized  with a sickness in which he first burnt like fire and then was  benumbed with cold so that nothing would warm him, and this without  any cessation; he suffered in this way for nearly a month. _Collas  Becquet_ heard that witness charged him with being the cause of his  sickness, and he threatened that he would kill witness; but very soon  afterwards the said witness was cured; and he affirms and believes  that the said _Becquet_ and _Massy_, or one of them, was the cause of  his attack.           *       *       *       *       *    NOTE ON THE GUERNSEY RECORDS.    The Records at the Guernsey _Greffe_, from which the foregoing  confessions and depositions have been transcribed, and whence the  following list of accusations is compiled, are of a very voluminous  character. In fact there is enough matter in them, connected with  Witchcraft alone, to fill at least a couple of thick octavo volumes.  There is, however, so much sameness in the different cases, and such a  common tradition running through the whole, that the present excerpts  give a very fair idea of the features which characterise the mass.  While some of these Records are tolerably complete, the greater part  of them unfortunately are fragmentary and imperfect. The books in  which they were originally written seem to have been formed of a few  sheets of paper stitched together. Then at some later period a number  of these separate sections--in a more or less tattered condition--were  gathered into volumes and bound together in vellum. It is evident,  however, that very little care was exercised in their arrangement in  chronological order. The consequence is that one portion of a trial  sometimes occurs in one part of a volume, and the rest in another  part; sometimes the depositions alone seem to have been preserved;  sometimes the confessions; while in many cases the sentences  pronounced are all that can now be discovered. Nevertheless these old  Records enshrine much that is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17208"],[0,"The Tales of Mother Goose (#8)"],[1,"was quite confused, and answered not a word.    \"I see,\" replied Riquet with the Tuft, \"that this proposal does not  please you, and I do not wonder at it; but I will give you a whole year  to consider it.\"    The Princess had so little sense and, at the same time, so great a  longing to have some, that she imagined the end of that year would never  come, so she accepted the proposal which was made her.    She had no sooner promised Riquet with the Tuft that she would marry him  on that day twelvemonth than she found herself quite otherwise than she  was before: she had an incredible faculty of speaking whatever she had  in her mind in a polite, easy, and natural manner.    She began that moment a very gallant conversation with Riquet with the  Tuft, which she kept up at such a rate that Riquet with the Tuft  believed he had given her more sense than he had reserved for himself.    When she returned to the palace, the whole court knew not what to think  of such a sudden and extraordinary change; for they heard from her now  as much sensible discourse and as many infinitely witty phrases as they  had heard stupid and silly impertinences before. The whole court was  overjoyed beyond imagination at it. It pleased all but her younger  sister, because, having no longer the advantage of her in respect of  wit, she appeared in comparison with her a very disagreeable, homely  girl.    The King governed himself by her advice, and would even sometimes hold a  council in her apartment. The news of this change in the Princess spread  everywhere; the young princes of the neighboring kingdoms strove all  they could to gain her favor, and almost all of them asked her in  marriage; but she found not one of them had sense enough for her. She  gave them all a hearing, but would not engage herself to any.    However, there came one so powerful, so rich, so witty, and so handsome  that she could not help feeling a strong inclination toward him. Her  father perceived it, and told her that she was her own mistress as to  the choice of a husband, and that she might declare her intentions. She  thanked her father, and desired him to give her time to consider it.    She went by chance to walk in the same wood where she met Riquet with  the Tuft, the more conveniently to think what she ought to do. While she  was walking in a profound meditation, she heard a confused noise under  her feet, as it were of a great many people busily running backward and  forward. Listening more attentively, she heard one say:--    \"Bring me that pot,\" another, \"Give me that kettle,\" and a third, \"Put  some wood upon the fire.\"    The ground at the same time opened, and she saw under her feet a great  kitchen full of cooks, kitchen helps, and all sorts of officers  necessary for a magnificent entertainment. There came out of it a  company of cooks, to the number of twenty or thirty, who went to plant  themselves about a very long table set up in the forest, with their  larding pins in their hands and fox tails in their caps, and began to  work, keeping time to a very harmonious tune.    The Princess, all astonished at this sight, asked them for whom they  worked.    \"For Prince Riquet with the Tuft,\" said the chief of them, \"who is to be  married to-morrow.\"    The Princess, more surprised than ever, and recollecting all at once  that it was now that day twelvemonth on which she had promised to marry  the Prince Riquet with the Tuft, was ready to sink into the ground.    What made her forget this was that when she made this promise, she was  very silly; and having obtained that vast stock of sense which the  prince had bestowed upon her, she had entirely forgotten the things she  had done in the days of her stupidity. She continued her walk, but had  not taken thirty steps before Riquet with the Tuft presented himself to  her, gallant and most magnificently dressed, like a prince who was going  to be married.    \"You see, madam,\" said he, \"I am exact in keeping my word, and doubt not  in the least but you are come hither to perform your promise.\"    \"I frankly confess,\" answered the Princess, \"that I have not yet come to  a decision in this matter, and I believe I never shall be able to arrive  at such a one as you desire.\"    \"You astonish me, madam,\" said Riquet with the Tuft.    \"I can well believe it,\" said the Princess; \"and surely if I had to do  with a clown, or a man of no sense, I should find myself very much at a  loss. 'A princess always keeps her word,' he would say to me, 'and you  must marry me, since you promised to do so.' But as he to whom I talk  is the one man in the world who is master of the greatest sense and  judgment, I am sure he will hear reason. You know that when I was but a  fool I could scarcely make up my mind to marry you; why will you have  me, now I have so much judgment as you gave me, come to such a decision  which I could not then make up my mind to agree to? If you sincerely  thought to make me your wife, you have been greatly in the wrong to  deprive me of my dull simplicity, and make me see things much more  clearly than I did.\"    \"If a man of no wit and sense,\" replied Riquet with the Tuft, \"would be  well received, as you say, in reproaching you for breach of your word,  why will you not let me, madam, have the same usage in a matter wherein  all the happiness of my life is concerned? Is it reasonable that persons  of wit and sense should be in a worse condition than those who have  none? Can you pretend this, you who have so great a share, and desired  so earnestly to have it? But let us come to the fact, if you please.  Putting aside my ugliness and deformity, is there anything in me which  displeased you? Are you dissatisfied with my birth, my wit, my humor, or  my manners?\"    \"Not at all,\" answered the Princess; \"I love you and respect you in all  that you mention.\"    [Illustration: \"I AM EXACT IN KEEPING MY WORD.\" p. 61.]    \"If it be so,\" said Riquet with the Tuft, \"I am happy, since it is in  your power to make me the most amiable of men.\"    \"How can that be?\" said the Princess.    \"It is done,\" said Riquet with the Tuft, \"if you love me enough to wish  it was so; and that you may no ways doubt, madam, of what I say, know  that the same fairy who on my birthday gave me for gift the power of  making the person who should please me witty and judicious, has in like  manner given you for gift the power of making him whom you love and to  whom you would grant the favor, to be extremely handsome.\"    \"If it be so,\" said the Princess, \"I wish with all my heart that you may  be the most lovable prince in the world, and I bestow my gift on you as  much as I am able.\"    The Princess had no sooner pronounced these words than Riquet with the  Tuft appeared to her the finest prince upon earth, the handsomest and  most amiable man she ever saw. Some affirm that it was not the fairy's  charms, but love alone, which worked the change.    They say that the Princess, having made due reflection on the  perseverance of her lover, his discretion, and all the good qualities of  his mind, his wit and judgment, saw no longer the deformity of his body,  nor the ugliness of his face; that his hump seemed to her no more than  the grand air of one having a broad back, and that whereas till then  she saw him limp horribly, she now found it nothing more than a certain  sidling air, which charmed her.    They say further that his eyes, which were squinted very much, seemed to  her most bright and sparkling, that their irregularity passed in her  judgment for a mark of the warmth of his affection, and, in short, that  his great red nose was, in her opinion, somewhat martial and heroic in  character.    However it was, the Princess promised immediately to marry him, on  condition that he obtained the King's consent. The King, knowing that  his daughter highly esteemed Riquet with the Tuft, whom he knew also for  a most sage and judicious prince, received him for his son-in-law with  pleasure, and the next morning their nuptials were celebrated, as Riquet  with the Tuft had foreseen, and according to the orders he had given a  long time before.          BLUE BEARD.      Once upon a time there was a man who had fine houses, both in town and  country, a deal of silver and gold plate, carved furniture, and coaches  gilded all over. But unhappily this man had a blue beard, which made him  so ugly and so terrible that all the women and girls ran away from him.    One of his neighbors, a lady of quality, had two daughters who were  perfect beauties. He asked for one of them in marriage, leaving to her  the choice of which she would bestow on him. They would neither of them  have him, and they sent him backward and forward from one to the other,  neither being able to make up her mind to marry a man who had a blue  beard. Another thing which made them averse to him was that he had  already married several wives, and nobody knew what had become of them.    Blue Beard, to become better acquainted, took them, with their mother  and three or four of their best friends, with some young people of the  neighborhood to one of his country seats, where they stayed a whole  week.    There was nothing going on but pleasure parties, hunting, fishing,  dancing, mirth, and feasting. Nobody went to bed, but all passed the  night in playing pranks on each other. In short, everything succeeded so  well that the youngest daughter began to think that the beard of the  master of the house was not so very blue, and that he was a very civil  gentleman. So as soon as they returned home, the marriage was concluded.    About a month afterward Blue Beard told his wife that he was obliged to  take a country journey for six weeks at least, upon business of great  importance. He desired her to amuse herself well in his absence, to send  for her friends, to take them into the country, if she pleased, and to  live well wherever she was.    \"Here,\" said he, \"are the"]]]
