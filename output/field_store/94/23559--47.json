Fred had given up a great deal of what  boys hold dear, for the purpose of helping his mother, coasting and  skating being just at this time in perfection.    7. Besides this, his temper and his patience had been severely tried. He  had been in the habit of going early to school, and staying to play after  it was dismissed.    8. The boys missed him, and their curiosity was excited when he would give  no other reason for not coming to school earlier, or staying after school,  than that he was a \"wanted at home.\" \"I'll tell you,\" said Tom Barton,  \"I'll find him out, boys--see if I don't!\"    9. So he called for Fred to go to school, and on his way to the side door  walked lightly and somewhat nearer the kitchen window than was absolutely  needful. Looking in, he saw Fred standing at the table with a dishcloth in  his hand.    10. Of course he reported this at school, and various were the greetings  poor Fred received at recess. \"Well, you're a brave one to stay at home  washing dishes.\" \"Girl boy!\" \"Pretty Bessie!\" \"Lost your apron, have n't  you, Polly!\"    11. Fred was not wanting either in spirit or courage, and he was strongly  tempted to resent these insults and to fight some of his tormentors. But  his consciousness of right and his love for his mother helped him.    12. While he was struggling for self mastery, his teacher appeared at the  door of the schoolhouse. Fred caught his eye, and it seemed to look, if it  did not say, \"Don't give up! Be really brave!\" He knew the teacher had  heard the insulting taunts of his thoughtless schoolmates.    13. The boys received notice during the day that Fred must not be taunted  or teased in any manner. They knew that the teacher meant what he said;  and so the brave little boy had no farther trouble.      DEFINITIONS.--1. Lan'guid-ly, feebly. 5. Am'ply, fully. O-pin'ion,  judgment, belief. 9. Ab'so-lute-ly, wholly, entirely. 11. Re-sent', to  consider as an injury. Con'scious-ness, inward feeling, knowledge of what  passes in one's own mind.      EXERCISES.--Why did Fred offer to wash the dishes?  Was it a disgraceful thing to do? How was he rewarded?  How did his schoolmates show their lack of manliness?        XV. TRUE MANLINESS. (52)  (Concluded.)    1. \"Fire! fire!\" The cry crept out on the still night air, and the fire  bells began to ring. Fred was wakened by the alarm and the red light  streaming into his room. He dressed himself in a moment, almost, and  tapped at the door of his mother's bedroom.    2. \"It is Mr. Barton's house, mother. Do let me go,\" he said in eager,  excited tones. Mrs. Liscom thought a moment. He was young, but she could  trust him, and she knew how much his heart was in the request.    3. \"Yes, you may go,\" she answered; \"but be careful, my boy. If you can  help, do so; but do nothing rashly.\" Fred promised to follow her advice,  and hurried to the fire.    4. Mr. and Mrs. Barton were not at home. The house had been left in charge  of the servants. The fire spread with fearful speed, for there was a high  wind, and it was found impossible to save the house. The servants ran  about, screaming and lamenting, but doing nothing to any purpose.    5. Fred found Tom outside, in safety. \"Where is Katy?\" he asked. Tom,  trembling with terror, seemed to have had no thought but of his own  escape. He said, \"Katy is in the house!\" \"In what room?\" asked Fred. \"In  that one,\" pointing to a window in the upper story.    6. It was no time for words, but for instant, vigorous action. The  staircase was already on fire; there was but one way to reach Katy, and  that full of danger. The second floor might fall at any moment, and Fred  knew it. But he trusted in an arm stronger than his own, and silently  sought help and guidance.    7. A ladder was quickly brought, and placed against the house. Fred  mounted it, followed by the hired man, dashed in the sash of the window,  and pushed his way into the room where the poor child lay nearly  suffocated with smoke.    8. He roused her with some difficulty, carried her to the window, and  placed her upon the sill. She was instantly grasped by strong arms, and  carried down the ladder, Fred following as fast as possible. They had  scarcely reached the ground before a crash of falling timbers told them  that they had barely escaped with their lives.    9. Tom Barton never forgot the lesson of that night; and he came to  believe, and to act upon the belief, in after years, that true manliness  is in harmony with gentleness, kindness, and self-denial.      EXERCISES.--Relate the story of the fire. What is meant  by \"to any purpose,\" in paragraph four? Did Fred show any  lack of manliness when tested? What does this lesson teach?        XVI. THE BROWN THRUSH. (54)    Lucy Larcom, the author of the following poem, was born in 1826, and  passed many years of her life as a factory girl at Lowell, Mass. She died  in 1893.    1. There's a merry brown thrush sitting up in a tree;       \"He's singing to me! he's singing to me!\"     And what does he say, little girl, little boy?       \"Oh, the world's running over with joy!         Don't You hear? Don't you see?           Hush! look! In my tree     I'm as happy as happy can be!\"    2. And the brown thrush keeps singing, \"A nest do you see,       And five eggs hid by me in the juniper tree?     Don't meddle! don't touch! little girl, little boy,       Or the world will lose some of its joy!         Now I'm glad! now I'm free!           And I always shall be,     If you never bring sorrow to me.\"    3. So the merry brown thrush sings away in the tree,       To you and to me, to you and to me;     And he sings all the day, little girl, little boy,       \"Oh, the world's running over with joy!         But long it won't be,           Don't you know? Don't you see?     Unless we're as good as can be.\"    EXERCISES.--What is a thrush? Why was the thrush so  happy? Do you think he would have been happy if the little  boy or girl had robbed the nest?        XVII. A SHIP IN A STORM. (55)    1. Did you ever go far out upon the great ocean?  How beautiful it is to  be out at sea, when the sea is smooth and still!    2. Let a storm approach, and the scene is changed. The heavy, black clouds  appear in the distance, and throw a deep, deathlike shade over the world  of waters.    3. The captain and sailors soon see in the clouds the signs of evil. All  hands are then set to work to take in sail.    4. The hoarse notes of the captain, speaking through his trumpet, are  echoed from lip to lip among the rigging. Happy will it be, if all is made  snug before the gale strikes the vessel.    5. At last, the gale comes like a vast moving mountain of air. It strikes  the ship. The vessel heaves and groans under the dreadful weight, and  struggles to escape through the foaming waters.    6. If she is far out at sea, she will be likely to ride out the storm in  safety. But if the wind is driving her upon the shore, the poor sailors  will hardly escape being dashed upon the rocks, and drowned.    7. Once there was a ship in a storm. Some of her masts were already  broken, and her sails lost. While the wind was raging, and the billows  were dashing against her, the cry was heard, \"A man has fallen overboard!\"    8. Quickly was the boat lowered, and she was soon seen bounding on her way  over the mountain waves. At one moment, the boat seemed lifted to the  skies, and the next, it sank down, and appeared to be lost beneath the  waves!    9. At length, the man was found. He was well nigh drowned; but he was  taken on board, and now they made for the ship. But the ship rolled so  dreadfully, that it seemed certain death to go near her. And now, what  should they do?    10. The captain told one of the men to go aloft and throw down a rope.  This was made fast to the boat, and when the sea was somewhat calm it was  hoisted, and all fell down into the ship with a dreadful crash. It was a  desperate way of getting on board; but fortunately no lives were lost.    11. On the dangerous points along our seacoast are lighthouses, which can  be seen far out at sea, and serve as guides to ships. Sometimes the fog is  so dense that these lights can not be seen, but most lighthouses have  great fog bells or fog horns; some of the latter are made to sound by  steam, and can be heard for a long distance. These bells and horns are  kept sounding as long as the fog lasts.    12. There are also many life-saving stations along the coast where trained  men are ready with lifeboats. \"When a ship is driven ashore they at once  go to the rescue of those on board, and thus many valuable lives are  saved.    13. Take it all in all, a sailor's life is a very hard one. Our young  friends owe a debt of gratitude to those whose home is upon the great  waters, and who bring them the luxuries of other countries.      DEFINITIONS.--4. Ech'oed, sounded again. Gale, a wind storm. 5. Heaves,  pitches up and down. 7. Bil'lows, waves. 10. Des'-per-ate, hopeless. 11.  Fog, watery vapor, mist. 13. Grat'i-tude, thankfulness. Lux'u-ries, nice  things.      EXERCISES.--What is this lesson about? When is it dangerous to be at sea?  What do sailors then do? In what situation are they most likely to be  saved? Relate the story of the man overboard. Tell about the lighthouses.  How are vessels warned of danger in a fog? What about the life-saving  stations? What is said of a sailor's life?        XVIII. THE SAILOR'S CONSOLATION. (58)    Charles Dibdin, the author, was born at Southampton, England, in 1745. He  wrote a number of fine sea songs. He died in 1814.    1. One night came on a hurricane,     The sea was mountains rolling,     When Barney Buntline turned his quid,     And said to Billy Bowling:     \"A strong norwester's blowing, Bill;     Hark! don't ye hear it roar now?     Lord help 'em, how I pities all     Unhappy folks on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14883"],[0,"Grandmother Elsie (#8)"],[1,"in her mother's presence, supposing, I  presume, as I did, that not being able to speak or move, she was also  unable to hear or understand, but it was evident from the piteous  expression her countenance assumed and the tears coursing down her cheeky  that she did both.\"    \"Poor Louise! she has a sad reaping--so far as that ungrateful, undutiful  daughter is concerned; but Isa, Calhoun, and Arthur are of quite another  stamp.\"    \"Yes, indeed! she will surely find great comfort in them. I wish Isa was  not so far away. But you have not told me how my dear old father is. How  has he borne this shock?\"    \"It was a shock of course, especially to one so old and feeble; but I left  him calmly staying himself upon his God.\"    They arrived at Roselands some time before the ambulance. They found the  whole household, and also Mrs. Howard, her husband and sons, and Mrs.  Travilla, gathered upon the veranda to receive them.    Lora stood by her father's side and Elsie too was very near, both full of  loving care for him in this time of sore trial.    And Adelaide's first thought, first embrace, were for him. They wept a  moment in each other's arms.    \"Is she--is she alive?\" he faltered.    \"Yes, father, and we hope may get up again. Be comforted for her and for  yourself; because 'He doeth all things well,' and 'We know that all things  work together for good to them that love God.'\"    \"Yes, yes; and who can tell but this may be His appointed means for  bringing her into the fold!\"    There had been time for an exchange of greetings all around and a few  comforting words to the younger Conlys, when the ambulance was seen  entering the avenue.    With beating hearts and tearful eyes they watched its slow progress. Lying  helpless and speechless in the shadow of death, Louise Conly seemed  nearer and dearer than ever before to father, children, brothers and  sisters.    The ambulance stopped close to the veranda steps, and the same strong,  loving arms that had placed her in it now lifted her anew and bore her  into the house, the others looking on in awed and tearful silence.    She was carried to her own room, laid upon the bed, and one by one they  stood for an instant at her side with a kiss of welcome.    It was evident that she knew them all, though able to speak only with  those sad, wistful eyes that gazed with new yearning affection into the  faces of father and children.    But presently Arthur, by virtue of his medical authority, banished all  from the room except Lora, Elsie, and a faithful and attached old negress  who had lived all her days in the family and was a competent nurse.          CHAPTER VI.        \"Then come the wild weather--come sleet or come snow,       We will stand by each other, however it blow;       Oppression and sickness, and sorrow and pain,       Shall be to our true love as links to the chain.\"                     --_Longfellow_. (From the German.)      \"Courage, sister dear!\" whispered Edward Travilla, putting an arm tenderly  about Elsie's waist as they found themselves at the very door of Lester  Leland's studio.    Her face had grown very pale and she was trembling with agitation.    Still supporting her with his arm, Edward rapped gently upon the door, and  at the same instant it was opened from within by the attending physician,  who had just concluded his morning call upon his patient.    He was an Italian of gentlemanly appearance and intelligent countenance.    \"Some friends of Signor Leland: from America?\" he said in good English and  with a polite bow.    \"Yes. How is he?\" Edward asked, stepping in and drawing his sister on with  him.    \"Sick, signor, very sick, but he will grow better now. I shall expect to  see him up in a few weeks,\" the doctor answered with a significant glance  and smile as he turned, with a second and still lower bow, to the sweet,  fair maiden.    She did not see it, for her eyes were roving round the room--a disorderly  and comfortless place enough, but garnished with some gems of art; an  unfinished picture was on the easel; there were others with their faces to  the wall; models, statues in various stages of completion, and the  implements of painter and sculptor were scattered here and there; a  screen, an old lounge, a few chairs, and a table littered with books,  papers, and drawing materials, completed the furniture of the large,  dreary apartment.    An open door gave a glimpse into an inner room, from which came a slight  sound as of a restless movement, a sigh or groan.    Pointing to the chairs, the physician invited the strangers to be seated.    Edward put his sister in one and took possession of another close at her  side.    \"How soon can we see Mr. Leland?\" he asked, putting his card into the  doctor's hand.    \"I will go and prepare Signor Leland for the interview,\" the doctor  answered, and disappeared through the open doorway.    \"Good news for you, signor!\" they heard him say in a quiet tone.    \"Ah! let me hear it,\" sighed a well-known voice. \"'As cold water to a  thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.'\"    \"You are right, signor, it comes from far-off America. A friend--a young  signor has arrived, and asks to see you.\"    \"Ah! his name?\" exclaimed the sick man, with a tremor of gladness in his  feeble tones.    \"Here is his card.\"    \"'Edward Travilla!'--ah what joy! Let me see him at once. 'Twill be like a  breath of home air!\"    Every word had reached the ears of the two in the studio.    \"Go! go!\" cried Elsie, scarcely above her breath, and Edward rose and went  softly in.    \"Not much talk now, signores,\" Elsie heard the doctor say.    \"No; we'll be prudent,\" Edward said, grasping Lester's hand.    \"So good! so kind! more than I dared hope! But how is she? my darling?\"  Elsie heard in feeble, faltering, yet eager accents.    \"Well, very well, and longing to come here and nurse you back to health.\"    \"Ah, a glimpse of her sweet face I think would bring me back from the  borders of the grave! But I could not expect or ask such a sacrifice.\"    Elsie could wait no longer; she rose and glided with swift, almost  noiseless steps to the bedside.    Edward made way for her. Lester looked up, caught sight of her, and a  flash of exceeding joy lighted up his pale, emaciated features.    \"Elsie!\"    \"Lester!\"    She dropped on her knees, laid her face on the pillow beside his, and  their lips met in a long kiss.    \"O love, love! how sweet, how kind, how dear in you!\" he murmured.    \"I have come to be your nurse,\" she said, with a lovely blush and smile,  \"come to stay with you always while God spares our lives.\"    Soon Edward went out and left them together. He had much to attend to,  with Dinah and Ben for his helpers. Other and better apartments were  speedily rented, cleaned, and comfortably, even elegantly furnished. Their  mother had sent them off with full purses and carte blanche to draw upon  her bankers for further supplies as they might be needed; and Edward knew  it would be her desire to see Elsie and Lester surrounded by the luxuries  to which she had been accustomed from her birth.    When night came the doctor pronounced his patient already wonderfully  improved.    \"But the signora must leave him to me and the nurse to night,\" he said;  \"she is fatigued with her long journey and must take her rest and sleep,  or she too will be ill.\"    So Elsie took possession of the pleasant room which had been prepared for  her, and casting on the Lord all care for herself and dear ones, and full  of glad anticipations for the future, slept long and sweetly.    It was early morning when she woke. That day and several succeeding ones  were spent at Lester's side in the gentle ministrations love teaches.  There was little talk between them, for he was very weak, and love needs  few words; but he slept much of the time with her hand in his, and waking  gazed tenderly, joyously into the sweet face.    Happiness proved the best of medicines, and every hour brought a slight  increase of strength, a change for the better in all the symptoms.    Meanwhile Edward and the two servants were busy with the laying in of  needed supplies and the preparation of the suite of apartments which were  to form the new home--Elsie giving a little oversight and direction.    At length their labors were completed, and she was called in to take a  critical survey and point out any deficiency, if such there were.    She could find none. \"My dear brother, how can I thank you enough?\" she  said, with a look of grateful affection.    \"You are satisfied?\"    \"Oh, entirely! I only wish mamma and the rest could see how comfortable,  tasteful, really beautiful you have made these rooms!\"    \"I am very glad our work pleases you. And the doctor tells me that under  the combined influence of good nursing and unexpected happiness, Lester is  gaining faster than he could have deemed possible. What is the time fixed  upon for the ceremony which is to rob you of your patronymic, sister  mine?\"    \"Add to it, you should say,\" she corrected, with a charming blush. \"Noon  of day after to-morrow is the hour. Edward, do you know that our good  doctor is a Waldensian?\"    \"No, I did not, and am pleased to learn it; though I was satisfied that he  was no Papist.\"    \"Yes, he is one of that long-persecuted noble race, and will take you to  see his pastor on our behalf. I have so greatly admired and loved the  Waldenses that I really feel that to be married by one of their pastors  will be some small compensation for--for being so far from home  and--mamma. O Edward, if she were but here!\"    Her tears were falling fast. He put his arm about her waist, her head  dropped upon his shoulder and he smoothed her hair with caressing hand.    \"It is hard for you,\" he said tenderly; \"so different from what you and  all of us have looked forward to. But you have been very brave, dear; and  what a blessing that your coming is working such a cure for Lester!\""]]]
