In that favoured tract the nights are usually clear  and cool, so that it is very pleasant to sleep outside beneath the  starry canopy of the heavens.    It requires an optimist to say good things of April days, even in the  sub-Himalayan tract. Fierce scorching west winds sweep over the earth,  covering everything with dust. Sometimes the flying sand is so thick  as to obscure the landscape, and often, after the wind has dropped,  the particles remain suspended for days as a dust haze. The dust is a  scourge. It is all-pervading. It enters eyes, ears, nose and mouth. To  escape it is impossible. Closed doors and windows fail to keep it from  entering the bungalow. The only creatures which appear to be  indifferent to it are the fowls of the air. As to the heat, the  non-migratory species positively revel in it. The crows and a few  other birds certainly do gasp and pant when the sun is at its height,  but even they, save for a short siesta at midday, are as active in  April and May as schoolboys set free from a class-room. April is the  month in which the spring crops are harvested. As soon as the _Holi_  festival is over the cultivators issue forth in thousands, armed with  sickles, and begin to reap. They are almost as active as the birds,  but their activity is forced and not spontaneous; like most  Anglo-Indian officials they literally earn their bread by the sweat of  the brow. Thanks to their unceasing labours the countryside becomes  transformed during the month; that which was a sea of smiling  golden-brown wheat and barley becomes a waste of short stubble.    Nature gives some compensation for the heat and the dust in the shape  of mulberries, loquats, lichis and cool luscious papitas and melons  which ripen in March or April. The mango blossom becomes transfigured  into fruit, which, by the end of the month, is as large as an egg, and  will be ready for gathering in the latter half of May.    Many trees are in flower. The coral, the silk-cotton and the _dhak_  are resplendent with red foliage. The _jhaman_, the _siris_ and the  _mohwa_ are likewise in bloom and, ere the close of the month, the  _amaltas_ or Indian laburnum will put forth its bright yellow flowers  in great profusion. Throughout April the air is heavy with the scent  of blossoms. The _shesham_, the _sal_, the _pipal_ and the _nim_ are  vivid with fresh foliage. But notwithstanding all this galaxy of  colour, notwithstanding the brightness of the sun and the blueness of  the sky, the countryside lacks the sweetness that Englishmen associate  with springtime, because the majority of the trees, being evergreen,  do not renew their clothing completely at this season, and the foliage  is everywhere more or less obscured by the all-pervading dust.    The great avian emigration, which began in March, now reaches its  height. During the warm April nights millions of birds leave the  plains of India. The few geese remaining at the close of March, depart  in the first days of April.    The brahminy ducks, which during the winter months were scattered in  twos and threes over the lakes and rivers of Northern India, collect  into flocks that migrate, one by one, to cooler climes, so that, by  the end of the first week in May, the _a-onk_ of these birds is no  longer heard. The mallard, gadwall, widgeon, pintail, the various  species of pochard and the common teal are rapidly disappearing. With  April duck-shooting ends. Of the migratory species only a few  shovellers and garganey teal tarry till May.    The snipe and the quail are likewise flighting towards their breeding  grounds. Thus on the 1st of May the avian population of India is less  by many millions than it was at the beginning of April. But the birds  that remain behind more than compensate us, by their great activity,  for the loss of those that have departed. There is more to interest  the ornithologist in April than there was in January.    The bird chorus is now at its best. The magpie-robin is in full song.  At earliest dawn he takes up a position on the topmost bough of a tree  and pours forth his melody in a continuous stream. His varied notes  are bright and joyous. Its voice is of wide compass and very powerful;  were it a little softer in tone it would rival that of the  nightingale. The magpie-robin is comparatively silent at noonday, but  from sunset until dusk he sings continuously.    Throughout April the little cock sunbirds deliver themselves of their  vigorous canary-like song. The bulbuls tinkle as blithely as ever.  Ioras, pied wagtails, pied chats, and wood-shrikes continue to  contribute their not unworthy items to the minstrelsy of the Indian  countryside. The robins, having by now found their true notes, are  singing sweetly and softly. The white-eyes are no longer content to  utter their usual cheeping call, the cocks give vent to an exquisite  warble and thereby proclaim the advent of the nesting season. The  _towee_, _towee_, _towee_, of the tailor-bird, more penetrating than  melodious, grows daily more vigorous, reminding us that we may now  hopefully search for his nest. Among the less pleasing sounds that  fill the welkin are the _tonk_, _tonk_, _tonk_ of the coppersmith, the  _kutur_, _kutur_, _kuturuk_ of the green barbet, and the calls of the  various cuckoos that summer in the plains of Northern India. The calls  of these cuckoos, although frequently heard in April, are uttered more  continuously in May, accordingly they are described in the calendar  for that month.    The owls, of course, lift up their voices, particularly on moonlight  nights. The nightjars are as vociferous as they were in March; their  breeding season is now at its height.    In the hills the woods resound with the cheerful double note of the  European cuckoo (_Cuculus canorus_). This bird is occasionally heard  in the plains of the Punjab in April, and again from July to  September, when it no longer calls in the Himalayas. This fact,  coupled with the records of the presence of the European cuckoo in  Central India in June and July, lends support to the theory that the  birds which enliven the Himalayas in spring go south in July and  winter in the Central Provinces. Cuckoos, at seasons when they are  silent, are apt to be overlooked, or mistaken for shikras.    Ornithologists stationed in Central India will render a service to  science if they keep a sharp look-out for European cuckoos and record  the results of their observations. In this way alone can the above  theory be proved or disproved.    By the middle of the month most of the rollers have settled down to  domestic duties, and in consequence are less noisy than they were when  courting. Their irritating grating cries are now largely replaced by  harsh _tshocks_ of delight, each _tshock_ being accompanied by a  decisive movement of the tail. The cause of these interjections  expressing delight is a clutch of white eggs or a brood of young  birds, hidden in a hole in a tree or a building.    April is a month in which the pulse of bird life beats very vigorously  in India. He who, braving the heat, watches closely the doings of the  feathered folk will be rewarded by the discovery of at least thirty  different kinds of nests. Hence, it is evident that the calendar for  this month, unless it is to attain very large dimensions, must be a  mere catalogue of nesting species. The compiler of the calendar has to  face an _embarrass de richesses_.    Of the common species that build in March and the previous months the  following are likely to be found with eggs or young--the jungle crows,  sunbirds, doves, pied and golden-backed woodpeckers, coppersmiths,  hoopoes, common and brahminy kites, bulbuls, shrikes, little minivets,  fantail flycatchers, wire-tailed swallows, paroquets, spotted owlets,  swifts, scavenger vultures, red-headed merlins, skylarks, crested  larks, pipits, babblers, sand-martins, cliff-swallows, nuthatches,  white-eyed buzzards, kites, black vultures, pied and white-breasted  kingfishers, finch-larks, Indian wren-warblers, wood-shrikes,  cuckoo-shrikes, green barbets, tawny eagles, and the terns and the  other birds that nest on islets in rivers. Here and there may be seen  a white-backed vulture's nest containing a young bird nearly ready to  fly.    Towards the middle of the month the long-tailed tree-pies  (_Dendrocitta rufa_), which are nothing else than coloured crows,  begin nest-building. They are to be numbered among the commonest birds  in India, nevertheless their large open nests are rarely seen. The  explanation of this phenomenon appears to be the fact that the nest is  well concealed high up in a tree. Moreover, the pie, possessing a  powerful beak which commands respect, is not obliged constantly to  defend its home after the manner of small or excitable birds, and thus  attract attention to it.    Fortunately for the tree-pie the kites and crows do not worry it. The  shikra (_Astur badius_) and the white-eyed buzzard (_Butastur teesa_),  which are now engaged in nest-building, are not so fortunate. The  crows regard them as fair game, hence their nest-building season is a  time of _sturm und drang_. They, in common with all diurnal birds of  prey, build untidy nests in trees--mere conglomerations of sticks,  devoid of any kind of architectural merit. The blue rock-pigeons  (_Columba intermedia_) are busily prospecting for nesting sites. In  some parts of India, especially in the Muttra and Fatehgarh districts,  these birds nest chiefly in holes in wells. More often than not a  stone thrown into a well in such a locality causes at least one pigeon  to fly out of the well. In other places in India these birds build by  preference on a ledge or a cornice inside some large building. They  often breed in colonies. At Dig in Rajputana, where they are sacred in  the eyes of Hindus, thousands of them nest in the fort, and, as Hume  remarks, a gun fired"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1825"],[0,"The Adventures of Reddy Fox (#8)"],[1,"him a shove. \"You go along and do as I say!\" she  snapped. \"If you had minded me, we wouldn't have to move. It's all your  own fault. The wonder is that you weren't killed when you poked your  head out right in front of Farmer Brown's boy. Now that he knows where  we live, he will give us no peace. Move along lively now! This is the  best home I have ever had, and now I've got to leave it. Oh dear! Oh  dear!\"    Reddy Fox hobbled along up the long hall and out the front door. He was  walking on three legs, and at every step he made a face because, you  know, it hurt so to walk.    The little stars, looking down from the sky, saw Reddy Fox limp out the  door of the house he had lived in so long, and right behind him came old  Granny Fox. Granny sighed and wiped away a tear, as she said good-by  to her old home. Reddy Fox was thinking too much of his own troubles to  notice how badly Granny Fox was feeling. Every few steps he had to sit  down and rest because it hurt him so to walk.    \"I don't see the use of moving tonight, anyway. It would be a lot easier  and pleasanter when the sun is shining. This night air makes me so stiff  that I know I never will get over it,\" grumbled Reddy Fox.    Old Granny Fox listened to him for a while, and then she lost patience.  Yes, Sir, Granny Fox lost patience. She boxed Reddy Fox first on one ear  and then on the other. Reddy began to snivel.    \"Stop that!\" said Granny Fox sharply. \"Do you want all the neighbors to  know that we have got to move? They'll find it out soon enough. Now come  along without any more fuss. If you don't, I'll just go off and leave  you to shift for yourself. Then how will you get anything to eat?\"    Reddy Fox wiped his eyes on his coat sleeve and hobbled along as best he  could. Granny Fox would run a little way ahead to see that the way was  safe and then come back for Reddy. Poor Reddy. He did his best not  to complain, but it was such hard work. And somehow Reddy Fox didn't  believe that it was at all necessary. He had been terribly frightened  when he had disobeyed Granny Fox that afternoon and put his head out the  door, only to look right into the freckled face of Farmer Brown's boy.  He had ducked back out of sight again too quickly for Farmer Brown's boy  to shoot, and now he couldn't see why old Granny Fox wanted to move that  very night.    \"She's getting old. She's getting old and timid and fussy,\" muttered  Reddy Fox, as he hobbled along behind her.    It seemed to Reddy as if they had walked miles and miles. He really  thought that they had been walking nearly all night when old Granny Fox  stopped in front of the worst-looking old fox house Reddy had ever seen.    \"Here we are!\" said she.    \"What! Are we going to live in that thing?\" cried Reddy. \"It isn't fit  for any respectable fox to put his nose into.\"    \"It is where I was born!\" snapped old Granny Fox. \"If you want to keep  out of harm's way, don't go to putting on airs now.          \"Who scorns the simple things of life          And tilts his nose at all he sees,        Is almost sure to feel the knife          Of want cut through his pleasant ease.    \"Now don't let me hear another word from you, but get inside at once!\"    Reddy Fox didn't quite understand all Granny Fox said, but he knew when  she was to be obeyed, and so he crawled gingerly through the broken-down  doorway.          XXV. Peter Rabbit Makes a Discovery    Hardly had jolly, round, red Mr. Sun thrown off his nightcap and come  out from his home behind the Purple Hills for his daily climb up in the  blue, blue sky, when Farmer Brown's boy started down the Lone Little  Path through the Green Forest.    Peter Rabbit, who had been out all night and was just then on his way  home, saw him. Peter stopped and sat up to rub his eyes and look again.  He wasn't quite sure that he had seen aright the first time. But he  had. There was Farmer Brown's boy, sure enough, and at his heels trotted  Bowser the Hound.    Peter Rabbit rubbed his eyes once more and wrinkled up his eyebrows.  Farmer Brown's boy certainly had a gun over one shoulder and a spade  over the other. Where could he be going down the Lone Little Path with a  spade? Farmer Brown's garden certainly was not in that direction. Peter  watched him out of sight and then he hurried down to the Green Meadows  to tell Johnny Chuck what he had seen. My, how Peter's long legs did  fly! He was so excited that he had forgotten how sleepy he had felt a  few minutes before.    Halfway down to Johnny Chuck's house, Peter Rabbit almost ran plump into  Bobby Coon and Jimmy Skunk, who had been quarreling and were calling  each other names. They stopped when they saw Peter Rabbit.          \"Peter Rabbit runs away          From his shadder, so they say.        Peter, Peter, what a sight!          Tell us why this sudden fright,\"    shouted Bobby Coon.    Peter Rabbit stopped short. Indeed, he stopped so short that he almost  turned a somersault. \"Say,\" he panted, \"I've just seen Farmer Brown's  boy.\"    \"You don't say so!\" said Jimmy Skunk, pretending to be very much  surprised. \"You don't say so! Why, now I think of it, I believe I've  seen Farmer Brown's boy a few times myself.\"    Peter Rabbit made a good-natured face at Jimmy Skunk, and then he told  all about how he had seen Farmer Brown's boy with gun and spade and  Bowser the Hound going down the Lone Little Path. \"You know there isn't  any garden down that way,\" he concluded.    Bobby Coon's face wore a sober look. Yes, Sir, all the fun was gone from  Bobby Coon's face.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Jimmy Skunk.    \"I was just thinking that Reddy Fox lives over in that direction and he  is so stiff that he cannot run,\" replied Bobby Coon.    Jimmy Skunk hitched up his trousers and started toward the Lone Little  Path. \"Come on!\" said he. \"Let's follow him and see what he is about.\"    Bobby Coon followed at once, but Peter Rabbit said he would hurry over  and get Johnny Chuck and then join the others.    All this time Farmer Brown's boy had been hurrying down the Lone Little  Path to the home old Granny Fox and Reddy Fox had moved out of the night  before. Of course, he didn't know that they had moved. He put down his  gun, and by the time Jimmy Skunk and Bobby Coon and Peter Rabbit and  Johnny Chuck reached a place where they could peep out and see what was  going on, he had dug a great hole.    \"Oh!\" cried Peter Rabbit, \"he's digging into the house of Reddy Fox, and  he'll catch poor Reddy!\"          XXVI. Farmer Brown's Boy Works for Nothing    The grass around the doorstep of the house where Reddy Fox had always  lived was all wet with dew when Farmer Brown's boy laid his gun down,  took off his coat, rolled up his shirt sleeves, and picked up his spade.  It was cool and beautiful there on the edge of the Green Meadows. Jolly,  round, red Mr. Sun had just begun his long climb up in the blue, blue  sky. Mr. Redwing was singing for joy over in the bulrushes on the edge  of the Smiling Pool. Yes, it was very beautiful, very beautiful indeed.  It didn't seem as if harm could come to anyone on such a beautiful  morning.    But there was Farmer Brown's boy. He had crawled on his hands and knees  without making a sound to get near enough to the home of Reddy Fox to  shoot if Reddy was outside. But there was no sign of Reddy, so Farmer  Brown's boy had hopped up, and now he was whistling as he began to dig.  His freckled face looked good-natured. It didn't seem as if he could  mean harm to anyone.    But there lay the gun, and he was working as if he meant to get to the  very bottom of Reddy Fox's home!    Deeper and deeper grew the hole, and bigger and bigger grew the pile of  sand which he threw out. He didn't know that anyone was watching him,  except Bowser the Hound. He didn't see Johnny Chuck peeping from behind  a tall bunch of meadow grass, or Peter Rabbit peeping from behind a  tree on the edge of the Green Forest, or Bobby Coon looking from a safe  hiding place in the top of that same tree. He didn't see Jimmy Skunk or  Unc' Billy Possum or Happy Jack Squirrel or Digger the Badger. He didn't  see one of them, but they saw him. They saw every shovelful of sand that  he threw, and their hearts went pit-a-pat as they watched, for each one  felt sure that something dreadful was going to happen to Reddy Fox.    Only Ol' Mistah Buzzard knew better. From way up high in the blue, blue  sky he could look down and see many things. He could see all the little  meadow and forest people who were watching Farmer Brown's boy. The  harder Farmer Brown's boy worked, the more Ol' Mistah Buzzard chuckled  to himself. What was he laughing at? Why, he could see the sharp face of  old Granny Fox, peeping out from behind an old fence corner, and she was  grinning. So Ol' Mistah Buzzard knew Reddy Fox was safe.    But the other little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows  didn't know that old Granny Fox and Reddy Fox had moved, and their faces  grew longer and longer as they watched Farmer Brown's boy go deeper and  deeper into the ground.    \"Reddy Fox has worried me almost to death and would eat me if he could  catch me, but somehow things wouldn't be quite the same without him  around. Oh dear, I don't want him killed,\" moaned Peter Rabbit.    \"Perhaps he isn't home,\" said Jimmy Skunk.    \"Of course he's home; he's so stiff and sore he can hardly walk at all  and has to stay home,\" replied Johnny Chuck. \"Hello, what's the matter  now?\"    Everybody looked. Farmer Brown's boy had climbed out of the hole. He  looked tired and cross. He rested for a few minutes, and as he rested,  he scowled. Then he began to shovel the sand back into the hole. He had  reached the bottom and found no one there.    \"Hurrah!\" shouted Peter Rabbit and struck his heels together as he  jumped up in the air.    And the others were just as glad as Peter Rabbit. Johnny Chuck was  especially glad, for, you see, Farmer Brown's boy had once"]]]
