To get across such a place one had to walk  round, and jump over, and duck under perpetually. Some of the roots had  formed themselves very conveniently into low seats and narrow, uneven  tables, and at the bottom all the roots ran into the floor and away  again in the direction required by their business. After the clear air  outside this place was very dark to the children's eyes, so that they  could not see anything for a few minutes, but after a little time their  eyes became accustomed to the semiobscurity and they were able to see  quite well. The first things they became aware of were six small men who  were seated on low roots. They were all dressed in tight green clothes  and little leathern aprons, and they wore tall green hats which wobbled  when they moved. They were all busily engaged making shoes. One was  drawing out wax ends on his knee, another was softening pieces of  leather in a bucket of water, another was polishing the instep of a shoe  with a piece of curved bone, another was paring down a heel with a short  broad-bladed knife, and another was hammering wooden pegs into a sole.  He had all the pegs in his mouth, which gave him a widefaced, jolly  expression, and according as a peg was wanted he blew it into his hand  and hit it twice with his hammer, and then he blew another peg, and he  always blew the peg with the right end uppermost, and never had to hit  it more than twice. He was a person well worth watching.    The children had slid down so unexpectedly that they almost forgot their  good manners, but as soon as Seumas Beg discovered that he was really in  a room he removed his cap and stood up.    \"God be with all here,\" said he.    The Leprecaun who had brought them lifted Brigid from the floor to which  amazement still constrained her.    \"Sit down on that little root, child of my heart,\" said he, \"and you can  knit stockings for us.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Brigid meekly.    The Leprecaun took four knitting needles and a ball of green wool from  the top of a high, horizontal root. He had to climb over one, go round  three and climb up two roots to get at it, and he did this so easily  that it did not seem a bit of trouble. He gave the needles and wool to  Brigid Beg.    \"Do you know how to turn the heel, Brigid Beg?\" said he.    \"No, sir,\" said Brigid.    \"Well, I'll show you how when you come to it.\"    The other six Leprecauns had ceased work and were looking at the  children. Seumas turned to them.    \"God bless the work,\" said he politely.    One of the Leprecauns, who had a grey, puckered face and a thin fringe  of grey whisker very far under his chin, then spoke.    \"Come over here, Seumas Beg,\" said he, \"and I'll measure you for a pair  of shoes. Put your foot up on that root.\"    The boy did so, and the Leprecaun took the measure of his foot with a  wooden rule.    \"Now, Brigid Beg, show me your foot,\" and he measured her also. \"They'll  be ready for you in the morning.\"    \"Do you never do anything else but make shoes, sir?\" said Seumas.    \"We do not,\" replied the Leprecaun, \"except when we want new clothes,  and then we have to make them, but we grudge every minute spent making  anything else except shoes, because that is the proper work for a  Leprecaun. In the night time we go about the country into people's  houses and we clip little pieces off their money, and so, bit by bit,  we get a crock of gold together, because, do you see, a Leprecaun has to  have a crock of gold so that if he's captured by men folk he may be  able to ransom himself. But that seldom happens, because it's a great  disgrace altogether to be captured by a man, and we've practiced so long  dodging among the roots here that we can easily get away from them. Of  course, now and again we are caught; but men are fools, and we always  escape without having to pay the ransom at all. We wear green clothes  because it's the colour of the grass and the leaves, and when we sit  down under a bush or lie in the grass they just walk by without noticing  us.\"    \"Will you let me see your crock of gold?\" said Seumas.    The Leprecaun looked at him fixedly for a moment.    \"Do you like griddle bread and milk?\" said he.    \"I like it well,\" Seumas answered.    \"Then you had better have some,\" and the Leprecaun took a piece of  griddle bread from the shelf and filled two saucers with milk.    While the children were eating the Leprecauns asked them many questions  \"What time do you get up in the morning?\"    \"Seven o'clock,\" replied Seumas.    \"And what do you have for breakfast?\"    \"Stirabout and milk,\" he replied.    \"It's good food,\" said the Leprecaun. \"What do you have for dinner?\"    \"Potatoes and milk,\" said Seumas.    \"It's not bad at all,\" said the Leprecaun. \"And what do you have for  supper?\"    Brigid answered this time because her brother's mouth was full.    \"Bread and milk, sir,\" said she.    \"There's nothing better,\" said the Leprecaun.    \"And then we go to bed,\" continued Brigid.    \"Why wouldn't you?\" said the Leprecaun.    It was at this point the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath knocked on the tree  trunk and demanded that the children should be returned to her.    When she had gone away the Leprecauns held a consultation, whereat it  was decided that they could not afford to anger the Thin Woman and the  Shee of Croghan Conghaile, so they shook hands with the children and  bade them good-bye. The Leprecaun who had enticed them away from home  brought them back again, and on parting he begged the children to visit  Gort na Cloca Mora whenever they felt inclined.    \"There's always a bit of griddle bread or potato cake, and a noggin of  milk for a friend,\" said he.    \"You are very kind, sir,\" replied Seumas, and his sister said the same  words.    As the Leprecaun walked away they stood watching him.    \"Do you remember,\" said Seumas, \"the way he hopped and waggled his leg  the last time he was here?\"    \"I do so,\" replied Brigid.    \"Well, he isn't hopping or doing anything at all this time,\" said  Seumas.    \"He's not in good humour to-night,\" said Brigid, \"but I like him.\"    \"So do I,\" said Seumas.    When they went into the house the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath was very  glad to see them, and she baked a cake with currants in it, and also  gave them both stir-about and potatoes; but the Philosopher did not  notice that they had been away at all. He said at last that \"talking was  bad wit, that women were always making a fuss, that children should be  fed, but not fattened, and that beds were meant to be slept in.\" The Thin  Woman replied \"that he was a grisly old man without bowels, that she did  not know what she had married him for, that he was three times her age,  and that no one would believe what she had to put up with.\"        CHAPTER IX    PURSUANT to his arrangement with Meehawl MacMurrachu, the Philosopher  sent the children in search of Pan. He gave them the fullest  instructions as to how they should address the Sylvan Deity, and then,  having received the admonishments of the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath, the  children departed in the early morning.    When they reached the clearing in the pine wood, through which the sun  was blazing, they sat down for a little while to rest in the heat. Birds  were continually darting down this leafy shaft, and diving away into the  dark wood. These birds always had something in their beaks. One would  have a worm, or a snail, or a grasshopper, or a little piece of wool  torn off a sheep, or a scrap of cloth, or a piece of hay; and when they  had put these things in a certain place they flew up the sun-shaft again  and looked for something else to bring home. On seeing the children each  of the birds waggled his wings, and made a particular sound. They said  \"caw\" and \"chip\" and \"twit\" and \"tut\" and \"what\" and \"pit\"; and one,  whom the youngsters liked very much, always said \"tit-tittit-tit-tit.\"  The children were fond of him because he was so all-of-asudden. They  never knew where he was going to fly next, and they did not believe he  knew himself. He would fly backwards and forwards, and up and down, and  sideways and bawways--all, so to speak, in the one breath. He did this  because he was curious to see what was happening everywhere, and, as  something is always happening everywhere, he was never able to fly in  a straight line for more than the littlest distance. He was a cowardly  bird too, and continually fancied that some person was going to throw  a stone at him from behind a bush, or a wall, or a tree, and these  imaginary dangers tended to make his journeyings still more wayward and  erratic. He never flew where he wanted to go himself, but only where God  directed him, and so he did not fare at all badly.    The children knew each of the birds by their sounds, and always said  these words to them when they came near. For a little time they had  difficulty in saying the right word to the right bird, and sometimes  said \"chip\" when the salutation should have been \"tut.\" The birds always  resented this, and would scold them angrily, but after a little practice  they never made any mistakes at all. There was one bird, a big, black  fellow, who loved to be talked to. He used to sit on the ground beside  the children, and say \"caw\" as long as they would repeat it after him.  He often wasted a whole morning in talk, but none of the other birds  remained for more than a few minutes at a time. They were always busy  in the morning, but in the evening they had more leisure, and would stay  and chat as long as the children wanted them. The awkward thing was that  in the evening all the birds wanted to talk at the same moment, so that  the youngsters never knew which of them to answer. Seumas Beg got out  of that difficulty for a while by learning to whistle their notes, but,  even so, they spoke with such rapidity that he could not by any means  keep pace with them. Brigid could only whistle one note; it was a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16059"],[0,"Modern Spanish Lyrics (#8)"],[1," gave the following results (cf. _Romanic  Review, Vol. III_, pp. 301-308):    Common syllabic arrangements of 8-syllable lines:    (1) / _ / _ / _ / (_): Esta triste voz oi.    (2) _ / _ / _ _ / (_): Llorando dicen asi.    (3) _ / _ _ / _ / (_): Mi cama las duras penas.    Of 933 lines, 446 (nearly one-half) were in class (1); 257  in class (2); and 191 in class (3). The remaining lines  did not belong to any one of these three classes.    Common syllabic arrangements of 11-syllable lines:    (1) _ / _ / _ / _ / _ / (_): Veras con cuanto amor llamar  porfia.    (2) / _ / _ _ / _ / _ / (_): Cuantas veces el angel me  decia.    (3) / _ _ / _ / _ / _ / (_): Este matiz que al cielo  desafia.    Of 402 lines, 216 (slightly more than one-half) were in  class (1); 94 were in class (2); and 75 in class (3). The  remaining lines did not belong to any one of these  three classes. Note that, in these arrangements of the  11-syllable lines, the irregularities in rhythm are found  only in the first four syllables.]                                                                page xlvi  Some poets have used at times a quite regular binary  movement in Spanish verse; but they have had few or no  followers, as the effect was too monotonous to please the  Spanish ear. Thus, Solis:      Siempre orillas de la fuente    Busco rosas a mi frente,    Pienso en el y me sonrio,    Y entre mi le llamo mio,    Me entristezco de su ausencia,    Y deseo en su presencia    La mas bella parecer.          (p. 53, ll. 6-12)    The Colombian poet, Jose Eusebio Caro, wrote much verse  thus, under the influence of the English poets.    On the other hand, some recent \"decadent\" poets have  written verses in which the principle of symmetry of  phrases, or of a fixed number of syllables, is abandoned,  and rhythm and rime are considered sufficient to make the  lines musical. Thus, Leopoldo Lugones (born 1875?), of  Argentina, in verses which he calls \"_libres_\" (cf.  _Lunario sentimental_, Buenos Aires, 1909):      Luna, quiero cantarte    iOh ilustre anciana de las mitologias!    Con todas las fuerzas de mi arte.      Deidad que en los antiguos dias    Imprimiste en nuestro polvo tu sandalia,    No alabare el liturgico furor de tus orgias    Ni su erotica didascalia,    Para que alumbres sin mayores ironias,    Al poligloto elogio de las Guias,    Noches sentimentales de _mises_ en Italia.              (_Himno a la luna_)    This is largely a harking back to primitive conditions,  for in the oldest Castilian narrative verse the rule of  \"counted syllables\" apparently did not prevail. Cf. the  _Cantar de mio Cid_, where there is great irregularity in  the number of syllables. And, although in the                page xlvii  old _romances_ the half-lines of eight syllables largely  predominate, many are found with seven or nine syllables,  and some with even fewer or more. The adoption of the rule  of \"counted syllables\" in Spanish may have been due to one  or more of several causes: to the influence of medieval  Latin rhythmic songs;[10] to French influence; or merely  to the development in the Spanish people of a feeling for  artistic symmetry.    [Footnote 10: Such as:      Stabat Mater dolorosa    Juxta crucem lachrymosa    Dum pendebat filius.]    Other poets of to-day write verses in which the line  contains a fixed number of syllables or any multiple of  that number. Thus, Julio Sesto (_Blanco y Negro_, Nov. 5,  1911):      iComo desembarcan..., como desembarcan    esas pobres gentes...!    Desde la escalera de la nave todo Nueva York abarcan    de un vistazo: muelles, rio, casas, puentes...    Y despues que todos sus cinco sentidos    ponen asombrados en ver la ciudad,    como agradecidos,    miran a la estatua de la Libertad.    iElla es la Madona, ella es la Madona,    que de la Siberia saca a los esclavos,    que a los regicidas la vida perdona,    y que salva a muchos de contribuyentes, pobres, perseguidos,    subditos y esclavos!...    (_La tierra prometida_)    Spanish poets have often tried to write verses in  classical meters with the substitution of stress for  quantity. Thus, Villegas in the following hexameters:      Seis veces el verde soto corono su cabeza    de nardo, de amarillo trebol, de morada vioela,    en tanto que el pecho frio de mi casta Licoris    al rayo del ruego mio deshizo su hielo.[11]    [Footnote 11: Apparently _trebol_ instead of _trebol_.  These lines are quoted by Eugenio Mele, in _La poesia  barbara in Ispagna_, Bari, 1910.]                                                              page xlviii  Jose Eusebio Caro wrote similar hexameters, and, strange  to say, made alternate lines assonate:        iCefiro rapido lanzate! irapido empujame y vivo!    iMas redondas mis velas pon: del proscrito a los lados,    haz que tus silbos susurren dulces y dulces suspiren!      iHaz que pronto del patrio suelo se aleje mi barco!        (_En alta mar_)    The number of these direct imitations is large; but few  succeeded. They are, at best, foreign to the spirit of  Castilian poetry.    In singing Spanish verses two facts are of especial  interest: that, where the rules of prosody require  synalepha, hiatus sometimes occurs (especially in opera),  thus:      Recogete--ese panuelo.    (Olmedo, _Folk-lore de Castilla_, p. 133)      Y el pajaro--era verde.    (Ledesma, _Cancionero salmantino_, p. 53)    And that musical accents do not necessarily coincide with  syllabic stresses, even at the end of a phrase. Thus,      iCuantas veces, vida mia,    Te asomaras al balcon![12]      iCuerpo bueno, alma divina,    Que de fatigas me cuestas!      iBendiga Dios ese cuerpo,    Tan llenisimo de gracia!    (Hernandez, _Flores de Espana_)    [Footnote 12: The grave accent mark (`) indicates a strong  musical accent.]                                                                page xlix    SYLLABICATION    In most modern Spanish verse there is a fixed number of  syllables in a line up to and including the last stressed  syllable.[13] In counting these syllables consideration  must be given to the following facts:    [Footnote 13: The number of unstressed syllables at the end  of a line is not fixed. See p. lvi.    In order to have the correct number of syllables, poets  sometimes (1) shorten a word or (2) shift the accent:      (1) ?Ya que mi puro _espirtu_ sucias carnes...          (Cabanyes, _A Cintio_)      (2) Puede querer...? _Abrale_...          (Zorrilla, _Don Juan Tenorio_, primeraa parte, III, 6)        Deben de ser _angeles_.          (Lope de Vega, _El mejor alcalde el rey_, II)    Note the artificial separation of lines in some dramatic  _romance_-verse:          ... Soy un cate-    Cumeno muy diligente.    (Calderon, _El Jose de las mujeres_, II)      De una vil hermana, de un    Falso amigo, de un infame    Criado...    (Calderon, _No hay burlas con el amor_, III)]      (1) SYNERESIS    Within a word two or three contiguous vowels usually  combine to form a diphthong or a triphthong respectively  (this is called \"syneresis\"): _bai|le, rey, oi|go,  ciu|dad, cui|da|do, es|tu|diar, es|tu|diais, dien|te,  lim|pio, gra|cio|so, muy, bien, pue|de, buey_, etc.  Exceptions:    (_a_) A stressed \"weak\" vowel (_i, u_) may not combine  with a \"strong\" vowel (_a, e, o_) to form a diphthong:  _di|a_,_ri|e, fri|o, ra|iz, le|i|do, o|i|do,                     page l  con|ti|nu|a, con|ti|nu|e, con|ti|nu|o, ba|ul, sa|bi|a,  sa|bri|ais, ca|i|ais,_ etc.[14]    [Footnote 14: Note that in these combinations the weak  vowel receives the accent mark. Some Spanish-American  poets have sinned grievously, by reason of their local  pronunciation, in diphthongizing a strong vowel with a  following stressed weak vowel, as _maiz, a|taud, oi|do_,  for _ma|iz, a|ta|ud, o|i|do_, respectively, etc.]    Exceptions are rare:      Su|pe | que | se|ria | di|cho|so |    (Calderon, _No hay burlas con el amor_, III)    Cf. also _rendios_, etc., where the _o_ of _os_ combines  with the _i_ by synalepha.    (_b_) _ua, uo_, are usually disyllabic, except after _c,  g_, and _j: a|due|a|na, sue|a|ve;_ but _cua|tro, san|ti|guo,  Juan_, etc. Syneresis may occur: _sua|ve_.    (_c_) _ui_ is usually disyllabic, except in _muy:  flu|i|do_.    (_d_) Two unstressed strong vowels, if they follow the  stress, regularly form a diphthong; but if they precede  they may form a diphthong or they may be dissyllabic,  usually at the option of the poet.
