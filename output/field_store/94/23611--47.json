During those days but little out of the ordinary happened. Dick took  especial care to avoid Lew Flapp, and the tall youth did not attempt to  bother him. It was soon learned that Flapp was more of a braggart than  anything else, and then even some of the smaller boys grew less afraid  of him.    As already told, it had been decided by Captain Putnam to have the  cadets elect a new set of officers for the term, and these officers  were to be chosen in a somewhat different manner than heretofore.    \"In the past,\" said the captain, when addressing the students on the  subject, \"you have been permitted to elect whoever you pleased to any  office, from major down. This has occasionally resulted in someone  being chosen who, while he might be a good scholar and a good fellow  generally, was not exactly fitted to a military position. On that  account I have made a change. Next Wednesday and Thursday I shall hold  a general examination in military matters only, and the twenty pupils  standing highest shall be the ones eligible for the positions of major,  captain, and first and second lieutenants. On these twenty names you  shall vote as heretofore. As we now have three companies here we shall  want a major, three captains, and six lieutenants, making a total of  ten officers. After that each company shall choose its own corporals  and sergeants. The company marching best on parade the following  Saturday shall have the honor of carrying the flag until after the  annual encampment, which this year will begin a month from to-day.\"    At the mention of the annual encampment the cadets set up a cheer. The  outing was looked forward to with great interest.    \"Where are we going this year?\" asked George Granbury.    \"It's a secret, I believe,\" answered Larry Colby. \"But I am pretty  certain that we are going further away than usual.\"    \"I hope we go into the mountains.\"    \"Or along some other lake, where the fishing is fine,\" put in Tom.    \"Yes, that would suit me, too.\"    The announcement concerning the examination in military matters also  caused much talk, and many of the cadets began at once to study  military tactics harder than ever, while drills became a pleasure  instead of a hardship.    \"I'm going to win some kind of a place,\" said Larry earnestly. \"Even a  lieutenantship would be better than nothing.\"    \"I am sure I am going to win,\" put in William Philander Tubbs. \"I am  perfect in every kind of a drill.\"    \"Good for Buttertub, the perfect man!\" sang out Tom. \"Billy, you ought  to have your picture done in oil, to hang alongside of Washington's, in  the library.\"    \"Don't you dare to call me Buttertub, or Billy either, you rude thing!\"  snorted Tubbs, and walked away in outraged dignity.    \"Dot examinations vos dickle me alretty,\" said Hans. \"Vot I don't know  apoud dem military tictacs you don't know, ain't it. I vill pe by der  top of der class so kvick as neffer vos, you pet yourself!\" And he  nodded his head as if he meant every word of it.    Dick Rover said but little on the subject, but he meant to win if he  possibly could, and so did Tom. Sam felt he was as yet too young to  become anything but a sergeant, so he did not enter the competition  with much vigor.    Lew Flapp was not a particularly bright pupil, but there was one thing,  outside of bag punching, that he could do well, and that was to drill.  He took to military tactics naturally, and knew nearly every rule that  the book of instructions contained.    \"It's going to be an easy matter to get into the chosen twenty,\" the  tall boy told himself. \"But after that, will the cadets elect me to one  of those positions?\"  He wanted to be major of the battalion, but  doubted if he could muster up sufficient friends to elect him.    The examination in military matters came off on the afternoon of the  following Wednesday and on Thursday morning. Captain Putnam was very  thorough in the work, and made the pupils do certain things over and  over again, and write the answers to long lists of questions.    \"It has given me great pleasure to conduct this examination,\" he said,  on the day following. \"It shows that the average in military knowledge  is much higher than it was last term. The following are the pupils who  have passed, given in the order of merit.\" And then he read the list of  names. Lew Flapp came first, Dick Rover next, Larry Colby third, George  Granbury fourth, and the others, including Tom and Fred Garrison,  followed. Neither William Philander Tubbs nor Hans Mueller were  mentioned.    \"I dink me dere vos a mistake py dot,\" said the German boy. \"Or else I  vos know so much der captain didn't vont nobody to know apout it,\" and  this raised a laugh.    \"It's an outrage!\" declared Tubbs. \"An outrage! I shall request my  parents to withdraw me from the institution.\" And he wrote a letter  home that very night. But his parents refused to grant his request.  Probably they knew of his shortcomings, and thought a few terms at  Putnam Hall would do him good.    Lew Flapp was much pleased over the fact that he headed the list of  those who had passed, and nobody could blame him for this. But he  immediately made himself more obnoxious than ever by going around among  the cadets and declaring that he was the only one to be elected to the  office of major.    \"It's mine by right,\" he said. \"It wouldn't be fair to elect anybody  else.\"    \"But Dick Rover and Larry Colby stand almost as high,\" said one of the  cadets. \"Captain Putnam said your average was 96 per cent., while  Rover's average was 95 per cent., and Larry Colby's was 94 per cent. A  difference of one or two per cent. out of a possible hundred isn't  much.\"    \"I don't care,\" retorted Lew Flapp, \"I ought to be elected major, and  that is all there is to it.\"    When Dick was approached he had but little to say.    \"I didn't expect to stand so high,\" he declared. \"I don't know that I  care to be made major. If I get to be a captain or a first lieutenant I  shall be well content. You know I was a second lieutenant once.\"    \"My percentage is more than I expected,\" said Larry. \"I really didn't  think I was so well up in military matters. Now, if the boys want me  for an officer I'll take whatever they give me.\"    \"And that is what I say,\" added George Granbury.    \"Ditto, myself,\" put in Tom. \"Even a second lieutenantship will not be  declined by yours truly.\"    After this there was a good deal of canvassing and \"log rolling\" as it  is called. Lew Flapp spent much money in secret, treating boys when at  the village and elsewhere. By this means he gathered quite a band of  followers around him.    \"He is going to win, by hook or by crook,\" observed Songbird Powell.  \"He acts just like some of those politicians who don't care what they  do so long as they win.\"    \"I am not going to spend a cent on the boys,\" declared Dick. \"I don't  believe in buying votes.\"    There was a strict rule at Putnam Hall that no cadet should touch  liquor of any kind excepting when ordered by the doctor. This rule had  been broken in the past by Dan Baxter and a few others, but the  majority of the cadets respected the rule and kept it.    But Lew Flapp had always been allowed to drink when at home and now he  frequently drank on the sly when down to Cedarville. On these  excursions he was generally joined by a weak-minded boy named Hurdy,  who was usually willing to do whatever Flapp desired done.    One day, just before the election for officers was to come off, Lew  Flapp called Ben Hurdy to him.    \"I am going down to Cedarville this evening,\" he said. \"I want you to  go along and invite Jackson and Pender and Rockley.\"    \"Going to have a good time?\"  asked Ben Hurdy.    \"Yes and you can tell the others so, and tell them if they know some  others who want a good time, and can keep their mouths shut about it,  to bring them along. But mind, Hurdy, we want no blabbers.\"    \"All right, Flapp, I'll get the right fellows,\" answered Ben Hurdy, and  ran away to fulfill his questionable errand.          CHAPTER X    AN ADVENTURE IN CEDARVILLE      On the same evening that Lew Flapp and his particular cronies went down  to Cedarville to have a good time in a very questionable way, Dick  Rover and Songbird Powell also visited the village, one to buy some  handkerchiefs, and the other to invest in a book he had ordered from  the local bookseller and newsdealer.    \"I heard that Lew Flapp was going to Cedarville,\" said Powell, while on  the way. \"Do you know, Dick, I don't like that fellow at all.\"    \"Neither do I, Songbird.\"    \"It will make me sick if he is elected major of the battalion.\"    \"Nevertheless, the cadets have a right to elect whom they please.\"    \"I know that as well as you do. But I can't stand Flapp's domineering  ways. And he is bound to grow worse if he is put in authority.\"    \"As to that, I shall not stand being bullied,\" came from Dick, with  flashing eyes. \"I'll let him go just so far, and if he goes any further  he'll have to beware.\"    Both boys were excellent walkers and it was not long before Cedarville  was reached. Dick soon had the handkerchiefs wanted, and then Powell  led the way to the bookstore, to obtain a volume of humorous verses he  had ordered the week previous.    \"I don't see why you buy verses, since you can make them up so  readily,\" said Dick with a smile.    \"Oh, I like to see what the other fellows are doing,\" answered his  friend.    \"I saw some more of your cadets in town to-night,\" said the bookseller,  while wrapping up the book.    \"Yes, I believe half a dozen or more came down,\" returned Powell.    \"Having a special celebration to-night?\"    \"No"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15803"],[0,"Crime and Its Causes (#8)"],[1,"------------------------------    Before proceeding to analysis the contents of this table, it will be  as well to explain the method on which it has been constructed, and  the sources from which it is derived. The population of Victoria, over  ten years of age, has been calculated according to the Victorian  census for 1881, as contained in Part II. of the Victorian Statistical  Register. In order to make the Victorian table harmonise in all  particulars with Dr. Bosco's table for England, Scotland, and Ireland,  the excess of births over deaths has been calculated up to the end of  1884. The United Kingdom, it will be seen, has been selected as the  measure of comparison with the colony of Victoria. This selection has  been made on the ground that the colony of Victoria is not composed of  the inhabitants of any one of the three kingdoms, but contains a  mixture of them all. It will also be observed that the homicidal crime  of each of the three kingdoms differs from the other, but this is a  consideration which we shall not further comment upon at present.    After these preliminary explanations we are now in a position to  examine the contents of our statistical table in its bearing upon  crimes of blood. It will now be possible to see what light the criminal  statistics of Victoria, as compared with the criminal statistics of the  United Kingdom, throw upon these crimes; and the disturbing factor of  race being eliminated, what is the influence of climate pure and simple  upon them. According to the isotherms for the year the Victorians live  in an atmosphere between eight and ten degrees hotter than our own.  Side by side with this additional heat, there is, as compared with  the United Kingdom, an additional amount of crime. In the colony of  Victoria, in proportion to every 100,000 inhabitants over ten years of  age, there are nearly one-third more murders annually than in the  United Kingdom. On what ground is this considerable increase of  homicide to be accounted for, except on the ground of climate? The  higher percentage is not caused by difference of race; it is not  caused by worse economic conditions--these conditions are much  superior to our own--the meaning of the figures is not obscured by any  material differences of legal procedure or legal nomenclature. It  cannot be urged that the Victorian population are the dregs of the  home population; the very opposite is the fact. The bad characters who  emigrate are the only disturbing element; but, after all, these men  are not so numerous, and the evil effects of their presence is  counterbalanced by the superiority of the average colonist to the  average citizen who remains at home. It may be said that there is  greater difficulty in detecting crime in a new colony than in an old  and settled country. As applied to some colonies it is possible this  objection may be sound, but, as applied to Victoria, it will not hold  good. In Victoria the police are much more effective than they are at  home, and a criminal has much less chance of going unpunished there  than he has in England. In Victoria in the year 1887, out of a total  of 40,693 cases reported to the police, 34,473 were brought up for  trial. In England, on the other hand, out of a total of 42,391  indictable offences reported to the police in 1886-7, only 19,045  persons were apprehended. The Victorian figures include offences of  all kinds, petty as well as indictable, whereas the English figures  deal with indictable offences only. But admitting this, and admitting  that it is more difficult to arrest indictable offenders, this  difficulty is not so great as to explain away the vast difference in  the numbers apprehended in Victoria as compared with the numbers  apprehended in England. Only one conclusion can be drawn from these  figures, and it is that the Victorian constabulary are more efficient  than our own, and that it is a more dangerous thing for a person to  break the law in the young colony of Victoria than in the old  community at home.    It seems to me that the points of comparison between the United  Kingdom and Victoria, in so far as they have any bearing upon crime,  have now been exhausted; on almost every one of these points Victoria  stands in a more favourable position than ourselves. The colony has,  on the whole, a better kind of citizen; it has superior social and  economic conditions; it has a far more effective system of police. On  what possible ground, then, is it, except the ground of climate, that  the Victorians are more addicted to homicide than the people of the  United Kingdom? I admit it would be rash to assert that climate is the  cause if our own and the Victorian statistics were the only documents  to which we could appeal; it would be rash to draw such a sweeping  conclusion from so isolated a basis. But when we know that the  Victorian statistics are only one set of documents among many, and  that all these sets of documents point to the operation of the same  law, the case assumes an entirely different complexion. The results of  the Victorian statistics harmonise with the conclusions already  reached from a comparison of the criminal statistics of Europe and  America. These conclusions in turn are powerfully reinforced by the  experience of Australia. In fact, the whole body of evidence, from  whatever quarter it is collected, points with remarkable unanimity to  the conviction that, as far as European peoples and their offshoots  are concerned, climate alone is no inconsiderable factor in  determining the course of human conduct.    Yet the evil influence of climate, mischievous as it is at present, is  not to be looked upon and acquiesced in as an irrevocable fatality. At  first sight it would seem as if the human race could not possibly  escape the malevolent action of cosmical influences over which it has  little or no control. The rise and fall of temperature, its rage and  intensity, is one of these influences, and yet its pernicious offsets  are capable of being held to a large extent in check. As far as bodily  comfort is concerned, it is marvellous to consider the innumerable  methods and devices the progressive races of mankind have invented to  protect themselves against the hostility of the elements by which they  are surrounded. In fact, an important part of the history of the race  consists in the ceaseless efforts it has been making to improve upon  and perfect these methods and devices. We have only to compare the  rude hut of the savage with the modern dwelling of the civilised man  in order to see to what extent we can shield ourselves from the  elemental forces in the midst of which we have to live. We have only  to mark the difference between the miserable and scanty garments of  the natives of Terra del Fuego and the attire of the Englishman of  to-day to see what can be done by man in the way of rescuing himself  from the inclemencies of Nature. If these conquests can be achieved  where our physical existence is in peril, there can be little reason  to doubt that advances of a similar nature can be made in the moral  order as soon as man comes to feel equally conscious of their  necessity. As a matter of fact, in some quarters of the world these  advances have already in some measure been made. In the vast peninsula  of India the structure of society is so constituted that the evil  effect of climate in producing crimes of blood has been marvellously  neutralised. It hardly admits of dispute that the caste system on  which Indian society is based is, on the whole, one of the most  wonderful instruments for the prevention of crimes of violence the  world has ever seen. The average temperature of the Indian peninsula  is about thirty degrees higher than the average temperature of the  British Isles, and if there were no counteracting forces at work,  crimes of violence in India should be much more numerous than they are  with us. But the counteracting forces acting upon Indian society are  of such immense potency that the malign influences of climate are very  nearly annihilated as far as the crimes we are now discussing are  concerned; and India stands to-day in the proud position of being more  free from crimes against the person than the most highly civilised  countries of Europe. In proof of this fact we have only to look at the  official documents annually issued respecting the condition of British  India. According to the returns contained in the Statistical Abstract  relating to British India and the Parliamentary paper exhibiting its  moral and material progress, the number of murders reported to the  police of India is smaller than the number reported in any European  State. The Indian Government issue no statistics, so far as I am  aware, of the numbers tried; it is, therefore, impossible to institute  any comparison between Europe and India upon this important point. But  when we come to the number convicted it is again found that India  presents a lower percentage of convictions for murder than is to be  met with among any other people. It may, however, be urged that the  statistical records respecting Indian crime are not so carefully kept  as the statistics of a like character relating to England and the  Continent. Sir John Strachey assures us that this is not the case; he  says that these statistics are as carefully collected and tabulated in  India as they are at home, and we may accept them as worthy of the  utmost confidence. The following table, which I have prepared from the  official documents already mentioned, may, therefore, be taken as  giving an accurate account of the condition of India between 1882-6,  as far as the most serious of all crimes is concerned. In order to  facilitate comparison I have drawn it up as far as possible on the  same lines as the other tables in this chapter.    ---------------------------------------------------------------------       |Population |Years.|"]]]
