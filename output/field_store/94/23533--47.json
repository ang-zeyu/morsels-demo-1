It fitted admirably; the  waistcoat could be made to button by ripping up the back, and the  trousers were perfect; but below were the ragged boots. The German was  not disconcerted. Going to the beam where a pair of top-boots hung,  he took them off, dusted them carefully, and put them down before  Bonaparte. The old eyes now fairly brimmed over with sparkling  enjoyment.    \"I have only worn them once. They might serve; they might be endured.\"    Bonaparte drew them on and stood upright, his head almost touching  the beams. The German looked at him with profound admiration. It was  wonderful what a difference feathers made in the bird.          Chapter 1.V. Sunday Services.    Service No. I.    The boy Waldo kissed the pages of his book and looked up. Far over the  flat lay the kopje, a mere speck; the sheep wandered quietly from bush  to bush; the stillness of the early Sunday rested everywhere, and the  air was fresh.    He looked down at his book. On its page a black insect crept. He lifted  it off with his finger. Then he leaned on his elbow, watching its  quivering antennae and strange movements, smiling.    \"Even you,\" he whispered, \"shall not die. Even you He loves. Even you He  will fold in His arms when He takes everything and makes it perfect and  happy.\"    When the thing had gone he smoothed the leaves of his Bible somewhat  caressingly. The leaves of that book had dropped blood for him once;  they had taken the brightness out of his childhood; from between them  had sprung the visions that had clung about him and made night horrible.  Adder-like thoughts had lifted their heads, had shot out forked tongues  at him, asking mockingly strange, trivial questions that he could not  answer, miserable child:    Why did the women in Mark see only one angel and the women in Luke two?  Could a story be told in opposite ways and both ways be true? Could it?  could it? Then again: Is there nothing always right, and nothing always  wrong? Could Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite \"put her hand to the  nail, and her right hand to the workman's hammer?\" and could the Spirit  of the Lord chant paeans over her, loud paeans, high paeans, set in the  book of the Lord, and no voice cry out it was a mean and dastardly sin  to lie, and kill the trusting in their sleep? Could the friend of God  marry his own sister, and be beloved, and the man who does it today goes  to hell, to hell? Was there nothing always right or always wrong?    Those leaves had dropped blood for him once: they had made his heart  heavy and cold; they had robbed his childhood of its gladness; now his  fingers moved over them caressingly.    \"My father God knows, my father knows,\" he said; \"we cannot understand;  He knows.\" After a while he whispered, smiling--\"I heard your voice this  morning when my eyes were not yet open, I felt you near me, my Father.  Why do you love me so? His face was illuminated. In the last four  months the old question has gone from me. I know you are good; I know  you love everything; I know, I know, I know! I could not have borne it  any more, not any more.\" He laughed softly. \"And all the while I was so  miserable you were looking at me and loving me, and I never knew it.  But I know it now. I feel it,\" said the boy, and he laughed low; \"I feel  it!\" he laughed.    After a while he began partly to sing, partly to chant the disconnected  verses of hymns, those which spoke his gladness, many times over. The  sheep with their senseless eyes turned to look at him as he sang.    At last he lapsed into quiet. Then as the boy lay there staring at bush  and sand, he saw a vision.    He had crossed the river of Death, and walked on the other bank in the  Lord's land of Beulah. His feet sank into the dark grass, and he walked  alone. Then, far over the fields, he saw a figure coming across the dark  green grass. At first he thought it must be one of the angels; but as it  came nearer he began to feel what it was. And it came closer, closer to  him, and then the voice said, \"Come,\" and he knew surely Who it was. He  ran to the dear feet and touched them with his hands; yes, he held them  fast! He lay down beside them. When he looked up the face was over him,  and the glorious eyes were loving him; and they two were there alone  together.    He laughed a deep laugh; then started up like one suddenly awakened from  sleep.    \"Oh, God!\" He cried, \"I cannot wait; I cannot wait! I want to die; I  want to see Him; I want to touch him. Let me die!\" He folded his hands,  trembling. \"How can I wait so long--for long, long years perhaps? I want  to die--to see Him. I will die any death. Oh, let me come!\"    Weeping he bowed himself, and quivered from head to foot. After a long  while he lifted his head.    \"Yes; I will wait; I will wait. But not long; do not let it be very  long, Jesus King. I want you; oh, I want you--soon, soon!\" He sat still,  staring across the plain with his tearful eyes.    Service No. II.    In the front room of the farmhouse sat Tant Sannie in her elbow-chair.  In her hand was her great brass-clasped hymn-book, round her neck was a  clean white handkerchief, under her feet was a wooden stove. There too  sat Em and Lyndall, in clean pinafores and new shoes. There too was the  spruce Hottentot in a starched white kapje, and her husband on the other  side of the door, with his wool oiled and very much combed out, and  staring at his new leather boots. The Kaffer servants were not there  because Tant Sannie held they were descended from apes, and needed no  salvation. But the rest were gathered for the Sunday service, and waited  the officiator.    Meanwhile Bonaparte and the German approached arm in arm--Bonaparte  resplendent in the black cloth clothes, a spotless shirt, and a spotless  collar; the German in the old salt-and-pepper, casting shy glances of  admiration at his companion.    At the front door Bonaparte removed his hat with much dignity, raised  his shirt collar, and entered. To the centre table he walked, put his  hat solemnly down by the big Bible, and bowed his head over it in silent  prayer.    The Boer-woman looked at the Hottentot, and the Hottentot looked at the  Boer-woman.    There was one thing on earth for which Tant Sannie had a profound  reverence, which exercised a subduing influence over her, which made her  for the time a better woman--that thing was new, shining black cloth. It  made her think of the predikant; it made her think of the elders who sat  in the top pew of the church on Sundays, with the hair so nicely oiled,  so holy and respectable, with their little swallow-tailed coats; it made  her think of heaven, where everything was so holy and respectable, and  nobody wore tancord, and the littlest angel had a black-tailed coat. She  wished she hadn't called him a thief and a Roman Catholic. She hoped the  German hadn't told him. She wondered where those clothes were when he  came in rags to her door. There was no doubt, he was a very respectable  man, a gentleman.    The German began to read a hymn. At the end of each line Bonaparte  groaned, and twice at the end of every verse.    The Boer-woman had often heard of persons groaning during prayers, to  add a certain poignancy and finish to them; old Jan Vanderlinde, her  mother's brother, always did it after he was converted; and she would  have looked upon it as no especial sign of grace in any one; but to  groan at hymn-time! She was startled. She wondered if he remembered that  she shook her fist in his face. This was a man of God. They knelt down  to pray. The Boer-woman weighed two hundred and fifty pounds, and could  not kneel. She sat in her chair, and peeped between her crossed fingers  at the stranger's back. She could not understand what he said; but he  was in earnest. He shook the chair by the back rail till it made quite a  little dust on the mud floor.    When they rose from their knees Bonaparte solemnly seated himself in  the chair and opened the Bible. He blew his nose, pulled up his shirt  collar, smoothed the leaves, stroked down his capacious waistcoat, blew  his nose again, looked solemnly round the room, then began.    \"All liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and  brimstone, which is the second death.\"    Having read this portion of Scripture, Bonaparte paused impressively,  and looked all round the room.    \"I shall not, my dear friends,\" he said, \"long detain you. Much of  our precious time has already fled blissfully from us in the voice of  thanksgiving and the tongue of praise. A few, a very few words are all  I shall address to you, and may they be as a rod of iron dividing the  bones from the marrow, and the marrow from the bones.    \"In the first place: What is a liar?\"    The question was put so pointedly, and followed by a pause so profound,  that even the Hottentot man left off looking at his boots and opened his  eyes, though he understood not a word.    \"I repeat,\" said Bonaparte, \"what is a liar?\"    The sensation was intense; the attention of the audience was riveted.    \"Have you any of you ever seen a liar, my dear friends?\" There was a  still longer pause. \"I hope not; I truly hope not. But I will tell you  what a liar is. I knew a liar once--a little boy who lived in Cape  Town, in Short Market Street. His mother and I sat together one day,  discoursing about our souls.    \"'Here, Sampson,' said his mother, 'go and buy sixpence of meiboss from  the Malay round the corner.'    \"When he came back she said: 'How much have you got?'    \"'Five,' he said.    \"He was afraid if he said six and a half she'd ask for some. And, my  friends, that was a lie. The half of a meiboss stuck in his throat and  he died and was buried. And where did the soul of that little liar go  to, my friends? It went to the lake of fire and brimstone. This brings  me to the second point of my discourse.    \"Wha"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14411"],[0,"The Children's Six Minutes (#8)"],[1,"never forget this morning's walk.\"    MEMORY VERSE, _Isaiah_ 61: 3    \"To give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the  garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called  trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be  glorified.\"    MEMORY HYMN [745]        _\"Into the woods my Master went.\"_          BANKS      Here is a bank. I have been reading lately about banks. You know that in  Jesus' day they did not have banks such as we have. People took their  treasures and jewels and hid them in a vessel, or dug a hole in the  earth and covered their valuable possessions with dirt. But now one of  the most prominent institutions of any community is the bank.    What does this bank stand for? In the first place it means Strength. It  is made of very heavy, hard material. There is money in this bank. It  does not belong to me, it is the property of our Beginners' Department.  Each Sunday they put their birthday money in here, then at the end of  the year they open it and the contents is given to our Sunday School  Missionary Society. That the money may be kept safe and sound to the end  of the year the bank is made very strong.    In the second place I notice that there is a single opening and that the  opening is made very small. It is meant for small coins, I could not  possibly get a one dollar piece into this opening. No, it is meant for  dimes, nickels and pennies. That is, it stands for Thrift. Each little  child brings his or her amount, small in itself, but when they are all  together there is a considerable sum.    Again, I see that this bank is made in the form of a church. It is  really quite a beautiful building. Here is the steeple, here the steps  and the wide entrance doors, and the windows with genuine cathedral  glass. I think it is splendid to have a bank look like a church, for  after all a church is a sort of bank. It stands for those treasures  which Jesus talked about when he said, \"Lay up for yourselves treasures  in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves  do not break through and steal.\"    MEMORY VERSE, _Matthew_ 6: 21        \"For where your treasure is there will your heart be also.\"    MEMORY HYMN [208]        _\"I love thy kingdom, Lord.\"_          WORK      This morning I want to talk to you about work. \"All work and no play  makes Jack a dull boy.\" We are sorry for girls and boys who are  compelled to work, who have little or no time for play. Now that is one  side. How about the other side? All play and no work makes Jack--what?  There are many words we can use here. I have thought about this a long  time and I have decided that the best word to put in here is useless.  All play and no work makes Jack a useless boy, and of all creatures in  the world who have no place in the scheme of things it is one who is  useless.    Now the men who are useful, we shall find, are the men who, as boys,  worked as well as played. A few days ago I sat at a public dinner next  to one of the best-known men in this city, and a useful man he is. We  were talking about some of the things boys could busy themselves with  and earn a little money. I said, \"I carried papers when I was a boy.\" He  replied, \"I carried papers on the streets of New York City when I was a  boy.\" I do not doubt that if we could have gone to all the men who sat  at that dinner each of the one hundred and fifty would have answered,  \"Yes, I worked when I was a boy.\"    I have here an illustration of work. Here are four nuts, a brazil nut,  an almond, a walnut and a pecan. Each morning as you go to school you  pass through the park. There in the park the squirrels are always to be  seen, and to you they seem to be ever at play. There are days, warm  spring days, lovely autumn days, when you do not like to go to school,  and I hear you say, \"I wish I could be like these squirrels, playing  around all day long.\" But the squirrels do not play around all day long.  They are at work, gathering nuts and storing them away for winter use.  If I should give these nuts to the squirrels they would have to work to  open them. All that is good in life comes through work. God wants us to  work as well as play, and play as well as work.    MEMORY VERSE, _Matthew_ 21: 18    \"Son, go work to-day in my vineyard.\"    MEMORY HYMN [422]        _\"Work, for the night is coming.\"_          THE BIG STORE      Many of the girls and boys who read this little book live in or near one  of the great cities where they have huge department stores. I love to  visit a big store. I have spent hours, more likely days, if I should  count up all the time, in Wanamaker's in New York and Philadelphia,  Marshall Field's in Chicago, Hengerer's in Buffalo, and Eaton's in  Toronto. Any season of the year, and almost any hour of the day, these  stores are thronged with people, for people like to go to the big store.    Now I am thinking of another big store, a truly big store, the great big  store of Life. We have to visit at this store whether we want to or not.  It is not a matter of choice but of necessity. Every morning you visit  the big store of Life. Every evening you return home with what you have  bought.    Not only must you visit this store but you must also buy. When you visit  Wanamaker's you do not have to buy unless you choose. In the big store  of Life, however, you have no choice in the matter, you must buy. What  must you buy? Well, you may buy anything you choose. This is the  beautiful thing about the big store of Life--while we are compelled to  buy we are permitted to choose. We must also pay.    \"Good morning, John, what would you like to buy this morning.\"    \"I think I'll buy a good geography lesson.\"    \"All right, you can buy that, but you must pay the price.\"    \"What is the price?\"    \"Study, earnest study. Never leave the preparation until the last minute  or trust to luck.\"    Yes, it is true, right on through every department in the big store of  Life, you can buy whatsoever you choose, but you must pay the price.    MEMORY VERSE, _Philippians_ 4: 8    \"Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever  things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are  lovely, whatsoever things are of good report ... think on these things.\"    MEMORY HYMN [332]        _\"Thou my everlasting portion.\"_          BREAD      I have here a loaf of bread. This is good-looking bread, is it not? I  can almost hear you say, \"Please pass the bread.\" That is, I hope you  say that. I hope you do not say, \"Gimme the bread.\"    Now every girl and boy here knows what it is to be hungry, I'm sure of  that. And when one is real hungry there is nothing that tastes as good  as bread. Of course there should be some butter, or jam, or peanut  butter spread over the top--my, it makes the mouth water, doesn't it!    We speak of bread as the staff of life because we could not be strong in  body if we did not have bread. We love ice cream and cake, meat and  potatoes, and many other things, but our meal is not properly balanced  unless there is a plate of bread on the table.    Jesus taught us to pray, \"Give us this day our daily bread.\" I think  this has a twofold meaning. It refers to our physical hunger and our  spiritual needs. All bread comes from the Father above, our Father of  love. Do you remember those beautiful lines,        \"Back of the loaf is the snowy flour,      And back of the flour, the mill;      And back of the mill, the seed, and the sun, and the shower,        And the Father's will.\"    Jesus once spoke of himself as the Bread sent down from above. Our  Father gives us daily bread for our physical needs, and he has also sent  us Christ for our spiritual strength. My dear young people, take him as  your Saviour.    MEMORY VERSE, _John_ 6: 51        \"I am the living bread which came down from heaven.\"    MEMORY HYMN [325]        _\"Break thou the bread of life.\"_          GOD'S MEASURE      Here I have some measures. This is a rule, we call it a folding foot  rule. Here is a square. And here is a tape measure. There are other  measures, quarts and pecks and bushels. Then there are liquid measures,  quarts and gallons and barrels. There are also measures of weight,  ounces, pounds and tons. Now these different measures are the same all  over the United States. A pound of butter in New York is the same as a  pound of butter in California. There are other countries that do not  have measures like ours. France, for example, has the metric system.  Should you go into a dry goods store in Paris you would not ask for a  yard of cloth, but for a meter.    God's measures are the same. God has a measure for girls and boys, and  that measure is the same in Ohio, Mexico, England or Spain. If it is  wrong to steal in Germany, it is wrong to steal in Brazil. If it was  wrong to commit murder in the first century, it is wrong to take life  in this century. The Ten Commandments are some of God's measures for us.    John, come up here, I want to measure you. Stand there, that's right. I  have the mark, now let us see how tall you are. Four feet, three and  one-half inches. That is fine. You are a big boy, aren't you? I wish too  that I could measure you according to God's measure. But I cannot do  that. You must do that yourself. How tall are you as you look at  yourself in the light of the Saviour's life? According to his measure I  pray that you may be tall and strong.    MEMORY VERSE, _Ephesians_ 4: 13    \"Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the  son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the  fulness of Christ.\"    MEMORY HYMN [128]        _\"We may not climb the heavenly steeps.\"_          SLEEP      I hope you had a good sleep last night. I hope you sleep well every  night. God's best gift to his children is sleep. You think there are  some better gifts, do you? Name them. Ah, I thought you were"]]]
