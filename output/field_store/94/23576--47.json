One way is to take the mental process which  is demanded by the industrial work as an undivided whole. In this case  we have to construct experimental conditions under which this total  activity can be performed in a gradual, measurable way. The psychical  part of the vocational work thus becomes schematized, and is simply  rendered experimentally on a reduced scale. The other way is to  resolve the mental process into its components and to test every  single elementary function in its isolated form. In this latter case  the examination has the advantage of having at its disposal all the  familiar methods of experimental psychology, while in the first case  for every special vocational situation perfectly new experimental  tests must be devised.    Whether the one or the other method is to be preferred must depend  upon the nature of the particular commercial or industrial calling,  and accordingly presupposes a careful analysis of the special  economical processes. It is, indeed, easy to recognize that in certain  industrial activities a series of psychical functions is in question  which all lie side by side and which do not fuse into one united  total process, however much they may influence one another. But for  many industrial tasks just this unity is the essential condition. The  testing of the mental elements would be in such cases as insufficient  as if we were to test a machine with reference to its parts only and  not with reference to its total united performance. Even in this  latter case this unified function does not represent the total  personality: it is always merely a segment of the whole mental life.  We may examine with psychological methods, for instance, the fitness  of an employee for a technical vocation and may test the particular  complex unified combination of attention, imagination and  intelligence, will and memory, which is essential for that special  kind of labor. We may be able to reconstruct the conditions so  completely that we would feel justified in predicting whether the  individual can fulfill that technical task or not; and yet we may  disregard entirely the question whether that man is honest or  dishonest, whether he is pacific or quarrelsome; in short, whether his  mental disposition makes him a desirable member of that industrial  concern under other aspects.    We best recognize the significance of these various methods by  selecting a few concrete cases as illustrations and analyzing them in  detail. But a word of warning may be given beforehand so as to avoid  misunderstandings. These examples do not stand here as reports of  completed investigations, the results of which ought to be accepted as  conclusive parts of the new psychotechnical science; they are not  presented as if the results were to be recommended like a well-tested  machine for practical purposes. Such really completed investigations  do not as yet exist in this field. All that can be offered is modest  pioneer work, and just these inquiries into the mental qualities and  their relations to the industrial vocations have attracted my  attention only very recently, and therefore certainly still demand  long continuations of the experiments in every direction. But we may  hope for satisfactory results the earlier, the more cooeperators are  entering the field, and the more such researches are started in other  places and in other institutions. I therefore offer these early  reports at the first stage of my research merely as stimulations, so  as to demonstrate the possibilities.    As an illustration of the method of examining the mental process as a  whole, I propose to discuss the case of the motormen in the electric  railways. As an illustration of the other type, namely, of analyzing  the activity and testing the elementary functions, I shall discuss the  case of the employees in the telephone service. I select these two  functions, as both play a practically important role in the technique  of modern economic life and as in both occupations very large numbers  of individuals are engaged in the work.          VIII    EXPERIMENTS IN THE INTEREST OF ELECTRIC RAILWAY SERVICE      The problem of securing fit motormen for the electric railways was  brought to my attention from without. The accidents which occurred  through the fault, or at least not without the fault, of the motormen  in street railway transportation have always aroused disquietude and  even indignation in the public, and the street railway companies  suffered much from the many payments of indemnity imposed by the court  as they amounted to thirteen per cent of the gross earnings of some  companies. Last winter the American Association for Labor Legislation  called a meeting of vocational specialists to discuss the problem of  these accidents under various aspects. The street railways of various  cities were represented, and economic, physiological, and  psychological specialists took part in the general discussion. Much  attention was given, of course, to the questions of fatigue and to the  statistical results as to the number of accidents and their relation  to the various hours of the day and to the time of labor. But there  was a strong tendency to recognize as still more important than the  mere fatigue, the whole mental constitution of the motormen. The  ability to keep attention constant, to resist distraction by chance  happenings on the street and especially the always needed ability to  foresee the possible movements of the pedestrians and vehicles were  acknowledged as extremely different from man to man. The companies  claimed that there are motormen who practically never have an  accident, because they feel beforehand even what the confused  pedestrian and the unskilled chauffeur will do, while others  relatively often experience accidents of all kinds because they do not  foresee how matters will develop. They can hardly be blamed, as they  were not careless, and yet the accidents did result from their  personal qualities; they simply lacked the gift of instinctive  foresight. All this turned the attention more and more to the  possibilities of psychological analysis, and the Association suggested  that I undertake an inquiry into this interesting problem with the  means of the psychological laboratory. I felt the practical importance  of the problem, considering that there are electric railway companies  in this country which have up to fifty thousand accident indemnity  cases a year. It therefore seemed to me decidedly worth while to  undertake a laboratory investigation.    It would have been quite possible to treat the functions of the  motormen according to the method which resolves the complex  achievement into its various elements and tests every function  independently. For instance, the stopping of the car as soon as the  danger of an accident threatens is evidently effective only if the  movement controlling the lever is carried out with sufficient  rapidity. We should accordingly be justified in examining the  quickness with which the individual reacts on optical stimuli. If a  playing child suddenly runs across the track of the electric railway,  a difference of a tenth of a second in the reaction-time may decide  his fate. But I may say at once that I did not find characteristic  differences in the rapidity of reaction of those motormen whom the  company had found reliable and those who have frequent accidents. It  seems that the slow individuals do not remain in the service at all.  As a matter of course certain other indispensable single functions,  like sharpness of vision are examined before the entrance into the  service and so they cannot stand as characteristic conditions of good  or bad service among the actual employees.    For this reason, in the case of the motormen I abstracted from the  study of single elementary functions and turned my attention to that  mental process which after some careful observations seemed to me the  really central one for the problem of accidents. I found this to be a  particular complicated act of attention by which the manifoldness of  objects, the pedestrians, the carriages, and the automobiles, are  continuously observed with reference to their rapidity and direction  in the quickly changing panorama of the street. Moving figures come  from the right and from the left toward and across the track, and are  embedded in a stream of men and vehicles which moves parallel to the  track. In the face of such manifoldness there are men whose impulses  are almost inhibited and who instinctively desire to wait for the  movement of the nearest objects; they would evidently be unfit for the  service, as they would drive the electric car far too slowly. There  are others who, even with the car at high speed, can adjust themselves  for a time to the complex moving situation, but whose attention soon  lapses, and while they are fixating a rather distant carriage, may  overlook a pedestrian who carelessly crosses the track immediately in  front of their car. In short, we have a great variety of mental types  of this characteristic unified activity, which may be understood as a  particular combination of attention and imagination.    My effort was to transplant this activity of the motormen into  laboratory processes. And here I may include a remark on the  methodology of psychological industrial experiments. One might  naturally think that the experience of a special industrial  undertaking would be best reproduced for the experiment by repeating  the external conditions in a kind of miniature form. That would mean  that we ought to test the motormen of the electric railway by  experiments with small toy models of electric cars placed on the  laboratory table. But this would be decidedly inappropriate. A reduced  copy of an external apparatus may arouse ideas, feelings, and  volitions which have little in common with the processes of actual  life.

So I went to the island of Sado,[4] and gathering the sand and  earth which had been cast away as worthless by the miners, fused it  afresh in the fire; and at this work I spent months and days.\" As the  badger finished speaking, the priest looked at the money which it had  produced, and sure enough he saw that it was bright and new and clean;  so he took the money, and received it respectfully, raising it to his  head.    \"And so you have had all this toil and labour on account of a foolish  speech of mine? I have obtained my heart's desire, and am truly  thankful.\"    As he was thanking the badger with great politeness and ceremony, the  beast said: \"In doing this I have but fulfilled my own wish; still I  hope that you will tell this thing to no man.\"    \"Indeed,\" replied the priest, \"I cannot choose but tell this story. For  if I keep this money in my poor hut, it will be stolen by thieves: I  must either give it to some one to keep for me, or else at once offer it  up at the temple. And when I do this, when people see a poor old priest  with a sum of money quite unsuited to his station, they will think it  very suspicious, and I shall have to tell the tale as it occurred; but I  shall say that the badger that gave me the money has ceased coming to my  hut, you need not fear being waylaid, but can come, as of old, and  shelter yourself from the cold.\" To this the badger nodded assent; and  as long as the old priest lived, it came and spent the winter nights  with him.    From this story, it is plain that even beasts have a sense of gratitude:  in this quality dogs excel all other beasts. Is not the story of the dog  of Totoribe Yorodzu written in the Annals of Japan? I[5] have heard that  many anecdotes of this nature have been collected and printed in a book,  which I have not yet seen; but as the facts which I have recorded relate  to a badger, they appear to me to be passing strange.

Hit ain't bin no  time, skacely, sence de supper-bell rung, en ef you go on dis a-way,  you'll des nat'ally pe'sh yo'se'f out.\"    \"Oh, I wasn't hungry,\" said the little boy. \"I had something before  supper, and I wasn't hungry anyway.\"    The old man looked keenly at the child, and presently he said:    \"De ins en de outs er dat kinder talk all come ter de same p'int in my  min'. Youer bin a-cuttin' up at de table, en Mars John, he tuck'n sont  you 'way fum dar, en w'iles he think youer off some'er a-snifflin' en  a-feelin' bad, yer you is a-high-primin' 'roun' des lak you done had mo'  supper dan de King er Philanders.\"    Before the little boy could inquire about the King of Philanders he  heard his father calling him. He started to go out, but Uncle Remus  motioned him back.    \"Des set right whar you is, honey--des set right still.\"    Then Uncle Remus went to the door and answered for the child; and a very  queer answer it was--one that could be heard half over the plantation:    \"Mars John, I wish you en Miss Sally be so good ez ter let dat chile  'lone. He down yer cryin' he eyes out, en he ain't boddern' 'long er  nobody in de roun' worl'.\"    Uncle Remus stood in the door a moment to see what the reply would be,  but he heard none. Thereupon he continued, in the same loud tone:    \"I ain't bin use ter no sich gwines on in Ole Miss time, en I ain't  gwine git use ter it now. Dat I ain't.\"    Presently 'Tildy, the house-girl, brought the little boy his supper, and  the girl was no sooner out of hearing than the child swapped it with  Uncle Remus for a roasted yam, and the enjoyment of both seemed to be  complete.    \"Uncle Remus,\" said the little boy, after a while, \"you know I wasn't  crying just now.\"    \"Dat's so, honey,\" the old man replied, \"but 't wouldn't er bin long  'fo' you would er bin, kaze Mars John bawl out lak a man wa't got a  strop in he han', so wa't de diff'unce?\"    When they had finished eating, Uncle Remus busied himself in cutting and  trimming some sole-leather for future use. His knife was so keen, and  the leather fell away from it so smoothly and easily, that the little  boy wanted to trim some himself. But to this Uncle Remus would not  listen.    \"'Tain't on'y chilluns w'at got de consate er doin' eve'ything dey see  yuther folks do. Hit's grown folks w'at oughter know better,\" said the  old man. \"Dat's des de way Brer B'ar git his tail broke off  smick-smack-smoove, en down ter dis day he be funnies'-lookin' creetur  w'at wobble on top er dry groun'.\"    Instantly the little boy forgot all about Uncle Remus's sharp knife.    \"Hit seem lak dat in dem days Brer Rabbit en Brer Tarrypin done gone in  cohoots fer ter outdo de t'er creeturs. One time Brer Rabbit tuck'n make  a call on Brer Tarrypin, but w'en he git ter Brer Tarrypin house, he  year talk fum Miss Tarrypin dat her ole man done gone fer ter spen' de  day wid Mr. Mud-Turkle, w'ich dey wuz blood kin. Brer Rabbit he put out  atter Brer Tarrypin, en w'en he got ter Mr. Mud-Turkle house, dey all  sot up, dey did, en tole tales, en den w'en twelf er' clock come dey had  crawfish fer dinner, en dey 'joy deyse'f right erlong.

The little boy had not only seen them, but had found them to be very  dangerous to walk upon, and the old man continued:    \"Well, den, dish yer rock wuz mighty slick en mighty slantin'. Mr.  Mud-Turkle, he'd crawl ter de top, en tu'n loose, en go a-sailin' down  inter de water--_kersplash!_ Ole Brer Tarrypin, he'd foller atter, en  slide down inter de water--_kersplash!_ Ole Brer Rabbit, he sot off, he  did, en praise um up.    \"W'iles dey wuz a-gwine on dis a-way, a-havin' der fun, en 'joyin'  deyse'f, yer come ole Brer B'ar.

The queen was passionately fond of the youngest of the princes.  She gave him the best robes, the best horses, the best food, and the  best furniture. The other three princes became exceedingly jealous of  their youngest brother, and, conspiring against him and their mother,  made them live in a separate house, and took possession of the estate.  Owing to overindulgence, the youngest prince had become very wilful. He  never listened to any one, not even to his mother, but had his own way  in everything. One day he went with his mother to bathe in the river. A  large boat was riding there at anchor. None of the boatmen were in it.  The prince went into the boat, and told his mother to come into it. His  mother besought him to get down from the boat, as it did not belong to  him. But the prince said, \"No, mother I am not coming down; I mean to go  on a voyage, and if you wish to come with me, then delay not but come up  at once, or I shall be off in a trice.\" The queen besought the prince to  do no such thing, but to come down instantly. But the prince gave no  heed to what"]]]
