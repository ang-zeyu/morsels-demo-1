The  age of folios was rapidly passing away; but few folios of the period  appear to have been more generally read, if we are to judge at least  from its being frequently mentioned and quoted, than Webster's  _Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft_. The same able writer's \"Doubt  whether Sir Matthew Hale ever read Webster's _Discovery of Supposed  Witchcraft_,\" might easily have been satisfied by a reference to any  common life of that great judge, which would have shown the historian  of Whalley that Hale died before the book was published. Nor is Dr.  Whitaker correct in stating that all tradition of Webster is now lost  in the neighbourhood where he resided. The following anecdote, which  would have delighted him, I had from an old inhabitant of Burnley, to  whom it had been handed down by his grandfather:--In the days of  Webster's fanaticism, during the usurpation, he is stated, in the  zealous crusade then so common against superstitious relics, to have  headed a party by whom the three venerable crosses, now set up in the  churchyard of Whalley, commonly called the Crosses of Paulinus, and  supposed to be coeval with the first preaching of Christianity in the  North of England, were removed and taken away from their site and  appropriated as a boundary fence for some adjoining fields. After the  Restoration, and when his religious views had become sobered and  settled, he is said, in an eager desire to atone for the desecration  of which he had been guilty, to have purchased the crosses from the  person who was then in possession of them, and to have been at the  cost of re-erecting them on their present site, from which no  sacrilegious hand will, I trust, ever again remove them. It is further  said, that Webster's favourite and regular walk, in the latter part of  his life, till his infirmities rendered him unable to take exercise of  any kind, was to the remains of Whalley Abbey; and that a path along  the banks of the stream which glides by those most picturesque and  pleasing ruins, was long called \"Webster's Walk.\" If this tradition be  founded in fact, and I give it as I received it, John Webster, of  Clitheroe, if not identical, as Mr. Collier has contended, with the  dramatic poet of that name, must have felt something assimilated in  spirit to the fine inspiration of those noble lines of the latter:--             \"I do love these ancient ruins.      We never tread upon them but we set      Our foot upon some reverend history;      And, questionless, here in this open court,      Which now lies naked to the injuries      Of stormy weather, some men lie interred that      Lov'd the Church so well and gave so largely to't,      They thought it should have canopied their bones      Till doomsday: but all things have their end.      Churches and cities, which have diseases like to men,      Must have like death that we have.\"]    [Footnote 30: Webster's death took place on the 18th June, 1682. He  left an extensive library, composed principally of chemical,  hermetical, and philosophical works, of which the MSS. catalogue is  now in the possession of my friend, the Rev. T. Corser. I have two  books which appear to have at one time formed part of his collection,  from having his favourite signature, Johannes Hyphantes, in his  autograph, on the title pages. Before I conclude with Webster, I ought  perhaps to observe, that in the valuable edition of the works of  Webster, the dramatic poet, published by the Rev. A. Dyce, that most  accurate and judicious editor has proved indisputably, by an elaborate  argument, that the John Webster, the writer of the _Examen  Academiarum_, and John Webster, the author of the _Displaying of  Supposed Witchcraft_, were one and the same person, who was not  identical with the dramatic writer of the same name. Mr. Dyce does  not, however, appear to have been aware, that the identity of the  author of the _Examen Academiarum_ and the writer on witchcraft is  distinctly stated by Dr. Henry More, in his _Praefatio Generalissima_,  to the Latin edition of his works, whose testimony being that of a  contemporary, who was, like Webster, \"a Cambridge scholar,\" may  perhaps be considered sufficient, without resorting to internal and  circumstantial evidence. The inscription on Webster's monument in the  chapel of St. Mary Magdalen, at Clitheroe, is too characteristic and  curious to be omitted. I give it entire:--        \"_Qui hanc figuram intelligunt      Me etiam intellexisse, intelligent._        [Illustration]        _Hic jacet ignotus mundo, mersusque tumultu      Invidiae, semper mens tamen aequa fuit,      Multa tulit veterum ut sciret secreta sophorum      Ac tandem vires noverit ignis aquae._           *       *       *       *       *        _Johannes Hyphantes sive Webster,      In villa Spinosa supermontana, in      Parochia silvae cuculatae, in agro      Eboracensi, natus 1610 Feb. 3,      Ergastulum animae deposuit 1682, Junii 18,      Annoq. aetatis suae 72 currente._        _Sicq. peroravit moriens mundo huic valedicens,      Aurea pax vivis, requies aeterna sepultis._\"]    But it is necessary to proceed from the authors on witchcraft to that  extraordinary case which forms the subject of the present  republication, and which first gave to Pendle its title to be  considered as the Hartz Forest of England.    The Forest of Pendle is a portion of the greater one of  Blackburnshire, and is so called from the celebrated mountain of that  name, over the declivity of which it extends and stretches in a long  but interrupted descent of five miles, to the water of Pendle, a  barren and dreary tract. Dr. Whitaker observes of this and the  neighbouring forests, and the remark even yet holds good, \"that they  still bear the marks of original barrenness, and recent cultivation;  that they are still distinguished from the ancient freehold tracts  around them, by want of old houses, old woods, high fences; (for these  were forbidden by the forest laws;) by peculiarities of dialect and  manners in their inhabitants; and lastly, by a general air of poverty  which all the opulence of manufactures cannot remove.\" He considers  that \"at an uncertain period during the occupancy of the Lacies, the  first principle of population\" (in these forests) commenced; it was  found that these wilds, bleak and barren as they were, might be  occupied to some advantage in breeding young and depasturing lean  \"cattle, which were afterwards fattened in the lower domains.  _Vaccaries_, or great upland pastures, were laid out for this purpose;  _booths_ or mansions erected upon them for the residence of herdsmen;  and at the same time that herds of deer were permitted to range at  large as heretofore, _lawnds_, by which are meant parks within a  forest, were inclosed, in order to chase them with greater facility,  or, by confinement, to produce fatter venison. Of these lawnds Pendle  had new and old lawnd, with the contiguous park of Ightenhill.\"    In the early part of the seventeenth century, the inhabitants of this  district must have been, with few exceptions, a wretchedly poor and  uncultivated race, having little communication with the occupants of  the more fertile regions around them, and in whose minds superstition,  even yet unextinguished, must have had absolute and uncontrollable  domination. Under the disenchanting influence of steam, manufactures,  and projected rail-roads, still much of the old character of its  population remains. _Hodie manent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18269"],[0,"Pascal's Pensées (#8)"],[1,"and an ultimate sure foundation whereon to build a tower reaching to the  Infinite. But our whole groundwork cracks, and the earth opens to  abysses.    Let us therefore not look for certainty and stability. Our reason is  always deceived by fickle shadows; nothing can fix the finite between  the two Infinites, which both enclose and fly from it.    If this be well understood, I think that we shall remain at rest, each  in the state wherein nature has placed him. As this sphere which has  fallen to us as our lot is always distant from either extreme, what  matters it that man should have a little more knowledge of the universe?  If he has it, he but gets a little higher. Is he not always infinitely  removed from the end, and is not the duration of our life equally  removed from eternity, even if it lasts ten years longer?    In comparison with these Infinites all finites are equal, and I see no  reason for fixing our imagination on one more than on another. The only  comparison which we make of ourselves to the finite is painful to us.    If man made himself the first object of study, he would see how  incapable he is of going further. How can a part know the whole? But he  may perhaps aspire to know at least the parts to which he bears some  proportion. But the parts of the world are all so related and linked to  one another, that I believe it impossible to know one without the other  and without the whole.    Man, for instance, is related to all he knows. He needs a place wherein  to abide, time through which to live, motion in order to live, elements  to compose him, warmth and food to nourish him, air to breathe. He sees  light; he feels bodies; in short, he is in a dependent alliance with  everything. To know man, then, it is necessary to know how it happens  that he needs air to live, and, to know the air, we must know how it is  thus related to the life of man, etc. Flame cannot exist without air;  therefore to understand the one, we must understand the other.    Since everything then is cause and effect, dependent and supporting,  mediate and immediate, and all is held together by a natural though  imperceptible chain, which binds together things most distant and most  different, I hold it equally impossible to know the parts without  knowing the whole, and to know the whole without knowing the parts in  detail.    [The eternity of things in itself or in God must also astonish our  brief duration. The fixed and constant immobility of nature, in  comparison with the continual change which goes on within us, must have  the same effect.]    And what completes our incapability of knowing things, is the fact that  they are simple, and that we are composed of two opposite natures,  different in kind, soul and body. For it is impossible that our rational  part should be other than spiritual; and if any one maintain that we are  simply corporeal, this would far more exclude us from the knowledge of  things, there being nothing so inconceivable as to say that matter knows  itself. It is impossible to imagine how it should know itself.    So if we are simply material, we can know nothing at all; and if we are  composed of mind and matter, we cannot know perfectly things which are  simple, whether spiritual or corporeal. Hence it comes that almost all  philosophers have confused ideas of things, and speak of material things  in spiritual terms, and of spiritual things in material terms. For they  say boldly that bodies have a tendency to fall, that they seek after  their centre, that they fly from destruction, that they fear the void,  that they have inclinations, sympathies, antipathies, all of which  attributes pertain only to mind. And in speaking of minds, they consider  them as in a place, and attribute to them movement from one place to  another; and these are qualities which belong only to bodies.    Instead of receiving the ideas of these things in their purity, we  colour them with our own qualities, and stamp with our composite being  all the simple things which we contemplate.    Who would not think, seeing us compose all things of mind and body, but  that this mixture would be quite intelligible to us? Yet it is the very  thing we least understand. Man is to himself the most wonderful object  in nature; for he cannot conceive what the body is, still less what the  mind is, and least of all how a body should be united to a mind. This is  the consummation of his difficulties, and yet it is his very being.  _Modus quo corporibus adhaerent spiritus comprehendi ab hominibus non  potest, et hoc tamen homo est_.[35] Finally, to complete the proof of  our weakness, I shall conclude with these two considerations....      73    [But perhaps this subject goes beyond the capacity of reason. Let us  therefore examine her solutions to problems within her powers. If there  be anything to which her own interest must have made her apply herself  most seriously, it is the inquiry into her own sovereign good. Let us  see, then, wherein these strong and clear-sighted souls have placed it,  and whether they agree.    One says that the sovereign good consists in virtue, another in  pleasure, another in the knowledge of nature, another in truth, _Felix  qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas_,[36] another in total ignorance,  another in indolence, others in disregarding appearances, another in  wondering at nothing, _nihil admirari prope res una quae possit facere et  servare beatum_,[37] and the true sceptics in their indifference, doubt,  and perpetual suspense, and others, wiser, think to find a better  definition. We are well satisfied.    _To transpose after the laws to the following title._    We must see if this fine philosophy have gained nothing certain from so  long and so intent study; perhaps at least the soul will know itself.  Let us hear the rulers of the world on this subject. What have they  thought of her substance? 394.[38] Have they been more fortunate in  locating her? 395.[39] What have they found out about her origin,  duration, and departure? 399.[40]    Is then the soul too noble a subject for their feeble lights? Let us  then abase her to matter and see if she knows whereof is made the very  body which she animates, and those others which she contemplates and  moves at her will. What have those great dogmatists, who are ignorant of  nothing, known of this matter? _Harum sententiarum_,[41] 393.    This would doubtless suffice, if reason were reasonable. She is  reasonable enough to admit that she has been unable to find anything  durable, but she does not yet despair of reaching it; she is as ardent  as ever in this search, and is confident she has within her the  necessary powers for this conquest. We must therefore conclude, and,  after having examined her powers in their effects, observe them in  themselves, and see if she has a nature and a grasp capable of laying  hold of the truth.]      74    A letter _On the Foolishness of Human Knowledge and Philosophy_.

To begin at the very beginning.] What is  more absurd than to say that lifeless bodies have passions, fears,  hatreds--that insensible bodies, lifeless and incapable of life, have  passions which presuppose at least a sensitive soul to feel them, nay  more, that the object of their dread is the void? What is there in the  void that could make them afraid? Nothing is more shallow and  ridiculous. This is not all; it is said that they have in themselves a  source of movement to shun the void. Have they arms, legs, muscles,  nerves?      76    To write against those who made too profound a study of science:  Descartes.      77    I cannot forgive Descartes. In all his philosophy he would have been  quite willing to dispense with God. But he had to make Him give a fillip  to set the world in motion; beyond this, he has no further need of God.      78    Descartes useless and uncertain.      79    [_Descartes._--We must say summarily: \"This is made by figure and  motion,\" for it is true. But to say what these are, and to compose the  machine, is ridiculous. For it is useless, uncertain, and painful. And  were it true, we do not think all philosophy is worth one hour of pain.]      80    How comes it that a cripple does not offend us, but that a fool  does?[45] Because a cripple recognises that we walk straight, whereas a  fool declares that it is we who are silly; if it were not so, we should  feel pity and not anger.    Epictetus[46] asks still more strongly: \"Why are we not angry if we are  told that we have a headache, and why are we angry if we are told that  we reason badly, or choose wrongly?\" The reason is that we are quite  certain that we have not a headache, or are not lame, but we are not so  sure that we make a true choice. So having assurance only because we see  with our whole sight, it puts us into suspense and surprise when another  with his whole sight sees the opposite, and still more so when a  thousand others deride our choice. For we must prefer our own lights to  those of so many others, and that is bold and difficult. There is never  this contradiction in the feelings towards a cripple.      81    It is natural for the mind to believe, and for the will to love;[47] so  that, for want of true objects, they must attach themselves to false.      82    _Imagination._[48]--It is that deceitful part in man, that mistress of  error and falsity, the more deceptive that she is not always so; for she  would be an infallible rule of truth, if she were an infallible rule of  falsehood. But being most generally false, she gives no sign of her  nature, impressing the same character on the true and the false.    I do not speak of fools, I speak of the wisest "]]]
