The Parson of the parish denied us because she  had never been baptized. I applied to the Quakers, but met with no  success; this was one of the greatest trials I ever met with, as we did  not know what to do with our poor baby.--At length I resolv'd to dig a  grave in the garden behind the house, and bury her there; when the  Parson of the parish sent for me to tell me he would bury the child, but  did not chuse to read the burial service over her. I told him I did not  mind whether he would or not, as the child could not hear it.    We met with a great deal of ill treatment after this, and found it very  difficult to live.--We could scarcely get work to do, and were obliged  to pawn our cloaths. We were ready to sink under our troubles.--When I  purposed to my wife to go to _Kidderminster_ and try if we could do  there. I had always an inclination for that place, and now more than  ever as I had heard _Mr. Fawcet_ mentioned in the most respectful  manner, as a pious worthy Gentleman; and I had seen his name in a  favourite book of mine, Baxter's _Saints everlasting rest_, and as the  Manufactory of _Kidderminster_ seemed to promise my wife some  employment, she readily came into my way of thinking.    I left her once more, and set out for _Kidderminster_, in order to judge  if the situation would suit us.--As soon as I came there I waited  immediately on _Mr. Fawcet_, who was pleased to receive me very kindly  and recommended me to _Mr. Watson_ who employed me in twisting silk and  worsted together. I continued here about a fortnight, and when I thought  it would answer our expectation, I returned to _Norwich_ to fetch my  wife; she was then near her time, and too much indisposed. So we were  obliged to tarry until she was brought to bed, and as soon as she could  conveniently travel we came to _Kidderminster_, but we brought nothing  with us as we were obliged to sell all we had to pay our debts and the  expences of my wife's illness, &c.    Such is our situation at present.--My wife, by hard labor at the loom,  does every thing that can be expected from her towards the maintenance  of our family; and God is pleased to incline the hearts of his People at  times to yield us their charitable assistance; being myself through age  and infirmity able to contribute but little to their support. As  Pilgrims, and very poor Pilgrims, we are travelling through many  difficulties towards our Heavenly Home, and waiting patiently for his  gracious call, when the Lord shall deliver us out of the evils of this  present world and bring us to the Everlasting Glories of the world to  come.--To HIM be Praise for Ever and Ever, AMEN.

This very monster of mankind appeared in the beginning of his reign to  be a person of virtue. Many of the greatest tyrants on the records of  history have begun their reigns in the fairest manner. But the truth  is, this unnatural power corrupts both the heart and the understanding.  And to prevent the least hope of amendment, a king is ever surrounded by  a crowd of infamous flatterers, who find their account in keeping him  from the least light of reason, till all ideas of rectitude and justice  are utterly erased from his mind. When Alexander had in his fury  inhumanly butchered one of his best friends and bravest captains; on the  return of reason he began to conceive an horror suitable to the guilt of  such a murder. In this juncture his council came to his assistance. But  what did his council? They found him out a philosopher who gave him  comfort. And in what manner did this philosopher comfort him for the  loss of such a man, and heal his conscience, flagrant with the smart of  such a crime? You have the matter at length in Plutarch. He told him,  \"_that let a sovereign do what he wilt, all his actions are just and  lawful, because they are his_.\" The palaces of all princes abound with  such courtly philosophers. The consequence was such as might be  expected. He grew every day a monster more abandoned to unnatural lust,  to debauchery, to drunkenness, and to murder. And yet this was  originally a great man, of uncommon capacity, and a strong propensity to  virtue. But unbounded power proceeds step by step, until it has  eradicated every laudable principle. It has been remarked, that there is  no prince so bad, whose favorites and ministers are not worse. There is  hardly any prince without a favorite, by whom he is governed in as  arbitrary a manner as he governs the wretches subjected to him. Here the  tyranny is doubled. There are two courts, and two interests; both very  different from the interests of the people. The favorite knows that the  regard of a tyrant is as unconstant and capricious as that of a woman;  and concluding his time to be short, he makes haste to fill up the  measure of his iniquity, in rapine, in luxury, and in revenge. Every  avenue to the throne is shut up. He oppresses and ruins the people,  whilst he persuades the prince that those murmurs raised by his own  oppression are the effects of disaffection to the prince's government.  Then is the natural violence of despotism inflamed and aggravated by  hatred and revenge. To deserve well of the state is a crime against the  prince. To be popular, and to be a traitor, are considered as synonymous  terms. Even virtue is dangerous, as an aspiring quality, that claims an  esteem by itself, and independent of the countenance of the court. What  has been said of the chief, is true of the inferior officers of this  species of government; each in his province exercising the same tyranny,  and grinding the people by an oppression, the more severely felt, as it  is near them, and exercised by base and subordinate persons. For the  gross of the people, they are considered as a mere herd of cattle; and  really in a little time become no better; all principle of honest pride,  all sense of the dignity of their nature, is lost in their slavery. The  day, says Homer, which makes a man a slave, takes away half his worth;  and, in fact, he loses every impulse to action, but that low and base  one of fear. In this kind of government human nature is not only abused  and insulted, but it is actually degraded and sunk into a species of  brutality. The consideration of this made Mr. Locke say, with great  justice, that a government of this kind was worse than anarchy: indeed  it is so abhorred and detested by all who live under forms that have a  milder appearance, that there is scarcely a rational man in Europe that  would not prefer death to Asiatic despotism. Here then we have the  acknowledgment of a great philosopher, that an irregular state of nature  is preferable to such a government; we have the consent of all sensible  and generous men, who carry it yet further, and avow that death itself  is preferable; and yet this species of government, so justly condemned,  and so generally detested, is what infinitely the greater part of  mankind groan under, and have groaned under from the beginning. So that,  by sure and uncontested principles, the greatest part of the governments  on earth must be concluded tyrannies, impostures, violations of the  natural rights of mankind, and worse than the most disorderly anarchies.  How much other forms exceed this we shall consider immediately.    In all parts of the world, mankind, however debased, retains still the  sense of _feeling_; the weight of tyranny at last becomes insupportable;  but the remedy is not so easy: in general, the only remedy by which they  attempt to cure the tyranny is to change the tyrant. This is, and always  was, the case for the greater part. In some countries, however, were  found men of more penetration, who discovered \"_that to live by one  man's will was the cause of all men's misery_.\" They therefore changed  their former method, and assembling the men in their several societies  the most respectable for their understanding and fortunes, they confided  to them the charge of the public welfare. This originally formed what is  called an _aristocracy_. They hoped it would be impossible that such a  number could ever join in any design against the general good; and they  promised themselves a great deal of security and happiness from the  united counsels of so many able and experienced persons. But it is now  found by abundant experience, that an _aristocracy_, and a _despotism_,  differ but in name; and that a people who are in general excluded from  any share of the legislative, are, to all intents and purposes, as much  slaves, when twenty, independent of them, govern, as when but one  domineers. The tyranny is even more felt, as every individual of the  nobles has the haughtiness of a sultan; the people are more miserable,  as they seem on the verge of liberty, from which they are forever  debarred; this fallacious idea of liberty, whilst it presents a vain  shadow of happiness to the subject, binds faster the chains of his  subjection. What is left undone by the natural avarice and pride of  those who are raised above the others, is completed by their suspicions,  and their dread of losing an authority, which has no support in the  common utility of the nation. A Genoese or a Venetian republic is a  concealed _despotism_; where you find the same pride of the rulers, the  same base subjection of the people, the same bloody maxims of a  suspicious policy. In one respect the _aristocracy_ is worse than the  _despotism_. A body politic, whilst it retains its authority, never  changes its maxims; a _despotism_, which is this day horrible to a  supreme degree, by the caprice natural to the heart of man, may, by the  same caprice otherwise exerted, be as lovely the next; in a succession,  it is possible to meet with some good princes. If there have been  Tiberiuses, Caligulas, Neros, there have been likewise the serener days  of Vespasians, Tituses, Trajans, and Antonines; but a body politic is  not influenced by caprice or whim, it proceeds in a regular manner, its  succession is insensible; and every man as he enters it, either has, or  soon attains, the spirit of the whole body. Never was it known that an  _aristocracy_, which was haughty and tyrannical in one century, became  easy and mild in the next. In effect, the yoke of this species of  government is so galling, that whenever the people have got the least  power, they have shaken it off with the utmost indignation, and  established a popular form. And when they have not had strength enough  to support themselves, they have thrown themselves into the arms of  _despotism_, as the more eligible of the two evils. This latter was the  case of Denmark, who sought a refuge from the oppression of its  nobility, in the strong hold of arbitrary power. Poland has at present  the name of republic, and it is one of the _aristocratic_ form; but it  is well known that the little finger of this government is heavier than  the loins of arbitrary power in most nations. The people are not only  politically, but personally slaves, and treated with the utmost  indignity. The republic of Venice is somewhat more moderate; yet even  here, so heavy is the _aristocratic_ yoke, that the nobles have been  obliged to enervate the spirit of their subjects by every sort of  debauchery; they have denied them the liberty of reason, and they have  made them amends by what a base soul will think a more valuable liberty,  by not only allowing, but encouraging them to corrupt themselves in the  most scandalous manner. They consider their subjects as the farmer does  the hog he keeps to feast upon. He holds him fast in his sty, but allows  him to wallow as much as he pleases in his beloved filth and gluttony.  So scandalously debauched a people as that of Venice is to be met with  nowhere else. High, low, men, women, clergy, and laity, are all alike.  The ruling nobility are no less afraid of one another than they are of  the people; and, for that reason, politically enervate their own body by  the same effeminate luxury by which they corrupt their subjects. They  are impoverished by every means which can be invented; and they are kept  in a perpetual terror by the horrors of a state inquisition. Here you  see a people deprived of all rational freedom, and tyrannized over by  about two thousand men; and yet this body of two thousand are so far  from enjoying any liberty by the subjection of the rest, that they are  in an infinitely severer state of slavery; they make themselves the most  degenerate and unhappy of mankind, for no other purpose than that they  may the more effectually contribute"]]]
