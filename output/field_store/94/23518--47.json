Our stock and premises will then be transferred to Messrs.

These are a portion  of the capital of the successful man, and a more essential portion  than money or goods.      HONESTY.    \"Sharp practice\" may bring a temporary gain but in the long run of life  that man will be far ahead who deals squarely and honestly at all times.  A thoroughly honest clerk will command a higher salary than one of  equivocal habits, while the merchant who has a reputation for honesty  and truthfulness in regard to the quality and value of his goods, will  on this account he favored with a considerable custom. The business man  whose \"word is as good as his bond\" can in any emergency, control large  amounts of capital, the use of which brings him a rich return, while the  man who sells his neighbor's good opinion for a temporary gain, will  find that he has discounted his future success, but taking an advantage  at the cost of ten tines its value.      INDUSTRY.    No other quality can take the place of this, and no talents of mind,  however excellent, will bring success without labor; persistent  systematic labor. The young man who expects to find some royal road  to success with little or no effort, or who imagines that his mental  abilities will compensate for a lack of application, cheats and ruins  himself. Horace Greeley probably never said a grander thing than this:  \"The saddest hour in any man's career is that wherein he, for the  first time, fancies there is an easier was of gaining a dollar than  by squarely earning it.\" and Horace Greeley was himself an example of  success through industry.    [Image: COUNSEL AND ADVICE.]    It is not genius, but the great mass of average people, who _work_,  that make the successes in life. Some toil with the brain, and others  toil with the hand, but all must toil. Industry applies to hours in  business and out of business. It means not only to perform all  required work promptly, but to occupy spare moments usefully, not to  idle evenings, and to rise early in the morning.    An [Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'employe'] employee  should not confine himself to his mere obligatory duties. He should  be ready to work sometimes over hours or in other departments if it is  desired of him. Willingness to _work_ is one of the finest qualities  in a character, and will compensate for many other deficiencies.      MEMORY.    This faculty, always so useful, is pre-eminently so to the business  man. It must be both retentive and quick. By proper training this  faculty may be so cultivated that names, dates and events to a  surprising number may be readily recalled. The ability to greet a  customer by calling him by name is considered very valuable in any  class of business. It makes a very agreeable impression when a man who  has not seen us but once or twice, and who is not expecting us, meets  us promptly as we enter his store, with, \"Why, Mr. ----, how do you  do? Glad to see you. When did you leave Newark?\" We feel as if we had  occupied that man's thoughts since we saw him before. He appreciates  us, and we feel like patronizing him. Whereas, on the other hand to  meet a customer with a blank, inquiring expression, and greet him with,  \"Your face is familiar, but I can't recall your name.\" is unpleasant  and tends to drive away custom. Every hotel keeper knows the value  of this greeting of customers. Facts, figures and dates are very  necessary to remember in business, and these often form the basis of  a business transaction or venture by which large profits are made.  Superior ability in remembering prices and their fluctuations has been  the secret of more than one brilliant success.    Desultory reading injures the memory, while close application to a  subject, recalling the various points therein, tends greatly to improve  this faculty. The clerk or employee [Transcriber's Note: The original  text reads 'employe'] in receiving instructions from his principal should  endeavor to impress every point clearly on his mind, and retain them  there until they are carried out in action. Carelessness and  forgetfulness often causes the discharge of otherwise worthy and  competent young persons, as employers do not like to repeat their orders.      PROMPTNESS.    A very essential element in the character of the business man is  promptness. Filling all engagements at exactly the appointed time,  answering letters or forwarding goods with promptness, the man of  business finds that much more can be accomplished and with far greater  accuracy, than by a loose system of putting off till tomorrow, or  according to convenience. Not only so, but competition in business is  such that the merchant or tradesman who does not deal with promptness  can hardly expect to hold his custom. Young men starting out in the  world should form the resolution of doing everything on time. Better  to be ahead in the performance of duties than behind. This promptness  then acts as a stimulant in itself, and is oftentimes the means of  winning success in an enterprise.    A thing that is worth the doing, ought to be done quickly when the  time is ripe for it. A prompt man or woman is valued, as he respects  his word and has due regard for the convenience of others.      EXECUTIVE ABILITY.    Wavering, timid and uncertain, the man without executive ability never  achieves distinction in active life. Intelligence to decide on any  measure, firmness in adhering to the decision, and force of will in  carrying it out, constitute executive ability, and are as essential to  the business man as his stock in trade.    The timid man never makes up his mind until after the opportunity is  past, or decides, then recalls his decision, and feels incapable  of promptly estimating all the facts in the case. This weakness is  oftentimes natural, but more frequently it is a bad habit which should  be broken up.    Rashness is to decide and act without taking the trouble to weigh  intelligently the facts in the case. This is inexcusable folly, and  always brings serious trouble sooner or later.    Through executive ability the labor or services of one man may be made  to produce largely, or without proper direction such services may be  almost worthless; and in the case of many employees [Transcriber's Note:  The original text reads 'employes'] under one executive head, the results  of this combined labor may be great success, or where executive ability  is wanting, a great failure.    The successful farmer, merchant, manufacturer, banker, and professional  man must have this combination of ability, firmness, and will power.      PERSEVERANCE.    Those who put their minds on their work, whatever kind that may be,  and persist in its thorough execution; who get interested in something  for their own advancement, that they may become more capable as men  and women of sense and tact; such persons have a lively appreciation  of the fact that success is never more certain to be gained by any  other course.    These people have a just pride in learning the best"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14107"],[0,"The Lost Stradivarius (#8)"],[1,"circumstances it would naturally be concluded that such a label was  a forgery, but the conditions were entirely altered in the case of a  violin found in a forgotten cupboard, with proof so evident of its  having remained there for a very long period.    He was not at that time as familiar with the history of the fiddles of  the great maker as he, and indeed I also, afterwards became. Thus he  was unable to decide how far the exact year of its manufacture would  determine its value as compared with other specimens of Stradivarius.  But although the Pressenda he had been used to play on was always  considered a very fine instrument both in make and varnish, his new  discovery so far excelled it in both points as to assure him that it  must be one of the Cremonese master's greatest productions.    He examined the violin minutely, scrutinising each separate feature,  and finding each in turn to be of the utmost perfection, so far as his  knowledge of the instrument would enable him to judge. He lit more  candles that he might be able better to see it, and holding it on his  knees, sat still admiring it until the dying fire and increasing cold  warned him that the night was now far advanced. At last, carrying it to  his bedroom, he locked it carefully into a drawer and retired for the  night.    He woke next morning with that pleasurable consciousness of there  being some reason for gladness, which we feel on waking in seasons of  happiness, even before our reason, locating it, reminds us what the  actual source of our joy may be. He was at first afraid lest his  excitement, working on the imagination, should have led him on the  previous night to overestimate the fineness of the instrument, and he  took it from the drawer half expecting to be disappointed with its  daylight appearance. But a glance sufficed to convince him of the  unfounded nature of his suspicions. The various beauties which he had  before observed were enhanced a hundredfold by the light of day, and he  realised more fully than ever that the instrument was one of altogether  exceptional value.    And now, my dear Edward, I shall ask your forgiveness if in the history  I have to relate any observation of mine should seem to reflect on the  character of your late father, Sir John Maltravers. And I beg you to  consider that your father was also my dear and only brother, and that it  is inexpressibly painful to me to recount any actions of his which may  not seem becoming to a noble gentleman, as he surely was. I only now  proceed because, when very near his end, he most strictly enjoined me to  narrate these circumstances to you fully when you should come of age.  We must humbly remember that to God alone belongs judgment, and that  it is not for poor mortals to decide what is right or wrong in certain  instances for their fellows, but that each should strive most earnestly  to do his own duty.    Your father entirely concealed from me the discovery he had made. It  was not till long afterwards that I had it narrated to me, and I only  obtained a knowledge of this and many other of the facts which I am now  telling you at a date much subsequent to their actual occurrence.    He explained to his servant that he had discovered and opened an old  cupboard in the panelling, without mentioning the fact of his having  found anything in it, but merely asking him to give instructions for the  paint to be mended and the cupboard put into a usable state. Before he  had finished a very late breakfast Mr. Gaskell was with him, and it has  been a source of lasting regret to me that my brother concealed also  from his most intimate and trusted friend the discovery of the previous  night. He did, indeed, tell him that he had found and opened an old  cupboard in the panelling, but made no mention of there having been  anything within. I cannot say what prompted him to this action; for the  two young men had for long been on such intimate terms that the one  shared almost as a matter of course with the other any pleasure or pain  which might fall to his lot. Mr. Gaskell looked at the cupboard with  some interest, saying afterwards, \"I know now, Johnnie, why the one  shelf of the bookcase which stood there was made movable when all the  others were fixed. Some former occupant used the cupboard, no doubt,  as a secret receptacle for his treasures, and masked it with the  book-shelves in front. Who knows what he kept in here, or who he was! I  should not be surprised if he were that very man who used to come here  so often to hear us play the 'Areopagita,' and whom you saw that night  last June. He had the one shelf made, you see, to move so as to give him  access to this cavity on occasion: then when he left Oxford, or perhaps  died, the mystery was forgotten, and with a few times of painting the  cracks closed up.\"    Mr. Gaskell shortly afterwards took his leave as he had a lecture  to attend, and my brother was left alone to the contemplation of his  new-found treasure. After some consideration he determined that he would  take the instrument to London, and obtain the opinion of an expert as  to its authenticity and value. He was well acquainted with the late Mr.  George Smart, the celebrated London dealer, from whom his guardian, Mr.  Thoresby, had purchased the Pressenda violin which John commonly used.  Besides being a dealer in valuable instruments, Mr. Smart was a famous  collector of Stradivarius fiddles, esteemed one of the first authorities  in Europe in that domain of art, and author of a valuable work of  reference in connection with it. It was to him, therefore, that my  brother decided to submit the violin, and he wrote a letter to Mr. Smart  saying that he should give himself the pleasure of waiting on him the  next day on a matter of business. He then called on his tutor, and with  some excuse obtained leave to journey to London the next morning. He  spent the rest of the day in very carefully cleaning the violin, and  noon of the next saw him with it, securely packed, in Mr. Smart's  establishment in Bond Street.    Mr. Smart received Sir John Maltravers with deference, demanded in what  way he could serve him; and on hearing that his opinion was required on  the authenticity of a violin, smiled somewhat dubiously and led the way  into a back parlour.    \"My dear Sir John,\" he said, \"I hope you have not been led into buying  any instrument by a faith in its antiquity. So many good copies of  instruments by famous makers and bearing their labels are now afloat,  that the chances of obtaining a genuine fiddle from an unrecognised  source are quite remote; of hundreds of violins submitted to me for  opinion, I find that scarce one in fifty is actually that which it  represents itself to be. In fact the only safe rule,\" he added as a  professional commentary, \"is never to buy a violin unless you obtain it  from a dealer with a reputation to lose, and are prepared to pay a  reasonable price for it.\"    My brother had meanwhile unpacked the violin and laid it on the table.  As he took from it the last leaf of silver paper he saw Mr. Smart's  smile of condescension fade, and assuming a look of interest and  excitement, he stepped forward, took the violin in his hands, and  scrutinised it minutely. He turned it over in silence for some moments,  looking narrowly at each feature, and even applying the test of a  magnifying-glass. At last he said with an altered tone, \"Sir John, I  have had in my hands nearly all the finest productions of Stradivarius,  and thought myself acquainted with every instrument of note that ever  left his workshop; but I confess myself mistaken, and apologise to you  for the doubt which I expressed as to the instrument you had brought me.  This violin is of the great master's golden period, is incontestably  genuine, and finer in some respects than any Stradivarius that I have  ever seen, not even excepting the famous _Dolphin_ itself. You need be  under no apprehension as to its authenticity: no connoisseur could hold  it in his hand for a second and entertain a doubt on the point.\"    My brother was greatly pleased at so favourable a verdict, and Mr. Smart  continued--    \"The varnish is of that rich red which Stradivarius used in his best  period after he had abandoned the yellow tint copied by him at first  from his master Amati. I have never seen a varnish thicker or more  lustrous, and it shows on the back that peculiar shading to imitate wear  which we term 'breaking up.' The purfling also is of an unsurpassable  excellence. Its execution is so fine that I should recommend you to use  a magnifying-glass for its examination.\"    So he ran on, finding from moment to moment some new beauties to  admire.    My brother was at first anxious lest Mr. Smart should ask him whence so  extraordinary an instrument came, but he saw that the expert had already  jumped to a conclusion in the matter. He knew that John had recently  come of age, and evidently supposed that he had found the violin among  the heirlooms of Worth Maltravers. John allowed Mr. Smart to continue in  this misconception, merely saying that he had discovered the instrument  in an old cupboard, where he had reason to think it had remained hidden  for many years.    \"Are there no records attached to so splendid an instrument?\" asked Mr.  Smart. \"I suppose it has been with your family a number of years. Do you  not know how it came into their possession?\"    I believe this was the first occasion on which it had occurred to John  to consider what right he had to the possession of the instrument. He  had been so excited by its discovery that the question of ownership had  never hitherto crossed his mind. The unwelcome suggestion that it was  not his after all, that the College might rightfully prefer a claim to  it, presented itself to him for a moment; but he set it instantly aside,  quieting his conscience with the reflection that this at least was not  the"]]]
