I kept on asking, and waited and waited, hoping from  day to day to get permission to return.    Instead of that came an order that every private ambulance and hospital  in Brussels was to be closed at once, and that no wounded at all were to  be nursed by the English Sisters. The doctor and several of the Sisters  belonging to the Red Cross unit were imprisoned for twenty-four hours  under suspicion of being spies. Things could not go on like this much  longer. What I wanted to do was to send all my nurses back to England if  it could be arranged, and return myself to my work at M. till it was  finished. We were certainly not wanted in Brussels. The morning that the  edict to close the hospitals had been issued, I saw about 200 German Red  Cross Sisters arriving at the Gare du Nord.    I am a member of the International Council of Nurses, and our last big  congress was held in Germany. I thus became acquainted with a good many  of the German Sisters, and wondered what the etiquette would be if I  should meet some of them now in Brussels. But I never saw any I knew.    After the Red Cross doctor with his Sisters had been released, he went  to the German authorities and asked in the name of us all what they  proposed doing with us. As they would no longer allow us to follow our  profession, we could not remain in Brussels. The answer was rather  surprising as they said they intended sending the whole lot of us to  Liege. That was not pleasant news. Liege was rather uncomfortably near  Germany, and as we were not being sent to work there it sounded  remarkably like being imprisoned. Every one who could exerted themselves  on our behalf; the American Consul in particular went over and over  again to vainly try to get the commandant to change his mind. We were to  start on Monday morning, and on Sunday at midday the order still stood.  But at four o'clock that afternoon we got a message to say that our  gracious masters had changed our sentence, and that we were to go to  England when it suited their pleasure to send us. But this did not suit  _my_ pleasure at all. Twenty-six nurses had been entrusted to my care by  the St. John's Committee, four were still at M., and one at Tirlemont,  and I did not mean to quit Belgian soil if I could help it, leaving five  of them behind. So I took everything very quietly, meaning to stay  behind at the last minute, and change into civilian dress, which I took  care to provide myself with.    Then began a long period of waiting. Not one of my nurses was working,  though there were a great many wounded in Brussels, and we knew that  they were short-handed. There was nothing to do but to walk about the  streets and read the new _affiches_, or proclamations, which were put up  almost every day, one side in French, the other side in German, so that  all who listed might read. They were of two kinds. One purported to give  the news, which was invariably of important German successes and  victories. The other kind were orders and instructions for the behaviour  of the inhabitants of Brussels. It was possible at that time to buy  small penny reprints of all the proclamations issued since the German  occupation. They were not sold openly as the Germans were said to forbid  their sale, but after all they could hardly punish people for reissuing  what they themselves had published. Unfortunately I afterwards lost my  little books of proclamations, but can reproduce a translation of a  characteristic one that appeared on October 5. The italics are mine.         BRUSSELS: October 5, 1914.         During the evening of September 25 the railway line and the       telegraph wires were destroyed on the line Lovenjoul-Vertryck. In       consequence of this, these two places have had to render an account       of this, and had to give hostages on the morning of September 30.       In future, the localities nearest to the place where similar acts       take place _will be punished without pity--it matters little       whether the inhabitants are guilty or not_. For this purpose       hostages have been taken from all localities near the railway line       thus menaced, and at the first attempt to destroy either the       railway line or telephone or telegraph, _the hostages will be       immediately shot_. Further, all the troops charged with the duty of       guarding the railway have been ordered _to shoot any person with a       suspicious manner_ who approaches the line or telegraph or       telephone wires.         VON DER GOLST.    And Von der Golst was recalled from Brussels later on because he was too  lenient!    There is no reparation the Germans can ever make for iniquities of this  kind--and they cannot deny these things as they have others, for they  stand condemned out of their own mouths. Their own proclamations are  quite enough evidence to judge them on.    One cannot help wondering what the German standard of right and wrong  really is, because their private acts as well as their public ones have  been so unworthy of a great nation. Some Belgian acquaintances of mine  who had a large chateau in the country told me that such stealing among  officers as took place was unheard of in any war before between  civilized countries. The men had little opportunity of doing so, but the  officers sent whole wagon-loads of things back to Germany with their  name on. My friends said naturally they expected them to take food and  wine and even a change of clothing, but in their own home the German  officers quartered there had taken the very carpets off the floor and  the chandeliers from the ceiling, and old carved cupboards that had been  in the family for generations, and sent them back to Germany. They all  begged me to make these facts public when I got back to England. Writing  letters was useless as they never got through. Other Belgian friends  told me of the theft of silver, jewellery, and even women's  undergarments.    It was not etiquette in Brussels to watch the Germans, and particularly  the officers. One could not speak about them in public, spies were  everywhere, and one would be arrested at once at the first indiscreet  word--but no one could be forced to look at them--and the habit was to  ignore them altogether, to avert one's head, or shut one's eyes, or in  extreme cases to turn one's back on them, and this hurt their feelings  more than anything else could do. They _could_ not believe apparently  that Belgian women did not enjoy the sight of a beautiful officer in  full dress--as much as German women would do.    All English papers were very strictly forbidden, but a few got in  nevertheless by runners from Ostend. At the beginning of the German  occupation the _Times_ could be obtained for a franc. Later it rose to 3  francs then 5, then 9, then 15 francs. Then with a sudden leap it  reached 23 francs on one day. That was the high-water mark, for it came  down after that. The _Times_ was too expensive for the likes of me. I  used to content myself with the _Flandres Liberale_, a half-penny paper  published then in Ghent and sold in Brussels for a franc or more  according to the difficulty in getting it in. These papers used to be  wrapped up very tight and small and smuggled into Brussels in a basket  of fruit or a cart full of dirty washing. They could not of course be  bought in the shops, and the Germans kept a very keen look-out for them.  We used to get them nevertheless almost every day in spite of them.    The mode of procedure was this: When it was getting dusk you sauntered  out to take a turn in the fresh air. You strolled through a certain  square where there were men selling picture post-cards, etc. You  selected a likely looking man and went up and looked over his cards,  saying under your breath \"_Journal Anglais?_\" or \"_Flandres Liberale?_\"  which ever it happened to be. Generally you were right, but occasionally  the man looked at you with a blank stare and you knew you had made a bad  shot, and if perchance he had happened to be a spy, your lot would not  have been a happy one. But usually you received a whispered \"Oui,  madame,\" in reply, and then you loudly asked the way to somewhere, and  the man would conduct you up a side street, pointing the way with his  finger. When no one was looking he slipped a tiny folded parcel into  your hand, you slipped a coin into his, and the ceremony was over. But  it was not safe to read your treasure at a front window or anywhere  where you might be overlooked.    Sometimes these newspaper-sellers grew bold and transacted this business  too openly and then there was trouble. One evening some of the nurses  were at Benediction at the Carmelite Church, when a wretched newspaper  lad rushed into the church and hid himself in a Confessional. He was  followed by four or five German soldiers. They stopped the service and  forbade any of the congregation to leave, and searched the church till  they found the white and trembling boy, and dragged him off to his fate.  We heard afterwards that a German spy had come up and asked him in  French if he had a paper, and the boy was probably new at the game and  fell into the trap.    About this time the Germans were particularly busy in Brussels. A great  many new troops were brought in, amongst them several Austrian regiments  and a great many naval officers and men. It was quite plain that some  big undertaking was planned. Then one day we saw the famous heavy guns  going out of the city along the Antwerp road. I had heard them last at  Maubeuge, now I was to hear them again. Night and day reinforcements of  soldiers poured into Brussels at the Gare du Nord, and poured out at the  Antwerp Gate. No one whatever was permitted to pass to leave the city,  the trams were all stopped at the barriers, and aeroplanes were  constantly hovering above the city like huge birds of prey.

(#8)"],[1,"to swell the size of a  dictionary, and boast of having found out and defined thousands of words  more than any body else. A mania seems to have seized our  lexicographers, so that they have forsaken the good old style of  \"plainness of speech,\" and are flourishing and brandishing about in a  cloud of verbiage as though the whole end of instruction was to teach  loquacity. And some of our popular writers and speakers have caught the  infection, and flourish in borrowed garments, prizing themselves most  highly when they use words and phrases which no body can understand.    I will not contend that in the advancement of the arts and sciences it  may not be proper to introduce foreign terms as the mean of conveying a  knowledge of those improvements to others. It is better than to coin new  words, inasmuch as they are generally adopted by all modern nations. In  this way all languages are approximating together; and when the light of  truth, science, and religion, has fully shone on all the nations, we may  hope one language will be spoken, and the promise be fulfilled, that God  has \"turned unto the people a pure language, that they may call upon the  name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent.\"    New ideas are formed like new inventions. Established principles are  employed in a new combination, so as to produce a new manifestation.  Words are chosen as nearly allied to former ideas as possible, to  express or represent this new combination. Thus, Fulton applied steam  power to navigation. A new idea was produced. A boat was seen passing  along the waters without the aid of wind or tide. Instead of coining a  new word to express the whole, a word which nobody would understand, two  old ones were combined, and \"_steamboat_\" became the sign to represent  the idea of the thing beheld. So with rail-road, cotton-mill, and  gun-powder. In the same way we may account for most words employed in  science, although in that case we are more dependant on foreign  languages, in as much as a large portion of our knowledge is derived  from them. But we may account for them on the same principle as above.  _Phrenology_ is a compound of two greek words, and means the science or  knowledge of the mind. So of geology, mineralogy, &c. But when  improvements are made by those who speak the english, words in our own  language are employed and used not only by ourselves, but also by those  nations who profit by our investigations.    I trust I have now said enough on the general principles of language as  applied to things. In the next lecture I will come down to a sort of  bird's eye view of grammar. But my soul abhors arbitrary rules so  devoutly, I can make no promises how long I will continue in close  communion with set forms of speech. I love to wander too well to remain  confined to one spot, narrowed up in the limits fixed by others. Freedom  is the empire of the mind; it abjures all fetters, all slavery. It  kneels at the altar of virtue and worships at the shrine of truth. No  obstacles should be thrown in the way of its progress. No limits should  be set to it but those of the Almighty.          LECTURE IV.    ON NOUNS.        Nouns defined.--Things.--Qualities of matter.--Mind.--Spiritual      beings.--Qualities of mind.--How learned.--Imaginary things.--      Negation.--Names of actions.--Proper nouns.--Characteristic      names.--Proper nouns may become common.      Your attention is, this evening, invited to the first divisions of  words, called _Nouns_. This is a most important class, and as such  deserves our particular notice.        _Nouns are the names of things._    The word _noun_ is derived from the Latin _nomen_, French _nom_. It  means _name_. Hence the definition above given.    In grammar it is employed to distinguish that class of words which name  things, or stand as signs or representatives of things.    We use the word _thing_ in its broadest sense, including every possible  entity; every being, or thing, animate or inanimate, material or  immaterial, real or imaginary, physical, moral, or intellectual. It is  the noun of the Saxon _thincan_ or _thingian_, to think; and is used to  express every conceivable object of thought, in whatever form or manner  presented to the human mind.    Every word employed to designate things, or name them, is to be ranked  in the class called _nouns_, or names. You have only to determine  whether a word is used thus, to learn whether it belongs to this or  some other class of words. Here let me repeat:        1. Things exist.      2. We conceive ideas of things.      3. We use sounds or signs to communicate these ideas to others.      4. We denominate the class of words thus used, _nouns_.    Perhaps I ought to stop here, or pass to another topic. But as these  lectures are intended to be so plain that all can understand my meaning,  I must indulge in a few more remarks before advancing farther.    In addition to individual, tangible objects, we conceive ideas of the  _qualities_ of things, and give _names_ to such qualities, which become  _nouns_. Thus, the _hardness_ of iron, the _heat_ of fire, the _color_  of a rose, the _bitterness_ of gall, the _error_ of grammars. The  following may serve to make my views more plain. Take two tumblers, the  one half filled with water, the other with milk; mix them together. You  can now talk of the milk in the water, or the water in the milk. Your  ideas are distinct, tho the objects are so intimately blended, that they  can not be separated. So with the qualities of things.    We also speak of mind, intellect, soul; but to them we can give no form,  and of them paint no likeness. Yet we have ideas of them, and employ  words to express them, which become _nouns_.    This accounts for the reason why the great Parent Intellect has strictly  forbidden, in the decalogue, that a likeness of him should be  constructed. His being and attributes are discoverable only thro the  medium of his works and word. No man can see him and live. It would be  the height of folly--it would be more--it would be blasphemy--to  attempt to paint the likeness of him whose presence fills  immensity--whose center is every where, and whose circumference is no  where. The name of this Spirit or Being was held in the most profound  reverence by the Jews, as we shall have occasion to mention when we come  to treat of the verb =to be=.    We talk of angels, and have seen the unhallowed attempt to describe  their likeness in the form of pictures, which display the fancy of the  artist very finely, but give a miserable idea of those pure spirits who  minister at the altar of God, and chant his praises in notes of the most  unspeakable delight.    We have also seen _death_ and the pale horse, the firy dragon, the  mystery of Babylon, and such like things, represented on canvass; but  they betoken more of human talent to depict the marvellous, than a  strict regard for truth. Beelzebub, imps, and all Pandemonium, may be  vividly imagined and finely arranged in fiction, and we can name them.  Wizzards, witches, and fairies, may play their sportive tricks in the  human brain, and receive names as tho they were real.    We also think and speak of the qualities and affections of the mind as  well as matter, as wisdom, knowledge, virtue, vice, love, hatred, anger.  Our conceptions in this case may be less distinct, but we have ideas,  and use words to express them. There is, we confess, a greater liability  to mistake and misunderstand when treating of mind and its qualities,  than of matter. The reason is evident, people know less of it. Its  operations are less distinct and more varying.    The child first sees material objects. It is taught to name them. It  next learns the qualities of things; as the sweetness of sugar, the  darkness of night, the beauty of flowers. From this it ascends by  gradation to the higher attainments of knowledge as revealed in the  empire of mind, as well as matter. Great care should be taken that this  advancement be easy, natural, and thoro. It should be constantly  impressed with the importance of obtaining clear and definite ideas of  things, and never employ words till it has ideas to express; never name  a thing of which it has no knowledge. This is ignorance.    It would be well, perhaps, to extend this remark to those older than  children, in years, but less in real practical knowledge. The remark is  of such general application, that no specification need be made, except  to the case before us; to those affected proficients in grammar, whose  only knowledge is the memory of words, which to them have no meanings,  if, indeed, the writers themselves had any to express by them; a fact we  regard as questionable, at best. There is hardly a teacher of grammar,  whose self-esteem is not enormous, who will not confess himself ignorant  on many of the important principles of language; that he has never  understood, and could never explain them. He finds no difficulty in  repeating what the books say, but if called upon to express an opinion  of his own, he has none to give. He has learned and used words without  knowing their meaning.    Children should be taught language as they are taught music. They should  learn the simple tones on which the whole science depends. Distinct  impressions of sounds should be made on their minds, and the characters  which represent them should be inseparably associated with them. They  will then learn tunes from the compositions of those sounds, as  represented by notes. By dint of application, they will soon become  familiar with these principles, if possessed of a talent for song, and  may soon pass the acme with ease, accuracy, and rapidity. But there are  those who may sing very prettily, and tolerably correct, who have never  studied the first rudiments of music. But such can never become adepts  in the science.    So there are those who use language correctly, who never saw the inside  of "]]]
