That is  why, if Baby  cannot have    breast milk,  he _must_ have  Glaxo, which  is milk enriched  with extra    cream made  pure and easily digestible.  It costs you but  a trifle more    than  ordinary milk,  and  is  not only  the  one  safe alternative  for    breast-milk, but  is also more  economical than  foods which have  to be    mixed with  milk to make them  nourishing. Glaxo can be  given either in    turn with breast-milk or as the sole food from birth.          Breast  milk  does  not  contain    and   purity   are   permanently        Starch,  Flour,   Malt  or  Cane    retained  by the  Glaxo Process,        Sugar,  _neither   does  Glaxo_.    which dries  the milk  and cream        Glaxo  is  entirely pure,  fresh    to  a  powder  and  also  causes        milk, enriched  with extra cream    the nourishing curd  of the milk        and  milk-sugar.

But the Cigale is far from sharing in such emotions. It  has excellent sight. Its great faceted eyes inform it of all that  happens to right and left; its three stemmata, like little ruby  telescopes, explore the sky above its head. If it sees us coming it is  silent at once, and flies away. But let us get behind the branch on  which it is singing; let us manoeuvre so as to avoid the five centres  of vision, and then let us speak, whistle, clap the hands, beat two  stones together. For far less a bird which could not see you would stop  its song and fly away terrified. The Cigale imperturbably continues to  sing as if nothing had occurred.    Of my experiences of this kind I will mention only one, the most  remarkable of many.    I borrowed the municipal artillery; that is, the iron boxes which are  charged with gunpowder on the day of the patron saint. The artilleryman  was delighted to load them for the benefit of the Cigales, and to fire  them off for me before my house. There were two of these boxes stuffed  full of powder as though for the most solemn rejoicing. Never was  politician making his electoral progress favoured with a bigger charge.  To prevent damage to my windows the sashes were all left open. The two  engines of detonation were placed at the foot of the plane-trees before  my door, no precautions being taken to mask them. The Cigales singing in  the branches above could not see what was happening below.    There were six of us, spectators and auditors. We waited for a moment of  relative quiet. The number of singers was counted by each of us, as well  as the volume and rhythm of the song. We stood ready, our ears attentive  to the aerial orchestra. The box exploded with a clap of thunder.    No disturbance ensued above. The number of performers was the same, the  rhythm the same, the volume the same. The six witnesses were unanimous:  the loud explosion had not modified the song of the Cigales in the  least. The second box gave an identical result.    What are we to conclude from this persistence of the orchestra, its lack  of surprise or alarm at the firing of a charge? Shall we conclude that  the Cigale is deaf? I am not going to venture so far as that; but if any  one bolder than myself were to make the assertion I really do not know  what reasons I could invoke to disprove it. I should at least be forced  to admit that it is very hard of hearing, and that we may well apply to  it the homely and familiar phrase: to shout like a deaf man.    When the blue-winged cricket, basking on the pebbles of some country  footpath, grows deliciously intoxicated with the heat of the sun and  rubs its great posterior thighs against the roughened edge of its  wing-covers; when the green tree-frog swells its throat in the foliage  of the bushes, distending it to form a resonant cavity when the rain is  imminent, is it calling to its absent mate? By no means. The efforts of  the former produce a scarcely perceptible stridulation; the palpitating  throat of the latter is as ineffectual; and the desired one does not  come.    Does the insect really require to emit these resounding effusions, these  vociferous avowals, in order to declare its passion? Consult the immense  majority whom the conjunction of the sexes leaves silent. In the violin  of the grasshopper, the bagpipe of the tree-frog, and the cymbals of the  _Cacan_ I see only their peculiar means of expressing the joy of living,  the universal joy which every species of animal expresses after its  kind.    If you were to tell me that the Cigales play on their noisy instruments  careless of the sound produced, and merely for the pleasure of feeling  themselves alive, just as we rub our hands in a moment of satisfaction,  I should not be particularly shocked. That there is a secondary object  in their conceit, in which the silent sex is interested, is very  possible and very natural, but it is not as yet proven.[1]          CHAPTER IV    THE CIGALE. THE EGGS AND THEIR HATCHING      The Cigale confides its eggs to dry, slender twigs. All the branches  examined by Reaumur which bore such eggs were branches of the mulberry:  a proof that the person entrusted with the search for these eggs in the  neighbourhood of Avignon did not bring much variety to his quest. I find  these eggs not only on the mulberry-tree, but on the peach, the cherry,  the willow, the Japanese privet, and other trees. But these are  exceptions; what the Cigale really prefers is a slender twig of a  thickness varying from that of a straw to that of a pencil. It should  have a thin woody layer and plenty of pith. If these conditions are  fulfilled the species matters little. I should pass in review all the  semi-ligneous plants of the country were I to catalogue the various  supports which are utilised by the gravid female.    Its chosen twig never lies along the ground; it is always in a more or  less vertical position. It is usually growing in its natural position,  but is sometimes detached; in the latter case it will by chance have  fallen so that it retains its upright position. The insect prefers a  long, smooth, regular twig which can receive the whole of its eggs. The  best batches of eggs which I have found have been laid upon twigs of  the _Spartium junceum_, which are like straws stuffed with pith, and  especially on the upper twigs of the _Asphodelus cerasiferus_, which  rises nearly a yard from the ground before ramifying.    It is essential that the support, no matter what its nature, should be  dead and perfectly dry.    The first operation performed by the Cigale consists in making a series  of slight lacerations, such as one might make with the point of a pin,  which, if plunged obliquely downwards into the twig, would tear the  woody fibres and would compress them so as to form a slight  protuberance.    If the twig is irregular in shape, or if several Cigales have been  working successively at the same point, the distribution of the  punctures is confused; the eye wanders, incapable of recognising the  order of their succession or the work of the individual. One  characteristic is always present, namely, the oblique direction of the  woody fragment which is raised by the perforation, showing that the  Cigale always works in an upright position and plunges its rostrum  downwards in the direction of the twig.    If the twig is regular, smooth, and conveniently long the perforations  are almost equidistant and lie very nearly in a straight line. Their  number varies; it is small when the mother, disturbed in her operations,  has flown away to continue her work elsewhere; but they number thirty or  forty, more or less, when they contain the whole of her eggs.    Each one of the perforations is the entrance to an oblique tunnel, which  is bored in the medullary sheath of the twig. The aperture is not  closed, except by the bunch of woody fibres, which, parted at the moment  when the eggs are laid, recover themselves when the double saw of the  oviduct is removed. Sometimes, but by no means always, you may see  between the fibres a tiny glistening patch like a touch of dried white  of egg. This is only an insignificant trace of some albuminous secretion  accompanying the egg or facilitating the work of the double saw of the  oviduct.    Immediately below the aperture of the perforation is the egg chamber: a  short, tunnel-shaped cavity which occupies almost the whole distance  between one opening and that lying below it. Sometimes the separating  partition is lacking, and the various chambers run into one another, so  that the eggs, although introduced by the various apertures, are  arranged in an uninterrupted row. This arrangement, however, is not the  most usual.    The contents of the chambers vary greatly. I find in each from six to  fifteen eggs. The average is ten. The total number of chambers varying  from thirty to forty, it follows that the Cigale lays from three to four  hundred eggs. Reaumur arrived at the same figures from an examination of  the ovaries.    This is truly a fine family, capable by sheer force of numbers of  surviving the most serious dangers. I do not see that the adult Cigale  is exposed to greater dangers than any other insect: its eye is  vigilant, its departure sudden, and its flight rapid; and it inhabits  heights at which the prowling brigands of the turf are not to be feared.  The sparrow, it is true, will greedily devour it. From time to time he  will deliberately and meditatively descend upon the plane-trees from the  neighbouring roof and snatch up the singer, who squeaks despairingly. A  few blows of the beak and the Cigale is cut into quarters, delicious  morsels for the nestlings. But how often does the bird return without  his prey! The Cigale, foreseeing his attack, empties its intestine in  the eyes of its assailant and flies away.    But the Cigale has a far more terrible enemy than the sparrow. This is  the green grasshopper. It is late, and the Cigales are silent. Drowsy  with light and heat, they have exhausted themselves in producing their  symphonies all day long. Night has come, and with it repose; but a  repose frequently troubled. In the thick foliage of the plane-trees  there is a sudden sound like a cry of anguish, short and strident. It is  the despairing lamentation of the Cigale surprised in the silence by the  grasshopper, that ardent hunter of the night, which leaps upon the  Cigale, seizes it by the flank, tears it open, and devours the contents  of the stomach. After the orgy of music comes night and assassination.    I obtained an insight into this tragedy in the following manner: I was  walking up and down before my door at daybreak when something fell from  the neighbouring plane-tree uttering shrill squeaks. I ran to see what  it was. I found a green grasshopper eviscerating a struggling Cigale. In  vain did the latter squeak and gesticulate; the other never loosed its  hold, but plunged its"]]]
