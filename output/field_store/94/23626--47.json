BESSIE AND THE BUNYIP       Bessie met a bunyip down along the track,  In his hand a billy and a swag upon his back.        And you will hardly believe it, but when Bessie shouted,\"Shoo!\"        He turned a double somersault and went quite blue.        GOOD ENOUGH    I do not think there ever was,     Or ever will, or ever could be,  A little girl or little boy     As good as she or as he should be.    But still, I think, you will agree,     Though perfect very, very few are,  They're not so bad when \"pretty good\"--     That's just about as good as you are.        THE PORTER    I'd like to be a porter, and always on the run,  Calling out, \"Stand aside!\" and asking leave of none.  Shoving trucks on people's toes, and having splendid fun,  Slamming all the carriage doors and locking every one--  And, when they asked to be let in, I'd say, \"It can't be done.\"     But I wouldn't be a porter if . . .         The luggage weighed a ton.           Would you?        GROWING UP    Little Tommy Tadpole began to weep and wail,  For little Tommy Tadpole had lost his little tail;     And his mother didn't know him as he wept upon a log,     For he wasn't Tommy Tadpole, but Mr. Thomas Frog.        THE UNSOCIABLE WALLABY    Willie spied a wallaby hopping through the fern--  Here a jump, here a thump, there a sudden turn.     Willie called the wallaby, begging him to stop,     But he went among the wattles with a                             flip,                                     flap,                                              flop!        * * *    I wonder whether, all together, you and I and father  Could eat a bun that weighs a ton. I'd like to try it, rather.    I want to know why roosters crow at dawning of the day.  Is it because they cannot think of something else to say?    * * *        THE SONG OF THE SULKY STOCKMAN    Come, let us sing with a right good ring     (Sing hey for lifting lay, sing hey!)  Of any old, sunny old, silly old thing.     (Sing ho for the ballad of a backblock day!)  The sun shone brightly overhead,  And the shearers stood by the shearing shed;  But \"The run wants rain,\" the stockman said  (Sing di-dum, wattle-gum, Narrabori Ned.  For a lifting lay sing hey!)    The colts were clipped and the sheep were shorn     (Sing hey for a lilting lay, sing hey!)  But the stockman stood there all forlorn.     (Sing ho for the ballad of a backblock day!)  The rails were up and the gate was tied,  And the big black bull was safe inside;  But \"The wind's gone West!\" the stockman sighed  (Sing, di-dum, wattle-gum, rally for a ride.     For a lifting lay sing hey!)    The cook came out as the clock struck one     (Sing hey for a lilting lay, sing hey!)  And the boundary rider got his gun.     (Sing ho for the ballad of a backblock day!)  He fired it once at an old black crow;  But the shot went wide, for he aimed too low;  And the stockman said, \"Fat stock is low.\"  (Sing, di-dum, wattle-gum, Jerridiiii Joe.     For a lifting lay sing hey!)    They spread their swags in the gum-tree's shade     (Sing hey for a lilting lay, sing hey!)  For the work was done and the cheques were paid.     (Sing ho for the ballad of a backblock day!)  The overseer rode in at three,  But his horse pulled back and would not gee,  And the stockman said, \"We're up a tree!\"  (Sing, di-dum, wattle-gum, Johnny-cake for tea.     For a lilting lay sing hey!)    The sun sank down and the stars shone out     (Sing hey for a lifting lay, sing hey!)  And the old book-keeper moped about.     (Sing ho for the ballad of a backblock day!)  The dingo wailed to the mopoke's call,  The crazy colt stamped in his stall;  But the stockman groaned, \"it's bunk for all.\"  (Sing, di-dum, wattle-gum, wattle-gum, wattle-gum,     Hey for a backblock day!          Sing hey!     Sing hey for a lifting lay!)        OUR COW    Down by the sliprails stands our cow     Chewing, chewing, chewing,  She does not care what folks out there     In the great, big world are doing.  She sees the small cloud-shadows pass     And green grass shining under.  If she does think, what does she think     About it all, I wonder?    She sees the swallows skimming by     Above the sweet young clover,  The light reeds swaying in the wind     And tall trees bending over.  Far down the track she hears the crack     of bullock-whips, and raving  Of angry men where, in the sun,     Her fellow-beasts are slaving.    Girls, we are told, can scratch and scold,     And boys will fight and wrangle,  And big, grown men, just now and then,     Fret o'er some fingle-fangle,  Vexing the earth with grief or mirth,     Longing, rejoicing, rueing--  But by the sliprails stands our cow,     Chewing.        THE TEACHER    I'd like to be a teacher, and have a clever brain,  Calling out, \"Attention, please!\" and \"Must I speak in vain?\"  I'd be quite strict with boys and girls whose minds I had to train,  And all the books and maps and things I'd carefully explain;  I'd make then learn the dates of kings, and all the capes of Spain;     But I wouldn't be a teacher if . . .         I couldn't use the cane.           Would you?        THE SPOTTED HEIFERS    Mr Jeremiah Jeffers  Owned a pair of spotted heifers  These he sold for two pounds ten  To Mr Robert Raymond Wren    Who reared them in the lucerne paddocks  Owned by Mr Martin Maddox,  And sold them, when they grew to cows,  To Mr Donald David Dowse.    A grazier, Mr Egbert Innes,  Bought them then for twenty guineas,  Milked the cows, and sold the milk  To Mr Stephen Evan Silk.    Who rents a butter factory  From Mr Laurence Lampard-Lee.  Here, once a week, come for his butter  The grocer, Mr Roland Rutter,    Who keeps a shop in Sunny Street  Next door to Mr Peter Peat.  He every afternoon at two  Sent his fair daughter, Lucy Loo,    To Mr Rutter's shop to buy  Such things as were not priced too high,  Especially a shilling tin  Of \"Fuller's Food for Folk Too Thin.\"    This food was bought for Lucy Loo--  A girl of charming manners, who  Was much too pale and much too slight  To be a very pleasant sight.    When Lucy Loo beheld the butter  Stocked by Mr Roland Rutter,  She said, \"I'll have a pound of that.\"  She had it, and thenceforth grew fat.    We now go back to Mr Jeffers,  Who sold the pair of spotted heifers.  He had a son, James Edgar John,  A handsome lad to gaze upon,    Who had now reached that time of life  When young men feel they need a wife;  But no young girl about the place  Exactly had the kind of face    That seemed to suit James Edgar John--  A saddening thing to think upon,  For he grew sad and sick of life  Because he could not find a wife.    One day young James was passing by  (A look of sorrow in his eye)  The shop of Mr Roland Rutter,  When Lucy Loo came out with butter.    At once James Edgar John said, \"That  Is just the girl for me!  She's fat.\"  He offered her his heart and hand  And prospects of his father's land.    The Reverend Saul Sylvester Slight  Performed the simple marriage rite.  The happy couple went their way,  And lived and loved unto this day.    Events cannot be far foreseen;  And all ths joy might not have been  If Mr Jeremiah Jeffers  Had kept his pair of spotted heifers.        TEA TALK    'Excuse me if I sit on you,' the cup said to the saucer.     'I fear I've been here all the afternoon.'  'Spare excuses,' said the saucer; 'you have sat on me before, sir.'     'Oh, I'll stir him up directly,' said the spoon.  'Stop your clatter!  Stop your clatter!' cried the bread-and-butter platter     'Tittle-tattle!' sneered the tea-pot, with a shrug;  'Now, the most important question is my chronic indigestion.'     'Ah, you've taken too much tannin,' jeered the jug.  'Hey, hey, hey!' sang the silver-plated tray,  'It's time you had your faces washed.  I've come to clear away!'        THE LOOKING-GLASS    When I look into the looking glass     I'm always sure to see--  No matter how I dodge about--     Me, looking out at me.    I often wonder as I look,     And those strange features spy,  If I, in there, think I'm as plain     As I, out here, think I.        WOOLLOOMOOLOO    Here's a ridiculous riddle for you:     How many o's are there in Woolloomooloo?  Two for the W, two for the m,    Four for the l's, and that's plenty for them.        * * *    I wonder what the Jacks have got to laugh and laugh about  I'm sure the worms don't see the joke when Jacky digs them out.    I wonder which is best: a rich plum-pudding stuffed with plums,  Or lemon ice, or plain boiled rice, or long-division sums.    * * *        THE BARBER    I'd like to be a barber, and learn to shave and clip,  Calling out, \"Next please!\" and pocketing my tip.  All day I'd hear my scissors going, \"Snip, Snip, Snip;\"  I'd lather people's faces, and their noses I would grip  While I shaved most carefully along the upper lip.     But I wouldn't be a barber if . . .         The razor was to slip.           Would you?        FARMER JACK    Old farmer Jack gazed on his wheat,     And feared the frost would nip it.  Said he, \"it's nearly seven feet--     I must begin to strip it.\"    He stripped it with a stripper and     He bagged it with a bagger;  The bags were all so lumpy that     They made the lumper stagger.    The lumper staggered up the stack     Where he was told to stack it;  And Jack was paid and put the cash     Inside his linen jacket.        OLD BLACK JACKO    Old Black Jacko     Smokes tobacco     In his little pipe of clay.  Puff, puff, puff,  He never has enough     Though he smokes it all day.    But his lubra says, \"Mine tink dat Jacky  Him shmoke plenty too much baccy.\"        BIRD SONG    I detest the Carrion Crow!  (He's a raven, don't you know?)     He's a greedy glutton, also, and a ghoul,  And his sanctimonious caw  Rubs my temper on the raw.     He's a demon, and a most degraded fowl.    I admire the pert Blue-wren  And his dainty little hen--     Though she hasn't got a trace of blue upon her;  But she's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16255"],[0,"Dickey Downy: The Autobiography of a Bird (#8)"],[1,"way of thanks, then he ran off with a  whoop.    \"I saw from this action that Johnny was the same generous, kind-hearted  boy he used to be, and I felt proud to have had the honor of his  acquaintance.\"          CHAPTER VII    A WINTER IN THE SOUTH        I was wrong about the Phoebe bird;    Two songs it has, and both of them I've heard;    I did not know those strains of joy and sorrow    Came from one throat.      As the season advanced our May songs became less melodious until  finally our music was merely a metallic but pleasant, \"chink, chink,\"  and we knew we would soon be putting on our new fall attire, as toward  the close of the summer our family exchange their pretty  black-and-white suits, so much admired, for a becoming yellowish-brown  one.  The different flocks were also now arranging for their regular  winter trip to the sunny Southland, where their winters were spent.    I was very glad to know that we bobolinks were to travel only in the  daytime, as that would afford us younger ones a better opportunity to  see the country.  The return trip to the North is always made by night.  A great many people have wondered why we do this, and those who are  interested in our habits have tried to find out; but it is a secret the  birds have never yet divulged, and probably never will.    The blue jays were going to remain behind, for the winters which we  dreaded so much had no terrors for them.  Sometimes when we were  preening our feathers under the radiant skies near the Southern gulf, I  thought of our old neighbors the jays, and fancied them in their bleak  Northern home flitting about in the tops of the leafless trees, swayed  by the icy winds from the upper lakes, and with perhaps but little to  eat.  I would not have exchanged places with them for the world.  But  my older comrades assured me the jays were not in need of my sympathy  or pity.  They liked the invigorating cold and chattered merrily in the  desolate boughs and enjoyed many a nice meal from under the melting  snow.  The crimson dogwood berries, standing out like rosettes of  coral, at which they liked to peck, also furnished them an aesthetic  and sumptuous feast.  Much more to be dreaded than the winter's cold  was the cruel sportsman, said my comrades.    The day of our departure came.  The concourse of birds setting out on  their annual journeys was immense, and oh, what joy it was to soar  aloft on buoyant pinion high up in the blue sky, over housetops and  tops of trees, skimming along above rushing waters or tranquil streams  in quiet meadows.  Mere existence was a keen delight.  The sense of  freedom, of lightness, of airiness, was gloriously exhilarating, a  delicious sensation known only to the feathered tribes of all God's  creation.    Our trip took us across some densely wooded mountains, where we rested  for a time.  A thick undergrowth of young saplings prevented any roads,  and only occasional narrow footpaths showed that people sometimes  passed that way.    The mountain was grand in its loneliness; but doubtless was a desolate  spot to the settlers, whose cabins were scattered at long distances  from each other in the depths of the wood.  I could imagine how cut off  from the whole world the women and children in these cabins would feel,  for it is natural for human beings to love society.  The perpetual  stillness must have been hard to bear when months sometimes passed  away, especially in the winter season, without their getting a glimpse  of other human faces.    The mountains were full of wildcats too, which made their situation  worse, as these fierce animals were frequently known to attack men as  savagely as wolves do.  One day while we were there two travelers  camped under the tree where our family was roosting.  They had  evidently had a hard time making their way through the tangled  undergrowth, for as one of the men flung himself down on the ground and  stretched himself out at full length, he exclaimed peevishly:    \"Well, I don't want any more such experiences.  I'm dead tired; my face  is all scratched with the thorns and bushes; and I haven't seen a  newspaper for a week.  If the railroad company needs any more work of  this kind done, they must get somebody else.\"    \"Fiddle-dee-dee!  You mustn't be so easily discouraged,\" answered the  other young man, who had already set to work scraping up dry chips and  pieces of bark to make a fire, \"Think of these poor mountaineers who  stay here all their lives.  Your little tramp of a few days is nothing  to what they do all the time and never think of complaining.  The half  of them are too poor to own a mule.  They eat hog and hominy the year  around, and are thankful to get it.  Their clothes are fearfully and  wonderfully made, but for all that they don't give up and think life  isn't worth living.\"    As the two young fellows talked on in this strain I named them Growler  and Cheery, because the one was so determined to look on the dark side,  while the other took a cheerful view of everything.  Growler continued  to lounge on the ground, looking with careless interest at Cheery, who  was preparing dinner.    The dinner was in a small tin box which he took from his coat pocket.  Opening it he disclosed some eatables very compactly put in.  He took  out several articles and set them on the ground in front of him.  In  the box was a bottle stoutly corked containing a dark liquid, some of  which he poured into a flat tin cup which formed a part of the lid of  the box.  This he set over the fire, which by this time was snapping  cheerily.    \"Come,\" he said.  \"Here's a lunch fit for a king.  Get up and have your  share.  Maybe when your stomach is warmed up with a few ham and mustard  sandwiches, some cheese and coffee, you'll be in better spirits.  These  crackers are good eating too.\"    \"Fit for a king, eh?  Mighty poor kind of a king, I should say,\"  growled Growler sarcastically; but he rose and flicked the leaves and  twigs from his clothing before he helped himself to the coffee which  was now hot.    \"One cup for two people is just one too few,\" laughed Cheery when it  came his turn to take some.  \"My! but it tastes good.  There's nothing  like the open air to give one an appetite.\"    \"I don't like coffee without cream,\" objected Growler, chewing moodily  at his cracker.    \"Well, we'll get to Girard by to-night, and then possibly we will get a  good supper.\"    While they were lunching I had observed another traveler slowly  approaching through the underbrush.  Over one shoulder was slung a  leather strap in which were a few books.  He carried a rifle, and from  his coat pocket bulged a small package.  As he drew nearer the sound of  his footsteps startled Growler who nervously upset his coffee over his  shirt front.    \"What d'ye suppose he is?\" he asked of Cheery as the stranger  approached.    \"I judge he's a parson, from the cut of his clothes,\" observed Cheery.  Then as the new-comer advanced he called: \"Hello, friend!  Who'd 'a  thought of meeting company this far back in these mountains?\"    \"This is only about eight miles from the town where I live,\" answered  the gentleman, who now seated himself near them with his back against a  tree, \"I know the paths through here fairly well, for I come this way  several times through the summer.  But this will be my last trip for  the season, and I'm giving a little more time to it on that account.  I've taken it somewhat leisurely to-day.\"    He was a delicate-looking, middle-aged man, with a mild voice and a  kind face.    \"You're a drummer for a publishing house, I take it?\" said Growler,  nodding toward the books in the strap.  \"I've just been wondering where  you'd find any buyers in these infernal woods.\"    The gentleman laughed.  \"No,\" said he, \"this is my regular route; but  I'm not a commercial traveler in any sense.  I'm a pastor at a town  near here, and I go out to these mountain families to hold services  every few weeks.\"    \"You don't mean you foot it through these bushes and among these  wildcats to preach to the mountaineers!\" exclaimed Growler in  astonishment.    \"Certainly I do.  These poor people would never hear the sound of the  gospel if some one did not take it to them.  They have souls to be  saved, my friend.  I feel it is my duty to carry the word to them.  As  for the wildcats,\" he continued, smiling, \"I have my rifle.  Besides  the government offers a small bounty for every wildcat.\"    \"Oh, yes, I see.  You combine business with pleasure and have your  wildcat bounty to pay expenses as you go along--or else keep it for  pin-money,\" and Growler laughed good-humoredly at his own fun.    \"You're the parson from St. Thomas, I judge,\" said Cheery.    The gentleman bowed, and said he was the pastor of that little church.    \"I've heard of your mission work, and I understand you've done a great  deal of good among the mountain whites.\"    \"How many churches have you in these mountains?\" interrupted Growler.    \"I have but the one church organization, for outside through the  mountains there are no churches--no buildings, no organizations.  People ten and fifteen miles apart can't very well have churches.  I  visit the families.  I have three on this mountain side.  I am well  repaid for all the sacrifice of comfort I make, in knowing how glad  they are to have me come.   To many of them I am the connecting link  with the rest of mankind.  Ah! the world knows nothing of the  privations and sorrows and ignorance of many of these poor creatures!  Through the winter I am obliged to stop my visitations, but I generally  leave a few books and papers for those who can read, and pictures for  the children.\"    \"Well, parson, I didn't know there was enough goodness in any man in  the United States to make him willing to tramp right into the wildest  part of the Allegheny.  Mountains to preach the gospel to half a dozen  poor people!\" exclaimed Growler, still more astonished.    "]]]
