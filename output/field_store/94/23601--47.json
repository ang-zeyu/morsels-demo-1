'We are merchants,' replied the bystander (who was no other than Diomed)  in the same voice, 'who seek to know the fate of our vessels, which sail  for Alexandria to-morrow.  We are about to offer up a sacrifice and  implore an answer from the goddess.  I am not one of those who have  petitioned the priest to sacrifice, as you may see by my dress, but I  have some interest in the success of the fleet--by Jupiter! yes.  I have  a pretty trade, else how could I live in these hard times?    The Egyptian replied gravely--'That though Isis was properly the goddess  of agriculture, she was no less the patron of commerce.' Then turning  his head towards the east, Arbaces seemed absorbed in silent prayer.    And now in the centre of the steps appeared a priest robed in white from  head to foot, the veil parting over the crown; two new priests relieved  those hitherto stationed at either corner, being naked half-way down to  the breast, and covered, for the rest, in white and loose robes.  At the  same time, seated at the bottom of the steps, a priest commenced a  solemn air upon a long wind-instrument of music.  Half-way down the  steps stood another flamen, holding in one hand the votive wreath, in  the other a white wand; while, adding to the picturesque scene of that  eastern ceremony, the stately ibis (bird sacred to the Egyptian worship)  looked mutely down from the wall upon the rite, or stalked beside the  altar at the base of the steps.    At that altar now stood the sacrificial flamen.    The countenance of Arbaces seemed to lose all its rigid calm while the  aruspices inspected the entrails, and to be intent in pious anxiety--to  rejoice and brighten as the signs were declared favorable, and the fire  began bright and clearly to consume the sacred portion of the victim  amidst odorous of myrrh and frankincense.  It was then that a dead  silence fell over the whispering crowd, and the priests gathering round  the cella, another priest, naked save by a cincture round the middle,  rushed forward, and dancing with wild gestures, implored an answer from  the goddess.  He ceased at last in exhaustion, and a low murmuring noise  was heard within the body of the statue: thrice the head moved, and the  lips parted, and then a hollow voice uttered these mystic words:      There are waves like chargers that meet and glow,    There are graves ready wrought in the rocks below,    On the brow of the future the dangers lour,    But blest are your barks in the fearful hour.    The voice ceased--the crowd breathed more freely--the merchants looked  at each other.  'Nothing can be more plain,' murmured Diomed; 'there is  to be a storm at sea, as there very often is at the beginning of autumn,  but our vessels are to be saved.  O beneficent Isis!'    'Lauded eternally be the goddess!' said the merchants: 'what can be less  equivocal than her prediction?'    Raising one hand in sign of silence to the people, for the rites of Isis  enjoined what to the lively Pompeians was an impossible suspense from  the use of the vocal organs, the chief priest poured his libation on the  altar, and after a short concluding prayer the ceremony was over, and  the congregation dismissed.  Still, however, as the crowd dispersed  themselves here and there, the Egyptian lingered by the railing, and  when the space became tolerably cleared, one of the priests, approaching  it, saluted him with great appearance of friendly familiarity.    The countenance of the priest was remarkably unprepossessing--his shaven  skull was so low and narrow in the front as nearly to approach to the  conformation of that of an African savage, save only towards the  temples, where, in that organ styled acquisitiveness by the pupils of a  science modern in name, but best practically known (as their sculpture  teaches us) amongst the ancients, two huge and almost preternatural  protuberances yet more distorted the unshapely head--around the brows  the skin was puckered into a web of deep and intricate wrinkles--the  eyes, dark and small, rolled in a muddy and yellow orbit--the nose,  short yet coarse, was distended at the nostrils like a satyr's--and the  thick but pallid lips, the high cheek-bones, the livid and motley hues  that struggled through the parchment skin, completed a countenance which  none could behold without repugnance, and few without terror and  distrust: whatever the wishes of the mind, the animal frame was well  fitted to execute them; the wiry muscles of the throat, the broad chest,  the nervous hands and lean gaunt arms, which were bared above the elbow,  betokened a form capable alike of great active exertion and passive  endurance.    'Calenus,' said the Egyptian to this fascinating flamen, 'you have  improved the voice of the statue much by attending to my suggestion; and  your verses are excellent.  Always prophesy good fortune, unless there  is an absolute impossibility of its fulfilment.'    'Besides,' added Calenus, 'if the storm does come, and if it does  overwhelm the accursed ships, have we not prophesied it? and are the  barks not blest to be at rest?--for rest prays the mariner in the AEgean  sea, or at least so says Horace--can the mariner be more at rest in the  sea than when he is at the bottom of it?'    'Right, my Calenus; I wish Apaecides would take a lesson from your  wisdom. But I desire to confer with you relative to him and to other  matters: you can admit me into one of your less sacred apartments?'    'Assuredly,' replied the priest, leading the way to one of the small  chambers which surrounded the open gate.  Here they seated themselves  before a small table spread with dishes containing fruit and eggs, and  various cold meats, with vases of excellent wine, of which while the  companions partook, a curtain, drawn across the entrance opening to the  court, concealed them from view, but admonished them by the thinness of  the partition to speak low, or to speak no secrets: they chose the  former alternative.    'Thou knowest,' said Arbaces, in a voice that scarcely stirred the air,  so soft and inward was its sound, 'that it has ever been my maxim to  attach myself to the young.  From their flexile and unformed minds I can  carve out my fittest tools.  I weave--I warp--I mould them at my will.  Of the men I make merely followers or servants; of the women...'    'Mistresses,' said Calenus, as a livid grin distorted his ungainly  features.    'Yes, I do not disguise it: woman is the main object, the great  appetite, of my soul.  As you feed the victim for the slaughter, I love  to rear the votaries of my pleasure.  I love to train, to ripen their  minds--to unfold the sweet blossom of their hidden passions, in order to  prepare the fruit to my taste.  I loathe your ready-made and ripened  courtesans; it is in the soft and unconscious progress of innocence to  desire that I find the true charm of love; it is thus that I defy  satiety; and by contemplating the freshness of others, I sustain the  freshness of my own sensations.  From the young hearts of my victims I  draw the ingredients of the caldron in which I re-youth myself.  But  enough of this: to the subject before us.  You know, then, that in  Neapolis some time since I encountered Ione and Apaecides, brother and  sister, the children of Athenians who had settled at Neapolis. The death  of their parents, who knew and esteemed me, constituted me their  guardian.  I was not unmindful of the trust. The youth, docile and mild,  yielded readily to the impression I sought to stamp upon him.  Next to  woman, I love the old recollections of my ancestral land; I love to keep  alive--to propagate on distant shores (which her colonies perchance yet  people) her dark and mystic creeds.  It may be, that it pleases me to  delude mankind, while I thus serve the deities.  To Apaecides I taught  the solemn faith of Isis.  I unfolded to him something of those sublime  allegories which are couched beneath her worship.  I excited in a soul  peculiarly alive to religious fervor that enthusiasm which imagination  begets on faith.  I have placed him amongst you: he is one of you.'    'He is so,' said Calenus: 'but in thus stimulating his faith, you have  robbed him of wisdom.  He is horror-struck that he is no longer duped:  our sage delusions, our speaking statues and secret staircases dismay  and revolt him; he pines; he wastes away; he mutters to himself; he  refuses to share our ceremonies.  He has been known to frequent the  company of men suspected of adherence to that new and atheistical creed  which denies all our gods, and terms our oracles the inspirations of  that malevolent spirit of which eastern tradition speaks.  Our  oracles--alas! we know well whose inspirations they are!'    'This is what I feared,' said Arbaces, musingly, 'from various  reproaches he made me when I last saw him.  Of late he hath shunned my  steps.  I must find him: I must continue my lessons: I must lead him  into the adytum of Wisdom. I must teach him that there are two stages of  sanctity--the first, FAITH--the next, DELUSION; the one for the vulgar,  the second for the sage.'    'I never passed through the first, I said Calenus; 'nor you either, I  think, my Arbaces.'    'You err,' replied the Egyptian, gravely.  'I believe at this day (not  indeed that which I teach, but that which I teach not).  Nature has a  sanctity against which I cannot (nor would I) steel conviction.  I  believe in mine own knowledge, and that has revealed to me--but no  matter.  Now to earthlier and more inviting themes.  If I thus fulfilled  my object with Apaecides, what was my design for Ione?  Thou knowest  already I intend her for my queen--my bride--my heart's Isis.  Never  till I saw her knew I all the love of which my nature is capable.'    'I hear from a thousand lips that she is a second Helen,' said Calenus;  and he smacked his own lips, but whether at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15659"],[0,"The Beacon Second Reader (#8)"],[1," and looked, but he could find only dust and dirt.    There were many, many people in London, and Dick thought that he could  soon find something to do.    He wandered around the streets, seeking for work.    He asked many people, but no one wanted the poor little country boy.    As Dick had no money for food, he soon became very, very hungry.    At last he grew so weak that he fell down before the door of a great  house.    Here the cook found him and began to beat him with a stick.    \"Run away, you lazy boy!\" she cried.    Poor Dick tried to rise, but he was so faint from want of food that he  could not stand.    Just then the owner of the house, Mr. Fitzwarren, came up. He took pity  on the poor boy and ordered the cook to give him some food.    Then he turned to Dick and said:    \"If you wish to work, you may help the cook in the kitchen. You will  find a bed in the attic.\"    Dick thanked Mr. Fitzwarren again and again for his kindness.    The cook was very cross to Dick and whipped him almost every day.    His bed in the attic was only a pile of old rags.    He soon found that there were many rats and mice in the attic.    They ran over his bed and made so much noise every night that he could  not sleep.    \"I wish I had a cat,\" thought Dick, \"for she could eat up these rats and  mice.\"    [Illustration]    One day Dick earned a penny by blacking a man's shoes.    \"I will try to buy a cat with this penny,\" thought Dick.    So he started out and soon met a woman with a large cat.    \"Will you sell me that cat?\" said Dick. \"I will give you this penny for  her.\"    \"You are a good boy,\" said the woman, \"and you may have the cat for a  penny, for I know you will treat her kindly.\"    That night Dick's bed was free from rats, and Miss Puss had a good  supper.    Dick began to love his cat dearly.      DICK WHITTINGTON--II    Now Mr. Fitzwarren had many ships which sailed to distant lands.    When a ship sailed Mr. Fitzwarren let every one in his house send  something on it.    The things were sold, and when the ship came back, each person had the  money for what he had sent.    One of the ships was ready to sail.    Every one in the house except Dick had sent something.    \"What is Dick going to send in the ship?\" said Mr. Fitzwarren.    \"Oh, that boy has nothing to send,\" said the cross cook.    \"It is true,\" said poor Dick; \"I have nothing but my dear cat.\"    \"Well, then you must send your cat,\" said Mr. Fitzwarren.    How lonely poor Dick was without Puss!    [Illustration]    The cook made fun of him for sending a cat on the ship.    At last Dick became so unhappy that he made up his mind to run away.    He started early in the morning, before any one in the house was up.    He had gone but a short way when he heard the sound of the six great  bells of Bow.    As they rang, \"Ding-dong, ding-dong!\" they seemed to say:        Turn back, Whittington,      Lord Mayor of London.    \"It is strange that the bells should speak to me,\" said Dick, \"but if I  am to be Lord Mayor of London, I will gladly turn back.\"    So he ran back to the house of Mr. Fitzwarren.    \"I hope they have not missed me,\" said Dick, as he gently opened the  door and stole softly in.      DICK WHITTINGTON--III    Dick's cat was taken across the ocean. The ship sailed and sailed, until  at last it came to a distant country.    Now the king and queen of this country were very rich. When the captain  was asked to show his goods before them he was very glad indeed to do  so.    The king and queen first gave the captain a great feast.    Gold and silver dishes filled with food were brought in.    [Illustration]    When these dishes were placed upon the table an army of rats came out.    There were white rats, and black rats, and brown rats, and big rats, and  little rats.    At once they fell upon the food and ate it nearly all up.    \"Why do you let the rats do this?\" asked the captain.    \"Alas, we cannot help ourselves,\" said the king. \"I would give half my  kingdom to be rid of them.\"    Then the captain thought of Dick Whittington's cat.    \"I have an animal which will rid you of them,\" said the captain.    \"Pray bring it in at once,\" said the queen.    What fun Dick's cat had killing the rats and mice in the king's palace!    \"We must buy that little animal,\" said the queen. \"I do not care how  much she may cost.\"    The captain could hardly carry all the jewels and gold that the king  gave him for the cat.    Then the ship with Dick's money came back to London, and the captain  told the story to Mr. Fitzwarren.    \"We must take these jewels and all this gold at once to Mr.  Whittington,\" said the honest man. \"He is no longer a poor boy, for this  has made him rich.\"    [Illustration]    They found Dick in the kitchen blacking the stove.    \"Come with me at once into the parlor,\" said Mr. Fitzwarren.    Then the bags of gold and jewels were piled at Dick's feet.    \"See what your cat has brought you,\" said Mr. Fitzwarren. \"You are now a  rich man and may yet be Lord Mayor of London.\"    And it is true that after Dick Whittington became a man, he was made  Lord Mayor of London.    _English Folk Tale_          [Illustration]        THE NEW MOON          Dear mother, how pretty        The moon looks to-night!      She was never so cunning before;        Her two little horns        Are so sharp and so bright,      I hope she'll not grow any more.          If I were up there,        With you and my friends,      I'd rock in it nicely, you'd see;        I'd sit in the middle        And hold by both ends.        Oh, what a bright cradle 'twould be!          I would call to the stars        To keep out of the way,      Lest we should rock over their toes;        And then I would rock        Till the dawn of the day,      And see where the pretty moon goes.          And there we would stay        In the beautiful skies,      And through the bright clouds we would roam;        We would see the sun set,        And see the sun rise,      And on the next rainbow come home.        ELIZA LEE FOLLEN          [Illustration]    BRIAR ROSE--I      A long time ago there lived a king and queen who were very, very sad  because they had no children.    One day, when the queen was resting near a spring, a frog crept out of  the water and said to her:    \"You shall have your wish. Within a year you shall have a little girl.\"    What the frog said came true.    The queen had a little child who was so beautiful that the king gave a  party in her honor.    He wished to invite all the wise women in the land, for these wise women  could grant fairy gifts to his little child.    There were thirteen of them, but only twelve were invited, as the king  had only twelve golden plates.    After the dinner was over, the wise women in turn arose from the table  and named their fairy gifts to the little princess.    The first gave to her goodness; the second, beauty; the third, riches;  and so on, up to the last.    Before the twelfth wise woman could speak, in walked the thirteenth.    This woman was in a great rage because she had not been invited.    She cried in a loud voice, \"When the princess is fifteen years old she  shall prick her finger with a spindle and shall fall down dead.\"    At these words every one turned pale with fright.    The twelfth wise woman, who had not yet spoken, now came up and said:    \"I could not stop this woman's evil words, I can only make them less  harsh.    The king's child shall not die, but a deep sleep shall fall upon her, in  which she shall stay one hundred years.\"      BRIAR ROSE--II    The little princess was so beautiful, so kind; and so good that no one  who knew her could help loving her.    As she grew older the king and queen began to feel very unhappy, for  they could not help thinking of what was to happen to their dear little  daughter.    They ordered all the spindles in the kingdom to be burned.    Now, as it happened, on the very day that the princess was fifteen years  old the king and queen were away from home.    The princess was quite alone in the castle, and she rain about over the  palace, looking in at rooms and halls, just as her fancy led her.    At last she came to an old tower at the top of a winding stair.    She saw a little door.    In the lock was a rusty key.    When she turned it, the door flew open.    There, in a small room, sat an old woman with her spindle, spinning  flax.    \"Good Morning,\" said the princess. \"Do tell me what that funny thing is  that jumps about so.\"    And then she held out her hand to take the spindle.    It came about just as the fairy had foretold.    The princess pricked her finger with the spindle.    At once she fell upon a bed which was near, and lay in a deep sleep as  if dead.    This sleep came not only upon the princess, but spread over the whole  castle.    The king and queen, who had just come home, fell asleep, and all their  lords and ladies with them.    The horses went to sleep in the stable; the dogs in the yard; the doves  on the roof; the flies on the wall; yes, even the fire that burned in  the fireplace grew still and slept.    The meat stopped roasting before the fire.    The cook in the kitchen was just going to box the ears of the kitchen  boy, but her hand dropped and she sank to sleep.    Outside the castle the wind was still, and upon the trees not a leaf  stirred.    In a short time there sprung up around the castle a hedge of thorn  bushes.    Year by year the hedge grew higher and higher, until at last nothing of  the castle could be seen above it, not even the roof, nor the chimneys,  nor the flag on the tower.      BRIAR ROSE--III    As years went by the story of the sleeping beauty was told all over the  kingdom.    Many kings' sons came and tried to get through the hedge of thorns, but  this they could not do.    The sharp thorns seemed to have hands which held the young men fast.    After many, many years a prince came from a far-off kingdom.   "]]]
