Here come our trunks,\" as two of the men servants  brought them in, \"and you must tell me what dress to put on.\"    \"You look so lovely in any and every one of the dozen or more that I have  small choice in the matter,\" laughed the young husband.    \"What gross flattery!\" she exclaimed. \"Well, then, I suppose I'll have to  choose for myself. But you mustn't complain if I do that some time when  you don't want me to.\"    The two Elsies had lingered a little behind the others--the old servants  had so many words of welcome to say to them--the younger one in especial,  because she had been so far and so long away.    And the babe must be handed about from one to another, kissed and blessed  and remarked upon as to his real or fancied resemblance to this or that  older member of the family.    \"It do 'pear pow'ful strange, Miss Elsie, dat you went away young lady and  come back wid husband and baby,\" remarked Aunt Dicey. \"And it don't seem  but yistiday dat you was a little bit ob a gal.\"    \"Yes, I have come back a great deal richer than I went,\" Elsie returned,  with a glance of mingled love and joy, first at her husband, then at her  infant son. \"I have great reason to be thankful.\"    At that moment Mrs. Travilla became aware that Max and Lulu were lingering  near, as if not knowing exactly what to do with themselves.    \"Ah, my dears,\" she said, turning to them with a kind and pleasant look,  \"has no one attended to you? Come with me, and I will show you your  rooms.\"    They followed her up the stairs, and each was shown into a very pleasant  room furnished tastefully and with every comfort and convenience.    Lulu's had two doors, one opening into the hall, the other into her  mamma's bedroom.    Elsie explained this, adding, \"So, if you are in want of anything or  should feel frightened or lonely in the night, you can run right in to the  room where you will find your mamma and Gracie.\"    \"Yes, ma'am, that is very nice; and oh, what a pretty room! How kind and  good you are to me! and to my brother and sister, too!\" cried Lulu, her  eyes shining with gratitude and pleasure.    \"I am very glad to be able to do it,\" Elsie said, taking the little  girl's hand in one of hers and smoothing her hair caressingly with the  other--for Lulu had taken off her hat. \"I want to be a mother to you, dear  child, and to your brother and sister, since my dear daughter is too young  for so great care and responsibility. I love you all, and I want you to  come freely to me with all your troubles and perplexities, your joys and  sorrows, just as my own children have always done. I want you to feel that  you have a right to do so, because I have invited you.\"    She bent down and kissed Lulu's lips, and the little girl threw her arms  about her neck with impulsive warmth, saying, \"Dear Grandma Elsie, I love  you and thank you ever so much! And I mean to try ever so hard to be  good,\" she added, with a blush and hanging her head shamefacedly. \"I know  I'm often very naughty; papa said I gave him more anxiety than Max and  Gracie both put together; and I'm afraid I can't be good all the time, but  I do mean to try hard.\"    \"Well, dear, if you try with all your might, asking help from on high, you  will succeed at last,\" Elsie said. \"And now I will leave you to wash and  dress. I see your trunk has been brought up and opened, so that you will  have no difficulty.\"    With that she passed on into Violet's rooms to see how Gracie was. She  found her sleeping sweetly in Violet's bed, the latter bending over her  with a very tender, motherly look on her fair young face.    \"Is she not a darling, mamma?\" she whispered, turning her head at the  sound of her mother's light footstep.    \"She is a very engaging child,\" replied Elsie. \"I think we are all fond of  her, but you especially.\"    \"Yes, mamma, I love her for herself--her gentle, affectionate  disposition--but still more because she is my husband's child, his dear  baby girl, as he so often called her.\"    \"Ah, I can understand that,\" Elsie said, with a loving though rather sad  look and smile into Violet's azure eyes, \"for I have often felt just so in  regard to my own children. What does Arthur say about her?\"    \"That she is more in need of rest and sleep than anything else at present.  He will see her again to-morrow, and will probably be able then to give me  full directions in regard to her diet and so forth.\"    \"You will come down to supper? you will not think it necessary to stay  with her yourself?\" Elsie said inquiringly.    \"Oh, no, mamma! I shall dress at once. I should not like to miss being  with you all,\" Violet answered, moving away from the bedside. \"Ah!\" with  sudden recollection, \"I have been quite forgetting Max and Lulu.\"    \"I have seen them to their rooms,\" her mother said, \"and now I must go and  attend to Rosie and Walter, and to my own toilet.\"    \"Dear mamma, thank you!\" Violet said heartily.    \"My dear, I consider them quite as much my children, and therefore my  especial charge, as yours, perhaps a trifle more,\" Elsie returned with  sprightly look and tone as she left the room.    Agnes was in attendance on her young mistress, and was presently sent to  ask if Lulu was in need of help, and to say that her mamma would like to  see her before she went down-stairs.    \"I don't need anything till I'm ready to have my sash tied,\" answered  Lulu, \"and then I'll come in to Mamma Vi and you to have it done. She was  very good to send you, Agnes, and you to come.\"    \"La! chile, it's jus' my business to mind Miss Wilet,\" returned Agnes.  \"An' she's good to eberybody, ob cose--always was.\"    \"What did you want to see me for, Mamma Vi?\" asked Lulu, as she presently  entered her young stepmother's dressing-room.    \"Just to make sure that your hair and dress are all right, dear. You know  we have company to-night, and I am particularly anxious that my little  Lulu shall look her very best.\"    The child's face flushed with pleasure. She liked to be well and  becomingly dressed, and it was gratifying to have Mamma Vi care that she  should be. Mrs. Scrimp was so different; she had never cared whether  Lulu's attire was tasteful and becoming or quite the reverse, but always  roused the child's indignation by telling her it was all sufficient if she  were only neat and clean.    \"Am I all right?\" she asked.    \"Pretty nearly; we will have you quite so in a minute,\" Violet answered.  \"Tie her sash Agnes, and smooth down the folds of her dress.\"    \"Mamma Vi, is that strange lady any relation to you?\" asked Lulu.    \"Yes, she is my aunt, mamma's sister.\"    \"She is pretty, but not nearly so pretty as Grandma Elsie.\"    \"No; I have always thought no one else could be half so beautiful as  mamma.\"    \"Why, Mamma Vi, you are yourself!\" exclaimed Lulu in a tone of honest  sincerity that made Violet laugh.    \"That is just your notion, little girl,\" she said, giving the child a  kiss.    \"Oh, I have eyes and can see! besides, papa thinks so, too, and Max and  Gracie.\"    \"Yes, my dear husband! he loves me, and love is very blind,\" murmured Vi,  half to herself, with a sigh and a far-off look in the lovely azure eyes.  Her thoughts were following him over the deep, wide, treacherous sea.    She stole on tiptoe into the next room for another peep at his sleeping  baby girl, Lulu going with her; then hearing the tea-bell, they went down  to the dining-room together.    They gathered about the table, a large cheerful party, the travellers full  of satisfaction in being at home again, the others so glad to have them  there once more.    Zoe was very merry and Rosie in almost wild spirits, but Max and Lulu, to  whom all was new and strange, were quite quiet and subdued, scarcely  speaking except when spoken to, \"Mamma,\" Rosie said, when they had  adjourned to the parlor, \"it's lovely out of doors, bright moonlight and  not a bit cold; mayn't I take Max and Lulu down to the lakelet?\"    \"Do you think the evening air would be injurious to them, Arthur?\" Mrs.  Travilla asked, turning to her cousin.    \"I think there is malaria in it, and would advise them to stay within  doors until after breakfast to-morrow morning,\" he answered, drawing Rose  to a seat upon his knee.    \"Then you'd better let us go,\" she said archly, \"so you can have some  more patients. Don't you like to have plenty of patients?\"    \"That's a leading question, little coz,\" he said laughingly, toying with  her curls. \"When people are sick I like to have an opportunity to exercise  my skill in trying to relieve and cure them, but I hope I don't want them  made sick in order to furnish me with employment.\"    \"I want to show Lulu and Max the beauties of Ion, and don't know how to  wait till to-morrow,\" she said.    \"Then take them about from one room to another, and let them look out  through the windows upon its moonlit lawn, alleys, gardens and lakelet.\"    \"Oh, yes, yes! that will do!\" she cried, leaving his knee in haste to  carry out his suggestion.    Max and Lulu, nothing loath, accepted her invitation, and they ran in and  out, up stairs and down, the young strangers delighted with the views thus  obtained of their new home and its surroundings.    Rosie said she hoped they would not be required to begin lessons  immediately, but would be allowed a few days in which to enjoy walks,  rides, drives, and boating.    \"I'll ask grandpa and mamma if we may,\" she added, as they re-entered the  parlor. She hastened to present her petition, and it was granted; the  children were told they should have a week in which to enjoy themselves  and recover from the fatigue of their journey, and would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14916"],[0,"Fairy Tales Every Child Should Know (#8)"],[1,"children, why have you been staying so long in  the forest? we thought you were never coming back,\" But their father was  overjoyed to see them, for it grieved him to the heart to think that  they had been left alone in the wood.    Not long after this there came another time of scarcity and want in  every house, and the children heard their stepmother talking after they  were in bed. \"The times are as bad as ever,\" she said; \"we have just  half a loaf left, and when that is gone all love will be at an end. The  children must go away; we will take them deeper into the forest this  time, and they will not be able to find their way home as they did  before; it is the only plan to save ourselves from starvation.\" But the  husband felt heavy at heart, for he thought it was better to share the  last morsel with his children.    His wife would listen to nothing he said, but continued to reproach him,  and as he had given way to her the first time, he could not refuse to do  so now. The children were awake, and heard all the conversation; so, as  soon as their parents slept, Hansel got up, intending to go out and  gather some more of the bright pebbles to let fall as he walked, that  they might point out the way home; but his stepmother had locked the  door, and he could not open it. When he went back to his bed he told his  little sister not to fret, but to go to sleep in peace, for he was sure  they would be taken care of.    Early the next morning the stepmother came and pulled the children out  of bed, and, when they were dressed, gave them each a piece of bread for  their dinners, smaller than they had had before, and then they started  on their way to the wood.    As they walked, Hansel, who had the bread in his pocket, broke off  little crumbs, and stopped every now and then to drop one, turning round  as if he was looking back at his home.    \"Hansel,\" said the woman, \"what are you stopping for in that way? Come  along directly.\"    \"I saw my pigeon sitting on the roof, and he wants to say good-bye to  me,\" replied the boy.    \"Nonsense,\" she said; \"that is not your pigeon; it is only the morning  sun shining on the chimney-top.\"    But Hansel did not look back any more; he only dropped pieces of bread  behind him, as they walked through the wood. This time they went on till  they reached the thickest and densest part of the forest, where they had  never been before in all their lives. Again they gathered faggots and  brushwood, of which the stepmother made up a large fire. Then she said,  \"Remain here, children, and rest, while I go to help your father, who is  cutting wood in the forest; when you feel tired, you can lie down and  sleep for a little while, and we will come and fetch you in the evening,  when your father has finished his work.\"    So the children remained alone till mid-day, and then Grethel shared her  piece of bread with Hansel, for he had scattered his own all along the  road as they walked. After this they slept for awhile, and the evening  drew on; but no one came to fetch the poor children. When they awoke it  was quite dark, and poor little Grethel was afraid; but Hansel comforted  her, as he had done before, by telling her they need only wait till the  moon rose. \"You know, little sister,\" he said, \"that I have thrown  breadcrumbs all along the road we came, and they will easily point out  the way home.\"    But when they went out of the thicket into the moonlight they found no  breadcrumbs, for the numerous birds which inhabited the trees of the  forest had picked them all up.    Hansel tried to hide his fear when he made this sad discovery, and said  to his sister, \"Cheer up, Grethel; I dare say we shall find our way home  without the crumbs. Let us try.\" But this they found impossible. They  wandered about the whole night, and the next day from morning till  evening; but they could not get out of the wood, and were so hungry that  had it not been for a few berries which they picked they must have  starved.    At last they were so tired that their poor little legs could carry them  no farther; so they laid themselves down under a tree and went to sleep.  When they awoke it was the third morning since they had left their  father's house, and they determined to try once more to find their way  home; but it was no use, they only went still deeper into the wood, and  knew that if no help came they must starve.    About noon, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on the branch  of a tree, and singing so beautifully that they stood still to listen.  When he had finished his song, he spread out his wings and flew on  before them. The children followed him, till at last they saw at a  distance a small house; and the bird flew and perched on the roof.    But how surprised were the boy and girl, when they came nearer, to find  that the house was built of gingerbread, and ornamented with sweet cakes  and tarts, while the window was formed of barley-sugar. \"Oh!\" exclaimed  Hansel, \"let us stop here and have a splendid feast. I will have a piece  from the roof first, Grethel; and you can eat some of the barley-sugar  window, it tastes so nice.\" Hansel reached up on tiptoe, and breaking  off a piece of the gingerbread, he began to eat with all his might, for  he was very hungry. Grethel seated herself on the doorstep, and began  munching away at the cakes of which it was made. Presently a voice came  out of the cottage:      \"Munching, crunching, munching,     Who's eating up my house?\"    Then answered the children:        \"The wind, the wind,       Only the wind,\"    and went on eating as if they never meant to leave off, without a  suspicion of wrong. Hansel, who found the cake on the roof taste very  good, broke off another large piece, and Grethel had just taken out a  whole pane of barley-sugar from the window, and seated herself to eat  it, when the door opened, and a strange-looking old woman came out  leaning on a stick.    Hansel and Grethel were so frightened that they let fall what they held  in their hands. The old woman shook her head at them, and said, \"Ah, you  dear children, who has brought you here? Come in, and stay with me for a  little while, and there shall no harm happen to you.\" She seized them  both by the hands as she spoke, and led them into the house. She gave  them for supper plenty to eat and drink--milk and pancakes and sugar,  apples and nuts; and when evening came, Hansel and Grethel were shown  two beautiful little beds with white curtains, and they lay down in them  and thought they were in heaven.    But although the old woman pretended to be friendly, she was a wicked  witch, who had her house built of gingerbread on purpose to entrap  children. When once they were in her power, she would feed them well  till they got fat, and then kill them and cook them for her dinner; and  this she called her feast-day. Fortunately the witch had weak eyes, and  could not see very well; but she had a very keen scent, as wild animals  have, and could easily discover when human beings were near. As Hansel  and Grethel had approached her cottage, she laughed to herself  maliciously, and said, with a sneer: \"I have them now; they shall not  escape from me again!\"    Early in the morning, before the children were awake, she was up,  standing by their beds; and when she saw how beautiful they looked in  their sleep, with their round rosy cheeks, she muttered to herself,  \"What nice tit-bits they will be!\" Then she laid hold of Hansel with her  rough hand, dragged him out of bed, and led him to a little cage which  had a lattice-door, and shut him in; he might scream as much as he  would, but it was all useless.    After this she went back to Grethel, and, shaking her roughly till she  woke, cried: \"Get up, you lazy hussy, and draw some water, that I may  boil something good for your brother, who is shut up in a cage outside  till he gets fat; and then I shall cook him and eat him!\" When Grethel  heard this she began to cry bitterly; but it was all useless, she was  obliged to do as the wicked witch told her.    For poor Hansel's breakfast the best of everything was cooked; but  Grethel had nothing for herself but a crab's claw. Every morning the old  woman would go out to the little cage, and say: \"Hansel, stick out your  finger, that I may feel if you are fat enough for eating.\" But Hansel,  who knew how dim her old eyes were, always stuck a bone through the bars  of his cage, which she thought was his finger, for she could not see;  and when she felt how thin it was, she wondered very much why he did not  get fat.    However, as the weeks went on, and Hansel seemed not to get any fatter,  she became impatient, and said she could not wait any longer. \"Go,  Grethel,\" she cried to the maiden, \"be quick and draw water; Hansel may  be fat or lean, I don't care, to-morrow morning I mean to kill him, and  cook him!\"    Oh! how the poor little sister grieved when she was forced to draw the  water; and, as the tears rolled down her cheeks, she exclaimed: \"It  would have been better to be eaten by wild beasts, or to have been  starved to death in the woods; then we should have died together!\"    \"Stop your crying!\" cried the old woman; \"it is not of the least use, no  one will come to help you.\"    Early in the morning Grethel was obliged to go out and fill the great  pot with water, and hang it over the fire to boil. As soon as this was  done, the old woman said, \"We will bake some bread first; I have made  the oven hot, and the dough is already kneaded.\" Then she dragged poor  little Grethel up to the oven door, under which the flames were burning  fiercely, and said: \"Creep in there, and see if it is hot enough yet to  bake the bread.\" But if Grethel had obeyed her, she would have shut the  poor child in and baked her for dinner, instead of boiling Hansel.    Grethel, however, guessed what she wanted to do, and said, \"I don't know  how to get in through that narrow door.\""]]]
