The tin will  bulge out, but is strong enough to withstand the pressure, and when  the contents cool the can will come back into shape.    The jars are now ready for the canner. Tomatoes sterilized under  boiling water require twenty-two minutes; in condensed-steam cooker,  twenty-two minutes; in water-seal, eighteen minutes; in  steam-pressure, with five pounds, fifteen minutes, and in the pressure  cooker, at ten or fifteen pounds, ten minutes.    If you use the homemade outfit or any water-bath outfit be sure the  water is boiling when the jars of tomatoes are lowered into the  canner. Time lost in bringing the contents to the point of  sterilization softens the tomatoes and results in inferior goods. Use  the ordinary good sense with which you have been endowed in handling  the jars and you will have no breakage. At the end of the sterilizing  period, remove the jars.    In taking canned goods from boiling hot water, care is needed to see  that they are protected from drafts. If necessary close the windows  and doors while lifting the jars out, for a sudden draft might break  them.    Examine rubbers to see that they are in place. Sometimes, if the  covers are screwed down too tight, the pressure of the steam from the  inside causes the rubber to bulge out. Simply loosen the cover a  thread or two, push the rubber back into place and then tighten. In  case the rubber does not seem to fit well or seems to be a poor  rubber, it should be replaced by a new one and the jar returned to the  cooker for five minutes.    The jars should be sealed tight--covers screwed down, clamps put in  place--immediately after they are removed from the cooker.    Invert to test the joint and cool. If the seal is not perfect, correct  the fault, and return the jar to the cooker for five minutes if hot,  ten minutes if jar is cold.    Do not invert vacuum-seal jars. These should be allowed to cool and  then tested by removing the spring or clamp and lifting the jars by  the cover only. Lift the jar only a half inch, holding it over the  table so that, in case the lid does not hold, the jar and contents  will not be damaged. Or, better still, tap round the edge of the  cover with a ruler. An imperfect seal will cause a hollow sound.    Tomato Puree. Small, misshapen, unevenly ripened tomatoes may be  converted into tomato _puree_. The tomatoes should be washed, run  through a colander to remove skins and cores, concentrated by cooking  to about half the original volume, and packed in the jars. Rubbers and  tops should then be placed in position and the product sterilized for  the same length of time as for canned tomatoes. _Puree_ even may be  kept in bottles sealed with sterilized corks and dipped several times  in paraffin.      HOW OTHER VEGETABLES ARE CANNED    All other vegetables are canned exactly like tomatoes, with two  exceptions. Tomatoes are scalded. All other vegetables are blanched.  We scald tomatoes to loosen the skins and to start the flow of the  coloring matter, which is later arrested or coagulated by the  cold-dip.    Blanching is scalding, only for a longer time. Scalding is never for  more than two minutes. Blanching covers from three to thirty minutes.    We blanch beans, peas, corn, cabbage, carrots, beets, turnips, and so  on, for three to ten minutes. We blanch these vegetables to eliminate  any objectionable acids or bitter flavors which may be present, and  thus improve the flavor; to reduce the bulk so we can pack closer; to  start the flow of the coloring matter; to improve the texture of the  vegetables by making them more tender, and to improve the appearance  by helping to make clear the liquid in the jar. Blanching is what  makes for success in the cold-pack method of canning. Blanching is  _very_ important and must be carefully and accurately done.    Let me repeat about blanching: Have the kettle of blanching water  _boiling vigorously, completely immerse_ the product in the boiling  water, cover the kettle _immediately_ and begin to time the product.  Do not stand with the cover in hand and wait for the water to come  back to the boil, for, of course, it stopped boiling for a second when  you lowered into it the cold product. If you cover the kettle the  water will quickly reboil. Do not keep wondering if it is boiling and  take off the cover to see. All these may seem foolish precautions, but  it is necessary to follow directions accurately.    And remember, all things that are scalded or blanched must be followed  immediately by a cold plunge or \"cold-dip.\" The scalding or blanching  is the \"hot-dip,\" and this must be followed by the \"cold-dip.\" You may  be asking, what is the point of this \"cold-dip\"? It is a very logical  question.    We \"cold-dip\" a product to harden the pulp under the skin and thus  permit the removal of the skin without injury to the pulp; to  coagulate the coloring matter and make it harder to dissolve during  the sterilization period and to make it easier to handle the products  in packing, and to subject the product to a sudden shock by quick  change in temperature.      STEPS IN CANNING VEGETABLES    If you will follow these steps for all vegetable canning you cannot  help but be successful:    1. Clean jars and test rubbers. If rubbers do not return to normal  shape after stretching, do not use.    2. Prepare material to be canned, according to directions given on  chart.    3. Hot-dip--blanch or scald--the prepared food. This process consists  of immersing the prepared product in boiling water for different  lengths of time, according to the material to be canned. See chart.  Hot-dipping shrinks the product and enables one to pack more material  in a jar.    4. Cold-dip the material. This process consists of plunging the  blanched or scalded food into cold water, which makes it more easily  handled. Be sure the water is cold; the colder the better.    Take the product out immediately and let it drain. _Don't let any food  soak in the cold water._    From this point on, speed is highly important. The blanched vegetables  which are slightly warm must not be allowed to remain out of the jars  a moment longer than is necessary.    Remove skins when required, and as each article is pared cut it into  pieces of proper size and    5. Pack directly into the clean, scalded cans or jars. Pack as solidly  as possible, being careful not to bruise or mash soft products. Pack  the product to within three-eighths of an inch of the top. Lima beans,  navy beans, peas, corn, pumpkin and sweet potatoes swell, so pack them  within only one inch of the top of the jar.    6. Add seasoning. One teaspoonful salt to every quart jar of  vegetables, and an equal amount of sugar to tomatoes, corn and peas if  desired.    7. Add boiling water to within a quarter inch of top to all  vegetables, except tomatoes and greens. Tomatoes contain ninety-four  per cent water, so none should be added. Tomato juice can be used if  desired. Greens are canned in just the water that clings to the  leaves after the cold-dip.    8. Adjust rubber rings and the covers of the jars; partially seal.    9. Sterilize--see time-table on pages following.    10. Remove from canner and completely seal. Test for leaks. Cool jars  as rapidly as possible, without drafts striking them.    Rapid cooling of the product prevents overcooking, clarifies the  liquid and preserves the shape and texture of the product.      SPECIAL DIRECTIONS FOR VARIOUS VEGETABLES    Greens. No water is added to greens. Ninety percent of greens is  water. They are high in mineral matter and we must preserve that.    Asparagus. Remove string before packing in jar. Can or dry tough ends  for soup. If asparagus is packed in jars as whole stalks, pack with  the tips up.    Tomatoes. Remove skins before packing. Tomatoes may be canned whole or  in pieces. Skin, cook and strain imperfect tomatoes. Use this for  liquid; as 94 per cent of the tomato is water, no water is needed.    Eggplants. Make slices about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch thick. Do not add salt,  as it causes eggplants to turn dark.    Pumpkin and squash. If you do not wish to scrape out of the shells you  can remove seeds, pare and cut into small blocks of uniform size. Then  blanch.    Sweet corn. Corn expands a little in processing, and for this reason  jars should not be filled quite full. Corn that has reached the dough  stage before being packed will have a cheesy appearance after  canning. Corn should never be allowed to remain in the cold-dip water.    Field corn. This product is commonly known as corn-club breakfast  food. The corn should be selected between the milk and the dough  stage. Wide-mouthed glass jars or tin cans should be used for canning  this product. Avoid packing container too full, as the product swells  during the sterilization period. The corn should be canned the same  day it is picked from the field if possible. After this product has  been sterilized and cooked and stored away it will form a solid,  butter-like mass which may be cut into convenient slices for toasting,  frying and baking purposes.    Mushrooms. Do not fail to blanch and cold dip. After opening  containers remove the mushrooms immediately and use them as quickly as  possible.    Sweet peppers. Place the peppers in the oven and bake them until the  skins separate from the meat. Remove the skin. Pack in hot jars. Add 1  teaspoonful of salt to a quart. Add boiling water.    Lima beans. Lima beans can be either blanched or steamed. If blanched  allow 5 minutes; if in live steam allow 10.    Wax or string beans. Beans can be canned whole or cut into uniform  pieces.    Cabbage and cauliflower. Cabbage and cauliflower should be soaked in  cold brine (1/2 lb. salt to 12 quarts water) for one hour before  blanching.    Brussels sprouts. Use small solid heads.    Peas. A cloudy or hazy appearance of the liquid indicates that the  product was roughly handled in blanching and cold dipping,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13789"],[0,"Great Britain and the American Civil War (#8)"],[1,"civilization, industry, and social excellence of  the North as compared with the South[26].    Mrs. Stowe's _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ excited greater interest in England  than in America itself. The first London edition appeared in May, 1852,  and by the end of the year over one million copies had been sold, as  opposed to one hundred and fifty thousand in the United States. But if  one distinguished writer is to be believed, this great British interest  in the book was due more to English antipathy to America than to  antipathy to slavery[27]. This writer was Nassau W. Senior, who, in  1857, published a reprint of his article on \"American Slavery\" in the  206th number of the _Edinburgh Review_, reintroducing in his book  extreme language denunciatory of slavery that had been cut out by the  editor of the _Review_[28]. Senior had been stirred to write by the  brutal attack upon Charles Sumner in the United States Senate after his  speech of May 19-20, 1856, evidence, again, that each incident of the  slavery quarrel in America excited British attention.    Senior, like Thomas Gladstone, painted the North as all anti-slavery,  the South as all pro-slavery. Similar impressions of British  understanding (or misunderstanding) are received from the citations of  the British provincial press, so favoured by Garrison in his  _Liberator_[29]. Yet for intellectual Britain, at least--that Britain  which was vocal and whose opinion can be ascertained in spite of this  constant interest in American slavery, there was generally a fixed  belief that slavery in the United States was so firmly established that  it could not be overthrown. Of what use, then, the further expenditure  of British sympathy or effort in a lost cause? Senior himself, at the  conclusion of his fierce attack on the Southern States, expressed the  pessimism of British abolitionists. He wrote, \"We do not venture to hope  that we, or our sons, or our grandsons, will see American slavery  extirpated, or even materially mitigated[30].\"      FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: State Department, Eng., Vol. LXXIX, No. 135, March 27,  1862.]    [Footnote 2: Walpole, _Russell_, Vol. II, p. 367.]    [Footnote 3: _Life of Lady John Russell_, p. 197.]    [Footnote 4: There was a revival of this fear at the end of the American  Civil War.

It has been remarked by the American historian, Schouler, that  immediately before the outbreak of the Civil War, diplomatic  controversies between England and America had largely been settled, and  that England, pressed from point to point, had \"sullenly\" yielded under  American demands. This generalization, as applied to what were, after  all, minor controversies, is in great measure true. In larger questions  of policy, as regards spheres of influence or developing power, or  principles of trade, there was difference, but no longer any essential  opposition or declared rivalry[31]. In theories of government there was  sharp divergence, clearly appreciated, however, only in governing-class  Britain. This sense of divergence, even of a certain threat from America  to British political institutions, united with an established opinion  that slavery was permanently fixed in the United States to reinforce  governmental indifference, sometimes even hostility, to America. The  British public, also, was largely hopeless of any change in the  institution of slavery, and its own active humanitarian interest was  waning, though still dormant--not dead. Yet the two nations, to a degree  not true of any other two world-powers, were of the same race, had  similar basic laws, read the same books, and were held in close touch at  many points by the steady flow of British emigration to the  United States.    When, after the election of Lincoln to the Presidency, in November,  1860, the storm-clouds of civil strife rapidly gathered, the situation  took both British Government and people by surprise. There was not any  clear understanding either of American political conditions, or of the  intensity of feeling now aroused over the question of the extension of  slave territory. The most recent descriptions of America had agreed in  assertion that at some future time there would take place, in all  probability, a dissolution of the Union, on lines of diverging economic  interests, but also stated that there was nothing in the American  situation to indicate immediate progress in this direction. Grattan, a  long-time resident in America as British Consul at Boston, wrote:         \"The day must no doubt come when clashing objects will break       the ties of common interest which now preserve the Union. But       no man may foretell the period of dissolution.... The many       restraining causes are out of sight of foreign observation.       The Lilliputian threads binding the man mountain are       invisible; and it seems wondrous that each limb does not act       for itself independently of its fellows. A closer examination       shows the nature of the network which keeps the members of       this association so tightly bound. Any attempt to untangle       the ties, more firmly fastens them. When any one State talks       of separation, the others become spontaneously knotted       together. When a section blusters about its particular       rights, the rest feel each of theirs to be common to all. If       a foreign nation "]]]
