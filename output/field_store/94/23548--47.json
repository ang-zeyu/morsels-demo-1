Animals are sometimes represented beside the divinities who were their  anthropomorphic forms.[99] Similarly the ram's-headed serpent points to  animal worship. But its presence with three-headed and horned gods is  enigmatic, though, as will be seen later, it may have been connected  with a cult of the dead, while the serpent was a chthonian animal.[100]  These gods were gods of fertility and of the underworld of the dead.  While the bag or purse (interchangeable with the cornucopia) was a  symbol of Mercury, it was also a symbol of Pluto, and this may point to  the fact that the gods who bear it had the same character as Pluto. The  significance of the torque is also doubtful, but the Gauls offered  torques to the gods, and they may have been regarded as vehicles of the  warrior's strength which passed from him to the god to whom the victor  presented it.    Though many attempts have been made to prove the non-Celtic origin of  the three-headed divinities or of their images,[101] there is no reason  why the conception should not be Celtic, based on some myth now lost to  us. The Celts had a cult of human heads, and fixed them up on their  houses in order to obtain the protection of the ghost. Bodies or heads  of dead warriors had a protective influence on their land or tribe, and  myth told how the head of the god Bran saved his country from invasion.  In other myths human heads speak after being cut off.[102] It might thus  easily have been believed that the representation of a god's head had a  still more powerful protective influence, especially when it was  triplicated, thus looking in all directions, like Janus.    The significance of the triad on these monuments is uncertain but since  the supporting divinities are now male, now female, now male and female,  it probably represents myths of which the horned or three-headed god was  the central figure. Perhaps we shall not be far wrong in regarding such  gods, on the whole, as Cernunnos, a god of abundance to judge by his  emblems, and by the cornucopia held by his companions, probably  divinities of fertility. In certain cases figures of squatting and  horned goddesses with cornucopia occur.[103] These may be consorts of  Cernunnos, and perhaps preceded him in origin. We may also go further  and see in this god of abundance and fertility at once an Earth and an  Under-earth god, since earth and under-earth are much the same to  primitive thought, and fertility springs from below the earth's surface.  Thus Cernunnos would be another form of the Celtic Dispater. Generally  speaking, the images of Cernunnos are not found where those of the god  with the hammer (Dispater) are most numerous. These two types may thus  be different local forms of Dispater. The squatting attitude of  Cernunnos is natural in the image of the ancestor of a people who  squatted. As to the symbols of plenty, we know that Pluto was confounded  with Plutus, the god of riches, because corn and minerals came out of  the earth, and were thus the gifts of an Earth or Under-earth god.  Celtic myth may have had the same confusion.    On a Paris altar and on certain steles a god attacks a serpent with a  club. The serpent is a chthonian animal, and the god, called Smertullos,  may be a Dispater.[104] Gods who are anthropomorphic forms of earlier  animal divinities, sometimes have the animals as symbols or attendants,  or are regarded as hostile to them. In some cases Dispater may have  outgrown the serpent symbolism, the serpent being regarded locally as  his foe; this assumes that the god with the club is the same as the god  with the hammer. But in the case of Cernunnos the animal remained as his  symbol.    Dispater was a god of growth and fertility, and besides being lord of  the underworld of the dead, not necessarily a dark region or the abode  of \"dark\" gods as is so often assumed by writers on Celtic religion, he  was ancestor of the living. This may merely have meant that, as in other  mythologies, men came to the surface of the earth from an underground  region, like all things whose roots struck deep down into the earth. The  lord of the underworld would then easily be regarded as their  ancestor.[105]    3. The hammer and the cup are also the symbols of a god called Silvanus,  identified by M. Mowat with Esus,[106] a god represented cutting down a  tree with an axe. Axe and hammer, however, are not necessarily  identical, and the symbols are those of Dispater, as has been seen. A  purely superficial connection between the Roman Silvanus and the Celtic  Dispater may have been found by Gallo-Roman artists in the fact that  both wear a wolf-skin, while there may once have been a Celtic wolf  totem-god of the dead.[107] The Roman god was also associated with the  wolf. This might be regarded as one out of many examples of a mere  superficial assimilation of Roman and Celtic divinities, but in this  case they still kept certain symbols of the native Dispater--the cup and  hammer. Of course, since the latter was also a god of fertility, there  was here another link with Silvanus, a god of woods and vegetation. The  cult of the god was widespread--in Spain, S. Gaul, the Rhine provinces,  Cisalpine Gaul, Central Europe and Britain. But one inscription gives  the name Selvanos, and it is not impossible that there was a native god  Selvanus. If so, his name may have been derived from _selva_,  \"possession,\" Irish _sealbh_, \"possession,\" \"cattle,\" and he may have  been a chthonian god of riches, which in primitive communities consisted  of cattle.[108] Domestic animals, in Celtic mythology, were believed to  have come from the god's land. Selvanus would thus be easily identified  with Silvanus, a god of flocks.    Thus the Celtic Dispater had various names and forms in different  regions, and could be assimilated to different foreign gods. Since Earth  and Under-earth are so nearly connected, this divinity may once have  been an Earth-god, and as such perhaps took the place of an earlier  Earth-mother, who now became his consort or his mother. On a monument  from Salzbach, Dispater is accompanied by a goddess called Aeracura,  holding a basket of fruit, and on another monument from Ober-Seebach,  the companion of Dispater holds a cornucopia. In the latter instance  Dispater holds a hammer and cup, and the goddess may be Aeracura.  Aeracura is also associated with Dispater in several inscriptions.[109]  It is not yet certain that she is a Celtic goddess, but her presence  with this evidently Celtic god is almost sufficient proof of the fact.  She may thus represent the old Earth-goddess, whose place the native  Dispater gradually usurped.    Lucan mentions a god Esus, who is represented on a Paris altar as a  woodman cutting down a tree, the branches of which are carried round to  the next side of the altar, on which is represented a bull with three  cranes--Tarvos Trigaranos. The same figure, unnamed, occurs on another  altar at Treves, but in this case the bull's head appears in the  branches, and on them sit the birds. M. Reinach applies one formula to  the subjects of these altars--\"The divine Woodman hews the Tree of the  Bull with Three Cranes.\"[110] The whole represents some myth unknown to  us, but M. D'Arbois finds in it some allusion to events in the  Cuchulainn saga. To this we shall return.[111] Bull and tree are perhaps  both divine, and if the animal, like the images of the divine bull, is  three-horned, then the three cranes (_garanus_, \"crane\") may be a rebus  for three-horned (_trikeras_), or more probably three-headed  (_trikarenos_).[112] In this case woodman, tree, and bull might all be  representatives of a god of vegetation. In early ritual, human, animal,  or arboreal representatives of the god were periodically destroyed to  ensure fertility, but when the god became separated from these  representatives, the destruction or slaying was regarded as a sacrifice  to the god, and myths arose telling how he had once slain the animal. In  this case, tree and bull, really identical, would be mythically regarded  as destroyed by the god whom they had once represented. If Esus was a  god of vegetation, once represented by a tree, this would explain why,  as the scholiast on Lucan relates, human sacrifices to Esus were  suspended from a tree. Esus was worshipped at Paris and at Treves; a  coin with the name AEsus was found in England; and personal names like  Esugenos, \"son of Esus,\" and Esunertus, \"he who has the strength of  Esus,\" occur in England, France, and Switzerland.[113] Thus the cult of  this god may have been comparatively widespread. But there is no  evidence that he was a Celtic Jehovah or a member, with Teutates and  Taranis, of a pan-Celtic triad, or that this triad, introduced by Gauls,  was not accepted by the Druids.[114] Had such a great triad existed,  some instance of the occurrence of the three names on one inscription  would certainly have been found. Lucan does not refer to the gods as a  triad, nor as gods of all the Celts, or even of one tribe. He lays  stress merely on the fact that they were worshipped with human  sacrifice, and they were apparently more or less well-known local  gods.[115]    The insular Celts believed that some of their gods lived on or in hills.  We do not know whether such a belief was entertained by the Gauls,  though some of their deities were worshipped on hills, like the Puy de  Dome. There is also evidence of mountain worship among them. One  inscription runs, \"To the Mountains\"; a god of the Pennine Alps,  Poeninus, was equated with Juppiter; and the god of the Vosges mountains  was called Vosegus, perhaps still surviving in the giant supposed to  haunt them.[116]    Certain grouped gods, _Dii Casses_, were worshipped by Celts on the  right bank of the Rhine, but nothing is known regarding their "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14674"],[0,"Ten Great Religions: An Essay in Comparative Theology (#8)"],[1,"takes new  ones. It passed out of its Jewish body under the guidance of Paul. In a  speculative age it unfolded into creeds and systems. In a worshipping age  it developed ceremonies and a ritual. When the fall of Rome left Europe  without unity or centre, it gave it an organization and order through the  Papacy. When the Papacy became a tyranny, and the Renaissance called for  free thought, it suddenly put forth Protestantism, as the tree by the  water-side sends forth its shoots in due season. Protestantism, free as  air, opens out into the various sects, each taking hold of some human  need; Lutheranism, Calvinism, Methodism, Swedenborgianism, or Rationalism.  Christianity blossoms out into modern science, literature, art,--children  who indeed often forget their mother, and are ignorant of their source,  but which are still fed from her breasts and partake of her life.  Christianity, the spirit of faith, hope, and love, is the deep fountain of  modern civilization. Its inventions are for the many, not for the few. Its  science is not hoarded, but diffused. It elevates the masses, who  everywhere else have been trampled down. The friend of the people, it  tends to free schools, a free press, a free government, the abolition of  slavery, war, vice, and the melioration of society. We cannot, indeed,  here _prove_ that Christianity is the cause of these features peculiar to  modern life; but we find it everywhere associated with them, and so we can  say that it only, of all the religions of mankind, has been capable of  accompanying man in his progress from evil to good, from good to better.    We have merely suggested some of the results to which the study of  Comparative Theology may lead us. They will appear more fully as we  proceed in our examination of the religions, and subsequently in their  comparison. This introductory chapter has been designed as a sketch of the  course which the work will take. When we have completed our survey, the  results to which we hope to arrive will be these, if we succeed in what we  have undertaken:--    1. All the great religions of the world, except Christianity and  Mohammedanism, are ethnic religions, or religions limited to a single  nation or race. Christianity alone (including Mohammedanism and Judaism,  which are its temporary and local forms) is the religion of all races.    2. Every ethnic religion has its positive and negative side. Its positive  side is that which holds some vital truth; its negative side is the  absence of some other essential truth. Every such religion is true and  providential, but each limited and imperfect.    3. Christianity alone is a [Greek: plaeroma], or a fulness of  truth, not coming to destroy but to fulfil the previous religions; but  being capable of replacing them by teaching all the truth they have  taught, and supplying that which they have omitted.    4. Christianity, being not a system but a life, not a creed or a form, but  a spirit, is able to meet all the changing wants of an advancing  civilization by new developments and adaptations, constantly feeding the  life of man at its roots by fresh supplies of faith in God and faith in  man.

Peculiarities of Chinese Civilization.      In qualifying the Chinese mind as prosaic, and in calling the writings of  Confucius and his successors _prose_, we intend no disrespect to either.  Prose is as good as poetry. But we mean to indicate the point of view from  which the study of the Chinese teachers should be approached. Accustomed  to regard the East as the land of imagination; reading in our childhood  the wild romances of Arabia; passing, in the poetry of Persia, into an  atmosphere of tender and entrancing song; then, as we go farther East into  India, encountering the vast epics of the Maha-Bharata and the  Ramayana;--we might naturally expect to find in far Cathay a still wilder  flight of the Asiatic Muse. Not at all. We drop at once from unbridled  romance into the most colorless prose. Another race comes to us, which  seems to have no affinity with Asia, as we have been accustomed to think  of Asia. No more aspiration, no flights of fancy, but the worship of  order, decency, propriety, and peaceful commonplaces. As the people, so  the priests. The works of Confucius and his commentators are as level as  the valley of their great river, the Yang-tse-kiang, which the tide  ascends for four hundred miles. All in these writings is calm, serious,  and moral They assume that all men desire to be made better, and will  take the trouble to find out how they can be made so. It is not thought  necessary to entice them into goodness by the attractions of eloquence,  the charm of imagery, or the fascinations of a brilliant wit. These  philosophers have a Quaker style, a dress of plain drab, used only for  clothing the thought, not at all for its ornament.    And surely we ought not to ask for any other attraction than the subject  itself, in order to find interest in China and its teachers. The Chinese  Empire, which contains more than five millions of square miles, or twice  the area of the United States, has a population of five hundred millions,  or half the number of the human beings inhabiting the globe. China proper,  inhabited by the Chinese, is half as large as Europe, and contains about  three hundred and sixty millions of inhabitants. There are eighteen  provinces in China, many of which contain, singly, more inhabitants than  some of the great states of Europe. But on many other accounts this nation  is deeply interesting.    China is the type of permanence in the world. To say that it is older than  any other _existing_ nation is saying very little. Herodotus, who has been  called the Father of History, travelled in Egypt about 450 B.C. He studied  its monuments, bearing the names of kings who were as distant from his  time as he is from ours,--monuments which even then belonged to a gray  antiquity. But the kings who erected those monuments were possibly  posterior to the founders of the Chinese Empire. Porcelain vessels, with  Chinese mottoes on them, have been found in those ancient tombs, in shape,  material, and appearance precisely like those which are made in China  to-day; and Rosellini believes them to have been imported from China by  kings contemporary with Moses, or before him. This nation and its  institutions have outlasted everything. The ancient Bactrian and Assyrian  kingdoms, the Persian monarchy, Greece and Rome, have all risen,  flourished, and fallen,--and China continues still the same. The dynasty  has been occasionally changed; but the laws, customs, institutions, all  that makes national life, have continued. The authentic history of China  commences some two thousand years before Christ, and a thousand years in  this history is like a century in that of any other people. The oral  language of China has continued the same that it is now for thirty  centuries. The great wall bounding the empire on the north, which is  twelve hundred and forty miles long and twenty feet high, with towers  every few hundred yards,--which crosses mountain ridges, descends into  valleys, and is carried over rivers on arches,--was built two hundred  years before Christ, probably to repel those fierce tribes who, after  ineffectual attempts to conquer China, travelled westward till they  appeared on the borders of Europe five hundred years later, and, under the  name of Huns, assisted in the downfall of the Roman Empire. All China was  intersected with canals at a period when none existed in Europe. The great  canal, like the great wall, is unrivalled by any similar existing work. It  is twice the length of the Erie Canal, is from two hundred to a thousand  feet wide, and has enormous banks built of solid granite along a great  part of its course. One of the important mechanical inventions of modern  Europe is the Artesian well. That sunk at Grenelle, in France, was long  supposed to be the deepest in the world, going down eighteen hundred feet.  One at St. Louis, in the United States, has since been drilled to a depth,  as has recently been stated, of about four thousand.[9] But in China these  wells are found by tens of thousands, sunk at very remote periods to  obtain salt water. The method used by the Chinese from immemorial time has  recently been adopted instead of our own as being the most simple and  economical. The Chinese have been long acquainted with the circulation of  the blood; they inoculated for the small-pox in the ninth century; and  about the same time they invented printing. Their bronze money was made as  early as 1100 B.C., and its form has not been changed since the beginning  of the Christian era. The mariner's compass, gunpowder, and the art of  printing were made known to Europe through stories told by missionaries  returning from Asia. These missionaries, coasting the shores of the  Celestial Empire in Chinese junks, saw a little box containing a  magnetized needle, called Ting-nan-Tchen, or \"needle which points to the  south.\" They also noticed terrible machines used by the armies in China  called Ho-pao or fire-guns, into which was put an inflammable powder,  which produced a noise like thunder and projected stones and pieces of  iron with irresistible force.    Father Hue, in his \"Christianity in China,\" says that \"the Europeans who  penetrated into China were no"]]]
