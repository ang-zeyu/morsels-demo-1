This return arrangement may likewise be  applied to the lines of secondary, tertiary, etc., order, as may easily be  seen.    The induction is effected by the aid of bobbins whose interior consists of  a bundle of soft iron. The wire of the inducting current is wound directly  around this core. The wire of the induced current is superposed upon the  first and presents a large number of spirals. It is useless to say that  these wires must be perfectly insulated from each other, as well as from  the soft iron core. We shall call primary bobbins those which are  interposed in the principal line, and secondary bobbins those in which the  inducting current is a secondary one, and so on.    It will be at once seen that this arrangement permits of continuing the  distribution of electricity to the interior of buildings by the simple  adjunction of one or several bobbins. Each electric apparatus, whether it  be a lamp or other mechanism, is furnished with a special current. If the  number of these apparatus be increased, it is only necessary to increase  the number of bobbins in the same ratio, on condition, be it understood,  that the intensity of the currents remain sufficient to secure a proper  working of the apparatus in question. When such intensity diminishes to  too great a degree, the bobbin must be replaced by a stronger one.    [Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRICITY BY INDUCTION.]    It results from what precedes that each apparatus must be put in in such a  way as to permit, of the opening and closing of the corresponding circuit.  This arrangement, moreover, has no need of being dependent upon the  apparatus, and may just as well be transferred to any part of this same  circuit. As regards lighting, it is preferable to employ alternating  current dynamo machines; yet there is nothing to prevent the use of  continuous current ones, provided that there is an arrangement that  permits of constantly opening and closing this same circuit. That portion  of the line which is placed under ground is insulated in the ordinary way  at the places where it is necessary. As for the underground circuit and  the induction coils connected therewith, these are protected against all  external influence, and are at the same time insulated very economically  by covering them with a coat of very fine silicious sand mixed with  asphalt.    It is only necessary to inspect the annexed figure to get an accurate idea  of this system of distribution. C represents the building in which the  generator of electricity, D, is placed; B, the public street, and Q the  house of a subscriber. The principal line, E, starts from the terminals,  _a, b_, of the machine, passes through the primary bobbins, G, and is  closed through the earth at F. It will be seen that the primary current  communicates through _d_ and _c_ with the internal winding of the bobbins,  G, while the secondary currents, H, are connected through _e_ and _f_ with  the external winding. The same arrangement is repeated for the tertiary  currents, M, and the quaternary ones, _o, p_. In the annexed example all  the lines that run parallel with the axis of the streets are closed  through the earth, while those that have a direction perpendicular thereto  enter the houses of subscribers and form a closed circuit. In the interior  of these houses the wires, as well as the induction coils, are insulated  and applied to the walls. At Q is represented the arrangement that would  have to be adopted in the case of a structure consisting of a vestibule,  _r_, and two rooms, _s_, lighted by two electric lamps, R. In the portion  of the figure situated to the left it is easy to see the process employed  for insulating the line. A commencement is made by digging a ditch in the  street and paving the bottom of it with bricks. Upon these latter there is  laid a mixture of sand and asphalt, and then the wires and bobbins are put  in, and the whole is finally covered with a new insulating layer.    It is a simple statement that we make here, and it is therefore not for us  to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the system. If we are to  believe Mr. Enuma, the advantages are very numerous, to wit: (1) The  cables have no need of being of large size; (2) the intensity is the same  through the entire extent of the primary circuit, secondary one, etc.; (3)  the resistance is invariable in all portions of the line; (4) the  apparatus are independent of each other, and consequently there may be a  disturbance in one or several of them without the others suffering  therefrom; (5) either a strong or weak luminous intensity may be produced,  since, that depends only upon the size of the coil employed; (6) there is  no style of lamp that may not be used, since each lamp is mounted upon a  special circuit; (7) any number of lamps may be lighted or extinguished  without the others being influenced thereby; (8) when a fire or other  accident happens in a house, it in no wise interferes with the service in  the rest of the line; (9) the system could, were it required, be connected  with any other kind of existing line; and (10) the cost of installation is  infinitely less than that of a system of gas pipes embracing the same  extent of ground.--_La Lumiere Electrique._           *       *       *       *       *          ELECTRICITY APPLIED TO THE STUDY OF SEISMIC MOVEMENTS.      Italy, with her volcanic nature, has very naturally made a specialty of  movements of the ground, or seismic perturbations. So the larger part of  the apparatus designed for such study are due to Italians. Several of  these instruments have already been, described in this journal, and on the  present occasion we shall make known a few others that will serve to give  an idea of the methods employed.    For the observation of the vertical and horizontal motions of the ground,  different apparatus are required. The following is a description of those  constructed for each of such purposes by the Brassart Brothers.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--APPARATUS FOR THE STUDY OF HORIZONTAL SEISMIC  MOVEMENTS.]    _Apparatus for Studying Horizontal Movements._--A lever, (Fig. 1), movable  about a horizontal axis, carries a corrugated funnel, _i_, at one of its  extremities. At the other extremity it is provided with a counterpoise  which permits of its being exactly balanced, while not interfering with  its sensitiveness.    [Illustration: FIGS. 2 AND 3.--DETAILS OF THE APPARATUS.]    The opening of the funnel passes freely around a column, _v_ (Fig. 2),  upon which is placed in equilibrium a rod that terminates in a weight, P.  The corrugations of the funnel carry letters indicating the four cardinal  points, and the funnel itself is capable of revolving in such a way that  the marked indications shall always correspond to the real position of the  cardinal points. When a horizontal shock occurs, the weight, P, falls in a  direction opposite thereto, and into one of the corrugations, where it  rests, so that the direction of the shock is indicated. But, in falling,  it causes the lever, F, to tilt, and this brings about an electric contact  between the screw, _h_, and the column, _n_, which sends a current into  the electro, E, so that the armature of the latter is attracted. In its  position of rest this armature holds a series of parts, S, A, L, which  have the effect of stopping the pendulum of a clock placed upon the same  apparatus. At the moment, then, that the armature is attracted the  pendulum is set free and the clockwork is started. As the current, at the  same time, sets a bell ringing, the observer comes and arranges the  apparatus again to await a new shock. Knowing the hour at which the hand  of the clock was stopped, he sees how long it has been in motion again and  deduces therefrom the precise moment of the shock.    The small rod, _f_, which is seen at the extremity of F, is for the  purpose of allowing electricity to be dispensed with, if need be. In this  case the screw, _h_, is so regulated that F descends farther, and that _f_  may depress the armature of the magnet just as the current would have  done.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--APPARATUS FOR THE STUDY OF VERTICAL MOVEMENTS.]    _Apparatus for the Study of Vertical Movements._--In this apparatus (Fig.  4), the contact is formed between a mercury cup, T, and a weight, D. The  cup is capable of being raised and lowered by means of a screw, so that  the two parts approach each other very closely without touching. At the  moment of a vertical shock a contact occurs between the mercury and  weight, and there results a current which, acting upon the electro, E,  frees the pendulum of the clock as in the preceding apparatus. In this  case, in order that the contact may be continuous and that the bell may be  rung, the piece, A, upon falling, sets up a permanent contact with the  part, _a_ (Fig. 3).    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--BRASSART'S SEISMIC CLOCK.]    _Brassart's Seismic Clock._--This apparatus is designed for being put in  connection at a distance with an indicator like the ones just described.  It is a simple clock to which a few special devices have been added.  Seismic clocks may be classed in two categories, according as they are  stopped by the effect of a shock or are set running at the very instant  one occurs. The Messrs. Brassart have always given preference to those of  the second category, because there is no need of watching them during a  seismic calm, and because they are much more easily constructed. It is to  this class, then, that their seismic clock belongs. It is capable of being  used for domestic purposes in place of any other clock, and of becoming a  seismoscopic clock as soon as it is put in electric"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14"],[0,"The 1990 CIA World Factbook (#8)"],[1,"my, contributing about 50% to  GDP.
