He wishes every  man to have the reading of his own scriptures, and whilst reserving his  most lavish gifts for Buddhist shrines and monasteries, he does not deny  his benefactions to Brahmans and ascetics of other sects. Nor is he  content merely to preach and issue orders. His monastic vows, though  they lead him to forswear the amusements and even the field sports which  had been his youthful pastimes, do not involve the severance of all  worldly ties. He is the indefatigable and supreme head of the Church; he  visits in solemn pilgrimage all the holy places hallowed by the memory  of Buddha, and endows shrines and monasteries and convents with princely  munificence; he convenes at Pataliputra a great Buddhist council for  combating heresy. But he remains the indefatigable and supreme head of  the State. \"I am never fully satisfied with my efforts and my despatch  of business. Work I must for the welfare of all, and the root of the  matter is in effort.\" He controls a highly trained bureaucracy not  unlike that of British India to-day, and his system of government is  wonderfully effective so long as it is informed by his untiring energy  and singular loftiness of purpose.    With Asoka Buddhism attained to a supremacy in India which may well be  compared with that of Christianity in Europe under Constantine; and it  is only by measuring the height to which Buddhism had then risen that we  can realise the enduring power of Hinduism, as we see it through  successive centuries slowly but irresistibly recovering all the ground  it had lost until Buddhism at last disappears almost entirely off the  face of India, whereas it continued to spread, though often in very  debased forms, over the greater part of Eastern Asia, and still  maintains its hold there over more than a third of the total population  of the globe.    As with most of the great rulers and conquerors that India has from time  to time thrown up, Asoka's life-work fell to pieces almost as soon as he  had passed away. Not only did the temporal empire which he built up  disintegrate rapidly in the hands of his feeble successors, but Buddhism  itself was dethroned within fifty years with the last of his dynasty,  slain by the usurper Pushyamitra Sunga, who, after consecrating himself  to the Hindu gods with the rites of _Rajasuya_, celebrated his advent to  Paramount Power by reviving the ancient ceremony of _Asvamedha_, the  Sacrifice of the Horse--one of the most characteristic of Brahmanical  rites.    It was not till after another great conquering inflow from Central Asia  in the first century of our era that Kanishka, the greatest of a new  dynasty which had set itself up at Purushpura, situated close to the  modern Peshawar, shed a transient gleam of glory over the decline of  Buddhism and even restored it to the position of a state religion. But  it was a Buddhism already far removed from the purity of Asoka's reign.  The most striking feature of this short-lived revival is the artistic  inspiration which it derived from Hellenistic sources, of which the  museums of Peshawar and Lahore contain so many remarkable illustrations.  The theory, at one time very widely entertained, that Alexander's brief  incursion into India left any permanent mark on Indian civilisation is  now entirely discarded by the best authorities. No Indian author makes  even the faintest allusion to him, nor is there any trace of Hellenic  influence in the evolution of Indian society, or in the elaborate  institutions with which India was endowed by the Mauryan dynasty that  followed immediately on the disruption of Alexander's empire. But the  Kushans, or Yueh Chis, during the various stages of their slow migration  down into Northern India, came into long and close contact with the  Indo-Bactrian and Indo-Parthian kingdoms that sprang up after Alexander.  The populations were never Hellenised, but their rulers were to some  extent the heirs, albeit hybrid heirs, to Greek civilisation. They spoke  Greek and worshipped at Greek shrines, and as they were in turn  subjugated by the forebears of the Kushan Empire, they imparted to the  conquerors something of their own Greek veneer. In the second century of  our era Kanishka carried his victorious arms down to the Gangetic plain,  where Buddhism still held its own in the region which had been its  cradle; and, according to one tradition, he carried off from Pataliputra  a famous Buddhist saint, who converted him to Buddhism. But as these  Indo-Scythian kings had not been long enough in India to secure  admission to the social aristocracy of Hinduism by that slow process of  naturalisation to which so many ruling families have owed their Kshatrya  pedigrees, Kanishka, having himself no claim to caste, may well have  preferred for reasons of state to favour Buddhism as a creed  fundamentally opposed to caste distinctions. Whatever the motives of his  conversion, we have it on the authority of Hiuen-Tsang that he  ultimately did great things for Buddhism, and the magnificent _stupa_,  which he erected outside his capital, five-and-twenty stories high and  crowned with a cupola of diamonds, was still 150 feet high and measured  a quarter of a mile in circumference when the Chinese pilgrim visited  Purushpura five centuries later. To the present day there are traces  outside the northern gate of Peshawar of a great Buddhist monastery,  also built by Kanishka, which remained a seat of Buddhist learning until  it was destroyed by Mahomedan invaders; and it was only a mile from  Peshawar that the American Sanskritist, Dr. Spooner, discovered ten  years ago the casket containing some of Buddha's bones, which is one of  the most perfect specimens of Graeco-Buddhist art. The Buddhist statues  and bas-reliefs of that period are Greek rather than Indian in their  treatment of sacred history, and even the head of Gautama himself might  sometimes be taken for that of a young Greek god.    These exotic influences may indeed have acted as a further solvent upon  Buddhism. But in any case, its local and temporary revival as a dominant  state religion under Kanishka, whose empire did not long outlive him,  failed to arrest its steady resorption into Hinduism. On the one hand,  Buddhism itself was losing much of its original purity. The miraculous  legends with which the life of Buddha was gradually invested, the almost  idolatrous worship paid to him, the belief that he himself was but the  last of many incarnations in which the Buddha had already revealed  himself from the very beginning of creation--all these later accretions  represent, no doubt, the reaction upon Buddhism of its Hinduistic  surroundings. But they doubtless helped also to stimulate the growth of  the more definite forms of anthropomorphism which characterised the  development of Hinduism when the ancient ritual and the more impersonal  gods of the Vedas and of the Brahmanas gave way to the cult of such very  personal gods as Shiva and Vishnu, with their feminine counterparts,  Kali and Lakshmi, and ultimately to the evolution of still more popular  deities, some, like Skanda and the elephant-headed Ganesh, closely  connected with Shiva; others like Krishna and Rama, _av[=a]taras_ or  incarnations--and in many ways extremely human incarnations--of Vishnu.  At the same time, the Aryan Hindus, as they went on subduing the  numerous aboriginal races of India, constantly facilitated their  assimilation by the more or less direct adoption of their primitive  deities and religious customs. The two great epics, the Mahabharata,  with its wonderful episode, the Baghavat-Ghita, which is the apotheosis  of Krishna, and the Ramayana, which tells the story of Rama, show the  infusion into Hinduism of a distinctly national spirit in direct  opposition to the almost cosmopolitan catholicity of Buddhism,  sufficiently elastic to adapt itself even to the political aspirations  of non-Hindu conquerors as well as of non-Hindu races beyond the borders  of Hindustan, in Nepal and in Ceylon, in Burma and in Tibet, in China  and in Japan. The conflict between Buddhist and Hindu theology might not  have been irreconcilable, for Hinduism, as we know, was quite ready to  admit Buddha himself into the privileged circle of its own gods as one  of the incarnations of Vishnu. What was irreconcilable was the conflict  between a social system based on Brahmanical supremacy and one that  denied it--especially after Hinduism had acquired a new sense of Indian  patriotism which only reached fuller development in our own times when  it was quickened by contact with European nationalism.    Hindus themselves prefer, however, to-day to identify Indian nationalism  with the period when from another long interval of darkness, which  followed the downfall of the Kushan kingdom, Indian history emerges into  the splendour of what has been called \"the golden age of Hinduism\" in  the fourth and fifth centuries of our era under the great Gupta dynasty,  who ruled at Ujjain. Few Indian cities are reputed to be more ancient or  more sacred than the little town of Ujjain on the Sipra river, known as  Ozen[=i] to the Greeks, and where Asoka had ruled in his youth as  Viceroy of Western India. It owes its birth to the gods themselves.  When Uma wedded Shiva her father slighted him, not knowing who he was,  for the mighty god had wooed and won her under the disguise of a mere  ascetic mendicant, and she made atonement by casting herself into the  sacrificial fire, which consumed her--the prototype of all pious Hindu  widows who perform _Sati_--in the presence of gods and Brahmans. Shiva,  maddened with grief, gathered up the bones of his unfortunate consort  and danced about with them in a world-shaking frenzy. Her scattered  bones fell to earth, and wherever they fell the spot became sacred and a  temple sprang up in her honour. One of her elbows fell on the banks of  the Sipra at Ujjain, and few shrines enjoy "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15604"],[0,"Piano Mastery: Talks with Master Pianists and Teachers (#8)"],[1,"sonata, entire;  Chopin's Ballade in A flat major; Cesar Franck, Prelude, Fugue and  Variations; a Mozart Fantaisie; Grieg Concerto, first movement; Weber's  Concertstueck, and Chopin's Scherzo in E. The recital was most  instructive from an educational point of view. All the players had  repose and concentration, and there were no noticeable slips, though  every piece was played from memory. Hands were well arched at the  knuckles, fingers curved--with adequate action at the knuckle joint;  wrists in normal position, and extremely loose; the whole arm swung from  the shoulder and poised over the keys, thus adjusting itself to every  requirement of the composition. Every note had its amount of hand or arm  weight. The tone quality was full and singing. These points were  exemplified even in the playing of the youngest pupils. Furthermore they  had an intelligent grasp of the meaning of the music they played, and  brought it out with conviction, power, and brilliancy.          IX    CARL M. ROEDER    PROBLEMS OF PIANO TEACHERS      \"The progressive teacher's method must be one of accretion,\" said Carl  Roeder, when interviewed between lesson hours in his delightful studio  in Carnegie Hall. \"He gains ideas from many methods and sources, and  these he assimilates and makes practical for his work. At the same time  he must originate and work out things for himself. This has been my  experience.    \"I was something of a wonder child, and at an early age developed  considerable facility and brilliancy. After knocking about as a pupil of  various private teachers and conservatories, I became, while quite a  young lad, the pupil of de Konstki, then a lion of the day.\" The speaker  joined in the laugh his remark called up, which brought to mind the  Chevalier's famous battle-horse, \"The Awakening of the Lion.\"    \"De Konstki's style was very brilliant and I endeavored to imitate him  in this respect. I did quite a little concert work at that time.  Realizing, however, that a pianist's income must be rather precarious, I  decided to teach. In those youthful days I had the idea that the teacher  of the piano had an easy life. I remembered one of my professors, a man  of considerable reputation, who took the duties of his profession very  lightly. His method of giving a lesson was to place the music upon the  piano, start the pupil going, then retire to a comfortable couch, light  his pipe and smoke at ease, troubling himself little about the pupil's  doings, except occasionally to call out 'Falsch!'    \"So I, too, began to teach the piano. But I soon discovered that  teaching was something quite different from what I had imagined it to  be, and that it was something I knew very little about. I now set myself  to learn how to teach--how to help those pupils who came to me.    \"One of my first discoveries was that most of the pupils were afflicted  with stiff wrists and arms, and that this stiffness must be remedied. My  own playing had always been free, due to one of my early teachers having  thoroughly inculcated the principle of 'weight,' so often acclaimed in  these days as a modern discovery. But how to bring about this condition  in others was a great problem. I studied the Mason method, and found  many helpful, illuminating ideas in regard to relaxation and  devitalization. I had some lessons with S.B. Mills, and later did  considerable valuable work with Paolo Gallico, who opened up to me the  great storehouse of musical treasure, and revealed to me among other  things the spiritual technic of the pianist's art. Subsequently I  investigated the Virgil and Leschetizky methods. Mr. Virgil has done  some remarkable things in the way of organizing and systematizing  technical requirements, and for this we owe him much. Such analyses had  not before been made with anything like the care and minuteness, and his  work has been of the greatest benefit to the profession. My subsequent  studies with Harold Bauer revealed him to be a deep musical thinker and  a remarkable teacher of the meaning of music itself.    \"In my teaching I follow many of the ideas of Leschetizky, modified and  worked out in the manner which I have found most useful to my own  technic and to that of my pupils. I have formulated a method of my own,  based on the principles which form a dependable foundation to build the  future structure upon. Each pupil at the outset is furnished with a  blank book, in which are written the exercises thus developed as adapted  to individual requirements.      FOUNDATIONAL EXERCISES    \"We begin with table work. I use about ten different exercises which  embody, as it were, in a nutshell, the principles of piano playing. The  hand is first formed in an arched position, with curved fingers, and  solidified. The thumb has to be taught to move properly, for many people  have never learned to control it at all.    \"With the hand in firm, solid position, and the arm hanging freely from  the shoulder, I begin to use combined arm and wrist movements, aiming to  get the weight of the arm as well as its energy at the complete disposal  of the finger tip. Each finger in turn is held firmly in a curved  position and played with a rotary movement of arm and wrist. When this  can be done we next learn hand action at the wrist from which results  the staccato touch. In this form of hand staccato there is an element of  percussion, as you see, but this element gives directness and precision  to the staccato touch, which in my opinion are necessary. After this we  come to finger action itself. This principle is taken up thoroughly,  first with one finger, then with two, three, four, and five--in all  possible combinations. In this way we come down from the large free-arm  movements to the smaller finger movements; from the 'general to the  particular,' instead of working from the smaller to the larger. I find  it most necessary to establish relaxation first, then strengthen and  build up the hand, before finger action to any extent is used. When  these foundational points have been acquired, the trill, scales,  arpeggios, chords, octaves and double notes follow in due course. At the  same time the rhythmic sense is developed, all varieties of touch and  dynamics introduced, and harmonic and structural analysis dwelt upon.      USE OF STUDIES    \"Above the third or fourth grade I make frequent use of studies,  selecting them from various books. Duvernoy, Op. 120; Berens, Op. 61;  Czerny, Op. 740 I find far more interesting than the threadbare 299.  Heller is indispensable, so melodious and musical. Arthur Foote's  studies, Op. 27, are very useful; also MacDowell's, Op. 39 and 46.  Sometimes I use a few of Cramer's and the Clementi 'Gradus,' though  these seem rather old-fashioned now.    \"For more advanced pupils I find Harberbier, Op. 53 especially  applicable; there is beautiful work in them. Kessler, Op. 20, and the  Moszkowski studies, Op. 72, have splendid material for the advanced  player, and prepare for Henselt, Rubinstein, Chopin and Liszt etudes. I  find that studies are valuable for application of technical principles,  for reacting purposes, and for the cultivation of all the refinements of  playing. Some teachers believe in applying the technic directly to  pieces, and use almost no studies; but I think a study is often more  valuable than a piece, because a definite technical principle is treated  in every kind of way. Though I do not require studies to be memorized,  they must be played with all the finish of a piece, if the pupil is to  derive the maximum of benefit from them.      BOOKS THAT ARE HELPFUL    \"As aids to my studies in the art of teaching, several books have been  most helpful. Among these are two volumes by Dr. Herman H. Home, _The  Philosophy of Education_, and _The Psychology of Education_. Another  book, from which I have profited much is William James' _Talks to  Teachers on Psychology_. Every teacher should possess it.    \"You ask what method I pursue with new pupils who have played a great  deal of music but with little idea of correct principles of piano study.  Let us take, for instance, one who has had lessons for years but is in  ignorance of first principles. Arms and wrists are stiff, hands and  fingers held in cramped position; no freedom anywhere. My first move is  to have the pupil stand and learn to relax arms, shoulders and body;  then learn to breathe. But relaxation, even at first, is not the only  thing; after devitalization comes organization, firmness and  solidity--in the right places. It must be understood at the very  beginning that piano playing is far more than sitting before the  instrument working the fingers six or seven hours a day. The mechanical  side is only preliminary. Some one has said that the factors in playing  are a trinity of H's--head, hand and heart. I try at once to awaken  thought, to give a wider outlook, to show that piano playing is the  expression, through the medium of tone, of all that the poet, painter  and philosopher are endeavoring to show through other means: to this  end I endeavor to stimulate interest in the wonders of the visible  universe, the intellectual achievements of men and the deep things of  spiritual discernment.      IN REGARD TO INTERPRETATION    \"On this subject I think we should avoid pedantry; not to say to the  pupil, you must play this piece a certain way; but rather say, I see or  feel it in this way, and give the reasons underlying the conception. I  believe the successful teacher should be a pianist. He should understand  every point and be able to _do_ the thing, else how can he really show  the manner of the doing? Many of the _nuances_, subtleties of color and  phrase, effects of charm or of bravura, cannot be explained; they must  be illustrated. And furthermore, only he who has been over the road can  be a safe or sympathetic guide. Tolstoi realized he could not be of  service to the people he would uplift"]]]
