Part of Jorrocks's half-quartern loaf was bartered with the captain of  an East Indiaman for a slice of buffalo-beef. The dentist exchanged  some veal sandwiches with a Jew for ham ones; a lawyer from the Borough  offered two slices of toast for a hard-boiled egg; in fact there was a  petty market \"ouvert\" held. \"Now, Tomkins, where's the bottle?\" demanded  Jenkins. \"Vy, I thought you would bring it out to-day,\" replied he; \"I  brought it last time, you know.\" \"Take a little of mine, sir,\" said a  gentleman, presenting a leather-covered flask--\"real Thomson and Fearon,  I assure you.\" \"I wish someone would fetch an ocean of porter from the  nearest public,\" said another. \"Take a cigar, sir?\" \"No; I feel werry  much obliged, but they always make me womit.\" \"Is there any gentleman  here going to Halifax, who would like to make a third in a new yellow  barouche, with lavender-coloured wheels, and pink lining?\" inquired  Mr.----, the coach-maker. \"Look at the hounds, gentlemen sportsmen,  my noble sportsmen!\" bellowed out an Epsom Dorling's  correct--cardseller--and turning their eyes in the direction in which  he was looking, our sportsmen saw them again making for the hills.  Pepper-and-salt first, and oh, what a goodly tail was there!--three  quarters of a mile in length, at the least. Now up they come--the \"corps  de reserve\" again join, and again a party halt upon the hills. Again Tom  Hills exchanges horses; and again the hounds go on in full cry. \"I must  be off,\" said a gentleman in balloon-like leathers to another tiger; \"we  have just time to get back to town, and ride round by the park before it  is dark--much better than seeing the end of this brute. Let us go\"; and  away they went to canter through Hyde Park in their red coats. \"I must  go and all,\" said another gentleman; \"my dinner will be ready at five,  and it is now three.\" Jorrocks was game; and forgetting the quarter of  house-lamb, again tackled with the pack. A smaller sweep sufficed this  time, and the hills were once more descended, Jorrocks the first to lead  the way. He well knew the fox was sinking, and was determined to be in  at the death. Short running ensued--a check--the fox had lain down,  and they had overrun the scent. Now they were on him, and Tom Hills's  who-whoop confirmed the whole.    \"Ah! Tom Hills, Tom Hills!\" exclaimed Jorrocks, as the former took up  the fox, \"'ow splendid, 'ow truly brilliant--by Jove, you deserve to  be Lord Hill--oh, had he but a brush that we might present it to this  gentleman from the north-east side of the town of Boroughbridge, in the  county of York, to show the gallant doings of the men of Surrey!\" \"Ay,\"  said Tom, \"but Squire----'s keeper has been before us for it.\"    \"Now,\" said a gentleman in a cap, to another in a hat, \"if you will  ride up the hill and collect the money there, I will do so  below--half-a-crown, if you please, sir--half-a-crown, if you please,  sir.--Have I got your half-a-crown, sir?\"--\"Here's three shillings if  you will give me sixpence.\" \"Certainly, sir--certainly.\" \"We have no  time to spare,\" said Jorrocks, looking at his watch. \"Good afternoon,  gentlemen, good afternoon,\" muttering as he went, \"a quarter of  house-lamb at half-past five--Mrs. Jorrocks werry punctual--old Fleecy  werry particular.\" They cut across country to Croydon, and as they  approached the town, innumerable sportsmen came flocking in from all  quarters. \"What sport have you had?\" inquired Jorrocks of a gentleman in  scarlet; \"have you been with Jolliffe?\" \"No, with the staghounds; three  beautiful runs; took him once in a millpond, once in a barn, and once in  a brickfield--altogether the finest day's sport I ever saw in my life.\"  \"What have you done, Mr. J----?\" \"Oh, we have had a most gallant thing;  a brilliant run indeed--three hours and twenty minutes without a  check--over the finest country imaginable.\" \"And who got the brush?\"  inquired the stag-man. \"Oh, it was a gallant run,\" said Jorrocks, \"by  far the finest I ever remember.\" \"But did you kill?\" demanded his  friend. \"Kill! to be sure we did. When don't the Surrey kill, I should  like to know?\" \"And who got his brush, did you say?\" \"I can't tell,\"  said he--\"didn't hear the gentleman's name.\" \"What sport has Mr. Meager  had to-day?\" inquired he of a gentleman in trousers, who issued from a  side lane into the high road. \"I have been with the Sanderstead, sir--a  very capital day's sport--run five hares and killed three. We should  have killed four--only--we didn't.\" \"I don't think Mr. Meager has done  anything to-day.\" \"Yes, he has,\" said a gentleman, who just joined  with a hare buckled on in front of his saddle, and his white cords all  stained with blood; \"we killed this chap after an hour and forty-five  minutes' gallop; and accounted for another by losing her after running  upwards of-three-quarters of an hour.\" \"Well, then, we have all had  sport,\" said Jorrocks, as he spurred his horse into a trot, and made for  Morton's stables--\"and if the quarter of house-lamb is but right, then  indeed am I a happy man.\"        III. SURREY SHOOTING: MR. JORROCKS IN TROUBLE    Our readers are now becoming pretty familiar with our principal hero,  Mr. Jorrocks, and we hope he improves on acquaintance. Our fox-hunting  friends, we are sure, will allow him to be an enthusiastic member of the  brotherhood, and though we do not profess to put him in competition with  Musters, Osbaldeston, or any of those sort of men, we yet mean to say  that had his lot been cast in the country instead of behind a counter,  his keenness would have rendered him as conspicuous--if not as  scientific--as the best of them.    For a cockney sportsman, however, he is a very excellent fellow--frank,  hearty, open, generous, and hospitable, and with the exception of riding  up Fleet Street one Saturday afternoon, with a cock-pheasant's tail  sticking out of his red coat pocket, no one ever saw him do a cock tail  action in his life.    The circumstances attending that exhibition are rather curious.--He had  gone out as usual on a Saturday to have a day with the Surrey, but on  mounting his hunter at Croydon, he felt the nag rather queer under him,  and thinking he might have been pricked in the shoeing, he pulled up at  the smith's at Addington to have his feet examined. This lost him five  minutes, and unfortunately when he got to the meet, he found that a  \"travelling[13] fox\" had been tallied at the precise moment of throwing  off, with which the hounds had gone away in their usual brilliant style,  to the tune of \"Blue bonnets are over the border.\" As may be supposed,  he was in a deuce of a rage; and his first impulse prompted him to  withdraw his subscription and be done with the hunt altogether, and he  trotted forward \"on the line,\" in the hopes of catching them up to tell  them so. In this he was foiled, for after riding some distance, he  overtook a string of Smithfield horses journeying \"foreign for Evans,\"  whose imprints he had been taking for the hoof-marks of the hunters.  About noon he found himself dull, melancholy, and disconsolate, before  the sign of the \"Pig and Whistle,\" on the Westerham road, where, after  wetting his own whistle with a pint of half-and-half, he again journeyed  onward, ruminating on the uncertainty and mutability of all earthly  affairs, the comparative merits of stag-, fox-, and hare-hunting, and  the necessity of getting rid of the day somehow or other in the country.    [Footnote 13: He might well be called a \"travelling fox,\" for it was  said he had just travelled down from Herring's, in the New Road, by the  Bromley stage.]    Suddenly his reverie was interrupted by the discharge of a gun in the  field adjoining the hedge along which he was passing, and the boisterous  whirring of a great cock-pheasant over his head, which caused his horse  to start and stop short, and to nearly pitch Jorrocks over his head. The  bird was missed, but the sportsman's dog dashed after it, with all the  eagerness of expectation, regardless of the cracks of the whip--the  \"comes to heel,\" and \"downs to charge\" of the master. Jorrocks pulled  out his hunting telescope, and having marked the bird down with the  precision of a billiard-table keeper, rode to the gate to acquaint the  shooter with the fact, when to his infinite amazement he discovered his  friend, Nosey Browne (late of \"The Surrey\"), who, since his affairs had  taken the unfortunate turn mentioned in the last paper, had given up  hunting and determined to confine himself to shooting only. Nosey,  however, was no great performer, as may be inferred, when we state that  he had been in pursuit of the above-mentioned cock-pheasant ever since  daybreak, and after firing thirteen shots at him had not yet touched a  feather.    His dog was of the right sort--for Nosey at least--and hope deferred had  not made his heart sick; on the contrary, he dashed after his bird for  the thirteenth time with all the eagerness he displayed on the first.  \"Let me have a crack at him,\" said Jorrocks to Nosey, after their mutual  salutations were over. \"I know where he is, and I think I can floor  him.\" Browne handed the gun to Jorrocks, who, giving up his hunter in  exchange, strode off, and having marked"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15399"],[0,"The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, Or Gustavus Vassa, The (#8)"],[1,"of war.    The first object which saluted my eyes when I arrived on the coast was  the sea, and a slave ship, which was then riding at anchor, and  waiting for its cargo. These filled me with astonishment, which was  soon converted into terror when I was carried on board. I was  immediately handled and tossed up to see if I were sound by some of  the crew; and I was now persuaded that I had gotten into a world of  bad spirits, and that they were going to kill me. Their complexions  too differing so much from ours, their long hair, and the language  they spoke, (which was very different from any I had ever heard)  united to confirm me in this belief. Indeed such were the horrors of  my views and fears at the moment, that, if ten thousand worlds had  been my own, I would have freely parted with them all to have  exchanged my condition with that of the meanest slave in my own  country. When I looked round the ship too and saw a large furnace or  copper boiling, and a multitude of black people of every description  chained together, every one of their countenances expressing dejection  and sorrow, I no longer doubted of my fate; and, quite overpowered  with horror and anguish, I fell motionless on the deck and fainted.  When I recovered a little I found some black people about me, who I  believed were some of those who brought me on board, and had been  receiving their pay; they talked to me in order to cheer me, but all  in vain. I asked them if we were not to be eaten by those white men  with horrible looks, red faces, and loose hair. They told me I was  not; and one of the crew brought me a small portion of spirituous  liquor in a wine glass; but, being afraid of him, I would not take it  out of his hand. One of the blacks therefore took it from him and gave  it to me, and I took a little down my palate, which, instead of  reviving me, as they thought it would, threw me into the greatest  consternation at the strange feeling it produced, having never tasted  any such liquor before. Soon after this the blacks who brought me on  board went off, and left me abandoned to despair. I now saw myself  deprived of all chance of returning to my native country, or even the  least glimpse of hope of gaining the shore, which I now considered as  friendly; and I even wished for my former slavery in preference to my  present situation, which was filled with horrors of every kind, still  heightened by my ignorance of what I was to undergo. I was not long  suffered to indulge my grief; I was soon put down under the decks, and  there I received such a salutation in my nostrils as I had never  experienced in my life: so that, with the loathsomeness of the stench,  and crying together, I became so sick and low that I was not able to  eat, nor had I the least desire to taste any thing. I now wished for  the last friend, death, to relieve me; but soon, to my grief, two of  the white men offered me eatables; and, on my refusing to eat, one of  them held me fast by the hands, and laid me across I think the  windlass, and tied my feet, while the other flogged me severely. I had  never experienced any thing of this kind before; and although, not  being used to the water, I naturally feared that element the first  time I saw it, yet nevertheless, could I have got over the nettings,  I would have jumped over the side, but I could not; and, besides, the  crew used to watch us very closely who were not chained down to the  decks, lest we should leap into the water: and I have seen some of  these poor African prisoners most severely cut for attempting to do  so, and hourly whipped for not eating. This indeed was often the case  with myself. In a little time after, amongst the poor chained men, I  found some of my own nation, which in a small degree gave ease to my  mind. I inquired of these what was to be done with us; they gave me to  understand we were to be carried to these white people's country to  work for them. I then was a little revived, and thought, if it were no  worse than working, my situation was not so desperate: but still I  feared I should be put to death, the white people looked and acted, as  I thought, in so savage a manner; for I had never seen among any  people such instances of brutal cruelty; and this not only shewn  towards us blacks, but also to some of the whites themselves. One  white man in particular I saw, when we were permitted to be on deck,  flogged so unmercifully with a large rope near the foremast, that he  died in consequence of it; and they tossed him over the side as they  would have done a brute. This made me fear these people the more; and  I expected nothing less than to be treated in the same manner. I could  not help expressing my fears and apprehensions to some of my  countrymen: I asked them if these people had no country, but lived in  this hollow place (the ship): they told me they did not, but came from  a distant one. 'Then,' said I, 'how comes it in all our country we  never heard of them?' They told me because they lived so very far off.  I then asked where were their women? had they any like themselves? I  was told they had: 'and why,' said I,'do we not see them?' they  answered, because they were left behind. I asked how the vessel could  go? they told me they could not tell; but that there were cloths put  upon the masts by the help of the ropes I saw, and then the vessel  went on; and the white men had some spell or magic they put in the  water when they liked in order to stop the vessel. I was exceedingly  amazed at this account, and really thought they were spirits. I  therefore wished much to be from amongst them, for I expected they  would sacrifice me: but my wishes were vain; for we were so quartered  that it was impossible for any of us to make our escape. While we  stayed on the coast I was mostly on deck; and one day, to my great  astonishment, I saw one of these vessels coming in with the sails up.  As soon as the whites saw it, they gave a great shout, at which we  were amazed; and the more so as the vessel appeared larger by  approaching nearer. At last she came to an anchor in my sight, and  when the anchor was let go I and my countrymen who saw it were lost in  astonishment to observe the vessel stop; and were not convinced it was  done by magic. Soon after this the other ship got her boats out, and  they came on board of us, and the people of both ships seemed very  glad to see each other. Several of the strangers also shook hands with  us black people, and made motions with their hands, signifying I  suppose we were to go to their country; but we did not understand  them. At last, when the ship we were in had got in all her cargo, they  made ready with many fearful noises, and we were all put under deck,  so that we could not see how they managed the vessel. But this  disappointment was the least of my sorrow. The stench of the hold  while we were on the coast was so intolerably loathsome, that it was  dangerous to remain there for any time, and some of us had been  permitted to stay on the deck for the fresh air; but now that the  whole ship's cargo were confined together, it became absolutely  pestilential. The closeness of the place, and the heat of the climate,  added to the number in the ship, which was so crowded that each had  scarcely room to turn himself, almost suffocated us. This produced  copious perspirations, so that the air soon became unfit for  respiration, from a variety of loathsome smells, and brought on a  sickness among the slaves, of which many died, thus falling victims to  the improvident avarice, as I may call it, of their purchasers. This  wretched situation was again aggravated by the galling of the chains,  now become insupportable; and the filth of the necessary tubs, into  which the children often fell, and were almost suffocated. The shrieks  of the women, and the groans of the dying, rendered the whole a scene  of horror almost inconceivable. Happily perhaps for myself I was soon  reduced so low here that it was thought necessary to keep me almost  always on deck; and from my extreme youth I was not put in fetters. In  this situation I expected every hour to share the fate of my  companions, some of whom were almost daily brought upon deck at the  point of death, which I began to hope would soon put an end to my  miseries. Often did I think many of the inhabitants of the deep much  more happy than myself. I envied them the freedom they enjoyed, and as  often wished I could change my condition for theirs. Every  circumstance I met with served only to render my state more painful,  and heighten my apprehensions, and my opinion of the cruelty of the  whites. One day they had taken a number of fishes; and when they had  killed and satisfied themselves with as many as they thought fit, to  our astonishment who were on the deck, rather than give any of them to  us to eat as we expected, they tossed the remaining fish into the sea  again, although we begged and prayed for some as well as we could, but  in vain; and some of my countrymen, being pressed by hunger, took an  opportunity, when they thought no one saw them, of trying to get a  little privately; but they were discovered, and the attempt procured  them some very severe floggings. One day, when we had a smooth sea and  moderate wind, two of my wearied countrymen who were chained together  (I was near them at the time), preferring death to such a life of  misery, somehow made through the nettings and jumped into the sea:  immediately another quite dejected fellow, who, on account of his  illness, was suffered to be out of irons, also followed their example;  and I believe many more would very soon have done the same if they had  not been prevented by the ship's crew, who were instantly alarmed.  Those of us that were the most active were in a moment put down under  the deck, and there was such a noise and confusion amongst the people  of the ship as I never heard before, to stop her, "]]]
