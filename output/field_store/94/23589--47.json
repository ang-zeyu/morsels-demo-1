CHAPTER XI    SPIRAL TURNING      Spiral turning is a subject that has received very little attention by  most schools in which wood turning is taught. Spiral work is seen in  antique furniture and also in the modern furniture of the present day.  It seems that it takes the wheel of fashion about a century to make a  complete turn, for what our forefathers neglected and destroyed the  people of the present day value and cherish.    Spiral work gives excellent practice in shaping and modelling wood. It  brings into play the principle of the helix as used in cutting threads,  etc.; and its form, size and shape may be varied according to the taste  of the individual. As in threads so in spiral work we have single and  double spirals, and their form and proportion depend upon their use and  application in furniture making. A variation of the spiral may be made  in several ways: First, by changing the number of turns of the spiral on  a straight shaft; second, by running a spiral on a tapered shaft; third,  by changing the shape or form of the spiral itself; and fourth, by  making more than one spiral on a shaft. It is uncommon to see ten or  twelve spirals running around a single shaft.    Some of the forms of the above types are fully taken up and explained in  the work that is to follow.      PLATES B-V--1-a, a'. SINGLE SPIRAL. STRAIGHT SHAFT    To work out a single spiral for a pedestal proceed as follows:    1. Turn a cylinder 2-1/4\" in diameter. Make the ends slightly larger in  order that the design may be turned on each, after the spiral has been  worked out.    2. Lay off spaces 2-1/16\" apart on the cylinder while the spindle is  turning in the lathe and divide each of these into four equal parts.  Each one of these large spaces represents one turn of the spiral. A good  proportion is slightly less than the diameter of the cylinder; thus the  diameter of the cylinder equals 2-1/4\" and the width of the space  2-1/16\".    3. On the cylinder parallel to the axis draw lines A-A B-B C-C D-D.  These lines should be 90 deg. apart as shown in the top diagram (Plate  B-V--1-a'). Line D-D is on the other side of the cylinder as shown in  the top and middle diagrams.    [Illustration: Fig. 23.]    4. Start on line A-A at point X, circle 1, and draw a line connecting it  with line B-B on circle 1'. Then connect B-B on circle 1' with C-C on  circle 2 and so on until a spiral has been drawn the entire length of  the cylinder. This line will form the ridge of the spiral as shown in  the middle diagram.    5. Next begin on line C-C at circle 1, and draw a line connecting it  with D-D on circle 1' then to line A-A on circle 2, and so on as before.  This spiral represents the center of the groove or the portion which is  to be cut away. This is not shown in the diagram because more or less  confusion would be caused with the line representing the ridge of the  spiral.    6. Begin on line C-C at circle 1, and saw to a depth of 3/4\". Saw the  entire length of the cylinder leaving about 1-1/2\" at the ends. Do not  follow the line here, but switch off gradually and follow circles 1 and  15, so as to allow the spiral to begin and end gradually and not  abruptly.    7. Rough out with a knife or chisel by cutting on both sides of the saw  cut. Then use a wood rasp to finish shaping out the spiral. When  properly shaped out allow the lathe to turn slowly and smooth with  sandpaper by following the spiral as the lathe turns.    [Illustration: Fig. 24.]    [Illustration: Fig. 24-a.]    [Illustration: Fig. 25.]    8. Cut the design on both ends of the cylinder and polish.      PLATES B-V--2-a, a', a''. SINGLE SPIRAL. TAPERED SHAFT    To lay off a single spiral for the electric lamp shown in Figs. 24 and  24a proceed as follows:    1. Select your wood and bore a hole through it. Plug the hole and center  the piece in the lathe. This insures getting the hole exactly in the  center, and it will not be cut into while the cutting of the groove of  the spiral proceeds. A groove may also be cut in two pieces of stock and  glued together to form a hole through the stock.    2. Turn a cylinder 2-1/2\" in diameter, tapering it to 1-1/2\" at the one  end; this part should be 12-1/8\" long. Both ends should be left larger  than 2-1/2\" as the lower and upper designs must be cut here.    3. Let the spindle revolve in the lathe and draw circles as shown in the  layout (Plate B-V--2-a'). The number of circles will vary with the  taper. Since seven turns are needed in the present spiral, 28 circles  will be necessary--four circles for each turn of the spiral as shown in  the middle diagram. A good proportion to follow is to measure the  diameter of the spindle at circle 2 and lay off this distance from  circle 1 to circle 3. Then measure the diameter at circle 4 and lay off  this diameter from circle 3 to circle 5 and so on until all circles have  been made. Then divide these large divisions into four equal parts.    4. Draw four lines the entire length of the spindle, each 90 deg. apart as  shown by the heavy lines in the middle diagram. The heavy circles of the  same diagram represent the complete turns of the spiral.    5. Lay out the line representing the ridge of the spiral as shown in the  middle diagram. Begin on circle 1, where the straight line crosses it,  draw to circle 1' at the point where the next straight line crosses it,  then to 2--2'--3--3' and so on until the end is reached. This forms the  ridge of the spiral as shown in diagram 3. Next it may be more  convenient to draw another line representing the groove. In this case  begin at point X in the middle diagram, opposite the point where first  started, and continue in the preceding manner, making this line parallel  to the other line.    6. Saw on the line last made, being careful not to saw too deeply. The  depth must be 1/4\" less than half the diameter of the spindle where the  cut is made. This saw cut forms the groove of the spiral. The groove is  then cut out by hand with a chisel or knife, by working down the wood on  both sides of the saw cut. After the spirals have been roughed out, a  rasp is used to finish shaping them. The work is then sandpapered  smooth, while the spindle is revolved slowly in the lathe.    7. Cut designs on the ends of the cylinder and polish.      PLATES B-V--2-b, b'. DOUBLE SPIRAL. TAPERED SHAFT    To work out a double spiral for the electric lamp illustrated in Fig. 25  proceed as follows:    1. Turn up the spindle in the usual manner. Since the base of the shaft  is larger than the top, the spiral must also be in proportion and lines  A-A', B-B', C-C', D-D', and E-E', are drawn around the shaft. To get the  approximate spacing from circles A-A to B-B measure the diameter at A-A'  plus about 3/16\" and lay off from A-A' to B-B'. Then take the diameter  of B-B' plus about 3/16\" and lay off from A-A' to B-B'. Then take the  diameter at B-B' plus about 3/16\" and lay off from circle B-B' to C-C'  and so on. If the shaft is tapered more, a different proportion must be  used. Also if it is desired to have the twist wind around the shaft  three times, a variation must be made in the number of circles.    [Illustration: Fig. 27.]    2. If it is desired to have the twist wind around the shaft twice, draw  circles 1-1', 2-2', 3-3', and 4-4' and the spaces will grow  proportionately smaller at the small end.    3. Draw four lines running lengthwise on the spindle and 90 deg. apart as  shown in the midde figure in heavy lines (Plate B-V--2-b').    4. Begin at A and draw a curved line to where the 90 deg. line crosses  circle 1-1'. From there extend the line to where the next 90 deg. line  crosses circle B-B' at point B'. Continue in this manner until the other  end of the shaft is reached. Begin at A' and draw a line on the opposite  side of the shaft. These two lines running around and along the shaft  form the grooves while the portion in between forms the beads of the  double spiral.    5. Saw to the desired depth, being 1/4\" less than half the diameter at  the point where cut. With a chisel or knife form the grooves and beads.  It is necessary to be careful about not ending the grooves too abruptly.  (See point 6 in Plates B-V--1-a, a'.) Smooth with a rasp and sandpaper  while the lathe is revolving slowly.    6. Cut the design on the ends and polish.      PLATES B-V--3-a, a'. DOUBLE GROOVE SPIRAL. STRAIGHT SHAFT    To work out the double groove spiral for the magazine holder  illustrated, proceed as follows:    1. Square up the stock to 1-3/8\". Center carefully and turn the design  on both ends as shown, in the upper diagram (Plate B-V--3-a'). Turn the  cylinder between the top and bottom, making it 5-1/2\" long and 1-3/8\" in  diameter.    [Illustration: Fig. 26.]    2. Divide the cylinder into two equal parts. Each part represents one  revolution of the spiral.    3. Divide each half into four equal parts as shown in the top and center  diagrams (Plate B-V--3-a'), 1-1', 2-2', 3-3' and so on. The proportion  of the distance between these circles should be one-half the diameter of  the cylinder.    4. Draw lines A-A, B-B, C-C, and D-D, parallel to the axis of the  cylinder 90 deg. apart.    5. With a band 3/16\" wide of any substantial material (preferably a  narrow strip of tin or a watch main spring) begin on the line A-A at  circle 1, and connect circle 1' at line B-B, and then connect circle 2  at C-C, and so on until the spiral is made the entire length. Mark on  both sides of the 3/16\" band so as to keep the spiral parallel.    6. Next begin at the line C-C where circle 1 crosses it and connect from  here to 1' at B-B.
