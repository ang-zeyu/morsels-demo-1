Even  of the battle of Barnet (April 14, 1471), when the Earl of Warwick and  10,000 men were slain, we have not sufficient note to say, though it can  hardly be doubted, that many Birmingham citizens went down. But still we  have on record one real \"Battle of Birmingham,\" which took place on the  3rd of April, 1643. On that day our town was attacked by Prince Rupert,  with some 2,000 horse and foot; being pretty stoutly opposed, his  soldiers slew a number of inhabitants, burnt nearly 80 houses, and did  damage (it is said) to the extent of L30,000. It took five days for the  news of this exploit to reach London. In the week following Christmas of  the same year, a number of townspeople, aided by a party of the  Commonwealth soldiers, laid siege to, and captured, Aston Hall.    ~Bazaars.~--When originated none can tell. How much good done by means  of them, nobody knows. But that immense amounts have been raised for  good and charitable purposes, none can deny--and then, \"they are _such_  fun!\". \"Grand Bazaars\" have been held for many an institution, and by  many different sects and parties, and to attempt to enumerate them would  be an impossibility, but the one on behalf of the Queen's Hospital, held  in April, 1880, is noteworthy, for two reasons:--first, because the  proceeds amounted to the munificent sum of L5,969, and, secondly, from  the novelty of the decorations. The body of the Town Hall was arranged  to represent an English street of the olden time, a baronial castle  rising tower upon tower at the great gallery end, and an Elizabethan  mansion in the orchestra, with a lawn in front, occupied by a military  band. The sides of the Hall constituted a double row of shops, the upper  storeys (reaching to the galleries) being filled with casements and  balconies, from whence the doings in the street could be witnessed.    ~Bean Club.~--The first anniversary we read of was that held July 17,  1752, at which meeting Lord Fielding gave L120 to erect an altarpiece in  St. Bartholomew's.    ~Beardsworth (John).~--Founder of the Repository, began life as driver  of a hackney coach, in which one night he drove a beautiful young lady  to a ball. John went home, dressed, procured admission to the ball,  danced with the lady, handed her to the coach, drove her home, and some  time after married her. The lady's cash enabled him to acquire an ample  fortune, being at one time worth nearly a quarter of a million, most of  which, however, was lost on the turf. The Repository was the largest  establishment of the kind in the kingdom, and Beardsworth'a house  adjoining was furnished in most splendid style, one centre table (made  of rich and rare American wood) costing L1,500.    ~Beelzebub.~--Watt's first steam engine was so christened. It was  brought from Scotland, put up at Soho, and used for experimenting upon.  It was replaced by \"Old Bess,\" the first engine constructed upon the  expansive principle. This latter engine is now in the Museum of Patents,  South Kensington, though Mr. Smiles says he saw it working in 1857,  seventy years after it was made.    ~Beer.~--Brewers of beer were first called upon to pay a license duty in  1784, though the sellers thereof had been taxed more or less for 250  years previously. The effect of the heavy duties then imposed was to  reduce the consumption of the national and wholesome beverage, which in  1782 averaged one barrel per head of the then population per annum, down  to half-a-barrel per head in 1830, its place being filled by an  increased consumption of ardent spirits, which from half-a-gallon per  head in 1782, rose by degrees to six-sevenths of a gallon per head by  1830. In this year, the statesmen of the day, who thought more of the  well-being of the working part of the population than raising money by  the taxation of their necessaries, took off the 10s. per barrel on beer,  in the belief that cheap and good malt liquors would be more likely to  make healthy strong men than an indulgence in the drinking of spirits.  Notwithstanding all the wild statements of the total abstainers to the  contrary, the latest Parliamentary statistics show that the consumption  of beer per head per annum averages _now_ only seven-eighths of a  barrel, though before even this moderate quantity reaches the consumers,  the Government takes [see Inland Revenue returns, 1879, before  alteration of malt-tax] no less a sum than L19,349 per year from the  good people of Birmingham alone. Of this sum the brewers paid L9,518,  the maltsters L425, beer dealers L2,245, and beer retailers L7,161.    ~Bells.~--There was a bell foundry at Good Knave's End, in 1760, from  whence several neighbouring churches were supplied with bells to summon  the good knaves of the day to prayers, or to toll the bad knaves to  _their_ end. There was also one at Holloway Head, in 1780, but the  business must have been hollow enough, for it did not go ahead, and we  find no record of church bells being cast here until just a hundred  years back (1732), when Messrs. Blews & Son took up the trade.  Birmingham bells have, however, made some little noise in the world, and  may still be heard on sea or land, near and far, in the shape of door  bells, ship bells, call bells, hand bells, railway bells, sleigh bells,  sheep bells, fog bells, mounted on rockbound coasts to warn the weary  mariner, or silver bells, bound with coral from other coasts, to soothe  the toothless babbler. These, and scores of others, are ordered here  every year by thousands; but the strangest of all orders must have been  that one received by a local firm some fifteen years ago from a West  African prince, who desired them to send him 10,000 house bells (each  3/4 lb. weight), wherewith to adorn his iron \"palace.\" And he had them!  Edgar Poe's bells are nowhere, in comparison with      Such a charm, such a chime,    Out of tune, out of time.    Oh, the jangling and the wrangling    Of ten thousand brazen throats.     Ten bells were put in St. Martin's, in 1786, the total weight being 7  tons, 6 cwt. 2 lbs.    The peal of ten bells in St. Philip's were first used August 7, 1751,  the weight being 9 tons 10 cwt. 22 lbs., the tenor weighs 30 cwt.    A new peal of eight bells were put up in Aston Church, in May, 1776, the  tenor weighing 21 cwt. The St. Martin's Society of Change Ringers  \"opened\" them, July 15, by ringing Holt's celebrated peal of 5040  grandsire triples, the performance occupying 3 hours 4 minutes.    Eight bells and a clock were mounted in the tower of Deritend Chapel, in  1776, the first peal being rung July 29.    The eight bells in Bishop Ryder's Church, which weigh 55 cwt., and cost  L600, were cast in 1868, by Blews and Sons, and may be reckoned as the  first full peal founded in Birmingham.    There are eight bells in Harborne Parish Church, four of them bearing  date 1697, two with only the makers' name on, and two put in February,  1877, on the 24th of which month the whole peal were inaugurated by the  ringing of a true peal of Stedman triples, composed by the late Thomas  Thurstans, and consisting of 5,040 changes, in 2 hours and 52 minutes.  The St. Martin's ringers officiated.    The six bells of Northfield Church were cast by Joseph Smith, of  Edgbaston, in 1730.    St. Chad's Cathedral has eight bells, five of which were presented in  1848 as a memorial to Dr. Moore; the other three, from the foundry of W.  Blews and Sons, were hung in March, 1877 the peculiar ceremony of  \"blessing the bells\" being performed by Bishop Ullathorne on the 22nd of  that month. The three cost L110. The bells at Erdington Catholic Church  were first used on February 2, 1878.    ~Bellows to Mend.~--Our townspeople bellowed a little over their losses  after Prince Rupert's rueful visit, but there was one among them who  knew how to \"raise the wind,\" for we find Onions, the bellows-maker,  hard at work in 1650; and his descendants keep at the same old game.    ~Bennett's Hill.~--There was a walled-in garden (with an old brick  summer-house) running up from Waterloo-street to Colmore-row as late as  1838-9.    ~Benefit and Benevolent Societies.~--See \"_Friendly Societies_.\"    ~Bellbarn Road~, or the road to Mr. Bell's barn.    ~Bermingham.~--The Irish family of this name descended from Robert, son  of Peter de Bermingham, who left here and settled in Connaught about the  year 1169.    ~Bibles and Testaments.~--In 1272 the price of a Bible, well written  out, was L30 sterling, and there were few readers of it in Birmingham.  The good book can now be bought for 6d., and it is to be hoped there is  one in every house. The Rev. Angell James once appealed to his  congregation for subscriptions towards sending a million New Testaments  to China, and the Carrslaneites responded promptly with L410 8s., enough  to pay for 24,624 copies--the publisher's price being 4d. each. They can  be bought for a penny now.--A local Auxiliary Bible Society was  commenced here May 9, 1806.    ~Bingley Hall~--Takes its name from Bingley House, on the site of which  it is built. It was erected in 1850 by Messrs. Branson and Gwyther, at a  cost of about L6,000, the proprietary shares being L100 each. In form it  is nearly a square, the admeasurements being 224 ft. by 212 ft., giving  an area of nearly one acre and a half. There are ten entrance doors,  five in King Edward's Place, and five in King Alfred's Place, and the  building may be easily divided into five separate compartments. The Hall  will hold from 20,000 to 25,000 people, and is principally used for  Exhibitions and Cattle Shows; with occasionally \"monster meetings,\" when  it is considered necessary for the welfare of the nation to save sinners  or convert Conservatives.    ~Bird's-eye View~ of the town can"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14473"],[0,"Birds of Guernsey (1879) (#8)"],[1,"ever,  make their appearance in each of the Islands every autumn, but they are  never very numerous, and do not remain very long, arriving generally  about the end of September and remaining till the end of November or  beginning of December, during which time a few may always be seen hung  up in the market. Many of the autumnal arrivals are young birds of the  year, with the white crescent on the breast nearly wanting or only very  faintly marked.    Mr. Gallienne, in his remarks appended to Professor Ansted's list, says  the Ring Ouzel stays with us throughout the year, but is more plentiful  in winter than in summer. But I have never myself seen one either dead  or alive in the spring or summer. It may, however, occasionally visit  the Island in the spring migration, but I know of no authentic instance  of its remaining to breed, nor have I seen the eggs in any Guernsey  collection. I have seen specimens of the Ring Ouzel from Alderney, and  it appears to me about equally common at the same time of year in all  the Islands. Mr. MacCulloch, however, writes to me:--\"From what I have  heard the Ring Ouzel is more common in Alderney than Guernsey, where it  is seen mostly on the southern cliffs.\" The south end of the Island is  no doubt its favourite resort in Guernsey. As far as Alderney is  concerned Captain Hubback, R.A., who has been quartered there at  different times, says he has never seen one there; but I do not think he  has been much there in the early autumn.    Professor Ansted includes it in his list, and marks it as occurring in  Guernsey and Sark. There are several, both male and female and young, in  the Guernsey Museum.      28. HBDGESPARROW. _Accentor modularis_, Linnaeus. French, \"Mouchet,\"  \"Traine buisson,\" \"Accenteur mouchet.\"--The Hedgesparrow is, I think,  quite as common as in England, and resident throughout the year in all  the Islands. According to Mr. Metivier's 'Dictionary' its local name is  \"Verdeleu,\" and he describes it as \"Oiseau qui couvre les oeufs de  Coucou.\" In Guernsey, however, Cuckoos are much too numerous for the  Hedgesparrow to afford accommodation for them all.    Professor Ansted mentions the Hedgesparrow in his list, but restricts  it to Guernsey and Sark. I have, however, frequently seen it in Alderney  and Herm, and the little Island of Jethou.      29. ROBIN. _Ericathus rubecula_, Linnaeus. French. \"Bec-fin  rouge-gorge,\" \"Rouge gorge.\" The Robin, like the Hedgesparrow, is a  common resident in all the Islands, and I cannot find that its numbers  are increased at any time of year by migration. But on the other hand I  should think a good many of the young must be driven off to seek  quarters elsewhere by their most pugnacious parents, for of all birds  the Robin is by far the most pugnacious with which I am acquainted, and  deserves the name of \"pugnax\" much more than the Ruff, and in a limited  space like Jethou and Herm battles between the old and the young would  be constant unless some of the young departed altogether from the  Island.    Professor Ansted includes the Robin in his list, but, as with the  Hedgesparrow, only mentions it as occurring in Guernsey and Sark. It is,  however, equally common in Alderney, Jethou, and Herm.      30. REDSTART. _Ruticilla phoenicurus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Rouge-queue,\"  \"Bec-fin des murailles.\"--I should not have included the Redstart in  this list, as I have never seen it in the Islands myself, but on  sending a list of the birds I intended to include to Mr. MacCulloch, he  wrote to say--\"You mention Tithy's Redstart; the common one is also seen  here.\" In consequence of this information I looked very sharply out for  the birds during the two months (June and July) which I was in Guernsey  this year (1878), but I never once saw the bird in any of the Islands,  nor could I find any one who had; and such a conspicuous and generally  well known bird could hardly have escaped observation had it been in the  Island in any numbers. I may add that I have had the same bad luck in  all my former visits to the Islands, and never seen a Redstart. I  suppose, however, from Mr. MacCulloch's note that it occasionally visits  the Islands for a short time on migration, very few, if any, remaining  to breed.    It is included in Professor Ansted's list, but only marked as occurring  in Guernsey. There is, however, no specimen at present in the Museum.      31. BLACK REDSTART. _Ruticilla titys_, Scopoli. French, \"Rouge queue  Tithys.\"--The Black, or Tithys Redstart, as it is sometimes called, is a  regular and by no means uncommon autumnal visitant to Guernsey. It seems  very much to take the place of the Wheatear, arriving about the time the  Wheatear departs, and mostly frequenting the same places. In Guernsey  it is most common near the sea about the low part of the Island, from  L'ancresse Common to Perrelle Bay. In habits it puts one very much in  mind of the Wheatear, being very fond, like that bird, of selecting some  big stone or some other conspicuous place to perch on and keep a  look-out either for intruders or for some passing insect, either flying  or creeping, for it is an entirely insect-feeding bird.    I have never seen the Black Redstart about the high part of the Island  amongst the rocks, which I am rather surprised at, as in the south coast  of Devon it seems particularly partial to high cliffs and rocks, such as  the Parson and Clerk Rock near Teignmouth; but in Guernsey the wild  grassy commons, with scattered rocks and large boulders, and  occasionally a rough pebbly beach, especially the upper part of it where  the pebbles join the grass, seem more the favourite resort of this bird  than the high rocks, such places probably being more productive of food.  It is of course quite useless to look for this bird in the interior of  the Island in gardens and orchards, and such places as one would  naturally look for the Common Redstart.    The male Black Redstart may be immediately distinguished from the Common  Redstart by the black breast and belly, and by the absence of the white  mark on the forehead. The male Black Redstart has also a white patch on  the wing caused by the pale, nearly white, margins of the feathers. The  females are more alike, but still may easily be distinguished, the  general colour of the female Black Redstart being much duller--a dull  smoke-brown instead of the reddish brown of the Common Redstart.    Some slight variations of plumage take place in the Black Redstart at  different ages and seasons, which have led to some little difficulties,  and to another supposed species, _Ruticilla cairii_ of Gerbe being  suggested, but apparently quite without reason. I have never seen the  Black Redstart in the Islands at any time of year except the autumn, and  do not know of its occurrence at any other time.    Professor Ansted includes it in his list, but gives no locality; and  there is no specimen in the Museum.      32. STONECHAT. _Pratincola rubicola_, Linnaeus. French, \"Tarier  rubicole,\" \"Traquet patre,\" \"Traquet rubicole.\"--The Stonechat is a  numerous and regular summer visitant, breeding in all the Islands, but I  do not think any remain throughout the winter; of course a few scattered  birds may occasionally do so in some sheltered locality, but I have  never seen one in the Islands as late as November. Both in the Vale and  on the Cliffs in the higher part of the Island the Stonechat is very  common, and the gay little bird, with its bright plumage and sprightly  manner, may be seen on the top of every furze bush, or on a conspicuous  twig in a hedge in the wilder parts of the Island, but is not so common  in the inland and more cultivated parts, being less frequently seen on  the hedges by the roadside than it is here, Somersetshire, or in many  counties in England. In Alderney it is quite as common as in Guernsey,  and I saw two nests this year (1878) amongst the long grass growing on  the earthworks near the Artillery Barracks; it is equally common also  both in Jethou, Sark, and Herm.    There were a great many Stonechats in the Vale when I was there this  year (1878). Generally they seemed earlier in their breeding proceedings  than either Wheatears, Tree Pipits, or Sky Larks, which were the three  other most numerous birds about that part of the Island, as there were  several young ones about when we first went to live in the Vale early in  June; still occasionally nests with eggs more or less hard sat might be  found, but the greater number were hatched when fresh eggs of Tree  Pipits and Sky Larks were by no means uncommon.    Professor Ansted includes the Stonechat in his list, but marks it as  confined to Guernsey and Sark. There is a specimen in the Museum.    33. WHINCHAT. _Pratincola rubetra_, Linnaeus. French, \"Tarier  ordinaire,\" \"Traquet tarier.\"--The Whinchat seems to me never so  numerous as the Stonechat, and more local in its distribution during the  time it is in the Islands. It is only a summer visitant, and I doubt if  it always remains to breed, though it certainly does so occasionally, as  I have seen it in Guernsey through June and July mostly in the south  part of the Island, near Pleimont. In my last visit to the Islands,  however, in June and July, 1878, I did not see the Whinchat anywhere,  neither did I see one when there in June, 1876.    Professor Ansted includes the Whinchat in his list, and marks it as  occurring in Guernsey and Sark. There is no specimen in the Museum.      34. WHEATEAR. _Saxicola Oenanthe,_ Linnaeus. French, \"Motteux cul  blanc,\" \"Traquet moteux.\"--A very common summer visitant to all the  Islands, arriving in March and departing again in October, none  remaining through the winter--at least, I have never seen a Wheatear in  the Islands as late as November on any occasion. In the Vale, where a  great many breed, the young began to make their appearance out of the  nest and flying about, but still fed by their parents, about the"]]]
