An ox would have been ill in two days after the biting on the 7th.    A carrier stole a shirt, and went off unsuspected; when the loss was  ascertained, the man's companions tracked him with Ben Ali by night,  got him in his hut, and then collected the headmen of the village, who  fined him about four times the value of what had been stolen. They  came back in the morning without seeming to think that they had done  aught to be commended; this was the only case of theft we had noticed,  and the treatment showed a natural sense of justice.    _24th April, 1866._--We had showers occasionally, but at night all the  men were under cover of screens. The fevers were speedily cured; no  day was lost by sickness, but we could not march more than a few  miles, owing to the slowness of the sepoys; they are a heavy drag on  us, and of no possible use, except when acting as sentries at night.    When in the way between Kendany and Rovuma, I observed a plant here,  called _Mandare_, the root of which is in taste and appearance like a  waxy potato; I saw it once before at the falls below the Barotse  Valley, in the middle of the continent; it had been brought there by  an emigrant, who led out the water for irrigation, and it still  maintained its place in the soil. Would this not prove valuable in the  soil of India? I find that it is not cultivated further up the country  of the Makonde, but I shall get Ali to secure some for Bombay.    _25th April, 1866._--A serpent bit Jack, our dog, above the eye, the  upper eyelid swelled very much, but no other symptoms appeared, and  next day all swelling was gone; the serpent was either harmless, or  the quantity of poison injected very small. The pace of the camels is  distressingly slow, and it suits the sepoys to make it still slower  than natural by sitting down to smoke and eat. The grass is high and  ground under it damp and steamy.    _26th April, 1866._--On the 25th we reached Narri, and resolved to  wait the next day and buy food, as it is not so plentiful in front;  the people are eager traders in meal, fowls, eggs, and honey; the  women are very rude. Yesterday I caught a sepoy, Pando, belabouring a  camel with a big stick as thick as any part of his arm, the path being  narrow, it could not get out of his way; I shouted to him to desist;  he did not know I was in sight, to-day the effect of the bad usage is  seen in the animal being quite unable to move its leg: inflammation  has set up in the hip-joint. I am afraid that several bruises which  have festered on the camels, and were to me unaccountable, have been  wilfully bestowed. This same Pando and another left Zanzibar drunk: he  then stole a pair of socks from me, and has otherwise been perfectly  useless, even a pimple on his leg was an excuse for doing nothing for  many days. We had to leave this camel at Narri under charge of the  headman.    _28th April, 1866._--The hills on the north now retire out of our  sight. A gap in the southern plateau gives passage to a small river,  which arises in a lakelet of some size, eight or ten miles inland: the  river and lakelet are both called Nangadi; the latter is so broad that  men cannot be distinguished, even by the keen eyes of the natives on  the other side: it is very deep, and abounds in large fish; the people  who live there are Mabiha. A few miles above this gap the southern  highland falls away, and there are lakelets on marshes, also  abounding in fish, an uninhabited space next succeeds, and then we  have the Matambwe country, which extends up to Ngomano. The Matambwe  seem to be a branch of the Makonde, and a very large one: their  country extends a long way south, and is well stocked with elephants  and gum-copal trees.    They speak a language slightly different from that of the Makonde, but  they understand them. The Matambwe women are, according to Ali, very  dark, but very comely, though they do wear the lip-ring. They carry  their ivory, gum-copal, and slaves to Ibo or Wibo.    _29th April, 1866._--We spend Sunday, the 29th, on the banks of the  Rovuma, at a village called Nachuchu, nearly opposite Konayumba, the  first of the Matambwe, whose chief is called Kimbembe. Ali draws a  very dark picture of the Makonde. He says they know nothing of a  Deity, they pray to their mothers when in distress or dying; know  nothing of a future state, nor have they any religion except a belief  in medicine; and every headsman is a doctor. No Arab has ever tried to  convert them, but occasionally a slave taken to the coast has been  circumcised in order to be clean; some of them pray, and say they know  not the ordeal or muavi. The Nassick boys failed me when I tried to  communicate some knowledge through them. They say they do not  understand the Makonde language, though some told me that they came  from Ndonde's, which is the head-quarters of the Makonde. Ali says  that the Makonde blame witches for disease and death; when one of a  village dies, the whole population departs, saying \"that is a bad  spot.\" They are said to have been notorious for fines, but an awe has  come over them, and no complaints have been made, though our animals  in passing the gardens have broken a good deal of corn. Ali says they  fear the English. This is an answer to my prayer for influence on the  minds of the heathen. I regret that I cannot speak to them that good  of His name which I ought.    I went with the Makonde to see a specimen of the gum-copal tree in the  vicinity of this village. The leaves are in pairs, glossy green, with  the veins a little raised on both face and back; the smaller branches  diverge from the same point: the fruit, of which we saw the shells,  seems to be a nut; some animal had in eating them cut them through.  The bark of the tree is of a light ash colour; the gum was oozing from  the bark at wounded places, and it drops on the ground from branches;  it is thus that insects are probably imbedded in the gum-copal. The  people dig in the vicinity of modern trees in the belief that the more  ancient trees which dropped their gum before it became an article of  commerce must have stood there. \"In digging, none may be found on one  day but God (Mungu) may give it to us on the next.\" To this all the  Makonde present assented, and showed me the consciousness of His  existence was present in their minds. The Makonde get the gum in large  quantities, and this attracts the coast Arabs, who remain a long time  in the country purchasing it. Hernia humoralis abounds; it is ascribed  to beer-drinking.    _30th April, 1866._--Many ulcers burst forth on the camels; some seem  old dhow bruises. They come back from pasture, bleeding in a way that  no rubbing against a tree would account for. I am sorry to suspect  foul play: the buffaloes and mules are badly used, but I cannot be  always near to prevent it.    Bhang[8] is not smoked, but tobacco is: the people have no sheep or  goats; only fowls, pigeons, and Muscovy ducks are seen. Honey is very  cheap; a good large pot of about a gallon, with four fowls, was given  for two yards of calico. Buffaloes again bitten by tsetse, and by  another fly exactly like the house-fly, but having a straight hard  proboscis instead of a soft one; other large flies make the blood run.  The tsetse does not disturb the buffaloes, but these others and the  smaller flies do. The tsetse seem to like the camel best; from these  they are gorged with blood--they do not seem to care for the mules and  donkeys.

It is beautiful to get a good glimpse out on the surrounding  scenery, though it still seems nearly all covered with great masses of  umbrageous foliage, mostly of a dark green colour, for nearly all of  the individual trees possess dark glossy leaves like laurel. We passed  a gigantic specimen of the Kumbe, or gum-copal tree. Kumba means to  dig. Changkumbe, or things dug, is the name of the gum; the Arabs call  it \"sandaruse.\" Did the people give the name Kumbe to the tree after  the value of the gum became known to them? The Malole, from the fine  grained wood of which all the bows are made, had shed its fruit on the  ground; it looks inviting to the eye--an oblong peach-looking thing,  with a number of seeds inside, but it is eaten by maggots only.    When we came to Ntande's village, we found it enclosed in a strong  stockade, from a fear of attack by Mabiha, who come across the river  and steal their women when going to draw water: this is for the Ibo  market. They offered to pull down their stockade and let us in if we  would remain over-night, but we declined.

By identifying the monarchy with the charters, it skilfully  retraced the false step which it had taken. Under the aegis of the Roman  see the national spirit grew, and the next generation was to see the  temper fostered by Gualo in its turn grow impatient of the papal  supremacy. It was Gualo, then, who secured the confirmation of the  charters. Even Louis unconsciously worked in that direction, for, had he  not gained so strong a hold on the country, there would have been no  reason to adopt a policy of conciliation. We must not read the history  of this generation in the light of modern times, or even with the eyes  of Matthew Paris.        [1] Grosseteste, _Epistolae_, p. 339.    The marshal had before him a task essentially similar to that which  Henry II had undertaken after the anarchy of Stephen's reign. It was  with the utmost difficulty that the sum promised to Louis could be  extracted from the war-stricken and famished tillers of the soil. The  exchequer was so empty that the Christmas court of the young king was  celebrated at the expense of Falkes de Breaute. Those who had fought  for the king clamoured for grants and rewards, and it was necessary to  humour them. For example, Randolph of Blundeville, with the earldom of  Lincoln added to his Cheshire palatinate and his Lancashire Honour, had  acquired a position nearly as strong as that of the Randolph of the  reign of Stephen. \"Adulterine castles\" had grown up in such numbers  that the new issue of the Charter insisted upon their destruction. Even  the lawful castles were held by unauthorised custodians, who refused to  yield them up to the king's officers. Though Alexander, King of Scots,  purchased his reconciliation with Rome by abandoning Carlisle and  performing homage to Henry, the Welsh remained recalcitrant. One  chieftain, Morgan of Caerleon, waged war against the marshal in Gwent,  and was dislodged with difficulty. During the war Llewelyn ap Iorwerth  conquered Cardigan and Carmarthen from the marchers, and it was only  after receiving assurances that he might retain these districts so long  as the king's minority lasted that he condescended to do homage at  Worcester in March, 1218.    In the following May Stephen Langton came back from exile and threw the  weight of his judgment on the regent's side. Gradually the worst  difficulties were surmounted. The administrative machinery once more  became effective. A new seal was cast for the king, whose documents had  hitherto been stamped with the seal of the regent. Order was so far  restored that Gualo returned to Italy. He was a man of high character  and noble aims, caring little for personal advancement, and curbing his  hot zeal against \"schismatics\" in his desire to restore peace to  England. His memory is still commemorated in his great church of St.  Andrew, at Vercelli, erected, it may be, with the proceeds of his  English benefices, and still preserving the manuscript of legends of  its patron saint, which its founder had sent thither from his exile.    At Candlemas, 1219, the aged regent was smitten with a mortal illness.  His followers bore him up the Thames from London to his manor of  Caversham, where his last hours were disturbed by the intrigues of  Peter of Winchester for his succession, and the importunity of selfish  clerks, clamouring for grants to their churches. He died on May 14,  clad in the habit of the Knights of the Temple, in whose new church in  London his body was buried, and where his effigy may still be seen. The  landless younger son of a poor baron, he had supported himself in his  youth by the spoils of the knights he had vanquished in the  tournaments, where his successes gained him fame as the model of  chivalry. The favour of Henry, the \"young king,\" gave him political  importance, and his marriage with Strongbow's daughter made him a  mighty man in England, Ireland, Wales, and Normandy. Strenuous and  upright, simple and dignified, the young soldier of fortune bore easily  the weight of office and honour which accrued to him before the death  of his first patron. Limited as was his outlook, he gave himself  entirely to his master-principle of loyally to the feudal lord whom he  had sworn to obey. This simple conception enabled him to subordinate  his interests as a marcher potentate to his duty to the English  monarchy. It guided him in his difficult work of serving with unbending  constancy a tyrant like John. It shone most clearly when in his old age  he saved John's son from the consequences of his father's misdeeds. A  happy accident has led to the discovery in our own days of the long  poem, drawn up in commemoration of his career[1] at the  instigation of his son. This important work has enabled us to enter  into the marshal's character and spirit in much the same way as  Joinville's _History of St. Louis_ has made us familiar with the  motives and attributes of the great French king. They are the two men  of the thirteenth century whom we know most intimately. It is well that  the two characters thus portrayed at length represent to us so much of  what is best in the chivalry, loyalty, statecraft, and piety of the  Middle Ages.        [1] _Histoire de Guillaume le Marechal_, published by P. Meyer      for the Soc. de l'histoire de France. Petit-Dutaillis, _Etude      sur Louis VIII._ (1894), and G.J. Turner, _Minority of Henry      III._, part i, in _Transactions of the Royal Hist. Soc._, new      ser., viii. (1904), 245-95, are the best modern commentaries on      the history of the marshal's regency.          CHAPTER II.    THE RULE OF HUBERT DE BURGH.      William Marshal had recognized that the regency must end with him.  \"There is no land,\" he declared, \"where the people are so divided as  they are in England. Were I to hand over the king to one noble, the  others would be jealous. For this reason I have determined to entrust  him to God and the pope. No one can blame me for this, for, if the land  is not defended by the pope, I know no one who can protect it.\" The  fortunate absence of Randolph of Chester on crusade made it easy to  carry out this plan. Accordingly the king of twelve years was supposed  to be capable of acting for himself. But the ultimate authority resided  with the new legate Pandulf, who, without any formal designation, was  the real successor of the marshal. This arrangement naturally left  great power to Peter des Roches, who continued to have the custody of  the king's person, and to Hubert the justiciar, who henceforth acted as  Pandulf's deputy. Next to them came the Archbishop of Canterbury.  Langton's share in the struggle for the charters was so conspicuous,  that we do not always remember that it was as a scholar and a  theologian that he acquired his chief reputation among his  contemporaries. On his return from exile he found such engrossing  occupation in the business of his see, that he took little part in  politics for several years. His self-effacement strengthened the  position of the legate.    Pandulf was no stranger to England. As subdeacon of the Roman Church he  received John's submission in 1213, and stood by his side during nearly  all his later troubles. He had been rewarded by his election to the  bishopric of Norwich, but was recalled to Rome before his consecration,  and only came back to England in the higher capacity of legate on  December 3, 1218, after the recall of Gualo. He had been the cause of  Langton's suspension, and there was probably no love lost between him  and the archbishop. It was in order to avoid troublesome questions of  jurisdiction that Pandulf, at the pope's suggestion, continued to  postpone his consecration as bishop, since that act would have  subordinated him to the Archbishop of Canterbury. But neither he nor  Langton was disposed to push matters to extremities. Just as Peter des  Roches balanced Hubert de Burgh, so the archbishop acted as a makeweight  to the legate. When power was thus nicely equipoised, there was a  natural tendency to avoid conflicting issues. In these circumstances the  truce between parties, which had marked the regency, continued for the  first years after Earl William's death. In all doubtful points the will  of the legate seems to have prevailed. Pandulf's correspondence shows  him interfering in every matter of state. He associated himself with the  justiciar in the appointment of royal officials; he invoked the papal  authority to put down \"adulterine castles,\" and to prevent any baron  having more than one royal stronghold in his custody; he prolonged the  truce with France, and strove to pacify the Prince of North Wales; he  procured the resumption of the royal domain, and rebuked Bishop Peter  and the justiciar for remissness in dealing with Jewish usurers; he  filled up bishoprics at his own discretion. Nor did he neglect his own  interests; his kinsfolk found preferment in his English diocese, and he  appropriated certain livings for the payment of his debts, \"so far as  could be done without offence\". But in higher matters he pursued a wise  policy. In recognising that the great interest of the Church was peace,  he truly expressed the policy of the mild Honorius. For more than two  years he kept Englishmen from flying at each other's throats. If they  paid for peace by the continuance of foreign rule, it was better to be  governed by Pandulf than pillaged by Falkes. The principal events of  these years were due to papal initiative.[1] Honorius looked askance on  the maimed rites of the Gloucester coronation, and ordered a new  hallowing to take place at the accustomed place and with the accustomed  ceremonies. This supplementary rite was celebrated at Westminster on  Whitsunday, May 17, 1220."]]]
