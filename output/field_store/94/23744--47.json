A magnificent water oak  shaded the vine-covered porch where a rocking chair and swing offered a  comfortable place to rest.    \"Good mornin', Miss,\" was the smiling greeting of the aged Negro man who  answered a knock on the front door. \"How is you? Won't you come in? I  would ax you to have a cheer on the porch, but I has to stay in de house  cause de light hurts my eyes.\" He had hastily removed a battered old  felt hat, several sizes too large for him, and as he shuffled down the  hall his hair appeared almost white as it framed his black face. His  clean, but faded blue overalls and shirt were patched in several places  and heavy brogans completed his costume. The day was hot and humid and  he carefully placed two chairs where they would have the advantage of  any breeze that might find its way through the open hallway.    \"Miss, I'se mighty glad you come today,\" he began, \"cause I does git so  lonesome here by myself. My old 'oman wuks up to de court'ouse, cookin'  for de folkses in jail, and it's allus late when she gits back home.  'Scuse me for puttin' my old hat back on, but dese old eyes jus' can't  stand de light even here in the hall, less I shades 'em.\"    When asked to tell the story of his life, he chuckled. \"Lawsy, Missy,\"  he said. \"Does you mean dat you is willin' to set here and listen to old  Neal talk? 'Tain't many folkses what wants to hear us old Niggers talk  no more. I jus' loves to think back on dem days 'cause dem was happy  times, so much better'n times is now. Folkses was better den. Dey was  allus ready to holp one another, but jus' look how dey is now!    \"I was borned on Marster Frank Upson's place down in Oglethorpe County,  nigh Lexin'ton, Georgy. Marster had a plantation, but us never lived dar  for us stayed at de home place what never had more'n 'bout 80 acres of  land 'round it. Us never had to be trottin' to de sto' evvy time us  started to cook, 'cause what warn't raised on de home place, Marster had  'em raise out on de big plantation. Evvything us needed t'eat and wear  was growed on Marse Frank's land.    \"Harold and Jane Upson was my Daddy and Mammy; only folkses jus' called  Daddy 'Hal.' Both of 'em was raised right der on de Upson place whar dey  played together whilst dey was chillun. Mammy said she had washed and  sewed for Daddy ever since she was big enough, and when dey got grown  dey jus' up and got married. I was deir only boy and I was de baby  chile, but dey had four gals older'n me. Dey was: Cordelia, Anna,  Parthene, and Ella. Ella was named for Marse Frank's onliest chile,  little Miss Ellen, and our little Miss was sho a good little chile.    \"Daddy made de shoes for all de slaves on de plantation and Mammy was  called de house 'oman. She done de cookin' up at de big 'ouse, and made  de cloth for her own fambly's clothes, and she was so smart us allus had  plenty t'eat and wear. I was little and stayed wid Mammy up at de big  'ouse and jus' played all over it and all de folkses up der petted me.  Aunt Tama was a old slave too old to wuk. She was all de time cookin'  gingerbread and hidin' it in a little trunk what sot by de fireplace in  her room. When us chillun was good Aunt Tama give us gingerbread, but if  us didn't mind what she said, us didn't git none. Aunt Tama had de  rheumatiz and walked wid a stick and I could git in dat trunk jus' 'bout  anytime I wanted to. I sho' did git 'bout evvything dem other chillun  had, swappin' Aunt Tama's gingerbread. When our white folkses went off,  Aunt Tama toted de keys, and she evermore did make dem Niggers stand  'round. Marse Frank jus' laughed when dey made complaints 'bout her.    \"In summertime dey cooked peas and other veg'tables for us chillun in a  washpot out in de yard in de shade, and us et out of de pot wid our  wooden spoons. Dey jus' give us wooden bowls full of bread and milk for  supper.    \"Marse Frank said he wanted 'em to larn me how to wait on de white  folkses' table up at de big 'ouse, and dey started me off wid de job of  fannin' de flies away. Mist'ess Serena, Marse Frank's wife, made me a  white coat to wear in de dinin' room. Missy, dat little old white coat  made me git de onliest whuppin' Marse Frank ever did give me.\" Here old  Neal paused for a hearty laugh. \"Us had comp'ny for dinner dat day and I  felt so big showin' off 'fore 'em in dat white coat dat I jus' couldn't  make dat turkey wing fan do right. Dem turkey wings was fastened on long  handles and atter Marster had done warned me a time or two to mind what  I was 'bout, the old turkey wing went down in de gravy bowl and when I  jerked it out it splattered all over de preacher's best Sunday suit.  Marse Frank got up and tuk me right out to de kitchen and when he got  through brushin' me off I never did have no more trouble wid dem turkey  wings.    \"Evvybody cooked on open fireplaces dem days. Dey had swingin' racks  what dey called cranes to hang de pots on for bilin'. Dere was ovens for  bakin' and de heavy iron skillets had long handles. One of dem old  skillets was so big dat Mammy could cook 30 biscuits in it at one time.  I allus did love biscuits, and I would go out in de yard and trade Aunt  Tama's gingerbread to de other chilluns for deir sheer of biscuits. Den  dey would be skeered to eat de gingerbread 'cause I told 'em I'd tell on  'em. Aunt Tama thought dey was sick and told Marse Frank de chilluns  warn't eatin' nothin'. He axed 'em what was de matter and dey told him  dey had done traded all deir bread to me. Marse Frank den axed me if I  warn't gittin' enough t'eat, 'cause he 'lowed dere was enough dar for  all. Den Aunt Tama had to go and tell on me. She said I was wuss dan a  hog atter biscuits, so our good Marster ordered her to see dat li'l Neal  had enough t'eat.    \"I ain't never gwine to forgit dat whuppin' my own daddy give me. He had  jus' sharpened up a fine new axe for hisself, and I traded it off to a  white boy named _Roar_ what lived nigh us when I seed him out tryin' to  cut wood wid a sorry old dull axe. I sold him my daddy's fine new axe  for 5 biscuits. When he found out 'bout dat, he 'lowed he was gwine to  give me somepin to make me think 'fore I done any more tradin' of his  things. Mist'eas, let me tell you, dat beatin' he give me evermore was  a-layin' on of de rod.    \"One day Miss Serena put me in de cherry tree to pick cherries for her,  and she told me not to eat none 'til I finished; den I could have all I  wanted, but I didn't mind her and I et so many cherries I got sick and  fell out of de tree. Mist'ess was skeered, but Marse Frank said: 'It's  good enough for him, 'cause he didn't mind.'    \"Mammy never did give me but one whuppin' neither. Daddy was gwine to de  circus and I jus' cut up 'bout it 'cause I wanted to go so bad. Mist'ess  give me some cake and I hushed long as I was eatin', but soon as de last  cake crumb was swallowed I started bawlin' again. She give me a stick of  candy and soon as I et dat I was squallin' wuss dan ever. Mammy told  Mist'ess den det she knowed how to quiet me and she retch under de bed  for a shoe. When she had done finished layin' dat shoe on me and put it  back whar she got it, I was sho willin' to shet my mouth and let 'em all  go to de circus widout no more racket from me.    \"De fust school I went to was in a little one-room 'ouse in our white  folkses' back yard. Us had a white teacher and all he larnt slave  chillun was jus' plain readin' and writin'. I had to pass Dr.  Willingham's office lots and he was all de time pesterin' me 'bout  spellin'. One day he stopped me and axed me if I could spell 'bumble bee  widout its tail,' and he said dat when I larnt to spell it, he would  gimme some candy. Mr. Sanders, at Lexin'ton, gimme a dime onct. It was  de fust money I ever had. I was plumb rich and I never let my Daddy have  no peace 'til he fetched me to town to do my tradin'. I was all sot to  buy myself a hat, a sto-bought suit of clothes, and some shoes what  warn't brogans, but Missy, I wound up wid a gingercake and a nickel's  wuth of candy. I used to cry and holler evvy time Miss Serena went off  and left me. Whenever I seed 'em gittin' out de carriage to hitch it up,  I started beggin' to go. Sometimes she laughed and said; 'All right  Neal.' But when she said, 'No Neal,' I snuck out and hid under de  high-up carrigge seat and went along jus' de same. Mist'ess allus found  me 'fore us got back home, but she jus' laughed and said: 'Well, Neal's  my little nigger anyhow.'    \"Dem old cord beds was a sight to look at, but dey slept good. Us  cyarded lint cotton into bats for mattresses and put 'em in a tick what  us tacked so it wouldn't git lumpy. Us never seed no iron springs dem  days. Dem cords, criss-crossed from one side of de bed to de other, was  our springs and us had keys to tighten 'em wid. If us didn't tighten 'em  evvy few days dem beds was apt to fall down wid us. De cheers was  homemade too and de easiest-settin' ones had bottoms made out of rye  splits. Dem oak-split cheers was all right, and sometimes us used cane  to bottom de cheers but evvybody laked to set in dem cheers what had  bottoms wove out of rye splits.    \"Marster had one of dem old cotton gins what didn't have no engines. It  was wuked by mules. Dem old mules was hitched to a long pole what dey  pulled 'round and 'round to make de gin do its wuk. Dey had some gins in  dem days what had treadmills for de mules to walk in. Dem old treadmills  looked sorter lak stairs, but most of 'em was turned by long poles what  de mules pulled. You had to feed de cotton by hand to dem old gins and  you sho had to be keerful or you was gwine to lose a hand and maybe a  arm. You had to jump in dem old cotton presses and tread de cotton down  by hand. It tuk most all day long to gin two bales of cotton and if dere  was three bales to be ginned us had to wuk most all night to finish up.    \"Dey mixed wool wid de"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18500"],[0,"The Complete Works of Robert Burns: Containing his Poems, Songs, and (#8)"],[1," where maidens love to be wooed. This rendered him dearer to woman's  heart than all the lyric effusions of his fancy; and when we add to  such allurements, a warm, flowing, and persuasive eloquence, we need  not wonder that woman listened and was won; that one of the most  charming damsels of the West said, an hour with him in the dark was  worth a lifetime of light with any other body; or that the  accomplished and beautiful Duchess of Gordon declared, in a latter  day, that no man ever carried her so completely off her feet as Robert  Burns.    It is one of the delusions of the poet's critics and biographers, that  the sources of his inspiration are to be found in the great classic  poets of the land, with some of whom he had from his youth been  familiar: there is little or no trace of them in any of his  compositions. He read and wondered--he warmed his fancy at their  flame, he corrected his own natural taste by theirs, but he neither  copied nor imitated, and there are but two or three allusions to Young  and Shakspeare in all the range of his verse. He could not but feel  that he was the scholar of a different school, and that his thirst was  to be slaked at other fountains. The language in which those great  bards embodied their thoughts was unapproachable to an Ayrshire  peasant; it was to him as an almost foreign tongue: he had to think  and feel in the not ungraceful or inharmonious language of his own  vale, and then, in a manner, translate it into that of Pope or of  Thomson, with the additional difficulty of finding English words to  express the exact meaning of those of Scotland, which had chiefly been  retained because equivalents could not be found in the more elegant  and grammatical tongue. Such strains as those of the polished Pope or  the sublimer Milton were beyond his power, less from deficiency of  genius than from lack of language: he could, indeed, write English  with ease and fluency; but when he desired to be tender or  impassioned, to persuade or subdue, he had recourse to the Scottish,  and he found it sufficient.    The goddesses or the Dalilahs of the young poet's song were, like the  language in which he celebrated them, the produce of the district; not  dames high and exalted, but lasses of the barn and of the byre, who  had never been in higher company than that of shepherds or ploughmen,  or danced in a politer assembly than that of their fellow-peasants, on  a barn-floor, to the sound of the district fiddle. Nor even of these  did he choose the loveliest to lay out the wealth of his verse upon:  he has been accused, by his brother among others, of lavishing the  colours of his fancy on very ordinary faces. \"He had always,\" says  Gilbert, \"a jealousy of people who were richer than himself; his love,  therefore, seldom settled on persons of this description. When he  selected any one, out of the sovereignty of his good pleasure, to whom  he should pay his particular attention, she was instantly invested  with a sufficient stock of charms out of the plentiful stores of his  own imagination: and there was often a great dissimilitude between his  fair captivator, as she appeared to others and as she seemed when  invested with the attributes he gave her.\" \"My heart,\" he himself,  speaking of those days, observes, \"was completely tinder, and was  eternally lighted up by some goddess or other.\" Yet, it must be  acknowledged that sufficient room exists for believing that Burns and  his brethren of the West had very different notions of the captivating  and the beautiful; while they were moved by rosy checks and looks of  rustic health, he was moved, like a sculptor, by beauty of form or by  harmony of motion, and by expression, which lightened up ordinary  features and rendered them captivating. Such, I have been told, were  several of the lasses of the West, to whom, if he did not surrender  his heart, he rendered homage: and both elegance of form and beauty of  face were visible to all in those of whom he afterwards sang--the  Hamiltons and the Burnets of Edinburgh, and the Millers and M'Murdos  of the Nith.    The mind of Burns took now a wider range: he had sung of the maidens  of Kyle in strains not likely soon to die, and though not weary of the  softnesses of love, he desired to try his genius on matters of a  sterner kind--what those subjects were he tells us; they were homely  and at hand, of a native nature and of Scottish growth: places  celebrated in Roman story, vales made famous in Grecian song--hills of  vines and groves of myrtle had few charms for him. \"I am hurt,\" thus  he writes in August, 1785, \"to see other towns, rivers, woods, and  haughs of Scotland immortalized in song, while my dear native county,  the ancient Baillieries of Carrick, Kyle, and Cunningham, famous in  both ancient and modern times for a gallant and warlike race of  inhabitants--a county where civil and religious liberty have ever  found their first support and their asylum--a county, the birth-place  of many famous philosophers, soldiers, and statesmen, and the scene of  many great events recorded in history, particularly the actions of the  glorious Wallace--yet we have never had one Scotch poet of any  eminence to make the fertile banks of Irvine, the romantic woodlands  and sequestered scenes of Ayr. and the mountainous source and winding  sweep of the Doon, emulate Tay, Forth, Ettrick, and Tweed. This is a  complaint I would gladly remedy, but, alas! I am far unequal to the  task, both in genius and education.\" To fill up with glowing verse the  outline which this sketch indicates, was to raise the long-laid spirit  of national song--to waken a strain to which the whole land would  yield response--a miracle unattempted--certainly unperformed--since  the days of the Gentle Shepherd. It is true that the tongue of the  muse had at no time been wholly silent; that now and then a burst of  sublime woe, like the song of \"Mary, weep no more for me,\" and of  lasting merriment and humour, like that of \"Tibbie Fowler,\" proved  that the fire of natural poesie smouldered, if it did not blaze; while  the social strains of the unfortunate Fergusson revived in the city,  if not in the field, the memory of him who sang the \"Monk and the  Miller's wife.\" But notwithstanding these and other productions of  equal merit, Scottish poesie, it must be owned, had lost much of its  original ecstasy and fervour, and that the boldest efforts of the  muse no more equalled the songs of Dunbar, of Douglas, of Lyndsay, and  of James the Fifth, than the sound of an artificial cascade resembles  the undying thunders of Corra.    To accomplish this required an acquaintance with man beyond what the  forge, the change-house, and the market-place of the village supplied;  a look further than the barn-yard and the furrowed field, and a  livelier knowledge and deeper feeling of history than, probably, Burns  ever possessed. To all ready and accessible sources of knowledge he  appears to have had recourse; he sought matter for his muse in the  meetings, religious as well as social, of the district--consorted with  staid matrons, grave plodding farmers--with those who preached as well  as those who listened--with sharp-tongued attorneys, who laid down the  law over a Mauchline gill--with country squires, whose wisdom was  great in the game-laws, and in contested elections--and with roving  smugglers, who at that time hung, as a cloud, on all the western coast  of Scotland. In the company of farmers and fellow-peasants, he  witnessed scenes which he loved to embody in verse, saw pictures of  peace and joy, now woven into the web of his song, and had a poetic  impulse given to him both by cottage devotion and cottage merriment.  If he was familiar with love and all its outgoings and incomings--had  met his lass in the midnight shade, or walked with her under the moon,  or braved a stormy night and a haunted road for her sake--he was as  well acquainted with the joys which belong to social intercourse, when  instruments of music speak to the feet, when the reek of punchbowls  gives a tongue to the staid and demure, and bridal festivity, and  harvest-homes, bid a whole valley lift up its voice and be glad. It is  more difficult to decide what poetic use he could make of his  intercourse with that loose and lawless class of men, who, from love  of gain, broke the laws and braved the police of their country: that  he found among smugglers, as he says, \"men of noble virtues,  magnanimity, generosity, disinterested friendship, and modesty,\" is  easier to believe than that he escaped the contamination of their  sensual manners and prodigality. The people of Kyle regarded this  conduct with suspicion: they were not to be expected to know that when  Burns ranted and housed with smugglers, conversed with tinkers huddled  in a kiln, or listened to the riotous mirth of a batch of \"randie  gangrel bodies\" as they \"toomed their powks and pawned their duds,\"  for liquor in Poosie Nansie's, he was taking sketches for the future  entertainment and instruction of the world; they could not foresee  that from all this moral strength and poetic beauty would arise.    While meditating something better than a ballad to his mistress's  eyebrow, he did not neglect to lay out the little skill he had in  cultivating the grounds of Mossgiel. The prosperity in which he found  himself in the first and second seasons, induced him to hope that good  fortune had not yet forsaken him: a genial summer and a good market  seldom come together to the farmer, but at first they came to Burns;  and to show that he was worthy of them, he bought books on  agriculture, calculated rotation of crops, attended sales, held the  plough with diligence, used the scythe, the reap-hook, and the flail,  with skill, and the malicious even began to say that there was  something more in him than wild sallies of wit and foolish rhymes. But  the farm lay high, the bottom was wet, and"]]]
