Mr. Frohman, Mr.  Vanderbilt, and my brother-in-law were drowned. When Mr. Frohman's body  was recovered there was the most beautiful and peaceful smile upon his  lips.      VANDERBILT'S HEROIC END.    [Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES.]    _LONDON, May 9.--Two survivors of the Lusitania disaster have given  testimony that Alfred G. Vanderbilt died heroically; that he went to  death to save the life of a woman._    _Thomas Slidell, a friend of Mr. Vanderbilt, who lives at the  Knickerbocker Club in New York, and was traveling with him, told of the  sacrifice first. Then tonight Norman Ratcliffe, who lives in Gillingham,  Kent, and was returning from Japan, offered verification. Mr. Ratcliffe  was rescued, after clinging to a box in the sea for three hours. With  him was a steward of the Lusitania. He said:_    This steward told me he had seen Mr. Vanderbilt on the Lusitania's deck,  shortly after the ship was struck, with a lifebelt about his body. When  the ship gave every indication that it would sink within a few minutes,  the steward said, Mr. Vanderbilt took off his lifebelt and gave it to a  woman who passed him on the deck, trembling with fear of the fate she  expected to meet. The steward said Mr. Vanderbilt turned back, as though  to look for another belt, and he saw him no more.    _Telling of his last moments on the ship and his last sight of Mr.  Vanderbilt, Mr. Slidell said:_    I saw Alfred G. Vanderbilt only a few minutes before I left the ship. He  was standing with a lifebelt in his hand. A woman came up to him, and I  saw him place the belt around the woman. He had none for himself, and I  know that he could not swim.    Only the day before we had been talking of a day and a dawn some years  ago when we went down the bay at New York in his yacht and waited to  welcome and dip our flag to the Lusitania on her maiden voyage. We saw  the first and last of her. Vanderbilt, who had given largely to the Red  Cross, was returning to England in order to offer a fleet of wagons and  himself as driver to the Red Cross Society, for he said he felt every  day that he was not doing enough.      KLEIN AND HUBBARD LOST.    _Oliver O. Bernard, scenic artist of Covent Garden, said:_    Only one or two of the shining marks which disasters at sea seem  invariably to involve have lived to tell the Lusitania's tale.  Vanderbilt, the sportsman, is gone. Genial Charles Klein, the  playwright, is gone. That erratic American literary genius, Elbert  Hubbard, is gone, and with him a wife to whom he seemed particularly  devoted. And Charles Frohman is gone.    Frohman's was the only body I could recognize in the Queenstown  mortuary, and perhaps it will interest his many friends in London and  New York to know that the famous manager's face in death gives  uncommonly convincing evidence that he died without a struggle. It wears  a serenely peaceful look.    Frohman must have found it more difficult for him to take his place in a  lifeboat than any other man on the ship. He was quite lame, and hobbled  about on deck laboriously with a heavy cane. He seldom came to the  general dining saloon, either out of sensitiveness or because of  distress caused by his leg.    I last saw Alfred G. Vanderbilt standing at the port entrance to the  grand saloon. He stood there the personification of sportsmanlike  coolness. In his right hand was grasped what looked to me like a large  purple leather jewel case. It may have belonged to Lady Mackworth, as  Mr. Vanderbilt had been much in company of the Thomas party during the  trip, and evidently had volunteered to do Lady Mackworth the service of  saving her gems for her. Mr. Vanderbilt was absolutely unperturbed. In  my eyes, he was the figure of a gentleman waiting unconcernedly for a  train. He had on a dark striped suit, and was without cap or other head  covering.          Germany Justifies the Deed      [It should be borne in mind that the subjoined official and  semi-official out-givings on behalf of Germany, announcing the  destruction of the Lusitania, justifying it, striving to implicate the  British Government, and to some extent modifying the original war zone  proclamation of Feb. 18, 1915, were published prior to the receipt by  the German Imperial Government of President Wilson's note of May 13.  British official rejoinders and a statement by the Collector of the Port  of New York are included under this head.--Editor.]      GERMAN OFFICIAL REPORT.    _BERLIN, May 8, (via wireless to London Sunday, May 9.)--The following  official communication was issued tonight:_    The Cunard liner Lusitania was yesterday torpedoed by a German submarine  and sank.    The Lusitania was naturally armed with guns, as were recently most of  the English mercantile steamers. Moreover, as is well known here, she  had large quantities of war material in her cargo.    Her owners, therefore, knew to what danger the passengers were exposed.  They alone bear all the responsibility for what has happened.    Germany, on her part, left nothing undone to repeatedly and strongly  warn them. The Imperial Ambassador in Washington even went so far as to  make a public warning, so as to draw attention to this danger. The  English press sneered at the warning and relied on the protection of the  British fleet to safeguard Atlantic traffic.      BRITAIN'S DENIAL.    _LONDON, May 8.--The British Government today made the following  announcement:_    The statement appearing in some newspapers that the Lusitania was armed  is wholly false.      COLLECTOR MALONE'S DENIAL.    _In_ THE NEW YORK TIMES _of May 9, 1915, the following report appeared:_    Dudley Field Malone, Collector of the Port, gave an official denial  yesterday to the German charge that the Lusitania had guns mounted when  the left this port on Saturday, May 1. He said:    \"This report is not correct. The Lusitania was inspected before sailing,  as is customary.    \"No guns were found, mounted or unmounted, and the vessel sailed without  any armament. No merchant ship would be allowed to arm in this port and  leave the harbor.\"    This statement was given out by the Collector yesterday morning at his  home, 270 Riverside Drive.    Herman Winter, Assistant Manager of the Cunard Line, 22 State Street,  who was on the Lusitania for three hours before she sailed for  Liverpool, denied the report that she ever carried any guns.    \"It is true,\" Mr. Winter said, \"that she had aboard 4,200 cases of  cartridges, but they were cartridges for small arms, packed in separate  cases, and could not have injured the vessel by exploding. They  certainly do not come under the classification of ammunition. The United  States authorities would not permit us to carry ammunition, classified  as such by the military authorities, on a passenger liner. For years we  have been sending small-arms cartridges abroad on the Lusitania.\"    [Illustration: SIR ROBERT BORDEN, K.C.M.G.    Prime Minister of Canada]    [Illustration: H.R.H. FIELD MARSHAL THE DUKE OF CONNAUGHT    Uncle of George V. and Governor General of Canada    _(Photo from P.S. Rogers.)_]    \"The Lusitania had 1,250 steel shrapnel cases, but they were empty.  There was no explosive of any sort aboard. As to the report that the  Lusitania had guns aboard, I cannot assert too strongly that it is  positively untrue. There were no guns whatever aboard. The Lusitania was  an unarmed passenger steamer. Furthermore she never has been armed, and  never carried an unmounted gun or rifle out of port in times of war or  peace.\"    \"Then you unqualifiedly declare that the Lusitania was not armed against  submarines?\" he was asked.    \"The ship,\" Mr Winter replied, \"was as defenseless against undersea and  underhanded attack as a Hoboken ferryboat in the North River would be  against one of the United States battleships.\"    Captain D.J. Roberts, Marine Superintendent of the Cunard Line, said  yesterday that he was prepared to testify under oath in any court and  from his personal knowledge that the Lusitania did not carry any guns  when she sailed from New York at 12:28 P.M. on May 1 for Liverpool.    \"It is my invariable custom to go through the passenger ships every day  they are in port,\" he said, \"and I made my last inspection of the  Lusitania on sailing day at 7 A.M. There were no guns or plates or  mountings where guns could be fitted on the Lusitania, nor have there  been since she has been in the service. The ship has never carried  troops or been chartered by the British Government for any purpose  whatsoever.    \"In order that there should be no mistake about the ensigns flown by  British merchant vessels, the Admiralty ordered after war had been  declared that only the red ensign, a square red flag with the union jack  in the corner, should be shown at the stern of a merchantman, and the  white St. George's ensign by all war vessels, whether armored or  unarmored. These are the only two flags that are hoisted on British  ships today, with the exception of the company's house flag, when they  are entering port or passing at sea, and the mail flag on the foremast,  which every steamship flies coming in to denote that she has mails on  board.    \"Before the war both the Lusitania and the Mauretania flew the blue  ensign of the Royal Naval Reserve, which any British merchant vessel is  allowed to do if her commander and officers and two-thirds of the crew  belong to the reserve.\"      NEUTRALS IN THE WAR ZONE.    [German Foreign Office Note.]    [Special to The New York Times.]    _WASHINGTON, May 11.--Secretary Bryan received from Ambassador Gerard at  Berlin today the text of an official declaration by the German  Government of its policy with respect to American and other neutral  ships meeting German submarines in the naval war zone around the British  Isles and in the North Sea. This declaration was handed to Mr. Gerard by  the German Foreign Office which explained that it was being issued as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15483"],[0,"Rambles and Recollections of an Indian Official (#8)"],[1,"to give to the great mass of those who have nothing but the  labour of their hands to depend upon for their subsistence! Let no  such fictions be believed, and the holidays and pastimes of the lower  orders in every country would soon cease, for they have almost  everywhere owed their origin and support to some religious dream  which has commanded the faith and influenced the conduct of great  masses of mankind, and prevented one man from presuming to work on  the day that another wished to rest from his labours. The people were  of opinion, they told me, that the Ganges, as a sacred stream, could  last only sixty years more, when the Nerbudda would take its place.  The waters of the Nerbudda are, they say already so much more sacred  than those of the Ganges that to see them is sufficient to cleanse  men from their sins, whereas the Ganges must be touched before it can  have that effect.[13]    At the temple built on the top of a conical hill at Bheraghat,  overlooking the river, is a statue of a bull carrying Siva, the god  of destruction, and his wife Parvati seated behind him; they have  both snakes in their hands, and Siva has a large one round his loins  as a waistband. There are several demons in human shape lying  prostrate under the belly of the bull, and the whole are well cut out  of one large slab of hard basalt from a dyke in the marble rock  beneath. They call the whole group 'Gauri Sankar', and I found in the  fair, exposed for sale, a brass model of a similar one from Jeypore  (Jaipur), but not so well shaped and proportioned. On noticing this  we were told that 'such difference was to be expected, since the  brass must have been made by man, whereas the \"Gauri Sankar\" of the  temple above was a real Pakhan, or a conversion of living beings into  stone by the gods;[14] they were therefore the exact resemblance of  living beings, while the others could only be rude imitations'.  'Gauri', or the Fair, is the name of Parvati, or Devi, when she  appears with her husband Siva. On such occasions she is always fair  and beautiful. Sankar is another name of Siva, or Mahadeo, or Rudra.  On looking into the temple at the statue, a lady expressed her  surprise at the entireness as well as the excellence of the figures,  while all round had been so much mutilated by the Muhammadans. 'They  are quite a different thing from the others', said a respectable old  landholder; 'they are a conversion of real flesh and blood into  stone, and no human hands can either imitate or hurt them.' She  smiled incredulously, while he looked very grave, and appealed to the  whole crowd of spectators assembled, who all testified to the truth  of what he had said; and added that 'at no distant day the figures  would be all restored to life again, the deities would all come back  without doubt and reanimate their old bodies again'.    All the people who come to bathe at the fair bring chaplets of yellow  jasmine, and hang them as offerings round the necks of the god and  his consort; and at the same time they make some small offerings of  rice to each of the many images that stand within the same apartment,  and also to those which, under a stone roof supported upon stone  pillars, line the inside of the wall that surrounds the circular  area, in the centre of which the temple stands. The images inside the  temple are those of the three great gods, Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva,  with their primaeval consorts;[15] but those that occupy the piazza  outside are the representations of the consorts of the different  incarnations of these three gods, and these consorts are themselves  the incarnations of the primaeval wives, who followed their husbands  in all their earthly ramblings. They have all the female form, and  are about the size of ordinary women, and extremely well cut out of  fine white and green sandstone; but their heads are those of the  animals in which their respective husbands became incarnate, such as  the lion, the elephant, &c., or those of the '_vahans_', or animals  on which they rode, such as the bull, the swan, the eagle, &c. But  these, I presume, are mere _capricios_ of the founder of the temple.  The figures are sixty-four in number, all mounted upon their  respective '_vahans_', but have been sadly mutilated by the pious  Muhammadans.[16]    The old 'Mahant', or high priest, told us that Mahadeo and his wife  were in reality our Adam and Eve; 'they came here together', said he,  'on a visit to the mountain Kailas,[17] and being earnestly solicited  to leave some memorial of their visit, got themselves turned into  stone'. The popular belief is that some very holy man, who had been  occupied on the top of this little conical hill, where the temple now  stands, in austere devotions for some few thousand years, was at last  honoured with a visit from Siva and his consort, who asked him what  they could do for him. He begged them to wait till he should bring  some flowers from the woods to make them a suitable offering. They  promised to do so, and he ran down, plunged into the Nerbudda and  drowned himself, in order that these august persons might for ever  remain and do honour to his residence and his name. They, however,  left only their 'mortal coil', but will one day return and resume it.  I know not whether I am singular in the notion or not, but I think  Mahadeo and his consort are really our Adam and Eve, and that the  people have converted them into the god and goddess of destruction,  from some vague idea of their original sin, which involved all their  race in destruction. The snakes, which form the only dress of  Mahadeo, would seem to confirm this notion.[18]      Notes:    1. The Nerbudda (Narbada, or Narmada) river is the boundary between  Hindustan, or Northern India, and the Deccan (Dakhin), or Southern  India. The beautiful gorge of the Marble Rocks, near Jubbulpore  (Jabalpur), is familiar to modern tourists (see _I.G._, 1908, s.v.  'Marble Rocks'). The remarkable antiquities at Bheraghat are  described and illustrated in _A.S.R._, vol. ix, pp. 60-76, pl. xii-  xvi. Additions and corrections to Cunningham's account will be found  in _A.S.W.I Progr. Rep._, 1893-4, p. 5; and _A.S. Ann. Rep., E.  Circle_, 1907-8, pp. 14-18.    2. The eighth month of the Hindoo luni-solar year, corresponding to  part of October and part of November. In Northern India the year  begins with the month Chait, in March. The most commonly used names  of the months are: (1) Chait; (2) Baisakh; (3) Jeth; (4) Asarh; (5)  Sawan; (6) Bhadon; (7) Kuar; (8) Kartik; (9) Aghan; (10) Pus; (II)  Magh; and (12) Phalgun.    3. _Bhagvan_ is often used as equivalent for the word God in its most  general sense, but is specially applicable to the Deity as manifested  in Vishnu the Preserver. _Asarh_ corresponds to June-July, _Patal_ is  the Hindoo Hades. Raja Bali is a demon, and Indra is the lord of the  heavens. The fairs take place at the time of full moon.    4. Barrackpore, fifteen miles north of Calcutta, is still a  cantonment. The Governor General has a country house there. The  mutiny of the native troops stationed there occurred on Nov. 1, 1824,  and was due to the discontent caused by orders moving the 47th Native  Infantry to Rangoon to take part in the Burmese War. The outbreak was  promptly suppressed. Captain Pogson published a _Memoir of the Mutiny  at Barrackpore_ (8vo, Serampore, 1833).    5. Ludiana, the capital of the district of the same name, now under  the Punjab Government. Hyphasis is the Greek name of the Bias river,  one of the five rivers of the Punjab.    6. Railways have rendered almost obsolete the mode of travelling  described in the text. In Northern India palankeens (palkis) are now  seldom used, even by Indians, except for purposes of ceremony.    7. This statement is no longer quite accurate, though fortified  positions are still very few.    8. The editor cannot find the exact passage quoted, but remarks to  the same effect will be found in _The Life of Sir Thomas Munro,_ by  the Rev. G. R. Gleig, in two volumes, a new edition (London, 1831),  vol. ii, p. 175.    9. _Narrative of a Journey through the Upper Provinces of India, from  Calcutta to Bombay, 1834-5, and a Journey to the Southern Provinces  in 1826_ (2nd edition, 3 vols. 8vo, London, 1828.)    10. The bees at the Marble Rocks are the _Apis dorsata_. An  Englishman named Biddington, when trying to escape from them, was  drowned, and they stung to death one of Captain Forsyth's baggage  ponies (Balfour, _Cyclopaedia of India,_ 3rd ed., 1885, s.v. Bee').    11. The vast epic poem, or collection of poems known as the  Mahabharata, consists of over 100,000 Sanskrit verses. The main  subject is the war between the five Pandavas, or sons of Pandu, and  their cousins the Kauravas, sons of Dhritarashtra. Many poems of  various origins and dates are interwoven with the main work. The best  known of the episodes is that of _Nala and Damayanti,_ which was well  translated by Dean Milman, See Macdonell, _A History of Sanskrit  Literature_ (Heinemann, 1900).    12. The five Pandava brothers were Yudhishthira, Bhimia, Arjuna,  Nakula, and Sahadeva, the children of Pandu, by his wives Kunti, or  Pritha, and Madri.    13. 'The Narbada has its special admirers, who exalt it oven above  the Ganges, . . . The sanctity of the Ganges will, they say, cease in  1895, whereas that of the Narbada will continue for ever' (Monier  Williams, _Religious Thought and Life in India,_ London, 1883, p.  348), See _post,_ Chapter 27.    14. Sleeman wrote 'Py-Khan', a corrupt spelling of pakhan, the  Sanskrit pashana or pasana, 'a stone'. The compound pashana-murti is  commonly used in the sense of 'stone image'. The sibilant _sh_ or _s_  usually is pronounced as _kh_ in Northern India (Grierson,  _J.R.A.S.,_ 1903, p. 363).    15. Sarasvati, consort of Brahma; Devi (Parvati, Durga, &c.), consort  of Siva; and Lakshmi, consort of Vishnu. All Hindoo deities have many  names."]]]
