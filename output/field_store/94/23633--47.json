SMITH. It tells me where to find the north. I turn the box this way,--I  turn the box that way. But the needle always shows the north to me.    POWHATAN. Why, so it does! It is very strange and wonderful!    A BRAVE. Will it tell the north at night?    SMITH. In the darkest night it tells you.    ANOTHER BRAVE. Will it tell the north on water?    SMITH. On river or on lake it tells you.    POWHATAN. Come, show me how to make it talk.    SMITH. Will you let me go in peace?    POWHATAN. You shall live and go in peace.    MEDICINE MAN. Great chief, is it wise to let so wise a man go from us?    POWHATAN. Is it your wish to keep him here?    MEDICINE MAN. There is no place for such a wise man.    POWHATAN. What do you mean?    MEDICINE MAN. Let him go, or let him stay, he will only make more wise  things.    POWHATAN. That is true.    MEDICINE MAN. Things too wise for Powhatan's braves. Things too wise for  Powhatan.    POWHATAN. What is that? Things too wise for Powhatan!    MEDICINE MAN. The white man makes talking needles. This needle shows the  north to him. Another needle may show him how to be chief in your  place, Powhatan.    A BRAVE. Yes, yes! That is true!    ALL BRAVES. Yes, yes!    MEDICINE MAN. He is too wise to live, great chief!    BRAVES.

I could not bear to have the little children killed.    SMITH. You have saved them and their mothers and their fathers. Me, you  have saved twice.    [_Pocahontas starts to go._]    POCAHONTAS. Good-by, white chief. I go now to my wigwam.    SMITH. Girl! Girl! You must not go! The braves will know you warned us!    POCAHONTAS. They will not know, white chief. At midnight they were to  leave the camp. I will get back by that time.    SMITH. It is midnight now. They have missed you by this time,  Pocahontas.    POCAHONTAS. What shall I do? What shall I do?    SMITH. You must stay with us.    POCAHONTAS. I cannot leave my father, white chief.    [_She starts to go._]    SMITH. You must not go! The braves will not let you live!

She has betrayed her own people!    SECOND BRAVE. We should never take her back to us!    THIRD BRAVE. We should not let her live!    MEDICINE MAN. Aye, braves, aye! We should not let her live! We will  demand her from the white men!    BRAVES. Yes, yes!    MEDICINE MAN. Shall we offer them peace in return for Pocahontas?    BRAVES. Yes, yes, yes!    MEDICINE MAN. Do you hear that, Chief Powhatan?    [_There is a long pause._]    POWHATAN. Go, take the peace flag to them, and ask for Pocahontas.    [_The_ MEDICINE MAN _raises a white flag and goes to the fort. Captain  Smith and many men come out._]    SMITH. Do you come to offer peace?    MEDICINE MAN. We offer peace, great chief, if you will give up  Pocahontas.    SMITH. And what if we will not give her up?    MEDICINE MAN. We will make war upon you.    SMITH. We will not give her up.    MEDICINE MAN. Then not a man of you shall live! Nor a woman! Nor a  child!    SMITH. Pocahontas is our friend. We will not give her up to you.    MEDICINE MAN. Shoot them, braves! Shoot them, as they stand there!    POWHATAN. Do not dare to shoot one arrow! I, Powhatan, speak.    (_To Smith._)    I see you are my daughter's friend, white chief.    SMITH. I am, and would be yours, if you would let me.    POWHATAN. Your white braves take our land from us.    SMITH. They shall pay you. As I am chief here, they shall pay you.    POWHATAN. Your white braves take our corn from us. They will not let us  fish in our own rivers.    SMITH. I did not know such wrongs were done you. My braves shall pay for  everything in full.    POWHATAN. Then there shall be peace between us. Bring the peace pipe,  braves. We will smoke in friendship with our brothers.    SMITH. And Pocahontas will be pardoned? You will take her back as your  own daughter?    POWHATAN. Pocahontas will be pardoned, white chief. She shall come and  go, as she may please, between our wigwams and yours, my brother.    _[A brave comes with the peace pipe, which he gives to Powhatan, who  hands it to Captain Smith._]    SMITH (_taking pipe_).

All is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16399"],[0,"A Winter Tour in South Africa (#8)"],[1," very high opinion of Bechuanaland as a cattle-grazing country.    The Waterburg warm sulphur baths--to which I paid a visit, taking a hot  bath myself, which was certainly much too hot for me, but which was  otherwise refreshing, after nearly a fortnight's residence on the veldt,  where there is a decided scarcity of water, both for drinking and  washing purposes--are situated about seventy miles north of Pretoria.  They are extensively patronised by the Boers, and are said to be most  efficacious in every variety of rheumatic and gouty complaints. They are  strongly impregnated with sulphur, and might be made very attractive in  the hands of anyone of enterprise, who would construct a suitable  establishment of baths, fit for patients who would be quite ready to pay  handsomely for them, instead of the miserably primitive and wretched  receptacles, called baths, into which the highly excellent natural  sulphur water is conveyed, and used by the motley crowd of invalids I  saw there.    From the Waterburg warm baths our route lay to the southward, across the  Springbok Flats, to the Nylstroom road, along which, in two days more,  we accomplished the intervening distance of about seventy miles back to  Pretoria, thus concluding a most interesting and instructive journey  into the northern part of the Transvaal. During all this time, with the  exception of the first night, I lived entirely in our wagon, sleeping in  it every night, and having every meal (which consisted principally of  the game we shot on the way), cooked at the various camp fires kindled  on the veldt, and drinking nothing but tea. I saw much, of course, of  the Kafirs in their kraals, as well as of the Boers in their tents and  wagons, in my trek through this wilderness.    [Illustration: Decorative]          [Illustration: Decorative]    PRETORIA TO NATAL.      After reaching Pretoria, I stayed only two days there, engaged in  bidding farewell to my numerous friends, and making preparations for my  next long journey into Natal. I left Pretoria for Johannesburg by coach,  on the 1st of August, and started from the latter town at five o'clock  in the morning of the 3rd, in very cold weather and pitch dark, by the  post cart. This most uncomfortable vehicle is a kind of wagonette, with  somewhat dilapidated canvas curtains, through which the wind whistled  most unpleasantly, being utterly insufficient to keep out the cold. It  is drawn by eight horses, and has cramped seats for eight or ten  passengers. On this occasion there were seven others besides myself. In  addition the mail bags were crammed inconveniently under the seats. In  this post cart I travelled for three days and two nights by way of  Richmond, Heidelburg, Standerton,--where cattle rearing and horse  breeding is successfully carried on,--and Newcastle, which will be  remembered as having been the base of operations during the Boer war,  and also as the place where the final treaty of Peace was drawn up and  signed by the joint Commission, to Eland's Laagte, the present terminus  of the Natal railway, thirteen miles beyond Ladysmith. At Eland's Laagte  a very promising coal field is being worked, from which great and  important results are expected in the future. Soon after crossing the  Transvaal border we passed the battle fields of Laing's Nek, Majuba  Hill, and Ingogo, names indelibly associated with one of the saddest, as  well as most humiliating, episodes of English modern military history,  in connection with the Transvaal War of 1881. I gazed mournfully on  Majuba Hill, that black spot of bitter memories to every Briton, and of  natural exultation and pride to the Boers; and on Colley's grave, the  unfortunate commander, whose unhappy and most unaccountable military  blunder led to the lamentable and fatal defeat, which cost him his life,  and resulted in the miserable fiasco--the retrocession of the Transvaal  to the Boers. It is impossible to estimate the damage done to British  influence, prestige, and power by the political consequences resulting  from that disastrous day.    [Illustration: CEMETERY, MAJUBA HILL.]    The south-eastern part of the Transvaal is as bare, and treeless, and  altogether as uninteresting and unattractive as the south western  region, between Bechuanaland and Klerksdorp, through which I had  travelled a few weeks previously. The instant, however, the border is  crossed, and Natal is entered, the scene is at once changed, and the  beauty of the surrounding country becomes apparent. Instead of the flat,  wearisome desert of the Transvaal, undulating hills, clothed with  verdure, and an extensive panorama of broad and fertile plains meets the  eye.    [Illustration: Decorative]    [Illustration: GOVERNMENT HOUSE, MARITZBURG.]          [Illustration: Decorative]    MARITZBURG.      After leaving Ladysmith, I proceeded to Maritzburg, the seat of  Government of Natal. This picturesque town is in a charming situation,  the surrounding scenery being extremely pretty. The town itself, is well  laid out, the streets being wide, and in most cases edged with trees.  Amongst its public buildings may be mentioned the new House of Assembly,  of which Sir John Akerman is Speaker. It is a handsome edifice, well  arranged, and economically constructed at a cost of L20,000. A life-size  statue of Her Majesty is to be erected in the front of the building,  the pedestal of which is already _in situ_.    While staying at Government House, and enjoying the kind hospitality of  Sir Charles and Lady Mitchell, my ear was often gladdened by the sound  of the cavalry bugle and the roll of the drum, those striking symbols of  British sway, as the troops passed my window in their early morning  rides. I am persuaded that these outward evidences of latent power,  impress not only the minds of Englishmen, but of natives also, in this  distant land. There cannot be a doubt of the influence exercised by the  British race over the aboriginal inhabitants of South Africa. That this  should be used, at all times, with justice, tact, and discretion, \"goes  without saying;\" but that it is a factor of great effect on their minds  is unquestionable.    [Illustration: A STREET IN MARITZBURG.]          [Illustration: Decorative]    DURBAN.      The railway journey from Maritzburg to Durban, a distance of fifty-seven  miles by road, is long and rather tedious travelling on account of the  slow pace. The line (a single one), which seems to have been very  skilfully engineered, is necessarily constructed with such steep  gradients that this seems inevitable. The long stoppages at stations  might be certainly improved. Durban is the prettiest as well as one of  the cleanest, and most well-ordered towns I have seen in South Africa. I  was at once struck with the Town Hall, a magnificent building, recently  erected, and generally stated to be, although not the largest, in some  respects the handsomest in South Africa. The total cost of construction  was about L50,000, and it is worthy of note that in their selection of  an architect, the Corporation of Durban did not have to go beyond their  own town, an efficient man being found in Mr. P.M. Dudgeon. The building  is of the Corinthian order of architecture, having a frontage of 206  feet, with a depth of 270 feet. It is prettily situated, and is a  striking proof of what colonists can do when an occasion demanding  skill, and perseverance, arises. There are several other fine buildings  in the town. A stranger coming from the Transvaal is immediately  impressed with the contrast between the careless indifference, which  marks the absence of proper municipal arrangements in the towns of the  South African Republic, and the proofs of their presence in an  energetic British community. The Natalians certainly deserve the  greatest credit for the way in which they carry on the business and  manage the public affairs of their prosperous, and thriving town, which  has a population of 17,000, of whom about 9,000 are Europeans. Recent  commercial returns show that the trade of Natal, of which Durban, as the  seaport town, is the centre, is rapidly increasing.    [Illustration: TOWN HALL, DURBAN.]    The imports during the first three-quarters of the year 1888 were about  two millions; and in 1889, during the same period, they had risen to  three millions. The exports during 1888 were one million; for the same  period in 1889 they were one million and a quarter. Imports have  advanced 50 per cent., exports by 25 per cent. Customs revenue has  advanced by 25 per cent., and if the receipts be maintained, which is  more than probable, the total income for the year from this source will  reach L350,000. It is anticipated that the combined trade of Natal for  the year 1889 will not be far short of six millions sterling. The  increase is a substantial one, and, what is more satisfactory, is that  there appears to be every reasonable prospect that the trade will go on  increasing by leaps and bounds. Affairs are in a generally prosperous  state, and a good sign is to be found in the fact that the emigration  returns are also rapidly rising.    [Illustration: HARBOUR WORKS, DURBAN.]    The gigantic Harbour Works, commenced and now nearly successfully  completed for the purpose of removing the bar, according to the plans  both of Sir John Coode, and subsequently of his pupil, their late  lamented engineer, Mr. Innes, and under the active personal  superintendence of their distinguished townsman the Chairman of the  Harbour Board, comprise an undertaking of which the citizens of Durban  may well be proud. Nor is less credit due to them, and to their spirited  leaders, for their enterprise in so rapidly pushing on their railway to  the Transvaal border, in the confident expectation that they will be the  first to bring the benefits of that most necessary modern mode of  conveyance, both for passengers and goods, into the heart of the  Transvaal Republic."]]]
