She then called on her son, Horus, to avenge his father, and  Horus engaged him in a long war, wherein he was at last victorious and  took Set prisoner. Isis now relented, and released Set, who be it  remembered, was her brother; which so enraged Horus that he tore off her  crown, or (according to some) struck off her head, which injury Thoth  repaired by giving her a cow's head in place of her own. Horus then  renewed the war with his uncle, and finally slew him with a long spear,  which he drove into his head.\" The gods and goddesses of the Osirid  legend, Seb, Nut or Netpe, Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Set, and Horus or  Harmachis, were those which most drew towards them the thoughts of the  Egyptians, the greater number being favourite objects of worship, while  Set was held in general detestation.    It was a peculiar feature of the Egyptian religion, that it contained  distinctively evil and malignant gods. Set was not, originally, such a  deity; but he became such in course of time, and was to the later  Egyptians the very principle of evil--Evil personified. Another evil  deity was Taour or Taourt, who is represented as a hippopotamus standing  on its hind-legs, with the skin and tail of a crocodile dependent down  its back, and a knife or a pair of shears in one hand. Bes seems also to  have been a divinity of the same class. He was represented as a hideous  dwarf, with large outstanding ears, bald, or with a plume of feathers on  his head, and with a lion-skin down his back, often carrying in his two  hands two knives. Even more terrible than Bes was Apep, the great  serpent, with its huge and many folds, who helped Set against Osiris,  and was the adversary and accuser of souls. Savak, a god with the head  of a crocodile, seems also to have belonged to the class of malignant  beings, though he was a favourite deity with some of the Ramesside  kings, and a special object of worship in the Fayoum.    [Illustrations: FIGURES OF TAOURT.]    The complex polytheism of the monuments and the literature was not,  however, the practical religion of many Egyptians. Local cults held  possession of most of the nomes, and the ordinary Egyptian, instead of  dissipating his religious affections by distributing them among the  thousand divinities of the Pantheon, concentrated them on those of his  nome. If he was a Memphite, he worshipped Phthah Sekhet, and Tum; if a  Theban, Ammon-Ra, Maut, Khons, and Neith; if a Heliopolite, Tum, Nebhebt  and Horus; if a Elephantinite, Kneph, Sati, Anuka, and Hak; and so on.  The Egyptian Pantheon was a gradual accretion, the result of  amalgamating the various local cults; but these continued predominant in  their several localities; and practically the only deities that obtained  anything like a general recognition were Osiris, Isis, Horus, and the  Nile-god, Hapi.    [Illustration: FIGURE OF BES.]    Besides the common popular religion, the belief of the masses, there was  another which prevailed among the priests and among the educated. The  primary doctrine of this esoteric religion was the real essential unity  of the Divine Nature. The sacred texts, known only to the priests and to  the initiated, taught that there was a single Being, \"the sole producer  of all things both in heaven and earth, himself not produced of any,\"  \"the only true living God, self-originated,\" \"who exists from the  beginning,\" \"who has made all things, but has not himself been made.\"  This Being seems never to have been represented by any material, even  symbolical, form. It is thought that he had no name, or, if he had, that  it must have been unlawful to pronounce or write it. He was a pure  spirit, perfect in every respect--all-wise, almighty, supremely good. It  is of him that the Egyptian poets use such expressions as the following:  \"He is not graven in marble; he is not beheld; his abode is not known;  no shrine is found with painted figures of him; there is no building  that can contain him;\" and, again: \"Unknown is his name in heaven; he  doth not manifest his forms; vain are all representations;\" and yet  again: \"His commencement is from the beginning; he is the God who has  existed from old time; there is no God without him; no mother bore him;  no father hath begotten him; he is a god-goddess, created from himself;  all gods came into existence when he began.\"    The other gods, the gods of the popular mythology were understood in  the esoteric religion to be either personified attributes of the Deity,  or parts of the nature which he had created, considered as informed and  inspired by him. Num or Kneph represented the creative mind, Phthah the  creative hand, or act of creating; Maut represented matter, Ra the sun,  Khons the moon, Seb the earth, Khem the generative power in nature, Nut  the upper hemisphere of the heavens, Athor the lower world or under  hemisphere; Thoth personified the Divine Wisdom, Ammon perhaps the  Divine mysteriousness or incomprehensibility, Osiris the Divine  Goodness. It is difficult in many cases to fix on the exact quality,  act, or part of nature intended; but the principle admits of no doubt.  No educated Egyptian conceived of the popular gods as really separate  and distinct beings. All knew that there was but One God, and understood  that, when worship was offered to Khem, or Kneph, or Maut, or Thoth, or  Ammon, the One God was worshipped under some one of his forms or in some  one of his aspects. He was every god, and thus all the gods' names were  interchangeable, and in one and the same hymn we may find a god, say  Ammon, addressed also as Ra and Khem and Turn and Horus and Khepra; or  Hapi, the Nile-god, invoked as Ammon and Phthah; or Osiris as Ra and  Thoth; or, in fact, any god invoked as almost any other. If there be a  limit, it is in respect of the evil deities, whose names are not given  to the good ones.    Common to all Egyptians seems to have been a belief, if not, strictly  speaking, in the immortality of the soul, yet, at any rate, in a life  after death, and a judgment of every man according to the deeds which  he had done in the body while upon earth. It was universally received,  that, immediately after death, the soul descended into the Lower World,  and was conducted to the \"Hall of Truth,\" where it was judged in the  presence of Osiris and of the forty-two assessors, the \"Lords of Truth\"  and judges of the dead. Anubis, \"the director of the weight,\" brought  forth a pair of scales, and, placing in one scale a figure or emblem of  Truth, set in the other a vase containing the good actions of the  deceased; Thoth standing by the while, with a tablet in his hand,  whereon to record the result. According to the side on which the balance  inclined, Osiris, the president, delivered sentence. If the good deeds  preponderated, the blessed soul was allowed to enter the \"boat of the  Sun,\" and was led by good spirits to Aahlu (Elysium), to the \"pools of  peace\" and the dwelling-place of Osiris. If, on the contrary, the good  deeds were insufficient, if the ordeal was not passed, then the unhappy  soul was sentenced, according to its deserts, to begin a round of  transmigrations into the bodies of more or less unclean animals, the  number, nature, and duration of the transmigrations depending on the  degree of the deceased's demerits, and the consequent length and  severity of the punishment which he deserved or the purification which  he needed. Ultimately, if after many trials purity was not attained,  then the wicked and incurable soul underwent a final sentence at the  hands of Osiris, Judge of the Dead, and being condemned to annihilation,  was destroyed upon the steps of heaven by Shu, the Lord of Light. The  good soul, having first been completely cleansed of its impurities by  passing through the basin of purgatorial fire guarded by the four  ape-faced genii, was made the companion of Osiris for a period of three  thousand years; after which it returned from Amenti, re-entered its  former body, and lived once more a human life upon the earth. The  process was repeated till a mystic number of years had gone by, when,  finally, the blessed attained the crowning joy of union with God, being  absorbed into the Divine Essence, from which they had emanated, and thus  attaining the true end and full perfection of their being.    Such a belief as this, if earnest and thorough, should be productive of  a high standard of moral action; and undoubtedly the Egyptians had a  code of morality that will compare favourably with that of most ancient  nations. It has been said to have contained \"three cardinal  requirements--love of God, love of virtue, and love of man.\" The hymns  sufficiently indicate the first; the second may be allowed, if by  \"virtue\" we understand justice and truth; the third is testified by the  constant claim of men, in their epitaphs, to have been benefactors of  their species. \"I was not an idler,\" says one; \"I was no listener to the  counsels of sloth; my name was not heard in the place of reproof ... all  men respected me; I gave water to the thirsty; I set the wanderer on his  path; I took away the oppressor, and put a stop to violence.\" \"I myself  was just and true,\" writes another: \"without malice, having put God in  my heart, and being quick to discern His will. I have done good upon  earth; I have harboured no prejudice; I have not been wicked; I have  not approved of any offence or iniquity; I have taken pleasure in  speaking the truth.... Pure is my soul; while living I bore no malice.  There are no errors attributable to me; no sins of mine are before the  judges.... The men of the future, while they live, will be charmed by my  remarkable merits.\" And another: \"I have not oppressed any widow; no  prisoner languished in my days; no one died of hunger. When there were  years of famine, I had my fields ploughed. I gave food to the  inhabitants, so that there was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15665"],[0,"New Latin Grammar (#8)"],[1,"e_; pollex, _thumb_; vertex, _summit_; calix, _cup_.    5.

The ending -es in the Nominative Plural; as, Phryges, _Phrygians_.    3. The ending -as in the Accusative Plural; as, Phrygas, _Phrygians_.    4. Proper names in -as (Genitive -antis) have -a in the Vocative Singular;  as, Atlas (Atlantis), Vocative Atla, _Atlas_.    5. Neuters in -ma (Genitive -matis) have -is instead of -ibus in the Dative  and Ablative Plural; as, poematis, _poems_.    6. Orpheus, and other proper names ending in -eus, form the Vocative  Singular in -eu (Orpheu, etc.). But in prose the other cases usually follow  the second declension; as, Orphei, Orpheo, etc.    7. Proper names in -es, like Pericles, form the Genitive Singular sometimes  in -is, sometimes in -i, as, Periclis or Pericli.    8. Feminine proper names in -o have -us in the Genitive, but -o in the  other oblique cases; as,--      _Nom._  Dido            _Acc._  Dido    _Gen._  Didus           _Voc._  Dido    _Dat._  Dido            _Abl._  Dido    9.

Nouns in -us, particularly in early Latin, often form the Genitive  Singular in -i, following the analogy of nouns in -us of the Second  Declension; as, senati, ornati. This is usually the case in Plautus and  Terence.    2. Nouns in -us sometimes have -u in the Dative Singular, instead of -ui;  as, fructu (for fructui).    3. The ending -ubus, instead of -ibus, occurs in the Dative and Ablative  Plural of artus (Plural), _limbs_; tribus, _tribe_; and in dis-syllables in  -cus; as, artubus, tribubus, arcubus, lacubus. But with the exception of  tribus, all these words admit the forms in -ibus as well as those in -ubus.    4. Domus, _house_, is declined according to the Fourth Declension, but has  also the following forms of the Second:--      domi (locative), _at home_;    domo, _from home_;    domum, _homewards_, _to one's home_;    domos, _homewards_, _to their_ (etc.) _homes_    5. The only Neuters of this declension in common use are: cornu, _horn_;  genu, _knee_; and veru, _spit_.    Exceptions to Gender in the Fourth Declension.    50. The following nouns in -us are Feminine: acus, _needle_; domus,  _house_; manus, _hand_; porticus, _colonnade_; tribus, _tribe_; Idus  (Plural), _Ides_; also names of trees (Sec. 15, 2).           *       *       *       *       *    FIFTH DECLENSION.    e-Stems.    51.

The ending of the Genitive and Dative Singular is -ei, instead of  -ei, when a consonant precedes; as, spei, rei, fidei.    2. A Genitive ending -i (for -ei) is found in plebi (from plebes = plebs)  in the expressions tribunus plebi, _tribune of the people_, and plebi  scitum, _decree of the people_; sometimes also in other words.    3. A Genitive and Dative form in -e sometimes occurs; as, acie.    4. With the exception of dies and res, most nouns of the Fifth Declension  are not declined in the Plural. But acies, series, species, spes, and a few  others are used in the Nominative and Accusative Plural.    Gender in the Fifth Declension.    53. Nouns of the Fifth Declension are regularly Feminine, except dies,  _day_, and meridies, _mid-day_. But dies is sometimes Feminine in the  Singular, particularly when it means an _appointed day_.           *       *       *       *       *    DEFECTIVE NOUNS.    54. Here belong--      1.

Many nouns, from the nature of their signification, are regularly used  in the Singular only. Thus:--    1. Proper names; as, Cicero, _Cicero_; Italia, _Italy_.    2. Nouns denoting material; as, aes, _copper_; lac, _milk_.    3. Abstract nouns; as, ignorantia, _ignorance_; bonitas, _goodness_.    4. But the above classes of words are sometimes used in the Plural. Thus:--      a) Proper names,--to denote different members of a family, or specimens    of a type; as, Cicerones, _the Ciceros_; Catones, _men like Cato_.      b) Names of materials,--to denote objects made of the material, or    different kinds of the substance; as, aera, _bronzes_ (i.e. bronze    figures); ligna, _woods_.      c) Abstract nouns,--to denote instances of the quality; as, ignorantiae,    _cases of ignorance_.    Nouns used in the Plural only.    56. Here belong--    1. Many geographical names; as, Thebae, _Thebes_; Leuctra, _Leuctra_;  Pompeji, _Pompeii_.    2.

Used in only One Case. Many nouns of the Fourth Declension are found  only in the Ablative Singular as, jussu, _by the order_; injussu, _without  the order_; natu, _by birth_.    2. Used in Two Cases.      a. Fors (_chance_), Nom. Sing.; forte, Abl. Sing.      b. Spontis (_free-will_), Gen. Sing.; sponte, Abl. Sing.    3. Used in Three Cases. Nemo, _no one_ (Nom.), has also the Dat. nemini and  the Acc. neminem. The Gen. and Abl. are supplied by the corresponding cases  of nullus; viz. nullius and nullo.    4. Impetus has the Nom., Acc., and Abl. Sing., and the Nom. and Acc. Plu.;  viz. impetus, impetum, impetu, impetus.      5. a. Preci, precem, prece, lacks the Nom. and Gen. Sing.      b. Vicis, vicem, vice, lacks the Nom. and Dat. Sing.    6. Opis, dapis, and frugis,--all lack the Nom. Sing.    7. Many monosyllables of the Third Declension lack the Gen. Plu.: as, cor,  lux, sol, aes, os (oris), rus, sal, tus.    Indeclinable Nouns.    58. Here belong--      fas, n., _right_.               nefas, n., _impiety_.    instar, n., _likeness_.         nihil, n., _nothing_.    mane, n., _morning_.            secus, n., _sex_.    1. With the exception of mane (which may serve also as Ablative, _in the  morning_), the nouns in this list are simply Neuters confined in use to the  Nominative and Accusative Singular.    Heteroclites.    59. These are nouns whose forms are partly of one declension, and partly of  another. Thus:--    1. Several nouns have the entire Singular of one declension, while the  Plural is of another; as,--      vas, vasis (_vessel_);     Plu., vasa, vasoroum, vasis, etc.    jugerum, jugeri (_acre_);  Plu., jugera, jugerum, jugeribus, etc.    2. Several nouns, while belonging in the main to one declension, have  certain special forms belonging to another. Thus:--      a) Many nouns of the First Declension ending in -ia take also a Nom. and    Acc. of the Fifth; as, materies, materiem, _material_, as well as    materia, materiam.      b) Fames, _hunger_, regularly of the Third Declension, has the Abl. fame    of the Fifth.      c) Requies, requietis, _rest_, regularly of the Third Declension, takes    an Acc. of the Fifth, requiem, in addition to requietem.      d) Besides plebs, plebis, _common people_, of the Third Declension, we    find plebes, plebei (also plebi, see Sec. 52, 2), of the Fifth.    Heterogeneous Nouns.    60. Heterogeneous nouns vary in Gender. Thus:--    1. Several nouns of the Second Declension have two forms,--one Masc. in  -us, and one Neuter in -um; as, clipeus, clipeum, _shield_; carrus, carrum,  _cart_.    2."]]]
