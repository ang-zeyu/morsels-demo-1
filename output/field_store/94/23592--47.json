One of John Cotton's most famous sermons  dealt with the question as to whether women had a right to sing in  church, and after lengthy disquisition the preacher finally decided that  the Lord had no special objection to women's singing the Psalms, but  this conclusion was reached only after an unsparing battle of doubts and  logic. \"Some,\" he declares, \"that were altogether against singing of  Psalms at all with a lively voice, yet being convinced that it is a  moral worship of God warranted in Scripture, then if there must be a  Singing one alone must sing, not all (or if all) the Men only and not  the Women.... Some object, 'Because it is not permitted to speak in the  Church in two cases: 1. By way of teaching.... For this the Apostle  accounteth an act of authority which is unlawful for a woman to usurp  over the man, II, Tim. 2, 13. And besides the woman is more subject to  error than a man, ver. 14, and therefore might soon prove a seducer if  she became a teacher.... It is not permitted to a woman to speak in the  Church by way of propounding questions though under pretence of desire  to learn for her own satisfaction; but rather it is required she should  ask her husband at home.\"    Thus we might follow Cotton through many a page and hear his ingenious  application of Biblical verses, his carefully balanced arguments, his  earnest consideration of what seems to the modern reader a most trivial  question. To him, however, and probably to the women also it was a  weighty subject, more important by far than the cause of the high  mortality among both mothers and children of the day--a mortality  appallingly high. It would seem that the fevers, sore throats,  consumption, and small pox that destroyed women and babes in vast  numbers might have claimed some attention from the hair-splitting  clergyman and his congregation. We must not, however, judge the age too  harshly. It is utterly impossible for us of the twentieth century to  understand entirely the view point of the Puritans; for the remarkable  era of the nineteenth century intervenes, and freedom from superstition  and blind faith is a gift which came after that era and not before.    From time to time the colonists to the south may have sneered at or even  condemned the severity of New England life, but in the main the  merchants of New York and the planters of Virginia and Maryland realized  and respected the moral worth and earnest nature of the Massachusetts  settlers. For example, the versatile Virginia leader, William Byrd,  remarks sarcastically in his _History of the Dividing Line Run in the  Year 1728_: \"Nor would I care, like a certain New England Magistrate to  order a Man to the Whipping Post for daring to ride for a midwife on the  Lord's Day\"; but in the same manuscript he pays these people of rigid  rules the following tribute: \"Tho' these People may be ridiculed for  some Pharisaical Particularitys in their Worship and Behaviour, yet they  were very useful Subjects, as being Frugal and Industrious, giving no  Scandal or Bad Example, at least by any Open and Public Vices. By which  excellent Qualities they had much the Advantage of the Southern Colony,  who thought their being Members of the Establish't Church sufficient to  Sanctifie very loose and Profligate Morals. For this reason New England  improved much faster than Virginia, and in Seven or Eight Years New  Plymouth, like Switzerland, seemd too narrow a Territory for its  Inhabitants.\"[14]    Those early New Englanders may have been frugal and industrious, giving  no scandal nor bad example; but the constant repression, the monotony,  the dreariness of the religion often wrought havoc with the sensitive  nerves of the women, and many of them needed, far more than prayers,  godly counsel and church trials, the skilled services of a physician.  Two incidents related by Winthrop should be sufficient to impress the  pathos or the down-right tragedy of the situation:    \"A cooper's wife of Hingham, having been long in a sad melancholic  distemper near to phrensy, and having formerly attempted to drown her  child, but prevented by God's gracious providence, did now again take an  opportunity.... And threw it into the water and mud ... She carried the  child again, and threw it in so far as it could not get out; but then it  pleased God, that a young man, coming that way, saved it. She would give  no other reason for it, but that she did it to save it from misery, and  with that she was assured, she had sinned against the Holy Ghost, and  that she could not repent of any sin. Thus doth Satan work by the  advantage of our infirmities, which would stir us up to cleave the more  fast to Christ Jesus, and to walk the more humbly and watchfully in all  our conversation.\"    \"Dorothy Talby was hanged at Boston for murdering her own daughter a  child of three years old. She had been a member of the church of Salem,  and of good esteem for goodliness, but, falling at difference with her  husband, through melancholy or spiritual delusions, she sometime  attempted to kill him, and her children, and herself, by refusing  meat.... After much patience, and divers admonitions not prevailing, the  church cast her out. Whereupon she grew worse; so as the magistrate  caused her to be whipped. Whereupon she was reformed for a time, and  carried herself more dutifully to her husband, but soon after she was so  possessed with Satan, that he persuaded her (by his delusions, which she  listened to as revelations from God) to break the neck of her own  child, that she might free it from future misery. This she confessed  upon her apprehension; yet, at her arraignment, she stood mute a good  space, till the governour told her she should be pressed to death, and  then she confessed the indictment. When she was to receive judgment, she  would not uncover her face, nor stand up, but as she was forced, nor  give any testimony of her repentance, either then or at her execution.  The cloth which should have covered her face, she plucked off, and put  between the rope and her neck. She desired to have been beheaded, giving  this reason, that it was less painful and less shameful. Mr. Peter, her  late pastor, and Mr. Wilson, went with her to the place of execution,  but could do no good with her.\"[15]      _VI. Woman's Comfort in Religion_    Little gentleness and surely little of the overwhelming love that was  Christ's are apparent in a creed so stern and uncompromising. But the  age in which it flourished was not in itself a gentle and tolerant era.  It had not been so many years since men and women had been tortured and  executed for their faith. The Spanish Inquisition had scarcely ceased  its labor of barbarism; and days were to follow both in England and on  the continent when acts almost as savage would be allowed for the sake  of religion. In spite, moreover, of all that has been said above, in  spite of the literalness, the belief in a personal devil, the fear of an  arbitrary God, the religion of Puritanism was not without comfort to the  New England woman. Many are the references to the Creator's comforting  presence and help. Note these lines from a letter written by Margaret  Winthrop to her husband in 1637: \"Sure I am, that all shall work to the  best to them that love God, or rather are loved of him. I know he will  bring light out of obscurity, and make his righteousness shine forth as  clear as noonday. Yet I find in myself an adverse spirit, and a  trembling heart, not so willing to submit to the will of God as I  desire. There is a time to plant, and a time to pull up that which is  planted, which I could desire might not be yet. But the Lord knoweth  what is best, and his will be done...\"    Though woman might not speak or hold office in the Church, yet she was  not by any means denied the ordinary privileges and comforts of  religious worship, but rather was encouraged to gather with her sisters  in informal seasons of prayer and meditation. The good wives are  commended in many of the writings of the day for general charity work  connected with the church, and are mentioned frequently as being present  at the evening assemblies similar to our modern prayer meetings. Cotton  Mather makes this notation in his _Essays to do Good_, published in  1710: \"It is proposed, That about twelve families agree to meet (the men  and their wives) at each other's houses, in rotation, once in a  fortnight or a month, as shall be thought most proper, and spend a  suitable time together in religious exercises.\" Even when women ventured  to hold formal religious meetings there was at first little or no  protest. According to Hutchinson's _History of Massachusetts Bay_, when  Anne Hutchinson, that creator of religious strife and thorn in the side  of the Elders, conducted assemblies for women only, there was even  praise for the innovation. It was only when this leader criticised the  clergy that silence was demanded. \"Mrs. Hutchinson thought fit to set up  a meeting for the sisters, also, where she repeated the sermons preached  the Lord's day before, adding her remarks and expositions. Her lectures  made much noise, and fifty or eighty principal women attended them. At  first they were generally approved of.\"    Only when the decency and the decorum of the colony was threatened did  the stern laws of the church descend upon Mistress Hutchinson and her  followers. It was doubtless the riotous conduct of these radicals that  caused the resolution to be passed by the assembly in 1637, which  stated, according to Winthrop: \"That though women might meet (some few  together) to pray and edify one another; yet such a set assembly, (as  was then in practice at Boston), where sixty or more did meet every  week, and one woman (in a prophetical way, by resolving questions of  doctrine, and expounding scripture) took upon her the whole exercise,  was agreed to be disorderly, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15489"],[0,"Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners (#8)"],[1,"later, commences to find favor among the  professors.    3. A little while before, a patient gave me the medical history of her  brother, who, exclaiming \"_Nature, Nature!_\" had gone out of his mind.  The doctors considered that the exclamation arose from a study of  _Goethe's_ beautiful essay, and indicated that the patient had been  overworking. I expressed the opinion that it seemed more _plausible_ to  me that the exclamation \"Nature!\" was to be taken in that sexual meaning  known also to the less educated in our country. It seemed to me that  this view had something in it, because the unfortunate youth afterwards  mutilated his genital organs. The patient was eighteen years old when  the attack occurred.    The first person in the dream-thoughts behind the ego was my friend who  had been so scandalously treated. _\"I now attempted to clear up the  chronological relation.\"_ My friend's book deals with the chronological  relations of life, and, amongst other things, correlates _Goethe's_  duration of life with a number of days in many ways important to  biology. The ego is, however, represented as a general paralytic (_\"I  am not certain what year we are actually in\"_). The dream exhibits my  friend as behaving like a general paralytic, and thus riots in  absurdity. But the dream thoughts run ironically. \"Of course he is a  madman, a fool, and you are the genius who understands all about it. But  shouldn't it be the _other way round_?\" This inversion obviously took  place in the dream when Goethe attacked the young man, which is absurd,  whilst any one, however young, can to-day easily attack the great  Goethe.    I am prepared to maintain that no dream is inspired by other than  egoistic emotions. The ego in the dream does not, indeed, represent only  my friend, but stands for myself also. I identify myself with him  because the fate of his discovery appears to me typical of the  acceptance of _my own_. If I were to publish my own theory, which gives  sexuality predominance in the aetiology of psychoneurotic disorders (see  the allusion to the eighteen-year-old patient--_\"Nature, Nature!\"_), the  same criticism would be leveled at me, and it would even now meet with  the same contempt.    When I follow out the dream thoughts closely, I ever find only _scorn_  and _contempt_ as _correlated with the dream's absurdity_. It is well  known that the discovery of a cracked sheep's skull on the Lido in  Venice gave Goethe the hint for the so-called vertebral theory of the  skull. My friend plumes himself on having as a student raised a hubbub  for the resignation of an aged professor who had done good work  (including some in this very subject of comparative anatomy), but who,  on account of _decrepitude_, had become quite incapable of teaching. The  agitation my friend inspired was so successful because in the German  Universities an _age limit_ is not demanded for academic work. _Age is  no protection against folly._ In the hospital here I had for years the  honor to serve under a chief who, long fossilized, was for decades  notoriously _feebleminded_, and was yet permitted to continue in his  responsible office. A trait, after the manner of the find in the Lido,  forces itself upon me here. It was to this man that some youthful  colleagues in the hospital adapted the then popular slang of that day:  \"No Goethe has written that,\" \"No Schiller composed that,\" etc.    We have not exhausted our valuation of the dream work. In addition to  condensation, displacement, and definite arrangement of the psychical  matter, we must ascribe to it yet another activity--one which is,  indeed, not shared by every dream. I shall not treat this position of  the dream work exhaustively; I will only point out that the readiest  way to arrive at a conception of it is to take for granted, probably  unfairly, that it _only subsequently influences the dream content which  has already been built up_. Its mode of action thus consists in so  cooerdinating the parts of the dream that these coalesce to a coherent  whole, to a dream composition. The dream gets a kind of facade which, it  is true, does not conceal the whole of its content. There is a sort of  preliminary explanation to be strengthened by interpolations and slight  alterations. Such elaboration of the dream content must not be too  pronounced; the misconception of the dream thoughts to which it gives  rise is merely superficial, and our first piece of work in analyzing a  dream is to get rid of these early attempts at interpretation.    The motives for this part of the dream work are easily gauged. This  final elaboration of the dream is due to a _regard for  intelligibility_--a fact at once betraying the origin of an action which  behaves towards the actual dream content just as our normal psychical  action behaves towards some proffered perception that is to our liking.  The dream content is thus secured under the pretense of certain  expectations, is perceptually classified by the supposition of its  intelligibility, thereby risking its falsification, whilst, in fact, the  most extraordinary misconceptions arise if the dream can be correlated  with nothing familiar. Every one is aware that we are unable to look at  any series of unfamiliar signs, or to listen to a discussion of unknown  words, without at once making perpetual changes through _our regard for  intelligibility_, through our falling back upon what is familiar.    We can call those dreams _properly made up_ which are the result of an  elaboration in every way analogous to the psychical action of our waking  life. In other dreams there is no such action; not even an attempt is  made to bring about order and meaning. We regard the dream as \"quite  mad,\" because on awaking it is with this last-named part of the dream  work, the dream elaboration, that we identify ourselves. So far,  however, as our analysis is concerned, the dream, which resembles a  medley of disconnected fragments, is of as much value as the one with a  smooth and beautifully polished surface. In the former case we are  spared, to some extent, the trouble of breaking down the  super-elaboration of the dream content.    All the same, it would be an error to see in the dream facade nothing  but the misunderstood and somewhat arbitrary elaboration of the dream  carried out at the instance of our psychical life. Wishes and phantasies  are not infrequently employed in the erection of this facade, which  were already fashioned in the dream thoughts; they are akin to those of  our waking life--\"day-dreams,\" as they are very properly called. These  wishes and phantasies, which analysis discloses in our dreams at night,  often present themselves as repetitions and refashionings of the scenes  of infancy. Thus the dream facade may show us directly the true core of  the dream, distorted through admixture with other matter.    Beyond these four activities there is nothing else to be discovered in  the dream work. If we keep closely to the definition that dream work  denotes the transference of dream thoughts to dream content, we are  compelled to say that the dream work is not creative; it develops no  fancies of its own, it judges nothing, decides nothing. It does nothing  but prepare the matter for condensation and displacement, and refashions  it for dramatization, to which must be added the inconstant last-named  mechanism--that of explanatory elaboration. It is true that a good deal  is found in the dream content which might be understood as the result of  another and more intellectual performance; but analysis shows  conclusively every time that these _intellectual operations were already  present in the dream thoughts, and have only been taken over by the  dream content_. A syllogism in the dream is nothing other than the  repetition of a syllogism in the dream thoughts; it seems inoffensive if  it has been transferred to the dream without alteration; it becomes  absurd if in the dream work it has been transferred to other matter. A  calculation in the dream content simply means that there was a  calculation in the dream thoughts; whilst this is always correct, the  calculation in the dream can furnish the silliest results by the  condensation of its factors and the displacement of the same operations  to other things. Even speeches which are found in the dream content are  not new compositions; they prove to be pieced together out of speeches  which have been made or heard or read; the words are faithfully copied,  but the occasion of their utterance is quite overlooked, and their  meaning is most violently changed.    It is, perhaps, not superfluous to support these assertions by examples:    1. _A seemingly inoffensive, well-made dream of a patient. She was going  to market with her cook, who carried the basket. The butcher said to her  when she asked him for something: \"That is all gone,\" and wished to give  her something else, remarking; \"That's very good.\" She declines, and  goes to the greengrocer, who wants to sell her a peculiar vegetable  which is bound up in bundles and of a black color. She says: \"I don't  know that; I won't take it.\"_    The remark \"That is all gone\" arose from the treatment. A few days  before I said myself to the patient that the earliest reminiscences of  childhood _are all gone_ as such, but are replaced by transferences and  dreams. Thus I am the butcher.    The second remark, _\"I don't know that\"_ arose in a very different  connection. The day before she had herself called out in rebuke to the  cook (who, moreover, also appears in the dream): \"_Behave yourself  properly_; I don't know _that_\"--that is, \"I don't know this kind of  behavior; I won't have it.\" The more harmless portion of this speech was  arrived at by a displacement of the dream content; in the dream thoughts  only the other portion of the speech played a part, because the dream  work changed an imaginary situation into utter irrecognizability and"]]]
