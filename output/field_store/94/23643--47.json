[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1658"],[0,"Phaedo (#8)"],[1,"about his theory of knowledge.  And while we may fairly translate the dialectical into the language of  Hegel, and the religious and mythological into the language of Dante or  Bunyan, the ethical speaks to us still in the same voice, and appeals to  a common feeling.    20. Two arguments of this ethical character occur in the Phaedo. The  first may be described as the aspiration of the soul after another state  of being. Like the Oriental or Christian mystic, the philosopher is  seeking to withdraw from impurities of sense, to leave the world and the  things of the world, and to find his higher self. Plato recognizes in  these aspirations the foretaste of immortality; as Butler and Addison in  modern times have argued, the one from the moral tendencies of mankind,  the other from the progress of the soul towards perfection. In using  this argument Plato has certainly confused the soul which has left the  body, with the soul of the good and wise. (Compare Republic.) Such a  confusion was natural, and arose partly out of the antithesis of soul  and body. The soul in her own essence, and the soul 'clothed upon' with  virtues and graces, were easily interchanged with one another, because  on a subject which passes expression the distinctions of language can  hardly be maintained.    21. The ethical proof of the immortality of the soul is derived from the  necessity of retribution. The wicked would be too well off if their  evil deeds came to an end. It is not to be supposed that an Ardiaeus,  an Archelaus, an Ismenias could ever have suffered the penalty of  their crimes in this world. The manner in which this retribution is  accomplished Plato represents under the figures of mythology. Doubtless  he felt that it was easier to improve than to invent, and that in  religion especially the traditional form was required in order to give  verisimilitude to the myth. The myth too is far more probable to that  age than to ours, and may fairly be regarded as 'one guess among  many' about the nature of the earth, which he cleverly supports by the  indications of geology. Not that he insists on the absolute truth of  his own particular notions: 'no man of sense will be confident in such  matters; but he will be confident that something of the kind is true.'  As in other passages (Gorg., Tim., compare Crito), he wins belief for  his fictions by the moderation of his statements; he does not, like  Dante or Swedenborg, allow himself to be deceived by his own creations.    The Dialogue must be read in the light of the situation. And first of  all we are struck by the calmness of the scene. Like the spectators  at the time, we cannot pity Socrates; his mien and his language are  so noble and fearless. He is the same that he ever was, but milder and  gentler, and he has in no degree lost his interest in dialectics;  he will not forego the delight of an argument in compliance with the  jailer's intimation that he should not heat himself with talking. At  such a time he naturally expresses the hope of his life, that he has  been a true mystic and not a mere retainer or wand-bearer: and he refers  to passages of his personal history. To his old enemies the Comic  poets, and to the proceedings on the trial, he alludes playfully; but he  vividly remembers the disappointment which he felt in reading the books  of Anaxagoras. The return of Xanthippe and his children indicates that  the philosopher is not 'made of oak or rock.' Some other traits of his  character may be noted; for example, the courteous manner in which  he inclines his head to the last objector, or the ironical touch, 'Me  already, as the tragic poet would say, the voice of fate calls;' or  the depreciation of the arguments with which 'he comforted himself and  them;' or his fear of 'misology;' or his references to Homer; or the  playful smile with which he 'talks like a book' about greater and less;  or the allusion to the possibility of finding another teacher among  barbarous races (compare Polit.); or the mysterious reference to another  science (mathematics?) of generation and destruction for which he is  vainly feeling. There is no change in him; only now he is invested with  a sort of sacred character, as the prophet or priest of Apollo the God  of the festival, in whose honour he first of all composes a hymn,  and then like the swan pours forth his dying lay. Perhaps the extreme  elevation of Socrates above his own situation, and the ordinary  interests of life (compare his jeu d'esprit about his burial, in which  for a moment he puts on the 'Silenus mask'), create in the mind of the  reader an impression stronger than could be derived from arguments that  such a one has in him 'a principle which does not admit of death.'    The other persons of the Dialogue may be considered under two heads: (1)  private friends; (2) the respondents in the argument.    First there is Crito, who has been already introduced to us in the  Euthydemus and the Crito; he is the equal in years of Socrates, and  stands in quite a different relation to him from his younger disciples.  He is a man of the world who is rich and prosperous (compare the jest  in the Euthydemus), the best friend of Socrates, who wants to know his  commands, in whose presence he talks to his family, and who performs  the last duty of closing his eyes. It is observable too that, as in the  Euthydemus, Crito shows no aptitude for philosophical discussions. Nor  among the friends of Socrates must the jailer be forgotten, who seems  to have been introduced by Plato in order to show the impression made  by the extraordinary man on the common. The gentle nature of the man  is indicated by his weeping at the announcement of his errand and then  turning away, and also by the words of Socrates to his disciples: 'How  charming the man is! since I have been in prison he has been always  coming to me, and is as good as could be to me.' We are reminded  too that he has retained this gentle nature amid scenes of death and  violence by the contrasts which he draws between the behaviour of  Socrates and of others when about to die.    Another person who takes no part in the philosophical discussion is the  excitable Apollodorus, the same who, in the Symposium, of which he is  the narrator, is called 'the madman,' and who testifies his grief by the  most violent emotions. Phaedo is also present, the 'beloved disciple'  as he may be termed, who is described, if not 'leaning on his bosom,'  as seated next to Socrates, who is playing with his hair. He too, like  Apollodorus, takes no part in the discussion, but he loves above all  things to hear and speak of Socrates after his death. The calmness  of his behaviour, veiling his face when he can no longer restrain  his tears, contrasts with the passionate outcries of the other. At a  particular point the argument is described as falling before the attack  of Simmias. A sort of despair is introduced in the minds of the company.  The effect of this is heightened by the description of Phaedo, who has  been the eye-witness of the scene, and by the sympathy of his Phliasian  auditors who are beginning to think 'that they too can never trust an  argument again.' And the intense interest of the company is communicated  not only to the first auditors, but to us who in a distant country read  the narrative of their emotions after more than two thousand years have  passed away.    The two principal interlocutors are Simmias and Cebes, the disciples of  Philolaus the Pythagorean philosopher of Thebes. Simmias is described  in the Phaedrus as fonder of an argument than any man living; and  Cebes, although finally persuaded by Socrates, is said to be the most  incredulous of human beings. It is Cebes who at the commencement of  the Dialogue asks why 'suicide is held to be unlawful,' and who  first supplies the doctrine of recollection in confirmation of the  pre-existence of the soul. It is Cebes who urges that the pre-existence  does not necessarily involve the future existence of the soul, as is  shown by the illustration of the weaver and his coat. Simmias, on the  other hand, raises the question about harmony and the lyre, which is  naturally put into the mouth of a Pythagorean disciple. It is Simmias,  too, who first remarks on the uncertainty of human knowledge, and  only at last concedes to the argument such a qualified approval as is  consistent with the feebleness of the human faculties. Cebes is the  deeper and more consecutive thinker, Simmias more superficial and  rhetorical; they are distinguished in much the same manner as Adeimantus  and Glaucon in the Republic.    Other persons, Menexenus, Ctesippus, Lysis, are old friends; Evenus  has been already satirized in the Apology; Aeschines and Epigenes  were present at the trial; Euclid and Terpsion will reappear in the  Introduction to the Theaetetus, Hermogenes has already appeared in  the Cratylus. No inference can fairly be drawn from the absence of  Aristippus, nor from the omission of Xenophon, who at the time of  Socrates' death was in Asia. The mention of Plato's own absence seems  like an expression of sorrow, and may, perhaps, be an indication that  the report of the conversation is not to be taken literally.    The place of the Dialogue in the series is doubtful. The doctrine of  ideas is certainly carried beyond the Socratic point of view; in no  other of the writings of Plato is the theory of them so completely  developed. Whether the belief in immortality can be attributed to  Socrates or not is uncertain; the silence of the Memorabilia, and of the  earlier Dialogues of Plato, is an argument to the contrary. Yet in the  Cyropaedia Xenophon has put language into the mouth of the dying Cyrus  which recalls the Phaedo, and may have been derived from the teaching of  Socrates. It may be fairly urged that the greatest religious interest of  mankind could not have been wholly ignored by one who passed his life in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16598"],[0,"History of the American Negro in the Great World War (#8)"],[1,"thinking. There was not much of melody in it; little of the dance  movement and very little of the lighter and gayer manifestations of  life. It has been described as a sort of harmonious discord, typifying  mysterious, tragic and awe-inspiring things. The people sat and ate  their heavy food and drank their beer, their ears engaged with the  strains of the orchestra, their eyes by the movements of the conductor,  while their tired brains rested and digestion proceeded.    To the average German family a picnic or a day's outing was a serious  affair. The labor of preparation was considerable and then they covered  as much of the distance as possible by walking in order to save carfare.  In the parade was the tired, careworn wife usually carrying one,  sometimes two infants in her arms. The other children lugged the lunch  baskets, hammocks, umbrellas and other paraphernalia. At the head of the  procession majestically marched the lord of the outfit, smoking his  cigar or pipe; a suggestion of the goose-step in his stride, carrying  nothing, except his dignity and military deportment. With this kind of  start the reader can imagine the good time they all had.    MILITARISM AND AUTOCRACY DOOMED Joy to the German mind in mass was an  unknown quantity. The literature on which they fed was heavier and more  somber than their music. When the average German tried to be gay and  playful he reminded one of an elephant trying to caper. Their humor in  the main, manifested itself in coarse and vulgar jests.    For athletics they had their turn vereins in which men went through  hard, laborious exercises which made them muscle-bound. Their favorite  sports were hunting and fencing--the desire to kill or wound. They rowed  some but they knew nothing of baseball, boxing, tennis, golf or the  usual sports so popular with young men in England, France and America.  Aside from fencing, they had not a sport calculated to produce agility  or nimbleness of foot and brain.    Their emotions expanded and their sentiments thrilled at the spectacle  of war. Uniforms, helmets and gold lace delighted their eyes. The  parade, the guard mount, the review were the finest things they knew. To  a people trained in such a school and purposely given great burdens that  they might attain fortitude, war was second nature. They welcomed it as  a sort of pastime.    In the system on which Kultur was based, it was necessary to strike  deeply the religious note; no difference if it was a false note. The  German ear was so accustomed to discord it could not recognize the true  from the false. The Kaiser was heralded to his people as a deeply  religious man. In his public utterances he never failed to call upon God  to grant him aid and bless his works.    One of the old traditions of the Fatherland was that the king, being  specially appointed by God, could do no wrong. To the thinking portion  of the nation this could have been nothing less than absurd fallacy, but  where the majority do not think; if a thing is asserted strongly and  often enough, they come to accept it. It becomes a belief. The people  had become so impressed with the devoutness of the Kaiser and his  assumption of Divine guidance, that the great majority of them believed  the kaiser was always right; that he could do no wrong. When the great  blow of war finally was struck the Kaiser asked his God to look down and  bless the sword that he had drawn; a prayer altogether consistent coming  from his lips, for the god he worshipped loved war, was a god of famine,  rapine and blood. From the moment of that appeal, military autocracy and  absolute monarchy were doomed. It took time, it took lives, it took more  treasure than a thousand men could count in a lifetime. But the assault  had been against civilization, on the very foundation of all that  humanity had gained through countless centuries. The forces of light  were too strong for it; would not permit it to triumph.    The President of the United States, from the bedside of his dying wife,  appealed to the nations for some means of reaching peace for Europe. The  last thoughts of his dying helpmate, were of the great responsibility  resting upon her husband incident to the awful crisis in the lives of  the nations of earth, that was becoming more pronounced with each second  of time.    The Pope was stricken to death by the great calamity to civilization. A  few minutes before the end came he said that the Almighty in His  infinite mercy was removing him from the world to spare him the anguish  of the awful war.    The first inclination of America was to be neutral. She was far removed  from the scenes of strife and knew little of the hidden springs and  causes of the war. Excepting in the case of a few of her public men; her  editors, professors and scholars, European politics were as a sealed  book. The president of the United States declared for neutrality; that  individual and nation should avoid the inflaming touch of the war  passion. We kept that attitude as long as was consistent with national  patience and the larger claims of HUMANITY and universal JUSTICE.    As an evidence of our lack of knowledge of the impending conflict, a  party of Christian men were on the sea with the humanitarian object in  view of attending a world's peace conference in Constance,  Germany--Germany of all places, then engaged in trying to burn up the  world. Arriving in Paris, the party received its first news that a great  European war was about to begin. Steamship offices were being stormed by  crowds of frantic American tourists. Martial law was declared. The  streets were alive with soldiers and weeping women. Shops were closed,  the clerks having been drafted into the army. The city hummed with  militarism.    Underneath the excitement was the stern, stoic attitude of the French in  preparing to meet their old enemy, combined with their calmness in  refraining from outbreaks against German residents of Paris. One of the  party alluding to the incongruous position in which the peace delegates  found themselves, said:         \"It might be interesting to observe the unique and almost humorous       situation into which these peace delegates were thrown. Starting       out a week before with the largest hope and most enthusiastic       anticipation of effecting a closer tie between nations, and       swinging the churches of Christendom into a clearer alignment       against international martial attitudes, we were instantly       'disarmed,' bound, and cast into chains of utter helplessness, not       even feeling free to express the feeblest sentiment against the       high rising tide of military activity. We were lost on a       tempestuous sea; the dove of peace had been beaten, broken winged       to shore, and the olive branch lost in its general fury.\"    Describing conditions in Paris on August 12, he says:         \"We are in a state of tense expectation, so acute that it dulls the       senses; Paris is relapsing into the condition of an audience       assisting at a thrilling drama with intolerably long entr'acts,       during which it tries to think of its own personal affairs.         \"We know that pages of history are being rapidly engraved in steel,       written in blood, illuminated in the margin with glory on a       background of heroism and suffering, not more than a few score       miles away.         \"The shrieking camelots (peddlers) gallop through the streets       waving their news sheets, but it is almost always news of       twenty-four hours ago. The iron hand of the censor reduces the       press to a monotonous repetition of the same formula. Only       headlines give scope for originality. Of local news there is none.       There is nothing doing in Paris but steady preparation for meeting       contingencies by organizing ambulances and relief for the poor.\"    From the thousands of tales brought back by American tourists caught in  Germany at the outbreak of the war, there is more than enough evidence  that they were not treated with that courtesy manifested towards them by  the French. They were arrested as spies, subjected to all sorts of  embarrassments and indignities; their persons searched, their baggage  and letters examined, and frequently were detained for long periods  without any explanation being offered. When finally taken to the  frontier, they were not merely put across--frequently they were in a  sense thrown across.    Nor were the subjects of other nations, particularly those with which  Germany was at war, treated with that fine restraint which characterized  the French. Here is an account by a traveller of the treatment of  Russian subjects:         \"We left Berlin on the day Germany declared war against Russia. Within       seventy-five miles of the frontier, 1,000 Russians in the train by       which they were travelling were turned out of the carriage and       compelled to spend eighteen hours without food in an open field       surrounded by soldiers with fixed bayonets.         \"Then they were placed in dirty cattle wagons, about sixty men, women       and children to a wagon, and for twenty-eight hours were carried about       Prussia without food, drink or privacy. In Stettin they were lodged in       pig pens, and next morning were sent off by steamer to Rugen, whence       they made their way to Denmark and Sweden without money or luggage.       Sweden provided them with food and free passage to the Russian       frontier. Five of our fellow-passengers went mad.\"    The steamship Philadelphia--note the name, signifying brotherly love, so  completely lost sight of in the conflict--was the first passenger liner  to reach America after the beginning of the European war. A more  remarkable crowd never arrived in New York City by steamship or train.  There were men of millions and persons of modest means who had slept  side by side on the journey over; voyagers with balances of"]]]
