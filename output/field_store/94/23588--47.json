My brain is a soft gray-and-white mass resembling marrow.    2. It is placed in a bony box called the skull; it is covered and held  together by three coats or membranes.    3. The outer membrane is thick and firm; it strengthens and supports the  brain.    4. The middle membrane is thick, and somewhat like a spider's web in  appearance.    5. The inner membrane is a network of blood-vessels.    6. From the brain, white or reddish gray pulpy cords, called nerves, pass  to all parts of the body. These nerves are of two kinds: nerves of feeling,  and nerves of motion.    7. If I prick my finger, a nerve of feeling carries the message to my  brain; if I wish to move my finger, a nerve of motion causes my finger to  obey my will.    8. Twelve pairs of nerves pass from the base of the brain: the first pair,  called the nerves of smell, to my nose; the fourth pair, called the nerves  of sight, to my eyes; the fifth pair, called the nerves of taste, to my  mouth, tongue, and teeth. One pair pass to my face; another to my ears. The  ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth pairs to my tongue and parts of my  throat and neck.[3]    9. The spinal cord is a bundle of nerves extending from the base of my  brain, down through the whole length of my spine, or backbone. It is the  largest nerve in my body.    10. From the spine, thirty-one pairs of nerves, called _spinal nerves_,  pass to different parts of my body; some to the lungs, some to the heart,  some to the stomach, some to the bones, and some to the muscles and skin.    11. If a nerve be destroyed it cannot carry messages to and from the brain.  Before filling a tooth, the dentist sometimes destroys its nerve.    12. If a nerve be pressed upon too long it cannot perform its duty. If I  press upon the nerve passing to my foot, I stop it from communicating with  the brain; the foot loses its feeling, or, as I say, \"is asleep.\"    13. If I drink alcoholic liquors, or snuff, smoke, or chew tobacco, my  brain and nerves cannot do their work well; because alcohol and nicotine  are very poisonous to the brain and nerves.    14. The brain must be supplied with good blood;    The brain must be used;    The brain must be rested;    I must drink wholesome drink, eat wholesome food, take enough exercise, and  breathe pure air, that my brain may be supplied with pure blood;    I must study and think, that my brain may grow and be strong for work;    I must rest my brain when it is tired, either by changing my employment, or  by going to sleep;    I must not poison my brain with alcohol or tobacco.    [3] NOTE.--_A fuller description of the Nerves of the Brain_: Twelve pairs  of nerves pass from the base of the brain; the first pair, called the  nerves of smell, to my nose; the second pair, called the nerves of sight,  to my eyes; the third, fourth, and sixth pairs to the muscles of my eyes;  the fifth pair to my forehead, eyes, nose, ears, tongue, teeth, and  different parts of my face; the seventh pair to different parts of my face;  the eighth pair, called the nerves of hearing, to the inner part of my ear;  the ninth pair to my mouth, tongue, and throat; the twelfth pair to my  tongue; the eleventh pair to my neck; the tenth pair to my neck, throat,  lungs, stomach, and different parts of my body.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS ON THE FORMULA.    1.

The brain is egg-shaped, and of two parts, the large brain (_cerebrum_),  and the little brain (_cerebellum_). These are composed of a white and gray  substance, which in the large brain is so folded and wrinkled that it looks  like the meat of an English walnut; in the little brain it is so arranged  that it resembles a tree, and is called _arbor vitae_, tree of life. The  mind does its thinking through the large brain, and controls its muscles  through the little brain.    A drunken man can not walk straight because alcohol has hurt the little  brain; he can not think straight because it has poisoned the large brain.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: THE BRAIN AND THE SPINAL CORD.]    C, the large brain (_cerebrum_).

Everything coming  from Italy has the right to be romantic and artistic. If it happens to  be a voice, it should of necessity be beautiful in quality, rich,  smooth, and well trained.    [Illustration: To Mrs. Harriette Brower cordially Giuseppe De Luca]    While all singers who come from the sunny land cannot boast all these  qualifications, Mr. De Luca, baritone of the Metropolitan Opera House,  New York, can do so. Gifted with a naturally fine organ, he has  cultivated it arduously and to excellent purpose. He began to study in  early youth, became a student of Saint Cecilia in Rome when fifteen  years of age, and made his debut at about twenty. He has sung in opera  ever since.    In 1915,--November 25th to be exact--De Luca came to the Metropolitan,  and won instant recognition from critics and public alike. It is said of  him that he earned \"this success by earnest and intelligent work.  Painstaking to a degree, there is no detail of his art that he neglects  or slights--so that one hesitates to decide whether he is greater as a  singer or as an actor.\" Perhaps, however, his most important quality is  his mastery of \"_bel canto_\"--pure singing--that art which seems to  become constantly rarer on the operatic and concert stage.    \"De Luca does such beautiful, finished work; every detail is carefully  thought out until it is as perfect as can be.\" So remarked a member of  the Metropolitan, and a fellow artist.    Those who have listened to the Roman baritone in the various roles he  has assumed, have enjoyed his fine voice, his true _bel canto_ style,  and his versatile dramatic skill. He has never disappointed his public,  and more than this, is ever ready to step into the breach should  necessity arise.    A man who has at least a hundred and twenty operas at his tongue's end,  who has been singing in the greatest opera houses of the world for more  than twenty years, will surely have much to tell which can help those  who are farther down the line. If he is willing to do so, can speak the  vernacular, and can spare a brief hour from the rush of constant study  and engagement, a conference will be possible. It was possible, for time  was made for it.      THE MUSICAL GIFT    Mr. De Luca, who speaks the English language remarkably well, greeted  the writer with easy courtesy. His genial manner makes one feel at home  immediately. Although he had just come from the Opera House, where he  had sung an important role, he seemed as fresh and rested as though  nothing had happened.    \"I think the ability to act, and also, in a measure, to sing, is a  gift,\" began the artist. \"I remember, even as a little child, I was  always acting out in pantomime or mimicry what I had seen and felt. If I  was taken to the theater, I would come home, place a chair for audience,  and act out the whole story I had just seen before it. From my youngest  years I always wanted to sing and act.      A REMARKABLE TEACHER    \"As early as I could, at about the age of fifteen, I began to study  singing, with a most excellent teacher; who was none other than Signor  Wenceslao Persischini, who is now no longer living. He trained no fewer  than seventy-four artists, of which I was the last. Battestini, that  wonderful singer, whose voice to-day, at the age of sixty-five, is as  remarkable as ever, is one of his pupils. We know that if a vocal  teacher sings himself, and has faults, his pupils are bound to copy  those faults instinctively and unconsciously. With Persischini this  could not be the case; for, owing to some throat trouble, he was not  able to sing at all. He could only whisper the tones he wanted,  accompanying them with signs and facial grimaces.\" And Mr. De Luca  illustrated these points in most amusing fashion. Then he continued:    \"But he had unerring judgment, together with the finest ear. He knew  perfectly how the tone should be sung and the student was obliged to do  it exactly right and must keep at it till it was right. He would let  nothing faulty pass without correction. I also had lessons in acting  from Madame Marini, a very good teacher of the art.      THE ARTIST LIFE    \"After five years of hard study I made my debut at Piacenza, as  Valentine, in _Faust_, November 6th, 1897. Then, you may remember, I  came to the Metropolitan in the season of 1915-1916, where I have been  singing continually ever since.    \"The artist should have good health, that he may be always able to sing.  He owes this to his public, to be always ready, never to disappoint. I  think I have never disappointed an audience and have always been in good  voice. It seems to me when one is no longer able to do one's best it is  time to stop singing.\"    \"It is because you study constantly and systematically that you are  always in good voice.\"    \"Yes, I am always at work. I rise at eight in the morning, not later.  Vocalizes are never neglected. I often sing them as I take my bath. Some  singers do not see the necessity of doing exercises every day; I am not  one of those. I always sing my scales, first with full power, then  taking each tone softly, swelling to full strength, then dying away--in  mezza voce. I use many other exercises also--employing full power.  English is also one of the daily studies, with lessons three times a  week.      CONSTANTLY ON THE WATCH    \"When singing a role, I am always listening--watching--to be conscious  of just what I am doing. I am always criticizing myself. If a tone or a  phrase does not sound quite correct to me as to placement, or  production, I try to correct the fault at once. I can tell just how I am  singing a tone or phrase by the feeling and sensation. Of course I  cannot hear the full effect; no singer ever can actually hear the effect  of his work, except on the records. There he can learn, for the first  time, just how his voice sounds.      LEARNING A NEW ROLE    \"How do I begin a new part? I first read over the words and try to get a  general idea of their meaning, and how I would express the ideas. I try  over the arias and get an idea of those. Then comes the real work--the  memorizing and working out the conception. I first commit the words, and  know them so well I can write them out. Next I join them to the music.  So far I have worked by myself. After this much has been done, I call in  the accompanist, as I do not play the piano very well; that is to say,  my right hand will go but the left lags behind!      ALWAYS BEING SURE OF THE WORDS    \"Yes, as you say, it requires constant study to keep the various roles  in review, especially at the Metropolitan, where the operas are changed  from day to day. Of course at performance the prompter is always there  to give the cue--yet the words must always be in mind. I have never yet  forgotten a word or phrase. On one occasion--it was in the _Damnation of  Faust_, a part I had already sung a number of times--I thought of a word  that was coming, and seemed utterly unable to remember it. I grew quite  cold with fear--I am inclined to be a little nervous anyway--but it was  quite impossible to think of the word. Luckily at the moment when I  needed the word I was so fearful about, it suddenly came to me.      NATURAL ANXIETY    \"Of course there is always anxiety for the artist with every public  appearance. There is so much responsibility--one must always be at  one's best; and the responsibility increases as one advances, and begins  to realize more and more keenly how much is expected and what depends on  one's efforts. I can assure you we all feel this, from the least to the  greatest. The most famous singers perhaps suffer most keenly.    \"I have always sung in Italian opera, in which the language is easy for  me. Latterly I have added French operas to my list. _Samson and  Delilah_, which I had always done in Italian, I had to relearn in  French; this for me was very difficult. I worked a long time on it, but  mastered it at last.    \"This is my twenty-second season in opera. I have a repertoire of about  one hundred and twenty roles, in most of which I have sung many times in  Italy. Some I wish might be brought out at the Metropolitan. Verdi's  _Don Carlos_, for instance, has a beautiful baritone part; it is really  one of the fine operas, though it might be considered a bit  old-fashioned to-day. Still I think it would be a success here. I am  preparing several new parts for this season; one of them is the  Tschaikowsky work--_Eugene Onegin_. So you see I am constantly at work.    \"My favorite operas? I think they are these\"; and Mr. De Luca hastily  jotted down the following: _Don Carlos, Don Giovanni, Hamlet, Rigoletto,  Barbier, Damnation of Faust_, and last, but not least, _Tannhauser_.      GROWTH OF MUSICAL APPRECIATION IN AMERICA    Asked if he considered appreciation for music had advanced during his  residence in America, his answer was emphatically in the affirmative.    \"The other evening I attended a reception of representative American  society, among whom were many frequenters of the Metropolitan. Many of  them spoke to me of the opera _Marouf_. I was surprised, for this modern  French opera belongs to the new idiom, and is difficult to understand.  'Do you really like the music of _Marouf_?' I asked. 'Oh, yes indeed,'  every one said. It is one of my longest parts, but not one of my special  favorites.    \"In the summer! Ah, I go back to my beloved Italy almost as soon as the  Metropolitan season closes. I could sing in Buenos Aires, as the season  there follows the one here. But I prefer to rest the whole time until I  return. I feel the singer needs a period of rest each year. To show you  how necessary it is for the singer to do daily work on the voice, I  almost feel I cannot sing at all during the summer, as I do no  practicing, and without vocalizes one cannot keep in trim.
