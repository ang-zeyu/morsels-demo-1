Besides these signs, the  party were elated by other encouraging marks. After some further  search, but without meeting with any greater success, the party  determined to proceed to the Red Indian Lake. On reaching this  magnificent sheet of water, they found around its shores abundant  evidence that this had been for a long time the central and  undisturbed rendezvous of the tribe. At several places by the margin  of the lake were found small clusters of summer and winter wigwams,  but all in ruins--one large wooden building, presumed to have been  used for the purpose of drying and smoking venison, was found in a  perfect state. The repositories for the dead were found perfect, and  in one of these the party discovered the remains of the ill-fated Mary  March, whom the Indians had placed by the side of her unfortunate  husband. On the north-side of this lake, opposite the River Exploits,  were seen the extremities of two deer fences, about half a mile apart,  where they lead to the water--and in gliding down the river, the  attention of the traveller is arrested by a continuation of these  fences which extend from the lake downwards on the banks of the river  at least thirty miles. After spending several days in wandering round  the margin of the lake, and having fully satisfied themselves that no  encampment of the Indians was to be found there, they returned.  Subsequently to this excursion, a party of men under the direction of  an Institution termed the \"Boeothick Institution,\" which was  established with the view of benefiting the Indians, were sent on the  same errand, but they too returned after a fruitless search, and with  this attempt ends all efforts that have been made to open a  communication with the Red Indians.    And now what opinion may be reasonably formed after a careful  consideration of all the foregoing facts? Shall it be concluded as  many, nay, as most people have done, that the Red Indians are wholly  extinct? The mind is slow to entertain so painful a conclusion, and  more especially as there is some reason to hope that the tribe, to  some extent at least, yet survives.    If indeed Shaw-na-dith-it's statement is to be taken as of  unquestionable authority, and is not to be subjected to any scrutiny,  then indeed but slight hopes can be entertained of the existence of  any of her race; but if the information she supplied be compared with  that conveyed to us through various other sources, then a very  different conclusion may be most legitimately reached.    And first let Shaw-na-dith-it's recital of the circumstances connected  with Captain Buchan's visit to the Great Lake in the winter of 1810  and 1811 be contrasted with that gentleman's own statement of the same  facts.    Shaw-na-dith-it when entering into the particulars of the condition of  her tribe at the period just referred to, said it consisted of no more  than seventy two persons, and whom she thus further described: In the  principal encampment, that which Captain Buchan surprised, there were  in one mamaseek or wigwam four men, five women and six children--in a  second mamaseek there were four men, two women and six children--in a  third mamaseek there were three men, five woman, and seven  children--in the whole forty-two persons. In the second encampment  there were thirteen persons, and in the third seventeen persons,  making in the whole seventy-two; the two smaller encampments being  several miles distant from the larger one. Now, compare this account  with what Captain Buchan saw, bearing in mind that it was only the  larger encampment he surprised,--of the two smaller ones, it does not  appear that he was at all aware, Shaw-na-dith-it states the encampment  contained forty-two persons, of whom nineteen were children. Captain  Buchan asserts in his official Report, that it contained seventy-five  persons, and it is by no means clear that in this number he included  any of the women or children, as in another part of his report, he  estimates the number of the Red Indians as consisting at least of  three hundred persons--an opinion formed solely from the appearances  which the one encampment presented. Then we have the testimony of a  writer, an anonymous one it is true, yet it is evidently the testimony  of a person who was present at the scenes he describes, and he tells  us that in 1819 he estimated the number of Indians he saw, at from  three to four hundred, including women and children. Then again, we  find Mr. Cormack, in 1827, declaring \"that hundreds of Indians must  have been in existence not many years ago,\" otherwise it would be  impossible to account for the great extent of deer fences which he  found so late as the period above-named, yet in being. And lastly, we  have the opinions of the Micmacs, who are so satisfied of the  continued existence of the Red Indian tribe, that they can with  difficulty be made to comprehend that it is possible to entertain a  doubt of a fact, which to them appears so palpable. Their opinion is  that the whole tribe of Boeothicks passed over to the Labrador some  twenty or twenty-five years since, and the place of their final  embarkation, as they allege, is yet plainly discernable.    In the _Royal Gazette_, dated the 2nd September, 1828, there appears a  statement referring to the Red Indians, of which the following is a  copy:--\"Nippers Harbor, where the Red Indians were said to have been  seen three weeks ago, and where one of their arrows was picked up,  after having been ineffectually shot at one of the settlers, is in  Green Bay.\" This accumulation of facts, all of a widely different  character from Shaw-na-dith-it's testimony, would seem, to render the  latter more than doubtful, and it ought to be borne in mind that  Shaw-na-dith-it acquired a knowledge of the English language very  slowly; and though it is said that before her death she could  communicate with tolerable ease, yet it would be incorrect to assume  that she could, without fear of mistake, make such a detailed  statement as that which is attributed to her; but even allowing that  which is most uncertain,--allowing that she expressed herself with  tolerable clearness, and admitting that the parties to whom she made  her communication fully understood her broken English, and were  acquainted with the Boeothick words, which it was her wont to mingle  in all she said--admitting all this--yet even in this view of the  case, it may not be difficult to suppose a reason for her giving an  incorrect account of the state of her tribe. Shaw-na-dith-it knew from  bitter experience, that all former attempts made by Europeans to open  a communication with the Red Indians, had to the latter issued only in  the most disastrous and fatal results. She knew too the antipathy her  own people had to the whites,--so great was this, that she feared to  return to them, believing that the mere fact of her having resided  among the whites for a time would make her an object of hatred to the  Red man.--Knowing all this, is it a violent deduction to draw from all  the circumstances surrounding this subject, that Shaw-na-dith-it in  very love for her own people, may have purposely given an incorrect  account of the numbers of her tribe--lessening it, in the hope that by  so doing no further search would be made for then. Supposing it  possible that such may have been the case, then, it follows that  Shaw-na-dith-it may not have been, as many persons have presumed her  to be, the last of the Boeothicks.    Some account of the usages and habits of this people, and of such  particulars as have special reference to them, will now close this  narrative: and first it may be observed that the extensive works which  they completed and kept in repair for a number of years, would seem to  indicate, and that almost beyond a doubt, that the Boeothicks were  once a numerous and energetic tribe.    That they were intelligent, their buildings, store-houses, &c., would  appear to be a sufficient evidence. Their mamaseeks, for such was the  word they used to describe their habitations, were far superior to the  wigwams of the Micmacs. The dwellings of the Boeothicks were in  general built of straight pieces of fir, about twelve feet high,  flattened at the sides, and driven in the earth close to each other,  the corners being made stronger than the other parts. The crevices  were filled up with moss, and the inside lined with the same material;  the roof was raised so as to slant from all parts and meet in a point  in the centre, where a hole was left for the smoke to escape--the  remainder of thereof was covered with a treble coat of birch bark, and  between the first and second layers of bark was placed about six  inches of moss--about the chimney clay was substituted for the moss.  The sides of these mamaseeks were covered with arms--that is, bows,  arrows, clubs, stone hatchets, arrow heads, and all these were  arranged in the neatest manner. Beams were placed across where the  roof began, over which smaller ones were laid; and on the latter were  piled their provisions--dried salmon, venison, &c.    That the Boeothicks were a bold, heroic, self-dependant tribe, few  will be disposed to question, when it is remembered that they never  courted the friendship of, neither were they ever subdued by, any  other tribe, or by Europeans--by the combined efforts of both Micmacs  and Whites, their numbers were greatly reduced, if not utterly  exterminated, but they were never conquered.      BOEOTHICK DRESS.    This was peculiar to the tribe, and consisted of but one garment--a  sort of mantle formed out of two deer skins, sewed together so as to  be nearly square--a collar also formed with skins was sometimes  attached to the mantle, and reached along its whole breadth--it was  formed without sleeves or buttons, and was worn thrown over the  shoulders, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15127"],[0,"Pitman's Commercial Spanish Grammar (2nd ed.)

We shall divide the Personal Pronouns into Subject Pronouns and Object  Pronouns.[72]    [Footnote 72: Grammarians often give the names--            Nominative case for the Subject pronouns            Accusative \" \" \" Direct object pronouns            Dative \" \" \" Indirect object pronouns]    +----------------------------------------------------+  |                    Subject Pronouns.               |  +--------------------------+-------------------------+  |Yo (I)                    |Nosotros,-as (we)        |  |Tu (thou)                 |Vosotros,-as (you)       |  |El (he, or it, _m._)      |Ellos,-as (they)         |  |Ella (she, or it, _f._)   |Ello (_neuter_),         |  |                          |(it, referring to a      |  |                          |  whole statement)       |  +--------------------------+-------------------------+    Instead of \"Tu\" or \"Vosotros,-as,\" =V=. and =Vs=. are used in general  conversation as already stated (the verb following in the 3rd person).    N.B.--These pronouns are left understood when no emphasis is required or  where no ambiguity is possible, as--    (Yo) compro las telas: I buy the cloths.  (El) gira las letras y firma las cartas: He draws the bills and signs  the letters.  (Ella) ha tenido una entrevista con su abogado: She has had an interview  with her barrister, lawyer or solicitor.    But--    Yo he comprado la partida de ferreteria y quincalla y no V.: _I_ have  bought the lot of ironware and small ware and not _you_.      =Object Pronouns=.    These are divided into two classes--1. =Disjunctive=, viz., following a  preposition--      Mi (me)               Nosotros-as (us)    Ti (thee)             Vosotros-as (you)    El (him, it, _m._)    Ellos-as (them)    Ella (her, it, _f._)  Ello (_neuter_) (it, referring                                 to a whole statement)    V. (you, sing.)       Vs. (you, pl.)      EXAMPLES--    Ellos hablan de mi: They speak of me.  Nosotros trabajamos para el: We work for him.  Ella confia en ti, en V.: She trusts thee, you.  V. se declara contra ellos: You declare against them.    2. =Conjunctive=, viz., _direct_ or _indirect object_ of verb (without a  preposition).      El me[73] ama (he loves me)        El nos ama (he loves us)    El te ama (he loves thee)          El os ama (he loves you)    El lo _or_ le ama (he loves        El los ama (he loves them,            him, it, _m._)                _m._)    El la ama (he loves her,           El las ama (he loves them,            or it, _f._)                  _f._)    [Footnote 73: N.B.--In the conjunctive form the 1st and 2nd persons are  the same for both direct and indirect objects, but the 3rd pers.  differs.]      EXAMPLES of _Indirect Object_--    El me da       he gives me (to me)  El te da       he gives thee (to thee)  El le da       he gives him (to him), her (to her), it (to it)  El nos da      he gives us (to us)  El os da       he gives you (to you)  El les da      he gives them (to them, _m._ and _f._)      The direct and indirect object of verb may also be rendered by the  pronoun in the Disjunctive form preceded by =a=, as--    a mi            me _or_ to me        direct and indirect object  a ti            thee _or_ to thee       \"    \"      \"       \"  a el            him _or_ to him,        \"    \"      \"       \"                    it _(m.) or_          \"    \"      \"       \"                    to it _(m.)_          \"    \"      \"       \"  a ella          her _or_ to her,        \"    \"      \"       \"                    it _(f.) or_          \"    \"      \"       \"                    to it _(f.)_          \"    \"      \"       \"  a nosotros-as   us _or_ to us           \"    \"      \"       \"  a vosotros-as   you _or_ to you         \"    \"      \"       \"  a ellos         them _or_               \"    \"      \"       \"                    to them _(m.)_        \"    \"      \"       \"  a ellas         them _or_               \"    \"      \"       \"                    to them _(f.)_        \"    \"      \"       \"      We have then a double form for the pronouns used as direct and indirect  object of verb--one Conjunctive, the other Disjunctive.    The =Conjunctive= form is that in general use.    The =Disjunctive= form is employed when emphasis or distinctness is  required. It is seldom used alone,[74] Spaniards preferring to use it as  a repetition after having used the Conjunctive form, as--    El me ama a mi: He loves _me_.    El nos vende a nosotros generos estampados y a V.  generos de fantasia: He sells to _us_ printed cloth and to _you_  fancies.    Yo le quiero ver a el y no a ella: I wish to see _him_ and  not _her_.    Dele V. el dinero a el y los libros a ella.  Give _him_ the money and _her_ the books.    De V. el dinero a el y los libros a ella.  Give _him_ the money and _her_ the books.
