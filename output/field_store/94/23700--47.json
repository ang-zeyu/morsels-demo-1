Wine is my constant  companion,\" said Debendra.    \"But why should it be?\" replied Surendra. \"Wine was not born with you;  you can't take it away with you. Many give it up, why should not you  do so?\"    \"What have I to gain by giving it up? Those who do so have some  happiness in prospect, and therefore give it up. For me there is no  happiness.\"    \"Then to save your life give it up.\"    \"Those to whom life brings happiness may give up wine; but what have I  to gain by living?\"    Surendra's eyes filled with tears. Full of love for his friend, he  urged:    \"Then for my sake give it up.\"    Tears came into the eyes of Debendra as he said: \"No one but yourself  urges me to walk in virtuous paths. If I ever do give it up it will be  for your sake, and--\"    \"And what?\"    \"If ever I hear that my wife is dead I will give up drink. Otherwise,  whether I live or die, I care not.\"    Surendra, with moist eyes, mentally anathematising Hembati, took his  leave.          CHAPTER IX.    SURJA MUKHI'S LETTER.      Dearest Srimati Kamal Mani Dasi, long may you live!    \"I am ashamed to address you any longer with a blessing. You have  become a woman, and the mistress of a house. Still I cannot think of  you otherwise than as my younger sister. I have brought you up to  womanhood, I taught you your letters; but now when I see your writing  I am ashamed to send this scrawl. But of what use to be ashamed? My  day is over; were it not so how should I be in this condition? What  condition?--it is a thing I cannot speak of to any one; should I do  so there will be sorrow and shame; yet if I do not tell some one of my  heart's trouble I cannot endure it. To whom can I speak? You are my  beloved sister; except you no one loves me. Also it concerns your  brother. I can speak of it to no one but you.    \"I have prepared my own funeral pyre. If I had not cared for Kunda  Nandini, and she had died, would that have been any loss to me? God  cares for so many others--would He not have cared for her? Why did I  bring her home to my own destruction! When you saw that unfortunate  being she was a child, now she is seventeen or eighteen. I admit she  is beautiful; her beauty is fatal to me. If I have any happiness on  earth it is in my husband; if I care about anything in this world it  is for my husband; if there is any wealth belonging to me it is my  husband: this husband Kunda Nandini is snatching from me. If I have a  desire on earth it is for my husband's love: of that love Kunda  Nandini is cheating me. Do not think evil of your brother; I am not  reproaching him. He is virtuous, not even his enemies can find a  fault in him. I can see daily that he tries to subdue his heart.  Wherever Kunda Nandini may happen to be, from that spot, if possible,  he averts his eyes; unless there is absolute necessity he does not  speak her name. He is even harsh towards her; I have heard him scold  her when she has committed no fault. Then why am I writing all this  trash? Should a man ask this question it would be difficult to make  him understand, but you being a woman will comprehend. If Kunda  Nandini is in his eyes but as other women, why is he so careful not to  look towards her? why take such pains to avoid speaking her name? He  is conscious of guilt towards Kunda Nandini, therefore he scolds her  without cause; that anger is not with her, but with himself; that  scolding is not for her, but for himself. This I can understand. I who  have been so long devoted to him, who within and without see only him,  if I but see his shadow I can tell his thoughts. What can he hide from  me? Occasionally when his mind is absent his eyes wander hither and  thither; do I not know what they are seeking? If he meets it, again  becoming troubled he withdraws his eyes; can I not understand that?  For whose voice is he listening at meal-times when he pauses in the  act of carrying food to his mouth? and when Kunda's tones reach his  ear, and he fastens to eat his meal, can one not understand that? My  beloved always had a gracious countenance; why is he now always so  absent-minded? If one speaks to him he does not hear, but gives an  absent answer. If, becoming angry, I say, 'May I die?' paying no  attention he answers, 'Yes.' If I ask where his thoughts are, he says  with his lawsuits; but I know they have no place in his mind; when he  speaks of his lawsuits he is always merry. Another point. One day the  old women of the neighbourhood were speaking of Kunda Nandini, pitying  her young widowhood, her unprotected condition. Your brother came up;  from within I saw his eyes fill with tears; he turned away and left  them quickly. The other day I engaged a new servant; her name is  Kumuda. Sometimes the Babu calls Kumuda; when so doing he often slips  out the name Kunda instead of Kumuda, then how confused he is--why  should he be confused? I cannot say he is neglectful of me, or  unaffectionate; rather he is more attentive than before, more  affectionate. The reason of this I fully understand: he is conscious  of fault towards me; but I know that I have no longer a place in his  heart. Attention is one thing, love quite another; the difference  between these two we women can easily understand.    \"There is another amusing matter. A learned _pandit_ in Calcutta,  named Iswara Chandra Bidya Sagar, has published a book on the marriage  of widows. If he who would establish the custom of marrying widows is  a _pandit_, then who can be called a dunce? Just now, the Brahman  Bhattacharjya bringing the book into the _boita khana_, there was a  great discussion.    \"After much talk in favour of widow-marriage, the Brahman, taking ten  rupees from the Babu for the repairs of the _Tote_,[6] went his way.  On the following day Sharbabhoum Thakur replied on the same subject. I  had some golden bracelets made for his daughter's wedding. No one else  was in favour of widow-marriage.    [Footnote 6: The village school in which Sanscrit is taught.]    \"I have taken up much time in wearying you with my sorrows. Do I not  know how vexed you will be? but what can I do, sister? If I do not  tell you my sorrows, to whom shall I tell them? I have not said all  yet, but hoping for some relief from you has calmed me a little. Say  nothing of this to anyone; above all, I conjure you, show not this  letter to your husband. Will you not come and see me? if you will come  now your presence will heal many of my troubles. Send me quickly news  of your husband and of your child.    \"SURJA MUKHI.    \"P.S.--Another word. If I can get rid of this girl I may be happy once  more; but how to get rid of her? Can you take her? Would you not fear  to do so?\"    Kamal Mani replied--    \"You have become quite foolish, else how can you doubt your husband's  heart? Do not lose faith in him; if you really cannot trust him you  had better drown yourself. I, Kamal Mani, tell you you had better  drown yourself. She who can no longer trust her husband had better  die.\"          CHAPTER X.    THE SPROUT.      On the course of a short time Nagendra's whole nature was changed. As  at eventime, in the hot season, the clear sky becomes suddenly veiled  in cloud, so Nagendra's mind became clouded. Surja Mukhi wept  secretly.    She thought to herself, \"I will take Kamal Mani's advice. Why should I  doubt my husband's heart? His heart is firm as the hills. I am under a  delusion. Perhaps he is suffering in health.\" Alas! Surja Mukhi was  building a bridge of sand.    In the house there dwelt a sort of doctor. Surja Mukhi was the  house-mistress. Sitting behind the _purdah_ (a half-transparent  screen) she held converse with everyone, the person addressed  remaining in the verandah. Calling the doctor, Surja Mukhi said--    \"The Babu is not well; why do you not give him medicine?\"    \"Is he ill? I did not know of it; I have heard nothing.\"    \"Has not the Babu told you?\"    \"No; what is the matter?\"    \"What is the matter? Are you a doctor, and do you ask that? Do I  know?\"    The doctor was nonplussed, and saying, \"I will go and inquire,\" he was  about to leave; but Surja Mukhi, calling him back, said, \"Do not ask  the Babu about it; give him some medicine.\"    The doctor thought this a peculiar sort of treatment; but there was no  lack of medicine in the house, and going to the dispensary, he  composed a draught of soda, port-wine, and some simple drugs, and,  filling a bottle, labelled it, \"To be taken twice a day.\"    Surja Mukhi took the physic to her husband, and requested him to drink  it. Nagendra, taking the bottle, read the inscription, and, hurling it  away, struck a cat with it. The cat fled, her tail drenched with the  physic.    Surja Mukhi said: \"If you will not take the medicine, at least tell me  what is your complaint.\"    Nagendra, annoyed, said, \"What complaint have I?\"    \"Look at yourself,\" replied Surja Mukhi, \"and see how thin you have  become,\" and she held a mirror before him.    Nagendra, taking the mirror from her, threw it down and smashed it to  atoms.    Surja Mukhi began to weep. With an angry look Nagendra went away.  Meeting a servant in the outer room, the Babu struck him for no fault.  Surja Mukhi felt as if _she_ had received the blow. Formerly Nagendra  had been of a very calm temper; now the least thing made him angry.    Nor was this all. One night, the hour for the meal being already past,  Nagendra had not come in. Surja Mukhi sat expecting him. At length,  when he appeared, she was astonished at his looks. His face and eyes  were inflamed--he had been drinking, and as he had never been given to  drinking before his wife was shocked. From that time it became a daily  custom.    One day Surja Mukhi, casting herself at his feet, choking down the  sobs in her throat, with much humility entreated, \"For my sake give  this up.\"    Nagendra asked angrily, \"What is my fault?\"    Surja Mukhi said: \"If you do not know what is the fault, how"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17456"],[0,"The Romance of a Christmas Card (#8)"],[1,"ide, now that she  can't tell hers. When I looked at those two babies the day I left you,  I thought of them only as retribution; and the vision of them--ugly,  wrinkled, writhing little creatures--has been in my mind ever since.\"    \"They were compensation, not retribution, David. I ought to have told  you how clever and beautiful they were, but you never asked and my  pride was up in arms. A man should stand by his own flesh and blood,  even if it isn't attractive; that's what I believe.\"    \"I know, I know! But I've had no feeling for three years. I've been  like a frozen man, just drifting, trying to make both ends meet, my  heart dead and my body full of pain. I'm just out of a hospital--two  months in all.\"    \"David! Why didn't you let me know, or send for me?\"    \"Oh, it was way out in Missouri. I was taken ill very suddenly at the  hotel in St. Joseph and they moved me at once. There were two  operations first and last, and I didn't know enough to feed myself  most of the time.\"    \"Poor, poor Buddy! Did you have good care?\"    \"The best. I had more than care. Ruth Bentley, the nurse that brought  me back to life, made me see what a useless creature I was.\"    Some woman's instinct stirred in Letty at a new note in her brother's  voice and a new look in his face. She braced herself for his next  words, sure that they would open a fresh chapter. The door and the  window were closed now, the shades pulled down, the fire low; the hour  was ripe for confidences.    \"You see, Letty,\"--and David cleared his throat nervously, and looked  at the coals gleaming behind the Hessian soldiers,--\"it's a time for a  thorough housecleaning, body, mind, and soul, a long illness is; and  Miss Bentley knew well enough that all was wrong with me. I mentioned  my unhappy marriage and told her all about you, but I said nothing  about the children.\"    \"Why should you?\" asked Letty, although her mind had leaped to the  reason already.    \"Well, I was a poor patient in one of the cheapest rooms; broken in  health, without any present means of support. I wanted to stand well  with her, she had been so good to me, and I thought if she knew about  the twins she wouldn't believe I could ever make a living for three.\"    \"Still less for _four_!\" put in Letty, with an irrepressible note of  teasing in her tone.    She had broken the ice. Like a torrent set free, David dashed into the  story of the last two months and Ruth Bentley's wonderful influence.  How she had recreated him within as well as without. How she was the  best and noblest of women, willing to take a pauper by the hand and  brace him up for a new battle with life.    \"Strength appeals to me,\" confessed David. \"Perhaps it's because I am  weak; for I'm afraid I am, a little!\"    \"Be careful, Davy! Eva was strong!\"    David shuddered. He remembered a strength that lashed and buffeted and  struck and overpowered.    \"Ruth is different,\" he said. \"'Out of the strong came forth  sweetness' used to be one of Parson Larrabee's texts. That's Ruth's  kind of strength.--Can I--will you let me bring her here to see you,  Letty,--say for New Year's? It's all so different from the last time I  asked you. Then I knew I was bringing you nothing but sorrow and pain,  but Ruth carries her welcome in her face.\"    The prop inside of Letty wavered unsteadily for a moment and then  stood in its accustomed upright position.    \"Why not?\" she asked. \"It's the right thing to do; but you must tell  her about the children first.\"    \"Oh! I did that long ago, after I found out that she cared. It was  only at first that I didn't dare. I haven't told you, but she went out  for her daily walk and brought me home a Christmas card, the prettiest  one she could find, she said. I was propped up on pillows, as weak as  a kitten. I looked at it and looked at it, and when I saw that it was  this room, the old fireplace and mother's picture, and the Hessian  soldier andirons, when I realized there was a face at the window and  that the door was ajar,--everything just swam before me and I fainted  dead away. I had a relapse, and when I was better again I told her  everything. She's fond of children. It didn't make any difference,  except for her to say that the more she had to do for me, the more she  wanted to do it.\"    \"Well,\" said Letty with a break in her voice, \"that's love, so far as  I can see, and if you've been lucky enough to win it, take it and be  thankful, and above all, nurse and keep it.--So one of Reba's cards,  the one the publisher thought would never sell, found you and brought  you back! How wonderful! We little thought of that, Reba and I!\"    \"Reba's work didn't stop there, Letty! There was so much that had to  be said between you and me, just now, that I couldn't let another  subject creep in till it was finished and we were friends;--but Dick  Larrabee saw Reba's card about 'the folks back home' in Chicago and  he bought a ticket for Beulah just as I did. We met in the train and  compared notes.\"    \"Dick Larrabee home?\"    The blood started in Letty's heart and sped hither and thither,  warming her from head to foot.    \"Yes, looking as fit as a fiddle; the way a man looks when things are  coming his way.\"    \"But what did the card mean to him? Did he seem to like Reba's  verses?\"    \"Yes, but I guess the card just spelled home to him; and he recognized  this house in a minute, of course. I showed him my card and he said:  'That's Letty fast enough: I know the cape.' He recognized you in a  minute, he said.\"    He knew the cape! Yes, the old cape had been close to his shoulder  many a time. He liked it and said it matched her hair.    \"He was awfully funny about your ear, too! I told him I never noticed  women's ears, and he said he did, when they were pretty, and their  eyelashes, too.--Anything remarkable about your eyelashes, Letty?\"    \"Nothing that I'm aware of!\" said Letty laughingly, although she was  fibbing and she knew it.    \"And he said he'd call and say 'Merry Christmas' to you the first  thing to-morrow; that he would have been here to-night but you'd know  his father had to come first. You don't mind being second to the  parson, do you?\"    No, Letty didn't mind. Her heart was unaccountably light and glad,  like a girl's heart. It was the Eve of Mary when all women are blest  because of one. The Wise Men brought gifts to the Child; Letty had  often brought hers timidly, devoutly, trustfully, and perhaps to-night  they were coming back to her!          [Illustration]    VIII      \"Put the things down on the front steps,\" said Dick to the driver as  he neared the parsonage. \"If there's nobody at home I'll go on up to  the church after I've got this stuff inside.\"    \"Got a key?\"    \"No, don't need one. I've picked all the locks with a penknife many a  time. Besides, the key is sure to be under the doormat. Yes, here it  is! Of all the unaccountable customs I ever knew, that's the most  laughable!\"    \"Works all right for you!\"    \"Yes, and for all the other tramps,\"--and Dick opened the door and  lifted in his belongings. \"Good-night,\" he called to the driver; \"I'll  walk up to the church after I've found out whether mother keeps the  mince pie and cider apple sauce in the same old place.\"    A few minutes later, his hunger partially stayed, Dick Larrabee locked  the parsonage door and took the well-trodden path across the church  common. It was his father's feet, he knew, that had worn the shoveled  path so smooth; his kind, faithful feet that had sped to and fro on  errands of mercy, never faltering in all the years.    It was nearly eight o'clock. The sound of the melodeon, with  children's voices, floated out from the white-painted meeting-house,  all ablaze with light; or as much ablaze as a kerosene chandelier and  six side lamps could make it. The horse sheds were crowded with teams  of various sorts, the horses well blanketed and standing comfortably  in straw; and the last straggler was entering the right-hand door of  the church as Dick neared the steps. Simultaneously the left-hand door  opened, and on the background of the light inside appeared the figure  of Mrs. Todd, the wife of his ancient enemy, the senior deacon. Dick  could see that a sort of dressing-room had been curtained off in the  little entry, as it had often been in former times of tableaux and  concerts and what not. Valor, not discretion, was the better policy,  and walking boldly up to the steps Dick took off his fur cap and  said, \"Good-evening, Mrs. Todd!\"    \"Good gracious me! Where under the canopy did you hail from, Dick  Larrabee? Was your folks lookin' for you? They ain't breathed a word  to none of us.\"    \"No, I'm a surprise, Mrs. Todd.\"    \"Well, I know you've given me one! Will you wait a spell till the  recitations is over? You'd scare the children so, if you go in now,  that they'd forget their pieces more'n they gen'ally do.\"    \"I can endure the loss of the 'pieces,'\" said Dick with a twinkle in  his eye.    At which Mrs. Todd laughed comprehendingly, and said: \"Isaac'll get a  stool or a box or something; there ain't a vacant seat in the church.  I wish we could say the same o' Sundays!--Isaac! Isaac! Come out and  see who's here,\" she called under her breath. \"He won't be long. He's  tendin' John Trimble in the dressin'-room. He was the only one in the  village that was willin' to be Santa Claus an' he wa'n't over-willin'.  Now he's et something for supper that disagrees with him awfully and  he's all doubled up with colic. We can't have the tree till the  exercises is over, but that won't be mor'n fifteen minutes, so I sent  Isaac home to make a mustard plaster. He's puttin' it on John now.  John's dreadful solemn and unamusin' when he's well, and I can't think  how he'll act when he's all crumpled up with stomach-ache, an' the  mustard plaster drawin' like fire.\"    Dick threw back his head and laughed. He had forgotten just how  unexpected Beulah's point of view"]]]
