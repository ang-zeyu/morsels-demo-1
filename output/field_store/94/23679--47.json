If, therefore, you  will not obey father and mother and submit to their discipline, then  obey the hangman; if you will not obey him, then submit to the  skeleton-man, i.e., death [death the all-subduer, the teacher of  wicked children]. For on this God insists peremptorily: Either if you  obey Him rendering love and service, He will reward you abundantly with  all good, or if you offend Him, He will send upon you both death and  the hangman.    Whence come so many knaves that must daily be hanged, beheaded, broken  upon the wheel, but from disobedience [to parents], because they will  not submit to discipline in kindness, so that, by the punishment of  God, they bring it about that we behold their misfortune and grief? For  it seldom happens that such perverse people die a natural or timely  death.    But the godly and obedient have this blessing, that they live long in  pleasant quietness and see their children's children (as said above) to  the third and fourth generation. Thus experience also teaches, that  where there are honorable, old families who fare well and have many  children, they owe their origin to the fact, to be sure, that some of  them were brought up well and were regardful of their parents. On the  other hand, it is written of the wicked, Ps. 109,13: Let his posterity  be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted  out. Therefore heed well how great a thing in God's sight obedience is  since He so highly esteems it, is so highly pleased with it, and  rewards it so richly, and besides enforces punishment so rigorously on  those who act contrariwise.    All this I say that it may be well impressed upon the young. For no one  believes how necessary this commandment is, although it has not been  esteemed and taught hitherto under the papacy. These are simple and  easy words, and everybody thinks he knew them a fore; therefore men  pass them lightly by, are gaping after other matters, and do not see  and believe that God is so greatly offended if they be disregarded, nor  that one does a work so well pleasing and precious if he follows them.    In this commandment belongs a further statement regarding all kinds of  obedience to persons in authority who have to command and to govern.  For all authority flows and is propagated from the authority of  parents. For where a father is unable alone to educate his [rebellious  and irritable] child, he employs a schoolmaster to instruct him; if he  be too weak, he enlists the aid of his friends and neighbors; if he  departs this life, he delegates and confers his authority and  government upon others who are appointed for the purpose. Likewise, he  must have domestics, man-servants and maid-servants, under himself for  the management of the household, so that all whom we call masters are  in the place of parents and must derive their power and authority to  govern from them. Hence also they are all called fathers in the  Scriptures, as those who in their government perform the functions of a  father, and should have a paternal heart toward their subordinates. As  also from antiquity the Romans and other nations called the masters and  mistresses of the household patres- et matresfamiliae that is,  housefathers and housemothers. So also they called their national  rulers and overlords patres patriae, that is fathers of the entire  country, for a great shame to us who would be Christians that we do not  likewise call them so, or, at least do not esteem and honor them as  such.    Now, what a child owes to father and mother, the same owe all who are  embraced in the household. Therefore man-servants and maid-servants  should be careful not only to be obedient to their masters and  mistresses but also to honor them as their own fathers and mothers, and  to do everything which they know is expected of them, not from  compulsion and with reluctance, but with pleasure and joy for the cause  just mentioned, namely that it is God's command and is pleasing to Him  above all other works. Therefore they ought rather to pay wages in  addition and be glad that they may obtain masters and mistresses to  have such joyful consciences and to know how they may do truly golden  works; a matter which has hitherto been neglected and despised, when,  instead, everybody ran in the devil's name, into convents or to  pilgrimages and indulgences, with loss [of time and money] and with an  evil conscience.    If this truth, then, could be impressed upon the poor people, a  servant-girl would leap and praise and thank God; and with her tidy  work for which she receives support and wages she would acquire such a  treasure as all that are esteemed the greatest saints have not  obtained. Is it not an excellent boast to know and say that, if you  perform your daily domestic task, this is better than all the sanctity  and ascetic life of monks? And you have the promise, in addition, that  you shall prosper in all good and fare well. How can you lead a more  blessed or holier life as far as your works are concerned? For in the  sight of God faith is what really renders a person holy, and alone  serves Him, but the works are for the service of man. There you have  everything good, protection and defense in the Lord, a joyful  conscience and a gracious God besides, who will reward you a  hundredfold, so that you are even a nobleman if you be only pious and  obedient. But if not, you have, in the first place, nothing but the  wrath and displeasure of God, no peace of heart, and afterwards all  manner of plagues and misfortunes.    Whoever will not be influenced by this and inclined to godliness we  hand over to the hangman and to the skeleton-man. Therefore let every  one who allows himself to be advised remember that God is not making  sport, and know that it is God who speaks with you and demands  obedience. If you obey Him, you are His dear child; but if you despise  to do it, then take shame, misery, and grief for your reward.    The same also is to be said of obedience to civil government, which (as  we have said) is all embraced in the estate of fatherhood and extends  farthest of all relations. For here the father is not one of a single  family, but of as many people as he has tenants, citizens, or subjects.  For through them, as through our parents, God gives to us food, house  and home, protection and security. Therefore since they bear such name  and title with all honor as their highest dignity, it is our duty to  honor them and to esteem them great as the dearest treasure and the  most precious jewel upon earth.    He, now, who is obedient here, is willing and ready to serve, and  cheerfully does all that pertains to honor, knows that he is pleasing  God and that he will receive joy and happiness for his reward. If he  will not do it in love, but despises and resists [authority] or rebels,  let him also know, on the other hand, that he shall have no favor nor  blessing, and where he thinks to gain a florin thereby, he will  elsewhere lose ten times as much, or become a victim to the hangman,  perish by war, pestilence, and famine, or experience no good in his  children, and be obliged to suffer injury, injustice, and violence at  the hands of his servants, neighbors, or strangers and tyrants; so that  what we seek and deserve is paid back and comes home to us.    If we would ever suffer ourselves to be persuaded that such works are  pleasing to God and have so rich a reward, we would be established in  altogether abundant possessions and have what our heart desires. But  because the word and command of God are so lightly esteemed, as though  some babbler had spoken it, let us see whether you are the man to  oppose Him. How difficult, do you think, it will be for Him to  recompense you! Therefore you would certainly live much better with the  divine favor, peace, and happiness than with His displeasure and  misfortune. Why, think you, is the world now so full of unfaithfulness,  disgrace, calamity, and murder, but because every one desires to be his  own master and free from the emperor, to care nothing for any one, and  do what pleases him? Therefore God punishes one knave by another, so  that, when you defraud and despise your master, another comes and deals  in like manner with you, yea, in your household you must suffer ten  times more from wife, children, or servants.    Indeed, we feel our misfortune, we murmur and complain of  unfaithfulness, violence, and injustice, but will not see that we  ourselves are knaves who have fully deserved this punishment, and yet  are not thereby reformed. We will have no favor and happiness,  therefore it is but fair that we have nothing but misfortune without  mercy. There must still be somewhere upon earth some godly people  because God continues to grant us so much good! On our own account we  should not have a farthing in the house nor a straw in the field. All  this I have been obliged to urge with so many words, in hope that some  one may take it to heart, that we may be relieved of the blindness and  misery in which we are steeped so deeply, and may truly understand the  Word and will of God, and earnestly accept it. For thence we would  learn how we could have joy, happiness, and salvation enough, both  temporal and eternal.    Thus we have two kinds of fathers presented in this commandment,  fathers in blood and fathers in office, or those to whom belongs the  care of the family, and those to whom belongs the care of the country.  Besides these there are yet spiritual fathers; not like those in the  Papacy, who have indeed had themselves called thus, but have performed  no function of the paternal office. For those only are called spiritual  fathers who govern and guide us by the Word of God; as St. Paul boasts  his fatherhood 1 Cor. 4, 15, where he says: In Christ Jesus I hove  begotten you through the Gospel. Now, since they are fathers they are  entitled to their honor, even above all others.

Death was  before their eyes, and everybody began to think of their graves, not of  mirth and diversions.    But even these wholesome reflections, which, rightly managed, would have  most happily led the people to fall upon their knees, make confession of  their sins, and look up to their merciful Savior for pardon, imploring  his compassion on them in such a time of their distress, by which we  might have been as a second Nineveh, had a quite contrary extreme in the  common people, who, ignorant and stupid in their reflections as they  were brutishly wicked and thoughtless before, were now led by their  fright to extremes of folly, and, as I said before, that they ran to  conjurers and witches and all sorts of deceivers, to know what should  become of them, who fed their fears and kept them always alarmed and  awake, on purpose to delude them and pick their pockets: so they were as  mad upon their running after quacks and mountebanks, and every  practicing old woman for medicines and remedies, storing themselves with  such multitudes of pills, potions, and preservatives, as they were  called, that they not only spent their money, but poisoned themselves  beforehand, for fear of the poison of the infection, and prepared their  bodies for the plague, instead of preserving them against it. On the  other hand, it was incredible, and scarce to be imagined, how the posts  of houses and corners of streets were plastered over with doctors'  bills, and papers of ignorant fellows quacking and tampering in physic,  and inviting people to come to them for remedies, which was generally  set off with such flourishes as these; viz., \"INFALLIBLE preventitive  pills against the plague;\" \"NEVER-FAILING preservatives against the  infection;\" \"SOVEREIGN cordials against the corruption of air;\" \"EXACT  regulations for the conduct of the body in case of infection;\"  \"Antipestilential pills;\" \"INCOMPARABLE drink against the plague, never  found out before;\" \"An UNIVERSAL remedy for the plague;\" \"The ONLY TRUE  plague water;\" \"The ROYAL ANTIDOTE against all kinds of infection;\" and  such a number more that I cannot reckon up, and, if I could, would fill  a book of themselves to set them down.    Others set up bills to summon people to their lodgings for direction and  advice in the case of infection. These had specious titles also, such as  these:--        An eminent High-Dutch physician, newly come over from Holland,        where he resided during all the time of the great plague,        last year, in Amsterdam, and cured multitudes of people that        actually had the plague upon them.        An Italian gentlewoman just arrived from Naples, having a        choice secret to prevent infection, which she found out by        her great experience, and did wonderful cures with it in the        late plague there, wherein there died 20,000 in one day.        An ancient gentlewoman having practiced with great success in        the late plague in this city, anno 1636, gives her advice        only to the female sex. To be spoken with, etc.        An experienced physician, who has long studied the doctrine of        antidotes against all sorts of poison and infection, has,        after forty years' practice, arrived at such skill as may,        with God's blessing, direct persons how to prevent being        touched by any contagious distemper whatsoever. He directs        the poor gratis.    I take notice of these by way of specimen. I could give you two or three  dozen of the like, and yet have abundance left behind. It is sufficient  from these to apprise any one of the humor of those times, and how a set  of thieves and pickpockets not only robbed and cheated the poor people  of their money, but poisoned their bodies with odious and fatal  preparations; some with mercury, and some with other things as bad,  perfectly remote from the thing pretended to, and rather hurtful than  serviceable to the body in case an infection followed.    I cannot omit a subtlety of one of those quack operators with which he  gulled the poor people to crowd about him, but did nothing for them  without money. He had, it seems, added to his bills, which he gave out  in the streets, this advertisement in capital letters; viz., \"He gives  advice to the poor for nothing.\"    Abundance of people came to him accordingly, to whom he made a great  many fine speeches, examined them of the state of their health and of  the constitution of their bodies, and told them many good things to do,  which were of no great moment. But the issue and conclusion of all was,  that he had a preparation which, if they took such a quantity of every  morning, he would pawn his life that they should never have the plague,  no, though they lived in the house with people that were infected. This  made the people all resolve to have it, but then the price of that was  so much (I think it was half a crown[65]). \"But, sir,\" says one poor  woman, \"I am a poor almswoman, and am kept by the parish; and your bills  say you give the poor your help for nothing.\"--\"Ay, good woman,\" says  the doctor, \"so I do, as I published there. I give my advice, but not my  physic!\"--\"Alas, sir,\" says she, \"that is a snare laid for the poor  then, for you give them your advice for nothing; that is to say, you  advise them gratis to buy your physic for their money: so does every  shopkeeper with his wares.\" Here the woman began to give him ill words,  and stood at his door all that day, telling her tale to all the people  that came, till the doctor, finding she turned away his customers, was  obliged to call her upstairs again and give her his box of physic for  nothing, which perhaps, too, was good for nothing when she had it.    But to return to the people, whose confusions fitted them to be imposed  upon by all sorts of pretenders and by every mountebank. There is no  doubt but these quacking sort of fellows raised great gains out of the  miserable people; for we daily found the crowds that ran after them were  infinitely greater, and their doors were more thronged, than those of  Dr. Brooks, Dr. Upton, Dr. Hodges, Dr. Berwick, or any, though the most  famous men of the time; and I was told that some of them got five  pounds[66] a day by their physic.    But there was still another madness beyond all this, which may serve to  give an idea of the distracted humor of the poor people at that time,  and this was their following a worse sort of deceivers than any of  these; for these petty thieves only deluded them to pick their pockets  and get their money (in which their wickedness, whatever it was, lay  chiefly on the side of the deceiver's deceiving, not upon the deceived);  but, in this part I am going to mention, it lay chiefly in the people  deceived, or equally in both. And this was in wearing charms,  philters,[67] exorcisms,[68] amulets,[69] and I know not what  preparations to fortify the body against the plague, as if the plague  was not the hand of God, but a kind of a possession of an evil spirit,  and it was to be kept off with crossings,[70] signs of the zodiac,[71]  papers tied up with so many knots, and certain words or figures written  on them, as particularly the word \"Abracadabra,\"[72] formed in triangle  or pyramid; thus,--        A B R A C A D A B R A       A B R A C A D A B R        A B R A C A D A B         A B R A C A D A          A B R A C A D           A B R A C A            A B R A C             A B R A              A B R               A B                A    Others had the Jesuits' mark in a cross:--        I H       S[73]    Others had nothing but this mark; thus,--        +    I might spend a great deal of my time in exclamations against the  follies, and indeed the wickednesses of those things, in a time of such  danger, in a matter of such consequence as this of a national infection;  but my memorandums of these things relate rather to take notice of the  fact, and mention only that it was so. How the poor people found the  insufficiency of those things, and how many of them were afterwards  carried away in the dead carts, and thrown into the common graves of  every parish with these hellish charms and trumpery hanging about their  necks, remains to be spoken of as we go along.    All this was the effect of the hurry the people were in, after the first  notion of the plague being at hand was among them, and which may be said  to be from about Michaelmas,[74] 1664, but more particularly after the  two men died in St. Giles's, in the beginning of December; and again  after another alarm in February, for when the plague evidently spread  itself, they soon began to see the folly of trusting to these  unperforming creatures who had gulled them of their money; and then  their fears worked another way, namely, to amazement and stupidity, not  knowing what course to take or what to do, either to help or to relieve  themselves; but they ran about from one neighbor's house to another, and  even in the streets, from one door to another, with repeated cries of,  \"Lord, have mercy upon us! What shall we do?\"    I am supposing, now, the plague to have begun, as I have said, and that  the magistrates began to take the condition of the people into their  serious consideration. What they did as to the regulation of the  inhabitants, and of infected families, I shall speak to[75] by itself;  but as to the affair of health, it is proper to mention here my having  seen the foolish humor of the people in running after quacks,  mountebanks, wizards, and fortune"]]]
