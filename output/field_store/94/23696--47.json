Andy felt in his inside coat pocket, drew out a thin, folded map of that  particular part of the county with all the government land marked upon  it, and handed it to Chip without a word. He singled out a couple of  pamphlets from a bunch of old letters such as men are in the habit of  carrying upon their persons, and gave them to Chip also.    \"That's a copy of the homestead and desert laws,\" he said. \"I guess you  heard me telling Weary what kinda deal we're up against, here. Better  not say anything to the Old Man till you have to; no use worrying  him--he can't do nothing.\" It was amazing, the change that had come over  Andy's face and manner since Chip first spoke. Now he grinned a little.    \"If you want to go in on this deal,\" he said quizzically, \"maybe it'll  be just as well if you talk to the bunch yourself about it, Chip. You  ain't any tin, angel, but I'm willing to admit the boys'll believe you;  a whole lot quicker than they would me.\"    \"Yes--and they'll probably hand me a bunch of pity for getting stung by  you,\" Chip retorted. \"I'll take a chance, anyway--but the Lord help you,  Andy if you can't produce proof when the time comes.\"        CHAPTER 5. THE HAPPY FAMILY TURN NESTERS    \"Say, Andy, where's them dry-farmers?\" Big Medicine inquired at the top  of his voice when the Happy Family had reached the biscuit-and-syrup  stage of supper that evening.    \"Oh, they're trying to make up their minds whether to bring the old  fannin'-mill along or sell it and buy new when they get here,\" Andy  informed him imperturbably. \"The women-folks are busy going through  their rag bags, cutting the buttons off all the pants that ain't worth  patching no more, and getting father's socks all darned up.\"    The Happy Family snickered appreciatively; this was more like the Andy  Green with whom they were accustomed to deal.    \"What's daughter doin', about now?\" asked Cal Emmett, fixing his round,  baby-blue stare upon Andy.    \"Daughter? Why, daughter's leaning over the gate telling him she  wouldn't never LOOK at one of them wild cowboys--the idea! She's  heard all about 'em, and they're too rough and rude for HER. And she's  promising to write every day, and giving him a lock of hair to keep in  the back of his dollar watch. Pass the cane Juice, somebody.\"    \"Yeah--all right for daughter. If she's a good looker we'll see if she  don't change her verdict about cowboys.\"    \"Who will? You don't call yourself one, do yuh?\" Pink flung at him  quickly.    \"Well, that depends; I know I ain't any LADY broncho--hey, cut it out!\"  This last because of half a biscuit aimed accurately at the middle of  his face. If you want to know why, search out the history of a  certain War Bonnet Roundup, wherein Pink rashly impersonated a lady  broncho-fighter.    \"Wher'e they going to live when they git here?\" asked Happy Jack,  reverting to the subject of dry farmers.    \"Close enough so you can holler from here to their back door, my boy--if  they have their say about it,\" Andy assured him cheerfully. Andy felt  that he could afford to be facetious now that he had Chip and Weary on  his side.    \"Aw, gwan! I betche there ain't a word of truth in all that scarey  talk,\" Happy Jack fleered heavily.    \"Name your bet. I'll take it.\" Andy filled his mouth with hot biscuit  and stirred up the sugar in his coffee like a man who is occupied  chiefly with the joys of the table.    \"Aw, you ain't going to git me that way agin,\" Happy Jack declared.  \"They's some ketch to it.\"    \"There sure is, Happy. The biggest ketch you ever seen in your life.  It's ketch the Flying U outfit and squeeze the life out of it;  that's the ketch.\" Andy's tone had in it no banter, but considerable  earnestness. For, though Chip would no doubt convince the boys that the  danger was very real, there was a small matter of personal pride to urge  Andy into trying to convince, them himself, without aid from Chip or any  one else.    \"Well, by golly, I'd like to see anybody try that there scheme,\" blurted  Slim. \"That's all--I'd just like to see 'em TRY it once!\"    \"Oh, you'll see it, all right--and you won't have to wait long, either.  Just set around on your haunches a couple of weeks or so. That's all  you'll have to do, Slim; you'll see it tried, fast enough.\"    Pink eyed him with a wide, purple glance. \"You'd like to make us fall  for that, wouldn't you?\" he challenged warily.    Andy gave him a level look. \"No, I wouldn't. I'd like to put one over  on you smart gazabos that think you know it all; but I don't want to  bad enough to see the Flying U go outa business just so I could holler  didn't-I-tell-you. There's a limit to what I'll pay for a josh.\"    \"Well,\" put in the Native Son with his easy drawl, \"I'm coming to the  centre with my ante, just for the sake of seeing the cards turned. Deal  'em out, amigo; state your case once more, so we can take a good, square  look at these dry-farmers.\"    \"Yeah--go ahead and tell us what's bustin' the buttons off your vest,\"  Cal Emmett invited.    \"What's the use?\" Andy argued. \"You'd all just raise up on your hind  legs and holler your heads off. You wouldn't DO anything about it--not  if you knew it was the truth!\" This, of course, was pure guile upon his  part.    \"Oh, wouldn't we? I guess, by golly, we'd do as much for the outfit as  what you would--and a hull lot more if it come to a show-down.\" Slim  swallowed the bait.    \"Maybe you would, if you could take it out in talking,\" snorted Andy.  \"My chips are in. I've got three-hundred-and-twenty acres picked out, up  here, and I'm going to file on 'em before these damned nesters get off  the train. Uh course, that won't be more'n a flea bite--but I can make  it interesting for my next door neighbors, anyway; and every flea bite  helps to keep a dog moving, yuh know.\"    \"I'll go along and use my rights,\" Weary offered suddenly and seriously.  \"That'll make one section they won't get, anyway.\"    Pink gave him a startled look across the table. \"You ain't going to grab  it, are yuh?\" he demanded disappointedly.    \"I sure am--if it's three-hundred-and-twenty acres of land you mean. If  I don't, somebody else will.\" He sighed humorously. \"Next summer you'll  see me hoeing spuds, most likely--if the law says I GOT to.\"    \"Haw-haw-haw-w!\" laughed Big Medicine suddenly. \"It'd sure be worth the  price, jest to ride up and watch you two marks down on all fours weedin'  onions.\" He laughed again with his big, bull-like bellow.    \"We don't have to do anything like that if we don't want to,\" put in  Andy Green calmly. \"I've been reading up on the law. There's one little  joker in it I've got by heart. It says that homestead land can be used  for grazing purposes if it's more valuable for pasture than for crops,  and that actual grazing will be accepted instead of cultivation--if it  is grazing land. So--\"    \"I betche you can't prove that,\" Happy lack interrupted him. \"I never  heard of that before--\"    \"The world's plumb full of things you never heard of, Happy,\" Andy told  him witheringly. \"I gave Chip my copy of the homestead laws, and a plat  of the land up here; soon as he hands 'em back I can show you in cold  print where it says that very identical thing.    \"That's what makes it look good to me, just on general principles,\" he  went on, his honest, gray eyes taking in the circle of attentive faces.  \"If the bunch of us could pool our interests and use what rights we got,  we can corral about four thousand acres--and we can head off outsiders  from grazing in the Badlands, if we take our land right. We've been  overlooking a bet, and don't you forget it. We've been fooling around,  just putting in our time and drawing wages, when we could be owning our  own grazing land by now and shipping our own cattle, if we had enough  sense to last us overnight.    \"A-course, I ain't crazy about turning nester, myself--but we've let  things slide till we've got to come through or get outa the game. It's  a fact, boys, about them dry-farmers coming in on us. That Minneapolis  bunch that the blonde lady works for is sending out a colony of farmers  to take up this land between here and the Bear Paws. The lady tipped her  hand, not knowing where I ranged and thinking I wouldn't be interested  in anything but her. She's a real nice lady, too, and goodlooking--but  a grafter to her last eye winker. And she hit too close home to suit me,  when she named the place where they're going to dump their colony.\"    \"Where does the graft come in?\" inquired Pink cautiously. \"The farmers  get the land, don't they?\"    \"Sure, they get the land. And they pungle up a good-sized fee to  Florence Grace Hallman and her outfit, for locating 'em. Also there's  side money in it, near as I can find out. They skin the farmers somehow  on the fare out here. That's their business, according to the lady. They  prowl around through the government plats till they spot a few thousand  acres of land in a chunk; they take a look at it, maybe, and then they  boom it like hell, and get them eastern marks hooked--them with money,  the lady said. Then they ship a bunch out here, locate 'em on the land  and leave it up to THEM, whether they scratch a living or not. She said  they urge the rubes to bring all the stock they can, because there's  plenty of range left. She says they play that up big. You can see for  yourself how that'll work out, around here!\"    Pink eyed him attentively, and suddenly his dimples stood deep. \"All  right, I'm It,\" he surrendered.    \"It'd be a sin not to fall for a yarn like that, Andy. I expect you made  it all up outa your own head, but that's all right. It's a pleasure to  be fooled by a genius like you. I'll go raising turnips and cabbages  myself.\"    \"By golly, you couldn't raise nothing but hell up on that dry"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17404"],[0,"Kinship Organisations and Group Marriage in Australia (#8)"],[1,"phratry and totem of the members of the individual family change from  generation to generation, the complexion of the local group is liable to  be completely changed; though in practice the changes in one direction  are no doubt counterbalanced by changes in the other, so that the net  result may be nil, when the original differences were small. But we  cannot suppose that the group was often evenly balanced; and a change in  the rule of descent would in that case have important results for the  local group and in any case for the individual family.    The importance of the difference in the constitution of the local group  under descent in the male line is seen when we reflect that in the  normal tribe the totem kin is practically the unit for many purposes.  If, for example, an emu man has killed, let us say, an iguana man, it is  the duty of the iguana men to avenge the death of their kinsman. Their  vengeance need not, however, fall on the original perpetrator of the  deed; according to the rules of savage justice all the emu men are  equally responsible with the culprit; consequently it suffices to kill  the first emu person whom they can find. Conversely, those to whom an  emu man looks for defence, when he is attacked, or assistance, when he  wishes to abduct a wife or anything of that sort, are his fellow emu  men. It is therefore clear that the rule of male descent gives far  greater security to the members of a local group; for they are  surrounded by kinsmen. Under the rule of female descent, on the other  hand, they probably have some kinsmen in the same group but equally a  considerable number of members of other totem kins.    Self-interest therefore, no less than the natural sympathy between  fathers and children, as well as between members of the same group  (quite apart from forays and fighting), must have tended to bring about  a change in the laws of descent.    The late Major J.W. Powell has already described the transition from  matria potestas to patria potestas among the Pueblo peoples. He put it  down to economic conditions, which lead the groups to scatter, each  under the headship of a male, who is also the husband; this naturally  resulted in a weakening of the influence of the mother's brother. It is,  however, less clear that it would bring about the decay of the power of  the mother herself, which in Australian tribes, at any rate, seems to be  independent of the support she obtains from her male relatives.    In Australia, as we have seen, the change from matria to patria potestas  had but little influence in bringing about a change in the rule of  descent. Here, too, the change in the rule of descent may be put down in  the main to economic causes also in a broad sense. Dumping was not in  those days a question of practical politics; the problem was to prevent  the neighbours from pursuing the policy of the free and open port. The  necessity of protecting tribal and group property in land and game would  naturally tend to bind men closer and closer, in proportion as the  pressure from without became greater. It is perhaps hardly accidental  that the main area of male descent is that which has also developed the  Intichiuma ceremonies.    If Prof. Gregory's view[36] that the occupation of Victoria by the  natives dates back no more than 300 years is correct, we may perhaps see  in the migration one cause of the rise of patriliny. Anything which  tended to shake the influence of the mother's kin would increase the  father's power; and the need of protecting newly established groups  from the incursions of their neighbours would be more urgent than in  older districts. As we have seen, the first mentioned cause has  elsewhere had little direct effect; but it may well have played a larger  part under the novel conditions of migration and occupation of fresh  territory.    In South Queensland the fractionation of tribes seems to have gone  further than elsewhere, unless we suppose that we have here an area,  where, as in California, pressure from without has crowded together the  remnants of many tribes. Although it is not obvious how the  multiplication of distinct tribes has favoured patrilineal descent, we  may, at any rate, say that the conditions in the area are exceptional;  possibly it was more fruitful than the greater part of the continent; if  so personal property in the shape of trees, etc., which we have already  seen in existence in this area, would play a more important _role_ here,  and may well have determined the transition to patrilineal descent.    FOOTNOTES:    [10] _Fortn. Rev._ Sept. 1905, cf. van Gennep, _Mythes et Legendes_.    [11]  It cannot be said that the ordinary theory of the development of  kinship in the female line is satisfactory. The consanguine relation of  mother and child does not appear to be a complete answer to the question  why kinship--an entirely different thing--was reckoned through the  mother; the alleged uncertainty of fatherhood is in the first place  closely connected with an unproven stage of promiscuity and consequently  hardly a _vera causa_, until further evidence of such a stage has been  produced; and again among the Arunta, it is rather potestas than  physical fatherhood which, on their theory, determines the kinship of  the child so far as the class is concerned. For the primitive group  therefore we cannot assert any predominant interest of the mother in the  children nor yet admit that it would necessarily be important if it were  shown to exist.

Definitions: tribe, sub-tribe, local group, phratry, class, totem kin.       \"Blood\" and \"shade.\" Kamilaroi type. History of Research in       Australia. General sketch.      Before proceeding to deal with the Australian facts it will be well to  define the terminology to be employed, and give a brief survey of a  typical organisation. Looking at the population from the territorial  point of view in the first place, we find aggregates of tribes; these  may be termed _nations_. The component tribes are friendly, one with  another; they may and often do hold initiation ceremonies and other  ceremonials in common; although the language is usually syntactically  the same, and though they contain many words in common, the vocabularies  differ to such an extent that members of different tribes are not  mutually intelligible. How far the occurrence of identical kinship  organisation and nomenclature should be taken as indicating a still  larger unity than the nation is a difficult question. _Prima facie_ the  nation is a relatively late phenomenon; but the distribution of the  names of kinship organisations, as will be shown later, indicates that  communication, if not alliance, existed over a wide area at some  periods, which it is difficult to suppose were anything but remote.    The idea of the _tribe_ has already been defined. It is a community  which occupies a definite area, recognises its solidarity and possesses  a common speech or dialects of the same.    Between the tribe and the family occur various subdivisions, known as  sub-tribes, hordes, local groups, etc., but without any very clear  definition of their nature. It appears, however, that the tribal area is  sometimes so parcelled out that property in it is vested, not in the  tribe as a whole, but in the _local group_, which welcomes  fellow-tribesmen in times of plenty, but has the right of punishing  intruders of the same tribe who seek for food without permission; for a  non-tribesman the penalty is death. In some cases the local group is  little more than an undivided family including three generations; it may  then occupy and own an area of some ten miles radius. In other cases the  term is applied to a larger aggregate, the nature and rights of which  are not strictly defined; it may number some hundreds of persons and  form one-third of the whole tribe; it seems best to denominate such an  aggregate by the name of _sub-tribe_.    The term _family_ may be retained in its ordinary sense.    Superposed on the tribal organisation are the kinship organisations,  which, in the case of most Australian tribes, are independent of  locality. Leaving out of account certain anomalous tribes, it may be  said broadly that an Australian tribe is divided into two sets, called  phratries, primary classes, moieties, etc. by various authors; the term  used in the present work for these divisions is _phratry_. Membership of  a phratry depends on birth and is taken _directly_ from the mother  (_matrilineal descent_) or father (_patrilineal descent_).    In Queensland and part of N.S. Wales the phratry is again subdivided,  and four _intermarrying classes_ (sometimes called sub-phratries) are  formed, two of which make up each phratry. In North Australia and  Queensland a further subdivision of each of these classes is found,  making eight in all. Descent in the classes is _indirect_ matrilineal or  indirect[37] patrilineal, the child belonging to the mother's or  father's phratry as before, but being assigned to the class of that"]]]
