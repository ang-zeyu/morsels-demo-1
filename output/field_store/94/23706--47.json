You will always do well to cover the clothes you have taken off, or they  will be quite damp in the morning.    See that you have plenty of air to breathe. It is not best to have a  draught of air sweeping through the tent, but let a plenty of it come in  at the feet of the sleeper or top of the tent.    A hammock is a good thing to have in a permanent camp, but do not try to  swing it between two tent-poles: it needs a firmer support.    Stretch a clothes-line somewhere on your camp-ground, where neither you  nor your visitors will run into it in the dark.    If your camp is where many visitors will come by carriage, you will find  that it will pay you for your trouble to provide a hitching-post where  the horses can stand safely. Fastening to guy-lines and tent-poles is  dangerous.      SINKS.    In a permanent camp you must be careful to deposit all refuse from the  kitchen and table in a hole in the ground: otherwise your camp will be  infested with flies, and the air will become polluted. These sink-holes  may be small, and dug every day; or large, and partly filled every day  or oftener by throwing earth over the deposits. If you wish for health  and comfort, do not suffer a place to exist in your camp that will toll  flies to it. The sinks should be some distance from your tents, and a  dry spot of land is better than a wet one. Observe the same rule in  regard to all excrementitious and urinary matter. On the march you can  hardly do better than follow the Mosaic law (see Deuteronomy xxiii. 12,  13).    In permanent camp, or if you propose to stay anywhere more than three  days, the crumbs from the table and the kitchen refuse should be  carefully looked after: to this end it is well to avoid eating in the  tents where you live. Swarms of flies will be attracted by a very little  food.    A spade is better, all things considered, than a shovel, either in  permanent camp or on the march.      HOW TO KEEP WARM.    When a cold and wet spell of weather overtakes you, you will inquire,  \"How can we keep warm?\" If you are where wood is very abundant, you can  build a big fire ten or fifteen feet from the tent, and the heat will  strike through the cloth. This is the poorest way, and if you have only  shelter-tents your case is still more forlorn. But keep the fire  a-going: you _can_ make green wood burn through a pelting storm, but you  must have a quantity of it--say six or eight large logs on at one time.  You must look out for storms, and have some wood cut beforehand. If you  have a stove with you, a little ingenuity will enable you to set it up  inside a tent, and run the funnel through the door. But, unless your  funnel is quite long, you will have to improvise one to carry the smoke  away, for the eddies around the tent will make the stove smoke  occasionally beyond all endurance. Since you will need but little fire  to keep you warm, you can use a funnel made of boards, barrel-staves,  old spout, and the like. Old tin cans, boot-legs, birch-bark, and stout  paper can be made to do service as elbows, with the assistance of turf,  grass-ropes, and large leaves. But I forewarn you there is not much fun,  either in rigging your stove and funnel, or in sitting by it and waiting  for the storm to blow it down. Still it is best to be busy.    Another way to keep warm is to dig a trench twelve to eighteen inches  wide, and about two feet deep, running from inside to the outside of the  tent. The inside end of the trench should be larger and deeper; here you  build your fire. You cover the trench with flat rocks, and fill up the  chinks with stones and turf; boards can be used after you have gone a  few feet from the fireplace. Over the outer end, build some kind of a  chimney of stones, boxes, boards, or barrels. The fireplace should not  be near enough to the side of the tent to endanger it; and, the taller  the chimney is, the better it will draw if you have made the trench of  good width and air-tight. If you can find a sheet-iron covering for the  fireplace, you will be fortunate; for the main difficulty in this  heating-arrangement is to give it draught enough without letting out  smoke, and this you cannot easily arrange with rocks. In digging your  trench and fireplace, make them so that the rain shall not flood them.      FIREPLACE.    If flat rocks and mud are plenty, you can perhaps build a fireplace at  the door of your tent (outside, of course), and you will then have  something both substantial and valuable. Fold one flap of the door as  far back as you can, and build one side of the fireplace against the  pole,[11] and the other side against, or nearly over to, the corner of  the tent. Use large rocks for the lower tiers, and try to have all three  walls perpendicular and smooth inside. When up about three feet, or as  high as the flap of the tent will allow without its being scorched, put  on a large log of green wood for a mantle, or use an iron bar if you  have one, and go on building the chimney. Do not narrow it much: the  chimney should be as high as the top of the tent, or eddies of wind will  blow down occasionally, and smoke you out. Barrels or boxes will do for  the top, or you can make a cob-work of split sticks well daubed with  mud. All the work of the fireplace and chimney must be made air-tight by  filling the chinks with stones or chips and mud. When done, fold and  confine the flap of the tent against the stonework and the mantle;  better tie than nail, as iron rusts the cloth. Do not cut the tent  either for this or any other purpose: you will regret it if you do. Keep  water handy if there is much woodwork; and do not leave your tent for a  long time, nor go to sleep with a big fire blazing.    If you have to bring much water into camp, remember that two pails carry  about as easily as a single one, provided you have a hoop between to  keep them away from your legs. To prevent the water from splashing, put  something inside the pail, that will float, nearly as large as the top  of the pail.      HUNTERS' CAMP.    [Illustration]    It is not worth while to say much about those hunters' camps which are  built in the woods of stout poles, and covered with brush or the bark of  trees: they are exceedingly simple in theory, and difficult in practice  unless you are accustomed to using the axe. If you go into the woods  without an axeman, you had better rely upon your tents, and not try to  build a camp; for when done, unless there is much labor put in it, it is  not so good as a shelter-tent. You can, however, cut a few poles for  rafters, and throw the shelter-tent instead of the bark or brush over  the poles. You have a much larger shelter by this arrangement of the  tent than when it is pitched in the regular way, and there is the  additional advantage of having a large front exposed to the fire which  you will probably build; at the same time also the under side of the  roof catches and reflects the heat downward. When you put up your tent  in this way, however, you must look out not to scorch it, and to take  especial care to prevent sparks from burning small holes in it. In fact,  whenever you have a roaring fire you must guard against mischief from  it.    [Illustration]    Do not leave your clothes or blanket hanging near a brisk fire to dry,  without confining them so that sudden gusts of wind shall not take them  into the flame.    [Illustration]    You may some time have occasion to make a shelter on a ledge or floor  where you cannot drive a pin or nail. If you can get rails, poles,  joists, or boards, you can make a frame in some one of the ways figured  here, and throw your tents over it.    These frames will be found useful for other purposes, and it is well to  remember how to make them.    FOOTNOTES:    [9] Barrel-staves will not do for a double bed.    [10] It will roll up easier if the quilting runs from side to side only.    [11] This applies, as will be seen, only to tents having two uprights,  as the wall, \"A,\" and shelter.          CHAPTER IX.    TENTS.--ARMY SHELTER-TENT (_tente d'abri_).      The shelter-tent used by the Union soldiers during the Rebellion was  made of light duck[12] about 31-1/2 inches wide. A tent was made in two  pieces both precisely alike, and each of them five feet long and five  feet and two inches wide; i.e., two widths of duck. One of these pieces  or half-tents was given to every soldier. That edge of the piece which  was the bottom of the tent was faced at the corners with a piece of  stouter duck three or four inches square. The seam in the middle of the  piece was also faced at the bottom, and eyelets were worked at these  three places, through which stout cords or ropes could be run to tie  this side of the tent down to the tent-pin, or to fasten it to whatever  else was handy. Along the other three edges of each piece of tent, at  intervals of about eight inches, were button-holes and buttons; the  holes an inch, and the buttons four inches, from the selvage or hem.[13]    Two men could button their pieces at the tops, and thus make a tent  entirely open at both ends, five feet and two inches long, by six to  seven feet wide according to the angle of the roof. A third man could  button his piece across one of the open ends so as to close it, although  it did not make a very neat fit, and half of the cloth was not used;  four men could unite their two tents by buttoning the ends together,  thus doubling the length of the tent; and a fifth man could put in an  end-piece.    Light poles made in two pieces, and fastened together with ferrules so  as to resemble a piece of fishing-rod, were given to some of the troops  when the tents were first introduced into the army; but, nice as they  were at the end of the march, few soldiers would carry them, nor will  you many days.    The tents were also pitched by throwing them over a tightened rope; but  it was easier to _cut_ a stiff pole"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17579"],[0,"The History of Napoleon Buonaparte (#8)"],[1,"meanwhile had paused for a moment to consolidate his columns  on the heights, from which the vast plain of Lombardy, rich and  cultivated like a garden, and watered with innumerable fertilising  streams, lay at length within the full view of his victorious soldiery.  \"Hannibal forced the Alps,\" said he gaily, as he now looked back on  those stupendous barriers, \"and we have turned them.\"    \"Hitherto\" (he thus addressed his troops) \"you have been fighting for  barren rocks, memorable for your valour, but useless to your country;  but now your exploits equal those of the armies of Holland and the  Rhine. You were utterly destitute, and you have supplied all your wants.  You have gained battles without cannon, passed rivers without bridges,  performed forced marches without shoes, bivouacked without strong  liquors, and often without bread. None but republican phalanxes,  soldiers of liberty, could have endured such things. Thanks for your  perseverance! But, soldiers, you have done nothing--for there remains  much to do. Milan is not yet ours. The ashes of the conquerors of  Tarquin are still trampled by the assassins of Basseville.\"    The consummate genius of this brief campaign could not be disputed; and  the modest language of the young general's despatches to the Directory,  lent additional grace to his fame. At this time the name of Buonaparte  was spotless: and the eyes of all Europe were fixed in admiration on his  career.    [Footnote 8: Berthier used to keep, as a curiosity, a general order, by  which three louis-d'or were granted as a great supply to each general of  division, dated on the very day of the victory at Albegna.]          CHAPTER V         The French cross the Po at Placenza--The Battle of Fombio--The       Bridge of Lodi--Napoleon occupies Milan--Resigns, and resumes his       command--Insurrection of Pavia--Military Executions--The French       pass the Mincio at Borghetto--Beaulieu retreats behind the       Adige--Mantua besieged--Peace with the King of the Two       Sicilies--The Pope buys a Respite.      Piedmont being now in the hands of Buonaparte, the Austrian general  concentrated his army behind the Po, with the purpose of preventing the  invader from passing that great river and making his way to the capital  of Lombardy.    Napoleon employed every device to make Beaulieu believe that he designed  to attempt the passage of the Po at Valenza; and the Austrian, a man of  routine, who had himself crossed the river at that point, was easily  persuaded that these demonstrations were sincere. Meanwhile his crafty  antagonist executed a march of incredible celerity upon Placenza, fifty  miles lower down the river; and appeared there on the 7th of May, to the  utter consternation of a couple of Austrian squadrons, who happened to  be reconnoitring in that quarter. He had to convey his men across that  great stream in the common ferry boats, and could never have succeeded  had there been anything like an army to oppose him. Andreossi  (afterwards so celebrated) was commander of the advanced guard; Lannes  (who became in the sequel Marshal Duke of Montebello) was the first to  throw himself ashore at the head of some grenadiers. The German hussars  were driven rapidly from their position. Buonaparte himself has said  that no operation in war is more critical than the passage of a great  river; on this occasion the skill of his arrangements enabled him to  pass one of the greatest in the world without the loss of a single man.    Beaulieu, as soon as he ascertained how he had been outwitted, advanced  upon Placenza, in the hope of making the invader accept battle with the  Po in his rear, and therefore under circumstances which must render any  check in the highest degree disastrous. Buonaparte, in the meantime, had  no intention to await the Austrian on ground so dangerous, and was  marching rapidly towards Fomboi, where he knew he should have room to  manoeuvre. The advanced divisions of the hostile armies met at that  village on the 8th of May. The Imperialists occupied the steeples and  houses, and hoped to hold out until Beaulieu could bring up his main  body. But the French charged so impetuously with the bayonet, that the  Austrian, after seeing one-third of his men fall, was obliged to  retreat, in great confusion, leaving all his cannon behind him, across  the Adda; a large river which, descending from the Tyrolese mountains,  joins the Po at Pizzighitone--and thus forms the immediate defence of  the better part of the Milanese against any enemy advancing from  Piedmont. Behind this river Beaulieu now concentrated his army,  establishing strong guards at every ford and bridge, and especially at  Lodi, where as he guessed (for once rightly) the French general designed  to force his passage.    The wooden bridge of Lodi formed the scene of one of the most celebrated  actions of the war; and will ever be peculiarly mixed up with the name  of Buonaparte himself. It was a great neglect in Beaulieu to leave it  standing when he removed his headquarters to the east bank of the Adda:  his outposts were driven rapidly through the old struggling town of Lodi  on the 10th; and the French sheltering themselves behind the walls and  houses, lay ready to attempt the passage of the bridge. Beaulieu had  placed a battery of thirty cannon so as to sweep it completely; and the  enterprise of storming it in the face of this artillery, and the whole  army drawn up behind, is one of the most daring on record.    Buonaparte's first care was to place as many guns as he could get in  order in direct opposition to this Austrian battery. A furious cannonade  on his side of the river also now commenced. The General himself  appeared in the midst of the fire, pointing with his own hand two guns  in such a manner as to cut off the Austrians from the only path by which  they could have advanced to undermine the bridge; and it was on this  occasion that the soldiery, delighted with his dauntless exposure of his  person, conferred on him his honorary nickname of _The Little Corporal_.  In the meantime he had sent General Beaumont and the cavalry to attempt  the passage of the river by a distant ford (which they had much  difficulty in effecting), and awaited with anxiety the moment when they  should appear on the enemy's flank. When that took place, Beaulieu's  line, of course, showed some confusion, and Napoleon instantly gave the  word. A column of grenadiers, whom he had kept ready drawn up close to  the bridge, but under shelter of the houses, were in a moment wheeled to  the left, and their leading files placed upon the bridge. They rushed  on, shouting _Vive la Republique!_ but the storm of grape-shot for a  moment checked them. Buonaparte, Lannes, Berthier, and Lallemagne,  hurried to the front, and rallied and cheered the men. The column dashed  across the bridge in despite of the tempest of fire that thinned them.  The brave Lannes was the first who reached the other side, Napoleon  himself the second. The Austrian artillerymen were bayoneted at their  guns, before the other troops, whom Beaulieu had removed too far back,  in his anxiety to avoid the French battery, could come to their  assistance. Beaumont pressing gallantly with his horse upon the flank,  and Napoleon's infantry forming rapidly as they passed the bridge, and  charging on the instant, the Austrian line became involved in  inextricable confusion, broke up, and fled. The slaughter on their side  was great; on the French there fell only 200 men. With such rapidity,  and consequently with so little loss, did Buonaparte execute this  dazzling adventure--\"the terrible passage,\" as he himself called it, \"of  the bridge of Lodi.\"    It was indeed, terrible to the enemy. It deprived them of another  excellent line of defence, and blew up the enthusiasm of the French  soldiery to a pitch of irresistible daring. Beaulieu, nevertheless,  contrived to withdraw his troops in much better style than Buonaparte  had anticipated. He gathered the scattered fragments of his force  together, and soon threw the line of the Mincio, another tributary of  the Po, between himself and his enemy. The great object, however, had  been attained: the Austrian general escaped, and might yet defend  Mantua, but no obstacle remained between the victorious invader and the  rich and noble capital of Lombardy. The garrison of Pizzighitone, seeing  themselves effectually cut off from the Austrian army, capitulated. The  French cavalry pursued Beaulieu as far as Cremona, which town they  seized; and Napoleon himself prepared to march at once upon Milan.    It was after one of these affairs that an old Hungarian officer was  brought prisoner to Buonaparte, who entered into conversation with him,  and among other matters questioned him \"what he thought of the state of  the war?\" \"Nothing,\" replied the old gentleman, who did not know he was  addressing the general-in-chief,--\"nothing can be worse. Here is a young  man who knows absolutely nothing of the rules of war; to-day he is in  our rear, to-morrow on our flank, next day again in our front. Such  violations of the principles of the art of war are intolerable!\"    The Archduke, who governed in Lombardy for the Emperor, had made many a  long prayer and procession; but the saints appeared to take no  compassion on him, and he now withdrew from the capital. A revolutionary  party had always existed there, as indeed in every part of the Austrian  dominions beyond the Alps; and the tricolor cockade, the emblem of  France, was now mounted by multitudes of the inhabitants. The  municipality hastened to invite the conqueror to appear among them as  their friend and protector; and on the 14th of May, four days after  Lodi, Napoleon accordingly entered, in all the splendour of a military  triumph, the venerable and opulent city of the old Lombard kings.    He was not, however, to be flattered into the conduct, as to serious"]]]
