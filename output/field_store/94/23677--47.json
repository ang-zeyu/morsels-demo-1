Russia's aims and hopes in the Balkans were strongly opposed by  Austria-Hungary. That state has long felt the need of seaports to the  southeast and has hoped, with German support, to secure an outlet on the  AEgean and to control the whole course of the Danube. This purpose could  be accomplished only by annexing a large part of the Balkan peninsula.  The Balkan situation, therefore, brought Russia and Austria face to face  in opposition to each other. It was one of the most serious instances of  international rivalry in the period before the war.    Italy also was interested in the Balkan question. She saw that if the  Austrians should annex the Balkan lands lying to the south they would  control the whole eastern shore of the Adriatic. Italian interests and  ambitions would suffer. This fear, added to the constant bitterness  caused by the problem of Italia Irredenta, inflamed the hostility of  Italy toward Austria.    Finally, Turkey also had an interest in the Balkan situation. She hoped  to benefit by the various jealousies of the great powers. She believed  that fear of a general war would keep all of them from making any move  in the Balkans and so would prolong her own shaky existence as a  European state.    RIVAL COLONIAL EMPIRES.--Some time after the establishment of the  German Empire, her rapidly growing wealth, population, and trade led her  to regret the opportunities for colonial expansion that she had missed.  She cast jealous eyes upon the vast colonial possessions of other  nations. She also took what was left over,--several large regions of  Africa, a port in China, a few islands in the Pacific,--not nearly  enough to satisfy her ambitions. South America was closed to her by the  policy of the United States which is expressed in the Monroe Doctrine.  In Asia, however, she secured extensive commercial and industrial  concessions--the forerunners of political control--in the Turkish  Empire. Germany's desire for colonies was natural enough, but her  jealousy of her more fortunate European neighbors must be considered as  one of the reasons underlying her military and naval preparedness for  war.    Germany's covetous attitude toward the colonial possessions of other  nations led to several serious international disagreements in the years  before the Great War. More than once it almost brought her into conflict  with the government of the United States. An agreement had been made for  the joint control of the Samoan Islands by Great Britain, Germany, and  the United States. Germany's attempt to enlarge her interests in the  islands led to a quarrel with American officers. An American flag was  seized by armed Germans, war vessels were sent to Samoa, and a naval  battle seemed about to take place. A hurricane destroyed the vessels,  however, before any fighting had occurred, and the three countries drew  up a treaty which settled that particular difficulty (1899).    Germany also resented our acquisition of the Philippines and other  Spanish colonies. At the outbreak of our war with Spain in 1898, when  Admiral Dewey steamed into Manila Bay, he found there a German fleet  that was half disposed to interfere with his operations. But when Dewey  showed a willingness to fight, the Germans withdrew.    Several years later Germany picked a quarrel with Venezuela and, in  defiance of the Monroe Doctrine, bombarded a fort on her coast. Acting  in conjunction with England and Italy, German warships blockaded the  ports of Venezuela to force the payment of financial claims. President  Roosevelt's insistence that Germany drop her further plans of  aggression, and his promptness in concentrating the American fleet in  the West Indies, resulted in Germany's accepting a peaceful solution of  the dispute.    In 1911 Germany tried to force France out of Morocco. Since 1904 France  had by common consent taken general charge of affairs in that country.  Later Germany made objections to this arrangement. Finally, in 1911,  when France was sending troops into the interior to put down disorders  among the natives, Germany sent a gunboat to Agadir (ah-gah-deer'), on  the west coast of Morocco. It looked as if she intended to take  possession of the port there. France protested and the affair began to  look very warlike. England came to the support of France, and Germany  gave up all claim to Morocco, taking in exchange about 100,000 square  miles in equatorial Africa. After this humiliation the German  militarists became more determined than ever to force the war which they  thought would make Germany supreme over her rivals.    THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE.--The various jealousies among the nations of  Europe which we have just considered, and particularly the general fear  of the growing power of the German Empire, largely explain the strong  international alliances which came into existence between 1870 and 1914.    Germany, after 1870, knew that France would for many years be too weak  to retake Alsace-Lorraine. All that German leaders had to fear was that  France might succeed in securing powerful friends among the other  nations and that a strong combination of countries might some day  challenge Germany's supremacy on the Continent. To prevent or at any  rate to counterbalance any such combination, Germany looked about for  allies upon whose help she might rely in case of necessity. At first she  planned a general league of friendship with the great countries lying to  the east and southeast, Russia and Austria-Hungary. This combination,  known as the League of the Three Emperors, was soon broken up by the  growing jealousies of Russia and Austria in the Balkans. Germany, having  to choose which of these two nations she would support, decided in favor  of Austria. There followed a growing coldness in the relations between  Germany and Russia.    Germany having allied herself with Austria, looked about for another  nation to give greater strength to the combination. Her thoughts turned  toward Italy, which, in case of another war against France, could attack  the French southeastern border and so prove a valuable ally. For a  number of years there had been ill feeling between Italy and France, and  Germany counted on this feeling to bring Italy under her influence. The  chief difficulty in the way of Germany's plan was that Italy would have  to abandon her ideas in regard to Italia Irredenta and enter into  friendly relations with Austria, her old enemy. Italy was finally driven  into this unnatural alliance by the action of France, which in 1881  occupied Tunis, a land which Italy herself had been planning to annex as  a colony. Italy, too weak to prevent this action of France, entered the  alliance with Germany and Austria into which she had been invited. So it  was that the Triple Alliance was established (1882), as a league of  defense against any nations which should begin an attack upon any one of  the three.    THE TRIPLE ENTENTE.--_Entente_ (ahn-tahnt') is the French word for  understanding or agreement. In the recent history of Europe it refers to  that friendly grouping of nations which was formed in self-defense  against the Triple Alliance. The war of 1870 had left France not only  humiliated but weakened and isolated. The formation of the Triple  Alliance put out of question the idea of a successful war against  Germany to right the wrong which France had suffered. In fact it seemed  to make more probable a new attack upon France. Russia also found  herself in a position of isolation. Their isolation and consequent  danger gradually drew these two nations together, distant as they were  from one another and different as they were in government and ideas. So  there was established a dual alliance between the French Republic and  the Russian Empire.    Great Britain had for a long time remained outside the jealousies and  combinations of the continental powers. In fact she had frequently found  herself at odds with France over the rights of the two nations in  Africa, and with Russia over the question of Constantinople and Russian  aggression in Asia. When English statesmen discovered, however, that the  German Empire was constantly enlarging her navy with a view to  challenging English control of the seas, they felt that it would be well  for Great Britain to seek friendships on the Continent. Old quarrels  with France and Russia were forgotten. Friendly relations were  established, and Great Britain, France, and Russia entered into a league  of friendship known as the Triple Entente (1907).        SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY.--1.

CHAPTER VI      THE BALKAN STATES    THE BALKANS.--As we have learned in Chapter I, the Balkan states are,  with the exception of Montenegro, the result of a series of revolutions  which took place during the last hundred years. These revolutions were  the result of two causes. First there was a growing restlessness of the  different groups of people in the Balkan peninsula. This was due not  only to centuries of Turkish misrule, but also to the influence of the  republican movement which developed in northern and western Europe as a  result of the French Revolution. The second cause of the Balkan  revolutions was the gradual growth among the oppressed races of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17212"],[0,"Michelangelo (#8)"],[1,"which no reproduction renders.\"[18]    [Footnote 18: Symonds, in _Life of Michelangelo Buonarotti_.]          VIII    THE CREATION OF MAN      Science has long been trying to solve the problem of the origin of the  human race. Great books are published by learned men to explain how  the being called man came to be what he is. But centuries before the  beginnings of science a wonderful poem was written on the same subject  of the creation. This poem is called Genesis, that is, the Birth or  Origin of things, and it forms a part of the first book of our Bible.  Ever since it was written it has been one of the sacred books of many  people.    This story of creation was once the favorite subject of artists. In  the period before the invention of printing, people depended for their  instruction upon pictures about as much as we now do upon books.  Painters sometimes covered the walls and ceiling of churches with  illustrations of the book of Genesis, transforming them into huge  picture-books, from which the worshippers could learn the Bible  stories which they were unable to read in books.    Michelangelo was one of the last Italian painters to do this, and he  profited by all the work that had been done before to make the  grandest series of Genesis illustrations ever produced. It is from  this series that our illustration is taken, representing the subject  of the Creation of Man. The painter did not try to follow the text  very literally. In the book of Genesis we read:[19]--    [Footnote 19: Genesis, chapter i verses 26-27; chapter ii verse 7.]    \"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and  let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of  the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every  creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.    \"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he  him.... And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and  breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living  soul.\"    Michelangelo takes these words, and expresses, in his own way, the  supreme creative moment when \"man became a living soul.\"    The man Adam lies on a jutting promontory of the newly made land.  Though his body is formed, he lacks as yet the inner force to use it;  he is not yet alive. The Creator is borne along on a swirling cloud of  cherubs, moving forward through space like a rushing mighty wind.  Perhaps the painter was thinking of the psalmist's beautiful  description of God's coming:[20] \"He rode upon a cherub, and did fly:  yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.\"    [Footnote 20: Psalm xviii, verse 10.]    [Illustration: THE CREATION OF MAN. _Sistine Chapel, Rome._]    In His fatherly face is expressed the good purpose to create a son \"in  his own image.\" The cherubic host accompanying him are full of joy  and awe. We are reminded of that time of which the poet Milton  wrote,[21] when                                   \"All      The multitude of angels, with a shout      Loud as from numbers without number, sweet      As from blest voices, uttering joy,--Heaven rung      With jubilee, and loud hosannas filled      The eternal regions.\"    [Footnote 21: _Paradise Lost_, book iii. lines 344-349.]    The sign of the Almighty's creative power is the outstretched arm  extended towards Adam with a superb gesture of command. As if in  answer to the divine summons, the lifeless figure begins to stir,  rising slowly to a sitting posture. The face turns towards the source  of life as the flower turns to the sun. The eyes are lifted to the  Creator's with a wistful yearning. It is the look we sometimes see in  the eyes of a woodland creature appealing for mercy. It is such a look  as might belong to that imaginary being of the Greek mythology, the  faun, half beast, half human. Thus Adam, still but half created,  begins to feel the thrill of life in his members, and is aroused to  action. He lifts his hand to meet the Creator's outstretched finger.  The current of life is established, the vital spark is communicated,  and in another moment Adam will rise in his full dignity as a human  soul.    This picture was painted long before there was any knowledge of  electricity, of electric sparks, and electric currents. Yet, if we did  not know otherwise, we might fancy that Michelangelo had some of  these wonderful ideas of modern science in mind, as the symbols of the  great thoughts he was trying to express.    The picture suggests to our latter day scientific imagination that  God's currents of power move as silently, as swiftly, as invisibly and  mysteriously as the currents of electricity. The painter meant to show  that the work of creation was not a mechanical effort of the Almighty,  but that with him a gesture, a word, even a thought, brings something  into being.    The series of which this picture forms a part is painted in fresco on  the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, in the Pope's palace of the  Vatican, Rome. To break up the monotony of the long plain surface he  had to decorate, the painter divided the strip of space in the centre  into nine compartments. These are separated from each other by a  painted architectural framework, so cunningly represented that it  seems to project from the ceiling like a solid structure of beams.    Our illustration shows a portion of the simulated framework which  incloses the picture. On what appears to be a pedestal at each corner  is a seated figure representing a statue. One is a beautiful youth  with a horn of plenty, and the other is a faun-like creature capering  gayly. The purpose of these figures is decorative, like those in the  background of the Holy Family.          IX    JEREMIAH      Michelangelo's decoration of the Sistine Chapel ceiling did not stop  with the series of panels running along the flat space in the centre.  On either side, where the ceiling arches to meet the side walls, he  painted a row of figures, which seem to be seated in sculptured  niches. There are twelve of these figures in all, and seven of them  are Hebrew prophets.    The prophets were holy men of old, who walked with God, and carried  his messages among men. They were men of great courage and conviction,  fearlessly denouncing the sins of their times. Sometimes they were  great reformers, bringing about by their preaching an improved  condition of things. Often their mission was to arouse hope in  discouragement, to strengthen faith in a happier time to come. They  looked forward to a future day, when the Prince of Peace should reign  in the earth.    Jeremiah was a prophet of Judah during the corrupt and troublous times  in the reigns of Josiah, Jehoiakim, and Zedekiah. He has been compared  by a recent writer[22] to \"a Puritan living in the age of the Stuarts,  to a Huguenot living in the age of the Medici, or a Savonarola living  in the age of Pope Alexander VI.\" He was born in Anathoth, a little  village of Judaea, and being the son of a priest was consecrated to the  priesthood from birth.    [Footnote 22: Lyman Abbott in _Hebrew Prophets and American Problems_.]    He was still very young when it was borne in upon him that to be loyal  to God he must stand forth and speak the truth more boldly than other  priests were doing. Shrinking from such a task, he besought God to  spare him. \"Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.\"    And this, writes Jeremiah, is the answer he received:[23] \"Say not, I  am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and  whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak. Be not afraid of their  faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord. Then the  Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the Lord said unto  me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth. See, I have this day set  thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull  down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.\"    [Footnote 23: Jeremiah, chapter i. verses 6-10.]    Thus Jeremiah became a prophet, and from that time on his life was  \"one long, hopeless protest against folly and crime.\" Earnestly he  besought his people to return to God before it was too late: \"O  Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be  saved;\"[24] but prayers and threats were alike of no avail, and  misfortunes began to afflict the land. Then Jeremiah shows himself a  true patriot. Though his people refused to hear him, he still loves  them and pleads their cause. In the horror of famine, he prays to God  in their behalf.    [Footnote 24: Ibid., ch. iv. v. 14.]    [Illustration: JEREMIAH. _Sistine Chapel, Rome._]    There are times even in the midst of disappointment when Jeremiah has  some gleam of hope for the future. He predicts the days when \"a King  shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the  earth.\"[25] Such times he himself was never to enjoy. He lived to see  the Babylonian invasion, Jerusalem besieged and laid waste, and his  people taken captive. The reward of his faithful warnings was to be  cast into prison by the ungrateful King Zedekiah. Finally he was  carried by the remnant of his people into Egypt, where he died in a  sad and lonely old age.    [Footnote 25: Jeremiah, chapter xxiii. verse 5.]    Once in a moment of discouragement early in life, his grief had burst  forth in words which might well express the feelings of his old age:  \"Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that  I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my  people!\"[26]    [Footnote 26: Jeremiah, chapter ix. verse 1.]    All the pathos of these words is conveyed in Michelangelo's wonderful  figure of Jeremiah. The story of his life is written in his face and  attitude. He is an old man, with long gray beard, but he still has the  splendid vigor which comes from plain and simple living. He sits with  bowed head, lost in thought, his"]]]
