[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16996"],[0,"Two Old Faiths (#8)"],[1,"rue, ages and ages  hence the \"age of truth\" returns, but it returns only to pass away again  and torment us with the memory of lost purity and joy. The experience of  the universe is thus an eternal renovation of hope and disappointment.  In the struggle between good and evil there is no final triumph for the  good. We tread a fated, eternal round from which there is no escape; and  alike the hero fights and the martyr dies in vain.    It is remarkable that acute intellectual men, as many of the Hindu  poets were, should never have grappled with the problem of the divine  government of the world.    [Sidenote: The future of the Aryan race.]  Equally notable is the unconcern of the Veda as to the welfare and the  future of even the Aryan race. But how sublime is the promise given to  Abraham that in him and his seed all nations of the earth should be  blessed! Renan has pointed with admiration to the confidence entertained  at all times by the Jew in a brilliant and happy future for mankind. The  ancient Hindu cared not about the future of his neighbors, and doubtless  even the expression \"human race\" would have been unintelligible to him.  Nor is there any pathos in the Veda. There is no deep sense of the  sorrows of life. Max Mueller has affixed the epithet \"transcendent\" to  the Hindu mind. Its bent was much more toward the metaphysical, the  mystical, the incomprehensible than toward the moral and the practical.  Hence endless subtleties, more meaningless and unprofitable than ever  occupied the mind of Talmudist or schoolman of the Middle Ages.    [Sidenote: The words of St. Paul illustrated by Hinduism.]  But finally, on this part of the subject, the development of Indian  religion supplies a striking comment on the words of St. Paul:         \"The invisible things of God are clearly seen, being understood       from the things that are made. But when they knew God they       glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in       their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.\"    [Sidenote: Moral power.]  Hinduism is deplorably deficient in power to raise and purify the human  soul, from having no high example of moral excellence. Its renowned  sages were noted for irritability and selfishness--great men at cursing;  and the gods for the most part were worse. Need we say how gloriously  rich the Gospel is in having in the character of Christ the realized  ideal of every possible excellence?    [Sidenote: Ethical effect of Hinduism.  The people better than their religion.]  _Summa religionis est imitari quem colis_: \"It is the sum of religion to  imitate the being worshiped;\"[33] or, as the Hindus express it: \"As is  the deity such is the devotee.\" Worship the God revealed in the Bible,  and you become god-like. The soul strives, with divine aid, to \"purify  itself even as God is pure.\" But apply the principle to Hinduism. Alas!  the Pantheon is almost a pandemonium. Krishna, who in these days is the  chief deity to at least a hundred millions of people, does not possess  one elevated attribute. If, in the circumstances, society does not  become a moral pesthouse it is only because the people continue better  than their religion. The human heart, though fallen, is not fiendish. It  has still its purer instincts; and, when the legends about abominable  gods and goddesses are falling like mildew, these are still to some  extent kept alive by the sweet influences of earth and sky and by the  charities of family life. When the heart of woman is about to be swept  into the abyss her infant's smile restores her to her better self. Thus  family life does not go to ruin; and so long as that anchor holds  society will not drift on the rocks that stand so perilously near.  Still, the state of things is deplorably distressing.    [Sidenote: The doctrine of incarnation.]  The doctrine of the incarnation is of fundamental importance in  Christianity. It seems almost profanation to compare it with the Hindu  teaching regarding the Avataras, or descents of Vishnu. It is difficult  to extract any meaning out of the three first manifestations, when the  god became in succession a fish, a boar, and a tortoise. Of the great  \"descents\" in Rama and Krishna we have already spoken. The ninth Avatara  was that of Buddha, in which the deity descended for the purpose of  deceiving men, making them deny the gods, and leading them to  destruction. So blasphemous an idea may seem hardly possible, even for  the bewildered mind of India; but this is doubtless the Brahmanical  explanation of the rise and progress of Buddhism. It was fatal error,  but inculcated by a divine being. Even the sickening tales of Krishna  and his amours are less shocking than this. When we turn from such  representations of divinity to \"the Word made flesh\" we seem to have  escaped from the pestilential air of a charnel-house to the sweet, pure  breath of heaven.          V.    HINDUISM IN CONTACT WITH CHRISTIANITY.      [Sidenote: Attempted reforms.]  We have used the word _reformer_ in this Tract. We formerly noted that,  in India, there have arisen from time to time men who saw and sorrowed  over the erroneous doctrines and degrading rites of the popular system.    In quite recent times they have had successors. Some account of their  work may form a fitting conclusion to our discussion.    [Sidenote: Advance of Christianity in India.]  With the large influx into India of Christian ideas it was to be  expected that some impression would be made on Hinduism. We do not refer  to conversion--the full acceptance of the Christian faith. Christianity  has advanced and is advancing in India more rapidly than is generally  supposed; but far beyond the circle of those who \"come out and are  separate\" its mighty power is telling on Hinduism. The great fundamental  truths of the Gospel, when once uttered and understood, can hardly be  forgotten. Disliked and denied they may be; but forgotten? No. Thus  they gradually win their way, and multitudes who have no thought of  becoming Christians are ready to admit that they are beautiful and true;  for belief and practice are often widely separated in Hindu minds.    [Sidenote: The Brahma Samaj.]  But it was to be expected that the new ideas pouring into India--and  among these we include not only distinctively Christian ideas, but  Western thought generally--would manifest their presence and activity in  concrete forms, in attempted reconstructions of religion. The most  remarkable example of such a reconstruction is exhibited in the Brahmo  Somaj (more correctly Brahma Samaj)--which may be rendered the \"Church  of God.\"    [Sidenote: Rammohun Roy.  Effect of Christianity upon him.]  It is traceable to the efforts of a truly distinguished man, Rammohun  Roy. He was a person of studious habits, intelligent, acute, and deeply  in earnest on the subject of religion. He studied not only Hinduism in  its various forms, but Buddhism, Mohammedanism, and Christianity. He was  naturally an eclectic, gathering truth from all quarters where he  thought he could find it. A specially deep impression was made on his  mind by Christianity; and in 1820 he published a book with the  remarkable title, _The Precepts of Jesus the Guide to Peace and  Happiness_. Very frequently he gave expression to the sentiment that the  teachings of Christ were the truest and deepest that he knew. Still, he  did not believe in Christ's divinity.    [Sidenote: Debendernath Tagore.  Keshub Chunder Sen.  Formation of a new Samaj.]  In January, 1830, a place of worship was opened by Rammohun Roy and his  friends. It was intended for the worship of one God, without idolatrous  rites of any kind. This was undoubtedly a very important event, and  great was the interest aroused in connection with it. Rammohun Roy,  however, visited Britain in 1831, and died at Bristol in 1833; and the  cause for which he had so earnestly labored in India languished for a  time. But in the year 1841 Debendernath Tagore, a man of character and  wealth, joined the Brahmo Somaj, and gave a kind of constitution to it.  It was fully organized by 1844. No definite declaration, however, had  been made as to the authority of the Vedas; but, after a lengthened  period of inquiry and discussion, a majority of the Somaj rejected the  doctrine of their infallibility by 1850. \"The rock of intuition\" now  began to be spoken of; man's reason was his sufficient guide. Still,  great respect was cherished for the ancient belief and customs of the  land. But in 1858 a new champion appeared on the scene, in the  well-known Keshub Chunder Sen. Ardent, impetuous, ambitions--full of  ideas derived from Christian sources[34]--he could not brook the slow  movements of the Somaj in the path of reform. Important changes, both  religious and social, were pressed by him; and the more conservative  Debendernath somewhat reluctantly consented to their introduction.  Matters were, however, brought to a crisis by the marriage of two  persons of different castes in 1864. In February, 1865, the progressive  party formally severed their connection with the original Somaj; and in  August, 1869, they opened a new place of worship of their own. Since  this time the original or Adi Somaj has been little heard of, and its  movement--if it has moved at all--has been retrogressive. The new  Somaj--the Brahmo Somaj of India, as it called itself--under the  guidance of Mr. Sen became very active. A missionary institute was set  up, and preachers were sent over a great part of India. Much was  accomplished on behalf of women; and in 1872 a Marriage Act for members  of the Somaj was passed by the Indian legislature, which legalized union  between people of different castes, and fixed on fourteen as the lowest  age for the marriage of females. These were important reforms.    Mr. Sen's influence was naturally and necessarily great; but in opposing  the venerable leader of the original Somaj he had "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16997"],[0,"A Journey through the Kingdom of Oude, Volumes I & II (#8)"],[1,"   The impression regarding the minister, mentioned in my last note, was  from a talk with him while he was, it seems, under the influence of  fever. In later conversations he has been more lucid; but he is a  third-rate man, and quite unequal to the burthen that the favour of  the King has placed upon him. That favour will, however, be but of  short duration, for the King is said to have expressed great distrust  in his capacity to do any of the things he promised, more especially  to collect the immense arrears of revenue now due.    I am preparing tables of the revenue and expenditure, and of the  machinery in all branches, and hope soon to submit a clearer view of  the state of things than Government is in the habit of getting on  such occasions; but I have to wade through vast volumes of  correspondence to ascertain what has been said and done in the  questions that will come under consideration, to conduct current  duties, and to become acquainted with the people in my new field,  European and native.    I want to ask you whether I could, with any prospect of success just  now, propose a plan which I have much at heart in the Thuggee and  Dacoity Department. The Lieutenant-Governor, I feel assured, will  advocate it. Major Graham is about to obtain his regimental majority,  with a certain prospect of soon obtaining the command of his  regiment, which will give him twelve hundred a-month. I am anxious to  retain him; for his services have been, and would continue to be, of  vast importance to the North-West Provinces. I should like to propose  that he be made superintendent of Thuggee and Dacoity in those  provinces upon a salary of, say eleven hundred rupees a-month. I  would at the same time propose that the Shahjehanpoor office, lately  under Major Ludlow, be done up, and the duties confided to the  assistant-magistrate, with a small establishment, he to receive an  extra salary, say, one hundred rupees a-month. The same with regard  to the Azimghur office, now under Captain Ward, who could be sent to  Rajpootana. Elliot is not suited well to the work, according to those  who have seen most of him and of it; and you might be able to put him  to some other for which he is fitted. Should you think it desirable  to retain him in Rajpootana, Captain Ward may for the present remain  where he is; and the saving from the Shahjehanpoor office will more  than cover the increase for Major Graham. Pray let me know as soon as  you can whether such a proposal would be likely to be well received.  Graham's services have been and will be most valuable to all the  local authorities at and under Agra.    I suppose the fate of the Punjaub is sealed, for though the Governor-  General might wish to spare it, the home authorities and the home  people will hardly brook the prospect or the chance of another  struggle of the same kind, particularly if the Afghans have really  joined the Seiks under Chutter Sing. The tendency to annexation,  already strong at home, will become still stronger when the news of  our late losses arrive. They indicate a stronger assurance of  national sympathy on the part of the chiefs and troops opposed to us  than was generally calculated upon. The fall of Mooltan will have  relieved the Governor-General's mind from much of the anxiety caused  by the inartistic management of the Commander-in-Chief.               Yours sincerely,            (Signed)     W. H. SLEEMAN.    To H. M. Elliot, Esq.,      &c. &c.                    ______________________________                                        Lucknow, 7th March, 1849.    My Dear Elliott,    I may mention what has been the state of feeling at Lucknow regarding  the state of affairs in the Punjaub, though it has become of less  interest to the Governor-General now that so decided a victory has  crowned his efforts. During the whole contest the Government five per  cent. notes have been every day sold in my office at par, and I  question whether this can be said of the offices in Calcutta. One day  during the races, on the King's firing a salute for victory, the  European gentlemen talked about it at the stand with many of the  first of the native aristocracy. They said that the Seiks could not  fight as they were fighting unless there had been some general  feeling of distrust as to our ultimate intentions with regard to the  Punjaub which united them together; and that this feeling must be as  strong with the Durbar and those who did not fight as with those who  did. I was not present, as I did not attend the races; but I found  the same opinion prevailing among all with whom I conversed. But all  seemed to be perfectly satisfied as to the utter hopelessness of the  struggle, as evinced by the great barometer of the Government paper.    I suppose Dost Mahomed's force in Peshawur will have proceeded in all  haste to the Khyber on hearing of the defeat of their friends, and  that General Gilbert's fine division will find none of them to  contend with; and that Gholab Sing will be glad of an occasion to  display his zeal by keeping Shore Sing and his father out of the  hills.    The river Indus will, I suppose, hardly be considered so safe a  boundary as the hills; for if any danger is to be apprehended from  the west, it would not be safe to leave the enemy so fine a field to  organize their forces upon after emerging from the difficult passes.  Well organized upon that field, a force could cross the river  anywhere in the cold and hot seasons; and the revenue of that field  would aid in keeping up a force that might in the day of need be used  against us. It was a great error committed by Lord Hastings in  allowing the Nepaulese the fertile portion of the Jurac, which then  yielded only two lacs of rupees, but now yields thirteen, and will,  ere long, yield twenty. Without this their military force would have  been altogether insignificant; but it is not so now.                 Yours sincerely,            (Signed)       W. H. SLEEMAN.    To H. M. Elliot, Esq.,       &c. &c.         _________________________________                                             Lucknow, 20th March, 1849.    My Dear Elliot,    The King continues much the same as when I last wrote. Under skilful  treatment he might soon get well; but the prescriptions of his best  native physicians are little attended to, and he has not yet  consented to consult an European doctor. He could not have a better  doctor than Leekie, and the natives have great confidence in him; but  his Majesty has not expressed any wish to see or consult him. If he  did so, the chances are one hundred to one against his taking his  medicine.    I do not like to write a public letter on the subject, but am anxious  to know the Governor-General's wishes as to whether any new  engagements should be entered into in case of the King's decease, and  with whom.    The instructions contained in your letter of the 16th August, 1847,  referred to in my last, will be carried out; but the Governor-General  may wish to have the new arrangements recorded in a former treaty,  the heads of the royal family consenting thereto, as at Gwalior, when  the regency was appointed. I have no copy of the treaty made at  Lahore, where the regency was appointed.    I should think it desirable to give the members of the regency each  distinct duties, so that he may feel responsible for them, and take a  pride in doing them well. One should be at the head of the Revenue  Department, and another at the head of the Judicial and Police, each  having a deputy; and the Resident, as president, should have a  deputy. These would be sufficient for a regency, and could form a  court, or council, to deliberate and decide about measures of  legislation and administration.    The mother of the King would be the best person to consult upon the  nomination of the members in the first instance; but neither she nor  any other female of the royal family should have any share in the  administration.    All important measures adopted by the Council should be submitted for  the consideration of the Governor-General; and no member of the  Council should be removed without his Lordship's consent. No  important measure adopted by the Council, and sanctioned by the  Governor-General, should at any future time be liable to be abolished  or altered without the sanction of our Government previously obtained  through the Resident.    On the heir-apparent attaining his majority, every member of the  regency who has discharged his duties faithfully should have for life  a pension equal to half the salary enjoyed by him while in office,  and be guaranteed in the enjoyment of this half by the British  Government.    The measures thus adopted during the minority would form a code for  future guidance, and tend at least to give the thing which Oude most  wants--stability to good sales, and to the machinery by which they  are to be enforced.        The King's brother--a very excellent man, who was Commander-in-Chief  during his father's life-time, but is now nothing--might also be  consulted with the mother of the King in the nomination of the  regency, and made a party with her to the new treaty.    These are all the points which appear to me at present to call for  instructions.    The harvests promise to be abundant, but the collections come in  slowly, and the establishments are all greatly in arrear. I don't  like to write publicly on these subjects, because it is almost  impossible here to prevent what is so written from getting to the  Court; but the Governor-General's instructions were sent to me in  that form without the same risk.
