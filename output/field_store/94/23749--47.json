Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of (#8)"],[1,"er's head.\"    \"Broken his head, thou wicked boy!\" shrieked the poor widow; \"what didst  do that for?\"    \"I can't tell,\" said Amyas, penitently; \"I couldn't help it. It looked  so smooth, and bald, and round, and--you know?\"    \"I know? Oh, wicked boy! thou hast given place to the devil; and now,  perhaps, thou hast killed him.\"    \"Killed the devil?\" asked Amyas, hopefully but doubtfully.    \"No, killed the schoolmaster, sirrah! Is he dead?\"    \"I don't think he's dead; his coxcomb sounded too hard for that. But had  not I better go and tell Sir Richard?\"    The poor mother could hardly help laughing, in spite of her terror,  at Amyas's perfect coolness (which was not in the least meant for  insolence), and being at her wits' end, sent him, as usual, to his  godfather.    Amyas rehearsed his story again, with pretty nearly the same  exclamations, to which he gave pretty nearly the same answers; and  then--\"What was he going to do to you, then, sirrah?\"    \"Flog me, because I could not write my exercise, and so drew a picture  of him instead.\"    \"What! art afraid of being flogged?\"    \"Not a bit; besides, I'm too much accustomed to it; but I was busy, and  he was in such a desperate hurry; and, oh, sir, if you had but seen his  bald head, you would have broken it yourself!\"    Now Sir Richard had, twenty years ago, in like place, and very much  in like manner, broken the head of Vindex Brimblecombe's father,  schoolmaster in his day, and therefore had a precedent to direct him;  and he answered--\"Amyas, sirrah! those who cannot obey will never be fit  to rule. If thou canst not keep discipline now, thou wilt never make a  company or a crew keep it when thou art grown. Dost mind that, sirrah?\"    \"Yes,\" said Amyas.    \"Then go back to school this moment, sir, and be flogged.\"    \"Very well,\" said Amyas, considering that he had got off very cheaply;  while Sir Richard, as soon as he was out of the room, lay back in his  chair, and laughed till he cried again.    So Amyas went back, and said that he was come to be flogged; whereon the  old schoolmaster, whose pate had been plastered meanwhile, wept tears of  joy over the returning prodigal, and then gave him such a switching as  he did not forget for eight-and-forty hours.    But that evening Sir Richard sent for old Vindex, who entered,  trembling, cap in hand; and having primed him with a cup of sack,  said--\"Well, Mr. Schoolmaster! My godson has been somewhat too much for  you to-day. There are a couple of nobles to pay the doctor.\"    \"O Sir Richard, gratias tibi et Domino! but the boy hits shrewdly  hard. Nevertheless I have repaid him in inverse kind, and set him an  imposition, to learn me one of Phaedrus his fables, Sir Richard, if you  do not think it too much.\"    \"Which, then? The one about the man who brought up a lion's cub, and was  eaten by him in play at last?\"    \"Ah, Sir Richard! you have always a merry wit. But, indeed, the boy is a  brave boy, and a quick boy, Sir Richard, but more forgetful than Lethe;  and--sapienti loquor--it were well if he were away, for I shall never  see him again without my head aching. Moreover, he put my son Jack upon  the fire last Wednesday, as you would put a football, though he is a  year older, your worship, because, he said, he looked so like a roasting  pig, Sir Richard.\"    \"Alas, poor Jack!\"    \"And what's more, your worship, he is pugnax, bellicosus, gladiator,  a fire-eater and swash-buckler, beyond all Christian measure; a  very sucking Entellus, Sir Richard, and will do to death some of her  majesty's lieges erelong, if he be not wisely curbed. It was but a month  agone that he bemoaned himself, I hear, as Alexander did, because there  were no more worlds to conquer, saying that it was a pity he was so  strong; for, now he had thrashed all the Bideford lads, he had no sport  left; and so, as my Jack tells me, last Tuesday week he fell upon a  young man of Barnstaple, Sir Richard, a hosier's man, sir, and plebeius  (which I consider unfit for one of his blood), and, moreover, a man full  grown, and as big as either of us (Vindex stood five feet four in his  high-heeled shoes), and smote him clean over the quay into the mud,  because he said that there was a prettier maid in Barnstaple (your  worship will forgive my speaking of such toys, to which my fidelity  compels me) than ever Bideford could show; and then offered to do the  same to any man who dare say that Mistress Rose Salterne, his worship  the mayor's daughter, was not the fairest lass in all Devon.\"    \"Eh? Say that over again, my good sir,\" quoth Sir Richard, who had thus  arrived, as we have seen, at the second count of the indictment. \"I say,  good sir, whence dost thou hear all these pretty stories?\"    \"My son Jack, Sir Richard, my son Jack, ingenui vultus puer.\"    \"But not, it seems, ingenui pudoris. Tell thee what, Mr. Schoolmaster,  no wonder if thy son gets put on the fire, if thou employ him as a  tale-bearer. But that is the way of all pedagogues and their sons,  by which they train the lads up eavesdroppers and favor-curriers, and  prepare them--sirrah, do you hear?--for a much more lasting and hotter  fire than that which has scorched thy son Jack's nether-tackle. Do you  mark me, sir?\"    The poor pedagogue, thus cunningly caught in his own trap, stood  trembling before his patron, who, as hereditary head of the Bridge  Trust, which endowed the school and the rest of the Bideford charities,  could, by a turn of his finger, sweep him forth with the besom  of destruction; and he gasped with terror as Sir Richard went  on--\"Therefore, mind you, Sir Schoolmaster, unless you shall promise me  never to hint word of what has passed between us two, and that neither  you nor yours shall henceforth carry tales of my godson, or speak his  name within a day's march of Mistress Salterne's, look to it, if I do  not--\"    What was to be done in default was not spoken; for down went poor old  Vindex on his knees:--    \"Oh, Sir Richard! Excellentissime, immo praecelsissime Domine et  Senator, I promise! O sir, Miles et Eques of the Garter, Bath, and  Golden Fleece, consider your dignities, and my old age--and my great  family--nine children--oh, Sir Richard, and eight of them girls!--Do  eagles war with mice? says the ancient!\"    \"Thy large family, eh? How old is that fat-witted son of thine?\"    \"Sixteen, Sir Richard; but that is not his fault, indeed!\"    \"Nay, I suppose he would be still sucking his thumb if he dared--get up,  man--get up and seat yourself.\"    \"Heaven forbid!\" murmured poor Vindex, with deep humility.    \"Why is not the rogue at Oxford, with a murrain on him, instead of  lurching about here carrying tales and ogling the maidens?\"    \"I had hoped, Sir Richard--and therefore I said it was not his  fault--but there was never a servitorship at Exeter open.\"    \"Go to, man--go to! I will speak to my brethren of the Trust, and to  Oxford he shall go this autumn, or else to Exeter gaol, for a strong  rogue, and a masterless man. Do you hear?\"    \"Hear?--oh, sir, yes! and return thanks. Jack shall go, Sir Richard,  doubt it not--I were mad else; and, Sir Richard, may I go too?\"    And therewith Vindex vanished, and Sir Richard enjoyed a second mighty  laugh, which brought in Lady Grenville, who possibly had overheard the  whole; for the first words she said were--    \"I think, my sweet life, we had better go up to Burrough.\"    So to Burrough they went; and after much talk, and many tears, matters  were so concluded that Amyas Leigh found himself riding joyfully towards  Plymouth, by the side of Sir Richard, and being handed over to Captain  Drake, vanished for three years from the good town of Bideford.    And now he is returned in triumph, and the observed of all observers;  and looks round and round, and sees all faces whom he expects, except  one; and that the one which he had rather see than his mother's? He is  not quite sure. Shame on himself!    And now the prayers being ended, the rector ascends the pulpit, and  begins his sermon on the text:--    \"The heaven and the heaven of heavens are the Lord's; the whole earth  hath he given to the children of men;\" deducing therefrom craftily, to  the exceeding pleasure of his hearers, the iniquity of the Spaniards  in dispossessing the Indians, and in arrogating to themselves the  sovereignty of the tropic seas; the vanity of the Pope of Rome in  pretending to bestow on them the new countries of America; and the  justice, valor, and glory of Mr. Drake and his expedition, as testified  by God's miraculous protection of him and his, both in the Straits of  Magellan, and in his battle with the Galleon; and last, but not least,  upon the rock by Celebes, when the Pelican lay for hours firmly fixed,  and was floated off unhurt, as it were by miracle, by a sudden shift of  wind.    Ay, smile, reader, if you will; and, perhaps, there was matter for a  smile in that honest sermon, interlarded, as it was, with scraps of  Greek and Hebrew, which no one understood, but every one expected as  their right (for a preacher was nothing then who could not prove himself  \"a good Latiner\"); and graced, moreover, by a somewhat pedantic and  lengthy refutation from Scripture of Dan Horace's cockney horror of the  sea--         \"Illi robur et aes triplex,\" etc.    and his infidel and ungodly slander against the impias rates, and their  crews.    Smile, if you will: but those were days (and there were never less  superstitious ones) in which Englishmen believed in the living God, and  were not ashamed to acknowledge, as a matter of course, His help and  providence, and calling, in the matters of daily life, which we now  in our covert atheism term \"secular and carnal;\" and when, the sermon  ended, the communion service had begun, and the bread and the wine were  given to those five mariners, every gallant gentleman who stood near  them (for the press would not allow of more) knelt and received the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18613"],[0,"The Golden Scorpion (#8)"],[1,"'s round-about  methods. Anyway I wanted to make sure that the dead man from Hanover  Hole and your mysterious cabman were not one and the same.\"    Stuart entertained a lively suspicion that Inspector Dunbar was keeping  something up his sleeve, but with this very proper reticence he had no  quarrel, and followed by the constable, who relocked the mortuary  behind them, they came out into the yard where the cab waited which  was to take them to Scotland Yard. Dunbar, standing with one foot upon  the step of the cab, turned to the constable.    \"Has anyone else viewed the body?\" he asked.    \"No sir.\"    \"No one is to be allowed to do so--you understand?--_no one_, unless  he has written permission from the Commissioner.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    Half an hour later they arrived at New Scotland Yard and went up to  Dunbar's room. A thick-set, florid man of genial appearance, having a  dark moustache, a breezy manner and a head of hair resembling a very  hard-worked blacking-brush, awaited them. This was Detective-Sargeant  Sowerby with whom Stuart was already acquainted.    \"Good-morning, Sergeant Sowerby,\" he said.    \"Good-morning, sir. I hear that someone was pulling your leg last  night.\"    \"What do you mean exactly, Sowerby?\" inquired Dunbar, fixing his  fierce eyes upon his subordinate.    Sergeant Sowerby exhibited confusion.    \"I mean nothing offensive, Inspector. I was referring to the  joker who gave so good an imitation of my voice that even  _you_ were deceived.\"    \"Ah,\" replied Dunbar--\"I see. Yes--he did it well. He spoke just like  you. I could hardly make out a word he said.\"    With this Caledonian shaft and a side-glance at Stuart, Inspector  Dunbar sat down at the table.    \"Here's Dr. Stuart's description of the missing cabman,\" he continued,  taking out his note-book. \"Dr. Stuart has viewed the body and it is  not the man. You had better take a proper copy of this.\"    \"Then the cabman wasn't Max?\" cried Sowerby eagerly. \"I thought not.\"    \"I believe you told me so before,\" said Dunbar sourly. \"I also seem to  recall that you thought a scorpion's tail was a Prickly Pear.  However--here, on the page numbered twenty-six, is a description of  the woman known as Mlle. Dorian. It should be a fairly easy matter to  trace the car through the usual channels, and she ought to be easy to  find, too.\"    He glanced at his watch. Stuart was standing by the lofty window  looking out across the Embankment.    \"Ten o'clock,\" said Dunbar. \"The Commissioner will be expecting us.\"    \"I am ready,\" responded Stuart.    Leaving Sergeant Sowerby seated at the table studying the note-book,  Stuart and Dunbar proceeded to the smoke-laden room of the Assistant  Commissioner. The great man, suavely satanic, greeted Stuart with  that polished courtesy for which he was notable.    \"You have been of inestimable assistance to us in the past, Dr.  Stuart,\" he said, \"and I feel happy to know that we are to enjoy the  aid of your special knowledge in the present case. Will you smoke one  of my cigarettes? They are some which a friend is kind enough to  supply to me direct from Cairo, and are really quite good.\"    \"Thanks,\" replied Stuart. \"May I ask in what direction my services  are likely to prove available?\"    The Commissioner lighted a fresh cigarette. Then from a heap of  correspondence he selected a long report typed upon blue foolscap.    \"I have here,\" he said, \"confirmation of the telegraphic report  received last night. The name of M. Gaston Max will no doubt be  familiar to you?\"    Stuart nodded.    \"Well,\" continued the Commissioner, \"it appears that he has been  engaged in England for the past month endeavouring to trace the  connection which he claims to exist between the sudden deaths of  various notable people, recently--a list is appended--and some person  or organisation represented by, or associated with, a scorpion. His  personal theory not being available--poor fellow, you have heard of  his tragic death--I have this morning consulted such particulars as  I could obtain respecting these cases. If they were really cases of  assassination, some obscure poison was the only mode of death that  could possibly have been employed. Do you follow me?\"    \"Perfectly.\"    \"Now, the death of Gaston Max under circumstances not yet explained,  would seem to indicate that his theory was a sound one. In other  words, I am disposed to believe that he himself represents the most  recent outrage of what we will call 'The Scorpion.' Even at the time  that the body of the man found by the River Police had not been  identified, the presence upon his person of a fragment of gold  strongly resembling the tail of a scorpion prompted me to instruct  Inspector Dunbar to consult you. I had determined upon a certain  course. The identification of the dead man with Gaston Max merely  strengthens my determination and enhances the likelihood of my idea  being a sound one.\"    He flicked the ash from his cigarette and resumed:    \"Without mentioning names, the experts consulted in the other cases  which--according to the late Gaston Max--were victims of 'The  Scorpion,' do not seem to have justified their titles. I am arranging  that you shall be present at the autopsy upon the body of Gaston Max.  And now, permit me to ask you a question: are you acquainted with any  poison which would produce the symptoms noted in the case of Sir Frank  Narcombe, for instance?\"    Stuart shook his head slowly.    \"All that I know of the case,\" he said, \"is that he was taken suddenly  ill in the foyer of a West-End theatre, immediately removed to his  house in Half Moon Street, and died shortly afterward. Can you give me  copies of the specialists' reports and other particulars? I may then  be able to form an opinion.\"    \"I will get them for you,\" replied the Commissioner, the exact nature  of whose theory was by no means evident to Stuart. He opened a drawer.  \"I have here,\" he continued, \"the piece of cardboard and the envelope  left with you by the missing cab-man. Do you think there is any  possibility of invisible writing?\"    \"None,\" said Stuart confidently. \"I have tested in three or four  places as you will see by the spots, but my experiments will in no way  interfere with those which no doubt your own people will want to make.  I have also submitted both surfaces to a microscopic examination. I am  prepared to state definitely that there is no writing upon the  cardboard, and except for the number, 30, none upon the envelope.\"    \"It is only reasonable to suppose,\" continued the Commissioner, \"that  the telephone message which led Inspector Dunbar to leave your house  last night was originated by that unseen intelligence against which we  find ourselves pitted. In the first place, no one in London, myself  and, presumably, 'The Scorpion' excepted, knew at that time that M.  Gaston Max was in England or that M. Gaston Max was dead. I say,  presumably 'The Scorpion' because it is fair to assume that the person  whom Max pursued was responsible for his death.    \"Of course\"--the Commissioner reached for the box of cigarettes--\"were  it not for the telephone message, we should be unjustified in assuming  that Mlle. Dorian and this\"--he laid his finger upon the piece of  cardboard--\"had any connection with the case of M. Max. But the  message was so obviously designed to facilitate the purloining of the  sealed envelope and so obviously emanated from one already aware of  the murder of M. Max, that the sender is identified at once with--  'The Scorpion.'\"    The Assistant Commissioner complacently lighted a fresh cigarette.    \"Finally,\" he said, \"the mode of death in the case of M. Max may not  have been the same as in the other cases. Therefore, Dr. Stuart\"--he  paused impressively--\"if you fail to detect anything suspicious at the  post mortem examination I propose to apply to the Home Secretary for  power to exhume the body of the late Sir Frank Narcombe!\"    Deep in reflection, Stuart walked alone along the Embankment. The full  facts contained in the report from Paris the Commissioner had not  divulged, but Stuart concluded that this sudden activity was directly  due, not to the death of M. Max, but to the fact that he (Max) had  left behind him some more or less tangible clue. Stuart fully  recognized that the Commissioner had accorded him an opportunity to  establish his reputation--or to wreck it.    Yet, upon closer consideration, it became apparent that it was to  Fate and not to the Commissioner that he was indebted. Strictly  speaking, his association with the matter dated from the night of  his meeting with the mysterious cabman in West India Dock road. Or had  the curtain first been lifted upon this occult drama that evening,  five years ago, as the setting sun reddened the waters of the Imperial  Canal and a veiled figure passed him on the Wu-Men Bridge?    \"Shut your eyes tightly, master--the Scorpion is coming!\"    He seemed to hear the boy's words now, as he passed along the  Embankment; he seemed to see again the tall figure. And suddenly he  stopped, stood still and stared with unseeing eyes across the muddy  waters of the Thames. He was thinking of the cowled man who had stood  behind the curtains in his study--of that figure so wildly bizarre  that even now he could scarcely believe that he had ever actually seen  it. He walked on.    Automatically his reflections led him to Mlle. Dorian, and he  remembered that even as he paced along there beside the river the  wonderful mechanism of New Scotland Yard was in motion, its many  tentacles seeking--seeking tirelessly--for the girl, whose dark eyes  haunted his sleeping and waking hours. _He_ was responsible, and if  she were arrested _he_ would be called upon to identify her. He  condemned himself bitterly.    After all, what crime had she committed? She had tried to purloin a  letter--which did not belong to Stuart in the first place. And she had  failed. Now--the"]]]
