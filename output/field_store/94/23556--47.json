Several attempts were made to stop him, but he only waved his  hand and trotted on, nor did he pause in his speed till he reached the  door of Mr. Chillingworth, the medical man whom he intended to consult.    Henry knew that at such a time he would be at home, which was the case,  and he was soon closeted with the man of drugs. Henry begged his patient  hearing, which being accorded, he related to him at full length what had  happened, not omitting, to the best of his remembrance, any one  particular. When he had concluded his narration, the doctor shifted his  position several times, and then said,--    \"That's all?\"    \"Yes--and enough too.\"    \"More than enough, I should say, my young friend. You astonish me.\"    \"Can you form any supposition, sir, on the subject?\"    \"Not just now. What is your own idea?\"    \"I cannot be said to have one about it. It is too absurd to tell you  that my brother George is impressed with a belief a vampyre has visited  the house.\"    \"I never in all my life heard a more circumstantial narrative in favour  of so hideous a superstition.\"    \"Well, but you cannot believe--\"    \"Believe what?\"    \"That the dead can come to life again, and by such a process keep up  vitality.\"    \"Do you take me for a fool?\"    \"Certainly not.\"    \"Then why do you ask me such questions?\"    \"But the glaring facts of the case.\"    \"I don't care if they were ten times more glaring, I won't believe it. I  would rather believe you were all mad, the whole family of you--that at  the full of the moon you all were a little cracked.\"    \"And so would I.\"    \"You go home now, and I will call and see your sister in the course of  two hours. Something may turn up yet, to throw some new light upon this  strange subject.\"    With this understanding Henry went home, and he took care to ride as  fast as before, in order to avoid questions, so that he got back to his  old ancestral home without going through the disagreeable ordeal of  having to explain to any one what had disturbed the peace of it.    When Henry reached his home, he found that the evening was rapidly  coming on, and before he could permit himself to think upon any other  subject, he inquired how his terrified sister had passed the hours  during his absence.    He found that but little improvement had taken place in her, and that  she had occasionally slept, but to awaken and speak incoherently, as if  the shock she had received had had some serious affect upon her nerves.  He repaired at once to her room, and, finding that she was awake, he  leaned over her, and spoke tenderly to her.    \"Flora,\" he said, \"dear Flora, you are better now?\"    \"Harry, is that you?\"    \"Yes, dear.\"    \"Oh, tell me what has happened?\"    \"Have you not a recollection, Flora?\"    \"Yes, yes, Henry; but what was it? They none of them will tell me what  it was, Henry.\"    \"Be calm, dear. No doubt some attempt to rob the house.\"    \"Think you so?\"    \"Yes; the bay window was peculiarly adapted for such a purpose; but now  that you are removed here to this room, you will be able to rest in  peace.\"    \"I shall die of terror, Henry. Even now those eyes are glaring on me so  hidiously. Oh, it is fearful--it is very fearful, Henry. Do you not pity  me, and no one will promise to remain with me at night.\"    \"Indeed, Flora, you are mistaken, for I intend to sit by your bedside  armed, and so preserve you from all harm.\"    She clutched his hand eagerly, as she said,--    \"You will, Henry. You will, and not think it too much trouble, dear  Henry.\"    \"It can be no trouble, Flora.\"    \"Then I shall rest in peace, for I know that the dreadful vampyre cannot  come to me when you are by-\"    \"The what, Flora!\"    \"The vampyre, Henry. It was a vampyre.\"    \"Good God, who told you so?\"    \"No one. I have read of them in the book of travels in Norway, which Mr.  Marchdale lent us all.\"    \"Alas, alas!\" groaned Henry. \"Discard, I pray you, such a thought from  your mind.\"    \"Can we discard thoughts. What power have we but from that mind, which  is ourselves?\"    \"True, true.\"    \"Hark, what noise is that? I thought I heard a noise. Henry, when you  go, ring for some one first. Was there not a noise?\"    \"The accidental shutting of some door, dear.\"    \"Was it that?\"    \"It was.\"    \"Then I am relieved. Henry, I sometimes fancy I am in the tomb, and that  some one is feasting on my flesh. They do say, too, that those who in  life have been bled by a vampyre, become themselves vampyres, and have  the same horrible taste for blood as those before them. Is it not  horrible?\"    \"You only vex yourself by such thoughts, Flora. Mr. Chillingworth is  coming to see you.\"    \"Can he minister to a mind diseased?\"    \"But yours is not, Flora. Your mind is healthful, and so, although his  power extends not so far, we will thank Heaven, dear Flora, that you  need it not.\"    She sighed deeply, as she said,--    \"Heaven help me! I know not, Henry. The dreadful being held on by my  hair. I must have it all taken off. I tried to get away, but it dragged  me back--a brutal thing it was. Oh, then at that moment, Henry, I felt  as if something strange took place in my brain, and that I was going  mad! I saw those glazed eyes close to, mine--I felt a hot, pestiferous  breath upon my face--help--help!\"    \"Hush! my Flora, hush! Look at me.\"    \"I am calm again. It fixed its teeth in my throat. Did I faint away?\"    \"You did, dear; but let me pray you to refer all this to imagination; or  at least the greater part of it.\"    \"But you saw it.\"    \"Yes--\"    \"All saw it.\"    \"We all saw some man--a housebreaker--It must have been some  housebreaker. What more easy, you know, dear Flora, than to assume some  such disguise?\"    \"Was anything stolen?\"    \"Not that I know of; but there was an alarm, you know.\"    Flora shook her head, as she said, in a low voice,--    \"That which came here was more than mortal. Oh, Henry, if it had but  killed me, now I had been happy; but I cannot live--I hear it breathing  now.\"    \"Talk of something else, dear Flora,\" said the much distressed Henry;  \"you will make yourself much worse, if you indulge yourself in these  strange fancies.\"    \"Oh, that they were but fancies!\"    \"They are, believe me.\"    \"There is a strange confusion in my brain, and sleep comes over me  suddenly, when I least expect it. Henry, Henry, what I was, I shall  never, never be again.\"    \"Say not so. All this will pass away like a dream, and leave so faint a  trace upon your memory, that the time will come when you will wonder it  ever made so deep an impression on your mind.\"    \"You utter these words, Henry,\" she said, \"but they do not come from  your heart. Ah, no, no, no! Who comes?\"    The door was opened by Mrs. Bannerworth, who said,--    \"It is only me, my dear. Henry, here is Dr. Chillingworth in the  dining-room.\"    Henry turned to Flora, saying,--    \"You will see him, dear Flora? You know Mr. Chillingworth well.\"    \"Yes, Henry, yes, I will see him, or whoever you please.\"    \"Shew Mr. Chillingworth up,\" said Henry to the servant.    In a few moments the medical man was in the room, and he at once  approached the bedside to speak to Flora, upon whose pale countenance he  looked with evident interest, while at the same time it seemed mingled  with a painful feeling--at least so his own face indicated.    \"Well, Miss Bannerworth,\" he said, \"what is all this I hear about an  ugly dream you have had?\"    \"A dream?\" said Flora, as she fixed her beautiful eyes on his face.    \"Yes, as I understand.\"    She shuddered, and was silent.    \"Was it not a dream, then?\" added Mr. Chillingworth.    She wrung her hands, and in a voice of extreme anguish and pathos,  said,--    \"Would it were a dream--would it were a dream! Oh, if any one could but  convince me it was a dream!\"    \"Well, will you tell me what it was?\"    \"Yes, sir, it was a vampyre.\"    Mr. Chillingworth glanced at Henry, as he said, in reply to Flora's  words,--    \"I suppose that is, after all, another name, Flora, for the nightmare?\"    \"No--no--no!\"    \"Do you really, then, persist in believing anything so absurd, Miss  Bannerworth?\"    \"What can I say to the evidence of my own senses?\" she replied. \"I saw  it, Henry saw it, George saw, Mr. Marchdale, my mother--all saw it. We  could not all be at the same time the victims of the same delusion.\"    \"How faintly you speak.\"    \"I am very faint and ill.\"    \"Indeed. What wound is that on your neck?\"    A wild expression came over the face of Flora; a spasmodic action of the  muscles, accompanied with a shuddering, as if a sudden chill had come  over the whole mass of blood took place, and she said,--    \"It is the mark left by the teeth of the vampyre.\"    The smile was a forced one upon the face of Mr. Chillingworth.    \"Draw up the blind of the window, Mr. Henry,\" he said, \"and let me  examine this puncture to which your sister attaches so extraordinary a  meaning.\"    [Illustration]    The blind was drawn up, and a strong light was thrown into the room. For  full two minutes Mr. Chillingworth attentively examined the two small  wounds in the neck of Flora. He took a powerful magnifying glass from  his pocket, and looked at them through it, and after his examination was  concluded, he said,--    \"They are very trifling wounds, indeed.\"    \"But how inflicted?\" said Henry.    \"By some insect, I should say, which probably--it being the season for  many insects--has flown in at the window.\"    \"I know the motive,\" said Flora \"which prompts all these suggestions it  is a kind one, and I ought to be the last to quarrel with it; but what I  have seen, nothing can make me believe I saw not, unless I am, as once  or twice I have thought myself, really mad.\"    \"How do you now feel in general health?\"    \"Far from well; and a strange drowsiness at times creeps over me. Even  now I feel it.\"    She sunk back on the pillows as she spoke and closed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14835"],[0,"The Burglar and the Blizzard: A Christmas Story (#8)"],[1,"not afraid to give it full sway. The deeply  susceptible man learns to be cautious, to distrust his feelings, but  Geoffrey had always too truly recognised his fundamental indifference to  have any reason to distrust himself. He had never been in love. Like  Ferdinand he, \"for different virtues had liked many women,\" although in  his case it had not always been necessarily virtues that had attracted  him. But there were certain women who had always appealed to him for  some conspicuous quality, or characteristic, who for one reason or  another pleased him, to which one side or another of his nature  responded. He had often thought that if he could make up a composite  woman of all of them he might be in great danger of falling in love. But  now he was aware that his whole nature responded to the attraction of  the girl upstairs, as a dog answers instinctively to the call of its  master. He could say to himself that she was this or that,--brave and  beautiful, but he knew that such qualities were but an insignificant  part of the total effect. His reason could find causes enough to approve  her, but something more important had gone ahead, and made straight the  paths of his reason, something which transcended it, and which in case  of a divergence between the two, his reason could never overcome.    For, of course, the realisation of McVay and all his presence implied  fell coolly upon his exaltation. By no means had Geoffrey said to  himself in so many words that he was in love,--far less had anything so  definite as marriage crossed his mind. He was too much in love to be so  practical. He only knew that McVay's mere existence was a contamination  and a tragedy.    He had been sitting thus for some time, when he heard her step on the  stairs. He rose and met her in the hall, whence he could still keep his  eye on McVay's studious figure in the library.    She was dressed in her sables ready for departure.    [Illustration: SHE WAS DRESSED IN HIS SISTER'S SABLES--READY FOR  DEPARTURE]    They looked at each other a moment in silence, he appealingly, she, with  a cold blankness that seemed to say that not even a look could make her  take further notice of him as a living being.    \"Have you really been thinking that I wanted to turn you out?\" he said,  with directness.    \"I have not been thinking about the matter at all,\" she answered,  turning her head a little aside from his direct gaze. \"But I do think so  of course. After all why should you not wish it?\"    \"You think me likely to want anything that would part us--that is the  way my manner strikes you?\" He was surprised to find his voice not  absolutely steady.    She favoured him with a short stare from under her lids. \"You seem to  forget that I have your own word that you insisted on our going.  Possibly you have changed your mind, but I have made mine up.\" She made  a motion as if to pass in, and go on toward the library.    \"I have changed so completely since I saw you,\" said Geoffrey, \"that I  scarcely recognise life in this--this ecstasy. That is the only change.  Am I likely to turn you out when I have been waiting all my life for you  to come?\"    It had been with her own dream, her own credulity with which she had  been fighting quite as much as with Holland, and the charm began to work  once again. She said very coolly:    \"You are very kind, but as you said, we ought to be starting,--or have  you forgotten saying that?\"    \"Be just. You knew I was going too. You knew I urged our going  because--\"    \"Well, why?\" Her look was still from half-shut lids, but the lines of  her mouth had softened by not a little.    \"There is a danger of being snowed up here. Now I appreciate that there  would be greater danger in starting out so late. And,--and equally  desperate for me, whatever we do.\"    \"Desperate?\"    \"If you only want an opportunity to think so meanly of me,--to hate me,  as your look said.\"    \"I do not hate you.\"    \"You are very eager to be rid of my company.\"    \"I did not understand.\"    \"You are going to stay?\"    \"Until we can go safely.\"    \"Not longer?\"    As this was a question obviously impossible to answer directly she said,  \"We are under sufficiently large obligations to you already.\"    And Geoffrey, about to answer, looked up and saw McVay was observing  them with satisfaction, so that words froze on his lips.    Here was the whole bitterness of the situation concentrated. To be  observed at all in a moment of genuine emotion was bad enough, but to be  observed by one who so plainly hoped to profit, was unbearable. Never,  said Geoffrey to himself, at that glance of triumph from McVay's clear  little eyes, never should any influence lead him to let a thief slip  through his fingers.    He realised too, for the first time, that he could not hope for another  word alone with Cecilia. McVay must always be present. It was a hideous  sort of revenge that every waking minute must be spent in the man's  company. Geoffrey had not appreciated the full meaning of his  instructions to McVay to keep always in sight. Not a word or a look  could be exchanged without McVay's seeing and rejoicing.    Yet, in spite of his irritation, he could not but admire the sort of  affectionate swagger with which McVay rose to greet her, as if the  brother of so tender a creature must remember his responsibility.    \"Well, my dear,\" he said sitting down beside her on the sofa, \"feel  better? Really a terrible experience. Holland has just been telling me  about it--saying how well you behaved,\" (Geoffrey favoured him with a  scowl behind her back), \"a perfect heroine,--so he says.\"    \"Mr. Holland is very kind,\" said the girl.    \"Kind!\" cried McVay enthusiastically. \"Kind! I should rather think he  was. Why, I could give you instances of his kindness--\"    \"You need not trouble,\" said Geoffrey.    McVay smiled at his sister as much as to say: What did I tell you?... so  modest, so unassuming.    To Geoffrey this sort of thing was unspeakably painful. He was willing  enough to meet McVay in a grim interchange over his strange combination  of facility and crime, of doom and triviality. But when it became any  question of playing upon Cecilia's unconsciousness of the situation, he  writhed. Yet, a little discernment would have shown him how natural, how  encouraging from his own point of view her unconsciousness was. To fall  in love thoroughly is sufficiently disconcerting. Which of us needs to  be told that it is an absorbing process, that life looks different, and  that all past experiences must be reviewed in the light of this  unexpected illumination. And if this is true of the more usual forms of  the great passion, what is to be said of a girl who, in a single day,  sees and loves a rescuer, a handsome powerful young creature, who comes  to her with all the attributes of a soldier and a prince, who comes not  only to save and protect, but as host and dispenser of all comfort and  beauty.    It was not to be wondered at that she was dazzled and aware of one fact,  one personality, that far from being able to draw shrewd conclusions  from the little happenings going on before her, she was but dimly aware  of the existence of her brother, of the world, of anything but Geoffrey.    Presently she said, as if trying to call up the picture:    \"And this is where you sat all night?\" And if the thought was  interesting to her, it was not on account of her brother's share in it.    \"Yes,\" returned McVay, springing lightly to his feet. \"Here we sat  discussing plans for your safety.\" He took a step toward the pair at the  fire, and then remembering, stopped. \"Please move a little back,  Holland,\" he said, \"I want to get nearer the fire. I'm cold.\"    [Illustration: \"PLEASE MOVE A LITTLE BACK, HOLLAND,\" HE SAID, \"I WANT TO  GET NEARER THE FIRE\"]    \"You can go to the fire,\" said Geoffrey, with a gesture of permission.    \"Of course you can,\" said the girl, \"Mr. Holland is not in your way,  Billy.\"    But Billy continued to eye his host. \"Oh, no, you don't,\" he said  warily. \"Not unless you move back. Do move, there's a good fellow.\" And  Geoffrey laughed and moved, somewhat to the girl's mystification. She  forgot to wonder, however, in pursuing the more wonderful train of  thought which had already been occupying her. Suppose that their plans  for her relief had been decided differently, suppose her brother had  come for her instead of the magnificent stranger, with what different  eyes she might now be looking on life--this ecstasy as Holland had  defined it. Curious to know by what accident she had been so blessed,  she asked:    \"Why was it, Billy, that you did not come after me yourself?\"    \"Just what I said to him,\" replied McVay eagerly. \"If I said once, I  said a dozen times: 'Holland, it is my duty and pleasure, it is my  _right_ to go,' but ...\" McVay shrugged his shoulders, \"when he once  gets an idea into his head, it takes a gimlet to get it out.\"    \"Upon my word, Billy,\" the girl said indignantly, \"I don't think you  ought to talk like that even in fun. You know perfectly well that Mr.  Holland only insisted on going because he thought he was better able to  bear the physical strain.\"    \"Physical strain!\" exclaimed McVay colouring to the roots of his sandy  hair, from pure annoyance; \"I don't know what you mean,... Holland is,  of course, a larger man than I, but not stronger.... Oh, well, as far as  mere brute force goes, perhaps, but in the matter of bearing physical  strain, you betray the most absurd ignorance. It is well known  scientifically that medium-sized men like myself, when their muscles are  at all developed (and you know my muscles), are better fitted for  endurance than any of these over-grown giants.\"    \"Then,\" said she calmly, \"if you knew you were better fitted I can't see  why you did not go.\"    \"You are not quite fair to your brother,\" said Geoffrey interrupting,  for McVay looked as if he would explode in another"]]]
