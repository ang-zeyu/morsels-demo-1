Some of the  most valuable of the antient reports are those published by lord chief  justice Coke; a man of infinite learning in his profession, though not  a little infected with the pedantry and quaintness of the times he  lived in, which appear strongly in all his works. However his writings  are so highly esteemed, that they are generally cited without the  author's name[r].    [Footnote r: His reports, for instance, are stiled, [Greek: kat'  exochen], _the reports_; and in quoting them we usually say, 1 or 2  Rep. not 1 or 2 Coke's Rep. as in citing other authors. The reports of  judge Croke are also cited in a peculiar manner, by the name of those  princes, in whose reigns the cases reported in his three volumes were  determined; viz. Qu. Elizabeth, K. James, and K. Charles the first; as  well as by the number of each volume. For sometimes we call them, 1,  2, and 3 Cro. but more commonly Cro. Eliz. Cro. Jac. and Cro. Car.]    BESIDES these reporters, there are also other authors, to whom great  veneration and respect is paid by the students of the common law. Such  are Glanvil and Bracton, Britton and Fleta, Littleton and Fitzherbert,  with some others of antient date, whose treatises are cited as  authority; and are evidence that cases have formerly happened in which  such and such points were determined, which are now become settled and  first principles. One of the last of these methodical writers in point  of time, whose works are of any intrinsic authority in the courts of  justice, and do not entirely depend on the strength of their  quotations from older authors, is the same learned judge we have just  mentioned, sir Edward Coke; who hath written four volumes of  institutes, as he is pleased to call them, though they have little of  the institutional method to warrant such a title. The first volume is  a very extensive comment upon a little excellent treatise of tenures,  compiled by judge Littleton in the reign of Edward the fourth. This  comment is a rich mine of valuable common law learning, collected and  heaped together from the antient reports and year books, but greatly  defective in method[s]. The second volume is a comment upon many old  acts of parliament, without any systematical order; the third a more  methodical treatise of the pleas of the crown; and the fourth an  account of the several species of courts[t].    [Footnote s: It is usually cited either by the name of Co. Litt. or as  1 Inst.]    [Footnote t: These are cited as 2, 3, or 4 Inst. without any author's  name. An honorary distinction, which, we observed, was paid to the  works of no other writer; the generality of reports and other tracts  being quoted in the name of the compiler, as 2 Ventris, 4 Leonard, 1  Siderfin, and the like.]    AND thus much for the first ground and chief corner stone of the laws  of England, which is, general immemorial custom, or common law, from  time to time declared in the decisions of the courts of justice; which  decisions are preserved among our public records, explained in our  reports, and digested for general use in the authoritative writings of  the venerable sages of the law.    THE Roman law, as practised in the times of it's liberty, paid also a  great regard to custom; but not so much as our law: it only then  adopting it, when the written law is deficient. Though the reasons  alleged in the digest[u] will fully justify our practice, in making it  of equal authority with, when it is not contradicted by, the written  law. \"For since, says Julianus, the written law binds us for no other  reason but because it is approved by the judgment of the people,  therefore those laws which the people hath approved without writing  ought also to bind every body. For where is the difference, whether  the people declare their assent to a law by suffrage, or by a uniform  course of acting accordingly?\" Thus did they reason while Rome had  some remains of her freedom; but when the imperial tyranny came to be  fully established, the civil laws speak a very different language.  \"_Quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem, cum populus ei et in eum  omne suum imperium et potestatem conferat_,\" says Ulpian[w].  \"_Imperator solus et conditor et interpres legis existimatur_,\" says  the code[x]. And again, \"_sacrilegii instar est rescripto principis  obviare_[y].\" And indeed it is one of the characteristic marks of  English liberty, that our common law depends upon custom; which  carries this internal evidence of freedom along with it, that it  probably was introduced by the voluntary consent of the people.    [Footnote u: _Ff._ 1. 3. 32.]    [Footnote w: _Ff._ 1. 4. 1.]    [Footnote x: _C._ 1. 14. 12.]    [Footnote y: _C._ 1. 23. 5.]    II. THE second branch of the unwritten laws of England are particular  customs, or laws which affect only the inhabitants of particular  districts.    THESE particular customs, or some of them, are without doubt the  remains of that multitude of local customs before mentioned, out of  which the common law, as it now stands, was collected at first by king  Alfred, and afterwards by king Edgar and Edward the confessor: each  district mutually sacrificing some of it's own special usages, in  order that the whole kingdom might enjoy the benefit of one uniform  and universal system of laws. But, for reasons that have been now long  forgotten, particular counties, cities, towns, manors, and lordships,  were very early indulged with the privilege of abiding by their own  customs, in contradistinction to the rest of the nation at large:  which privilege is confirmed to them by several acts of parliament[z].    [Footnote z: Mag. Cart. c. 9.--1 Edw. III. st. 2. c. 9.--14 Edw. III.  st. 1. c. 1.--and 2 Hen. IV. c. 1.]    SUCH is the custom of gavelkind in Kent and some other parts of the  kingdom (though perhaps it was also general till the Norman conquest)  which ordains, among other things, that not the eldest son only of the  father shall succeed to his inheritance, but all the sons alike: and  that, though the ancestor be attainted and hanged, yet the heir shall  succeed to his estate, without any escheat to the lord.--Such is the  custom that prevails in divers antient boroughs, and therefore called  borough-english, that the youngest son shall inherit the estate, in  preference to all his elder brothers.--Such is the custom in other  boroughs that a widow shall be intitled, for her dower, to all her  husband's lands; whereas at the common law she shall be endowed of one  third part only.--Such also are the special and particular customs of  manors, of which every one has more or less, and which bind all the  copyhold-tenants that hold of the said manors.--Such likewise is the  custom of holding divers inferior courts, with power of trying causes,  in cities and trading towns; the right of holding which, when no royal  grant can be shewn, depends entirely upon immemorial and established  usage.--Such, lastly, are many particular customs within the city of  London, with regard to trade, apprentices, widows, orphans, and a  variety of other matters; which are all contrary to the general law of  the land, and are good only by special custom, though those of London  are also confirmed by act of parliament[a].    [Footnote a: 8 Rep. 126. Cro. Car. 347.]    TO this head may most properly be referred a particular system of  customs used only among one set of the king's subjects, called the  custom of merchants or _lex mercatoria_; which, however different from  the common law, is allowed for the benefit of trade, to be of the  utmost validity in all commercial transactions; the maxim of law  being, that \"_cuilibet in sua arte credendum est_.\"    THE rules relating to particular customs regard either the proof of  their existence; their legality when proved; or their usual method of  allowance. And first we will consider the rules of proof.    AS to gavelkind, and borough-english, the law takes particular notice  of them[b], and there is no occasion to prove that such customs  actually exist, but only that the lands in question are subject  thereto. All other private customs must be particularly pleaded[c],  and as well the existence of such customs must be shewn, as that the  thing in dispute is within the custom alleged. The trial in both cases  (both to shew the existence of the custom, as, \"that in the manor of  Dale lands shall descend only to the heirs male, and never to the  heirs female;\" and also to shew that the lands in question are within  that manor) is by a jury of twelve men, and not by the judges, except  the same particular custom has been before tried, determined, and  recorded in the same court[d].    [Footnote b: Co. Litt. 175 _b._]    [Footnote c: Litt. Sec. 265.]    [Footnote d: Dr and St. 1. 10.]    THE customs of London differ from all others in point of trial: for,  if the existence of the custom be brought in question, it shall not be  tried by a jury, but by certificate from the lord mayor and aldermen  by the mouth of their recorder[e]; unless it be such a custom as the  corporation is itself interested in, as a right of taking toll, &c,  for then the law permits them not to certify on their own behalf[f].    [Footnote e: Cro. Car. 516.]    [Footnote f: Hob. 85.]    WHEN a custom is actually proved to exist, the next enquiry is into  the legality of it; for if it is not a good custom it ought to be no  longer used. \"_Malus usus abolendus est_\" is an established maxim of  the law[g]. To make a particular custom good, the following are  necessary requisites.    [Footnote g: Litt. Sec. 212. 4 Inst. 274.]    1. THAT it have been used so long, that the memory of man runneth not  to the contrary. So that if any one can shew the beginning of it, it  is no good custom.

Begin weaving at letter B and weave the outer border line around the  entire mat. Next weave the inside border line beginning at D.    After finishing the border lines, weave all four corner designs.    Count from C to H, 9 straws;  from H to I, 5;  from I to J, 27;  from J to K, 5;  from L to M, 6; and  from N to O, 8.    Now weave from O to P. From P to Q is 4 straws, and from P to R is  7 straws.    Mats woven for this design should be:  239 by 425;  301 by 487;  301 by 549;  555 by 741.    In the last mat, 555 by 741, G to S is 8 instead of 5.    On ticug mats of natural straw this design may be embroidered in the  following colors:    No. 2, 3, 6, or 15, solid.    No. 14 with border lines of No. 15 (except on sabutan).    No. 14 with border lines of No. 9.        Chick Design.

Count down from corner A to B and weave the corner design. Now weave  all four corner designs. Begin at F and weave the inner border line  entirely around the mat.    Count from F to G and weave the design above G. Count from H to I and  weave the second design. Now count from G to J and weave the figure  above J exactly like the figure above G.    Mats woven for this design should be 254 by 416, 308 by 524, 416  by 524, or 590 by 806 straws. The last mat has a change in margin,  and the distance from A to B is 58 straws.    This mat may be embroidered in the following colors:    No. 3, 6, 10, or 15.        Orchid Design.    The distance from the corner A to B is 13 straws;  from B to C, 2;  from C to D, 19;  from D to E, 35;  from E to F, 17;  from C to F, 71;  from F to G, 2;  from G to H, 19;  from M to N, 6;  from F to M, 67;  from M to K, 13; and  from K to J, 19.    Begin weaving at B and weave the outside border line around the entire  mat. Next count from C to F and weave the inside border line. Now  weave all four corner designs. Count from F to M, then up to K,  and weave from K to J. [37]    To find the position of the next design count 81 straws beyond L  along the inner border line, and then up the same distance as L K.    Mats woven for this design should be 301 by 544; 220 by 382; 301 by  463; and 550 by 712 straws. In mat 550 by 712, A B is 17 straws.    In mats of natural color straw, the following colors may be used in  the designs:    No. 2, 3, 6, or 15 solid.    No. 3 with flowers of No. 1 and border lines of No. 9 except on  sabutan.    No. 12 with flowers of No. 7 and border lines of No. 15.        Woman Carrying Clothes Design.    The distance from A to B is 29 straws;  from B to C is 2;  from C to D is 36;  from I to J is 3;  from B to E is 11;  from E to K is 9;  from E to F is 21;  from F to G is 3; and  from G to H is 10.    Count from A, the corner of the mat, to B. At B begin to weave the  border line. Weave first to E, then entirely around the mat.    Now count from C to D and weave the inner border line entirely around  the mat. Next, weave in the four corner designs. Count from E to F,  then down to G. From G to H is 10 straws. Now weave the first two  designs on the side and then the next two, and so on.    Mats woven for this design should be 300 by 392; 304 by 534; 254 by  346; or 568 by 706.    On all of these mats the design will look better if twice the size  of the pattern. Therefore all the above distances will be double,  or as follows:    A to B, 58 straws;  B to C, 4;  B to E, 22;  E to F, 42;  C to D, 72 straws;  I to J, 6;  E to K, 18;  F to G, 6.    In mat 304 by 534, E to K is 20 and A to B is 51 (already double). In  mat 568 by 706, from A (corner of mat) to B is 39, making E to K 14  straws (already doubled).    This design in ticug straw will work up well in No. 5 solid; in No. 4  solid; in No. 3 solid; in No. 5 with No. 2 as inner and outer border  line, or with No. 1 as inner and outer border line.    This design on sabutan straw may be made in No. 1 solid; in No. 2  solid; in No. 5 solid; in No. 6 solid; in No. 2 with No. 1 for border  lines; in No. 4 with No. 1 for border lines; or in No. 5 with No. 1  for border lines.    This design will work up well in the following colors: No. 2, 3, 6,  or 15.        Lavandera Design.    The distance from A to B is 15 straws;  from B to C is 4;  from C to D is 40;  from D to E is 21;  from E to F is 3;  from F to G is 4;  from G to H is 3;  from D to I is 12;  from I to J is 13;  from I to K is 18;  from K to O is 5;  from O to L is 2;  from L to M is 26; and  from M to N is 28.    Count down from A to B and mark B and C. Place similar marks at the  three other corners of the mat. Weave the border line around the  entire mat, touching the marked points. Count from C to G, mark,  and do the same in the other three corners.    Weave G H around the mat, touching the marked points at the  corners. Count from C to D and over to I, and weave I J. Weave the  whole figure just started, and the figure facing it, including the  ground line beneath. Weave the other corners in a similar manner.    At K count to O, back to L, over to M, and weave the figure beneath  M. Mark off L M and M N. Now continue marking alternately across  the side spaces equal to L M and M N, making the last space equal to  L M. Weave the figure between these marks and continue marking and  weaving in the same way on the other sides.    Mats woven for this design should be made:  237 by 399;  345 by 507;  690 by 1014 (units double size);  453 by 615.    In ticug mats of natural straw the following colors may be used:    No. 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 15, or 16, solid. (16 should not be used on  sabutan.)        Man with Bow and Arrow Design.    The distance from A to B is 20 straws;  from B to C is 2;  from C to D is 30;  from D to E is 17;  from E to F is 66;  from F to G is 3;  from G to H is 11 1/2;  from H to I is 9;  from J to K is 17;  from I to L is 33; and  from L to M is 14 1/2.    Count from A to B. At B weave the border band around the entire  mat. Count from C to F (113) and weave the inner border line around  the entire mat. Now weave all four corner designs. Count from G to  H and up to I, and weave the two figures.    To place the next two figures, which are exactly like the two just  woven, count out from J, 17 straws, and repeat from K which is the  tip of the arrow of the first figure, just made.    Mats woven for this design should be:  345 by 501, 9 straws;  505 by 739, 11;  739 by 1051, 11.    In mats 505 by 739, and 739 by 1051, from A to B is 24 straws.    This design in tikug may be worked up in the following colors on  natural color straw:    Solid, No. 2, 3, 6, 10, or 15.        Casa Design.    The distance from the corner A to B is 22 straws;  from B to C is 33;  from C to D is 24; and  from F to G is 17.    Count down from A to B and weave border line around the entire  mat. Now count from B to D and from D to E, 3 1/2 straws, and commence  weaving the inner border line. When completed, weave in all four corner  designs. Count from F to G and weave in the next design, and so on. Let  H I, the steps, be on the left of every casa except the corner ones.    Mats woven for this design should be 254 by 407 straws; 271 by 424;  304 by 542 (double); 406 by 542 (double); or 576 by 712. In the last  three of these, 304 by 542, 406 by 542, and 576 by 712, the counts  should all be doubled, the designs being twice the size of those in the  first two mats; that is, from A to B will be 44, B to C, 66, and so on.    Tikug mats in natural straw may be embroidered in the following colors:    No. 14 for casa, No. 12 for tree, No. 15 for border lines except  on sabutan;    No. 3 for casa, No. 15 for tree, No. 8 for border lines; and Nos. 2,  3, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, or 16, solid;    No. 16 should not be used on sabutan.        Chicken Vender Design.    The distance from the corner A to B is 15 straws, counting the corner  fold as 1. All counts in this design are woven double.    Therefore from A to B is 30;  from B to C is 17 by 2 or 34;  from C to D is 44;  from E to G is 16;  from F to H is 14;  from B to D is 78;  from G to I is 24; and  from J to K is 30.    Notice that the space on the right of the corner is one less than  the space on the left; this will occur on the right and left of  each corner. Count down from corner A to B and weave a line entirely  around the mat. Count from B to D and weave the inner border line. Now  weave the basket in each corner. Then weave from G to I and J to K,  and so on.    Mats woven for this design should be:  332 (7) by 512 (12)--from A to B is 30 straws;  260 (5) by 404 (9)--from A to B is 30;  260 (5) by 476 (11)--from A to B is 30; or  512 by 692 (17)--from A to B is 30.    On tikug mats of natural color this design may be embroidered in the  following colors:    No. 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, or 16. (16 should not be used on sabutan).    No. 14 with a single straw outline and solid border lines of No. 9,  8, or 3.    No. 14 with outlines of No. 3 and baskets and hats of No. 1, except  on sabutan.        Carabao, Cart, and Driver Design.    The distance from A to B is 32 straws, but it must be woven twice  that size, making A B equal 64.    All the sizes given below are double the count on the drawings:  from A to B is 64;  from B to C is 40;  from C to D is 18;  from D to E is 6;  from D to F is 8;  from A to D is 122;  from B to I is 30; and  from G to H is 16.    Count from the corner A to B and weave B C. Count from A to D and  mark off D. Count from C to D and test the count. From each corner  of the mat make a count similar to A D and mark. Weave the border  line, commencing at D, around the entire mat, touching the marks at  the corners. Weave design B C, and a similar design in each remaining  corner. Count"]]]
