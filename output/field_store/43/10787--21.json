He started for the door, then turned.    \"One thing,\" he asked. \"Just what do these savages--the grubbers--look  like?\"    \"How do I know,\" Krannon snapped. \"I trade with them, I don't make love  to them. If I ever saw one, I'd shoot him down on the spot.\" He flexed  his fingers and his gun jumped in and out of his hand as he said it.  Jason quietly let himself out.    Lying on his bunk, resting his gravity-weary body, he searched for a way  to get Krannon to change the delivery date. His millions of credits were  worthless on this world without currency. If the man couldn't be  convinced, he had to be bribed. With what? Jason's eyes touched the  locker where his off-world clothing still hung, and he had an idea.    It was morning before he could return to the food warehouse--and one day  closer to his deadline. Krannon didn't bother to look up from his work  when Jason came in.    \"Do you want this?\" Jason asked, handing the outcast a flat gold case  inset with a single large diamond. Krannon grunted and turned it over in  his hands.    \"A toy,\" he said. \"What is it good for?\"    \"Well, when you press this button you get a light.\" A flame appeared  through a hole in the top. Krannon started to hand it back.    \"What do I need a little fire for? Here, keep it.\"    \"Wait a second,\" Jason said, \"that's not all it does. When you press the  jewel in the center one of these comes out.\" A black pellet the size of  his fingernail dropped into his palm. \"A grenade, made of solid  ulranite. Just squeeze it hard and throw. Three seconds later it  explodes with enough force to blast open this building.\"    This time Krannon almost smiled as he reached for the case. Destructive  and death-dealing weapons are like candy to a Pyrran. While he looked at  it Jason made his offer.    \"The case and bombs are yours if you move the date of your next delivery  up to tomorrow--and let me go with you.\"    \"Be here at 0500,\" Krannon said. \"We leave early.\"          XV.      The truck rumbled up to the perimeter gate and stopped. Krannon waved to  the guards through the front window, then closed a metal shield over it.  When the gates swung open the truck--really a giant armored tank--ground  slowly forward. There was a second gate beyond the first, that did not  open until the interior one was closed. Jason looked through the  second-driver's periscope as the outer gate lifted. Automatic  flame-throwers flared through the opening, cutting off only when the  truck reached them. A scorched area ringed the gate, beyond that the  jungle began. Unconsciously Jason shrank back in his seat.    All the plants and animals he had seen only specimens of, existed here  in profusion. Thorn-ringed branches and vines laced themselves into a  solid mat, through which the wild life swarmed. A fury of sound hurled  at them, thuds and scratchings rang on the armor. Krannon laughed and  closed the switch that electrified the outer grid. The scratchings died  away as the beasts completed the circuit to the grounded hull.    It was slow-speed, low-gear work tearing through the jungle. Krannon had  his face buried in the periscope mask and silently fought the controls.  With each mile the going seemed to get better, until he finally swung up  the periscope and opened the window armor. The jungle was still thick  and deadly, but nothing like the area immediately around the perimeter.  It appeared as if most of the lethal powers of Pyrrus were concentrated  in the single area around the settlement. Why? Jason asked himself. Why  this intense and planetary hatred?    The motors died and Krannon stood up, stretching. \"We're here,\" he said.  \"Let's unload.\"    There was bare rock around the truck, a rounded hillock that projected  from the jungle, too smooth and steep for vegetation to get a hold.  Krannon opened the cargo hatches and they pushed out the boxes and  crates. When they finished Jason slumped down, exhausted, onto the pile.    \"Get back in, we're leaving,\" Krannon said.    \"You are, I'm staying right here.\"    Krannon looked at him coldly. \"Get in the truck or I'll kill you. No one  stays out here. For one thing you couldn't live an hour alone. But worse  than that the grubbers would get you. Kill you at once, of course, but  that's not important. But you have equipment that we can't allow into  their hands. You want to see a grubber with a gun?\"    While the Pyrran talked, Jason's thoughts had rushed ahead. He hoped  that Krannon was as thick of head as he was fast of reflex.    Jason looked at the trees, let his gaze move up through the thick  branches. Though Krannon was still talking, he was automatically aware  of Jason's attention. When Jason's eyes widened and his gun jumped into  his hand, Krannon's own gun appeared and he turned in the same  direction.    \"There--in the top!\" Jason shouted, and fired into the tangle of  branches. Krannon fired, too. As soon as he did, Jason hurled himself  backwards, curled into a ball, rolling down the inclined rock. The shots  had covered the sounds of his movements, and before Krannon could turn  back the gravity had dragged him down the rock into the thick foliage.  Crashing branches slapped at him, but slowed his fall. When he stopped  moving he was lost in the tangle. Krannon's shots came too late to hit  him.    Lying there, tired and bruised, Jason heard the Pyrran cursing him out.  He stamped around on the rock, fired a few shots, but knew better than  to enter the trees. Finally he gave up and went back to the truck. The  motor gunned into life and the treads clanked and scraped down the rock  and back into the jungle. There were muted rumblings and crashes that  slowly died away.    Then Jason was alone.           *       *       *       *       *    Up until that instant he hadn't realized quite how alone he would be.  Surrounded by nothing but death, the truck already vanished from sight.  He had to force down an overwhelming desire to run after it. What was  done was done.    This was a long chance to take, but it was the only way to contact the  grubbers. They were savages, but still they had come from human stock.  And they hadn't sunk so low as to stop the barter with the civilized  Pyrrans. He had to contact them, befriend them. Find out how they had  managed to live safely on this madhouse world.    If there had been another way to lick the problem, he would have taken  it; he didn't relish the role of martyred hero. But Kerk and his  deadline had forced his hand. The contact had to be made fast and this  was the only way.    There was no telling where the savages were, or how soon they would  arrive. If the woods weren't too lethal he could hide there, pick his  time to approach them. If they found him among the supplies, they might  skewer him on the spot with a typical Pyrran reflex.    Walking warily he approached the line of trees. Something moved on  a branch, but vanished as he came near. None of the plants near a  thick-trunked tree looked poisonous, so he slipped behind it. There was  nothing deadly in sight and it surprised him. He let his body relax a  bit, leaning against the rough bark.    Something soft and choking fell over his head, his body was seized in a  steel grip. The more he struggled the tighter it held him until the  blood thundered in his ears and his lungs screamed for air.    Only when he grew limp did the pressure let up. His first panic ebbed a  little when he realized that it wasn't an animal that attacked him. He  knew nothing about the grubbers, but they were human so he still had a  chance.    His arms and legs were tied, the power holster ripped from his arm. He  felt strangely naked without it. The powerful hands grabbed him again  and he was hurled into the air, to fall face down across something warm  and soft. Fear pressed in again, it was a large animal of some kind. And  all Pyrran animals were deadly.    When the animal moved off, carrying him, panic was replaced by a feeling  of mounting elation. The grubbers had managed to work out a truce of  some kind with at least one form of animal life. He had to find out how.  If he could get that secret--and get it back to the city--it would  justify all his work and pain. It might even justify Welf's death if the  age-old war could be slowed or stopped.    Jason's tightly bound limbs hurt terribly at first, but grew numb with  the circulation shut off. The jolting ride continued endlessly, he had  no way of measuring the time. A rainfall soaked him, then he felt his  clothes steaming as the sun came out.    The ride was finally over. He was pulled from the animal's back and  dumped down. His arms dropped free as someone loosed the bindings. The  returning circulation soaked him in pain as he lay there, struggling to  move. When his hands finally obeyed him he lifted them to his face and  stripped away the covering, a sack of thick fur. Light blinded him as he  sucked in breath after breath of clean air.    Blinking against the glare, he looked around. He was lying on a floor of  crude planking, the setting sun shining into his eyes through the  doorless entrance of the building. There was a ploughed field outside,  stretching down the curve of hill to the edge of the jungle. It was too  dark to see much inside the hut.    Something blocked the light of the doorway, a tall animallike figure.  On second look Jason realized it was a man with long hair and thick  beard. He was dressed in furs, even his legs were wrapped in fur  leggings. His eyes were fixed on his captive, while one hand fondled an  ax that hung from his waist.    \"Who're you? What y'want?\" the bearded man asked suddenly.    Jason picked his words slowly, wondering if this savage shared the same  hair-trigger temper as the city dwellers.    \"My name is Jason.

To  be with this girl, to play with her, were to me an enduring source of  delight; and I remember that at this time I even developed a taste for  girlish amusements, which had hitherto been very disagreeable to me, and  for which later also my antipathy returned. Simultaneously with this  fondness for the girl, when I myself was about twelve years old I was  attracted by one of the schoolmasters, a man who ruled his classes very  strictly. My sentiments for this master were of exactly the same  character as those with which my tutor had formerly inspired me, but the  conditions of our intercourse were different, for I could see him only  in school, and on very rare occasions out of school hours, whereas in  the case of my tutor, who lived with us when I was at home, I could be  with him as much as I desired. This fondness for my schoolmaster  persisted simultaneously with the passion for the girl. When her brother  came home for the holidays, I saw him for a few days only, for I also  returned home for the holidays. Although I was by no means indifferent  to him, my former passionate affection for him had entirely disappeared.  My passion for his sister and for the schoolmaster lasted for a long  time. I also fell in love with a somewhat elderly female cousin who  chanced to visit our house. Growing older, I at length attained the age  of puberty, and experienced definite erections; these occurred  especially when I thought of my friend's sister; or when she touched me,  as occasionally happened, without, I believe, any sexual feeling on her  part. At this time also when erections had already begun, I still felt  definitely attracted by my schoolmaster, and under the influence of this  attraction erections occasionally occurred. Somewhat later came the time  when I began to masturbate. I can no longer remember with certainty  whether I was seduced to this practice by any of my school-fellows. We  sometimes talked to one another about the matter. I continued at times  to be influenced by the inclinations previously mentioned, viz., that  for my schoolmaster, and that for my friend's sister. I experienced also  transient passion for one of my school-fellows, who was remarkable for  his pleasing and delicately girlish exterior. It was not until several  years had elapsed, and the occurrence of seminal emissions had shown  that I had attained some degree of sexual maturity, that all inclination  towards the male sex disappeared, and the inclination towards the female  sex persisted in isolation. When I left the town, in order to attend a  different school, my fondness for my friend's sister passed away. I was  then sixteen years of age; from this time onwards my sexual passion was  exhibited exclusively towards members of the female sex.\"    CASE 2.--This case provides us with another description of the  undifferentiated sexual impulse. X. is thirty years of age. No morbid  condition is demonstrable in him. He remembers that the first sentiments  which he regards as sexual were experienced by him in the country. His  home was in a town, but during the holidays he was sent to board in the  country, in the house of a clergyman. He played much in the open air,  and he still recalls quite distinctly the passion with which, first of  all, he approached animals. \"As if by an irresistible impulse I was  attracted, now by a goat, now by a dog, sometimes even by a horse. No  excitement of the genital organs was noticeable at this time, but I have  no doubt whatever now that these inclinations were sexual in their  nature. Not only did I touch the animals, but I embraced them and kissed  them. The warmth and the odour proceeding from such an animal, which is  now as a rule distasteful to me, was then a source of pleasure. When I  left the country, I took these memories away with me, but gradually they  faded and became faint. Next a fondness for one of my school-fellows  became most marked, and this lasted for a long time. I know not how to  describe the feeling I had for him otherwise than as an immeasurable,  passionate love. I was unhappy when I sat above him in the class.  Occasionally we sat side by side, but not always, since our places were  determined by our performances in class. If I was sitting next above  him, it was a joy to me to fail deliberately to answer a question,  simply in order to enable him to take my place, and thus to give him  pleasure. This relationship continued undisturbed for several years; we  rose together from class to class and remained friends. Not until the  beginning of the true puberal development did this fondness begin to  wane. I began to learn dancing rather early, and in the dancing-class  was a girl by whom I was now greatly attracted. She was of the same age  as myself--fourteen years. As far as I can remember, my inclinations  were now confined for a time to my boy companion and to this girl. At  first my affection for the boy was the greater, but gradually my  affection for the girl, who was healthy and vivacious in appearance,  became stronger. Still, this passion was a fire of straw, for though, in  the course of the next few years, my fondness for the boy gradually  declined, whilst my affection for the girl grew stronger, yet later this  girl was expelled from my circle of interests by others, my inclinations  changing rapidly from one girl to another. Homosexual sentiments hardly  existed any more. Very occasionally, indeed, even up to my twentieth  year, a certain interest was aroused in me by any youth with a truly  girlish, milk-white countenance. But subsequently this homosexual  inclination disappeared entirely, and my heterosexual development was  completed, so that I am now, I believe, in every respect a healthy  male.\"    CASE 3.--Next we have the case of a woman, now married and twenty-six  years of age, in whom also the undifferentiated sexual impulse was  clearly manifested. From the age of eight to the age of fifteen years  she attended a day-school for girls, and subsequently, after receiving  private tuition for a time, went to a boarding-school. \"In my earlier  years I can recall no feelings for my school-fellows beyond those of  simple friendship. We kissed one another, but no more intimate contact  took place. In these kisses, I was not aware of any sentiment exceeding  pure friendship; and to-day when I thoroughly understand the nature of  the kiss of erotic love, I do not believe that there was any erotic  element intermingled with these first kisses. Such simple friendliness  towards my fellow-schoolgirls persisted unaltered even after in my tenth  year I first experienced a sentiment of enthusiastic devotion. This  latter was inspired by an actress, a remarkably beautiful woman visiting  our town--I lived then in a town of medium size--whose pictures were  displayed in all the shop windows. Although I realised later that her  talents were by no means of a high order, and notwithstanding the fact  that I never saw her on the stage, I conceived for her an enthusiastic  admiration. I tried from time to time, when I could do so without being  observed, to catch a glimpse of her in the street; almost the only  possible opportunity was when she was on her way to rehearsals. When the  actress went away, her place in my heart was occupied by a schoolmaster  of typically masculine appearance, with a full, fair beard. He gave us  lessons in history, literature, and German. Nearly all the class were  fascinated by him, and I by no means less than the others. This  admiration lasted almost the whole of the remaining time during which I  attended the school. When I went to the boarding-school, being now  somewhat older, and regarded as almost a young woman, I was allowed to  witness a representation of Faust. The part of Gretchen was played by an  actress who is still of note to-day, and she made a most enduring  impression on me. To my great delight I was unexpectedly presented to  her, and she wrote a line or two in my album. Unfortunately, the  headmistress would not allow us to go often to the theatre, a  prohibition doubtless in part dependent on the high prices of the seats.  But I still remember quite distinctly how I trembled with joy whenever I  was allowed to go. I remember, too, that on one occasion, in which it  had been arranged that I was to go to see a play in which this actress  did not appear, I shammed illness in order to save up the price of the  seat, go that I might use it on another occasion, on which I should be  able to see her. This particular enthusiasm lasted as long as I  remained at the boarding-school. When later I grew old enough to marry,  and when with the approval of my parents a gentleman who appeared to  love me (though, in fact, I think he was influenced rather by prudential  motives) began to pay me his addresses, my fondness for the actress soon  began to fade away. Even at the present day, however, I esteem this  artiste very highly indeed, and the impression which she made on my  imagination will never be entirely expunged from my memory. If I were to  see her to-day, I should willingly kiss her hands, in thankfulness for  the happy hours she has given me; but I do not believe that any erotic  element now remains in my feeling for her. I may add that I do not love  my husband passionately, although I love him well enough. Physical  contact with the actress of whom I have spoken would not be positively  repulsive to me, but such contact would, as far as I am concerned, be  entirely devoid of sexual feeling, and the idea of sexual contact with a  person of my own sex is very unpleasant to me; whereas in sexual  intercourse with my husband I am perfectly normal.\" This patient does  not belong to the class of sexually anaesthetic women; she feels the  impulse towards sexual intercourse, and in intercourse she experiences  normal enjoyment.    I shall now discuss some of "]]]
