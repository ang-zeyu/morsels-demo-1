That mankind are not infallible; that their  truths, for the most part, are only half-truths; that unity of opinion,  unless resulting from the fullest and freest comparison of opposite  opinions, is not desirable, and diversity not an evil, but a good,  until mankind are much more capable than at present of recognising all  sides of the truth, are principles applicable to men's modes of action,  not less than to their opinions. As it is useful that while mankind are  imperfect there should be different opinions, so is it that there should  be different experiments of living; that free scope should be given to  varieties of character, short of injury to others; and that the worth of  different modes of life should be proved practically, when any one  thinks fit to try them. It is desirable, in short, that in things which  do not primarily concern others, individuality should assert itself.  Where, not the person's own character, but the traditions or customs of  other people are the rule of conduct, there is wanting one of the  principal ingredients of human happiness, and quite the chief ingredient  of individual and social progress.    In maintaining this principle, the greatest difficulty to be encountered  does not lie in the appreciation of means towards an acknowledged end,  but in the indifference of persons in general to the end itself. If it  were felt that the free development of individuality is one of the  leading essentials of well-being; that it is not only a co-ordinate  element with all that is designated by the terms civilisation,  instruction, education, culture, but is itself a necessary part and  condition of all those things; there would be no danger that liberty  should be under-valued, and the adjustment of the boundaries between it  and social control would present no extraordinary difficulty. But the  evil is, that individual spontaneity is hardly recognised by the common  modes of thinking, as having any intrinsic worth, or deserving any  regard on its own account. The majority, being satisfied with the ways  of mankind as they now are (for it is they who make them what they are),  cannot comprehend why those ways should not be good enough for  everybody; and what is more, spontaneity forms no part of the ideal of  the majority of moral and social reformers, but is rather looked on with  jealousy, as a troublesome and perhaps rebellious obstruction to the  general acceptance of what these reformers, in their own judgment, think  would be best for mankind. Few persons, out of Germany, even comprehend  the meaning of the doctrine which Wilhelm von Humboldt, so eminent both  as a _savant_ and as a politician, made the text of a treatise--that  \"the end of man, or that which is prescribed by the eternal or immutable  dictates of reason, and not suggested by vague and transient desires,  is the highest and most harmonious development of his powers to a  complete and consistent whole;\" that, therefore, the object \"towards  which every human being must ceaselessly direct his efforts, and on  which especially those who design to influence their fellow-men must  ever keep their eyes, is the individuality of power and development;\"  that for this there are two requisites, \"freedom, and a variety of  situations;\" and that from the union of these arise \"individual vigour  and manifold diversity,\" which combine themselves in \"originality.\"[11]    Little, however, as people are accustomed to a doctrine like that of Von  Humboldt, and surprising as it may be to them to find so high a value  attached to individuality, the question, one must nevertheless think,  can only be one of degree. No one's idea of excellence in conduct is  that people should do absolutely nothing but copy one another. No one  would assert that people ought not to put into their mode of life, and  into the conduct of their concerns, any impress whatever of their own  judgment, or of their own individual character. On the other hand, it  would be absurd to pretend that people ought to live as if nothing  whatever had been known in the world before they came into it; as if  experience had as yet done nothing towards showing that one mode of  existence, or of conduct, is preferable to another. Nobody denies that  people should be so taught and trained in youth, as to know and benefit  by the ascertained results of human experience. But it is the privilege  and proper condition of a human being, arrived at the maturity of his  faculties, to use and interpret experience in his own way. It is for him  to find out what part of recorded experience is properly applicable to  his own circumstances and character. The traditions and customs of other  people are, to a certain extent, evidence of what their experience has  taught _them_; presumptive evidence, and as such, have a claim to his  deference: but, in the first place, their experience may be too narrow;  or they may not have interpreted it rightly. Secondly, their  interpretation of experience may be correct, but unsuitable to him.  Customs are made for customary circumstances, and customary characters:  and his circumstances or his character may be uncustomary. Thirdly,  though the customs be both good as customs, and suitable to him, yet to  conform to custom, merely _as_ custom, does not educate or develop in  him any of the qualities which are the distinctive endowment of a human  being. The human faculties of perception, judgment, discriminative  feeling, mental activity, and even moral preference, are exercised only  in making a choice. He who does anything because it is the custom, makes  no choice. He gains no practice either in discerning or in desiring what  is best. The mental and moral, like the muscular powers, are improved  only by being used. The faculties are called into no exercise by doing a  thing merely because others do it, no more than by believing a thing  only because others believe it. If the grounds of an opinion are not  conclusive to the person's own reason, his reason cannot be  strengthened, but is likely to be weakened by his adopting it: and if  the inducements to an act are not such as are consentaneous to his own  feelings and character (where affection, or the rights of others, are  not concerned), it is so much done towards rendering his feelings and  character inert and torpid, instead of active and energetic.    He who lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of life  for him, has no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one of  imitation. He who chooses his plan for himself, employs all his  faculties. He must use observation to see, reasoning and judgment to  foresee, activity to gather materials for decision, discrimination to  decide, and when he has decided, firmness and self-control to hold to  his deliberate decision. And these qualities he requires and exercises  exactly in proportion as the part of his conduct which he determines  according to his own judgment and feelings is a large one. It is  possible that he might be guided in some good path, and kept out of  harm's way, without any of these things. But what will be his  comparative worth as a human being? It really is of importance, not only  what men do, but also what manner of men they are that do it. Among the  works of man, which human life is rightly employed in perfecting and  beautifying, the first in importance surely is man himself. Supposing it  were possible to get houses built, corn grown, battles fought, causes  tried, and even churches erected and prayers said, by machinery--by  automatons in human form--it would be a considerable loss to exchange  for these automatons even the men and women who at present inhabit the  more civilised parts of the world, and who assuredly are but starved  specimens of what nature can and will produce. Human nature is not a  machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the work  prescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow and develop  itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forces  which make it a living thing.    It will probably be conceded that it is desirable people should exercise  their understandings, and that an intelligent following of custom, or  even occasionally an intelligent deviation from custom, is better than a  blind and simply mechanical adhesion to it. To a certain extent it is  admitted, that our understanding should be our own: but there is not the  same willingness to admit that our desires and impulses should be our  own likewise; or that to possess impulses of our own, and of any  strength, is anything but a peril and a snare. Yet desires and impulses  are as much a part of a perfect human being, as beliefs and restraints:  and strong impulses are only perilous when not properly balanced; when  one set of aims and inclinations is developed into strength, while  others, which ought to co-exist with them, remain weak and inactive. It  is not because men's desires are strong that they act ill; it is because  their consciences are weak. There is no natural connection between  strong impulses and a weak conscience. The natural connection is the  other way. To say that one person's desires and feelings are stronger  and more various than those of another, is merely to say that he has  more of the raw material of human nature, and is therefore capable,  perhaps of more evil, but certainly of more good. Strong impulses are  but another name for energy. Energy may be turned to bad uses; but more  good may always be made of an energetic nature, than of an indolent and  impassive one. Those who have most natural feeling, are always those  whose cultivated feelings may be made the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34903"],[0,"Dress Design: An Account of Costume for Artists & Dressmakers (#17)"],[1,". The large poke-bonnet also kept the front as flat and  round as possible, with a high crown tilted upward in order to set over  the hair loops.

(_c_) Silk Spencer and Cape. 1818-27 (_Pattern, see p._ 324).]    [Illustration: FIG. 114.--1828-1836.]    The bodice began with a very pointed front and very low neck off the  shoulders, tuck-ins of fine embroidery, and capes or _fichus_ of the  same, covered the shoulders, often three deep. The pointed bodice only  lasted for a few years, when the waistband again became the favourite.  The sleeves were very large at the shoulders, diminishing at the wrist,  but soon took a big round form, sometimes tightly pleated into quarters  before 1835. We then get the huge sleeve gathered at the wrist, and  often falling below it; this again tightened on the forearm, and we note  a tendency to tighter sleeves coming in before 1837, neatly gathered  well down the shoulder. The evening-dress sleeve was a large puff, set  out by stiffening to a flat wide effect. Very wide epaulet collars were  seen on most dresses, meeting in a =V= shape at the waist, with a filling  of lace in the front, and many bodices were elaborately gathered, and  some of the sleeves were also gathered into puffs all down the arm.    [Illustration: FIG. 115.--1830-1840.]    The skirts were set out very full over stiff flounced petticoats, and  were worn rather short; as a rule they were trimmed with one or two  flounces, which were handsomely decorated, and a short polonaise is  occasionally seen. There were many interesting trimmings of gauze,  flowers, and bows; while silk-flowered gauze over dresses made some  charming effects.    Heavy mantles and capes or pelisses began to be braided, and rather  strong colours were in general taste.    The hand-bags were of a curved form and generally bore heavy tassels.  Very small fans and round fans were attractive, and bouquet-holders of  gilt, with pearl handles, became the thing to carry.    Shoes were of the low sandal type, fastened by crossed elastic, with  very square toes, and a tiny rosette or bow on the front; boots to the  ankle were now in fashion, mostly lacing at the inside, and having a  long toe-cap, sometimes with a small rosette at the top of this or a  tassel at front of the top of the boot.

The hair was worn rather full in curls at the sides or on top, parted at  the left side, besides being occasionally parted at the centre. Side  whiskers, curved forward, still continued, and a short trimmed beard was  now worn round under the chin by many, moustaches also made their first  appearance at the end of this reign. Top-hats were high and straight,  but many still adhered to the tapered crown and larger brim.    The same plain stocks of black satin continued, with or without a front  bow, and a soft pleated or frilled shirt-front.    The coats were similar to the last reign: the chief differences being an  increase in the length of the waist, wider tails, and large lapels of a  similar cut: velvet collars and cuffs were much worn, and the waist was  still made tight. A coat with a square skirt as in Fig. 116 is seen for  the first time, and the swallow-tailed coat was worn not quite so long.  A lower opening to the waistcoat was generally seen in evening attire,  which sometimes had but four small buttons, while more of the  single-breasted type were in use, with and without lapels.    Very tight trousers to the ankle buttoned up to the calf continued, or  plain trousers were held by straps under the boot; twill, corduroy, or  nankeen were both strapped or free at the ankle and rather short.  Knee-breeches were still worn by many for evening dress, and long  Italian capes with overcapes and high turn-over collars were  fashionable, besides the very full-skirted greatcoat.    Boots and shoes were square at the toes and rather long and narrow, the  shoes having a bow or buckle. Short Wellington boots continued much in  use, also spats.    Fobs of gold seals, &c., were worn, and eye-glasses attached to a black  ribbon is a noticeable feature.      NINETEENTH CENTURY. VICTORIA. FEMALE.    The hair was parted in the centre and tightened in a top setting of  plaits, with side curls over the ears. This mode was retained by many  till the fifties, but the top plaits began to be set lower at the back,  and the same flat parted hair was brought in a curved shape to the  front of the ears, often in a small plait, allowing the ear to show, or  in a plaited knot at either side; about 1850 it was waved, parted, and  simply curved from the forehead over the ears in a fuller manner,  sometimes being turned under to increase the side fullness, while the  back hair was arranged lower down the neck. In the sixties the hair was  waved and caught behind in ringlets or was bunched into the hideous  chignons, which are seen till about 1880.    [Illustration: FIG. 116.--1840-1860.]    The variety of caps and hats is too alarming to deal with, and baffles  comprehensible description, so it is best for the student to dip into  the hundreds of illustrations through this period in the _Ladies'  Magazine_, _Punch_, the _Illustrated London News_, or the _Ladies'  Treasury_ for the later styles.    The straw bonnet with a straighter poke front was favoured till 1850,  when the front became considerably reduced in size and fitted closely  round the face. The larger brimmed bonnets had a little frill by the  ears, and the tight-brimmed bonnet often had the frill all round with a  flower also tucked in effectively to the wearer's taste, and we see this  favoured till the seventies. In the fifties a large flat Leghorn hat  with a small crown was in evidence, the brim dipping back and front,  decorated with feathers or bows, and a three-cornered French hat with  feathers set in the brim came in with revival of the 18th-century style  about 1860. A small bowler hat and a very small \"pork-pie\" hat appears  in the late sixties, and a tiny-shaped bonnet of a curved form during  the seventies.    [Illustration: Plate XXX.--        (_a_) Printed Silk Bodice. 1840-50.            (_Pattern, see p. 320._)      (_b_) Gathered Linen Bodice. 1837-47.      (_c_) Silk Bodice and Bertha. 1845-55.]    [Illustration: FIG. 117.--1845-1855.]    At the beginning of this long reign we find the pointed bodice with a  normal length of waist has really come to stay, though many dresses  retain the waistband till the fifties, and there is such a confusion of  styles at that time, it is difficult to arrange a sequence. From the  18th century fashions became more complicated in the greater variety of  design, each overlapping the other, and several distinct forms of  character come and go during this long reign. I do not envy the person  who undertakes the chronology of our present period.    At the commencement in 1837 the huge sleeves gathered at the wrist were  still in evidence, especially as a gauze oversleeve to evening attire,  and they continued thus to the fifties, but very large sleeves were  really dying out and the usual reaction was setting in; the  full-shouldered sleeve had turned a somersault and was neatly gathered  tight from the shoulder to the elbow, the fullness falling on the  forearm, and this was gathered into a tight setting or wristband. The  =V=-shaped front to the bodice was kept in many dresses by a collar or two  tapering from the shoulders to the waist, the fullness of the breast  often being tightly gathered at the shoulders, besides a few inches in  the front point of the bodice. A very plain tight-fitting sleeve became  fashionable, and on most of these we find a small upper sleeve or a  double one as shown in A, Plate XXX (see p. 266); this was sometimes  opened at the outer side. These sleeves continued till about 1852. In  1853 a bell-shaped sleeve is noticed in ordinary dress, and this  continued in various sizes till 1875, reaching its fuller shape about  1864. These types of sleeves were usually worn over a tight one or a  full lawn sleeve gathered at the wrist; most bodices with this sleeve  were closely fitted and high in the neck, the waist often being cut into  small tabs. We also notice for a few years in the early fifties the  deeper part of the bell curved to the front of the arm, giving a very  ugly appearance. A close-fitting jacket also came into evidence till  about 1865 with tight sleeves and cuffs, sometimes with a little  turn-down collar and a longer skirt as in Fig. C, Plate XXXIII (see p.  282). This particularly fine embroidered specimen, in imitation of the  18th-century style, is interestingly cut away short at the back to allow  for better setting on the crinoline. There is another type of sleeve  seen about 1848, of a plain, full, square cut; these became varied in  shape, being opened up the side and generally trimmed with wide braids.  This clumsy character is seen up to 1878, the later ones being fuller in  cut. Zouave jackets were occasionally worn in the forties and later in  the early sixties, when the wide corselet belt was again favoured.  Skirts at the beginning of the reign were fully set out on drill  petticoats, stiff flounces, and even whalebone, so it was hardly \"a  great effect\" when the crinoline appeared about 1855, though a furious  attack was made against it at first; this undersetting developed to its  fullest extent between 1857 and 1864, and many dresses in the early  sixties were also worn short, showing the high boots of this period.  At first the crinoline was slightly held back from the front by ties,  and again in the sixties it was"]]]
