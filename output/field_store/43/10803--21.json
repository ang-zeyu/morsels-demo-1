Act Sess. 26. December 20. 1638.      The Assembly considering the great prejudice which Gods Kirk in this land,  hath sustained these years by-past, by the unwarranted printing of lybels,  pamphlets, and polemicks; to the disgrace of Religion, slander of the  Gospel, infecting and disquyeting the mindes of Gods people, and  disturbance of the peace of the Kirk, and remembring the former acts, and  custome of this Kirk, as of all other Kirks, made for restraining these  and the like abuses, and that nothing be printed concerning the Kirk, and  Religion, except it be allowed by these whom the Kirk intrusts with that  charge: The Assembly _unanimously_, by vertue of their ecclesiastical  authority, dischargeth and inhibiteth all printers within this Kingdome,  to print any act of the former Assemblies, any of the acts or proceedings  of this Assembly, any confession of Faith, any Protestations, any reasons  _pro_ or _contra_, anent the present divisions and contraversies of this  time, or any other treatise whatsoever which may concerne the Kirk of  Scotland, or Gods cause in hand, without warrand subscribed by Mr.  _Archbald Johnston_, as Clerk to the Assembly, and Advocate for the Kirk;  or to reprint without his warrand, any acts or treatises foresaids, which  he hath caused any other to print, under the paine of Ecclesiastical  censures to be execute against the transgressours by the several  Presbyteries, and in case of their refusal, by the several Commissioners  from this Assembly: Whereunto also we are confident, the honourable Judges  of this land will contribute their civill authority: and this to be  intimat publickly in pulpit, with the other generall acts of this  Assembly.          Act. Sess. 26. December 20. 1638.      The generall Assembly ordaineth all Presbyteries and Provinciall  Assemblies to conveen before them, such as are scandalous and malicious,  and will not acknowledge this Assembly, nor acquiesce unto the acts  thereof: And to censure them according to their malice and contempt, and  acts of this Kirk: and where Presbyteries are refractarie, granteth power  unto the severall Commissions to summond them to compear before the next  generall Assembly to be holden at _Edinburgh_, the third Wedinsday of  Julie, to abide their tryall and censure.          Act Sess. 26. December 20. 1638.      The Assembly considering the acts and practise of this Kirke in her purest  times, that the Commissioners of every Presbyterie, Burgh, and  Universitie, were both ordained to take, and really did take from the  Clerk; the whole generall acts of the Assembly, subscribed by the Clerk:  Whereby they might rule and conforme their judicatorie themselves, and all  persons within their jurisdictions, unto the obedience thereof:  Considering the great prejudices we have lately felt out of ignorance of  the acts of Assembly, Considering also the great necessity in this time of  reformation, beyond any other ordinarie time, to have an extract thereof:  The Assembly ordaineth be this present act, that all Commissioners from  Presbyteries, Burghes and Universities, presently get under the Clerks  hand an Index of the acts, till the acts themselves be extracted, and  thereafter to get the full extract of the whole generall acts, to be  insert in their Presbyterie books, whereby all their proceedings may be  regulate in time coming. Likeas the Assembly recommendeth unto every Kirk  Session, for the preservation of their particular Paroch from the reentrie  of the corruptions now discharged, and for their continuance in the  Covenant, anent doctrine, worship and discipline now declared, to obtain  an extract of these acts: especially if they be printed: Seeing their  pryce will no wayes then be considerable: as the benefite both of the  particular Parish, and the interest of the whole Kirk, in the preservation  thereof from defection is undenyable: seeing Presbyteries are composed of  sundry Parochins, and so must be affected, or infected as they are, as  Provinciall and generall Assemblies are composed of Presbyteries, and so  must be diposed as they are.          Act Sess. 26. December 20.      _In the Assembly at_ Glasgow 1638. _concerning the confession of Faith  renewed in Februar, 1638._    The Assembly considering that for the purging and preservation of  religion, for the Kings Majesties honour, and for the publick peace of the  Kirk and Kingdome, the renewing of that nationall Covenant and oath of  this Kirk and Kingdome, in Februar 1638. was most necessare, likeas the  Lord hath blessed the same from Heaven with a wonderfull successe for the  good of religion, that the said Covenant suspendeth the practise of  novations already introduced, and the approbation of the corruptions of  the present governement of the Kirk, with the civill places, and power of  Kirk-men, till they be tryed in a free general Assembly, and that now  after long and serious examination, it is found that by the confession of  Faith, the five articles of _Perth_, and Episcopall governement are  abjured and to be removed out of this Kirk, and the civill places and  power of Kirk-men are declared to be unlawfull; The Assembly alloweth and  approveth the same in all the heads and articles thereof, And ordaineth  that all Ministers, Masters of Universities, Colledges, and Schooles and  all others who have not already subscribed the said Confession and  Covenant, shall subscribe the same with these words prefixed to the  subscription viz., The article of this Covenant which was at the first  subscription referred to the determination of the general Assembly being  now determined at _Glasgow_, in December 1638. and thereby the five  articles of _Perth_, and the governement of the Kirk by Bishops, being  declared to be abjured and removed, the civill places and power of  Kirk-men declared to be unlawful; We subscrive according to the  determination, of the said free and lawfull generall Assembly holden at  _Glasgow_: and ordaineth, _ad perpetuam rei memoriam_, the said Covenant  with this declaration to be insert in the registers of the Assemblies of  this Kirk; generall, Provinciall and Presbyteriall.          Act Sess. 26. December 20. 1638.        _Concerning the subscribing the confession of Faith lately subscribed by  his Majesties Commissioner, and urged to be subscribed by others._      Seeing the generall Assembly, to whom belongeth properly the publick and  judiciall interpretation of the confession of Faith, hath now after  accurat tryall, and mature deliberation clearly found, that the five  articles of _Perth_, and the governement of the Kirk by Bishops, are  abjured by the confession of Faith, as the same was professed in the year  1580. and was renewed in this instant year 1638. And that the _Marques_ of  _Hammiltoun_ his Majesties Commissioner, hath caused print a Declaration,  bearing that his Majesties intention and his own, in causing subscribe the  confession of Faith, is no wayes to abjure, but to defend Episcopall  governement, and that by the oath and explanation set down in the act of  Councel, it neither was nor possibly could be abjured, requiring that none  take the said oath, or any other oath in any sense, which may not consist  with Episcopall governement: which is in-directly repugnant to the genuine  and true meaning of the foresaid Confession as it was professed in the  year 1580. as is clearly now found and declared by the generall Assembly:  Therefore the generall Assembly: Doth humbly supplicate, that his Majestie  may be graciously pleased, to acknowledge and approve the foresaid true  interpretation, and meaning of the generall Assembly, by his Royall  warrand to his Majesties Commissioner, Councel, and Subjects, to be put in  record for that effect, whereof we are confident, after his Majesty, hath  received true information from this Kirk, honoured with his Majesties  birth and baptisme, which will be a royal testimonie of his Majesties  piety and justice, and a powerfull meane to procure the heartie affection  and obedience of all his Majesties loyall Subjects: And in the meane time,  least any should fall under the danger of a contradictorie oath, and bring  the wrath of God upon themselves and the land, for the abuse of his Name  and Covenant; The Assembly by their Ecclesiastical authority, prohibiteth  and dischargeth, that no member or this Kirk swear or subscribe the said  Confession, so far wreasted to a contrary meaning, under paine of all  Ecclesiastical censure: but that they subscribe the confession of Faith,  renewed in Februar, with the Declaration of the Assembly set down in the  former act.          Act. Sess. 26. December 20. 1638.        _Concerning yearly generall Assemblies._      The Assembly having considered the reasons lately printed for holding of  general Assemblies, which are taken from the light of nature, the promise  of _Jesus Christ_, the practise of the holy Apostles, the doctrine and  custome of other reformed Kirks, and the liberty of this national Kirk, as  it is expressed in the book of Policie, and acknowledged in the act of  Parlament 1592, and from recent and present experience; comparing the  lamentable prejudices done to religion, through the former want of free  and lawful Assemblies, and the great benefite arysing to the Kirk, from  this one free and lawful Assembly; finde it necessary to declare, and  hereby declares, that by Divine, Ecclesiasticall, and Civill warrands,  this national Kirk hath power and liberty to Assemble and conveen in her  year-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2897"],[0,"The Sequel of Appomattox: A Chronicle of the Reunion of the States (#17)"],[1,"in the  Fourteenth Amendment, which was adopted by Congress and sent to the  States on June 13, 1866.    In the congressional campaign of 1866, reconstruction was almost the  sole issue. For success the Administration must gain at least one-third  of one house, while the radicals were fighting for two-thirds of each  House. If the Administration should fail to make the necessary gain, the  work accomplished by the Presidents would be destroyed. The campaign  was bitter and extended through the summer and fall. Four national  conventions were held: the National Union party at Philadelphia made a  respectable showing in support of the President; the Southern Unionists,  guided by the Northern radicals met at the same place; a soldiers'  and sailors' convention at Cleveland supported the Administration; and  another convention of soldiers and sailors at Pittsburgh endorsed the  radical policies. A convention of Confederate soldiers and sailors at  Memphis endorsed the President, but the Southern support and that of the  Northern Democrats did not encourage moderate Republicans to vote for  the Administration. Three members of Johnson's Cabinet--Harlan, Speed,  and Dennison--resigned because they were unwilling to follow their chief  further in opposing Congress.    The radicals had plenty of campaign material in the testimony collected  by the Joint Committee, in the reports of the Freedmen's Bureau, and in  the bloody race riots which had occurred in Memphis and New Orleans. The  greatest blunder of the Administration was Johnson's speechmaking tour  to the West which he called \"Swinging Around the Circle.\" Every time he  made a speech he was heckled by persons in the crowd, lost his temper,  denounced Congress and the radical leaders, and conducted himself in an  undignified manner. The election returns showed more than a two-thirds  majority in each House against the President. The Fortieth Congress  would therefore be safely radical, and in consequence the Thirty-ninth  was encouraged to be more radical during its last session.    Public interest now for a time turned to the South, where the Fourteenth  Amendment was before the state legislatures. The radicals, taunted with  having no plan of reconstruction beyond a desire to keep the Southern  States out of the Union, professed to see in the ratification of the  Fourteenth Amendment a good opportunity to readmit the States on a safe  basis. The elections of 1866 had pointed to the ratification of the  proposed amendment as an essential preliminary to readmission. But  would additional demands be made upon the South? Sumner, Stevens, and  Fessenden were sure that Negro suffrage also must come, but Wade, Chase,  Garfield, and others believed that nothing beyond the terms of the  Fourteenth Amendment would be asked.    In the Southern legislatures there was little disposition to ratify the  amendment. The rapid development of the radical policies during 1866 had  convinced most Southerners that nothing short of a general humiliation  and complete revolution in the South would satisfy the dominant party,  and there were few who wished to be \"parties to our own dishonor.\" The  President advised the States not to accept the amendment, but several  Southern leaders favored it, fearing that worse would come if they  should reject it. Only in the legislatures of Alabama and Florida was  there any serious disposition to accept the amendment; and in the end  all the unreconstructed States voted adversely during the fall and  winter of 1866-67. This unanimity of action was due in part to the  belief that, even if the amendment were ratified, the Southern states  would still be excluded, and in part to the general dislike of the  proscriptive section which would disfranchise all Confederates of  prominence and result in the breaking up of the state governments.  The example of unhappy Tennessee, which had ratified the Fourteenth  Amendment and had been readmitted, was not one to encourage conservative  people in the other Southern states.    The rejection of the amendment put the question of reconstruction  squarely before Congress. There was no longer a possibility of  accomplishing the reconstruction of the Southern states by means of  constitutional amendments. Some of the Border and Northern states were  already showing signs of uneasiness at the continued exclusion of the  South. But if the Constitutional Amendment had failed, other means  of reconstruction were at hand, for the radicals now controlled the  Thirty-ninth Congress, from which the Southern representatives were  excluded, and would also control the Fortieth Congress.    Under the lead of Stevens and Sumner, the radicals now perfected their  plans. On January 8,1867, their first measure, conferring the  franchise upon Negroes in the District of Columbia, was passed over the  presidential veto, though the proposal had been voted down a few  weeks earlier by a vote of 6525 to 35 in Washington and 812 to 1 in  Georgetown. In the next place, by an act of January 31, 1867, the  franchise was extended to Negroes in the territories, and on March 2,  1867, three important measures were enacted: the Tenure of Office Act  and a rider to the Army Appropriation Act--both designed to limit the  power of the President--and the first Reconstruction Act. By the Tenure  of Office Act, the President was prohibited from removing officeholders  except with the consent of the Senate; and by the Army Act he was  forbidden to issue orders except through General Grant or to relieve him  of command or to assign him to command away from Washington unless at  the General's own request or with the previous approval of the  Senate. The first measure was meant to check the removal of radical  officeholders by Johnson, and the other, which was secretly drawn up  for Boutwell by Stanton, was designed to prevent the President from  exercising his constitutional command of the army.    The first Reconstruction Act declared that no legal state government  existed in the ten unreconstructed states and that there was no adequate  protection for life and property. The Johnson and Lincoln governments  in those States were declared to have no legal status and to be subject  wholly to the authority of the United States to modify or abolish. The  ten states were divided into five military districts, over each of which  a general officer was to be placed in command. Military tribunals were  to supersede the civil courts where necessary. Stevens was willing to  rest here, though some of his less radical followers, disliking military  rule but desiring to force Negro suffrage, inserted a provision in  the law that a State might be readmitted to representation upon the  following conditions: a constitutional convention must be held, the  members of which were elected by males of voting age without regard  to color, excluding whites who would be disfranchised by the proposed  Fourteenth Amendment; a constitution including the same rule of suffrage  must be framed, ratified by the same electorate, and approved by  Congress; and lastly, the legislatures elected under this constitution  must ratify the proposed Fourteenth Amendment, after which, if  the Fourteenth Amendment should have become a part of the Federal  Constitution, the State should be readmitted to representation.    In order that the administration of this radical legislation might be  supervised by its friends, the Thirty-ninth Congress had passed a law  requiring the Fortieth Congress to meet on the 4th of March instead of  in December as was customary. According to the Reconstruction Act of the  2nd of March, it was left to the state government or to the people of a  state to make the first move towards reconstruction. If they preferred,  they might remain under military rule. Either by design or by  carelessness no machinery of administration was provided for the  execution of the act. When it became evident that the Southerners  preferred military rule, the new Congress passed a Supplementary  Reconstruction Act on the 23d of March designed to force the earlier act  into operation. The five commanding generals were directed to register  the blacks of voting age and the whites who were not disfranchised,  to hold elections for conventions, to call the conventions, to hold  elections to ratify or reject the constitutions, and to forward the  constitutions, if ratified, to the President for transmission to  Congress.    In these reconstruction acts the whole doctrine of radicalism was put on  the way to accomplishment. Its spread had been rapid. In December 1865,  the majority of Congress would have accepted with little modification  the work of Lincoln and Johnson. Three months later the Civil Rights Act  measured the advance. Very soon the new Freedmen's Bureau Act and  the Fourteenth Amendment indicated the rising tide of radicalism. The  campaign of 1866 and the attitude of the Southern states swept all  radicals and most moderate Republicans swiftly into a merciless course  of reconstruction. Moderate reconstruction had nowhere strong support.  Congress, touched in its amour propre by presidential disregard, was  eager for extremes. Johnson, who regarded himself as defending the  Constitution against radical assaults, was stubborn, irascible, and  undignified, and with his associates was no match in political strategy  for his radical opponents.    The average Republican or Unionist in the North, if he had not been  brought by skillful misrepresentation to believe a new rebellion  impending in the South, was at any rate painfully alive to the fear that  the Democratic party might regain power. With the freeing of the slaves,  the representation of the South in Congress would be increased. At first  it seemed that the South might divide in politics as before the war, but  the longer the delay the more the Southern whites tended to unite  into one party acting with the"]]]
