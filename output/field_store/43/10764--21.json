But  when the old man, trembling, begged for the liberty of his son as the  price of his fortune and his own life, the empress resumed her cold,  pitiless manner, and harshly replied--    \"I have already given orders for your son to be brought here; but  prepare for an eternal farewell, for he is to be taken to the fortress  of Melfi, and you in all probability will end your days beneath the  castle of Saint Agatha.\"    The grief of the poor count at this violent separation was so great,  that a few days later he was found dead in his dungeon, his lips covered  with a bloody froth, his hands gnawed in despair. Bertrand did not long  survive him. He actually lost his reason when he heard of his father's  death, and hanged himself on the prison grating. Thus did the murderers  of Andre destroy one another, like venomous animals shut up in the same  cage.    Catherine of Tarentum, carrying off the treasure she had so gained,  arrived at the court of Naples, proud of her triumph and contemplating  vast schemes. But new troubles had come about in her absence. Charles of  Durazzo, for the last time desiring the queen to give him the duchy of  Calabria, a title which had always belonged to the heir presumptive, and  angered by her refusal, had written to Louis of Hungary, inviting him to  take possession of the kingdom, and promising to help in the enterprise  with all his own forces, and to give up the principal authors of his  brother's death, who till now had escaped justice.    The King of Hungary eagerly accepted these offers, and got ready an army  to avenge Andre's death and proceed to the conquest of Naples. The tears  of his mother Elizabeth and the advice of Friar Robert, the old  minister, who had fled to Buda, confirmed him in his projects of  vengeance. He had already lodged a bitter complaint at the court of  Avignon that, while the inferior assassins had been punished, she who  was above all others guilty had been shamefully let off scot free, and  though still stained with her husband's blood, continued to live a life  of debauchery and adultery. The pope replied soothingly that, so far as  it depended upon him, he would not be found slow to give satisfaction to  a lawful grievance; but the accusation ought to be properly formulated  and supported by proof; that no doubt Joan's conduct during and after  her husband's death was blamable; but His Majesty must consider that the  Church of Rome, which before all things seeks truth and justice, always  proceeds with the utmost circumspection, and in so grave a matter more  especially must not judge by appearances only.    Joan, frightened by the preparations for war, sent ambassadors to the  Florentine Republic, to assert her innocence of the crime imputed to her  by public opinion, and did not hesitate to send excuses even to the  Hungarian court; but Andre's brother replied in a letter laconic and  threatening:--    \"Your former disorderly life, the arrogation to yourself of exclusive  power, your neglect to punish your husband's murderers, your marriage to  another husband, moreover your own excuses, are all sufficient proofs  that you were an accomplice in the murder.\"    Catherine would not be put out of heart by the King of Hungary's  threats, and looking at the position of the queen and her son with a  coolness that was never deceived, she was convinced that there was no  other means of safety except a reconciliation with Charles, their mortal  foe, which could only be brought about by giving him all he wanted. It  was one of two things: either he would help them to repulse the King of  Hungary, and later on they would pay the cost when the dangers were less  pressing, or he would be beaten himself, and thus they would at least  have the pleasure of drawing him down with them in their own  destruction.    The agreement was made in the gardens of Castel Nuovo, whither Charles  had repaired on the invitation of the queen and her aunt. To her cousin  of Durazzo Joan accorded the title so much desired of Duke of Calabria,  and Charles, feeling that he was hereby made heir to the kingdom,  marched at once on Aquila, which town already was flying the Hungarian  colours. The wretched man did not foresee that he was going straight to  his destruction.    When the Empress of Constantinople saw this man, whom she hated above  all others, depart in joy, she looked contemptuously upon him, divining  by a woman's instinct that mischief would befall him; then, having no  further mischief to do, no further treachery on earth, no further  revenge to satisfy, she all at once succumbed to some unknown malady,  and died suddenly, without uttering a cry or exciting a single regret.    But the King of Hungary, who had crossed Italy with a formidable army,  now entered the kingdom from the side of Aquila: on his way he had  everywhere received marks of interest and sympathy; and Alberto and  Mertino delta Scala, lords of Verona, had given him three hundred horse  to prove that all their goodwill was with him in his enterprise. The  news of the arrival of the Hungarians threw the court into a state of  confusion impossible to describe. They had hoped that the king would be  stopped by the pope's legate, who had come to Foligno to forbid him, in  the name of the Holy Father, and on pain of excommunication to proceed  any further without his consent; but Louis of Hungary replied to the  pope's legate that, once master of Naples, he should consider himself a  feudatory of the Church, but till then he had no obligations except to  God and his own conscience. Thus the avenging army fell like a  thunderbolt upon the heart of the kingdom, before there was any thought  of taking serious measures for defence. There was only one plan  possible: the queen assembled the barons who were most strongly attached  to her, made them swear homage and fidelity to Louis of Tarentum, whom  she presented to them as her husband, and then leaving with many tears  her most faithful subjects, she embarked secretly, in the middle of the  night, on a ship of Provence, and made for Marseilles. Louis of  Tarentum, following the prompting of his adventure-loving character,  left Naples at the head of three thousand horse and a considerable  number of foot, and took up his post on the banks of the Voltorno, there  to contest the enemy's passage; but the King of Hungary foresaw the  stratagem, and while his adversary was waiting for him at Capua, he  arrived at Beneventum by the mountains of Alife and Morcone, and on the  same day received Neapolitan envoys: they in a magnificent display of  eloquence congratulated him on his entrance, offered the keys of the  town, and swore obedience to him as being the legitimate successor of  Charles of Anjou. The news of the surrender of Naples soon reached the  queen's camp, and all the princes of the blood and the generals left  Louis of Tarentum and took refuge in the capital. Resistance was  impossible. Louis, accompanied by his counsellor, Nicholas Acciajuoli,  went to Naples on the same evening on which his relatives quitted the  town to get away from the enemy. Every hope of safety was vanishing as  the hours passed by; his brothers and cousins begged him to go at once,  so as not to draw down upon the town the king's vengeance, but unluckily  there was no ship in the harbour that was ready to set sail. The terror  of the princes was at its height; but Louis, trusting in his luck,  started with the brave Acciajuoli in an unseaworthy boat, and ordering  four sailors to row with all their might, in a few minutes disappeared,  leaving his family in a great state of anxiety till they learned that he  had reached Pisa, whither he had gone to join the queen in Provence.  Charles of Durazzo and Robert of Tarentum, who were the eldest  respectively of the two branches of the royal family, after hastily  consulting, decided to soften the Hungarian monarch's wrath by a  complete submission. Leaving their young brothers at Naples, they  accordingly set off for Aversa, where the king was. Louis received them  with every mark of friendship, and asked with much interest why their  brothers were not with them. The princes replied that their young  brothers had stayed at Naples to prepare a worthy reception for His  Majesty. Louis thanked them for their kind intentions, but begged them  to invite the young princes now, saying that it would be infinitely more  pleasant to enter Naples with all his family, and that he was most  anxious to see his cousins. Charles and Robert, to please the king, sent  equerries to bid their brothers come to Aversa; but Louis of Durazzo,  the eldest of the boys, with many tears begged the others not to obey,  and sent a message that he was prevented by a violent headache from  leaving Naples. So puerile an excuse could not fail to annoy Charles,  and the same day he compelled the unfortunate boys to appear before the  king, sending a formal order which admitted of no delay. Louis of  Hungary embraced them warmly one after the other, asked them several  questions in an affectionate way, kept them to supper, and only let them  go quite late at night.    When the Duke of Durazzo reached his room, Lello of Aquila and the Count  of Fondi slipped mysteriously to the side of his bed, and making sure  that no one could hear, told him that the king in a council held that  morning had decided to kill him and to imprison the other princes.  Charles heard them out, but incredulously: suspecting treachery, he  dryly replied that he had too much confidence in his cousin's loyalty to  believe such a black calumny. Lello insisted, begging him in the name of  his dearest friends to listen; but the duke was impatient, and harshly  ordered him to depart.

Real GDP growth is estimated to have slowed in    the last fiscal year primarily because adverse weather conditions    cut agricultural production, but is expected to rebound over 2005-06    because of foreign donor reconstruction and service sector growth.    Despite the progress of the past few years, Afghanistan remains    extremely poor, landlocked, and highly dependent on foreign aid,    farming, and trade with neighboring countries. It will probably take    the remainder of the decade and continuing donor aid and attention    to significantly raise Afghanistan's living standards from its    current status, among the lowest in the world. Much of the    population continues to suffer from shortages of housing, clean    water, electricity, medical care, and jobs, but the Afghan    government and international donors remain committed to improving    access to these basic necessities by prioritizing infrastructure    development, education, housing development, jobs programs, and    economic reform over the next year. Growing political stability and    continued international commitment to Afghan reconstruction create    an optimistic outlook for continuing improvements in the Afghan    economy in 2006. Expanding poppy cultivation and a growing opium    trade may account for one-third of GDP and looms as one of Kabul's    most serious policy challenges. Other long-term challenges include:    boosting the supply of skilled labor, reducing vulnerability to    severe natural disasters, expanding health services, and rebuilding    a war torn infrastructure.
