Among the Sea Dayaks the old jars, which constitute the chief part  of a man's wealth, are distributed among both sons and daughters;  if the jars are too few for equal distribution, they are jointly  owned until one can buy out the shares of his co-owners.    The members of a Kayan household are bound together, not merely by  their material circumstances, such as their shelter under a common  roof and their participation in common labours, and not merely by  the moral bonds such as kinship and their allegiance to one chief and  loyalty to one another, but also by more subtle ties, of which the most  important is their sharing in the protection and warning afforded to  the whole house by the omen-birds or by the higher powers served by  these. For omens are observed for the whole household, and hold good  only for those who live under the one roof, This spiritual unity of  the household is jealously guarded. Occasionally one family may wish  for some reason, such as bad dreams or much sickness, to withdraw  from the house. If the rest of the household is unwilling to remove  to a new house, they will oppose such withdrawal, and, if the man  insists on separating, a fine is imposed on him, and he is compelled to  leave undisturbed the roof and all the main structure of his section  of the house; though the room would be left unoccupied. Conversely  Kayans are very unwilling to admit any family to become members of  the household. They never or seldom add sections to a house which  has once been completed; and young married couples must live in  their parents' rooms, until the whole household removes and builds  a new house. Occasionally a remnant of a household which has been  broken up by the attack of enemies is sheltered by a friendly house;  but the newcomers are lodged in the gallery only until the time comes  for building a new house, when they may be allowed to build rooms for  themselves, and to become incorporated in the household. Another plan  sometimes adopted is to build a small house for the newcomers closely  adjoining the main house, but joined to it only by an open platform.      Appendix to Chapter V    Tables showing Kinship of the Kenyahs of Long Tikan (Tama  Bulan's house) in the Baram District of Sarawak.    We have made out tables showing the kinship of the inhabitants of  several Kenyah long houses and of one Sea Dayak house, following  the example and method of Dr. W. H. R. Rivers. These tables have  not revealed to us indications of any peculiar system of kinship;  but we think it worth while to reproduce one of them as an appendix  to the foregoing chapter. The table includes all the inhabitants of  the house living in the year 1899, as well as those deceased members  of whom we are able to obtain trustworthy information. The arrangement  is by door or room, but since on marriage some shifting from one room  to another takes place, some individuals appear under two doors.    In these tables the names of males are printed in ordinary type,  those of females in italics; and the following signs are used: --    = for married to.    = indicates the children of a married couple.    implies that the individual below whose name it occurs reached adult  life, but died without issue.    implies a child dead at early age, sex and name unknown.    [male] implies male child not yet named.    [female] implies female child not yet named    ? individual of unknown name.        (1) Sidi Karang's Door.

CHAPTER 6    Agriculture    For all the peoples of the interior of Borneo, the Punans and  Malanaus excepted, the rice grown by themselves is the principal  food-stuff. Throughout the year, except during the few weeks when the  jungle fruit is most abundant, rice forms the bulk of every meal. In  years of bad harvests, when the supply is deficient, the place of rice  has to be filled as well as may be with wild sago, cultivated maize,  tapioca, and sweet potatoes. All these are used, and the last three,  as well as pumpkins, bananas, cucumbers, millet, pineapples, chilis,  are regularly grown in small quantities by most of the peoples. But  all these together are regarded as making but a poor substitute for  rice. The cultivator has to contend with many difficulties, for in  the moist hot climate weeds grow apace, and the fields, being closely  surrounded by virgin forest, are liable to the attacks of pests of  many kinds. Hence the processes by which the annual crop of PADI is  obtained demand the best efforts and care of all the people of each  village. The plough is unknown save to the Dusuns, a branch of the  Murut people in North Borneo, who have learnt its use from Chinese  immigrants. The Kalabits and some of the coastwise Klemantans who  live in alluvial areas have learnt, probably through intercourse with  the Philippine Islanders or the inhabitants of Indo-China, to prepare  the land for the PADI seed by leading buffaloes to and fro across it  while it lies covered with water. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3310"],[0,"A Forgotten Empire (Vijayanagar): A Contribution to the History of India (#17)"],[1," they themselves have two eyes, and that we have but one, because  they consider that they excel all others in prudence.'[129]    \"The inhabitants of Cambay alone use paper; all other Indians write  on the leaves of trees. They have a vast number of slaves, and, the  debtor who is insolvent is everywhere adjudged to be the property  of his creditor. The numbers of these people and nations exceeds  belief. Their armies consist of a million men and upwards.\"    Abdur Razzak also visited, the city during the reign of Deva Raya  II., but about twenty years later than Conti. He was entrusted with  an embassy from Persia, and set out on his mission on January 13,  A.D. 1442. At the beginning of November that year he arrived at  Calicut, where he resided till the beginning of April 1443. Being  there he was summoned to Vijayanagar, travelled thither, and was in  the great city from the end of April till the 5th December of the  same year. The following passage explains why he left Calicut.    \"On a sudden a man arrived who brought me the intelligence that  the king of Bidjanagar, who holds a powerful empire and a mighty  dominion under his sway, had sent him to the Sameri[130] as delegate,  charged with a letter in which he desired that he would send on to him  the ambassador of His Majesty, the happy Khakhan (I.E. the king of  Persia). Although the Sameri is not subject to the laws of the king  of Bidjanagar, he nevertheless pays him respect and stands extremely  in fear of him, since, if what is said is true, this latter prince  has in his dominions three hundred ports, each of which is equal to  Calicut, and on TERRA FIRMA his territories comprise a space of three  months' journey.\"    In obedience to this request, Abdur Razzak left Calicut by sea  and went to Mangalore, \"which forms the frontier of the kingdom of  Bidjanagar.\" He stayed there two or three days and then journeyed  inland, passing many towns, and amongst them a place where he saw a  small but wonderful temple made of bronze.    \"At length I came to a mountain whose summit reached the skies. Having  left this mountain and this forest behind me, I reached a town called  Belour,[131] the houses of which were like palaces.\"    Here he saw a temple with exquisite sculpture.    \"At the end of the month of Zoul'hidjah[132] we arrived at the city of  Bidjanagar. The king sent a numerous cortege to meet us, and appointed  us a very handsome house for our residence. His dominion extends from  the frontier of Serendib to the extremities of the country of Kalbergah  (I.E. from the Krishna River to Cape Comorin). One sees there more  than a thousand elephants, in their size resembling mountains and in  their form resembling devils. The troops amount in number to eleven LAK  (1,100,000). One might seek in vain throughout the whole of Hindustan  to find a more absolute RAI; for the monarchs of this country bear  the title of RAI.    \"The city of Bidjanagar is such that the pupil of the eye has never  seen a place like it, and the ear of intelligence has never been  informed that there existed anything to equal it in the world. It  is built in such a manner that seven citadels and the same number  of walls enclose each other. Around the first citadel are stones of  the height of a man, one half of which is sunk in the ground while  the other half rises above it. These are fixed one beside the other  in such a manner that no horse or foot soldier could boldly or with  ease approach the citadel.\"    The position of these seven walls and gates have long been a puzzle to  me, but I hazard the following explanation. The traveller approached  from the southwest, and the first line of wall that he saw must have  been that on the neck between the two hills south-west of Hospett. Paes  also describes this outer defence-work as that seen by all travellers  on their first arrival from the coast. After being received at  this entrance-gate Razzak must have passed down the slope through  \"cultivated fields, houses, and gardens\" to the entrance of Hospett,  where the second line of fortification barred the way; and since that  town was not then thickly populated, the same features would meet  his eye till he passed a third line of wall on the north side of that  town. From this point the houses became thicker, probably forming a  long street, with shops on either side of the road, leading thence  to the capital. The fourth line of wall, with a strong gateway, is  to be seen on the south of the present village of Malpanagudi, where  several remains of old buildings exist; and notably a handsome stone  well, once probably belonging to the country-house of some noble  or chief officer. The fifth line is on the north of Malpanagudi,  and here the great gateway still stands, though the wall is much  damaged and destroyed. The sixth line is passed just to the south  of the Kamalapur tank. The seventh or inner line is the great wall  still to be seen in fairly good repair north of that village. This  last surrounded the palace and the government buildings, the space  enclosed measuring roughly a mile from north to south, and two miles  and a quarter from east to west. The remains of the upright stones  alluded to by Razzak were seen by Domingo Paes in A.D. 1520.[133]  I believe that they have now disappeared.    Razzak describes the outer citadel as a \"fortress of round shape, built  on the summit of a mountain, and constructed of stones and lime. It has  very solid gates, the guards of which are constantly at their post,  and examine everything with severe inspection.\" This passage must  refer to the outer line of wall, since Razzak's \"seventh fortress\"  is the innermost of all. The guards at the gates were doubtless the  officers entrusted with the collection of the octroi duties. Sir  Henry Elliot's translation (iv. 104) adds to the passage as quoted  the words, -- \"they collect the JIZYAT or taxes.\" This system of  collecting octroi dues at the gates of principal towns lasted till  recent days, having only been abolished by the British Government.    \"The seventh fortress is to the north, and is the palace of the  king. The distance between the opposite gates of the outer fortress  north and south is two parasangs,[134] and the same east to west.    \"The space which separates the first fortress from the second, and  up to the third fortress, is filled with cultivated fields and with  houses and gardens. In the space from the third to the seventh one  meets a numberless crowd of people, many shops, and a bazaar. By the  king's palace are four bazaars, placed opposite each other. On the  north is the portico of the palace of the RAI. Above each bazaar is  a lofty arcade with a magnificent gallery, but the audience-hall of  the king's palace is elevated above all the rest. The bazaars are  extremely long and broad.[135]    \"Roses are sold everywhere. These people could not live without roses,  and they look upon them as quite as necessary as food.... Each class  of men belonging to each profession has shops contiguous the one to  the other; the jewellers sell publicly in the bazaars pearls, rubies,  emeralds, and diamonds. In this agreeable locality, as well as in the  king's palace, one sees numerous running streams and canals formed  of chiselled stone, polished and smooth.[136]    \"On the left of the Sultan's portico rises the DEWAN KHANEH,[137]  which is extremely large and looks like a palace. In front of  it is a hall, the height of which is above the stature of a man,  its length thirty ghez and its breadth ten.[138] In it is placed  the DEFTER-KHANEH (court-house), and here sit the scribes.... In the  middle of this palace, upon an high estrade, is seated an eunuch called  the Danaik,[139] who alone presides over the divan. At the end of the  hall stand chobdars[140] drawn up in line. The Dewan or Danaik settles  people's affairs and hears their petitions. There is no appeal. After  concluding business the Danaik passes through seven doors into the  palace, and entering the last alone, makes his report to the king.    \"Behind the king's palace[141] are the house and hall allotted to  the Danaik. To the left of the said palace is the Mint.    \"This empire contains so great a population that it would be impossible  to give an idea of it without entering into extensive details. In the  king's palace are several cells, like basins, filled with bullion,  forming one mass.\"    Opposite the DIVAN-KHANEH, he continues, is the house of the elephants.    \"Each elephant has a separate compartment, the walls of which  are extremely solid, and the roof composed of strong pieces of  wood.... Opposite the Mint is the house of the Governor, where are  stationed twelve thousand soldiers on guard.... Behind the Mint is a  sort of bazaar, which is more than three hundred ghez in length, and  more than twenty in breadth.[142] On two sides are ranged houses and  forecourts; in front of them are erected, instead of benches (KURSI),  several lofty seats constructed of beautiful stones. On the two sides  of the avenue formed by the chambers are represented figures of lions,  panthers, tigers, and other animals.[143] Thrones and chairs are  placed on the platforms, and the courtesans seat themselves thereon,  bedecked in gems and fine raiment.\"    The author took up his abode in a lofty house which had been allotted  to him, on the 1st Muharram (May 1, 1443)    \"One day some messengers sent from the palace of the king came  to see me, and at the close of the same day I presented myself at  court.... The prince was seated in a hall, surrounded by the most  imposing attributes of state. Right and left of him stood a numerous  crowd of men arranged in a circle. The king was dressed in a robe of  green satin, around his neck he wore a collar, composed of pearls of  beautiful water, and other splendid gems. He had an olive complexion,  his frame was thin, and he was rather tall; on his cheeks might be"]]]
