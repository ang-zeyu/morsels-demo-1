The blanket looked as if it were  over a heap of bricks.    \"I don't see him breathing any,\" she said anxiously.    \"Yes, he breathes,\" said Mrs. Tellamantez, not lifting her eyes.    It seemed to Thea that they waited for hours. At last they heard voices,  and a party of men came down the hill and up the gulch. Dr. Archie and  Fritz Kohler came first; behind were Johnny and Ray, and several men  from the roundhouse. Ray had the canvas litter that was kept at the  depot for accidents on the road. Behind them trailed half a dozen boys  who had been hanging round the depot.    When Ray saw Thea, he dropped his canvas roll and hurried forward.  \"Better run along home, Thee. This is ugly business.\" Ray was indignant  that anybody who gave Thea music lessons should behave in such a manner.    Thea resented both his proprietary tone and his superior virtue. \"I  won't. I want to know how bad he is. I'm not a baby!\" she exclaimed  indignantly, stamping her foot into the sand.    Dr. Archie, who had been kneeling by the blanket, got up and came toward  Thea, dusting his knees. He smiled and nodded confidentially. \"He'll be  all right when we get him home. But he wouldn't want you to see him like  this, poor old chap! Understand? Now, skip!\"    Thea ran down the gulch and looked back only once, to see them lifting  the canvas litter with Wunsch upon it, still covered with the blanket.    The men carried Wunsch up the hill and down the road to the Kohlers'.  Mrs. Kohler had gone home and made up a bed in the sitting-room, as she  knew the litter could not be got round the turn in the narrow stairway.  Wunsch was like a dead man. He lay unconscious all day. Ray Kennedy  stayed with him till two o'clock in the afternoon, when he had to go out  on his run. It was the first time he had ever been inside the Kohlers'  house, and he was so much impressed by Napoleon that the piece-picture  formed a new bond between him and Thea.    Dr. Archie went back at six o'clock, and found Mrs. Kohler and Spanish  Johnny with Wunsch, who was in a high fever, muttering and groaning.    \"There ought to be some one here to look after him to-night, Mrs.  Kohler,\" he said. \"I'm on a confinement case, and I can't be here, but  there ought to be somebody. He may get violent.\"    Mrs. Kohler insisted that she could always do anything with Wunsch, but  the doctor shook his head and Spanish Johnny grinned. He said he would  stay. The doctor laughed at him. \"Ten fellows like you couldn't hold  him, Spanish, if he got obstreperous; an Irishman would have his hands  full. Guess I'd better put the soft pedal on him.\" He pulled out his  hypodermic.    Spanish Johnny stayed, however, and the Kohlers went to bed. At about  two o'clock in the morning Wunsch rose from his ignominious cot. Johnny,  who was dozing on the lounge, awoke to find the German standing in the  middle of the room in his undershirt and drawers, his arms bare, his  heavy body seeming twice its natural girth. His face was snarling and  savage, and his eyes were crazy. He had risen to avenge himself, to wipe  out his shame, to destroy his enemy. One look was enough for Johnny.  Wunsch raised a chair threateningly, and Johnny, with the lightness of a  PICADOR, darted under the missile and out of the open window. He shot  across the gully to get help, meanwhile leaving the Kohlers to their  fate.    Fritz, upstairs, heard the chair crash upon the stove. Then he heard  doors opening and shutting, and some one stumbling about in the  shrubbery of the garden. He and Paulina sat up in bed and held a  consultation. Fritz slipped from under the covers, and going cautiously  over to the window, poked out his head. Then he rushed to the door and  bolted it.    \"MEIN GOTT, Paulina,\" he gasped, \"he has the axe, he will kill us!\"    \"The dresser,\" cried Mrs. Kohler; \"push the dresser before the door.  ACH, if you had your rabbit gun, now!\"    \"It is in the barn,\" said Fritz sadly. \"It would do no good; he would  not be afraid of anything now. Stay you in the bed, Paulina.\" The  dresser had lost its casters years ago, but he managed to drag it in  front of the door. \"He is in the garden. He makes nothing. He will get  sick again, may-be.\"    Fritz went back to bed and his wife pulled the quilt over him and made  him lie down. They heard stumbling in the garden again, then a smash of  glass.    \"ACH, DAS MISTBEET!\" gasped Paulina, hearing her hotbed shivered. \"The  poor soul, Fritz, he will cut himself. ACH! what is that?\" They both sat  up in bed. \"WIEDER! ACH, What is he doing?\"    The noise came steadily, a sound of chopping. Paulina tore off her  night-cap. \"DIE BAUME, DIE BAUME! He is cutting our trees, Fritz!\" Before  her husband could prevent her, she had sprung from the bed and rushed to  the window. \"DER TAUBENSCHLAG! GERECHTER HIMMEL, he is chopping the  dove-house down!\"    Fritz reached her side before she had got her breath again, and poked  his head out beside hers. There, in the faint starlight, they saw a  bulky man, barefoot, half dressed, chopping away at the white post that  formed the pedestal of the dove-house. The startled pigeons were  croaking and flying about his head, even beating their wings in his  face, so that he struck at them furiously with the axe. In a few seconds  there was a crash, and Wunsch had actually felled the dove-house.    \"Oh, if only it is not the trees next!\" prayed Paulina. \"The dove-house  you can make new again, but not DIE BAUME.\"    They watched breathlessly. In the garden below Wunsch stood in the  attitude of a woodman, contemplating the fallen cote. Suddenly he threw  the axe over his shoulder and went out of the front gate toward the  town.    \"The poor soul, he will meet his death!\" Mrs. Kohler wailed. She ran  back to her feather bed and hid her face in the pillow.    Fritz kept watch at the window. \"No, no, Paulina,\" he called presently;  \"I see lanterns coming. Johnny must have gone for somebody. Yes, four  lanterns, coming along the gulch. They stop; they must have seen him  already. Now they are under the hill and I cannot see them, but I think  they have him. They will bring him back. I must dress and go down.\" He  caught his trousers and began pulling them on by the window. \"Yes, here  they come, half a dozen men. And they have tied him with a rope,  Paulina!\"    \"ACH, the poor man! To be led like a cow,\" groaned Mrs. Kohler. \"Oh, it  is good that he has no wife!\" She was reproaching herself for nagging  Fritz when he drank himself into foolish pleasantry or mild sulks, and  felt that she had never before appreciated her blessings.      Wunsch was in bed for ten days, during which time he was gossiped about  and even preached about in Moonstone. The Baptist preacher took a shot  at the fallen man from his pulpit, Mrs. Livery Johnson nodding  approvingly from her pew. The mothers of Wunsch's pupils sent him notes  informing him that their daughters would discontinue their  music-lessons. The old maid who had rented him her piano sent the town  dray for her contaminated instrument, and ever afterward declared that  Wunsch had ruined its tone and scarred its glossy finish. The Kohlers  were unremitting in their kindness to their friend. Mrs. Kohler made him  soups and broths without stint, and Fritz repaired the dove-house and  mounted it on a new post, lest it might be a sad reminder.    As soon as Wunsch was strong enough to sit about in his slippers and  wadded jacket, he told Fritz to bring him some stout thread from the  shop. When Fritz asked what he was going to sew, he produced the  tattered score of \"Orpheus\" and said he would like to fix it up for a  little present. Fritz carried it over to the shop and stitched it into  pasteboards, covered with dark suiting-cloth. Over the stitches he glued  a strip of thin red leather which he got from his friend, the  harness-maker. After Paulina had cleaned the pages with fresh bread,  Wunsch was amazed to see what a fine book he had. It opened stiffly, but  that was no matter.    Sitting in the arbor one morning, under the ripe grapes and the brown,  curling leaves, with a pen and ink on the bench beside him and the Gluck  score on his knee, Wunsch pondered for a long while. Several times he  dipped the pen in the ink, and then put it back again in the cigar box  in which Mrs. Kohler kept her writing utensils. His thoughts wandered  over a wide territory; over many countries and many years. There was no  order or logical sequence in his ideas. Pictures came and went without  reason. Faces, mountains, rivers, autumn days in other vineyards far  away. He thought of a FUSZREISE he had made through the Hartz Mountains  in his student days; of the innkeeper's pretty daughter who had lighted  his pipe for him in the garden one summer evening, of the woods above  Wiesbaden, haymakers on an island in the river. The roundhouse whistle  woke him from his reveries. Ah, yes, he was in Moonstone, Colorado. He  frowned for a moment and looked at the book on his knee. He had thought  of a great many appropriate things to write in it, but suddenly he  rejected all of them, opened the book, and at the top of the  much-engraved title-page he wrote rapidly in purple ink:--         EINST, O WUNDER!--         A. WUNSCH.       MOONSTONE, COLO.       SEPTEMBER 30, 18--      Nobody in Moonstone ever found what Wunsch's first name was. That \"A\"  may have stood for Adam, or August, or even Amadeus; he got very angry  if any one asked him.    He remained A. Wunsch to the end of his chapter there. When he presented  this score to Thea, he told her that in ten years she would either know  what the inscription meant, or she would not have the least idea, in  which case it would not matter.    When Wunsch began to pack his trunk, both the Kohlers were very unhappy.  He said he was coming back some day, but that for the present, since he  had lost all his pupils, it would be better for him to try some \"new  town.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44114"],[0,"A Jay of Italy (#17)"],[1,"sky.  Jacopo, it is a sweet and fearful thing to be chosen minister of  one of His purifications--Noah, and Lot, and now thy prince.'    'Purification?' said the executioner: 'by what?'    'By love, thou fool!' whispered Galeazzo, half ecstatic, half furious,  with a nervous glance about him.  'There were the purifications by water  one, one by fire, and a third by blood, to the last of which His  servants yet testify in the spirit of their Redeemer.  Blood, Jacopo,  thou little monster--blood flowing, streams of it, the visible token of  the sacrifice.  That was our task till yesterday.  Now in the end comes  Love, and calleth for a cleansed and fruitful soil.  Let us hasten with  the last tares--to cut them down, and let their blood consummate the  fertilising.  Quick: we have no time to lose.'    He flung himself from the statue, and tiptoed, in a sort of gloating  rapture, to the door.    'Show me this tare, I say.'    He went down the tower a few paces, with assured steps, then, bethinking  himself, beckoned the other to lead.  The flight conducted them to a  private postern, well secured and guarded inside and out.  As they  issued from this, the howl of blown rain met and staggered them. Looking  up at the blackened sky from the depths of that well of masonry, it  seemed to crack and split in a rush of fusing stars.  The mad soul of  the tyrant leapt to speed the chase.  He was one with this mighty  demonstration--as like a chosen instrument of the divine retribution.  His brain danced and flickered with exquisite visions of power.  He was  an angel, a destroying angel, commissioned to purge the world of lies.  'Bring me to this monk!' he screamed through the thunder.    Deep in the foundations of the north-eastern tower the miserable  creature was embedded, in a stone chamber as utterly void and empty as  despair.  The walls, the floor, the roof, were all chiselled as smooth  as glass.  There was not anywhere foothold for a cat--nor door, nor  trap, nor egress, nor window of any kind, save where, just under the  ceiling, the grated opening by which he had been lowered let in by day a  haggard ghost of light.  And even that wretched solace was withdrawn as  night fell--became a phantom, a diluted whisp of memory, sank like water  into the blackness, and left the fancy suddenly naked in  self-consciousness of hell.  Then Capello screamed, and threw himself  towards the last flitting of that spectre.  He fell and bruised his  limbs horribly: the very pain was a saving occupation.  He struck his  skull, and revelled in the agonised dance of lights the blow procured  him.  But one by one they blew out; and in a moment dead negation had  him by the throat again, rolling him over and over, choking him under  enormous slabs of darkness.  Now, gasping, he cursed his improvidence in  not having glued his vision to the place of the light's going.  It would  have been something gained from madness to hold and gloat upon it, to  watch hour by hour for its feeble re-dawn. Among all the spawning  monstrosities of that pit, with only the assured prospect of a lingering  death before him, the prodigy of eternal darkness quite overcrowed that  other of thirst and famine.    Yet the dawn broke, it would seem, before its due. Had he annihilated  time, and was this death?  He rose rapturously to his feet, and stood  staring at the grating, the tears gushing down his fallen cheeks.  The  bars were withdrawn; and in their place was a lamp intruded, and a face  looked down.    'Capello, dost thou hunger and thirst?'    The voice awoke him to life, and to the knowledge of who out of all the  world could be thus addressing him.  He answered, quaveringly: 'I hunger  and thirst, Galeazzo.'    'It is a beatitude, monk,' said the voice.  'Thou shalt have thy fill of  justice.'    'Alas!' cried the prisoner: 'justice is with thee, I fear, an empty  phrase.'    'Comfort thyself,' said the other: 'I shall make a full measure of it.  It shall bubble and sparkle to the brim like a great goblet of Malmsey.  Dost know the wine Malmsey, monk?--a cool, heady, fragrant liquid, that  gurgles down the arid throat, making one o' hot days think of gushing  weirs, and the green of grass under naked feet.'    The monk fell on his knees, stretching out his arms.    'I ask no mercy of thee, but to end me without torture.'    'Torture, quotha!' cried the fiend above--'what torture in the vision of  a wine-cup crushed, or, for the matter of that, a feast on white tables  under trees. Picture it, Capello: the quails in cold jelly; the melting  pasties; the salmon-trout tucked under blankets of whipped cream; the  luscious peaches, and apricots like maiden's cheeks.  Why, art not a  Conventual, man, and rich in such experiences of the belly?  And to call  'em torture--fie!'    'Mercy!' gasped the monk.  His swollen throat could hardly shape the  word.  Galeazzo laughed, and bent over.    'Answer, then: how long am I to live?'    'By justice, for ever.'    'What! live for ever on an empty phrase?  Then art thou, too,  provisioned for eternity.'    He held out his hand:--    'Art humbled at last, monk, or monkey?  How much for a nut?'    Leaping at the mad thought of some relenting in the voice and question,  the prisoner ran under the outstretched hand, and held up his own,  abjectly, fulsomely.    'Master, give it me--one--one only, to dull this living agony!'    'A sop to thee, then,' cried Galeazzo, and dropped a chestnut.  The monk  caught it, and, cracking it between his teeth, roared out and fell  spitting and sputtering.  He had crunched upon nothing more savoury than  a shell filled up with river slime.  The Duke screamed and hopped with  laughter.    'Is not that richer than quail, more refreshing than Malmsey?'    The monk fell on his knees:--    'Now hear me, God!' he gabbled awry: 'Let not this man ever again know  surcease from torment, in bed, at board, in his body, or in his mind.  Let his lust consummate in frostbite; let the worm burrow in his  entrails, and the maggot in his brain.  May his drink be salt, and his  meat bitter as aloes.  May his short lease of wicked life be cancelled,  and death seize him, and damnation wither in the moment of his supreme  impenitence. Darken his vision, so that for evermore it shall see  despair and the mockery of fruitless hope.  Let him walk a  self-conscious leper in the sunshine, and strive vainly to propitiate  the loathing in eyes in which he sees himself reflected an abhorred and  filthy ape.  May the curse of Assisi----'    Galeazzo screamed him down:--    'Quote him not--beast--vile apostate from his teaching!'    For a moment the two battled in a war of screeching blasphemy: the next,  the grate was flung into place, the light whisked and vanished, a door  slammed, and the blackness of the cell closed once more upon the moaning  heap in its midst.    Quaking and ashen, babbling oaths and prayers, Galeazzo flung back to  his closet.    'Bring wine!' he shook out between his teeth to Jacopo.    When it came, he tasted, and flung it from him.    'Salt!' he shrieked.  His fancy quite overcrowed his reason.  'O God, I  am poisoned!'    He rose, staggering, and entered his oratory, and cast himself on his  knees before the little shrine.    'Not from this man,' he protested, whimpering and writhing; 'Lord, not  from this man--I know him better than Thou--a recusant, a sorcerer!  Be  not deceived because of his calling.  To curse Thine anointed! kill him,  Lord--kill the blasphemer--I hold him ready to Thy hand!  Good sweet St.  Francis, I but weed thy pastures--a wicked false brother, tainting the  fold.  How shall love prevail, this poison at its root?--Poison!  O my  God, to be stricken for evermore! life's fruit to change to choking  ashes in my mouth!  It cannot be--I, Galeazzo the Duke--yet I taunted  him with visions: what if I have caught the infection of mine own  imagination--too fearful, spare me this once.  Lord God, consider--as I  put it to Thee--now--like this--listen.  To starve with him should be  but a fast enlarged.  What then?  Some, honest ascetics, no Conventuals,  so push abstinence to ecstasy as that they may cross the lines of death  in a dream, and wake without a pang to heaven gained.  If he does not,  should he suffer, he is properly condemned for a gross pampered brother,  false to his vows, unworthy Thine advocacy.  Now, call the test a fair  one.  Chain back this dog that ravens to tear me.  How, so stricken,  made corrupt, could I work Thy will but through corruption? Hush!  Thou  mean'st it not--only as a jest?  Give me some sign, then.  Ah!  Thou  laugh'st--very quietly, but I hear Thee.  Canst not deceive  Galeazzo--ha-ha! between me and You, Lord, between me and You! Silence,  thou dog monk!  What dost thou here? Escaped! by God, get back--the  first word was mine--thou art too late.  What! damnation seize thee!  Lord! he scorns Thy judgment--catch him, hold him--he is there by the  door!'    He sprang to his feet, glaring and gesticulating.    'Galeazzo!' exclaimed Bembo.  The boy had mounted to the closet unheard.  It was his privilege to come unannounced.  He stood a moment regarding  the madman in amazement and pity, then hurried softly to his side.    'What is it?  The face again?'    His tone, his entreaty, dispelled the other's delirium. The tyrant gazed  at him a minute, slow recognition dawning in his eyes; then, of a  sudden, broke into a thick fast flurry of sobs, and cast himself upon  his shoulder.    'My saint,' he wept adoringly--'my Conscience, my little angel! and I  had thought thee--nay, but the sign for which I prayed art thou given.'    His emotion gushed inwardly, filling all his channels to gasping.  Presently he looked up, with a passionate murmur and caress.    'Love, with thy red lips like a girl's!  Would that my own were worthy  to marry with them.'    Bembo withdrew a little:--    'What wild words are these?  Yet, peradventure,"]]]
