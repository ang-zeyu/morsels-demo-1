A small quantity of leeks finely shred and well mixed, is a great  improvement.--A superior article may be made as follows: boil a quart of  half-grits in as much milk as will swell them to the utmost, drain them  and add a quart of blood, a pint of rich cream, a pound of suet, some  mace, nutmeg, allspice, and four cloves, all in fine powder. And two  pounds of hog's leaf cut into dice, two leeks, a handful of parsley, ten  leaves of sage, a large handful of pennyroyal, and a sprig of thyme and  knotted marjoram, all finely minced; eight eggs well beaten, half a  pound of bread crumbs scalded in a pint of milk, with pepper and salt.  Soak and clean the skins in several waters, last of all in rose-water,  and half fill them with the stuffing. Tie the skins in links, boil and  prick them with a clean fork, to prevent their breaking, and cover them  with a clean cloth till cold.      BLACKBERRY JAM. Put some red, but not ripe, blackberries into a jar, and  cover it up closely. Set the jar in a kettle or deep stewpan of water  over the fire, as a water bath; and when it has simmered five or six  hours, force the juice through a sieve. To every pint of juice, add two  pounds of powdered loaf-sugar, boiling and scumming it in the same  manner as for any other jam or jelly. This simple article is said to  afford effectual relief in cases of stone or gravel: a tea-spoonful to  be taken every night, and repeated in the morning, if necessary. A good  jam may also be made of ripe blackberries, in a similar manner; and  both, like other jams, should be kept in jars, closely tied over with  brandy paper.      BLACKBERRY WINE. Pick and clean a quantity of ripe blackberries; to  every quart of fruit, add a quart of cold water which has first been  boiled. Bruise them well, and let the whole stand twenty-four hours,  stirring it occasionally during that time. Express all the juice and run  it through a sieve or jelly bag, on a pound and a half of sugar to each  gallon of liquid. Stir it till thoroughly dissolved, put it in a well  seasoned barrel, add a little dissolved isinglass, and let it remain  open till the next day; then bung it up. This makes a pleasant wine,  which may be bottled off in about two months.      BLACKING for shoes is made of four ounces of ivory black, three ounces  of the coarsest sugar, a table-spoonful of sweet oil, and a pint of  small beer, gradually mixed together cold.      BLACKING BALLS. Portable shoe-blacking, in the form of cakes or balls,  is made in the following manner. Take four ounces of mutton suet, one  ounce of bees-wax, one of sweet oil, and a dram each of powdered  sugar-candy and gum-arabac. Melt them well together over a slow fire;  add a spoonful of turpentine, and lamp-black sufficient to give it a  good black colour. While hot enough to run, make the composition into a  ball, by pouring it into a tin mould; or let it stand till nearly cold,  and then it may be moulded into any form by the hand.      BLADE-BONE OF PORK. Cut it from the bacon-hog, with a small quantity of  meat upon it, and lay it on the gridiron. When nearly done pepper and  salt it. Add a piece of butter, and a tea-spoonful of mustard; and serve  it up quickly. This dish is much admired in Somersetshire. A blade-bone  of mutton may be dressed in the same way.      BLAMANGE. Boil two ounces of isinglass half an hour, in a pint and half  of water, and strain off the cream. Sweeten it, and add some peach  water, or a few bitter almonds; let it boil up once, and put it into  what forms you please. Be sure to let the blamange settle before you  turn it into the forms, or the blacks will remain at the bottom of them,  and be on the top of the blamange when taken out of the moulds. If not  to be very stiff, a little less isinglass will do.--For Yellow Blamange,  pour a pint of boiling water upon an ounce of isinglass, and the peel of  one lemon. When cold, sweeten with two ounces of fine sugar: add a  quarter of a pint of white wine, the yolks of four eggs, and the juice  of one lemon. Stir all together, and let it boil five minutes: strain  through a bag, and put into cups.      BLANKETS, if not in constant use, are liable to be moth-eaten. To  prevent this, they should be folded and laid under feather beds that are  in use, and occasionally shaken. When soiled, they should be washed, not  scoured: and well dried before they are laid by, or they will breed  moths.      BLEACHING OF STRAW. This is generally done by the fumes of sulphur, in a  place enclosed for that purpose: but to render the straw very white, and  encrease its flexibility in platting, it should be dipped in a solution  of oxygenated muriatic acid, saturated with potash. Oxygenated muriate  of lime will also answer the purpose. To repair straw bonnets, they must  be carefully ripped to pieces; the plat should be bleached with the  above solution, and made up afresh.      BLUE INK. Dissolve an ounce of finely powdered verdigris, and half an  ounce of cream of tartar, in three ounces of water. This will make a  fine blue writing ink, which has the singular property of giving to an  iron nail, immersed in it for twenty-four hours, a beautiful green  colour.      BOARDED FLOORS will preserve a beautiful appearance, if treated in the  following manner. After washing them very clean with soda and warm  water, and a brush, wash them with a large sponge and clean water,  observing that no spot be left untouched. Be careful to clean straight  up and down, not crossing from board to board: then dry with clean  cloths, rubbing hard up and down the same way. The floors should not be  often wetted, but very thoroughly when done; and once a week dry-rubbed  with hot sand, and a heavy brush, the right way of the boards. If oil or  grease have stained the floor, make a strong lye of pearl-ashes and soft  water, and add as much unslaked lime as it will take up. Stir it  together, and then let it settle a few minutes; bottle it, and stop it  close. When used, lower it with a little water, and scour the part with  it. If the liquor lie long on the boards, it will extract their colour;  it must therefore be done with care and expedition. Stone work may be  freed from stains in the same way.      BOCKINGS. Mix three ounces of buck-wheat flour with a tea-cupful of warm  milk, and a spoonful of yeast. Let it rise before the fire about an  hour; then mix four eggs well beaten, and as much milk as will make the  batter the usual thickness for pancakes, and fry them in the same  manner.      BOILING. Cleanliness here is of great consequence; and for this purpose  all culinary vessels should be made of iron, or of other metals well  tinned. The pernicious effects of copper or brass may be perceived by  rubbing the hand round the inside of a pot or kettle made of either of  those metals, and which has been scoured clean and fit for use; for  though it may not discolour the hand, yet it will cause an offensive  smell, and must in some degree affect every article which is put into  it. If copper or brass be used, they should be well cleaned, and nothing  suffered to remain in the vessels longer than is necessary for the  purposes of cooking. In small families however, block-tin saucepans and  boilers are much to be preferred, as lightest and safest. If proper care  be taken of them, and they are well dried after being cleaned, they are  also by far the cheapest; the purchase of a new tin saucepan being  little more than the expense of tinning a copper one. Care should be  taken to have the covers of boiling pots fit close, not only to prevent  an unnecessary evaporation of the water, but that the smoke may not  insinuate itself under the edge of the lid, and give the meat a bad  taste. A trivet or fish drainer placed in the boiler to lay the meat on,  and to raise it an inch and a half from the bottom, will prevent that  side of it which comes next the bottom from being done too much, and the  lower part of the meat will be as delicately done as any other. Instead  of a trivet, four skewers stuck into the meat transversely will answer  the purpose, or a soup plate whelmed the wrong side upwards. With good  management it will take less fire for boiling than for roasting, but it  should be kept to a regular pitch, so as to keep the pot gently boiling  all the time. If it boils too fast, it will harden the meat, by  extracting too much of the gravy; but if it be allowed to simmer only,  or to boil gently, it will become rich and tender. The scum must be  carefully taken off as soon as the water boils, or it will sink and  discolour the meat. The oftener it is scummed, and the cleaner the top  of the water is kept, the cleaner will be the meat; and if a little cold  water be occasionally thrown in, it will bring up the remainder of the  scum to the surface. Neither mixing milk with the water nor wrapping up  the meat in a cloth are necessary, if the scum be attentively removed;  and the meat will have a more delicate colour, and a finer flavour, if  boiled in clear water only. The general rule for boiling is to allow a  quarter of an hour to a pound of meat; but if it be boiled gently or  simmered only, which is by far the superior way, twenty minutes to the  pound will scarcely be found too much. At the same time care must be  taken to keep the pot constantly boiling, and not to suffer the meat to  remain in after it is done enough, or it will become sodden, and lose  its flavour. The quantity of water is regulated by the size of the meat;  sufficient to cover it, but not to drown it; and the less water, the  more savoury will the meat be, and the better the broth. It is usual to  put all kinds of fresh meat into hot water, and salt meat into cold  water; but if the meat has been salted only a short time it is better to  put it in when the water boils, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29086"],[0,"The Mushroom, Edible and Otherwise (#17)"],[1," colored like the pileus. The spores  are elliptical, .0002 to .00025 inch long, .00012 to .00016 broad.  _Peck._    It is found on mossy ground in woods. I have found them under pine trees  on Cemetery Hill. Dr. Peck says he separated this species from C.  ditopoda because of the \"striate margin of the pileus, paler gills,  longer stem, and elliptical spores.\" The plant is edible. September and  October.      _Clitocybe ditopoda. Fr._    Ditopoda is from two Greek words, _di-totos_, living in two places, and  _pus_ or _poda_, foot, having reference to the stem being central at  times and again eccentric.    The pileus is rather fleshy, convex, then plane, depressed, even,  smooth, hygrophanous.    The gills are adnate, crowded, thin, dark, cinereous.    The stem is hollow, equal, almost naked.    This species resembles in appearance C. metachroa but can be separated  by the mild taste and farinaceous odor. Its favorite habit is on pine  needles. August and September. I found this species in various places  about Chillicothe and on Thanksgiving day I found it in a mixed wood in  Gallia County, Ohio, along with Hygrophorus laurae and Tricholoma  maculatescens. I sent some specimens to Dr. Herbst, who pronounced it C.  ditopoda.      _Clitocybe pithyophila. Fr._    THE PINE-LOVING CLITOCYBE.    [Illustration: Figure 73.--Clitocybe pithyophila. Two-thirds natural  size. Cap white and showing the pine needles upon which they grow.]    Pithyophila means pine-loving. This plant is very abundant under pine  trees on Cemetery Hill. They grow on the bed of pine needles. The pileus  is very variable in size, white, one to two inches broad; fleshy, thin,  becoming plane, umbonate, smooth, growing pale, at length irregularly  shaped, repand, wavy, sometimes slightly striate.    The stem is hollow, terete, then compressed, smooth, equal, even, downy  at the base.    The gills are adnate, somewhat decurrent, crowded, plane, always white.  The spores are 6-7x4u. The plants in Figure 73 are small, having been  found during the cold weather in November. They are said to be good, but  I have not eaten them.      _Clitocybe candicans. Fr._    Candicans, whitish or shining white. Pileus is one inch broad, entirely  white, somewhat fleshy, convex, then plane, or depressed, even, shining,  with regularly deflexed margin.    The gills are adnate, crowded, thin, at length decurrent, narrow.    The stem is nearly hollow, even, waxy, shining, nearly equal,  cartilaginous, smooth, incurved at the base. The spores are broadly  elliptical, or subglobose, 5-6x4u. Found in damp woods on leaves.      _Clitocybe obbata. Fr._    THE BEAKER-SHAPED CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.    Obbata means shaped like an obba or beaker.    The pileus is somewhat membranaceous, umbilicate, then rather deeply  depressed, smooth, inclined to be hygrophanous, sooty-brown, margin at  length striate.    The gills are decurrent, distant, grayish-white, pruinose.    The stem is hollow, grayish-brown, smooth, equal, rather tough.    I found plants growing on Cemetery Hill under pine trees. I had some  trouble to identify the species until Prof. Atkinson helped me out.  August to September.      _Clitocybe gilva. Pers._    THE YELLOW CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.    Gilva means pale yellow or reddish yellow.    The pileus is two to four inches broad, fleshy, compact, soon depressed  and wavy, smooth, moist, dingy ocher, flesh same color, sometimes  spotted, margin involute.    The gills are decurrent, closely crowded, thin, sometimes branched,  narrow but broader in the middle, ochraceous yellow.    The stem is two to three inches long, solid, smooth, nearly equal,  somewhat paler than the cap, and inclined to be villous at the base.    The spores are nearly globose, 4-5u.    This plant is sometimes found in mixed woods, but it seems to prefer  pine trees. It has a wide distribution, found in the east and south as  well as the west. I have found it in several localities in Ohio. Found  from July to September.      _Clitocybe flaccida. Sow._    THE LIMP CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 74.--Clitocybe flaccida. One-half natural size.]    Flaccida means flabby, limp.    The pileus is two to three inches broad, rather fleshy, thin, limp,  umbilicate, then funnel-shaped, even, smooth, sometimes cracking into  minute scales, tawny or rust-colored, margin broadly reflexed.    The gills are strongly decurrent, yellowish, to whitish, close, arcuate.    The stem is tufted, unequal, rusty, somewhat wavy, tough, naked, villous  at the base. The spores are globose or nearly so, 4-5x3-4u.    This resembles the C. infundibuliformis very closely, both in its  appearance and its habit. It grows among leaves in mixed woods during  wet weather. It is gregarious, often many stems growing from one mass of  mycelium. The plants in Figure 74 were collected in Ackerman's woods  near Columbus, Ohio, and were photographed by Dr. Kellerman. They are  found on all the hillsides about Chillicothe. Found from July to late in  October.      _Clitocybe monadelpha. Morg._    THE ONE-BROTHERHOOD CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._    Plate XII. Figure 75.--Clitocybe monadelpha.]    Monadelpha is from _monos_, one and _adelphos_, brother.    Prof. Morgan of Preston, Ohio, gives the following description of the  One-Brotherhood Clitocybe in the Mycological Flora of the Miama Valley:  \"Densely cespitose. Pileus fleshy, convex, then depressed, at first  glabrous, then scaly, honey-colored, varying to pallid-brown or reddish.  The stem elongated, solid, crooked, twisted, fibrous, tapering at the  base, pallid-brownish or flesh color. Spores white, a little irregular,  .0055MM.\"    It might be easily taken for the ringless Armillaria mellea, but the  decidedly decurrent gills and the solid stem ought to set any one right.  In very wet weather it soon becomes water-soaked, and is then not good.  It is found in woods about stumps, and in newly cleared fields about  roots or stumps. From spring to October. See Plate XII, Figure 75, for  an illustration. Bresadola of Europe has determined this to be the same  as that described by Scoparius in 1772 as Agaricus (Clitocybe)  tabescens. I have preferred to retain the name given by Prof. Morgan.      _Clitocybe dealbata. Sow._    THE WHITE CLYTOCYBE. EDIBLE.    Dealbata means whitewashed; so called from its white color.    The pileus is about one inch broad, rather fleshy, convex, then plane,  upturned and wavy, smooth, shining, even.    The gills are crowded, white, attached to the stem.    The stem is fibrous, thin, equal, stuffed. Spores are 4-5x2.5u.    This is a beautiful plant and widely distributed. Found among leaves and  sometimes in the grass. It makes a delicious dish.      _Clitocybe phyllophila. Fr._    THE LEAF-LOVING CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.    Phyllophila means leaf and fond of. It is so called because it is found  on leaves in the woods during wet weather.    The pileus is one and a half to three inches in diameter, whitish-tan,  rather fleshy, convex, then plane, at length depressed, even, dry,  noticeably white around the margin.    The gills are attached to the stem, decurrent especially after the cap  is depressed, somewhat distant, rather broad, white, becoming yellowish  or ocher tinged, thin.    The stem is two to three inches long, stuffed, becoming hollow, silky,  rather tough, whitish. The spores are elliptical., 6x4u.    The whitish-tan cap with its white, silvery zone near the margin will  serve to identify the species. August to October.      _Clitocybe cyathiformis. Bull._    THE CUP-SHAPED CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.    Cyathiformis is from _cyathus_, a drinking cup; _formis_, form or shape.    The pileus is two to three inches broad, fleshy, rather thin; at first  depressed, then funnel-shaped; even, smooth, moist, hygrophanous; the  margin involute, sooty or dark brown when moist, becoming pale when dry,  often dingy ochraceous or tan-color, inclined to be wavy.    The gills are attached to the stem, decurrent from the depressed form of  the pileus, united behind, somewhat dingy, sparingly branched.    The stem is stuffed, elastic, tapering upward, fibrillose, base villous.  The spores are elliptical, 9x6u.    This plant has a wide distribution and is found in woods or wood  margins. I found some very fine specimens on Ralston's Run, near  Chillicothe. September to October.      _Clitocybe laccata. Scop._    WAXY CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 76.--Clitocybe laccata. Two-thirds natural size.  Caps violet or reddish-brown. Gills broad and distant.]    Laccata means made of shellac or sealing-wax. This is a very common,  variable plant. Sometimes of a bright amethyst but usually of a reddish  brown. The pileus is from one to two inches broad, almost membranaceous,  convex, then plane, depressed in the center, downy with short hairs,  violet or reddish-brown.    The gills are broad, distant, attached to the stem by the entire width;  pale fleshy-red in hue which is more constant than the color of the cap  and which forms an ear-mark to tell the species; adnate with a decurrent  tooth, plane, the white spores being very abundant.    The stem is tough, fibrous, stuffed, crooked, white-villous at the base,  rather long and slender, dull reddish yellow or reddish-flesh-colored,  sometimes pallid or dull ochraceous, slightly striate; when the season  is wet it is often watery.    This waxy Clitocybe has a wide range and is frequently very abundant. It  is found through almost the entire season. It will grow almost anywhere,  in woods, pastures, and lawns, and sometimes on naked ground. The plants  in Figure 76 were found in tall grass in a grove in August. Those in  Figure 77 were found the last of November on Cemetery Hill, under pine  trees.    [Illustration: Figure 77.--Clitocybe laccata. Two-thirds natural size.  Specimens growing late in the fall.]    Prof. Peck gives the following varieties:    Var. amethystina--in which "]]]
