He ragged me about how fine  his potatoes were. He told me to gather the potatoes under my vines for  the house, but not to disturb his potatoes. For several days, the family  ate potatoes from my vines, then I gathered up the potatoes left. I got  five or six wheelbarrows full. I then dug his potatoes and got a little  more than one wheelbarrow full. He told me to plant the garden when I  thought the time was right, and not to say anything to him about when  and what to plant. I always had plenty of vegetables for his family.\"          Easter Lockhart          *Interview with Easter Lockhart (80)*      *322 Hill Street, Gaffney, S.C.*      --_Caldwell Sims, Union, S.C._    \"Folks thinks that I was born round Easter, but that ain't so. March the  9th is what they always told me. The year I cannot recollect hearing,  but by my count that I keep I am running close to eighty years. White  folks give me my age to keep when I married, and I have kept it ever  since, so I cannot be far wrong.    \"It was the chief of police's grandpa that I knew and it was off his  place that my old man come from. I was born Easter Norris and I married  Nathan Lockhart when I was young, maybe fifteen, ain't sure about that.  He was a little older than me. In slavery I was born and my mother was  sold while I was a very young child, so they say. We then lived with Mr.  Clayton Clark. Freedom broke when I was around thirteen, and we then  went back to the Lockhart Plantation. There is where I nursed Henry, a  little baby. He is now the chief of police. Miss Bessie, his mother, had  me to clean up her yards for her.    \"Miss Bessie fixed me up to be baptized at the Limestone Baptist church.  It was then near Johnson Street and across from where Central school now  stands. It was a Negro church. We had to go to the spring pond called  Austin's Pond where all the baptizing took place in those days. Mr.  Austin had a mill there run by a big water wheel. The white folks  carried on their baptizing there, too. The first warm Sunday in May was  when I was baptized.    \"All Saturday I prayed and Miss Bessie told me what I was going to do,  and read to me from the Bible about baptizing and about John the Baptist  baptizing Christ. Yes sir, the Bible say Christ went down in the water,  in the waters of Jordan. Miss Bessie was telling my ma how to fix my  clothes while she was reading the Bible to me. All my clothes was white  but my shoes. In those days they did not have white shoes. I wore white  cotton stockings. I had a white dress to wear to the pond and I took two  pairs of white stockings. A crowd was to be baptized at 2:30 o'clock  that evening. The sun was good and hot. I went with my folks. Miss  Bessie went and all the white folks went to see their Negroes go under.    \"The dress I wore to the baptizing was starched so stiff it stood out. I  wore a white handkerchief over my head that Miss Bessie give me. On top  of that I had a white bonnet that had frills and tucks all over it. When  we got there the banks of Austin's Pond was lined with Negroes shouting  and singing glory and praises. They sang all the songs they could think  of and the preacher lined out songs to them. The people to be baptized  congregated before the preacher, and he told them what to do. Then we  went in and put on the clothes we was to go under in.    \"I had a long white gown gathered from my shoulders and it had a big  kind of sleeves. On my head I wore a white cap and kept on my white  stockings, but I pulled off my black shoes. Never had no white shoes  that I know of way back then. I felt so good that I seemed to walk real  light. While we were getting in our baptizing clothes we shouted praises  as the people on the banks sang. Some of us jumped up. When my time come  I started to the pond and just before the preacher turned to take my  hand, I shouted 'Lord have Mercy' and clapped my hands over my head.  Somebody said, 'Dat child sho is gitting a new soul'.    \"Down in the water I went. First it hit my ankles and then I felt the  hem of my skirts getting wet. I looked down and my gown was floating on  top the water. I took my hand and pushed it down. The preacher pulled me  to him and I went in water to my waist. I said 'Oh Lordy' when that  water hit my stomach. The preacher said, 'Now sister, you just hold your  breath and shut your mouth; trust in the Lord and don't act like a  grunting pig, but have faith'. Then the singing seemed far off and the  preacher's voice got deep. He put his big hand over my mouth and told me  to limber up my back. His other hand was under my back. He pushed me  over, and down in the water I went; then up I come. The preacher put a  towel over my face, and while I was getting water out of my eyes and  mouth, he was saying about the Lord done reached down from Heaven and  created a new soul. I felt real funny when I turned to walk up out of  the water. I could hardly walk for I had on so many clothes and they  were so heavy. As soon as I could I got into the clothes that I wore to  the baptizing and put on my black shoes and the pair of white stockings  that I had fetched with me. While aunt Kizie Lockhart was tying the  handkerchief around my head that Miss Bessie give me, I told her about  how I felt. She said, 'Why, sure child, ain't you done washed your sins  away and got converted?'    \"Then she grabbed me by the hand and we went out among the people  shouting praises to the Lord. I ain't never felt the same since. Aunt  Kizie took me round to say 'howdy' to Miss Bessie. When the preacher had  got them all baptized, we went into the church and had services. The  white folks went on home after the baptizing was over. At the church we  shouted till we could not shout no more. Folks don't like that now. They  don't feel good when they join the church no more, either. I ain't had  nothing to come against me since I was baptized. My head loses lots of  things, but not my religion.    \"Lots of folks was at Mr. Henry's Pa's house for his infair dinner. Mr.  Hiram and Miss Bessie give the infair after the wedding. Miss Agnes, his  sister come back for the wedding. Mr. Henry had sharp snapping eyes and  he was good looking then. His eyes can still snap. When he looked at  Miss Mary his face would light up. Her name was Miss Mary Gilmer, and  she lived up near the lead mine. She sure looked good in white. I did  not see the wedding, so I had to look careful at them when they come in  Miss Bessie's front door so I could take it all in.    \"The infair sure was fine. The table was most breaking down with turkey,  chicken, ham, salads, pies and cakes. All the things to eat, already  fixed on the plates, was fetched in from the kitchen by the Negroes. The  chickens and turkeys just set on the table for ornaments and was not  touched until the next day.    \"The infair started at three o'clock in the afternoon. There were three  or four tables for the people to sit at. The dining room and one other  room were used to seat the guests at the tables while they ate. I can  still see Miss Bessie's white linen table cloth that reached nearly to  the floor. Such a time as I had the week before, washing and ironing the  big linen napkins and shining the silver.    \"They all looked mighty fine at the tables in their fine clothes. I  could not help looking often at Mr. Henry's wife. Miss Bessie had done  studied everything out so as it all went off fine.\"          Gable Locklier          *Interview with Uncle Gable Locklier, age 86*      *Gourdin, S.C.*      --_H. Grady Davis and Mrs. Lucile Young, Florence, S.C._    \"I born in Clarendon county, 50 yards of Davis Station.

Stayed dere till she  married Mr. Thomas, de preacher, dat have big place in Summerton wid  trees in long row right up to de door. He bought place three miles from  Summerton called de Bashet place. Mrs. Bethune was a sport lady en was  good to me en Mr. Thomas good man too, but he was a Yankee.

Mr.  Thomas, he Yankee, but he fought for de Confederates.    \"Massa Henry Bethune had big plantation en had a right sharp of slaves  dere.
