Let it       stand as regards them, and blot out the word \"woman.\" It may       possibly be woman's place to suffer. At any rate, let her suffer,       if, by that means, _man_kind may suffer less.         A VOICE: You are too self-sacrificing.         ERNESTINE L. ROSE: I always sympathize with those who seem to be       in the minority. I know it requires a great deal of moral courage       to object to anything that appears to have been favorably       received. I know very well from long experience how it feels to       stand in a minority of one; and I am glad that my friend on the       other side (Mrs. Halleck) has already added one to make a       minority of two, though that is by far too small to be       comfortable. I, for one, object to the proposition to throw woman       out of the race for freedom. (Applause). And do you know why?       Because she needs freedom for the freedom of man. (Applause). Our       ancestors made a great mistake in not recognizing woman in the       rights of man. It has been justly stated that the negro at       present suffers more than woman, but it can do him no injury to       place woman in the same category with him. I, for one, object to       having that term stricken out, for it can have no possible       bearing against anything that we want to promote: we desire to       promote human rights and human freedom. It can do no injury, but       must do good, for it is a painful fact that woman under the law       has been in the same category with the slave. Of late years she       has had some small privileges conceded to her. Now, mind, I say       _conceded_; for publicly it has not yet been recognized by the       laws of the land that she has a right to an equality with man. In       that resolution it simply states a fact, that in a republic based       upon freedom, woman, as well as the negro, should be recognized       as an equal with the whole human race. (Applause)         ANGELINE G. WELD: _Mrs. President_--I rejoice exceedingly that       that resolution should combine us with the negro. I feel that we       have been with him; that the iron has entered into our souls.       True, we have not felt the slave-holder's lash; true, we have not       had our hands manacled, but our _hearts_ have been crushed. Was       there a single institution in this country that would throw open       its doors to the acknowledgment of woman's equality with man in       the race for science and the languages, until Oberlin, Antioch,       Lima, and a very few others opened their doors, twenty years ago?       Have I not heard women say--I said thus to my own brother, as I       used to receive from him instruction and reading: \"Oh, brother,       that I could go to college with you! that I could have the       instruction you do! but I am crushed! I hear nothing, I know       nothing, except in the fashionable circle.\" A teacher said to a       young lady, who had been studying for several years, on the day       she finished her course of instruction, \"I thought you would be       very glad that you were so soon to go home, so soon to leave your       studies.\" She looked up, and said, \"What was I made for? When I       go home I shall live in a circle of fashion and folly. I was not       made for embroidery and dancing; I was made a woman; but I can       not be a true woman, a full-grown woman, in America.\"         Now, my friends, I do not want to find fault with the past. I       believe that men did for women the best that they knew how to do.       They did not know their own rights; they did not recognize the       rights of any man who had a black face. We can not wonder that,       in their tenderness for woman, they wanted to shelter and protect       her, and they made those laws from true, human, generous       feelings. Woman was then too undeveloped to demand anything else.       But woman is full-grown to-day, whether man knows it or not,       equal to her rights, and equal to the responsibilities of the       hour. I want to be identified with the negro; until he gets his       rights, we never shall have ours. (Applause).         SUSAN B. ANTHONY: This resolution brings in no question, no       _ism_. It merely makes the assertion that in a true democracy, in       a genuine republic, every citizen who lives under the government       must have the right of representation. You remember the maxim,       \"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the       governed.\" This is the fundamental principle of democracy; and       before our Government can be a true democracy--before our       republic can be placed upon lasting and enduring foundations--the       civil and political rights of every citizen must be practically       established. This is the assertion of the resolution. It is a       philosophical statement. It is not because women suffer, it is       not because slaves suffer, it is not because of any individual       rights or wrongs--it is the simple assertion of the great       fundamental truth of democracy that was proclaimed by our       Revolutionary fathers. I hope the discussion will no longer be       continued as to the comparative rights or wrongs of one class or       another. The question before us is: Is it possible that peace and       union shall be established in this country; is it possible for       this Government to be a true democracy, a genuine republic, while       one-sixth or one-half of the people are disfranchised?         MRS. HOYT: I do not object to the philosophy of these       resolutions. I believe in the advancement of the human race, and       certainly not in a retrograde movement of the Woman's Rights       question; but at the same time I do insist that nothing that has       become obnoxious to a portion of the people of the country shall       be dragged into this meeting. (Applause). The women of the North       were invited here to meet in convention, not to hold a Temperance       meeting, not to hold an Anti-Slavery meeting, not to hold a       Woman's Rights Convention, but to consult as to the best       practical way for the advancement of the loyal cause. To my       certain knowledge there are ladies in this house who have come       hundreds of miles, who will withdraw from this convention, who       will go home disappointed, and be thrown back on their own       resources, and form other plans of organization; whereas they       would much prefer to co-operate with the National Convention if       this matter were not introduced. This movement must be sacred to       the one object of assisting our Government. I would add one more       remark, that though the women of the Revolution did help our       Government in that early struggle, they did not find it necessary       to set forth in any theoretical or clamorous way their right to       equal suffrage or equal political position, though doubtless they       believed, as much as any of us, in the advancement of woman.         A LADY: I want to ask the lady who just spoke if the women of the       Revolution found it necessary to form Loyal Leagues? We are not       bound to do just as the women of the Revolution did. (Applause       and laughter).         LUCY N. COLEMAN, of Rochester, N. Y.: I wish to say, in the first       place, something a little remote from the point, which I have in       my mind just now. A peculiar sensitiveness seems to have come       over some of the ladies here in reference to the anti-slavery       spirit of the resolutions. It seems to me impossible that a       company of women could stand upon this platform without catching       something of the anti-slavery spirit, and without expressing, to       some extent, their sympathy with the advancement of human rights.       It is the Anti-Slavery women and the Woman's Rights women who       called this meeting, and who have most effectually aided in this       movement. Their hearts bleed to the very core that our nation is       to-day suffering to its depths, and they came together to devise       means whereby they could help the country in its great calamity.       I respect the woman who opposed this resolution, for daring to       say so much. She says that it is an Anti-Slavery Convention that       is in session. So it is, and something more. (Applause). She says       it is a Woman's Rights Convention. So it is, and even more than       that; it is a World's Convention. (Applause). Another woman (I       rejoice to hear that lisping, foreign tongue) says that our       sphere is so narrow that we should be careful to keep within it.       All honor to her, that she dared to say even that. I recognize       for myself no narrow sphere. (Applause). Where you may work, my       brother, I may work. I would willingly stand upon the       battle-field, and would be glad to receive the balls in my       person, if in that way I could do more for my country's good than       in any other. I recognize no right of any man or of any woman to       say that I should not stand there. Our sphere is _not_ narrow--it       is broad.         In reference to this resolution, Mrs. Halleck thinks it might be       well to leave out woman. No, no. Do you remember, friends, long,       long ago here in New York, an Anti-Slavery convention broke up in       high dudgeon, because a woman was put upon a committee? But that       Anti-Slavery Society, notwithstanding those persons who felt so       sensitive withdrew from it, has lived thirty years, and to-day it       has the honor of being credited as the cause of this war. Perhaps       if the principle which was then at stake--that a woman had a       right to be on a committee--had been waived, from the very fact       that the principle of right was overruled, that Society would       have failed.

Mr. Geary to sing at a concert, but declined, being advised       not to sing at public concerts until her return to the       United States. She therefore sang only at private parties       until July, 1854, when that same noble benefactress, the       Duchess of Sutherland, secured for her two places in 'The       Indiana' steam-packet for New York.         \"With a warm invitation to revisit England at some future       period, she embarked at Southampton to return to America.\"    The trip to London and its attendant circumstances resulted in much  benefit to Miss Greenfield in an intrinsic, artistic sense, adding  decided _eclat_ to her professional reputation. \"The New-York Herald,\"  a journal which in those days was generally quite averse to bestowing  even well-merited praise upon persons of her race, was, however, so  much moved upon by her exhibition of an increased technical knowledge  of the lyric art as to speak of Miss Greenfield as follows: \"'The  Swan' sings now in true artistic style, and the wonderful powers of  her voice have been developed by good training.\" This was but echoing  the general verdict.    During the years that intervened between Miss Greenfield's return from  England and her death,--the latter event occurring at Philadelphia in  the month of April, 1876,--she was engaged in singing occasionally at  concerts, and in giving lessons in vocal music.    Remembering her own hard contests as she ascended the hill of fame,  Miss Greenfield ever held out a helping hand to all whom she found  struggling to obtain a knowledge of the noble art of music.  Possessing, on account of her great vocal abilities, the high esteem  of the general public, from a rare amiability of disposition enjoying  the warm love of many friends in those private circles where she was  always an ornament and a blessing, this wonderfully gifted lady at the  age of sixty-eight years died, deeply mourned by all. Of her brilliant  career, of her life, which, in many important respects, was so grandly  useful, as well as of her peaceful death, nothing more need here be  added, further than to place her name in the honorable list of those  of whom Milton so eloquently says,--         \"Nothing is here for tears; nothing to wail,       Or knock the breast; no weakness, no contempt,       Dispraise, or blame; _nothing but well and fair_,       And what may quiet us in a death so noble.\"          VI.    THE \"LUCA FAMILY,\"    VOCALISTS AND INSTRUMENTALISTS.         \"God sent his singers upon earth       With songs of sadness and of mirth,       That they might touch the hearts of men,       And bring them back to heaven again....         But the great Master said, 'I see       No best in kind, but in degree:       I gave a various gift to each,--       To charm, to strengthen, and to teach.'\"         _From_ LONGFELLOW'S _The Singers_.      While nearly all persons have to a greater or lesser degree musical  sympathy and capability, or, to speak generally, capacity for the  enjoyment or production, in one way or another, of harmony; and while,  too, a goodly number there are who possess what may be called musical  aptitude,--it is yet only once in a great while that we find those who  are thus endowed in a degree which may be considered extraordinary.  For the Muses, however often and earnestly invoked, are never lavish  in the bestowment of their favors. This is especially true as applied  to the goddess who presides over the art of music. Only here and there  is some one selected to whom is given great musical inspiration;  into whose keeping is placed the divine harp, which, when swept by his  hands, the people shall hear entranced.    [Illustration:    1. ALEXANDER C. LUCA, SEN.    2. CLEVELAND O. LUCA.    3. ALEXANDER C. LUCA, JUN.    4. JOHN W. LUCA.]    Occasionally we may observe in families one member who appears  particularly favored by nature in the possession of rich and varied  musical talents, the same being improved by careful cultivation. Such  a one readily attracts attention: his native endowments and his  extensive acquirements often form the theme of conversation, of  warmest praise; while everywhere he is a most welcome guest. But, if  in a family a single instance of this kind produces the effects just  described, the latter can but be greatly enhanced when is found a  family composed of a number of persons in no wise small, each one of  which is a highly-talented and finely-educated musician. It is,  however,--for the reasons already mentioned,--so rare a thing to see  the musical faculty thus possessed, and its advantages thus fully  embraced, by an entire household of nearest relatives, as to render  the circumstance a cause of much surprise; while a family so greatly  skilled in the most beautiful, the most charming, of all arts, easily  attains to high distinction, its members becoming objects of such  general private and public interest as to render their careers quite  worthy of the best efforts of those who would make the same a matter  of history.    The foregoing remarks, although made in a somewhat general way, may be  particularly applied to that excellent troupe of artists, the \"Luca  family,\" a brief account of whose remarkable natural endowments,  superior acquirements, and interesting musical life, is here appended.    The family, as at first professionally organized, consisted of six  persons,--the father, mother, and four sons. Some changes that  occurred afterwards will appear as the narrative progresses.    Alexander C. Luca, the father, whose history shows most pointedly how  much may be accomplished by devoted study, deserves especial mention.  He was born in Milford, Conn., in the year 1805. He is, in the most  proper sense, a \"self-made\" man. Possessing but few opportunities for  acquiring an education, he yet made the most of those he had, and is  to-day a man of varied culture, an excellent example of the Christian  gentleman. At the age of twenty-one years he apprenticed himself to a  shoemaker, having previously spent his life upon a farm; and, while  thus engaged, he showed a decided taste for music. In the shop where  he worked were several boys who were learning the trade, and who were  also members of the village singing-school. Going occasionally into  their school, listening eagerly to all they sang and talked about both  there and in the shop, he soon learned their songs, and was induced by  the surprised teacher to join the school. In a short time, by the aid  of a naturally musical ear and a good voice, and by diligent study of  the rudiments, he became quite a proficient scholar; surpassing, in  fact, most of the other pupils of the school.    After learning his trade he removed to New Haven, Conn., where after a  while he was married to a lady of fine musical qualities (she being  especially remarked as a singer), and who was also of a musical  family. Soon after his arrival at New Haven, Mr. Luca, having acquired  by this time quite a fine knowledge of music, and being an excellent  vocalist, was chosen chorister of a Congregationalist church. In a  short time his choir was considered the equal of any in the city;  which was high but well-deserved praise. Some time previously to the  formation of what was called professionally the \"Luca family,\" the  subject of this sketch organized a quartet consisting of Miss Dianah  Lewis,[11] a sister of his wife, his two older sons, and himself, and  gave in New Haven and vicinity a number of fine concerts. Mr. Luca  trained all his children in music at an early age, and taught them to  sing in his choir at the church.    [Footnote 11: She was a vocalist of rare powers, and was considered  the equal of the celebrated Miss Greenfield, or, as the latter was  frequently called, the \"Black Swan.\"]    Mrs. Luca heartily sympathized with, and aided her husband in, the  musical and general culture of the family. One of the sons thus speaks  of her: \"Our earlier taste for music was especially encouraged by our  mother, who thought that the study of it would claim us from the bad  influences which idle hours and mischievous associations engendered.\"    With such parents it is not strange that the Luca children became so  worthy and eminent as exponents of the art of music.    John W. Luca, the oldest son, when quite young, was remarkable,  mostly, as a comic singer. He sang frequently at school exhibitions,  and often created much sensation in singing a temperance song called  \"The Old Toper.\"    Alexander C., jun., who in after-years became so noticeable as a  tenor-singer and violinist, was at first the dullest of the boys.
