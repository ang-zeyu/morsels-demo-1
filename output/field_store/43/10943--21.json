Spain and her colonies were treated in seventy  pages, Great Britain and her colonies in three, France in four, while  America, from Greenland to Patagonia, was handled as a single entity,  one figure each, and those absurdly small, being set for \"her  population, army, and navy.\" The _Confederacion de los Estados Unidos_  was barely mentioned as one of the five \"States\" of North America.    But the only feature of his book for which the author felt called upon  to apologize, was the catering to popular superstition, as in stating,  for instance, that in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela is  adored the veritable body of St. James. He cast a quizzical glance at  me in reading this, and then laughed himself purple in the face. \"One  has to say these things in this country,\" he gasped, still breathless  from his mirth. \"Drops of water must run with the stream. If only  there were a shrine where people might be cured of being fools!\"    Quick-witted as the old gentleman was, he presently detected a lack of  geographical enthusiasm in his audience. His literary vanity smarted  for a moment and then he fell to laughing, declaring that ladies  always had a distaste for useful information. \"That old wife of mine\"  could not abide arithmetic. He digressed into an explanation of the  Roman notation, making it quite clear to us wherein IX differs from  XI, and with antiquated courtliness of phrase, even for Spain, asked  our gracious permission to cause himself the pain of departure.    He often reappeared. His wiry arm, reached through the Moorish bars of  the outer door, would give its own peculiarly energetic twitch to the  bell chain looped within. A maid, leaning over the railing of an upper  story, would call down the challenge inherited from good old fighting  times, \"Who comes here?\" And his thin voice would chirp the Andalusian  answer, \"Peace.\"    On his second visit he fairly gurgled with pleasure as he placed  another volume with his name on the title-page before me. Since I did  not incline to solid reading, behold him equally ready to supply me  with the sweets of literature! This, too, was a school book, a  somewhat haphazard collection of Castilian poems, with brief  biographies of the authors represented. Its novel educational feature  was the printing of each poem in a different type. The result was a  little startling to the eye, but the editor was doubtless right in  claiming that it made the reading harder for the children, and so  developed their powers through exercise. Here, again, he was ashamed  of the fact that fully two-thirds of the poems were religious.    \"But what can one do in this country?\" he asked testily. \"All the  reading books have to be like that. Bah! But we will not read these  pious verses. The others are much more entertaining.\"    Determined not to wound him again by any lack of interest in books of  his own shaping, we sat patiently through page after page of that  juvenile school reader; but when, with a pamphlet on spelling and  punctuation, we had completed the list of his works, I once more  called his attention to Calderon.    This struck him as a capital joke. He had never read Calderon himself,  he had hardly heard of Calderon, and that a foreigner, a woman at  that, should insist on reading Calderon, was funny enough to make his  old sides ache. There were modern authors in plenty who must certainly  write much better than an out-of-date fellow like that. He had books  that he could lend me. He had friends from whom he could borrow. But  nothing would please me but Calderon! Why under the fanciful moon  should I set my heart on Calderon?    \"_Bueno!_\" he cried at last, whisking the mirthful tears from his  eyes. \"_Vamos a ver!_ Let us go on and see!\"    We opened the classic volume at the Catholic Faust-drama, _El Magico  Prodigioso_, and began to read, soon passing into the great argument  between Cipriano and Lucifer as to the nature of God. Our guest,  sensitive to all impressions as he was, became immediately amazed and  delighted.    \"But this is lofty!\" he exclaimed. \"This is sublime! Good, Cipriano,  good! Now you have him! What will the devil say to that? _Vamos a  ver!_\"    At the close of that tremendous scene he shut the book, fairly panting  with excitement. But nevertheless there was a twinkle in his eye. He  knew now why I craved this Calderon. He was evidently a religious  writer, and women were all religious. It was an amiable feminine  weakness, like the aversion to geography and arithmetic. But his  indulgent chivalry rose to the occasion. Having learned my taste, such  as it was, he would gratify it to the utmost.    \"If you would only come and see my library!\" he proposed. \"I have  exactly the book there that will please you. I have not read it  myself, but it is very large, with most beautiful pictures, and it  tells these old stories about Lucifer and all that. I am sure it is  just what you would like. Will you not do your humble servant the  honor of coming to-morrow afternoon?\"    I ran over in my mind our engagements for the morrow. He mistook the  cause of my hesitation.    \"Indeed you need not be afraid to come,\" he urged. \"My house is as  safe as a convent. That old wife of mine, too, will be sure to be  somewhere about. And you can bring the silent senorita with you.\"    I was aware of a slight convulsion in \"the silent senorita.\" She could  speak all the Spanish she chose, but she found the eccentricities of  this visitor so disconcerting that she affected ignorance, and he  supposed her mute presence at our interviews to be purely in deference  to the Spanish proprieties.    My youthful chaperon, much elated by this reversal of our natural  positions, duly attended me the next day to our friend's surprisingly  elegant home. He was forever crying poverty and telling us, with the  tears that came to his old age as easily as the laughter, how the  hardships of life had beaten out of him every ambition save hope to  \"gain the bread\" until his death, but we found him luxuriously housed,  and I was afterward informed that he was one of the richest men in the  city.    He ran with that wonderful sprightliness of his across the marbled  court to meet us, and ceremoniously conducted us up the handsome  staircase. He led us through all \"our house,\" typically Andalusian,  with statues and urns of blossoming trees set in the open patios, with  Moorish arches and bright-hued tiles, shaded balconies, tapestried and  curtained beds, _braseros_, and rocking-chairs, and in every room  images and paintings of the saints, at which he made irreverent  grimaces.    There were family portraits, too, before three of which he broke down  into weeping--the son who had died in the prime of manhood, the  daughter lost in her fair maidenhood, and, where the stormy sobs shook  him from head to foot, the Benjamin of his heart, a clear-eyed young  officer who had fallen in the Cuban war. The tears were still  streaming down the quivering old face when we turned silently  away--for what word of comfort would Americans dare to speak?--and  followed him to his study.    He was of extravagant repute in his locality as a scholar and a man of  letters, and his study was what a study ought to be,--well furnished  with desk, pigeon-holes, all the tools of literary labor, and walled  with books. Among these was an encyclopaedia in which, to his frank  astonishment, he found an article of fifteen pages on Calderon. The  great volume we had come to see lay open on a reading stand. It was a  Spanish Bible, with the Dore illustrations. I wanted to look at the  title-page, but our eager host, proud to exhibit and explain, tossed  over the leaves so fast that I had no opportunity.    As he was racing through the Psalms, impatient because of their dearth  of pictures, my eye was caught by the familiar passage, \"As the hart  panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God.\"    With prompt curiosity, he popped down his white head, in its  close-fitting skullcap, to see what I was noting, and instantly went  off into an immoderate gust of laughter.    \"_Muy bien!_\" he wheezed, as soon as he could recover anything like a  voice. \"But that is very cleverly put. He was a witty fellow who wrote  that. Just so! Just so! The deer goes to the water because he means to  get something for himself, and that is why the young men go into the  priesthood, and why the women go to mass. It's all selfishness, is  religion. But how well he says it!\"    \"No, no!\" I exclaimed, for once startled into protest. \"He is saying  that religion is the impulse of thirst.\"    The incorrigible old worldling took this for another jest, and, as in  gallantry bound, laughed harder at my sally than at poor King David's.    \"Excellent! Perfect! So it is! So it is! Religion is the impulse to  fill one's own stomach. Just what I have always said! 'As the hart  panteth after the water brooks'--ho, ho! I must try to remember that.\"    His enthusiasm for Calderon soon kindled to a flame. As the plot  thickened he ceased to be of the slightest help in any difficulties  that the text might offer. In vain I would beseech him to clear up  some troublesome passage.    \"Oh, never mind!\" he would say, vexed at the interruption. \"They  didn't write very well in those old days. And I want to know which of  her three suitors Justina took. Three at once! What a situation!  _Vamos a ver!_ I hope it will be Cipriano.\"    As the spell of Calderon's imagination passed more and more strongly  upon him, this most sympathetic of readers quite accepted, for the  time being, the poet's Catholic point of view, trembling for Cipriano  and almost choking with agitated joy when Justina, calling in her  extremity upon the name of God, put Lucifer to flight. But after we  had read the drama to the end, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38777"],[0,"Lad: A Dog (#17)"],[1,"him from showing his teeth  when some of these passing humans paused in front of the compartment  to pat him or to consult his number in their catalogues. But he  accorded not so much as one look--to say nothing of a handshake--to  any of them.    A single drop of happiness was in his sorrow-cup. He had, seemingly,  done something that made both the Master and the Mistress very, _very_  proud of him. He did not know just why they should be for he had done  nothing clever. In fact, he had been at his dullest. But they _were_  proud of him--undeniably proud, and this made him glad, through all  his black despondency.    Even the collie man seemed to regard him with more approval than  before--not that Lad cared at all; and two or three exhibitors came  over for a special look at him. From one of these exhibitors the  Mistress learned of a dog-show rule that was wholly new to her.    She was told that the winning dog of each and every class was obliged  to return later to the ring to compete in what was known as the  Winners' class--a contest whose entrants included every class-victor  from Novice to Open. Briefly, this special competition was to  determine which class-winner was the best collie in the whole list of  winners and, as such, entitled to a certain number of \"points\" toward  a championship. There were eight of these winners.    One or two such world-famed champions as Grey Mist and Southport  Sample were in the show \"for exhibition only.\" But the pick of the  remaining leaders must compete in the winners' class--Sunnybank Lad  among them. The Master's heart sank at this news.    \"I'm sorry!\" he said. \"You see, it's one thing to win as a Novice  against a bunch of untried dogs, and quite another to compete against  the best dogs in the show. I wish we could get out of it.\"    \"Never mind!\" answered the Mistress. \"Laddie has won his ribbon. They  can't take that away from him. There's a silver cup for the Winners'  class, though. I wish there had been one for the Novices.\"    The day wore on. At last came the call for \"Winners!\" And for the  second time poor Lad plodded reluctantly into the ring with the  Mistress. But now, instead of novice dogs, he was confronted by the  cream of colliedom.    Lad's heartsick aspect showed the more intensely in such company. It  grieved the Mistress bitterly to see his disconsolate air. She thought  of the three days and nights to come--the nights when she and the  Master could not be with him, when he must lie listening to the babel  of yells and barks all around, with nobody to speak to him except some  neglectful and sleepy attendant. And for the sake of a blue ribbon she  had brought this upon him!    The Mistress came to a sudden and highly unsportsmanlike resolution.    Again the dogs paraded the ring. Again the judge studied them from  between half-shut eyes. But this time he did not wave Lad to one  side. The Mistress had noted, during the day, that McGilead had  always made known his decisions by first laying his hand on the  victor's head. And she watched breathless for such a gesture.    One by one the dogs were weeded out until only two remained. Of these  two, one was Lad--the Mistress' heart banged crazily--and the other  was Champion Coldstream Guard. The Champion was a grand dog,  gold-and-white of hue, perfect of coat and line, combining all that  was best in the old and new styles of collies. He carried his head  nobly aloft with no help from the choke-collar. His \"tulip\" ears hung  at precisely the right curve.    Lad and Coldstream Guard were placed shoulder to shoulder on the  platform. Even the Mistress could not fail to contrast her pet's  woe-begone aspect with the Champion's alert beauty.    \"Lad!\" she said, very low, and speaking with slow intentness as  McGilead compared the two. \"Laddie, we're going home. Home! _Home_,  Lad!\"    Home! At the word, a thrill went through the great dog. His shoulders  squared. Up went his head and his ears. His dark eyes fairly glowed  with eagerness as he looked expectantly up at the Mistress. _Home!_    Yet, despite the transformation, the other was the finer dog--from a  mere show viewpoint. The Mistress could see he was. Even the new  uptilt of Lad's ears could not make those ears so perfect in shape and  attitude as were the Champion's.    With almost a gesture of regret McGilead laid his hand athwart  Coldstream Guard's head. The Mistress read the verdict, and she  accepted it.    \"Come, Laddie, dear,\" she said tenderly. \"You're second, anyway,  Reserve-Winner. That's _something_.\"    \"Wait!\" snapped McGilead.    The judge was seizing one of Champion Coldstream Guard's supershapely  ears and turning it backward. His sensitive fingers, falling on the  dog's head in token of victory, had encountered an odd stiffness in  the curve of the ear. Now he began to examine that ear, and then the  other, and thereby he disclosed a most clever bit of surgical  bandaging.    Neatly crisscrossed, inside each of the Champion's ears, was a  succession of adhesive-plaster strips cut thin and running from tip to  orifice. The scientific applying of these strips had painfully  imparted to the prick-ears (the dog's one flaw) the perfect tulip-shape  so desirable as a show-quality. Champion Coldstream Guard's silken  ears could not have had other than ideal shape and posture if he  had wanted them to--while that crisscross of sticky strips held  them in position!    Now, this was no new trick--the ruse that the Champion's handlers had  employed. Again and again in bench-shows, it had been employed upon  bull-terriers. A year or two ago a woman was ordered from the ring, at  the Garden, when plaster was found inside her terrier's ears, but  seldom before had it been detected in a collie--in which a prick-ear  usually counts as a fatal blemish.    McGilead looked at the Champion. Long and searchingly he looked at the  man who held the Champion's leash--and who fidgeted grinningly under  the judge's glare. Then McGilead laid both hands on Lad's great honest  head--almost as in benediction.    \"Your dog wins, Madam,\" he said, \"and while it is no part of a judge's  duty to say so, I am heartily glad. I won't insult you by asking if he  is for sale, but if ever you have to part with him----\"    He did not finish, but abruptly gave the Mistress the \"Winning Class\"  rosette.    And now, as Lad left the ring, hundreds of hands were put out to pat  him. All at once he was a celebrity.    Without returning the dog to the bench, the Mistress went directly to  the collie man.    \"When do they present the cups?\" she asked.    \"Not until Saturday night, I believe,\" said the man. \"I congratulate  you both on----\"    \"In order to win his cup, Lad will have to stay in this--this  inferno--for three days and nights longer?\"    \"Of course. All the dogs----\"    \"If he doesn't stay, he won't get the cup?\"    \"No. It would go to the Reserve, I suppose, or to----\"    \"Good!\" declared the Mistress in relief. \"Then he won't be defrauding  anyone, and they can't rob him of his two ribbons because I have  those.\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked the puzzled collie man.    But the Master understood--and approved.    \"Good!\" he said. \"I wanted all day to suggest it to you, but I didn't  have the nerve. Come around to the Exhibitors' Entrance. I'll go ahead  and start the car.\"    \"But what's the idea?\" queried the collie man in bewilderment.    \"The idea,\" replied the Mistress, \"is that the cup can go to any dog  that wants it. Lad's coming _home_. He knows it, too. Just look  at him. I promised him he should go home. We can get there by  dinner-time, and he has a day's fast to make up for.\"    \"But,\" expostulated the scandalized collie man, \"if you withdraw your  dog like that, the Association will never allow you to exhibit him at  its shows again.\"    \"The Association can have a pretty silver cup,\" retorted the Mistress,  \"to console it for losing Lad. As for exhibiting him again--well, I  wouldn't lose these two ribbons for a hundred dollars, but I wouldn't  put my worst enemy's dog to the torture of winning them over  again--for a thousand. Come along, Lad, we're going back home.\"    At the talisman-word, Lad broke silence for the first time in all that  vilely wretched day. He broke it with a series of thunderously  trumpeting barks that quite put to shame the puny noise-making efforts  of every other dog in the show.          CHAPTER VI    LOST!      Four of us were discussing abstract themes, idly, as men will, after a  good dinner and in front of a country-house fire. Someone asked:    \"What is the saddest sight in everyday life? I don't mean the most  gloomily tragic, but the saddest?\"    A frivolous member of the fireside group cited a helpless man between  two quarreling women. A sentimentalist said:    \"A lost child in a city street.\"    The Dog-Master contradicted:    \"A lost _dog_ in a city street.\"    Nobody agreed with him of course; but that was because none of the  others chanced to know dogs--to know their psychology--their souls, if  you prefer. The dog-man was right. A lost dog in a city street is the  very saddest and most hopeless sight in all a city street's abounding  everyday sadness.    A man between two quarreling women is an object piteous enough, heaven  knows. Yet his plight verges too much on the grotesque to be called  sad.    A lost child?--No. Let a child stand in the middle of a crowded  sidewalk and begin to cry. In one minute fifty amateur and professional  rescuers have flocked to the Lost One's aid. An hour, at most,  suffices to bring it in touch with its frenzied guardians.    A lost dog?--Yes. No succoring cohort surges to the relief. A gang of  boys, perhaps, may give chase, but assuredly not in kindness. A  policeman seeking a record for \"mad dog\" shooting--a professional  dog-catcher in quest of his dirty fee--these will show marked  attention to the wanderer. But, again, not in kindness.
