The nest of the Hay-bird resembles that  of the Wood-warbler, but it is lined with feathers. The eggs are  usually from five to seven, and of the same size and shape, but the  spots are rust-coloured and limited in number.        THE WOOD-WREN     PHYLLA\"SCOPUS SIBILATRIX        Upper plumage bright yellowish green; a broad streak of      sulphur-yellow over the eye; sides of the head, throat,      insertion of the wings and legs bright yellow; rest of the      under plumage pure white; second primary equal to the fourth,      third and fourth with the outer web sloped off at the      extremity; legs pale brown. Length five inches and a half;      breadth eight and three quarters. Eggs white, speckled so      thickly with purplish brown as almost to conceal the ground.    The Wood-warbler, Willow-warbler, and Chiff-chaff resemble each other  so closely in size, colour, and habits, that except by a practised  observer, they are likely to be mistaken for one another. In song,  however, they differ materially, and as this is begun early, and  continued till very late in the season, it affords ready means of  discriminating the species. The Wood-warbler, or Wood-wren as it is  now called, arrives in England towards the end of April, and betakes  itself to woodland districts, where it spends the greater portion of  its time among the upper branches of lofty trees, constantly moving  from place to place with rapid irregular flight, and frequently  repeating its short and peculiar song. It feeds exclusively on  insects, which it occasionally catches on the wing. Its song is  difficult to describe. The name by which it is popularly known in some  parts of France, _TouA-te_, is derived from the syllable '_tweet_',  which, rapidly and continuously repeated many times, constitutes its  song. These notes are uttered in a sweet tone, and with a tremulous  accent, and are unlike those of any other bird. Gilbert White, who  appears to have been the first who noticed the bird, describes it as  \"joyous, easy, and laughing\". The last notes of its strain are  accompanied by a quivering of the wings and tail, which accounts for  their tremulous sound.    The Wood-warbler is much less frequent than either the Willow-warbler  or Chiff-chaff, and on a close inspection may be distinguished by its  superior size, by the pure white of its under tail-coverts, and by the  bright yellow line above the eye. The nest is composed of grass,  ferns, and moss, and lined with fine grass and hair; it is covered  with a dome, an entrance being left sufficiently large to allow its  contents to be seen, and is placed on the ground, in or near a wood,  among thick herbage, or against the stump of a tree. The eggs are from  five to seven in number, almost round, and so thickly spotted with  purple-brown that the ground is almost invisible.        SUB-FAMILY REGULINA      THE GOLD-CREST     RA%GULUS CRISTATUS        Upper parts olive, tinged with yellow; cheeks ash colour,      without streaks; wing greyish brown, with two transverse white      bands; crest bright yellow, tipped with orange and bounded on      each side by a black line; under parts yellowish grey. In the      _female_ the crest is lemon colour, and the other tints are      less brilliant. Each nostril is covered by one buff feather.      Length three inches and a half. Eggs cream colour, minutely      mottled at one end.    The Gold-crest, Golden-crested Regulus, or Golden-crested Wren, though  not exceeding in dimensions some of the larger humming-birds, and  though decorated with a crest equalling in brilliancy of colour the  gay plumage of tropical birds, is a hardy little fellow, able to bear  without shrinking the cold of an English winter, and to keep his  position among the branches of high trees in the stormiest weather.  Even during a heavy gale I have watched Gold-crests fluttering from  branch to branch, and busily hunting for food, though the trees were  waving like reeds. They are most numerous in winter, as a considerable  number migrate southwards in October, but a great many remain with us  all the year, preferring those districts where there are  fir-plantations. Their whole life is spent in the air; I at least have  never observed one on the ground. Their food consists of the insects  which infest the leaves and twigs of trees; and I have seen them  capture small moths on the wing. While hunting for food, which appears  to be all day long, they are never still, fluttering from branch to  branch, hanging in all attitudes, and peering in all directions. From  time to time they utter their thin and wiry call-note, which is by  some compared to the cry of the Shrew. It might be mistaken for the  jarring noise made by two branches which cross one another, or that of  a damp finger rubbed lightly along a pane of glass. Early in spring  the song commences; it is composed of about fifteen short notes,  rapidly uttered at an exceedingly high pitch, and ending with a yet  more rapid cadence. By the call-note or song the vicinity of the bird  is far more frequently detected than by its actual appearance; for the  branches of firs in woods are mostly at a considerable height from the  ground, and our 'little king' (saving his majesty) is hard to be  distinguished from a fir-cone, except when he is in motion.  Gold-crests are eminently social birds; they generally hunt in parties  of half a dozen or more, and do not often change their hunting-ground;  at least I infer as much from the fact that on various occasions I  have observed the same bird on the same clump of trees, at intervals  extending over several weeks. I could scarcely have been mistaken in  the identity of the bird, as it had lost a leg, by what accident I  know not; but the loss did not at all interfere with its activity or  spirits. Their sociability extends sometimes to birds of other kinds,  as the Creeper and the Tits of several species have been seen hunting  in company with them. The habits of these birds being similar, they  perhaps associate from a feeling of mutual protection, just as  Sparrows, Buntings, and Finches make common cause, when they invade  our rick-yards. The Gold-crests are, however, naturally less wary than  any of the Tits. These last will at once decamp if disturbed, but  Gold-crests will continue their hunting without taking any notice of a  spectator. In autumn large flocks sometimes arrive on our east coast  extending across England and on into Ireland. In April a return  migration takes place. The nest of the Gold-crest is a beautiful  structure. Its external form is nearly that of a globe, with a  contracted opening at the top. It is composed of moss and lichens,  interwoven with wool and lined thickly with feathers. It is usually  placed among the boughs of a silver-fir or spruce-fir, in such a  manner as to be partially suspended from one branch and supported by  another. The bird seems neither to court nor to shun the vicinity of  human beings; as I have found nests in the most lonely woods, and I  have seen one in the branches of a spruce-fir, so close to my house  that I could look into the nest from my bedroom windows, and watch the  old birds feeding their young. The eggs vary in number from five to  eight, they are almost globular, and smaller than those of any other  British bird. This is scarcely surprising, seeing that the weight of a  recently killed adult male which I have before me is eighty-seven  grains; so that five and a half full-grown birds weigh but an ounce.

Length four inches. Eggs cream colour,      tinged with red and dotted.    This species both in size and habits resembles the last, from which it  is best distinguished by three dark lines on each side of its head.  Hence it is called in France '_Roitelet A  triple bandeau_'. It is far  less common than the Gold-crest, and has not been observed in the  winter, when birds of the other species are most abundant--in fact, it  is only a rare straggler. Its call-note is shorter than that of the  Gold-crest, not so shrill, and pitched in a different key. The nests  of the two birds are much alike.        FAMILY PARIDA      THE LONG-TAILED TIT     ACRA%DULA CAUDATA        Head, neck, throat, breast, and a portion of the outer      tail-feathers white; back, wings, and six middle feathers of      the tail black; a black streak above the eye; sides of the      back and scapulars tinged with rose-red; under parts reddish      white; tail very long; beak very short. Length five inches and      three-quarters; breadth six inches and three-quarters. Eggs      white, minutely and sparingly speckled with light red or plain      white.    All the Tits, of whatever species, are more or less sociable in their  habits, hunting about during autumn in parties of half a dozen or  more; but some of them are given to be quarrelsome, not only towards  other birds--like the Great Tit, who actually murders them for the  sake of picking out their brains--but among themselves, as the Blue  Tit, who has been noticed so intently engaged in combat with another  bird of his own kind, that the observer caught them both in his hat.  The Long-tailed Tits, however, are sociable after another sort.

This incident shows the great  drawback to the .303--namely, that it has very little knock-down effect  unless it strikes a vital part; and even then, in a bush country, an  animal may manage to go far enough to be lost. On the other hand, an  animal wounded with a hard bullet is likely to make a speedy recovery,  which is a great blessing.    Mahina was even more upset at the escape of the buck than I was, and as  we trudged back through the sand to our tree, he was full of gloomy  forebodings of an unlucky night. By the light of a splendid full moon  we settled ourselves on a great outspreading branch, and commenced our  vigil. Soon the jungle around us began to be alive with its peculiar  sounds--a night bird would call, a crocodile shut his jaws with a snap,  or a rhino or hippo crash through the bushes on its way to the water:  now and again we could even hear the distant roar of the lion. Still  there was nothing to be seen.    After waiting for some considerable time, a great hippo at last made  his appearance and came splashing along in our direction, but  unfortunately took up his position behind a tree which, in the most  tantalising way, completely hid him from view. Here he stood tooting  and snorting and splashing about to his heart's content. For what  seemed hours I watched for this ungainly creature to emerge from his  covert, but as he seemed determined not to show himself I lost patience  and made up my mind to go down after him. I therefore handed my rifle  to Mahina to lower to me on reaching the ground, and began to descend  carefully, holding on by the creepers which encircled the tree. To my  intense vexation and disappointment, just as I was in this helpless  condition, half-way to the ground, the great hippo suddenly came out  from his shelter and calmly lumbered along right underneath me. I  bitterly lamented my ill-luck and want of patience, for I could almost  have touched his broad back as he passed. It was under these  exasperating conditions that I saw a hippo for the first time, and  without doubt he is the ugliest and most forbidding looking brute I  have ever beheld.    The moment the great beast had passed our tree, he scented us, snorted  loudly, and dived into the bushes close by, smashing through them like  a traction engine. In screwing myself round to watch him go, I broke  the creepers by which I was holding on and landed on my back in the  sand at the foot of the tree--none the worse for my short drop, but  considerably startled at the thought that the hippo might come back at  any moment. I climbed up to my perch again without loss of time, but he  was evidently as much frightened as I was, and returned no more.  Shortly after this we saw two rhino come down to the river to drink;  they were too far off for a shot, however, so I did not disturb them,  and they gradually waddled up-stream out of sight. Then we heard the  awe-inspiring roar of a hungry lion close by, and presently another  hippo gave forth his tooting challenge a little way down the river. As  there seemed no likelihood of getting a shot at him from our tree, I  made up my mind to stalk him on foot, so we both descended from our  perch and made our way slowly through the trees in the semi-darkness.  There were numbers of animals about, and I am sure that neither of us  felt very comfortable as we crept along in the direction of the  splashing hippo; for my own part I fancied every moment that I saw in  front of me the form of a rhino or a lion ready to charge down upon us  out of the shadow of the bush.    In this manner, with nerves strung to the highest pitch, we reached the  edge of the river in safety, only to find that we were again baulked by  a small rush-covered island, on the other side of which our quarry  could be heard. There was a good breeze blowing directly from him,  however, so I thought the best thing to do was to attempt to get on to  the island and to have a shot at him from there. Mahina, too, was eager  for the fray, so we let ourselves quietly into the water, which here  was quite shallow and reached only to our knees, and waded slowly  across. On peering cautiously through the reeds at the corner of the  island, I was surprised to find that I could see nothing of the hippo;  but I soon realised that I was looking too far ahead, for on lowering  my eyes there he was, not twenty-five yards away, lying down in the  shallow water, only half covered and practically facing us. His  closeness to us made me rather anxious for our safety, more especially  as just then he rose to his feet and gave forth the peculiar challenge  or call which we had already heard so often during the night. All the  same, as he raised his head, I fired at it. He whirled round, made a  plunge forward, staggered and fell, and then lay quite still. To make  assurance doubly sure, I gave him a couple more bullets as he lay, but  we found afterwards that they were not needed, as my first shot had  been a very lucky one and had penetrated the brain. We left him where  he fell and got back to our perch, glad and relieved to be in safety  once more.    As soon as it was daylight we were joined by my own men and by several  Wa Kamba, who had been hunting in the neighbourhood. The natives cut  out the tusks of the hippo, which were rather good ones, and feasted  ravenously on the flesh, while I turned my attention with gratitude to  the hot coffee and cakes which Mabruki had meanwhile prepared.          CHAPTER XIII    A DAY ON THE N'DUNGU ESCARPMENT      Immediately after breakfast camp was struck, and accompanied by a few  of the Wa Kamba, we started off for the N'dungu Escarpment--a frowning  ridge which runs for a great distance parallel to the Sabaki, some  three or four miles from its northern bank. We had not gone very far  before I caught sight of a fine waterbuck and successfully bowled him  over--a good omen for the day, which put us all in excellent spirits.  Mabruki cut off several strips of the tough meat and impaled them on a  sharp stick to dry in the sun as he went along. I warned him that he  had better be careful that a lion did not scent the meat, as if it did  it would be sure to follow up and kill him. Of course I did not mean  this seriously; but Mabruki was a great glutton, and by no means  courageous, so I wanted to frighten him.    As we trudged along towards the hill, I heard a peculiar noise behind a  small rising on our right, and on looking over the crest, I was  delighted to see two beautiful giraffe feeding peacefully a little  distance away and straining their long necks to get at the tops of some  mimosa-like trees, while a young one was lying down in the grass quite  close to me. For some time I remained concealed, watching the  full-grown pair with great interest: they had evidently just come up  from the river, and were slowly making their way back to their home on  the escarpment. They seemed on the most affectionate terms,  occasionally entwining their great long necks and gently biting each  other on the shoulders. Much as I should have liked to have added a  giraffe to my collection of trophies, I left them undisturbed, as I  think it a pity to shoot these rather rare and very harmless creatures,  unless one is required for a special purpose.    We pushed on, accordingly, towards the escarpment, for I was very  impatient to get to the top and explore a place where I felt convinced  no other white man had ever set foot. From the river the ground rose  gently upwards to the foot of the ridge, and was covered more or less  densely with stunted trees and bushes, and of course the inevitable  \"wait-a-bit\" thorns. I was fortunate enough, however, to find a rhino  path which afforded a fairly comfortable and open road, on which we  could walk upright the greater part of the way. The climb up the  escarpment itself was a stiff one, and had to be negotiated principally  on all-fours, but on the way up I discovered that there was an enormous  cleft some miles to the right which would probably have afforded an  easier ascent. I had not time to explore it on this particular day, but  I made a mental note to do so on some future occasion.    After a two hours' journey from the river we sat panting on the summit  after our scramble and surveyed the valley of the Tsavo, which lay  spread out like a map about five hundred feet below us. Our home tents,  the bridge, Tsavo Station and other buildings were plainly visible, and  the railway itself, like a shining snake, could be seen for many miles  winding its way through the parched wilderness. Having taken a few  photographs of the scene, we turned and struck through the N'dungu  Plateau. Here I found the same kind of nyika as that round Tsavo, the  only difference being that there were more green trees about. The  country, moreover, was somewhat more open, and was intersected by  hundreds of broad and well-beaten animal paths, along which we could  walk upright in comfort. I was leading the way, followed closely by  Mahina and Mabruki, when suddenly we almost walked upon a lion which  was lying down at the side of the path and which had probably been  asleep. It gave a fierce growl and at once bounded off through the  bush; but to Mabruki--who doubtless recalled then the warning I had  given him in fun earlier in the day--the incident appeared so alarming  that he flung down his stick-load of meat and fled for his life, much  to the amusement of the others, even the usually silent Wa Kamba  joining in the general laughter as they scrambled for the discarded  meat. We saw nothing more of the lion, though a few steps further on  brought us to the remains of a zebra which he had recently killed and  feasted on; but after this Mabruki kept carefully in the rear.
