[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37206"],[0,"Sea and Sardinia (#17)"],[1," is not going to stop for her. And then, oh horror, her long  arms thrown out in wild supplication after the retreating train: then  flung aloft to God: then brought down in absolute despair on her head.  And this is the last sight we have of her, clutching her poor head in  agony and doubling forward. She is left--she is abandoned.    The poor fat husband has been all the time on the little outside  platform at the end of the carriage, holding out his hand to her and  shouting frenzied scolding to her and frenzied yells for the train to  stop. And the train has not stopped. And she is left--left on that  God-forsaken station in the waning light.    So, his face all bright, his eyes round and bright as two stars,  absolutely transfigured by dismay, chagrin, anger and distress, he comes  and sits in his seat, ablaze, stiff, speechless. His face is almost  beautiful in its blaze of conflicting emotions. For some time he is as  if unconscious in the midst of his feelings. Then anger and resentment  crop out of his consternation. He turns with a flash to the long-nosed,  insidious, Phoenician-looking guard. Why couldn't they stop the train  for her! And immediately, as if someone had set fire to him, off flares  the guard. Heh!--the train can't stop for every person's convenience!  The train is a train--the time-table is a time-table. What did the old  woman want to take her trips down the line for? Heh! She pays the  penalty for her own inconsiderateness. Had _she_ paid for the  train--heh? And the fat man all the time firing off his unheeding and  unheeded answers. One minute--only one minute--if he, the conductor had  told the driver! if he, the conductor, had shouted! A poor woman! Not  another train! What was she going to do! Her ticket? And no money. A  poor woman--    There was a train back to Cagliari that night, said the conductor, at  which the fat man nearly burst out of his clothing like a bursting  seed-pod. He bounced on his seat. What good was that? What good was a  train back to Cagliari, when their home was in Snelli! Making matters  worse--    So they bounced and jerked and argued at one another, to their hearts'  content. Then the conductor retired, smiling subtly, in a way they have.  Our fat friend looked at us with hot, angry, ashamed, grieved eyes and  said it was a shame. Yes, we chimed, it _was_ a shame. Whereupon a  self-important miss who said she came from some Collegio at Cagliari  advanced and asked a number of impertinent questions in a tone of pert  sympathy. After which our fat friend, left alone, covered his clouded  face with his hand, turned his back on the world, and gloomed.    It had all been so dramatic that in spite of ourselves we laughed, even  while the q-b shed a few tears.           *       *       *       *       *    Well, the journey lasted hours. We came to a station, and the conductor  said we must get out: these coaches went no further. Only two coaches  would proceed to Mandas. So we climbed out with our traps, and our fat  friend with his saddle-bag, the picture of misery.    The one coach into which we clambered was rather crowded. The only other  coach was most of it first-class. And the rest of the train was freight.  We were two insignificant passenger wagons at the end of a long string  of freight-vans and trucks.    There was an empty seat, so we sat on it: only to realize after about  five minutes, that a thin old woman with two children--her  grandchildren--was chuntering her head off because it was _her_  seat--why she had left it she didn't say. And under my legs was her  bundle of bread. She nearly went off her head. And over my head, on the  little rack, was her bercola, her saddle-bag. Fat soldiers laughed at  her good-naturedly, but she fluttered and flipped like a tart,  featherless old hen. Since she had another seat and was quite  comfortable, we smiled and let her chunter. So she clawed her bread  bundle from under my legs, and, clutching it and a fat child, sat tense.           *       *       *       *       *    It was getting quite dark. The conductor came and said that there was no  more paraffin. If what there was in the lamps gave out, we should have  to sit in the dark. There was no more paraffin all along the line.--So  he climbed on the seats, and after a long struggle, with various boys  striking matches for him, he managed to obtain a light as big as a pea.  We sat in this _clair-obscur_, and looked at the sombre-shadowed faces  round us: the fat soldier with a gun, the handsome soldier with huge  saddle-bags, the weird, dark little man who kept exchanging a baby with  a solid woman who had a white cloth tied round her head, a tall  peasant-woman in costume, who darted out at a dark station and returned  triumphant with a piece of chocolate: a young and interested young man,  who told us every station. And the man who spat: there is always one.    Gradually the crowd thinned. At a station we saw our fat friend go by,  bitterly, like a betrayed soul, his bulging saddle-bag hanging before  and after, but no comfort in it now--no comfort. The pea of light from  the paraffin lamp grew smaller. We sat in incredible dimness, and the  smell of sheeps-wool and peasant, with only our fat and stoic young man  to tell us where we were. The other dusky faces began to sink into a  dead, gloomy silence. Some took to sleep. And the little train ran on  and on, through unknown Sardinian darkness. In despair we drained the  last drop of tea and ate the last crusts of bread. We knew we must  arrive some time.           *       *       *       *       *    It was not much after seven when we came to Mandas. Mandas is a junction  where these little trains sit and have a long happy chat after their  arduous scramble over the downs. It had taken us somewhere about five  hours to do our fifty miles. No wonder then that when the junction at  last heaves in sight everybody bursts out of the train like seeds from  an exploding pod, and rushes somewhere for something. To the station  restaurant, of course. Hence there is a little station restaurant that  does a brisk trade, and where one can have a bed.    A quite pleasant woman behind the little bar: a brown woman with brown  parted hair and brownish eyes and brownish, tanned complexion and tight  brown velveteen bodice. She led us up a narrow winding stone stair, as  up a fortress, leading on with her candle, and ushered us into the  bedroom. It smelled horrid and sourish, as shutup bedrooms do. We threw  open the window. There were big frosty stars snapping ferociously in  heaven.    The room contained a huge bed, big enough for eight people, and quite  clean. And the table on which stood the candle actually had a cloth. But  imagine that cloth! I think it had been originally white: now, however,  it was such a web of time-eaten holes and mournful black inkstains and  poor dead wine stains that it was like some 2000 B.C. mummy-cloth. I  wonder if it could have been lifted from that table: or if it was  mummified on to it! I for one made no attempt to try. But that  table-cover impressed me, as showing degrees I had not imagined.--A  table-cloth.    We went down the fortress-stair to the eating-room. Here was a long  table with soup-plates upside down and a lamp burning an uncanny naked  acetylene flame. We sat at the cold table, and the lamp immediately  began to wane. The room--in fact the whole of Sardinia--was stone cold,  stone, stone cold. Outside the earth was freezing. Inside there was no  thought of any sort of warmth: dungeon stone floors, dungeon stone walls  and a dead, corpse-like atmosphere, too heavy and icy to move.    The lamp went quite out, and the q-b gave a cry. The brown woman poked  her head through a hole in the wall. Beyond her we saw the flames of the  cooking, and two devil-figures stirring the pots. The brown woman came  and shook the lamp--it was like a stodgy porcelain mantelpiece  vase--shook it well and stirred up its innards, and started it going  once more. Then she appeared with a bowl of smoking cabbage soup, in  which were bits of macaroni: and would we have wine? I shuddered at the  thought of death-cold red wine of the country, so asked what else there  was. There was malvagia--malvoisie, the same old malmsey that did for  the Duke of Clarence. So we had a pint of malvagia, and were comforted.  At least we were being so, when the lamp went out again. The brown woman  came and shook and smacked it, and started it off again. But as if to  say \"Shan't for you\", it whipped out again.    Then came the host with a candle and a pin, a large, genial Sicilian  with pendulous mustaches. And he thoroughly pricked the wretch with the  pin, shook it, and turned little screws. So up flared the flame. We were  a little nervous. He asked us where we came from, etc. And suddenly he  asked us, with an excited gleam, were we Socialists. Aha, he was going  to hail us as citizens and comrades. He thought we were a pair of  Bolshevist agents: I could see it. And as such he was prepared to  embrace us. But no, the q-b disclaimed the honor. I merely smiled and  shook my head. It is a pity to rob people of their exciting illusions.    \"Ah, there is too much socialism everywhere!\" cried the q-b.    \"Ma--perhaps, perhaps--\" said the discreet Sicilian. She saw which way  the land lay, and added:    \"Si vuole un _pocchetino_ di Socialismo: one wants a tiny bit of  socialism in the world, a tiny bit. But not much. Not much. At present  there is too much.\"    Our host, twinkling at this speech which treated of the sacred creed as  if it were a pinch of salt in the broth, believing the q-b was throwing  dust in his eyes, and thoroughly intrigued by us as a pair of deep ones,  retired. No sooner had he gone than the lamp-flame stood up at its full  length, and started to whistle. The q-b drew back. Not satisfied by  this, another flame suddenly began to whip round the bottom of the  burner, like a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3721"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part I: Pioneers of France in the New World (#17)"],[1,"I had  meanes to defend my selfe, give care a little now vnto mee, and if they  have eyes in their heads, let them see what men I had.\" Of Ribaut's  followers left at the fort, only nine or ten had weapons, while only two  or three knew how to use them. Four of them were boys, who kept Ribaut's  dogs, and another was his cook. Besides these, he had left a brewer, an  old crossbow-maker, two shoemakers, a player on the spinet, four valets,  a carpenter of threescore,--Challeux, no doubt, who has left us the  story of his woes,--with a crowd of women, children, and eighty-six  camp-followers. To these were added the remnant of Laudonniere's men,  of whom seventeen could bear arms, the rest being sick or disabled by  wounds received in the fight with Outina.    Laudonniere divided his force, such as it was, into two watches,  over which he placed two officers, Saint Cler and La Vigne, gave them  lanterns for going the rounds, and an hour-glass for setting the time;  while he himself, giddy with weakness and fever, was every night at the  guard-room.    It was the night of the nineteenth of September, the season of tempests;  floods of rain drenched the sentries on the rampart, and, as day dawned  on the dripping barracks and deluged parade, the storm increased in  violence. What enemy could venture out on such a night? La Vigne, who  had the watch, took pity on the sentries and on himself, dismissed them,  and went to his quarters. He little knew what human energies, urged by  ambition, avarice, bigotry, and desperation, will dare and do.    To return to the Spaniards at St. Augustine. On the morning of the  eleventh, the crew of one of their smaller vessels, lying outside the  bar, with Menendez himself on board, saw through the twilight of early  dawn two of Ribaut's ships close upon them. Not a breath of air was  stirring. There was no escape, and the Spaniards fell on their knees in  supplication to Our Lady of Utrera, explaining to her that the heretics  were upon them, and begging her to send them a little wind. \"Forthwith,\"  says Mendoza, \"one would have said that Our Lady herself came down upon  the vessel.\" A wind sprang up, and the Spaniards found refuge behind the  bar. The returning day showed to their astonished eyes all the ships  of Ribaut, their decks black with men, hovering off the entrance of the  port; but Heaven had them in its charge, and again they experienced its  protecting care. The breeze sent by Our Lady of Utrera rose to a gale,  then to a furious tempest; and the grateful Adelantado saw through rack  and mist the ships of his enemy tossed wildly among the raging waters  as they struggled to gain an offing. With exultation in his heart, the  skilful seaman read their danger, and saw them in his mind's eye dashed  to utter wreck among the sand-bars and breakers of the lee shore.    A bold thought seized him. He would march overland with five hundred  men, and attack Fort Caroline while its defenders were absent. First he  ordered a mass, and then he called a council. Doubtless it was in that  great Indian lodge of Seloy, where he had made his headquarters;  and here, in this dim and smoky abode, nobles, officers, and priests  gathered at his summons. There were fears and doubts and murmurings, but  Menendez was desperate; not with the mad desperation that strikes wildly  and at random, but the still white heat that melts and burns and seethes  with a steady, unquenchable fierceness. \"Comrades,\" he said, \"the time  has come to show our courage and our zeal. This is God's war, and we  must not flinch. It is a war with Lutherans, and we must wage it with  blood and fire.\"    But his hearers gave no response. They had not a million of ducats  at stake, and were not ready for a cast so desperate. A clamor of  remonstrance rose from the circle. Many voices, that of Mendoza among  the rest, urged waiting till their main forces should arrive. The  excitement spread to the men without, and the swarthy, black-bearded  crowd broke into tumults mounting almost to mutiny, while an officer was  heard to say that he would not go on such a hare-brained errand to  be butchered like a beast. But nothing could move the Adelantado.  His appeals or his threats did their work at last; the confusion was  quelled, and preparation was made for the march.    On the morning of the seventeenth, five hundred arquebusiers and pikemen  were drawn up before the camp. To each was given six pounds of biscuit  and a canteen filled with wine. Two Indians and a renegade Frenchman,  called Francois Jean, were to guide them, and twenty Biscayan axemen  moved to the front to clear the way. Through floods of driving rain, a  hoarse voice shouted the word of command, and the sullen march began.    With dismal misgiving, Mendoza watched the last files as they vanished  in the tempestuous forest. Two days of suspense ensued, when a messenger  came back with a letter from the Adelantado, announcing that he had  nearly reached the French fort, and that on the morrow, September the  twentieth, at sunrise, he hoped to assault it. \"May the Divine Majesty  deign to protect us, for He knows that we have need of it,\" writes the  scared chaplain; \"the Adelantado's great zeal and courage make us hope  he will succeed, but, for the good of his Majesty's service, he ought to  be a little less ardent in pursuing his schemes.\"    Meanwhile the five hundred pushed their march, now toiling across the  inundated savanrias, waist-deep in bulrushes and mud; now filing through  the open forest to the moan and roar of the storm-racked pines: now  hacking their way through palmetto thickets; and now turning from their  path to shun some pool, quagmire, cypress swamp, or \"hummock,\" matted  with impenetrable bushes, brambles, and vines. As they bent before the  tempest, the water trickling from the rusty head-piece crept clammy and  cold betwixt the armor and the skin; and when they made their wretched  bivouac, their bed was the spongy soil, and the exhaustless clouds their  tent.    The night of Wednesday, the nineteenth, found their vanguard in a deep  forest of pines, less than a mile from Fort Caroline, and near the  low hills which extended in its rear, and formed a continuation of  St. John's Bluff. All around was one great morass. In pitchy darkness,  knee-deep in weeds and water, half starved, worn with toil and lack of  sleep, drenched to the skin, their provisions spoiled, their ammunition  wet, and their spirit chilled out of them, they stood in shivering  groups, cursing the enterprise and the author of it. Menendez heard  Fernando Perez, an ensign, say aloud to his comrades: \"This Asturian  Corito, who knows no more of war on shore than an ass, has betrayed  us all. By God, if my advice had been followed, he would have had his  deserts, the day he set out on this cursed journey!\"    The Adelantado pretended not to hear.    Two hours before dawn he called his officers about him. All night, he  said, he had been praying to God and the Virgin.    \"Senores, what shall we resolve on? Our ammunition and provisions are  gone. Our case is desperate.\" And he urged a bold rush on the fort.    But men and officers alike were disheartened and disgusted. They  listened coldly and sullenly; many were for returning at every risk;  none were in the mood for fight. Menendez put forth all his eloquence,  till at length the dashed spirits of his followers were so far revived  that they consented to follow him.    All fell on their knees in the marsh; then, rising, they formed their  ranks and began to advance, guided by the renegade Frenchman, whose  hands, to make sure of him, were tied behind his back. Groping and  stumbling in the dark among trees, roots, and underbrush, buffeted by  wind and rain, and lashed in the face by the recoiling boughs which they  could not see, they soon lost their way, fell into confusion, and came  to a stand, in a mood more savagely desponding than before. But soon a  glimmer of returning day came to their aid, and showed them the dusky  sky, and the dark columns of the surrounding pines. Menendez ordered the  men forward on pain of death. They obeyed, and presently, emerging from  the forest, could dimly discern the ridge of a low hill, behind which,  the Frenchman told them, was the fort. Menendez, with a few officers  and men, cautiously mounted to the top. Beneath lay Fort Caroline, three  bow-shots distant; but the rain, the imperfect light, and a cluster  of intervening houses prevented his seeing clearly, and he sent  two officers to reconnoiter. As they descended, they met a solitary  Frenchman. They knocked him down with a sheathed sword, wounded him,  took him prisoner, kept him for a time, and then stabbed him as they  returned towards the top of the hill. Here, clutching their weapons, all  the gang stood in fierce expectancy.    \"Santiago!\" cried Menendez. \"At them! God is with us! Victory!\" And,  shouting their hoarse war-cries, the Spaniards rushed down the slope  like starved wolves.    Not a sentry was on the rampart. La Vigne, the officer of the guard, had  just gone to his quarters; but a trumpeter, who chanced to remain, saw,  through sheets of rain, the swarm of assailants sweeping down the hill.  He blew the alarm, and at the summons a few half-naked soldiers ran  wildly out of the barracks. It was too late. Through the breaches  and over the ramparts the Spaniards came pouring in, with shouts of  \"Santiago! Santiago!\"    Sick men leaped from their beds. Women and children, blind with fright,  darted shrieking from the houses. A fierce, gaunt visage, the thrust of  a pike, or blow of a rusty halberd,--such was the greeting that met all  alike. Laudonniere snatched his sword and target, and ran towards the  principal breach, calling to his soldiers. A rush of Spaniards met  him; his men were cut down around him; and he, with a soldier named  Bartholomew, was forced back into the yard of his house."]]]
