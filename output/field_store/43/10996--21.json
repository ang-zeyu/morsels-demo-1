[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/444"],[0,"System of Economical Contradictions; Or, The Philosophy of Misery (#17)"],[1,"  makes so many fresh dupes every day.  My complaint of socialism  is not that it has appeared among us without cause, but that it  has clung so long and so obstinately to its silliness.    2. But the economists have erred no less gravely in rejecting a  priori, and just because of the contradictory, or rather  antinomical, nature of value, every idea and hope of reform,  never desiring to understand that, for the very reason that  society has arrived at its highest point of antagonism,  reconciliation and harmony are at hand.  This, nevertheless, is  what a close study of political economy would have shown to its  adepts, had they paid more attention to the lights of modern  metaphysics.  It is indeed demonstrated, by the most positive  evidence known to the human mind, that wherever an antinomy  appears there is a promise of a resolution of its terms, and  consequently an announcement of a coming change.  Now, the idea  of value, as developed by J. B. Say among others, satisfies  exactly these conditions.  But the economists, who have remained  for the most part by an inconceivable fatality ignorant of the  movement of philosophy, have guarded against the supposition that  the essentially contradictory, or, as they say, variable,  character of value might be at the same time the authentic sign  of its constitutionality,--that is, of its eminently harmonious  and determinable nature.  However dishonorable it may be to the  economists of the various schools, it is certain that their  opposition to socialism results solely from this false  conception of their own principles; one proof, taken from a  thousand, will suffice.    The Academy of Sciences (not that of Moral Sciences, but the  other), going outside of its province one day, listened to a  paper in which it was proposed to calculate tables of value for  all kinds of merchandise upon the basis of the average product  per man and per day's labor in each branch of industry.  \"Le  Journal des Economistes\" (August, 1845) immediately made this  communication, intrusive in its eyes, the text of a protest  against the plan of tariff which was its object, and the occasion  of a reestablishment of what it called true principles:--    \"There is no measure of value, no standard of value,\" it said in  its conclusions; \"economic science tells us this, just as  mathematical science tells us that there is no perpetual motion  or quadrature of the circle, and that these never will be found.  Now, if there is no standard of value, if the measure of value is  not even a metaphysical illusion, what then is the law which  governs exchanges? . . . . .  As we have said before, it is, in a  general way, SUPPLY and DEMAND: that is the last word of  science.\"    Now, how did \"Le Journal des Economistes\" prove that there is no  measure of value?  I use the consecrated expression: though I  shall show directly that this phrase, MEASURE OF VALUE, is  somewhat ambiguous, and does not convey the exact meaning which  it is intended, and which it ought, to express.    This journal repeated, with accompanying examples, the exposition  that we have just given of the variability of value, but without  arriving, as we did, at the contradiction.  Now, if the estimable  editor, one of the most distinguished economists of the  school of Say, had had stricter logical habits; if he had been  long used, not only to observing facts, but to seeking their  explanation in the ideas which produce them,--I do not doubt that  he would have expressed himself more cautiously, and that,  instead of seeing in the variability of value the LAST WORD OF  SCIENCE, he would have recognized unaided that it is the first.  Seeing that the variability of value proceeds not from things,  but from the mind, he would have said that, as human liberty has  its law, so value must have its law; consequently, that the  hypothesis of a measure of value, this being the common  expression, is not at all irrational; quite the contrary, that it  is the denial of this measure that is illogical, untenable.    And indeed, what is there in the idea of measuring, and  consequently of fixing, value, that is unscientific?  All men  believe in it; all wish it, search for it, suppose it: every  proposition of sale or purchase is at bottom only a comparison  between two values,--that is, a determination, more or less  accurate if you will, but nevertheless effective.  The opinion of  the human race on the existing difference between real value and  market price may be said to be unanimous.  It is for this reason  that so many kinds of merchandise are sold at a fixed price;  there are some, indeed, which, even in their variations, are  always fixed,--bread, for instance.  It will not be denied that,  if two manufacturers can supply one another by an account  current, and at a settled price, with quantities of their  respective products, ten, a hundred, a thousand manufacturers can  do the same.  Now, that would be a solution of the problem of the  measure of value.  The price of everything would be debated upon,  I allow, because debate is still our only method of fixing  prices; but yet, as all light is the result of conflict, debate,  though it may be a proof of uncertainty, has for its object,  setting aside the greater or less amount of good faith that  enters into it, the discovery of the relation of values to each  other,-- that is, their measurement, their law.    Ricardo, in his theory of rent, has given a magnificent example  of the commensurability of values.  He has shown that arable  lands are to each other as the crops which they yield with the  same outlay; and here universal practice is in harmony with  theory.  Now who will say that this positive and sure method of  estimating the value of land, and in general of all engaged  capital, cannot be applied to products also? . . . . .    They say:  Political economy is not affected by a priori  arguments; it pronounces only upon facts.  Now, facts and  experience teach us that there is no measure of value and can be  none, and prove that, though the conception of such an idea was  necessary in the nature of things, its realization is wholly  chimerical.  Supply and demand is the sole law of exchange.    I will not repeat that experience proves precisely the contrary;  that everything, in the economic progress of society, denotes a  tendency toward the constitution and establishment of value; that  that is the culminating point of political economy--which by this  constitution becomes transformed--and the supreme indication of  order in society: this general outline, reiterated without proof,  would become tiresome.  I confine myself for the moment within  the limits of the discussion, and say that SUPPLY and DEMAND,  held up as the sole regulators of value, are nothing more than  two ceremonial forms serving to bring useful value and  exchangeable value face to face, and to provoke their  reconciliation.  They are the two electric poles, whose  connection must produce the economical phenomenon of affinity  called EXCHANGE.  Like the poles of a battery, supply and demand  are diametrically opposed to each other, and tend continually to  mutual annihilation; it is by their antagonism that the price of  things is either increased, or reduced to nothing: we wish to  know, then, if it is not possible, on every occasion, so to  balance or harmonize these two forces that the price of things  always may be the expression of their true value, the expression  of justice.  To say after that that supply and demand is the law  of exchange is to say that supply and demand is the law of supply  and demand; it is not an explanation of the general practice, but  a declaration of its absurdity; and I deny that the general  practice is absurd.    I have just quoted Ricardo as having given, in a special  instance, a positive rule for the comparison of values: the  economists do better still.  Every year they gather from tables  of statistics the average prices of the various grains.  Now,  what is the meaning of an average?  Every one can see that in a  single operation, taken at random from a million, there is no  means of knowing which prevailed, supply--that is, useful  value--or exchangeable value,--that is, demand.  But as every  increase in the price of merchandise is followed sooner or later  by a proportional reduction; as, in other words, in society the  profits of speculation are equal to the losses,--we may regard  with good reason the average of prices during a complete period  as indicative of the real and legitimate value of products.  This  average, it is true, is ascertained too late: but who knows that  we could not discover it in advance?  Is there an economist who  dares to deny it?    Nolens volens, then, the measure of value must be sought for:  logic commands it, and her conclusions are adverse to  economists and socialists alike.  The opinion which denies  the existence of this measure is irrational, unreasonable.  Say  as often as you please, on the one hand, that political economy  is a science of facts, and that the facts are contrary to the  hypothesis of a determination of value, or, on the other, that  this troublesome question would not present itself in a system of  universal association, which would absorb all antagonism,--I will  reply still, to the right and to the left:--    1. That as no fact is produced which has not its cause, so none  exists which has not its law; and that, if the law of exchange is  not discovered, the fault is, not with the facts, but with the  savants.    2. That, as long as man shall labor in order to live, and shall  labor freely, justice will be the condition of fraternity and the  basis of association; now, without a determination of value,  justice is imperfect, impossible.      % 2.--Constitution of value; definition of wealth.    We know value in its two opposite aspects; we do not know it in  its TOTALITY.

Haight, Cedar City, president of several settlements       south; Bishop Smith, Cedar City; John D. Lee,[69:A] Harmony;       John M. Higby, Cedar City; Bishop Davis, David Tullis, Santa       Clara; Ira Hatch, Santa Clara. These were the cause of the       massacre, aided by others. It is to be regretted that nothing       has yet been accomplished towards bringing these murderers to       justice. I remain,         \"Very respectfully, your obedient servant,         \"J. FORNEY,         \"_Sup't of Indian Affairs, Utah Territory_.         \"Hon. A. B. Greenwood,         \"_Commiss'r Indian Affairs, Washington, D. C._\"    So far as Brigham Young himself is concerned, the evidence is not so  direct, but is scarcely less conclusive.    In addition to the circumstances mentioned, of his failing to report the  massacre, or to make any mention of it in his public discourses, and the  testimony of the Indians, already referred to; in addition also to the  facts concerning the revelation sent from him,--facts communicated by  one intimately acquainted with the secret history of the church; in  addition to these things, if we reflect for a moment upon the framework  of the Mormon Church, we will find therein still more cogent evidence.    The organization of the church is such, that no project of importance is  ever undertaken without the express or implied consent of Young, who is  in temporal, as well as spiritual matters, the head and source of all  authority. Now here was a large train which had lately passed through  the place where Young resided, and his feelings and views in relation to  it would be well known to the leaders of the church. Can it for a moment  be admitted, that members of a community so organized would undertake so  important a project as the destruction of that train, requiring, as it  did, the concerted action of forty or fifty persons, without the express  or implied sanction of him who sat at the head of the community,  controlling its every action?    And if such a thing can be supposed possible, would not the perpetrators  be immediately called to account for assuming so much responsibility?  Reason and evidence all point one way; and add this to the many other  acts which stamp Brigham Young as a murderer of the deepest dye,--adding  to the guilt of homicide that of blasphemy and hypocrisy.    What was the motive which prompted the act? Partly revenge. These  emigrants were from Missouri and Arkansas, the scenes of the alleged  injuries and persecutions of the Mormons. It was soon after the killing  of Parley P. Pratt, in Arkansas, by McLane, whose wife Pratt had  abducted. It was at the time, too, when the United States troops were  marching to Utah, and a feeling of revenge and retaliation was  prevalent, and was, as has been shown, fostered and encouraged by  Brigham in his sermons.    But the principal motive was plunder. The train was a very wealthy one.  The spoil of the gentile was before them, and it must be appropriated by  the Lord's people.    A great portion of the property was taken to Cedar City, deposited in  the tithing office, and there sold out. Forney says, in the Annual  Report already quoted from,--         \"Whoever may have been the perpetrators of this horrible deed,       no doubt exists in my mind that they were influenced chiefly       by a determination to acquire wealth by robbery.\"[71:A]    It is not within the scope of this work to enter into a relation of the  many other murders and outrages committed by the authority or connivance  of the Mormon Church. This is given as the most notable one,--\"_ex uno  disce omnes_.\" Those who wish to examine into these crimes more fully,  are referred to the appendix to the printed speech of Judge Cradlebaugh.    The \"Mormon War\" having closed, the federal officers, as soon as  practicable, assumed their functions, and proceeded to transact  business. Federal courts were held, and the authority of the United  States again, at least nominally, established in Utah.    In October, 1858, Judge Sinclair opened his court in Salt Lake City.  Efforts were made to bring several noted criminals to justice, but  everything failed. In the grand jury-room no indictments were found, and  murderers and thieves were allowed to go \"scot free.\"    At this term of court a motion was made to expel James Ferguson from the  bar, for contempt of court. Ferguson offered to retire from the bar,  which was not accepted. He then proposed to plead guilty; but the Judge  said, as it was alleged that a Judge of the United States had been  insulted and intimidated, when in the discharge of his official duty,  it was important that the country be put in possession of the facts, and  no plea of crimination or stultification should prevent an exposure.    The grand jury did, finally, in this case, make the following  presentment:--         \"The grand jury find, that James Ferguson, of G. S. L. City,       U. T., did use language and threats calculated to intimidate       Judge George P. Stiles, U. S. District Judge, while in the       discharge of his official duties, and presiding as Judge of       this District Court, at the February Term, 1857.         \"ELEAZER MILLER, _Foreman_.\"    The right of trial by jury is one guaranteed by the Constitution, and  with which it would be highly dangerous to interfere, except in cases of  extreme necessity, involving the safety of a whole people or community.  The Mormons, with their usual shrewdness, take advantage of this, and  manage to control the United States Courts through the grand and petit  juries. The following extracts will show how it is done.    March 2d, 1856, in his remarks, made in the Tabernacle, Jedediah M.  Grant, then one of the \"President's\" counsellors, said:--         \"Last Sunday, the President chastised some of the Apostles and       Bishops, who were on the grand jury. Did he fully succeed in       clearing away the fog which surrounded them, and in removing       blindness from their eyes? No, for they could go to their room       and again disagree; though to their credit it must be admitted       that a brief explanation made them unanimous in their action.\"    Again, in the same connection, Grant, speaking of a trial-jury,  continues,--         \"Several have got into the fog, to suck and eat the filth of a       gentile court; _ostensibly_ a court in Utah.\"    Here is the highest evidence of the direct interference of Brigham  Young with the right of trial by jury, and the prostitution of the  jury-box to the accomplishment of his schemes. How could he strike a  more fatal blow at our free institutions, or at the rights and liberties  of American citizens who may happen to live within the sphere of his  influence? For this alone he should be hurled from the defiant position  he occupies, and brought to the bar of impartial justice.    Though the evidence was perfectly plain and conclusive in the case of  Ferguson, he was acquitted. Comment is unnecessary.    The Judge, finding all efforts to bring criminals to justice unavailing,  adjourned his court _sine die_.    The Mormon Legislature had never made provision for defraying the  expenses of the United States Courts, while doing territorial business,  though their attention had frequently been called to the necessity of so  doing. Their object was to throw all the business into the probate  courts; and in this they eventually succeeded, except in the court  presided over by Judge Kinney,--the only one, after the \"war,\" which  acted simply as an adjunct and instrument of the church authorities.         \"During the sitting of Judge Sinclair's court, the Mormon       grand jury promptly found a bill of indictment against one       Ralph Pike, a sergeant in Company I, of the 10th Infantry,       United States Army, for an assault with intent to kill,       committed upon one Howard Spencer, the son of a Mormon bishop,       at the military reserve, in Rush Valley. Upon _capias_ issued,       Pike was arrested, and brought to Great Salt Lake City. The       day following, August 11, 1858, about twelve o'clock, M., as       Pike was entering the Salt Lake House, on Main Street, Spencer       stepped up to him from behind, saying, 'Are you the man that       struck me in Rush Valley?' at the same time, drawing his       pistol, shot him through the side, inflicting a mortal wound.       Spencer ran across the street, mounted his horse, and rode       off, accompanied by several noted 'Danites.' Pike lingered in       dreadful agony, two days, before he died. The 'Deseret News,'       in its next issue, lauded young Spencer for his courage and       bravery.         \"A man by the name of Drown, brought suit upon a promissory       note for $480, against the Danite captain, Bill Hickman. The       case being submitted to the court, Drown obtained a judgment.       A few days afterwards, Drown and a companion, named Arnold       were stopping at the house of a friend in Salt Lake City, when       Hickman, with some seven or eight of his band, rode up to the       house, and called for Drown to come out. Drown, suspecting       foul play, refused to do so, and locked the doors. The Danites       thereupon dismounted from their horses, broke down the doors,       and shot down both Drown and Arnold. Drown died of his wounds       next morning, and Arnold a few days afterwards. Hickman and       his band rode off unmolested.         \"Thus, during a single term of the court, held in a Mormon       community, the warm life-blood of three human"]]]
