Keats  alludes to this in his Endymion, where he describes the lookers-  on at the game of quoits:      \"Or they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent    On either side, pitying the sad death    Of Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath    Of Zephyr slew him; Zephyr penitent,    Who now ere Phoebus mounts the firmament,    Fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.\"    An allusion to Hyacinthus will also be recognized in Milton's  Lycidas:      \"Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe.\"      CEYX AND HALCYONE: OR, THE HALCYON BIRDS    Ceyx was King of Thessaly, where he reigned in peace without  violence or wrong.  He was son of Hesperus, the Day-star, and the  glow of his beauty reminded one of his father.  Halcyone, the  daughter of Aeolus, was his wife, and devotedly attached to him.  Now Ceyx was in deep affliction for the loss of his brother, and  direful prodigies following his brother's death made him feel as  if the gods were hostile to him.  He thought best therefore to  make a voyage to Claros in Ionia, to consult the oracle of  Apollo.  But as soon as he disclosed his intention to his wife  Halcyone, a shudder ran through her frame, and her face grew  deadly pale.  \"What fault of mine, dearest husband, has turned  your affection from me?  Where is that love of me that used to be  uppermost in your thoughts?  Have you learned to feel easy in the  absence of Halcyone?  Would you rather have me away?\"  She also  endeavored to discourage him, by describing the violence of the  winds, which she had known familiarly when she lived at home in  her father's house, Aeolus being the god of the winds, and having  as much as he could do to restrain them.  \"They rush together,\"  said she, \"with such fury that fire flashes from the conflict.  But if you must go,\" she added, \"dear husband, let me go with  you, Otherwise I shall suffer, not only the real evils which you  must encounter, but those also which my fears suggest.\"    These words weighed heavily on the mind of king Ceyx, and it was  no less his own wish than hers to take her with him, but he could  not bear to expose her to the dangers of the sea.  He answered,  therefore, consoling her as well as he could, and finished with  these words: \"I promise, by the rays of my father the Day-star,  that if fate permits I will return before the moon shall have  twice rounded her orb.\"  When he had thus spoken he ordered the  vessel to be drawn out of the ship-house, and the oars and sails  to be put aboard.  When Halcyone saw these preparations she  shuddered, as if with a presentiment of evil.  With tears and  sobs she said farewell, and then fell senseless to the ground.    Ceyx would still have lingered, but now the young men grasped  their oars and pulled vigorously through the waves, with long and  measured strokes.  Halcyone raised her streaming eyes, and saw  her husband standing on the deck, waving his hand to her.  She  answered his signal till the vessel had receded so far that she  could no longer distinguish his form from the rest.  When the  vessel itself could no more be seen, she strained her eyes to  catch the last glimmer of the sail, till that too disappeared.  Then, retiring to her chamber, she threw herself on her solitary  couch.    Meanwhile they glide out of the harbor, and the breeze plays  among the ropes.  The seamen draw in their oars, and hoist their  sails.  When half or less of their course was passed, as night  drew on, the sea began to whiten with swelling waves, and the  east wind to blow a gale.  The master gives the word to take in  sail, but the storm forbids obedience, for such is the roar of  the winds and waves that his orders are unheard.  The men, of  their own accord, busy themselves to secure the oars, to  strengthen the ship, to reef the sail.  While they thus do what  to each one seems best, the storm increases.  The shouting of the  men, the rattling of the shrouds, and the dashing of the waves,  mingle with the roar of the thunder.  The swelling sea seems  lifted up to the heavens, to scatter its foam among the clouds;  then sinking away to the bottom assumes the color of the shoal,  a Stygian blackness.    The vessel obeys all these changes.  It seems like a wild beast  that rushes on the spears of the hunters.  Rain falls in  torrents, as if the skies were coming down to unite with the sea.  When the lightning ceases for a moment, the night seems to add  its own darkness to that of the storm; then comes the flash,  rending the darkness asunder, and lighting up all with a glare.  Skill fails, courage sinks, and death seems to come on every  wave.  The men are stupefied with terror.  The thought of  parents, and kindred, and pledges left at home, comes over their  minds.  Ceyx thinks of Halcyone.  No name but hers is on his  lips, and while he yearns for her, he yet rejoices in her  absence.  Presently the mast is shattered by a stroke of  lightning, the rudder broken, and the triumphant surge curling  over looks down upon the wreck, then falls, and crushes it to  fragments.  Some of the seamen, stunned by the stroke, sink, and  rise no more; others cling to fragments of the wreck.  Ceyx, with  the hand that used to grasp the sceptre, holds fast to a plank,  calling for help,   alas, in vain,   upon his father and his  father-in-law.  But oftenest on his lips was the name of  Halcyone.  His thoughts cling to her.  He prays that the waves  may bear his body to her sight, and that it may receive burial at  her hands.  At length the waters overwhelm him, and he sinks.  The Day-star looked dim that night.  Since it could not leave the  heavens, it shrouded its face with clouds.    In the mean while Halcyone, ignorant of all these horrors,  counted the days till her husband's promised return.  Now she  gets ready the garments which he shall put on, and now what she  shall wear when he arrives.  To all the gods she offers frequent  incense but more than all to Juno.  For her husband, who was no  more, she prayed incessantly; that he might be safe; that he  might come home; that he might not, in his absence, see any one  that he would love better than her.  But of all these prayers,  the last was the only one destined to be granted.  The goddess,  at length, could not bear any longer to be pleaded with for one  already dead, and to have hands raised to her altars, that ought  rather to be offering funeral rites.  So, calling Iris, she said,  \"Iris, my faithful messenger, go to the drowsy dwelling of  Somnus, and tell him to send a vision to Halcyone, in the form of  Ceyx, to make known to her the event.\"    Iris puts on her robe of many colors, and tingeing the sky with  her bow, seeks the palace of the King of Sleep. Near the  Cimmerian country, a mountain cave is the abode of the dull god,  Somnus,  Here Phoebus dares not come, either rising, or at  midday, or setting.  Clouds and shadows are exhaled from the  ground, and the light glimmers faintly.  The bird of dawn, with  crested head, never calls aloud there to Aurora, nor watchful  dog, nor more sagacious goose disturbs the silence.  (This  comparison of the dog and the goose is a reference by Ovid to a  passage in Roman history.)  No wild beast, nor cattle, nor branch  moved with the wind, nor sound of human conversation, breaks the  stillness.  Silence reigns there; and from the bottom of the rock  the River Lethe flows, and by its murmur invites to sleep.  Poppies grow abundantly before the door of the cave, and other  herbs, from whose juices Night collects slumbers, which she  scatters over the darkened earth.  There is no gate to the  mansion, to creak on its hinges, nor any watchman; but in the  midst, a couch of black ebony, adorned with black plumes and  black curtains.  There the god reclines, his limbs relaxed with  sleep.  Around him lie dreams, resembling all various forms, as  many as the harvest bears stalks, or the forest leaves, or the  seashore grains of sand.    As soon as the goddess entered and brushed away the dreams that  hovered around her, her brightness lit up all the cave.  The god,  scarce opening his eyes, and ever and anon dropping his beard  upon his breast, at last shook himself free from himself, and  leaning on his arm, inquired her errand,   for he knew who she  was.  She answered, \"Somnus, gentlest of the gods, tranquillizer  of minds and soother of careworn hearts, Juno sends you her  commands that you dispatch a dream to Halcyone, in the city of  Trachinae, representing her lost husband and all the events of  the wreck.\"    Having delivered her message, Iris hasted away, for she could not  longer endure the stagnant air, and as she felt drowsiness  creeping over her, she made her escape, and returned by her bow  the way she came.  Then Somnus called one of his numerous sons,  Morpheus,   the most expert at counterfeiting forms, and in  imitating the walk, the countenance, and mode of speaking, even  the clothes and attitudes most characteristic of each.  But he  only imitates men, leaving it to another to personate birds,  beasts, and serpents.  Him they call Icelos; and Phantasos is a  third, who turns himself into rocks, waters, woods, and other  things without life.  These wait upon kings and great personages  in their sleeping hours, while others move among the common  people.  Somnus chose, from all the brothers, Morpheus, to  perform the command of Iris; then laid his head on his pillow and  yielded himself to grateful repose.    Morpheus flew, making no noise with his wings, and soon came to  the Haemonian city, where, laying aside his wings, he assumed the  form of Ceyx.  Under that form, but pale like a dead man, naked,  he stood before the couch of the wretched wife.  His beard seemed  soaked with water, and water trickled from his drowned locks.  Leaning over the bed, tears streaming from his eyes, he said, \"Do  you recognize your Ceyx, unhappy wife, or has death too much  changed my visage?  Behold me, know"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33407"],[0,"Bee and Butterfly: A Tale of Two Cousins (#17)"],[1,"girlhood. Finding her  loath to converse her father relapsed into silence, and the breakfast  ended drearily.    Then he left, and Bee sat down on the verandah steps to face the  situation. It was over. All the delightful companionship, the long  walks, the cataloguing,--everything. She dropped her head into her  hands, and sobbed.    \"Beatrice Raymond,\" said the voice of Percival, \"what in the world is  the matter? I have called twice and you did not answer.\"    \"I didn't hear you.\" Bee raised her head, and looked at him dully.    \"Are you mad at me?\" he queried.    \"No.\"    \"You didn't think that I would ever come over to see you again, did  you?\" asked the Prodigy seating himself beside her with easy grace.    \"I did not think anything about it,\" replied the girl shortly.    \"You are cross,\" exclaimed Percival in aggrieved tones. \"If you are not  mad, I don't see why you should be cross to me. Aren't you mad?\"    \"No, no,\" returned Bee impatiently. \"See here, Percival! I am in  trouble. Won't you go away, and not bother me?\"    The boy rose slowly.    \"Of course, if I bother you, I'll go,\" he said with dignity. \"If you are  in trouble you ought not to be left alone. Thinking is bad, my mother  says. Where is your father?\"    \"He has gone away,\" replied Bee briefly. \"He won't be back until  tonight.\"    \"Then I am not going,\" declared Percival firmly. \"That is, not unless  you will go with me. Why can't you come over and stay with mamma and me,  Beatrice?\"    \"I don't want to,\" said Bee miserably. \"I just want to be left alone.\"    \"That is what I'm not going to do,\" declared the boy obstinately. \"You  ought not to be, you know. I'll tell you what: come over, and let me  play to you. That will drive all your troubles away.\"    \"If I go over for a little while to listen to you, will you let me come  home alone? I don't wish to be rude, Percival, but I am very unhappy.\"    \"If you will come over for a time you may do anything you please,\" said  the lad earnestly. \"I am sorry if I seem to bother, but when I am  troubled music puts everything all right. It's the same with mamma, and  with old Heinrich, and with lots of people. I just believe that it will  help you too, or I should not insist. Now, come, Butterfly.\"    \"You are very nice to me, Percival,\" said Beatrice, touched. \"Nicer than  you ought to be, because I have not been good to you this morning. But I  just can't be pleasant to any one.\"    \"I know.\" The boy nodded his head sagaciously. \"I feel that way too,  sometimes.\"    \"And, Percival, you must not call me Butterfly. Butterflies are pretty  and only good-looking people should be called so. I have a cousin who is  very beautiful. We always called her that, but they call me Bee.\"    \"And bees make honey, don't they? I like honey, and I like bees. I think  I like them better than I do butterflies. They have a sting, too, don't  they?\"    \"Yes,\" answered the girl.    \"You have too. That is, you can say some sharp things. I think bee suits  you better than the other because you do things. I am going to call you  Beefly. Butterflies never do anything, do they?\"    \"They don't need to do anything,\" sighed Bee. \"It's only homely insects  that need to work.\"    Percival made no answer, and silently they went through the orchard and  across the field, and through the hedge into the garden beyond. Mrs.  Medulla greeted them pleasantly, as they entered.    \"Good morning, Beatrice,\" she said, noting the girl's paleness  instantly. \"You have made quite a conquest of my son. He has never taken  so to a girl before.\"    \"She's different,\" spoke Percival sententiously, adjusting the music on  the rack, and picking up his violin. \"Other girls don't think of  anything but dresses and things to wear. She doesn't tag after a fellow  either. I like her. You must not talk any more, mamma. She is troubled,  and I'm going to play to make her feel better.\"    \"Very well,\" said the lady, with a faint smile. \"Sit here by me, my  dear,\" she added kindly to Beatrice.    The girl sank into a low chair by her side, comforted in spite of  herself by their kindness. Presently the young violinist began to play.  Beatrice listened perfunctorily at first, but pretty soon she found  herself caught, and held by his wonderful playing. On and on he played,  not watching her with challenging, curious eyes to note the effect as  before, but, like the true artist that he was, bending earnestly to the  task of bringing comfort and consolation to her heart.    It was Beethoven that touched her most. Under the influence of his  divine music Bee felt her heart strings relax, and as the mighty climax  of the last movement swelled into ecstacy, infinite as the human soul,  she burst into a flood of tears. At a glance from his mother Percival  stole softly into the house, while the lady drew the girl into her arms.    \"There!\" she said, smoothing her hair gently. \"That will do you good, my  child.\"    Petting was what the girl needed, and soon her emotion spent itself.  When at last she was calm she looked up contritely.    \"I should not have come over, and made so much trouble,\" she said.  \"Forgive me, Mrs. Medulla; I will go home now. Thank you--\"    \"My dear,\" spoke the lady, drawing her back into her embrace, \"suppose  you tell me all about it.\"    Beatrice looked at her quickly, but seeing the sympathy in the older  woman's eyes she broke out impulsively:    \"I will. I will tell you the whole thing.\" Rapidly she poured forth all  her grief. Told of Adele's changing the pictures, of her father's return  and of his mistake in taking Adele for his daughter; of her cousin's  beauty, and of her efforts to be like her; of her studies with her  father; of the butterfly dinner, and of her belief that with time she  could win his love; and finally of Adele's coming; ending with, \"If only  I were pretty my father would love me, I know. If only I were pretty!\"    \"That is a woman's cry, child,\" observed the lady thoughtfully. \"The  desire for beauty is in every feminine heart. A pretty complexion, a  captivating dimple, bright eyes and flowing tresses are desired more  than all knowledge of books, or graces of the mind.\"    \"I know,\" sighed the girl.    \"Now, dear, you and I are going to have a little talk.\"    \"Dear lady,\" spoke Bee in pleading tones, \"don't, don't tell me that  'Handsome is that handsome does,' or that beauty of mind and soul will  cause others to forget that one is homely. Father says that too, but he  would not have come had he not thought that his daughter was a beautiful  girl.\"    \"I am not going to say those things, child.\" Mrs. Medulla laughed. \"I am  not fond of platitudes myself, although there is much truth in them.  Now, child, you feel hard toward your cousin for changing those  pictures, don't you?\"    Bee compressed her lips, and her eyes flashed.    \"Yes,\" she said in a low tone, \"and I'll never forgive her. Never!\"    \"Wait a minute, dear. It was not a nice thing, nor a kind thing for her  to do, though I think it must have been pure girlish mischief. However,  we are not concerned with that part of it. Beatrice, when would your  father have come home had he not received the picture?\"    \"Why! not for two more years,\" cried Bee, a startled look flashing  across her face.    \"Exactly. Then if the exchange had not been made you would not have had  the pleasure of your father's company at all this summer, would you?\"    \"N-no.\"    \"Would you rather have him here now, even though such a mistake has been  made, than to wait two years longer to see him?\"    \"Yes, yes, yes,\" cried Bee with intensity. \"Oh, I don't see now how I  could have borne to wait longer.\"    \"Then, my dear, how about that feeling toward your cousin? Good has come  out of it, no matter how she meant it. If you will think of that part of  it, it will help you to feel toward her as you used to do, and you must  do that, my child, for your own sake. Now whenever any hard thought of  her comes, just think that she brought him back to you. It won't be easy  at first, my dear, but you can do it. We will let that be, and pass on  to other things. The case interests me very much, and I would like you  to be so successful in winning his love that there would be no one of  whom he would be so fond. Perhaps I can help you.\"    \"If you will, I will do anything in the world for you,\" cried the girl  earnestly.    \"I am satisfied that it can be done, Beatrice. You were on the way to  its accomplishment already. Your cousin's coming may make a slight  difference for a time, but it will only be temporary. You yourself are  liable to spoil everything.\"    \"I?\" Beatrice looked her surprise.    \"Yes; you will see as I talk. Now, Beatrice, answer me one question: in  your studies you have always been first, have you not?\"    \"Yes. How did you know?\"    \"Never mind about that. Which did you enjoy most: gaining a high mark  without any competition, or getting one when others were striving for it  too?\"    \"I liked best when I had to work hard to get ahead of others.\"    \"I thought so. Look at this from the same standpoint. Gain your father's  love in spite of your cousin's beauty, and his admiration for her. It  will be a greater triumph than to gain it when she is not with you.\"    \"Yes; it would,\" acknowledged Bee, \"but--\"    \"Your first mistake, my dear, for you are a little to blame for the  state of things,\" went on the lady, \"was on that first night. You should  have laughed at the blunder as of no consequence. I can see how such a  course would be impossible to one of your temperament, for you are very  intense, and the thing seemed a little short of tragic to you. That is  past. Think no more of it. Your second mistake was in trying to make  yourself like your cousin. That was a confession of weakness.\"    \"It was as the animals do to protect themselves from enemies,\" explained  Bee. \"It is called protective mimicry.\"    \"I don't know what it is called, child."]]]
