They are in disguise as peasants, and  no suspicion will, I hope, arise as to their real position. Not  that the marquis thought it probable they would be included in  the order of arrest, but he said there was no knowing now to what  lengths the mob might go and he thought it better that they should  disappear altogether for the present. Ernest and Jules went away  in disguise with Monsieur du Tillet. After seeing the young ladies  in safety this morning I went down to see what had happened at your  father's mansion, in order to assuage Mademoiselle de St. Caux's  anxiety respecting your safety, and found, as I expected, that  the duke had been arrested, and learned that a party were inside  waiting to arrest you on your return.    \"I thank you indeed,\" Victor said, \"and most warmly. I do not  know what to do. My father is most anxious that I should cross the  frontier, but I cannot go so long as he and Marie are in danger.\"    \"If you enter Paris as you are,\" Harry said, \"you are certain to  be arrested. Your only chance would be to do as I have done, namely  to disguise yourself and take a small lodging, where you might live  unsuspected.\"    \"And in that way I can see Marie sometimes,\" Victor said.    \"You could do so,\" Harry agreed, in a somewhat hesitating way, \"but  it would greatly add to her danger, and, were you detected, might  lead to the discovery of her disguise. Besides, the thought that  you were liable to arrest at any time would naturally heighten the  anxiety from which she is suffering as to the fate of her father  and mother.\"    \"But I cannot and will not run away and leave them all here in  danger,\" Victor said passionately.    \"I would not advise you to do so,\" Harry replied. \"I would only  suggest, that after seeing Mademoiselle de St. Caux once, you  should lead her to believe that you have decided upon making for  the frontier, and she will therefore have the happiness of believing  that you are safe, while you are still near and watching over her.\"    \"That is all very well,\" Victor said; \"but what opinion would she  have of me if she thought me capable of deserting her in that way?\"    \"You would represent that you were obeying the duke's orders; and  besides, if you did suffer in her opinion it would be but temporarily,  for when she learned the truth, that you had only pretended to  leave in order that her position might be the safer and that her  mind might be relieved, she could only think more highly of you.  Besides, if necessary, you could at any time again present yourself  before her.\"    \"Your counsel is good, Monsieur Sandwith, and I will, at anyrate  for a time, follow it. As you say, I can at anytime reappear.  Where are you lodging? I will take a room near, and we can meet  and compare notes and act together.\"    Harry gave him his address.    \"You have only to walk upstairs to the top story. My room is the  one directly opposite the top of the stairs.\"    \"I will call on you to-morrow morning,\" Victor said. \"I will ride  my horse a few miles back and turn him loose in some quiet place,  and buy at the first village a blouse and workman's pantaloons.\"    \"I think,\" Harry said, \"that would be unwise, count; it would look  strange in the extreme for a gentleman dressed as you are to make  such a purchase. You might be at once arrested, or a report of the  circumstance might be sent into Paris and lead to your discovery.  If you will wait here for half an hour I will go back and buy you  the things you want at the first shop I come to and bring them out  to you. Then you can ride back and loose the horse as you propose;  but I should advise you to hide the saddle and bridle, as well as  the clothes you are now wearing, most carefully. Whoever finds your  horse will probably appropriate it and will say nothing about it,  so that all clue to your movements will be lost, and it will be  supposed that you have ridden to the frontier.\"    \"Peste, Monsieur Sandwith! You seem to have a head ready for all  emergencies. I know what a high opinion the marquis had of you,  and I perceive that it is fully justified, and consider myself as  fortunate indeed in having you for a friend in such a time as the  present.\"    \"We have need of all our wits,\" Harry said quietly. \"The marquis  was good enough to accept my offer to do all that I could to look  after the safety of mesdemoiselles, and if I fail in my trust it  will not, I hope, be from any lack of care or courage.\"    The meeting had taken place at a point where it could not be observed  from the gate, and the count withdrew a few hundred yards farther  away while Harry went back into Paris. The latter had no difficulty  in purchasing the clothes required by the count and returned with  them in little over a quarter of an hour, and then, having seen  De Gisons ride off, he sauntered back into Paris and made his way  towards the heart of the city.    Crossing the river he found a vast crowd gathered in front of the  Hotel de Ville. The news of the wholesale arrests which had been  made during the night had filled the populace with joy, and the air  was full of shouts of \"Down with the Aristocrats!\" \"Vive Danton!  Vive Marat! Vive Robespierre!\" Hawkers were selling, in the crowd,  newspapers and broadsheets filled with the foulest attacks, couched  in the most horrible language, upon the king, the queen, and the  aristocracy.    At various points men, mounted upon steps or the pedestals of  statues, harangued the mob while from time to time the crowd opened  and made way for members of the city council, who were cheered or  hooted according to their supposed sentiments for or against the  cause of the people. After remaining there for some time Harry  made his way to the entrance to the Assembly. A crowd was gathered  here, and a tremendous rush was made when the doors were opened.  Harry managed to force his way in and sat for some hours listening to  the debate, which was constantly interrupted by the people in the  galleries, who applauded with frenzy the speeches of their favourite  orators, the deputies of the Mountain, as the bank of seats occupied  by the Jacobin members was named, and howled and yelled when the  Girondists ventured to advocate moderation or conciliation.    It was late in the evening before the sitting was over, and Harry  was unable to leave his place earlier. Then he went and had supper  at a wineshop, and after sauntering on the Boulevards until the  streets began to be deserted he again crossed the river and made  his way to the mansion. Not a light was to be seen in the windows  and all was still and quiet. The great door stood open. The work  of destruction was complete; the house was stripped of everything  that could be carried away.    Harry made his way up to the bedroom of the marquis. The massive  bedstead still stood in its place, having defied the efforts  of destruction which had proved successful with the cabinets and  other furniture. Sitting down on the floor Harry counted the boards  beneath the bed, and then taking out a strong knife which he had  purchased during the day he inserted it by the side of the middle  board and tried to raise it. It yielded without difficulty to his  effort.    As soon as it was lifted he groped in the cavity below it, and his  hand soon came in contact with the heavy bag. Taking this out and  putting it beneath his blouse he replaced the board and made his  way downstairs. He felt too fatigued to walk across Paris again,  and therefore made his way down to the river and curled himself  up for the night at the foot of the wood pile where the girls had  found shelter in the morning, and, in spite of the novelty of his  situation, fell instantly asleep.    It was broad daylight when he woke, and an hour later he regained  his lodgings, stopping by the way to breakfast at a quiet estaminet  frequented by the better class of workmen. As when he had sallied  out the day before, he was fortunate in meeting no one as he made  his way up the stairs to his room. His first step was to get up  a board and to deposit beneath it the bag of money. Then, having  changed his clothes, he went out and made a variety of purchases  for housekeeping, as he did not wish to be obliged to take his  meals at places where anyone sitting at the table with him might  enter into conversation.    His French was quite good enough to pass in the salon of the  marquis, but his ignorance of the Parisian slang spoken among the  working-classes would have rendered it difficult for him to keep  up his assumed character among them, and would have needed the  fabrication of all sorts of stories as to his birthplace and past  history.    Although in the position in which he was placed Harry felt that it  would be impossible always to adhere to the truth, he shrank from  any falsehoods that could possibly be avoided.    His first duty in order to carry out the task he had undertaken was  to keep up his disguise, and this must be done even at the cost of  telling lies as to his antecedents; but he was determined that he  would avoid this unpleasant necessity as far as lay in his power.    At nine o'clock he made his way to the apartments of Louise Moulin.  His entry was received with a cry of satisfaction from the girls.    \"What is the news, Harry?\" Jeanne exclaimed. \"We expected you here  yesterday evening, and sat up till ten o'clock.\"    \"I was over the other side of the river discharging a mission your  father had confided to me, and did not get back till this morning.\"    \"I knew he was prevented by something,\" Jeanne said triumphantly.  \"I told you so, Marie--didn't I?\"    \"Yes, dear, I was wrong to be impatient; but you will forgive me,  Harry? You can guess how I suffered yesterday.\"    \"It was natural you should expect me, mademoiselle. I was sorry  afterwards that I did not tell you when I left you that I should  not be able"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37856"],[0,"The Determined Angler and the Brook Trout (#17)"],[1,"offers specimens of its own kind so deeply in  contrast as _fontinalis_. This is scientifically and interestingly  illustrated in many ways--color, size, shape, form, action,  environment, etc. For example, consider the big, fat, long, strong,  copper-color brook trout that, having access to salt water,  gormandizes upon the multitudinous food of the sea--shrimp, killifish,  spearing, spawn, crab, etc.--and the tiny, active, silvery albinolike  brook trout that is locked in a small foamy basin under a dashing  waterfall, feeding only upon minute crustacea and the insect life that  is carried to its watery prison. These two specimens are not freakish  individuals of their species--like the blunt-nose specimen and the  various other deformities--but are quite common contrasting  representatives of their tribe.    If we were to display in a group side by side one of each of the  shape-and-color-differing specimens--one large copper-shade, sea-going  brook trout, one tiny silvery, fountain-locked brook trout, one  ordinary-environed brook trout, one blunt-nose brook trout, etc.--the  fact of their being of an identical species would be correctly  appreciated by the scientific man only.    I am not resorting to poetic license or theorizing or delving into  ancient precedents to carry my point of natural history, for I once  captured one of the big, sea-going specimens, and my friend, James  Cornell, angling in an adjacent stream the same day, brought to creel  a little silvery beauty of the foamy waterfall. Shape, form, tint,  weight--every mood and trait--were of astounding contrast in these two  specimens, yet both were of the same species, the true brook trout; my  dark, strenuous three-pounder taken in the open, brackish creek as I  cast from the salt meadowland sod banks, and Cornell's albinolike  gamester succumbing to the fly in the foamy fountain of a deep  woodland brook; both specimens widely separated in appearance, habits,  and habitat, but still both legitimate brothers of the family  _fontinalis_--little salmon of the streams.    Trout in the sea feed on shrimp, the spawn of herring, and on the  entrails of cod and other species of fishes thrown away by market  fishermen.    If the sea-going trout did not eat the spawn of the herring, herring  would be too plentiful for Nature's even-distribution arrangement. The  sea trout is gorged with herring spawn, which lies in heaps like so  much sawdust on the shores and shallow places of the ocean. Cod spawn  and milt float on the water's surface; the spawn of the herring sinks.    The sea trout fresh from the streams is plump, has bright red spots,  and is in ordinary color when it goes to sea; when it returns to the  streams, though bigger (longer) and stronger, it is comparatively  thin, and is of white or silver-sheened shade.    Prof. George Brown Goode (_American Fishes_): \"The identity of the  Canadian sea trout and the brook trout is still denied by many, though  the decision of competent authorities has settled the question beyond  doubt.\"    Eugene McCarthy (_Familiar Fish_): \"Many Anglers are now turning their  attention to catching sea trout, either on account of the novelty of  the sport or because they believe that they are taking a new variety  of fish. That there is novelty in such fishing cannot be denied, but  that the fish is new in any way certainly can be.... There is no doubt  that the sea trout and the brook trout are one and the same fish. It  is broadly claimed that any of the trout can live as well in salt  water as they can in fresh water, and everything seems to prove the  claim to be correct. All trout grow to a larger size in salt water  than in the brooks or rivers, and they lose their spots in the sea,  becoming pale and silvery in color. Brook trout were originally found  at a distance not greater than three hundred miles back from the ocean  in waters tributary to it. Where conditions of temperature were  favorable, they invariably sought salt water. When transplanted to, or  found in, inland waters, they have adapted themselves to fresh-water  conditions as well. All members of the trout family require cold water  for their habitat, averaging about 68 degrees or less. Therefore, they  must either seek the cold water of the ocean, or, if barred from that  by long stretches of warm-river waters, they must seek the cold, small  tributaries high up in the hills. While trout are found in the  highland streams south of New York as far as South Carolina, they are  not able to seek the sea on account of the warm, intervening waters.  In Long Island (N. Y.) streams all trout are sea-going. From that  point along the coast northward sea trout are rarely, if ever, found  until the northern shores of Maine and New Brunswick are reached. All  rivers flowing into the St. Lawrence as far west as Quebec, as well as  those entering the Saguenay and those of the Labrador coast, are  especially noted for most excellent sea trout fishing, and are the  favorite resorts of Anglers.... In all ways the sea trout corresponds  with the brook trout when taken in fresh water. If taken in salt  water, there will only be the variation of coloring. ... ouananiche  ... and sea trout ... with the exception of salmon ... afford the  greatest sport that the Angler can find.... Exactly the same tackle is  used (for sea trout) as for ouananiche, trout, or bass, and the same  flies, both in kind and size.... When the fish begin to leave the sea  and ascend the rivers, the bright colorings not only return, but  actually appear to be more beautiful than those of the trout that  always remain in fresh water.... But little attention, comparatively  speaking, has been given to sea trout, principally because their  nature was not understood, and, in fact, but little has been said or  written in regard to them to arouse interest. The lessees of the sea  trout streams on Long Island are very enthusiastic over the fishing  they secure, as are those sportsmen who have sought it in Canada. The  Canadian rivers are now more quickly and easily reached than formerly,  and as the fish are rapidly acquiring fame they are bound to become  much sought after by Anglers. However, sea trout fishing is but  fishing for brook trout under different conditions, and amid varied  surroundings. They offer, however, two extra inducements--they are  more plentiful and usually average larger.\"    Charles Hallock (_Sportsman's Gazetteer_) refers to the common theory  that sea trout (Canada) are merely a clan or detachment of the brook  trout which have temporarily left their fresh-water haunts for the  sea; then Mr. Hallock asks: \"But, if we must accept this as a  postulate, we must be permitted to ask why the same peculiarities do  not attach to the trout of Maine. Cape Cod, and Long Island? Why do we  not discover here this periodical midsummer advent and 'run' of six  weeks' duration; and why are only isolated individuals taken in the  salt-water pound nets and fykes of Long Island, etc., instead of  thousands, as in Canada? Moreover, the Canadian sea trout are never  taken in the small streams, but only in rivers of considerable size,  and the same trout uniformly return to the same river, just as salmon  do--at least, we infer so from the fact that six-pounders are  invariably found in the Nouvelle, and varying sizes elsewhere.  Besides, we must be able to answer why a portion only of the trout in  a given stream should periodically visit the sea at a specified time,  while an equal or greater number elect to remain behind in fresh  water; for we may suppose that, having equal opportunities, all have  the same instincts and desires.\"    But, trout of different localities do not have equal opportunities;  therefore, they have not the same instincts and desires. Local  conditions of Nature everywhere guide the instincts and govern the  desires of every living thing. So, the trout of Maine, the trout of  Cape Cod, the trout of Long Island--influenced by local  conditions--are all vastly different in opportunities, instincts,  desires, etc. The Eskimo biped, the African biped--the bipeds of all  countries--are all species of the animal man, but who dare suggest  that they all have equal (similar) opportunities and the same  instincts and desires?    Even individuals of the trout of one community are profoundly  separated in character from their immediate brothers and sisters.  Trout vary in their tastes and antics as they vary in color, shape,  and size. There are hundreds of natural trout flies and hundreds of  artificial trout flies, imitations of the living insects, used as  lures in fishing. Why so many patterns? Because the trout, like man,  is in love with a variety of foods at different times, and both man  and trout change in their tastes by the month, the week, the day, the  hour, and the minute.    The Angler does not have to use the hundreds of fly patterns at one  fishing, but he does experiment with a variety of the lures to find  the particular patterns the fish is responsive to at the moment. One  or two patterns would suffice--if the Angler could select the  particular species the trout are rising to without trying all the  patterns until he discovers the killing patterns. A chef might please  his master with one or two of the forty courses billed if he knew what  the man wanted. Sometimes the Angler can judge the appropriate fly to  use by observing Nature in seeing trout rise to the live fly; but  there are times when trout are not rising, times when they are tired  of the fly upon the water, and times when the real fly is not on the  wing.    General rules are of no service without a deep regard for general  conditions, local and otherwise. All trout must not be judged alike  even if they be of one species and in one little pool. Individuals of  man, though of one race and in one district, are not all alike in  their habits any more than they are in their shades, shapes,"]]]
