The tent cloth is usually of thin Moose leather, dressed and made by the  Indians, and in shape it nearly resembles a fan-mount inverted; so that  when the largest curve incloses the bottom of the poles, the smaller one  is always sufficient to cover the top; except a hole, which is  designedly left open to serve the double purpose of chimney and window.    The fire is always made on the ground in the center, and the remainder  of the floor, or bottom of the tent, is covered all over with small  branches of the pine tree, {20} which serve both for seats and beds. A  quantity of pine tops and branches are laid round the bottom of the  poles on the outside, over which the eaves of the tent is staked down; a  quantity of snow is then packed over all, which excludes great part of  the external air, and contributes greatly to the warmth within. The tent  here described is such as is made use of by the Southern Indians, and  the same with which I was furnished at the Factory; for that made use of  by the Northern Indians is made of different materials, and is of a  quite different shape, as shall be described hereafter.    [Sidenote: 1770. March.]    The situation of our tent at this time was truly pleasant,[32]  particularly for a spring residence; being on a small elevated point,  which commanded an extensive prospect over a large lake, the shores of  which abounded with wood of different kinds, such as pine, larch, birch,  and poplar; and in many places was beautifully contrasted with a variety  of high hills, that shewed their snowy summits above the tallest woods.  About two hundred yards from the tent was a fall, or rapid, which the  swiftness of the current prevents from freezing in the coldest winters.  At the bottom of this fall, which empties itself into the above lake,  was a fine sheet of open water near a mile in length, and at least half  a mile in breadth; by the margin of which we had our fishing nets set,  all in open view from the tent.    {21} The remaining part of this month passed on without any  interruption, or material occurrence, to disturb our repose, worth  relating: our fishing nets provided us with daily food, and the Indians  had too much philosophy about them to give themselves much additional  trouble; for during the whole time not one of them offered to look for a  partridge, or anything else which could yield a change of diet.    As the time may now be supposed to have lain heavy on my hands, it may  not be improper to inform the reader how I employed it. In the first  place, I embraced every favourable opportunity of observing the latitude  of the place, the mean of which was 58 deg. 46' 30\" North; and the longitude  by account was 5 deg. 57' West, from Prince of Wales's Fort. I then  corrected my reckoning from my last observation; brought up my journal,  and filled up my chart, to the place of our residence. I built also some  traps, and caught a few martins; and by way of saving my ammunition, set  some snares for partridges. The former is performed by means of a few  logs, so arranged that when the martin attempts to take away the bait  laid for him, he with very little struggle pulls down a small post that  supports the whole weight of the trap; when, if the animal be not killed  by the weight of the logs, he is confined till he be frozen to death, or  killed by the hunter going his rounds.    [Sidenote: 1770. April.]    {22} To snare partridges requires no other process than making a few  little hedges across a creek, or a few short hedges projecting at right  angles from the side of an island of willows, which those birds are  found to frequent. Several openings must be left in each hedge, to admit  the birds to pass through, and in each of them a snare must be set; so  that when the partridges are hopping along the edge of the willows to  feed, which is their usual custom, some of them soon get into the  snares, where they are confined till they are taken out. I have caught  from three to ten partridges in a day by this simple contrivance; which  requires no further attendance than going round them night and morning.    [Sidenote: 1st.]    I have already observed that nothing material happened to disturb our  repose till the first of April, when to our great surprise the fishing  nets did not afford us a single fish. Though some of the preceding days  had been pretty successful, yet my companions, like true Indians, seldom  went to sleep till they had cleared the tent of every article of  provision. As nothing was to be caught in the nets, we all went out to  angle; but in this we were equally unsuccessful, as we could not procure  one fish the whole day. This sudden change of circumstances alarmed one  of my companions so much, that he began to think of resuming the use of  his gun, after having laid it by for near a month.    {23} Early in the morning we arose; when my guide Conne-e-quese went a  hunting, and the rest attended the nets and hooks near home; but all  with such bad success, that we could not procure enough in one day to  serve two men for a supper. This, instead of awakening the rest of my  companions, sent them to sleep; and scarcely any of them had the  prudence to look at the fishing nets, though they were not more than two  or three hundred yards from the tent door.    [Sidenote: 1770. April.]    My guide, who was a steady man, and an excellent hunter, having for many  years been accustomed to provide for a large family, seemed by far the  most industrious of all my crew; he closely pursued his hunting for  several days, and seldom returned to the tent till after dark, while  those at the tent passed most of their time in smoking and sleeping.    [Sidenote: 10th.]    Several days passed without any signs of relief, till the 10th, when my  guide continued out longer than ordinary, which made us conjecture that  he had met with strangers, or seen some deer, or other game, which  occasioned his delay. We all therefore lay down to sleep, having had but  little refreshment for the three preceding days, except a pipe of  tobacco and a draught of water; even partridges had become so scarce  that not one was to be got; the heavy thaws had driven them all out  towards the barren grounds. About midnight, to our {24} great joy, our  hunter arrived, and brought with him the blood and fragments of two deer  that he had killed. This unexpected success soon roused the sleepers,  who, in an instant, were busily employed in cooking a large kettle of  broth, made with the blood, and some fat and scraps of meat shred small,  boiled in it. This might be reckoned a dainty dish at any time, but was  more particularly so in our present almost famished condition.    [Sidenote: 11th.]    After partaking of this refreshment, we resumed our rest, and early in  the morning set out in a body for the place where the deer were lying.  As we intended to make our stay but short, we left our tent standing,  containing all our baggage. On our arrival at the place of destination,  some were immediately employed in making a hut or barrocado with young  pine trees; while one man skinned the deer, the remainder went a  hunting, and in the afternoon returned to the hut, after having killed  two deer.    Several days were now spent in feasting and gluttony; during which the  Indians killed five more deer and three fine beavers; finding at last,  however, that there was little prospect of procuring either more deer or  beavers, we determined to return to our tent, with the remains of what  we had already obtained.    [Sidenote: 1770. April. 22d.]    The flesh of these deer, though none of the largest, might with  frugality have served our small number, (being {25} only six) for some  time; but my companions, like other Indians, feasted day and night while  it lasted; and were so indolent and unthinking, as not to attend  properly to the fishing nets; so that many fine fish, which had been  entangled in the nets, were entirely spoiled, and in about twelve or  fourteen days we were nearly in as great distress for provisions as  ever.    During the course of our long inactivity, Saw-sop-o-kishac, commonly  called Sossop, my principal Southern Indian, as he was cutting some  birch for spoons, dishes, and other necessary household furniture, had  the misfortune to cut his leg in such a manner as to be incapable of  walking; and the other Southern Indian, though a much younger man, was  so indolent as not to be of any service to me, except hauling part of  our luggage, and eating up part of the provisions which had been  provided by the more industrious part of my companions.    [Sidenote: 24th.]    On the twenty-fourth, early in the day, a great body of Indians was seen  in the South West, on the large lake by the side of which our tent  stood. On their arrival at our tent we discovered them to be the wives  and families of the Northern Indian goose-hunters, who were gone to  Prince of Wales's Fort to attend the season. They were bound toward the  barren ground, there to wait the return of their husbands and relations  from the Fort, after the termination of the goose-season.    [Sidenote: 27th.]    {26} My guide having for some days past determined to move toward the  barren ground, this morning we took down our tent, packed up our  luggage, and proceeded to the Eastward in the same track we came; but  Sossop being so lame as to be obliged to be hauled on a sledge, I easily  prevailed on two of the Indians who had joined us on the 24th, and who  were pursuing the same road, to perform this service for him.    [Sidenote: 1770. April. 29th.]    [Sidenote: May. 13th.]    After two days good walking in our old track, we arrived at a part of  Seal River called She-than-nee,[33] where we pitched our tent and set  both our fishing-nets, intending to stay there till the geese began to  fly.
