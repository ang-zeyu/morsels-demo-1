Peat bogs are numerous in regions lately abandoned by glacier ice,  where river systems are so immature that the initial depressions  left in the sheet of drift spread over the country have not yet  been drained. One tenth of the surface of Ireland is said to be  covered with peat, and small bogs abound in the drift-covered area  of New England and the states lying as far west as the Missouri  River. In Massachusetts alone it has been reckoned that there are  fifteen billion cubic feet of peat, the largest bog occupying  several thousand acres.    Much larger swamps occur on the young coastal plain of the  Atlantic from New Jersey to Florida. The Dismal Swamp, for  example, in Virginia and North Carolina is forty miles across. It  is covered with a dense growth of water-loving trees such as the  cypress and black gum. The center of the swamp is occupied by Lake  Drummond, a shallow lake seven miles in diameter, with banks of  pure-peat, and still narrowing from the encroachment of vegetation  along its borders.    SALT LAKES. In arid climates a lake rarely receives sufficient  inflow to enable it to rise to the basin rim and find an outlet.  Before this height is reached its surface becomes large enough to  discharge by evaporation into the dry air the amount of water that  is supplied by streams. As such a lake has no outlet, the minerals  in solution brought into it by its streams cannot escape from the  basin. The lake water becomes more and more heavily charged with  such substances as common salt and the sulphates and carbonates of  lime, of soda, and of potash, and these are thrown down from  solution one after another as the point of saturation for each  mineral is reached. Carbonate of lime, the least soluble and often  the most abundant mineral brought in, is the first to be  precipitated. As concentration goes on, gypsum, which is insoluble  in a strong brine, is deposited, and afterwards common salt. As  the saltness of the lake varies with the seasons and with climatic  changes, gypsum and salt are laid in alternate beds and are  interleaved with sedimentary clays spread from the waste brought  in by streams at times of flood. Few forms of life can live in  bodies of salt water so concentrated that chemical deposits take  place, and hence the beds of salt, gypsum, and silt of such lakes  are quite barren of the remains of life. Similar deposits are  precipitated by the concentration of sea water in lagoons and arms  of the sea cut off from the ocean.    LAKES BONNEVILLE AND LAHONTAN. These names are given to extinct  lakes which once occupied large areas in the Great Basin, the  former in Utah, the latter in northwestern Nevada. Their records  remain in old horizontal beach lines which they drew along their  mountainous shores at the different levels at which they stood,  and in the deposits of their beds. At its highest stage Lake  Bonneville, then one thousand feet deep, overflowed to the north  and was a fresh-water lake. As it shrank below the outlet it  became more and more salty, and the Great Salt Lake, its withered  residue, is now depositing salt along its shores. In its strong  brine lime carbonate is insoluble, and that brought in by streams  is thrown down at once in the form of travertine.    Lake Lahontan never had an outlet. The first chemical deposits to  be made along its shores were deposits of travertine, in places  eighty feet thick. Its floor is spread with fine clays, which must  have been laid in deep, still water, and which are charged with  the salts absorbed by them as the briny water of the lake dried  away. These sedimentary clays are in two divisions, the upper and  lower, each being about one hundred feet thick. They are separated  by heavy deposits of well-rounded, cross-bedded gravels and sands,  similar to those spread at the present time by the intermittent  streams of arid regions. A similar record is shown in the old  floors of Lake Bonneville. What conclusions do you draw from these  facts as to the history of these ancient lakes?    DELTAS    In the river deposits which are left above sea level particles of  waste are allowed to linger only for a time. From alluvial fans  and flood plains they are constantly being taken up and swept  farther on downstream. Although these land forms may long persist,  the particles which compose them are ever changing. We may  therefore think of the alluvial deposits of a valley as a stream  of waste fed by the waste mantle as it creeps and washes down the  valley sides, and slowly moving onwards to the sea.    In basins waste finds a longer rest, but sooner or later lakes and  dry basins are drained or filled, and their deposits, if above sea  level, resume their journey to their final goal. It is only when  carried below the level of the sea that they are indefinitely  preserved.    On reaching this terminus, rivers deliver their load to the ocean.  In some cases the ocean is able to take it up by means of strong  tidal and other currents, and to dispose of it in ways which we  shall study later. But often the load is so large, or the tides  are so weak, that much of the waste which the river brings in  settles at its mouth, there building up a deposit called the  DELTA, from the Greek letter of that name, whose shape it  sometimes resembles.    Deltas and alluvial fans have many common characteristics. Both  owe their origin to a sudden check in the velocity of the river,  compelling a deposit of the load; both are triangular in outline,  the apex pointing upstream; and both are traversed by  distributaries which build up all parts in turn.    In a delta we may distinguish deposits of two distinct kinds,--  the submarine and the subaerial. In part a delta is built of waste  brought down by the river and redistributed and spread by waves  and tides over the sea bottom adjacent to the river's mouth. The  origin of these deposits is recorded in the remains of marine  animals and plants which they contain.    As the submarine delta grows near to the level of the sea the  distributaries of the river cover it with subaerial deposits  altogether similar to those of the flood plain, of which indeed  the subaerial delta is the prolongation. Here extended deposits of  peat may accumulate in swamps, and the remains of land and fresh-  water animals and plants swept down by the stream are imbedded in  the silts laid at times of flood.    Borings made in the deltas of great rivers such as the  Mississippi, the Ganges, and the Nile, show that the subaerial  portion often reaches a surprising thickness. Layers of peat, old  soils, and forest grounds with the stumps of trees are discovered  hundreds of feet below sea level. In the Nile delta some eight  layers of coarse gravel were found interbedded with river silts,  and in the Ganges delta at Calcutta a boring nearly five hundred  feet in depth stopped in such a layer.    The Mississippi has built a delta of twelve thousand three hundred  square miles, and is pushing the natural embankments of its chief  distributaries into the Gulf at a maximum rate of a mile in  sixteen years. Muddy shoals surround its front, shallow lakes,  e.g. lakes Pontchartrain and Borgne, are formed between the  growing delta and the old shore line, and elongate lakes and  swamps are inclosed between the natural embankments of the  distributaries.    The delta of the Indus River, India, lies so low along shore that  a broad tract of country is overflowed by the highest tides. The  submarine portion of the delta has been built to near sea level  over so wide a belt offshore that in many places large vessels  cannot come even within sight of land because of the shallow  water.    A former arm of the sea, the Rann of Cutch, adjoining the delta on  the east has been silted up and is now an immense barren flat of  sandy mud two hundred miles in length and one hundred miles in  greatest breadth. Each summer it is flooded with salt water when  the sea is brought in by strong southwesterly monsoon winds, and  the climate during the remainder of the year is hot and dry. By  the evaporation of sea water the soil is thus left so salty that  no vegetation can grow upon it, and in places beds of salt several  feet in thickness have accumulated. Under like conditions salt  beds of great thickness have been formed in the past and are now  found buried among the deposits of ancient deltas.    SUBSIDENCE OF GREAT DELTAS. As a rule great deltas are slowly  sinking. In some instances upbuilding by river deposits has gone  on as rapidly as the region has subsided. The entire thickness of  the Ganges delta, for example, so far as it has been sounded,  consists of deposits laid in open air. In other cases interbedded  limestones and other sedimentary rocks containing marine fossils  prove that at times subsidence has gained on the upbuilding and  the delta has been covered with the sea.    It is by gradual depression that delta deposits attain enormous  thickness, and, being lowered beneath the level of the sea, are  safely preserved from erosion until a movement of the earth's  crust in the opposite direction lifts them to form part of the  land. We shall read later in the hard rocks of our continent the  records of such ancient deltas, and we shall not be surprised to  find them as thick as are those now building at the mouths of  great rivers.    LAKE DELTAS. Deltas are also formed where streams lose their  velocity on entering the still waters of lakes. The shore lines of  extinct lakes, such as Lake Agassiz and Lakes Bonneville and  Lahontan, may be traced by the heavy deposits at the mouths of  their tributary streams.    We have seen that the work of streams is to drain the lands of the  water poured upon them by the rainfall, to wear them down, and to  carry their waste away to the sea, there to be rebuilt by other  agents into sedimentary rocks.

Therefore he sent for lawyers, and papers, and red-coats to stand  at his back. And the kindly folk of that country must all pack and  tramp, every father's son out of his father's house, and out of the  place where he was bred and fed, and played when he was a callant. And  who are to succeed them? Bare-leggit beggars! King George is to whistle  for his rents; he maun dow with less; he can spread his butter thinner:  what cares Red Colin? If he can hurt Ardshiel, he has his wish; if he  can pluck the meat from my chieftain's table, and the bit toys out of  his children's hands, he will gang hame singing to Glenure!\"    \"Let me have a word,\" said I. \"Be sure, if they take less rents, be  sure Government has a finger in the pie. It's not this Campbell's fault,  man--it's his orders. And if ye killed this Colin to-morrow, what better  would ye be? There would be another factor in his shoes, as fast as spur  can drive.\"    \"Ye're a good lad in a fight,\" said Alan; \"but, man! ye have Whig blood  in ye!\"    He spoke kindly enough, but there was so much anger under his contempt  that I thought it was wise to change the conversation. I expressed my  wonder how, with the Highlands covered with troops, and guarded like  a city in a siege, a man in his situation could come and go without  arrest.    \"It's easier than ye would think,\" said Alan. \"A bare hillside (ye see)  is like all one road; if there's a sentry at one place, ye just go by  another. And then the heather's a great help. And everywhere there are  friends' houses and friends' byres and haystacks. And besides, when folk  talk of a country covered with troops, it's but a kind of a byword at  the best. A soldier covers nae mair of it than his boot-soles. I have  fished a water with a sentry on the other side of the brae, and killed a  fine trout; and I have sat in a heather bush within six feet of another,  and learned a real bonny tune from his whistling. This was it,\" said he,  and whistled me the air.    \"And then, besides,\" he continued, \"it's no sae bad now as it was in  forty-six. The Hielands are what they call pacified. Small wonder, with  never a gun or a sword left from Cantyre to Cape Wrath, but what tenty*  folk have hidden in their thatch! But what I would like to ken, David,  is just how long? Not long, ye would think, with men like Ardshiel in  exile and men like the Red Fox sitting birling the wine and oppressing  the poor at home. But it's a kittle thing to decide what folk'll bear,  and what they will not. Or why would Red Colin be riding his horse all  over my poor country of Appin, and never a pretty lad to put a bullet in  him?\"         * Careful.    And with this Alan fell into a muse, and for a long time sate very sad  and silent.    I will add the rest of what I have to say about my friend, that he  was skilled in all kinds of music, but principally pipe-music; was a  well-considered poet in his own tongue; had read several books both in  French and English; was a dead shot, a good angler, and an excellent  fencer with the small sword as well as with his own particular weapon.  For his faults, they were on his face, and I now knew them all. But  the worst of them, his childish propensity to take offence and to pick  quarrels, he greatly laid aside in my case, out of regard for the battle  of the round-house. But whether it was because I had done well myself,  or because I had been a witness of his own much greater prowess, is more  than I can tell. For though he had a great taste for courage in other  men, yet he admired it most in Alan Breck.          CHAPTER XIII    THE LOSS OF THE BRIG    It was already late at night, and as dark as it ever would be at that  season of the year (and that is to say, it was still pretty bright),  when Hoseason clapped his head into the round-house door.    \"Here,\" said he, \"come out and see if ye can pilot.\"    \"Is this one of your tricks?\" asked Alan.    \"Do I look like tricks?\" cries the captain. \"I have other things to  think of--my brig's in danger!\"    By the concerned look of his face, and, above all, by the sharp tones in  which he spoke of his brig, it was plain to both of us he was in deadly  earnest; and so Alan and I, with no great fear of treachery, stepped on  deck.    The sky was clear; it blew hard, and was bitter cold; a great deal of  daylight lingered; and the moon, which was nearly full, shone brightly.  The brig was close hauled, so as to round the southwest corner of the  Island of Mull, the hills of which (and Ben More above them all, with a  wisp of mist upon the top of it) lay full upon the lar-board bow. Though  it was no good point of sailing for the Covenant, she tore through  the seas at a great rate, pitching and straining, and pursued by the  westerly swell.    Altogether it was no such ill night to keep the seas in; and I had begun  to wonder what it was that sat so heavily upon the captain, when the  brig rising suddenly on the top of a high swell, he pointed and cried to  us to look. Away on the lee bow, a thing like a fountain rose out of the  moonlit sea, and immediately after we heard a low sound of roaring.    \"What do ye call that?\" asked the captain, gloomily.    \"The sea breaking on a reef,\" said Alan. \"And now ye ken where it is;  and what better would ye have?\"    \"Ay,\" said Hoseason, \"if it was the only one.\"    And sure enough, just as he spoke there came a second fountain farther  to the south.    \"There!\" said Hoseason. \"Ye see for yourself. If I had kent of these  reefs, if I had had a chart, or if Shuan had been spared, it's not sixty  guineas, no, nor six hundred, would have made me risk my brig in sic a  stoneyard! But you, sir, that was to pilot us, have ye never a word?\"    \"I'm thinking,\" said Alan, \"these'll be what they call the Torran  Rocks.\"    \"Are there many of them?\" says the captain.    \"Truly, sir, I am nae pilot,\" said Alan; \"but it sticks in my mind there  are ten miles of them.\"    Mr. Riach and the captain looked at each other.    \"There's a way through them, I suppose?\" said the captain.    \"Doubtless,\" said Alan, \"but where? But it somehow runs in my mind once  more that it is clearer under the land.\"    \"So?\" said Hoseason. \"We'll have to haul our wind then, Mr. Riach; we'll  have to come as near in about the end of Mull as we can take her, sir;  and even then we'll have the land to kep the wind off us, and that  stoneyard on our lee. Well, we're in for it now, and may as well crack  on.\"    With that he gave an order to the steersman, and sent Riach to the  foretop. There were only five men on deck, counting the officers; these  being all that were fit (or, at least, both fit and willing) for their  work. So, as I say, it fell to Mr. Riach to go aloft, and he sat there  looking out and hailing the deck with news of all he saw.    \"The sea to the south is thick,\" he cried; and then, after a while, \"it  does seem clearer in by the land.\"    \"Well, sir,\" said Hoseason to Alan, \"we'll try your way of it. But I  think I might as well trust to a blind fiddler. Pray God you're right.\"    \"Pray God I am!\" says Alan to me. \"But where did I hear it? Well, well,  it will be as it must.\"    As we got nearer to the turn of the land the reefs began to be sown here  and there on our very path; and Mr. Riach sometimes cried down to us to  change the course. Sometimes, indeed, none too soon; for one reef was  so close on the brig's weather board that when a sea burst upon it the  lighter sprays fell upon her deck and wetted us like rain.    The brightness of the night showed us these perils as clearly as by day,  which was, perhaps, the more alarming. It showed me, too, the face of  the captain as he stood by the steersman, now on one foot, now on the  other, and sometimes blowing in his hands, but still listening and  looking and as steady as steel. Neither he nor Mr. Riach had shown  well in the fighting; but I saw they were brave in their own trade, and  admired them all the more because I found Alan very white.    \"Ochone, David,\" says he, \"this is no the kind of death I fancy!\"    \"What, Alan!\" I cried, \"you're not afraid?\"    \"No,\" said he, wetting his lips, \"but you'll allow, yourself, it's a  cold ending.\"    By this time, now and then sheering to one side or the other to avoid a  reef, but still hugging the wind and the land, we had got round Iona and  begun to come alongside Mull. The tide at the tail of the land ran very  strong, and threw the brig about. Two hands were put to the helm, and  Hoseason himself would sometimes lend a help; and it was strange to  see three strong men throw their weight upon the tiller, and it (like a  living thing) struggle against and drive them back. This would have  been the greater danger had not the sea been for some while free of  obstacles. Mr. Riach, besides, announced from the top that he saw clear  water ahead.    \"Ye were right,\" said Hoseason to Alan. \"Ye have saved the brig, sir.  I'll mind that when we come to clear accounts.\" And I believe he not  only meant what he said, but would have done it; so high a place did the  Covenant hold in his affections.    But this is matter only for conjecture, things having gone otherwise  than he forecast.    \"Keep her away a point,\" sings out Mr. Riach. \"Reef to windward!\"    And just at the same time the tide caught the brig, and threw the wind  out of her sails. She came round into the wind like a top, and the next  moment struck the reef with such a dunch as threw us all flat upon the  deck, and came near to shake Mr. Riach from his place upon the mast.    I was on my feet in a minute. The reef on which we had struck was close  in under the southwest end of Mull, off a little isle they call Earraid,  which lay low and black upon the larboard. Sometimes the swell broke  clean over us; sometimes it only ground the poor brig upon the reef, so  that we could hear her beat herself to pieces; and what with the great  noise of the sails, and"]]]
