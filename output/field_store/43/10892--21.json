[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35514"],[0,"The Great Apostasy, Considered in the Light of Scriptural and Secular History (#17)"],[1,"of the third  century, Cyprian, the bishop of Carthage, thus speaks: \"If the cause  of our miseries be investigated, the cure of the wound may be found.  The Lord would have his family to be tried. And because long peace had  corrupted the discipline divinely revealed to us, the heavenly  chastisement hath raised up our faith, which had lain almost dormant:  and when, by our sins, we have deserved to suffer still more, the  merciful Lord so moderated all things, that the whole scene rather  deserves the name of a trial than a persecution. Each had been bent on  improving his patrimony; and had forgotten what believers had done  under the apostles, and what they ought always to do:--they were  brooding over the arts of amassing wealth:--the pastors and the  deacons each forgot their duty: Works of mercy were neglected, and  discipline was at the lowest ebb.--Luxury and effeminacy prevailed:  Meretricious arts in dress were cultivated: Frauds and deceit were  practiced among brethren.--Christians could unite themselves in  matrimony with unbelievers; could swear not only without reverence,  but even without veracity. With haughty asperity they despised their  ecclesiastical superiors: They railed against one another with  outrageous acrimony, and conducted quarrels with determined  malice:--Even many bishops, who ought to be guides and patterns to the  rest, neglecting the peculiar duties of their stations, gave  themselves up to secular pursuits:--They deserted their places of  residence and their flocks: They traveled through distant provinces in  quest of pleasure and gain; gave no assistance to the needy brethren;  but were insatiable in their thirst of money:--They possessed estates  by fraud and multiplied usury. What have we not deserved to suffer for  such conduct? Even the divine word hath foretold us what we might  expect.--'If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my  judgments, I will visit their offenses with the rod, and their sin  with scourges.' These things had been denounced and foretold, but in  vain. Our sins had brought our affairs to that pass, that because we  had despised the Lord's directions, we were obliged to undergo a  correction of our multiplied evils and a trial of our faith by severe  remedies.\"--(As quoted by Milner, \"Church History,\" Cent. III, ch. 8.)    9. Milner, who quotes approvingly the severe arraignment of the Church  in the third century as given above, cannot be charged with bias  against Christian institutions, inasmuch as his declared purpose in  presenting to the world an additional \"History of the Church of  Christ\" was to give due attention to certain phases of the subject  slighted or neglected by earlier authors, and notably to emphasize the  piety, not the wickedness, of the professed followers of Christ. This  author, avowedly friendly to the Church and her votaries, admits the  growing depravity of the Christian sects, and declares that toward the  end of the third century the effect of the Pentecostal outpouring of  the Holy Spirit had become exhausted, and that there remained little  proof of any close relationship between Christ and the Church.    10. Note his summary of conditions: \"The era of its actual declension  must be dated in the pacific part of Diocletian's reign. During this  whole century the work of God, in purity and power, had been tending  to decay. The connection with philosophers was one of the principal  causes. Outward peace and secular advantages completed the corruption.  Ecclesiastical discipline, which had been too strict, was now relaxed  exceedingly; bishops and people were in a state of malice. Endless  quarrels were fomented among contending parties, and ambition and  covetousness had in general gained the ascendency in the Christian  Church. * * * The faith of Christ itself appeared now an ordinary  business; and here _terminated_, or nearly so, as far as appears, the  first great effusion of the Spirit of God, which began at the day of  Pentecost. Human depravity effected throughout a general decay of  godliness; and one generation of men elapsed with very slender proofs  of the spiritual presence of Christ with His Church.\"--(Milner,  \"Church History,\" Cent. III, ch. 17.)    11. If further evidence be wanted as to the fires of disaffection  smoldering within the Church, and so easily fanned into destructive  flame, let the testimony of Eusebius be considered with respect to  conditions characterizing the second half of the third century. And,  in weighing his words, let it be remembered that he had expressly  recorded his purpose of writing in defense of the Church, and in  support of her institutions. He bewails the tranquillity preceding the  Diocletian outbreak, because of its injurious effect upon both  officers and members of the Church. These are his words: \"But when by  excessive liberty we have sunk into indolence and sloth, one envying  and reviling another in different ways, and we were almost, as it  were, on the point of taking up arms against each other, and were  assailing each other with words, as with darts and spears, prelates  inveighing against prelates, and people rising up against people, and  hypocrisy and dissimulation had arisen to the greater heights of  malignity, then the divine judgment, which usually proceeds with a  lenient hand, whilst the multitudes were yet crowding into the Church,  with gentle and mild visitations began to afflict its episcopacy; the  persecution having begun with those brethren that were in the army. *  * * But some that appeared to be our pastors, deserting the law of  piety, were inflamed against each other with mutual strifes,  accumulating quarrels and threats, rivalry, hostility, and hatred to  each other, only anxious to assert the government as a kind of  sovereignty for themselves.\"--(Eusebius, \"Ecclesiastical History,\"  Book VIII, ch. 1. See note 4, end of chapter.)    12. As further illustrative of the decline of the Christian spirit  toward the end of the third century, Milner quotes the following  observation of Eusebius, an eye-witness of the conditions described:  \"The heavy hand of God's judgment began softly, by little and little,  to visit us after His wonted manner; * * * but we were not at all  moved with His hand, nor took any pains to return to God. We heaped  sin upon sin, judging like careless Epicureans, that God cared not for  our sins, nor would ever visit us on account of them. And our  pretended shepherds, laying aside the rule of godliness, practiced  among themselves contention and division.\" He adds that the \"dreadful  persecution of Diocletian was then inflicted on the Church as a just  punishment, and as the most proper chastisement for their  iniquities.\"--(Milner, \"Church History,\" Cent. III, ch. 17.)    13. It will be remembered that the great change whereby the Church was  raised to a place of honor in the state, occurred in the early part of  the fourth century. It is a popular error to assume that the decay of  the Church as a spiritual institution dates from that time. The  picture of the Church declining as to spiritual power in exact  proportion to her increase of temporal influence and wealth has  appealed to rhetoricians and writers of sensational literature; but  such a picture does not present the truth. The Church was saturated  with the spirit of apostasy long before Constantine took it under his  powerful protection by according it official standing in the state.  In support of this statement, I quote again from Milner, the avowed  friend of the Church: \"I know it is common for authors to represent  the great declension of Christianity to have taken place only after  its external establishment under Constantine. But the evidence of  history has compelled me to dissent from this view of things. In fact,  we have seen that for a whole generation previous to the [Diocletian]  persecution, few marks of superior piety appeared. Scarce a luminary  of godliness existed; and it is not common in any age for a great work  of the Spirit of God to be exhibited but under the conduct of some  remarkable saints, pastors, and reformers. This whole period as well  as the whole scene of the persecution is very barren in such  characters. * * * Moral and philosophical and monastical instructions  will not effect for men what is to be expected from evangelical  doctrine. And if the faith of Christ was so much declined (and its  decayed state ought to be dated from about the year 270), we need not  wonder that such scenes as Eusebius hints at without any  circumstantial details, took place in the Christian world. * * * He  speaks also of the ambitious spirit of many, in aspiring to the  offices of the Church, the ill judged and unlawful ordinations, the  quarrels among confessors themselves, and the contentions excited by  young demagogues in the very relics of the persecuted Church, and the  multiplied evils which their vices excited among Christians. How sadly  must the Christian world have declined which could thus conduct itself  under the very rod of divine vengeance? Yet let not the infidel or the  profane world triumph. _It was not Christianity, but the departure  from it_, which brought on these evils.\"--(Milner, \"Church History,\"  Cent. IV, ch. 1. The italics are introduced by the present writer.  See also Note 5, end of chapter.)    14. The foregoing embodies but a few of the many evidences that could  be cited in demonstration of the fact that during the period  immediately following the apostolic ministry--the period covered by  the persecutions of the Christians by the heathen nations,--the Church  was undergoing internal deterioration, and was in a state of  increasing perversion. Among the more detailed or specific causes of  this ever widening departure from the spirit of the gospel of Christ,  this rapidly growing apostasy, the following may be considered as  important examples:    (1). The corrupting of the simple "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35534"],[0,"How to be Happy Though Married: Being a Handbook to Marriage (#17)"],[1,"in one part of the ceremony  lightly applied it to the bride's back, in token that she was to be in  subjection. Is there not still, however, much truth in the old couplet:      \"Man, love thy wife; thy husband, wife, obey.    Wives are our heart; we should be head alway\"?    On a great many points concerning the pecuniary or other interests of  the family, the husband will usually be the wisest, and may most  properly be treated as the senior or acting partner in the firm.    \"The good wife,\" says Fuller, \"commandeth her husband in any equal  matter, by constantly obeying him. It was always observed, that what the  English gained of the French in battle by valour, the French regained of  the English in cunning by treaties. So if the husband should chance by  his power in his passion to prejudice his wife's right, she wisely  knoweth by compounding and complying, to recover and rectify it again.\"  This is very much what the well-known lines in \"Hiawatha\" teach--      \"As unto the bow the cord is,    So unto the man is woman;    Though she bends him, she obeys him;    Though she draws him, yet she follows;    Useless each without the other!\"    But indeed it is a sign of something being wrong between married  people, when the question which of the two shall be subject to the other  ever arises. It will never do so when both parties love as they ought,  for then the struggle will be not who shall command and control, but who  shall serve and yield. As Chaucer says--      \"When mastery cometh, then sweet Love anon,    Flappeth his nimble wings and soon away is flown.\"          CHAPTER XI.    \"DRIVE GENTLY OVER THE STONES!\"         \"It were better to meet some dangers half-way, though they come       nothing near.\"--_Bacon._      \"Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wreck'd.\"--_Milton._      \"Drive gently over the stones!\" This piece of advice, which is  frequently given to inexperienced whips, may be suggested metaphorically  to the newly-married. On the road upon which they have entered there are  stony places, which, if not carefully driven over, will almost certainly  upset the domestic coach. To accompany one's wife harmoniously on an  Irish car is easy compared to the task of accompanying her over these  stones on the domestic car.    The first rock ahead which should be signalled \"dangerous\" is the first  year of married life. As a rule the first year either mars or makes a  marriage. During this period errors may be committed which will cast a  shadow over every year that follows. We agree with Mrs. Jameson in  thinking that the first year of married life is not as happy as the  second. People have to get into the habit of being married, and there  are difficult lessons to be learned in the apprenticeship.    A lady once asked Dr. Johnson how in his dictionary he came to define  _pastern_ the _knee_ of a horse; he immediately answered, \"Ignorance,  madam, pure ignorance.\" This is the simple explanation of many an  accident that takes place at the commencement of the matrimonial  journey. The young couple have not yet learned the dangerous places of  the road, and, as a consequence, they drive carelessly over them.    How many people starting in married life throw happiness out of their  grasp, and create troubles for the rest of their days! The cause may be  generally traced to selfishness, their conceit taking everything that  goes amiss as meant for a personal affront, and their wounded  self-esteem making life a burden hard to bear, for themselves and  others. We can all recognize in every circle such cases; we are all able  to read the moral elsewhere; but in our own case we allow the small  breach--that might be healed with very little effort at first--to get  wider and wider, and the pair that should become closer and closer,  gradually not only cease to care for, but have a dread of each other's  society.    There is one simple direction, which, if carefully regarded, might long  preserve the tranquillity of the married life, and ensure no  inconsiderable portion of connubial happiness to the observers of it: it  is--to beware of the _first_ dispute. \"Man and wife,\" says Jeremy  Taylor, \"are equally concerned to avoid all offences of each other in  the beginning of their conversation; every little thing can blast an  infant blossom; and the breath of the south can shake the little rings  of the vine, when first they begin to curl like the locks of a new  weaned boy: but when by age and consolidation they stiffen into the  hardness of a stem, and have, by the warm embraces of the sun and the  kisses of heaven, brought forth their clusters, they can endure the  storms of the north, and the loud noises of a tempest, and yet never be  broken. So are the early unions of an unfixed marriage; watchful and  observant, jealous and busy, inquisitive and careful, and apt to take  alarm at every unkind word. After the hearts of the man and the wife are  endeared and hardened by a mutual confidence and experience, longer than  artifice and pretence can last, there are a great many remembrances, and  some things present, that dash all little unkindnesses in pieces.\"    Every little dispute between man and wife is dangerous. It forces  good-humour out of its channel, undermines affection, and insidiously,  though perhaps insensibly, wears out and, at last, entirely destroys  that cordiality which is the life and soul of matrimonial felicity. As  however \"it's hardly in a body's power to keep at times from being  sour,\" undue importance ought not to be attached to \"those little tiffs  that sometimes cast a shade on wedlock.\" Often they are, as the poet  goes on to observe, \"love in masquerade--      \"And family jars, look we but o'er the rim,    Are filled with honey, even to the brim.\"    In the Life of St. Francis de Sales we are told that the saint did not  approve of the saying, \"Never rely on a reconciled enemy.\" He rather  preferred a contrary maxim, and said that a quarrel between friends,  when made up, added a new tie to friendship; as experience shows that  the calosity formed round a broken bone makes it stronger than before.    Beware of jealousy; \"it is the green-eyed monster, which doth make the  meat it feeds on.\" Here is an amusing case in point. A French lady who  was jealous of her husband determined to watch his movements. One day,  when he told her he was going to Versailles, she followed him, keeping  him in sight until she missed him in a passage leading to the railway  station. Looking about her for a few minutes, she saw a man coming out  of a glove-shop with a rather overdressed lady. Blinded with rage and  jealousy, she fancied it was her husband, and without pausing for a  moment to consider, bounced suddenly up to him and gave him three or  four stinging boxes on the ear. The instant the gentleman turned round,  she discovered her mistake, and at the same moment caught sight of her  husband, who had merely called at a tobacconist's, and was now crossing  the street. There was nothing for it but to faint in the arms of the  gentleman she had attacked; while the other lady moved away, to avoid a  scene. The stranger, astonished to find an unknown lady in his arms, was  further startled by a gentleman seizing him by the collar and demanding  to know what he meant by embracing that lady. \"Why, sir, she boxed my  ears, and then fainted,\" exclaimed the innocent victim. \"She is my  wife,\" shouted the angry husband, \"and would never have struck you  without good cause.\" Worse than angry words would probably have followed  had not the cause of the whole misunderstanding recovered sufficiently  to explain how it had all happened.    A jealous wife is generally considered a proper subject for ridicule;  and a woman ought to conceal from her husband any feeling of the kind.  Her suspicions may be altogether groundless, and she may be tormenting  herself with a whole train of imaginary evils.    On the other hand a husband is bound to abstain from even the appearance  of preferring any one else to his wife. When in the presence of others  he should indulge her laudable pride by showing that he thinks her an  object of importance and preference.    In his \"Advice to Young Men\" Cobbett gives this interesting bit of  autobiography. \"For about two or three years after I was married, I,  retaining some of my military manners, used, both in France and America,  to _romp_ most famously with the girls that came in my way; till one day  at Philadelphia, my wife said to me in a very gentle manner: 'Don't do  that, _I do not like it_.' That was quite enough; I had never _thought_  on the subject before; one hair of her head was more dear to me than all  the other women in the world, and this I knew that she knew. But I now  saw that this was not all that she had a right to from me; I saw that  she had the further claim upon me that I should abstain from everything  that might induce others to believe that there was any other woman for  whom, even if I were at liberty, I had any affection. I beseech young  married men to bear this in mind; for on some trifle of this sort the  happiness or misery of a long life frequently turns.\"    There may be a fanaticism in love as well as in belief, and where people  love much they are apt to be exacting one to the other. But although  jealousy does imply love, such love as consists in a craving for the  affection of its object, it is love which is largely dashed with  selfishness. It is incompatible with love of the highest order, for  where that exists there is no dread of not being loved enough in return.  In this relation as well as in the highest, \"There is no fear in love,  but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath torment. He that  feareth is not made perfect in love.\"    It is generally admitted that conjugal affection largely depends on  mutual confidence. A friend quoted this sentiment the other day in a  smoking-room, and added that he made it a"]]]
