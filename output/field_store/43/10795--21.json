TABLE OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.      To reduce our culinary operations to as exact a certainty as the nature  of the processes would admit of, we have, wherever it was needful, given  the quantities of each article.    The weights are _avoirdupois_.    The measure, the graduated glass of the apothecaries. This appeared the  most accurate and convenient; _the pint_ being divided into sixteen  ounces, _the ounce_ into eight drachms. A middling-sized _tea-spoon_  will contain about a drachm; four such tea-spoons are equal to a  middling-sized _table-spoon_, or half an ounce; four table-spoons to a  common-sized _wine-glass_.    The specific gravities of the various substances being so extremely  different, we cannot offer any auxiliary standards[65-*] for the  weights, which we earnestly recommend the cook to employ, if she wishes  to gain credit for accuracy and uniformity in her business: these she  will find it necessary to have as small as the quarter of a drachm  avoirdupois, which is equal to nearly seven grains troy.    Glass measures (divided into tea and table-spoons), containing from half  an ounce to half a pint, may be procured; also, the double-headed pepper  and spice boxes, with caps over the gratings. The superiority of these,  by preserving the contents from the action of the air, must be  sufficiently obvious to every one: the fine aromatic flavour of pepper  is soon lost, from the bottles it is usually kept in not being well  stopped. Peppers are seldom ground or pounded sufficiently fine. (See  N.B. to 369.)    N.B. The trough nutmeg-graters are by far the best we have seen,  especially for those who wish to grate fine, and fast.

BOILING.[66-*]      This most simple of culinary processes is not often performed in  perfection. It does not require quite so much nicety and attendance as  roasting; to skim your pot well, and keep it really boiling (the slower  the better) all the while, to know how long is required for doing the  joint, &c., and to take it up at the critical moment when it is done  enough, comprehends almost the whole art and mystery. This, however,  demands a patient and perpetual vigilance, of which few persons are  capable.    The cook must take especial care that the water really boils all the  while she is cooking, or she will be deceived in the time; and make up a  sufficient fire (a frugal cook will manage with much less fire for  boiling than she uses for roasting) at first, to last all the time,  without much mending or stirring.    When the pot is coming to a boil there will always, from the cleanest  meat and clearest water, rise a _scum_ to the top of it, proceeding  partly from the water; this must be carefully taken off as soon as it  rises.    On this depends the good appearance of all boiled things.    When you have skimmed well, put in some cold water, which will throw up  the rest of the scum.    The oftener it is skimmed, and the cleaner the top of the water is kept,  the sweeter and the cleaner will be the meat.    If let alone, it soon boils down and sticks to the meat,[67-*] which,  instead of looking delicately white and nice, will have that coarse and  filthy appearance we have too often to complain of, and the butcher and  poulterer be blamed for the carelessness of the cook in not skimming her  pot.    Many put in _milk_, to make what they boil look white; but this does  more harm than good: others wrap it up in a cloth; but these are  needless precautions: if the scum be attentively removed, meat will have  a much more delicate colour and finer flavour than it has when muffled  up. This may give rather more trouble, but those who wish to excel in  their art must only consider how the processes of it can be most  perfectly performed: a cook, who has a proper pride and pleasure in her  business, will make this her maxim on all occasions.    It is desirable that meat for boiling be of an equal thickness, or  before thicker parts are done enough the thinner will be done too much.    Put your meat into _cold_[67-+] water, in the proportion of about a  quart of water to a pound of meat: it should be covered with water  during the whole of the process of boiling, but not drowned in it; the  less water, provided the meat be covered with it, the more savoury will  be the meat, and the better will be the broth.    The water should be heated gradually, according to the thickness, &c. of  the article boiled. For instance, a leg of mutton of 10 pounds weight  (No. 1,) should be placed over a moderate fire, which will gradually  make the water hot, without causing it to boil for about forty minutes;  if the water boils much sooner, the meat will be hardened, and shrink up  as if it was scorched: by keeping the water a certain time heating  without boiling, the fibres of the meat are dilated, and it yields a  quantity of scum, which must be taken off as soon as it rises.    \"104. If a vessel containing water be placed over a steady fire, the  water will grow continually hotter till it reaches the limit of boiling,  after which the regular accessions of heat are wholly spent in  converting it into steam.    \"Water remains at the same pitch of temperature, however fiercely it  boils. The only difference is, that with a strong fire it sooner comes  to boil, and more quickly boils away, and is converted into  steam.\"--BUCHANAN _on the Economy of Fuel_, 1810.    The editor placed a thermometer in water in that state which cooks call  gentle simmering; the heat was 212 deg., i. e. the same degree as the  strongest boiling.    Two mutton chops were covered with cold water, and one boiled a gallop,  and the other simmered very gently for three quarters of an hour: the  chop which was slowly simmered was decidedly superior to that which was  boiled; it was much tenderer, more juicy, and much higher flavoured. The  liquor which boiled fast was in like proportion more savoury, and when  cold had much more fat on its surface. This explains why quick boiling  renders meat hard, &c., because its juices are extracted in a greater  degree.    Reckon the time from its first coming to a boil.    The old rule of 15 minutes to a pound of meat, we think rather too  little: the slower it boils, the tenderer, the plumper, and whiter it  will be.    For those who choose their food thoroughly cooked (which all will who  have any regard for their stomachs), twenty minutes to a pound for  fresh, and rather more for salted meat, will not be found too much for  gentle simmering by the side of the fire, allowing more or less time,  according to the thickness of the joint, and the coldness of the  weather: to know the state of which, let a thermometer be placed in the  pantry; and when it falls below 40 deg., tell your cook to give rather more  time in both roasting and boiling, always remembering, the slower it  boils the better.    Without some practice it is difficult to teach any art; and cooks seem  to suppose they must be right, if they put meat into a pot, and set it  over the fire for a certain time, making no allowance whether it simmers  without a bubble or boils a gallop.    Fresh-killed meat will take much longer time boiling than that which has  been kept till it is what the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28693"],[0,"Tales of the Fish Patrol (#17)"],[1,"Creek.    In a couple of minutes we ran softly alongside the bank, and the sail  was silently lowered. The Chinese kept very quiet. Yellow Handkerchief  sat down in the bottom alongside of me, and I could feel him straining  to repress his raspy, hacking cough. Possibly seven or eight minutes  later I heard Charley's voice as the _Reindeer_ went past the mouth of  the slough.    \"I can't tell you how relieved I am,\" I could plainly hear him saying  to Neil, \"that the lad has finished with the fish patrol without  accident.\"    Here Neil said something which I could not catch, and then Charley's  voice went on:    \"The youngster takes naturally to the water, and if, when he finishes  high school, he takes a course in navigation and goes deep sea, I see  no reason why he shouldn't rise to be master of the finest and biggest  ship afloat.\"    It was all very flattering to me, but lying there, bound and gagged by  my own prisoners, with the voices growing faint and fainter as the  _Reindeer_ slipped on through the darkness toward San Rafael, I must  say I was not in quite the proper situation to enjoy my smiling  future. With the _Reindeer_ went my last hope. What was to happen next  I could not imagine, for the Chinese were a different race from mine,  and from what I knew I was confident that fair play was no part of  their make-up.    After waiting a few minutes longer, the crew hoisted the lateen sail,  and Yellow Handkerchief steered down toward the mouth of San Rafael  Creek. The tide was getting lower, and he had difficulty in escaping  the mud-banks. I was hoping he would run aground, but he succeeded in  making the Bay without accident.    As we passed out of the creek a noisy discussion arose, which I knew  related to me. Yellow Handkerchief was vehement, but the other four as  vehemently opposed him. It was very evident that he advocated doing  away with me and they were afraid of the consequences. I was familiar  enough with the Chinese character to know that fear alone restrained  them. But what plan they offered in place of Yellow Handkerchief's  murderous one, I could not make out.    My feelings, as my fate hung in the balance, may be guessed. The  discussion developed into a quarrel, in the midst of which Yellow  Handkerchief unshipped the heavy tiller and sprang toward me. But his  four companions threw themselves between, and a clumsy struggle took  place for possession of the tiller. In the end Yellow Handkerchief was  over-come, and sullenly returned to the steering, while they soundly  berated him for his rashness.    Not long after, the sail was run down and the junk slowly urged  forward by means of the sweeps. I felt it ground gently on the soft  mud. Three of the Chinese--they all wore long sea-boots--got over the  side, and the other two passed me across the rail. With Yellow  Handkerchief at my legs and his two companions at my shoulders, they  began to flounder along through the mud. After some time their feet  struck firmer footing, and I knew they were carrying me up some beach.  The location of this beach was not doubtful in my mind. It could be  none other than one of the Marin Islands, a group of rocky islets  which lay off the Marin County shore.    When they reached the firm sand that marked high tide, I was dropped,  and none too gently. Yellow Handkerchief kicked me spitefully in the  ribs, and then the trio floundered back through the mud to the junk. A  moment later I heard the sail go up and slat in the wind as they drew  in the sheet. Then silence fell, and I was left to my own devices for  getting free.    I remembered having seen tricksters writhe and squirm out of ropes  with which they were bound, but though I writhed and squirmed like a  good fellow, the knots remained as hard as ever, and there was no  appreciable slack. In the course of my squirming, however, I rolled  over upon a heap of clam-shells--the remains, evidently, of some  yachting party's clam-bake. This gave me an idea. My hands were tied  behind my back; and, clutching a shell in them, I rolled over and  over, up the beach, till I came to the rocks I knew to be there.    Rolling about and searching, I finally discovered a narrow crevice,  into which I shoved the shell. The edge of it was sharp, and across  the sharp edge I proceeded to saw the rope that bound my wrists. The  edge of the shell was also brittle, and I broke it by bearing too  heavily upon it. Then I rolled back to the heap and returned with as  many shells as I could carry in both hands. I broke many shells, cut  my hands a number of times, and got cramps in my legs from my strained  position and my exertions.    While I was suffering from the cramps, and resting, I heard the  familiar halloo drift across the water. It was Charley, searching for  me. The gag in my mouth prevented me from replying, and I could only  lie there, helplessly fuming, while he rowed past the island and his  voice slowly lost itself in the distance.    I returned to the sawing process, and at the end of half an hour  succeeded in severing the rope. The rest was easy. My hands once free,  it was a matter of minutes to loosen my legs and to take the gag out  of my mouth. I ran around the island to make sure it _was_ an island  and not by chance a portion of the mainland. An island it certainly  was, one of the Marin group, fringed with a sandy beach and surrounded  by a sea of mud. Nothing remained but to wait till daylight and to  keep warm; for it was a cold, raw night for California, with just  enough wind to pierce the skin and cause one to shiver.    To keep up the circulation, I ran around the island a dozen times or  so, and clambered across its rocky backbone as many times more--all of  which was of greater service to me, as I afterward discovered, than  merely to warm me up. In the midst of this exercise I wondered if I  had lost anything out of my pockets while rolling over and over in the  sand. A search showed the absence of my revolver and pocket-knife. The  first Yellow Handkerchief had taken; but the knife had been lost in  the sand.    I was hunting for it when the sound of rowlocks came to my ears. At  first, of course, I thought of Charley; but on second thought I knew  Charley would be calling out as he rowed along. A sudden premonition  of danger seized me. The Marin Islands are lonely places; chance  visitors in the dead of night are hardly to be expected. What if it  were Yellow Handkerchief? The sound made by the rowlocks grew more  distinct. I crouched in the sand and listened intently. The boat,  which I judged a small skiff from the quick stroke of the oars, was  landing in the mud about fifty yards up the beach. I heard a raspy,  hacking cough, and my heart stood still. It was Yellow Handkerchief.  Not to be robbed of his revenge by his more cautious companions, he  had stolen away from the village and come back alone.    I did some swift thinking. I was unarmed and helpless on a tiny islet,  and a yellow barbarian, whom I had reason to fear, was coming after  me. Any place was safer than the island, and I turned immediately to  the water, or rather to the mud. As he began to flounder ashore  through the mud. I started to flounder out into it, going over the  same course which the Chinese had taken in landing me and in returning  to the junk.    Yellow Handkerchief, believing me to be lying tightly bound, exercised  no care, but came ashore noisily. This helped me, for, under the  shield of his noise and making no more myself than necessary, I  managed to cover fifty feet by the time he had made the beach. Here I  lay down in the mud. It was cold and clammy, and made me shiver, but I  did not care to stand up and run the risk of being discovered by his  sharp eyes.    He walked down the beach straight to where he had left me lying, and I  had a fleeting feeling of regret at not being able to see his surprise  when he did not find me. But it was a very fleeting regret, for my  teeth were chattering with the cold.    What his movements were after that I had largely to deduce from the  facts of the situation, for I could scarcely see him in the dim  starlight. But I was sure that the first thing he did was to make the  circuit of the beach to learn if landings had been made by other  boats. This he would have known at once by the tracks through the mud.    Convinced that no boat had removed me from the island, he next started  to find out what had become of me. Beginning at the pile of  clam-shells, he lighted matches to trace my tracks in the sand. At  such times I could see his villanous face plainly, and, when the  sulphur from the matches irritated his lungs, between the raspy cough  that followed and the clammy mud in which I was lying, I confess I  shivered harder than ever.    The multiplicity of my footprints puzzled him. Then the idea that I  might be out in the mud must have struck him, for he waded out a few  yards in my direction, and, stooping, with his eyes searched the dim  surface long and carefully. He could not have been more than fifteen  feet from me, and had he lighted a match he would surely have  discovered me.    He returned to the beach and clambered about over the rocky backbone,  again hunting for me with lighted matches. The closeness of the shore  impelled me to further flight. Not daring to wade upright, on account  of the noise made by floundering and by the suck of the mud, I  remained lying down in the mud and propelled myself over its surface  by means of my hands. Still keeping the trail made by the Chinese in  going from and to the junk, I held on until I had reached the water.  Into this I waded to a depth of three feet, and then I turned off to  the side on a line parallel with the beach.    The thought came to me of going toward Yellow Handkerchief's skiff and  escaping in it, but at that very moment he returned to the beach, and,  as though fearing the very thing I had in mind, he slushed out"]]]
