This was by no means pleasant; for the porters showed their uneasiness  by extracting their own cloths from my bundles, under the pretext that  they wished to make some purchases of their own. I ought, perhaps,  to have stopped this; but I thought the best plan was to show total  indifference; so, at the same time that they were allowed to take their  cloths, I refused to comply with the chief's request, and begged them  to have no fear so long as they saw I could hold my own ground with my  guns.    The Wanyamuezi, however, were panic-stricken, and half of them bolted,  with the kirangozi at their head, carrying off all the double-ration  cloths as well as their own. At this time, the sultan, having changed  tactics, as he saw us all ready to stand on the defensive, sent back  his hongo; but, instead of using threats, said he would oblige us with  donkeys or anything else if we would only give him a few more pretty  cloths. With this cringing, perfidious appeal I refused to comply, until  the sheikh, still more cringing, implored me to give way else not a  single man would remain with me. I then told him to settle with the  chief himself, and give me the account, which amounted to three barsati,  two sahari, and three yards merikani; but the donkeys were never alluded  to.    With half my men gone, I still ordered the march, though strongly  opposed to the advice of one of old Mamba's men, who was then passing by  on his way to the coast, in command of his master's rear detachment. He  thought it impossible for us to pull through the wilderness, with its  jungle grasses and roots, depending for food only on Grant's gun and  my own; still we made half-way to the Mdaburu nullah, taking some  of Mamba's out to camp with us, as he promised to take letters and  specimens down to the coast for us, provided I paid him some cloths as  ready money down, and promised some more to be paid at Zanzibar. These  letters eventually reached home, but not the specimens.    The rains were so heavy that the whole country was now flooded, but we  pushed on to the nullah by relays, and pitched on its left bank. In the  confusion of the march, however, we lost many more porters, who at the  same time relieved us of their loads, by slipping off stealthily into  the bush.    The fifteenth was a forced halt, as the stream was so deep and so  violent we could not cross it. To make the best of this very unfortunate  interruption, I now sent on two men to Kaze, with letters to Musa and  Sheikh Snay, both old friends on the former expedition, begging them  to send me sixty men, each carrying thirty rations of grain, and some  country tobacco. The tobacco was to gratify my men, who said of all  things they most wanted to cheer them was something to smoke. At the  same time I sent back some other men to Khoko, with cloth to buy grain  for present consumption, as some of my porters were already reduced to  living on wild herbs and white ants. I then sent all the remaining men,  under the directions of Bombay and Baraka, to fell a tall tree with  hatchets, on the banks of the nullah, with a view to bridging it; but  the tree dropped to the wrong side, and thwarted the plan. The rain  ceased on the 17th, just as we put the rain-gauge out, which was at  once interpreted to be our Uganga, or religious charm, and therefore the  cause of its ceasing. It was the first fine day for a fortnight, so we  were only too glad to put all our things out to dry, and rejoiced to  think of the stream's subsiding. My men who went back to Khoko for grain  having returned with next to nothing--though, of course, they had spent  all the cloths--I sent back another batch with pretty cloths, as it was  confidently stated that grain was so scarce there, nothing but the best  fabrics would but it. This also proved a dead failure; but although  animals were very scarce, Grant relieved our anxiety by shooting a zebra  and an antelope.    After five halts, we forded the stream, middle deep, and pushed forwards  again, doing short stages of four or five miles a-day, in the greatest  possible confusion; for, whilst Grant and I were compelled to go out  shooting all day for the pot, the sheikh and Bombay went on with the  first half of the property and then, keeping guard over it sent the men  back again to Baraka, who kept rear-guard, to have the rest brought  on. Order there was none: the men hated this \"double work;\" all the  Wanyamuezi but three deserted, with the connivance of the coast-men,  carrying off their loads with them, under a mutual understanding, as  I found out afterwards, that the coast-men were to go shares in the  plunder as soon as we reached Unyamuezi. The next great obstacle in this  tug-and-pull wilderness-march presented itself on the 24th, when, after  the first half of the property had crossed the Mabunguru nullah, it rose  in flood and cut off the rear half. It soon, however, subsided; and  the next day we reached \"the Springs,\" where we killed a pig and two  rhinoceros. Not content, however, with this fare--notwithstanding the  whole camp had been living liberally on zebra's and antelope's flesh  every day previously--some of my coast-men bolted on to the little  settlement of Jiwa la Mkoa, contrary to orders, to purchase some grain;  and in doing so, increased our transport difficulties.    Pulling on in the same way again--when not actually engaged in shooting,  scolding and storming at the men, to keep them up to the mark, and  prevent them from shirking their work, which they were for every trying  to do--we arrived on the 28th at the \"Boss,\" a huge granite block, from  the top of which the green foliage of the forest-trees looked like an  interminable cloud, soft and waving, fit for fairies to dwell upon. Here  the patience of my men fairly gave way, for the village of Jiwa la Mkoa  was only one long march distance from us; and they, in consequence,  smelt food on in advance much sweeter than the wild game and wild  grasses they had been living on; and many more of them could not resist  deserting us, though they might, had we all pulled together, have gone  more comfortably in, as soon as the rear property arrived next day with  Baraka.    All the men who deserted on the 25th, save Johur and Mutwana, now came  into camp, and told us they had heard from travellers that those men who  had been sent on for reliefs to Kaze were bringing us a large detachment  of slaves to help us on. My men had brought no food either for us or  their friends, as the cloths they took with them, \"which were their  own,\" were scarcely sufficient to purchase a meal--famines being as bad  where they had been as in Ugogo. To try and get all the men together  again, I now sent off a party loaded with cloths to see what they could  get for us; but they returned on the 30th grinning and joking, with  nothing but a small fragment of goat-flesh, telling lies by the dozens.  Johur then came into camp, unconscious that Baraka by my orders had,  during his absence, been inspecting his kit, where he found concealed  seventy-three yards of cloth, which could only have been my property, as  Johur had brought no akaba or reserve fund from the coast.    The theft having been proved to the satisfaction of every one, I ordered  Baraka to strip him of everything and give him three dozen lashes; but  after twenty-one had been given, the rest were remitted on his promising  to turn Queen's evidence, when it transpired that Mutwana had done as  much as himself. Johur, it turned out, was a murderer, having obtained  his freedom by killing his master. He was otherwise a notoriously bad  character; so, wishing to make an example, as I knew all my men were  robbing me daily, though I could not detect them, I had him turned out  of camp. Baraka was a splendid detective, and could do everything well  when he wished it, so I sent him off now with cloths to see what he  could to at Jiwa la Mkoa, and next day he returned triumphantly driving  in cows and goats. Three Wanyamuezi, also, who heard we were given to  shooting wild animals continually, came with him to offer their services  as porters.    As nearly all the men had now returned, Grant and I spent New Year's Day  with the first detachment at Jiwa la Mkoa, or Round Rock--a single tembe  village occupied by a few Wakimbu settlers, who, by their presence and  domestic habits, made us feel as though we were well out of the wood. So  indeed we found it; for although this wilderness was formerly an  entire forest of trees and wild animals, numerous Wakimbu, who formerly  occupied the banks of the Ruaha to the southward, had been driven  to migrate here, wherever they could find springs of water, by the  boisterous naked pastorals the Warori.    At night three slaves belonging to Sheikh Salem bin Saif stole into our  camp, and said they had been sent by their master to seek for porters at  Kaze, as all the Wanyamuezi porters of four large caravans had deserted  in Ugogo, and they could not move. I was rather pleased by this news,  and thought it served the merchants right, knowing, as I well did, that  the Wanyamuezi, being naturally honest, had they not been defrauded by  foreigners on the down march to the coast, would have been honest  still. Some provisions were now obtained by sending men out to distant  villages; but we still supplied the camp with our guns, killing  rhinoceros, wild boar, antelope, and zebras. The last of our property  did not come up till the 5th, when another thief being caught, got fifty  lashes, under the superintendence of Baraka, to show that punishment was  only inflicted to prevent further crime.    The next day my men came from Kaze with letters from Sheikh Snay and  Musa. They had been detained there some days after"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3287"],[0,"The Man from Glengarry: A Tale of the Ottawa (#17)"],[1,"o, and weather-beaten, but strong, deep-bosomed, and with faces  of calm content, worthy to be mothers of their husbands' sons. The girls  and younger children sat with their parents, modest, shy, and reverent,  but the young men, for the most part, filled the back seats under  the gallery. And a hardy lot they were, as brown and brawny as their  fathers, but tingling with life to their finger-tips, ready for  anything, and impossible of control except by one whom they feared as  well as reverenced. And such a man was Alexander Murray, for they knew  well that, lithe and brawny as they were, there was not a man of them  but he could fling out of the door and over the fence if he so wished;  and they knew, too, that he would be prompt to do it if occasion arose.  Hence they waited for the word of God with all due reverence and fear.    In the square pew in front of the pulpit sat the elders, hoary, massive,  and venerable. The Indian Lands Session were worth seeing. Great men  they were, every one of them, excepting, perhaps, Kenneth Campbell,  \"Kenny Crubach,\" as he was called, from his halting step. Kenny was  neither hoary nor massive nor venerable. He was a short, grizzled man  with snapping black eyes and a tongue for clever, biting speech;  and while he bore a stainless character, no one thought of him as  an eminently godly man. In public prayer he never attained any great  length, nor did he employ that tone of unction deemed suitable in this  sacred exercise. He seldom \"spoke to the question,\" but when he did  people leaned forward to listen, and more especially the rows of the  careless and ungodly under the gallery. Kenny had not the look of an  elder, and indeed, many wondered how he had ever come to be chosen for  the office. But the others all had the look of elders, and carried with  them the full respect and affection of the congregation. Even the young  men under the gallery regarded them with reverence for their godly  character, but for other things as well; for these old men had been  famous in their day, and tales were still told about the firesides of  the people of their prowess in the woods and on the river.    There was, for instance, Finlay McEwen, or McKeowen, as they all  pronounced it in that country, who, for a wager, had carried a  four-hundred-pound barrel upon each hip across the long bridge over the  Scotch River. And next him sat Donald Ross, whose very face, with its  halo of white hair, bore benediction with it wherever he went. What a  man he must have been in his day! Six feet four inches he stood in his  stocking soles, and with \"a back like a barn door,\" as his son Danny,  or \"Curly,\" now in the shanty with Macdonald Bhain, used to say, in  affectionate pride. Then there was Farquhar McNaughton, big, kindly, and  good-natured, a mighty man with the ax in his time. \"Kirsty's Farquhar\"  they called him, for obvious reasons. And a good thing for Farquhar it  was that he had had Kirsty at his side during these years to make his  bargains for him and to keep him and all others to them, else he would  never have become the substantial man he was.    Next to Farquhar was Peter McRae, the chief of a large clan of  respectable, and none too respectable, families, whom all alike held  in fear, for Peter ruled with a rod of iron, and his word ran as law  throughout the clan. Then there was Ian More Macgregor, or \"Big John  Macgregor,\" as the younger generation called him, almost as big as  Donald Ross and quite as kindly, but with a darker, sadder face.  Something from his wilder youth had cast its shadow over his life. No  one but his minister and two others knew that story, but the old man  knew it himself, and that was enough. One of those who shared his secret  was his neighbor and crony, Donald Ross, and it was worth a journey of  some length to see these two great old men, one with the sad and the  other with the sunny face, stride off together, staff in hand, at the  close of the Gaelic service, to Donald's home, where the afternoon would  be spent in discourse fitting the Lord's day and in prayer.    The only other elder was Roderick McCuiag, who sat, not in the elders'  pew, but in the precentor's box, for he was the Leader of Psalmody.  \"Straight Rory,\" as he was called by the irreverent, was tall, spare,  and straight as a ramrod. He was devoted to his office, jealous of  its dignity, and strenuous in his opposition to all innovations in  connection with the Service of Praise. He was especially opposed to  the introduction of those \"new-fangled ranting\" tunes which were  being taught the young people by John \"Alec\" Fraser in the weekly  singing-school in the Nineteenth, and which were sung at Mrs. Murray's  Sabbath evening Bible class in the Little Church. Straight Rory had been  educated for a teacher in Scotland, and was something of a scholar.  He loved school examinations, where he was the terror of pupils and  teachers alike. His acute mind reveled in the metaphysics of theology,  which made him the dread of all candidates who appeared before the  session desiring \"to come forward.\" It was to many an impressive sight  to see Straight Rory rise in the precentor's box, feel round, with much  facial contortion, for the pitch--he despised a tuning-fork--and then,  straightening himself up till he bent over backwards, raise the chant  that introduced the tune to the congregation. But to the young men under  the gallery he was more humorous than impressive, and it is to be feared  that they waited for the precentor's weekly performance with a delighted  expectation that never flagged and that was never disappointed. It was  only the flash of the minister's blue eye that held their faces rigid  in preternatural solemnity, and forced them to content themselves with  winks and nudges for the expression of their delight.    As Maimie's eye went wandering shyly over the rows of brown faces that  turned in solemn and steadfast regard to the minister's pew, Hughie  nudged her and whispered: \"There's Don. See, in the back seat by the  window, next to Peter Ruagh yonder; the red-headed fellow.\"    He pointed to Peter McRae, grandson of \"Peter the Elder.\" There was no  mistaking that landmark.    \"Look,\" cried Hughie, eagerly, pointing with terrible directness  straight at Don, to Maimie's confusion.    \"Whisht, Hughie,\" said his mother softly.    \"There's Ranald, mother,\" said the diplomatic Hughie, knowing well that  his mother would rejoice to hear that bit of news. \"See, mother, just in  front of Don, there.\"    Again Hughie's terrible finger pointed straight into the face of the  gazing congregation.    \"Hush, Hughie,\" said his mother, severely.    Maimie knew a hundred eyes were looking straight at the minister's pew,  but for the life of her she could not prevent her eye following the  pointing finger, till it found the steady gaze of Ranald fastened upon  her. It was only for a moment, but in that moment she felt her heart  jump and her face grow hot, and it did not help her that she knew that  the people were all wondering at her furious blushes. Of course the  story of the sugaring-off had gone the length of the land and had formed  the subject of conversation at the church door that morning, where  Ranald had to bear a good deal of chaff about the young lady, and her  dislike of forfeits, till he was ready to fight if a chance should but  offer. With unspeakable rage and confusion, he noticed Hughie's pointing  finger. He caught, too, Maimie's quick look, with the vivid blush that  followed. Unfortunately, others besides himself had noticed this, and  Don and Peter Ruagh, in the seat behind him, made it the subject of  congratulatory remarks to Ranald.    At this point the minister rose in the pulpit, and all waited with  earnest and reverent mien for the announcing of the psalm.    The Rev. Alexander Murray was a man to be regarded in any company and  under any circumstances, but when he stood up in his pulpit and faced  his congregation he was truly superb. He was above the average height,  of faultless form and bearing, athletic, active, and with a \"spring in  every muscle.\" He had coal-black hair and beard, and a flashing blue eye  that held his people in utter subjection and put the fear of death upon  evil-doers under the gallery. In every movement, tone, and glance there  breathed imperial command.    \"Let us worship God by singing to His praise in the one hundred and  twenty-first psalm:           'I to the hills will lift mine eyes,        From whence doth come mine aid.'\"      His voice rang out over the congregation like a silver bell, and Maimie  thought she had never seen a man of such noble presence.    After the reading of the psalm the minister sat down, and Straight Rory  rose in his box, and after his manner, began feeling about for the first  note of the chant that would introduce the noble old tune \"St. Paul's.\"  A few moments he spent twisting his face and shoulders in a manner that  threatened to ruin the solemnity of the worshipers under the gallery,  till finally he seemed to hit upon the pitch desired, and throwing back  his head and closing one eye, he proceeded on his way. Each line he  chanted alone, after the ancient Scottish custom, after which the  congregation joined with him in the tune. The custom survived from the  time when psalm-books were in the hands of but few and the \"lining\" of  the psalm was therefore necessary.    There was no haste to be done with the psalm. Why should there be? They  had only one Sabbath in the week, and the whole day was before them.  The people surrendered themselves to the lead of Straight Rory with  unmistakable delight in that part of \"the exercises\" of the day in which  they were permitted to audibly join. But of all the congregation, none  enjoyed the singing more than the dear old women who sat in the front  seats near the pulpit, their quiet old faces looking so sweet and pure  under their snow-whit"]]]
