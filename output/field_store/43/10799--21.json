I mention this only in reprobation of the unpleasant name that really  hurts the estimation of one of the most desirable and beautiful of  America's smaller trees. The American red-bud is a joy in the spring  about dogwood time, for it is all bloom, and of a most striking color.  Deep pink, or purplish light red, or clear bright magenta--all these  color names fit it approximately only. One is conscious of a warm glow  in looking toward the little trees, with every branch clear down to the  main stem not only outlined but covered with richest color.    There is among the accompanying illustrations (page 201) a photograph of  a small but characteristic red-bud in bloom, looking at which reminds me  of one of the pleasantest experiences of my outdoor life. With a  cameristic associate, I was in a favorite haunt, seeing dogwoods and  red-buds and other things of spring beauty, when a sudden warm thunder  shower overtook us. Somewhat protected in our carriage--and it would  have been more fun if we had stood out to take the rain as comfortably  as did the horse--we saw the wonder of the reception of a spring shower  by the exuberant plant life we were there to enjoy. When the clouds  suddenly obscured the sky, and the first drops began to fall, the soft  new umbrellas of the May-apples, raised to shield the delicate white  flowers hidden under them from the too ardent sunshine, reversed the  usual method by closing tightly and smoothly over the blooms, thus  protecting perfectly their pollen hearts, and offering little resistance  to the sharp wind that brought the rain. At our very feet we could see  the open petals of the spring beauty coil up into tight little spirals,  the young leaves on the pin-oaks draw in toward the stems from which  they had been expanding. Over the low fence, the blue phlox, that dainty  carpeting of the May woods, shut its starry flowers, and lay close to  the ground. Quiet as we were, we could see the birds find sheltered  nooks in the trees about us.    But soon the rain ceased, the clouds passed away, and the sun shone  again, giving us a rainbow promise on the passing drops. Everything woke  up! The birds were first to rejoice, and a veritable oratorio of praise  and joyfulness sounded about our ears. The leaves quickly expanded,  fresher than ever; the flowers uncurled and unfolded, the May-apple  umbrellas raised again; and all seemed singing a song as joyous as that  of the birds, though audible only to the nerves of eye and brain of the  human beings who had thus witnessed another of nature's interior  entertainments.    How much we miss by reason of fear of a little wetting! Many of the  finest pictures painted by the Master of all art are visible only in  rain and in mist; and the subtlest coloring of tree leaf and tree stem  is that seen only when the dust is all washed away by the shower that  should have no terrors for those who care for the truths of nature. In  these days of rain-proof clothing, seeing outdoors in the rain is not  even attended by the slightest discomfort, and I have found my camera  quite able to stand a shower!    Another of the early spring-flowering small trees--indeed, the earliest  one that blooms in white--is the shad-bush, or service-berry. Again the  \"common\" names are trifling and inadequate; shad-bush because the  flowers come when the shad are ascending the rivers along which the  trees grow, and service-berry because the pleasant fruits are of  service, perhaps! June-berry, another name, is better; but the genus  owns the mellifluous name of Amelanchier, and the term Canadensis  belongs to the species with the clouds of little white flowers shaped  like a thin-petaled star. The shad-bush blooms with the trilliums--but I  may not allow the spring flowers to set me spinning on another hank!    [Illustration: Blooms of the shad-bush]    Searching for early recollections of trees, I remember, when a boy of  six or seven, finding some little green berries or fruits, each with its  long stem, on the pavement under some great trees in the Capitol Park of  my home town. I could eat these; and thus they pleased the boy as much  as the honey-sweet flowers that gave rise to them now please the man.  The noble American linden, one of the really great trees of our forests,  bears these delicate whitish flowers, held in rich clusters from a  single stem which is attached for part of its length to a curious long  green bract. If these flowers came naked on the tree, as do those of the  Norway maple, for instance, they would be easily seen and admired of  men, but being withheld until the splendid heart-shaped foliage is well  out, the blooms miss the casual eye. But the bees see them; they know  the linden for their own, and great stores of sweetest honey follow a  year when abundant pasture of these flowers is available.    [Illustration: Flowers of the American linden]    A kindly tree is this linden, or lime, or basswood, to give it all its  common names. Kindly as well as stately, but never rugged as the oak, or  of obvious pliant strength as the hickory. The old tree invites to shade  under its limbs crowded with broad leaves; the young tree is lusty of  growth and clean of bark, a model of rounded beauty and a fine variant  from the overworked maples of our streets.    Again, the tale of woe! for the great lindens of our forests are nearly  all gone. Too useful for timber; too easy to fell; its soft, smooth,  even wood too adaptable to many uses! Cut them all; strip the bark for  \"bast,\" or tying material; America is widening; the sawmills cannot be  idle; scientific and decent forestry, so successful and so usual in  Europe, is yet but a dream for future generations here in America!    But other lindens, those of Europe especially, are loved of the  landscape architect and the Germans. \"Unter den Linden,\" Berlin's famous  street, owes its name, fame and shade to the handsome European species,  the white-lined leaves of which turn up in the faintest breeze, to show  silvery against the deep green of their upper surfaces. Very many of  these fine lindens are being planted now in America by landscape  architects, and there are some lindens on Long Island just as prim and  trim as any in Berlin. Indeed, there is a sort of German \"offiziere\"  waxed-mustache air of superiority about them, anyway!    [Illustration: The American linden]    There is an all-pervading Middle States tree that I might give a common  name to as the \"fence-post tree,\" because it is so often grown for that  use only, by reason of its enduring timber and its exceeding vigor under  hard usage. Yet the common black locust is one of the most distinct and  pleasing American trees of moderate height. Distinct it is in its  framework in winter, mayhap with the twisted pods of last season's  fruits hanging free; distinct again in its long-delayed late-coming  acacia-like foliage; but fragrant, elegant and beautiful, as well as  distinct, when in June it sets forth its long, drooping racemes of  whitest and sweetest flowers. These come only when warm weather is an  assured fact, and the wise Pennsylvania Germans feel justified in  awaiting the blooming of the locust before finally discarding their  winter underclothing!    For years a family of my knowledge has held it necessary, for its proper  conduct, to have in order certain floral drives. First the apple  blossom drive introduces the spring, and the lilac drive confirms the  impression that really the season is advancing; but the locust drive is  the sweetest of all, taking these nature lovers along some shady lanes,  beside the east bank of a great river, and in places where, the trees  planted only for the fence utility of the hard yellow wood, these  fragrant flowers, hanging in grace and elegance far above the highway,  have redeemed surroundings otherwise sordid and mean.    [Illustration: Flowers of the black locust]    I want Americans to prize the American locust for its real beauty. The  French know it, and show with pride their trifling imported specimens.  We cannot exterminate the trees, and there will be plenty for posts,  too; but let us realize its sweetness and elegance, as well as the  durability of its structure.    [Illustration: Young trees of the black locust]    There are fashions in trees, if you please, and the nurserymen set them.  Suddenly they discover the merits of some long-forgotten tree, and it  jumps into prominence. Thus, only a few years ago, the pin-oak came into  vogue, to the lasting benefit of some parks, avenues and home grounds.  Then followed the sycamore, but it had to be the European variety, for  our own native \"plane tree,\" or \"button-ball,\" is too plentiful and easy  to sing much of a tree-seller's song about. This Oriental plane is a  fine tree, however, and the avenue in Fairmount Park that one may see  from trains passing over the Schuylkill river is admirable. The bark is  mottled in green, and especially bright when wet with rain. As the  species is free from the attacks of a nasty European \"bug,\" or fungus,  which is bothering the American plane, it is much safer to handle,  commercially.    But our stately American sycamore is in a different class. One never  thinks of it as a lawn tree, or as bordering a fashionable roadway;  rather the expectation is to find it along a brook, in a meadow, or in  some rather wild and unkempt spot. As one of the scientific books begins  of it, \"it is a tree of the first magnitude.\" I like that expression;  for the sycamore gives an impression of magnitude and breadth; it  spreads out serenely and comfortably.    My friend Professor Bailey says _Platanus occidentalis_, which is the  truly right name of this tree, has no title to the term sycamore; it is  properly, as his Cyclopedia gives it, Buttonwood, or Plane. Hunting  about a little among tree books, I find the reason for this, and that it  explains"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2882"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 4 (#17)"],[1," idols than that  God should be held responsible for my misfortune, and His Name  thus be desecrated.\" Hushai reproached him: \"Why didst thou  marry a captive?\" \"There is no wrong in that,\" replied David, \"it is  permitted according to the law.\" Thereupon Hushai: \"But thou  didst disregard the connection between the passage permitting it  and the one that follows almost immediately after it in the  Scriptures, dealing with the disobedient and rebellious son, the  natural issue of such a marriage.\" (101)    Hushai was not the only faithful friend and adherent David had.  Some came to his rescue unexpectedly, as, for instance, Shobi, the  son of Nahash, who is identical with the Ammonite king Hanun,  the enemy of David at first, and later his ally. (102) Barzillai,  another one of his friends in need, also surprised him by his  loyalty, for on the whole his moral attitude was not the highest  conceivable. (103)    Absalom's end was beset with terrors. When he was caught in the  branches of the oak-tree, he was about to sever his hair with a  sword stroke, but suddenly he saw hell yawning beneath him, and  he preferred to hang in the tree to throwing himself into the abyss  alive. (104) Absalom's crime was, indeed, of a nature to deserve  the supreme torture, for which reason he is one of the few Jews  who have no portion in the world to come. (105) His abode is in  hell, where he is charged with the control of ten heathen nations in  the second division. Whenever the avenging angels sit in judgment  on the nations, they desire to visit punishment on Absalom, too,  but each time a heavenly voice is heard to call out: \"Do not  chastise him, do not burn him. He is an Israelite, the son of My  servant David.\" Whereupon Absalom is set upon his throne, and is  accorded the treatment due to a king. (106) That the extreme  penalties of hell were thus averted from him, was on account of  David's eightfold repetition of his son's name in his lament over  him. Besides, David's intercession had the effect of re-attaching  Absalom's severed head to his body. (107)    At his death Absalom was childless, for all his children, his three  sons and his daughter, died before him, as a punishment for his  having set fire to a field of grain belonging to Joab. (108)      DAVID'S ATONEMENT    All these sufferings did not suffice to atone for David's sin. God  once said to him: \"How much longer shall this sin be hidden in thy  hand and remain unatoned? On thy account the priestly city of Nob  was destroyed, (109) on thy account Doeg the Edomite was cast  out of the communion of the pious, and on thy account Saul and  his three sons were slain. What dost thou desire now--that thy  house should perish, or that thou thyself shouldst be delivered into  the hands of thine enemies?\" David chose the latter doom.    It happened one day when he was hunting, Satan, in the guise of a  deer, enticed him further and further, into the very territory of the  Philistines, where he was recognized by Ishbi the giant, the brother  of Goliath, his adversary. Desirous of avenging his brother, he  seized David, and cast him into a winepress, where the king would  have suffered a torturous end, if by a miracle the earth beneath him  had not begun to sink, and so saved him from instantaneous death.  His plight, however, remained desperate, and it required a second  miracle to rescue him.    In that hour Abishai, the cousin of David, was preparing for the  advent of the Sabbath, for the king's misfortune happened on  Friday as the Sabbath was about to come in. When Abishai poured  out water to wash himself, he suddenly caught sight of drops of  blood in it. Then he was startled by a dove that came to him  plucking out her plumes, and moaning and wailing. Abishai  exclaimed: \"The dove is the symbol of the people of Israel. It  cannot be but that David, the king of Israel, is in distress.\" Not  finding the king at home, he was confirmed in his fears, and he  determined to go on a search for David on the swiftest animal at  his command, the king's own saddle-beast. But first he had to  obtain the permission of the sages to mount the animal ridden by  the king, for the law forbids a subject to avail himself of things set  aside for the personal use of a king. Only the impending danger  could justify the exception made in this case.    Scarcely had Abishai mounted the king's animal, when he found  himself in the land of the Philistines, for the earth had contracted  miraculously. He met Orpah, the mother of the four giant sons. She  was about to kill him, but he anticipated the blow and slew her.  Ishbi, seeing that he now had two opponents, stuck his lance into  the ground, and hurled David up in the air, in the expectation that  when he fell he would be transfixed by the lance. At that moment  Abishai appeared, and by pronouncing the Name of God he kept  David suspended 'twixt heaven and earth.    Abishai questioned David how such evil plight had overtaken him,  and David told him of his conversation with God, and how he  himself had chosen to fall into the hands of the enemy, rather than  permit the ruin of his house. Abishai replied: \"Reverse thy prayer,  plead for thyself, and not for thy descendants. Let thy children sell  wax, and do thou not afflict thyself about their destiny.\" The two  men joined their prayers, and pleaded with God to avert David's  threatening doom. Abishai again uttered the Name of God, and  David dropped to earth uninjured. Now both of them ran away  swiftly, pursued by Ishbi. When the giant heard of his mother's  death, his strength forsook him, and he was slain by David and  Abishai. (110)      VISITATIONS    Among the sorrows of David are the visitations that came upon  Palestine during his reign, and he felt them all the more as he had  incurred them through his own fault. There was first the famine,  which was so desolating that it is counted among the ten severest  that are to happen from the time of Adam to the time of the  Messiah. (111) During the first year that it prevailed, David had an  investigation set on foot to discover whether idolatry was practiced  in the land, and was keeping back the rain. His suspicion proved  groundless. The second year he looked into the moral conditions of  his realm, for lewdness can bring about the same punishment as  idolatry. Again he was proved wrong. The third year, he turned his  attention to the administration of charity. Perhaps the people had  incurred guilt in this respect, for abuses in this department also  were visited with the punishment of famine. (112) Again his  search was fruitless, and he turned to God to inquire of Him the  cause of the public distress. God's reply was: \"Was not Saul a king  anointed with holy oil, did he not abolish idolatry, is he not the  companion of Samuel in Paradise? Yet, while you all dwell in the  land of Israel, he is 'outside of the land.'\" David, accompanied by  the scholars and the nobles of his kingdom, at once repaired to  Jabesh-gilead, disinterred the remains of Saul and Jonathan, and in  solemn procession bore them through the whole land of Israel to  the inheritance of the tribe of Benjamin. There they were buried.  The tributes of affection paid by the people of Israel to its dead  king aroused the compassion of God, and the famine came to an  end. (113)    The sin against Saul was now absolved, but there still remained  Saul's own guilt in his dealings with the Gibeonites, who charged  him with having killed seven of their number. David asked God  why He had punished His people on account of proselytes. God's  answer to him was: \"If thou dost not bring near them that are far  off, thou wilt remove them that are near by.\" To satisfy their  vengeful feelings, the Gibeonites demanded the life of seven  members of Saul's family. David sought to mollify them,  representing to them that they would derive no benefit from the  death of their victims, and offering them silver and gold instead.  But though David treated with each one of them individually, the  Gibeonites were relentless. When he realized their hardness of  heart, he cried out: \"Three qualities God gave unto Israel; they are  compassionate, chaste, and gracious in the service of their  fellow-men. The first of these qualities the Gibeonites do not  possess, and therefore they must be excluded from communion  with Israel.\" (114)    The seven descendants of Saul to be surrendered to the Gibeonites  were determined by letting all his posterity pass by the Ark of the  law. Those who were arrested before it were the designated  victims. Mephibosheth would have been one of the unfortunates,  had he not been permitted to pass by unchecked in answer to the  prayer of David, (115) to whom he was dear, not only as the son of  his friend Jonathan, but also as the teacher who instructed him in  the Torah. (116)    The cruel fate that befell the descendants of Saul had a wholesome  effect. All the heathen who saw and heard exclaimed: \"There is no  God like unto the God of Israel, there is no nation like unto the  nation of Israel; the wrong inflicted upon wretched proselytes has  been expiated by the sons of kings.\" So great was the enthusiasm  among the heathen over this manifestation of the Jewish sense of  justice that one hundred and fifty thousand of them were converted  to Judaism. (117)    As for David, his wrong in connection with the famine lay in his  not having applied his private wealth to the amelioration of the  people's suffering. When David returned victorious from the  combat with Goliath, the women of Israel gave him their gold and  silver ornaments. He put them aside for use in building the  Temple, and even during the three years' famine this fund was not  touched. God said: \"Thou didst refrain from rescuing human  beings from death, in order to save thy money for the Temple.  Verily, the Temple shall not be built by thee, but by Solomon.\"  (118)    David is still more"]]]
