Then  Peck's brigade of Couch's division came, and was put in on the right, the  One Hundred and Second Pennsylvania and the Fifty-fifth New York on the  left, the Sixty-second New York in the wood, the Ninety-third Pennsylvania  on the left, and after a little the Ninety-eighth Pennsylvania.    Before the reinforcements arrived for Hooker's relief, Anderson had  established his advance line of skirmishers, so as to cover with their  fire Webber's guns that were abandoned. The Federal reinforcing columns  drove back his advance line, when, in turn, he reinforced, recovered the  ground, and met General Peck, who led the last reinforcing brigade. This  advance was so firm that General Peck found it necessary to put in his  last regiment, the Ninety-eighth Pennsylvania, but neither our force nor  our condition of march could warrant further aggressive work of our right.  General Couch, left in command on the Federal left, posted his troops for  the night,--General Devens with the Seventh Massachusetts Regiment and  Second Rhode Island, General Palmer with two, and General Keim with three  other regiments, supporting General Peck. General Peck's ammunition being  exhausted, his brigade was relieved by six of the new regiments, and  reported that \"Every preparation was made to resist a night attack.\"[10]  On the Confederate side, General Anderson reported his position safe to  hold until the time to withdraw for the march. About noon, General  Hancock, in command of his own and Davidson's brigades in front of our  left, started with three of his own regiments and two of Davidson's and  the six-gun battery under Lieutenant Carson in search of the unoccupied  redoubts in that quarter. He approached by the dam at Sanders's Pond,  passed the dam, and occupied one of the redoubts, leaving three companies  to guard a road crossing on the right of his line of march. He put three  companies of infantry in the redoubt and advanced his regiments and  battery to the field in front. He then found another redoubt not occupied,  and posted three other companies in it. He was reinforced by a four-gun  battery under Captain Wheeler, which he posted in rear of his line of  battle and awaited developments. When the last engagement on our right had  calmed down to exchange of desultory shots, D. H. Hill's division was  waiting to know if Anderson would need further support. Meanwhile, some of  his officers had made a reconnoissance in front of his ground, and  reported a route by which favorable attack could be made upon the Federals  at the redoubt under Hancock.    General Johnston had arrived at my head-quarters, near Fort Magruder, when  General Hill sent to report the reconnoissance, and to ask that he be  allowed to make a move against Hancock, by Early's brigade. General  Johnston received the message, and referred the officer to me. I ordered  that the move should not be made, explaining that we were only fighting  for time to draw off our trains, that aggressive battle was necessary on  our right in order to keep the enemy back in the woodland from the open,  where, by his superior artillery and numbers, he might deploy beyond our  limits, and turn us out of position; that on our left there was no cause  for apprehension of such action, and we could not risk being drawn into  serious delay by starting new work so late in the day. Very soon General  Hill rode over to report of the opportunity: that he thought he could get  through before night, and would not be likely to involve delay of our  night march. General Johnston referred him to me. I said,--        \"The brigade you propose to use is not in safe hands. If you will go      with it, and see that the troops are properly handled, you can make      the attack, but don't involve us so as to delay the march after      night.\"    In a letter from General Hill, after the war, he wrote of the fight by  this brigade,--        \"I cannot think of it, till this day, without horror. The slaughter of      the Fifth North Carolina Regiment was one of the most awful things I      ever saw, and it was caused by a blunder. At your request, I think, I      followed Early's brigade, following the right wing.\"    General Hill was in advance of the brigade with the Fifth and Twenty-third  North Carolina Regiments, General Early in rear with the Twenty-fourth and  Thirty-eighth Virginia Regiments. General Hill ordered the advance  regiments to halt after crossing a streamlet and get under cover of the  wood till the brigade could form; but General Early, not waiting for  orders or the brigade, rode to the front of the Twenty-fourth Virginia,  and with it made the attack. The gallant McRae, of the Fifth North  Carolina, seeing the Twenty-fourth Virginia hotly engaged, dashed forward,  _nolens volens_, to its relief. The other regiments, seeing the confusion  of movements and of orders, failed to go forward. Part of my troops, on  Early's right, seeing that a fight was open on that part of the field,  started without orders to go to his relief, but found the fight lost  before they were engaged. After the brigade was collected on its first  position, General Johnston rode to his head-quarters. At dark the  Confederates were withdrawn and took up the line of march, the division  of D. H. Hill taking the rear of the column, Rains's brigade the rear of  the division. On his march, General Rains found, in a broken-down  ammunition-wagon, several loaded shells, four of them with sensitive fuse  primers, which he placed near some fallen trees, cut down as obstructions.  He afterwards heard that some of them were tramped upon by the Federal  cavalry and exploded.    The pursuit was not active, hardly annoying. The roads were cut into deep  mud by the trains, and the side-ways by troops far out on either side,  making puddles ankle-deep in all directions, so that the march was slow  and trying, but giving almost absolute safe-conduct against pursuit, and  our men were allowed to spread their ranks in search of ground strong  enough to bear them.    My estimate, made on the field, of the troops engaged was, Confederate,  9000; Union, 12,000. The casualties of the engagement were, Confederate,  1565 aggregate;[11] Federal, 2288 aggregate.[12]    General McClellan was at Yorktown during the greater part of the day to  see Franklin's, Sedgwick's, and Richardson's divisions aboard the  transports for his proposed flanking and rear move up York River, but upon  receiving reports that the engagement at Williamsburg was growing serious  and not satisfactory, he rode to the battle, and called the divisions of  Sedgwick and Richardson to follow him.    The object of the battle was to gain time to haul our trains to places of  safety. The effect, besides, was to call two of the divisions from their  flanking move to support the battle, and this so crippled that expedition  that it gave us no serious trouble. The trophies of the battle were with  the Confederates, and they claim the honor to inscribe Williamsburg upon  their battle-flags.    The success of General Hancock in holding his position in and about the  forts with five regiments and two batteries against the assault of the  Fifth North Carolina and Twenty-fourth Virginia Regiments was given heroic  proportions by his chief, who christened him \"The Superb,\" to relieve, it  is supposed, by the picturesque figure on his right, the discomfiture of  his left. But, reading between the lines, the highest compliment was for  the two Confederate regiments.    In his official account, General Johnston said,--        \"The action gradually increased in magnitude until about three      o'clock, when General Longstreet, commanding the rear, requested that      a part of Major-General Hill's troops might be sent to his aid. Upon      this I rode upon the field, but found myself compelled to be a      spectator, for General Longstreet's clear head and brave heart left no      apology for interference.\"    Franklin's division was taken by transports to the mouth of Pamunkey  River, and was supported by the navy. On the 7th a brigade of Sedgwick's  division joined Franklin. On the same day, Johnston's army was collected  near Barhamville. General Whiting, with Hood's brigade and part of  Hampton's, engaged the advance of Franklin's command and forced it back.  This cleared our route of march towards Richmond, Smith's and Magruder's  divisions by the road to New Kent Court-House, Hill's and Longstreet's  nearer the Chickahominy.    General McClellan's plans were laid according to strict rules of strategy,  but he was not quick or forcible in handling his troops.          CHAPTER VII.    SEVEN PINES, OR FAIR OAKS.

On the 9th of May the Confederate army was halted, its right near Long  Bridge of the Chickahominy River; its left and cavalry extending towards  the Pamunkey through New Kent Court-House. On the 11th the commander of  the Confederate ram \"Virginia\" (\"Merrimac\"), finding the water of James  River not sufficient to float her to the works near Richmond, scuttled and  sank the ship where she lay.    On the 15th the Federal navy attacked our works at Chapin's and Drury's  Bluffs, but found them too strong for water batteries. That attack  suggested to General Johnston that he move nearer Richmond to be in  position to lend the batteries assistance in case of need. He crossed the  Chickahominy, his right wing at Long Bridge, his left by Bottom's Bridge,  and took position from Drury's Bluff on his right, to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38478"],[0,"Narrative of the Circumnavigation of the Globe (#17)"],[1," |    -------------------|---|---|---|---|---|    Government         | 1 | 2 | - | 2 | 2 |                       |   |   |   |   |   |                       |   |   |   |   |   |                       |   |   |   |   |   |    Governor           | - | 1 | 3 | - | 2 |                       |   |   |   |   |   |                       |   |   |   |   |   |    Lieut.-Governor    | - | - | - | - | - |                       |   |   |   |   |   |    Officers & men   } | - | - | - | - | 1 |    of the detachment} |   |   |   |   |   |                       |   |   |   |   |   |    Staff              | - | - | - | - | - |                       |   |   |   |   |   |    Other individuals  | - | - | - | - | - |    -------------------|---|---|---|---|---|         Totals        | 1 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 5 |                        |  Sheep.   | G | H | P | R | T | G | D | F | C |                      |           | o | o | i | a | u | e | u | o | h |                      |           | a | g | g | b | r | e | c | w | i |                      |           | t | s | s | b | k | s | k | l | c |                      |           | s | . | . | i | e | e | s | s | k |                      |           | . |   |   | t | y | . | . | . | e |                      |           |   |   |   | s | s |   |   |   | n |                      |           |   |   |   | . | . |   |   |   | s |    TO WHOM BELONGING.|           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | . |                      |           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    ------------------+-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|    Government        |{Ram     1 |  1| 20| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |                      |{Ewes   12 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |                      |{Wethers 3 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |                      |           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    Governor          |{Ewe     1 | - | 10| - |  3|  5|  8| 17| 22| - |                      |{Lamb    1 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |                      |           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    Lieut.-Governor   |   -       |  1|  1|  7| - |  5|  6|  4|  9| - |                      |           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    Officers & men   }|   -       | 12| 10| 17|  2|  6|  9|  8| 55| 25|    of the detachment}|           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |                      |           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    Staff             |   -    11 |  5|  7|  1| - |  2|  6|  6| 36| 62|                      |           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    Other individuals |   -       | - |  1| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |    ------------------+-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|         Totals       |        29 | 19| 49| 25|  5| 18| 29| 35|122| 87|    At present there are in this colony, 180,000 horses, 2,148,660 cattle, and  109,160 pigs.    [23] The sheep-breeders of the colony competed for the honour of  purchasing these valuable animals.    [24] The distance of the various gold-fields from Sydney and the various  harbours of the colony is as follows. _Western Gold-fields_,--Bathurst 110  miles, Sofala 140, Orange 141, Ophir 146, Mudgee 155, Tambaroora 157,  Meroo 160, Louisa Creek 176, Tuena 190. _Southern_,--Goulburn 125,  Queanbeyan 182, Braidwood 184, Bill's Creek 190, Araleun 200, Sundagai  244, Cooma 254, Tumut 264, Adelong 273, Albury 286, Obin's River 410,  Kiandra or Guoroy River, over Twofold Bay and Bambula, 240 miles.  _Northern_,--Hangus Rock 304, Bingera Creek 365, Rocky River 357, Tamworth  280, Timbarra 67 miles from Clarence River, _via_ Grafton, overland. The  other gold-fields of the Clarence River District, such as Lubra, Toolam,  Emu Creek, Pretty Gully, Sandy Creek, Table Land, Nelson's Creek, &c., are  80 to 100 miles from the river.    [25] The colony of New South Wales consisted at that period of the entire  land comprised between Cape York in 11 deg. 37' S. to South Cape, 43 deg. 30' S.,  and as far as 135 deg. E. in the interior to the westward, including all  islands adjoining, comprised within those degrees of latitude.

[28] This Archipelago, remarkable by the size and loftiness of its  islands, extends from Batoa or South Island in the S.E. (19 deg. 47' S. by  179 deg. 52' E.), to Thicombea to the N. (15 deg. 47' S.), and Biva to the W.  (176 deg. 50' E.), and contains 225 islands and islets, of which about 80 are  inhabited. The entire superficial area is about 5700 square miles, and  upon a superficial estimate it contains 150,000 souls. The climate seems  to be eminently suitable for cotton culture, besides which sugar-cane,  coffee, tobacco, arrow-root, and most probably rice and indigo, may be  advantageously cultivated. Berchthold Seemann, the well-known botanist,  who made a scientific exploration of some of the Feejee Islands at the  expense of the English Government in the Autumn of 1860, discovered in the  valleys of Naona forests of the sago palm, whose nutritious flour might  become an important article of export. Dr. Petermann published in the  latter half of 1861, at page 67 of his valuable \"particulars of certain  important recent discoveries in geography,\" an interesting synopsis of all  the latest scientific information respecting the Feejee Archipelago.

Great was the interest excited at the Antipodes by the arrival of the  _Novara_, for besides the importance for European emigration of a country  possessing a healthy climate, a fertile soil, and but thinly peopled, it  was most gratifying to the members of the first Austrian Expedition to see  much hitherto unsuspected natural wealth made known to the inhabitants by  one of their scientific staff, and thus to prove of use to a nation which  in almost every part of the globe has so incontestably borne away the palm  in advancing the interests of science and the development of the treasures  of the earth.    Immediately after our arrival in Auckland, the Governor of the colony,  Colonel Gore Browne, renewed the request, previously made in his name to  our Commodore while at Sydney by Sir William Denison, that he would permit  our geologist to make a proper scientific examination of a portion of the  Drury District, in which there were certain indications supposing to point  to the existence of coal-fields. Upon his report would depend the  exploration and the establishing of a regular system of working the mines.  The little Expedition to the coal-fields, which was most munificently  equipped by the Government, proved successful beyond all expectation, so  much so as to induce the Governor to beg of our Commodore the further  favour of permitting our geologist to make a still longer stay on the  island, for the purpose of more accurately and completely surveying the  dependency. The negotiations upon this subject, fraught with such happy  results for both parties, will be found in the Appendix, while at the end  of this chapter we shall give a succinct sketch of what was accomplished  in the interests of science by the activity of Dr. Hochstetter, our  geologist, during his stay in New Zealand, the more copious details of his  eight months' stay at the Antipodes being reserved for a special volume.    New Zealand consists of two large islands separated from each other by  Cook's Straits, a splendid channel, 150 miles long by 50 in width, and the  two smaller islands, called Stewart's and Chatham Islands, about 50 by 20,  separated by Foveau Straits, the latter lying in the ocean about 400 miles  south-west of the province of Canterbury.    The entire group extends from 34 deg. to 48 deg. S., and 166 deg. to 179 deg. E. The  greatest extent of land, from N.E. to S.W., i. e. from Cape Maria Van  Diemen to South Cape, is over 1000 miles. The greatest breadth, along the  parallel of 38 deg. S. is about 200 miles, while the coast-line is several  thousand miles in extent. By the constitution of 1853, New Zealand is  divided into six"]]]
