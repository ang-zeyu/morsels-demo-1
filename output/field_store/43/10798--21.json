Prepotency of transmission may be equal in the two sexes of  the same species, but often runs more strongly in one sex. It plays an  important part in determining the rate at which one race can be modified or  wholly absorbed by repeated crosses with another. We can seldom tell what  makes one race or species prepotent over another; but it sometimes depends on  the same character being present and visible in one parent, and latent or  potentially present in the other.    Characters may first appear in either sex, but oftener in the male than in the  female, and afterwards be transmitted to the offspring of the same sex. In  this case we may feel confident that the peculiarity in question is really  present though latent in the opposite sex! hence the father may transmit  through his daughter any character to his grandson; and the mother conversely  to her granddaughter. We thus learn, and the fact is an important one, that  transmission and development are distinct powers. Occasionally these two  powers seem to be antagonistic, or incapable of combination in the same  individual; for several cases have been recorded in which the son has not  directly inherited a character from his father, or directly transmitted it to  his son, but has received it by transmission through his non-affected mother,  and transmitted it through his non-affected daughter. Owing to inheritance  being limited by sex, we see how secondary sexual characters may have arisen  under nature; their preservation and accumulation being dependent on their  service to either sex.    At whatever period of life a new character first appears, it generally remains  latent in the offspring until a corresponding age is attained, and then is  developed. When this rule fails, the child generally exhibits the character at  an earlier period than the parent. On this principle of inheritance at  corresponding periods, we can understand how it is that most animals display  from the germ to maturity such a marvellous succession of characters.    Finally, though much remains obscure with respect to Inheritance, we may look  at the following laws as fairly well established.    FIRSTLY, a tendency in every character, new and old, to be transmitted by  seminal and bud generation, though often counteracted by various known and  unknown causes.    SECONDLY, reversion or atavism, which depends on transmission and development  being distinct powers: it acts in various degrees and manners through both  seminal and bud generation.    THIRDLY, prepotency of transmission, which may be confined to one sex, or be  common to both sexes.    FOURTHLY, transmission, as limited by sex, generally to the same sex in which  the inherited character first appeared; and this in many, probably most cases,  depends on the new character having first appeared at a rather late period of  life.    FIFTHLY, inheritance at corresponding periods of life, with some tendency to  the earlier development of the inherited character.    In these laws of Inheritance, as displayed under domestication, we see an  ample provision for the production, through variability and natural selection,  of new specific forms.      CHAPTER 2.XV.    ON CROSSING.    FREE INTERCROSSING OBLITERATES THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ALLIED BREEDS.  WHEN THE NUMBERS OF TWO COMMINGLING BREEDS ARE UNEQUAL, ONE ABSORBS THE OTHER.  THE RATE OF ABSORPTION DETERMINED BY PREPOTENCY OF TRANSMISSION, BY THE  CONDITIONS OF LIFE, AND BY NATURAL SELECTION.  ALL ORGANIC BEINGS OCCASIONALLY INTERCROSS; APPARENT EXCEPTIONS.  ON CERTAIN CHARACTERS INCAPABLE OF FUSION; CHIEFLY OR EXCLUSIVELY THOSE WHICH  HAVE SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE INDIVIDUAL.  ON THE MODIFICATION OF OLD RACES, AND THE FORMATION OF NEW RACES BY CROSSING.  SOME CROSSED RACES HAVE BRED TRUE FROM THEIR FIRST PRODUCTION.  ON THE CROSSING OF DISTINCT SPECIES IN RELATION TO THE FORMATION OF DOMESTIC  RACES.    In the two previous chapters, when discussing reversion and prepotency, I was  necessarily led to give many facts on crossing. In the present chapter I shall  consider the part which crossing plays in two opposed directions,--firstly, in  obliterating characters, and consequently in preventing the formation of new  races; and secondly, in the modification of old races, or in the formation of  new and intermediate races, by a combination of characters. I shall also show  that certain characters are incapable of fusion.    The effects of free or uncontrolled breeding between the members of the same  variety or of closely allied varieties are important; but are so obvious that  they need not be discussed at much length. It is free intercrossing which  chiefly gives uniformity, both under nature and under domestication, to the  individuals of the same species or variety, when they live mingled together  and are not exposed to any cause inducing excessive variability. The  prevention of free crossing, and the intentional matching of individual  animals, are the corner-stones of the breeder's art. No man in his senses  would expect to improve or modify a breed in any particular manner, or keep an  old breed true and distinct, unless he separated his animals. The killing of  inferior animals in each generation comes to the same thing as their  separation. In savage and semi-civilised countries, where the inhabitants have  not the means of separating their animals, more than a single breed of the  same species rarely or never exists. In former times, even in the United  States, there were no distinct races of sheep, for all had been mingled  together. (15/1. 'Communications to the Board of Agriculture' volume 1 page  367.) The celebrated agriculturist Marshall (15/2. 'Review of Reports, North  of England' 1808 page 200.) remarks that \"sheep that are kept within fences,  as well as shepherded flocks in open countries, have generally a similarity,  if not a uniformity, of character in the individuals of each flock;\" for they  breed freely together, and are prevented from crossing with other kinds;  whereas in the unenclosed parts of England the unshepherded sheep, even of the  same flock, are far from true or uniform, owing to various breeds having  mingled and crossed. We have seen that the half-wild cattle in each of the  several British parks are nearly uniform in character; but in the different  parks, from not having mingled and crossed during many generations, they  differ to a certain small extent.    We cannot doubt that the extraordinary number of varieties and sub-varieties  of the pigeon, amounting to at least one hundred and fifty, is partly due to  their remaining, differently from other domesticated birds, paired for life  once matched. On the other hand, breeds of cats imported into this country  soon disappear, for their nocturnal and rambling habits render it hardly  possible to prevent free crossing. Rengger (15/3. 'Saugethiere von Paraguay'  1830 s. 212.) gives an interesting case with respect to the cat in Paraguay:  in all the distant parts of the kingdom it has assumed, apparently from the  effects of the climate, a peculiar character, but near the capital this change  has been prevented, owing, as he asserts, to the native animal frequently  crossing with cats imported from Europe. In all cases like the foregoing, the  effects of an occasional cross will be augmented by the increased vigour and  fertility of the crossed offspring, of which fact evidence will hereafter be  given; for this will lead to the mongrels increasing more rapidly than the  pure parent-breeds.    When distinct breeds are allowed to cross freely, the result will be a  heterogeneous body; for instance, the dogs in Paraguay are far from uniform,  and can no longer be affiliated to their parent-races. (15/4. Rengger  'Saugethiere' etc. s. 154.) The character which a crossed body of animals will  ultimately assume must depend on several contingencies,--namely, on the  relative members of the individuals belonging to the two or more races which  are allowed to mingle; on the prepotency of one race over the other in the  transmission of character; and on the conditions of life to which they are  exposed. When two commingled breeds exist at first in nearly equal numbers,  the whole will sooner or later become intimately blended, but not so soon,  both breeds being equally favoured in all respects, as might have been  expected. The following calculation (15/5. White 'Regular Gradation in Man'  page 146.) shows that this is the case: if a colony with an equal number of  black and white men were founded, and we assume that they marry  indiscriminately, are equally prolific, and that one in thirty annually dies  and is born; then \"in 65 years the number of blacks, whites, and mulattoes  would be equal. In 91 years the whites would be 1-10th, the blacks 1-10th, and  the mulattoes, or people of intermediate degrees of colour, 8-10ths of the  whole number. In three centuries not 1-100th part of the whites would exist.\"    When one of two mingled races exceed the other greatly in number, the latter  will soon be wholly, or almost wholly, absorbed and lost. (15/6. Dr. W.F.  Edwards in his 'Caracteres Physiolog. des Races Humaines' page 24 first called  attention to this subject, and ably discussed it.) Thus European pigs and dogs  have been largely introduced in the islands of the Pacific Ocean, and the  native races have been absorbed and lost in the course of about fifty or sixty  years (15/7. Rev. D. Tyerman and Bennett 'Journal of Voyages' 1821-1829 volume  1 page 300.); but the imported races no doubt were favoured. Rats may be  considered as semi-domesticated animals. Some snake-rats (Mus alexandrinus)  escaped in the Zoological Gardens of London \"and for a long time afterwards  the keepers frequently caught cross-bred rats, at first half-breds, afterwards"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28752"],[0,"Pleasures of the telescope (#17)"],[1,"magnitudes four and thirteen, but which exhibits much  irregularity in its maxima. The other star, not named but easily  recognized in the map, is sometimes called 17. It is an attractive  double whose colors faintly reproduce those of beta. The magnitudes are  five and eight, distance 26\", p. 73 deg.. Where the two arms of the cross  meet is gamma, whose remarkable _cortege_ of small stars running in  curved streams should not be missed. Use the lowest magnifying power.    At the extremity of the western arm of the cross is delta, a close  double, difficult for telescopes of moderate aperture on account of the  difference in the magnitudes of the components. We may succeed in  dividing it with the five-inch. The magnitudes are three and eight,  distance 1.5\", p. 310 deg.. It is regarded as a binary of long and as yet  unascertained period.    In omicron^2 we find a star of magnitude four and orange in color,  having two blue companions, the first of magnitude seven and a half,  distance 107\", p. 174 deg., and the second of magnitude five and a half,  distance 358\", p. 324 deg.. Farther north is psi, which presents to us the  combination of a white five-and-a-half-magnitude star with a lilac star  of magnitude seven and a half. The distance is 3\", p. 184 deg.. A very  pretty sight.    We now pass to the extremity of the other arm of the cross, near which  lies the beautiful little double 49, whose components are of magnitudes  six and eight, distance 2.8\", p. 50 deg.. The colors are yellow and blue,  conspicuous and finely contrasted. A neighboring double of similar hues  is 52, in which the magnitudes are four and nine, distance 6\", p. 60 deg..  Sweeping a little way northward we come upon an interesting binary,  lambda, which is unfortunately beyond the dividing power of our largest  glass. A good seven-inch or seven-and-a-half-inch should split it under  favorable circumstances. Its magnitudes are six and seven, distance  0.66\", p. 74 deg..    The next step carries us to a very famous object, 61 Cygni, long known  as the nearest star in the northern hemisphere of the heavens. It is a  double which our three-inch will readily divide, the magnitudes being  both six, distance 21\", p. 122 deg.. The distance of 61 Cygni, according to  Hall's parallax of 0.27\", is about 70,000,000,000,000 miles. There is  some question whether or not it is a binary, for, while the twin stars  are both moving in the same direction in space with comparative  rapidity, yet conclusive evidence of orbital motion is lacking. When one  has noticed the contrast in apparent size between this comparatively  near-by star, which the naked eye only detects with considerable  difficulty, and some of its brilliant neighbors whose distance is so  great as to be immeasurable with our present means, no better proof will  be needed of the fact that the faintness of a star is not necessarily an  indication of remoteness.    We may prepare our eyes for a beautiful exhibition of contrasted colors  once more in the star . This is really a quadruple, although only two of  its components are close and conspicuous. The magnitudes are five, six,  seven and a half, and twelve; distances 2.4\", p. 121 deg.; 208\", p. 56 deg.; and  35\", p. 264 deg.. The color of the largest star is white and that of its  nearest companion blue; the star of magnitude seven and a half is also  blue.    The star cluster 4681 is a fine sight with our largest glass. In the map  we find the place marked where the new star of 1876 made its appearance.  This was first noticed on November 24, 1876, when it shone with the  brilliance of a star of magnitude three and a half. Its spectrum was  carefully studied, especially by Vogel, and the very interesting changes  that it underwent were noted. Within a year the star had faded to less  than the tenth magnitude, and its spectrum had completely changed in  appearance, and had come to bear a close resemblance to that of a  planetary nebula. This has been quoted as a possible instance of a  celestial collision through whose effects the solid colliding masses  were vaporized and expanded into a nebula. At present the star is very  faint and can only be seen with the most powerful telescopes. Compare  with the case of Nova Aurigae, previously discussed.    Underneath Cygnus we notice the small constellation Vulpecula. It  contains a few objects worthy of attention, the first being the nebula  4532, the \"dumb-bell nebula\" of Lord Rosse. With the four-inch, and  better with the five-inch, we are able to perceive that it consists of  two close-lying tufts of misty light. Many stars surround it, and large  telescopes show them scattered between the two main masses of the  nebula. The Lick photographs show that its structure is spiral. The star  11 points out the place where a new star of the third magnitude appeared  in 1670. Sigma 2695 is a close double, magnitudes six and eight,  distance 0.96\", p. 78 deg..    [Illustration: MAP NO. 18.]    We turn to map No. 18, and, beginning at the western end of the  constellation Aquarius, we find the variable T, which ranges between  magnitudes seven and thirteen in a period of about two hundred and three  days. Its near neighbor Sigma 2729 is a very close double, beyond the  separating power of our five-inch, the magnitudes being six and seven,  distance 0.6\", p. 176 deg.. Sigma 2745, also known as 12 Aquarii, is a good  double for the three-inch. Its magnitudes are six and eight, distance  2.8\", p. 190 deg.. In zeta we discover a beauty. It is a slow binary of  magnitudes four and four, distance 3.1\", p. 321 deg.. According to some  observers both stars have a greenish tinge. The star 41 is a wider  double, magnitudes six and eight, distance 5\", p. 115 deg., colors yellow  and blue. The uncommon stellar contrast of white with light garnet is  exhibited by tau, magnitudes six and nine, distance 27\", p. 115 deg.. Yellow  and blue occur again conspicuously in psi, magnitudes four and a half  and eight and a half, distance 50\", p. 310 deg.. Rose and emerald have been  recorded as the colors exhibited in Sigma 2998, whose magnitudes are  five and seven, distance 1.3\", p. 346 deg..    The variables S and R are both red. The former ranges between magnitudes  eight and twelve, period two hundred and eighty days, and the latter  between magnitudes six and eleven, period about three hundred and ninety  days.    The nebula 4628 is Rosse's \"Saturn nebula,\" so called because with his  great telescope it presented the appearance of a nebulous model of the  planet Saturn. With our five-inch we see it simply as a planetary  nebula. We may also glance at another nebula, 4678, which appears  circular and is pinned with a little star at the edge.    The small constellation Equuleus contains a surprisingly large number of  interesting objects. Sigma 2735 is a rather close double, magnitudes six  and eight, distance 1.8\", p. 287 deg.. Sigma 2737 (the first star to the  left of Sigma 2735, the name having accidentally been omitted from the  map) is a beautiful triple, although the two closest stars, of  magnitudes six and seven, can not be separated by our instruments. Their  distance in 1886 was 0.78\", p. 286 deg., and they had then been closing  rapidly since 1884, when the distance was 1.26\". The third star, of  magnitude eight, is distant 11\", p. 75 deg.. Sigma 2744 consists of two  stars, magnitudes six and seven, distance 1.4\", p. 1.67 deg.. It is probably  a binary. Sigma 2742 is wider double, magnitudes both six, distance  2.6\", p. 225 deg.. Another triple, one of whose components is beyond our  reach, is gamma. Here the magnitudes are fifth, twelfth, and sixth,  distances 2\", p. 274 deg. and 366\". It would also be useless for us to try  to separate delta, but it is interesting to remember that this is one of  the closest of known double stars, the magnitudes being fourth and  fifth, distance 0.4\", p. 198 deg.. These data are from Hall's measurements  in 1887. The star is, no doubt, a binary. With the five-inch we may  detect one and perhaps two of the companion stars in the quadruple beta.  The magnitudes are five, ten, and two eleven, distances 67\", p. 309 deg.;  86\", p. 276 deg.; and 6.5\", p. 15 deg.. The close pair is comprised in the  tenth-magnitude star.    [Illustration: MAP NO. 19.]    Map No. 19 introduces us to the constellation Pegasus, which is  comparatively barren to the naked eye, and by no means rich in  telescopic phenomena. The star epsilon, of magnitude two and a half, has  a blue companion of the eighth magnitude, distance 138\", p. 324 deg.; colors  yellow and violet. A curious experiment that may be tried with this star  is described by Webb, who ascribes the discovery of the phenomenon to  Sir John Herschel. When near the meridian the small star in epsilon  appears, in the telescope, underneath the large one. If now the tube of  the telescope be slightly swung from side to side the small star will  appear to describe a pendulumlike movement with respect to the large  one. The explanation suggested is that the comparative faintness of the  small star causes its light to affect the retina of the eye less quickly  than does that of its brighter companion, and, in consequence, the  reversal of its apparent motion with the swinging of the telescope is  not perceived so soon.    The third-magnitude star eta has a companion of magnitude ten and a  half, distance 90\", p. 340 deg.. The star beta, of the second magnitude, and  reddish, is variable to the extent of half a magnitude in an irregular  period, and gamma, of magnitude two and a half, has an  eleventh-magnitude companion, distance 162\", p. 285 deg..    [Illustration: MAP NO. 20.]    Our interest is revived on turning, with the guidance of map No. 20,  from the comparative poverty of Pegasus to the spacious constellation  Cetus. The first double star that we meet in this constellation is 26,  whose components are of magnitudes six and"]]]
