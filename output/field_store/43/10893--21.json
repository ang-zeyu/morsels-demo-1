He was none too  sure upon that point himself, and he hesitated before he spoke again.    \"Very well,\" he said at length, \"suppose you stay another day to give  you a chance to pull yourself together. I'll come along to-morrow with a  tip-top invalid chair for you--is it a bet?\"    Mainward held out his shaking hand, and the ghost of a smile puckered  the corners of his eyes. \"It's a bet,\" he said.    He watched the Commissioner walk through the camp, speaking to one man  after another in a strange tongue. A singular, masterful man this,  thought Mainward. Would he have mastered Ethel? He watched the stranger  with curious eyes, and noted how his own lazy devils of carriers jumped  at his word.    \"Good-night,\" said Sanders' voice; and Mainward looked up. \"You must  take another of these pellets, and to-morrow you'll be as fit as a  donkey-engine. I've got to get back to my camp to-night, or I shall find  half my stores stolen in the morning; but if you'd rather I stopped----\"    \"No, no,\" replied the other hastily. He wanted to be alone. He had lots  of matters to settle with himself. There was the question of Ethel, for  instance.    \"You won't forget to take the tabloid?\"    \"No. I say, I'm awfully obliged to you for coming. You've been a good  white citizen.\"    Sanders smiled. \"Don't talk nonsense!\" he said good-humouredly. \"This is  all brotherly love. White to white, and kin to kin, don't you know?  We're all alone here, and there isn't a man of our colour within five  hundred miles. Good-night, and please take the tabloid----\"    Mainward lay listening to the noise of departure. He thought he heard a  little bell tingle. That must be for the engines. Then he heard the  puck-a-puck of the wheel--so that was how the steamer got its name.    Abiboo came with some milk. \"You take um medicine, master?\" he inquired.    \"I take um,\" murmured Mainward; but the green tabloid was underneath his  pillow.    Then there began to steal over him a curious sensation of content. He  did not analyse it down to its first cause. He had had sufficient  introspective exercise for one day. It came to him as a pleasant shock  to realise that he was happy.    He opened his eyes and looked round.    His bed was laid in the open, and he drew aside the curtains of his net  to get a better view.    A little man was walking briskly toward him along the velvet stretch of  grass that sloped down from the glade, and Mainward whistled.    \"Atty,\" he gasped. \"By all that's wonderful.\"    Atty, indeed, it was: the same wizened Atty as of yore; but no longer  pulling the long face to which Mainward had been accustomed. The little  man was in his white riding-breeches, his diminutive top-boots were  splashed with mud, and on the crimson of his silk jacket there was  evidence of a hard race. He touched his cap jerkily with his whip, and  shifted the burden of the racing saddle he carried to the other arm.    \"Why, Atty,\" said Mainward, with a smile, \"what on earth are you doing  here?\"    \"It's a short way to the jockey's room, sir,\" said the little man. \"I've  just weighed in. I thought the Fairy would do it, sir, and she did.\"    Mainward nodded wisely. \"I knew she would, too,\" he said.    \"Did she give you a smooth ride?\"    The jockey grinned again. \"She never does that,\" he said. \"But she ran  gamely enough. Coming up out of the Dip, she hung a little, but I showed  her the whip, and she came on as straight as a die. I thought once the  Stalk would beat us--I got shut in, but I pulled her round, and we were  never in difficulties. I could have won by ten lengths,\" said Atty.    \"You could have won by ten lengths,\" repeated Mainward in wonder. \"Well,  you've done me a good turn, Atty. This win will get me out of one of the  biggest holes that ever a reckless man tumbled into--I shall not forget  you, Atty.\"    \"I'm sure you won't, sir,\" said the little jockey gratefully; \"if you'll  excuse me now, sir----\"    Mainward nodded and watched him, as he moved quickly through the trees.    There were several people in the glade now, and Mainward looked down  ruefully at his soiled duck suit. \"What an ass I was to come like this,\"  he muttered in his annoyance. \"I might have known that I should have met  all these people.\"    There was one he did not wish to see; and as soon as he sighted Venn,  with his shy eyes and his big nose, Mainward endeavoured to slip back  out of observation. But Venn saw him, and came tumbling through the  trees, with his big, flabby hand extended and his dull eyes aglow.    \"Hullo, hullo!\" he grinned, \"been looking for you.\"    Mainward muttered some inconsequent reply. \"Rum place to find you, eh?\"  Venn removed his shining silk hat and mopped his brow with an awesome  silk handkerchief.    \"But look here, old feller--about that money?\"    \"Don't worry, my dear man,\" Mainward interposed easily. \"I shall pay you  now.\"    \"That ain't what I mean,\" said the other impetuously; \"a few hundred  more or less does not count. But you wanted a big sum----\"    \"And you told me you'd see me----\"    \"I know, I know,\" Venn put in hastily; \"but that was before Kaffirs  started jumpin'. Old feller, you can have it!\"    He said this with grotesque emphasis, standing with his legs wide apart,  his hat perched on the back of his head, his plump hands dramatically  outstretched: and Mainward laughed outright.    \"Sixteen thousand?\" he asked.    \"Or twenty,\" said the other impressively. \"I want to show you----\"  Somebody called him, and with a hurried apology he went blundering up  the green slope, stopping and turning back to indulge in a little dumb  show illustrative of his confidence in Mainward and his willingness to  oblige.    Mainward was laughing, a low, gurgling laugh of pure enjoyment. Venn, of  all people! Venn, with his accursed questions and talk of securities.  Well! Well!    Then his merriment ceases, and he winced again, and his heart beat  faster and faster, and a curious weakness came over him----    How splendidly cool she looked.    She walked in the clearing, a white, slim figure; he heard the swish of  her skirt as she came through the long grass--white, with a green belt  all encrusted with gold embroidery. He took in every detail  hungrily--the dangling gold ornaments that hung from her belt, the lace  collar at her throat, the----    She did not hurry to him, that was not her way.    But in her eyes dawned a gradual tenderness--those dear eyes that  dropped before his shyly.    \"Ethel!\" he whispered, and dared to take her hand.    \"Aren't you wonderfully surprised?\" she said.    \"Ethel! Here!\"    \"I--I had to come.\"    She would not look at him, but he saw the pink in her cheek and heard  the faltering voice with a wild hope. \"I behaved so badly, dear--so very  badly.\"    She hung her head.    \"Dear! dear!\" he muttered, and groped toward her like a blind man.    She was in his arms, crushed against his breast, the perfume of her  presence in his brain.    \"I had to come to you.\" Her hot cheek was against his. \"I love you so.\"    \"Me--love me? Do you mean it?\" He was tremulous with happiness, and his  voice broke--\"Dearest.\"    Her face was upturned to his, her lips so near; he felt her heart  beating as furiously as his own. He kissed her--her lips, her eyes, her  dear hair----    \"O, God, I'm happy!\" she sobbed, \"so--so happy----\"           *     *     *     *     *    Sanders sprang ashore just as the sun was rising, and came thoughtfully  through the undergrowth to the camp. Abiboo, squatting by the curtained  bed, did not rise. Sanders walked to the bed, pulled aside the mosquito  netting, and bent over the man who lay there.    Then he drew the curtains again, lit his pipe slowly, and looked down at  Abiboo.    \"When did he die?\" he asked.    \"In the dark of the morning, master,\" said the man.    Sanders nodded slowly. \"Why did you not send for me?\"    For a moment the squatting figure made no reply, then he rose and  stretched himself.    \"Master,\" he said, speaking in Arabic--which is a language which allows  of nice distinctions--\"this man was happy; he walked in the Forest of  Happy Thoughts; why should I call him back to a land where there was  neither sunshine nor happiness, but only night and pain and sickness?\"    \"You're a philosopher,\" said Sanders irritably.    \"I am a follower of the Prophet,\" said Abiboo, the Kano boy; \"and all  things are according to God's wisdom.\"            CHAPTER VIII.      THE AKASAVAS.      You who do not understand how out of good evil may arise must take your  spade to some virgin grassland, untouched by the hand of man from the  beginning of time. Here is soft, sweet grass, and never a sign of  nettle, or rank, evil weed. It is as God made it. Turn the soil with  your spade, intent on improving His handiwork, and next season--weeds,  nettles, lank creeping things, and coarse-leafed vegetation cover the  ground.    Your spade has aroused to life the dormant seeds of evil, germinated the  ugly waste life that all these long years has been sleeping out of  sight--in twenty years, with careful cultivation, you may fight down the  weeds and restore the grassland, but it takes a lot of doing.    Your intentions may have been the best in disturbing the primal sod; you  may have had views of roses flourishing where grass was; the result is  very much the same.    I apply this parable to the story of a missionary and his work. The  missionary was a good man, though of the wrong colour. He had large  ideas on his duty to his fellows; he was inspired by the work of his  cloth in another country; but, as Sanders properly said, India is not  Africa.    Kenneth McDolan came to Mr. Commissioner Sanders with a letter of  introduction from the new Administration.    Sanders was at \"chop\" one blazing morning when his servant, who was also  his sergeant, Abiboo, brought a card to him. It was a nice card, rounded  at the corners, and gilt-edged, and in the centre, in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35554"],[0,"A Voice of Warning (#17)"],[1,"pertaining  to the Nephites. This record lay concealed, or sealed up, from A. D.  420 to September 22, 1827, at which time it was found by Mr. Joseph  Smith, jun., he being directed thither by an angel of the Lord.    The following account of the discovery and translation of this record  is extracted from a tract by Elder Orson Pratt, published at  Edinburgh, in 1840, entitled, \"Remarkable Visions,\" etc., to which our  readers are referred for further particulars:--    \"'How far below the surface these records were placed by Moroni, I am  unable to say; but from the fact that they had been some fourteen  hundred years buried, and that, too, on the side of a hill so steep,  one is ready to conclude that they were some feet below, as the earth  would naturally wear, more or less, in that length of time; but they  being placed toward the top of the hill, the ground would not remove  as much as at two-thirds, perhaps. Another circumstance would prevent  a wearing of the earth; in all probability, as soon as timber had time  to grow, the hill was covered, after the Nephites were destroyed, and  the roots of the same would hold the surface: however, on this point,  I shall leave every man to draw his own conclusion, and form his own  speculation.' But suffice it to say, 'a hole of sufficient depth was  dug; at the bottom of this was laid a stone of suitable size, the  upper surface being smooth; at each edge was placed a large quantity  of cement, and into this cement, at the four edges of this stone, were  placed erect four others; their bottom edges resting in the cement, at  the outer edges of the first stone. The four last named, when placed  erect, formed a box; the corners, or where the edges of the four came  in contact, were also cemented so firmly, that the moisture from  without was prevented from entering. It is to be observed, also, that  the inner surface of the four erect or side stones was smooth. This  box was sufficiently large to admit a breastplate, such as was used by  the ancients to defend the chest, etc., from the arrows and weapons of  their enemy. From the bottom of the box, or from the breastplate,  arose three small pillars, composed of the same description of cement  used on the edges; and upon these three pillars was placed the record.  * * * This box containing the record was covered with another stone,  the bottom surface being flat, and the upper crowning.' When it was  first visited by Mr. Smith, on the morning of the twenty-second of  September, 1823, 'a part of the crowning stone was visible above the  surface, while the edges were concealed by the soil and grass. From  which circumstance, it may be seen, that however deep this box might  have been placed by Moroni at first, the time had been sufficient to  wear the earth, so that it was easily discovered, when once directed,  and yet not enough to make a perceivable difference to the passer by.  * * * After arriving at the repository, a little exertion in removing  the soil from the edges of the top of the box, and a light pry,  brought to his natural vision its contents.'    \"While viewing and contemplating this sacred treasure with wonder and  astonishment, behold! the angel of the Lord, who had previously  visited him, again stood in his presence, and his soul was again  enlightened as it was the evening before, and he was filled with the  Holy Spirit, and the heavens were opened, and the glory of the Lord  shone round about and rested upon him. 'While he thus stood, gazing  and admiring, the angel said, Look!' And as he thus spake, he beheld  the Prince of Darkness, surrounded by his innumerable train of  associates. All this passed before him, and the heavenly messenger  said: 'All this is shown, the good and the evil, the holy and impure,  the glory of God, and the power of darkness, that you may know  hereafter, the two powers, and never be influenced or overcome by that  wicked one. Behold, whatever entices and leads to good, and to do  good, is of God, and whatever does not, is of that wicked one. It is  he that fills the hearts of men with evil to walk in darkness, and  blaspheme God; and you may learn from henceforth, that his ways are to  destruction; but the way of holiness is peace and rest. You now see  why you could not obtain this record, that the commandment was strict,  and that if ever these sacred things are obtained, they must be by  prayer and faithfulness in obeying the Lord. They are not deposited  here for the sake of accumulating gain and wealth, for the glory of  this world; they were sealed by the prayer of faith, and because of  the knowledge which they contain, they are of no worth among the  children of men, only for their knowledge. On them is contained the  fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it was given to His people  on this land; and when it shall be brought forth by the power of God,  it shall be carried to the Gentiles, of whom many will receive it, and  after, will the seed of Israel be brought into the fold of their  Redeemer by obeying it also. Those who kept the commandments of the  Lord on this land, desired this at His hand, and through the prayer of  faith obtained the promise, that if their descendants should  transgress and fall away, a record might be kept, and in the last  days, come to their children. These things are sacred, and must be  kept so, for the promise of the Lord concerning them must be  fulfilled. No man can obtain them if his heart is impure, because they  contain that which is sacred. * * * By them will the Lord work a great  and marvelous work; the wisdom of the wise shall become as naught, and  the understanding of the prudent shall be hid, and because the power  of God shall be displayed, those who profess to know the truth, but  walk in deceit, shall tremble with anger; but with signs and with  wonders, with gifts and with healings, with the manifestations of the  power of God, and with the Holy Ghost, shall the hearts of the  faithful be comforted. You have now beheld the power of God  manifested, and the power of Satan; you see that there is nothing that  is desirable in the works of darkness; that they cannot bring  happiness; that those who are overcome therewith are miserable; while,  on the other hand, the righteous are blessed with a place in the  kingdom of God, where joy unspeakable surrounds them; there they rest  beyond the power of the enemy of truth, where no evil can disturb  them: the glory of God crowns them, and they continually feast upon  His goodness, and enjoy His smiles. Behold, notwithstanding you have  seen this great display of power, by which you may ever be able to  detect the evil one, yet I give unto you another sign, and when it  comes to pass, then know that the Lord is God, and that He will fulfil  His purposes, and that the knowledge which this record contains, will  go to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people under the  whole heaven. This is the sign: when these things begin to be known,  that is, when it is known that the Lord has shown you these things,  the workers of iniquity will seek your overthrow; they will circulate  falsehoods to destroy your reputation; and also will seek to take your  life! but remember this, if you are faithful, and shall hereafter  continue to keep the commandments of the Lord, you shall be preserved  to bring these things forth; for in due time He will again give you a  commandment to come and take them. When they are interpreted, the Lord  will give the Holy Priesthood to some, and they shall begin to  proclaim this Gospel and baptize by water, and after that, they shall  have power to give the Holy Ghost by the laying on of their hands.  Then will persecution rage more and more; for the iniquities of men  shall be revealed, and those who are not built upon the Rock will seek  to overthrow this Church; but it will increase the more opposed, and  spread farther and farther, increasing in knowledge, till they shall  be sanctified, and receive an inheritance where the glory of God will  rest upon them; and when this takes place, and all things are  prepared, the ten tribes of Israel will be revealed in the north  country, whither they have been for a long season; and when this is  fulfilled, will be brought to pass that saying of the Prophet, 'And  the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from  transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord.' But, notwithstanding the  workers of iniquity shall seek your destruction, the arm of the Lord  will be extended, and you will be borne off conqueror, if you keep all  His commandments. Your name shall be known among the nations, for the  work which the Lord will perform by your hands shall cause the  righteous to rejoice and the wicked to rage; with the one it shall be  had in honor, and with the other in reproach; yet, with these it shall  be a terror, because of the great and marvelous work which shall  follow the coming forth of this fulness of the Gospel. Now, go thy  way, remembering what the Lord has done for thee, and be diligent in  keeping His commandments, and He will deliver thee from temptations,  and all the arts and devices of the wicked one. Forget not to pray,  that thy mind may become strong, that when he shall manifest unto  thee, thou mayest have power to escape the evil, and obtain these  precious things.\"    We here remark, that the above quotation is an extract from a letter  written by Elder Oliver Cowdery, which was published in one of the  numbers of the \"Latter-day Saints' Messenger and Advocate.\"    Although many more instructions were given by the mouth of the angel  to Mr. Smith, which we do not write in this book, yet the most  important items are contained in the foregoing relation. During the  period of the four following years, he frequently received instruction  from the mouth of the heavenly messenger, and on the morning of the  twenty-second of September, A.
