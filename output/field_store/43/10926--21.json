While the       boat is crossing the spacious river the passengers are       supplied with their breakfasts, dinner, or supper, as       the case may be. On arriving at the opposite bank the       upper deck comes in contact with a like platform,       bearing a railway upon which the luggage wagons are       rolled; the passengers ascend, as they descended, under       a covered way, and, resuming their places in the       railway carriages, the train proceeds.         But the prudent Americans have availed themselves of       other sources of economy by adopting a mode of       construction adapted to the expected traffic. Formed to       carry a limited commerce the railways are generally       single lines, sidings being provided at convenient       situations. Collision is impossible, for the first       train that arrives at a siding must enter it and remain       there until the following train arrives. This       arrangement would be attended with inconvenience with a       crowded traffic like that of many lines on the English       railways, but even on the principal American lines the       trains seldom pass in each direction more than twice a       day, and their time and place of meeting is perfectly       regulated. In the structure of the roads, also,       principles have been adopted which have been attended       with great economy compared with the English lines. The       engineers, for example, do not impose on themselves the       difficult and expensive condition of excluding all       curves but those of large radius, and all gradients       exceeding a certain small limit of steepness. Curves of       500 feet radius, and even less, are frequent, and       acclivities rising at the rate of 1 foot in 100 are       considered a moderate ascent, while there are not less       than 50 lines laid down with gradients varying from 1       in 100 to 1 in 75, nevertheless these lines are worked       with facility by locomotives, without the expedient,       even, of assistant or stationary engines. The       consequences of this have been to reduce in an immense       proportion the cost of earthwork, bridges, and       viaducts, even in parts of the country where the       character of the surface is least favorable. But the       chief source of economy has arisen from the structure       of the line itself. In many cases where the traffic is       lightest the rails consist of flat bars of iron, 2-1/2       inches broad and 6-10ths of an inch thick, nailed and       spiked to planks of timber laid longitudinally on the       road in parallel lines, so as to form what are called       continuous bearings. Some of the most profitable       American railways, and those of which the maintenance       has proved least expensive, have been constructed in       this manner. The road structure, however, varies       according to the traffic. Rails are sometimes laid       weighing only from 25lb. to 30lb. per yard. In some       cases of great traffic they are supported on transverse       sleepers of wood like the European railways, but in       consequence of the comparative cheapness of wood and       the high price of iron, the strength necessary for the       road is mostly obtained by reducing the distance       between the sleepers so as to supersede the necessity       of giving greater weight to the rails.         The same observance of the principles of economy is       maintained with regard to their locomotive stock. The       engines are strongly built, safe and powerful, but are       destitute of much of that elegance of exterior and       beauty of workmanship which has excited so much       admiration, in the machines exhibited in the Crystal       Palace. The fuel is generally wood, but on certain       lines near the coal districts coal is used. The use of       coke is nowhere resorted to. Its expense would make it       inadmissible, and in a country so thinly inhabited the       smoke proceeding from coal is not objected to. The       ordinary speed, stoppages included, is from 14 to 16       miles an hour. Independently of other considerations,       the light structure of many of the roads would not       allow a greater velocity without danger; nevertheless       we have frequently travelled on some of the better       constructed lines at the ordinary speed of the English       railways, say 30 miles an hour and upwards.         Notwithstanding the apparently feeble and unsubstantial       structure of many of the lines, accidents to passenger       trains are scarcely ever heard of. It appears by       returns now before us that of 9,355,474 passengers       booked in 1850 on the crowded railways of       Massachusetts, each passenger making an average trip of       18 miles, there were only 15 who sustained accidents       fatal to life or limb. It follows from this, by the       common principles explained by us in a former article,       that when a passenger travels one mile on these       railways the chances against an accident producing       personal injury, even of the slightest kind, are       11,226,568 to 1, and of course in a journey of 100       miles the chances against such accident are 112,266 to       1. We have shown in a former article that the chances       against accident on an English railway, under like       circumstances, are 85,125 to 1. The American railways       are, therefore, safer than the English in the ratio of       112 to 85.         The great line of communication is established, 400       miles in length, between Philadelphia and Pittsburg, on       the left bank of the Ohio, composed partly of railway       and partly of canal. The section from Philadelphia to       Columbia (82 miles) is railway; the line is then       continued by canal for 172 miles to Holidaysburg; it is       then carried by railway 37 miles to Johnstown, whence       it is continued 104 miles further to Pittsburg by       canal. The traffic on this mixed line of transport is       conducted so as to avoid the expense and inconvenience       of transhipment of goods and passengers at the       successive points where the railway and canals unite.       The merchandise is loaded and the passengers       accommodated in the boats adapted to the canals at the       depot in Market-street, Philadelphia. These boats,       which are of considerable magnitude and length, are       divided into segments by partitions made transversely       and at right angles to their length, so that such boat       can be, as it were, broken into three or more pieces.       These several pieces are placed each on two railway       trucks, which support it at the ends, a proper body       being provided for the trucks adapted to the form of       the bottom and keel of the boat. In this manner the       boat is carried in pieces, with its load, along the       railway. On arriving at the canal the pieces are united       so as to form a continuous boat, which being launched,       the transport is continued on the water. On arriving       again at the railway the boat is once more resolved       into its segments, which, as before, are transferred to       the railway trucks and transported to the next canal       station by locomotive engines. Between the depot in       Market-street and the locomotive station which is       situated in the suburbs of Philadelphia the segments of       the boat are drawn by horses on railways conducted       through the streets. At the locomotive station the       trucks are formed into a continuous train and delivered       over to the locomotive engine. As the body of the truck       rests upon a pivot, under which it is supported by       wheels, it is capable of revolving, and no difficulty       is found in turning the shortest curves, and these       enormous vehicles, with their contents of merchandise       and passengers, are seen daily issuing from the gates       of the depot in Market-street, and turning with       facility the corners at the entrance of each successive       street.         By a comparison of the returns published by Dr.       Lardner, in his work already quoted, with the more       recent results which we have already given, it will       appear that within the last two years not less than       3,700 miles of railway have been opened for traffic in       the United States. Among these are included several of       the most important lines, among which are more       especially to be noticed the great artery of railway       communication extending across the State of New York to       the shores of Lake Erie, the longest line which any       single company has yet constructed in the United       States, its length being 467 miles. The total cost of       this line, including the working stock, has been       4,500,000_l._ sterling, being at the average rate of       9,642_l._ per mile--a rate of expense about 50 per       cent. above the average cost of American railways taken       collectively. This is explained by the fact that the       line itself is one constructed for a large traffic       between New York and the interior, and therefore built       to meet a heavy traffic. Although it is but just       opened, its average receipts have amounted to       11,000_l._ per week, which have given a net profit of       6-1/2 per cent. on the capital, the working expenses       being taken at 50 per cent. of the gross receipts. One       of the great lines in a forward state, and likely to be       opened by the close of the present year, connects New       York with Albany, following the valley of the Hudson.       It will no doubt create surprise, considering the       immense facility of water transport afforded by this       river, that a railway should be constructed on its       bank, but it must be remembered that for a considerable       interval "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37937"],[0,"A Wanderer in Paris (#17)"],[1,"picture, at which the French have for many years been extremely apt,  one must of course go to Versailles, where the history of France is  spread lavishly over many square miles of canvas.    From this room--La Salle des Sept Cheminees--we pass through a little  vestibule, with Courbet's great village funeral in it, to the very  pleasant Salle La Caze, containing the greater part of the collection  of the late Dr. La Caze, and notable chiefly for the Chardins of which  I have already spoken, and also, by the further door, for a haunting  \"Buste de femme\" attributed to the Milanese School. But there are  other admirable pictures here, including a Velasquez, and it repays  study.    Leaving by the further door and walking for some distance, we come to  the His de la Salle collection of drawings, from which we gain the  Collection Thiers, which should perhaps be referred to here, although  there is not the slightest necessity to see it at all. The Thiers  collection, which occupies two rooms, is remarkable chiefly for its  water-colour copies of great paintings. The first President of the  Republic employed patient artists to make copies suitable for hanging  upon his walls of such inaccessible works as the \"Last Judgment\" of  Michael Angelo and Raphael's Dresden Madonna. The results are  certainly extraordinary, even if they are not precisely la guerre. The  Arundel Society perhaps found its inspiration in this collection.  Among the originals there is a fine Terburg.    On leaving the Thiers collection, one comes to a narrow passage with a  little huddle of water-colours, very badly treated as to light and  space, and well worth more consideration. These pictures should not be  missed, for among them are two Boningtons, a windmill in a sombre  landscape, which I reproduce opposite page 274, and next to it a  masterly drawing of the statue of Bartolomme Colleoni at Venice, which  Ruskin called the finest equestrian group in the world. Bonington, who  had the special gift of painting great pictures in small compass (just  as there are men who can use a whole wall to paint a little picture  on), has made a drawing in which the original sculptor would have  rejoiced. It would do the Louvre authorities good if these Boningtons,  which they treat so carelessly, were stolen. Nothing could be easier;  I worked out the felony as I stood there. All that one would need  would be a few friends equally concerned to teach the Louvre a lesson,  behind whose broad backs one could ply the diamond and the knife. Were  I a company promoter this is how I should spend my leisure hours. Such  theft is very nigh virtue.    Among other pictures in these bad little rooms--Nos. XVII. and  XVIII.--are some Millets and Decamps.    Three more collections--and these really more interesting than  anything we saw in Galeries XIV. or XVI., or the Salle des Sept  Cheminees--await us; but two of them need considerable powers of  perambulation. Chronology having got us under his thumb we must make  the longer journey first--to the Collection Moreau. The Collection  Moreau is to be found at the top of the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, the  entrance to which is in the Rue de Rivoli. In the lower part of this  building are held periodical exhibitions; but the upper parts are  likely at any rate for a long time to remain unchanged, and here are  wonderful collections of furniture, and here hang the few but select  canvases brought together by Adolphe Moreau and his son, and presented  to the nation by M. Etienne Moreau-Nelaton.    In the Thomy-Thierret collection in another top storey of the same  inexhaustible palace (to which our fainting feet are bound) are Corots  of the late period; M. Moreau bought the earlier. Here, among nearly  forty others, you may see that portrait of Corot painted in 1825, just  before he left for Rome, which his parents exacted from him in return  for their consent to his new career and the abandonment of their rosy  dreams of his success as a draper. Here you may see \"Un Moine,\" one of  the first pictures he was able to sell--for five hundred francs  (twenty pounds). Here is the charming marine \"La Rochelle\" painted in  1851 and given by Corot to Desbarolles and by Desbarolles to the  younger Dumas. Here is the very beautiful Pont de Mantes, reproduced  opposite page 252, belonging to his later manner, and here also is an  exceptionally merry little sketch, \"Bateau de peche a maree basse\". I  mention these only, since selection is necessary; but everything that  Corot painted becomes in time satisfying to the student and  indispensable to its owner. Among the pencil drawings we find this  exquisite lover of nature once more, with fifteen studies of his  Mistress.    One of the most interesting of the Moreau pictures is Fantin-Latour's  \"Hommage a Delacroix,\" with its figures of certain of the great and  more daring writers and painters of the day, 1864, the year after  Delacroix's death. They are grouped about his framed portrait--Manet,  red haired and red bearded, a little like Mr. Meredith in feature;  Whistler, with his white feather black and vigorous, and his hand on  the historical cane; Legros (the only member of the group who is still  living, and long may he live!) and Baudelaire, for all the world like  an innocent professor. Manet himself is represented here by his famous  \"Dejeuner sur l'herbe,\" which the scandalised Salon of 1863 refused to  hang, and three smaller canvases. Among the remaining pictures which  gave me most pleasure are Couture's portrait of Adolphe Moreau the  younger; Daumier's \"La Republique\"; Carriere's \"L'enfant a la  soupiere\" (notice the white bowl); Decamps' \"La Battue,\" curiously  like a Koninck; and Troyon's \"Le Passage du Gue,\" so rich and sweet.    From the Collection Moreau, with its early Barbizon pictures, one  ought to pass to the Chauchard with its middle period, and then to the  Collection Thomy-Thierret; but let us go to the Thomy-Thierret now. It  needs courage and endurance, for the room which contains these  exquisite pictures is only to be reached on foot after climbing many  stairs and walking for what seem to be many miles among models of  ships and other neglected curiosities on the Louvre's topmost floor.  But once the room is reached one is perfectly happy, for every picture  is a gem and there is no one there. M. Thomy-Thierret, who died quite  recently, was a collector who liked pictures to be small, to be rich  in colour, and to be painted by the Barbizon and Romantic Schools.  Here you may see twelve Corots, all of a much later period than those  bequeathed by M. Moreau, among them such masterpieces as \"Le Vallon\"  (No. 2801), reproduced opposite the next page, \"Le Chemin de Sevres\"  (No. 2803), \"Entree de Village\" (No. 2808), \"Les Chaumieres\" (No.  2809), and \"La Route d'Arras\" (No. 2810). Here are thirteen Daubignys,  including \"Les Graves de Villerville\" (No. 28,177), and one sombre and  haunting English scene--\"La Tamise a Erith\" (No. 2821). Here are ten  Diazes, most beautiful of which to my eyes is \"L'Eploree\" (No. 2863).  Here are ten Rousseaus, among them \"Le Printemps\" (No. 2903), with  its rapturous freshness, which I reproduce opposite page 120, and \"Les  Chenes\" (No. 2900), such a group of trees as Rousseau alone could  paint. Here are six Millets, my favourite being the \"Precaution  Maternelle\" (No. 2894), with its lovely blues, which again reappear in  \"Le Vanneur\" (No. 2893). Here are eleven Troyons, of which \"La  Provende des poules\" (No. 2907), with its bustle of turkeys and  chickens around the gay peasant girl beneath a burning sky, reproduced  opposite page 266, is one of the first pictures to which my feet carry  me on my visits to Paris. Here are twelve Dupres, most memorable of  which is \"Les Landes\" (No. 2871). And here also are Delacroix',  Isabeys and Meissoniers.    The Chauchard pictures--140 in number--which are now hanging in five  rooms leading from the Salle Rubens, were bequeathed to the nation by  M. Alfred Chauchard, proprietor of the Magasins du Louvre (which some  visitors to Paris have considered the only Louvre). Among the pictures  are twenty-six by Corot, twenty-six by Meissonier, eight by Millet  (including \"L'Angelus\") and eight by Daubigny.      [Illustration: LE VALLON      COROT      _(Louvre: Thomy-Thierret Collection)_]    I may say at once that the Chauchard Collection does not compare with  the Thomy-Thierret in courage. M. Thomy-Thierret liked his pictures to  be small and exquisite and happy. Within the limits imposed the  Barbizon painters never did anything more delightful or indeed better.  The whole collection--and it is beyond price--is homogeneous: it  embodies the taste of one man. M. Moreau and his son had a robuster  taste, a bolder eye. They wanted strength as well as sweetness, or  strength alone. Their collection has not quite the homogeneity of the  Thomy-Thierret, but one feels here also that personality has honestly  been at work bringing together things of beauty and power that pleased  it, and nothing else. But M. Chauchard....    It is perfectly evident in a moment that M. Chauchard had neither  knowledge nor taste. He merely had acumen. At a certain moment in his  successful life, one feels, M. Chauchard extended himself before the  fire-place, stroked his spreading _favoris_ (so like those of our own  Whiteley), and announced \"I must have some pictures\". Other prosperous  men saying the same thing have forthwith taken their courage in their  hands and bought pictures; but M. Chauchard as I see him (both in his  dazzling marble bust and in the portrait by Benjamin Constant), was  not like that. \"I must have some pictures,\" he announced, and then  quickly reverted to type and cast about as to the best means of  discovering whose pictures were most worth buying. That is how the  Chauchard Collection came about, if I am not mistaken: it was the  venture of an essentially commercial man--an"]]]
