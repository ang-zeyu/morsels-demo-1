It has often been said that the view which makes the element of  form for the eye alone, in the strictest sense, is erroneous,  because there is no form for the eye alone.  The very process  of apprehending a line involves not only motor memories and  impulses, but numberless ideal associations, and these  associations constitute the line as truly as do the others.  The  impression of the line involves expression, a meaning which we  cannot escape.  The forms of things constitute a kind of dialect  of life,--and thus it is that the theory of Einfuhlung in its  deepest sense is grounded.  The Doric column causes in us, no  doubt, motor impulses, but it means, and must mean, to us, the  expression of internal energy through those very impulses it  causes.  \"We ourselves are contracting our muscles, but we  feel as if the lines were pulling and piercing, bending and  lifting, pressing down and pushing up; in short, as soon as the  visual impression is really isolated, and all other ideas really  excluded, then the motor impulses do not awake actions which are  taken as actions of ourselves, but feelings of energy which are  taken as energies of the visual forms and lines.\"<1>  So the  idea belonging to the object, and the psychophysical effect of  the object are only obverse and inverse of the same phenomenon.  And our pleasure in the form of the column is rather our  appreciation of energy than our feeling of favorable stimulation.  Admitting this reasoning, the meaning of a picture would be the  same as its beauty, it is said.  The heroic art of J.-F. Millet,  for example, would be beautiful because it is the perfect  expression of the simplicity and suffering of labor.    <1> H. Munsterberg, _The Principles of Art Education_, p. 87.    Let us examine this apparently reasonable theory.  It is true  that every visual element is understood as expression too.  It  is not true, however, that expression and impression are parallel  and mutually corresponding beyond the elements.  Suppose a  concourse of columns covered by a roof,--the Parthenon.  Those  psychophysical changes induced by the sight now mutually check  and modify each other.  Can we say that there is a \"meaning,\"  like the energy of the column, corresponding to that complex?  It is at least not energy itself.  Ask the same as regards the  lines and masses of a picture by Corot.  In the sense in which  we have taken \"meaning,\" the only psychologically possible one,  our reactions could be interpreted only by some mood.  If the  column means energy because it makes us tower, then the picture  must mean what it makes us do.  That is, a combination of  feathery fronds and horizontal lines of water, bathed in a gray-  green silvery mist, can \"mean\" only a repose lightened by a  grave yet cheerful spirit.  In short, this theory of  expressiveness cannot go beyond the mood or moral quality.  In  the sense of INFORMATION, the theory of Einfuhlung contributes  nothing.  Now, in this limited sense, we have indeed no reason  to contradict it, but simply to point out that it holds only  in this extremely limited sense.  When we see broad sweeping  lines we interpret them by sympathetic reproduction as strength,  energy.  When those sweeping lines are made part of a Titan's  frame, we get the same effect plus the associations which belong  to distinctively muscular energy.  Those same lines might define  the sweep of a drapery, or the curve of an infant's limbs.  Now  all that part of the meaning which belongs to the lines  themselves remains constant under whatever circumstances; and  it is quite true that a certain feeling-tone, a certain moral  quality, as it were, belongs, say, to Raphael's pictures, in  which this kind of outline is to be found.  But as belonging to  a Titan, the additional elements of understanding are not due  to sympathetic reproduction.  They are not parallel with the  motor suggestions; they are simply an associational addition,  due to our information about the power of men with muscles  like that.  That there are secondary motor elements as a  reverberation of these ideal elements need not be denied.  But  they are not directly due to the form.  Now such part of our  response to a picture as is directly induced by the form, we  have a right to include in the aesthetic experience.  It will,  however, in every work of art of even the least complexity,  be expressible only as a mood, very indefinite, often  indescribable.  To make this \"meaning,\" then, the essential  aim of a picture seems unreasonable.    It is evident that in experience we do not, as a matter of  fact, separate the mood which is due to sympathy from the  ideal content of the picture.  Corot paint a summer dawn.  We cannot separate our pleasure in the sight from our pleasure  in the understanding; yet it is the visual complex that gives  us the mood, and the meaning of the scene is due to factors  of association.  The \"serene and happy dream,\" the \"conviction  of a solemn and radiant Arcadia,\" are not \"expression\" in that  inevitable sense in which we agreed to take it, but the result  of a most extended upbuilding of ideal (that is, associational)  elements.    The \"idea,\" then, as we have propounded it, is not, as was  thought possible, an integral and essential part, but an  addition to the visual form, and we have still to ask what is  its value.  But in so far as it is an addition, its effect  may be in conflict with what we may call the feeling-tone  produced by sympathetic reproduction.  In that case, one must  yield to the other.  Now it is not probably that even the most  convinced adherents of the expression theory would hold that  if expression or beauty MUST go, expression should be kept.  They only say that expression IS beauty.  But the moment it is  admitted that there is a beauty of form independent of the  ideal element, this theory can no longer stand.  If there is  a conflict, the palm must be given to the direct, rather than  the indirect, factor. Indeed, when there is such a conflict,  the primacy must always be with the medium suited to the organ,  the sensuous factor.  For if it were not so, and expression  WERE beauty, then that would have to be most beautiful which  was most expressive.  And even if we disregard the extraordinary  conclusions to which this would lead,--the story pictures  preferred to those without a story, the photographic reproductions  preferred to the symphonies of color and form,--we should be  obliged to admit something still more incendiary.  Expression  is always of an ideal content, is of something to express; and  it is unquestioned that in words, and in words alone, can we  get nearest to the inexpressible.  Then literature, as being  the most expressive, would be the highest art, and we should be  confronted with a hierarchy of arts, from that down.    Now, in truth, the real lover of beauty knows that no one art  is superior to another.  \"Each in his separate star,\" they reign  alone.  In order to be equal, they must depend on their material,  not on that common quality of imaginative thought which each has  in a differing degree, and all less than literature.    The idea, we conclude, is then indeed subordinate,--a by-product,  unless by chance it can enter into, melt into, the form.  This  case we have clearest in the example, already referred to, of  the gold-embroidered gauntlet, or the jeweled chalice,--say the  Holy Grail in Abbey's pictures,--which counts more or less, in  the spatial balance, according to its intrinsic interest.    We have seen that through sympathetic reproduction a certain  mood is produced, which becomes a kind of emotional envelope  for the picture,--a favorable stimulation of the whole, a  raising of the whole harmony one tone, as it were.  Now the  further ideal content of the picture may so closely belong to  this basis that it helps it along.  Thus all that we know about  dawn--not only of a summer morning--helps us to see, and seeing  to rejoice, in Corot's silvery mist or Monet's iridescent  shimmers.  All that we know and feel about the patient majesty  of labor in the fields, next the earth, helps us to get the  slow, large rhythm, the rich gloom of Millet's pictures.  But  it is the rhythm and the gloom that are the beauty, and the  idea reinforces our consciousness thereof.  The idea is a  sounding-board for the beauty, and so can be truly said to  enter into the form.    But there are still some lions in the path of our theory.  The  greatest of modern sculptors is reputed to have reached his  present altitude by the passionate pursuance of Nature, and of  the expressions of Nature.  And few can see Rodin's work  without being at once in the grip of the emotion or fact he  has chosen to depict.  A great deal of contemporary criticism  on modern tendencies in art rests on the intention of  expression, and expression alone, attributed to him.  It is  said of him:  \"The solicitude for ardent expression overmasters  every aesthetic consideration....  He is a poet with stone as  his instrument of expression.  He makes it express emotions  that are never found save in music or in psychological and  lyric literature.\"<1>    <1> C. Mauclair, \"The Decorative Sculpture of August Rodin,\"  _International Monthly_, vol iii.    Now while the last is undoubtedly true, I believe that the  first is not only not true, but that it is proved to be so by  Rodin's own procedure and utterances, and that, if we understand  his case aright, it is for beauty alone that he lives.  He has  related his search for the secret of Michael Angelo's design,  and how he found it in the rhythm of two planes rather than four,  the Greek composition.  This system of tormented form is one way  of referring the body to the geometry of an imagined rectangular  block inclosing the whole.    <1>\"The ordinary Greek composition of the body, he puts it,  depends on a rhythm of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3754"],[0,"The Wonders of Instinct: Chapters in the Psychology of Insects (#17)"],[1,"herself, chillily, against the sunny walls. In April, I notice  her in considerable numbers on the laurustinus. It is here that she  seems to pair, while sipping the sugary exudations of the small white  flowers. The whole of the summer season is spent out of doors, in brief  flights from one refreshment-bar to the next. When autumn comes, with  its game, she makes her way into our houses and remains until the hard  frosts.    This suits my stay-at-home habits and especially my legs, which are  bending under the weight of years. I need not run after the subjects of  my present study; they call on me. Besides, I have vigilant assistants.  The household knows of my plans. One and all bring me, in a little  screw of paper, the noisy visitor just captured against the panes.    Thus do I fill my vivarium, which consists of a large, bell-shaped cage  of wire-gauze, standing in an earthenware pan full of sand. A mug  containing honey is the dining-room of the establishment. Here the  captives come to recruit themselves in their hours of leisure. To  occupy their maternal cares, I employ small birds--Chaffinches,  Linnets, Sparrows--brought down, in the enclosure, by my son's gun.    I have just served up a Linnet shot two days ago. I next place in the  cage a Bluebottle, one only, to avoid confusion. Her fat belly  proclaims the advent of laying-time. An hour later, when the excitement  of being put in prison is allayed, my captive is in labour. With eager,  jerky steps, she explores the morsel of game, goes from the head to the  tail, returns from the tail to the head, repeats the action several  times and at last settles near an eye, a dimmed eye sunk into its  socket.    The ovipositor bends at a right angle and dives into the junction of  the beak, straight down to the root. Then the eggs are emitted for  nearly half an hour. The layer, utterly absorbed in her serious  business, remains stationary and impassive and is easily observed  through my lens. A movement on my part would doubtless scare her; but  my restful presence gives her no anxiety. I am nothing to her.    The discharge does not go on continuously until the ovaries are  exhausted; it is intermittent and performed in so many packets. Several  times over, the Fly leaves the bird's beak and comes to take a rest  upon the wire-gauze, where she brushes her hind-legs one against the  other. In particular, before using it again, she cleans, smooths and  polishes her laying-tool, the probe that places the eggs. Then, feeling  her womb still teeming, she returns to the same spot at the joint of  the beak. The delivery is resumed, to cease presently and then begin  anew. A couple of hours are thus spent in alternate standing near the  eye and resting on the wire-gauze.    At last it is over. The Fly does not go back to the bird, a proof that  her ovaries are exhausted. The next day she is dead. The eggs are  dabbed in a continuous layer, at the entrance to the throat, at the  root of the tongue, on the membrane of the palate. Their number appears  considerable; the whole inside of the gullet is white with them. I fix  a little wooden prop between the two mandibles of the beak, to keep  them open and enable me to see what happens.    I learn in this way that the hatching takes place in a couple of days.  As soon as they are born, the young vermin, a swarming mass, leave the  place where they are and disappear down the throat.    The beak of the bird invaded was closed at the start, as far as the  natural contact of the mandibles allowed. There remained a narrow slit  at the base, sufficient at most to admit the passage of a horse-hair.  It was through this that the laying was performed. Lengthening her  ovipositor like a telescope, the mother inserted the point of her  implement, a point slightly hardened with a horny armour. The fineness  of the probe equals the fineness of the aperture. But, if the beak were  entirely closed, where would the eggs be laid then?    With a tied thread I keep the two mandibles in absolute contact; and I  place a second Bluebottle in the presence of the Linnet, whom the  colonists have already entered by the beak. This time the laying takes  place on one of the eyes, between the lid and the eyeball. At the  hatching, which again occurs a couple of days later, the grubs make  their way into the fleshy depths of the socket. The eyes and the beak,  therefore, form the two chief entrances into feathered game.    There are others; and these are the wounds. I cover the Linnet's head  with a paper hood which will prevent invasion through the beak and  eyes. I serve it, under the wire-gauze bell, to a third egg-layer. The  bird has been struck by a shot in the breast, but the sore is not  bleeding: no outer stain marks the injured spot. Moreover, I am careful  to arrange the feathers, to smooth them with a hair-pencil, so that the  bird looks quite smart and has every appearance of being untouched.    The Fly is soon there. She inspects the Linnet from end to end; with  her front tarsi she fumbles at the breast and belly. It is a sort of  auscultation by sense of touch. The insect becomes aware of what is  under the feathers by the manner in which these react. If scent lends  its assistance, it can only be very slightly, for the game is not yet  high. The wound is soon found. No drop of blood is near it, for it is  closed by a plug of down rammed into it by the shot. The Fly takes up  her position without separating the feathers or uncovering the wound.  She remains here for two hours without stirring, motionless, with her  abdomen concealed beneath the plumage. My eager curiosity does not  distract her from her business for a moment.    When she has finished, I take her place. There is nothing either on the  skin or at the mouth of the wound. I have to withdraw the downy plug  and dig to some depth before discovering the eggs. The ovipositor has  therefore lengthened its extensible tube and pushed beyond the feather  stopper driven in by the lead. The eggs are in one packet; they number  about three hundred.    When the beak and eyes are rendered inaccessible, when the body,  moreover, has no wounds, the laying still takes place, but this time in  a hesitating and niggardly fashion. I pluck the bird completely, the  better to watch what happens; also, I cover the head with a paper hood  to close the usual means of access. For a long time, with jerky steps,  the mother explores the body in every direction; she takes her stand by  preference on the head, which she sounds by tapping on it with her  front tarsi. She knows that the openings which she needs are there,  under the paper; but she also knows how frail are her grubs, how  powerless to pierce their way through the strange obstacle which stops  her as well and interferes with the work of her ovipositor. The cowl  inspires her with profound distrust. Despite the tempting bait of the  veiled head, not an egg is laid on the wrapper, slight though it may  be.    Weary of vain attempts to compass this obstacle, the Fly at last  decides in favour of other points, but not on the breast, belly, or  back, where the hide would seem too tough and the light too intrusive.  She needs dark hiding-places, corners where the skin is very delicate.  The spots chosen are the cavity of the axilla, corresponding with our  arm-pit, and the crease where the thigh joins the belly. Eggs are laid  in both places, but not many, showing that the groin and the axilla are  adopted only reluctantly and for lack of a better spot.    With an unplucked bird, also hooded, the same experiment failed: the  feathers prevent the Fly from slipping into those deep places. Let us  add, in conclusion, that, on a skinned bird, or simply on a piece of  butcher's meat, the laying is effected on any part whatever, provided  that it be dark. The gloomiest corners are the favourite ones.    It follows from all this that, to lay her eggs, the Bluebottle picks  out either naked wounds or else the mucous membranes of the mouth or  eyes, which are not protected by a skin of any thickness. She also  needs darkness.    The perfect efficiency of the paper bag, which prevents the inroads of  the worms through the eye-sockets or the beak, suggests a similar  experiment with the whole bird. It is a matter of wrapping the body in  a sort of artificial skin which will be as discouraging to the Fly as  the natural skin. Linnets, some with deep wounds, others almost intact,  are placed one by one in paper envelopes similar to those in which the  nursery-gardener keeps his seeds, envelopes just folded, without being  stuck. The paper is quite ordinary and of middling thickness. Torn  pieces of newspaper serve the purpose.    These sheaths with the corpses inside them are freely exposed to the  air, on the table in my study, where they are visited, according to the  time of day, in dense shade and in bright sunlight. Attracted by the  effluvia from the dead meat, the Bluebottles haunt my laboratory, the  windows of which are always open. I see them daily alighting on the  envelopes and very busily exploring them, apprised of the contents by  the gamy smell. Their incessant coming and going is a sign of intense  cupidity; and yet none of them decides to lay on the bags. They do not  even attempt to slide their ovipositor through the slits of the folds.  The favourable season passes and not an egg is laid on the tempting  wrappers. All the mothers abstain, judging the slender obstacle of the  paper to be more than the vermin will be able to overcome.    This caution on the Fly's part does not at all surprise me: motherhood  everywhere has great gleams of perspicacity. What does astonish me is  the following result. The parcels containing the Linnets are left for a  whole year uncovered on the table; they remain there for a second year  and a third. I inspect the contents from time to time. The little birds  are intact, with unrumpled feathers,"]]]
