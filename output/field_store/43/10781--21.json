What were  the crypts for? No one knows for certain. Mr. Thackeray Turner thinks  they were without doubt the undercrofts of merchants' houses; but there  is better reason for supposing that they are remains of some religious  foundation, perhaps of White Friars. At one time there stood in the  centre of the High Street, between the two crypts, the \"Fyshe Crosse,\"  which John Russell, the Guildford historian, tells us carried on its  summit a flying angel carved in stone, and was erected by the White  Friars in 1345. There is no evidence to prove that this was so, though  it may have been; in any case, the \"Fyshe Crosse\" was demolished in 1595  as being abominably in the way of the street traffic. If the White  Friars ever had a convent near the cross, possibly the Angel was  originally their guest-house, afterwards turned into an inn.    The Red Lion was the best inn, according to Pepys. It was at the Red  Lion that he \"lay in the room the King lately lay in,\" which would have  pleased Pepys; and it was with the drawers of the inn, one Saturday  night, that he and Mr. Creed made merry over the minister of the town,  who had a girdle as red as his face, but preached next day a better  sermon than Pepys had looked for. The inn had a garden, out of which on  another occasion the gossiping little Admiralty official cut \"sparagus  for supper--the best that ever I ate but in the house last year.\"  Doubtless the host of the Red Lion liked Pepys's recommendation, but  Pepys and his wife must have occasionally been rather noisy guests. It  was in the same inn garden that he and Mr. Creed \"played the fool a  great while, trying who could go best over the edge of an old fountain  well; and I won a quart of sack of him.\" Afterwards, at supper, \"my wife  and I did talk high, she against and I for Mrs. Pierce (that she was a  beauty) till we were both angry.\" Pepys's journeys to Portsmouth, where  his Admiralty business took him, seem generally to have been broken at  Guildford, which was the first stopping place after leaving \"Fox Hall\"  as he calls Vauxhall. The roads must have been pretty bad, for on one  occasion the coach lost its way for \"three or four miles\" about Cobham.  However, they ended as usual at the Red Lion, and \"dined together, and  pretty merry\" and so back to Fox Hall.    A gentler traveller through Guildford used to drive along the Hog's Back  in the early morning, breakfast at the Lion or the Angel, and reach  Sloane Street at half-past six or so in the evening, when she was glad  to get to bed early. That was when Jane Austen was writing at Chawton.  One of her letters, very typical of her in its regard for the pleasant  little minutiae of a day's business, describes a drive from Chawton up to  London. At Guildford she was \"very lucky in my gloves--got them at the  first shop I went to, though I went into it rather because it was near  than because it looked like a shop, and gave only four shillings for  them; after which everybody at Chawton will be hoping and predicting  that they cannot be good for anything.\" She was then at work on _Emma_,  whom we meet again at Leatherhead.    Guildford High Street has kept its main features for centuries. But the  town has lost one of its chief buildings, which only survives in the  name of Friary Street, and in one or two other names, such as Walnut  Tree Close. This was the old Dominican Friary probably founded by Black  Friars in the first half of the thirteenth century. Not a stone of the  old Friary remains in its place, but the building saw in its time a good  deal of Guildford history. Prince Henry, the eldest son of Edward I and  Eleanor of Castile, died there of an illness which not even the skill of  the friars could abate, though they tried their utmost and sent  messengers riding to London for syrups and candies. The friars had a  good deal to do with royalty, and had many presents from the kings.  Edward I gave them oak trees for fuel and timber; Edward II gave them  eight shillings; Henry IV and his family lodged with them and gave them  forty shillings; Henry VII let them gather fallen wood in his park, but  never gave them a penny; Henry VIII gave them many presents, of which  the largest were two of five pounds, and his daughter, Princess Mary,  gave them seven shillings and sixpence. But the friary fell, of course,  at the Dissolution and after that, apparently, Henry used the building,  which he enlarged, for his own purposes when he came to Guildford to  hunt. Later, probably before the time of James I, the old friary  buildings were demolished and another house built which went with the  Guildford Park estate through several families. One of its owners was  Daniel Colwall, a founder of the Royal Society, who conferred on its  annals the dismal distinction of a suicide. He pistolled himself in an  armchair, and the chair is still shown, black with blood, in the  master's quarters of the Abbot's Hospital. Later still, the house was  used as cavalry barracks, and three years after Waterloo, when perhaps  barracks seemed less necessary than before, the buildings were pulled to  pieces.    Guildford once had nine \"gates\"; eight have disappeared. They are marked  on an old map of the borough, classically described as the \"Ichnography  or ground plan of Guildford.\" Of six \"gates\" or streets south of the  High Street, Ratsgate, Bookersgate, Tunsgate, Saddlersgate, Bakersgate,  and Shipgate, only Tunsgate remains; and on the north side Swangate,  Bull's Head Gate, and Coffeehouse Gate have vanished. The charm of the  chief buildings remains, but here and there modern needs have spoiled  the smaller houses. In the High Street, for instance, Number 25, not  much more than a hundred years ago, must have been a quite perfect  little house, with its large casements and their curious iron  fastenings, its noble staircase, and its delightful doorway. It was once  the private residence of the Martyr family, who were hereditary town  clerks of Guildford, but unfortunately it has now been turned into a  shop. The proprietor very courteously allows visitors to examine the  interior, but much of the fascination of the ground floor, with its  panels under the windows and its delicate iron railing, has vanished  altogether, and can only be recovered in imagination with the help of an  old drawing. This house, by the way, a century ago contained a strange  relic, strangely lost. When Peter de Rupibus, the great Bishop of  Winchester, died at his castle at Farnham, his body was buried in  Winchester Cathedral, but the heart was taken to Waverley Abbey. About  1730 it was accidentally dug up among the Abbey ruins, and brought to  Guildford, where Mr. John Martyr kept it at Number 25, safe in its  original lead case. A hundred years later the heart disappeared. No one  knows how it vanished, or where it lies.    One building has altered very little. That is the old town hall, whose  clock swings out over the road, and has been sketched more often,  perhaps, than any clock in Surrey. The original town hall belongs to the  time of Elizabeth, and was probably built into the present structure,  which dates from 1683. It is in some ways the chief feature of the High  Street, with its heavy balcony, supported by monstrous black oak  brackets, and its cupola and bell-turret. The clock has a separate  history. In the year when the town hall was built, one John Aylward, a  clockmaker, came to Guildford and asked leave to set up in business. He  was a \"foreigner,\" that is, he came from another part of England, and  the Gild-merchant refused permission. Undaunted, he retired and set up  his shop outside the borough, made a great clock, presented it to the  governing body, and so obtained the freedom of the town.          CHAPTER VII    GUILDFORD'S ENVIRONS        The prettiest town Cobbett ever saw.--Semaphores and the THING.--The      Road on the Ridge.--Newlands Corner.--The Father of the      Forest.--Pilgrims to St. Martha's.--A quiet churchyard.--Mr.      Allnutt's poem.--St. Catherine's and the      Hammer.--Worplesdon.--Sutton Place.--The Weston Rebus.--Lady Susan,      the Tame Wild Sow.--The earliest mention of Cricket.      Cobbett's is the most attractive description of Guildford and its  environs. \"The town of Guildford,\" he writes in _Rural Rides_, \"taken  with its environs I, who have seen so many, many towns, think the  prettiest, and, taken all together, the most agreeable and most  happy-looking that I ever saw in my life. Here are hill and dale in  endless variety. Here are the chalk and the sand, vieing with each other  in making beautiful scenes. Here is a navigable river and fine meadows.  Here are woods and downs. Here is something of everything but _fat  marshes_ and their skeleton-making _agues_. The vale all the way down to  Chilworth from Reigate is very delightful.\" He has as many praises for  the neighbourhood on the other side. \"Everybody that has been from  Godalming to Guildford knows that there is hardly another such a pretty  four miles in all England. The road is good; the soil is good; the  houses are neat; the people are neat; the hills, the woods, the meadows,  all are beautiful. Nothing wild or bold, to be sure, but exceedingly  pretty; and it is almost impossible to ride along these four miles  without feelings of pleasure, though you have rain for your companion,  as it happened to be with me.\" Would the scenery have pleased Cobbett  better if it had been \"wild or bold\"? Probably not, since he calls  Hindhead \"the most villainously ugly spot on God's Earth.\" Cobbett liked  smiling pastures and well grown crops. His prettiness is good timber  and clean farming.    In Cobbett's time, there were no suburbs to Guildford; to-day the  suburbs grow.

And since the soul is always in motion and yet has no external source of  motion, for it is self-moved, I conclude that it will also have no end  to its motion, because it is not likely ever to abandon itself. Again,  since the nature of the soul is not composite, nor has in it any  admixture that is not homogeneous and similar, I conclude that it is  indivisible, and, if indivisible, that it cannot perish. It is again  a strong proof of men knowing most things before birth, that when mere  children they grasp innumerable facts with such speed as to show that  they are not then taking them in for the first time, but remembering and  recalling them. This is roughly Plato's argument.    22. Once more in Xenophon we have the elder Cyrus on his deathbed  speaking as follows:--    \"Do not suppose, my dearest sons, that when I have left you I shall be  nowhere and no one. Even when I was with you, you did not see my soul,  but knew that it was in this body of mine from what I did. Believe then  that it is still the same, even though you see it not. The honours paid  to illustrious men had not continued to exist after their death, had  the souls of these very men not done something to make us retain our  recollection of them beyond the ordinary time. For myself, I never could  be persuaded that souls while in mortal bodies were alive, and died  directly they left them; nor, in fact, that the soul only lost all  intelligence when it left the unintelligent body. I believe rather that  when, by being liberated from all corporeal admixture, it has begun to  be pure and undefiled, it is then that it becomes wise. And again,  when man's natural frame is resolved into its elements by death, it is  clearly seen whither each of the other elements departs: for they all go  to the place from which they came: but the soul alone is invisible alike  when present and when departing. Once more, you see that nothing is so  like death as sleep. And yet it is in sleepers that souls most clearly  reveal their divine nature; for they foresee many events when they are  allowed to escape and are left free. This shows what they are likely to  be when they have completely freed themselves from the fetters of the  body. Wherefore, if these things are so, obey me as a god. But if my  soul is to perish with my body, nevertheless do you from awe of the  gods, who guard and govern this fair universe, preserve my memory by the  loyalty and piety of your lives.\"    23. Such are the words of the dying Cyrus. I will now, with your good  leave, look at home. No one, my dear Scipio, shall ever persuade me that  your father Paulus and your two grandfathers Paulus and Africanus, or  the father of Africanus, or his uncle, or many other illustrious men  not necessary to mention, would have attempted such lofty deeds as to be  remaindered by posterity, had they not seen in their minds that future  ages concerned them. Do you suppose--to take an old man's privilege of  a little self-praise--that I should have been likely to undertake  such heavy labours by day and night, at home and abroad, if I had been  destined to have the same limit to my glory as to my life? Had it not  been much better to pass an age of ease and repose without any labour  or exertion? But my soul, I know not how, refusing to be kept down, ever  fixed its eyes upon future ages, as though from a conviction that it  would begin to live only when it had left the body. But had it not been  the case that souls were immortal, it would not have been the souls of  all the best men that made the greatest efforts after an immortality of  fame.    Again, is there not the fact that the wisest man ever dies with the  greatest cheerfulness, the most unwise with the least? Don't you think  that the soul which has the clearer and longer sight sees that it is  starting for better things, while the soul whose vision is dimmer does  not see it? For my part, I am transported with the desire to see your  fathers, who were the object of my reverence and affection. Nor is it  only those whom I knew that I long to see; it is those also of whom I  have been told and have read, whom I have myself recorded in my history.  When I am setting out for that, there is certainly no one who will find  it easy to draw me back, or boil me up again like second Pelios. Nay, if  some god should grant me to renew my childhood from my present age and  once more to be crying in my cradle, I would firmly refuse; nor should  I in truth be willing, after having, as it were, run the full course, to  be recalled from the winning--crease to the barriers. For what blessing  has life to offer? Should we not rather say what labour? But granting  that it has, at any rate it has after all a limit either to enjoyment  or to existence. I don't wish to depreciate life, as many men and good  philosophers have often done; nor do I regret having lived, for I have  done so in a way that lets me think that I was not born in vain. But I  quit life as I would an inn, not as I would a home. For nature has given  us a place of entertainment, not of residence.    Oh glorious day when I shall set out to join that heavenly conclave and  company of souls, and depart from the turmoil and impurities of  this world! For I shall not go to join only those whom I have before  mentioned, but also my son Cato, than whom no better man was ever born,  nor one more conspicuous for piety. His body was burnt by me, though  mine ought, on the contrary, to have been burnt by him; but his spirit,  not abandoning, but ever looking back upon me, has certainly gone  whither he saw that I too must come. I was thought to bear that loss  heroically, not that I really bore it without distress, but I found my  own consolation in the thought that the parting and separation between  us was not to be for long.    It is by these means, my dear Scipio,--for you said that you and Laelius  were wont to express surprise on this point,--that my old age sits  lightly on me, and is not only not oppressive but even delightful.  But if I am wrong in thinking the human soul immortal, I am glad to be  wrong; nor will I allow the mistake which gives me so much pleasure  to be wrested from me as long as I live. But if when dead, as some  insignificant philosophers think, I am to be without sensation, I am not  afraid of dead philosophers deriding my errors. Again, if we are not to  be immortal, it is nevertheless what a man must wish--to have his  life end at its proper time. For nature puts a limit to living as to  everything else. Now, old age is as it were the playing out of the  drama, the full fatigue of which we should shun, especially when we also  feel that we have had more than enough of it.    This is all I had to say on old age. I pray that you may arrive at it,  that you may put my words to a practical test."]]]
