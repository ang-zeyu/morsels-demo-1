Vasari's story of an earlier Medusa, painted on a wooden shield,  is perhaps an invention; and yet, properly told, has more of the air  of truth about it than anything else in the whole legend.  For its  real subject is not the serious work of a man, but the experiment  of a child.  The lizards and glow-worms and other strange small  creatures which haunt an Italian vineyard bring before one the  whole picture of a child's life in a Tuscan dwelling--half castle,  half farm--and are as true to nature as the pretended  astonishment [106] of the father for whom the boy has prepared  a surprise.  It was not in play that he painted that other Medusa,  the one great picture which he left behind him in Florence.  The  subject has been treated in various ways; Leonardo alone cuts to  its centre; he alone realises it as the head of a corpse, exercising  its powers through all the circumstances of death.  What may be  called the fascination of corruption penetrates in every touch its  exquisitely finished beauty.  About the dainty lines of the cheek  the bat flits unheeded.  The delicate snakes seem literally  strangling each other in terrified struggle to escape from the  Medusa brain.  The hue which violent death always brings with it  is in the features; features singularly massive and grand, as we  catch them inverted, in a dexterous foreshortening, crown  foremost, like a great calm stone against which the wave of  serpents breaks.    The science of that age was all divination, clairvoyance,  unsubjected to our exact modern formulas, seeking in an instant  of vision to concentrate a thousand experiences.  Later writers,  thinking only of the well-ordered treatise on painting which a  Frenchman, Raffaelle du Fresne, a hundred years afterwards,  compiled from Leonardo's bewildered manuscripts, written  strangely, as his manner was, from right to left, have imagined a  rigid order in his inquiries.  But this rigid order would have been  little in [107] accordance with the restlessness of his character;  and if we think of him as the mere reasoner who subjects design  to anatomy, and composition to mathematical rules, we shall  hardly have that impression which those around Leonardo  received from him.  Poring over his crucibles, making  experiments with colour, trying, by a strange variation of the  alchemist's dream, to discover the secret, not of an elixir to make  man's natural life immortal, but of giving immortality to the  subtlest and most delicate effects of painting, he seemed to them  rather the sorcerer or the magician, possessed of curious secrets  and a hidden knowledge, living in a world of which he alone  possessed the key.  What his philosophy seems to have been most  like is that of Paracelsus or Cardan; and much of the spirit of the  older alchemy still hangs about it, with its confidence in short  cuts and odd byways to knowledge.  To him philosophy was to  be something giving strange swiftness and double sight, divining  the sources of springs beneath the earth or of expression beneath  the human countenance, clairvoyant of occult gifts in common or  uncommon things, in the reed at the brook-side, or the star which  draws near to us but once in a century.  How, in this way, the  clear purpose was overclouded, the fine chaser's hand perplexed,  we but dimly see; the mystery which at no point quite lifts from  Leonardo's life is deepest here.  But it is [108] certain that at one  period of his life he had almost ceased to be an artist.    The year 1483--the year of the birth of Raphael and the thirty-  first of Leonardo's life--is fixed as the date of his visit to Milan  by the letter in which he recommends himself to Ludovico  Sforza, and offers to tell him, for a price, strange secrets in the art  of war.  It was that Sforza who murdered his young nephew by  slow poison, yet was so susceptible of religious impressions that  he blended mere earthly passion with a sort of religious  sentimentalism, and who took for his device the mulberry-tree--  symbol, in its long delay and sudden yielding of flowers and fruit  together, of a wisdom which economises all forces for an  opportunity of sudden and sure effect.  The fame of Leonardo had  gone before him, and he was to model a colossal statue of  Francesco, the first Duke of Milan.  As for Leonardo himself, he  came not as an artist at all, or careful of the fame of one; but as a  player on the harp, a strange harp of silver of his own  construction, shaped in some curious likeness to a horse's skull.  The capricious spirit of Ludovico was susceptible also to the  power of music, and Leonardo's nature had a kind of spell in it.  Fascination is always the word descriptive of him.  No portrait of  his youth remains; but all tends to make us believe that up to this  time some charm of voice and aspect, strong enough to balance  the disadvantage of his birth, had [109] played about him.  His  physical strength was great; it was said that he could bend a  horseshoe like a coil of lead.    The Duomo, work of artists from beyond the Alps, so fantastic to  the eye of a Florentine used to the mellow, unbroken surfaces of  Giotto and Arnolfo, was then in all its freshness; and below, in  the streets of Milan, moved a people as fantastic, changeful, and  dreamlike.  To Leonardo least of all men could there be anything  poisonous in the exotic flowers of sentiment which grew there.  It  was a life of brilliant sins and exquisite amusements: Leonardo  became a celebrated designer of pageants; and it suited the  quality of his genius, composed, in almost equal parts, of  curiosity and the desire of beauty, to take things as they came.    Curiosity and the desire of beauty--these are the two elementary  forces in Leonardo's genius; curiosity often in conflict with the  desire of beauty, but generating, in union with it, a type of subtle  and curious grace.    The movement of the fifteenth century was twofold; partly the  Renaissance, partly also the coming of what is called the  \"modern spirit,\" with its realism, its appeal to experience.  It  comprehended a return to antiquity, and a return to nature.  Raphael represents the return to antiquity, and Leonardo the  return to nature.  In this return to nature, he was seeking to satisfy  a boundless curiosity by her perpetual surprises, [110] a  microscopic sense of finish by her finesse, or delicacy of  operation, that subtilitas naturae which Bacon notices.  So we  find him often in intimate relations with men of science,--with  Fra Luca Paccioli the mathematician, and the anatomist Marc  Antonio della Torre.  His observations and experiments fill  thirteen volumes of manuscript; and those who can judge  describe him as anticipating long before, by rapid intuition, the  later ideas of science.  He explained the obscure light of the  unilluminated part of the moon, knew that the sea had once  covered the mountains which contain shells, and of the gathering  of the equatorial waters above the polar.    He who thus penetrated into the most secret parts of nature  preferred always the more to the less remote, what, seeming  exceptional, was an instance of law more refined, the  construction about things of a peculiar atmosphere and mixed  lights.  He paints flowers with such curious felicity that different  writers have attributed to him a fondness for particular flowers,  as Clement the cyclamen, and Rio the jasmin; while, at Venice,  there is a stray leaf from his portfolio dotted all over with studies  of violets and the wild rose.  In him first appears the taste for  what is bizarre or recherché in landscape; hollow places full of  the green shadow of bituminous rocks, ridged reefs of trap-rock  which cut the water into quaint sheets of light,--their exact  antitype is in our own western seas; all the [111] solemn effects  of moving water.  You may follow it springing from its distant  source among the rocks on the heath of the Madonna of the  Balances, passing, as a little fall, into the treacherous calm of the  Madonna of the Lake, as a goodly river next, below the cliffs of  the Madonna of the Rocks, washing the white walls of its distant  villages, stealing out in a network of divided streams in La  Gioconda to the seashore of the Saint Anne--that delicate place,  where the wind passes like the hand of some fine etcher over the  surface, and the untorn shells are lying thick upon the sand, and  the tops of the rocks, to which the waves never rise, are green  with grass, grown fine as hair.  It is the landscape, not of dreams  or of fancy, but of places far withdrawn, and hours selected from  a thousand with a miracle of finesse.  Through Leonardo's  strange veil of sight things reach him so; in no ordinary night or  day, but as in faint light of eclipse, or in some brief interval of  falling rain at daybreak, or through deep water.    And not into nature only; but he plunged also into human  personality, and became above all a painter of portraits; faces of a  modelling more skilful than has been seen before or since,  embodied with a reality which almost amounts to illusion, on the  dark air.  To take a character as it was, and delicately sound its  stops, suited one so curious in observation, curious in invention.  He painted thus the portraits of Ludovico's [112] mistresses,  Lucretia Crivelli and Cecilia Galerani the poetess, of Ludovico  himself, and the Duchess Beatrice.  The portrait of Cecilia  Galerani is lost, but that of Lucretia Crivelli has been identified  with La Belle Feronière of the Louvre, and Ludovico's pale,  anxious face still remains in the Ambrosian library.  Opposite is  the portrait of Beatrice d'Este, in whom Leonardo seems to have  caught some presentiment of early death, painting her precise and  grave, full of the refinement of the dead, in sad earth-coloured  raiment, set with pale stones."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4065"],[0,"Side-Lights on Astronomy and Kindred Fields of Popular Science (#17)"],[1,"thirty  years, the rings are seen edgewise, and for a few days are invisible  even in a powerful telescope. For an entire year their form may be  difficult to make out with a small telescope. These unfavorable  conditions occur in 1907 and 1921. Between these dates, especially for  some years after 1910, the position of the planet in the sky will be  the most favorable, being in northern declination, near its perihelion,  and having its rings widely open. We all know that Saturn is plainly  visible to the naked eye, shining almost like a star of the first  magnitude, so that there is no difficulty in finding it if one knows  when and where to look. In 1906-1908 its oppositions occur in the month  of September. In subsequent years, it will occur a month later every  two and a half years. The ring can be seen with a common, good  spy-glass fastened to a post so as to be steady. A four or five-inch  telescope will show most of the satellites, the division in the ring,  and, when the ring is well opened, the curious dusky ring discovered by  Bond. This \"crape ring,\" as it is commonly called, is one of the most  singular phenomena presented by that planet.    It might be interesting to the amateur astronomer with a keen eye and a  telescope of four inches aperture or upward to frequently scrutinize  Saturn, with a view of detecting any extraordinary eruptions upon his  surface, like that seen by Professor Hall in 1876. On December 7th of  that year a bright spot was seen upon Saturn's equator. It elongated  itself from day to day, and remained visible for several weeks. Such a  thing had never before been known upon this planet, and had it not been  that Professor Hall was engaged in observations upon the satellites, it  would not have been seen then. A similar spot on the planet was  recorded in 1902, and much more extensively noticed. On this occasion  the spot appeared in a higher latitude from the planet's equator than  did Professor Hall's. At this appearance the time of the planet's  revolution on its axis was found to be somewhat greater than in 1876,  in accordance with the general law exhibited in the rotations of the  sun and of Jupiter. Notwithstanding their transient character, these  two spots have afforded the only determination of the time of  revolution of Saturn which has been made since Herschel the elder.    [Illustration with caption: THE GREAT REFRACTOR OF THE NATIONAL  OBSERVATORY AT WASHINGTON]    Of the satellites of Saturn the brightest is Titan, which can be seen  with the smallest telescope, and revolves around the planet in fifteen  days. Iapetus, the outer satellite, is remarkable for varying greatly  in brilliancy during its revolution around the planet. Any one having  the means and ability to make accurate photometrical estimates of the  light of this satellite in all points of its orbit, can thereby render  a valuable service to astronomy.    The observations of Venus, by which the astronomers of the last century  supposed themselves to have discovered its time of rotation on its  axis, were made with telescopes much inferior to ours. Although their  observations have not been confirmed, some astronomers are still  inclined to think that their results have not been refuted by the  failure of recent observers to detect those changes which the older  ones describe on the surface of the planet. With a six-inch telescope  of the best quality, and with time to choose the most favorable moment,  one will be as well equipped to settle the question of the rotation of  Venus as the best observer. The few days near each inferior conjunction  are especially to be taken advantage of.    The questions to be settled are two: first, are there any dark spots or  other markings on the disk? second, are there any irregularities in the  form of the sharp cusps? The central portions of the disk are much  darker than the outline, and it is probably this fact which has given  rise to the impression of dark spots. Unless this apparent darkness  changes from time to time, or shows some irregularity in its outline,  it cannot indicate any rotation of the planet. The best time to  scrutinize the sharp cusps will be when the planet is nearly on the  line from the earth to the sun. The best hour of the day is near  sunset, the half-hour following sunset being the best of all. But if  Venus is near the sun, she will after sunset be too low down to be well  seen, and must be looked at late in the afternoon.    The planet Mars must always be an object of great interest, because of  all the heavenly bodies it is that which appears to bear the greatest  resemblance to the earth. It comes into opposition at intervals of a  little more than two years, and can be well seen only for a month or  two before and after each opposition. It is hopeless to look for the  satellites of Mars with any but the greatest telescopes of the world.  But the markings on the surface, from which the time of rotation has  been determined, and which indicate a resemblance to the surface of our  own planet, can be well seen with telescopes of six inches aperture and  upward. One or both of the bright polar spots, which are supposed to be  due to deposits of snow, can be seen with smaller telescopes when the  situation of the planet is favorable.    The case is different with the so-called canals discovered by  Schiaparelli in 1877, which have ever since excited so much interest,  and given rise to so much discussion as to their nature. The astronomer  who has had the best opportunities for studying them is Mr. Percival  Lowell, whose observatory at Flaggstaff, Arizona, is finely situated  for the purpose, while he also has one of the best if not the largest  of telescopes. There the canals are seen as fine dark lines; but, even  then, they must be fifty miles in breadth, so that the word \"canal\" may  be regarded as a misnomer.    Although the planet Jupiter does not present such striking features as  Saturn, it is of even more interest to the amateur astronomer, because  he can study it with less optical power, and see more of the changes  upon its surface. Every work on astronomy tells in a general way of the  belts of Jupiter, and many speculate upon their causes. The reader of  recent works knows that Jupiter is supposed to be not a solid mass like  the earth, but a great globe of molten and vaporous matter,  intermediate in constitution between the earth and the sun. The outer  surface which we see is probably a hot mass of vapor hundreds of miles  deep, thrown up from the heated interior. The belts are probably  cloudlike forms in this vaporous mass. Certain it is that they are  continually changing, so that the planet seldom looks exactly the same  on two successive evenings. The rotation of the planet can be very well  seen by an hour's watching. In two hours an object at the centre of the  disk will move off to near the margin.    The satellites of this planet, in their ever-varying phases, are  objects of perennial interest. Their eclipses may be observed with a  very small telescope, if one knows when to look for them. To do this  successfully, and without waste of time, it is necessary to have an  astronomical ephemeris for the year. All the observable phenomena are  there predicted for the convenience of observers. Perhaps the most  curious observation to be made is that of the shadow of the satellite  crossing the disk of Jupiter. The writer has seen this perfectly with a  six-inch telescope, and a much smaller one would probably show it well.  With a telescope of this size, or a little larger, the satellites can  be seen between us and Jupiter. Sometimes they appear a little brighter  than the planet, and sometimes a little fainter.    Of the remaining large planets, Mercury, the inner one, and Uranus and  Neptune, the two outer ones, are of less interest than the others to an  amateur with a small telescope, because they are more difficult to see.  Mercury can, indeed, be observed with the smallest instrument, but no  physical configurations or changes have ever been made out upon his  surface. The question whether any such can be observed is still an open  one, which can be settled only by long and careful scrutiny. A small  telescope is almost as good for this purpose as a large one, because  the atmospheric difficulties in the way of getting a good view of the  planet cannot be lessened by an increase of telescopic power.    Uranus and Neptune are so distant that telescopes of considerable size  and high magnifying power are necessary to show their disks. In small  telescopes they have the appearance of stars, and the observer has no  way of distinguishing them from the surrounding stars unless he can  command the best astronomical appliances, such as star maps, circles on  his instrument, etc. It is, however, to be remarked, as a fact not  generally known, that Uranus can be well seen with the naked eye if one  knows where to look for it. To recognize it, it is necessary to have an  astronomical ephemeris showing its right ascension and declination, and  star maps showing where the parallels of right ascension and  declination lie among the stars. When once found by the naked eye,  there will, of course, be no difficulty in pointing the telescope upon  it.    Of celestial objects which it is well to keep a watch upon, and which  can be seen to good advantage with inexpensive instruments, the sun may  be considered as holding the first place. Astronomers who make a  specialty of solar physics have, especially in this country, so many  other duties, and their view is so often interrupted by clouds, that a  continuous record of the spots on the sun and the changes they undergo  is hardly possible. Perhaps one of the most interesting and useful  pieces of astronomical work which an amateur can perform will consist  of a record of the origin and changes of form of the solar spots and  faculae.
