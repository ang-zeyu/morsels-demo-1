[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2871"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication â€” Volume 1 (#17)"],[1,"mentioned are duns of various tints; but Mr. W.W. Edwards  has seen a nearly thoroughbred chestnut horse which had the spinal stripe,  and distinct bars on the legs; and I have seen two bay carriage-horses with  black spinal stripes; one of these horses had on each shoulder a light  shoulder-stripe, and the other had a broad back ill-defined stripe, running  obliquely half-way down each shoulder; neither had leg-stripes.    The most interesting case which I have met with occurred in a colt of my  own breeding. A bay mare (descended from a dark-brown Flemish mare by a  light grey Turcoman horse) was put to Hercules, a thoroughbred dark bay,  whose sire (Kingston) and dam were both bays. The colt ultimately turned  out brown; but when only a fortnight old it was a dirty bay, shaded with  mouse-grey, and in parts with a yellowish tint: it had only a trace of the  spinal stripe, with a few obscure transverse bars on the legs; but almost  the whole body was marked with very narrow dark stripes, in most parts so  obscure as to be visible only in certain lights, like the stripes which may  be seen on black kittens. These stripes were distinct on the hind-quarters,  where they diverged from the spine, and pointed a little forwards; many of  them as they diverged became a little branched, exactly in the same manner  as in some zebrine species. The stripes were plainest on the forehead  between the ears, where they formed a set of pointed arches, one under the  other, decreasing in size downwards towards the muzzle; exactly similar  marks may be seen on the forehead of the quagga and Burchell's zebra. When  this foal was two or three months old all the stripes entirely disappeared.  I have seen similar marks on the forehead of a fully grown, fallow-dun,  cob-like horse, having a conspicuous spinal stripe, and with its front legs  well barred.    In Norway the colour of the native horse or pony is dun, varying from  almost cream-colour to dark-mouse dun; and an animal is not considered  purely bred unless it has the spinal and leg-stripes. (2/34. I have  received information, through the kindness of the Consul-General, Mr. J.R.  Crowe, from Prof. Boeck, Rasck, and Esmarck, on the colours of the  Norwegian ponies. See also 'The Field' 1861 page 431.) My son estimated  that about a third of the ponies which he saw there had striped legs; he  counted seven stripes on the fore-legs and two on the hind-legs of one  pony; only a few of them exhibited traces of shoulder stripes; but I have  heard of a cob imported from Norway which had the shoulder as well as the  other stripes well developed. Colonel H. Smith (2/35. Col. Hamilton Smith  'Nat. Lib.' volume 12 page 275.) alludes to dun-horses with the spinal  stripe in the Sierras of Spain; and the horses originally derived from  Spain, in some parts of South America, are now duns. Sir W. Elliot informs  me that he inspected a herd of 300 South American horses imported into  Madras, and many of these had transverse stripes on the legs and short  shoulder-stripes; the most strongly marked individual, of which a coloured  drawing was sent me, was a mouse-dun, with the shoulder-stripes slightly  forked.    In the North-Western parts of India striped horses of more than one breed  are apparently commoner than in any other part of the world; and I have  received information respecting them from several officers, especially from  Colonel Poole, Colonel Curtis, Major Campbell, Brigadier St. John, and  others. The Kattywar horses are often fifteen or sixteen hands in height,  and are well but lightly built. They are of all colours, but the several  kinds of duns prevail; and these are so generally striped, that a horse  without stripes is not considered pure. Colonel Poole believes that all the  duns have the spinal stripe, the leg-stripes are generally present, and he  thinks that about half the horses have the shoulder-stripe; this stripe is  sometimes double or treble on both shoulders. Colonel Poole has often seen  stripes on the cheeks and sides of the nose. He has seen stripes on the  grey and bay Kattywars when first foaled, but they soon faded away. I have  received other accounts of cream-coloured, bay, brown, and grey Kattywar  horses being striped. Eastward of India, the Shan (north of Burmah) ponies,  as I am informed by Mr. Blyth, have spinal, leg, and shoulder stripes. Sir  W. Elliot informs me that he saw two bay Pegu ponies with leg-stripes.  Burmese and Javanese ponies are frequently dun-coloured, and have the three  kinds of stripes, \"in the same degree as in England.\" (2/36. Mr. G. Clark  in 'Annal and Mag. of Nat. History' 2nd series volume 2 1848 page 363. Mr.  Wallace informs me that he saw in Java a dun and clay-coloured horse with  spinal and leg stripes.) Mr. Swinhoe informs me that he examined two light-  dun ponies of two Chinese breeds, viz., those of Shanghai and Amoy; both  had the spinal stripe, and the latter an indistinct shoulder-stripe.    We thus see that in all parts of the world breeds of the horse as different  as possible, when of a dun-colour (including under this term a wide range  of tint from cream to dusty black), and rarely when almost white tinged  with yellow, grey, bay, and chestnut, have the several above-specified  stripes. Horses which are of a yellow colour with white mane and tail, and  which are sometimes called duns, I have never seen with stripes. (2/37. See  also on this point 'The Field' July 27, 1861 page 91.)    From reasons which will be apparent in the chapter on Reversion, I have  endeavoured, but with poor success, to discover whether duns, which are so  much oftener striped than other coloured horses, are ever produced from the  crossing of two horses, neither of which are duns. Most persons to whom I  have applied believe that one parent must be dun; and it is generally  asserted that, when this is the case, the dun-colour and the stripes are  strongly inherited. (2/38. 'The Field' 1861 pages 431, 493, 545.) One case,  however, has fallen under my own observation of a foal from a black mare by  a bay horse, which when fully grown was a dark fallow-dun and had a narrow  but plain spinal stripe. Hofacker (2/39. 'Ueber die Eigenschaften' etc.  1828 s. 13, 14.) gives two instances of mouse-duns (Mausrapp) being  produced from two parents of different colours and neither duns.    The stripes of all kinds are generally plainer in the foal than in the  adult horse, being commonly lost at the first shedding of the hair. (2/40.  Von Nathusius 'Vortrage uber Viehzucht' 1872 135.) Colonel Poole believes  that \"the stripes in the Kattywar breed are plainest when the colt is first  foaled; they then become less and less distinct till after the first coat  is shed, when they come out as strongly as before; but certainly often fade  away as the age of the horse increases.\" Two other accounts confirm this  fading of the stripes in old horses in India. One writer, on the other  hand, states that colts are often born without stripes, but that they  appear as the colt grows older. Three authorities affirm that in Norway the  stripes are less plain in the foal than in the adult. In the case described  by me of the young foal which was narrowly striped over nearly all its  body, there was no doubt about the early and complete disappearance of the  stripes. Mr. W.W. Edwards examined for me twenty-two foals of race-horses,  and twelve had the spinal stripe more or less plain; this fact, and some  other accounts which I have received, lead me to believe that the spinal  stripe often disappears in the English race-horse when old. With natural  species, the young often exhibit characters which disappear at maturity.]    The stripes are variable in colour, but are always darker than the rest of  the body. They do not by any means always coexist on the different parts of  the body: the legs may be striped without any shoulder-stripe, or the  converse case, which is rarer, may occur; but I have never heard of either  shoulder or leg-stripes without the spinal stripe. The latter is by far the  commonest of all the stripes, as might have been expected, as it  characterises the other seven or eight species of the genus. It is  remarkable that so trifling a character as the shoulder-stripe being double  or triple should occur in such different breeds as Welch and Devonshire  ponies, the Shan pony, heavy cart-horses, light South American horses, and  the lanky Kattywar breed. Colonel Hamilton Smith believes that one of his  five supposed primitive stocks was dun-coloured and striped; and that the  stripes in all the other breeds result from ancient crosses with this one  primitive dun; but it is extremely improbable that different breeds living  in such distant quarters of the world should all have been crossed with any  one aboriginally distinct stock. Nor have we any reason to believe that the  effects of a cross at a very remote period would be propagated for so many  generations as is implied on this view.    With respect to the primitive colour of the horse having been dun, Colonel  Hamilton Smith (2/41. 'Nat. Library' volume 12 1841 pages 109, 156 to 163,  280, 281. Cream-colour, passing into Isabella (i.e. the colour of the dirty  linen of Queen Isabella), seems to have been common in ancient times. See  also Pallas's account of the wild horses of the East, who speaks of dun and  brown as the prevalent colours. In the Icelandic sagas, which were  committed to writing in the twelfth century, dun-coloured horses with a  black spinal stripe are mentioned; see Dasent's translation volume 1 page  169.) has collected a large body of evidence showing that this tint was  common in the East as far back as the time of Alexander, and that the wild  horses of Western Asia and Eastern Europe now are, or recently were, of  various shades of dun. It seems that not very long ago a wild breed of dun-  coloured horses with a spinal stripe was preserved in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28711"],[0,"Operas Every Child Should Know (#17)"],[1,"singing a song of  their own, and everybody was in high feather.    Now to this fair had come two farmers in particular; one being farmer  Plunkett, and the other, altogether a handsome fellow, named Lionel,  who was the foster-brother of Plunkett. As a matter of fact, he was  left in his babyhood on the doorstep of Plunkett's father, who adopted  him and brought him up with his own son. The baby had had nothing by  which he could be identified, but there was a ring left with him, and  the instruction that it was to be shown to the Queen in case the boy  should ever find himself in serious trouble when he grew up. Now both  these gay farmers had come to secure maid-servants for the year, and  Plunkett came up to inspect the girls as they assembled.    \"What a clatter! This becomes a serious matter. How on earth is a man  to make a choice with such confusion all about him?\"    \"Oh well, there is no haste,\" Lionel replied leisurely.    \"No haste? I tell you, Lionel, we can't afford to lose any time. There  is that farm falling to pieces for need of a competent servant to look  after it! I should say there was haste, with a vengeance. We must get  a good stout maid to go home with us, or we shall be in a pretty fix.  You don't know much about these things, to be sure. You were always  our mother's favourite, and I the clumsy bear who got most of the  cuffs and ran the farm; but take my word for it, if we don't find good  maids we shall soon be ruined, because you are of no more use on a  farm than the fifth wheel is on a wagon.\"    \"Oh, come, come, brother, don't----\"    \"That's all right! I meant no harm. You are my brother and I'll stick  by you forever, but you aren't practical. Leave this maid-servant  business to me, and take my word for it we must hurry the matter up  and get home. Some day you'll be giving that fine ring of yours to  Queen Anne, Lionel, and then heaven knows what will happen; but I  suspect that whatever it is I shall find myself without a brother.\"    \"It shall never happen. I shall live and die quite contented beneath  the roof where we have grown up together and where I have been  happiest.\"    \"Ohe! Ohe! Ohe! the fair begins! Here comes the sheriff with his bell.  Ye maids, come forth now, both young and old! Come forth, come forth!  Make way there for the Law!\" bawled a crier, clearing the way for the  sheriff, who had come to preside over the business of contract-making  between the serving maids and the farmers.         I the statute first will read,       Then to business we'll proceed,    the burly sheriff called at the top of his voice; and all the yokels  laughed and crowded about him while he mounted a box and began to read  the Law. \"'Tis our royal will and pleasure--' Hats off! Rustics, look  at me! Loyal feelings let us cherish! 'We, Queen Anne, hereby decree  to all subjects of the crown, dwelling here in Richmond town, whoso at  the fair engages, to perform a servant's part, for a year her service  pledges; from this law let none depart.'\"         When the earnest money's taken, let the bargain stay unshaken!    \"Now, then, ye have heard? Stick to the bargains ye make--or the law  will get ye!\"    \"And now what can ye do, Molly Pitt?\"         I can sow, sir,       I can mow, sir,       I can bake and brew,       Mend things like new,       Can mind a house, and rule it, too,       There's naught I cannot do.    \"She's worth four guineas. Who will hire her?\"    Molly was at once hired by a farmer.    \"And now you, Polly Smith?\"         I can cook, sir,       By the book, sir,       I can roast and toast,       And 'tis my boast       That nothing in house       That I preside in yet was lost.    \"Polly's worth five guineas. Who wants her?\"    Polly was immediately hired by a farmer. After half a dozen buxom  girls had told what they could do, and had found places for the  year--none of them satisfying Plunkett and Lionel, however, who are  feeling almost discouraged at the outlook--Lady Harriet (who called  herself Martha) and Nancy and Sir Tristram came pushing merrily into  the crowd. Lady Harriet (or Martha) was certain to want to see  everything. Old Sir Tristram was protesting and having a most dreadful  time of it.    \"This way, Rob,\" Martha called, dragging him by the hand and laughing.  \"What! must I lead you?\"    \"Come, good, good Rob,\" Nancy mocked, entering into the spirit of it  and poking the old beau ahead of her. Sir Tristram groaned.    \"Oh, I am just like a lamb led to the slaughter.\"    \"Look, brother,\" Plunkett now said, nudging Lionel. \"What pretty  lasses! Theirs are not like servants' faces.\"    \"Let's inquire,\" Lionel replied, a good deal interested and staring at  Nancy and Martha.    \"Do you see how these disgusting rustics are staring? Let us fly,  Lady----\"    \"Martha,\" Lady Harriet reproved him. \"Don't forget I'm Martha.\"    \"Well, 'Martha,' let us go----\"    \"Not I! I am having the first moment of gaiety I have known in a year.  No, ye'll not go.\" Then in bravado and to torment Sir Tristram she set  up a cry:    \"No, here in the open fair, I refuse you for my master! I won't go  with you!\" By that outbreak she had attracted the attention of  everybody about. Nancy, too, set up a screech and everybody crowded  about them. Sir Tristram dared not say a word to help himself, because  if he should really displease Lady Harriet he knew it would be all up  with him.    \"Nonsense, nonsense,\" he said, confused and tormented.    \"Well, you can't force her, Master Rob,\" the frolicsome Nancy joined  in.    \"Force the girl? No, I think not, old fellow,\" Plunkett now cried,  coming forward with Lionel. The two of them had been watching the  quarrel. \"No farmer can hire a maid against her will. There are  servants to spare here; take your pick and let these alone,\" and the  tricky Martha and Nancy nearly fainted with trying to suppress their  laughter as they witnessed Sir Tristram's plight.    At that moment all the unhired serving maids rushed to Sir Tristram  and crowded about him and began their eternal, \"I can bake, sir, I can  brew, sir,\" etc., and begged him to hire them. Now this was the last  straw, and Sir Tristram looked for Martha and Nancy to come to his  assistance, but they only shrieked with laughter and urged the girls  on. Meantime, Plunkett and Lionel had approached them, and, when  Martha noticed that they were about to speak, she became a little  frightened.    \"Oh, see how they are looking at us!\" she gasped to Nancy.    \"Well, I can't say I mind it. I am willing to be seen,\" Nancy laughed,  still more giddily than Lady Harriet.    \"I'd like her to do the cooking,\" Plunkett remarked aside to Lionel  and pointing to Nancy.    \"I think it would be best to hire them both.\"    \"Well, that might be a good plan. Go up and bargain with them.\"    \"I do not dare,\" Lionel answered, hanging back.    \"Pooh! Then I must show you, now then--er--now then--er--ahem!\"  Plunkett, too, found himself embarrassed. In fact, the women did not  seem at all like the other serving maids, though their clothing was  that of the others.    \"Pooh, they'll never dare ask us!\" Nancy told Martha.    \"No, come on! Let's go!\" and they turned away. At that Lionel became  excited.    \"We shall lose them altogether! They are going!\"    So then Plunkett got up courage and went to them.    \"Damsels, listen! We would hire you. Have you ears? If your floors and  platters glisten, ye shall stay with us for years!\"    \"Yes--for--for years,\" Lionel managed to say.    \"What, as your servants?\" Lady Harriet gasped. Nancy laughed.    \"You are laughing?\" Lionel said. He was very anxious to hire them.  They were quite the handsomest serving maids he had ever seen.    \"No trouble about that,\" Plunkett declared. \"If she laughs, she will  certainly be good-natured about her work.\"    \"What work?\"    \"What work?\" Lady Harriet and Nancy said in one breath.    \"Oh, you are for the farmyard,\" Plunkett replied, reassuringly to Lady  Harriet, \"to keep the house and stable clean, you know. And you,\" to  Nancy, \"are to do the cooking.\"    \"You don't mean that this tender creature is to clean stables,  brother?\" Lionel demanded impulsively.    \"Well, she might work in the garden instead if she prefers it. Fifty  crowns shall be your wages; and, to be brief, everything found! Beer  and cheese for supper on week days; and on Sundays, good roast beef.\"    Lady Harriet tried to control her laughter.    \"Who could resist so splendid an offer,\" she asked of Nancy. Nancy for  her part was nearly dying of laughter.    \"Not we, not we, Martha.\"    \"'Tis done, then; we will go.\"    \"Then by the powers, here's the shilling to bind the bargain,\" Lionel  cried, fearful lest after all he and Plunkett should lose them; so he  handed over the shilling to Lady Harriet, who, not knowing that this  bound her to their service for a year, took it as a part of the fun.         Was there ever so droll a situation?       I began to feel not quite at ease,    the girls then said to each other, and they began to look about for  Tristram. He had got away, trying to rid himself of the maids, but now  he came back again, still followed by the whole of them. He was the  image of despair.    \"Here's a pound to pay the forfeit,\" he cried to the maids, giving  them money. \"And now for heaven's sake let me go. But--but how is  this--all so friendly,\" he gasped in amazement, observing Plunkett and  Lionel, Lady Harriet and Nancy.    \"Who are you?\" demanded Plunkett in a threatening manner.    \"Oh, good-bye,\" Harriet cried now to the farmers, and she went to Sir  Tristram. They had had enough of it now, and decided to go home.    \"Good-bye?\" cried Plunkett. \"Are you demented? Did ye not hire to us?  Good-bye?\"    \"Hush! O lord! That wasn't our intention. What if it should be heard  of at court?\"    \"Really we must go,\" she repeated, starting again to go to Tristram  while Plunkett held her back.    \"I guess you go no place but"]]]
