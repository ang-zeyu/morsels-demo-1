The change from the  bacchanalian riot in the great hall to the solemn pathos and woe of the  secret chamber sobered him rapidly. Even his obduracy gave way at last.  \"Caroline,\" said he, taking both her hands in his, \"I will not urge you  longer. I am called bad, and you think me so; but I am not brutal. It  was a promise made over the wine. Varin, the drunken beast, called you  Queen Vashti, and challenged me to show your beauty to them; and I swore  not one of their toasted beauties could match my fair Acadienne.\"    \"Did the Sieur Varin call me Queen Vashti? Alas! he was a truer prophet  than he knew,\" replied she, with ineffable sadness. \"Queen Vashti  refused to obey even her king, when commanded to unveil her face to the  drunken nobles. She was deposed, and another raised to her place. Such  may be my fate, Francois.\"    \"Then you will not go, Caroline?\"    \"No; kill me if you like, and bear my dead body into the hall, but  living, I can never show my face again before men--hardly before you,  Francois,\" added she, blushing, as she hid her tearful eyes on his  shoulder.    \"Well then, Caroline,\" replied, he, really admiring her spirit and  resolution, \"they shall finish their carouse without seeing you. The  wine has flowed to-night in rivers, but they shall swim in it without  you.\"    \"And tears have flowed down here,\" said she, sadly,--\"oh, so bitter! May  you never taste their bitterness, Francois!\"    Bigot paced the chamber with steadier steps than he had entered it. The  fumes were clearing from his brain; the song that had caught the ear of  Colonel Philibert as he approached the Chateau was resounding at  this moment. As it ceased Bigot heard the loud impatient knocking of  Philibert at the outer door.    \"Darling!\" said he, \"lie down now, and compose yourself. Francois Bigot  is not unmindful of your sacrifices for his sake. I must return to my  guests, who are clamoring for me, or rather for you, Caroline!\"    He kissed her cheek and turned to leave her, but she clung to his hand  as if wanting to say something more ere he went. She trembled visibly as  her low plaintive tones struck his ear.    \"Francois! if you would forsake the companionship of those men and  purify your table of such excess, God's blessing would yet descend upon  you, and the people's love follow you! It is in your power to be as good  as you are great! I have many days wished to say this to you, but alas,  I feared you too much. I do not fear you to-day, Francois, after your  kind words to me.\"    Bigot was not impenetrable to that low voice so full of pathos and love.  But he was at a loss what to reply: strange influences were flowing  round him, carrying him out of himself. He kissed the gentle head that  reclined on his bosom. \"Caroline,\" said he, \"your advice is wise and  good as yourself. I will think of it for your sake, if not for my own.  Adieu, darling! Go, and take rest: these cruel vigils are killing you,  and I want you to live in hope of brighter days.\"    \"I will,\" replied she, looking up with ineffable tenderness. \"I am sure  I shall rest after your kind words, Francois. No dew of Heaven was ever  more refreshing than the balm they bring to my weary soul. Thanks, O  my Francois, for them!\" She kissed his lips, and Bigot left the secret  chamber a sadder and for the moment a better man than he had ever been  before.    Caroline, overcome by her emotions, threw herself on a couch, invoking  blessings upon the head of the man by whom she had been so cruelly  betrayed. But such is woman's heart--full of mercy, compassion, and  pardon for every wrong, when love pleads for forgiveness.    \"Ha! ha!\" said Cadet, as the Intendant re-entered the great hall,  which was filled with bacchanalian frenzy. \"Ha! ha! His Excellency has  proposed and been rejected! The fair lady has a will of her own and  won't obey! Why, the Intendant looks as if he had come from Quintin  Corentin, where nobody gets anything he wants!\"    \"Silence, Cadet! don't be a fool!\" replied Bigot, impatiently, although  in the Intendant's usual mood nothing too gross or too bad could be said  in his presence but he could cap it with something worse.    \"Fool, Bigot! It is you who have been the fool of a woman!\" Cadet was  privileged to say anything, and he never stinted his speech. \"Confess,  your Excellency! she is splay-footed as St. Pedauque of Dijon! She dare  not trip over our carpet for fear of showing her big feet!\"    Cadet's coarse remark excited the mirth of the Intendant. The influences  of the great hall were more powerful than those of the secret chamber.  He replied curtly, however,--\"I have excused the lady from coming,  Cadet. She is ill, or she does not please to come, or she has a private  fancy of her own to nurse--any reason is enough to excuse a lady, or for  a gentleman to cease pressing her.\"    \"Dear me!\" muttered Cadet, \"the wind blows fresh from a new quarter!  It is easterly, and betokens a storm!\" and with drunken gravity he  commenced singing a hunting refrain of Louis XIV.:           \"'Sitot qu'il voit sa Chienne         Il quitte tout pour elle.\"'      Bigot burst out into immoderate laughter. \"Cadet,\" said he, \"you are,  when drunk, the greatest ruffian in Christendom, and the biggest knave  when sober. Let the lady sleep in peace, while we drink ourselves blind  in her honor. Bring in brandy, valets, and we will not look for day  until midnight booms on the old clock of the Chateau.\"    The loud knocking of Philibert in the great hall reverberated again and  again through the house. Bigot bade the valets go see who disturbed the  Chateau in that bold style.    \"Let no one in!\" added he \"'tis against the rule to open the doors when  the Grand Company are met for business! Take whips, valets, and scourge  the insolent beggars away. Some miserable habitans, I warrant, whining  for the loss of their eggs and bacon taken by the King's purveyors!\"    A servant returned with a card on a silver salver. \"An officer in  uniform waits to see your Excellency: he brings orders from the  Governor,\" said he to the Intendant.    Bigot looked at the card with knitted brows; fire sparkled in his eyes  as he read the name.    \"Colonel Philibert!\" exclaimed he, \"Aide-de-Camp of the Governor! What  the fiend brings HIM at such a time? Do you hear?\" continued he, turning  to Varin. \"It is your friend from Louisbourg, who was going to put you  in irons, and send you to France for trial when the mutinous garrison  threatened to surrender the place if we did not pay them.\"    Varin was not so intoxicated but the name of Philibert roused his anger.  He set his cup down with a bang upon the table. \"I will not taste a  drop more till he is gone,\" said he; \"curse Galissoniere's crooked  neck--could he not have selected a more welcome messenger to send to  Beaumanoir? But I have got his name in my list of debtors, and he shall  pay up one day for his insolence at Louisbourg.\"    \"Tut, tut, shut up your books! you are too mercantile for gentlemen,\"  replied Bigot. \"The question is, shall we allow Colonel Philibert to  bring his orders into the hall? Par Dieu! we are scarcely presentable!\"    But whether presentable or no, the words were scarcely spoken, when,  impatient at the delay, Philibert took advantage of the open door and  entered the great hall. He stood in utter amazement for a moment at the  scene of drunken riot which he beheld. The inflamed faces, the confusion  of tongues, the disorder, filth, and stench of the prolonged debauch  sickened him, while the sight of so many men of rank and high office  revelling at such an hour raised a feeling of indignation which he  had difficulty in keeping down while he delivered his message to the  Intendant.    Bigot, however, was too shrewd to be wanting in politeness. \"Welcome,  Colonel Philibert,\" said he; \"you are an unexpected guest, but a welcome  one! Come and taste the hospitality of Beaumanoir before you deliver  your message. Bustle, valets, bring fresh cups and the fullest carafes  for Colonel Philibert.\"    \"Thanks for your politeness, Chevalier! Your Excellency will please  excuse me if I deliver my message at once. My time is not my own  to-day, so I will not sit down. His Excellency the Governor desires your  presence and that of the Royal Commissaries at the council of war this  afternoon. Despatches have just arrived by the Fleur-de-Lis from home,  and the council must assemble at once.\"    A red flush rested upon the brow of Philibert as in his mind he measured  the important business of the council with the fitness of the men whom  he summoned to attend it. He declined the offer of wine, and stepped  backward from the table, with a bow to the Intendant and the company,  and was about to depart, when a loud voice on the further side of the  table cried out,--    \"It is he, by all that is sacred! Pierre Philibert! wait!\" Le Gardeur  de Repentigny rushed like a storm through the hall, upsetting chairs  and guests in his advance. He ran towards Colonel Philibert, who, not  recognizing the flushed face and disordered figure that greeted him,  shrank back from his embrace.    \"My God! do you not know me, Pierre?\" exclaimed Le Gardeur, wounded  to the quick by the astonished look of his friend. \"I am Le Gardeur de  Repentigny! O dear friend, look and recognize me!\"    Philibert stood transfixed with surprise and pain, as if an arrow had  stricken his eyes. \"You! you Le Gardeur de Repentigny? It is impossible!  Le Gardeur never looked like you--much less, was ever found among people  like these!\" The last words were rashly spoken, but fortunately not  heard amid the hubbub in the hall, or Philibert's life might have paid  the penalty from the excited guests.    \"And yet it is true; Pierre, look at me again. I am no other than he  whom you drew out of the St. Lawrence,"]]]
