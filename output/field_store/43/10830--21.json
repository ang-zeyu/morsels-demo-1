She is caught in the act by Creon's  watchmen and brought before the king. She justifies her action,  asserting that she was bound to obey the eternal laws of right and wrong  in spite of any human ordinance. Creon, unrelenting, condemns her to be  immured in a rock-hewn chamber. His son Haemon, to whom Antigone is  betrothed, pleads in vain for her life and threatens to die with her.  Warned by the seer Teiresias Creon repents him and hurries to release  Antigone from her rocky prison. But he is too late: he finds lying side  by side Antigone who had hanged herself and Haemon who also has perished  by his own hand. Returning to the palace he sees within the dead body of  his queen who on learning of her son's death has stabbed herself to the  heart.                                    *****                              DRAMATIS PERSONAE    ANTIGONE  and ISMENE--daughters of Oedipus and sisters  of  Polyneices        and Eteocles.

A WATCHMAN    A MESSENGER    A SECOND MESSENGER                                     *****                                   ANTIGONE                   ANTIGONE and ISMENE before the Palace gates.    ANTIGONE  Ismene, sister of my blood and heart,  See'st thou how Zeus would in our lives fulfill  The weird of Oedipus, a world of woes!  For what of pain, affliction, outrage, shame,  Is lacking in our fortunes, thine and mine?  And now this proclamation of today  Made by our Captain-General to the State,  What can its purport be?  Didst hear and heed,  Or art thou deaf when friends are banned as foes?    ISMENE  To me, Antigone, no word of friends  Has come, or glad or grievous, since we twain  Were reft of our two brethren in one day  By double fratricide; and since i' the night  Our Argive leaguers fled, no later news  Has reached me, to inspirit or deject.    ANTIGONE  I know 'twas so, and therefore summoned thee  Beyond the gates to breathe it in thine ear.    ISMENE  What is it?  Some dark secret stirs thy breast.    ANTIGONE  What but the thought of our two brothers dead,  The one by Creon graced with funeral rites,  The other disappointed?  Eteocles  He hath consigned to earth (as fame reports)  With obsequies that use and wont ordain,  So gracing him among the dead below.  But Polyneices, a dishonored corse,  (So by report the royal edict runs)  No man may bury him or make lament--  Must leave him tombless and unwept, a feast  For kites to scent afar and swoop upon.  Such is the edict (if report speak true)  Of Creon, our most noble Creon, aimed  At thee and me, aye me too; and anon  He will be here to promulgate, for such  As have not heard, his mandate; 'tis in sooth  No passing humor, for the edict says  Whoe'er transgresses shall be stoned to death.  So stands it with us; now 'tis thine to show  If thou art worthy of thy blood or base.    ISMENE  But how, my rash, fond sister, in such case  Can I do anything to make or mar?    ANTIGONE  Say, wilt thou aid me and abet?  Decide.    ISMENE  In what bold venture?  What is in thy thought?    ANTIGONE  Lend me a hand to bear the corpse away.    ISMENE  What, bury him despite the interdict?    ANTIGONE  My brother, and, though thou deny him, thine  No man shall say that _I_ betrayed a brother.    ISMENE  Wilt thou persist, though Creon has forbid?    ANTIGONE  What right has he to keep me from my own?    ISMENE  Bethink thee, sister, of our father's fate,  Abhorred, dishonored, self-convinced of sin,  Blinded, himself his executioner.  Think of his mother-wife (ill sorted names)  Done by a noose herself had twined to death  And last, our hapless brethren in one day,  Both in a mutual destiny involved,  Self-slaughtered, both the slayer and the slain.  Bethink thee, sister, we are left alone;  Shall we not perish wretchedest of all,  If in defiance of the law we cross  A monarch's will?--weak women, think of that,  Not framed by nature to contend with men.  Remember this too that the stronger rules;  We must obey his orders, these or worse.  Therefore I plead compulsion and entreat  The dead to pardon.  I perforce obey  The powers that be.  'Tis foolishness, I ween,  To overstep in aught the golden mean.    ANTIGONE  I urge no more; nay, wert thou willing still,  I would not welcome such a fellowship.  Go thine own way; myself will bury him.  How sweet to die in such employ, to rest,--  Sister and brother linked in love's embrace--  A sinless sinner, banned awhile on earth,  But by the dead commended; and with them  I shall abide for ever.  As for thee,  Scorn, if thou wilt, the eternal laws of Heaven.    ISMENE  I scorn them not, but to defy the State  Or break her ordinance I have no skill.    ANTIGONE  A specious pretext.  I will go alone  To lap my dearest brother in the grave.    ISMENE  My poor, fond sister, how I fear for thee!    ANTIGONE  O waste no fears on me; look to thyself.    ISMENE  At least let no man know of thine intent,  But keep it close and secret, as will I.    ANTIGONE  O tell it, sister; I shall hate thee more  If thou proclaim it not to all the town.    ISMENE  Thou hast a fiery soul for numbing work.    ANTIGONE  I pleasure those whom I would liefest please.    ISMENE  If thou succeed; but thou art doomed to fail.    ANTIGONE  When strength shall fail me, yes, but not before.    ISMENE  But, if the venture's hopeless, why essay?    ANTIGONE  Sister, forbear, or I shall hate thee soon,  And the dead man will hate thee too, with cause.  Say I am mad and give my madness rein  To wreck itself; the worst that can befall  Is but to die an honorable death.    ISMENE  Have thine own way then; 'tis a mad endeavor,  Yet to thy lovers thou art dear as ever.  [Exeunt]    CHORUS  (Str. 1)  Sunbeam, of all that ever dawn upon            Our seven-gated Thebes the brightest ray,                 O eye of golden day,  How fair thy light o'er Dirce's fountain shone,  Speeding upon their headlong homeward course,  Far quicker than they came, the Argive force;                 Putting to flight  The argent shields, the host with scutcheons white.  Against our land the proud invader came  To vindicate fell Polyneices' claim.            Like to an eagle swooping low,            On pinions white as new fall'n snow.  With clanging scream, a horsetail plume his crest,  The aspiring lord of Argos onward pressed.    (Ant. 1)  Hovering around our city walls he waits,  His spearmen raven at our seven gates.  But ere a torch our crown of towers could burn,  Ere they had tasted of our blood, they turn  Forced by the Dragon; in their rear  The din of Ares panic-struck they hear.  For Zeus who hates the braggart's boast  Beheld that gold-bespangled host;  As at the goal the paean they upraise,  He struck them with his forked lightning blaze.    (Str. 2)  To earthy from earth rebounding, down he crashed;       The fire-brand from his impious hand was dashed,  As like a Bacchic reveler on he came,  Outbreathing hate and flame,  And tottered.  Elsewhere in the field,  Here, there, great Area like a war-horse wheeled;            Beneath his car down thrust            Our foemen bit the dust.    Seven captains at our seven gates  Thundered; for each a champion waits,  Each left behind his armor bright,  Trophy for Zeus who turns the fight;  Save two alone, that ill-starred pair  One mother to one father bare,  Who lance in rest, one 'gainst the other  Drave, and both perished, brother slain by brother.    (Ant. 2)  Now Victory to Thebes returns again  And smiles upon her chariot-circled plain.            Now let feast and festal should            Memories of war blot out.            Let us to the temples throng,            Dance and sing the live night long.            God of Thebes, lead thou the round.            Bacchus, shaker of the ground!            Let us end our revels here;            Lo! Creon our new lord draws near,            Crowned by this strange chance, our king.            What, I marvel, pondering?            Why this summons?  Wherefore call            Us, his elders, one and all,            Bidding us with him debate,            On some grave concern of State?

I have heard them fall from the lips of men of letters and of  statesmen. When recently the disorderly state of the manufacturers of  Manchester menaced an insurrection, a profound Italian politician  observed to me, that it was not of a nature to alarm a great nation; for  that the remedy was at hand, in the proverb of the Lazzaroni of Naples,  _Meta consiglio, meta esempio, meta denaro!_ \"Half advice, half example,  half money!\" The result confirmed the truth of the proverb, which, had  it been known at the time, might have quieted the honest fears of a  great part of the nation.    Proverbs have ceased to be studied or employed in conversation since  the time we have derived our knowledge from books; but in a  philosophical age they appear to offer infinite subjects for speculative  curiosity. Originating in various eras, these memorials of manners, of  events, and of modes of thinking, for historical as well as for moral  purposes, still retain a strong hold on our attention. The collected  knowledge of successive ages, and of different people, must always enter  into some part of our own! Truth and nature can never be obsolete.    Proverbs embrace the wide sphere of human existence, they take all the  colours of life, they are often exquisite strokes of genius, they  delight by their airy sarcasm or their caustic satire, the luxuriance of  their humour, the playfulness of their turn, and even by the elegance of  their imagery, and the tenderness of their sentiment. They give a deep  insight into domestic life, and open for us the heart of man, in all the  various states which he may occupy--a frequent review of proverbs should  enter into our readings; and although they are no longer the ornaments  of conversation, they have not ceased to be the treasuries of Thought!      FOOTNOTES:      [29] Taylor's Translation of Plato's works, vol v. p. 36.      [30] Shakspeare satirically alludes to the quality of such rhymes in      his _Merchant of Venice_, Act v. Sc. 1. Speaking of one                      \"------ whose poesy was        For all the world like cutler's poetry        Upon a knife, _Love me, and leave me not_.\"      [31] One of the _fruit trenchers_, for such these roundels are      called in the _Gent. Mag._ for 1798, p. 398, is engraved there, and      the inscriptions of an entire set given.--See also the Supplement to      that volume, p. 1187. The author of the \"Art of English Poesie,\"      1589, tells us they never contained above one verse, or two at the      most, but the shorter the better. Two specimens may suffice the      reader. One, under the symbol of a skull, thus morally discourses:--          \"Content thyself with thine estate,        And send no poor wight from thy gate;        For why, this counsel I you give,        To learne to die, and die to live.\"        On another, decorated with pictures of fruit, are these satirical      lines:--          \"Feed and be fat: hear's pears and plums,        Will never hurt your teeth or spoil your gums.        And I wish those girls that painted are,        No other food than such fine painted fare.\"      [32] This constant custom of engraving \"posies,\" as they were      termed, on rings, is noted by many authors of the Elizabethan era.      Lilly, in his \"Euphues,\" addresses the ladies for a favourable      judgment on his work, hoping it will be recorded \"as you do the      posies in your rings, which are always next to the finger not to be      seene of him that holdeth you by the hand, and yet knowne by you      that weare them on your hands.\" They were always engraved withinside      of the ring. A MS. of the time of Charles I. furnishes us with a      single posy, of one line, to this effect--\"This hath alloy; my love      is pure.\" From the same source we have the two following rhyming, or      \"double posies\"--          \"Constancy and heaven are round,        And in this the emblem's found.\"        \"Weare me out, love shall not waste;        Love beyond tyme still is placed.\"      [33] Heywood's \"Dialogue, conteyninge the Number in Effecte of all      the Proverbes in the English Tunge, 1561.\" There are more editions      of this little volume than Warton has noticed. There is some humour      in his narrative, but his metre and his ribaldry are heavy taxes on      our curiosity.      [34] The whole of Tusser's \"Five Hundred Pointes of Good Husbandrie,\"      1580, was composed in quaint couplets, long remembered by the      peasantry for their homely worldly wisdom. One, constructed for the      bakehouse, runs thus:--          \"New bread is a drivell (waste);        Much crust is as evil.\"        Another for the dairymaid assures her--          \"Good dairie doth pleasure;        Ill dairie spends treasure.\"        Another might rival any lesson of thrift:--          \"Where nothing will last,        Spare such as thou hast.\"      [35] Townshend's Historical Collections, p. 283.      [36] It was published in 1616: the writer only catches at some      verbal expressions--as, for instance:--          The vulgar proverb runs, \"The more the merrier.\"          The cross,--\"Not so! one hand is enough in a purse.\"          The proverb, \"It is a great way to the bottom of the sea.\"          The cross,--\"Not so! it is but a stone's cast.\"          The proverb, \"The pride of the rich makes the labours of the poor.\"          The cross,--\"Not so! the labours of the poor make the pride of the        rich.\"          The proverb, \"He runs far who never turns.\"          The cross,--\"Not so! he may break his neck in a short course.\"      [37] It has been suggested that this whimsical amusement has been      lately revived, to a certain degree, in the _acting of charades_      among juvenile parties.      [38] Now the punning motto of a noble family.      [39] At the ROYAL INSTITUTION there is a fine copy of Polydore      Vergil's \"Adagia,\" with his other work, curious in its day, _De      Inventoribus Rerum_, printed by Frobenius, in 1521. The _wood-cuts_      of this edition seem to me to be executed with inimitable delicacy,      resembling a pencilling which Raphael might have envied.      [40] Since the appearance of the present article, several collections      of PROVERBS have been attempted. A little unpretending volume,      entitled \"Select Proverbs of all Nations, with _Notes_ and      _Comments_, by Thomas Fielding, 1824,\" is not ill arranged; an      excellent book for popular reading. The editor of a recent      miscellaneous compilation, \"The Treasury of Knowledge,\" has      whimsically bordered the four sides of the pages of a Dictionary      with as many proverbs. The plan was ingenious, but the proverbs are      not. Triteness and triviality are fatal to a proverb.      [41] A new edition of Ray's book, with large additions, was      published by Bohn, in 1855, under the title of \"A Handbook of      Proverbs.\" It is a vast collection of \"wise saws\" of all ages and      countries.          CONFUSION OF WORDS.      \"There is nothing more common,\" says the lively Voltaire, \"than to read  and to converse to no purpose. In history, in morals, in law, in physic,  and in divinity, be careful of equivocal terms.\" One of the ancients  wrote a book to prove that there was no word which did not convey an  ambiguous and uncertain meaning. If we possessed this lost book, our  ingenious dictionaries of \"synonyms\" would not probably prove its  uselessness. Whenever _the same word_ is associated by the parties with  _different ideas_, they may converse, or controverse, till \"the crack of  doom!\" This with a little obstinacy and some agility in shifting his  ground, makes the fortune of an opponent. While one party is worried in  disentangling a meaning, and the other is winding and unwinding about  him with another, a word of the kind we have mentioned, carelessly or  perversely slipped into an argument, may prolong it for a century or  two--as it has happened! Vaugelas, who passed his whole life in the  study of words, would not allow that the _sense_ was to determine the  meaning of _words_; for, says he, it is the business of _words_ to  explain the _sense_. Kant for a long while discovered in this way a  facility of arguing without end, as at this moment do our political  economists. \"I beseech you,\" exclaims a poetical critic, in the agony of  a confusion of words, on the Pope controversy, \"not to ask whether I  mean _this_ or _that_!\" Our critic, positive that he has made himself  understood, has shown how a few vague terms may admit of volumes of  vindication. Throw out a word, capable of fifty senses, and you raise  fifty parties! Should some friend of peace enable the fifty to repose on  one sense, that innocent word, no longer ringing the _tocsin_ of a  party, would lie in forgetfulness in the Dictionary. Still more  provoking when an identity of meaning is only disguised by different  modes of expression, and when the term has been closely sifted, to their  mutual astonishment both parties discover the same thing lying under the  bran and chaff after this heated operation. Plato and Aristotle probably  agreed much better than the opposite parties they raised up imagined;  their difference was in the manner of expression, rather than in the  points discussed. The Nominalists and the Realists, who once filled the  world with their brawls, and who from irregular words came to regular  blows, could never comprehend their alternate nonsense; \"whether in  employing general terms we use _words_ or _names_ only, or whether there  is _in nature anything_ corresponding to what we mean by a _general  idea_?\" The Nominalists only denied what no one in his senses would  affirm; and the Realists only contended for what no one in his senses  would deny; a hair's breadth"]]]
