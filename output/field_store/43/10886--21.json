Why on earth ain't they had one o' them fellers  down here long before this? They ain't seemed to hurry much.\"    \"Well, you see, at first 'twas more than half believed that the shooting  must have been by accident; and then, this is just between you and me,  Jones; didn't you ever think that even after that jury's verdict, and  the doctor's testimony, they, Doc. and the brother, might have wanted to  make sure, by a sort of private and more thorough investigation of the  wound, eh?\"    \"By crackey! Now that you speak of it, I heard Mason say't they was up  an' movin' round at the doctor's that livelong night! Yes, sir, I reckon  you've hit it!\"    \"My!\" mused Samuel Doran as he moved away from the gossip. \"They bite at  my yarns like babies on a teethin' ring. Doc. knows his fellow critters,  sure enough, and my work's laid out for me, I guess.\"    For Doran, after due consultation, and upon the doctor's voucher, had  been taken a little way into the confidence of the three men, and  Ferrars began to foresee in him a reliable helper.    The above brief conversation took place between Doran and Mr. Jones,  professional depot-lounger and occasional worker at odd jobs, while the  doctor was putting Hilda and Mrs. Marcy into a waiting carriage, and  when he had seen it drive away up town, Doran came forward and  addressed him in a tone quite audible to the bystanders.    \"You see, I didn't forget the carriage, Doc. Hope Miss Grant ain't none  the worse for her sad sort of journey.\" And then as the two walked away  from the platform together, and he saw the doctor's eyes glancing from  side to side, Doran went on. \"Looking for Mr. Grant, Doc.? Well, I guess  you won't see him; not before supper-time, anyhow. Fact is, I guess he's  sort of fancy struck on that pretty-faced widow down at the Glenville  House, and he's taken her out behind my greys this afternoon. I don't  know as I blame him any; she is a dainty little wid.\"    The doctor stared at him in amazement at his first words, and then broke  into a hearty laugh over the last.    \"Upon my word, Doran, you will be able to write a new dictionary of  abbreviations some day! Doran's Original! A dainty wid. is very good in  its way; only, is she a 'wid.'?\"    \"That's what they say at the Glenville. Widow and rich.\"    At the next corner Doran halted. \"Have to tear myself away,\" he said,  amiably. \"See you later,\" and the two men separated.    \"Well, old man, how have you fared during the lull in your business?\"  asked Doctor Barnes, as his man came to meet him. \"You don't look  overworked.\"    \"I ain't been, neither, sah. Your Mr. Grant or Ferrars, I ain't rightly  got his name, I guess, sir, he 'pears ter like the cooks down to the  Glenville better than me. I ain't had no bother with him since you left,  sir, 'cept to make up his bed.\"    \"I know. He has found some friends there, I fancy, Jude. Any news or  messages?\" and the doctor became at once absorbed in his neglected  business.    Ferrars made his appearance at \"supper time\" as Doran had described the  evening meal, and the two men had much to discuss. When Jude had placed  the last dishes and retired, the detective, who thus far had been  listening to the doctor's account of the journey and the sad funeral  obsequies, looked up and said: \"I suppose you have heard of my  wanderings, doctor, and how I have forsaken poor Jude? The fact is, I  have found plenty of leisure, and Mrs. Jamieson, when one comes to know  her a little, is a very ab--interesting woman. The sort of woman, in  fact, whose society I now and then enjoy. I have not neglected my duty,  however, but there is absolutely nothing new. And, by the bye, I must  see Miss Grant this evening; after that, if you are at liberty, we must  have a talk. I have decided upon a change of plan, of which you must  know.\"    He had left a note for Miss Grant, which advised her of his intended  call as soon as she should have become rested and refreshed. He was glad  to find her so strong and so composed, and he came at once to the  business in hand.    \"Miss Grant,\" he began, \"as I said in my note, I have something to  propose to you which has presented itself to me as the best course  during your absence; and, to begin, let me ask, have you still full  confidence in me as a detective, and as a man whom you may trust?\"    She lifted her fine clear eyes to his face and kept them there while she  replied.    \"I felt that I could trust you, Mr. Ferrars, when we first met. There  has been no change in that feeling unless it may be the change to a  larger measure of trust and confidence.\"    \"Thank you.\" And now the cool detective flushed like a schoolboy. \"I  shall try hard to deserve your good opinion, and it encourages me to  broach my singular proposal. I believe it will enable me to get on  easier and with more rapidity if you will permit me to continue for an  indefinite time in the role which I did not at first choose for myself,  and I ask you if I may still remain, in the eyes of Glenville, as now,  in the character of your cousin.\"    \"To remain--in Glenville?\"    \"When Doctor Barnes sent for me, advising me that I might arrive in the  character of your cousin, it was, of course, with the idea that this  masquerade would be a brief one, and it was undertaken because the  doctor knew how it would hamper if not really balk, my attempts to  unravel this mystery if I were known as a detective. I cannot explain  now, but I ask you to believe that, being here, I am now convinced that  in laying aside this character I should put out of my hands my best  weapon, the most direct means of following up and ferreting out a crime  which I fully believe will prove to have been--that is, if we succeed in  finding out the truth--a crime with a far-reaching plot behind it, and  the cause of which most of us have not even remotely dreamed of.\"    \"You have said enough. All is in your hands. Be what you will and must,  the better to prove to the world that Charles Brierly, my husband in the  sight of heaven, died as he lived, an upright gentleman and martyr, and  not the suicide or the victim of a righteous vengeance that most people  would for ever declare him if the truth is not made known.\"    \"Understand,\" he urged, \"that if you consent to this, you, as well as  myself, will have a part to play, and an active part, perhaps, in the  drama we are about to begin. Remember, you will have to keep up the  deception for weeks, possibly months; and to go and come at my desire.\"    \"Do you mean,\" she asked, breathlessly, \"that you may need my help?\"    \"I do need your help!\"    \"Oh!\" she cried, letting go her splendid self-restraint for the moment.  \"You don't know what you are doing for me! To be active, to do  something, instead of sitting still and eating my heart out in suspense.  It will save me from madness perhaps. What could a true relative do for  me more than you are doing and will do. You are my cousin!\" And she put  out her two hands to him with a new look of energy and resolve in her  face. As he took the two slim hands in both his own and looked in her  eyes, suddenly so aroused and purposeful, he saw for the first time, the  full strength and force of will and nature behind that fair face and  gentle bearing, the high spirit and courage animating the slender frame.    \"Thank you,\" he said, simply, as he released her hands. \"I feel that I  can indeed rely upon you at need. You have the strength; can you have  the patience as well? At present I can tell you very little. You will  have to take much upon trust.\"    \"I have anticipated that.\"    \"For example, it is my inflexible rule never to reveal the name of a  suspected person until I have at least partial proof of guilt, enough to  warrant an arrest. But you have a right to such confidence as I can  give, and so, if you have a question to ask, and I think you have, let  me answer it if I can.\"    \"Oh, I thank you.\" She came a step nearer. \"I ask myself one question,  over and over; that there was no guilty secret in my poor boy's life and  death, I know. Where, then, can be the motive?\"    \"The motive, ah! When we know that, we shall be at the beginning of the  end of the matter. Sit down, Miss Grant, and I will put the case before  you as I now see it.\"    She sank into the nearest seat without a word.    \"As to the manner of the murder,\" he went on, \"this is my conclusion.  Some one, an enemy who hated or feared him, has informed himself of Mr.  Charles Brierly's habits, and made himself familiar with the woods along  the lake shore. Your friend, I learn, has practised target-shooting for  some time. Have you ever thought that he might have had a reason for so  doing?\"    \"Good heavens! No!\"    \"Well, that is only a suggestion. But this much is certain, the deed was  premeditated, and carefully planned. I have satisfied myself that the  assassin, approaching from the south, made almost the circuit of that  long mound, after making sure that no one was near, in order to reach  the point, scarcely twelve feet from the place where the body was found,  from which to fire the fatal shot.\"    \"My God!\"    \"It was a bold venture, but not so dangerous as might at first appear. I  find that from a point half way to the top of the mound one might be  quite concealed from any one down by the lake shore while taking a long  look up and down the road. And, in case of approach, there is at the  south end of the mound a clump of bushes and young trees, where one  could easily remain concealed while awaiting the victim or the passing  of an interloper. From the town to a point not far south of the knoll or  mound, as your people call it, the ground between the road and lake has  been partially cleared of undergrowth for the comfort of picnickers and  fishing parties, I am told.\"    \"Yes.\" She sighed wonderingly. \"But beyond that, a person wishing to be  unseen from the lake or road could"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3533"],[0,"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town (#17)"],[1,"may be that  there are differences between Mariposa and the larger cities that one  doesn't appreciate at first sight. Perhaps it would have been better to  try some other plan.    Yet they followed along the usual line of things closely enough. They  began with the regular system of some of the business men getting  together in a quiet way.    First of all, for example, Henry Mullins came over quietly to Duff's  rooms, over the Commercial Bank, with a bottle of rye whiskey, and  they talked things over. And the night after that George Duff came over  quietly to Mullins's rooms, over the Exchange Bank, with a bottle  of Scotch whiskey. A few evenings after that Mullins and Duff went  together, in a very unostentatious way, with perhaps a couple of bottles  of rye, to Pete Glover's room over the hardware store. And then all  three of them went up one night with Ed Moore, the photographer, to  Judge Pepperleigh's house under pretence of having a game of poker. The  very day after that, Mullins and Duff and Ed Moore, and Pete Glover and  the judge got Will Harrison, the harness maker, to go out without any  formality on the lake on the pretext of fishing. And the next night  after that Duff and Mullins and Ed Moore and Pete Glover and Pepperleigh  and Will Harrison got Alf Trelawney, the postmaster, to come over, just  in a casual way, to the Mariposa House, after the night mail, and the  next day Mullins and Duff and--    But, pshaw! you see at once how the thing is worked. There's no need to  follow that part of the Whirlwind Campaign further. But it just shows  the power of organization.    And all this time, mind you, they were talking things over, and looking  at things first in one light and then in another light,--in fact, just  doing as the big city men do when there's an important thing like this  under way.    So after things had been got pretty well into shape in this way, Duff  asked Mullins one night, straight out, if he would be chairman of  the Central Committee. He sprung it on him and Mullins had no time to  refuse, but he put it to Duff straight whether he would be treasurer.  And Duff had no time to refuse.      That gave things a start, and within a week they had the whole  organization on foot. There was the Grand Central Committee and six  groups or sub-committees of twenty men each, and a captain for  every group. They had it all arranged on the lines most likely to be  effective.    In one group there were all the bankers, Mullins and Duff and Pupkin  (with the cameo pin), and about four others. They had their photographs  taken at Ed Moore's studio, taken in a line with a background of  icebergs--a winter scene--and a pretty penetrating crowd they looked, I  can tell you. After all, you know, if you get a crowd of representative  bank men together in any financial deal, you've got a pretty  considerable leverage right away.    In the second group were the lawyers, Nivens and Macartney and the  rest--about as level-headed a lot as you'd see anywhere. Get the lawyers  of a town with you on a thing like this and you'll find you've got a  sort of brain power with you that you'd never get without them.    Then there were the business men--there was a solid crowd for  you,--Harrison, the harness maker, and Glover, the hardware man, and  all that gang, not talkers, perhaps, but solid men who can tell you to  a nicety how many cents there are in a dollar. It's all right to talk  about education and that sort of thing, but if you want driving power  and efficiency, get business men. They're seeing it every day in the  city, and it's just the same in Mariposa. Why, in the big concerns  in the city, if they found out a man was educated, they wouldn't have  him,--wouldn't keep him there a minute. That's why the business men have  to conceal it so much.    Then in the other teams there were the doctors and the newspaper men and  the professional men like Judge Pepperleigh and Yodel the auctioneer.      It was all organized so that every team had its headquarters, two of  them in each of the three hotels--one upstairs and one down. And it  was arranged that there would be a big lunch every day, to be held in  Smith's caff, round the corner of Smith's Northern Health Resort and  Home of the Wissanotti Angler,--you know the place. The lunch was  divided up into tables, with a captain for each table to see about  things to drink, and of course all the tables were in competition with  one another. In fact the competition was the very life of the whole  thing.    It's just wonderful how these things run when they're organized. Take  the first luncheon, for example. There they all were, every man in his  place, every captain at his post at the top of the table. It was hard,  perhaps, for some of them to get there. They had very likely to be in  their stores and banks and offices till the last minute and then make a  dash for it. It was the cleanest piece of team work you ever saw.    You have noticed already, I am sure, that a good many of the captains  and committee men didn't belong to the Church of England Church. Glover,  for instance, was a Presbyterian, till they ran the picket fence of  the manse two feet on to his property, and after that he became a  free-thinker. But in Mariposa, as I have said, everybody likes to be in  everything and naturally a Whirlwind Campaign was a novelty. Anyway it  would have been a poor business to keep a man out of the lunches merely  on account of his religion. I trust that the day for that kind of  religious bigotry is past.    Of course the excitement was when Henry Mullins at the head of the table  began reading out the telegrams and letters and messages. First of all  there was a telegram of good wishes from the Anglican Lord Bishop of  the Diocese to Henry Mullins and calling him Dear Brother in Grace the  Mariposa telegraph office is a little unreliable and it read: \"Dear  Brother in grease,\" but that was good enough. The Bishop said that his  most earnest wishes were with them.    Then Mullins read a letter from the Mayor of Mariposa Pete Glover was  mayor that year--stating that his keenest desires were with them: and  then one from the Carriage Company saying that its heartiest good will  was all theirs; and then one from the Meat Works saying that its nearest  thoughts were next to them. Then he read one from himself, as head of  the Exchange Bank, you understand, informing him that he had heard  of his project and assuring him of his liveliest interest in what he  proposed.    At each of these telegrams and messages there was round after round of  applause, so that you could hardly hear yourself speak or give an order.  But that was nothing to when Mullins got up again, and beat on the  table for silence and made one of those crackling speeches--just the way  business men speak--the kind of speech that a college man simply can't  make. I wish I could repeat it all. I remember that it began: \"Now boys,  you know what we're here for, gentlemen,\" and it went on just as good as  that all through. When Mullins had done he took out a fountain pen  and wrote out a cheque for a hundred dollars, conditional on the fund  reaching fifty thousand. And there was a burst of cheers all over the  room.    Just the moment he had done it, up sprang George Duff,--you know the  keen competition there is, as a straight matter of business, between the  banks in Mariposa,--up sprang George Duff, I say, and wrote out a cheque  for another hundred conditional on the fund reaching seventy thousand.  You never heard such cheering in your life.    And then when Netley walked up to the head of the table and laid down  a cheque for a hundred dollars conditional on the fund reaching one  hundred thousand the room was in an uproar. A hundred thousand dollars!  Just think of it! The figures fairly stagger one. To think of a hundred  thousand dollars raised in five minutes in a little place like Mariposa!    And even that was nothing! In less than no time there was such a crowd  round Mullins trying to borrow his pen all at once that his waistcoat  was all stained with ink. Finally when they got order at last, and  Mullins stood up and announced that the conditional fund had reached a  quarter of a million, the whole place was a perfect babel of cheering.  Oh, these Whirlwind Campaigns are wonderful things!      I can tell you the Committee felt pretty proud that first day. There was  Henry Mullins looking a little bit flushed and excited, with his white  waistcoat and an American Beauty rose, and with ink marks all over him  from the cheque signing; and he kept telling them that he'd known all  along that all that was needed was to get the thing started and telling  again about what he'd seen at the University Campaign and about the  professors crying, and wondering if the high school teachers would come  down for the last day of the meetings.    Looking back on the Mariposa Whirlwind, I can never feel that it was  a failure. After all, there is a sympathy and a brotherhood in  these things when men work shoulder to shoulder. If you had seen the  canvassers of the Committee going round the town that evening shoulder  to shoulder from the Mariposa House to the Continental and up to  Mullins's rooms and over to Duffs, shoulder to shoulder, you'd have  understood it.    I don't say that every lunch was quite such a success as the first. It's  not always easy to get out of the store if you're a busy man, and a good  many of the Whirlwind Committee found that they had just time to hurry  down and snatch their lunch and get back again. Still, they came, and  snatched it. As long as the lunches lasted, they came. Even if they had  simply to rush it and grab something to eat and drink without time to  talk to anybody, they came.    No, no, it was not lack of enthusiasm that killed the Whirlwind Campaign  in Mariposa. It must have been something else. I don't just know what  it was but I think"]]]
