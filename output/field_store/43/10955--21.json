Even so may it be seen  that God keeps account of the good and the bad, and gives to each one  what he merits.    Note 1. The Porta Castello was the gate called after the Castle of S.  Angelo. Prati, so far as I can make out, was an open space between the  Borgo and the Bridge of S. Angelo. In order to get inside Rome itself,  Cellini had to pass a second gate. His own lodging and Pantasileas  house were in the quarter of the Bianchi, where are now the Via Giulia  and Via de Banchi Vecchi.    XXXIV    THE WHOLE world was now in warfare. [1] Pope Clement had sent to get  some troops from Giovanni de Medici, and when they came, they made such  disturbances in Rome, that it was ill living in open shops. [2] On this  account I retired to a good snug house behind the Banchi, where I worked  for all the friends I had acquired. Since I produced few things of much  importance at that period, I need not waste time in talking about them.  I took much pleasure in music and amusements of the kind. On the death  of Giovanni de Medici in Lombardy, the Pope, at the advice of Messer  Jacopo Salviati, dismissed the five bands he had engaged; and when the  Constable of Bourbon knew there were no troops in Rome, he pushed his  army with the utmost energy up to the city. The whole of Rome upon this  flew to arms. I happened to be intimate with Alessandro, the son of  Piero del Bene, who, at the time when the Colonnesi entered Rome, had  requested me to guard his palace. [3] On this more serious occasion,  therefore, he prayed me to enlist fifty comrades for the protection of  the said house, appointing me their captain, as I had been when the  Colonnesi came. So I collected fifty young men of the highest courage,  and we took up our quarters in his palace, with good pay and excellent  appointments.    Bourbons army had now arrived before the walls of Rome, and Alessandro  begged me to go with him to reconnoitre. So we went with one of the  stoutest fellows in our Company; and on the way a youth called Cecchino  della Casa joined himself to us. On reaching the walls by the Campo  Santo, we could see that famous army, which was making every effort to  enter the town. Upon the ramparts where we took our station several  young men were lying killed by the besiegers; the battle raged there  desperately, and there was the densest fog imaginable. I turned to  Alessandro and said: Let us go home as soon as we can, for there is  nothing to be done here; you see the enemies are mounting, and our men  are in flight. Alessandro, in a panic, cried: Would God that we had  never come here! and turned in maddest haste to fly. I took him up  somewhat sharply with these words: Since you have brought me here, I  must perform some action worthy of a man; and directing my arquebuse  where I saw the thickest and most serried troop of fighting men, I aimed  exactly at one whom I remarked to be higher than the rest; the fog  prevented me from being certain whether he was on horseback or on foot.  Then I turned to Alessandro and Cecchino, and bade them discharge their  arquebuses, showing them how to avoid being hit by the besiegers. When  we had fired two rounds apiece, I crept cautiously up to the wall, and  observing among the enemy a most extraordinary confusion, I discovered  afterwards that one of our shots had killed the Constable of Bourbon;  and from what I subsequently learned, he was the man whom I had first  noticed above the heads of the rest. [4]    Quitting our position on the ramparts, we crossed the Campo Santo, and  entered the city by St. Peters; then coming out exactly at the church  of Santo Agnolo, we got with the greatest difficulty to the great gate  of the castle; for the generals Renzo di Ceri and Orazio Baglioni were  wounding and slaughtering everybody who abandoned the defence of the  walls. [5] By the time we had reached the great gate, part of the foemen  had already entered Rome, and we had them in our rear. The castellan had  ordered the portcullis to be lowered, in order to do which they cleared  a little space, and this enabled us four to get inside. On the instant  that I entered, the captain Pallone de Medici claimed me as being of  the Papal household, and forced me to abandon Alessandro, which I had to  do, much against my will. I ascended to the keep, and at the same  instant Pope Clement came in through the corridors into the castle; he  had refused to leave the palace of St. Peter earlier, being unable to  believe that his enemies would effect their entrance into Rome. [6]  Having got into the castle in this way, I attached myself to certain  pieces of artillery, which were under the command of a bombardier called  Giuliano Fiorentino. Leaning there against the battlements, the unhappy  man could see his poor house being sacked, and his wife and children  outraged; fearing to strike his own folk, he dared not discharge the  cannon, and flinging the burning fuse upon the ground, he wept as though  his heart would break, and tore his cheeks with both his hands. [7] Some  of the other bombardiers were behaving in like manner; seeing which, I  took one of the matches, and got the assistance of a few men who were  not overcome by their emotions. I aimed some swivels and falconets at  points where I saw it would be useful, and killed with them a good  number of the enemy. Had it not been for this, the troops who poured  into Rome that morning, and were marching straight upon the castle,  might possibly have entered it with ease, because the artillery was  doing them no damage. I went on firing under the eyes of several  cardinals and lords, who kept blessing me and giving me the heartiest  encouragement. In my enthusiasm I strove to achieve the impossible; let  it suffice that it was I who saved the castle that morning, and brought  the other bombardiers back to their duty. [8] I worked hard the whole of  that day; and when the evening came, while the army was marching into  Rome through the Trastevere, Pope Clement appointed a great Roman  nobleman named Antonio Santacroce to be captain of all the gunners. The  first thing this man did was to come to me, and having greeted me with  the utmost kindness, he stationed me with five fine pieces of artillery  on the highest point of the castle, to which the name of the Angel  specially belongs. This circular eminence goes round the castle, and  surveys both Prati and the town of Rome. The captain put under my orders  enough men to help in managing my guns, and having seen me paid in  advance, he gave me rations of bread and a little wine, and begged me to  go forward as I had begun. I was perhaps more inclined by nature to the  profession of arms than to the one I had adopted, and I took such  pleasure in its duties that I discharged them better than those of my  own art. Night came, the enemy had entered Rome, and we who were in the  castle (especially myself, who have always taken pleasure in  extraordinary sights) stayed gazing on the indescribable scene of tumult  and conflagration in the streets below. People who were anywhere else  but where we were, could not have formed the least imagination of what  it was. I will not, however, set myself to describe that tragedy, but  will content myself with continuing the history of my own life and the  circumstances which properly belong to it.    Note 1. War had broken out in 1521 between Charles V and Francis I,  which disturbed all Europe and involved the States of Italy in serious  complications. At the moment when this chapter opens, the Imperialist  army under the Constable of Bourbon was marching upon Rome in 1527.    Note 2. These troops entered Rome in October 1526. They were disbanded  in March, 1527.    Note 3. Cellini here refers to the attack made upon Rome by the great  Ghibelline house of Colonna, led by their chief captain, Pompeo, in  September 1526. They took possession of the city and drove Clement into  the Castle of S. Angelo, where they forced him to agree to terms  favouring the Imperial cause. It was customary for Roman gentlemen to  hire bravi for the defence of their palaces when any extraordinary  disturbance was expected, as, for example, upon the vacation of the  Papal Chair.    Note 4. All historians of the sack of Rome agree in saying that Bourbon  was shot dead while placing ladders against the outworks near the shop  Cellini mentions. But the honour of firing the arquebuse which brought  him down cannot be assigned to any one in particular. Very different  stories were current on the subject. See Gregorovius, 'Stadt Rom.,' vol.  viii. p. 522.    Note 5. For Renzo di Ceri see above. Orazio Baglioni, of the  semi-princely Perugian family, was a distinguished Condottiere. He  subsequently obtained the captaincy of the Bande Nere, and died fighting  near Naples in 1528. Orazio murdered several of his cousins in order to  acquire the lordship of Perugia. His brother Malatesta undertook to  defend Florence in the siege of 1530, and sold the city by treason to  Clement.    Note 6. Giovio, in his Life of the Cardinal Prospero Colonna, relates  how he accompanied Clement in his flight from the Vatican to the castle.  While passing some open portions of the gallery, he threw his violent  mantle and cap of a Monsignore over the white stole of the Pontiff, for  fear he might be shot at by the soldiers in the streets below.    Note 7. The short autobiography of Raffaello da Montelupo, a man in many  respects resembling Cellini, confirms this part of our authors  narrative. It is one of the most interesting pieces of evidence  regarding what went on inside the castle during the sack of Rome.  Montelupo was also a gunner, and commanded two pieces.    Note 8. This is an instance of Cellinis exaggeration. He did more than  yeomans service, no doubt. But we cannot believe that, without him, the  castle would have been taken.    XXXV    DURING the"]]]
