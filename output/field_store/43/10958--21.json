Jimmy got up and walked round to the door, which he opened. Spike  shot out. He was not lacking in courage, but he disliked  embarrassing interviews, and it struck him that Jimmy was the man to  handle a situation of this kind. He felt that he himself would only  be in the way.    \"Now, we can talk comfortably,\" said Jimmy, going back to his chair.    McEachern's deep-set eyes gleamed, and his forehead grew red, but he  mastered his feelings.    \"And now--\" said he, then paused.    \"Yes?\" asked Jimmy.    \"What are you doing here?\"    \"Nothing, at the moment.\"    \"You know what I mean. Why are you here, you and that red-headed  devil, Spike Mullins?\" He jerked his head in the direction of the  door.    \"I am here because I was very kindly invited to come by Lord  Dreever.\"    \"I know you.\"    \"You have that privilege. Seeing that we only met once, it's very  good of you to remember me.\"    \"What's your game? What do you mean to do?\"    \"To do? Well, I shall potter about the garden, you know, and shoot a  bit, perhaps, and look at the horses, and think of life, and feed  the chickens--I suppose there are chickens somewhere about--and  possibly go for an occasional row on the lake. Nothing more. Oh,  yes, I believe they want me to act in some theatricals.\"    \"You'll miss those theatricals. You'll leave here to-morrow.\"    \"To-morrow? But I've only just arrived, dear heart.\"    \"I don't care about that. Out you go to-morrow. I'll give you till  to-morrow.\"    \"I congratulate you,\" said Jimmy. \"One of the oldest houses in  England.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"I gathered from what you said that you had bought the Castle. Isn't  that so? If it still belongs to Lord Dreever, don't you think you  ought to consult him before revising his list of guests?\"    McEachern looked steadily at him. His manner became quieter.    \"Oh, you take that tone, do you?\"    \"I don't know what you mean by 'that tone.' What tone would you take  if a comparative stranger ordered you to leave another man's house?\"    McEachern's massive jaw protruded truculently in the manner that had  scared good behavior into brawling East Siders.    \"I know your sort,\" he said. \"I'll call your bluff. And you won't  get till to-morrow, either. It'll be now.\"    \"'Why should we wait for the morrow? You are queen of my heart  to-night,\" murmured Jimmy, encouragingly.    \"I'll expose you before them all. I'll tell them everything.\"    Jimmy shook his head.    \"Too melodramatic,\" he said. \"'I call on heaven to judge between  this man and me!' kind of thing. I shouldn't. What do you propose to  tell, anyway?\"    \"Will you deny that you were a crook in New York?\"    \"I will. I was nothing of the kind.\"    \"What?\"    \"If you'll listen, I can explain--\"    \"Explain!\" The other's voice rose again. \"You talk about explaining,  you scum, when I caught you in my own parlor at three in the  morning--you--\"    The smile faded from Jimmy's face.    \"Half a minute,\" he said. It might be that the ideal course would be  to let the storm expend itself, and then to explain quietly the  whole matter of Arthur Mifflin and the bet that had led to his one  excursion into burglary; but he doubted it. Things--including his  temper--had got beyond the stage of quiet explanations. McEachern  would most certainly disbelieve his story. What would happen after  that he did not know. A scene, probably: a melodramatic  denunciation, at the worst, before the other guests; at the best,  before Sir Thomas alone. He saw nothing but chaos beyond that. His  story was thin to a degree, unless backed by witnesses, and his  witnesses were three thousand miles away. Worse, he had not been  alone in the policeman's parlor. A man who is burgling a house for a  bet does not usually do it in the company of a professional burglar,  well known to the police.    No, quiet explanations must be postponed. They could do no good, and  would probably lead to his spending the night and the next few  nights at the local police-station. And, even if he were spared that  fate, it was certain that he would have to leave the castle--leave  the castle and Molly!    He jumped up. The thought had stung him.    \"One moment,\" he said.    McEachern stopped.    \"Well?\"    \"You're going to tell them that?\" asked Jimmy.    \"I am.\"    Jimmy walked up to him.    \"Are you also going to tell them why you didn't have me arrested  that night?\" he said.    McEachern started. Jimmy planted himself in front of him, and glared  up into his face. It would have been hard to say which of the two  was the angrier. The policeman was flushed, and the veins stood out  on his forehead. Jimmy was in a white heat of rage. He had turned  very pale, and his muscles were quivering. Jimmy in this mood had  once cleared a Los Angeles bar-room with the leg of a chair in the  space of two and a quarter minutes by the clock.    \"Are you?\" he demanded. \"Are you?\"    McEachern's hand, hanging at his side, lifted itself hesitatingly.  The fingers brushed against Jimmy's shoulder.    Jimmy's lip twitched.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"do it! Do it, and see what happens. By God, if you  put a hand on me, I'll finish you. Do you think you can bully me? Do  you think I care for your size?\"    McEachern dropped his hand. For the first time in his life, he had  met a man who, instinct told him, was his match and more. He stepped  back a pace.    Jimmy put his hands in his pockets, and turned away. He walked to  the mantelpiece, and leaned his back against it.    \"You haven't answered my question,\" he said. \"Perhaps, you can't?\"    McEachern was wiping his forehead, and breathing quickly.    \"If you like,\" said Jimmy, \"we'll go down to the drawing-room now,  and you shall tell your story, and I'll tell mine. I wonder which  they will think the more interesting. Damn you,\" he went on, his  anger rising once more, \"what do you mean by it? You come into my  room, and bluster, and talk big about exposing crooks. What do you  call yourself, I wonder? Do you realize what you are? Why, poor  Spike's an angel compared with you. He did take chances. He wasn't  in a position of trust. You--\"    He stopped.    \"Hadn't you better get out of here, don't you think?\" he said,  curtly.    Without a word, McEachern walked to the door, and went out.    Jimmy dropped into a chair with a deep breath. He took up his  cigarette-case, but before he could light a match the gong sounded  from the distance.    He rose, and laughed rather shakily. He felt limp. \"As an effort at  conciliating papa,\" he said, \"I'm afraid that wasn't much of a  success.\"    It was not often that McEachern was visited by ideas. He ran rather  to muscle than to brain. But he had one that evening during dinner.  His interview with Jimmy had left him furious, but baffled. He knew  that his hands were tied. Frontal attack was useless. To drive Jimmy  from the castle would be out of the question. All that could be done  was to watch him while he was there. For he had never been more  convinced of anything in his life than that Jimmy had wormed his way  into the house-party with felonious intent. The appearance of Lady  Julia at dinner, wearing the famous rope of diamonds, supplied an  obvious motive. The necklace had an international reputation.  Probably, there was not a prominent thief in England or on the  Continent who had not marked it down as a possible prey. It had  already been tried for, once. It was big game, just the sort of lure  that would draw the type of criminal McEachern imagined Jimmy to be.    From his seat at the far end of the table, Jimmy looked at the  jewels as they gleamed on their wearer's neck. They were almost too  ostentatious for what was, after all, an informal dinner. It was not  a rope of diamonds. It was a collar. There was something Oriental  and barbaric in the overwhelming display of jewelry. It was a prize  for which a thief would risk much.    The conversation, becoming general with the fish, was not of a kind  to remove from his mind the impression made by the sight of the  gems. It turned on burglary.    Lord Dreever began it.    \"Oh, I say,\" he said, \"I forgot to tell you, Aunt Julia, Number Six  was burgled the other night.\"    Number 6a, Eaton Square, was the family's London house.    \"Burgled!\" cried Sir Thomas.    \"Well, broken into,\" said his lordship, gratified to find that he  had got the ear of his entire audience. Even Lady Julia was silent  and attentive. \"Chap got in through the scullery window about one  o'clock in the morning.\"    \"And what did you do?\" inquired Sir Thomas.    \"Oh, I--er--I was out at the time,\" said Lord Dreever. \"But  something frightened the feller,\" he went on hurriedly, \"and he made  a bolt for it without taking anything.\"    \"Burglary,\" said a young man, whom Jimmy subsequently discovered to  be the drama-loving Charteris, leaning back and taking advantage of  a pause, \"is the hobby of the sportsman and the life work of the  avaricious.\" He took a little pencil from his waistcoat pocket, and  made a rapid note on his cuff.    Everybody seemed to have something to say on the subject. One young  lady gave it as her opinion that she would not like to find a  burglar under her bed. Somebody else had heard of a fellow whose  father had fired at the butler, under the impression that he was a  house-breaker, and had broken a valuable bust of Socrates. Lord  Dreever had known a man at college whose brother wrote lyrics for  musical comedy, and had done one about a burglar's best friend being  his mother.    \"Life,\" said Charteris, who had had time for reflection, \"is a house  which we all burgle. We enter it uninvited, take all that we can lay  hands on, and go out again.\" He scribbled, \"Life--house--burgle,\" on  his cuff, and replaced the pencil.    \"This man's brother I was telling you about,\" said Lord Dreever,  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40780"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: King AEthelbert - King George III, 600 A.D. - 1776 (#17)"],[1,"that he makes full amends both towards God and  towards men. The first conditon is that he shall give his own wergeld  to Christ and to the king and by that means obtain the legal right to  offer compensation. And if the king allows compensation, amends for the  violation of the protection of the church shall be made by the payment  to the church of the full fine for breach of the king's mund, and the  purification of the church shall be carried out as is fiting, and  compensation both to the kin and to the lord of the slain man shall be  fully psid, and supplication shall earnestly be made to God. If the  protection of the church is broken by offenses such as fighting or  robbery, without the taking of life, amends shall diligently be made in  accordance with the nature of the offense. The penalty for violation of  the protection of a principal church is 5 pounds, for a church of  medium rank is 120s., for a church with a graveyard 60s., and for a  country chapel where there is no graveyard, 30s.    Maintain the security and sanctity of holy things and priests according  to their rank, for they drive away devils, baptize anyone, hallow the  Eucharist, and intercede to Christ for the needs of the people. If an  accusation of evil practices is made against a priest and he knows  himself to be guiltless, he shall say Mass, if he dares, and thus clear  himelf by the Holy Communion in the cases of a simple accusation, and  by the Holy Communion with two supporters of the same ecclesiastical  rank in the case of a triple accusation. If he has no supporters, he  shall go to the ordeal of consecrated bread.    No monk who belongs to a monastery may demand or pay compensation  incurred by vendetta because he leaves the law of his kindred behind  when he accepts monastic rule.    If a priest is concerned in false witness or perjury or is the  accessory and accomplice of thieves, he shall be cast out from the  fellowship of those in holy orders and forfeit every privilege, unless  he make amends both towards God and towards men, as the bishop shall  prescribe, and find surtey for future behavior.    Servants of God shall call upon Christ to intercede for all Christian  people and practice celibacy. Those who turn away from marriage and  observe celibacy shall enjoy the privileges of a thegn.    *No Christian man shall marry among his own kin within six degress of  relationship or with the widow of a man as nearly related to him as  that, or with a near relative of his first wife's. No man shall marry  his god-mother, a nun, or a divorced woman. He shall not commit  adultery. He shall have no more wives that one, with whom he shall  remain as long as she lives.    Ecclesiastical dues shall be paid yearly, namely, plough alms 15 days  after Easter, the tithe [tenth] of young animals at Pentecost, and the  tithe of the fruits of the earth at All Saints. Otherwise the king's  reeve, the bishop's reeve, and the lord's reeve shall take what is due  and assign him the next tenth, and the eight remaining parts shall go  half to the lord and half to the bishop.    Peter's Pence shall be paid by St. Peter's Day or pay the bishop the  penny and 30d. in addition and 120s. to the king.    Church dues shall be paid at Martinmas, or pay the biship eleven fold  and 120s. to the king.    Any thegn with a church with attached graveyard on his land shall give  a third part of his own tithes to his church. If he has a church  without a graveyard, he shall give his priest whatever he desires from  the nine remaining parts.    Light dues shall be paid a halfpenny worth of wax from every hide three  times a year.    Payment for the souls of the dead should be rendered before the grave  is closed.    *All festivals and fasts, such as Lent, shall be observed. The festival  of every Sunday shall be observed from noon on Saturday till dawn on  Monday. No trading, public gatherings, hunting, or secular occupations  shall be done on Sunday. We forbid ordeals and oaths during festivals  and fasts.    To avoid the torment of hell, let us turn away from sin and confess our  misdeeds to out confessors and cease from evil and make amends.    Each of us shall treat others as we desire to be treated.    Every Christian man shall prepare himself for the sacrament at least  three times a year. Every friend shall abide by his oath and pledge.  Every injustice shall be cast out from this land.    Let us be faithful and true to our lord and promote his honour and  carry out his will. And likewise, it is the duty of every lord to treat  his men justly.    Men of every estate shall readily submit to the duty which befits them.    Every Christian man shall learn the Creed and the Pater Noster, the  sacred prayer taught by Christ to his disciples which contains all the  petitions necessary for this life and the life to come. He who does not  learn it may not sponsor another man at baptism or at confirmation.    *Guard against grievous sins and devilish deeds and make amends  according to one's confessor's advice.    Fear God, be in terror of sin, and dread the Day of Judgment.    The bishops shall give example of our duty towards God.            Secular laws of Canute are:    All men, both rich and poor, shall be entitled to the benefit of the  law, and just decisions shall be pronounced on their behalf.    Those in authority to give judgment shall consider very earnestly \"And  forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us.\"  Christian people shall not be condemned to death for trivial offenses.    We forbid the all too prevalent practice of selling Christian people  out of the country, especially into heathen lands. Care shall be taken  that the souls which Christ bought with his own life be not destroyed.    *Any wizards or sorcerers, those who secretly compass death,  prostitutes, thieves, and robbers shall be destroyed unless they cease  and make amends.    We forbid heathen practices, namely the worship of idols, heathen gods,  and the sun or moon, fire or water, springs or stones or any kind of  forest trees, or indulgence in witchcraft or the compassing of death in  any way, either by sacrifice or by divinations or by the practice of  any such delusions.    *Murderers and perjurers, injurers of the clergy, and adulterers shall  submit and make amends or depart with their sins from their native land.    *Hypocrites and liars, robbers and plunderers shall incur the wrath of  God, unless they desist and make amends.    *There shall be one currency free from all adulteration throughout the  land and no one shall refuse it. He who coins false money shall forfeit  the hand with which he made it, and he shall not redeem it in any way,  either with gold or silver. If the reeve is accused of having granted  his permission to the man who coined the false money, he shall clear  himself by the triple oath of exculpation and, if it fails, he shall  have the same sentence as the man who coined the false money.    *Measures and weights shall be diligently corrected and an end put to  all unjust practices.    The repair of fortifications and bridges, and the preparation of ships  and the equipment of military forces shall be diligently undertaken for  the common need, whenever the occasion arises.    *In Wessex and Mercia, the king is entitled to payments for violation  of his mund, attacks on people's houses, assault, and neglecting  military service. In the Danelaw, he is entitled to payments for  fighting, breach of the peace and attacks on people's houses, and  neglect of military service.    *If anyone does the deed of an outlaw, the king alone shall have power  to grant him security. He shall forfeit all his land to the king  without regard to whose vassal he is. Whoever feeds or harbours the  fugitive shall pay 5 pounds to the king, unless he clears himself by a  declaration that he did not know that he was a fugitive.    *He who promotes injustice or pronounces unjust judgments, as a result  of malice or bribery, shall forfeit 120s. to the king, in districts  under English law, unless he declares on oath that he did not know how  to give a more just verdict, and he shall lose forever his rank as a  thegn, unless he redeem it from the king, provided the latter is  willing to allow him to do so. In the Danelaw he shall forfeit his  lahslit.    *He who refuses to observe just laws and judgments shall forfeit, in  districts under English law, a fine to the party entitled thereto -  either 120s. to the king, 60s. to the earl, or 30s. to the hundred, or  to all of them if they were all concerned.    *If a man seeks to accuse another man falsely in such a way as to  injure him in property or in reputation, and if the latter can refute  the accusation brought against him, the first shall forfeit his tongue,  unless he redeems himself with his wergeld.    No one shall appeal to the king, unless he fails to obtain justice  within his hundred. Everyone shall attend the hundred court, under pain  of fine, whenever he is required by law to attend it.    The borough court shall be held at least three times and the shire  court at least twice, under pain of fine. The bishop of the diocese and  the earldorman shall attend and they shall direct the administration of  both ecclesiastical and secular law.    *No one shall make distraint [seizure of personal property out of the  possession of an alleged wrongdoer into the custody of the party  injured, to procure a satisfaction for a wrong committed] of property  either within the shire or outside it, until he has appealed for  justice three times in the hundred court. If on the third occasion he  does not obtain justice, he shall go on the fourth occasion to the  shire court, and the shire court shall appoint a day when he shall  issue his summons for the fourth time. And if this summons fails, he  shall get leave from the one court or the other, to take his own  measures for the recovery of his"]]]
