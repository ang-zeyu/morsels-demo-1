Healthy hen-hatched chicks raised by the natural  method on a farm need nothing but one soft feed (such as has been  mentioned) in the morning, a little hard grain toward evening, and then,  just before dark, all the soft food they will eat. The best grain for  them is sound cracked corn; the next best is wheat. The chickens should  have good water always before them, and may be given all the milk they  want. Skim milk, sour milk (either thin or clabbered), and buttermilk  are all eaten with relish and promote health and growth. Vessels in  which milk is given must be cleaned often or they will become very  filthy.    [Illustration: Fig. 95. Coops and runs for hens and chicks[11]]    [11] Burlap bags are used to shade the interior or to keep out rain.  When not in use they are turned back on the top of the coop.    =Management of growing chicks.= Of course, healthy chickens are growing  all the time, and growing at a very rapid rate, too; but after the  chicks are weaned, they have usually reached the point in growth when  the increase in size in a short period is very noticeable. So poultry  keepers commonly speak of chickens from weaning time until maturity as  growing chicks. At this time the rudest kind of shelter will suit them  as well as any. Indeed, they hardly need shelter from the weather at  all. The most essential things are a good range, apart from the old  fowls, and an abundance of food. They should be able to pick up a great  deal of food for themselves, but should have enough given them to make  sure that they always have all the food they can eat. It does not pay to  stint them to make them forage farther. Young chickens will always take  all the exercise that they need if they have the opportunity, and the  more they eat the better they grow.    [Illustration: Fig. 96. Small house for growing chicks, in Maine  orchard]    [Illustration: Fig. 97. Small house for growing chicks, in orchard in  New York State]    When the range near their coops ceases to afford them good picking, the  coops should be moved to a place where the food to be secured by  foraging is more abundant.      LARGE STOCKS ON GENERAL FARMS    When farmers in America began to keep larger stocks of fowls, the most  common practice nearly everywhere was to increase the general flock  until there were far too many fowls on the land that they would usually  forage over. Under such conditions fowls on the farm were not  profitable. They damaged every crop to which they had access, and made  the farm most unsightly in the vicinity of the dwelling house. Then some  farmers would reduce the flock and return to the old practice of keeping  only a few dozen hens, while others would adopt the city plan of  building houses with many compartments and keeping the fowls yarded in  small flocks. This plan was usually abandoned within a few years,  because, while it worked very well in the winter, when the farmer had  time to give the hens extra care, they were not as well off in the  summer, when the farmer had to give attention to his field crops first.  Such was the usual course of development of farm methods of managing  fowls.    [Illustration: Fig. 98. Stone poultry house about two hundred years old,  on farm of F. W. C. Almy, Tiverton Four Corners, Rhode Island]    [Illustration: Fig. 99. Rhode Island colony poultry house for  thirty-five fowls]    [Illustration: Fig. 100. Colony poultry houses on Rhode Island farm]    =The colony system.= But occasionally a farmer whose flock had outgrown  its accommodations as one flock would divide it, moving a part to  another place on the farm, and so was able to maintain the increase in  numbers without adopting laborious methods. This idea was carried out  most systematically and most extensively in the vicinity of Little  Compton, Rhode Island, where the Rhode Island Red fowl originated. The  first settlers in this part of Rhode Island built large stone poultry  houses like that shown in Fig. 98. Some of these old buildings are still  used for poultry. This district is most favorably situated for poultry  keeping. The snow rarely lies long, and the birds can be outdoors nearly  every day in winter as well as in summer. Being near the fashionable  summer resort of Newport, the farmers here early found a large demand  for their eggs and poultry at high prices in the summer time, when in  many places the prices were low. Then in the winter they could send eggs  to Boston and Providence, which were the best markets in the country for  this class of produce. So these farmers had every inducement to devise a  practical method of indefinitely increasing their stocks of fowls. The  plan which they adopted was very simple. Small houses, which could  easily be moved from place to place with a two-horse team, and which  would accommodate from twenty-five to thirty-five fowls, were made and  distributed over the farm. Sometimes these houses were placed in  pastures not suitable for mowing or for cultivation and remained there  permanently, but as a rule they were moved from time to time to suit the  rotation of crops on the farm. As the number of these houses on a farm  increased, and they were spread over a larger area and sometimes placed  in fields and pastures a long distance from the farmhouse, the work of  caring for the fowls, even by the simple method used, became too heavy  to be done by man power alone, and a horse and cart was used in carrying  food and water, collecting eggs, and moving chicks and fowls from one  part of the farm to another. Thus the work was put on a very economical  basis, and keeping fowls by this method became a common feature of the  farming of this section of Rhode Island. The methods used here have  changed little, if at all, since the system was started sixty or seventy  years ago. The system is so primitive that people who are familiar with  more elaborate methods often imagine that the Rhode Island farmer, who  does so well by his simple methods, would certainly do very much better  if he applied more of the modern ideas. But the test of time has  demonstrated that this simple colony system is easily made permanent,  while most of the more ambitious and complex systems either fail utterly  or have but a transient success.    [Illustration: Fig. 101. Collecting eggs on Rhode Island farm. The  little girl is in the box in which dough is carried in the morning]    =Numbers of hens kept.= The number of hens kept on a farm in this  section varies from four or five hundred to over two thousand. Stocks of  from eight hundred to twelve hundred are most common. The principal  object is to produce market eggs, but as the two-year-old hens and the  cockerels that are not needed for breeding purposes are sold every year,  the receipts from the sale of live poultry are sometimes considerable.    [Illustration: Fig. 102. Colony houses at Michigan Agricultural College.  (Photograph from the college)]    =Feeding, care, and results.= The hens, being well distributed over the  farm, pick a large part of their living. Hard grain (usually cracked  corn) is kept always before them in the house, in hoppers which will  hold a bag of grain each. Once a day, in the morning, the hens are given  a feed of mash (or, as it is called in this locality, dough) of about  the same composition as the mash described on page 89. The dough is  cooked in a large iron set-kettle in the evening and left there until it  is to be fed the next morning. Then it is loaded into boxes or large  tubs on a cart. The cart also carries a barrel of water. As he reaches  each house the driver, with a shovel, throws what dough the hens need on  the grass near the house. Then he fills the water pail and drives on to  the next house. The hens require no more attention until evening, when  the man collects the eggs and gives more water where it is necessary.    [Illustration: Fig. 103. Moving one of the houses in Fig. 102]    [Illustration: Fig. 104. Colony houses at Iowa Agricultural College.  (Photograph from the college)]    Some of the smaller stocks of fowls on these farms--flocks that have  been selected with care and are given a little more attention than is  usual--give an average annual production of eleven or twelve dozen eggs  a hen, but the general average is only eight or nine dozen. Although the  profit per hen is small, the compensation for labor and investment is  better than on most poultry plants where a much greater product per hen  is secured. Even when eggs are the most important money crop on the  farm, the care of the laying hens is but a small part of the day's work  of the man who looks after them.    [Illustration: Fig. 105. Colony houses at Hampton Institute]    =How the chickens are grown.= The number of chickens reared each year on  one of these colony farms is usually about equal to the number of fowls  kept. Where there are so many hens of a sitting variety, and very early  hatching is not practiced, there is rarely any shortage of sitting hens  at the time when they are wanted. Usually twenty or thirty hens are set  at the same time, and it is expected that they will hatch eight or ten  chickens each. Sometimes sixty or seventy hens are set at one time. As  it is almost always quite warm when the chickens are hatched, it is  customary to give each hen twenty or more chickens. The coops are placed  in rows, several rods apart each way, on a piece of grassland that has  had no poultry on it for a year or more. Most of the farmers are very  particular on this point, and prefer to put the young chickens on land  on which there has been no poultry for at least two years. They have  learned by experience that under such conditions they can rear a much  larger percentage of the chickens hatched, and that the chickens will  grow more evenly and mature earlier.

This custom, of  which I have seen few remnants in Italy, has been long preserved in the  Greek church. At length, by degrees, artists began to paint upon one  whole panel. (_See Buonarroti Vetri Antichi_, p. 258, &c.)]    [Footnote 58: In Torrello, one of the Venetian isles, there is an  ancient image of St. Hadrian, which is tolerably carved, and around it  the history of the saint is depicted: the style is feeble, but not  Grecian.]    [Footnote 59: I notice this peculiarity, because the histories, either  painted or engraved, belonging to those early times, are apt to perplex  us; nor can they be cleared up without having recourse to books of  fiction, which were, in those less civilized periods, believed.

EPOCH I.      _Florentine Painters who lived after Giotto to the end of    the fifteenth century._      SECT. II.      It is worthy of remark, that Vasari, in the life of Jacopo di Casentino,  quotes the manuscript records of the society of St. Luke, afterwards  printed by Baldinucci, and mentions fourteen painters who were formerly  its captains, counsellors, or chamberlains; yet he takes no notice of  them in his _Lives_, and of but very few of the great number named in  that manuscript. The same selection was employed by Baldinucci, in whose  VEGLIA we are informed that many painters flourished about 1300, the  names of whom he has refused to insert in his anecdotes. It clearly  appears from his writings that he omitted about a hundred, all belonging  to that age.[61] It is therefore incorrect to say, that those two  historians have commemorated many artists of mediocrity, merely because  they were natives of Florence, an accusation alleged against them by  foreigners. The artists of their country whom they have transmitted to  posterity, are not less worthy of record than those ancient ones of  Venice, of Bologna, and of Lombardy, whom we are accustomed to praise in  their respective schools. Among this number I include Buffalmacco, the  wit whose jests, as recorded in Boccaccio and Sacchetti, render him more  celebrated than his pictures. His real name was Buonamico di Cristofano.  He had been the scholar of Tafi, but by living long in the time of  Giotto, he had an opportunity of correcting his own style. He displayed  a most lively fancy, \"and when he chose to exert himself (which rarely  happened) was not inferior to any of his contemporaries.\"[62] It is  unfortunate that his best works, which were in the Abbey and in  Ognisanti, have perished, and there only remain some less carefully  executed at Arezzo and at Pisa. The best preserved are in the Campo  Santo; viz. the Creation of the World, in which there is a figure of the  Deity, five cubits high, sustaining the mighty frame of the heavens and  the elements, and three other historical pictures of Adam, of his  children, and of Noah. A crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of the  Redeemer, may be seen at the same place. Good symmetry is not to be  looked for in them; he knew but little of design, and he drew his  figures by other rules than the roundness and facility seen in the  disciples of Giotto. His heads are deficient in beauty and variety. The  pious women near the cross all have the same mean and vulgar features,  in which the mouths are opened even to deformity. Some of the heads of  the men, especially that of Cain, possess, however, a physiognomical  expression which arrests the eye of the spectator. The air of nature too  in the action, as in the man, who, full of horror, flies from Mount  Calvary, is highly praiseworthy. His draperies are greatly varied, are  distinguished by the difference of stuffs and linings, and are  laboriously ornamented with flowers and with fringes. Before he was  employed in the Campo Santo, he painted in the church of St. Paul, Ripa  d'Arno, where he was associated with one Bruno di Giovanni, formerly his  fellow student, and believed to be the painter of a St. Ursula in a  piece which still exists in the Commenda. Unable to attain the  expression of Buffalmacco, he tried to atone for the defect by the aid  of sentences proceeding from the mouths of his figures, which expressed  what their features and attitudes were incapable of explaining, a  practice in which he was preceded by Cimabue, and followed by the  eccentric Orcagna and several others. This Bruno, together with Nello di  Dino, was associated with Buffalmacco in the jests contrived for the  simple Calandrino. They all owe their fame to Boccaccio, who introduces  them in the eighth day of his Decamerone; and a similar favour was  conferred by Sacchetti on a Bartolo Gioggi, a house-painter, whom he  introduced into his one hundred and seventieth tale. Giovanni da Ponte,  the scholar of Buffalmacco, had some merit, but he was not at all  solicitous to increase it by his diligence. Some remains of his pictures  exist on the walls of the church of St. Francis, at Arezzo.    I believe that Bernardo Orcagna, who rivalled the fame of Buffalmacco,  proceeded from some old school. He was the son of one Cione, a sculptor,  and his brother Jacopo was of the same profession: but the other  brother, Andrea, surpassed them all; and in himself so far united the  attainments of the three sister arts, that he was by some reckoned  second only to Giotto. He is known among architects for having  introduced the circular arch instead of the acute, as may be seen in the  gallery of the Lanzi, which he built and ornamented with sculpture.  Bernardo taught him the principles of painting. They who have  represented him as the pupil of Angiol Gaddi, do not appear attentive to  dates. In the Strozzi chapel in the church of S. Maria Novella, he and  Bernardo painted Paradise, and over against it the Infernal Regions; and  in the Campo Santo of Pisa, Death and the Judgment were executed by  Andrea, and Hell by Bernardo. The two brothers imitated Dante in the  novel representations which they executed at those places; and that  style was more happily repeated by Andrea in the church of Santa Croce,  where he inserted portraits of his enemies among the damned, and of his  friends among the blessed spirits. These pictures are the prototypes of  similar pictures preserved in S. Petronio, at Bologna, in the cathedral  of Tolentino, in the Badia del Sesto, at Friuli,[63] and some other  places, in which hell is distinguished by abysses and a variety of  torments, after the manner of Dante. Several pictures by Andrea remain,  and his name is still on that in the Strozzi chapel, which is full of  figures and of episodes. On the whole, he discovers fertility of  imagination, diligence, and spirit, equal to any of his contemporaries.  In composition he was less judicious, in attitudes less exact, than the  followers of Giotto; and he yields to them in drawing and in colouring.    The same school produced Marinotto, a nephew of Andrea, and a Tommaso di  Marco, whom I pass over, as well as others of little note, no longer  known by existing works. Bernardo Nello di Gio. Falconi of Pisa merits  consideration. He executed many pictures in that cathedral, and is  supposed to be the same with that Nello di Vanni, who, with other Pisan  artists, painted in the Campo Santo in the fourteenth century. Francesco  Traini, a Florentine, is known as much superior to his master, by a  large picture which is in the church of S. Catherine of Pisa, in which  he has represented St. Thomas Aquinas in his own form, and also in his  beatification. He stands in the middle of the picture, under the  Redeemer, who sheds a glory on the Evangelists and him; and from them  the rays are scattered on a crowd of listeners, composed of clergy,  doctors, bishops, cardinals, and popes. Arius and other innovators are  at the feet of the saint, as if vanquished by his doctrine; and near him  appear Plato and Aristotle, with their volumes open, a circumstance not  to be commended in such a subject. This work exhibits no skill in  grouping, no knowledge of relief, and it abounds in attitudes which are  either too tame, or too constrained; and yet it pleases by a marked  expression in the countenances, an air of the antique in the draperies,  and a certain novelty in the composition. Let us now pass on to the  followers of Giotto.    The scholars of Giotto have fallen into an error common to the followers  of all illustrious men; in"]]]
