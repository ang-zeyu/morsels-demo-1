He grumbles an' growls in his  soft voice all day, an' hates himself an' everybody else. But I  don't see much of him. There's so many of us slaves here that Zog  don't pay much attention to us, an' we have a pretty good time when  the ol' magician is shut up in his den, as he mostly is.\"    \"Could you help us to escape?\" asked the child.    \"Why, I don't know how,\" admitted Cap'n Joe. \"There's magic all  around us, and we slaves are never allowed to leave this great cave.  I'll do what I can, o' course, but Sacho is the boy to help you if  anyone can. That little chap knows a heap, I can tell you. So now,  if nothin' more's wanted, I must get back to work.\"    \"What work do you do?\" Cap'n Bill asked.    \"I sew buttons on Zog's clothes. Every time he gets mad, he busts  his buttons off, an' I have to sew 'em on again. As he's mad most o'  the time, it keeps me busy.\"    \"I'll see you again, won't I, Joe?\" said Cap'n Bill.    \"No reason why you shouldn't, if you manage to keep alive,\" said  Cap'n Joe. \"But you mustn't forget, Bill, this Zog has his grip on  you, an' I've never known anything to escape him yet.\"    Saying this, the old sailor began to stump toward the door, but  tripped his foot against his wooden leg and gave a swift dive  forward. He would have fallen flat had he not grabbed the drapery at  the doorway and saved himself by holding fast to it with both hands.  Even then he rolled and twisted so awkwardly before he could get  upon his legs that Trot had to laugh outright at his antics. \"This  hick'ry leg,\" said Cap'n Joe, \"is so blamed light that it always  wants to float. Agga-Groo, the goldworker, has promised me a gold  leg that will stay down, but he never has time to make it. You're  mighty lucky, Bill, to have a merman's tail instead o' legs.\"    \"I guess I am, Joe,\" replied Cap'n Bill, \"for in such a wet country  the fishes have the best of it. But I ain't sure I'd like this sort  o' thing always.\"    \"Think o' the money you'd make in a side show,\" said Cap'n Joe with  his funny chuckling laugh. Then he pounded his wooden leg against  the hard floor and managed to hobble from the room without more  accidents.    When he had gone, Trot said, \"Aren't you glad to find your brother  again, Cap'n Bill?\"    \"Why, so-so,\" replied the sailor. \"I don't know much about Joe,  seein' as we haven't met before for many a long year, an' all I  remember about our boyhood days is that we fit an' pulled hair most  o' the time. But what worries me most is Joe's lookin' so much like  me myself, wooden leg an' all. Don't you think it's rather cheeky  an' unbrotherly, Trot?\"    \"Perhaps he can't help it,\" suggested the child. \"And anyhow, he'll  never be able to live on land again.\"    \"No,\" said Cap'n Bill with a sigh. \"Joe's a fish, now, an' so he  ain't likely to be took for me by one of our friends on the earth.\"          CHAPTER 15    THE MAGIC OF THE MERMAIDS      When Trot and Cap'n Bill entered the Rose Chamber they found the two  mermaids reclining before an air fountain that was sending thousands  of tiny bubbles up through the water.    \"These fountains of air are excellent things,\" remarked Queen  Aquareine, \"for they keep the water fresh and sweet, and that is the  more necessary when it is confined by walls, as it is in this  castle. But now, let us counsel together and decide what to do in  the emergency that confronts us.\"    \"How can we tell what to do without knowing what's going to happen?\"  asked Trot.    \"Somethin's sure to happen,\" said Cap'n Bill.    As if to prove his words, a gong suddenly sounded at their door and  in walked a fat little man clothed all in white, including a white  apron and white cap. His face was round and jolly, and he had a big  mustache that curled up at the ends.    \"Well, well!\" said the little man, spreading out his legs and  putting his hands on his hips as he stood looking at them. \"Of all  the queer things in the sea, you're the queerest! Mermaids, eh?\"    \"Don't bunch us that way!\" protested Cap'n Bill.    \"You are quite wrong,\" said Trot. \"I'm a--a girl.\"    \"With a fish's tail?\" he asked, laughing at her.    \"That's only just for a while,\" she said, \"while I'm in the water,  you know. When I'm at home on the land I walk just as you do, an' so  does Cap'n Bill.\"    \"But we haven't any gills,\" remarked the Cap'n, looking closely at  the little man's throat, \"so I take it we're not as fishy as some  others.\"    \"If you mean me, I must admit you are right,\" said the little man,  twisting his mustache. \"I'm as near a fish as a man can be. But you  see, Cap'n, without the gills that make me a fish, I could not live  under water.\"    \"When it comes to that, you've no business to live under water,\"  asserted the sailor. \"But I s'pose you're a slave and can't help  it.\"    \"I'm chief cook for that old horror Zog. And that reminds me, good  mermaids, or good people, or good girls and sailors, or whatever you  are, that I'm sent here to ask what you'd like to eat.\"    \"Good to see you, sir,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"I'm nearly starved,  myself.\"    \"I had it in mind,\" said the little man, \"to prepare a regular  mermaid dinner, but since you're not mermaids--\"    \"Oh, two of us are,\" said the Queen, smiling. \"I, my good cook, am  Aquareine, the ruler of the mermaids, and this is the Princess  Clia.\"    \"I've often heard of you, your Majesty,\" returned the chief cook,  bowing respectfully, \"and I must say I've heard only good of you.  Now that you have unfortunately become my master's prisoners, it  will give me pleasure to serve you as well as I am able.\"    \"We thank you, good sir,\" said Aquareine.    \"What have you got to eat?\" inquired Trot. \"Seems to me I'm hollow  way down to my toes--my tail, I mean--and it'll take a lot to fill  me up. We haven't eaten a morsel since breakfast, you know.\"    \"I think I shall be able to give you almost anything you would  like,\" said the cook. \"Zog is a wonderful magician and can procure  anything that exists with no more effort than a wiggle of his thumb.  But some eatables, you know, are hard to serve under water, because  they get so damp that they are soon ruined.\"    \"Ah, it is different with the mermaids,\" said Princess Clia.    \"Yes, all your things are kept dry because they are surrounded by  air. I've heard how the mermaids live. But here it is different.\"    \"Take this ring,\" said the Queen, handing the chief cook a circlet  which she drew from her finger. \"While it is in your possession, the  food you prepare will not get wet, or even moist.\"    \"I thank your Majesty,\" returned the cook, taking the ring. \"My name  is Tom Atto, and I'll do my best to please you. How would you like  for luncheon some oysters on the half-shell, clam broth, shrimp  salad, broiled turtle steak and watermelon?\"    \"That will do very nicely,\" answered the Queen.    \"Do watermelons grow in the sea?\" asked Trot.    \"Of course, that is why they are called watermelons,\" replied Tom  Atto. \"I think I shall serve you a water ice, in addition to the  rest. Water ice is an appropriate sea food.\"    \"Have some watercress with the salad,\" said Cap'n Bill.    \"I'd thought of that,\" declared the cook. \"Doesn't my bill of fare  make your mouths water?\"    \"Hurry up and get it ready,\" suggested Trot.    Tom Atto at once bowed and retired, and when they were done, Cap'n  Bill said to the queen, \"Do you think, ma'am, we can manage to  escape from Zog and his castle?\"    \"I hope we shall find a way,\" replied Aquareine. \"The evil powers of  magic which Zog controls may not prove to be as strong as the fairy  powers I possess, but of course I cannot be positive until I  discover what this wicked magician is able to do.\"    Princess Clia was looking out of one of the windows. \"I think I can  see an opening far up in the top of the dome,\" she said. They all  hastened to the windows to look, and although Trot and Cap'n Bill  could see nothing but a solid dome above the castle--perhaps because  it was so far away from them--the sharp eyes of Aquareine were not  to be deceived.    \"Yes,\" she announced, \"there is surely an opening in the center of  the great dome. A little thought must convince us that such an  opening is bound to exist, for otherwise the water confined within  the dome would not be fresh or clear.\"    \"Then if we could escape from this castle, we could swim up to the  hole in the dome and get free!\" exclaimed Trot.    \"Why, Zog has probably ordered the opening well guarded, as he has  all the other outlets,\" responded the Queen. \"Yet it may be worth  while for us to make the attempt to get back into the broad ocean  this way. The night would be the best time, when all are asleep, and  surely it will be quicker to reach the ocean through this hole in  the roof than by means of the long, winding passages by which we  entered.\"    \"But we will have to break out of the castle in some way,\" observed  Cap'n Bill.    \"That will not be difficult,\" answered Aquareine. \"It will be no  trouble for me to shatter one of these panes of glass, allowing us  to pass out and swim straight up to the top of the dome.\"    \"Let's do it now!\" said Trot eagerly.    \"No, my dear, we must wait for a good opportunity when we are not  watched closely. We do not wish the terrible Zog to thwart our  plan,\" answered the Queen gently.    Presently two sailor boys entered bearing trays of food, which they  placed upon a large table. They were cheery-faced young fellows with  gills at their throats, but had laughing eyes, and Trot was  astonished not to find any of the slaves of Zog weeping or  miserable. Instead, they were as jolly and good-natured as could be  and seemed to like their life under the water. Cap'n Bill asked one  of the boys "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/436"],[0,"The Master Key (#17)"],[1,"upwards until the islands of Japan were mere specks visible  through the clear, sunny atmosphere.    Then he began his eastward flight, the broad surface of the Pacific  seeming like a blue cloud far beneath him.          16.  Shipwrecked Mariners      Ample proof of Rob's careless and restless nature having been frankly  placed before the reader in these pages, you will doubtless be  surprised when I relate that during the next few hours our young  gentleman suffered from a severe attack of homesickness, becoming as  gloomy and unhappy in its duration as ever a homesick boy could be.    It may have been because he was just then cut off from all his  fellow-creatures and even from the world itself; it may have been  because he was satiated with marvels and with the almost absolute  control over the powers which the Demon had conferred upon him; or it  may have been because he was born and reared a hearty, healthy American  boy, with a disposition to battle openly with the world and take his  chances equally with his fellows, rather than be placed in such an  exclusive position that no one could hope successfully to oppose him.    Perhaps he himself did not know what gave him this horrible attack of  \"the blues,\" but the truth is he took out his handkerchief and cried  like a baby from very loneliness and misery.    There was no one to see him, thank goodness! and the tears gave him  considerable relief.  He dried his eyes, made an honest struggle to  regain his cheerfulness, and then muttered to himself:    \"If I stay up here, like an air-bubble in the sky, I shall certainly go  crazy.  I suppose there's nothing but water to look at down below, but  if I could only sight a ship, or even see a fish jump, it would do me  no end of good.\"    Thereupon he descended until, as the ocean's surface same nearer and  nearer, he discovered a tiny island lying almost directly underneath  him.  It was hardly big enough to make a dot on the biggest map, but a  clump of trees grew in the central portion, while around the edges were  jagged rocks protecting a sandy beach and a stretch of flower-strewn  upland leading to the trees.    It looked beautiful from Rob's elevated position, and his spirits  brightened at once.    \"I'll drop down and pick a bouquet,\" he exclaimed, and a few moments  later his feet touched the firm earth of the island.    But before he could gather a dozen of the brilliant flowers a glad  shout reached his ears, and, looking up, he saw two men running towards  him from the trees.    They were dressed in sailor fashion, but their clothing was reduced to  rags and scarcely clung to their brown, skinny bodies.  As they  advanced they waved their arms wildly in the air and cried in joyful  tones:    \"A boat! a boat!\"    Rob stared at them wonderingly, and had much ado to prevent the poor  fellows from hugging him outright, so great was their joy at his  appearance.  One of them rolled upon the ground, laughing and crying by  turns, while the other danced and cut capers until he became so  exhausted that he sank down breathless beside his comrade.    \"How came you here?\" then inquired the boy, in pitying tones.    \"We're shipwrecked American sailors from the bark 'Cynthia Jane,' which  went down near here over a month ago,\" answered the smallest and  thinnest of the two.  \"We escaped by clinging to a bit of wreckage and  floated to this island, where we have nearly starved to death.  Indeed,  we now have eaten everything on the island that was eatable, and had  your boat arrived a few days later you'd have found us lying dead upon  the beach!\"    Rob listened to this sad tale with real sympathy.    \"But I didn't come here in a boat,\" said he.    The men sprang to their feet with white, scared faces.    \"No boat!\" they cried; \"are you, too, shipwrecked?\"    \"No;\" he answered.  \"I flew here through the air.\"  And then he  explained to them the wonderful electric traveling machine.    But the sailors had no interest whatever in the relation.  Their  disappointment was something awful to witness, and one of them laid his  head upon his comrade's shoulder and wept with unrestrained grief, so  weak and discouraged had they become through suffering.    Suddenly Rob remembered that he could assist them, and took the box of  concentrated food tablets from his pocket.    \"Eat these,\" he said, offering one of each to the sailors.    At first they could not understand that these small tablets would be  able to allay the pangs of hunger; but when Rob explained their virtues  the men ate them greedily.  Within a few moments they were so greatly  restored to strength and courage that their eyes brightened, their  sunken cheeks flushed, and they were able to converse with their  benefactor with calmness and intelligence.    Then the boy sat beside them upon the grass and told them the story of  his acquaintance with the Demon and of all his adventures since he had  come into possession of the wonderful electric contrivances.  In his  present mood he felt it would be a relief to confide in some one, and  so these poor, lonely men were the first to hear his story.    When he related the manner in which he had clung to the Turk while both  ascended into the air, the elder of the two sailors listened with rapt  attention, and then, after some thought, asked:    \"Why couldn't you carry one or both of us to America?\"    Rob took time seriously to consider this idea, while the sailors eyed  him with eager interest.  Finally he said:    \"I'm afraid I couldn't support your weight long enough to reach any  other land.  It's a long journey, and you'd pull my arms out of joint  before we'd been up an hour.\"    Their faces fell at this, but one of them said:    \"Why couldn't we swing ourselves over your shoulders with a rope?  Our  two bodies would balance each other and we are so thin and emaciated  that we do not weigh very much.\"    While considering this suggestion Rob remembered how at one time five  pirates had clung to his left leg and been carried some distance  through the air.    \"Have you a rope?\" he asked.    \"No,\" was the answer; \"but there are plenty of long, tough vines  growing on the island that are just as strong and pliable as ropes.\"    \"Then, if you are willing to run the chances,\" decided the boy, \"I will  make the attempt to save you.  But I must warn you that in case I find  I can not support the weight of your bodies I shall drop one or both of  you into the sea.\"    They looked grave at this prospect, but the biggest one said:    \"We would soon meet death from starvation if you left us here on the  island; so, as there is at least a chance of our being able to escape  in your company I, for one, am willing to risk being drowned.  It is  easier and quicker than being starved.  And, as I'm the heavier, I  suppose you'll drop me first.\"    \"Certainly,\" declared Rob, promptly.    This announcement seemed to be an encouragement to the little sailor,  but he said, nervously:    \"I hope you'll keep near the water, for I haven't a good head for  heights--they always make me dizzy.\"    \"Oh, if you don't want to go,\" began Rob, \"I can easily--\"    \"But I do! I do! I do!\" cried the little man, interrupting him.  \"I  shall die if you leave me behind!\"    \"Well, then, get your ropes, and we'll do the best we can,\" said the  boy.    They ran to the trees, around the trunks of which were clinging many  tendrils of greenish-brown vine which possessed remarkable strength.  With their knives they cut a long section of this vine, the ends of  which were then tied into loops large enough to permit the sailors to  sit in them comfortably.  The connecting piece Rob padded with seaweed  gathered from the shore, to prevent its cutting into his shoulders.    \"Now, then,\" he said, when all was ready, \"take your places.\"    The sailors squatted in the loops, and Rob swung the vine over his  shoulders and turned the indicator of the traveling machine to \"up.\"    As they slowly mounted into the sky the little sailor gave a squeal of  terror and clung to the boy's arm; but the other, although seemingly  anxious, sat quietly in his place and made no trouble.    \"D--d--don't g--g--go so high!\" stammered the little one, tremblingly;  \"suppose we should f--f--fall!\"    \"Well, s'pose we should?\" answered Rob, gruffly.  \"You couldn't drown  until you struck the water, so the higher we are the longer you'll live  in case of accident.\"    This phase of the question seemed to comfort the frightened fellow  somewhat; but, as he said, he had not a good head for heights, and so  continued to tremble in spite of his resolve to be brave.    The weight on Rob's shoulders was not so great as he had feared, the  traveling machine seeming to give a certain lightness and buoyancy to  everything that came into contact with its wearer.    As soon as he had reached a sufficient elevation to admit of good speed  he turned the indicator once more to the east and began moving rapidly  through the air, the shipwrecked sailors dangling at either side.    \"This is aw--aw--awful!\" gasped the little one.    \"Say, you shut up!\" commanded the boy, angrily.  \"If your friend was as  big a coward as you are I'd drop you both this minute.  Let go my arm  and keep quiet, if you want to reach land alive.\"    The fellow whimpered a little, but managed to remain silent for several  minutes.  Then he gave a sudden twitch and grabbed Rob's arm again.    \"S'pose--s'pose the vine should break!\" he moaned, a horrified look  upon his face.    \"I've had about enough of this,\" said Rob, savagely.  \"If you haven't  any sense you don't deserve to live.\"  He turned the indicator on the  dial of the machine and they began to descend rapidly.    The little fellow screamed with fear, but Rob paid no attention to him  until the feet of the two suspended sailors were actually dipping into  the waves, when he brought their progress to an abrupt halt.    \"Wh--wh--what are you g--g--going to"]]]
