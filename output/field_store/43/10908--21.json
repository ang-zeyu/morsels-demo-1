In them against this  color are set the scarlet and gold of every tree upon their brinks, the  painted hills, the clear-cut mountain peaks, all downward pointing to  the depths of this nether sky.    Overhead, thistledown and the silken balloon of the milkweed float on  their zephyr-wafted course, silver motes against the blue; and above  them are the black cohorts of crows in their straggling retreat to  softer climes. Now the dark column moves steadily onward, now veers in  confusion from some suspected or discovered danger, or pauses to assail  with a harsh clangor some sworn enemy of the sable brotherhood. Their  gay-clad smaller cousins, the jays, are for the most part silently  industrious among the gold and bronze of the beeches, flitting to and  fro with flashes of blue as they gather mast, but now and then finding  time to scold an intruder with an endless variety of discordant outcry.    How sharp the dark shadows are cut against the sunlit fields, and in  their gloom how brightly shine the first fallen leaves and the starry  bloom of the asters. In cloudy days and even when rain is falling the  depths of the woods are not dark, for the bright foliage seems to give  forth light and casts no shadows beneath the lowering sky.    The scarlet maples burn, the golden leaves of poplar and birch shine  through the misty veil, and the deep purple of the ash glows as if it  held a smouldering fire that the first breeze might fan into a flame,  and through all this luminous leafage one may trace branch and twig as a  wick in a candle flame. Only the evergreens are dark as when they bear  their steadfast green in the desolation of winter, and only they brood  shadows.    In such weather the woodland air is laden with the light burden of odor,  the faintly pungent aroma of the ripened leaves, more subtle than the  scent of pine or fir, yet as apparent to the nostrils, as delightful and  more rare, for in the round of the year its days are few, while in  summer sunshine and winter wind, in springtime shower and autumnal  frost, pine, spruce, balsam, hemlock, and cedar distill their perfume  and lavish it on the breeze or gale of every season.    Out of the marshes, now changing their universal green to brown and  bronze and gold, floats a finer odor than their common reek of ooze and  sodden weeds--a spicy tang of frost-ripened flags and the fainter breath  of the landward border of ferns; and with these also is mingled the  subtle pungency of the woodlands, where the pepperidge is burning out in  a blaze of scarlet, and the yellow flame of the poplars flickers in the  lightest breeze.    The air is of a temper neither too hot nor too cold, and in what is now  rather the good gay wood than green wood, there are no longer pestering  insects to worry the flesh and trouble the spirit. The flies bask in  half torpid indolence, the tormenting whine of the mosquito is heard no  more. Of insect life one hears little but the mellow drone of the  bumblebee, the noontide chirp of the cricket, and the husky rustle of  the dragonfly's gauzy wing.    Unwise are the tent-dwellers who have folded their canvas and departed  to the shelter of more stable roof-trees, for these are days that should  be made the most of, days that have brought the perfected ripeness of  the year and display it in the fullness of its glory.          XXXVI    A COMMON EXPERIENCE      The keenest of the sportsman's disappointments is not a blank day, nor a  series of misses, unaccountable or too well accountable to a blundering  hand or unsteady nerves, nor adverse weather, nor gun or tackle broken  in the midst of sport, nor perversity of dogs, nor uncongeniality of  comradeship, nor yet even the sudden cold or the spell of rheumatism  that prevents his taking the field on the allotted morning.    All these may be but for a day. To-morrow may bring game again to haunts  now untenanted, restore cunning to the awkward hand, steady the nerves,  mend the broken implement, make the dogs obedient and bring pleasanter  comrades or the comfortable lonesomeness of one's own companionship, and  to-morrow or next day or next week the cold and rheumatic twinges may  have passed into the realm of bygone ills.    For a year, perhaps for many years, he has yearned for a sight of some  beloved haunt, endeared to him by old and cherished associations. He  fancies that once more among the scenes of his youthful exploits there  will return to him something of the boyish ardor, exuberance of spirit  and perfect freedom from care that made the enjoyment of those happy  hours so complete. He imagines that a draught from the old spring that  bubbles up in the shadow of the beeches or from the moss-brimmed basin  of the trout brook will rejuvenate him, at least for the moment while  its coolness lingers on his palate, as if he quaffed Ponce de Leon's  undiscovered fountain. He doubts not that in the breath of the old woods  he shall once more catch that faint, indescribable, but unforgotten  aroma, that subtle savor of wildness, that has so long eluded him,  sometimes tantalizing his nostrils with a touch, but never quite inhaled  since its pungent elixir made the young blood tingle in his veins.    He has almost come to his own again, his long-lost possession in the  sunny realm of youth. It lies just beyond the hill before him, from  whose crest he shall see the nut-tree where he shot his first squirrel,  the southing slope where the beeches hide the spring, where he  astonished himself with the glory of killing his first grouse, and he  shall see the glint of the brook flashing down the evergreen dell and  creeping among the alder copses.    He does not expect to find so many squirrels or grouse or trout now as  thirty years ago, when a double gun was a wonder, and its possession the  unrealized dream of himself and his comrades, and none of them had ever  seen jointed rod or artificial fly, and dynamite was uninvented. Yet all  the game and fish cannot have been driven from nor exterminated in  haunts so congenial and fostering as these, by the modern horde of  gunners and anglers and by the latter-day devices of destruction, and he  doubts not that he shall find enough to satisfy the tempered ardor of  the graybeard.    Indeed, it is for something better than mere shooting or fishing that he  has come so far. One squirrel, flicking the leaves with his downfall,  one grouse plunging to earth midway in his thunderous flight, one trout  caught as he can catch him, now, will appease his moderate craving for  sport, and best and most desired of all, make him, for the nonce, a boy  again. He anticipates with quicker heartbeat the thrill of surprised  delight that choked him with its fullness when he achieved his first  triumph.    At last the hilltop is gained, but what unfamiliar scene is this which  has taken the place of that so cherished in his memory and so longed  for? Can that naked hillside slanting toward him from the further rim of  the valley, forlorn in the desolation of recent clearing, be the wooded  slope of the other day? Can the poor, unpicturesque thread of water that  crawls in feeble attenuation between its shorn, unsightly banks be the  wild, free brook whose voice was a continual song, every rod of whose  amber and silver course was a picture? Even its fringes of willow and  alders, useful for their shade and cover when alive, but cut down  worthless even for fuel, have been swept from its margin by the ruthless  besom of destruction, as if everything that could beautify the landscape  must be blotted out to fulfill the mission of the spoiler.    Near it, and sucking in frequent draughts from the faint stream, is a  thirsty and hungry little sawmill, the most obtrusive and most ignoble  feature of the landscape, whose beauty its remorseless fangs have gnawed  away. Every foot of the brook below it is foul with its castings, and  the fragments of its continual greedy feasting are thickly strewn far  and near. Yet it calls to the impoverished hills for more victims; its  shriek arouses discordant echoes where once resounded the music of the  brook, the song of birds, the grouse's drum call, and the mellow note of  the hound.    Though sick at heart with the doleful scene, the returned exile descends  to his harried domain hoping that he may yet find some vestige of its  former wealth, but only more disappointments reward his quest. Not a  trout flashes through the shrunken pools. The once limpid spring is a  quagmire among rotting stumps. The rough nakedness of the hillside is  clad only with thistles and fireweed, with here and there a patch of  blanched dead leaves, dross of the old gold of the beech's ancient  autumnal glory.    Of all he hoped for nothing is realized, and he finds only woful change,  irreparable loss. His heart heavy with sorrow and bursting with impotent  wrath against the ruthless spoiler, he turns his back forever on the  desolated scene of his boyhood's sports.    Alas! That one should ever attempt to retouch the time-faded but  beautiful pictures that the memory holds.          XXXVII    THE RED SQUIRREL      A hawk, flashing the old gold of his pinions in the face of the sun,  flings down a shrill, husky cry of intense scorn; a jay scolds like a  shrew; from his safe isolation in the midwater, a loon taunts you and  the awakening winds with his wild laughter; there is a jeer in the  chuckling diminuendo of the woodchuck's whistle, a taunt in the fox's  gasping bark as he scurries unseen behind the veil of night; and a scoff  on hunters and hounds and cornfield owners is flung out through the  gloaming in the raccoon's quavering cry. But of all the wild world's  inhabitants, feathered or furred, none outdo the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36866"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 3 (of 8) (#17)"],[1,"themselves off with great rapidity to another ridge three  miles to the north. This position was located before nightfall. At  daybreak four companies of Mounted Infantry were posted on a hill two  miles north of Arundel, while a troop of Dragoons reconnoitred the town  and found it evacuated by the enemy. The advance was then resumed. At 8  A.M. the troops reached Maaiboschlaagte, and spied the enemy on the  hills near Rensburg's Farm. The Boers were busy dragging a huge gun up  the hill. Having no artillery, the flanking movement on the left was  discontinued, but the Dragoons on the right, who were three miles in  advance of the remainder of the force, crossed the plain and outflanked  the enemy. The crackling of muskets followed, and soon after the booming  of two guns. The New South Wales Lancers now reinforced the first line,  and though for many hours their \"baptism of fire\" was prolonged, they  suffered the only loss of the day--the loss of a horse. The operations  were successful, and the strength of the enemy was found to number about  2000. The occupation of this region by our troops was considered of  great strategical importance, as it formed a convenient advance base for  further operations. The town is situated some twelve miles from  Colesberg, and is in a fashion a natural fortress. It consists of rugged  hills surrounding flats, and is provided with refreshing water springs.    On the 12th of December a patrol under Lieutenant Collins was fiercely  fired upon; a sergeant of the Carabineers was killed and a private was  reported missing. This happened as they were turning away from a farm at  Jasfontein belonging to Field-Cornet Geldenhuis, with whom they had had  an interview. The proprietor received his just deserts, for later on two  squadrons of Carabineers with two guns and a company of Mounted Infantry  were sent out to shell the farm, which duty was accomplished with zest  and thoroughness. General French's report of the affair is too  interesting to be omitted. He said:--         \"I wish particularly to bring to notice the excellent conduct       and bearing of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles, commanded by       Major A. W. Robin, on one of these occasions.         \"On 18th December I took them out with a battery of Horse       Artillery to reconnoitre round the enemy's left flank, and       determined to dislodge him from a farm called Jasfontein lying       on his left rear. The guns shelled the farm, and the New       Zealand Mounted Rifles then gained possession of it. But the       enemy very suddenly brought up strong reinforcements and       pressed on us with his Artillery. Our Artillery had been left       some way behind to avoid this latter fire, and I had to send       back some distance for its support, during which time we were       exposed to a heavy musketry fire from the surrounding hills.       The conduct of the New Zealanders was admirable in thus       maintaining a difficult position till the Artillery caused the       enemy to retire.\"    Early on the morning of the 13th patrols were again fired upon, this  time from Platberg, a kopje on the fringe of Colesberg Commonage. About  4 A.M., in the dusk of early dawn, the Dutchmen, some 1800 strong, were  found to be leaving their position and advancing in the direction of  Naauwpoort. Thereupon Colonel Porter, with Carabineers, Inniskillings,  10th Hussars, and four guns of the R.H.A., moved eastwards. What Mr.  Gilbert describes as \"a short sharp shock\" followed, and the enemy's  guns, after firing three shots, were silenced. Our cavalry headed the  enemy off, and soon after 2 P.M. the bulk of his forces retired to their  former position. Vaalkop was held by one squadron of cavalry and two  guns for the rest of the day. Some Boers remained at Talboschlaagte,  and some later on occupied Kuilfontein Farm, but were driven out by  British shells with loss of forty killed and wounded. Our own losses  during two days' sharp work amounted to one man killed. Captain Moseley  (Inniskillings) was slightly wounded, and four men also received  injuries.    On the same date Colonel Miles reported from Orange River an unlucky  incident. Part of the Mounted Infantry under Captain Bradshaw and the  Guides under Lieutenant Macfarlane patrolled in the direction of Kamak  and Zoutpansdrift, ten miles east of Orange River, for the purpose of  reconnoitring and reporting the strength of the enemy. The Boers were  said to be holding the drift, and near there, somewhat suddenly, a  strong party of them appeared. The Mounted Infantry attacked, and a  brisk engagement followed, with the result that the enemy decamped to  Geemansberg. Unfortunately, for this smart piece of work Captain  Bradshaw paid with his life; Lieutenant Greyson (Buffs) was wounded,  three men were killed, and seven wounded. Captain Bradshaw was an  energetic and valuable officer, and his loss was deeply deplored.    To return to General French. Hard days of work in a broiling sun with  little to show for it were the lot of those around Naauwpoort at this  time. On the morning of the 15th two guns of the Horse Artillery, going  eastward across the veldt from Vaalkop, shelled a Boer waggon which had  been espied winding along the road. It was presumably from Colesberg,  and laden with supplies for the artillery of the enemy. Several shells  were at once launched, but they failed to strike it. The artillery then  tried a new position, and were \"sniped\" at by odd sharpshooters from the  hills. Finally a \"Long Tom\" was brought by the Boers to bear on the  situation, and then the artillery, pursued by shells, returned to  Vaalkop.    Boer aggression continued. On the 16th the enemy took up a position on a  hill near Kannaksolam and sniped at the British patrols when they went  to water their horses. The Dutchmen were splendidly concealed, so  splendidly that it was impossible for the patrols to return the fire.  The New Zealanders were also fired upon, and though five scouts lay for  hours on the hill watching the Boers' hiding-place, not one of the foe  showed his nose out of cover. At last, in the afternoon, Captain  Jackson, with eight Carabineers on patrol, caught sight of the enemy  peeping from his lair, and suddenly found himself in the midst of a  volley. Captain Jackson was shot in the spine and instantly killed, the  other members of the party and the riderless horse fleeing amid a storm  of bullets. On the morning of the 18th the remains of the gallant  officer were buried at Naauwpoort with military honours. The enemy's  position was shelled at daybreak by ten guns.    [Illustration: A RECONNAISSANCE IN FORCE WITH GENERAL FRENCH'S CAVALRY  NEAR COLESBERG.    Drawing by R. Caton Woodville.]    On the same day General French made a successful reconnaissance with  a battery of Horse Artillery and the New Zealand Rifles. The New  Zealanders had some exciting experiences. Major Lee and his men went  forth to draw the fire of the Boers, and unfortunately, instead of  drawing the shell of the enemy they drew the shot, and found themselves  all at once in a very warm corner indeed. They were rapidly hemmed in on  three sides, and stood a very good chance of being cut off. But pluck  carried the day, and though all their accoutrements, saddles, and  water-bottles showed visible signs of the hurricane of destruction  through which they had ridden, they arrived in camp safe and sound, much  to the satisfaction of the General, who issued an order complimenting  them on the success of their reconnaissance.    Major Lee, who was in command of the New Zealanders at Arundel, was  reported to be a splendid fellow--not the typical dashing officer by any  means, but what was described as a regular paterfamilias of somewhat  aldermanic proportions. He was hale, hearty, and beaming, and withal a  man of coolness and courage. The qualities possessed by this officer  were said to be shared by most of his men, who, though of the rough and  ready stamp, were true chips of the old British block.    Mr. Gifford Hall was most enthusiastic about Colonials all and sundry,  and, knowing their excellence and Great Britain's needs, delivered  himself of words of wisdom which are worthy of repetition:--         \"Ex-frontier cavalryman myself, with further experience as       cowboy in both the United States and North-west Canada, and       also as stockrider in Australia, I have never for a moment       doubted that in the raising of an irregular Anglo-Boer force       lay the solution of England's problem, 'How to successfully       cope with the enemy.' Sans standard of physique, sans much       orthodox training, sans everything but virility, inherent       horsemanship, inherent wild-land craft, mounted on his own       pony--bronco of Canada or brumbie of Australia--the Canadian       ranche hand, the Australian stockrider, shearer, station       rouseabout, or the 'cull' of all lands Anglicised might easily       become the quintessence of a useful and operative force against       a semi-guerilla enemy. A pair of cord breeches, a couple of       shirts, his big hat, and a cartridge-filled belt, Winchester       carbine, a pony of the sort that can be run to a white sweat,       and staggering, tremble, and then be kicked out to nuzzle for       grass or die--that's what your man wants. The pants and shirts       will be better than he has worn for years; the gun he has 'shot       straight' with ever since he first handled his 'daddy's'       muzzle-loader; and the 'hoss,' why each is of the other, horse       and man, each apart, a thing inept. Orthodoxy against the Boers       in military operations doesn't wash.       Aldershot-cum-Sandhurst-cum-Soudan-cum-Further-India and       War-Office tactics fall flat. The Boer is here, there, and       everywhere, not to be followed by 'crushing forces'--only to be       checked and turned and tracked and harried and hustled by a"]]]
