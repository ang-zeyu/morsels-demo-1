[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34984"],[0,"A Guide for the Study of Animals (#17)"],[1,"fins_, fins occurring in pairs of which the more anterior are  the _pectoral_ fins and the posterior are the _pelvic_ fins.    _Fin rays_, the framework or skeleton of the fins over which membrane  is stretched to form the fins. Fin rays are of two kinds: those  composed of _bone_ and those composed of _cartilage_.    _Lateral line_, a sense organ extending along each side of the fish  in a line indicated by tubes or perforations in the scales.    _Gills_, respiratory organs adapted for taking oxygen from the water.    _Operculum_, the flaps covering the gills on each side of the head.    _Pigment_, a substance which gives color to an object.          _Observations._    _Locomotion._    1. Watch the fishes in the large aquarium and determine which fins  are most used and how they are used (a) in swimming forward, (b) in  swimming upward and downward, (c) in maintaining balance, (d) in  remaining at rest, and (e) in guiding the movements of the fish.    2. What advantages are there to the fish (a) in the power to open  and close the dorsal and anal fins, (b) in having no neck, and  (c) in having a compressed form?    3. Enumerate the various ways by which the body of the fish is  adapted to rapid movement through the water.    _Feeding._    4. What is the food of the fishes you are studying? Feed them and  watch them eat. Why is the upper jaw often called a \"lip\"? What is  the shape and size of the mouth when opened in feeding? Does the fish  chew its food? Describe in detail the fishes' method of feeding.    _Respiration._    5. Identify the opercula and the gill openings. Watch the movements  of the opercula and mouth, and determine what movements are concerned  in breathing and their order. Describe in detail the circulation of  water used in breathing and how it is caused.    _Sense Organs._    6. Identify the eyes, nostrils, and lateral line. How many nostrils  are there and where located? What is the position and extent of the  lateral line?    7. Describe the location of the eyes. What is the shape of the outer  surface of the eyes? Why this shape? Can the eyes be moved, _i.e._  can they be rotated, rolled, or retracted? From what direction might  an enemy approach without being seen? How would such an enemy be  detected?    _Protection._    8. With what protective structures is the body covered? Do they  hinder the movements of the fish? What are the advantages of the  scale covering of fishes over the shell covering of grasshoppers or  crayfishes?    9. In what other ways are the fishes you are studying protected  against enemies? Since you cannot account for the red color of  goldfishes on the basis of use to the fish, then how do you account  for this bright color?    _The Body._    10. What is the symmetry of the fish? Into what regions is the body  divided?          _Summary of the study of the living fish._    Enumerate in one column the different adaptations which fit the fish  for life in water and in a second column state the special purpose of  each adaption.      The External Structure of the Fish          _Materials._    Freshly killed or preserved fish in dishes or shallow pans with  enough water to prevent drying. Simple or compound microscopes,  forceps, and a bristle.          _Directions._    Examine the fins and identify the membrane and the supporting rods,  or _rays_, of bone or cartilage. Notice how the ends of the  cartilaginous rays keep the membrane from tearing.    Investigate the scales as to their arrangement, number, and size.  Remove a small patch of scales along the lateral line to find how  they are attached, where the fish's color is situated, and how access  to the sensory organs of the line is permitted. Examine a scale under  the microscope.    Observe the eyes and identify the parts similar to those of the human  eye: lid, lash, tear-duct, cornea, iris, and pupil.    In front of and between the eyes, find the nostrils. By means of a  bristle determine whether these are connected and whether they do or  do not open into the mouth or the throat.          _Questions._    1. Make a list of the fins, classifying them according to their  structure.    2. Bearing in mind the differences in structure and consequent  action,--what can you say regarding the adaptation of the several  fins for protection? for rigidity or flexibility in locomotion?    3. State how much of the body is covered with scales, and where the  largest and the smallest ones are found.    4. How are the scales arranged with reference to each other? What  benefit is derived from this in protection? in locomotion? If you  have noticed any mucus or slime upon the body, state its use.    5. Do the scales or the skin bear the pigment? Give the color pattern  of the kind of fish used in class. How would this be useful to the  fish in its natural home?    6. Describe the structure of a scale and state how it is attached to  the skin. In what way is the lateral-line scale specialized?    7. State how, when the fish is swimming, the nostrils catch odors. By  means of a diagram, with arrows show the probable direction of the  water current through the nose.    8. State which of the structures of your eye are present in the  fish's eye, and which are missing. Could a fish weep? wink? How would  a fish sleep?    9. Inasmuch as light penetrates water but a little way, so that  objects can be distinguished only within about thirty feet, would the  fish be nearsighted or farsighted?          _Suggested drawings._    a. A side view of the entire fish, fully labeled.    b. A bony rayed and a cartilaginous rayed fin.    c. A scale, showing its minute structure.    d. A dorsal or a lateral view of the head, showing the sense organs.      The Mouth and the Gills of the Fish          _Materials._    The same materials as those used in the preceding exercise may be  used here.          _Directions._    The mouth, its structure and its action, can be seen by pulling the  upper jaw upward and forward until the mouth and the gill chambers  open fully. Examine the structure and action of the jaws, the tongue,  the throat, and the teeth on each jaw and on the roof of the mouth.    Investigate the breathing apparatus from the throat side and from the  exterior, noting the number, form, and structure of the gills, their  attachment and their protection.    The mouth may be kept open by a short splinter or a ball of paper.    The pupil should identify the following structures:--    1. _Gill_, an organ for breathing the air dissolved in water.    2. _Gill arch_, an arch of bone or cartilage supporting the gills.    3. _Gill filaments_, fringe-like structures attached to the gill  arches, forming the gills.    4. _Gill raker_, lateral projections from the gill arches.    5. _Gill-slits_, openings between the gill arches for the passage of  water.    6. _Operculum_, the flap-like covering of the gills on each side of  the head.          _Questions._    1. Compared with the size of its body, how wide can the fish open its  mouth? What do you infer as to the size of its \"bite\"?    2. Are the jaws rigidly affixed to the skull? Why should they be so  attached, or why not?    3. Of how many pieces is the upper jaw composed? the under jaw?    4. Where are the teeth? Judging from their form, size, and situation,  what do you think must be their use?    5. Do you think the tongue is used to assist in mastication? in  tasting? in speech? in swallowing?    6. How many gills are there, and where are they situated? How are  they attached? Which one is not free from the body throughout its  length?    7. What probably causes the color of the gill filaments? What is  there in their number and texture which fits them for their  function?    8. What is the direction of the water current through the gill  chamber? Of what use are the gill rakers?    9. How are the gills protected?          _Summary._    Write a complete account of how the fish eats and how it breathes.          _Suggested drawings._    a. A front view of the fish's face, with the mouth fully open.    b. A side view, as above.    c. A ventral view of the head, with both gill-chambers wide open and  the gills separated from each other. Indicate currents by arrows.    d. A single gill.      The Alimentary Canal and the Circulatory System of the Fish          _Materials._    Small fresh fish, shallow pans or dishes of water, forceps, and  scissors.          _Directions._    If the instructor has not opened the fish previously, this is to be  done by the student as follows: On the ventral side, insert the  scissors in the vent (in front of the anal fin) and cut straight  forward to a point between the opercula. Care must be exercised in  opening the chamber about the heart; this lies between the gill  chambers.    The various organs, so far as possible, should be carefully drawn out  and separated, in order that their structure may be distinguished.    The pupil should identify the following parts:--    1. _Body cavity_, the entire internal space, divided by a membrane,  _false diaphragm_, into a large _abdominal cavity_ and a small  chamber, _pericardial chamber_, between the gill chambers.    2. _Liver_, a large red or pink mass lying at the front end of  the abdominal cavity, and divided into two unequal lobes. The  _gall-bladder_, thin-walled and green, may be seen between these  lobes.    3. _Alimentary canal._      a. _Mouth._      b. _Esophagus_, in the fish a very short tube.      c. _Stomach_, white and muscular, beginning with a very short    esophagus and ending as a blind sac. If it is much distended,    open it to see what the fish may have eaten.      d. _Small intestine_, thin-walled, tubular, and somewhat coiled.      e. _Large intestine_, a short, thin-walled expansion at the    posterior end of the small intestine; usually less than half an    inch long.      f. _Coeca_, from two to several small pouches attached where the    small intestine leaves the stomach.    4."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35062"],[0,"The Woodpeckers (#17)"],[1,"   _wings and tail red beneath_ instead of yellow; throat ashy          gray; usually no red on occiput (though some specimens show a          narrow crescent).
