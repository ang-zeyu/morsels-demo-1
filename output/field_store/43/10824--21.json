He and half his little forlorn hope were struck down--he, alas!  to die the same night--but there were other leaders as brave to take his  place. 'Forrard away, men, forrard away!' cried Nugent, of the Rifles.  Three bullets struck him, but he continued to drag himself up the  boulder-studded hill. Others followed, and others, from all sides  they came running, the crouching, yelling, khaki-clad figures, and the  supports rushed up from the rear. For a time they were beaten down by  their own shrapnel striking into them from behind, which is an amazing  thing when one considers that the range was under 2000 yards. It was  here, between the wall and the summit, that Colonel Gunning, of the  Rifles, and many other brave men met their end, some by our own bullets  and some by those of the enemy; but the Boers thinned away in front  of them, and the anxious onlookers from the plain below saw the waving  helmets on the crest, and learned at last that all was well.    But it was, it must be confessed, a Pyrrhic victory. We had our hill,  but what else had we? The guns which had been silenced by our fire had  been removed from the kopje. The commando which seized the hill was that  of Lucas Meyer, and it is computed that he had with him about 4000  men. This figure includes those under the command of Erasmus, who made  halfhearted demonstrations against the British flank. If the shirkers  be eliminated, it is probable that there were not more than a thousand  actual combatants upon the hill. Of this number about fifty were killed  and a hundred wounded. The British loss at Talana Hill itself was 41  killed and 180 wounded, but among the killed were many whom the army  could ill spare. The gallant but optimistic Symons, Gunning of the  Rifles, Sherston, Connor, Hambro, and many other brave men died that  day. The loss of officers was out of all proportion to that of the men.    An incident which occurred immediately after the action did much to rob  the British of the fruits of the victory. Artillery had pushed up the  moment that the hill was carried, and had unlimbered on Smith's Nek  between the two hills, from which the enemy, in broken groups of 50  and 100, could be seen streaming away. A fairer chance for the use of  shrapnel has never been. But at this instant there ran from an old iron  church on the reverse side of the hill, which had been used all day as  a Boer hospital, a man with a white flag. It is probable that the action  was in good faith, and that it was simply intended to claim a protection  for the ambulance party which followed him. But the too confiding gunner  in command appears to have thought that an armistice had been declared,  and held his hand during those precious minutes which might have turned  a defeat into a rout. The chance passed, never to return. The double  error of firing into our own advance and of failing to fire into the  enemy's retreat makes the battle one which cannot be looked back to with  satisfaction by our gunners.    In the meantime some miles away another train of events had led to a  complete disaster to our small cavalry force--a disaster which robbed  our dearly bought infantry victory of much of its importance. That  action alone was undoubtedly a victorious one, but the net result of the  day's fighting cannot be said to have been certainly in our favour.  It was Wellington who asserted that his cavalry always got him into  scrapes, and the whole of British military history might furnish  examples of what he meant. Here again our cavalry got into trouble.  Suffice it for the civilian to chronicle the fact, and leave it to the  military critic to portion out the blame.    One company of mounted infantry (that of the Rifles) had been told off  to form an escort for the guns. The rest of the mounted infantry with  part of the 18th Hussars (Colonel Moller) had moved round the right  flank until they reached the right rear of the enemy. Such a movement,  had Lucas Meyer been the only opponent, would have been above criticism;  but knowing, as we did, that there were several commandoes converging  upon Glencoe it was obviously taking a very grave and certain risk  to allow the cavalry to wander too far from support. They were soon  entangled in broken country and attacked by superior numbers of the  Boers. There was a time when they might have exerted an important  influence upon the action by attacking the Boer ponies behind the hills,  but the opportunity was allowed to pass. An attempt was made to get back  to the army, and a series of defensive positions were held to cover  the retreat, but the enemy's fire became too hot to allow them to be  retained. Every route save one appeared to be blocked, so the horsemen  took this, which led them into the heart of a second commando of the  enemy. Finding no way through, the force took up a defensive position,  part of them in a farm and part on a kopje which overlooked it.    The party consisted of two troops of Hussars, one company of mounted  infantry of the Dublin Fusiliers, and one section of the mounted  infantry of the Rifles--about two hundred men in all. They were  subjected to a hot fire for some hours, many being killed and wounded.  Guns were brought up, and fired shell into the farmhouse. At 4.30 the  force, being in a perfectly hopeless position, laid down their arms.  Their ammunition was gone, many of their horses had stampeded, and they  were hemmed in by very superior numbers, so that no slightest slur can  rest upon the survivors for their decision to surrender, though the  movements which brought them to such a pass are more open to criticism.  They were the vanguard of that considerable body of humiliated and  bitter-hearted men who were to assemble at the capital of our brave and  crafty enemy. The remainder of the 18th Hussars, who under Major Knox  had been detached from the main force and sent across the Boer rear,  underwent a somewhat similar experience, but succeeded in extricating  themselves with a loss of six killed and ten wounded. Their efforts were  by no means lost, as they engaged the attention of a considerable body  of Boers during the day and were able to bring some prisoners back with  them.    The battle of Talana Hill was a tactical victory but a strategic defeat.  It was a crude frontal attack without any attempt at even a feint of  flanking, but the valour of the troops, from general to private, carried  it through. The force was in a position so radically false that the only  use which they could make of a victory was to cover their own retreat.  From all points Boer commandoes were converging upon it, and already  it was understood that the guns at their command were heavier than any  which could be placed against them. This was made more clear on October  21st, the day after the battle, when the force, having withdrawn  overnight from the useless hill which they had captured, moved across  to a fresh position on the far side of the railway. At four in the  afternoon a very heavy gun opened from a distant hill, altogether beyond  the extreme range of our artillery, and plumped shell after shell into  our camp. It was the first appearance of the great Creusot. An officer  with several men of the Leicesters, and some of our few remaining  cavalry, were bit. The position was clearly impossible, so at two in the  morning of the 22nd the whole force was moved to a point to the south  of the town of Dundee. On the same day a reconnaissance was made in the  direction of Glencoe Station, but the passes were found to be strongly  occupied, and the little army marched back again to its original  position. The command had fallen to Colonel Yule, who justly considered  that his men were dangerously and uselessly exposed, and that his  correct strategy was to fall back, if it were still possible, and join  the main body at Ladysmith, even at the cost of abandoning the two  hundred sick and wounded who lay with General Symons in the hospital at  Dundee. It was a painful necessity, but no one who studies the situation  can have any doubt of its wisdom. The retreat was no easy task, a march  by road of some sixty or seventy miles through a very rough country with  an enemy pressing on every side. Its successful completion without any  loss or any demoralisation of the troops is perhaps as fine a military  exploit as any of our early victories. Through the energetic and loyal  co-operation of Sir George White, who fought the actions of Elandslaagte  and of Rietfontein in order to keep the way open for them, and owing  mainly to the skillful guidance of Colonel Dartnell, of the Natal  Police, they succeeded in their critical manoeuvre. On October 23rd they  were at Beith, on the 24th at Waselibank Spruit, on the 25th at Sunday  River, and next morning they marched, sodden with rain, plastered with  mud, dog-tired, but in the best of spirits, into Ladysmith amid the  cheers of their comrades. A battle, six days without settled sleep, four  days without a proper meal, winding up with a single march of thirty-two  miles over heavy ground and through a pelting rain storm--that was the  record of the Dundee column. They had fought and won, they had striven  and toiled to the utmost capacity of manhood, and the end of it all was  that they had reached the spot which they should never have left. But  their endurance could not be lost--no worthy deed is ever lost. Like the  light division, when they marched their fifty odd unbroken miles to  be present at Talavera, they leave a memory and a standard behind them  which is more important than success. It is by the tradition of such  sufferings and such endurance that others in other days are nerved to do  the like.        CHAPTER 6. ELANDSLAAGTE AND RIETFONTEIN.    While the Glencoe force had struck furiously"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30691"],[0,"Astounding Stories of Super-Science, December 1930 (#17)"],[1,"shouts, both of which were heard by the watch on the _Wren_, the Coast  Guard cutter. They reported that at 1:30, the _Arethusa_ sank without  warning. As soon as he heard your shouts, the watch gave the alarm and  the crew piled on deck. The _Arethusa_ was gone completely and the  _Wren_ was tossing about like 'a chip in a whirlpool' as they  graphically described it. The _Wren_ had steam up and they fought the  waves and steamed over your anchoring ground looking for survivors, but  they found none. The sea gradually subsided and they did the only thing  they could do--dropped a buoy, to guide the salvage people, and radioed  for assistance. The _Robin_ came out and joined them, and both cutters  stood by until daylight, but nothing unusual was seen. The insurance  people are trying to salvage the wreck now, but so far they have made  little headway.\"    \"That brings me to the rest of the story, the part that made me decide  to come to you, Doctor,\" said the seaman. \"Did you see what happened to  the divers yesterday?\"    Dr. Bird nodded.    \"I saw a brief account of it,\" he said. \"It seems that two of them were  lost through their lines getting fouled and their air connections  severed in some way. I don't believe the bodies have been recovered  yet.\"    \"They never will be recovered, Doctor. I was discharged from the  hospital yesterday and the papers were just out with an account of it. I  went down to the dock where the _John MacLean_, the salvage ship, ties  up, and I talked to Captain Starley who commands it. I have known him  casually for some years, although not intimately, and he gave me a few  more details than the press got. He didn't connect me up at first with  the Mitchell who was reported lost on the _Arethusa_.    \"The first man to go down from the _MacLean_ was Charley Melrose, an  expert diver. He went down in a pressure outfit to the bottom and  started to work. Everything was going along fine until the telephone  suddenly rang and the man who answered it heard him say, 'Raise me, for  God's sake! Hurry!' The signal for raising was given, but they hadn't  got him more than thirty feet from the bottom before there came a tug on  the line and he was gone! The air line, the lifting cable and the  telephone cord floated free and were reeled in. Melrose had been plucked  off the end of that line as you or I would pluck off a grape.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Bird leaned forward with the curious glitter again in his eye.    \"Go on,\" he said tersely.    \"Blake, the other diver, donned a suit and insisted on being lowered at  once. Starley tried to dissuade him but he insisted on going down. They  lowered him over the side with a twelve-foot steel-shod pike in his  hand. He never got to the bottom. He had not been lowered more than a  hundred feet when a scream came over the telephone, and again there was  a jerk on the lines which threatened to wreck the reel--and the line  came aboard with no diver on the end of it. At the same time, Starley  told me, the sea boiled and churned as though the whole bottom were  coming up, and his ship was tossed about as though it were in a violent  storm, although it was calm enough for forty fathom salvage work and  that is pretty quiet, you know. Half the time his screws were out of  water and he had a hard time to keep from being capsized. He fought his  way out of the disturbed area, and as soon as he did, it started to  quiet down, and in ten minutes it was calm again.    \"Starley was pretty badly shaken and besides he had lost both of his  divers, so he came in and I saw him at the dock. When I heard his yarn,  I took him into my confidence and told him what I had seen and that I  proposed coming to you and asking your advice. I was afraid until I  heard his story that it was merely a vision that I had had, but it  certainly was no vision that plucked those two divers off their lines.\"    \"Has Captain Starley told that story to anyone else yet?\"    \"No, Doctor, he hasn't. He promised not to talk until after I had seen  you. I'll vouch for him; he'll keep his word through anything; and he is  keeping his whole crew on board until he hears from me.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Bird sprang to his feet.    \"Mr. Mitchell,\" he said energetically, \"you have shown excellent  judgment. Wire Captain Starley that you have seen me and that he is to  hold his crew on board and to talk to no one until I get there. Carnes,  telephone the Chief of Naval Operations and ask him to receive me in  conference at once. Have him get the Secretary of the Navy in, too, if  he is available. When you have finished that, telephone Bolton that you  will be away from Washington indefinitely.\"    \"I'll telephone Admiral Buck for you, Doctor, but I don't dare telephone  any such message to Bolton; he'd take my head off. He has been running  the whole service ragged lately, and this is my first afternoon off duty  in a fortnight.\"    \"What's the trouble, a flood of new counterfeits?\"    \"No, the counterfeit division is getting along all right. In point of  fact, they have lent us a dozen men. The trouble is a sudden big  increase in Communist activity throughout the country, with the Young  Labor party behind it. Bolton has been pretty jumpy since that Stokowski  affair last August and he is afraid of another attempt of some sort on  the President.\"    \"The Young Labor party? I thought that gang was bankrupt and out of  business, since the Coast Guard broke up their alien smuggling scheme.\"    \"They were down and out for a while, but they are in funds again--and  how! They must have three or four millions at least.\"    \"Where did they get it?\"    \"That's what we have been trying to find out. The leaders have presented  bars of gold to a dozen banks throughout the country and demanded  specie. The banks shipped the gold to the mint and it was good gold,  nine hundred and twenty-five fine. What we are trying to find out is how  that gold got into the United States.\"    \"A shipment of that size should be easy to trace.\"    \"It would seem so, but it hasn't been. We have accounted for every pound  of every shipment that has come in through a port of entry, and we have  checked almost that close on the output of every mine in the United  States. If the gold came from Russia, it would have had to cross Europe,  and we can't get any trace of it from abroad. It looks as though they  were _making_ it.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Bird rubbed his head thoughtfully.    \"Possible, but hardly probable,\" he said. \"How much did you say they  had?\"    \"Over three millions in thirty-pound bars. Each bar shows signs of  having a mint mark chiselled off, but that don't help much for they have  done too good a job. It has us pretty well bluffed.\"    Again Dr. Bird rubbed his head.    \"Telephone Admiral Buck, and then phone Bolton and tell him exactly what  I told you to: that you will be away indefinitely. When he gets through  exploding, tell him that you are going with me and that possibly, just  barely possibly, we might be on the trail of that gold shipment.\"    \"On the trail of the gold!\" gasped Carnes. \"Surely, Doctor, you don't  think--\"    \"Once in a while, old dear,\" replied the Doctor with a chuckle, \"which  is more than anyone in the Secret Service does. You might tell Bolton  that I said that, but hang up quickly if you do. I don't want the wires  of my telephone melted off. No, Carnesy, I have no miraculous  inspiration as to where that gold is coming from; I just have a plain  old-fashioned hunch, and that hunch is that we are going to have lots of  fun and more than our share of danger before we see Washington again.  After you get through bearding Bolton in his den, you might call the  Chief of the Air Corps and ask him to have a bomber held at Langley  Field subject to my orders. If he squawks any, I'll talk to him.\"    He turned to a telephone which stood on his desk and lifted the  receiver.    \"Get Mr. Lambertson on the wire,\" he said. \"He is the chief technician  of the Pyrex Glass Works at Corning, New Jersey.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The _U.S.S. Minneconsin_ steamed out of New York harbor and headed down  toward the lower bay. On her forward deck rested a huge globe. The  bottom quarter of the sphere was made of some dark opaque substance but  the upper portion was transparent as crystal. Through the walls could be  seen a quantity of apparatus resting on the opaque bottom portion. Two  mechanics from the Bureau of Standards were making final adjustments of  one of the pieces of apparatus, which resembled a tank fitted with a  piston geared to an electric motor. From the tank, tubes ran to four  hollow pipes, an inch and a half in diameter, which ran through the skin  and extended thirty inches from the outer skin of the twenty-foot  sphere. Dr. Bird stood near talking with the executive officer of the  ship and from time to time giving a brief word of direction to the  mechanics.    \"It's safer than you might think, Commander,\" he said. \"In the first  place, that globe is not made of ordinary glass; it is made of  vitrilene, a new semi-malleable glass which was developed at the Bureau  and which is being made on an experimental scale for us by the Pyrex  people. It is much stronger than ordinary glass, and is not sensitive to  shock. It is also perfectly transparent to ultra-violet light, being  superior even to rock crystal or fused quartz in that respect. The  walls, as you have noticed, are four inches thick, and I have calculated  that the ball will stand a uniform external pressure of thirty-five  hundred atmospheres, the pressure which would be encountered at a depth  of about twenty miles. I believe that it will stand a squeeze of six  thousand tons without buckling, and it is impossible to fracture it by  shock. It could be dropped from the top of the Woolworth Building, and  it "]]]
