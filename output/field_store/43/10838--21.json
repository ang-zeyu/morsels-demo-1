Like the Sharp-tail  they nest on the ground, laying 3-4 white or bluish white eggs, clouded  or finely speckled with cinnamon-brown, the latter part of May.    This northern Seaside Finch is migratory, coming the latter part of  April and remaining until the latter half of October, but in the South  there are several races which for the most part are resident in the same  locality throughout the year. Thus we have:    Macgillivray's Seaside Sparrow (_P. m. macgillivraii_).--Atlantic Coast  from North Carolina south to Matanzas Islet, Florida. Dusky Seaside  Sparrow (_P. nigrescens_), an almost black species from Merritt's  Island, at the head of Indian River, Florida. Cape Sable Sparrow (_P. m.  mirabilis_), Cape Sable, Florida. Scott's Seaside Sparrow (_P. m.  peninsulae_), Gulf Coast of Florida from Tampa to St. Marks; Northwest  Florida Sparrow (_P. m. juncicola_) Coast of Florida west of St. Marks;  Alabama Seaside Sparrow (_P. m. howelli_), Coast of Alabama and  Mississippi. Louisiana Seaside Sparrow (_P. m. fisheri_), Coast of  Louisiana to Northeast Texas; and Sennett's Seaside Sparrow (_P. m.  sennetti_), Coast of Texas from Galveston at least to Corpus Christi.      LARK SPARROW    _Chondestes grammacus grammacus. Case 7, Fig. 19_              The chestnut and white head markings and the            white-tipped tail-feathers are conspicuous            field-marks. L. 6-1/4.              _Range._ Mississippi Valley; nests from Louisiana            to Minnesota and Ohio; winters from Mississippi            southward; casual east of the Alleghanies, chiefly            in the fall.              Washington, A.V., Aug., two captures. N. Ohio,            rare S.R., Apl. 28. Glen Ellyn, local and uncommon            S.R. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 20-Aug. 2.    Few field experiences have given me more pleasure than the discovery  near my home at Englewood one November 2, many years ago, of a Lark  Finch--one of the 'casuals' which had presumably been carried far from  its course by a severe storm of the preceding days. The bird's strongly  marked face and conspicuously white-tipped tail-feathers made an  impression which testifies to their value as field-characters. In its  own range this beautiful Sparrow is a sweet-voiced inhabitant of the  fields, nesting on the ground or in low trees and bushes, and laying 3-5  white eggs, spotted and blotched with blackish, in May.      HARRIS'S SPARROW    _Zonotrichia querula. Case 7, Fig. 21_              A large Sparrow, larger even than the Fox Sparrow;            with a pinkish bill, the crown, throat and breast            more or less blackish; cheeks buff. L. 7-1/2.              _Range._ Interior of North America, nesting in            North Carolina; winters from Kansas to Texas; rare            east of Wisconsin. Glen Ellyn, one record, May 19.            SE. Minn., common T.V., May 6; Sept. 21-Oct. 25.    When migrating this Sparrow reminds one of a White-throat. It has a  sharp _clink_ note and frequents brier patches and bushy places.      WHITE-CROWNED SPARROW    _Zonotrichia leucophrys. Case 7, Fig. 22_              Resembles the White-throat but throat gray, like            the breast, space before the eye black, not            yellow, white in the crown more conspicuous. L.            6-3/4.              _Range._ Nests in Canada; winters from Virginia            and Ohio to Mexico; not a common migrant in the            Atlantic States.

Minn., common T.V., Apl. 30-; Sept. 26-Oct.            14.    This distinguished-looking cousin of our White-throated Sparrow is rare  enough in the Eastern States, always to command our attention when we  are so fortunate as to meet him. He resembles the White-throat in habits  and choice of haunts but his song has a tender, appealing quality,  lacking in the White-throat's more cheerful lay, charming as that is.      WHITE-THROATED SPARROW    _Zonotrichia albicollis. Case 2. Figs. 45, 46; Case 4, Fig. 40_              The adults may be recognized at sight by their            white throat, but this character is less prominent            and sometimes almost wanting in young birds (Fig.            46) which will require close scrutiny. L. 6-3/4.              _Range._ Nests from northern New England and            central Minnesota northward; winters from southern            New England and Ohio to the Gulf.

This clear-voiced whistler is known to many persons who have never seen  it. When anyone returning from the bird's summer range tells me \"I heard  a bird sing like this,\" I know before he whistles a note that he will  probably imitate the White-throat. Fortunately the song has so much  character and its intervals conform so closely to those of our musical  scale, that a recognizable imitation of it is within the power of  everyone. There is much variation in the arrangement of the notes and  migrants never seem to sing with the power of nesting birds, nor do fall  songs compare in volume or execution with those of spring. The call-note  is a characteristic sharp _clink_.    The White-throat is abundant, migrating and wintering in companies which  frequent bushy places, hedgerows and undergrowth generally. The nest is  placed on the ground or in bushes in late May or early June. The eggs.  4-5 in number, are bluish white, speckled or blotched with brown.      TREE SPARROW    _Spizella monticola monticola. Case 2, Fig. 44; Case 4, Fig. 46_              A dusky spot in the center of the breast and a            reddish brown cap and streak behind the eye are            distinguishing characters. L. 6-1/2.              _Range._ Nests in Canada; winters from southern            Canada south to Arkansas and South Carolina.              Washington, abundant W.V., Oct.-Apl. 1.

From October to April companies of Tree Sparrows harvest the season's  crop of weed seeds, feeding usually near woods or hedge-rows to which  they go to rest and roost. Their merry chatter is one of the season's  most cheerful notes, and in the spring we may hear their canary-like  song.      CHIPPING SPARROW    _Spizella passerina passerina. Case 4, Fig. 45; Case 5, Fig. 31_              In summer, the chestnut cap, black bill, and            whitish line over the eye mark the 'Chippy'; but            in the fall and winter the crown is like the back,            the line over the eye is brownish, and the bill is            brown; but the gray rump, shown well in flight, is            a good character the year around. L. 5-1/2.              _Range._ Nests from Georgia and Mississippi to            Canada; winters from South Carolina to the Gulf.              Washington, common S.R., abundant T.V., Mch.            9-Nov. 11, occasionally winters. Ossining, common            S.R., Apl. 5-Nov. 7. Cambridge, abundant S.R.,            Apl. 12-Oct. 25. N.

The friendly Chippy is the most familiar and domestic of any of our  native Sparrows. He makes tentative visits to our piazzas and, cats  permitting, will take up his residence there, building a neat,  hair-lined nest in the vines or a nearby bush. Unassuming in voice as he  is in manner, his _Chippy-chippy-chippy_, many times repeated,  expresses contentment, even if it does not attain high musical rank.  Madame Chippy has fine taste in eggs, laying, in early May, little blue  gems, beautifully marked with brown or black.      CLAY-COLORED SPARROW    _Spizella pallida. Case 6, Fig. 48_              The Clay-colored Sparrow resembles a winter            Chipping Sparrow, but is paler and has a white            line over the eye and a brownish rump. L. 5-1/2.              _Range._ Interior states east to Illinois; winters            from Texas southward. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl.            26-Oct. 19.    A Chipping Sparrow of the Plains which nests on the ground and in low  bushes. It is not common east of the Mississippi.      FIELD SPARROW    _Spizella pusilla pusilla. Case 4, Fig. 43; Case 5, Fig. 14_              The upperparts are brighter reddish brown than in            any of our other Sparrows, and the bill is            'pinker.' L. 5-1/2.              _Range._ Nests from northern Florida and central            Louisiana to Minnesota and Maine; winters from New            Jersey and Illinois to the Gulf States.

Perhaps you may like to publish the following instance of jealousy in a  cow; it is, at any rate, a story at first-hand, as I myself was an actor  in the affair.    A few years ago, I had a quiet milch-cow, Rose, who certainly was fond  of Thomas, the man who milked her regularly, and she also showed an  aversion to dogs even greater than is usual in her species. One night,  for what reason I now forget, I had tied up a young collie dog in the  little cowshed where she was accustomed to be milked. The following  morning, I had just begun to dress, when I heard the puppy barking in  the cowshed. \"Oh!\" thought I, \"I forgot to tell Thomas about the puppy,  and now the cow will get in first and gore it.\" The next minute I heard  a roar of unmistakable fear and anguish--a human roar. I dashed down to  the spot, and at the same moment arrived my son, pitchfork in hand.  There lay Thomas on his face in a dry gutter by the side of the road to  the cowhouse, and the cow butting angrily at him. We drove off the cow,  and poor Thomas scuffled across the road, slipped through a wire fence,  stood up and drew breath. \"Why, Thomas,\" said I, \"what's the matter with  Rose?\" \"Well, sir,\" said Thomas, \"I heard the pup bark and untied him,  and I was just coming out of the cowhouse, with the pup in my arms, when  'Rose' came round the corner. As soon as she see'd the pup in my arms,  she rushed at me without more ado, knocked me down, and would have  killed me if you hadn't come up.\" Thomas had indeed had a narrow escape;  his trousers were ripped up from end to end, and red marks all along his  legs showed where Rose's horns had grazed along them. \"Well,\" said I,  \"you'd better not milk her this morning, since she's in such a fury.\"  \"Oh! I'll milk her right enough, sir, by and by; just give her a little  time to settle down like. It's only jealousy of that 'ere pup, sir. She  couldn't abide seeing me a-fondling of it.\" \"Well, as you like,\" said I;  \"only take care, and mind what you're about.\" \"All right, sir!\"    In about twenty minutes, Thomas called me down to see the milk. The cow  had stood quiet enough to be milked. But the milk was deeply tinged with  blood, and in half an hour a copious red precipitate had settled to the  bottom of the pail. Till then I had doubted the jealousy theory. After  that I believed.              C. HUNTER BROWN.      AN AUSTRALIAN DOG-STORY.              [_May 11, 1895._]    Seeing the great interest which many of your readers take in the study  of canine character and intelligence, I think perhaps the following  incident is worth recording. Whilst walking with a lady friend along  Studley Park Road, Kew (a residential suburb of Melbourne), on a very  quiet afternoon some time ago, we were surprised by a large St. Bernard  dog, which came up to us and deliberately pawed my leg several times.  Our perplexity at his extraordinary behaviour was perhaps not unmixed  with a little misgiving, for he was an animal of formidable size and  strength; but as he gave evident signs of satisfaction at our noticing  him, and proceeded to trot on in front--at intervals looking round to  make sure we were following--we became interested. When we had followed  him about forty yards, he stopped before a door in a high garden wall,  and, looking round anxiously to see that we were noticing, reached up  his paw in the direction of the latch. On stretching forth my hand to  unfasten the door, his extreme pleasure was exhibited in a most  unmistakable manner; but when he saw me try in vain to open it, he  became quiet, and looked at me with an expression so manifestly anxious  that I could no more have left the poor animal thus than I could have  left a helpless little child in a similar position. With eager attention  and expectancy he listened while I knocked, and when at last some one  was heard coming down the garden path, he bounded about with every sign  of unlimited joy.    Now here was one of the so-called \"brutes,\" which, failing to get in at  a certain door, cast about for a way out of the difficulty, and seeing  us some distance down the road (we were the only persons in sight at the  time), he had come to us, attracted our attention, taken us to the door,  and told us he wanted it opened. We both agreed that the animal had all  through shown a play of emotion and intelligence comparable to that of  a human being; and, indeed, we felt so much akin to the noble creature  that we have both, since then, been very loath to class dogs as  \"inferior animals.\"              GEORGE EASTGATE.      TWO ANECDOTES OF DOGS.              [_Feb. 2, 1895._]    Having derived much pleasure from reading the frequent natural history  notes which from time to time appear in the _Spectator_, I venture to  send you two instances of what seems to me the working of the canine  mind under quite different circumstances. The first refers to an  incident which happened a great many years ago. It was this. One day,  when a lad, I was walking with my father accompanied by a strong,  smooth-haired retriever called Turk. We were joined by the bailiff of  the farm, and in the course of our walk Turk suddenly discovered the  presence of a rabbit concealed in what in Scotland is called a  \"dry-stane dyke.\" After a little trouble in removing some stones, poor  bunny was caught and slaughtered, being handed to the bailiff, who put  it in his coat pocket. Shortly afterwards we separated, the bailiff  going to his home in one direction, and we to ours in an opposite one.  Before we reached home we noticed that Turk was no longer with us, at  which we were rather surprised, as he was a very faithful follower. Some  time after we got home, perhaps an hour, I chanced to see a strange  object on the public road which puzzled me as to what it was. It raised  a cloud of dust as it came along, which partly obscured the vision. What  was my surprise when I found it was Turk dragging a man's  shooting-jacket, which proved to be the bailiff's, with the rabbit still  in the pocket. We afterwards learnt that the dog, to the surprise of the  bailiff, quietly followed him home, and lay down near him. Presently the  man took off his coat, and laid it on a chair. Instantly Turk pounced  upon it, and dashed to the door with it in his mouth. He was pursued,  but in vain, and succeeded in dragging the coat from the one house to  the other, a distance of one mile and three-fourths. It was evident the  dog had a strong sense of the rights of property. He believed the rabbit  belonged to his master, so he set himself to recover what he thought  stolen goods.    The other anecdote refers to quite a recent date, and the only interest  it has, is that it shows how perfectly a dog can exhibit facial  expression, and also read at a glance the slightest indications of  feeling in the human face. I had a well-broken Irish setter, which was  perfectly free of hare or rabbit as to chasing, but he was a sad rascal  for all that. I also had at the time a rough Scotch terrier, and the two  dogs were great chums. The moment they got the chance they were off  together on a rabbit-hunt. Like idiots, they would spend hours in vainly  trying to dig rabbits out of their burrows. One day as I was returning  home I met the pair in the avenue. They were the very picture of  happiness. At first they did not see me, and came joyously on at a trot.  The instant they observed me they came to a full stop, some forty yards  off. The setter gently wagged his tail, and looked at me with an  expression of anxious inquiry. Taking heart, he slowly advanced to  within about thirty yards, and then came the varying play of feature  which so interested me. He was in great doubt as to whether I had  guessed what tricks he had been up to; but as I made no sign, he was  gradually looking more comfortable and gaining confidence. Suddenly I  noticed a patch of mud above his nose, and I must have unconsciously  shown him I had made a discovery of some kind, for that instant he  turned tail and bolted home at the utmost speed of which he was capable.  Without uttering a single word, or making a single gesture, the dog and  man understood each other perfectly. It was the language of faces.              R. SCOT SKIRVING.      A DOG OBEYING A SUMMONS              [_Jan. 18, 1890._]    The enclosed may interest you. I received it this morning. I have no  doubt Dr. Barford, of Wokingham, would verify it, but I have not the  pleasure of his acquaintance. The following is the story:--    \"Dr. Barford's dog at Wokingham was put into a muzzle; he objected to  it, took it off, and hid it somewhere, no one knows where. Policeman saw  him; summoned Dr. B.; case was to come off one Saturday. The children  told dog how wicked _he'd_ been: Dr. B. would have to appear at the  Court, and he too, as it was his doing; he'd lost the muzzle. Case was  postponed (I think policeman witness had influenza). Dr. B. was told of  postponement by letter; forgot to tell children or dog. At Saturday's  Bench, Magistrates much astonished by the dog appearing in Court and  sitting solemnly opposite them.\"              ALYS M. WOOD.      A PUG'S INTELLIGENCE.              [_Feb. 1, 1890._]    Several newspaper cuttings have been sent to me with the story of my dog  which appeared in the _Spectator_ of January 18th, and one or two of  them suggest a doubt as to the veracity of the story. I write,  therefore, to tell you that it is literally true, only that the  policeman was away for his holiday instead of having influenza, and the  case came off on Tuesday instead of Saturday. My dog is a pug, a very  choice specimen of his kind, and was given to me by the late Dr. Wakley,  editor of the _Lancet_, who was a great connoisseur in dogs. His  intelligence is really marvellous, and he has done many things as  extraordinary as the one related by Miss Wood.    He is devotedly attached to my baby, and"]]]
