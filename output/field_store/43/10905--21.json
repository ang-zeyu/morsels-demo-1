There  is a peculiar fly in most tropical climates, but more especially in  Ceylon, which lays live maggots, instead of eggs that require some time  to hatch. These are the most dreadful pests, as the lively young maggots  exhibit a horrible activity in commencing their work the instant they  see the light; they burrow almost immediately into the flesh, and grow  to a large size within twenty-four hours, occasioning the most loathsome  sores. The best cure for any wound thus attacked, and swarming with live  maggots, is a teaspoonful of calomel applied and rubbed into the deep  sore.    I have seen the Arabs in the Soudan adopt a most torturing remedy when a  camel has suffered from a fly-blown sore back. Upon one occasion I saw a  camel kneeling upon the ground with a number of men around it, and I  found that it was to undergo a surgical operation for a terrible wound  upon its hump. This was a hole as large and deep as an ordinary  breakfast-cup, which was alive with maggots. The operator had been  preparing a quantity of glowing charcoal, which was at a red heat. This  was contained in a piece of broken chatty, a portion of a water jar, and  it was dexterously emptied into the diseased cavity on the camel's back.    The poor creature sprang to its feet, and screaming with agony, dashed  at full gallop across the desert in a frantic state, with the fire  scorching its flesh, and doubtless making it uncomfortable for the  maggots. Fire is the Arabs' vade mecum; the actual cautery is deeply  respected, and is supposed to be infallible. If internal inflammation  should attack the patient, the surface is scored with a red-hot iron.  Should guinea-worm be suspected, there is no other course to pursue than  to burn the suffering limb in a series of spots with a red-hot iron  ramrod. The worm will shortly make its appearance at one of these  apertures after some slight inflammation and suppuration. This fearful  complaint is termed Frendeet in the Soudan, and it is absorbed into the  system generally by drinking foul water. At the commencement of the  rainy season, when the ground has been parched by the long drought of  summer, the surface-water drains into the hollows and forms muddy pools.  The natives shun such water, as it is almost certain to contain the eggs  of the guinea-worm. These in some mysterious manner are hatched within  the body if swallowed in the act of drinking, and whether they develop  in the stomach or in the intestines, it is difficult to determine, but  the result is the same. The patient complains of rheumatic pains in one  limb; this increases until the leg or arm swells to a frightful extent,  accompanied by severe inflammation and great torment. The Arab  practitioner declares that the worm is at work, and is seeking for a  means of escape from the body. He accordingly burns half a dozen holes  with a red-hot iron or ramrod. In a few days the head of the guinea-worm  appears; it is immediately captured by a finely-split reed, and by  degrees is wound like a cotton thread by turning the reed every day.  This requires delicate manipulation, otherwise the worm might break, and  a portion remain in the flesh, which would increase the inflammation. An  average guinea-worm would be about three feet in length. Animals do not  appear to suffer from this complaint, although they are subject to the  attacks of great varieties of parasites. Elephants are frequently  troubled with internal worms. I witnessed a curious instance of the  escape of such insects from the stomach through a hole caused by a  bullet, nevertheless the animal appeared to be in good condition.    It was a fine moonlight night on the borders of Abyssinia that I sat up  to watch the native crops, which were a great attraction to the wild  elephants, although there was no heavy jungle nearer than 20 miles. It  was the custom of these animals to start after sunset, and to arrive at  about ten o'clock in the vast dhurra fields of the Arabs, who, being  without fire-arms, could only scare them by shouts and flaming torches.  The elephants did not care much for this kind of disturbance, and they  merely changed their position from one portion of the cultivated land to  another more distant, and caused serious destruction to the crop  (Sorghum vulgare), which was then nearly ripe. The land was rich, and  the dhurra grew 10 or 12 feet high, with stems as thick as sugar-cane,  while the large heads of corn contained several thousand grains the size  of a split-pea. This was most tempting food for elephants, and they  travelled nightly the distance named to graze upon the crops, and then  retreated before sunrise to their distant jungles.    I do not enjoy night shooting, but there was no other way of assisting  the natives, therefore I found myself watching, in the silent hours of  night, in the middle of a perfect sea of cultivation, unbroken for many  miles. There is generally a calm during the night, and there was so  perfect a stillness that it was almost painful, the chirp of an insect  sounding as loud as though it were a bird. At length there was a distant  sound like wind, or the rush of a stream over a rocky bed. This might  have been a sudden gust, but the sharp crackling of brittle dhurra stems  distinctly warned us that elephants had invaded the field, and that they  were already at their work of destruction.    As the dhurra is sown in parallel rows about 3 feet apart, and the  ground was perfectly flat, there was no difficulty in approaching the  direction whence the cracking of the dhurra could be distinctly heard.  The elephants appeared to be feeding towards us with considerable  rapidity, and in a few minutes I heard the sound of crunching within 50  yards of me. I immediately ran along the clear passage between the tall  stems, and presently saw a black form close to me as it advanced in the  next alley to my own. I do not think I was more than 4 or 5 yards from  it when it suddenly turned its head to the right, and I immediately took  a shot behind the ear. I had a white paper sight upon the muzzle of the  large rifle (No. 10), which was plainly distinguished in the bright  moonlight, and the elephant fell stone dead without the slightest  struggle.    After some delay from the dispersion of my men who carried spare guns, I  re-loaded, and followed in the direction which the herd had taken.    Although upon the \"qui vive,\" they had not retreated far, as they were  unaccustomed to guns, and they were determined to enjoy their supper  after the long march of 20 miles to the attractive dhurra fields. I came  up with them about three-quarters of a mile from the first shot; here  there was the limit of cultivation, and all was wild prairie land; they  had retreated by the way they had arrived, with the intention, no doubt,  of returning again to the dhurra when the disturbing cause should have  disappeared. I could see the herd distinctly as they stood in a compact  body numbering some ten or twelve animals. The only chance was to run  straight at them in order to get as near as possible before they should  start, as I expected they would, in panic. Accordingly I ran forward,  when, to my surprise, two elephants rushed towards me, and I was obliged  to fire right and left. One fell to the ground for a moment, but  recovered; the other made no sign, except by whirling round and joining  the herd in full retreat.    That night I used a double-barrel muzzle-loader (No. 10), with conical  bullet made of 12 parts lead, 1 part quicksilver, 7 drams of powder.    Some days later we heard native reports concerning an elephant that had  been seen badly wounded, and very lame.    Forty-two days after this incident I had moved camp to a place called  Geera, 22 miles distant. It was a wild uninhabited district at that time  on the banks of the Settite river, with the most impervious jungle of  hooked thorns, called by the Arabs \"kittul.\" This tree does not grow  higher than twenty-five feet, but it spreads to a very wide flat-topped  head, the branches are thick, the wood immensely strong and hard, while  the thorns resemble fish-hooks minus the barb. This impenetrable asylum  was the loved resort of elephants, and it was from this particular  station that they made their nocturnal raids upon the cultivated  district more than 20 miles distant in a direct line.    We slept out that night upon the sandy bed of a small stream, which at  that season of great heat had evaporated. Upon waking on the following  morning we found the blankets wet through with the heavy dew, and the  pillows soaking. Having arranged the camp, I left Lady Baker to give the  necessary orders, while I took my rifles and a few good men for a  reconnaissance of the neighbourhood.    The river ran through cliffs of rose-coloured limestone; this soon  changed to white; and we proceeded down stream examining the sandy  portions of the bed for tracks of game that might have passed during the  preceding night. After about a mile we came upon tracks of elephants,  which had apparently come down to drink at our side of the river, and  had then returned, I felt sure, to the thorny asylum named Tuleet.    There was no other course to pursue but to follow on the tracks; this we  did until we arrived at the formidable covert to which I have alluded.  It was impossible to enter this except at certain places where wild  animals had formed a narrow lane, and in one of these by-ways we  presently found ourselves, sometimes creeping, sometimes walking, but  generally adhering firmly every minute to some irrepressible branch of  hooked thorns, which gave us a pressing invitation to \"wait a bit.\" In  a short time we found evident signs that the elephants were near at  hand.

I accordingly went towards him with the intention of  seizing him; but he, being backed by upwards of forty men, had the  impertinence to attack me, rushing forward with a fury that was  ridiculous. To stop his blow, and to knock him into the middle of the  crowd, was not difficult; and after a rapid repetition of the dose, I  disabled him, and seizing him by the throat, I called to my vakeel Saati  for a rope to bind him, but in an instant I had a crowd of men upon me  to rescue their leader. How the affair would have ended I cannot say;  but as the scene lay within ten yards of my boat, my wife, who was ill  with fever in the cabin, witnessed the whole affray, and seeing me  surrounded, she rushed out, and in a few moments she was in the middle  of the crowd, who at that time were endeavoring to rescue my prisoner.  Her sudden appearance had a curious effect, and calling upon several of  the least mutinous to assist, she very pluckily made her way up to me.  Seizing the opportunity of an indecision that was for the moment evinced  by the crowd, I shouted to the drummer boy to beat the drum. In an  instant the drum beat, and at the top of my voice I ordered the men to  \"fall in.\" It is curious how mechanically an order is obeyed if given at  the right moment, even in the midst of mutiny. Two-thirds of the men  fell in, and formed in line, while the remainder retreated with the  ringleader, Eesur, whom they led away, declaring that he was badly hurt.  The affair ended in my insisting upon all forming in line, and upon the  ringleader being brought forward. In this critical moment Mrs. Baker,  with great tact, came forward and implored me to forgive him if he  kissed my hand and begged for pardon. This compromise completely won the  men, who, although a few minutes before in open mutiny, now called upon  their ringleader Eesur to apologize, and that all would be right. I made  them rather a bitter speech, and dismissed them.    From that moment I knew that my expedition was fated. This outbreak was  an example of what was to follow. Previous to leaving Khartoum I had  felt convinced that I could not succeed with such villains for escort as  these Khartoumers: thus I had applied to the Egyptian authorities for a  few troops, but had been refused. I was now in an awkward position. All  my men had received five months' wages in advance, according to the  custom of the White Nile; thus I had no control over them. There were no  Egyptian authorities in Gondokoro; it was a nest of robbers; and my men  had just exhibited so pleasantly their attachment to me, and their  fidelity. There was no European beyond Gondokoro, thus I should be the  only white man among this colony of wolves; and I had in perspective a  difficult and uncertain path, where the only chance of success lay in  the complete discipline of my escort, and the perfect organization of  the expedition. After the scene just enacted I felt sure that my escort  would give me more cause for anxiety than the acknowledged hostility of  the natives.    I made arrangements with a Circassian trader, Koorshid Aga, for the  purchase of a few oxen, and a fat beast was immediately slaughtered for  the men. They were shortly in the best humour, feasting upon masses of  flesh cut in strips and laid for a few minutes upon the embers, while  the regular meal was being prepared. They were now almost affectionate,  vowing that they would follow me to the end of the world; while the late  ringleader, in spite of his countenance being rather painted in the late  row, declared that no man would be so true as himself, and that every  \"arrow should pass through him before it should reach me\" in the event  of a conflict with the natives. A very slight knowledge of human nature  was required to foresee the future with such an escort:--if love and  duty were dependent upon full bellies, mutiny and disorder would appear  with hard fare. However, by having parade every morning at a certain  hour, I endeavoured to establish a degree of regularity. I had been  waiting at Gondokoro twelve days, expecting the arrival of Debono's  party from the south, with whom I wished to return. Suddenly, on the  15th February, I heard the rattle of musketry at a great distance, and a  dropping fire from the south. To give an idea of the moment I must  extract verbatim from my journal as written at the time.    \"Guns firing in the distance; Debono's ivory porters arriving, for whom  I have waited. My men rushed madly to my boat, with the report that two  white men were with them who had come from the SEA! Could they be Speke  and Grant? Off I ran, and soon met them in reality. Hurrah for old  England! they had come from the Victoria N'yanza, from which the Nile  springs .... The mystery of ages solved. With my pleasure of meeting  them is the one disappointment, that I had not met them farther on the  road in my search for them; however, the satisfaction is, that my  previous arrangements had been such as would have insured my finding  them had they been in a fix .... My projected route would have brought  me vis-a-vis with them, as they had come from the lake by the course I  had proposed to take .... All my men perfectly mad with excitement:  firing salutes as usual with ball cartridge, they shot one of my  donkeys; a melancholy sacrifice as an offering at the completion of this  geographical discovery.\"    When I first met them they were walking along the bank of the river  towards my boats. At a distance of about a hundred yards I recognised my  old friend Speke, and with a heart beating with joy I took off my cap  and gave a welcome hurrah! as I ran towards him. For the moment he did  not recognize me; ten years' growth of beard and moustache had worked a  change; and as I was totally unexpected, my sudden appearance in the  center of Africa appeared to him incredible. I hardly required an  introduction to his companion, as we felt already acquainted, and after  the transports of this happy meeting we walked together to my diahbiah;  my men surrounding us with smoke and noise by keeping up an unremitting  fire of musketry the whole way. We were shortly seated on deck under the  awning, and such rough fare as could be hastily prepared was set before  these two ragged, careworn specimens of African travel, whom I looked  upon with feelings of pride as my own countrymen. As a good ship arrives  in harbor, battered and torn by a long and stormy voyage, yet sound in  her frame and seaworthy to the last, so both these gallant travelers  arrived at Gondokoro. Speke appeared the more worn of the two; he was  excessively lean, but in reality he was in good tough condition; he had  walked the whole way from Zanzibar, never having once ridden during that  wearying march. Grant was in honourable rags; his bare knees projecting  through the remnants of trowsers that were an exhibition of rough  industry in tailor's work. He was looking tired and feverish, but both  men had a fire in the eye that showed the spirit that had led them  through.    They wished to leave Gondokoro as soon as possible, en route for  England, but delayed their departure until the moon should be in a  position for an observation for determining the longitude. My boats were  fortunately engaged by me for five months, thus Speke and Grant could  take charge of them to Khartoum.    At the first blush on meeting them I had considered my expedition as  terminated by having met them, and by their having accomplished the  discovery of the Nile source; but upon my congratulating them with all  my heart, upon the honour they had so nobly earned, Speke and Grant with  characteristic candour and generosity gave me a map of their route,  showing that they had been unable to complete the actual exploration of  the Nile, and that a most important portion still remained to be  determined. It appeared that in N. lat. 2 degrees 17 minutes, they had  crossed the Nile, which they had tracked from the Victoria Lake; but the  river, which from its exit from that lake had a northern course, turned  suddenly to the WEST from Karuma Falls (the point at which they crossed  it at lat. 2 degrees 17 minutes). They did not see the Nile again until  they arrived in N. lat. 3 deg. 32 min., which was then flowing from the  W.S.W. The natives and the King of Unyoro (Kamrasi) had assured them  that the Nile from the Victoria N'yanza, which they had crossed at  Karuma, flowed westward for several days' journey, and at length fell  into a large lake called the Luta N'zige; that this lake came from the  south, and that the Nile on entering the northern extremity almost  immediately made its exit, and as a navigable river continued its course  to the north, through the Koshi and Madi countries. Both Speke and Grant  attached great importance to this lake Luta N'zige, and the former was  much annoyed that it had been impossible for them to carry out the  exploration. He foresaw that stay-at-home geographers, who, with a  comfortable armchair to sit in, travel so easily with their fingers on a  map, would ask him why he had not gone from such a place to such a  place? why he had not followed the Nile to the Luta N'zige lake, and  from the lake to Gondokoro? As it happened, it was impossible for Speke  and Grant to follow the Nile from Karuma:--the tribes were fighting  with Kamrasi, and no strangers could have got through the country.  Accordingly they procured their information most carefully, completed  their map, and laid down the reported lake in its supposed position,  showing the Nile as both influent and effluent precisely as had been  explained by the natives."]]]
