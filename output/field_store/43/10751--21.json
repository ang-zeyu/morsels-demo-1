[12] _Register_; a Term taken from the different Stops of an Organ.    [13] The Pitch of _Lombardy_ or _Venice_, is something more than half a  Tone higher than at _Rome_.    [14] A _Messa di Voce_ is the holding out and swelling a Note. Vide Pl.  I. Numb. 4. This being a Term of Art, it is necessary to use it, as well  as _Piano_ for soft, and _Forte_ for loud. _N.B._ Our Author recommends  here to use any Grace sparingly, which he does in several other Places,  and with Reason; for the finest Grace too often repeated grows tiresome.    [15] See for _Appoggiatura_ in the next Chapter.    [16] This Chapter contains some Enquiries into Matters of Curiosity, and  demands a little Attention. The Reader therefore is desired to postpone  it to the last.    [17] _Appoggiatura_ is a Word to which the _English_ Language has not an  Equivalent; it is a Note added by the Singer, for the arriving more  gracefully to the following Note, either in rising or falling, as is  shewn by the Examples in Notes of Musick, Pl. II. Numb. 2. The _French_  express it by two different Terms, _Port de Voix_ and _Appuyer_; as the  _English_ do by a _Prepare_ and a _Lead_. The Word _Appoggiatura_ is  derived from _Appoggiare_ to lean on. In this Sense, you lean on the  first to arrive at the Note intended, rising or falling; and you dwell  longer on the Preparation, than the Note for which the Preparation is  made, and according to the Value of the Note. The same in a Preparation  to a Shake, or a Beat from the Note below. No _Appoggiatura_ can be made  at the Beginning of a Piece; there must be a Note preceding, from whence  it leads.    [18] Here begins the Examination of the _Semitones Major and Minor_,  which he promised in Sec. 15. Ch. 1. It may be of Satisfaction to the  Studious, to set this Matter at once in a true Light; by which our  Author's Doubts will be cleared, and his Reasoning the easier  understood. A _Semitone Major_ changes Name, Line, and Space: _A  Semitone_ Minor changes neither. Pl. II. Numb. 1. To a _Semitone Major_  one can go with a Rise or _a_ Fall distinctly; to a _Semitone Minor_ one  cannot _N.B._ From a _Tone Minor_ the _Appoggiatura_ is better and  easier than from a _Tone Major_.    [19] These are all _Tones Major_ and _Minor_, and _Semitones Major_. Pl.  II. Numb. 2.    [20] Because they are _Semitones Major_. Pl. II. Numb. 3.    [21] Because they are _Semitones Major_. Pl. II. Numb. 4.    [22] Because they are all _Semitones Minor_, which may be known by the  abovementioned Rule, of their not changing Name, Line, nor Space. Pl.  II. Numb. 5. and which makes it manifest, that a _Semitone Minor_ cannot  bear an _Appoggiatura_.    [23] For the same Reason, these being _Semitones Minor_. Pl. II. Numb.  6.    [24] Because one is a _Semitone Major_, and the other a _Semitone  Minor_. Pl. III. Numb. 7.    [25] Because they are _Semitones Minor_. Pl. III, Numb. 8.    [26] The _Tone_, or _Mood_, you are in, will determine which is a _Tone  Major_ or _Minor_; for if you change the _Mood_ or _Tone_, that which  was the _Tone Major_ may become the _Tone Minor_, and so _Vice Versa_:  Therefore these two Examples from _C_ to _D_, and from _F_ to _G_, do  not hold true.    [27] His Perplexity comes from a wrong Notion, in not distinguishing  those two _Semitones_.    [28] All Intervals, rising with an _Appoggiatura_, arise to the Note  with a sort of _Beat_, more or less: and the same, descending, arrive to  the Note with a sort of _Shake_, more or less. Pl. III. Numb. 9, 10. One  cannot agreeably ascend or descend the Interval of a third _Major_ or  _Minor_, Pl. III. Numb 11. But gradually very well. Pl. III. Numb. 12.  Examples of false or deceitful Intervals. Pl. III. Numb. 13.    [29] So in all Cases where the Interval is deceitful. Pl. III. Numb. 14.  With a _Messa di Voce_. Pl. III. Numb. 15. See for _Messa di Voce_,  Chap. I. Sec. 29, and its Note.    [30] In all the modern _Italian_ Compositions the _Appoggiatura's_ are  mark'd, supposing the Singers to be ignorant where to place them. The  _French_ use them for their Lessons on the _Harpsichord_, &c., but  seldom for the Voice.    [31] See for the several Examples of the _Shakes_, Pl. IV.    [32] The first _Shake_ of a _Tone_, Pl.

Numb. 3. _N.B._ Prom the inferior or lower Cadences,  the first, or full, _Tone Shake_, is not always excluded; for in a sharp  Key it is always a _Tone_, and in a flat Key a _Semitone_, Pl. IV. Numb.  3.    [34] The second _Shake_ of a _Semitone Major_, Pl. IV. Numb. 2.    [35] The third the short _Shake_. Pl. IV. Numb. 4.    [36] The fourth the rising _Shake_. Pl. IV. Numb. 5.    [37] The fifth the descending _Shake_. Pl. IV. Numb. 6.    [38] The sixth the slow _Shake_. Pl. IV. Numb. 7.    [39] The seventh the redoubled _Shake_. Pl. IV. Numb. 8.    [40] The eighth the _Trillo-Mordente_, or _Shake_ with a _Beat_. Pl. IV.  Numb. 9.    [41] _Shakes_ are generally proper from preceding Notes descending, but  not ascending, except on particular Occasions. Never too many, or too  near one another; but very bad to begin with them, which is too  frequently done. The using so often _Beats_, _Shakes_, and _Prepares_,  is owing to Lessons on the Lute, Harpsichord, and other Instruments,  whose Sounds discontinue, and therefore have Need of this Help.    [42] The _mark'd Divisions_ should be something like the _Staccato_ on  the Violin, but not too much; against which a Caution will presently be  given.    [43] The _Gliding Notes_ are like several Notes in one Stroke of the Bow  on the Violin.    [44] The pronouncing _Eror_ instead of _Error_; or _Dally_ instead of  _Daly_. The not distinguishing; the double Consonants from the single,  is an Error but too common at present.    [45] See for the _syncopated_, _Ligatura_, or _binding_ Notes, Pl. IV.  Numb. 10.

[52] The Church-Musick in _Italy_ is all in _Latin_, except  _Oratorio's_, which are Entertainments in their Churches. It is  therefore necessary to have some Notion of the _Latin_ Tongue.

[56] Suppose the first Part expressed Anger, and the second relented,  and was to express Pity or Compassion, he must be angry again in the _Da  Capo_. This often happens, and is very ridiculous if not done to a real  Purpose, and that the Subject and Poetry require it.    [57] It is supposed, the Scholar is arrived to the Capacity of knowing  Harmony and Counterpoint.    [58] The general dividing of _Airs_ described, to which the Author often  refers.    [59] With due Deference to our Author, it may be feared, that the  Affectation of Singing with Variety has conduced very much to the  introducing a bad Taste.    [60] Continuation of the general dividing _Airs_ in Sec. 4. The End of this  Section is a seasonable Corrective of the Rule prescribed in the  foregoing fifth Section.    [61] _Rivani_, called _Ciecolino_, must have written some Treatise on  Time, which is not come to us, therefore no further Account can be given  of him.    [62] _Pistochi_ was very famous above fifty Years ago, and refined the  Manner of singing in _Italy_, which was then a little crude. His Merit  in this is acknowledged by all his Countrymen, contradicted by none.  Briefly, what is recounted of him, is, that when he first appeared to  the World, and a Youth, he had a very fine treble Voice, admired and  encouraged universally, but by a dissolute Life lost it, and his  Fortune. Being reduced to the utmost Misery, he entered into the Service  of a Composer, as a Copyist, where he made use of the Opportunity of  learning the Rules of Composition, and became a good Proficient. After  some Years, he recovered a little Glimpse of Voice, which by Time and  Practice turned into a fine _Contr'Alto_. Having Experience on his Side,  he took Care of it, and as Encouragement came again, he took the  Opportunity of travelling all _Europe_ over, where hearing the different  Manners and Tastes, he appropriated them to himself, and formed that  agreeable Mixture, which he produced in _Italy_, where he was imitated  and admired. He at last past many Years, when in an affluent Fortune, at  the Court of _Anspach_, where he had a Stipend, and lived an agreeable  easy Life; and at last retired to a Convent in _Italy_. It has been  remark'd, that though several of his Disciples shewed the Improvement  they had from him, yet others made an ill use of it, having not a little  contributed to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2649"],[0,"Captains of the Civil War: A Chronicle of the Blue and the Gray (#17)"],[1,"  The surrender of Fort Henry, coming so soon after Prestonburg and  Logan's Cross Roads, caused great rejoicing in the loyal North. The  victory, effective in itself, was completed by sending the ironclad  _Carondelet_ several miles upstream to destroy the Memphis-Ohio  railway bridge, thus cutting the shortest line from Bowling Green to  the Mississippi. But the action, in which the army took no part,  was only a preliminary skirmish compared with the joint attack of  the fleet and army on Fort Donelson. Fort Donelson was of great  strategic importance. If it held fast, and the Federals were defeated,  then Johnston's line would probably hold from Bowling Green to  Columbus, and the rails, roads, and rivers would remain Confederate  in western Tennessee. If, on the other hand, Fort Donelson fell,  and more especially if its garrison surrendered, then Johnston's  line would have to be withdrawn at once, lest the same fate should  overtake the outflanked remains of it. Both sides understood this  perfectly well; and all concerned looked anxiously to see how the  new Federal commander, General Grant, would face the crisis.      Ulysses Simpson Grant came of sturdy New England stock, being eighth  in descent from Matthew Grant, who landed in 1630 and was Surveyor  of Connecticut for over forty years. Grant's mother was one of  the Simpsons who had been Pennsylvanians for several generations.  His family was therefore as racy of the North as Lee's was of the  South. His great-grandfather and great-granduncle, Noah and Solomon  Grant, held British commissions during the final French-and-Indian  or Seven Years' War (1756-63) when both were killed in the same  campaign. His grandfather Noah served all through the Revolutionary  War. Financial reverses and the death of his grandmother broke up  the family; and his father, Jesse Grant, was given the kindest  of homes by Judge Tod of Ohio. Jesse, being as independent as he  was grateful, turned his energies into the first business at hand,  which happened to be a tannery at Deerfield owned by the father of  that wild enthusiast John Brown. A great reader, an able contributor  to the Western press, and a most public-spirited citizen, Jesse  Grant was a good father to his famous son, who was born on April  27, 1822, at Point Pleasant, Clermont County, Ohio. Young Grant  hated the tannery, but delighted in everything connected with horses;  so he looked after the teams. One day, after swapping horses many  miles from home, he found himself driving a terrified bolter that  he only just managed to stop on the edge of a big embankment. His  grown-up companion, who had no stomach for any more, then changed  into a safe freight wagon. But Ulysses, tying his bandanna over  the runaway's eyes, stuck to the post of danger.    After passing through West Point without any special distinction,  except that he came out first in horsemanship, Grant was disappointed  at not receiving the cavalry commission which he would have greatly  preferred to the infantry one he was given instead. Years later,  when already a rising general, he vainly yearned for a cavalry  brigade. Otherwise he had curiously little taste for military life;  though at West Point he thought the two finest men in the world  were Captain C. F. Smith, the splendidly smart Commandant, and,  even more, that magnificently handsome giant, Winfield Scott, who  came down to inspect the cadets. Some years after having served  with credit all through the Mexican War (when, like Lee, he learnt  so much about so many future friends and foes) he left the army,  not to return till he and Sherman had seen Blair and Lyon take  Camp Jackson. After wisely declining to reënter the service under  the patronage of General John Pope, who was full of self-importance  about his acquaintance with the Union leaders of Illinois, Grant  wrote to the Adjutant-General at Washington offering to command  a regiment. Like Sherman, he felt much more diffident about the  rise from ex-captain of regulars to colonel commanding a battalion  than some mere civilians felt about commanding brigades or directing  the strategy of armies. He has himself recorded his horror of sole  responsibility as he approached what might have been a little  battlefield on which his own battalion would have been pitted against  a Southern one commanded by a Colonel Harris. \"My heart kept getting  higher and higher until it felt as though it was in my throat. I  would have given anything then to have been back in Illinois; but  I had not the moral courage to halt and consider what to do. When  we reached a point from which the valley below was in full view  ... the troops were gone. My heart resumed its place. It occurred  to me at once that Harris had been as much afraid of me as I had  been of him. This was a view of the question I never forgot.\"    Grant's latent powers developed rapidly. Starting with a good stock  of military knowledge he soon added to it in every way he could. He  had the insight of genius. Above all, he had an indomitable will  both in carrying out practicable plans in spite of every obstacle  and in ruthlessly dismissing every one who failed. Not tall, not  handsome, in no way striking at first sight, he looked the leader  born only by reason of his square jaw, keen eye, and determined  expression. Lincoln's conclusive answer to a deputation asking  for Grant's removal simply was, \"he fights.\" And, when mounted on  his splendid charger Cincinnati, Grant even looked what he was--\"a  first-class fighting man.\"      Grant marched straight across the narrow neck of land between the  forts, which were only twelve miles apart. Foote of course had  to go round by the Ohio--fifteen times as far. His vanguard, the  dauntless _Carondelet_, now commanded by Henry Walke, arrived on  the twelfth and fired the first shots at the fort, which stood on  a bluff more than a hundred feet high and mounted fifteen heavy  guns in three tiers of fire. Grant's infantry was already in position  round the Confederate entrenchments; and when his soldiers heard  the naval guns they first gave three rousing cheers and then began  firing hard, lest the sailors should get ahead of them again. Birge's  sharpshooters, the snipers of those days, were particularly keen.  They never drilled as a battalion, but simply assembled in bunches  for orders, when Birge would ask: \"Canteens full? Biscuits for  all day?\" After which he would sing out: \"All right, boys, hunt  your holes\"; and off they would go to stalk the enemy with their  long-range rifles.    Early next morning Grant sent word to Walke that he was establishing  the rest of his batteries and that he was ready to take advantage  of any diversion which the _Carondelet_ could make in his favor.  Walke then fired hard for two hours under cover of a wooded point.  The fort fired back equally hard; but with little effect except  for one big solid shot which stove in a casemate, knocked down a  dozen men, burst the steam heater, and bounded about the engine  room \"like a wild beast pursuing its prey.\" Forty minutes later  the _Carondelet_ was again in action, firing hard till dark. Late  that night Foote arrived with the rest of the flotilla.    The fourteenth was another naval day. Foote's flotilla advanced  gallantly, the four ironclads leading in line abreast, the two  wooden gunboats half a mile astern. The ironclads closed in to less  than a quarter-mile and hung on like bulldogs till the Confederates  in the lowest battery were driven from their guns. But the plunging  fire from the big guns on the bluff crashed down with ever increasing  effect. Davits were smashed like matches, boats knocked into kindling  wood, armor dented, started, ripped, stripped, and sent splashing  overboard as if by strokes of lightning. Before the decks could  be re-sanded there was so much blood on them that the gun crews  could hardly work for slipping. Presently the _Pittsburgh_ swung  round, ran foul of the _Carondelet_, and dropped downstream. The  pilot of the _St. Louis_ was killed, and Foote, who stood beside  him, wounded. The wheel-ropes of the _St. Louis_, like those of  the _Louisville_, were shot away. The whole flotilla then retired,  still firing hard; and the Confederates wired a victory to Richmond.    Both sides now redoubled their efforts; for Donelson was a great  prize and the forces engaged were second only to those at Bull Run.  Afloat and ashore, all ranks and ratings on both sides together,  there were fifty thousand men present at the investment from first  to last. The Confederates began with about twenty thousand, Grant  with fifteen thousand. But Grant had twenty-seven thousand fit for  duty at the end, in spite of all his losses. He was fortunate in  his chief staff officer, the devoted and capable John A. Rawlins,  afterwards a general and Secretary of War. Two of his divisional  commanders, Lew Wallace and, still more, C. F. Smith, the old Commandant  of Cadets, were also first-rate. But the third, McClernand, here  began to follow those distorting ideas which led to his dismissal  later on. The three chief Confederates ranked in reverse order  of efficiency: Floyd first and worst, cantankerous Pillow next,  and Buckner best though last.    The Federal prospect was anything but bright on the evening of  the fourteenth. Foote had just been repulsed; while McClernand had  fought a silly little battle on his own account the day before,  to the delight of the Confederates and the grievous annoyance of  Grant. The fifteenth dawned on a scene of midwinter discomfort  in the Federal lines, where most of the rawest men had neither  great-coats nor blankets, having thrown them away during the short  march from Fort Henry, regardless of the fact that they would have  to bivouac at Donelson. Thus it was in no happy frame of mind that  Grant slithered across the frozen mud to see what Foote proposed;  and, when Foote explained"]]]
