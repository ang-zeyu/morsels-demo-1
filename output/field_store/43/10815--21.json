[common] A hole in the security of a system deliberately left in place     by designers or maintainers. The motivation for such holes is not     always sinister; some operating systems, for example, come out of the     box with privileged accounts intended for use by field service     technicians or the vendor's maintenance programmers. Syn. [926]trap     door; may also be called a `wormhole'. See also [927]iron box,     [928]cracker, [929]worm, [930]logic bomb.       Historically, back doors have often lurked in systems longer than     anyone expected or planned, and a few have become widely known. Ken     Thompson's 1983 Turing Award lecture to the ACM admitted the existence     of a back door in early Unix versions that may have qualified as the     most fiendishly clever security hack of all time. In this scheme, the     C compiler contained code that would recognize when the `login'     command was being recompiled and insert some code recognizing a     password chosen by Thompson, giving him entry to the system whether or     not an account had been created for him.       Normally such a back door could be removed by removing it from the     source code for the compiler and recompiling the compiler. But to     recompile the compiler, you have to use the compiler -- so Thompson     also arranged that the compiler would recognize when it was compiling     a version of itself, and insert into the recompiled compiler the code     to insert into the recompiled `login' the code to allow Thompson entry     -- and, of course, the code to recognize itself and do the whole thing     again the next time around! And having done this once, he was then     able to recompile the compiler from the original sources; the hack     perpetuated itself invisibly, leaving the back door in place and     active but with no trace in the sources.       The talk that suggested this truly moby hack was published as     \"Reflections on Trusting Trust\", \"Communications of the ACM 27\", 8     (August 1984), pp. 761-763 (text available at     [931]http://www.acm.org/classics). Ken Thompson has since confirmed     that this hack was implemented and that the Trojan Horse code did     appear in the login binary of a Unix Support group machine. Ken says     the crocked compiler was never distributed. Your editor has heard two     separate reports that suggest that the crocked login did make it out     of Bell Labs, notably to BBN, and that it enabled at least one     late-night login across the network by someone using the login name     `kt'.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:backbone cabal, Next:[932]backbone site, Previous:[933]back door,     Up:[934]= B =       backbone cabal n.       A group of large-site administrators who pushed through the [935]Great     Renaming and reined in the chaos of [936]Usenet during most of the     1980s. During most of its lifetime, the Cabal (as it was sometimes     capitalized) steadfastly denied its own existence; it was almost     obligatory for anyone privy to their secrets to respond \"There is no     Cabal\" whenever the existence or activities of the group were     speculated on in public.       The result of this policy was an attractive aura of mystery. Even a     decade after the cabal [937]mailing list disbanded in late 1988     following a bitter internal catfight, many people believed (or claimed     to believe) that it had not actually disbanded but only gone deeper     underground with its power intact.       This belief became a model for various paranoid theories about various     Cabals with dark nefarious objectives beginning with taking over the     Usenet or Internet. These paranoias were later satirized in ways that     took on a life of their own. See [938]Eric Conspiracy for one example.

The spores are produced on slender threads  springing from the inner wall of the perithecium, and, when mature, are  expelled from an orifice at the apex. This is the normal condition, to  which there are some exceptions. In the _Melanconiei_, there is no  true perithecium, but the spores are produced in like manner upon a kind  of stroma or cushion formed from the mycelium, and, when mature, are  expelled through a rupture of the cuticle beneath which they are  generated, often issuing in long gelatinous tendrils. Here, again,  the majority of what were formerly regarded as distinct species have  been found, or suspected, to be forms of higher fungi. The _Torulacei_  represent the superficial fungi of this family, and these consist of a  more or less developed mycelium, which gives rise to fertile threads,  which, by constriction and division, mature into moniliform chains  of spores. The species mostly appear as blackish velvety patches or  stains on the stems of herbaceous plants and on old weathered wood.    Much interest attaches to the other sub-family of _Coniomycetes_, in which  the species are produced for the most part on living plants. So much  has been discovered during recent years of the polymorphism which  subsists amongst the species in this section, that any detailed  classification can only be regarded as provisional. Hence we shall  proceed here upon the supposition that we are dealing with autonomous  species. In the first place, we must recognize a small section in which  a kind of cellular peridium is present. This is the _AEcidiacei_, or order  of \"cluster cups.\" The majority of species are very beautiful objects  under the microscope; the peridia are distinctly cellular, and white or  pallid, produced beneath the cuticle, through which they burst, and,  rupturing at the apex, in one genus in a stellate manner, so that the  teeth, becoming reflexed, resemble delicate fringed cups, with the  orange, golden, brown, or whitish spores or pseudospores nestling in the  interior.[J] These pseudospores are at first produced in chains, but  ultimately separate. In many cases these cups are either accompanied or  preceded by spermogonia. In two other orders there is no peridium. In the  _Caeomacei_, the pseudospores are more or less globose or ovate, sometimes  laterally compressed and simple; and in _Pucciniaei_, they are elongated,  often subfusiform and septate. In both, the pseudospores are produced  in tufts or clusters _direct from the mycelium. The Caeomacei_ might  again be subdivided into _Ustilagines_[K] and _Uredines_.[L] In the  former, the pseudospores are mostly dingy brown or blackish, and in the  latter more brightly coloured, often yellowish. The _Ustilagines_  include the smuts and bunt of corn-plants, the _Uredines_ include the  red rusts of wheat and grasses. In some of the species included in the  latter, two forms of fruit are found. In _Melampsora_, the summer  pseudospores are yellow, globose, and were formerly classed as a species  of _Lecythea_, whilst the winter pseudospores are brownish, elongated,  wedge-shaped by compression, and compact. The _Pucciniaei_[M] differ  primarily in the septate pseudospores, which in one genus (_Puccinia_) are  uniseptate; in _Triphragmium_, they are biseptate; in _Phragmidium_,  multiseptate; and in _Xenodochus_, moniliform, breaking up into  distinct articulations. It is probable that, in all of these, as is  known to be the case in most, the septate pseudospores are preceded or  accompanied by simple pseudospores, to which they are mysteriously  related. There is still another, somewhat singular, group usually  associated with the _Pucciniaei_, in which the septate pseudospores are  immersed in gelatin, so that in many features the species seem to  approach the _Tremellini_. This group includes two or three genera, the  type of which will be found in _Podisoma_.[N] These fungi are parasitic on  living junipers in Britain and North America, appearing year after year  upon the same gouty swellings of the branches, in clavate or horn-shaped  gelatinous processes of a yellowish or orange colour. Anomalous as it  may at first sight appear to include these tremelloid forms with the  dust-like fungi, their relations will on closer examination be more fully  appreciated, when the form of pseudospores, mode of germination, and  other features are taken into consideration, especially when compared with  _Podisoma Ellisii_, already alluded to. This family is technically  characterized as,--    _Distinct hymenium none. Pseudospores either solitary or concatenate,  produced on the tips of generally short threads, which are either  naked or contained in a perithecium, rarely compacted into a  gelatinous mass, at length producing minute spores_ = CONIOMYCETES.    The last family of the sporifera is _Hyphomycetes_, in which the  threads are conspicuously developed. These are what are more  commonly called \"moulds,\" including some of the most elegant and  delicate of microscopic forms. It is true of many of these, as well  as of the _Coniomycetes_, that they are only conidial forms of  higher fungi; but there will remain a very large number of species  which, as far as present knowledge extends, must be accepted as  autonomous. In this family, we may again recognize three subdivisions,  in one of which the threads are more or less compacted into a common  stem, in another the threads are free, and in the third the threads  can scarcely be distinguished from the mycelium. It is this latter  group which unites the _Hyphomycetes_ with the _Coniomycetes_, the  affinities being increased by the great profusion with which the  spores are developed. The first group, in which the fertile threads  are united so as to form a compound stem, consists of two small  orders, the _Isariacei_ and the _Stilbacei_, in the former of which  the spores are dry, and in the latter somewhat gelatinous. Many of  the species closely imitate forms met with in the _Hymenomycetes_,  such as _Clavaria_; and, in the genus _Isaria_, it is almost beyond  doubt that the species found on dead insects, moths, spiders,  flies, ants, &c., are merely the conidiophores of species of  _Torrubia_.[O]    The second group is by far the largest, most typical, and attractive  in this family. It contains the black moulds and white moulds,  technically known as the _Dematiei_ and the _Mucedines_. In the first,  the threads are more or less corticated, that is, the stem has a  distinct investing membrane, which peels off like a bark; and the  threads, often also the spores, are dark-coloured, as if charred or  scorched. In many cases, the spores are highly developed, large,  multiseptate, and nucleate, and seldom are spores and threads  colourless or of bright tints. In the _Mucedines_, on the contrary,  the threads are never coated, seldom dingy, mostly white or of pure  colours, and the spores have less a tendency to extra development or  multiplex septation. In some genera, as in _Peronospora_ for  instance,[P] a secondary fruit is produced in the form of resting  spores from the mycelium; and these generate zoospores as well as the  primary spores, similar to those common in _Algae_. This latter genus  is very destructive to growing plants, one species being the chief  agent in the potato disease, and another no less destructive to crops  of onions. The vine disease is produced by a species of _Oidium_,  which is also classed with _Mucedines_, but which is really the  conidiiferous form of _Erysiphe_. In other genera, the majority of  species are developed on decaying plants, so that, with the exception  of the two genera mentioned, the _Hyphomycetes_ exert a much less  baneful influence on vegetation than the _Coniomycetes_. The last  section, including the _Sepedoniei_, has been already cited as  remarkable for the suppression of the threads, which are scarcely to  be distinguished from the mycelium; the spores are profuse, nestling  on the floccose mycelium; whilst in the _Trichodermacei_, the spores  are invested by the threads, as if enclosed in a sort of false  peridium. A summary of the characters of the family may therefore be  thus briefly expressed:--    _Filamentous; fertile threads naked, for the most part free or loosely  compacted, simple or branched, bearing the spores at their apices,  rarely more closely packed, so as to form a distinct common stem_ =  HYPHOMYCETES.    [Illustration: FIG. 40.--_Rhopalomyces candidus._]    Having thus disposed of the _Sporifera_, we must advert to the two  families of _Sporidiifera_. As more closely related to the _Hyphomycetes_,  the first of these to be noticed is the _Physomycetes_, in which there  is no proper hymenium, and the threads proceeding from the mycelium bear  vesicles containing an indefinite number of sporidia. The fertile threads  are either free or only slightly felted. In the order _Antennariei_, the  threads are black and moniliform, more or less felted, bearing irregular  sporangia. A common fungus named _Zasmidium cellare_, found in cellars,  and incrusting old wine bottles, as with a blackened felt, belongs to  this order. The larger and more highly-developed order, _Mucorini_,  differs in the threads, which are simple or branched, being free, erect,  and bearing the sporangia at the tips of the thread, or branches. Some of  the species bear great external resemblance to _Mucedines_ until the  fruit is examined, when the fructifying heads, commonly globose or ovate,  are found to be delicate transparent vesicles, enclosing a large number  of minute sporidia; when mature, the sporangia burst and the sporidia  are set free. In some species, it has long been known that a sort of  conjugation takes place between opposite threads, which results in the  formation of a sporangium.[Q] None of these species are destructive to  vegetation, appearing only upon decaying, and not upon living, plants.
