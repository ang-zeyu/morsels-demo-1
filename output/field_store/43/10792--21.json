In our own day  more than three hundred thousand stars have been catalogued in the Bonn  Durchmusterung; and the great International Photographic Chart of the  Heavens will probably show not less than fifty millions of stars, and in  this it has limited itself to stars exceeding the fourteenth magnitude  in brightness, thus leaving out of its pages many millions of stars that  are visible through our more powerful telescopes.    So when Abraham, Moses, Job or Jeremiah speaks of the host of heaven  that cannot be numbered, it does not mean simply that these men had but  small powers of numeration. To us,--who can count beyond that which we  can conceive,--as to the Psalmist, it is a sign of infinite power,  wisdom and knowledge that \"He telleth the number of the stars; He  calleth them all by their names.\"    Isaiah describes the Lord as \"He that sitteth upon the circle of the  earth, . . . that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth  them out as a tent to dwell in.\" And many others of the prophets use the  same simile of a curtain which we have seen to be so appropriate to the  appearance of the starry sky. Nowhere, however, have we any indication  whether or not they considered the stars were all set _on_ this curtain,  that is to say were all at the same distance from us. We now know that  they are not equidistant from us, but this we largely base on the fact  that the stars are of very different orders of brightness, and we judge  that, on an average, the fainter a star appears, the further is it  distant from us. To the Hebrews, as to us, it was evident that the stars  differ in magnitude, and the writer of the Epistle to the Corinthians  expressed this when he wrote--         \"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon,       and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from       another star in glory.\"    The ancient Greek astronomers divided the stars according to their  brightness into six classes, or six \"magnitudes,\" to use the modern  technical term. The average star of any particular magnitude gives about  two and a half times as much light as the average star of the next  magnitude. More exactly, the average first magnitude star gives one  hundred times the light of the average star of the sixth magnitude.    In a few instances we have been able to measure, in the very roughest  degree, the distances of stars; not a hundred stars have their  parallaxes known, and these have all been measured in the course of the  last century. And so far away are these stars, even the nearest of them,  that we do not express their distance from us in millions of miles; we  express it in the time that their light takes in travelling from them to  us. Now it takes light only one second to traverse 186,300 miles, and  yet it requires four and a third years for the light from the nearest  star to reach us. This is a star of the first magnitude, Alpha in the  constellation of the Centaur. The next nearest star is a faint one of  between the seventh and eighth magnitudes, and its light takes seven  years to come. From a sixth magnitude star in the constellation of the  Swan, the light requires eight years; and from Sirius, the brightest  star in the heavens, light requires eight and a half years. These four  stars are the nearest to us; from no other star, that we know of, does  light take less than ten years to travel; from the majority of those  whose distance we have succeeded in measuring, the light takes at least  twenty years.    To get some conception of what a \"light-year\" means, let us remember  that light could travel right round the earth at its equator seven times  in the space of a single second, and that there are 31,556,925 seconds  in a year. Light then could girdle the earth a thousand million times  whilst it comes from Alpha Centauri. Or we may put it another way. The  distance from Alpha Centauri exceeds the equator of the earth by as much  as this exceeds an inch and a half; or by as much as the distance from  London to Manchester exceeds the hundredth of an inch.    Of all the rest of the innumerable stars, as far as actual measurement  is concerned, for us, as for the Hebrews, they might all actually lie on  the texture of a curtain, at practically the same distance from us.    We have measured the distances of but a very few stars; the rest--as  every one of them was for the Hebrew--are at a greater distance than any  effort of ours can reach, be our telescopes ever so great and powerful,  our measuring instruments ever so precise and delicate. For them, as for  us, the heaven of stars is \"for height,\" for a height which is beyond  measure and therefore the only fitting image for the immensity of God.    So Zophar the Naamathite said--         \"Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?        It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do?\"    and Eliphaz the Temanite reiterated still more strongly--         \"Is not God in the height of heaven?        And behold the height of the stars, how high they are.\"    God Himself is represented as using the expanse of heaven as a measure  of the greatness of his fidelity and mercy. The prophet Jeremiah  writes--         \"Thus saith the Lord; if Heaven above can be measured, and the       foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also       cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done,       saith the Lord.\"    As if he were using the figure of a great cross, whose height was that  of the heavens, whose arms stretched from east to west, David testifies  of the same mercy and forgiveness:--         \"For as the heaven is high above the earth,        So great is His mercy toward them that fear Him.        As far as the east is from the west,        So far hath He removed our transgressions from us.\"      [Illustration: THE GREAT COMET OF 1843.    \"Running like a road through the constellations\" (_see_ p. 105).]          CHAPTER IX    COMETS      Great comets are almost always unexpected visitors. There is only one  great comet that we know has been seen more than once, and expect with  reasonable certainty to see again. This is Halley's comet, which has  been returning to a near approach to the sun at somewhat irregular  intervals of seventy-five to seventy-eight years during the last  centuries: indeed, it is possible that it was this comet that was  coincident with the invasion of England by William the Conqueror.    There are other small comets that are also regular inhabitants of the  solar system; but, as with Halley's comet, so with these, two  circumstances are to be borne in mind. First, that each successive  revolution round the sun involves an increasing degradation of their  brightness, since there is a manifest waste of their material at each  near approach to the sun; until at length the comet is seen no more, not  because it has left the warm precincts of the sun for the outer  darkness, but because it has spent its substance. Halley's comet was not  as brilliant or as impressive in 1835 as it was in 1759: in 1910 it may  have become degraded to an appearance of quite the second order.    Next, we have no knowledge, no evidence, that any of these comets have  always been members of the solar family. Some of them, indeed, we know  were adopted into it by the influence of one or other of the greater  planets: Uranus we know is responsible for the introduction of one,  Jupiter of a considerable number. The vast majority of comets, great or  small, seem to blunder into the solar system anyhow, anywhere, from any  direction: they come within the attractive influence of the sun; obey  his laws whilst within that influence; make one close approach to him,  passing rapidly across our sky; and then depart in an orbit which will  never bring them to his neighbourhood again. Some chance of direction,  some compelling influence of a planet that it may have approached, so  modified the path of Halley's comet when it first entered the solar  system, that it has remained a member ever since, and may so remain  until it has ceased to be a comet at all.    It follows, therefore, that, as to the number of great comets that may  be seen in any age, we can scarcely even apply the laws of probability.  During the last couple of thousand years, since chronicles have been  abundant, we know that many great comets have been seen. We may suppose,  therefore, that during the preceding age, that in which the Scriptures  were written, there were also many great comets seen, but we do not  know. And most emphatically we are not able to say, from our knowledge  of comets themselves and of their motions, that in the days of this or  that writer a comet was flaming in the sky.    If a comet had been observed in those ages we might not recognize the  description of it. Thus in the fourth year of the 101st Olympiad, the  Greeks were startled by a celestial portent. They did not draw fine  distinctions, and posterity might have remained ignorant that the  terrifying object was possibly a comet, had not Aristotle, who saw it as  a boy at Stagira, left a rather more scientifically worded description  of it. It flared up from the sunset sky with a narrow definite tail  running \"like a road through the constellations.\" In recent times the  great comet of 1843 may be mentioned as having exactly such an  appearance.    So we cannot expect to find in the Scriptures definite and precise  descriptions that we can recognize as those of comets. At the most we  may find some expressions, some descriptions, that to us may seem  appropriate to the forms and appearances of these objects, and we may  therefore infer that the appearance of a comet may have suggested these  descriptions or expressions.    The head of a great comet is brilliant, sometimes starlike. But its tail  often takes on the most impressive appearance.

Under a proper spirit of  modification it has done, and will continue to do, essential service  to the cause of English literature. It guided the taste, and  strengthened the judgment, of Tyrwhitt in his researches after  Chaucerian lore. It stimulated the studies of Farmer and of Steevens,  and enabled them to twine many a beauteous flower round the brow of  their beloved Shakespeare. It has since operated, to the same effect,  in the labours of Mr. Douce,[68] the _Porson_ of old English and  French literature; and in the editions of Milton and Spenser, by my  amiable and excellent friend Mr. Todd the public have had a specimen  of what the _Black Letter_ may perform, when temperately and skilfully  exercised.         [Footnote 68: In the criticisms on Mr. Douce's       _Illustrations of Shakspeare and Ancient Manners_, it has       not, I think, been generally noticed that this work is       distinguished; 1. For the singular diffidence and urbanity       of criticism, as well as depth of learning, which it       evinces: 2. For the happy illustrations, by means of wood       cuts: Let any one, for instance, read a laboured       disquisition on the punishment of \"the boots\"--and only       glance his eye on the plate representing it [vol. i. p.       34.]: from which will he obtain the clearer notions? 3. For       the taste, elegance, and general correctness with which it       is printed. The only omission I regret is that Mr. Douce did       not give us, at the end, a list of the works alphabetically       arranged, with their dates which he consulted in the       formation of his own. Such a BIBLIOTHECA SHAKSPEARIANA       might, however, have been only a fresh stimulus to the       increase of the black-letter symptom of the _Bibliomania_.       How Bartholomaeus and Batman have risen in price since the       publication of Mr. Douce's work, let those who have lately       smarted for the increase tell!]    I could bring to your recollection other instances; but your own  copious reading and exact memory will better furnish you with them.  Let me not however omit remarking that the beautiful pages of the  _Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, and Sir Trestrem_, exhibit, in the  notes [now and then thickly studded with black letter references], a  proof that the author of \"The Lay\" and \"Marmion\" has not disdained to  enrich his stores of information by such intelligence as black  lettered books impart. In short, though this be also a strong and  general symptom of the Bibliomania, it is certainly not attended with  injurious effects when regulated by prudence and discretion. An  undistinguishable voracious appetite, to swallow every thing printed  in the black letter can only bring on inconquerable disease, if not  death, to the patient!    Having in the two preceding divisions of this letter discoursed  somewhat largely upon the HISTORY and SYMPTOMS of the Bibliomania, it  now remains, according to the original plan, to say a few words upon  the PROBABLE MEANS OF ITS CURE. And, indeed, I am driven to this view  of the subject from every laudable motive; for it would be highly  censurable to leave any reflecting mind impressed with melancholy  emotions concerning the misery and mortality that have been occasioned  by the abuse of those pursuits, to which the most soothing and  important considerations ought to be attached. Far from me, and my  friends, be such a cruel, if not criminal, conduct; let us then, my  dear Sir, seriously discourse upon the    III. PROBABLE MEANS OF THE CURE of the Bibliomania. _He_ will surely  be numbered among the philanthropists of his day who has, more  successfully than myself, traced and described the ravages of this  disease, and fortified the sufferer with the means of its cure. But,  as this is a disorder of quite a recent date, and as its  characteristics, in consequence, cannot be yet fully known or  described, great candour must be allowed to that physician who offers  a prescription for so obscure and complicated a case. It is in vain  that you search the works [ay, even the best editions] of Hippocrates  and Galen for a description of this malady; nor will you find it  hinted at in the more philosophical treatises of Sydenham and  Heberden. It had, till the medical skill of Dr. Ferriar first noticed  it to the public, escaped the observations of all our pathologists.  With a trembling hand, and fearful apprehension, therefore, I throw  out the following suggestions for the cure, or mitigatiou  [Transcriber's Note: mitigation], of this disorder:    In _the first place_, the disease of the Bibliomania is materially  softened, or rendered mild, by directing our studies to _useful and  profitable_ works--whether these be printed upon small or large paper,  in the gothic, roman, or italic type; To consider purely the  _intrinsic_ excellence, and not the exterior splendour, or  adventitious value, of any production, will keep us perhaps wholly  free from this disease. Let the midnight lamp be burnt to illuminate  the stores of antiquity--whether they be romances, or chronicles, or  legends, and whether they be printed by Aldus or by Caxton--if a  brighter lustre can thence be thrown upon the pages of modern  learning! To trace genius to its source, or to see how she has been  influenced or modified, by \"the lore of past times\" is both a pleasing  and profitable pursuit. To see how Shakspeare has here and there  plucked a flower, from some old ballad or popular tale, to enrich his  own unperishable garland--to follow Spenser and Milton in their  delightful labyrinths 'midst the splendour of Italian literature--are  studies which stamp a dignity upon our intellectual characters! But,  in such a pursuit let us not overlook the wisdom of modern times, nor  fancy that what is only ancient can be excellent. We must remember  that Bacon, Boyle, Locke, Taylor, Chillingworth, Robertson, Hume,  Gibbon, and Paley, are names which always command attention from the  wise, and remind us of the improved state of reason and acquired  knowledge during the two last centuries.    In the _second place_, the re-printing of scarce and intrinsically  valuable works is another means of preventing the propagation of this  disorder. Amidst all our present sufferings under the BIBLIOMANIA, it  is some consolation to find discerning and spirited booksellers  re-publishing the valuable Chronicles of Froissart, Holinshed, and  Hall,[69] and the collections known by the names of \"The Harleian  Miscellany,\" and \"Lord Somer's Tracts.\" These are noble efforts, and  richly deserve the public patronage.         [Footnote 69: The re-publication of these chronicles is to       be followed by those of Grafton and Fabian. Meanwhile,       Hakluyt's Voyages, (projected by Mr. Evans), and Fuller's       Worthies (by Messrs. Longman, and Co.) will form admirable       acquisitions to these treasures of past times.]    In the _third place_, the editing of our best ancient authors, whether  in prose or poetry,[70] is another means of effectually counteracting  the progress of the Bibliomania, as it has been described under its  several symptoms.         [Footnote 70: The recent _Variorum_ editions of Shakspeare,       of which some yet prefer that of Steevens, 1793, 15 vols.       8vo.--Mr. Todd's editions of Milton and Spenser; Mr. G.       Chalmers' edition of Sir David Lyndsay's works; Mr.       Gifford's edition of Massinger; and Mr. Octavius       Gilchrist's, of Bishop Corbett's poems, exemplify the good       effects of this _third means of cure_.]    In the _fourth place_, the erecting of Public Institutions[71] is a  very powerful antidote against the prevalence of several symptoms of  this disease.         [Footnote 71: The Royal, London, Surrey, and Russel       Institutions have been the means of concentrating, in divers       parts of the metropolis, large libraries of _useful_ books;       which, it is to be hoped, will eventually suppress the       establishment of what are called _Circulating       Libraries_--vehicles, too often, of insufferable nonsense,       and irremediable mischief!]    In the _fifth place_, the encouragement of the study of  Bibliography,[72] in its legitimate sense, and towards its true  object, may be numbered among the most efficacious cures for this  destructive malady. To place competent Librarians over the several  departments of a large public Library, or to submit a library, on a  more confined scale, to one diligent, enthusiastic, well informed,  well bred, Bibliographer[73] or Librarian, [of which in this  metropolis we have so many examples] is doing a vast deal towards  directing the channels of literature to flow in their proper courses.         [Footnote 72: \"UNNE BONNE BIBLIOGRAPHIE,\" says Marchand,       \"soit generale soit particuliere, soit profane, soit       ecclesiastique, soit nationale, provinciale, ou locale, soit       simplement personnelle, en un mot de quelque autre genre que       ce puisse etre, n'est pas un ouvrage aussi facile que       beaucoup de gens se le pourroient imaginer; mais, elles ne       doivent neanmoins nulelment [Transcriber's Note: nullement]       prevenir contre celle-ci.
