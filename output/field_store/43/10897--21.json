(#17)"],[1," other necessary consequences of small size and mass will follow; the  feeble force of gravitation, the languid atmospheric circulation, the  extreme range of temperatures, the low temperature at which water will  boil.    But the heat to which Mercury is exposed far transcends our terrestrial  experience. In the mean it receives nearly seven times as much heat from  the Sun as the Earth does, but this supply is not maintained uniformly,  for Mercury moves round the Sun in a very eccentric orbit, so that when in  aphelion it receives, surface for surface, only about four times as much  heat as the Earth, but some six weeks later when in perihelion it receives  more than eleven times. The great range of temperature due to the thinness  of the atmosphere must therefore be further increased by the varying  distance of the planet from the Sun.    A reference to Prof. Poynting's figures shows that the mean temperature of  Mercury must approximate to 194 deg. C., while water will boil at 40 deg. C. or  even lower. Here, then, is a condition the exact reverse of Mars. Water as  a liquid will be rare on Mercury, not because it is congealed, but because  it is evaporated; on the dark side of the planet it may, indeed, pass into  ice, but on the side exposed to the Sun it must exist normally as a  constituent of the atmosphere. Water in a liquid state, water that flows,  must be almost unknown.    But we have good reason to believe that that which is the dark side of  Mercury at one time is always dark; that which is exposed to the Sun is  always exposed to it.    Since Mercury wears no concealing veil of atmosphere, and displays  markings that can be identified and followed, a surprising circumstance  has come to light. In 1889, Schiaparelli discovered that Mercury, instead  of rotating on its axis in about 24 hours like the Earth and Mars, rotates  in 88 days; that is to say, it always turns the same face towards the Sun,  just as the Moon turns the same face towards the Earth. This fact,  confirmed theoretically by Prof. G. H. Darwin in his development of the  theory of tidal friction, puts the condition of Mercury in quite a new  light. No alternation of day or night refreshes and restores the little  world; one hemisphere is for ever exposed to the blasting heat of the Sun,  seven times hotter for it than for the Earth; the other hemisphere is for  ever exposed to the darkness and cold of outer space, a range from  something like 390 deg. C. above freezing-point, to 270 deg. C. below. It is true  that between the two hemispheres there is a \"debatable land,\" for, owing  to the ellipticity of the orbit, the face turned to the Sun is not exactly  the same at all times, and a region about 47 deg. in width on each side of the  planet, that is to say, rather more than a quarter of its entire surface,  has one day and one night in each period of 88 days, but these more  favoured sections can scarcely be considered more habitable than the rest.    The conditions of Mercury are so unfavourable for life that, even if this  remarkable relation of rotation period to revolution did not hold good,  it would still be impossible to regard it as a world for habitation. But  its case shows that a further condition of habitability has to be  satisfied by a planet. Size and distance from the Sun afford the first two  conditions; a suitable rotation period is now seen to be a third.    And it is possible that in this very particular Venus fails to qualify.  Schiaparelli, the first observer of his time, assisted by the clear  Italian sky, believed that he had demonstrated that Venus, like Mercury,  rotates once in her year; her day being thus equal in length to 225 of  ours, and the face that she turns to the Sun being always the same.    And in her case this statement requires practically no qualification, for,  her orbit being nearly circular, there is hardly any libration; a place  that has the Sun in its zenith has it so for ever; one on the night side  of Venus can never have a sunrise, or gladden in the daylight. The side  exposed to the Sun will wither in a temperature of about 227 deg. C., in which  all moisture will be evaporated; the side remote from it will be bound in  eternal ice. In neither hemisphere will water exist in the liquid state;  in neither hemisphere will life be possible.    But as yet the evidence is not conclusive that Venus has this long  rotation period. Several observers of high rank believe that our neighbour  rotates in nearly the same time as the Earth, but its markings are so  faint and elusive that the problem is a difficult one. The spectroscopic  method of determining the speed of rotation has been equally indecisive.  Until, therefore, the rotation period has been decided, the habitability  of Venus must remain in question. If it always turns the same face to the  Sun, there can be no more life upon it than upon Mercury; if on the  contrary it rotates in much the same time as the Earth, then, so far as we  know, it may well be a habitable world. Whether it is actually inhabited  is a matter at present entirely beyond our knowledge.    A page or two back we touched lightly on the eccentricity of the orbit of  Mercury--lightly, because it was not the chief factor in disabling the  planet for habitation. But the condition introduced by this eccentricity  is one which of itself would be sufficient to put it out of court. In the  six weeks in which Mercury moves from aphelion to perihelion, it  approaches the Sun by fourteen millions of miles, and the heat received by  it is increased 2-1/2 times. Then, in the next six weeks, it recedes as  far, and there is a like diminution. In other words, six weeks makes a  greater proportional change in this one planet's condition than we should  experience if our Earth were transported from its own orbit to that of  Mars.    But there are other members of the solar system whose orbits are so  elongated that that of Mercury seems in comparison almost circular. These  are the comets, some of which all but graze the surface of the Sun at  perihelion, and then recede from him for periods that it takes even  thousands of years to complete. But without dwelling on such extreme  cases, two of the best known of the periodic comets may be taken as  examples of the rest. Encke's is the comet of shortest period, returning  in about 3.3 years. At perihelion it is 31 millions of miles from the Sun;  one-third the distance of the Earth. It receives, therefore, at this part  of its orbit, 9 times as much light and heat as the Earth. But at aphelion  it retreats deep into the region of the asteroids, and is much more than  four times the mean distance of the Earth. At this part of its orbit it  receives but 1/17th as much heat as the Earth. By far the most famous of  all the comets is that known by the name of Halley, and its mean period is  76 years. At perihelion it comes within the orbit of Venus; indeed, nearly  halfway between that and the orbit of Mercury. At aphelion it recedes to  thirty-five times the distance of the Earth, far beyond the orbit of  Neptune. The range in its light and heat from the Sun is from 3 times that  of the Earth to less than 1/1200th; or, in other words, the supply of heat  at one time is nearly 4000 times that at another, and of the 76 years of  its period, only 80 days are spent within the orbit of the Earth.    Comets cannot be homes of life; they are not sufficiently condensed;  indeed, they are probably but loose congeries of small stones. But even if  comets were of planetary size it is clear that life could not be supported  on them; water could not remain in the liquid state on a world that rushed  from one such extreme of temperature to another.    Between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter there are scattered an untold  number of little planets commonly known as asteroids or minor planets.  Minor planets indeed they are, for the one first discovered--Ceres--  probably outweighs all the rest, known and unknown, put together,  though something like 700 have already been detected, and the list  grows at the rate of about one a week.    As the Table shows, Ceres is so small that the Earth exceeds it in volume  5000 times; even the Moon is 90 times as large. The mass of Ceres is not  known; being so small, its density is probably less than that of the Moon,  so that the Earth may easily outweigh it 10,000 times. The unfavourable  conditions resulting from smallness of size that the Moon presents are  therefore exaggerated exceedingly in the case of Ceres; its atmosphere  must approach in tenuity what we should regard as a vacuum in a  terrestrial laboratory, and water as a liquid be entirely unknown. Its  distance from the Sun is another hostile factor; for in consequence it  receives per unit of surface only 13 per cent of the light and heat that  falls on the Earth; its maximum temperature under a zenith Sun will fall  far below freezing-point, the minimum on the dark side will approach the  absolute zero.    With Ceres the whole of the asteroidal family can be dismissed as possible  abodes of life. No astronomer can regard them as such. Yet they have their  lesson to teach. Life can exist on the Earth only on the upper face of its  crust, and in a very thin film of air and water; but the enormous solid  bulk within, inert though it be, that supports the stage on which the  great drama of life is played, is as really essential as air and water  themselves. If that bulk were much smaller and less massive life could  find no place upon its surface.          CHAPTER X    THE MAJOR PLANETS      It is a striking change to pass from Ceres, the giant of the minor  planets, to Jupiter, the giant of the major planets. Instead of a world  that the Earth exceeds in volume 5000 times, we are confronted by one that  exceeds the Earth 1400 times.

As for  her quality, it cannot be less than princess, seeing she is my lady  and my queen. Her beauty transcends all the united charms of her whole  sex; even those chimerical perfections, which the hyperbolical  imaginations of poets in love have assigned to their mistresses, cease  to be incredible descriptions when applied to her, in whom all those  miraculous endowments are most divinely centred. The curling locks of  her bright flowing hair are purest gold; her smooth forehead the  Elysian plain; her brows are two celestial bows; her eyes two glorious  suns; her cheeks two beds of roses; her lips are coral; her teeth are  pearl; her neck is alabaster; her breasts marble; her hands ivory; and  snow would lose its whiteness near her bosom.\"    As they went on in this and like discourse, they saw, upon the hollow  road between the neighbouring mountains, about twenty shepherds more,  all accoutred in black skins, with garlands on their heads, which, as  they afterwards perceived, were all of yew or cyprus; six of them  carried a bier covered with several sorts of boughs and flowers: which  one of the goatherds espying, \"Those are they,\" cried he, \"that are  carrying poor Chrysostome to his grave; and it was in yonder hollow  that he gave charge they should bury his corpse.\" This made them all  double their pace, that they might get thither in time; and so they  arrived just as the bearers had set down the bier upon the ground, and  four of them had begun to open the ground with their spades at the  foot of a rock. They all saluted each other courteously, and condoled  their mutual loss; and then Don Quixote, with those who came with him,  went to view the bier; where they saw the dead body of a young man in  shepherd's weeds all strewed over with flowers. The deceased seemed to  be about thirty years old; and, dead as he was, it was easily  perceived that both his face and shape were extraordinarily handsome.  This doleful object so strangely filled all the company with sadness,  that not only the beholders, but also the grave-makers and the  mourning shepherds, remained a long time silent; till at last one of  the bearers, addressing himself to one of the rest, \"Look, Ambrose,\"  cried he, \"whether this be the place which Chrysostome meant, since  you must needs have his will so punctually performed?\" \"This is the  very place,\" answered the other; \"there it was that my unhappy friend  many times told me the sad story of his cruel fortune; and there it  was that he first saw that mortal enemy of mankind; there it was that  he made the first discovery of his passion, no less innocent than  violent; there it was that the relentless Marcella last denied,  shunned him, and drove him to that extremity of sorrow and despair  that hastened the sad catastrophe of his miserable life; and there it  was that, in token of so many misfortunes, he desired to be committed  to the bosom of the earth.\"    Then addressing himself to Don Quixote and the rest of the travellers,  \"This body, gentlemen,\" said he, \"which here you now behold, was once  enlivened by a soul which heaven had enriched with the greatest part  of its most valuable graces. This is the body of that Chrysostome who  was unrivalled in wit, matchless in courteousness, incomparable in  gracefulness, a phoenix in friendship, generous and magnificent  without ostentation, prudent and grave without pride, modest without  affectation, pleasant and complaisant without meanness; in a word, the  first in every thing good, though second to none in misfortune: he  loved well, and was hated; he adored, and was disdained; he begged  pity of cruelty itself; he strove to move obdurate marble; pursued the  wind; made his moans to solitary deserts; was constant to ingratitude;  and, for the recompense of his fidelity, became a prey to death in the  flower of his age, through the barbarity of a shepherdess, whom he  strove to immortalise by his verse; as these papers which are here  deposited might testify, had he not commanded me to sacrifice them to  the flames, at the same time that his body was committed to the  earth.\"    \"Should you do so,\" cried Vivaldo, \"you would appear more cruel to  them than their unhappy author. Consider, sir, 'tis not consistent  with discretion, nor even with justice, so nicely to perform the  request of the dead, when it is repugnant to reason. Augustus Caesar  himself would have forfeited his title to wisdom, had he permitted  that to have been effected which the divine Virgil had ordered by his  will. Therefore, sir, now that you resign your friend's body to the  grave, do not hurry thus the noble and only remains of that dear  unhappy man to a worse fate, the death of oblivion. What though he has  doomed them to perish in the height of his resentment, you ought not  indiscreetly to be their executioner; but rather reprieve and redeem  them from eternal silence, that they may live, and, flying through the  world, transmit to all ages the dismal story of your friend's virtue  and Marcella's ingratitude, as a warning to others, that they may  avoid such tempting snares and enchanting destructions; for not only  to me, but to all here present, is well known the history of your  enamoured and desperate friend: we are no strangers to the friendship  that was between you, as also to Marcella's cruelty which occasioned  his death. Last night being informed that he was to be buried here  to-day, moved not so much by curiosity as pity, we are come to behold  with our eyes that which gave us so much trouble to hear. Therefore,  in the name of all the company,--deeply affected like me, with a sense  of Chrysostome's extraordinary merit, and his unhappy fate, and  desirous to prevent such deplorable disasters for the future,--I beg  that you will permit me to save some of these papers, whatever you  resolve to do with the rest.\" And so, without waiting for an answer,  he stretched out his arm, and took out those papers which lay next to  his hand. \"Well, sir,\" said Ambrose, \"you have found a way to make me  submit, and you may keep those papers; but for the rest, nothing shall  make me alter my resolution of burning them.\" Vivaldo said no more;  but being impatient to see what those papers were which he had rescued  from the flames, he opened one of them immediately, and read the title  of it, which was, 'The despairing Lover.' \"That,\" said Ambrose, \"was  the last piece my dear friend ever wrote; and therefore, that you may  all hear to what a sad condition his unhappy passion had reduced him,  read it aloud, I beseech you, sir, while the grave is making.\" \"With  all my heart,\" replied Vivaldo; and so the company, having the same  desire, presently gathered round about him while he read the lines.    The verses were well approved by all the company; and Vivaldo was  about to read another paper, when they were unexpectedly prevented by  a kind of apparition that offered itself to their view. It was  Marcella herself, who appeared at the top of the rock, at the foot of  which they were digging the grave; but so beautiful, that fame seemed  rather to have lessened than to have magnified her charms: those who  had never seen her before gazed on her with silent wonder and delight;  nay, those who used to see her every day seemed no less lost in  admiration than the rest. But scarce had Ambrose spied her, when, with  anger and indignation in his heart, he cried out, \"What dost thou  there, thou cruel basilisk of these mountains? comest thou to see  whether the wounds of thy unhappy victim will bleed afresh at thy  presence? or comest thou to glory in the fatal effects of thy  inhumanity, like another Nero at the sight of flaming Rome?\" \"I come  not here to any of those ungrateful ends, Ambrose,\" replied Marcella;  \"but only to clear my innocence, and shew the injustice of all those  who lay their misfortunes and Chrysostome's death to my charge:  therefore, I entreat you all who are here at this time to hear me a  little, for I shall not need to use many words to convince people of  sense of an evident truth. Heaven, you are pleased to say, has made me  beautiful, and that to such a degree that you are forced, nay, as it  were, compelled to love me, in spite of your endeavours to the  contrary; and for the sake of that love, you say I ought to love you  again. Now, though I am sensible that whatever is beautiful is lovely,  I cannot conceive that what is loved for being handsome should be  bound to love that by which it is loved merely because it is loved. He  that loves a beautiful object may happen to be ugly; and as what is  ugly deserves not to be loved, it would be ridiculous to say, I love  you because you are handsome, and therefore you must love me again  though I am ugly. But suppose two persons of different sexes are  equally handsome, it does not follow that their desires should be  alike and reciprocal; for all beauties do not kindle love; some only  recreate the sight, and never reach nor captivate the heart. Alas,  should whatever is beautiful produce love, and enslave the mind,  mankind's desires would ever run confused and wandering, without being  able to fix their determinate choice; for as there is an infinite  number of beautiful objects, the desires would consequently be also  infinite; whereas, on the contrary, I have heard that true love is  still confined to one, and is voluntary and unforced. This being  granted, why would you have me force my inclinations for no other  reason but that you say you love me? Tell me, I beseech you, had  Heaven formed me as ugly as it has made me beautiful, could I justly  complain of you for not loving me? Pray consider also, that I do not  possess those charms by choice; such as they are, they were freely  bestowed on me by Heaven: and as the viper is not to be blamed for the  poison with which she kills, seeing it was assigned her by nature, so  I ought not to be censured for"]]]
