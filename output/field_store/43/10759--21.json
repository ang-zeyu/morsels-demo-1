Madame, yes.\"    \"Efface them from your heart as I drive them from mine. Whether La  Valliere does or does not love the king, and whether the king does  or does not love La Valliere--from this moment you and I will draw a  distinction in the two characters I have to perform. You open your eyes  so wide that I am sure you hardly understand me.\"    \"You are so impetuous, Madame, that I always tremble at the fear of  displeasing you.\"    \"And see how he trembles now, poor fellow,\" she said, with the most  charming playfulness of manner. \"Yes, monsieur, I have two characters  to perform. I am the sister of the king, the sister-in-law of the  king's wife. In this character ought I not to take an interest in these  domestic intrigues? Come, tell me what you think?\"    \"As little as possible, Madame.\"    \"Agreed, monsieur; but it is a question of dignity; and then, you  know, I am the wife of the king's brother.\" De Guiche sighed. \"A  circumstance,\" she added, with an expression of great tenderness, \"which  will remind you that I am always to be treated with the profoundest  respect.\" De Guiche fell at her feet, which he kissed, with the  religious fervor of a worshipper. \"And I begin to think that, really and  truly, I have another character to perform. I was almost forgetting it.\"    \"Name it, oh! name it,\" said De Guiche.    \"I am a woman,\" she said, in a voice lower than ever, \"and I love.\"  He rose, she opened her arms, and their lips met. A footstep was heard  behind the tapestry, and Mademoiselle de Montalais appeared.    \"What do you want?\" said Madame.    \"M. de Guiche is wanted,\" replied Montalais, who was just in time to see  the agitation of the actors of these four characters; for De Guiche had  consistently carried out his part with heroism.        Chapter XI. Montalais and Malicorne.    Montalais was right. M. de Guiche, thus summoned in every direction, was  very much exposed, from such a multiplication of business, to the  risk of not attending to any. It so happened that, considering the  awkwardness of the interruption, Madame, notwithstanding her wounded  pride, and secret anger, could not, for the moment at least, reproach  Montalais for having violated, in so bold a manner, the semi-royal order  with which she had been dismissed on De Guiche's entrance. De Guiche,  also, lost his presence of mind, or, it would be more correct to say,  had already lost it, before Montalais's arrival, for, scarcely had he  heard the young girl's voice, than, without taking leave of Madame, as  the most ordinary politeness required, even between persons equal in  rank and station, he fled from her presence, his heart tumultuously  throbbing, and his brain on fire, leaving the princess with one hand  raised, as though to bid him adieu. Montalais was at no loss, therefore,  to perceive the agitation of the two lovers--the one who fled was  agitated, and the one who remained was equally so.    \"Well,\" murmured the young girl, as she glanced inquisitively round her,  \"this time, at least, I think I know as much as the most curious  woman could possibly wish to know.\" Madame felt so embarrassed by this  inquisitorial look, that, as if she heard Montalais's muttered side  remark, she did not speak a word to her maid of honor, but, casting down  her eyes, retired at once to her bedroom. Montalais, observing this,  stood listening for a moment, and then heard Madame lock and bolt her  door. By this she knew that the rest of the evening was at her own  disposal; and making, behind the door which had just been closed, a  gesture which indicated but little real respect for the princess, she  went down the staircase in search of Malicorne, who was very busily  engaged at that moment in watching a courier, who, covered with dust,  had just left the Comte de Guiche's apartments. Montalais knew that  Malicorne was engaged in a matter of some importance; she therefore  allowed him to look and stretch out his neck as much as he pleased; and  it was only when Malicorne had resumed his natural position, that she  touched him on the shoulder. \"Well,\" said Montalais, \"what is the latest  intelligence you have?\"    \"M. de Guiche is in love with Madame.\"    \"Fine news, truly! I know something more recent than that.\"    \"Well, what do you know?\"    \"That Madame is in love with M. de Guiche.\"    \"The one is the consequence of the other.\"    \"Not always, my good monsieur.\"    \"Is that remark intended for me?\"    \"Present company always excepted.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Malicorne. \"Well, and in the other direction, what is  stirring?\"    \"The king wished, this evening, after the lottery, to see Mademoiselle  de la Valliere.\"    \"Well, and he has seen her?\"    \"No, indeed!\"    \"What do you mean by that?\"    \"The door was shut and locked.\"    \"So that--\"    \"So that the king was obliged to go back again, looking very sheepish,  like a thief who has forgotten his crowbar.\"    \"Good.\"    \"And in the third place?\" inquired Montalais.    \"The courier who has just arrived for De Guiche came from M. de  Bragelonne.\"    \"Excellent,\" said Montalais, clapping her hands together.    \"Why so?\"    \"Because we have work to do. If we get weary now, something unlucky will  be sure to happen.\"    \"We must divide the work, then,\" said Malicorne, \"in order to avoid  confusion.\"    \"Nothing easier,\" replied Montalais. \"Three intrigues, carefully nursed,  and carefully encouraged, will produce, one with another, and taking a  low average, three love letters a day.\"    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Malicorne, shrugging his shoulders, \"you cannot mean  what you say, darling; three letters a day, that may do for sentimental  common people. A musketeer on duty, a young girl in a convent, may  exchange letters with their lovers once a day, perhaps, from the top  of a ladder, or through a hole in the wall. A letter contains all the  poetry their poor little hearts have to boast of. But the cases we have  in hand require to be dealt with very differently.\"    \"Well, finish,\" said Montalais, out of patience with him. \"Some one may  come.\"    \"Finish! Why, I am only at the beginning. I have still three points as  yet untouched.\"    \"Upon my word, he will be the death of me, with his Flemish  indifference,\" exclaimed Montalais.    \"And you will drive me mad with your Italian vivacity. I was going to  say that our lovers here will be writing volumes to each other. But what  are you driving at?\"    \"At this. Not one of our lady correspondents will be able to keep the  letters they may receive.\"    \"Very likely.\"    \"M. de Guiche will not be able to keep his either.\"    \"That is probable.\"    \"Very well, then; I will take care of all that.\"    \"That is the very thing that is impossible,\" said Malicorne.    \"Why so?\"    \"Because you are not your own mistress; your room is as much La  Valliere's as yours; and there are certain persons who will think  nothing of visiting and searching a maid of honor's room; so that I am  terribly afraid of the queen, who is as jealous as a Spaniard; of the  queen-mother, who is as jealous as a couple of Spaniards; and, last of  all, of Madame herself, who has jealousy enough for ten Spaniards.\"    \"You forgot some one else.\"    \"Who?\"    \"Monsieur.\"    \"I was only speaking of the women. Let us add them up, then: we will  call Monsieur, No. 1.\"    \"De Guiche?\"    \"No. 2.\"    \"The Vicomte de Bragelonne?\"    \"No. 3.\"    \"And the king, the king?\"    \"No. 4. Of course the king, who not only will be more jealous, but more  powerful than all the rest put together. Ah, my dear!\"    \"Well?\"    \"Into what a wasp's nest you have thrust yourself!\"    \"And as yet not quite far enough, if you will follow me into it.\"    \"Most certainly I will follow you where you like. Yet--\"    \"Well, yet--\"    \"While we have time, I think it will be prudent to turn back.\"    \"But I, on the contrary, think the wisest course to take is to put  ourselves at once at the head of all these intrigues.\"    \"You will never be able to do it.\"    \"With you, I could superintend ten of them. I am in my element, you must  know. I was born to live at the court, as the salamander is made to live  in the fire.\"    \"Your comparison does not reassure me in the slightest degree in the  world, my dear Montalais. I have heard it said, and by learned men too,  that, in the first place, there are no salamanders at all, and that, if  there had been any, they would have been infallibly baked or roasted on  leaving the fire.\"    \"Your learned men may be very wise as far as salamanders are concerned,  but they would never tell you what I can tell you; namely, that Aure  de Montalais is destined, before a month is over, to become the first  diplomatist in the court of France.\"    \"Be it so, but on condition that I shall be the second.\"    \"Agreed; an offensive and defensive alliance, of course.\"    \"Only be very careful of any letters.\"    \"I will hand them to you as I receive them.\"    \"What shall we tell the king about Madame?\"    \"That Madame is still in love with his majesty.\"    \"What shall we tell Madame about the king?\"    \"That she would be exceedingly wrong not to humor him.\"    \"What shall we tell La Valliere about Madame?\"    \"Whatever we choose, for La Valliere is in our power.\"    \"How so?\"    \"Every way.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"In the first place, through the Vicomte de Bragelonne.\"    \"Explain yourself.\"    \"You do not forget, I hope, that Monsieur de Bragelonne has written many  letters to Mademoiselle de la Valliere.\"    \"I forget nothing.\"    \"Well, then, it was I who received, and I who intercepted those  letters.\"    \"And, consequently, it is you who have them still?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Where,--here?\"    \"Oh, no; I have them safe at Blois, in the little room you know well  enough.\"    \"That dear little room,--that darling little room, the ante-chamber of  the palace I intend you to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27250"],[0,"What I Saw in America (#17)"],[1,"  and bring with them a blast of death and a reek of rotting things. It is  that influence that alone prevents the Middle West from progressing  towards the Middle Ages.    For, after all, linked up in a hundred legends of the Middle Ages, may  be found a symbolic pattern of hammers and nails and saws; and there is  no reason why they should not have also sanctified screw-drivers. There  is no reason why the screw-driver that seemed such a trifle to the  author should not have been borne in triumph down Main Street like a  sword of state, in some pageant of the Guild of St. Joseph of the  Carpenters or St. Dunstan of the Smiths. It was the Catholic poetry and  piety that filled common life with something that is lacking in the  worthy and virile democracy of the West. Nor are Americans of  intelligence so ignorant of this as some may suppose. There is an  admirable society called the Mediaevalists in Chicago; whose name and  address will strike many as suggesting a certain struggle of the soul  against the environment. With the national heartiness they blazon their  note-paper with heraldry and the hues of Gothic windows; with the  national high spirits they assume the fancy dress of friars; but any one  who should essay to laugh at them instead of with them would find out  his mistake. For many of them do really know a great deal about  mediaevalism; much more than I do, or most other men brought up on an  island that is crowded with its cathedrals. Something of the same spirit  may be seen in the beautiful new plans and buildings of Yale,  deliberately modelled not on classical harmony but on Gothic  irregularity and surprise. The grace and energy of the mediaeval  architecture resurrected by a man like Mr. R. A. Cram of Boston has  behind it not merely artistic but historical and ethical enthusiasm; an  enthusiasm for the Catholic creed which made mediaeval civilisation.  Even on the huge Puritan plains of the Middle West the influence strays  in the strangest fashion. And it is notable that among the pessimistic  epitaphs of the Spoon River Anthology, in that churchyard compared with  which most churchyards are cheery, among the suicides and secret  drinkers and monomaniacs and hideous hypocrites of that happy village,  almost the only record of respect and a recognition of wider hopes is  dedicated to the Catholic priest.    But Main Street is Main Street in the main. Main Street is Modern Street  in its multiplicity of mildly half-educated people; and all these  historic things are a thousand miles from them. They have not heard the  ancient noise either of arts or arms; the building of the cathedral or  the marching of the crusade. But at least they have not deliberately  slandered the crusade and defaced the cathedral. And if they have not  produced the peasant arts, they can still produce the peasant crafts.  They can sow and plough and reap and live by these everlasting things;  nor shall the foundations of their state be moved. And the memory of  those colossal fields, of those fruitful deserts, came back the more  readily into my mind because I finished these reflections in the very  heart of a modern industrial city, if it can be said to have a heart. It  was in fact an English industrial city, but it struck me that it might  very well be an American one. And it also struck me that we yield rather  too easily to America the dusty palm of industrial enterprise, and feel  far too little apprehension about greener and fresher vegetables. There  is a story of an American who carefully studied all the sights of London  or Rome or Paris, and came to the conclusion that 'it had nothing on  Minneapolis.' It seems to me that Minneapolis has nothing on Manchester.  There were the same grey vistas of shops full of rubber tyres and  metallic appliances; a man felt that he might walk a day without seeing  a blade of grass; the whole horizon was so infinite with efficiency. The  factory chimneys might have been Pittsburg; the sky-signs might have  been New York. One looked up in a sort of despair at the sky, not for a  sky-sign but in a sense for a sign, for some sentence of significance  and judgment; by the instinct that makes any man in such a scene seek  for the only thing that has not been made by men. But even that was  illogical, for it was night, and I could only expect to see the stars,  which might have reminded me of Old Glory; but that was not the sign  that oppressed me. All the ground was a wilderness of stone and all the  buildings a forest of brick; I was far in the interior of a labyrinth of  lifeless things. Only, looking up, between two black chimneys and a  telegraph pole, I saw vast and far and faint, as the first men saw it,  the silver pattern of the Plough.          _The American Business Man_      It is a commonplace that men are all agreed in using symbols, and all  differ about the meaning of the symbols. It is obvious that a Russian  republican might come to identify the eagle as a bird of empire and  therefore a bird of prey. But when he ultimately escaped to the land of  the free, he might find the same bird on the American coinage figuring  as a bird of freedom. Doubtless, he might find many other things to  surprise him in the land of the free, and many calculated to make him  think that the bird, if not imperial, was at least rather imperious. But  I am not discussing those exceptional details here. It is equally  obvious that a Russian reactionary might cross the world with a vow of  vengeance against the red flag. But that authoritarian might have some  difficulties with the authorities, if he shot a man for using the red  flag on the railway between Willesden and Clapham Junction.    But, of course, the difficulty about symbols is generally much more  subtle than in these simple cases. I have remarked elsewhere that the  first thing which a traveller should write about is the thing which he  has not read about. It may be a small or secondary thing, but it is a  thing that he has seen and not merely expected to see.    I gave the example of the great multitude of wooden houses in America;  we might say of wooden towns and wooden cities. But after he has seen  such things, his next duty is to see the meaning of them; and here a  great deal of complication and controversy is possible. The thing  probably does not mean what he first supposes it to mean on the face of  it; but even on the face of it, it might mean many different and even  opposite things.    For instance, a wooden house might suggest an almost savage solitude; a  rude shanty put together by a pioneer in a forest; or it might mean a  very recent and rapid solution of the housing problem, conducted cheaply  and therefore on a very large scale. A wooden house might suggest the  very newest thing in America or one of the very oldest things in  England. It might mean a grey ruin at Stratford or a white exhibition at  Earl's Court.    It is when we come to this interpretation of international symbols that  we make most of the international mistakes. Without the smallest error  of detail, I will promise to prove that Oriental women are independent  because they wear trousers, or Oriental men subject because they wear  skirts. Merely to apply it to this case, I will take the example of two  very commonplace and trivial objects of modern life--a walking stick and  a fur coat.    As it happened, I travelled about America with two sticks, like a  Japanese nobleman with his two swords. I fear the simile is too stately.  I bore more resemblance to a cripple with two crutches or a highly  ineffectual version of the devil on two sticks. I carried them both  because I valued them both, and did not wish to risk losing either of  them in my erratic travels. One is a very plain grey stick from the  woods of Buckinghamshire, but as I took it with me to Palestine it  partakes of the character of a pilgrim's staff. When I can say that I  have taken the same stick to Jerusalem and to Chicago, I think the stick  and I may both have a rest. The other, which I value even more, was  given me by the Knights of Columbus at Yale, and I wish I could think  that their chivalric title allowed me to regard it as a sword.    Now, I do not know whether the Americans I met, struck by the fastidious  foppery of my dress and appearance, concluded that it is the custom of  elegant English dandies to carry two walking sticks. But I do know that  it is much less common among Americans than among Englishmen to carry  even one. The point, however, is not merely that more sticks are carried  by Englishmen than by Americans; it is that the sticks which are carried  by Americans stand for something entirely different.    In America a stick is commonly called a cane, and it has about it  something of the atmosphere which the poet described as the nice conduct  of the clouded cane. It would be an exaggeration to say that when the  citizens of the United States see a man carrying a light stick, they  deduce that if he does that he does nothing else. But there is about it  a faint flavour of luxury and lounging, and most of the energetic  citizens of this energetic society avoid it by instinct.    Now, in an Englishman like myself, carrying a stick may imply lounging,  but it does not imply luxury, and I can say with some firmness that it  does not imply dandyism. In a great many Englishmen it means the very  opposite even of lounging. By one of those fantastic paradoxes which  are the mystery of nationality, a walking stick often actually means  walking. It frequently suggests the very reverse of the beau with his  clouded cane; it does not suggest a town type, but rather specially a  country type. It rather implies the kind of Englishman who tramps about  in lanes and meadows and knocks the tops off thistles. It suggests the  sort of man who has carried the stick through his native woods, and  perhaps even cut it in his native woods.    There are plenty of"]]]
