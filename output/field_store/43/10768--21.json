Despite its abundant  natural resources, output per capita is among the world's lowest.  Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the  population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital  to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports.  Violence continues, millions of land mines remain, and many farmers  are reluctant to return to their fields. As a result, much of the  country's food must still be imported. To fully take advantage of  its rich resources - gold, diamonds, extensive forests, Atlantic  fisheries, and large oil deposits - Angola will need to end its  conflict and continue reforming government policies. Despite the  increase in the pace of civil warfare in late 1998, the economy grew  by an estimated 5% in 2000. The government introduced new currency  denominations in 1999, including 1 and 5 kwanza notes. Internal  strife discourages investment outside of the petroleum sector, which  is producing roughly 800,000 barrels of oil per day. Angola has  entered into a Staff Monitored Program (SMP) with the IMF. Continued  growth depends on sharp cuts in inflation, further economic reform,  and a lessening of fighting.

Austria's    economy is closely integrated with Germany and other EU members -    Austria joined the EU on 1 January 1995. Since the early 1980s, the    Austrian economy has experienced stable growth. Following a mild    recession in 1993, Austria's economy - driven by strong exports,    investment, and private consumption - expanded 2.7% in 1994 and    about 2.4% in 1995. The slowdown in 1995 was largely due to an    appreciation of the Austrian schilling and its negative effect on    exports and tourism. EU membership has had a positive impact on    foreign investment and has helped to lower inflation. Despite    Austria's generally favorable economic prospects, the government    faces a number of economic challenges, especially budget    consolidation. Smaller than expected revenues and rising welfare    payments caused the budget deficit to climb to 7.1% of GDP in 1995.    Austria also faces a growing unemployment problem. Although low by    European standards, Austria's unemployment rate has risen gradually    during the 1990s as companies restructured to meet competition from    the EU single market and Eastern Europe.    GDP: purchasing power parity - $152 billion (1995 est.)    GDP real growth rate: 2.4% (1995 est.)    GDP per capita: $19,000 (1995 est.)
