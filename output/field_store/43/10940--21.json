A. We think so.    (2) J. C. R asks: Which was the first railroad built in the United  States? That is, a regular, incorporated road, connecting two points,  and conveying passengers, freight, etc. A. We believe that the road  now known as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was the first in the  United States chartered for carrying on a general transportation  business.    (3) J. R. E. asks how to make an ordinary sunshade for a telescope  when placed, and what kind of glass it is composed of. A. Any very  dark glass will answer, providing it is perfectly plane. It should be  placed between the eye and eyepiece.    (4) W. H. G. S. writes: I wish to give a blue color to screw heads,  wire and steel. What shall I use? A. Heat them in a sand bath, or  apply shellac or copal varnish, to which a little Prussian blue has  been added.    (5) T. McW. asks (1) for a good recipe for making Babbitt metal. A.  By weight, 4 parts copper, 8 parts antimony, 96 parts tin. 2. What is  meant by heating surface in boilers, and how is it computed? A. The  term heating surface, as ordinarily used, refers to the surface which  has water on one side, and flame or the products of combustion on the  other. 3. I have a peculiar kind of steel which I cannot harden by  fire and water, neither will it caseharden by prussiate of potash.  What can I do with it to harden it? A. Assuming your account to be  correct, we judge that you cannot harden it.    (6) A. Van B. writes: A correspondent in your last issue asks how  to keep rubber belts from slipping. Mine slipped considerably, but I  checked it by throwing powdered rosin in between the belt and pulley  while running. The pulley soon becomes covered with a tough black  coating, very much like leather, and there is no more slip. [This  expedient can be used to advantage in certain cases, but it is  better to have a belt large enough to drive without using any  preparation.--ED.]    (7) E. B. C. asks: 1. Does a more powerful battery produce better  results in telephone or microphone? A. A powerful battery is not  required for either. 2.
