It is said that  if one picks the flowers while they are in bloom they will remain  perfect for a long time, but if they are not picked they soon disappear  and are replaced by other flowers.  That, in my opinion, make the Magic  Plant the most wonderful in existence.\"    \"But these are only stories,\" said the girl.  \"Has any of your friends  ever picked a flower from the wonderful plant?\"    \"No,\" admitted the Cowardly Lion, \"for if any living thing ventures  upon the Magic Isle, where the golden flower-pot stands, that man or  beast takes root in the soil and cannot get away again.\"    \"What happens to them, then?\" asked Dorothy.    \"They grow smaller, hour by hour and day by day, and finally disappear  entirely.\"    \"Then,\" said the girl anxiously, \"we must hurry up, or Cap'n Bill an'  Trot will get too small to be comf'table.\"    They were proceeding at a rapid pace during this conversation, for the  Hungry Tiger and the Cowardly Lion were obliged to move swiftly in  order to keep pace with the Glass Cat.  After leaving the Forest of  Gugu they crossed a mountain range, and then a broad plain, after which  they reached another forest, much smaller than that where Gugu ruled.    \"The Magic Isle is in this forest,\" said the Glass Cat, \"but the river  is at the other side of the forest.  There is no path through the  trees, but if we keep going east, we will find the river, and then it  will be easy to find the Magic Isle.\"    \"Have you ever traveled this way before?\" inquired the Wizard.    \"Not exactly,\" admitted the Cat, \"but I know we shall reach the river  if we go east through the forest.\"    \"Lead on, then,\" said the Wizard.    The Glass Cat started away, and at first it was easy to pass between  the trees; but before long the underbrush and vines became thick and  tangled, and after pushing their way through these obstacles for a  time, our travelers came to a place where even the Glass Cat could not  push through.    \"We'd better go back and find a path,\" suggested the Hungry Tiger.    \"I'm s'prised at you,\" said Dorothy, eyeing the Glass Cat severely.    \"I'm surprised, myself,\" replied the Cat.  \"But it's a long way around  the forest to where the river enters it, and I thought we could save  time by going straight through.\"    \"No one can blame you,\" said the Wizard, \"and I think, instead of  turning back, I can make a path that will allow us to proceed.\"    He opened his black bag and after searching among his magic tools drew  out a small axe, made of some metal so highly polished that it  glittered brightly even in the dark forest.  The Wizard laid the little  axe on the ground and said in a commanding voice:      \"Chop, Little Axe, chop clean and true;    A path for our feet you must quickly hew.    Chop till this tangle of jungle is passed;    Chop to the east, Little Axe--chop fast!\"      Then the little axe began to move and flashed its bright blade right  and left, clearing a way through vine and brush and scattering the  tangled barrier so quickly that the Lion and the Tiger, carrying  Dorothy and the Wizard and the cage of monkeys on their backs, were  able to stride through the forest at a fast walk.  The brush seemed to  melt away before them and the little axe chopped so fast that their  eyes only saw a twinkling of the blade.  Then, suddenly, the forest was  open again, and the little axe, having obeyed its orders, lay still  upon the ground.    The Wizard picked up the magic axe and after carefully wiping it with  his silk handkerchief put it away in his black bag.  Then they went on  and in a short time reached the river.    \"Let me see,\" said the Glass Cat, looking up and down the stream, \"I  think we are below the Magic Isle; so we must go up the stream until we  come to it.\"    So up the stream they traveled, walking comfortably on the river bank,  and after a while the water broadened and a sharp bend appeared in the  river, hiding all below from their view.  They walked briskly along,  however, and had nearly reached the bend when a voice cried warningly:  \"Look out!\"    The travelers halted abruptly and the Wizard said: \"Look out for what?\"    \"You almost stepped on my Diamond Palace,\" replied the voice, and a  duck with gorgeously colored feathers appeared before them.  \"Beasts  and men are terribly clumsy,\" continued the Duck in an irritated tone,  \"and you've no business on this side of the River, anyway.  What are  you doing here?\"    \"We've come to rescue some friends of ours who are stuck fast on the  Magic Isle in this river,\" explained Dorothy.    \"I know 'em,\" said the Duck.  \"I've been to see 'em, and they're stuck  fast, all right.  You may as well go back home, for no power can save  them.\"    \"This is the Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\" said Dorothy, pointing to the  little man.    \"Well, I'm the Lonesome Duck,\" was the reply, as the fowl strutted up  and down to show its feathers to best advantage.  \"I'm the great Forest  Magician, as any beast can tell you, but even I have no power to  destroy the dreadful charm of the Magic Isle.\"    \"Are you lonesome because you're a magician?\" inquired Dorothy.    \"No; I'm lonesome because I have no family and no friends.  But I like  to be lonesome, so please don't offer to be friendly with me.  Go away,  and try not to step on my Diamond Palace.\"    \"Where is it?\" asked the girl.    \"Behind this bush.\"    Dorothy hopped off the lion's back and ran around the bush to see the  Diamond Palace of the Lonesome Duck, although the gaudy fowl protested  in a series of low quacks.  The girl found, indeed, a glistening dome  formed of clearest diamonds, neatly cemented together, with a doorway  at the side just big enough to admit the duck.    \"Where did you find so many diamonds?\" asked Dorothy, wonderingly.    \"I know a place in the mountains where they are thick as pebbles,\" said  the Lonesome Duck, \"and I brought them here in my bill, one by one and  put them in the river and let the water run over them until they were  brightly polished.  Then I built this palace, and I'm positive it's the  only Diamond Palace in all the world.\"    \"It's the only one I know of,\" said the little girl; \"but if you live  in it all alone, I don't see why it's any better than a wooden palace,  or one of bricks or cobble-stones.\"    \"You're not supposed to understand that,\" retorted the Lonesome Duck.  \"But I might tell you, as a matter of education, that a home of any  sort should be beautiful to those who live in it, and should not be  intended to please strangers.  The Diamond Palace is my home, and I  like it.  So I don't care a quack whether YOU like it or not.\"    \"Oh, but I do!\" exclaimed Dorothy.  \"It's lovely on the outside, but--\"  Then she stopped speaking, for the Lonesome Duck had entered his palace  through the little door without even saying good-bye.  So Dorothy  returned to her friends and they resumed their journey.    \"Do you think, Wizard, the Duck was right in saying no magic can rescue  Trot and Cap'n Bill?\" asked the girl in a worried tone of voice.    \"No, I don't think the Lonesome Duck was right in saying that,\"  answered the Wizard, gravely, \"but it is possible that their  enchantment will be harder to overcome than I expected.  I'll do my  best, of course, and no one can do more than his best.\"    That didn't entirely relieve Dorothy's anxiety, but she said nothing  more, and soon, on turning the bend in the river, they came in sight of  the Magic Isle.    \"There they are!\" exclaimed Dorothy eagerly.    \"Yes, I see them,\" replied the Wizard, nodding.  \"They are sitting on  two big toadstools.\"    \"That's queer,\" remarked the Glass Cat.  \"There were no toadstools  there when I left them.\"    \"What a lovely flower!\" cried Dorothy in rapture, as her gaze fell on  the Magic Plant.    \"Never mind the Flower, just now,\" advised the Wizard.  \"The most  important thing is to rescue our friends.\"    By this time they had arrived at a place just opposite the Magic Isle,  and now both Trot and Cap'n Bill saw the arrival of their friends and  called to them for help.    \"How are you?\" shouted the Wizard, putting his hands to his mouth so  they could hear him better across the water.    \"We're in hard luck,\" shouted Cap'n Bill, in reply.  \"We're anchored  here and can't move till you find a way to cut the hawser.\"    \"What does he mean by that?\" asked Dorothy.    \"We can't move our feet a bit!\" called Trot, speaking as loud as she  could.    \"Why not?\" inquired Dorothy.    \"They've got roots on 'em,\" explained Trot.    It was hard to talk from so great a distance, so the Wizard said to the  Glass Cat:    \"Go to the island and tell our friends to be patient, for we have come  to save them.  It may take a little time to release them, for the Magic  of the Isle is new to me and I shall have to experiment.  But tell them  I'll hurry as fast as I can.\"    So the Glass Cat walked across the river under the water to tell Trot  and Cap'n Bill not to worry, and the Wizard at once opened his black  bag and began to make his preparations.          18.  The Magic of the Wizard      He first set up a small silver tripod and placed a gold basin at the  top of it.  Into this basin he put two powders--a pink one and a  sky-blue one--and poured over them a yellow liquid from a crystal vial.  Then he mumbled some magic words, and the powders began to sizzle and  burn and send out a cloud of violet smoke that floated across the river  and completely enveloped both Trot and Cap'n Bill, as well as the  toadstools on which they sat, and even the Magic Plant in the gold  flower-pot.  Then, after the smoke had disappeared into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41934"],[0,"Idling in Italy: Studies of literature and of life (#17)"],[1," its purpose is to show that all philosophy is vain and  should make way for action. Although it indicates wide and attentive  reading and a certain erudition, the only indication of constructive  thought that it reveals is a rudimentary attempt to adjust the  philosophic system of each man to the temperamental bias of the author.  Others, Santayana for instance, have done this so much better that there  is scarcely justification for his pride. He could have carried his point  quite as successfully by stating it as by laboring it through a whole  volume devoted largely to railing both at philosophers and at their  philosophy.    From the point of view of the philosopher this book is \"popular.\" From  the standpoint of the people it is \"philosophical.\" It is really a  testimonial to the author's breathless state of emotional unrest. He is  like a bird in a cage and he feels that he must beat down the barriers  in order to accomplish freedom, but when they are fractured and he is  apparently free there is no sense of liberation. He is in a far more  secure prison than he was before, and to make matters worse he cannot  now distinguish the barriers that obstacle his freedom. The wonder is  not that a man of the temperament and intellectual endowment of Signor  Papini has this feeling, but that he can convince himself that any one  else should be interested in his discovery.    He that hath knowledge spareth his words, and the mistake is to consider  words linked up as subject, predicate, and object, especially if the  substantives are qualified by lurid adjectives, the equivalent of  knowledge. He knows the \"ars scrivendi\" as Aspasia knew the \"ars  amandi\"; Papini knows the value of symbolic, eye-arresting, suggestive  titles. He realizes the importance of overstatement and of exaggerated  emphasis; he is cognizant of the insatiateness of the average human  being for gossip and particularly gossip about the great; he recognizes  that there is no more successful way of flattering the mediocre than by  pointing out to him the shortcomings of the gods, for thus does he  identify their possessions with his own and convince himself that he  also is a god. Papini's sensitive soul whispers to him that the majority  of people will think him brave, courageous, valorous, resolute,  virtuous, and firm if he will adopt a certain pose, a certain manner, a  certain swagger that will convey his grim determination to carry his  mission to the world though it takes his last breath, the last glow of  his mortal soul.    \"They wished me to be a poet; here, therefore, is a little poetry,\" is  the opening line of his book called \"Cento Pagine di Poesia,\" and this,  though not in verse, is characterized by such imaginative beauty, more  in language, however, than in thought, that it is worthy to be called a  poem. More than any other of his books it reveals the real Papini. Here  he is less truculent, less Nietzschian, less self-conscious of  understudying and attempting to act the parts of Jove. He is more like  the Papini that he is by nature, and therefore more human, more kind and  gentle--would I could add modest--more potent and convincing, than in  any of his other books. It is especially in the third part, under the  general title of \"Precipitations,\" that the author gives the freest rein  to his fantasy and is not always endeavoring to explain or tell the  reason why, but abandons himself to the production of words which will  present rhythmically the emotions that are springing up within him. It  is difficult to believe that the same hand penned these poems and the  open letter to Anatole France beginning: \"In these days Anatole France  is in Rome, and perhaps returning he will stop in Florence, but I beg  him fervently not to seek me out. I could not receive him.\" That quality  of delusion of grandeur I have seen heretofore only in victims of a  terrible disease.    Signor Papini is never so transparent as he is in his \"Stroncatura\" and  in his excursions into the realm of philosophy. His attack on Nietzsche  is most illuminating. In fact, Giovanni Papini is Frederick Nietzsche  viewed through an inverted telescope. \"Nietzsche's volubility  (indication of easy fatigue) makes him prefer the fragmentary and  aphoristic style of expression; his incapacity to select from all that  which he has thought and written leads him to publish a quantity of  useless and repeated thought; his reluctance to synthetize, to  construct, to organize, which gives to his books an air of oriental  stuff, a mixture of old rags and of precious drapery, jumbled up without  order, are the best arguments for imputing to him a deficiency of  imperial mentality, a reflex of the general weakness of philosophy. But  the most unexpected proof of this weakness consists in his incapacity to  be truly and authentically original. The highest and most difficult  forms of originality are certainly these two: to find new interpretation  and solution of old problems, to pose new problems and to open streets  absolutely unknown.\"    No one can examine closely the writings of Signor Papini without  recognizing that he has shown himself incapable of selecting from that  which he has written and thought and of setting it forth as a statement  of his philosophy or as an Apologia pro Sua Vita. Constant republication  of the same statements and the same ideas dressed up with different  synonyms is a charge that can be brought with justice. It can be  substantiated not only by his books but by _La Vraie Italie_, an organ  of intellectual liaison between Italy and other countries directed by  Signor Papini, which had a brief existence in 1919, a considerable  portion of which was taken up with republication of the old writings of  the director.    Even the most intemperate of his admirers would scarcely contend that he  merits being called original, judged by his own standards. At one time  in his life Nietzsche was undoubtedly his idol, and I can think of the  juvenile Papini No. 3 suggesting that he model himself after the  Teutonic descendant of Pasiphae and the bull of Poseidon. Thus did he  appease his morbid sensitiveness and soothe his pathological erethism by  enveloping himself in an armor made up of rude and uncouth words, of  sentiment and of disparagement; of raillery against piety, reverence,  and faith; of contempt for tradition. In fact, he seemed equipped with a  special apparatus for pulling roots founded in the tender emotions. He  would pretend that he is superior to the ordinary mortal to whom love in  its various display, sentiment in its manifold presentations, dependence  upon others in its countless aspects are as essential to happiness as  the breath of the nostrils is essential to life. In secret, however, he  is not only dependent upon it, he is beholden to it.    When he assumes his most callous and indifferent air, when he is least  cognizant of the sensitiveness of others, when in brief he is speaking  of his fellow countrymen, Signore D'Annunzio, Mazzoni, Bertacchi, Croce,  and up until recently when he speaks of God or religion, he reminds me  of that extraordinary and inexplicable type of individual whom we have  had \"in our midst\" since time immemorial, but who had greater vogue in  the time of Petronius than he has to-day.    Although the majority of these persons are _au fond_ proud of their  endowment, the world at large scoffs at them; and in primitive countries  such as our own it kicks at them; therefore they are quick to see the  advantage of assuming an air of crass indifference and, with the swagger  of the social corsair, to express a brutal insensitiveness to the  aesthetic and the hedonistic to which in reality they vibrate. They never  deceive themselves, and Signor Papini does not deceive himself. He knows  his limitations, and the greatest of them are that he is timid, lacking  in imagination, in sense of humor, and in originality. He is as  dependent upon love as a baby is upon its bottle.    When writing about himself he hopes the reader will identify him only  with the characters whose thoughts and actions are flattering, but the  real man is to be identified with some of the characters whom he desires  his public to think fictitious. In one of his short stories he narrates  a visit to a world-famed literary man. He describes his trip to the  remote city that he may lay the modest wreath plated from the pride of  his mind and his heart at the feet of his idol. He finds him a  commonplace, almost undifferentiated lump of clay with a more  commonplace, slatternly wife and even more hopelessly commonplace  children. His repute is dependent wholly upon the skill with which he  manipulates a card index and pigeon-holes. Papini fled to escape  contemplation of himself and the fragments of the sacred vessel.    Signor Papini has been an omnivorous reader along certain lines; he has  been a tireless writer, and he is notorious for his neologistic  logorrhea, but the possession which stands in closest relation to his  literary reputation is his indexed collection of words, phrases, and  sentences. This, plus knowing by heart the poetry of Carducci, and his  envy of Benedetto Croce for having obtained the repute of being one of  the most fertile philosophic minds of his age, and his advocacy of the  gospel of strenuousness, is the framework upon which he has ensheathed  his house of letters.    No study of the man or of his work can neglect one aspect of his  career--his constant change of position. He knocks with breathless  anxiety at the door of some new world, and no sooner does he secure  entrance and see the pleasant valley of Hinnom than he feels the lure of  black Gehenna and is seized with an uncontrollable desire to explore it.  When he returns he hastens to the public forum and announces his  discoveries, preferring to tell of the gewgaws which he discovered than  to expatiate on the few jewels which he gathered.    His "]]]
