Charity watched him striding away  across the field until he was out of sight. As she turned to her own  home she noticed his tracks and the dark blotches they made on the  pure, white surface of the snow before her door. Somehow they troubled  her, and, without thinking, she made a little futile brush at the  nearest footprint with the corner of her shawl, thus only enlarging  and making it more unsightly than before. Then, with a nervous laugh  at her own foolish fancies, she entered the house.      II    The next morning, long before the rest of the family were astir,  Charity was sitting at her window, hooded and wrapped for the long  ride. How she had looked forward to this day! With refreshing sleep  and the sweet hopefulness of morning, all her doubts of the preceding  night had flapped away like bats into the darkness where they  belonged; and she was as fair and rosy and bright-eyed as the dawn  itself when she appeared at the door a few minutes later, in answer to  a merry jingle of sleighbells. Tom's mood was as happy as her own, and  the sturdy little horse jogged along only too fast over the icy road  when they had turned his head toward the city.    There was much to talk about. Tom had not been idle these last few  days, and had a great deal to tell her about her room in the old  Ralston house, where he was to take her on New Year's day. She  listened shyly, glancing up at him now and then with a happy face and  starry eyes, as he described the improvements he hoped to make on the  farm, and the hay he should take from the new meadow he had just  bought, and the hammock he should put up for her under the elms for  the long, quiet summer days.    \"Only,\" she broke in eagerly, \"you know I must work, too, while you  are in the field\"--    Then she grew rosy again, and subsided into the great buffalo robes,  while Tom wandered inconsequently from the subject, and the horse  started ahead suddenly when he wasn't by any means expected to, and  the dark trees beside the road rustled as if they were singing softly,  and--oh, dear! it was a wonderful ride altogether.    \"See!\" whispered Tom, pointing to the horizon just before them.    A very grave and sweet look came into the girlish face, as she  followed his glance and saw the star in the east shining brightly  through the swaying pine boughs.    \"Christmas, Christmas,\" he whispered. \"Oh, my darling, what a gift He  is giving me on his birthday--how much more precious than the gold and  frankincense He received eighteen hundred years ago!\"    So they glide along as blessed as if the poor old sleigh, with its  odorous load of evergreen and holly, were a heavenly chariot bearing  them away from everything low and bad and wretched in the world,  until they draw near the city. The houses stand more and more closely  together. A milkman passes at full trot, and, seeing the country team  and its errand gives them the first jovial greeting of the day.  Shutters come down, blinds fly open, boys emerge from side streets,  blowing on their fingers and crying the morning papers.    \"Mister, gimme some green?\" one calls out now and then. And  good-natured Tom turns round in his seat, pulls out a bunch of his  merchandise and hands it to Charity, that she may have the pleasure of  giving it away. Now they are fairly within the long, brick-walled  streets, and the city is awake. Tom leaves Charity at the house of a  friend and makes an engagement to call for her as soon as his load is  sold (half of it has been ordered and engaged already), which will  probably be at about four. He will come at five, anyway; if he should  miss the hour--here he looks at her slyly and they both have a good  laugh at the absurdity of the idea--she can come to the market and  find him. Then they will have before them the beautiful Christmas-eve  ride home: \"When,\" says Tom solemnly, \"the little horse will probably  be so tired that we will have to let him walk most of the way!\"      III    Swiftly the hours of the happy day flew by. Charity completed her  humble purchases, which, after all, were hardly more than an excuse  for accompanying Tom to the city, and drank her fill of the joyous  sights and sounds on every side. Early in the afternoon it occurred to  her to surprise Tom at his post before the hour they had named.  Accordingly she dressed herself for the walk, putting into her pocket  a little purse she had bought as a Christmas gift for him, and  planning to give it to him then and there, so that he might bring home  in it the results of the day's sales. With a little inquiry she found  her way through the crowded streets to the market, which was like a  huge beehive--except that the bees had no stings. For on everybody's  face was the starlight of Christmas, and good-will toward men reigned  supreme. The sidewalks outside the market were simple avenues of  evergreen. It hung in festoons from the sides of the buildings and  overhead; it bubbled over from innumerable boxes and barrels, and ran  along the snowy curbstone in a fragrant stream. Rows of trees leaned  complacently against the posts and each other, meditating on glories  to come; holly glistened and twinkled in the red winter sunlight at  every window, and a few stout, jolly-looking marketmen had even  procured sprays of real English mistletoe, which they hung proudly  over their shop doors; but the full advantage of which, judging from  the freedom with which they allowed no end of pretty girls to pass to  and fro under it without molestation, they by no means appreciated.  Charity was delighted with everything, and half expected to see the  jovial \"Ghost of Christmas Present\" himself seated amidst the heaps  of plenty, scattering good things right and left. Failing of him, the  next best would certainly be Tom; whom, however, she sought in vain.  It was just three o'clock when she started again, a little wearily,  for the house.    \"I must have just missed him,\" she thought, \"and he'll be there  waiting for me.\"    No, Tom was not there, and had not been seen. Charity fingered the  purse in her pocket a little nervously, and waited. How brightly the  sun shone in the quiet street where her friends lived! The snow had  begun to melt here and there, and children, finding it properly moist  for their play, were tumbling about in it and making forts, men, and  snowballs. One keen-eyed little fellow moulded a lot of large  oblong-shaped balls, and came with an armful before the window where  Charity sat, making a mocking bow to her, and calling out:    \"Who wants to buy my nice melons! Here's your fine fresh fruit; all  ripe; all ripe!\"    Still no Tom. Charity tried to talk with her hosts, but it was hard  work, and she was glad when they left her to wait silently with her  eyes on the distant street corner where she had last seen him and his  evergreen. People came and went along the brick sidewalk. There were  little icy spots just in front of her window, where the gutter had  discharged the drip from the roof, and it had frozen in ridges the  night before. She became dully interested in watching the passers-by  get over this place. Some approached it cautiously and crept with  timid steps across the treacherous surface; some did not see it at  all until they were fairly upon it, and escaped with a slide and a  bound; some avoided it altogether by making a wide circuit into the  street; children slid fearlessly upon it, making sport of what was so  dangerous to their elders. One strong, well-built man--a clergyman he  appeared from his dress--started across it boldly but carefully,  slipped midway, and fell with such a crash that the girl uttered an  involuntary cry and started up from her chair; but the man regained  his feet and limped away, with an ugly stain across his shoulder and a  bit of red on his white hands.    While Charity gazed pityingly after him, a twinkling light appeared  far down the street; then another, and another. It could not be that  the lamps were being lighted! Yes, the short December day was over--it  was Christmas Eve.    Charity turned to look at the clock, but was obliged to move across  the room before she could see through the gathering dusk, that it  was--six o'clock!    She resolutely but hurriedly drew on her cloak, as she had done a few  hours before, in her own country home; and bidding good-bye to her  friends with lips which she could not keep from quivering, declined  all offer of escort and once more turned her face toward that busy  center of the holiday, the market. To and fro she went among the  kind-hearted dealers, with her one question repeated over and over  until she was sick at heart. No one had seen Tom since morning, one  or two looked at her a little curiously, and once a great burly fellow  engaged her very closely in conversation as a tall man in helmet and  brass buttons passed them, half carrying, half dragging a poor,  battered creature over the slippery sidewalk. It was an old,  white-haired man of whose wretched, drunken, despairing face she  caught a glimpse, as the throng of idle spectators swept by. Something  in the manner of her kind friend made her look up quickly at him. He  grew redder than ever, and quickly turned away his head; but it was  too late; she knew the truth at last. Tom was like--_that_!    After what seemed days of anguish she found herself in the stifling  atmosphere of the railroad station, where she would have to wait two  hours for a homeward-bound train. She shrank into a corner and tried  to forget herself in sleep, but every faculty was on the alert with an  unnatural tension. Women with tired faces and illy dressed babies sank  upon the seats about her and silently waited for their trains, or in  jarring, monotonous voices, and the minor keys always used by late  passengers, discussed the ailments of their neighbors and the high"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4320"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (#17)"],[1,"gives of the situation of his own mind in this particular, VIRTUE I  LOVE, says he, WITHOUT AUSTERITY: PLEASURE WITHOUT EFFEMINACY: AND LIFE,  WITHOUT FEARING ITS END. [Footnote: 'J'aime la vertu, sans rudesse;  J'aime le plaisir, sans molesse; J'aime la vie, et n'en crains point la  fin.'-ST. EVREMONT.]    Who is not struck with any signal instance of greatness of mind or  dignity of character; with elevation of sentiment, disdain of slavery,  and with that noble pride and spirit, which arises from conscious  virtue? The sublime, says Longinus, is often nothing but the echo or  image of magnanimity; and where this quality appears in any one,  even though a syllable be not uttered, it excites our applause and  admiration; as may be observed of the famous silence of Ajax in the  Odyssey, which expresses more noble disdain and resolute indignation  than any language can convey [Footnote: Cap. 9.].    WERE I Alexander, said Parmenio, I WOULD ACCEPT OF THESE OFFERS MADE BY  DARIUS. SO WOULD I TOO, replied Alexander, WERE I PARMENIO. This saying  is admirable, says Longinus, from a like principle. [Footnote: Idem.]    GO! cries the same hero to his soldiers, when they refused to follow  him to the Indies, GO TELL YOUR COUNTRYMEN, THAT YOU LEFT Alexander  COMPLETING THE CONQUEST OF THE WORLD. 'Alexander,' said the Prince of  Conde, who always admired this passage, 'abandoned by his soldiers,  among barbarians, not yet fully subdued, felt in himself such a dignity  and right of empire, that he could not believe it possible that any one  would refuse to obey him. Whether in Europe or in Asia, among Greeks or  Persians, all was indifferent to him: wherever he found men, he fancied  he should find subjects.'    The confident of Medea in the tragedy recommends caution and submission;  and enumerating all the distresses of that unfortunate heroine, asks  her, what she has to support her against her numerous and implacable  enemies. MYSELF, replies she; MYSELF I SAY, AND IT IS ENOUGH. Boileau  justly recommends this passage as an instance of true sublime [Footnote:  Reflexion 10 sur Longin.].    When Phocion, the modest, the gentle Phocion, was led to execution, he  turned to one of his fellow-sufferers, who was lamenting his own  hard fate, IS IT NOT GLORY ENOUGH FOR YOU, says he, THAT YOU DIE WITH  PHOCION? [Footnote: Plutarch in Phoc.]    Place in opposition the picture which Tacitus draws of Vitellius, fallen  from empire, prolonging his ignominy from a wretched love of life,  delivered over to the merciless rabble; tossed, buffeted, and kicked  about; constrained, by their holding a poniard under his chin, to raise  his head, and expose himself to every contumely. What abject infamy!  What low humiliation! Yet even here, says the historian, he discovered  some symptoms of a mind not wholly degenerate. To a tribune, who  insulted him, he replied, I AM STILL YOUR EMPEROR.           [Footnote: Tacit. hist. lib. iii. The author entering upon the  narration, says, LANIATA VESTE, FOEDUM SPECACULUM DUCEBATUR, MULTIS  INCREPANTIBUS, NULLO INLACRIMANTE: deformatitas exitus misericordiam  abstulerat. To enter thoroughly into this method of thinking, we must  make allowance for the ancient maxims, that no one ought to prolong his  life after it became dishonourable; but, as he had always a right to  dispose of it, it then became a duty to part with it.]    We never excuse the absolute want of spirit and dignity of character, or  a proper sense of what is due to one's self, in society and the common  intercourse of life. This vice constitutes what we properly call  MEANNESS; when a man can submit to the basest slavery, in order to  gain his ends; fawn upon those who abuse him; and degrade himself by  intimacies and familiarities with undeserving inferiors. A certain  degree of generous pride or self-value is so requisite, that the absence  of it in the mind displeases, after the same manner as the want of a  nose, eye, or any of the most material feature of the face or member of  the body.           [Footnote: The absence of virtue may often be a vice; and that of  the highest kind; as in the instance of ingratitude, as well as  meanness. Where we expect a beauty, the disappointment gives an uneasy  sensation, and produces a real deformity. An abjectness of character,  likewise, is disgustful and contemptible in another view. Where a man  has no sense of value in himself, we are not likely to have any higher  esteem of him. And if the same person, who crouches to his superiors,  is insolent to his inferiors (as often happens), this contrariety  of behaviour, instead of correcting the former vice, aggravates it  extremely by the addition of a vice still more odious. See Sect. VIII.]    The utility of courage, both to the public and to the person possessed  of it, is an obvious foundation of merit. But to any one who duly  considers of the matter, it will appear that this quality has a peculiar  lustre, which it derives wholly from itself, and from that noble  elevation inseparable from it. Its figure, drawn by painters and by  poets, displays, in each feature, a sublimity and daring confidence;  which catches the eye, engages the affections, and diffuses, by  sympathy, a like sublimity of sentiment over every spectator.    Under what shining colours does Demosthenes [Footnote: De  Corona.] represent Philip; where the orator apologizes for his own  administration, and justifies that pertinacious love of liberty, with  which he had inspired the Athenians. 'I beheld Philip,' says he, 'he  with whom was your contest, resolutely, while in pursuit of empire  and dominion, exposing himself to every wound; his eye gored, his neck  wrested, his arm, his thigh pierced, what ever part of his body fortune  should seize on, that cheerfully relinquishing; provided that, with what  remained, he might live in honour and renown. And shall it be said  that he, born in Pella, a place heretofore mean and ignoble, should  be inspired with so high an ambition and thirst of fame: while you,  Athenians, &c.' These praises excite the most lively admiration; but  the views presented by the orator, carry us not, we see, beyond the hero  himself, nor ever regard the future advantageous consequences of his  valour.    The material temper of the Romans, inflamed by continual wars, had  raised their esteem of courage so high, that, in their language, it was  called VIRTUE, by way of excellence and of distinction from all other  moral qualities. THE Suevi, in the opinion of Tacitus, tus, [Footnote:  De moribus Germ.] DRESSED THEIR HAIR WITH A LAUDIBLE INTENT: NOT  FOR THE PURPOSE OF LOVING OR BEING LOVES; THEY DORNED THEMSELVES ONLY  FOR THEIR ENEMIES, AND IN ORDER TO APPEAR MORE TERRIBLE. A sentiment  of the historian, which would sound a little oddly in other nations and  other ages.    The Scythians, according to Herodotus, [Footnote: Lib. iv.] after  scalping their enemies, dressed the skin like leather, and used it as a  towel; and whoever had the most of those towels was most esteemed among  them. So much had martial bravery, in that nation, as well as in many  others, destroyed the sentiments of humanity; a virtue surely much more  useful and engaging.    It is indeed observable, that, among all uncultivated nations, who have  not as yet had full experience of the advantages attending beneficence,  justice, and the social virtues, courage is the predominant excellence;  what is most celebrated by poets, recommended by parents and  instructors, and admired by the public in general. The ethics of Homer  are, in this particular, very different from those of Fenelon, his  elegant imitator; and such as were well suited to an age, when one hero,  as remarked by Thucydides [Lib.i.], could ask another, without offence,  whether he were a robber or not. Such also very lately was the system  of ethics which prevailed in many barbarous parts of Ireland; if we may  credit Spencer, in his judicious account of the state of that kingdom.           [Footnote from Spencer: It is a common use, says he, amongst  their gentlemen's sons, that, as soon as they are able to use their  weapons, they strait gather to themselves three or four stragglers or  kern, with whom wandering a while up and down idly the country, taking  only meat, he at last falleth into some bad occasion, that shall be  offered; which being once made known, he is thenceforth counted a man of  worth, in whom there is courage.]    Of the same class of virtues with courage is that undisturbed  philosophical tranquillity, superior to pain, sorrow, anxiety, and  each assault of adverse fortune. Conscious of his own virtue, say the  philosophers, the sage elevates himself above every accident of life;  and securely placed in the temple of wisdom, looks down on inferior  mortals engaged in pursuit of honours, riches, reputation, and every  frivolous enjoyment. These pretentious, no doubt, when stretched to  the utmost, are by far too magnificent for human nature. They carry,  however, a grandeur with them, which seizes the spectator, and strikes  him with admiration. And the nearer we can approach in practice to this  sublime tranquillity and indifference (for we must distinguish it from a  stupid insensibility), the more secure enjoyment shall we attain within  ourselves, and the more greatness of mind shall we discover to the  world. The philosophical tranquillity may, indeed, be considered only as  a branch of magnanimity.    Who admires not Socrates; his perpetual serenity and contentment, amidst  the greatest poverty and domestic vexations; his resolute contempt of  riches, and his magnanimous care of preserving liberty, while he refused  all assistance from his friends and disciples, and avoided even the  dependence of an obligation? Epictetus had not so much as a door to his  little house or hovel; and therefore, soon lost his iron lamp, the only  furniture which he had worth taking. But resolving"]]]
