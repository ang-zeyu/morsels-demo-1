Her refusal had been clear and gentle; after it--as the horrid phrase  went--she had been exactly the same to him as before. Three months  later, on the margin of Italy, among the flower-clad Alps, he had asked  her again in bald, traditional language. She reminded him of a Leonardo  more than ever; her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock;  at his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with  immeasurable plains behind her. He walked home with her unashamed,  feeling not at all like a rejected suitor. The things that really  mattered were unshaken.    So now he had asked her once more, and, clear and gentle as ever, she  had accepted him, giving no coy reasons for her delay, but simply saying  that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy. His mother,  too, would be pleased; she had counselled the step; he must write her a  long account.    Glancing at his hand, in case any of Freddy's chemicals had come off  on it, he moved to the writing table. There he saw \"Dear Mrs. Vyse,\"  followed by many erasures. He recoiled without reading any more, and  after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere, and pencilled a note on  his knee.    Then he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as  the first, and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner  drawing-room more distinctive. With that outlook it should have been a  successful room, but the trail of Tottenham Court Road was upon it; he  could almost visualize the motor-vans of Messrs. Shoolbred and Messrs.  Maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair, those varnished  book-cases, that writing-table. The table recalled Mrs. Honeychurch's  letter. He did not want to read that letter--his temptations never lay  in that direction; but he worried about it none the less. It was his  own fault that she was discussing him with his mother; he had wanted her  support in his third attempt to win Lucy; he wanted to feel that others,  no matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had asked their  permission. Mrs. Honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in essentials,  while as for Freddy--\"He is only a boy,\" he reflected. \"I represent all  that he despises. Why should he want me for a brother-in-law?\"    The Honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize  that Lucy was of another clay; and perhaps--he did not put it very  definitely--he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as  soon as possible.    \"Mr. Beebe!\" said the maid, and the new rector of Summer Street was  shown in; he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to Lucy's  praise of him in her letters from Florence.    Cecil greeted him rather critically.    \"I've come for tea, Mr. Vyse. Do you suppose that I shall get it?\"    \"I should say so. Food is the thing one does get here--Don't sit in that  chair; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it.\"    \"Pfui!\"    \"I know,\" said Cecil. \"I know. I can't think why Mrs. Honeychurch allows  it.\"    For Cecil considered the bone and the Maples' furniture separately; he  did not realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the  life that he desired.    \"I've come for tea and for gossip. Isn't this news?\"    \"News? I don't understand you,\" said Cecil. \"News?\"    Mr. Beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.    \"I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up; I have every reason to hope that I  am first in the field. He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack!\"    \"Has he indeed?\" said Cecil, trying to recover himself. Into what a  grotesque mistake had he fallen! Was it likely that a clergyman and a  gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant? But his  stiffness remained, and, though he asked who Cissie and Albert might be,  he still thought Mr. Beebe rather a bounder.    \"Unpardonable question! To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not  to have met Cissie and Albert, the semi-detached villas that have been  run up opposite the church! I'll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you.\"    \"I'm shockingly stupid over local affairs,\" said the young man  languidly. \"I can't even remember the difference between a Parish  Council and a Local Government Board. Perhaps there is no difference, or  perhaps those aren't the right names. I only go into the country to see  my friends and to enjoy the scenery. It is very remiss of me. Italy and  London are the only places where I don't feel to exist on sufferance.\"    Mr. Beebe, distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert,  determined to shift the subject.    \"Let me see, Mr. Vyse--I forget--what is your profession?\"    \"I have no profession,\" said Cecil. \"It is another example of my  decadence. My attitude--quite an indefensible one--is that so long as I  am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like. I know I ought  to be getting money out of people, or devoting myself to things I don't  care a straw about, but somehow, I've not been able to begin.\"    \"You are very fortunate,\" said Mr. Beebe. \"It is a wonderful  opportunity, the possession of leisure.\"    His voice was rather parochial, but he did not quite see his way to  answering naturally. He felt, as all who have regular occupation must  feel, that others should have it also.    \"I am glad that you approve. I daren't face the healthy person--for  example, Freddy Honeychurch.\"    \"Oh, Freddy's a good sort, isn't he?\"    \"Admirable. The sort who has made England what she is.\"    Cecil wondered at himself. Why, on this day of all others, was he so  hopelessly contrary? He tried to get right by inquiring effusively after  Mr. Beebe's mother, an old lady for whom he had no particular regard.  Then he flattered the clergyman, praised his liberal-mindedness, his  enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science.    \"Where are the others?\" said Mr. Beebe at last, \"I insist on extracting  tea before evening service.\"    \"I suppose Anne never told them you were here. In this house one is so  coached in the servants the day one arrives. The fault of Anne is  that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly, and kicks the  chair-legs with her feet. The faults of Mary--I forget the faults of  Mary, but they are very grave. Shall we look in the garden?\"    \"I know the faults of Mary. She leaves the dust-pans standing on the  stairs.\"    \"The fault of Euphemia is that she will not, simply will not, chop the  suet sufficiently small.\"    They both laughed, and things began to go better.    \"The faults of Freddy--\" Cecil continued.    \"Ah, he has too many. No one but his mother can remember the faults of  Freddy. Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch; they are not innumerable.\"    \"She has none,\" said the young man, with grave sincerity.    \"I quite agree. At present she has none.\"    \"At present?\"    \"I'm not cynical. I'm only thinking of my pet theory about Miss  Honeychurch. Does it seem reasonable that she should play so  wonderfully, and live so quietly? I suspect that one day she will be  wonderful in both. The water-tight compartments in her will break down,  and music and life will mingle. Then we shall have her heroically good,  heroically bad--too heroic, perhaps, to be good or bad.\"    Cecil found his companion interesting.    \"And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes?\"    \"Well, I must say I've only seen her at Tunbridge Wells, where she was  not wonderful, and at Florence. Since I came to Summer Street she has  been away. You saw her, didn't you, at Rome and in the Alps. Oh, I  forgot; of course, you knew her before. No, she wasn't wonderful in  Florence either, but I kept on expecting that she would be.\"    \"In what way?\"    Conversation had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and  down the terrace.    \"I could as easily tell you what tune she'll play next. There was simply  the sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them. I can show  you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary: Miss Honeychurch as a  kite, Miss Bartlett holding the string. Picture number two: the string  breaks.\"    The sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he  viewed things artistically. At the time he had given surreptitious tugs  to the string himself.    \"But the string never broke?\"    \"No. I mightn't have seen Miss Honeychurch rise, but I should certainly  have heard Miss Bartlett fall.\"    \"It has broken now,\" said the young man in low, vibrating tones.    Immediately he realized that of all the conceited, ludicrous,  contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst. He  cursed his love of metaphor; had he suggested that he was a star and  that Lucy was soaring up to reach him?    \"Broken? What do you mean?\"    \"I meant,\" said Cecil stiffly, \"that she is going to marry me.\"    The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could  not keep out of his voice.    \"I am sorry; I must apologize. I had no idea you were intimate with her,  or I should never have talked in this flippant, superficial way. Mr.  Vyse, you ought to have stopped me.\" And down the garden he saw Lucy  herself; yes, he was disappointed.    Cecil, who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies, drew down  his mouth at the corners. Was this the reception his action would get  from the world? Of course, he despised the world as a whole; every  thoughtful man should; it is almost a test of refinement. But he was  sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered.    Occasionally he could be quite crude.    \"I am sorry I have given you a shock,\" he said dryly. \"I fear that  Lucy's choice does not meet with your approval.\"    \"Not that. But you ought to have stopped me. I know Miss Honeychurch  only a little as time goes. Perhaps I oughtn't to have discussed her so  freely with any one; certainly not with you.\"    \"You are conscious of having said something indiscreet?\"    Mr. Beebe pulled himself together. Really,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26457"],[0,"New observations on the natural history of bees (#17)"],[1,"what had grown in the smallest cells. I thence  concluded, that the larvae of workers do not acquire greater size in  large than in small cells. Although this experiment was made only once,  it seems decisive. Nature has appropriated cells of certain dimensions  for the worms of workers while in their vermicular state; undoubtedly  she has ordained that their organs should be fully expanded, and there  is sufficient space for that purpose; therefore more would be useless.  Their expansion ought to be no greater in the most spacious cells than  in those appropriated for them. If some cells smaller than common ones  are found in combs, and the eggs of workers are deposited there, the  size of the bees will probably be less than that of common workers,  because they have been cramped in the cells; but it does not thence  ensue, that a larger cell will admit of them growing to a greater size.    The effect produced on the size of drones by the size of the cells their  worms inhabit, may serve as a rule for what should happen to the larvae  of workers in the same circumstances. The large cells of males are  sufficiently capacious for the perfect expansion of their organs. Thus,  although reared in cells of still greater capacity, they will grow no  larger than common drones. We have had evidence of this in those  produced by queens whose fecundation has been retarded. You will  remember, Sir, that they sometimes lay male eggs in the royal cells.  Now, the males proceeding from them, and reared in cells much more  spacious than nature has appropriated for them, are no larger than  common males. Therefore it is certain, that whatever be the size of the  cells where the worms acquire their increment, the bees will attain no  greater size than is peculiar to their species. But if, in their primary  form, they live in cells smaller than they should be, as their growth  will be checked, they will not attain the usual size, of which there is  proof in the following experiment. I had a comb consisting of the cell  of large drones, and one with those of workers, which also served for  the male worms. Of these, my assistant took a certain number from the  smallest cells, and deposited them on a quantity of food purposely  prepared in the large ones; and in return he introduced into the small  cells the worms that had been hatched in the other, and then committed  both to the care of the workers in a hive where the queen laid the eggs  of males only. The bees were not affected by this change; they took  equal care of the worms; and when the period of metamorphosis arrived,  gave both kinds that convex covering usually put on those of the males.  Eight days afterwards, we removed the combs, and found, as I had  expected, nymphs of large males in the large cells, and those of small  males in the small ones.    You suggested another experiment which I carefully made, but it met with  an unforeseen obstacle. To appreciate the influence of the royal food on  the expansion of the worms, you desired me to supply the worm of a  worker in a common cell with it. Twice I have attempted this operation  without success. Nor do I think it can ever succeed. If bees get the  charge of worms, in whose cells the royal food is deposited, and if at  the same time they have a queen, they soon remove the worms and greedily  devour the food. When, on the contrary, they are deprived of a queen,  they change the cells containing worms into cells of the largest kind.  Then the worms will infallibly be converted to queens.    But there is another situation where we can judge of the influence of  the royal food administered to worms in common cells. I have spoken at  great length in my letter on the existence of fertile workers. You  cannot forget, Sir, that the expansion of their sexual organs is owing  to the reception of some particles of royal jelly, while in the  vermicular form. For want of new observations, I must refer you to what  is previously said on the subject.      _PREGNY, 4 September 1791._          LETTER IX.    _ON THE FORMATION OF SWARMS._      I can add but a few facts to the information M. de Reaumur has  communicated relative to swarms.    A young queen, according to this celebrated naturalist, is always or  almost always at the head of a swarm; but he does not assert the fact  positively, and had some doubts on the subject. \"Is it certain,\" says  he \"as we have hitherto supposed, in coincidence with all who have  treated of bees, that the new colony is always conducted by a young  mother? May not the old mother be disgusted with her habitation? or may  she not be influenced by some particular circumstances to abandon all  her possessions to the young female? I wish it had been in my power to  solve this question otherwise than by mere probabilities, and that some  misfortune had not befallen all the bees whose queen I had marked red on  the thorax.\"    These expressions seem to indicate, that M. de Reaumur suspected that  the old queens sometimes conducted the young swarms. By the following  details, you will observe, that his suspicions are fully justified.    In the course of spring and summer, the same hive may throw several  swarms. The old queen is always at the head of the first colony; the  others are conducted by young queens. Such is the fact which I shall now  prove; and the peculiarities attending it shall be related.    But previous to entering on this subject, I should repeat what has  already been frequently observed, that the _leaf_ or flat hives are  indispensible in studying the industry and instinct of bees. When they  are left at liberty to conduct several rows of parallel combs, we can no  longer observe what is continually passing between them, or they must be  dislodged by water or smoke, for examining what has been constructed; a  violent proceeding, which has a material influence on their instinct,  and consequently exposes an observer to the risk of supposing simple  accidents permanent laws.    I now proceed to experiments proving that an old queen always conducts  the first swarm.    One of my glass hives consisted of three parallel combs, placed in  squares that opened like the leaves of a book. It was well peopled and  abundantly provided with honey, wax, and brood, of every age. On the  fifth of May 1788, I removed the queen, and on the sixth, transferred  all the bees into another hive, with a fertile queen at least a year  old. They entered easily and without fighting, and were in general well  received. The old inhabitants of the hive, which, since privation of  their queen, had begun twelve royal cells, also gave the fertile queen a  good reception; they presented her with honey, and formed regular  circles around her. However, there was a little agitation in the  evening, but confined to the surface of the comb where we had put the  queen, and which she had not quitted. All was perfectly quiet on the  other side of this comb.    In the morning of the seventh, the bees had destroyed the twelve royal  cells, but, independent of that, order continued prevalent in the hive;  the queen laid the eggs of males in the large cells, and those of  workers in the small ones, respectively.    Towards the twelfth, we found the bees occupied in constructing  twenty-two royal cells, of the same species described by M. de Reaumur,  that is the bases not in the plane of the comb, but appended  perpendicularly by pedicles or stalks of different length, like  stalactites, on the edge of the passage made by the bees through their  combs. They bore considerable resemblance to the cup of an acorn, and  the longest were only about two lines and a half in depth from the  bottom to the orifice.    On the thirteenth, the queen seemed already more slender than when  introduced into the hive; however she still laid some eggs, both in  common cells and those of males. We also surprised her this day laying  in a royal cell: she first dislodged the worker there employed, by  pushing it away with her head, and then supported herself by the  adjoining cells while depositing the egg.    On the fifteenth, the queen was still more slender: the bees continued  their attention to the royal cells, which were all unequally advanced;  some to three or four lines in height, while others were already an inch  long; which proved that the queen had not laid in the whole at the same  time.    At the moment when least expected, the hive swarmed on the nineteenth;  we were warned of it by the noise in the air; and hastened to collect  and put the bees into a hive purposely prepared. Though we had  overlooked the facts attending the departure of the swarm, the object of  this experiment was fulfilled; for, on examination of all the bees, we  were convinced they had been conducted by the old queen; by that we  introduced on the sixth of the month, and which had been deprived of one  of the antennae. Observe, there was no other queen in this colony. In the  hive she had left, we found seven royal cells close at the top, but open  at the side, and quite empty. Eleven more were sealed; and some others  newly begun; no queen remained in the hive.    The new swarm next became the object of our attention: we observed it  during the rest of the year, during winter and the subsequent spring;  and, in April, we had the satisfaction of seeing a new swarm depart with  the same queen at its head that had conducted the former swarm in May  the preceding year.    You will remark, Sir, that this experiment is positive. We put an old  queen in a glass hive while laying the eggs of males. The bees received  her well, and at that time began to construct royal cells; she laid in  one of them before us; and in the last place led forth the swarm.    We have several times repeated the same experiment with equal success.  Thus it appears incontestible, that the old queen always conducts the  first swarm; but never quits the hive before depositing eggs in the"]]]
