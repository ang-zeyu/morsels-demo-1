With their safer help he easily skimmed up to Pitman's bridge,  which he had determined on for his station. He knew that thence his  lantern could be seen for a mile, and that yet there the train might  safely be stopped, so near was the open causeway which he had just  traversed. He had no fear of an up-train behind him.    So Silas walked back and forth, and sang, and spouted \"pieces,\" and  mused on the future of his life, and spouted \"pieces\" again, and sang in  the loneliness. How the time passed, he did not know. No sound of clock,  no baying of dog, no plash of waterfall, broke that utter stillness. The  wind, thank God, had at last died away; and Silas paced his beat in a  long oval he made for himself, under and beyond the bridge, with no  sound but his own voice when he chose to raise it. He expected, as they  all did, that every moment the whistle of the train, as it swept into  sight a mile or more away, would break the silence; so he paced, and  shouted, and sang.    \"This is a man's duty,\" he said to himself: \"they would not let me go  with the fifth regiment,--not as a drummer boy; but this is duty such as  no drummer boy of them all is doing. Company, march!\" and he \"stepped  forward smartly\" with his left foot. \"Really I am placed on guard here  quite as much as if I were on picket in Virginia.\" \"Who goes there?\"  \"Advance, friend, and give the countersign.\" Not that any one did go  there, or could go there; but the boy's fancy was ready, and so he  amused himself during the first hours. Then he began to wonder whether  they were hours, as they seemed, or whether this was all a wretched  illusion,--that the time passed slowly to him because he was nothing but  a boy, and did not know how to occupy his mind. So he resolutely said  the multiplication-table from the beginning to the end, and from the end  to the beginning,--first to himself, and again aloud, to make it slower.  Then he tried the ten commandments. \"Thou shalt have none other Gods  before me:\" easy to say that beneath those stars; and he said them  again. No, it is no illusion. I must have been here hours long! Then he  began on Milton's hymn:--          \"It was the winter wild,        While the heaven-born child,      All meanly wrapt, in the rude manger lies.\"    \"Winter wild, indeed,\" said Silas aloud; and, if he had only known it,  at that moment the sun beneath his feet was crossing the meridian,  midnight had passed already, and Christmas day was born!            \"Only with speeches fair          She wooes the gentle air      To hide her guilty front with innocent snow.\"    \"Innocent, indeed,\" said poor Silas, still aloud, \"much did he know of  innocent snow!\" And vainly did he try to recall the other stanzas, as he  paced back and forth, round and round, and began now to wonder where his  father and the others were, and if they could have come to any  misfortune. Surely, they could not have forgotten that he was here.  Would that train never come?    If he were not afraid of its coming at once, he would have run back to  the causeway to look for their lights,--and perhaps they had a fire. Why  had he not brought an axe for a fire? \"That rail fence above would have  served perfectly,--nay, it is not five rods to a load of hickory we left  the day before Thanksgiving. Surely one of them might come up to me with  an axe. But maybe there is trouble below. They might have come with an  axe--with an axe--with an axe--with an--axe\"--\"I am going to sleep,\"  cried Silas,--aloud again this time,--as his head dropped heavily on the  handle of the shovel he was resting on there in the lee of the stone  wall. \"I am going to sleep,--that will never do. Sentinel asleep at his  post. Order out the relief. Blind his eyes. Kneel, sir. Make ready.  Fire. That, sir, for sentinels asleep.\" And so Silas laughed grimly, and  began his march again. Then he took his shovel and began a great pit  where he supposed the track might be beneath him. \"Anything to keep warm  and to keep awake. But why did they not send up to him? Why was he here?  Why was he all alone? He who had never been alone before. Was he alone?  Was there companionship in the stars,--or in the good God who held the  stars? Did the good God put me here? If he put me here, will he keep me  here? Or did he put me here to die! To die in this cold? It is cold,--it  is very cold! Is there any good in my dying? The train will run down,  and they will see a dead body lying under the bridge,--black on the  snow, with a red lantern by it. Then they will stop. Shall I--I  will--just go back to see if the lights are at the bend. I will leave  the lantern here on the edge of this wall!\" And so Silas turned, half  benumbed, worked his way nearly out of the gorge, and started as he  heard, or thought he heard, a baby's scream. \"A thousand babies are  starving, and I am afraid to stay here to give them their life,\" he  said. \"There is a boy fit for a soldier! Order out the relief! Drum-head  court-martial! Prisoner, hear your sentence! Deserter, to be shot!  Blindfold,--kneel, sir! Fire! Good enough for deserters!\" And so poor  Silas worked back again to the lantern.    And now he saw and felt sure that Orion was bending downward, and he  knew that the night must be broken; and, with some new hope, throwing  down the shovel with which he had been working, he began his soldier  tramp once more,--as far as soldier tramp was possible with those  trailing snow-shoes,--tried again on \"No war nor battle sound,\" broke  down on \"Cynthia's seat\" and the \"music of the spheres;\" but at  last,--working on \"beams,\" \"long beams,\" and \"that with long beams,\"--he  caught the stanzas he was feeling for, and broke out exultant with,--          \"At last surrounds their sight,        A globe of circular light      That with long beams the shame-faced night arrayed;        The helmed cherubim        And sworded seraphim      Are seen in glittering ranks--\"    \"Globe of circular light--am I dreaming, or have they come!\"--    Come they had! The globe of circular light swept full over the valley,  and the scream of the engine was welcomed by the freezing boy as if it  had been an angel's whisper to him. Not unprepared did it find him. The  red lantern swung to and fro in a well-practised hand, and he was in  waiting on his firmest spot as the train _slowed_ and the engine passed  him.    \"Do not stop for me,\" he cried, as he threw his weight heavily on the  tender side, and the workmen dragged him in. \"Only run slow till you are  out of the ledge: we have made a milk station at the cross-road.\"    \"Good for you!\" said the wondering fireman, who in a moment understood  the exigency. The heavy plough threw out the snow steadily still, in ten  seconds they were clear of the ledge, and saw the fire-light shimmering  on the great pyramids of milk-cans. Slower and slower ran the train,  and by the blazing fire stopped, for once, because its masters chose to  stop. And the working party on the train cheered lustily as they tumbled  out of the cars, as they apprehended the situation, and were cheered by  the working party from the village.    Two or three cans of milk stood on the embers of the fire, that they  might be ready for the men on the train with something that was at least  warm. An empty passenger car was opened and the pyramids of milk-cans  were hurried into it,--forty men now assisting.    \"You will find Joe Winter at the Boston station,\" said John Stevens to  the \"gentlemanly conductor\" of the express, whose lightning train had  thus become a milk convoy. \"Tell Winter to distribute this among all the  carts, that everybody may have some. Good luck to you. Good-by!\" And the  engines snorted again, and John Stevens turned back, not so much as  thinking that he had made his Christmas present to a starving town.      V.    CHRISTMAS MORNING.    The children were around Robert Walter's knees, and each of the two  spelled out a verse of the second chapter of Luke, on Christmas morning.  And Robert and Mary kneeled with them, and they said together, \"Our  Father who art in heaven.\" Mary's voice broke a little when they came to  \"daily bread,\" but with the two, and her husband, she continued to the  end, and could say \"thine is the power,\" and believe it too.    \"Mamma,\" whispered little Fanny, as she kissed her mother after the  prayer, \"when I said my prayer up stairs last night, I said 'our daily  milk,' and so did Robert.\" This was more than poor Mary could bear. She  kissed the child, and she hurried away.    For last night at six o'clock it was clear that the milk was sour, and  little Jamie had detected it first of all. Then, with every one of the  old wiles, they had gone back over the old slops; but the child, with  that old weird strength, had pushed them all away. Christmas morning  broke, and poor Robert, as soon as light would serve, had gone to the  neighbors all,--their nearest intimates they had tried the night  before,--and from all had brought back the same reply; one friend had  sent a wretched sample, but the boy detected the taint and pushed it,  untasted, away. Dr. Morton had the alarm the day before. He was at the  house earlier than usual with some condensed milk, which his wife's  stores had furnished; but that would not answer. Poor Jamie pushed this  by. There was some smoke or something,--who should say what?--it would  not do. The doctor could see in an instant how his patient had fallen  back in the night. That weird, anxious, entreating look, as his head lay  back on the little pillow, had all come back again. Robert and Robert's  friends, Gaisford and Warren, had gone down to the Old Colony, to the  Worcester, and to the Hartford stations. Perhaps their trains were doing  better. The door-bell rang yet again. \"Mrs. Appleton's love to Mrs.  Walter, and perhaps her child will try some fresh beef-tea.\" As if poor  Jamie"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32530"],[0,"Armageddon—2419 A.D.
