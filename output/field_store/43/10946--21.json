Chitin    Feathers    Many of the plants eaten by the mice had large numbers of crystals in  the epidermis. Druses were the most abundant, but raphid crystals also  were seen. Every slide contained at least one species of plant which  contained druses. Such crystals are composed mostly of calcium oxalate  (Esau, 1960:41). In Mesa Verde, families of plants having crystals  include: Boraginaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Compositae, Cruciferae,  Leguminosae, Liliaceae, Malvaceae, Ornargraceae, Rosaceae, and  Saxifragaceae. Calcium oxalate is a highly insoluble compound and is  innocuous if it passes through the gastro-intestinal tract without being  absorbed. In rats of the genus _Neotoma_, some calcium oxalate  passes through the intestines unchanged, but large amounts of calcium  are absorbed through the intestine. The urine of pack rats is creamy in  color and contains calcium carbonate. It is not understood how these  rats metabolize the highly toxic oxalic acid, when converting calcium  oxalate to calcium carbonate (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1964:147-148). Apparently  calcium oxalate passes through the intestine unchanged in both species  of _Peromyscus_, for their urine is clear and yellowish.    Although both species of mice appear to prefer plants having soft  leaves, some plants having coarse leaves also are eaten. Many of the  slides contained isolated sclerids. The stomach contents of one  individual of _P. truei_ contained a small fragment of the epidermis of  _Yucca_. This fragment may have come from a young shoot. It is unlikely  that _Peromyscus_ would eat the larger, coarser leaves of _Yucca_.    Pinyon and juniper nuts were found in nests of all mice. Captive mice  were especially fond of pinyon nuts, and these probably provide a  substantial part of the diet of _Peromyscus_ in the autumn and early  winter. The winter staple of _P. truei_ appears to be juniper seeds.  Nesting sites of this mouse often could be located by the mounds of  discarded seeds lying nearby.    Both species eat pinyon and juniper seeds; since _P. truei_ lives in the  forest, it has better access to these foods than does _P. maniculatus_.  Mice remove the embryos of juniper seeds by chewing a small hole in the  larger end of the seed. The seed coats of juniper are extremely hard,  and a considerable amount of effort must be expended to remove the  embryo. Captives discarded the resinous and pithy, outer layers of  juniper berries. Individuals of _P. truei_ are adept climbers. Since  many juniper berries remain on branches throughout the winter, the  ability of these mice to forage in the trees would be especially  advantageous when snow covers the ground.          WATER CONSUMPTION      _Peromyscus maniculatus_ is ubiquitous, occurring in habitats ranging  from mesic boreal forests to arid southwestern deserts. Most subspecies  of _P. maniculatus_ live in moderately mesic or near-mesic environments,  but a few have adapted to arid conditions. It has been assumed that the  success of _P. maniculatus_ in inhabiting such diverse habitats is  associated with its adaptability to different kinds of food and varying  amount of available water (Williams, 1959b:606).    Throughout its range _P. maniculatus_ coexists with one or more other  species of _Peromyscus_ that are more restricted in distribution.  _Peromyscus truei_ is one such species.    Both species live under xeric or near-xeric conditions, for the climate  of Mesa Verde is semi-arid. Other than a few widely-scattered springs,  there are no sources of free water on the top of the Mesa Verde land  mass; thus animals inhabiting the park must rely upon moisture in the  plants and other foods they eat, or upon dew.    Several investigators have studied water consumption in mice of the  genus _Peromyscus_ (Table 7). Dice (1922) did so for the prairie deer  mouse, _P. m. bairdii_, and the forest deer mouse, _P. leucopus  noveboracensis_, under varying environmental conditions. He found that  both species drank about the same amounts of water per gram of body  weight, and that food and water requirements did not differ sufficiently  to be the basis for the habitat differences between these species.  Neither of his samples was from an arid environment. Chew (1951) studied  water consumption in _P. leucopus_, and recently reviewed the literature  on water metabolism of mammals (Chew, 1965). In his studies of five  subspecies of two species of _Peromyscus_, Ross (1930) found significant  differences in water consumption between species but not between  subspecies within a species. One of the subspecies of _P. maniculatus_  tested was from a desert region, whereas the other two were from mesic  areas along the coast of California.    Lindeborg (1952) was the first to measure water consumption of both _P.  m. rufinus_ and _P. t. truei_, the species and subspecies with which my  experiments are concerned. Lindeborg also tested the ability of five  races of _Peromyscus_ to survive reduced water rations. Unfortunately,  the subspecies chosen for these experiments did not include _P. t.  truei_ or _P. m. rufinus_. Lindeborg (1952:25) found that the \"amounts  of water consumed by various species of _Peromyscus_ from different  habitats within the same climatic region were not conclusively  different.\" However, he did find significant differences between some  subspecies from different geographical areas. For example, he found no  significant difference in water consumption between _P. m. bairdii_ from  Michigan and either _P. m. blandus_ or _P. m. rufinus_ from New Mexico,  but he found a highly significant difference between _P. l.  noveboracensis_ from Michigan and _P. l. tornillo_ from New Mexico.  Lindeborg also found that the subspecies of _Peromyscus_ that consumed  the least water, and that were best able to survive a reduced water  ration, were those from the more xeric climatic areas.    Some mammals may be able to change their diets in times of water stress,  and thereby compensate for a shortage of water. At such times,  _Dipodomys_ selects foods with high percentages of carbohydrates and  conserves water by reducing the amounts of nitrogenous wastes to be  excreted (Schmidt-Nielsen _et al._, 1948).    Williams (1959b) found that _P. m. osgoodi_ from Colorado drank more  water on a diet rich in protein than on one rich in carbohydrates. But,  her mice on a high carbohydrate diet used less than a normal amount of  water for a period of only five weeks; at the end of the five weeks they  were drinking about as much as they had been when on the control diet of  laboratory chow. Likewise, mice adjusted to the high protein diet by  consuming more water; but by the end of the fifth week their daily water  consumption approximated the amount drunk when fed on laboratory chow.  Because of these results, Williams questioned the validity of the  assumption that _P. maniculatus_ is able to inhabit a diversity of  habitats because of its adaptability with respect to food and water  requirements.    I conducted a series of experiments on water and food consumption by  individuals of _P. truei_ and _P. maniculatus_. It was thought that if  there were differences in water or food consumption, or both, knowledge  of them might help to explain the obvious differences in habitat  preferences of these two species in Mesa Verde National Park.    In August of 1965, 30 individuals of _P. truei_ and _P. maniculatus_  were trapped in Mesa Verde National Park at elevations of 7000-8400  feet, and transported to Lawrence, Kansas, where the experiments were  carried out.    Mice were housed in individual metal cages (10 x 7.5 x 5 inches), having  removable tops of wire mesh, and an externally-mounted water bottle that  had a drop-type spout extending into the cage. Cages were on one of five  shelves of a movable tier of shelving, and were rotated randomly, from  one shelf to another, each week. A layer of dry wood shavings covered  the bottom of each cage. A control cage was similarly equipped.    The mice were kept in a room in which temperature and photoperiod were  controlled. The ambient air temperature of this room was 20 to 23  degrees Centigrade throughout the experiments, and averaged 21 degrees.  Humidity was not controlled, but remained low throughout the  experiments. The room was illuminated for eight hours each day, from  about 9 A. M. to 5 P. M.    The animals were fed at least once a week, at which time all remaining  food was weighed and discarded, and the remaining water was measured.  Tap water was used in all of the experiments. The cages were cleaned  each week. Each time the cages containing mice were handled, the control  cage was handled in the same way. The amount of evaporation was  determined each week by measuring the water remaining in the bottle of  the control cage.    Water and food consumption of individuals of _P. maniculatus_ and _P.  truei_ were measured when the mice were fed diets of differing protein  content. To my knowledge, the only other study in which water  consumption was measured for mice of the genus _Peromyscus_ on diets of  different protein contents was by Williams (1959b). Because of the  limited number of animals available, it was decided that the best  results could be obtained by placing all individuals on the same diet  for a predetermined number of weeks, then on a second diet for a certain  period, and so on.    Each mouse was weighed at the beginning, at the mid-point, and at the  end of each experiment.

For the first night Captain Stokes anchored in San Nicolas Bay, and in the  evening examined a harbour[58] behind Nassau Island, which Bougainville, in  the year 1765, visited for the purpose of procuring wood for the French  settlement at the Falkland Islands.    On the second night, after a day nearly calm, the Beagle was anchored in a  cove to the eastward of Cape Froward, and the next day (17th) passed round  the Cape, carrying a heavy press of sail against a dead foul wind. Captain  Stokes's account of this day's beat to windward will give the reader an  idea of the sort of navigation.    \"Our little bay had screened us so completely from the wind, that though,  when (at five A.M.) we weighed, the breeze was so light as scarcely to  enable us, with all sail set, to clear its entrance; no sooner were we  outside, than we were obliged to treble reef the topsails. We continued to  beat to windward under a heavy press of sail; our object being to double  Cape Froward, and secure, if possible, an anchorage ere night-fall under  Cape Holland, six leagues further to the westward. At first we made  'boards' right across the Straits to within a third of a mile of each  shore, gaining, however, but little. We then tried whether, by confining  our tacks to either coast, we could discover a tide by which we might  profit; and for that purpose I began with the north shore, for though we  were there more exposed to violent squalls which came down the valleys, I  thought it advisable to avoid the indraught of various channels  intersecting the Fuegian coast; but having made several boards without any  perceptible advantage, we tried the south shore, with such success that I  was induced to keep on that side during the remainder of the day.    \"And here let me remark, that in consequence of the westerly winds which  blow through the western parts of the Straits of Magalhaens, with almost  the constancy (as regards {69} direction, not force) of a trade-wind; a  current setting to the eastward, commonly at the rate of a knot and three  quarters an hour, will be found in mid-channel. The tides exert scarcely  any influence, except near either shore; and sometimes appear to set, up  one side of the Straits, and down the other: the weather tide is generally  shown by a rippling.(c)    \"Heavy squalls off Cape Froward repeatedly obliged us to clew all up. By  day their approach is announced, in time for the necessary precautions, by  their curling up and covering with foam the surface of the water, and  driving the spray in clouds before them.    \"At last we doubled Cape Froward. This Cape (called by the Spaniards El  Morro de Santa Agueda), the southernmost point of all America, is a bold  promontory, composed of dark coloured slaty rock; its outer face is nearly  perpendicular, and whether coming from the eastward or westward, it 'makes'  as a high round-topped bluff hill ('Morro').    \"Bougainville observes, that 'Cape Froward has always been much dreaded by  navigators.'[59] To double it, and gain an anchorage under Cape Holland,  certainly cost the Beagle as tough a sixteen hours' beat as I have ever  witnessed: we made thirty-one tacks, which, with the squalls, kept us  constantly on the alert, and scarcely allowed the crew to have the ropes  out of their hands throughout the day. But what there is to inspire a  navigator with 'dread' I cannot tell, for the coast on both sides is  perfectly clear, and a vessel may work from shore to shore.\"    From Cape Holland, the Beagle proceeded to Port Gallant, and during her  stay there, Mr. Bowen ascended the Mountain de la Cruz. Upon the summit he  found some remains of a glass bottle, and a roll of papers, which proved to  be the memorials stated to have been left by Don Antonio de Cordova, {70}  and a copy of a document that had previously been deposited there by M. de  Bougainville. With these papers was found a Spanish two-rial piece of  Carlos III., which had been bent to admit of its being put into the bottle.  It was with considerable difficulty that any of the writing could be  decyphered, for the papers, having been doubled up, were torn, and the  words defaced at the foldings, and edges.    Bougainville's memorial was in Latin. Cordova's, besides a document in  Latin, was accompanied by an account of his voyage, written in four  languages, Spanish, French, Italian, and English. The legible part of the  former was as follows:--      Viatori Benevolo salus ........    ........ que a periculose admodum naviga ......    ........

The  originals are placed in the British Museum; but before we finally left the  Strait, copies were made on vellum, and deposited on the same spot.    The Beagle left Port Gallant[60] with a fair wind, which carried her to  Swallow Harbour.    The next stopping place was Marian's Cove, a very snug anchorage on the  north shore, a few miles beyond Playa Parda. Proceeding thence to the  westward, with the wind 'in their teeth,' and such bad weather, that they  could only see the land of either coast at intervals, and failing in an  attempt to find anchorage under Cape Upright, the Beagle was kept under  weigh during a squally dark night.    In that very place, Commodore Byron, with the Dolphin and Tamar, passed the  anxious night, which he thus describes:--    \"Our situation was now very alarming; the storm increased every minute, the  weather was extremely thick, and the rain seemed to threaten another  deluge; we had a long dark night before us, we were in a narrow channel,  and surrounded on {72} every side by rocks and breakers.\"[61] The Beagle  was under similar circumstances, but the land being known to be high and  bold, her danger was not considered so imminent.    Eastward of Cape Upright the water was smooth; but between it and Cape  Providence a heavy breaking sea was caused by the deep swell of the  Pacific. Captain Stokes found an anchorage the next night in a bay under  Cape Tamar; and the following evening very nearly reached another under  Cape Phillip; but the darkness of a rainy night, and strong squalls,  prevented their attempting to anchor in an unknown place, and the only  resource was to bear up for shelter under Cape Tamar, where the previous  night had been passed. Even this was a dangerous attempt; they could hardly  discern any part of the high land, and when before the wind could not avoid  the ship's going much too fast. While running about eight knots, a violent  shock--a lift forward--heel over--and downward plunge--electrified every  one; but before they could look round, she was scudding along, as before,  having fairly leaped over the rock.    It was afterwards found that a great part of the gripe and false keel were  knocked away. Captain Stokes's account of this day's beat will give an idea  of the difficulties which the Beagle's crew encountered, in working out of  the Strait.    January 31st. \"The hands were turned up at daylight up anchor; but the  heavy squalls that came off the high land of the harbour, rendered it too  hazardous to weigh, until a temporary lull enabled us to make sail, and  re-commence beating to the westward against a dead foul wind, much rain,  hard squalls, and a turbulent cross sea.    \"The squalls became more frequent and more violent after noon; but they  gave, in daylight, sufficient warning, being preceded by dark clouds  gradually expanding upwards, until their upper line attained the altitude  of about fifty degrees: then came heavy rain, and perhaps hail; immediately  after followed the squall in all its fury, and generally lasted fifteen or  twenty minutes.    {73}    \"In working to windward we frequently extended our 'boards' to the south  shore (not without risk considering the state of the weather), with the  hope of making out Tuesday Bay, or some"]]]
