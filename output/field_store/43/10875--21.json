Gimignano left  Rome, and with them Parmigianino, who was at this time in the capital,  and passionately employed in studying the works of Raffaello. This  illustrious school was thus separated and dispersed over Italy, and  hence it happened that the new style was quickly propagated, and gave  birth to the florid schools, which form the subjects of our other books.  Although some of the scholars of Raffaello might return to Rome, yet the  brilliant epoch was past. The decline became apparent soon after the  sacking of the city, and from the time of that event, the art daily  degenerated in the capital, and ultimately terminated in mannerism. But  of this in its proper place. At present, after this general notice of  the school of Raffaello, we shall treat of each particular scholar and  of his assistants.    Giulio Pippi, or Giulio Romano, the most distinguished pupil of  Raffaello, resembled his master more in energy than in delicacy of  style, and was particularly successful in subjects of war and battles,  which he represented with equal spirit and correctness. In his noble  style of design he emulates Michelangiolo, commands the whole mechanism  of the human body, and with a masterly hand renders it subservient to  all his wishes. His only fault is, that his demonstrations of motion are  sometimes too violent. Vasari preferred his drawings to his pictures, as  he thought that the fire of his original conception was apt to  evaporate, in some degree, in the finishing. Some have objected to the  squareness of his physiognomies, and have complained of his middle tints  being too dark. But Niccolo Poussin admired this asperity of colour in  his battle of Constantine, as suitable to the character of the subject.  In the picture of the church dell'Anima, which is a Madonna, accompanied  by Saints, and in others of that description, it does not produce so  good an effect. His cabinet pictures are rare, and sometimes too free in  their subjects. He generally painted in fresco, and his vast works at  Mantua place him at the head of that school, which indeed venerates him  as its founder.    Gianfrancesco Penni of Florence, called Il Fattore, who when a boy was a  servant in the studio of Raffaello, became one of his principal  scholars, and assisted him more than any other in the cartoons of the  tapestries: he painted in the gallery of the Vatican the Histories of  Abraham and Isaac, noticed by Taja. Among other works left incomplete by  his master, and which he finished, is the Assumption of Monte Luci in  Perugia, the lower part of which, with the apostles, is painted by  Giulio, and the upper part, which abounds with Raffaellesque grace, is  ascribed to Il Fattore, although Vasari assigns it to Perino. Of the  works which he performed alone, his frescos in Rome have perished, and  so few of his oil pictures remain, that they are rarely to be found in  any collection. He is characterised by fertility of conception, grace of  execution, and a singular talent for landscape. He was joint heir of  Raffaello with Giulio, and wished to unite himself with him in his  profession; but being coldly received by Giulio in Mantua, he proceeded  to Naples, where he, as we shall see, contributed greatly to the  improvement of art, although cut off by an early death. Orlandi notices  two Penni in the school of Raffaello, comprehending Luca, a brother of  Gianfrancesco, a circumstance not improbable, and not, as far as I know,  contradicted by history. We are also told by Vasari, that Luca united  himself to Perino del Vaga, and worked with him at Lucca, and in other  places of Italy; that he followed Rosso into France, as we have before  observed; and that he ultimately passed into England, where he painted  for the king and private persons, and made designs for prints.    Perino del Vaga, whose true name was Pierino Buonaccorsi, was a relation  and fellow citizen of Penni. He had a share in the works of the Vatican,  where he at one time worked stuccos and arabesques with Giovanni da  Udine, at another time painted chiaroscuri with Polidoro, or finished  subjects from the sketches and after the style of Raffaello. Vasari  considered him the best designer of the Florentine School, after  Michelangiolo, and at the head of all those who assisted Raffaello. It  is certain, at least, that no one could, like him, compete with Giulio,  in that universality of talent so conspicuous in Raffaello; and the  subjects from the New Testament, which he painted in the papal gallery,  were praised by Taja above all others. In his style there is a great  mixture of the Florentine, as may be seen at Rome, in the Birth of Eve,  in the church of S. Marcello, where there are some children painted to  the life, a most finished performance. A convent at Tivoli possesses a  S. John in the desart, by him, with a landscape in the best style. There  are many works by him in Lucca, and Pisa, but more particularly in  Genoa, where we shall have occasion again to consider him as the origin  of a celebrated school.    Giovanni da Udine, by a writer of Udine called Giovanni di Francesco  Ricamatore, (Boni, p. 25,) likewise assisted Sanzio in arabesques and  stuccos, and painted ornaments in the gallery of the Vatican, in the  apartments of the pope, and in many other places. Indeed, in the art of  working in stucco, he is ranked as the first among the moderns,[53]  having, after long experience, imitated the style of the baths of Titus,  discovered at that time in Rome, and opened afresh in our own days.[54]  His foliage and shells, his aviaries and birds, painted in the above  mentioned places, and in other parts of Rome and Italy, deceive the eye  by their exquisite imitation; and in the animals more particularly, and  the indigenous and foreign birds, he seems to have reached the highest  point of excellence. He was also remarkable for counterfeiting with his  pencil every species of furniture; and a story is told, that having left  some imitations of carpets one day in the gallery of Raffaello, a groom  in the service of the Pope coming in haste in search of a carpet to  place in a room, ran to snatch up one of those of Giovanni, deceived by  the similitude. After the sacking of Rome he visited other parts of  Italy, leaving wherever he went, works in the most perfect and brilliant  style of ornament. This will occasion us to notice him in other schools.  At an advanced age he returned to Rome, where he was provided with a  pension from the Pope, till the time of his death.[55]    Polidoro da Caravaggio, from a manual labourer in the works of the  Vatican, became an artist of the first celebrity, and distinguished  himself in the imitation of antique bassirelievi, painting both sacred  and profane subjects in a most beautiful chiaroscuro. Nothing of this  kind was ever seen more perfect, whether we consider the composition,  the mechanism, or the design; and Raffaello and he, of all artists, are  considered in this respect to have approached nearest to the style of  the ancients. Rome was filled with the richest friezes, facades, and  ornaments over doors, painted by him and Maturino of Florence, an  excellent designer, and his partner; but these, to the great loss of  art, have nearly all perished. The fable of Niobe, in the Maschera  d'Oro, which was one of their most celebrated works, has suffered less  than any other from the ravages of time and the hand of barbarism. This  loss has been in some measure mitigated by the prints of Cherubino  Alberti, and Santi Bartoli, who engraved many of these works before they  perished. Polidoro lost his comrade by death in Rome, as was supposed,  by the plague, and he himself repaired to Naples, and from thence to  Sicily, where he fell a victim to the cupidity of his own servant, who  assassinated him. With him invention, grace, and freedom of hand,  seem to have died. This notice of him as an artist may suffice for the  present, as we shall again recur to him in the fourth book, as one of  the masters of the Neapolitan School.    Pellegrino da Modena, of the family of Munari, of all the scholars of  Raffaello, perhaps resembled him the most in the air of his heads, and a  peculiar grace of attitude. After having painted in an incomparable  manner the history of Jacob, before mentioned, and others of the same  patriarch, and some from the life of Solomon, in the gallery of the  Vatican, under Raffaello, he remained in Rome employed in the decoration  of many of the churches, until his master's death. He then returned to  his native place, where he became the head of a numerous succession of  Raffaellesque painters, as we shall in due time relate.    Bartolommeo Ramenghi, or as he is sometimes named, Bagnacavallo, and by  Vasari Il Bologna, is also included in the catalogue of those who worked  in the gallery. There is not however any known work of his in Rome, and  we may say the same of Biagio Pupini, a Bolognese, with whom he  afterwards united himself to paint in Bologna. Vasari is not prodigal of  praise towards the first, and writes with the most direct censure  against the second. Of their merits we shall speak more fully in the  Bolognese School, to which Bagnacavallo was the first to communicate a  new and better style.    Besides these, Vasari mentions Vincenzio di S. Gimignano, in Tuscany, to  whom, as a highly successful imitator of Raffaello, he gives great  praise, referring to some facades in fresco by him, which have now  perished. After the sacking of Rome he returned home, but so changed and  dispirited, that he appeared quite another person, and we have no  account of any of his subsequent works. Schizzone, a comrade of  Vincenzio, a most promising artist, shared the same fate; and we find  also, in the Bolognese "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34607"],[0,"Woodcraft and Camping (#17)"],[1,"daily in camp, and if you ever get lost,  you will find it of value. Fish and game have a flat, flashy taste eaten  without salt, and are also unwholesome.    Do not carry any of the one hundred and one condiments, sauces,  garnishes, etc., laid down in the books. Salt, pepper, and lemons fill  the bill in that line. Lobster-sauce, shrimp-sauce, marjoram, celery,  parsley, thyme, anchovies, etc., may be left at the hotels.    It may be expected that a pocket volume on woodcraft should contain a  liberal chapter of instruction on hunting. It would be quite useless.  Hunters, like poets, are born, not made. The art cannot be taught on  paper. A few simple hints, however, may not be misplaced. To start  aright, have your clothes fitted for hunting. Select good cassimere of a  sort of dull, no-colored, neutral tint, like a decayed stump, and have  coat, pants, and cap made of it. For foot-gear, two pairs of heavy yarn  socks, with rubber shoes or buckskin moccasins. In hunting, \"silence is  gold.\" Go quietly, slowly, and silently. Remember that the bright-eyed,  sharp-eared woodfolk can see, hear and smell, with a keenness that  throws your dull faculties quite in the shade. As you go lumbering and  stick-breaking through the woods, you will never know how many of these  quietly leave your path to right and left, allowing you to pass, while  they glide away, unseen, unknown. It is easily seen that a sharp-sensed,  light-bodied denizen of the woods can detect the approach of a heavy,  bifurcated, booted animal, a long way ahead, and avoid him accordingly.    But there is an art, little known and practiced, that invariably  succeeds in outflanking most wild animals; an art, simple in conception  and execution, but requiring patience; a species, so to speak, of high  art in forestry--the art of \"sitting on a log.\" I could enlarge on this.  I might say that the only writer of any note who has mentioned this  phase of woodcraft is Mr. Charles D. Warner; and he only speaks of it in  painting the character of that lazy old guide, \"Old Phelps.\"    Sitting on a log includes a deal of patience, with oftentimes cold feet  and chattering teeth; but, attended to faithfully and patiently, is  quite as successful as chasing a deer all day on tracking snow, while it  can be practiced when the leaves are dry, and no other mode of  still-hunting offers the ghost of a chance. When a man is moving through  the woods, wary, watchful animals are pretty certain to catch sight of  him. But let him keep perfectly quiet and the conditions are reversed. I  have had my best luck, and killed my best deer, by practically waiting  hour after hour on runways. But the time when a hunter could get four or  five fair shots in a day by watching a runway has passed away forever.  Never any more will buffalo be seen in solid masses covering square  miles in one pack. The immense bands of elk and droves of deer are  things of the past, and \"The game must go.\"          Chapter VIII         A TEN DAYS' TRIP IN THE WILDERNESS--GOING IT ALONE      About the only inducements I can think of for making a ten days' journey  through a strong wilderness, solitary and alone, were a liking for  adventure, intense love of nature in her wildest dress, and a strange  fondness for being in deep forests by myself. The choice of route was  determined by the fact that two old friends and schoolmates had chosen  to cast their lots in Michigan, one near Saginaw Bay, the other among  the pines of the Muskegon. And both were a little homesick, and both  wrote frequent letters, in which, knowing my weak point, they exhausted  their adjectives and adverbs in describing the abundance of game and the  marvelous fishing. Now, the Muskegon friend--Davis--was pretty well out  of reach. But Pete Williams, only a few miles out of Saginaw, was easily  accessible. And so it happened, on a bright October morning, when there  came a frost that cut from Maine to Missouri, that a sudden fancy took  me to use my new Billinghurst on something larger than squirrels. It  took about one minute to decide, and an hour to pack such duffle as I  needed for a few weeks in the woods.    Remembering Pete's two brown-eyed \"kids,\" and knowing that they were  ague-stricken and homesick, I made place for a few apples and peaches,  with a ripe melon. For Pete and I had been chums in Rochester, and I had  bunked in his attic on Galusha Street, for two years. Also, his babies  thought as much of me as of their father. The trip to Saginaw was easy  and pleasant. A \"Redbird\" packet to Buffalo, the old propeller Globe to  Lower Saginaw, and a ride of half a day on a buckboard, brought me to  Pete Williams' clearing. Were they glad to see me? Well, I think so.  Pete and his wife cried like children, while the two little homesick  \"kids\" laid their silken heads on my knees and sobbed for very joy. When  I brought out the apples and peaches, assuring them that these came from  the little garden of their old home--liar that I was--their delight was  boundless. And the fact that their favorite tree was a \"sour bough,\"  while these were sweet, did not shake their faith in the least.    [Sidenote: _At Pete Williams'_]    I stayed ten days or more with the Williams family, and the fishing and  hunting were all that he had said--all that could be asked. The woods  swarmed with pigeons and squirrels; grouse, quail, ducks and wild  turkeys were too plentiful, while a good hunter could scarcely fail of  getting a standing shot at a deer in a morning's hunt. But, _cui bono_?  What use could be made of fish or game in such a place? They were all  half sick, and had little appetite. Mrs. Williams could not endure the  smell of fish; they had been cloyed on small game, and were surfeited on  venison.    My sporting ardor sank to zero. I had the decency not to slaughter game  for the love of killing, and leave it to rot, or hook large fish that  could not be used. I soon grew restless, and began to think often about  the lumber camp on the Muskegon. By surveyors' lines it was hardly more  than sixty miles from Pete Williams' clearing to the Joe Davis camp on  the Muskegon. \"But practically,\" said Pete, \"Joe and I are a thousand  miles apart. White men, as a rule, don't undertake to cross this  wilderness. The only one I know who has tried it is old Bill Hance; he  can tell you all about it.\"    Hance was the hunting and trapping genius of Saginaw Bay--a man who  dwelt in the woods summer and winter, and never trimmed his hair or wore  any other covering on his head. Not a misanthrope, or taciturn, but  friendly and talkative rather; liking best to live alone, but fond of  tramping across the woods to gossip with neighbors; a very tall man  withal, and so thin that, as he went rapidly winding and turning among  fallen logs, you looked to see him tangle up and tumble in a loose coil,  like a wet rope, but he was better than he looked. He had a high  reputation as trailer, guide, or trapper, and was mentioned as a \"bad  man in a racket.\" I had met him several times, and as he was decidedly a  character, had rather laid myself out to cultivate him. And now that I  began to have a strong notion of crossing the woods alone, I took  counsel of Bill Hance. Unlike Williams, he thought it perfectly  feasible, and rather a neat, gamy thing for a youngster to do. He had  crossed the woods several times with surveying parties, and once alone.  He knew an Indian trail which led to an old camp within ten miles of the  Muskegon, and thought the trail could be followed. It took him a little  less than three days to go through; \"but,\" he added, \"I nat'rally travel  a little faster in the woods than most men. If you can follow the trail,  you ought to get through in a little more'n three days--if you keep  moggin'.\"    One afternoon I carefully packed the knapsack and organized for a long  woods tramp. I took little stock in that trail, or the three days'  notion as to time. I made calculations on losing the trail the first  day, and being out a full week. The outfit consisted of rifle, hatchet,  compass, blanket-bag, knapsack and knife. For rations, one loaf of  bread, two quarts of meal, two pounds of pork, one pound of sugar, with  tea, salt, etc., and a supply of jerked venison. One tin dish, twelve  rounds of ammunition, and the bullet-molds, filled the list, and did not  make a heavy load.    Early on a crisp, bright October morning I kissed the little fellows  good-bye, and started out with Hance, who was to put me on the trail. I  left the children with sorrow and pity at heart. I am glad now that my  visit was a golden hiatus in the sick monotony of their young lives, and  that I was able to brighten a few days of their dreary existence. They  had begged for the privilege of sleeping with me on a shake-down from  the first; and when, as often happened, a pair of little feverish lips  would murmur timidly and pleadingly, \"I'm so dry; can I have er drink?\"  I am thankful that I did not put the pleader off with a sip of tepid  water, but always brought it from the spring, sparkling and cold. For, a  twelvemonth later, there were two little graves in a corner of the  stump-blackened garden, and two sore hearts in Pete Williams' cabin.    Hance found the trail easily, but the Indians had been gone a long time,  and it was filled with leaves, dim, and not easy to follow. It ended as  nearly all trails do; it branched off to right and left, grew dimmer and  slimmer, degenerated to a deer path, petered out to a squirrel track,  ran up a tree, and ended in a knot hole. I was not sorry. It left me  free to follow my nose, my inclination, and--the compass.    There are men who, on finding themselves alone in a pathless forest,  become appalled, almost panic stricken. The vastness of an unbroken  wilderness subdues them, and they quail before the relentless, untamed  forces of nature. These are the men who grow enthusiastic--at  home--about"]]]
