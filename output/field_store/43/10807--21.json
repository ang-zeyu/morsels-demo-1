Is it possible to access older editions of The World Factbook to do  comparative research and trend analysis?    Previous versions of the Factbook, beginning with the 2000 edition,  are available for downloading - but not browsing - on the CIA Web  site. Hardcopy editions for earlier years are available from  libraries.    Would it be possible to set up a partnership or collaboration  between the producers of The World Factbook and other organizations  or individuals?    The World Factbook does not partner with other organizations or  individuals, but we do welcome comments and suggestions that such  groups or persons choose to provide.        Geography      I can't find a geographic name for a particular country. Why not?    The World Factbook is not a gazetteer (a dictionary or index of  places, usually with descriptive or statistical information) and  cannot provide more than the names of the administrative divisions  (in the Government category) and major cities/towns (on the country  maps). Our expanded Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names,  however, includes many of the world's major geographic features as  well as historic (former) names of countries and cities mentioned in  The World Factbook.    Why are Taiwan and the European Union listed out of alphabetical  order at the end of the Factbook entries?    Taiwan is listed after the regular entries because even though the  mainland People's Republic of China claims Taiwan, elected Taiwanese  authorities de facto administer the island and reject mainland  sovereignty claims. With the establishment of diplomatic relations  with China on January 1, 1979, the US Government recognized the  People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China,  acknowledging the Chinese position that there is only one China and  that Taiwan is part of China.    The European Union (EU) is not a country, but it has taken on many  nation-like attributes and these are likely to be expanded in the  future. A more complete explanation on the inclusion of the EU into  the Factbook may be found in the Preliminary statement.    Since we have an ambassador who represents the US at the Vatican,  why is this entity not listed in the Factbook?    Vatican City is found under Holy See. The term \"Holy See\" refers to  the authority, jurisdiction, and sovereignty vested in the Pope and  his advisors to direct the worldwide Catholic Church. The Holy See  has a legal personality that allows it to enter into treaties as the  juridical equal of a state and to send and receive diplomatic  representatives. Vatican City, created in 1929 to administer  properties belonging to the Holy See in Rome, is recognized under  international law as a sovereign state, but it does not send or  receive diplomatic representatives. Consequently, Holy See is  included as a Factbook entry, with Vatican City cross-referenced in  the Geographic Names appendix.    Why is Palestine not listed in The World Factbook?    The areas that could potentially form a future Palestinian state --  the West Bank and Gaza Strip -- do appear in the Factbook. These  areas are presently Israeli-occupied with current status subject to  the Israeli-Palestinian 1995 Interim Agreement; their permanent  status is to be determined through further negotiation.    Why are the Golan Heights not shown as part of Israel or Northern  Cyprus with Turkey?    Territorial occupations/annexations not recognized by the United  States Government are not shown on US Government maps.    Why don't you include information on entities such as Tibet or  Kashmir?    The World Factbook provides information on the administrative  divisions of a country as recommended by the United States Board on  Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is a component of the US Government  that develops policies, principles, and procedures governing the  spelling, use, and application of geographic names--domestic,  foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all  departments and agencies of the US Government to have access to  uniform names of geographic features.    Also included in the Factbook are entries on parts of the world  whose status has not yet been resolved (e.g., West Bank, Spratly  Islands). Specific regions within a country or areas in dispute  among countries are not covered.    What do you mean when you say that a country is \"doubly landlocked\"?    A doubly landlocked country is one that is separated from an ocean  or an ocean-accessible sea by two intervening countries. Uzbekistan  and Liechtenstein are the only countries that fit this definition.    Why is the area of the United States described as \"slightly larger  than China\" in the Factbook , while other sources list China as  larger in area than the United States?    It all depends on whether one is looking at total area (land and  water) when making the comparison (which is the criterion used by  the Factbook) or just land area (which excludes inland water  features such as rivers or lakes).    Total area (combining land and water)    United States = 9,826,630 sq km  China = 9,596,960 sq km    Land only (without any water features)    United States = 9,161,923 sq km  China = 9,326,410 sq km    Why has The World Factbook dropped the four French departments of  Guadeloupe, Martinique, Reunion, and French Guiana?    The reason the four entities are no longer in The World Factbook is  because their status has changed. While they are overseas  departments of France, they are also now recognized as French  regions, having equal status to the 22 metropolitan regions that  make up European France. In other words, they are now recognized as  being part of France proper. Their status is somewhat analogous to  Alaska and Hawaii vis-a-vis the contiguous United States. Although  separated from the larger geographic entity, they are still  considered to be an integral part of it.      Spelling and Pronunciation    Why is the spelling of proper names such as rulers, presidents, and  prime ministers in The World Factbook different than their spelling  in my country?    The Factbook staff applies the names and spellings from the Chiefs  of State link on the CIA Web site. The World Factbook is prepared  using the standard American English computer keyboard and does not  use any special characters, symbols, or most diacritical markings in  its spellings. Surnames are always spelled with capital letters;  they may appear first in some cultures.    The spelling of geographic names, features, cities, administrative  divisions, etc. in the Factbook differs from those used in my  country. Why is this?    The United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) recommends and  approves names and spellings. The BGN is the component of the United  States Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures  governing the spelling, use, and application of geographic  names--domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions  enable all departments and agencies of the US Government to use  uniform names of geographic features. (A note is usually included  where changes may have occurred but have not yet been approved by  the BGN). The World Factbook is prepared using the standard American  English computer keyboard and does not use any special characters,  symbols, or most diacritical markings in its spellings.    Why doesn't The World Factbook include pronunciations of country or  leader names?    There are too many variations in pronunciation among  English-speaking countries, not to mention English renditions of  non-English names, for pronunciations to be included. American  English pronunciations are included for some countries like Qatar  and Kiribati.    Why is the name of the Labour party misspelled?    When American and British spellings of common English words differ,  The World Factbook always uses the American spelling, even when  these common words form part of a proper name in British English.      Policies and Procedures    What is The World Factbook's source for a specific subject field?    The Factbook staff uses many different sources to publish what we  judge are the most reliable and consistent data for any particular  category. Space considerations preclude a listing of these various  sources.    The names of some geographic features provided in the Factbook  differ from those used in other publications. For example, in Asia  the Factbook has Burma as the country name, but in other  publications Myanmar is used; also, the Factbook uses Sea of Japan  whereas other publications label it East Sea. What is your policy on  naming geographic features?    The Factbook staff follows the guidance of the United States Board  on Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is the component of the United  States Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures  governing the spelling, use, and application of geographic  names--domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions  enable all departments and agencies of the US Government to have  access to uniform names of geographic features. The position of the  BGN is that the names Burma and Sea of Japan be used in official US  Government maps and publications.    Why is most of the statistical information in the Factbook given in  metric units, rather than the units standard to US measure?    US Federal agencies are required by the Metric Conversion Act of  1975 (Public Law 94-168) and by Executive Order 12770 of July 1991  to use the International System of Units, commonly referred to as  the metric system or SI. In addition, the metric system is used by  over 95 percent of the world's population.    Why don't you include information on minimum and maximum temperature  extremes?    The Factbook staff judges that this information would only be useful  for some (generally smaller) countries. Larger countries can have  large temperature extremes that do not represent the landmass as a  whole.

No prose version will cause any just notion of the  spirit of Homer. Of the half dozen metrical translations published  recently, we think that of our countryman Munford the best. Henry W.  Herbert has given us parts of the Iliad in admirable style. No one,  however, has yet equalled old Chapman--certainly not Pope nor Cowper.  The most successful translation into a modern language is unquestionably  the German one by Voss. Mure and Grote have written the ablest  dissertations in English upon the Homeric controversy, but they are not  poets, and could not if they would translate the great bard.           *       *       *       *       *    R. P. GILLIES, a contemporary of the great authors of the last age, has  published in three volumes _Memoirs of a Literary Veteran_. More than  half a century spent in the society of the lions of literature, could  hardly fail to furnish a store of amusing anecdotes, and a sprinkling of  interesting information. Mr. Gillies has also this advantage over many  collectors of similar reminiscences, that he was not only an author  among authors, but that his social position in early life gave him  access to the best circles. Scott, Wordsworth, Campbell, the Ettrick  Shepherd, Rogers, Galt, Maginn, Haydon, and many more names of interest,  figure frequently in his pages. Upon the whole, however, his work is  tedious, and quite too much occupied with matters that can be  entertaining only to his most intimate associates. Gillies was one of  the early contributors to \"Blackwood,\" and figured as \"Kemperhausen\" in  the _Noctes Ambrosianae_. He was also the originator and first editor of  the Foreign Quarterly Review, and was one of the first to make German  literature familiar in England.           *       *       *       *       *    It appears that only the Harpers' edition of Lord HOLLAND'S  _Reminiscences_ is complete. The London copies are full of asterisks,  marking the places of cancelled passages. The cancellings, it was  suggested, were occasioned by the interposition of Lord John Russel. A  correspondent of _The Times_, however, (understood to be Mr. Panizzi of  the British Museum,) came out with a denial, saying \"his lordship never  saw a word of the _Reminiscences_ till after they were published, and  that no responsibility whatever could attach to him. I speak thus,\" he  adds, \"of my own knowledge, and beg to inclose my name as a voucher for  the truth of this statement.\" The _Athenaeum_ thinks that if Mr. Panizzi  had said \"printed\" instead of \"published,\" his voucher would have been  less rashly ventured, as \"Lord John _did_ see the work before it was  actually published, but not before it had been actually printed; and  here, if we be not misinformed, arises a somewhat amusing _contretemps_,  which is likely to render the cancels ineffectual. Lord John, in fact,  had not the opportunity of interfering until the work had been so far  published to the world that an 'uncancelled' copy, with all the passages  since sought to be suppressed, had been dispatched to America beyond  recall. The next American mail will, doubtless, supply us with the whole  of the suppressed passages.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The meeting of the _British Association_, at Ipswich, is to commence on  Wednesday, July the 2d, and extend over seven or eight days. The  secretaries have received the names of several hundred intending  visitors, among whom are Lucien Buonaparte, Sir R. Murchison, Sir H. de  la Beche, Sir W. Jardine, Sir Charles Lyell, Sir David Brewster;  Professors Daubeny, Silliman (of America), Owen, Ansted, and the  celebrated naturalist, M. Lorrillier, a relative of the late Baron  Cuvier.           *       *       *       *       *    Of the new book on _Man's Nature and Development_, by Miss Martineau and  Mr. Atkinson, the _Westminster Review_ for April says:    \"Strange and wonderful is the power of self-delusion! Here we have two  clever well-informed people, persuading themselves that they experience  extraordinary raptures mingled with the most exquisite philosophic calm,  from believing that unconscious matter is the cause of conscious  thought, that the truest human affection is nothing worthier than the  love of a spoonful of nitric acid for a copper half-penny, and that  annihilation is the most satisfactory end of human life. From such views  both the intellect and the heart of man will recoil with well-founded  disgust--his logical powers will perceive the absurdity of the argument,  and his taste and affections will lead him to exclaim with Wordsworth:--              ----'Great God! I'd rather be      A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn:        So might I standing on this pleasant lea      Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;        Have sight of Proteus, rising from the sea,      Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.'    \"The new lights promised by our authors turn out to be chiefly composed  of very old-fashioned rays of darkness, and, after a careful perusal,  many will come to the conclusion that the way to be a modern  philosopher, is to quote the ancients, praise Bacon, and talk 'bosh.'\"           *       *       *       *       *    New editions of the works of Fielding and Smollett, profusely  illustrated by Cruikshank and Kenny Meadows, will soon be published by  Stringer & Townsend. These great classics will never cease to be read  with the keenest relish by all the English race. The London publishers  of the present edition of Fielding observe in their advertisement:         \"It is altogether unnecessary to enlarge upon the genius of       Henry Fielding. There is no man in the brilliant history of       English literature, with the single exception of Shakspeare, to       whose genius has been paid the homage of a more general       attestation. Calumny and misrepresentation--the offspring of       envy and malice--these, in his day, he had to endure or to       deride, and these, with their authors, have long sunk into       oblivion. The greatest of his contemporaries knew and       acknowledged his transcendent merit, and since his death, there       has not been one man of genius whose opinion of Fielding is       recorded, that has not spoken of him with veneration and       delight. Dr. Johnson, spite of a personal enmity, could not but       concede his extraordinary powers. Lady Mary Wortley Montague       reluctantly confessed that 'cousin Fielding' was the greatest       original genius of the age; the fastidious Gray was charmed       with him; and the more fastidious Gibbon has left his opinion       on record, that the illustrious house of Hapsburg, from which       Fielding was descended--its name erased, its towers       crumbled,--will be forgotten, when the romance of _Tom Jones_       shall flourish in eternal youth. If Coleridge classed him, as       one of the true immortals, with Shakspeare, Goethe could not,       nor was willing to contest, that he was so; if Byron could       cheer his heart and refresh his mind with his pages, so can,       and so does, Wordsworth. In a word, the matchless drawing of       his characters, which are not likenesses from life, but copies       from Nature--the one being a shallow art, the other a       profoundly creative power--his exquisite wit, his abounding       humor, his natural and manly pathos--in these no writer of       narrative fiction has ever approached him.         \"While, therefore, nothing can be less likely than that the       fame of Fielding should ever be suffered to die, or that, as       long as literature exists it can ever diminish, nothing can be       more proper than to attempt to extend his popularity--a       consummation inevitably to be effected by producing his works       at a price accessible, and in a form attractive, to all       classes. The late Rowland Hill once observed, that it was not       fitting that the arch-enemy of mankind should have all the best       tunes to himself. In a like spirit it may be remarked, that it       ought not to be permitted to inferior writers to monopolize all       the appliances and means of popularity that art can bestow.       Accordingly, the proprietors have secured the hearty and       zealous co-operation of Kenny Meadows. It would be invidious,       and from the purpose, to institute a comparison between this       gentleman and his contemporaries; but it may be asserted that       no living artist has shown an equal versatility of genius,       which points him out as the man best fitted to trace the       many-colored life of Fielding. From the illustration, almost       page by page, of Shakspeare, where is the man but would have       shrunk? but that work of our artist has secured not merely an       English, not only a European reputation, but a world-wide       celebrity. The proprietors are assured, that from the hand of       Kenny Meadows such an edition of Fielding will proceed as we       have not yet seen, and shall not hereafter see.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Of Mr. JOHN BIGELOW'S work on _Jamaica_, (published a few weeks ago by  Putnam,) the London _Examiner_ of April 5th, remarks:         \"It contains the most searching analysis of the present state       of Jamaica, and, moreover, the most sagacious prognostications       of the future prospects of the island that have ever been       published.
