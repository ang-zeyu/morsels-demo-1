(This stains both spores and bacteria.)    3. Wash in water.    4. Decolourise in alcohol, 2 parts; acetic acid, 1 per cent., 1 part.  (This removes the stain from everything but the spores.)    5. Wash in water.    6. Mount the cover-slip in water and examine microscopically with the  1/6-inch objective. (Spores should be red, and the rest of the film  colourless or a very light pink.) If satisfactory, pass on to section 7;  if unsatisfactory, repeat steps 2 to 5.    7. Counterstain in weak methylene-blue. (Now spores red, bacilli blue.)    8. Wash in water.    9. Dry and mount.    The spores of different bacilli differ greatly in their resistance to  decolourising reagents; even the spores of the same species of organisms  vary according to their age. Young spores are more easily decolourised  than those more mature.    Sulphuric acid, 1 per cent. aqueous solution, and hydrochloric acid, 0.5  per cent. alcoholic (90 per cent.) solution, are useful decolourising  reagents.         ~3. Moeller's Method.~--         1. Prepare and fix films in the usual manner.         2. Immerse in absolute alcohol for two minutes, then in       chloroform for two minutes; wash in water. This dissolves       out any fat or crystals that might otherwise retain the       \"spore\" stain.         3. Immerse in chromic acid, 5 per cent. aqueous solution,       for one minute; wash in water.         4. Pour Ziehl's carbolic fuchsin on the film, warm as in       previous methods, and allow it to act for ten minutes.         5. Wash in water.         6. Decolourise in sulphuric acid, 5 per cent. aqueous       solution, for five seconds.         7. Wash in water.         8. Counterstain with Kuehne's carbolic methylene-blue for       one or two minutes.         9. Wash in water.         10. Dry and mount.         (Spores red, bacilli blue.)         ~4. Abbott's Method.~--         1. Prepare and fix films in the usual manner.         2. Pour Loeffler's alkaline methylene-blue on the film; warm       cautiously over the flame till steam rises and allow the hot       steam to act for one to five minutes.         3. Wash thoroughly in water.         4. Decolourise in nitric acid, 2 per cent. alcoholic       (alcohol 80 per cent.) solution.         5. Wash thoroughly in water.         6. Counterstain in eosin, 1 per cent. aqueous solution.         7. Wash.         8. Dry and mount.         (Spores blue, bacilli red.)      DIFFERENTIAL METHODS OF STAINING.    ~Gram's Method.~--This method depends upon the fact that the protoplasm of  some bacteria permits aniline gentian violet and Lugol's iodine  solution, when applied consecutively, to enter into a chemical  combination which results in the formation of a new blue-black pigment,  only very sparingly soluble in absolute alcohol. Such organisms are said  to \"stain by Gram,\" or to be \"Gram positive.\"    1. Prepare a cover-slip film and fix in the usual way.    2. Stain in aniline gentian violet three to five minutes. Filter as much  aniline water on to the cover-slip as it will hold; then add the  smallest quantity of alcoholic solution of gentian violet which suffices  to saturate the aniline water and form a \"bronze scum\" upon its  surface--if too much of the alcoholic gentian violet is added the  alcohol present redissolves this scum.         To prepare aniline water, pour 4 or 5 c.c. aniline oil into       a stoppered bottle and add distilled water, 100 c.c. Shake       vigourously and filter immediately before use. The excess of       oil sinks to the bottom of the bottle and may be used again.    3. Wash in water.    4. Treat with Lugol's iodine solution until the film is black or dark  brown.    To do this treat with iodine solution for a few seconds, wash in water,  and examine the film over a piece of white filter paper. Note the  colour. Repeat this process until the film ceases to darken with the  fresh application of iodine solution.    Lugol's solution is prepared by dissolving        Iodine                  1 gramme      Iodide of potassium     3 grammes      In distilled water    300 c.c.    5. Wash in water.    6. Wash with alcohol until no more colour is discharged and the alcohol  runs away clear and colourless.    The following mixture may be substituted for absolute alcohol as a  decolouriser        Acetone             10 c.c.      Absolute alcohol   100 c.c.    7. Wash in water.    8. Counterstain very lightly with aqueous solution of Neutral Red. Other  counterstains may be used such as dilute eosin, dilute fuchsin, or  vesuvin.         NOTE.--This section may be omitted when dealing with films       prepared from pure cultivations.    9. Wash in water.    10. Dry and mount.      ~Gram-Claudius Method.~--    1. Prepare a cover-slip film and fix in the usual way.    2. Stain in methyl violet, 1 per cent. aqueous solution for three to  five minutes.    3. Treat with two lots picric acid, saturated aqueous solution.    4. Wash in water and dry.    5. Decolourise with clove oil.    6. Wash off clove oil with xylol.    7. Mount in xylol balsam.      ~Gram-Weigert Method.~--    1-5. Proceed as for the corresponding sections of Gram's method (_quod  vide_).    6. Dry in the air.    7. Wash in aniline oil, 1 part, xylol, 2 parts, until no more colour is  discharged.    8. Wash in xylol.    9. Mount in xylol balsam.      ~Modified Gram-Weigert Method.~--(To demonstrate trichophyta in hair.)    1. Soak the hairs in ether for ten minutes to remove the fat.    2. Stain thirty minutes in a tar-like solution of aniline gentian violet  (prepared by adding 15 drops of the alcoholic solution of gentian violet  to 3 drops of aniline water).    3. Dry the hairs between pieces of blotting paper.    4. Treat with perfectly fresh iodine solution.    5. Again dry between blotting paper.    6. Treat with aniline oil to remove excess of stain. (If necessary, add  a drop or two of nitric acid to the oil.)    7. Again treat with aniline oil.    8. Treat with aniline oil and xylol, equal parts.    9. Clear with xylol.    10. Mount in xylol balsam.    To obtain the best differentiation the preparation should be repeatedly  examined microscopically (with a 1/6-inch objective) between steps 5 and  9, as the actual time involved varies with different specimens.    ~Ziehl-Neelsen's Method.~--(To demonstrate tubercle and other acid-fast  bacilli.)    1. Smear a thin, even film of the specimen on the cover-slip by means of  the platinum loop. (In the case of sputum, if it is a very watery  specimen, allow the film to dry, then spread a second and even a third  layer over the first.)    2. Fix by passing three times through the flame.    3. Stain in hot carbol-fuchsin (as in staining for spores) for five to  ten minutes. (This stains everything on the film.) Avoid over-heating.    4. Decolourise by dipping in sulphuric acid, 25 per cent. (This removes  stain from everything but acid-fast bacilli; e. g., tubercle, leprosy,  and smegma bacilli and the film turns yellow.)    5. Wash in water. (A pale red colour returns to the film).    6. Wash in alcohol till no more colour is discharged. (This often, but  not invariably, removes the stain from acid-fast bacilli other than  tubercle; e. g., smegma bacillus.)    7. Wash in water.    8. Counterstain in weak methylene-blue. (Stains non-acid-fast bacilli,  leucocytes, epithelial cells, etc.)    9. Wash in water, dry, and mount.    ~Pappenheim's Method.~--    This method is supposed to differentiate between B. tuberculosis and  other acid-fast micro-organisms.    1. Prepare and fix film in the usual way.    2. Stain in carbol-fuchsin _without heat_ for three minutes.    3. Without previously washing in water treat the film with three or four  successive applications of corallin (Rosolic acid) solution.        Corallin                             1 gramme      Methylene-blue      (saturated alcoholic solution)     100 c.c.      Glycerine                           20 c.c.    4. Wash in water.    5. Dry and mount.    ~Neisser's Method--Modified.~--(To demonstrate diphtheroid bacilli.)    _Stain I._--    Measure out and mix        Methylene-blue, saturated alcoholic solution     4.0 c.c.      Acetic acid, 5 per cent. aqueous solution       96.0 c.c.    Filter.    _Stain II._--    Weigh out        Neutral red                2.5 grammes    and dissolve in        Distilled water              1000 c.c.    Filter.    METHOD.--    1. Prepare and fix films in the usual way.    2. Pour stain I on the film and allow it to act for two minutes.    3. Wash thoroughly in water.    4. Treat with Lugol's iodine for ten seconds.    5. Wash thoroughly in water.    6. Pour stain II on to the film and allow it to act for thirty seconds.    7. Wash thoroughly in water.    8. Dry and mount.         NOTE.--The cultivation from which the films are prepared       must be upon blood-serum which has been incubated at 37 deg. C.       for from nine to eighteen hours.    The bacilli are stained a light red by the neutral red, which contrasts  well with the two or three black spots, situated at the poles and  occasionally one in the centre representing protoplasmic aggregations (?  metachromatic granules) stained by the acid methylene-blue.         ~Wheal and Chown (Oxford) Method.~--(To demonstrate       actinomyces.)         1. Stain briefly with Ehrlich's haematoxylin (until nuclei       are faint blue after washing with tap water).         2. Wash in tap water.         3. Stain in hot carbol-fuchsin (as for tubercle bacilli) for       five to ten minutes.         4. Wash in tap water.         5. Decolourise with Spengler's picric acid alcohol. This is       prepared by mixing:            Alcohol, absolute                          20 c.c.          Picric acid, saturated aqueous solution    10 c.c.          Distilled water                            10 c.c.         During the progress of steps 1-5 the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27748"],[0,"Popular Lectures on Zoonomia (#17)"],[1,"many other complaints, too numerous to mention here.    The greatest misfortune, and which indeed arises from a want of  physiological knowledge, is, that people labouring under these  disorders, imagine they may be cured by the reception of drugs into  the stomach, and thus they are induced to receive into that organ,  half the contents of an apothecary's shop. There is no doubt that  these complaints may oftentimes be alleviated, and the cure assisted,  by medicines: thus, when the stomach is overloaded, this may be  removed by an emetic; the same complaint of the bowels may be removed  by a cathartic; and when the stomach is debilitated, we are  acquainted with some substances which will give it vigour, such as  iron, the Peruvian bark, and several kinds of bitters. These however,  when used alone, afford but temporary relief; and unless the cause  which induced the disease be removed, it will afterwards return with  redoubled violence. When the stomach, for instance, is debilitated by  want of exercise, I would ask, is there an article in the whole  materia medica, that can cure the complaints of sedentary people,  unless proper exercise at the same time be taken? With exercise tonic  remedies will undoubtedly accelerate the cure, but without it, they  will only make bad worse.    Again, when the stomach is debilitated by the use of improper food,  or the abuse of fermented or spirituous liquors, I would say to any  one who pretended to cure me of these complaints, without my making a  total change in the manner of living, that he either was ignorant of  the matter, or intended to deceive me.    In many cases the change of food must be strictly observed and  persevered in for a long time before a cure can be effected. In some  instances where the powers of the stomach were too weak to prevent  the food from undergoing perhaps both a vinous and acetous  fermentation, and where, in consequence of the disengagement of gas  and the formation of acid, the most excruciating pains were felt, the  most dreadful sickness experienced, and all the symptoms of  indigestion present in the most aggravated state; after almost every  article in the materia medica, generally employed, had been tried  without success, I have cured the patient merely by prohibiting food  subject to fermentation, such as vegetables, and enjoining a strict  use of animal food alone.    In short, wherever the cause of a disease can be ascertained, the  grand and simple secret in the cure, is the careful removal of that  cause.    LECTURE V.  OF THE SENSES IN GENERAL.    In this lecture, I propose to take a view of the connexion of man  with the external world, and shall endeavour to point out the manner  in which he becomes acquainted with external objects, by means of the  faculties called senses.    A human creature is an animal endowed with understanding, and reason;  a being composed of an organized body, and a rational mind.    With respect to his body, he is pretty similar to other animals,  having similar organs, powers, and wants. All animals have a body  composed of several parts, and, though these may differ from the  structure of the human body in some circumstances, to accommodate it  to peculiar habits and wants of the animal, still there is a great  similarity in the general structure.    The human body is feeble at its commencement, increases gradually in  its progress by the help of nourishment and exercise, till it arrives  at a certain period, when it appears in full vigour; from this time  it insensibly declines to old age, which conducts it at length to  dissolution. This is the ordinary course of human life, unless it  happens to be abridged either by disease or accident.    With regard to his reasoning faculties, or mind, man is eminently  distinguished from other animals. It is by this noble part that he  thinks, and is capable of forming just ideas of the different objects  that surround him: of comparing them together; of inferring from  known principles unknown truths; of passing a solid judgment on the  mutual agreement of things, as well as on the relations they bear to  him; of deliberating on what is proper or improper to be done; and of  determining how to act. The mind recollects what is past, joins it  with the present, and extends its views to futurity. It is capable of  penetrating into the causes of events, and discovering the connexion  that exists between them.    Governed by invariable laws, which connect him with all the beings,  whether animate or inanimate, among which he exists, man has certain  relations of convenience, and inconvenience, arising from the  particular constitution of the surrounding objects, as well as of his  own body. These external objects possess qualities which may be  useful or prejudicial to him; and his interest requires, that he  should be capable of ascertaining and appreciating these properties.    It is by sensation, or feeling, that the knowledge of external  objects is obtained. The faculty of feeling, modified in every organ,  perceives those qualities for which the peculiar structure of the  organ is fitted; and all the various sensations of sound, colour,  taste, smell, resistance, and temperature, find appropriate organs by  which they are perceived, without mixing with, or confounding each  other. External objects, therefore, act upon the parts of the body  endowed with feeling, and their action is diversified in such a  manner, as to give us a great number of sensations, which appear to  have no resemblance to each other, and which make us acquainted with  the various properties of surrounding objects.    It would not, however, have been sufficient for man, merely to have  possessed this power of perceiving the different properties of the  objects which surround him: it was necessary likewise, that he should  be possessed of motion, that he might be able to approach or avoid  them, to seize or repulse them, as it suited his convenience or  advantage. By the extreme mobility of his limbs, he is able to move  his body, and transport it from place to place; to bring external  objects nearer to him, to remove them to a greater distance, and to  place them in such situations and such circumstances, as may enable  them to act on each other, and produce the changes which he wishes.    The human body, therefore, may be regarded as a machine composed  (besides the moving parts which have formerly been noticed) of divers  organs upon which external objects act, and produce those impressions  which convince us of their presence, and make us acquainted with  their properties. These impressions are transmitted to the sentient  principle, or mind; and the faculty we possess of perceiving these  impressions has been called by physiologists, sensibility.    Sensation has generally been defined by metaphysicians to be a change  in the mind, of which we are conscious, caused by a correspondent  change in the state of the body. This definition, however, leaves the  matter where they found it, and throws no light whatever on the  nature of sensation; nor can we say any thing more concerning it,  than that, when the organs are in a sound state, certain sensations  are perceived, which force us to believe in the existence of external  objects, though there is no similarity whatever, nor any necessary  connexion, that we can perceive, between the sensation and the object  which caused it.    All the different degrees of sensation may be reduced to two kinds:  pleasant and painful. The nature of these two primitive modes of  sensation, is as little known to us as their different species: all  that can be said, is, that the general laws by which the body is  governed, are such, that pleasure is generally connected with those  impressions which tend to its preservation, and pain with those which  cause its destruction.    In a general point of view, sensibility may be regarded as an  essential property of every part of the living body, disposing each  part to perform those functions, the object of which is to preserve  the life of the animal. Sensibility presides over the most necessary  functions, and watches carefully over the health of the body: she  directs the choice of the air proper for respiration, and also of  alimentary substances; the mechanism of the secretions is likewise  placed under her power; and in the same way that the eye perceives  colours, and the ear sounds, so every animated and living part is  fitted to receive impressions from the objects appropriated to it.    That every part of the animal is endowed with sensibility, is evident  from a variety of facts, particularly from the action which follows  when a muscle taken out of the animal body is irritated by any  stimulus: this is evident, by a variety of facts mentioned by Whytt,  Boerhaave, and others, which show, that parts recently taken from the  animal body retain a portion of sensibility, which continues to  animate them, and render them capable of action for a considerable  time.    The primary organ of sensation appears to be the brain, its  continuation in the form of medulla oblongata and spinal marrow, and  the various nerves proceeding from these; and it seems now generally  agreed, that unless there be a free communication of nerves between  the part where the impression is made, and the brain, no sensation  will take place; for instance, if the nerves be cut or compressed.    In a sound body, sensation is caused, whenever a change takes place  in the state of the nervous power, whether that change be produced by  an external, or an internal cause. The former kind of sensation is  said to arise from impression or impulse, the latter from  consciousness.    Every impression or impulse is not, however, equally calculated to  produce sensation; for this purpose, a middle degree of impulse  appears the best. An impulse considerably less produces no sensation,  and one more violent may cause pain, but"]]]
