In these different phases the humerus is  flexed. But at the moment that the limb, when carried forwards, is about  to resume its contact with the ground it becomes directed obliquely  downwards and forwards; then the humerus is in the position of  extension.    During these movements of the humerus, there exists an essential  factor--that is, the scapular balance. (It is the same as what occurs in  man when he balances his arm in the antero-posterior plane.) When the  humerus is flexed, the scapula moves in such a way that the superior  portion projects forwards; when it is extended, the scapula, on the  other hand, is inclined more backwards. But it is necessary to add that,  during these displacements, the scapulo-humeral angle varies; it tends  to close during the flexion of the humerus, and becomes more open during  extension.    The movements and the relations of the humerus and the scapula are  clearly represented in Figs. 41 and 42, reproduced from the  chromophotographic studies of Professor Marey--studies relative to the  analyses of the movements of the horse.[13] They show clearly the  movements of flexion and extension of the humerus, also the balancing of  the scapula which accompanies the movements.      [13] E. J. Marey, 'Analyses of the Movements of the Horse by the         Chromophotograph' (_La Nature_, June 11, 1898).    [Illustration: FIG. 41.--FLEXION OF THE HUMERUS: RIGHT ANTERIOR LIMB OF  THE HORSE, EXTERNAL SURFACE (AFTER A CHROMOPHOTOGRAPHIC STUDY BY  PROFESSOR MAREY).]    [Illustration: FIG. 42.--EXTENSION OF THE HUMERUS: RIGHT ANTERIOR LIMB  OF THE HORSE, EXTERNAL SURFACE (AFTER A CHROMOPHOTOGRAPHIC STUDY BY  PROFESSOR MAREY).]    =The Articulation of the Elbow, or the Humero-ulnar Articulation.=--In  this articulation, which is constructed in the form of a true hinge, the  movements of flexion and extension alone are possible. In flexion, the  forearm, directed forwards, is folded on the arm, with which, in certain  circumstances, it comes in contact. For example, in a horse of mettle  which leaps over an elevated obstacle, the animal forcibly raises his  fore-limbs by flexing them. Flexion is produced to the same extent, and  even more so, and for a longer period, in felides which crouch.    In extension, on the contrary, the forearm is carried backward. This  movement being limited only by the contact of the tip of the olecranon  with the bottom of the olecranon fossa of the humerus, the forearm is  enabled, in this case, to move until it is in line with the arm. For  example, during walking, when one of the anterior limbs, having reached  the end of its resting stage, is considerably inclined downwards and  backwards.    The apex of the olecranon process--that is to say, the point of the  elbow--forms a marked prominence, more salient in flexion than in  extension, as in the corresponding region of the human elbow.    =The Radio-ulnar Articulation.=--It is in the dog and the cat, in which  the two bones of the forearm articulate by their extremities only, and  remain separate in the rest of their extent, that the articulations call  for special notice.    In the upper part, the radius rotates on itself; while below, it rotates  around the ulna. It follows that the forearm, which in all quadrupeds is  in a state of permanent pronation, can, in carnivora, take the position  of supination, or rather, of demi-supination. In fact, whatever be the  mobility of the two bones of the forearm, the movement is not able to  bring the palmar surface to the front, but only to direct it towards the  median line.    =The Articulation of the Wrist.=--Here are found, as in man, three  superimposed articulations: the radio-carpal, intercarpal, and  carpo-metacarpal.    If we remember the movements which take place at the plane of these  articulations in man, and take account of the fact that the mobility of  the limbs is reduced just in proportion as they are simplified in  structure so as to become organs of support only, we can easily  comprehend that, in the horse and the ox, and, in a word, animals that  have a canon bone, the movements of the wrist are little varied in  character, while in carnivorae, on the other hand, they are relatively  more so.    We will remember that in the ox and the horse the region of the wrist is  called the _knee_.    In flexion, the hand is bent backwards; in extension it is carried  forwards. These two movements take place especially in the radiocarpal  and intercarpal articulations. In the first of these articulations, it  is the superior row of the carpus which glides backwards and forwards on  the corresponding articular surface of the forearm. In the second  articulation, it is the second row which moves; gliding on the inferior  articular surfaces of the row above it. This inferior row carries the  metacarpus with it; for the carpo-metacarpal articulation is much less  mobile than either of the other two.    In flexion, the articular surfaces are separated from one another in  front; and the changes of form which result from this are noticeable on  the anterior surface of the 'knee.' Moreover, at that moment this region  contrasts markedly in its outlines with the parts above it and below  it--that is to say, with the corresponding surfaces of the forearm and  of the canon bone.    As for the lateral movements, by which the hand is inclined outwards and  inwards in its movements at the wrist, they exist to an appreciable  extent in the cat and the dog only; in order to understand this, it is  enough to compare the shape of the articular surfaces of this region in  carnivora and the horse, for example. In the latter, those surfaces are  almost plane; in the cat, on the contrary, they are curved (inferior  surface of the forearm, concave; superior border of the carpus, convex).  These latter, then, are, in form, similar to those which exist at the  same level in the human being; this explains the possibility of  analogous movements of the whole hand--that is to say, of the movements  of abduction and adduction.    =The Metacarpo-phalangeal Articulations.=--With regard to the mobility,  it is in these articulations, as in those of the wrist--that is to say,  although in all quadrupeds the first phalanges can be flexed and  extended on the metacarpus, it is only in the cat and dog that lateral  movement is possible. Indeed, in the horse, in which the principal  metacarpal terminates inferiorly in two convex surfaces, which are  separated by a crest; and where the whole articulates with a cavity on  the superior extremity of the first phalanx; because of the hinging of  these surfaces, there can only be movements of opening and closing of  this articulation. The first phalanx is directed backwards during  flexion and forwards during extension. In the dog and the cat the digits  can be separated from each other, and also drawn together--that is to  say, abducted and adducted; but, as in man, these movements can be made  only when the first phalanges are in the state of extension. During  flexion they are impossible, because of the tension of the lateral  ligaments, which increases as the flexion is more pronounced. This can  be demonstrated, for example, in the cat, which, in order to separate  the digits, opens the hand widely--that is to say, forcibly raises the  first phalanges.    =The Interphalangeal Articulations.=--The phalanges are in contact with  one another by surfaces, which, on one side, are of trochlear form, and,  on the other, are moulded on these trochleae; accordingly, at the level  of these articulations, the movements of flexion and extension only can  take place.    In the felidae, the claws which the third phalanges bear cannot be  utilized when the latter are in a state of extension, at which time,  being forcibly raised, they are, in fact, placed on the outer sides of  the phalanges, which are grooved to receive them. But when the animal  wishes to use them, it flexes those third phalanges, of which the  terminal extremity is then projected forward, and the claws are ready to  fulfil their function. But at the same time it extends the first  phalanges, to produce a certain tension of the flexors of the digits,  and thus enable the latter to act with greater efficacy, with a minimum  of contraction. We can demonstrate this action experimentally on  ourselves. It is enough to carry the first phalanges forcibly into a  state of extension; the third phalanges then become flexed, quite  spontaneously, by the tension of the tendons of the flexors which are  inserted into them.    At the same time, if we examine the felidae which we have taken as  examples, when the first phalanges are in the state of extension, the  digits will be found to be separable, as we have already indicated in  connection with the metacarpo-phalangeal articulations, with the result  that the claws are then able to lacerate a wider surface.    The extension of the ungual phalanx, which determines the retraction of  the claw and stops its action, is the mechanical result of an elastic,  fibrous apparatus which is attached to each of the third phalanges, and  has its origin of the second.      THE POSTERIOR LIMBS[14]      [14] Examine Figs. 21, 33, 34, 38, 39, 49.    The posterior limbs are divided, as are the inferior limbs of the human  being, of which they are the homologues, into four parts: pelvis, thigh,  leg, and foot.      The Pelvis    The pelvis, which incompletely limits the abdominal cavity, inferiorly  in the vertical position of the body and posteriorly in the normal  attitude of quadrupeds, is formed by the iliac bones and sacrum--the  coccyx forming a prolongation of the latter. We have already described  the two latter (pp. 10 and 11) in connection with the vertebral column,  of which they form the inferior or posterior portion or segment,  according to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3833"],[0,"Australian Legendary Tales: folk-lore of the Noongahburrahs as told to the (#17)"],[1,"exit at some distance, out of which he could  come up quite near his home, for it was the way he often took after  hunting.    The Mullyans went home and waited, but no sign of Deegeenboyah. Then  back on their tracks they went and called aloud, but got no answer, and  saw no sign. At last Mullyangah the chief of the Mullyans, said he  would find him. Arming himself with his boondees and spears, he went  back to where he had last seen Deegeenboyah sitting. He saw where his  tracks turned off and where they disappeared, but could not account for  their disappearance, as he did not notice the neat little trap-door of  the Murgah Muggui. But he hunted round, determined to scour the bush  until he found him. At last he saw a camp. He went up to it and saw  only two little girls playing about, whom he knew were the daughters of  Deegeenboyah.    \"Where is your father?\" he asked them.    \"Out hunting,\" they said.    \"Which way does he come home?\"    \"Our father comes home out of this;\" and they showed him the spiders'  trap-door.    \"Where are your mothers?\"    \"Our mothers are out getting honey and yams.\" And off ran the little  girls to a leaning tree on which they played, running up its bent  trunk.    Mullyangah went and stood where the trunk was highest from the ground  and said: \"Now, little girls, run up to here and jump, and I will catch  you. Jump one at a time.\"    Off jumped one of the girls towards his outstretched arms, which, as  she came towards him he dropped, and, stepping aside, let her come with  her full force to the ground where she lay dead. Then he called to the  horror-stricken child on the tree: \"Come, jump. Your sister came too  quickly. Wait till I call, then jump.\"    \"No, I am afraid.\"    \"Come on, I will be ready this time. Now come.\"    \"I am afraid.\"    \"Come on; I am strong.\" And he smiled quite kindly up at the child,  who, hesitating no longer, jumped towards his arms, only to meet her  sister's fate.    \"Now,\" said Mullyangah, \"here come the two wives. I must silence them,  or when they see their children their cries will warn their husband if  he is within earshot.\" So he sneaked behind a tree, and as the two  wives passed he struck them dead with his spears. Then he went to the  trapdoor that the children had shown him, and sat down to wait for the  coming of Deegeenboyah. He had not long to wait. The trap-door was  pushed up and out came a cooked emu, which he caught hold of and laid  on one side. Deegeenboyah thought it was the girls taking it, as they  had often watched for his coming and done before, so he pushed up  another, which Mullyangah took, then a third, and lastly came up  himself, to find Mullyangah confronting him spear and boondee in hand.  He started back, but the trap-door was shut behind him, and Mullyangah  barred his escape in front.    \"Ah,\" said Mullyangah, \"you stole our food and now you shall die. I've  killed your children.\"    Decgeenboyah looked wildly round, and, seeing the dead bodies of his  girls beneath the leaning tree, he groaned aloud.    \"And,\" went on Mullyangah, \"I've killed your wives.\"    Deegenboyah raised his head and looked again wildly round, and there,  on their homeward path, he saw his dead wives. Then he called aloud,  \"Here Mullyangah are your emus; take them and spare me. I shall steal  no more, for I myself want little, but my children and my wives  hungered. I but stole for them. Spare me, I pray you. I am old; I shall  not live long. Spare me.\"    \"Not so,\" said Mullyangah, \"no man lives to steal twice from a Mullyan;\"  and, so saying, he speared Deegeenboyah where he stood. Then he lifted up  the emus, and, carrying them with him, went swiftly back to his camp.    And merry was the supper that night when the Mullyans ate the emus, and  Mullyangah told the story of his search and slaughter. And proud were  the Mullyans of the prowess and cunning of their chief.          29.  MAYRAH, THE WIND THAT BLOWS THE WINTER AWAY      At the beginning of winter, the iguanas hide themselves in their homes  in the sand; the black eagle hawks go into their nests; the garbarlee  or shingle-backs hide themselves in little logs, just big enough to  hold them; the iguanas dig a long way into the sand and cover up the  passage behind them, as they go along. They all stay in their winter  homes until Mayrah blows the winter away. Mayrah first blows up a  thunderstorm. When the iguanas hear the thunder, they know the spring  is not far off, so they begin making a passage to go out again, but  they do not leave their winter home until the Curreequinquin, or  butcher birds sing all day almost without ceasing \"Goore, goore, goore,  goore.\" Then they know that Mayrah has really blown the winter away,  for the birds are beginning to pair and build their nests. So they open  their eyes and come out on the green earth again. And when the black  fellows hear the curreequinquins singing \"Goore, goore,\" they know that  they can go out and find iguanas again, and find them fatter than when  they went away with the coming of winter. Then, too, will they find  piggiebillahs hurrying along to get away from their young ones, which  they have buried in the sand and left to shift for themselves, for no  longer can they carry them, as the spines of the young ones begin to  prick them in their pouch. So they leave them and hurry away, that they  may not hear their cry. They know they shall meet them again later on,  when they are grown big. Then as Mayrah softly blows, the flowers one  by one open, and the bees come out again to gather honey. Every bird  wears his gayest plumage and sings his sweetest song to attract a mate,  and in pairs they go to build their nests. And still Mayrah softly  blows until the land is one of plenty; then Yhi the sun chases her back  whence she came, and the flowers droop and the birds sing only in the  early morning. For Yhi rules in the land until the storms are over and  have cooled him, and winter takes his place to be blown away again by  Mayrah the loved of all, and the bringer of plenty.          30.  WAYARNBEH THE TURTLE      Oolah, the lizard, was out getting yams on a Mirrieh flat. She had  three of her children with her. Suddenly she thought she heard some one  moving behind the big Mirrieh bushes. She listened. All of a sudden out  jumped Wayambeh from behind a bush and seized Oolah, telling her not to  make a noise and he would not hurt her, but that he meant to take her  off to his camp to be his wife. He would take her three children too  and look after them. Resistance was useless, for Oolah had only her yam  stick, while Wayambeh had his spears and boondees. Wayambeh took the  woman and her children to his camp. His tribe when they saw him bring  home a woman of the Oolah tribe, asked him if her tribe had given her  to him. He said, \"No, I have stolen her.\"    \"Well,\" they said, \"her tribe will soon be after her; you must protect  yourself; we shall not fight for you. You had no right to steal her  without telling us. We had a young woman of our own tribe for you, yet  you go and steal an Oolah and bring her to the camp of the Wayambeh. On  your own head be the consequences.\"    In a short time the Oolahs were seen coming across the plain which  faced the camp of the Wayambeh. And they came not in friendship or to  parley, for no women were with them, and they carried no boughs of  peace in their bands, but were painted as for war, and were armed with  fighting weapons.    When the Wayambeh saw the approach of the Oolah, their chief said:  \"Now, Wayambeh, you had better go out on to the plain and do your own  fighting; we shall not help you.\"    Wayambeh chose the two biggest boreens that he had; one he slung on  him, covering the front of his body, and one the back; then, seizing  his weapons, he strode out to meet his enemies.    When he was well out on to the plain, though still some distance from  the Oolah, he called out, \"Come on.\"    The answer was a shower of spears and boomerangs. As they came whizzing  through the air Wayambeh drew his arms inside the boreens, and ducked  his head down between them, so escaped.    As the weapons fell harmless to the ground, glancing off his boreen,  out again he stretched his arms and held up again his head, shouting,  \"Come on, try again, I'm ready.\"    The answer was another shower of weapons, which he met in the same way.  At last the Oolahs closed in round him, forcing him to retreat towards  the creek.    Shower after shower of weapons they slung at him, and were getting at  such close quarters that his only chance was to dive into the creek. He  turned towards the creek, tore the front boreen off him, flung down his  weapons and plunged in.    The Oolah waited, spears poised in hand, ready to aim directly his head  appeared above water, but they waited in vain. Wayambeh, the black  fellow, they never saw again, but in the waterhole wherein he had dived  they saw a strange creature, which bore on its back a fixed structure  like a boreen, and which, when they went to try and catch it, drew in  its head and limbs, so they said, \"It is Wayambeh.\" And this was the  beginning of Wayambeh, or turtle, in the creeks.          31.  WIRREENUN THE RAINMAKER      The country was stricken with a drought. The rivers were all dry except  the deepest holes in them. The grass was dead, and even the trees were  dying. The bark dardurr of the blacks were all fallen to the ground and  lay there rotting, so long was it since they had been used, for only in  wet weather did the blacks use the bark dardurr; at other times they  used only whatdooral, or bough shades.    The young men of the Noongahburrah murmured among themselves, at first  secretly, at last openly, saying: \"Did not our fathers always say that  the Wirreenun could make, as we wanted it, the rain to fall? Yet look  at our country--the grass blown away, no doonburr seed to grind, the  kangaroo are dying, and the emu, the"]]]
