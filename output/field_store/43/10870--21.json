With such a school and such a master and such examples, what will become  of my embryo tastes, as yet so imperceptible? In that environment, they  seem bound to perish, stifled for ever. Yet no, the germ has life;  it works in my veins, never to leave them again. It finds nourishment  everywhere, down to the cover of my penny alphabet, embellished with  a crude picture of a pigeon which I study and contemplate much more  zealously than the A B C. Its round eye, with its circlet of dots, seems  to smile upon me. Its wing, of which I count the feathers one by one,  tells me of flights on high, among the beautiful clouds; it carries me  to the beeches raising their smooth trunks above a mossy carpet studded  with white mushrooms that look like eggs dropped by some vagrant hen; it  takes me to the snow-clad peaks where the birds leave the starry print  of their red feet. He is a fine fellow, my pigeon friend: he consoles  me for the woes hidden behind the cover of my book. Thanks to him, I sit  quietly on my bench and wait more or less till school is over.    School out of doors has other charms. When the master takes us to kill  the snails in the box borders, I do not always scrupulously fulfil my  office as an exterminator. My heel sometimes hesitates before coming  down upon the handful which I have gathered. They are so pretty! Just  think, there are yellow ones and pink, white ones and brown, all with  dark spiral streaks. I fill my pockets with the handsomest, so as to  feast my eyes on them at my leisure.    On hay making days in the master's field, I strike up an acquaintance  with the frog. Flayed and stuck at the end of a split stick, he serves  as bait to tempt the crayfish to come out of his retreat by the brook  side. On the alder trees I catch the Hoplia, the splendid scarab who  pales the azure of the heavens. I pick the narcissus and learn to  gather, with the tip of my tongue, the tiny drop of honey that lies  right at the bottom of the cleft corolla. I also learn that too long  indulgence in this feast brings a headache; but this discomfort in no  way impairs my admiration for the glorious white flower, which wears a  narrow red collar at the throat of its funnel.    When we go to beat the walnut trees, the barren grass plots provide me  with locusts spreading their wings, some into a blue fan, others into a  red. And thus the rustic school, even in the heart of winter, furnished  continuous food for my interest in things. There was no need for precept  and example: my passion for animals and plants made progress of itself.    What did not make progress was my acquaintance with my letters, greatly  neglected in favor of the pigeon. I was still at the same stage,  hopelessly behindhand with the intractable alphabet, when my father, by  a chance inspiration, brought me home from the town what was destined to  give me a start along the road of reading. Despite the not insignificant  part which it played in my intellectual awakening, the purchase was  by no means a ruinous one. It was a large print, price six farthings,  colored and divided into compartments in which animals of all sorts  taught the A B C by means of the first letters of their names.    Where should I keep the precious picture? As it happened, in the room  set apart for the children at home, there was a little window like the  one in the school, opening in the same way out of a sort of recess and  in the same way overlooking most of the village. One was on the right,  the other on the left of the castle with the pigeon house towers; both  afforded an equally good view of the heights of the slanting valley.  I was able to enjoy the school window only at rare intervals, when the  master left his little table; the other was at my disposal as often as I  liked. I spent long hours there, sitting on a little fixed window seat.    The view was magnificent. I could see the ends of the earth, that is  to say, the hills that blocked the horizon, all but a misty gap through  which the brook with the crayfish flowed under the alders and willows.  High up on the skyline, a few wind-battered oaks bristled on the ridges;  and beyond there lay nothing but the unknown, laden with mystery.    At the back of the hollow stood the church, with its three steeples and  its clock; and, a little higher, the village square, where a spring,  fashioned into a fountain, gurgled from one basin into another, under a  wide arched roof. I could hear from my window the chatter of the women  washing their clothes, the strokes of their beaters, the rasping of the  pots scoured with sand and vinegar. Sprinkled over the slopes are little  houses with their garden patches in terraces banked up by tottering  walls, which bulge under the thrust of the earth. Here and there are  very steep lanes, with the dents of the rock forming a natural pavement.  The mule, sure-footed though he be, would hesitate to enter these  dangerous passes with his load of branches.    Further on, beyond the village, half-way up the hills, stood the great  ever-so-old lime tree, the Tel, as we used to call it, whose sides,  hollowed out by the ages, were the favorite hiding places of us children  at play. On fair days, its immense, spreading foliage cast a wide shadow  over the herds of oxen and sheep. Those solemn days, which only came  once a year, brought me a few ideas from without: I learnt that the  world did not end with my amphitheater of hills. I saw the inn keeper's  wine arrive on mule back and in goat skin bottles. I hung about the  market place and watched the opening of jars full of stewed pears, the  setting out of baskets of grapes, an almost unknown fruit, the object  of eager covetousness. I stood and gazed in admiration at the roulette  board on which, for a sou, according to the spot at which its needle  stopped on a circular row of nails, you won a pink poodle made of barley  sugar, or a round jar of aniseed sweets, or, much oftener, nothing at  all. On a piece of canvas on the ground, rolls of printed calico with  red flowers, were displayed to tempt the girls. Close by rose a pile of  beechwood clogs, tops and boxwood flutes. Here the shepherds chose their  instruments, trying them by blowing a note or two. How new it all was  to me! What a lot of things there were to see in this world! Alas,  that wonderful time was of but short duration! At night, after a little  brawling at the inn, it was all over; and the village returned to  silence for a year.    But I must not linger over these memories of the dawn of life. We were  speaking of the memorable picture brought from town. Where shall I keep  it, to make the best use of it? Why, of course, it must be pasted on  the embrasure of my window. The recess, with its seat, shall be my study  cell; here I can feast my eyes by turns on the big lime tree and the  animals of my alphabet. And this was what I did.    And now, my precious picture, it is our turn, yours and mine. You began  with the sacred beast, the ass, whose name, with a big initial, taught  me the letter A. The boeuf, the ox, stood for B; the canard, the duck,  told me about C; the dindon, the turkey, gave me the letter D. And so  on with the rest. A few compartments, it is true, were lacking in  clearness. I had no friendly feeling for the hippopotamus, the kamichi,  or horned screamer, and the zebu, who aimed at making me say H, K and  Z. Those outlandish beasts, which failed to give the abstract letter the  support of a recognized reality, caused me to hesitate for a time over  their recalcitrant consonants. No matter: father came to my aid in  difficult cases; and I made such rapid progress that, in a few days,  I was able to turn in good earnest the pages of my little pigeon book,  hitherto so undecipherable. I was initiated; I knew how to spell. My  parents marveled. I can explain this unexpected progress today. Those  speaking pictures, which brought me amongst my friends the beasts, were  in harmony with my instincts. If the animal has not fulfilled all that  it promised in so far as I am concerned, I have at least to thank it for  teaching me to read. I should have succeeded by other means, I do not  doubt, but not so quickly nor so pleasantly. Animals forever!    Luck favored me a second time. As a reward for my prowess, I was  given La Fontaine's Fables, in a popular, cheap edition, crammed with  pictures, small, I admit, and very inaccurate, but still delightful.  Here were the crow, the fox, the wolf, the magpie, the frog, the rabbit,  the ass, the dog, the cat: all persons of my acquaintance. The glorious  book was immensely to my taste, with its skimpy illustrations on which  the animal walked and talked. As to understanding what it said, that  was another story! Never mind, my lad! Put together syllables that say  nothing to you as yet; they will speak to you later and La Fontaine will  always remain your friend.    I come to the time when I was ten years old and at Rodez College. My  functions as a serving boy in the chapel entitled me to free instruction  as a day boarder. There were four of us in white surplices and red  skull-caps and cassocks. I was the youngest of the party and did little  more than walk on. I counted as a unit; and that was about all, for I  was never certain when to ring the bell or move the missal. I was all  of a tremble when we gathered two on this side and two on that, with  genuflection's, in the middle of the sanctuary, to intone the Domine,  salvum fac regern at the end of mass. Let me make a confession:  tongue-tied with shyness, I used to leave it to the others.    Nevertheless, I was well thought of, for, in the school, I cut a good  figure in composition and translation. In that classical atmosphere,  there was talk of Procas, King of Alba, and of his two sons, Numitor and  Amulius. We heard of Cynoegirus, the strong jawed man, who, having  lost his two hands in battle, seized and held a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3424"],[0,"For the Term of His Natural Life (#17)"],[1,"crowd. There was barely  elbow-room, and attacked and attackers fought almost without knowing  whom they struck. Gabbett tore a cutlass from a soldier, shook his  huge head, and calling on the Moocher to follow, bounded up the ladder,  desperately determined to brave the fire of the watch. The Moocher,  close at the giant's heels, flung himself upon the nearest soldier, and  grasping his wrist, struggled for the cutlass. A brawny, bull-necked  fellow next him dashed his clenched fist in the soldier's face, and the  man maddened by the blow, let go the cutlass, and drawing his pistol,  shot his new assailant through the head. It was this second shot that  had aroused Maurice Frere.    As the young lieutenant sprang out upon the deck, he saw by the position  of the guard that others had been more mindful of the safety of the ship  than he. There was, however, no time for explanation, for, as he reached  the hatchway, he was met by the ascending giant, who uttered a hideous  oath at the sight of this unexpected adversary, and, too close to strike  him, locked him in his arms. The two men were drawn together. The guard  on the quarter-deck dared not fire at the two bodies that, twined  about each other, rolled across the deck, and for a moment Mr. Frere's  cherished existence hung upon the slenderest thread imaginable.    The Moocher, spattered with the blood and brains of his unfortunate  comrade, had already set his foot upon the lowest step of the ladder,  when the cutlass was dashed from his hand by a blow from a clubbed  firelock, and he was dragged roughly backwards. As he fell upon the  deck, he saw the Crow spring out of the mass of prisoners who had been,  an instant before, struggling with the guard, and, gaining the cleared  space at the bottom of the ladder, hold up his hands, as though to  shield himself from a blow. The confusion had now become suddenly  stilled, and upon the group before the barricade had fallen that  mysterious silence which had perplexed the inmates of the prison.    They were not perplexed for long. The two soldiers who, with the  assistance of Pine, had forced-to the door of the prison, rapidly  unbolted that trap-door in the barricade, of which mention has been made  in a previous chapter, and, at a signal from Vickers, three men ran the  loaded howitzer from its sinister shelter near the break of the barrack  berths, and, training the deadly muzzle to a level with the opening in  the barricade, stood ready to fire.    \"Surrender!\" cried Vickers, in a voice from which all \"humanity\" had  vanished. \"Surrender, and give up your ringleaders, or I'll blow you to  pieces!\"    There was no tremor in his voice, and though he stood, with Pine by his  side, at the very mouth of the levelled cannon, the mutineers perceived,  with that acuteness which imminent danger brings to the most stolid  of brains, that, did they hesitate an instant, he would keep his word.  There was an awful moment of silence, broken only by a skurrying noise  in the prison, as though a family of rats, disturbed at a flour cask,  were scampering to the ship's side for shelter. This skurrying noise was  made by the convicts rushing to their berths to escape the threatened  shower of grape; to the twenty desperadoes cowering before the muzzle of  the howitzer it spoke more eloquently than words. The charm was broken;  their comrades would refuse to join them. The position of affairs at  this crisis was a strange one. From the opened trap-door came a sort of  subdued murmur, like that which sounds within the folds of a sea-shell,  but, in the oblong block of darkness which it framed, nothing was  visible. The trap-door might have been a window looking into a tunnel.  On each side of this horrible window, almost pushed before it by the  pressure of one upon the other, stood Pine, Vickers, and the guard. In  front of the little group lay the corpse of the miserable boy whom Sarah  Purfoy had led to ruin; and forced close upon, yet shrinking back from  the trampled and bloody mass, crouched in mingled terror and rage, the  twenty mutineers. Behind the mutineers, withdrawn from the patch of  light thrown by the open hatchway, the mouth of the howitzer threatened  destruction; and behind the howitzer, backed up by an array of brown  musket barrels, suddenly glowed the tiny fire of the burning match in  the hand of Vickers's trusty servant.    The entrapped men looked up the hatchway, but the guard had already  closed in upon it, and some of the ship's crew--with that carelessness  of danger characteristic of sailors--were peering down upon them. Escape  was hopeless.    \"One minute!\" cried Vickers, confident that one second would be  enough--\"one minute to go quietly, or--\"    \"Surrender, mates, for God's sake!\" shrieked some unknown wretch from  out of the darkness of the prison. \"Do you want to be the death of us?\"    Jemmy Vetch, feeling, by that curious sympathy which nervous natures  possess, that his comrades wished him to act as spokesman, raised his  shrill tones. \"We surrender,\" he said. \"It's no use getting our brains  blown out.\" And raising his hands, he obeyed the motion of Vickers's  fingers, and led the way towards the barrack.    \"Bring the irons forward, there!\" shouted Vickers, hastening from his  perilous position; and before the last man had filed past the still  smoking match, the cling of hammers announced that the Crow had resumed  those fetters which had been knocked off his dainty limbs a month  previously in the Bay of Biscay.    In another moment the trap-door was closed, the howitzer rumbled back to  its cleatings, and the prison breathed again.                *          *          *          *          *      In the meantime, a scene almost as exciting had taken place on the upper  deck. Gabbett, with the blind fury which the consciousness of failure  brings to such brute-like natures, had seized Frere by the throat,  determined to put an end to at least one of his enemies. But desperate  though he was, and with all the advantage of weight and strength upon  his side, he found the young lieutenant a more formidable adversary than  he had anticipated.    Maurice Frere was no coward. Brutal and selfish though he might be, his  bitterest enemies had never accused him of lack of physical courage.  Indeed, he had been--in the rollicking days of old that were  gone--celebrated for the display of very opposite qualities. He was an  amateur at manly sports. He rejoiced in his muscular strength, and, in  many a tavern brawl and midnight riot of his own provoking, had proved  the fallacy of the proverb which teaches that a bully is always a  coward. He had the tenacity of a bulldog--once let him get his teeth in  his adversary, and he would hold on till he died. In fact he was, as  far as personal vigour went, a Gabbett with the education of a  prize-fighter; and, in a personal encounter between two men of equal  courage, science tells more than strength. In the struggle, however,  that was now taking place, science seemed to be of little value. To the  inexperienced eye, it would appear that the frenzied giant, gripping  the throat of the man who had fallen beneath him, must rise from the  struggle an easy victor. Brute force was all that was needed--there was  neither room nor time for the display of any cunning of fence.    But knowledge, though it cannot give strength, gives coolness. Taken by  surprise as he was, Maurice Frere did not lose his presence of mind. The  convict was so close upon him that there was no time to strike; but,  as he was forced backwards, he succeeded in crooking his knee round the  thigh of his assailant, and thrust one hand into his collar. Over and  over they rolled, the bewildered sentry not daring to fire, until the  ship's side brought them up with a violent jerk, and Frere realized that  Gabbett was below him. Pressing with all the might of his muscles, he  strove to resist the leverage which the giant was applying to turn him  over, but he might as well have pushed against a stone wall. With his  eyes protruding, and every sinew strained to its uttermost, he was  slowly forced round, and he felt Gabbett releasing his grasp, in order  to draw back and aim at him an effectual blow. Disengaging his left  hand, Frere suddenly allowed himself to sink, and then, drawing up his  right knee, struck Gabbett beneath the jaw, and as the huge head was  forced backwards by the blow, dashed his fist into the brawny throat.  The giant reeled backwards, and, falling on his hands and knees, was in  an instant surrounded by sailors.    Now began and ended, in less time than it takes to write it, one of  those Homeric struggles of one man against twenty, which are none  the less heroic because the Ajax is a convict, and the Trojans merely  ordinary sailors. Shaking his assailants to the deck as easily as a  wild boar shakes off the dogs which clamber upon his bristly sides, the  convict sprang to his feet, and, whirling the snatched-up cutlass round  his head, kept the circle at bay. Four times did the soldiers round the  hatchway raise their muskets, and four times did the fear of wounding  the men who had flung themselves upon the enraged giant compel them to  restrain their fire. Gabbett, his stubbly hair on end, his bloodshot  eyes glaring with fury, his great hand opening and shutting in air, as  though it gasped for something to seize, turned himself about from side  to side--now here, now there, bellowing like a wounded bull. His  coarse shirt, rent from shoulder to flank, exposed the play of his huge  muscles. He was bleeding from a cut on his forehead, and the blood,  trickling down his face, mingled with the foam on his lips, and dropped  sluggishly on his hairy breast. Each time that an assailant came within  reach of the swinging cutlass, the ruffian's form dilated with a fresh  access of passion. At one moment bunched with clinging adversaries--his  arms, legs, and"]]]
