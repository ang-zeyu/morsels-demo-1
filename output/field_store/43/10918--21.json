Many  adult females have the top of the head marked with bright yellow  spots. In adult males, the top and sides of the head, anterior to the  tympanum, are uniformly grayish green or bluish green; the mandibular  and maxillary beaks are brighter, yellowish green. Markings on the  head and neck of most adult males are obscure (Pl. 25) but the sides  of the neck remain mottled in some individuals.    The antebrachium has large imbricated scales and _is_ distinctly set  off from the proximal part of the foreleg which is covered with  granular skin. The antebrachial scales of hatchlings are pale yellow;  each scale is bordered with darker color. General darkening of the  antebrachium occurs at puberty. In adult females each scale on the  anterior surface of the antebrachium is dark brown and has a  contrasting yellow, amber, or pale orange center. The anterior  antebrachial scales of adult males are dark brown to nearly black and  have bright orange or red centers. Old males have thickened  antebrachial scales.    The iris of hatchlings and juveniles is flecked with yellow and brown;  the blending of these colors makes the eye appear yellow, golden, or  light brown when viewed without magnification. Adult females retain  the juvenal coloration of the eye; the iris of adult males is bright  orange or red. The work of Evans (1952) on _T. carolina_ suggests that  eye color in box turtles is under hormonal control.      Wear    Presence or absence of areolae on laminae of the shell indicated  degree and sequence of wear. The anterior edges of carapace and  plastron, and the slightly elevated middorsal line (Pl. 23) wear  smooth in some individuals before the first period of hibernation.  Subsequent wear on the carapace proceeds posteriorly. For example,  turtles that retained the areola of the third central lamina, retained  also the areolae of the fourth and fifth centrals; when only one  central areola remained, it was the fifth. Lateral laminae wear in the  same general sequence. The areola of the fifth central lamina, because  of its protected position, persists in adult turtles that are well  past the age of regular growth. Areolae that are retained in some  older turtles are shed along with the epidermal layers formed in the  first year or two of life. Wear on the shell is probably correlated  with the habits of the individual turtle; smoothly-worn specimens  varied in size and age but were usually larger, older individuals. No  smoothly worn individual was still growing.    Wear on the plastron is more evenly distributed than wear on the  carapace; wear is greatest on the lowest points of the plastron (the  gular laminae, the anterior portions of the anal laminae, and the  lateral edge of the tranverse hinge).    The claws and the horny covering of the jaws are subject to greater  wear than any other part of the epidermis; presumably they continue to  grow throughout life. The occasional examples of hypertrophied beaks  and claws that were observed, chiefly in juveniles, were thought to  result from a continuous diet of soft food or prolonged activity on a  soft substrate. Ditmars (1934:44, Fig. 41) illustrated a specimen of  _T. carolina_, with hypertrophied maxillary beak and abnormally  elongate claws, that had been kept in a house for 27 years.    The conformation of the maxillary beak in all species of _Terrapene_  is influenced to a large extent by wear and is of limited value as a  taxonomic character. The beak of _T. ornata_ is slightly notched in  most individuals at the time of hatching and remains so throughout  life. The underlying premaxillary bone is always notched or  bicuspidate. The sides of the beak are more heavily developed than the  relatively thin central part. Normal wear on the beak maintains the  notch (or deepens it) in the form of an inverted U or V, much in the  manner of the bicrenate cutting edge on the grooved incisors of  certain rodents. In a series of 34 specimens of _T. ornata_ from  Kansas, selected at random from the K. U. collections, 92 per cent had  beaks that were \"notched\" to varying degrees, four per cent had hooked  (unnotched) beaks, and four per cent had beaks that were flat at the  tip (neither hooked nor notched).       [Illustration: FIG. 21. Plantar views of right hind foot (male         at left, female at right) of _T. o. ornata_ (A-- 1), showing         sexual dimorphism in the shape and position of the first toe.         The widened, thickened, and inturned terminal phalanx on the         first toe of the male is used to grasp the female before and         during coitus.]          SEXUAL DIMORPHISM      Differences between adult males and females of _T. ornata_ have been  mentioned in several places in the preceding discussion of growth and  development. Several sexual characteristics--greater preanal length,  thickened base of the tail, slightly concave plastron, and smaller  bulk--are found also in males of many other kinds of emyid turtles.  From females, males of _T. ornata_ are most easily distinguished by  the bright colors of their eyes, heads, and antebrachial scales. An  additional, distinctive characteristic of males is the highly modified  hind foot. The first toe is greatly thickened and widened; when the  foot is extended, the first toe is held in a horizontal plane nearly  at right angles to the medial edge of the plantar surface (Fig. 21).  The hind foot of females is unmodified in this respect. Males tend to  have heavier, more muscular hind legs than females.    The bright colors of males are maintained throughout the year and do  not become more intense in the breeding season. Males of _T. o.  luteola_ become melanistic in old age whereas males of the subspecies  _ornata_ do not. In old males of _luteola_ the skin becomes dark gray,  bluish, or nearly black and much of the bright orange or red of the  antebrachial scales and the green of the head is obliterated; the iris  may also darken but in most specimens it retains some red. Females of  _luteola_ tend also to darken somewhat in old age but not so much as  males; females of _ornata_ do not.

Other species of turtles living in the  same area are more nearly aquatic and therefore live in a microhabitat  that is more stable as regards temperature.    Approximately 500 temperature readings in the field and many others in  the laboratory were obtained from enough individuals to permit  interpretation of reactions involved in basking, in seeking cover, and  in emerging from temporary periods of quiescence at various times of  the day.    Box turtles commonly used open places such as cow paths, ravines, and  wallows, for basking as well as for feeding and as routes of travel.  Burrows, dens beneath rocks, and forms, were used as shelter from high  and low temperatures as well as from predators. Determining whether a  turtle was truly active (moving about freely, feeding, or copulating),  was basking, or was seeking shelter was difficult because the turtle  sometimes reacted to the observer; for instance, basking turtles,  whose body temperatures were still suboptimum, might take cover when  surprised, and truly active turtles"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37595"],[0,"Ecological Studies of the Timber Wolf in Northeastern Minnesota (#17)"],[1,"wolves to capture deer. Recent  studies of wolves and deer in northeastern Minnesota (see Mech _et  al._, p. 1, also Mech and Frenzel, p. 35) afforded us opportunities to  investigate the relationships between snow and the interactions of  wolves and deer.      METHODS    Two principal methods of study were used in this investigation. The  first involved recording the snow depth and support quality  (\"penetrability\") in feet and tenths of feet (Verme 1968). Snow  measurements were taken during the winters of 1966-67, 1967-68, and  1968-69, in which large differences in snow conditions existed. Ten  such measurements were made weekly near Isabella, Minnesota, in an open  aspen (_Populus tremuloides_) stand away from influences that might  have caused drifting or other unusual snow conditions; the measurements  were averaged. Penetrability was determined with Verme's  snow-compaction gauge--a 3-foot piece of 1-1/8-inch (outside diameter)  copper tube filled with lead to total 3 pounds, which gives a weight  per area of 211 gm./cm.^2. To obtain a measurement, the pipe is held  vertically with its lower end just flush with the snow, and then is  released. The depth to which it sinks is considered the penetrability  of the snowpack by a walking deer.    Although the snow conditions measured at Isabella are not  representative of the entire study area, year-to-year comparison in the  Isabella area should also apply generally throughout the region.    The second technique used in this study was observing the movements of  wolves and deer. This was usually done from low-flying aircraft, and  was facilitated by the use of radiotracking, as described by Mech _et  al._ (p. 1). Close inspection of wolf-killed deer was made from the  ground (Mech and Frenzel, p. 35).      RESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS    Snow measurements for each winter are shown in figures 1 through 3. The  winter of 1968-69 was the most extreme of the three in terms of  accumulated snow, and was generally regarded as having one of the  heaviest snowfalls and accumulations on record for the study area. Snow  depth on the level near Isabella reached 3.9 feet at one time, and from  January 3 to April 4 it exceeded 2.4 feet. The highest snow level  reached during 1966-67 was 2.4 feet, and the highest level reached  during 1967-68 was 1.4 feet. In the vicinity of Ely, some 30 miles from  Isabella, the 1968-69 peak accumulation was 39 inches, the highest  accumulation since 1948-49 when records were first kept.[36] Thus we  consider the winters of 1966-67 and 1967-68 to be within the normal  range for the study area, and the 1968-69 winter as being most unusual  (fig. 4).    [Illustration: _Figure 1.--Snow depth and penetrability by deer and  wolves near Isabella, Minnesota, 1966-67._]    [Illustration: _Figure 2.--Snow depth and penetrability by deer and  wolves near Isabella, Minnesota, 1967-68._]    [Illustration: _Figure 3.--Snow depth and penetrability by deer and  wolves near Isabella, Minnesota, 1968-69._]    The snow penetrability in 1966-67 remained high throughout January,  February, and March. During the following winter, penetrability  fluctuated more, but even at its greatest, it was relatively  unimportant to deer because the total snow depth was so low. During  1968-69, however, penetrability was a very important aspect of snow  condition. It was so high during late January and early February, when  snow accumulation was also at its peak, that a walking deer would be  expected to sink in 2.5 to 3.5 feet. Snow penetrability then decreased  through February and March to a point where a walking deer would sink  in approximately 0.6 foot on March 21. However, because snow  accumulation remained so high through February and March, the lower  penetrability during late February and March still afforded no relief  to running deer, because they must exert forces several times as great  as when walking. On the contrary, the low penetrability (which is an  indirect measure of density) could be expected to hinder a running deer  in deep snow, for it would cause much more resistance.    [Illustration: _Figure 4.--During the winter of 1968-69, the snow was  unusually deep in the study area. (Photo courtesy of L. D. Frenzel.)_]    Deer movements, like snow conditions, varied greatly during the three  winters of the study. During the first two winters, deer were generally  found singly and in groups of two to six, often around the shores of  lakes but also scattered about inland. In late January and February  1967, running deer were observed sinking deeply into snow, but their  movements still did not seem to be hindered, no doubt because of the  high penetrability (low density) of the snow that year (fig. 1).    However, during late January, February, and March of 1969 the deer were  much more concentrated, mostly in conifer swamps, along  southwest-facing slopes, or on lakes. Although groups of two or three  animals could be found in scattered inland \"pockets\" throughout the  winter, groups of five or six were not uncommon on lakes during  January. The tendency to concentrate continued to increase, and on  February 6, as many as 11 deer were observed on one lake; by March 13,  group size had increased to as high as 22 deer in the same area.  Throughout February and March, heavy concentrations of deer tracks  covered most wilderness lakes, further evidencing much greater use of  shorelines than had occurred in the two previous winters (fig. 5).    No doubt deer tended to concentrate on lakes because travel inland  became so difficult. On January 28, two deer were seen plowing through  snow up to their necks. Although the snow began settling in February,  and the penetrability decreased, by late February running deer still  plunged chest-deep and had to hesitate at every bound. These conditions  persisted until about March 26, by which time a surface crust strong  enough to hold a running deer had formed.    [Illustration: _Figure 5.--Under unusually deep snow conditions, deer  used lake shores heavily. (Photo courtesy of L. D. Mech.)_]    In considering wolf mobility in snow, two types of movement must be  recognized: the trot used during general travel, and the bounding used  while chasing prey. The trot is an easy gait of about 5 m.p.h. on firm  footing (Mech 1970), and can be continued for hours at a time. During  periods of deep snow and high penetrability, most wolf travel is on  frozen waterways, roads, snowmobile trails, and animal trails,  including the wolves' own pathways, which become well packed with  frequent use (fig. 6, 7A, B). Such travel was observed during each of  the three winters of this study.    [Illustration: _Figure 6.--Wolves travel single file in deep snow.  (Photo courtesy of L. D. Mech.)_]    [Illustration: _Figure 7.--(A) A single wolf must break his own trail  through the snow. (Photo courtesy of L. D. Frenzel.) (B) Regular use by  a pack keeps trails open. (Photo courtesy of L. D. Mech.)_]    The second type of wolf movement affected by snow is the leaping and  bounding associated with chasing prey. The shallower angle of the  wolf's bound (fig. 8) (compared with that of the deer) often causes the  wolf to flounder in snow that presents little hinderance to deer (Mech  1970). Such was the case in January and February 1967 in our study  area. During 1967-68 no observations of wolves chasing deer were made  by the authors, but reports by other field workers indicated that  running conditions were similar to those of 1967.    [Illustration: _Figure 8.--Wolves run at a shallow angle, thus  hindering them in deep snow. (Photo courtesy of D. H. Pimlott.)_]    During the winter of 1968-69, wolves also bogged down a great deal in  snow when chasing deer. However, after January 1969 the snow was so  deep that deer were floundering even more than wolves in many cases.  The fact that wolves could run in the trail broken by deer probably  also gave the wolves an advantage under the conditions that severely  restricted deer movements.    The above observations of snow conditions, deer movements, and wolf  movements during the three winters of the study are in accord with  observations made on the differences in the ability of the wolves to  capture deer during the same period. Two indices support the conclusion  that wolves had a much easier time catching deer during February and  March 1969 than earlier in the winter and in the two previous winters:  (1) the degree of utilization of wolf-killed deer, and (2) the kill  rate of radiotagged wolves.    During the winters of 1966-67 and 1967-68, and in December and early  January 1968-69, most wolf-killed deer found had been thoroughly eaten,  and the bones--if present at all--were well chewed and scattered at  each kill (fig. 9). All skin and flesh from the skull were eaten, and  the mandible was usually separated from the skull. During late February  and early March 1967, few fresh kills were even found, and wolves were  returning several times to old kills that had been cleaned up many days  before.    [Illustration: _Figure 9.--Usually the remains of a wolf kill are well  chewed and scattered before the wolves abandon them. (Photo courtesy of  L. D. Mech.)_]    [Illustration: _Figure 10.--During a period of especially deep snow,  wolves abandoned many kills before pulling apart the skeletons. (Photo  courtesy of L. D. Mech.)_]    However, in late January 1969 a substantial change began taking place.  The skeletons of most kills found were almost intact, the flesh having  been eaten from around the bones (fig. 10). Appreciably more skin was  usually left on the carcass, especially on the side lying on the snow,  and the neck and head were generally intact. This was true even of  fawns, which in the past often were almost completely consumed.    In several cases, only about half of the flesh had been eaten from the  carcasses. On February 2, 1969, four deer recently killed by wolves  were"]]]
