I know a little of  their language.\"    \"Have you any one dependent on you?\"    \"I am a bachelor,\" Captain Carver replied.    \"Does twenty-five hundred a year appeal to you?\"    \"That depends entirely on what services I should be expected to render.\"    Confident that he had landed his man, and convinced from Captain Rouse's  recommendation and his own observations that Carver was the very person  he had been seeking, Peter Gross threw reserve aside and frankly stated  the object of his expedition and the difficulties before him.    \"You see,\" he concluded, \"the game is dangerous, but the stakes are big.  I have no doubt but what Governor Van Schouten will deal handsomely with  every one who helps restore order in the residency.\"    Captain Carver was frowning.    \"I don't like the idea of playing one native element against another,\"  he declared. \"It always breeds trouble. The only people who have ever  been successful in pulling it off is the British in India, and they had  to pay for it in blood during the Mutiny. The one way to pound the fear  of God into the hearts of these benighted browns and blacks is to show  them you're master. Once they get the idea the white man can't keep his  grip without them, look out for treachery.\"    \"I've thought of that,\" Peter Gross replied sadly. \"But to do as you  suggest will take at least two regiments and will cost the lives of  several thousand Dyaks. You will have to lay the country bare, and you  will sow a seed of hate that is bound to bear fruit. But if I can  persuade them to trust me, Bulungan will be pacified. Brooke did it in  Sarawak, and I believe I can do it here.\"    Carver stroked his chin in silence.    \"You know the country,\" he said. \"If you have faith and feel you want  me, I'll go with you.\"    \"I'll have a lawyer make the contracts at once,\" Peter Gross replied.  \"We can sign them to-morrow.\"    \"Can't you take me with you, too, Mr. Gross?\" Paddy Rouse asked eagerly.    Peter Gross looked at the lad. The boy's face was eloquent with  entreaty.    \"How old are you?\" he asked.    \"Seventeen,\" came the halting acknowledgment. \"But I've done a man's  work for a year. Haven't I, avunculus?\"    Captain Rouse nodded a reluctant assent. \"I hate to miss ye, my boy,\" he  said, \"but maybe a year out there would get the deviltry out of ye and  make a man of ye. If Peter wants ye, he may have ye.\"    A flash of inspiration came to Peter Gross as he glanced at the boy's  tousled shock of fiery-red hair.    \"I'll take you on a private's pay,\" he said. \"A thousand a year. Is that  satisfactory?\"    \"I'm signed,\" Paddy whooped. \"Hooray!\"           *       *       *       *       *    When Peter Gross and his company left Tanjong Priok a fortnight later  Captain Rouse bade them a wistful good-bye at the wharf.    \"Take care of the lad; he's all I got,\" he said huskily to the resident.  \"If it wasn't for the damned plantation I'd go with ye, too.\"          CHAPTER XI    MYNHEER MULLER'S DREAM      The Dutch gun-boat _Prins Lodewyk_, a terror to evil-doers in the Java  and Celebes seas, steamed smartly up Bulungan Bay and swung into  anchorage a quarter of a mile below the assemblage of junks and Malay  proas clustered at the mouth of Bulungan River. She carried a new flag  below her ensign, the resident's flag. As she swung around, her guns  barked a double salute, first to the flag and then to the resident.  Peter Gross and his company were come to Bulungan.    The pert brass cannon of the stockade answered gun for gun. It was the  yapping of terrier against mastiff, for the artillery of the fortress  was of small caliber and an ancient pattern. Its chief service was to  intimidate the natives of the town who had once been bombarded during an  unfortunate rebellion and had never quite forgotten the sensation of  being under shell-fire.    Peter Gross leaned over the rail of the vessel and looked fixedly  shoreward. His strong, firm chin was grimly set. There were lines in his  face that had not been there a few weeks before when he was tendered and  accepted his appointment as resident. Responsibility was sitting  heavily upon his shoulders, for he now realized the magnitude of the  task he had so lightly assumed.    Captain Carver joined him. \"All's well, so far, Mr. Gross,\" he observed.    Peter Gross let the remark stand without comment for a moment. \"Ay,  all's well so far,\" he assented heavily.    There was another pause.    \"Are we going ashore this afternoon?\" Carver inquired.    \"That is my intention.\"    \"Then you'll want the boys to get their traps on deck. At what hour will  you want them?\"    \"I think I shall go alone,\" Peter Gross replied quietly.    Carver looked up quickly. \"Not alone, Mr. Gross,\" he expostulated.    Peter Gross looked sternly shoreward at the open water-front of Bulungan  town, where dugouts, sampans, and crude bark canoes were frantically  shooting about to every point of the compass in helter-skelter  confusion.    \"I think it would be best,\" he said.    Carver shook his head. \"I don't think I'd do it, Mr. Gross,\" he advised  gravely. \"I don't think you ought to take the chance.\"    \"To convince an enemy you are not afraid is often half the fight,\" Peter  Gross observed.    \"A good rule, but it doesn't apply to a pack of assassins,\" Carver  replied. \"And that's what we seem to be up against. You can't take too  big precautions against whelps that stab in the dark.\"    Peter Gross attempted no contradiction. The ever increasing concourse of  scantily clad natives along the shore held his attention. Carver scanned  his face anxiously.    \"They pretty nearly got you at Batavia, Mr. Gross,\" he reminded, anxiety  overcoming his natural disinclination to give a superior unsolicited  advice.    \"You may be right,\" Peter Gross conceded mildly.    Carver pushed his advantage. \"If Ah Sing's tong men will take a chance  at murdering you in Batavia under the nose of the governor, they won't  balk at putting you out of the way in Bulungan, a thousand miles from  nowhere. There's a hundred ways they can get rid of a man and make it  look like an accident.\"    \"We must expect to take some risks.\"    Perceiving the uselessness of argument, Carver made a final plea. \"At  least let me go with you,\" he begged.    Peter Gross sighed and straightened to his full six feet two. \"Thank  you, captain,\" he said, \"but I must go alone. I want to teach Bulungan  one thing to-day--that Peter Gross is not afraid.\"    While Captain Carver was vainly trying to dissuade Peter Gross from  going ashore, Kapitein Van Slyck hastened from his quarters at the fort  to the _controlleur's_ house. Muller was an uncertain quantity in a  crisis, the captain was aware; it was vital that they act in perfect  accord. He found his associate pacing agitatedly in the shade of a  screen of nipa palms between whose broad leaves he could watch the trim  white hull and spotless decks of the gun-boat.    Muller was smoking furiously. At the crunch of Van Slyck's foot on the  coraled walk he turned quickly, with a nervous start, and his face  blanched.    \"Oh, _kapitein_,\" he exclaimed with relief, \"is it you?\"    \"Who else would it be?\" Van Slyck growled, perceiving at once that  Muller had worked himself into a frenzy of apprehension.    \"I don't know. I thought, perhaps, Cho Seng--\"    \"You look as though you'd seen a ghost. What's there about Cho Seng to  be afraid of?\"    \"--that Cho Seng had come to tell me Mynheer Gross was here,\" Muller  faltered.    Van Slyck looked at him keenly, through narrowed lids.    \"Hum!\" he grunted with emphasis. \"So it is Mynheer Gross already with  you, eh, Muller?\"    There was a significant emphasis on the \"_mynheer_.\"    Muller flushed. \"Don't get the notion I'm going to sweet-mouth to him  simply because he is resident, _kapitein_,\" he retorted, recovering his  dignity. \"You know me well enough--my foot is in this as deeply as  yours.\"    \"Yes, and deeper,\" Van Slyck replied significantly.    The remark escaped Muller. He was thrusting aside the screen of nipa  leaves to peer toward the vessel.    \"No,\" he exclaimed with a sigh of relief, \"he has not left the ship yet.  There are two civilians at the forward rail--come, _kapitein_, do you  think one of them is he?\"    He opened the screen wider for Van Slyck. The captain stepped forward  with an expression of bored indifference and peered through the  aperture.    \"H-m!\" he muttered. \"I wouldn't be surprised if the big fellow is Gross.  They say he has the inches.\"    \"I hope to heaven he stays aboard to-day,\" Muller prayed fervently.    \"He can come ashore whenever he wants to, for all I care,\" Van Slyck  remarked.    Muller straightened and let the leaves fall back.    \"_Lieve hemel, neen, kapitein_,\" he expostulated. \"What would I do if he  should question me. My reports are undone, there are a dozen cases to be  tried, I have neglected to settle matters with some of the chiefs, and  my accounts are in a muddle. I don't see how I am ever going to  straighten things out--then there are those other things--what will he  say?\"    He ran his hands through his hair in nervous anxiety. Van Slyck  contemplated his agitation with a darkening frown. \"Is the fool going to  pieces?\" was the captain's harrowing thought. He clapped a hand on  Muller's shoulder with an assumption of bluff heartiness.    \"'Sufficient unto the day--' You know the proverb, _mynheer_,\" he said  cheerfully. \"There's nothing to worry about--we won't give him a chance  at you for two weeks. Kapitein Enckel of the _Prins_ will probably bring  him ashore to-day. We'll receive him here; I'll bring my lieutenants  over, and Cho Seng can make us a big dinner.    \"To-night there will be schnapps "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3725"],[0,"Famous Men of the Middle Ages (#17)"],[1,"could hardly be called an army.    After a long march Godfrey reached Antioch and laid siege to it.    It was believed that this Moslem stronghold could be taken in a  short time; but the city resisted the attacks of the Christians  for seven months. Then it surrendered.    And now something happened that none of the Crusaders had dreamed  of. An army of two hundred thousand Persians arrived to help the  Moslems. They laid siege to Antioch and shut up the Crusaders within  its walls for weeks. However, after a number of engagements in  which there was great loss of life, the Turks and Persians were  at last driven away.    The way was now opened to Jerusalem. But out of the half million  Crusaders who had marched from Europe less than fifty thousand  were left. They had won their way at a fearful cost.    Still onward they pushed with brave hearts, until on a bright summer  morning they caught the first glimpse of the Holy City in the distance.  For two whole years they had toiled and suffered in the hope of  reaching Jerusalem. Now it lay before them.    [Illustration: ENTRY OF THE CRUSADERS INTO JERUSALEM]    But it had yet to be taken. For more than five weeks the Crusaders  carried on the siege. Finally, on the 15th of July, 1099, the Turks  surrendered. The Moslem flag was hauled down and the banner of  the cross floated over the Holy City.    A few days after the Christians had occupied Jerusalem Godfrey of  Bouillon was chosen king of the Holy Land.    \"I will accept the office,\" he said, \"but no crown must be put  on my head and I must never be called king. I cannot wear a crown  of gold where Christ wore one of thorns nor will I be called king  in the land where once lived the King of Kings.\"    Peter the Hermit is said to have preached an eloquent sermon on  the Mount of Olives. He did not, however, remain long in Jerusalem,  but after the capture of the city returned to Europe. He founded  a monastery in France and within its walls passed the rest of his  life.          FREDERICK BARBAROSSA    EMPEROR FROM 1152-1190    I    Frederick I was one of the most famous of German emperors. He was  a tall, stalwart man of majestic appearance. He had a long red  beard and so the people called him Barbarossa, or Red-Beard. He  came to the throne in 1152.    At that time the province of Lombardy in northern Italy was a part  of the German empire.    In 1158 Milan (_mi-lan'_), the chief city of Lombardy, revolted.  Then over the Alps came an army of a hundred thousand German soldiers,  with Frederick at their head. After a long siege the city surrendered.    But soon it revolted again. The emperor besieged it once more and  once more it surrendered. Its fortifications were destroyed and  many of its buildings ruined.    But even then the spirit of the Lombards was not broken. Milan  and the other cities of Lombardy united in a league and defied  the emperor. He called upon the German dukes to bring their men  to his aid. All responded except Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony,  Frederick's cousin, whom he had made duke of Bavaria also. Frederick  is said to have knelt and implored Henry to do his duty, but in  vain.    [Illustration: FREDERICK AT THE FEET OF HENRY THE LION]    In his campaign against the Lombards Frederick was unsuccessful.  His army was completely defeated and he was compelled to grant  freedom to the cities of Lombardy. Everybody blamed Henry the Lion.  The other dukes charged him with treason and he was summoned to  appear before a meeting of the nobles. He failed to come and the  nobles thereupon declared him guilty and took from him everything  that he had, except the lands he had inherited from his father.    Frederick now devoted himself to making Germany a united nation.  Two of his nobles had been quarreling for a long time and as a  punishment for their conduct each was condemned, with ten of his  counts and barons, to carry dogs on his shoulders from one country  to another.    Frederick finally succeeded in keeping the nobles in the different  provinces of Germany at peace with one another, and persuaded them  to work together for the good of the whole empire. He had no more  trouble with them and for many years his reign was peaceful and  prosperous.    II    After the Christians had held Jerusalem for eighty-eight years, it  was recaptured by the Moslems under the lead of the famous Sal'a-din,  in the year 1187. There was much excitement in Christendom, and the  Pope proclaimed another Crusade.    Frederick immediately raised an army of Crusaders in the German  Empire and with one hundred and fifty thousand men started for  Palestine.    He marched into Asia Minor, attacked the Moslem forces, and defeated  them in two great battles.    But before the brave old warrior reached the Holy Land his career  was suddenly brought to an end. One day his army was crossing a  small bridge over a river in Asia Minor. At a moment when the bridge  was crowded with troops Frederick rode up rapidly.    [Illustration: NOBLES CARYING DOGS]    He was impatient to join his son, who was leading the advance guard;  and when he found that he could not cross immediately by the bridge,  he plunged into the river to swim his horse across. Both horse and  rider were swept away by the current. Barbarossa's heavy armor  made him helpless and he was drowned. His body was recovered and  buried at Antioch.    Barbarossa was so much loved by his people that it was said, \"Germany  and Frederick Barbarossa are one in the hearts of the Germans.\"  His death caused the greatest grief among the German Crusaders.  They had now little heart to fight the infidels and most of them  at once returned to Germany.    In the Empire the dead hero was long mourned and for many years  the peasants believed that Frederick was not really dead, but was  asleep in a cave in the mountains of Germany, with his gallant  knights around him. He was supposed to be sitting in his chair  of state, with the crown upon his head, his eyes half-closed in  slumber, his beard as white as snow and so long that it reached  the ground.    \"When the ravens cease to fly round the mountain,\" said the legend,  \"Barbarossa shall awake and restore Germany to its ancient greatness.\"          HENRY THE SECOND 1154-1189    AND    HIS SONS 1189-1216    I    In 1154, while Barbarossa was reigning in Germany, Henry II, one  of England's greatest monarchs, came to the throne.    Henry was the son of Geoffrey Plan-tag'e-net, Count of Anjou in  France, and Matilda, daughter of King Henry I and granddaughter of  William the Conqueror. Count Geoffrey used to wear in his hat a sprig  of the broom plant, which is called in Latin _planta genista_. From  this he adopted the name Plantagenet, and the kings who descended  from him and ruled England for more than three hundred years are  called the Plantagenets.    Henry II inherited a vast domain in France and managing this in  addition England kept him very busy. One who knew him well said,  \"He never sits down; he is on his feet from morning till night.\"    His chief assistant in the management of public affairs was Thomas  Becket, whom he made chancellor of the kingdom. Becket was fond  of pomp and luxury, and lived in a more magnificent manner than  even the king himself.    The clergy had at this time become almost independent of the king.  To bring them under his authority Henry made Becket Archbishop of  Canterbury, thus putting him at the head of the Church in England.  The king expected that Becket would carry out all his wishes.    Becket, however, refused to do that which the king most desired  and a quarrel arose between them. At last, to escape the king's  anger, Becket fled to France and remained there for six years.    At the end of this time Henry invited him to come back to England.  Not long after, however, the old quarrel began again. One day while  Henry was sojourning in France, he cried out in a moment of passion,  while surrounded by a group of knights, \"Is there no one who will  rid me of this turbulent priest?\"    Four knights who heard him understood from this angry speech that  he desired the death of Becket, and they went to England to murder  the Archbishop. When they met Becket they first demanded that he  should do as the king wished, but he firmly refused. At dusk that  same day they entered Canterbury Cathedral, again seeking for him.  \"Where is the traitor, Thomas Becket?\" one of them cried.    Becket boldly answered, \"Here am I--no traitor, but a priest of  god.\"    As he finished speaking the knights rushed upon him and killed him.    [Illustration: THE MURDERED ARCHBISHOP]    The people of England were horrified by this brutal murder. Becket  was called a martyr and his tomb became a place of pious pilgrimage.  The Pope canonized him and for years he was the most venerated of  English saints.    King Henry was in Normandy when the murder occurred. He declared  that he had had nothing whatever to do with it and he punished  the murderers.    But from this time Henry had many troubles. His own sons rebelled  against him, his barons were unfriendly, and conspiracies were  formed. Henry thought that God was punishing him for the murder of  Becket and so determined to do penance at the tomb of the saint.    For some distance before he reached Canterbury Cathedral where  Becket was buried he walked over the road with bare head and feet.  After his arrival he fasted and prayed a day and a night. The next  day he put scourges into the hands of the cathedral monks and said,  \"Scourge me as I kneel at the tomb of the saint.\" The monks did  as he bade them and he patiently bore the pain.    Henry finally triumphed over his enemies and had some years of peace,  which he devoted to the good of England.    In the last year of his life, however, he had trouble again. The  king of France and Henry's son Richard took up arms against him.  Henry was defeated and was forced to grant what they wished."]]]
