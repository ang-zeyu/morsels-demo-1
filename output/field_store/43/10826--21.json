[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30755"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 2 (of 3), (#17)"],[1,"of  the city, is assuredly not owing either to the beauty of its  architecture or to the impressiveness of the Scripture histories  embodied in its mosaics. That it has a peculiar effect, however slight,  on the popular mind, may perhaps be safely conjectured from the number  of worshippers which it attracts, while the churches of St. Paul and the  Frari, larger in size and more central in position, are left  comparatively empty.[28] But this effect is altogether to be ascribed to  its richer assemblage of those sources of influence which address  themselves to the commonest instincts of the human mind, and which, in  all ages and countries, have been more or less employed in the support  of superstition. Darkness and mystery; confused recesses of building;  artificial light employed in small quantity, but maintained with a  constancy which seems to give it a kind of sacredness; preciousness of  material easily comprehended by the vulgar eye; close air loaded with a  sweet and peculiar odor associated only with religious services, solemn  music, and tangible idols or images having popular legends attached to  them,--these, the stage properties of superstition, which have been from  the beginning of the world, and must be to the end of it, employed by  all nations, whether openly savage or nominally civilized, to produce a  false awe in minds incapable of apprehending the true nature of the  Deity, are assembled in St. Mark's to a degree, as far as I know,  unexampled in any other European church. The arts of the Magus and the  Brahmin are exhausted in the animation of a paralyzed Christianity; and  the popular sentiment which these arts excite is to be regarded by us  with no more respect than we should have considered ourselves justified  in rendering to the devotion of the worshippers at Eleusis, Ellora, or  Edfou.[29]    Sec. XXI. Indeed, these inferior means of exciting religious emotion were  employed in the ancient Church as they are at this day, but not employed  alone. Torchlight there was, as there is now; but the torchlight  illumined Scripture histories on the walls, which every eye traced and  every heart comprehended, but which, during my whole residence in  Venice, I never saw one Venetian regard for an instant. I never heard  from any one the most languid expression of interest in any feature of  the church, or perceived the slightest evidence of their understanding  the meaning of its architecture; and while, therefore, the English  cathedral, though no longer dedicated to the kind of services for which  it was intended by its builders, and much at variance in many of its  characters with the temper of the people by whom it is now surrounded,  retains yet so much of its religious influence that no prominent feature  of its architecture can be said to exist altogether in vain, we have in  St. Mark's a building apparently still employed in the ceremonies for  which it was designed, and yet of which the impressive attributes have  altogether ceased to be comprehended by its votaries. The beauty which  it possesses is unfelt, the language it uses is forgotten; and in the  midst of the city to whose service it has so long been consecrated, and  still filled by crowds of the descendants of those to whom it owes its  magnificence, it stands, in reality, more desolate than the ruins  through which the sheep-walk passes unbroken in our English valleys; and  the writing on its marble walls is less regarded and less powerful for  the teaching of men, than the letters which the shepherd follows with  his finger, where the moss is lightest on the tombs in the desecrated  cloister.    Sec. XXII. It must therefore be altogether without reference to its  present usefulness, that we pursue our inquiry into the merits and meaning  of the architecture of this marvellous building; and it can only be after  we have terminated that inquiry, conducting it carefully on abstract  grounds, that we can pronounce with any certainty how far the present  neglect of St. Mark's is significative of the decline of the Venetian  character, or how far this church is to be considered as the relic of a  barbarous age, incapable of attracting the admiration, or influencing  the feelings of a civilized community.    The inquiry before us is twofold. Throughout the first volume, I  carefully kept the study of _expression_ distinct from that of abstract  architectural perfection; telling the reader that in every building we  should afterwards examine, he would have first to form a judgment of its  construction and decorative merit, considering it merely as a work of  art; and then to examine farther, in what degree it fulfilled its  expressional purposes. Accordingly, we have first to judge of St. Mark's  merely as a piece of architecture, not as a church; secondly, to  estimate its fitness for its special duty as a place of worship, and the  relation in which it stands, as such, to those northern cathedrals that  still retain so much of the power over the human heart, which the  Byzantine domes appear to have lost for ever.    Sec. XXIII. In the two succeeding sections of this work, devoted  respectively to the examination of the Gothic and Renaissance buildings  in Venice, I have endeavored to analyze and state, as briefly as  possible, the true nature of each school,--first in Spirit, then in  Form. I wished to have given a similar analysis, in this section, of the  nature of Byzantine architecture; but could not make my statements  general, because I have never seen this kind of building on its native  soil. Nevertheless, in the following sketch of the principles  exemplified in St. Mark's, I believe that most of the leading features  and motives of the style will be found clearly enough distinguished to  enable the reader to judge of it with tolerable fairness, as compared  with the better known systems of European architecture in the middle  ages.    Sec. XXIV. Now the first broad characteristic of the building, and the  root nearly of every other important peculiarity in it, is its confessed  _incrustation_. It is the purest example in Italy of the great school of  architecture in which the ruling principle is the incrustation of brick  with more precious materials; and it is necessary before we proceed to  criticise any one of its arrangements, that the reader should carefully  consider the principles which are likely to have influenced, or might  legitimately influence, the architects of such a school, as  distinguished from those whose designs are to be executed in massive  materials.    It is true, that among different nations, and at different times, we may  find examples of every sort and degree of incrustation, from the mere  setting of the larger and more compact stones by preference at the  outside of the wall, to the miserable construction of that modern brick  cornice, with its coating of cement, which, but the other day, in  London, killed its unhappy workmen in its fall.[30] But just as it is  perfectly possible to have a clear idea of the opposing characteristics  of two different species of plants or animals, though between the two  there are varieties which it is difficult to assign either to the one or  the other, so the reader may fix decisively in his mind the legitimate  characteristics of the incrusted and the massive styles, though between  the two there are varieties which confessedly unite the attributes of  both. For instance, in many Roman remains, built of blocks of tufa and  incrusted with marble, we have a style, which, though truly solid,  possesses some of the attributes of incrustation; and in the Cathedral  of Florence, built of brick and coated with marble, the marble facing is  so firmly and exquisitely set, that the building, though in reality  incrusted, assumes the attributes of solidity. But these intermediate  examples need not in the least confuse our generally distinct ideas of  the two families of buildings: the one in which the substance is alike  throughout, and the forms and conditions of the ornament assume or prove  that it is so, as in the best Greek buildings, and for the most part in  our early Norman and Gothic; and the other, in which the substance is of  two kinds, one internal, the other external, and the system of  decoration is founded on this duplicity, as pre-eminently in St. Mark's.    Sec. XXV. I have used the word duplicity in no depreciatory sense. In  chapter ii. of the \"Seven Lamps,\" Sec. 18, I especially guarded this  incrusted school from the imputation of insincerity, and I must do so  now at greater length. It appears insincere at first to a Northern  builder, because, accustomed to build with solid blocks of freestone, he  is in the habit of supposing the external superficies of a piece of  masonry to be some criterion of its thickness. But, as soon as he gets  acquainted with the incrusted style, he will find that the Southern  builders had no intention to deceive him. He will see that every slab of  facial marble is fastened to the next by a confessed _rivet_, and that  the joints of the armor are so visibly and openly accommodated to the  contours of the substance within, that he has no more right to complain  of treachery than a savage would have, who, for the first time in his  life seeing a man in armor, had supposed him to be made of solid steel.  Acquaint him with the customs of chivalry, and with the uses of the coat  of mail, and he ceases to accuse of dishonesty either the panoply or the  knight.    These laws and customs of the St. Mark's architectural chivalry it must  be our business to develope.    Sec. XXVI. First, consider the natural circumstances which give rise to  such a style. Suppose a nation of builders, placed far from any quarries  of available stone, and having precarious access to the mainland where  they exist; compelled therefore either to build entirely with brick, or  to import whatever stone they use from great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30756"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 3 (of 3) (#17)"],[1," sumptuous of the three; it first arrests the eye of the stranger, and  long detains it,--a many-pinnacled pile surrounded by niches with  statues of the warrior saints.    It is beautiful, for it still belongs to the noble time, the latter part  of the fourteenth century; but its work is coarser than that of the  other, and its pride may well prepare us to learn that it was built for  himself, in his own lifetime, by the man whose statue crowns it, Can  Signorio della Scala. Now observe, for this is infinitely significant.  Can Mastino II. was feeble and wicked, and began the ruin of his house;  his sarcophagus is the first which bears upon it the image of a virtue,  but he lays claim only to Fortitude. Can Signorio was twice a  fratricide, the last time when he lay upon his death-bed: _his_ tomb  bears upon its gables the images of six virtues,--Faith, Hope, Charity,  Prudence, and (I believe) Justice and Fortitude.    Sec. LVII. Let us now return to Venice, where, in the second chapel  counting from right to left, at the west end of the Church of the Frari,  there is a very early fourteenth, or perhaps late thirteenth, century  tomb, another exquisite example of the perfect Gothic form. It is a  knight's; but there is no inscription upon it, and his name is unknown.  It consists of a sarcophagus, supported on bold brackets against the  chapel wall, bearing the recumbent figure, protected by a simple canopy  in the form of a pointed arch, pinnacled by the knight's crest; beneath  which the shadowy space is painted dark blue, and strewn with stars. The  statue itself is rudely carved; but its lines, as seen from the intended  distance, are both tender and masterly. The knight is laid in his mail,  only the hands and face being bare. The hauberk and helmet are of  chain-mail, the armor for the limbs of jointed steel; a tunic, fitting  close to the breast, and marking the noble swell of it by two narrow  embroidered lines, is worn over the mail; his dagger is at his right  side; his long cross-belted sword, not seen by the spectator from below,  at his left. His feet rest on a hound (the hound being his crest), which  looks up towards its master. In general, in tombs of this kind, the face  of the statue is slightly turned towards the spectator; in this  monument, on the contrary, it is turned away from him, towards the depth  of the arch: for there, just above the warrior's breast, is carved a  small image of St. Joseph bearing the infant Christ, who looks down upon  the resting figure; and to this image its countenance is turned. The  appearance of the entire tomb is as if the warrior had seen the vision  of Christ in his dying moments, and had fallen back peacefully upon his  pillow, with his eyes still turned to it, and his hands clasped in  prayer.    Sec. LVIII. On the opposite side of this chapel is another very lovely  tomb, to Duccio degli Alberti, a Florentine ambassador at Venice;  noticeable chiefly as being the first in Venice on which any images of  the Virtues appear. We shall return to it presently, but some account  must first be given of the more important among the other tombs in  Venice belonging to the perfect period. Of these, by far the most  interesting, though not the most elaborate, is that of the great Doge  Francesco Dandolo, whose ashes, it might have been thought, were  honorable enough to have been permitted to rest undisturbed in the  chapter-house of the Frari, where they were first laid. But, as if there  were not room enough, nor waste houses enough in the desolate city to  receive a few convent papers, the monks, wanting an \"archivio,\" have  separated the tomb into three pieces: the canopy, a simple arch  sustained on brackets, still remains on the blank walls of the  desecrated chamber; the sarcophagus has been transported to a kind of  museum of antiquities, established in what was once the cloister of  Santa Maria della Salute; and the painting which filled the lunette  behind it is hung far out of sight, at one end of the sacristy of the  same church. The sarcophagus is completely charged with bas-reliefs: at  its two extremities are the types of St. Mark and St. John; in front, a  noble sculpture of the death of the Virgin; at the angles, angels  holding vases. The whole space is occupied by the sculpture; there are  no spiral shafts or panelled divisions; only a basic plinth below, and  crowning plinth above, the sculpture being raised from a deep concave  field between the two, but, in order to give piquancy and  picturesqueness to the mass of figures, two small trees are introduced  at the head and foot of the Madonna's couch, an oak and a stone pine.    Sec. LIX. It was said above,[17] in speaking of the frequent disputes of  the Venetians with the Pontifical power, which in their early days they  had so strenuously supported, that \"the humiliation of Francesco Dandolo  blotted out the shame of Barbarossa.\" It is indeed well that the two  events should be remembered together. By the help of the Venetians,  Alexander III. was enabled, in the twelfth century, to put his foot upon  the neck of the emperor Barbarossa, quoting the words of the Psalm,  \"Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder.\" A hundred and fifty  years later, the Venetian ambassador, Francesco Dandolo, unable to  obtain even an audience from the Pope, Clement V., to whom he had been  sent to pray for a removal of the sentence of excommunication pronounced  against the republic, concealed himself (according to the common  tradition) beneath the Pontiff's dining-table; and thence coming out as  he sat down to meat, embraced his feet, and obtained, by tearful  entreaties, the removal of the terrible sentence.    I say, \"according to the common tradition;\" for there are some doubts  cast upon the story by its supplement. Most of the Venetian historians  assert that Francesco Dandolo's surname of \"Dog\" was given him first on  this occasion, in insult, by the cardinals; and that the Venetians, in  remembrance of the grace which his humiliation had won for them, made it  a title of honor to him and to his race. It has, however, been  proved[18] that the surname was borne by the ancestors of Francesco  Dandolo long before; and the falsity of this seal of the legend renders  also its circumstances doubtful. But the main fact of grievous  humiliation having been undergone, admits of no dispute; the existence  of such a tradition at all is in itself a proof of its truth; it was not  one likely to be either invented or received without foundation: and it  will be well, therefore, that the reader should remember, in connection  with the treatment of Barbarossa at the door of the Church of St.  Mark's, that in the Vatican, one hundred and fifty years later, a  Venetian noble, a future Doge, submitted to a degradation, of which the  current report among his people was, that he had crept on his hands and  knees from beneath the Pontiff's table to his feet, and had been spurned  as a \"dog\" by the cardinals present.    Sec. LX. There are two principal conclusions to be drawn from this: the  obvious one respecting the insolence of the Papal dominion in the  thirteenth century; the second, that there were probably most deep piety  and humility in the character of the man who could submit to this  insolence for the sake of a benefit to his country. Probably no motive  would have been strong enough to obtain such a sacrifice from most men,  however unselfish; but it was, without doubt, made easier to Dandolo by  his profound reverence for the Pontifical office; a reverence which,  however _we_ may now esteem those who claimed it, could not but have  been felt by nearly all good and faithful men at the time of which we  are speaking. This is the main point which I wish the reader to remember  as we look at his tomb, this, and the result of it,--that, some years  afterwards, when he was seated on the throne which his piety had saved,  \"there were sixty princes' ambassadors in Venice at the same time,  requesting the judgment of the Senate on matters of various concernment,  _so great was the fame of the uncorrupted justice of the Fathers_.\"[19]    Observe, there are no virtues on this tomb. Nothing but religious  history or symbols; the Death of the Virgin in front, and the types of  St. Mark and St. John at the extremities.    Sec. LXI. Of the tomb of the Doge Andrea Dandolo, in St. Mark's, I have  spoken before. It is one of the first in Venice which presents, in a  canopy, the Pisan idea of angels withdrawing curtains, as of a couch, to  look down upon the dead. The sarcophagus is richly decorated with  flower-work; the usual figures of the Annunciation are at the sides; an  enthroned Madonna in the centre; and two bas-reliefs, one of the  martyrdom of the Doge's patron saint, St. Andrew, occupy the  intermediate spaces. All these tombs have been richly colored; the hair  of the angels has here been gilded, their wings bedropped with silver,  and their garments covered with the most exquisite arabesques. This  tomb, and that of St. Isidore in another chapel of St. Mark's, which was  begun by this very Doge, Andrea Dandolo, and completed after his death  in 1354, are both nearly alike in their treatment, and are, on the  whole, the best existing examples of Venetian monumental sculpture.    Sec. LXII. Of much ruder workmanship, though still most precious, and  singularly interesting from its quaintness, is a sarcophagus in the  northernmost chapel, beside the choir of St. John and Paul, charged with  two bas-reliefs and many figures, but which bears no inscription. It  has, however, a shield with three dolphins on its brackets; and as at  the feet of the Madonna in its centre there is a small kneeling figure  of a Doge, we know it to be the tomb of the Doge Giovanni Dolfino, who  came to the throne in 1356.    He was chosen Doge while, as provveditore, he was in Treviso, defending  the city against the King of Hungary. "]]]
