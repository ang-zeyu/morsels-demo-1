Scanlan groaned sympathetically. \"In trouble?\" he asked in a whisper.    \"Deep.\"    \"A penitentiary job?\"    \"And the rest.\"    \"Not a killing!\"    \"It's early days to talk of such things,\" said McMurdo with the air of  a man who had been surprised into saying more than he intended. \"I've  my own good reasons for leaving Chicago, and let that be enough for you.  Who are you that you should take it on yourself to ask such things?\"  His gray eyes gleamed with sudden and dangerous anger from behind his  glasses.    \"All right, mate, no offense meant. The boys will think none the worse  of you, whatever you may have done. Where are you bound for now?\"    \"Vermissa.\"    \"That's the third halt down the line. Where are you staying?\"    McMurdo took out an envelope and held it close to the murky oil lamp.  \"Here is the address--Jacob Shafter, Sheridan Street. It's a boarding  house that was recommended by a man I knew in Chicago.\"    \"Well, I don't know it; but Vermissa is out of my beat. I live at  Hobson's Patch, and that's here where we are drawing up. But, say,  there's one bit of advice I'll give you before we part: If you're  in trouble in Vermissa, go straight to the Union House and see Boss  McGinty. He is the Bodymaster of Vermissa Lodge, and nothing can happen  in these parts unless Black Jack McGinty wants it. So long, mate! Maybe  we'll meet in lodge one of these evenings. But mind my words: If you are  in trouble, go to Boss McGinty.\"    Scanlan descended, and McMurdo was left once again to his thoughts.  Night had now fallen, and the flames of the frequent furnaces were  roaring and leaping in the darkness. Against their lurid background  dark figures were bending and straining, twisting and turning, with the  motion of winch or of windlass, to the rhythm of an eternal clank and  roar.    \"I guess hell must look something like that,\" said a voice.    McMurdo turned and saw that one of the policemen had shifted in his seat  and was staring out into the fiery waste.    \"For that matter,\" said the other policeman, \"I allow that hell must BE  something like that. If there are worse devils down yonder than some we  could name, it's more than I'd expect. I guess you are new to this part,  young man?\"    \"Well, what if I am?\" McMurdo answered in a surly voice.    \"Just this, mister, that I should advise you to be careful in choosing  your friends. I don't think I'd begin with Mike Scanlan or his gang if I  were you.\"    \"What the hell is it to you who are my friends?\" roared McMurdo in a  voice which brought every head in the carriage round to witness the  altercation. \"Did I ask you for your advice, or did you think me such  a sucker that I couldn't move without it? You speak when you are spoken  to, and by the Lord you'd have to wait a long time if it was me!\" He  thrust out his face and grinned at the patrolmen like a snarling dog.    The two policemen, heavy, good-natured men, were taken aback by the  extraordinary vehemence with which their friendly advances had been  rejected.    \"No offense, stranger,\" said one. \"It was a warning for your own good,  seeing that you are, by your own showing, new to the place.\"    \"I'm new to the place; but I'm not new to you and your kind!\" cried  McMurdo in cold fury. \"I guess you're the same in all places, shoving  your advice in when nobody asks for it.\"    \"Maybe we'll see more of you before very long,\" said one of the  patrolmen with a grin. \"You're a real hand-picked one, if I am a judge.\"    \"I was thinking the same,\" remarked the other. \"I guess we may meet  again.\"    \"I'm not afraid of you, and don't you think it!\" cried McMurdo. \"My  name's Jack McMurdo--see? If you want me, you'll find me at Jacob  Shafter's on Sheridan Street, Vermissa; so I'm not hiding from you, am  I? Day or night I dare to look the like of you in the face--don't make  any mistake about that!\"    There was a murmur of sympathy and admiration from the miners at the  dauntless demeanour of the newcomer, while the two policemen shrugged  their shoulders and renewed a conversation between themselves.    A few minutes later the train ran into the ill-lit station, and there  was a general clearing; for Vermissa was by far the largest town on the  line. McMurdo picked up his leather gripsack and was about to start off  into the darkness, when one of the miners accosted him.    \"By Gar, mate! you know how to speak to the cops,\" he said in a voice of  awe. \"It was grand to hear you. Let me carry your grip and show you the  road. I'm passing Shafter's on the way to my own shack.\"    There was a chorus of friendly \"Good-nights\" from the other miners  as they passed from the platform. Before ever he had set foot in it,  McMurdo the turbulent had become a character in Vermissa.    The country had been a place of terror; but the town was in its way  even more depressing. Down that long valley there was at least a certain  gloomy grandeur in the huge fires and the clouds of drifting smoke,  while the strength and industry of man found fitting monuments in the  hills which he had spilled by the side of his monstrous excavations.  But the town showed a dead level of mean ugliness and squalor. The broad  street was churned up by the traffic into a horrible rutted paste of  muddy snow. The sidewalks were narrow and uneven. The numerous gas-lamps  served only to show more clearly a long line of wooden houses, each with  its veranda facing the street, unkempt and dirty.    As they approached the centre of the town the scene was brightened by a  row of well-lit stores, and even more by a cluster of saloons and gaming  houses, in which the miners spent their hard-earned but generous wages.    \"That's the Union House,\" said the guide, pointing to one saloon which  rose almost to the dignity of being a hotel. \"Jack McGinty is the boss  there.\"    \"What sort of a man is he?\" McMurdo asked.    \"What! have you never heard of the boss?\"    \"How could I have heard of him when you know that I am a stranger in  these parts?\"    \"Well, I thought his name was known clear across the country. It's been  in the papers often enough.\"    \"What for?\"    \"Well,\" the miner lowered his voice--\"over the affairs.\"    \"What affairs?\"    \"Good Lord, mister! you are queer, if I must say it without offense.  There's only one set of affairs that you'll hear of in these parts, and  that's the affairs of the Scowrers.\"    \"Why, I seem to have read of the Scowrers in Chicago. A gang of  murderers, are they not?\"    \"Hush, on your life!\" cried the miner, standing still in alarm, and  gazing in amazement at his companion. \"Man, you won't live long in these  parts if you speak in the open street like that. Many a man has had the  life beaten out of him for less.\"    \"Well, I know nothing about them. It's only what I have read.\"    \"And I'm not saying that you have not read the truth.\" The man looked  nervously round him as he spoke, peering into the shadows as if he  feared to see some lurking danger. \"If killing is murder, then God knows  there is murder and to spare. But don't you dare to breathe the name  of Jack McGinty in connection with it, stranger; for every whisper  goes back to him, and he is not one that is likely to let it pass. Now,  that's the house you're after, that one standing back from the street.  You'll find old Jacob Shafter that runs it as honest a man as lives in  this township.\"    \"I thank you,\" said McMurdo, and shaking hands with his new acquaintance  he plodded, gripsack in hand, up the path which led to the dwelling  house, at the door of which he gave a resounding knock.    It was opened at once by someone very different from what he had  expected. It was a woman, young and singularly beautiful. She was of the  German type, blonde and fair-haired, with the piquant contrast of a  pair of beautiful dark eyes with which she surveyed the stranger with  surprise and a pleasing embarrassment which brought a wave of colour  over her pale face. Framed in the bright light of the open doorway, it  seemed to McMurdo that he had never seen a more beautiful picture;  the more attractive for its contrast with the sordid and gloomy  surroundings. A lovely violet growing upon one of those black slag-heaps  of the mines would not have seemed more surprising. So entranced was  he that he stood staring without a word, and it was she who broke the  silence.    \"I thought it was father,\" said she with a pleasing little touch of a  German accent. \"Did you come to see him? He is down town. I expect him  back every minute.\"    McMurdo continued to gaze at her in open admiration until her eyes  dropped in confusion before this masterful visitor.    \"No, miss,\" he said at last, \"I'm in no hurry to see him. But your house  was recommended to me for board. I thought it might suit me--and now I  know it will.\"    \"You are quick to make up your mind,\" said she with a smile.    \"Anyone but a blind man could do as much,\" the other answered.    She laughed at the compliment. \"Come right in, sir,\" she said. \"I'm Miss  Ettie Shafter, Mr. Shafter's daughter. My mother's dead, and I run the  house. You can sit down by the stove in the front room until father  comes along--Ah, here he is! So you can fix things with him right away.\"    A heavy, elderly man came plodding up the path. In a few words McMurdo  explained his business. A man of the name of Murphy had given him the  address in Chicago. He in turn had had it from someone else. Old Shafter  was quite ready. The stranger made no bones about terms, agreed at once  to every condition, and was apparently fairly flush of money. For seven  dollars a week paid in advance he was to have board and lodging.    So it was that McMurdo, the self-confessed fugitive from justice, took  up his abode under the roof of the Shafters, the first step which was  to lead to so long and dark a train of events, ending in a far"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3291"],[0,"John Marshall and the Constitution, a Chronicle of the Supreme Court (#17)"],[1,"novel. In the  \"Federalist\" itself Hamilton had boldly asked, \"Who is to judge of  the necessity and propriety of the laws to be passed for executing the  powers of the Union?\" and had announced that \"the National Government,  like every other, must judge in the first instance, of the proper  exercise of its powers, and its constituents in the last,\" a view which  seems hardly to leave room even for judicial control. Three years later  as Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton had brought forward the proposal  which soon led to the chartering of the Bank of 1791. The measure  precipitated the first great discussion over the interpretation of  the new Constitution. Hamilton owned that Congress had no specifically  granted power to charter a bank but contended that such an institution  was a \"necessary and proper\" means for carrying out certain of the  enumerated powers of the National Government such, for instance,  as borrowing money and issuing a currency. For, said he in effect,  \"necessary and proper\" signify \"convenient,\" and the clause was intended  to indicate that the National Government should enjoy a wide range of  choice in the selection of means for carrying out its enumerated powers.  Jefferson, on the other hand, maintained that the \"necessary and proper\"  clause was a restrictive clause, meant to safeguard the rights of the  States, that a law in order to be \"necessary and proper\" must be both  \"necessary\" AND \"proper,\" and that both terms ought to be construed  narrowly. Jefferson's opposition, however, proved unavailing, and the  banking institution which was created continued till 1811 without its  validity being once tested in the courts.    The second Bank of the United States, whose branch Maryland was now  trying to tax, received its charter in 1816 from President Madison.  Well might John Quincy Adams exclaim that the \"Republicans had  out-federalized the Federalists!\" Yet the gibe was premature.  The country at large was as yet blind to the responsibilities of  nationality. That vision of national unity which indubitably underlies  the Constitution was after all the vision of an aristocracy conscious of  a solidarity of interests transcending state lines. It is equally true  that until the Civil War, at the earliest, the great mass of Americans  still felt themselves to be first of all citizens of their particular  States. Nor did this individualistic bias long remain in want of  leadership capable of giving it articulate expression. The amount of  political talent which existed within the State of Virginia alone in the  first generation of our national history is amazing to contemplate,  but this talent unfortunately exhibited one most damaging blemish. The  intense individualism of the planter-aristocrat could not tolerate in  any possible situation the idea of a control which he could not himself  ultimately either direct or reject. In the Virginia and Kentucky  resolutions of 1798 and 1799, which regard the Constitution as a compact  of sovereign States and the National Government merely as their agent,  the particularistic outlook definitely received a constitutional creed  which in time was to become, at least in the South, a gloss upon  the Constitution regarded as fully as authoritative as the original  instrument. This recognition of state sovereignty was, indeed, somewhat  delayed by the federalization of the Republican party in consequence of  the capture of the National Government by Virginia in 1800. But in  1819 the march toward dissolution and civil war which had begun at the  summons of Jefferson was now definitely resumed. This was the year of  the congressional struggle over the admission of Missouri, the most  important result of which was the discovery by the slave owners that the  greatest security of slavery lay in the powers of the States and that  its greatest danger lay in those of the National Government. Henceforth  the largest property interest of the country stood almost solidly behind  State Rights.    It was at this critical moment that chance presented Marshall with the  opportunity to place the opposing doctrine of nationalism on the high  plane of judicial decision. The arguments in the Bank case * which  began on February 22,1819, and lasted nine days, brought together a  \"constellation of lawyers\" such as had never appeared before in a single  case. The Bank was represented by Pinkney, Webster, and Wirt; the  State, by Luther Martin, Hopkinson, and Walter Jones of the District of  Columbia bar. In arguing for the State, Hopkinson urged the restrictive  view of the \"necessary and proper\" clause and sought to reduce to  an absurdity the doctrine of \"implied rights.\" The Bank, continued  Hopkinson, \"this creature of construction,\" claims by further  implication \"the right to enter the territory of a State without  its consent\" and to establish there a branch; then, by yet another  implication, the branch claims exemption from taxation. \"It is thus with  the famous figtree of India, whose branches shoot from the trunk to a  considerable distance, then drop to the earth, where they take root and  become trees from which also other branches shoot..., until gradually  a vast surface is covered, and everything perishes in the spreading  shade.\" But even granting that Congress did have the right to charter  the Bank, still that fact would not exempt the institution from taxation  by any State within which it held property. \"The exercise of the one  sovereign power cannot be controlled by the exercise of the other.\"       * M'Culloch vs. Maryland (1819), 4 Wheaton, 316.      On the other side, Pinkney made the chief argument in behalf of the  Bank. \"Mr. Pinkney,\" says Justice Story, \"rose on Monday to conclude the  argument; he spoke all that day and yesterday and will probably conclude  to-day. I never in my whole life heard a greater speech; it was worth a  journey from Salem to hear it; his elocution was excessively vehement;  but his eloquence was overwhelming. His language, his style, his  figures, his argument, were most brilliant and sparkling. He spoke like  a great statesman and patriot and a sound constitutional lawyer. All the  cobwebs of sophistryship and metaphysics about State Rights and State  Sovereignty he brushed away with a mighty besom.\"    Pinkney closed on the 3d of March, and on the 6th Marshall handed down  his most famous opinion. He condensed Pinkney's three-day argument into  a pamphlet which may be easily read by the instructed layman in half  an hour, for, as is invariably the case with Marshall, his condensation  made for greater clarity. In this opinion he also gives evidence,  in their highest form, of his other notable qualities as a judicial  stylist: his \"tiger instinct for the jugular vein\"; his rigorous pursuit  of logical consequences; his power of stating a case, wherein he is  rivaled only by Mansfield; his scorn of the qualifying \"buys,\" \"if's,\"  and \"though's\"; the pith and balance of his phrasing, a reminiscence of  his early days with Pope; the developing momentum of his argument; above  all, his audacious use of the obiter dictum. Marshall's later opinion  in Gibbons vs. Ogden is, it is true, in some respects a greater  intellectual performance, but it does not equal this earlier opinion  in those qualities of form which attract the amateur and stir the  admiration of posterity.    At the very outset of his argument in the Bank case Marshall singled out  the question the answer to which must control all interpretation of  the Constitution: Was the Constitution, as contended by counsel for  Maryland, \"an act of sovereign and independent States\" whose political  interests must be jealously safeguarded in its construction, or, was it  an emanation from the American people and designed for their benefit?  Marshall answered that the Constitution, by its own declaration, was  \"ordained and established\" in the name of the people, \"in order to form  a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity,  and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity.\"  Nor did he consider the argument \"that the people had already  surrendered all their powers to the State Sovereignties and had nothing  more to give,\" a persuasive one, for \"surely, the question whether  they may resume and modify the power granted to the government does not  remain to be settled in this country. Much more might the legitimacy of  the General Government be doubted, had it been created by the States.  The powers delegated to the State sovereignties were to be exercised  by themselves, not by a distinct and independent sovereignty created  by them.\" \"The Government of the Union, then,\" Marshall proceeded, \"is  emphatically... a government of the people. In form and in substance  it emanates from them. Its powers are granted by them, and are to be  exercised on them, and for their benefit.\" And what was the nature of  this Government? \"If any one proposition could command the universal  assent of mankind we might expect it would be this: that the government  of the Union, though limited in its powers, is supreme within the sphere  of its action. This would seem to result necessarily from its nature. It  is the government of all; its powers are delegated by all; it represents  all and acts for all.\" However the question had not been left to  reason. \"The people have in express terms decided it by saying: 'This  Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in  pursuance thereof... shall be the supreme Law of the Land.'\"    But a Government which is supreme must have the right to choose the  means by which to make its supremacy effective; and indeed, at this  point again the Constitution comes to the aid of reason by declaring  specifically that Congress may make all laws \"necessary and proper\" for  carrying into execution any of the powers of the General Government.
