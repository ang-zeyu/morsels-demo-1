The substance of all that has been advanced is this: the Holy Scripture  bears _outward_ testimony to those things, which are to be _inwardly_  fulfilled in man, by faith. It points out that image externally, which, by  faith, is to be formed within him. It describes the kingdom of God in the  _letter_, which is to be established in the heart, by faith, after the  _spirit_. It exhibits Christ outwardly, who is, by faith, to live within  me; and it testifies of the new birth and of the new creature, which I  must experience in myself. All this I am to be made by faith, or the  Scripture will profit me nothing.          Chapter VII.       The Law Of God, Written In The Hearts Of All Men, Convinces Them That On               The Day Of Judgment They Will Be Without Excuse.          _When the Gentiles ... do the things contained in the law ... they      shew the work of the law written in their hearts._--ROM. 2:14, 15.      When God created man in his own image, in righteousness and holiness, and  endowed him with exalted virtues and gifts, he impressed three qualities  on the human conscience so deeply, that they can never be effaced: First,  the natural testimony that there is a God. Secondly, a testimony that a  day of Judgment will come. Rom. 2:15. Thirdly, the law of nature, or  natural righteousness, by which man is enabled to distinguish between  honor and shame, and to experience joy and sorrow.    2. For no nation has ever been discovered so wild and barbarous, as to  deny that a God exists, inasmuch as nature furnishes internal and external  evidence of this fact. Indeed, men have not only acknowledged the _being_  of a God, of which they were assured by their consciences; but they have  also been affected with a sense of his _justice_, as an avenger of evil,  and a rewarder of good; and this persuasion arose from the consciousness,  that, on some occasions, they were harassed with fearful apprehensions;  while, on others, they felt a certain measure of peace and joy. By this  knowledge, they even proceeded farther, and discovered the doctrine of the  immortality of the soul, as appears from Plato, who most amply discussed  this subject. And, lastly, they gathered from this inward law, that God  was the author and source of all that was _good_ in nature, and therefore  ought to be worshipped by an assiduous attention to virtue, and with a  pure heart. Hence, they defined virtue to be man's chief good; and schools  of moral virtue were accordingly instituted by Socrates, and by other  heathen philosophers. This may be sufficient to convince us, that God,  even since the fall, has allowed a spark of natural light to remain in  men, in order that they might be admonished of their heavenly origin, and  be assured, that it was only by following these footsteps of divinity,  that they could be restored to their former perfection. Some of the  heathens themselves, have not been unacquainted with this truth; among  whom is Aratus, the poet, quoted by St. Paul, who declares that \"we are  God's offspring.\" Acts 17:28.    3. The Gentiles, however, stifling the testimony of conscience, contemned  the light of nature, and \"the work of the law written in their hearts\"  (Rom. 2:15); so that it cannot but be their own fault, that they are  condemned and lost; and they are, as St. Paul argues, left altogether  without excuse. Rom. 1:19, 20. And as the Gentiles knew, by nature, the  justice of God, and that such as did evil were worthy of death; and yet  not only committed evil but had pleasure in it; it follows, that they  thereby condemned themselves, whilst \"their thoughts accusing or excusing  one another,\" convinced them of the certainty of the day of judgment. Rom.  1:32; 2:15. But if the _Gentiles_ shall be \"inexcusable,\" because, though  endued with the natural knowledge of God, they sought him not, as was  their duty; what shall _they_ plead in their own behalf, to whom God hath  given his Holy Word, and whom he hath so earnestly invited to repentance,  by Jesus Christ his beloved Son; in order that, forsaking the corruptions  of the world, they might, by faith, apprehend the merits of the Saviour,  and obtain eternal life and salvation?    4. Therefore, every false Christian shall, in the day of judgment, be  condemned by two mighty witnesses: by his own conscience or the law of  nature, and likewise by the revealed Word of God, which will then judge  him. In that day, \"it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom,\" than  for such false pretenders to religion. Matt. 11:24.    5. Their anguish and torment shall be without end; since God has made the  soul immortal and planted the conscience in it, to be both a witness and a  judge. The conscience can never throw off the recollection of God, and yet  cannot of itself approach him; which must be attended with unutterable  pain to the soul, and expose it to the worm that dieth not, and to the  fire that cannot be quenched. And the more the wicked have, through  impenitence of heart, treasured up to themselves \"wrath against the day of  wrath\" (Rom. 2:5), the more severe will this inward and eternal suffering  be. For as God, in the exercise of his righteous judgment, gave up the  Gentiles to a reprobate mind, because they sinned against their own  consciences, and \"the work of the law written in their hearts;\" so that  they became blind in their understandings, and rushed into every kind of  filthy and abominable pollution; thus drawing down upon themselves the  wrath of God, denounced against all crimes that are committed against the  light of knowledge: so the same doom (yea, and a far heavier one) will be  inflicted upon those who rest in the mere profession of the Christian  faith, and deny the life and the power of godliness. The reason of this is  obvious: such persons have contemned the inward as well as the outward  word and testimony of God, and have not only persevered in a state of  impenitence, but have resisted the Divine Spirit, and blasphemed Him who  favored them with the light of his Gospel. On this account, God gives them  up to a reprobate mind, so that they become worse than heathens and  infidels. He sends them \"strong delusion, that they should believe a lie;  that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure  in unrighteousness.\" 2 Thess. 2:11, 12.    6. This is the true reason why vices of so detestable a nature universally  abound among Christians; many of which were not so much as known among the  Pagan nations. What satanical pride, what insatiable covetousness, what  unheard-of intemperance, what bestial lust; in a word, what inhuman  wickedness, is not practised by those who call themselves Christians! And  whence does all this arise, but from that blindness and hardness of heart,  which they have contracted by confirmed habits of iniquity. When those who  are called Christians disdain to imitate the meek and lowly Jesus in their  manners and their conversation; when they are scandalized at him, and  consider it disgraceful to look to him whom God has appointed to be the  light of the world, and our great example (John 8:12); then the righteous  God gives them up to follow Satan; to take upon them the life of the  devil, his abominable impiety, wickedness, and lies; that they may execute  with him all the works of darkness, inasmuch as they refuse to walk in the  light. For thus saith the Lord, \"Walk while ye have the light, lest  darkness come upon you.\" John 12:35.    7. Finally, if God gave up the heathen to so terrible a blindness and so  reprobate a mind; and this because they proved disobedient to the  glimmering light of nature; or, as St. Paul expresses it, \"because they  did not like to retain God in their knowledge,\" in order to be preserved  by him (Rom. 1:28); how much more shall those be banished from life and  salvation, to whom the truth of God has come not only by natural light,  but by means of his revealed word, and the new covenant, and who yet  haughtily despise these special tenders of divine mercy! Of which new  covenant, God thus speaks: \"I will put my law in their inward parts, and  write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my  people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man  his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for they shall all know me, from the  least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord; for I will  forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.\" Jer.  31:33, 34; John 6:45.    8. And here, let us also attend to that which the Apostle says, concerning  those who offend wilfully. \"If,\" says he, \"we sin wilfully, after that we  have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more  sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and  fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. He that despised  Moses' law,\" continues the Apostle, \"died without mercy under two or three  witnesses; of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought  worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the  blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and  hath done despite unto the spirit of grace? For we know him that hath  said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. It  is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.\" Heb.  10:26-31. These words, however, are not pronounced in reference to those  who fall through natural infirmity, but against them who sin wilfully and  against knowledge, and who persevere to the end in a state of impenitence.          Chapter VIII.         No One Can Find Comfort In Christ And His Merits, Who Does Not Truly                                   Repent.          _No unclean person was permitted to eat of the passover._--EXOD.      12:48.      It was the declaration of the Lord Jesus Christ, \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34781"],[0,"An Australian Bird Book: A Pocket Book for Field Use (#17)"],[1,"in ambush, suddenly flashes out upon his prey, and is away  with it instantly. The male is one of the smallest of Hawks. It is  an almost universal rule in this order of birds that the females are  larger, often much larger, than the males, and that there are several  changes of plumage before the adult plumage is finally donned, so it  is often a matter of difficulty to determine exactly the name of one  of these birds.    Eagles are found the world over except in New Zealand. Our Eagle has  the honor of being, as already stated, the largest Eagle in the world.  It is also of undoubted courage, as its specific name, _audax_ (bold)  would lead one to suppose. It is, further, Gould says, of a \"far more  pleasing and elegant contour\" than the Golden Eagle, the \"pride and  pest of the parish.\" Whoever heard of an Australian who was proud of  his Eagle, though it is something to be proud of? Let our noble bird  appear near a house, and there is a rush for a gun. On Eyre Peninsula  we found the Eagles fed their young on rabbits, a serious pest in  Australia.    The equivalent of our Sea Eagle is the White-headed or Bald Eagle of  America, the female of which is the same length as the male of our  Eagle, 38 inches. Many of these glorious Sea Eagles were floating,  with their peculiar butterfly-like flight, over the Brisbane River,  and added much to our enjoyment of a recent bird excursion there. We  found one nest on each island in the Capricorn Group. On Mast Head  Island the nest was in a tree about 60 feet high. On tiny Erskine  Island, where there were no big trees, it was built on the ground,  though it had been added to until it is now over 6 feet high. The  fully-feathered dark-brown young bird sat on the edge of the nest, and  formed a good photographic subject. Eagles were ruthlessly slaughtered  in the British Isles. There is a shadow of an excuse there, perhaps,  with their game preserves, where rabbits and birds are bred for  sporting purposes. These reasons do not exist here. But it is pleasing  to find on record that, even there, \"Lord Breadalbane, who died in  1862, thought that the spectacle of a soaring Eagle was a fitting  adjunct to the grandeur of the Argyllshire mountain scenery, and a  good equivalent for the occasional loss of a lamb.\"    Though the Sea Eagle lives mainly on fish and refuse cast up by the  sea, it is pitiful to read that, though this interesting, picturesque,  and valuable bird was once common, not one is left on the mainland  of Scotland. Could blind, unreasoning slaughter do more? Why kill a  harmless bird? But it is not only harmless; it is of distinct value  in its sphere in Nature. Hawks altogether are misunderstood and  misjudged. It is doubtful if it pays a farmer, aye, even a poultry  farmer, to shoot Hawks. They might steal a few chickens, but they  do not live on them. They live mainly on rabbits, mice, rats, and  insects.    The Whistling Eagle whistles while flying about in the fine large  flight-houses of the Adelaide Zoological Gardens. One fine specimen  accompanied the Federal trawler _Endeavour_ down Gladstone Harbor, but  not far from shore, for it returned when we headed for the open ocean  and the fairyland of the Great Barrier Reef.    Kites used to be excessively common about many English towns, where  they acted as scavengers. The introduction of the shot-gun has  exterminated them. They are world-wide in distribution, so what  you read about European Kites will fit Australian Kites. They are,  perhaps, the most graceful of flyers, gliding, soaring, hovering,  and performing all sorts of aerial evolutions. The toy kites of our  childhood were suggested by the flight of these once common birds.  Now, alas! they are very rarely seen. Being mainly insectivorous, they  are invaluable birds, and we can ill spare them in this country, where  insect life is so abnormally prolific.    The Black-breasted Buzzard is the third largest of our Diurnal Birds  of Prey. It is a rare visitor in Southern Australia, but in seasons of  drought it comes down from Central Australia.    The Falcon, which our ancestors trained for hawking, is almost  identical with our Falcon, while our Little Falcon is, for its size,  the \"boldest and swiftest of all birds of prey,\" for it has been  observed to decapitate a flying Duck with a blow of the edge of its  wing. In Brisbane we had the pleasure of spending an interesting  afternoon with Mr. J. Bell, who formerly practised falconry with  trained Australian Falcons.    The Kestrel of Australia is almost identical with the Kestrel of  Europe. You must have noticed with interest its habit of hovering. One  incident of the 1909 Ornithologists' Congress will show that, even  in the midst of a crowded city like Adelaide, it is possible for  scientific work in ornithology to be done. While the Director of  Education, Mr. A. Williams, Mr. Le Souef (ex-Pres., A.O.U.), Mr. A.  J. Campbell (Pres., A.O.U.), Mr. Robert Hall (Vice-Pres., A.O.U.), and  myself were walking from the Education Office to Grote Street School,  a Kestrel was seen on the grass in a small square. The members of  the party were astonished to see the Kestrel rise carrying a  bird, possibly a Sparrow, in its talons. Now, the interest of this  observation is that most of our ornithologists were prepared to state  that the Kestrel is entirely insectivorous, and never touches small  birds. However, an observation in the heart of Adelaide is of value  in this matter of scientific interest. This bird, unfortunately,  is generally called the Sparrowhawk, a name which belongs to a much  bolder Australian bird of prey (No. 157), which does eat small birds.    Kestrels are very fond of mice, and would, if allowed, spend time  protecting the farmer's haystacks, but if a Kestrel comes near the  farmhouse the gun is at once produced, and so the farmer loses the  services of one of his best friends.    Jeffries and other Nature-lovers have written on the marvellous  powers of hovering possessed by these birds. In fact, the Kestrel is  frequently called the Windhover. In Australia Kestrels frequently nest  in a hollow tree, but do not lay the usual white egg.    The Osprey is another example of bad naming. The word is said to be a  corruption of Ossifrage, the \"bone-breaker.\" As it feeds on fish,  it has no big bones to break. It is spread from \"Alaska to Brazil,  Lapland to Natal, Japan to Tasmania, and even out to the Pacific  Isles,\" and it may be the same bird throughout, though Dr. Sharpe  has allowed three species in the \"_Handlist of Birds_.\" \"_The A.O.U.  Check-list of North American Birds_, 1910,\" however, recognizes the  North American bird as a sub-species only, so it is possible the  Australian bird will be also listed as a sub-species when the Royal  Australasian Ornithologists' Union adopts its check-list in Sydney  this year. These birds eat living fish, which they catch by plunging  into the sea. Occasionally they drive their talons into too big a  fish, and, not being able to withdraw them, are drowned.    Flinders, in his journal, wrote about the enormous nests he met on  rocky points, and considered they were built by a great \"Dinornis.\"    The Osprey and the White-bellied Sea Eagle, however, build on rocky  points if no trees are available, and add to the nest each year. It  is interesting to read in the Western Australian Year Book article  on birds that the Government has placed an Osprey's nest in the  cave district, \"under the protection of the Cave Warden.\" A pleasing  interest is growing in Australian nature in its many forms.    ====      [Page 72]      [Illustration: [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] [156]]        ORDER XV.--ACCIPITRIFORMES, DIURNAL BIRDS OF PREY.
