As to the tale called \"The Naughty Boy,\" that, it is true, is an old  story. The poet Anacreon wrote it long, long ago; but Andersen has  here re-told it in so humorous a manner, that it will no doubt amuse  you as much as though it had been written originally by him. He has  given the whole, too, quite another dress; and \"the naughty boy\"  himself he has tricked out so drolly, and related such amusing tricks  of him, that I think Mr. Andersen had better take care the young rogue  does not play him a sly turn some day or other, for the little  incorrigible rascal respects nobody.    Before I say farewell, there is one thing I must tell you; which is,  there are two persons you certainly little think of, to whom you owe  some thanks for the pretty tales of Anderson that have so greatly  delighted you, as well as for those he may still write. You will never  guess who they are, so I will tell you. They are Frederick VI., the  late, and Christian VIII., the present King of Denmark. The former  gave Andersen a pension to relieve him from the necessity of depending  on his pen for bread; so that, free from cares, he was able to pursue  his own varied fancies. Though not much, it was sufficient; but the  present king, who has always been most kind to your friend  Andersen--for so you surely consider him--increased his pension  considerably, in order that, he might be able to travel, and follow in  full liberty the bent of his genius.    Now do you not like a king who thus holds out his hand to genius, who  delights to honor the man who has done honor to their common country,  and who is proud to interest himself in his fate as in that of a  friend? And this King Christian VIII. does. Am I not right, then, in  saying that you owe him your thanks?    Farewell, my little friends, and believe that I am always ready and  willing to serve you.

We had hoped at least to reach Vernoye, a provincial capital near the  converging point of the Turkestan, Siberian, and Chinese boundaries,  whence we could continue, on the opening of the following spring, either  through Siberia or across the Chinese empire. But in this we were doomed  to disappointment. The delay on the part of the Russian authorities in  granting us permission to enter Transcaspia had postponed at least a month  our arrival in Tashkend, and now, owing to the early advent of the rainy  season, the roads leading north were almost impassable even for the native  carts. This fact, together with the reports of heavy snowfalls beyond the  Alexandrovski mountains, on the road to Vernoye, lent a rather cogent  influence to the persuasions of our friends to spend the winter among  them.      [Illustration: A RELIGIOUS DRAMA IN SAMARKAND.]    Then, too, such a plan, we thought, might not be unproductive of future  advantages. Thus far we had been journeying through Russian territory  without a passport. We had no authorization except the telegram to \"come  on,\" received from General Kuropatkine at Askabad, and the verbal  permission of Count Rosterzsoff at Samarkand to proceed to Tashkend.  Furthermore, the passport for which we had just applied to Baron Wrevsky,  the Governor-General of Turkestan, would be available only as far as the  border of Siberia, where we should have to apply to the various  governors-general along our course to the Pacific, in case we should find  the route across the Chinese empire impracticable. A general permission to  travel from Tashkend to the Pacific coast, through southern Siberia, could  be obtained from St. Petersburg only, and that only through the chief  executive of the province through which we were passing.    Permission to enter Turkestan is by no means easily obtained, as is well  understood by the student of Russian policy in central Asia. We were not a  little surprised, therefore, when our request to spend the winter in its  capital was graciously granted by Baron Wrevsky, as well as the privilege  for one of us to return in the mean time to London. This we had determined  on, in order to secure some much-needed bicycle supplies, and to complete  other arrangements for the success of our enterprise. By lot the return  trip fell to Sachtleben. Proceeding by the Transcaspian and Transcaucasus  railroads, the Caspian and Black seas, to Constantinople, and thence by  the \"overland express\" to Belgrade, Vienna, Frankfort, and Calais, he was  able to reach London in sixteen days.    Tashkend, though nearly in the same latitude as New York, is so protected  by the Alexandrovski mountains from the Siberian blizzards and the  scorching winds of the Kara-Kum desert as to have an even more moderate  climate. A tributary of the Tchirtchick river forms the line of  demarcation between the native and the European portions of the city,  although the population of the latter is by no means devoid of a native  element. Both together cover an area as extensive as Paris, though the  population is only 120,000, of which 100,000 are congregated in the  native, or Sart, quarter. There is a floating element of Kashgarians,  Bokhariots, Persians, and Afghans, and a resident majority of Kirghiz,  Tatars, Jews, Hindus, gypsies, and Sarts, the latter being a generic title  for the urban, as distinguished from the nomad, people.      [Illustration: OUR FERRY OVER THE ZERAFSHAN.]    Our winter quarters were obtained at the home of a typical Russian family,  in company with a young reserve officer. He, having finished his  university career and time of military service, was engaged in Tashkend in  the interest of his father, a wholesale merchant in Moscow. With him we  were able to converse either in French or German, both of which languages  he could speak more purely than his native Russian. Our good-natured,  corpulent host had emigrated, in the pioneer days, from the steppes of  southern Russia, and had grown wealthy through the \"unearned increment.\"    The Russian samovar is the characteristic feature of the Russian  household. Besides a big bowl of cabbage soup at every meal, our Russian  host would start in with a half-tumbler of vodka, dispose of a bottle of  beer in the intervals, and then top off with two or three glasses of tea.  The mistress of the household, being limited in her beverages to tea and  soup, would usually make up in quantity what was lacking in variety. In  fact, one day she informed us that she had not imbibed a drop of water for  over six years. For this, however, there is a very plausible excuse. With  the water at Tashkend, as with that from the Zerafshan at Bokhara, a  dangerous worm called _reshta_ is absorbed into the system. Nowhere have  we drunk better tea than around the steaming samovar of our Tashkend host.  No peasant is too poor, either in money or in sentiment, to buy and feel  the cheering influence of tea. Even the Cossack, in his forays into the  wilds of central Asia, is sustained by it. Unlike the Chinese, the  Russians consider sugar a necessary concomitant of tea-drinking. There are  three methods of sweetening tea: to put the sugar in the glass; to place a  lump of sugar in the mouth, and suck the tea through it; to hang a lump in  the midst of a tea-drinking circle, to be swung around for each in turn to  touch with his tongue, and then to take a swallow of tea.    The meaning of the name Tashkend is \"city of stone,\" but a majority of the  houses are one-story mud structures, built low, so as to prevent any  disastrous effects from earthquakes. The roofs are so flat and poorly  constructed that during the rainy season a dry ceiling is rather the  exception than the rule. Every building is covered with whitewash or white  paint, and fronts directly on the street. There are plenty of back and  side yards, but none in front. This is not so bad on the broad streets of  a Russian town. In Tashkend they are exceptionally wide, with ditches on  each side through which the water from the Tchirtchick ripples along  beneath the double, and even quadruple, rows of poplars, acacias, and  willows. These trees grow here with remarkable luxuriance, from a mere  twig stuck into the ground. Although twenty years of Russian irrigation  has given Nature a chance to rear thousands of trees on former barren  wastes, yet wood is still comparatively scarce and dear.    The administration buildings of the city are for the most part exceedingly  plain and unpretentious. In striking contrast is the new Russian  cathedral, the recently erected school, and a large retail store built by  a resident Greek, all of which are fine specimens of Russian architecture.  Among its institutions are an observatory, a museum containing an embryo  collection of Turkestan products and antiquities, and a medical dispensary  for the natives, where vaccination is performed by graduates of medicine  in the Tashkend school. The rather extensive library was originally  collected for the chancellery of the governor-general, and contains the  best collection of works on central Asia that is to be found in the world,  including in its scope not only books and pamphlets, but even magazines  and newspaper articles. For amusements, the city has a theater, a small  imitation of the opera-house at Paris; and the Military Club, which, with  its billiards and gambling, and weekly reunions, balls, and concerts,  though a regular feature of a Russian garrison town, is especially  pretentious in Tashkend. In size, architecture, and appointments, the  club-house has no equal, we were told, outside the capital and Moscow.      [Illustration: PALACE OF THE CZAR'S NEPHEW, TASHKEND.]    Tashkend has long been known as a refuge for damaged reputations and  shattered fortunes, or \"the official purgatory following upon the  emperor's displeasure.\" One of the finest houses of the city is occupied  by the Grand Duke Nicholai Constantinovitch Romanoff, son of the late  general admiral of the Russian navy, and first cousin to the Czar, who  seems to be cheerfully resigned to his life in exile. Most of his time is  occupied with the business of his silk-factory on the outskirts of  Tashkend, and at his farm near Hodjent, which a certain firm in Chicago,  at the time of our sojourn, was stocking with irrigating machinery. All of  his bills are paid with checks drawn on his St. Petersburg trustees. His  private life is rather unconventional and even democratic. Visitors to his  household are particularly impressed with the beauty of his wife and the  size of his liquor glasses. The example of the grand duke illustrates the  sentiment in favor of industrial pursuits which is growing among the  military classes, and even among the nobility, of Russia. The government  itself, thanks to the severe lesson of the Crimean war, has learned that a  great nation must stand upon a foundation of something more than  aristocracy and nobility. To this influence is largely due the present  growing prosperity of Tashkend, which, in military importance, is rapidly  giving way to Askabad, \"the key to Herat.\"    That spirit of equality and fraternity which characterizes the government  of a Russian _mir_, or village, has been carried even into central Asia.  We have frequently seen Russian peasants and natives occupying adjoining  apartments in the same household, while in the process of trade all  classes seem to fraternize in an easy and even cordial manner. The same is  true of the children, who play together indiscriminately in the street.  Many a one of these heterogeneous groups we have watched \"playing marbles\"  with the ankle-bones of sheep, and listened, with some amusement, to their  half Russian, half native jargon. Schools are now being established to  educate the native children in"]]]
