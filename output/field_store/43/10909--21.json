If however,  contrary to expectation, it should happen that you were in  pressing need of an instrument, very little played upon, the one  at Weymar would be at your disposal at any moment.    With regard to the Beethoven Lieder-Cyclus I have just received a  letter from Mr. Haslinger which I do not communicate in full  because of the personal details it contains, but this is the  passage, as laconic as it is satisfactory, with regard to this  publication:--    \"I give you with pleasure my fullest consent to the edition of  the Beethoven Liederkreis by Breitkopf and Hartel.\"    So by tomorrow's post I shall have the honor of returning you the  proofs of the Lieder-Cyclus, which forms a continuation to the  Beethoven Lieder which you have already edited, and which you  will publish when you think well. .--.    With the proofs of my third piece on the \"Prophete\" I will also  send you all the pieces on it (piano and voice) which you have  been so good as to lend me, as well as the piano score, which I  don't require any more; for, unless I should have a success which  I dare not hope for (for these three pieces), and an express  order from you for another series of three pieces, which I could  easily extract from that vast score, I shall make this the end of  my work on the \"Prophete.\" I come at last to a question, not at  all serious, but somewhat embarrassing for me,--that of fixing  the price of the manuscripts that you are so good as to print. I  confess that this is my \"quart d'heure de Rabelais!\" [The \"quart  d'heure de Rabelais\" refers to an incident in his life, and  means, in round terms, the moment of paying--i.e., any  disagreeable moment.] In order not to prolong it for you, allow  me to tell you without further ceremony that the whole of the six  works together, which are as follows:--    Lieder of Beethoven, Lieder-Cyclus of Beethoven, Consolations  (six numbers), Illustrations of the \"Prophete\" (three numbers),  published by your house, are worth, according to my estimation,  80-100 louis d'or.    If this price does not seem disproportionate to you, as I am  pleased to think it will not, and if it suits you to publish  other pieces of my composition, I shall have the pleasure of  sending you in the course of the year:--    1. A \"Morceau de Concert\"(for piano without orchestra), composed  for the competition of the Paris Conservatoire, 1850.    2. The complete series of the Beethoven Symphonies, of which you  have as yet only published the \"Pastorale\" and the \"C minor.\" (In  the supposition that this publication will suit your house, I  will beg you to make the necessary arrangements from now onwards  with Mr. Haslinger; perhaps it will even be expedient that the  Symphony in A (7th), which Haslinger published several years ago  from the arrangement that I had made, should reappear in its  proper place in the complete series of the symphonies.)    3. Bach's six fugues (for organ with pedals), arranged for piano  alone.    In the middle of February I shall send you the complete  manuscript of my little volume on Chopin, and a little later in  the same month we shall set ourselves to work here on the study  of Schubert's opera, the performance of which will take place in  the first days of April. If, as I do not doubt, the performance  of the \"Prophete\" draws you to Dresden, I shall certainly have  the pleasure of seeing you there, for I have just begged Mr. de  Luttichau to be so good as to reserve me a place for that  evening, and I shall not fail to be there. Meanwhile, my dear M.  Hartel, believe me,    Yours sincerely and affectionately,    F. Liszt Weymar, January 14th, 1850    On the occasion of Schubert's opera I shall probably set to work  on the arrangement of the symphony, of which, meanwhile, I hold  the score.--Compliments and best regards to Madame Hartel, which  I know you will be kind enough to convey to her.        65. To Breitkopf and Hartel    February 24th, 1850    My dear Sir,    .--. With regard to Schubert's opera [\"Alfonso and Estrella.\" It  was given for the first time on June 24th, 1854, the birthday of  the Grand Duke (but not without some necessary cuts)], a recent  experience has entirely confirmed me in the opinion I had already  formed at the time of the first rehearsals with piano which we  had last spring--namely, that Schubert's delicate and interesting  score is, as it were, crushed by the heaviness of the libretto!  Nevertheless, I do not despair of giving this work with success;  but this success appears possible only on one condition--namely,  to adapt another libretto to Schubert's music. And since, by a  special fate, of which I have no reason to complain, a part of  Schubert's heritage has become my domain, I shall willingly busy  myself, as time and place offer, with the preparatory work and  the mise-en-scene of this opera, for which it would be  advantageous, in my opinion, if it could be first produced in  Paris. Belloni informs me that it will be pretty easy for you to  ensure me the entire rights of this work for France. If such be  the case I would take suitable measures for the success of this  work, on occasion of which I should naturally have to make a  considerable outlay of time and money, so that I should not be  disposed to run any risk without the guarantee of proportionate  receipts from the sale of the work in France, and author's rights  which I shall have to give up to the new poet.    This matter, however, is not at all pressing, for I shall only be  able to set to work in the matter in the course of next year  (1851); but I shall be very much obliged to you not to lose sight  of it, and to put me in possession, when you are able, of the  cession of the French and English rights, in consideration of  which I will set to work and try to get the best possible chances  of success.    Many thanks to you for so kindly sending the score of Schubert's  Symphony. That of the \"Prophete\" not being wanted by me any  longer, I enclose it in the parcel of proofs and manuscripts  which I beg you to undertake to send off to Mr. Belloni's address  in Paris.    On Easter Monday we shall give the first performance of \"Comte  Ory.\" [By Rossini] Would you not feel tempted to come and hear  it? It is a charming work, brimming over and sparkling with  melody like champagne, so that at the last rehearsal I christened  it the \"Champagner-Oper\" [\"Champagne Opera.\"] and in order to  justify this title our amiable Intendant proposes to regale the  whole theater with a few dozens of champagne in the second act,  in order to spirit up the chorus.    \"Qu'il avait de bon vin le Seigneur chatelain!\"    Cordial remembrances from yours affectionately,    F. Liszt    I should be glad for the publication of No. 3 of the pieces on  the \"Prophete,\" and the \"Consolations,\" not to be put off long.        66. To Professor J. C. Lobe in Leipzig    [Autograph in the possession of M. Alfred Bovet at Valentigney.--  The addressee (1797-1881), a writer on music (formerly Court  Musician at Weimar), lived from 1846 in Leipzig.]    My esteemed Friend,    It is with much pleasure I send you the good news that H.R.H. the  Grand Duchess has graciously accepted the dedication of your  \"System of Composition.\" [Published in 1850.] Our gracious  protector [feminine] started yesterday for The Hague, and will  not be back till towards the middle of August.    I hope you will be sure not to fail us at the Herder Festival in  Weymar (August 25th), as well as at the \"Lohengrin\" evening  (28th); we have been already waiting for you so long!    Between the performances of the \"Messiah\" and \"Lohengrin\" (to say  nothing of my \"Prometheus\" choruses) will also be the best  opportunity for you to present your work in person to the Grand  Duchess.    Remember me kindly to your dear family, and remain my friend as I  am yours    Most truly,    F. Liszt Weymar, July 10th, 1850        67. To Friedrich Wieck in Dresden    [published in the \"Neue Musik-Zeitung\" in 1888.--The addressee  was the well-known pianoforte master, the father of Clara  Schumann (1785-1873).]    Esteemed Sir,    It will be a real pleasure to me to welcome you here, and your  daughter [Marie Wieck, Hohenzollern Court Pianist in Dresden],  whom I have already heard so highly commended. Weymar, as you  know it of old, offers no brilliant resources for concerts; but  you may rest assured beforehand that I, on my side, shall do  everything that is possible in this connection to make things  easy for you. To me it seems especially desirable that you should  wait until the return of H.R.H. the Grand Duchess, which will be  within a fortnight; should you, however, be tied by time and come  here before that date, I bid you heartily welcome, dear sir, and  place myself at your disposal.    Yours truly,    F. Liszt    Weymar, August 4th, 1850        68. To Simon Lowy in Vienna.    [Autograph in the Royal Library in Vienna. Printed in a German  translation, La Mara, \"Letters of Musicians during Five  Centuries,\" vol. ii.]    Weymar, August 5th, 1850    Dear Friend,    My cousin Edward writes me word that you are a little piqued at  my long silence,--and I, shall I tell you frankly? am a little  piqued that you have not yet thought of coming to see me, and of  transferring your bath season to some place in the neighborhood  of Weymar. Will you make peace with me?--    Accept as a friend the invitation I give you in all friendship.  Arrive at Weymar the 23rd of August, and stay till the 30th at  least. You will find several of your friends here,--Dingelstedt,  Jules Janin, Meyerbeer (?), etc.,--and you will hear, firstly, on  the evening of the 24th, a good hour and a half of music that I  have just composed (Overture and Choruses) for the \"Prometheus\"  of Herder, which will be given as a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36903"],[0,"Marvels of Pond-life (#17)"],[1,"such a view, which is the most favorable for the exhibition  of the mouth. To make out the details of their structure, to see the  nucleus and other organs, the flattening in the live-box is useful, and  it enables much higher powers to be employed.    [Illustration: A, B, C, D, Stentor polymorphus in different degrees of  expansion. A large specimen is one twenty-fourth of an inch long.]    After leaving the Anacharis in a glass jar for a few days, the Stentors  multiplied exceedingly; some clung to the sides of the vessel in  sociable communities, others hung from the surface of the water, and  crowds settled upon the stems, visibly changing their tint, as the  Stentor green was much bluer than that of the plant. Scores swam about  in all sorts of forms. Now they looked like cylindrical vessels with  expanding brims, now globular, now oddly distorted, until all semblance  of the original shape was lost. Many were found in shiny tubes, but  these were never so lively or green as the free swimmers, but mostly of  a dingy dirty hue.    These housekeepers were more timid and cautious than the roving tribe.  They came slowly out of their dens, drew back at the slightest alarm,  never took their tails from home, and only extended their full length  when certain not to be disturbed. Some authors have thought they only  take to private lodgings when they feel a little bit poorly, but others  dispute this opinion, and I do not think it is correct. I have found  these Stentors at all seasons, from January to the autumn, but they are  never so numerous, nor aggregated in numbers like the roving sort.  Whether they are old folks, who are tired of the world and its gaieties,  and devote the remainder of their lives to contemplation, or whether  they are bachelors disappointed in love, I am unable to say; but they  are very inferior in beauty to the \"gay and glittering crowd.\"[19]    [19] Stein says the colourless variety of S. Polymorphus is sometimes  found with a tube, and the S. Roessellii very frequently so provided.    For some weeks my Stentors abounded, and then most of them suddenly  disappeared. They could not have \"moved,\" but probably \"went to smash\"  by a process peculiar to infusoria, and which Dujardin politely  describes as \"diffluence.\" This mode of making an exit from the stage of  life is more tragical than the ripping up so fashionable in Japan. The  integument bursts, and its contents disperse in minute particles, that  in their turn disappear, and scarcely leave a \"wrack behind.\"    The Stentors obey the injunction to \"increase and multiply\" by  self-division, which Stein says is always oblique, and the nucleus,  which plays such an important part in infusoria, is band-like,  moniliform (bead-shape), or round. When an animalcule increases by  self-division, a portion of the nucleus goes with each part, and it is  probably the organ which stimulates the change. It is also concerned in  other modes of propagation. \"The anus is situated on the back close  beneath the ciliary circle;\" and the \"contractile vesicle on a level  with the ciliary wreath.\" Stein records that in November, 1858, he met  green Stentors (_Polymorphus_) encysted, and he figures one in a  gelatinous flask having a stopper in its narrow neck.    Before closing our account of the Stentor, let us revert a moment to the  ciliary wreath, as it may be made the subject of a curious experiment.  If, for example, the cilia are viewed at right-angles to their length,  they will seem to form a delicate frill, in which a quivering motion is  perceived. But if the table is shaken by a sharp blow, the frill is  thrown into waves, or takes the form which washerwomen give to certain  female articles by the use of the Italian iron, and the ciliary motion  is thus made to take place in different planes, and rendered strikingly  apparent.    One day turning over the Anacharis in search of subjects, a small brown  tube was noticed, from which a glassy rod protruded like the feeler of a  rotifer. Keeping the table quiet, and watching the result, was soon  rewarded by a further protrusion of the feeler, accompanied by a portion  of the body of the inmate of the tube. The feeler was thrust on this  side and on that, as if collecting information for its proprietor, who,  I suppose, was satisfied with the intelligence, and gradually extended  herself, until she stood out two thirds in length beyond the tube, and  set two lobes of one nearly continuous ciliary organ in rapid motion.  Sometimes the creature, _Cephalosiphon limnias_, bent its neck, if I may  so speak, to the right, and sometimes to the left, and sometimes stood  upright, when the true form of the ciliary apparatus could be seen. The  tube of this creature was opaque, from the adhesion of foreign matter,  and presented an untidy appearance, strangely contrasting with the  clear, neat bottles of the Floscules. These Cephalosiphons are very  whimsical in their ways, and many that were sent to different observers  never exhibited their ciliary wreaths, but performed sundry antics,  disguising their true shape.    [Illustration: Cephalosiphon limnias.]    Somewhat like the Cephalosiphon, though much commoner and without the  siphon, is Limnias ceratophylli, which every collector is sure to meet.  The length of the Limnias varies, according to Pritchard, from 1--20\" to  1--40\". Our Cephalosiphon, when fully extended and magnified one hundred  and eighty linear, looked about three inches and a half long, and was  therefore very small. Just below the ciliary lobes the gizzard was seen,  with its toothed hammers working one against the other. The masticatory  organ differs from the typical form, as represented in the Brachion; and  Mr. Gosse observes of Limnias that \"each _uncus_ forms, with its  _ramus_, a well-defined mass of muscle enclosing the solid parts, and in  form approaching the quadrature of a globe. Across the upper surface of  the mass the _uncus_ is stretched like three long parallel fingers,  arched in their common direction, and imbedded in the muscular  substances, their points just reaching the opposing face of the _ramus_,  and meeting the points of the opposite _uncus_ when closed.\"[20]    [20] The terms _uncus_, _ramus_, etc., have been explained in Chapter  II, page 28.    There is no connection between Limnias or Cephalosiphon and their tubes,  except that of simple adhesion, which takes place by means of the end of  their foot-stalks.    In a former chapter we have described an interesting relation of the  Vorticella, the Cothurnia, whose elegant crystal vases form a very  artistic abode, characterised by possessing a distinct foot. Other  species of the same family inhabit vases which have no foot or stalk, or  live in gelatinous sheaths less accurately fashioned. Sometimes these  creatures are obliging enough to conform to the specific descriptions  which eminent naturalists have given of them, and also to the characters  which the authorities have assigned to the different genera in which  they have been grouped, but the microscopist will often meet with  difficulties in the way of classification.    [Illustration: Vaginicola (?) (A, elongated; B, retracted.)]    Attached to a piece of weed were a number of cylindrical masses of  brownish jelly, with rounded tops, and situated in an irregular and very  transparent sheath, about twice as high as themselves. Presently they  all rose up to four times their previous height, put forth a beautiful  crown of vibrating cilia, and opened a sort of trap-door to their  internal arrangements. In this position they had a long cylindrical  form, gracefully curved, but of nearly equal width from the mouth to the  base, and they readily imbibed particles of carmine, which tinged sundry  little cavities with its characteristic hue. The slightest disturbance  caused the ciliary wreaths to be drawn in, and the bodies to be  retracted, and descend into their house like a conjuring toy, until the  appearance first described was reproduced.    The general form and structure of these objects was like the drawings  usually given of _Vaginicola_, which is said not to exist in groups,  although two individuals are commonly found in one well-shaped cell.  These creatures, however, did not taper towards the base as Vaginicolae  generally do, and perhaps they became aware of this defect in their  figures, for after a day or two a change appeared, and they assumed a  more graceful form by swelling out in the middle, and then growing  slender down to the bottom, very much like the pattern given by  glass-blowers to little vases of flowers.    It is very important to note the changing appearance of animalcules, and  where the same individuals can be observed from day to day, these will  often be found considerable. It is probable that when such particulars  are fully known, the number of species will be greatly reduced, and the  study of these organisms considerably simplified. I have called the  animals just described _Vaginicolae_, but the reader must be prepared to  find similar bodies, inhabiting well-formed vases, either solitarily or  in couples, the latter condition arising from the fission of one  individual without a corresponding division of the abode.    For a few weeks I continually met with groups living as I have  described, in what may be called amorphous cells, which were often so  nearly like the surrounding water in refracting power, as to be  discerned with some difficulty. No trace could be seen of divisions  into separate cells, but they all appeared to live happily together in  one room, and if one went up all went up, and if one went down all went  down, as if their proceedings were regulated by a community of sensation  or will.    Another little curiosity was a transparent cup upon a slender stem,  which stood upright like a wineglass, and supported on its mouth a  transparent globe. By removing a leaf which prevented the"]]]
