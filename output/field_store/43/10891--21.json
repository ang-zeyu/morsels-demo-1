They will sometimes enter human bodies, and will  distract them, throw them into fits, cast them into the water, into  the fire, &c. They will trouble them with dreams, nightmare,  hysterics, fever, &c. They will also deform them in body and in  features, by convulsions, cramps, contortions, &c., and will sometimes  compel them to utter blasphemies, horrible curses, and even words of  other languages. If permitted, they will often cause death. Some of  these spirits are adulterous, and suggest to the mind all manner of  lasciviousness, all kinds of evil thoughts and temptations.    A person, on looking another in the eye, who is possessed of an evil  spirit, will feel a shock--a nervous feeling, which will, as it were,  make his hair stand on end; in short, a shock resembling that produced  in a nervous system by the sight of a serpent.    Some of these foul spirits, when possessing a person, will cause a  disagreeable smell about the person thus possessed, which will be  plainly manifest to the senses of those about him, even though the  person thus afflicted should be washed and change his clothes every  few minutes.    There are, in fact, most awful instances of the spirit of lust, and of  bawdy and abominable words and actions, inspired and uttered by  persons possessed of such spirits, even though the persons were  virtuous and modest so long as they possessed their own agency.    Some of these spirits cause deafness, others dumbness, &c.    We can suggest no remedy for these multiplied evils, to which poor  human nature is subject, except a good life, while we are in  possession of our faculties, prayers and fastings of good and holy  men, and the ministry of those who have power given them to rebuke  evil spirits, and cast out devils, in the name of Jesus Christ.    Among the diversified spirits abroad in the world here are many  religious spirits, which are not of God, but which deceive those who  have not the keys of Apostleship and Priesthood, or, in other words,  the keys of the science of Theology to guide them. Some of these  spirits are manifested in the camp-meetings of certain sects, and in  nearly all the excitements and confusions in religious meetings  falsely called \"_revivals_.\" All the strange extacies, swoonings,  screamings, shoutings, dancings, jumpings, and a thousand other  ridiculous and unseemly manifestations, which neither edify nor  instruct, are the fruits of these deceptive spirits.    We must, however, pity, rather than ridicule, or despise, the subjects  or advocates of these deceptions. Many of them are honest, but they  have no Apostles, nor other officers, nor gifts to detect evil, or to  keep them from being led by every delusive spirit.    Real visions, or inspirations which _would_ edify and instruct, they  are taught to deny. Should Peter or Paul, or an angel from heaven,  come among them, they would denounce him as an impostor, with the  assertion that Apostles and angels were no longer needed.    There is still another class of unholy spirits at work in the  world--spirits diverse from all these, far more intelligent, and, if  possible, still more dangerous. These are, the spirit of divination,  vision, foretelling, familiar spirits, \"Animal Magnetism,\"  \"Mesmerism,\" &c., which reveal many and great truths mixed with the  greatest errors, and also display much intelligence, but have not the  keys of the science of Theology--the Holy Priesthood.    These spirits, generally, deny the divinity of Christ, and the great  truths of the atonement, and of the resurrection of the body. Of such  are the Shakers of the United States, and their revelations. They deny  the resurrection of the body. From this source are the revelations of  Emmanuel Swedenborg, which also deny the resurrection. From this  source, also, are the revelations of Andrew Jackson Davis, of  Poughkeepsie, New York, which deny the resurrection and the atonement.  From this source are all the revelations which deny the ordinances of  the Gospel, and the keys and gifts of the Holy Apostleship.    Last of all, these are they who climb up in some other way, besides  the door, into the sheepfold; and who prophesy or work in their own  name, and not in the name of Jesus Christ.    No man can do a miracle in the name and by the authority of Jesus  Christ, except he be a good man, and authorized by him.          CHAPTER XIII.    DREAMS.          Mysterious power, whence hope ethereal springs!      Sweet heavenly relic of eternal things!      Inspiring oft deep thoughts of things divine:      The past, the present, and the future thine.      Thy reminiscences transport the soul      To memory's Paradise--its future goal.        \"_For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it      not. In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep      falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed: then he      openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction_.\" Job      xxxiii. 14, 15, 16.    In all ages and dispensations God has revealed many important  instructions and warnings to men by means of dreams.    When the outward organs of thought and perception are released from  their activity, the nerves unstrung, and the whole of mortal humanity  lies hushed in quiet slumbers, in order to renew its strength and  vigour, it is then that the spiritual organs are at liberty, in a  certain degree, to assume their wonted functions, to recall some faint  outlines, some confused and half defined recollections, of that  heavenly world, and those endearing scenes of their former estate,  from which they have descended in order to obtain and mature a  tabernacle of flesh. Their kindred spirits, their guardian angels then  hover about them with the fondest affection, the most anxious  solicitude. Spirit communes with spirit, thought meets thought, soul  blends with soul, in all the raptures of mutual, pure, and eternal  love.    In this situation, the spiritual organs are susceptible of converse  with Deity, or of communion with angels, and the spirits of just men  made perfect.    In this situation, we frequently hold communication with our departed  father, mother, brother, sister, son or daughter; or with the former  husband or wife of our bosom, whose affection for us, being rooted and  grounded in the eternal elements, or issuing from under the sanctuary  of Love's eternal fountain, can never be lessened or diminished by  death, distance of space, or length of years.    We may, perhaps, have had a friend of the other sex, whose pulse beat  in unison with our own; whose every thought was big with the  aspirations, the hopes of a bright future in union with our own; whose  happiness in time or in eternity, would never be fully consummated  without that union. Such a one, snatched from time in the very bloom of  youth, lives in the other sphere, with the same bright hope, watching  our every footstep, in our meanderings through the rugged path of  life, with longing desires for our eternal happiness, and eager for  our safe arrival in the same sphere.    With what tenderness of love, with what solicitude of affection will  they watch over our slumbers, hang about our pillow, and seek, by  means of the spiritual fluid, to communicate with our spirits, to warn  us of dangers or temptation, to comfort and soothe our sorrow, or to  ward off the ills which might befall us, or perchance to give us some  kind token of remembrance or undying love!    It is the pure in heart, the lovers of truth and virtue, that will  appreciate these remarks, for they know, by at least a small degree of  experience, that these things are so.    Those who are habitually given to vice, immorality and abomination;  those who walk in the daily indulgence of unlawful lust; those who  neither believe in Jesus Christ, nor seek to pray to him, and keep his  commandments; those who do not cultivate the pure, refined and holy  joys of innocent and heavenly affection, but who would sacrifice every  finer feeling at the shrine of lawless pleasure and brutal  desires--those persons will not understand and appreciate these views,  because their good angels, their kindred spirits have long since  departed, and ceased to attend them, being grieved and disgusted with  their conduct.    The Spirit of the Lord has also been grieved, and has left them to  themselves, to struggle alone amid the dangers and sorrows of life; or  to be the associates of demons and impure spirits. Such persons dream  of adultery, gluttony, debauchery, and crimes of every kind. Such  persons have the foreshadowings of a doleful death, and of darkness,  and the buffetings of fiends and malicious spirits.    But, blessed are they who forfeit not their claims to the watchful  care and protection of, and communion with, the heavenly powers, and  pure and lovely spirits.    We can only advise the other classes of mankind, and entreat them, by  the joys of love, by all the desires of life, by all the dread of  death, darkness, and a dreary hereafter, yea, by the blood of Him who  died, by the victory of him who rose in triumph from the grave, by  their regard for those kindred spirits which would gladly love them in  worlds without end, to turn from their sinful course of life, to obey  the ordinances and commandments of Jesus Christ, that the Spirit of  God may return to them, and their good angels and spirits again return  to their sacred charge.    O what a comfort it is, in this dreary world, to be loved and cared  for by all-powerful, warm-hearted, and lovely friends!    _A Dream!_    What have not dreams accomplished?    Dreams and their interpretation brought the beloved son of Jacob from  his dungeon, made him prime minister of Egypt, and the saviour of a  nation, and of his father's house.

Marine Animals of Massachusetts Bay. (#17)"],[1,"the occupation is not a wholly selfish  one, since the cavity of every Hydra communicates with that of the  stem, and the food taken in at these over-gaping mouths, is at once  circulated through all parts of the community, with the exception of  the oil bubble, from which it is excluded by the transverse partition  dividing it from all the lower members of the stock. The shields share  in this general nourishment of the compound body by means of  chymiferous tubes extending toward the outer surface, and opening into  the cavity of the stem. The mouth of this Hydra is very flexible (Fig.  111), expanding and contracting at the will of the animal, and  sometimes acting as a sucker, fastening itself, leech-like, on the  object from which it seeks to draw its sustenance. (See Fig. 111.) The  tentacles attached to this set of Hydrae are exceedingly long and  delicate. They arise in a cluster at the upper and inner edge of the  Hydra, just at its point of juncture with the stem, and being  extremely flexible and contractile, their long tendril-like sprays are  thrown out in an endless variety of attitudes. (See Fig. 115.) Along  the whole length of this kind of tentacle are attached little pendent  knobs at even distances; Fig. 112 represents such a knob greatly  magnified, and absolutely paved with lasso-cells, the inner and  smaller ones being surrounded by a row of larger ones.        [Illustration: Fig. 112. Magnified pendent knob.]        [Illustration: Fig. 113. Medusa with corkscrew shaped tentacles.]    The second set of Hydrae (Fig. 113), are also open-mouthed,  corresponding with those described above, in everything except the  tentacles, which are both shorter and thicker, and are coiled in a  corkscrew-like spiral. These are thickly studded for their whole  length with lasso-cells. (See Fig. 113.)    In the third and last set of Hydrae (Fig. 114), the mouth is closed;  they have, therefore, no share in feeding the community, but receive  their nourishment from the cavity of the stem into which they open.  They differ also from the others in having a single tentacle instead  of a cluster, and on this tentacle the lasso-cells are scattered at  uneven distances (Fig. 114). The special function of these closed  Hydrae is yet to be explained; they have oil bubbles at their upper end  (see Fig. 111, the top Hydra), and though we have never seen them drop  off, it seems natural to suppose that they do separate from the parent  stock, and found new communities similar to those from which they  arise.        [Illustration: Fig. 114. Medusa with a simple thread-like      tentacle.]    The intricate story of this singular compound existence does not end  here. There is still another set of individuals whose share in  maintaining the life of the community is by no means the least  important. Little bunches of buds, of a different character from any  described above, may be seen at certain distances along the lower part  of the stem. These are the reproductive individuals. They are clusters  of imperfect sexual Medusae, resembling the rudimentary Medusae of  Tubularia (Fig. 99), which are never freed from the parent stem, but  discharge their contents at the breeding season. Like many other  compound Hydroids, the sexes are never combined, in one of these  communities; they are always either male or female, and as those with  female buds have not yet been observed, we can only judge by inference  of their probable character. Front what is already known, however, of  Hydroid communities of a like description, we suppose that the process  of reproduction must be the same in these, and that the female stocks  of Nanomia give birth to small Jelly-fishes, the eggs of which become  oil bubbles, similar to that with which our little community began.  (Fig. 108.)        [Illustration: Fig. 115. Adult Nanomia, natural size, at rest.]    By the time all these individuals have been added along the length of  the stem, the stem itself has grown to be about three inches long  (Fig. 115), though the tentacles hanging from the various members of  the community give to the whole an appearance of much greater length.  The motion of this little string of living beings is most graceful.  The oil bubble (Fig. 116) at the upper end is their float; the  swimming bells immediately below it (Fig. 110), by the convulsive  contractions of which they move along, are their oars. The water is  not taken in and expelled again by all the bells at once, but first  from all the bells on one side, beginning at the lower one, and then  from all those on the opposite side, beginning also at the lower one;  this alternate action gives to their movements a swinging, swaying  character, expressive of the utmost freedom and grace. Whether such a  little community darts with a lightning-like speed through the water,  or floats quietly up and down, for its movements are both rapid and  gentle, it always sways in this way from side to side. Its beauty is  increased by the spots of bright red scattered along the length of the  stock at the base and tips of the Hydrae, as well as upon the  tentacles. The movements and attitudes of the tentacles are most  various. Sometimes they shoot them out in straight lines on either  side, and then the aspect of the whole thing reminds one of a tiny  chandelier in which the coral drops make the pendants, or they may be  caught up in a succession of loops or floating in long streamers;  indeed, there is no end to the fantastic forms they assume, ever  astonishing you by some new combination of curves. The prevailing hue  of the whole community is rosy, with the exception of the oil bubble  or float, which looks a bright garnet color when seen in certain  lights.        [Illustration: Fig. 116. Oil float of Nanomia; greatly magnified.]    Let us now compare one of the Hydrae hanging from the stem (Fig. 113)  with the Hybocodon (Fig. 102). The reader will remember the  unsymmetrical bell of this singular Medusa, one half of its disk more  largely developed than the other, with the proboscis hanging from the  centre, and the cluster of tentacles from one side. Let us now split  the bell so as to divide it in two halves with the proboscis hanging  between them; next enlarge the side where there are no tentacles, and  give it a triangular outline; then contract the opposite side so as to  draw up the cluster of tentacles to meet the base of the proboscis,  and what have we? The proboscis now corresponds to the Hydra of our  Nanomia, with the cluster of tentacles attached to its upper edge  (Fig. 113), while the enlarged half of the bell represents the shield.  If this homology be correct it shows that the Nanomia is not, as some  naturalists have supposed all the Siphonophores to be, a single  animal, its different parts being a mere collection of organs endowed  with special functions, as feeding, locomotion, reproduction, &c., but  that it is indeed a community of distinct individuals corresponding  exactly to the polymorphous Hydroids, whose stocks are attached, such  as Hydractinia, and differing from them only in being free and  floating.    The homologies of the Siphonophorae or floating Hydroids, with many of  the fixed Hydroids, is perhaps more striking when we compare the  earlier stages of their growth. Suppose, for instance, that the  planula of our Melicertum (See Fig. 81) should undergo its development  without becoming attached to the ground,--what should we then have? A  floating community (Fig. 83), including on the same stock like the  Nanomia, both sterile and fertile Hydrae, from the latter of which  Medusae bells are developed. The little Hydractinia community (Fig.  100), in which we have no less than four distinct kinds of  individuals, each performing a definite distinct function, affords a  still better comparison.      _Physalia_. (_Physalia Arethusa_ TIL.)        [Illustration: Fig. 117. Physalia; _a_ _b_ air sac with crest _c_,      _m_ bunches of individuals, _n_ central tentacles, _t_ _t_      expanded tentacles. (_Agassiz_.)]    Among the most beautiful of the Siphonophores, is the well-known  Physalia or Portuguese man-of-war, represented in Fig. 117. The float  above is a sort of crested sac or bladder, while the long streamers  below consist of a number of individuals corresponding in their nature  and functions to those composing a Hydroid community. Among them are  the fertile and sterile Hydrae (Fig. 118), the feeders and Medusae bells  (Fig. 119). The Physalia properly belongs to tropical waters, but  sometimes floats northward, in the warm current of the Gulf Stream,  and is stranded on Cape Cod. When found so far from their home,  however, they have usually lost much of their vividness of color; to  judge of their beauty one should see them in the Gulf of Mexico,  sailing along with their brilliant float fully expanded, their crest  raised, and their long tentacles trailing after them.        [Illustration: Fig. 118. Bunch of Hydrae; _a_ base of attachment,      _b_ _b_ _b_ single Hydrae, _c_ _c_ tentacles. (_Agassiz_.)]        [Illustration: Fig. 119. Bunch of Hydrae; cluster of Medusae; _b_      _b_ Hydrae with tentacles, _c_ _d_ bunches of Medusae (_Agassiz_.)]      _Velella_. (_Velella mutica_ BOSC.)    Another very beautiful floating Hydroid, occasionally caught in our  waters, though its home is also far to the south, is the Velella (Fig.  120). It is bright blue in color, and in form not unlike a little flat  boat with an upright sail. Its Medusa (Fig. 121) resembles so much  that of some of our Tubularians, that it has actually been removed on  this account from the old group of Siphonophorae, and placed next the  Tubularians; another evidence of the close affinity between the former  and the Hydroids.        [Illustration: Fig. 120. Velella; _m_ so-called mouth, _a_      tentacles. (_Agassiz_.)]        [Illustration: Fig. 121. Free Medusa of Velella; _a_ proboscis,      _b_"]]]
