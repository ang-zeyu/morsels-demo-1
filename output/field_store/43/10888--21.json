'The       flat, well-timbered land all around the point lies very       convenient for building.' After creating in imagination a       fortress and a city, he and his party swam their horses       across the Allegheny, and wrapt their blankets around them       for the night, on its northwest bank. From the Fork the       chief of the Delawares conducted Washington through rich       alluvial fields to the pleasing valley at Logstown. There       deserters from Louisiana discoursed of the route from New       Orleans to Quebec, by way of the Wabash and the Maumee, and       of a detachment from the lower province on its way to meet       the French troops from Lake Erie, while Washington held       close colloquy with the half-king; the one anxious to gain       the west as a part of the territory of the ancient dominion,       the other to preserve it for the Red Men. 'We are brothers,'       said the half-king in council; 'we are one people; I will       send back the French speech-belt, and will make the Shawnees       and the Delawares do the same.' On the night of the       twenty-ninth of November, the council-fire was kindled an       aged orator was selected to address the French the speech       which he was to deliver was debated and rehearsed; it was       agreed that, unless the French would heed this third warning       to quit the land, the Delawares also would be their enemies;       and a very large string of black and white wampun was sent       to the Six Nations as a prayer for aid. After these       preparations, the party of Washington, attended by the       half-king, and envoys of the Delawares, moved onwards to the       post of the French at Venango. The officers there avowed the       purpose of taking possession of the Ohio; and they mingled       the praises of La Salle with boasts of their forts at Le       Boeuf and Erie, at Niagara, Toronto, and Frontenac. 'The       English,' said they, 'can raise two men to our one; but they       are too dilatory to prevent any enterprise of ours.' The       Delawares were intimidated or debauched; but the half-king       clung to Washington like a brother, and delivered up his       belt as he had promised. The rains of December had swollen       the creeks. The messengers could pass them only by felling       trees for bridges. Thus they proceeded, now killing a buck       and now a bear, delayed by excessive rains and snows, by       mire and swamps, while Washington's quick eye discerned all       the richness of the meadows. At Waterford, the limit of his       journey, he found Fort Le Boeuf defended by cannon. Around       it stood the barracks of the soldiers, rude log-cabins,       roofed with bark. Fifty birch-bark canoes, and one hundred       seventy boats of pine, were already prepared for the descent       of the river, and materials were collected for building       more. The Commander, Gardeur de St. Pierre, an officer of       integrity and experience, and, for his dauntless courage,       both feared and beloved by the Red Men, refused to discuss       questions of right. 'I am here,' said he, 'by the orders of       my general, to which I shall conform with exactness and       resolution.' And he avowed his purpose of seizing every       Englishman within the Ohio Valley. France was resolved on       possessing the great territory which her missionaries and       travellers had revealed to the world. Breaking away from       courtesies, Washington hastened homewards to Virginia. The       rapid current of French Creek dashed his party against       rocks; in shallow places they waded, the water congealing on       their clothes; where the ice had lodged in the bend of the       rivers, they carried their canoe across the neck. At       Venango, they found their horses, but so weak, the       travellers went still on foot, heedless of the storm. The       cold increased very fast; the paths grew 'worse by a deep       snow continually freezing.' Impatient to get back with his       despatches, the young envoy, wrapping himself in an Indian       dress, with gun in hand and pack on his back, the day after       Christmas quitted the usual path, and, with Gist for his       sole companion, by aid of the compass, steered the nearest       way across the country for the Fork. An Indian, who had lain       in wait for him, fired at him from not fifteen steps'       distance, but, missing him, became his prisoner. 'I would       have killed him,' wrote Gist, 'but Washington forbade.'       Dismissing their captive at night, they walked about half a       mile, then kindled a fire, fixed their course by the       compass, and continued travelling all night, and all the       next day, till quite dark. Not till then did the weary       wanderers 'think themselves safe enough to sleep,' and they       encamped, with no shelter but the leafless forest-tree. On       reaching the Allegheny, with one poor hatchet and a whole       day's work, a raft was constructed and launched. But before       they were half over the river, they were caught in the       running ice, expecting every moment to be crushed, unable to       reach either shore. Putting out the setting-pole to stop the       raft, Washington was jerked into the deep water, and saved       himself only by grasping at the raft-logs. They were obliged       to make for an island. There lay Washington, imprisoned by       the elements; but the late December night was intensely       cold, and in the morning he found the river frozen. Not till       he reached Gist's settlement, in January, 1754, were his       toils lightened.\"    Washington reported the state of affairs on the Lakes,--and active  measures were consequently adopted. Of the rapid and brilliant  development of his military genius, we are not now to trace the  progress; but it is scarcely possible to read without a shudder of \"the  hair-breadth 'scapes\" of the young man whose life was of such  inestimable consequence to his country. Thus, in the battle fought by  Braddock--to whom Washington acted as aide-de-camp--against the French  and Indians in 1755, he appeared to others as well as to himself to bear  a charmed life. In this action, says Mr. Bancroft,--         \"Of eighty-six officers, twenty-six were killed--among them,       Sir Peter Halket,--and thirty-seven were wounded, including       Gage and other field officers. Of the men, one half were       killed or wounded. Braddock braved every danger. His       secretary was shot dead; both his English aids were disabled       early in the engagement, leaving the American alone to       distribute his orders. 'I expected every moment,' said one       whose eye was on Washington, 'to see him fall.' Nothing but       the superintending care of Providence could have saved him.       An Indian chief--I suppose a Shawnee--singled him out with       his rifle, and bade others of his warriors do the same. Two       horses were killed under him; four balls penetrated his       coat. 'Some potent Manitou guards his life,' exclaimed the       savage. 'Death,' wrote Washington, 'was levelling my       companions on every side of me, but, by the all-powerful       dispensations of Providence, I have been protected.' 'To the       public,' said Davis, a learned divine, in the following       month, 'I point out that heroic youth, Colonel Washington,       whom I cannot but hope Providence has preserved in so signal       a manner for some important service to his country.' 'Who is       Mr. Washington?' asked Lord Halifax, a few months later. 'I       know nothing of him,' he added, 'but that they say he       behaved in Braddock's action as bravely as if he really       loved the whistling of bullets.'\"    Thus opened that career of glory, moderation, and success--thus, at the  period of nascent manhood were exhibited the marking traits of that  serene and devoted character--which have placed the name of Washington  on the noblest and loftiest pedestal in the Temple of Fame.    Leaving for a while the only figure in that scene of miserable and  savage warfare on which the mind can dwell with any degree of trust and  satisfaction, we will move to the north-east of the English settlements,  and follow the story of the unhappy people of Acadia. Mr. Bancroft has  drawn a touching picture of the homely virtues and obscure happiness of  this rural population before the interference of the British officers  changed their joy into wailing, and endowed their simple annals with a  dark and tragic interest:--         \"After repeated conquests and restorations, the treaty of       Utrecht conceded Acadia, or Nova Scotia, to Great Britain.       Yet the name of Annapolis, the presence of a feeble English       garrison, and the emigration of hardly five or six English       families, were nearly all that marked the supremacy of       England. The old inhabitants remained on the soil which they       had subdued, hardly conscious that they had changed their       sovereign. They still loved the language and the usages of       their forefathers, and their religion was graven upon their       souls. They promised submission to England; but such was the       love with which France had inspired them, they would not       fight against its standard or renounce its name. Though       conquered they were French neutrals. For nearly forty years       from the peace of Utrecht they had been forgotten or       neglected, and had prospered in their seclusion. No       tax-gatherer counted their folds, no magistrate dwelt in       their hamlets. The parish priests made their records and       regulated their successions. Their little disputes were       settled among themselves, with scarcely an instance of an       appeal to English authority at Annapolis. The pastures were       covered with their herds and flocks; and dikes, raised by       extraordinary efforts of social industry,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3536"],[0,"The Enchanted Castle (#17)"],[1," to them the dullest story.    \"Oh, I can tell you that too,\" said Mabel. \"Lord Yalding wanted to  marry a lady his uncle didn't want him to, a barmaid or a ballet  lady or something, and he wouldn't give her up, and his uncle said,  'Well then,' and left everything to the cousin.\"    \"And you say he is not married.\"    \"No the lady went into a convent; I expect she's bricked-up alive  by now.\"    \"Bricked ?\"    \"In a wall, you know,: said Mabel, pointing explainingly at the  pink and gilt roses of the wall-paper, \"shut up to kill them. That's  what they do to you in convents.\"    \"Not at all,\" said Mademoiselle; \"in convents are very kind good  women; there is but one thing in convents that is detestable the  locks on the doors. Sometimes people cannot get out, especially  when they are very young and their relations have placed them  there for their welfare and happiness. But brick how you say it?  enwalling ladies to kill them. No it does itself never. And this lord  he did not then seek his lady?\"    \"Oh, yes he sought her right enough,\" Mabel assured her; \"but  there are millions of convents, you know, and he had no idea  where to look, and they sent back his letters from the post-office,  and \"    \"Ciel!\" cried Mademoiselle, \"but it seems that one knows all in the  housekeeper's saloon.\"    \"Pretty well all,\" said Mabel simply.    \"And you think he will find her? No?\"    \"Oh, he'll find her all right,\" said Mabel, \"when he's old and broken  down, you know and dying; and then a gentle Sister of Charity will  soothe his pillow, and just when he's dying she'll reveal herself and  say: 'My own lost love!' and his face will light up with a wonderful  joy and he'll expire with her beloved name on his parched lips.\"    Mademoiselle's was the silence of sheer astonishment. \"You do the  prophecy, it appears?\" she said at last. \"Oh no,\" said Mabel; \"I got  that out of a book. I can tell you lots more fatal love-stories any  time you like.\"    The French governess gave a little jump, as though she had  suddenly remembered something.    \"It is nearly dinner-time,\" she said. \"Your friend Mabelle, yes will  be your convivial, and in her honour we will make a little feast.  My beautiful flowers  put them to the water, Kathleen. I run to buy  the cakes. Wash the hands, all, and be ready when I return.\"    Smiling and nodding to the children, she left them, and ran up the  stairs.    \"Just as if she was young,\" said Kathleen.    \"She is young,\" said Mabel. \"Heaps of ladies have offers of  marriage when they re no younger than her. I've seen lots of  weddings too, with much older brides. And why didn't you tell me  she was so beautiful?\"    \"Is she?\" asked Kathleen.    \"Of course she is; and what a darling to think of cakes for me, and  calling me a convivial!\"    \"Look here,\" said Gerald, \"I call this jolly decent of her. You  know, governesses never have more than the meanest pittance, just  enough to sustain life, and here she is spending her little all on us.  Supposing we just don't go out today, but play with her instead. I  expect she's most awfully bored really.\"    \"Would she really like it?\" Kathleen wondered. \"Aunt Emily says  grown-ups never really like playing. They do it to please us.    \"They little know,\" Gerald answered, \"how often we do it to please  them.\"    \"We've got to do that dressing-up with the Princess clothes anyhow  we said we would,\" said Kathleen. \"Let's treat her to that.\"    \"Rather near tea-time,\" urged Jimmy, \"so that there'll be a  fortunate interruption and the play won't go on for ever.\"    \"I suppose all the things are safe?\" Mabel asked.    \"Quite. I told you where I put them. Come on, Jimmy; let's help lay  the table. We'll get Eliza to put out the best china.\"    They went.    \"It was lucky,\" said Gerald, struck by a sudden thought, \"that the  burglars didn't go for the diamonds in the treasure-chamber.\"    \"They couldn't,\" said Mabel almost in a whisper; \"they didn't know  about them. I don't believe anybody knows about them, except me  and you, and you're sworn to secrecy. This, you will remember,  had been done almost at the beginning. I know aunt doesn't know.  I just found out the spring by accident. Lord Yalding's kept the  secret well.\"    \"I wish I'd got a secret like that to keep,\" said Gerald. \"If the  burglars do know,\" said Mabel, \"it'll all come out at the trial.  Lawyers make you tell everything you know at trials, and a lot of  lies besides.\"    \"There won't be any trial,\" said Gerald, kicking the leg of the piano  thoughtfully.    \"No trial?\"    \"It said in the paper,\" Gerald went on slowly, \"'The miscreants  must have received warning from a confederate, for the admirable  preparations to arrest them as they returned for their ill-gotten  plunder were unavailing. But the police have a clew.'\"    \"What a pity!\" said Mabel.    \"You needn't worry they haven't got any old clew,\" said Gerald,  still attentive to the piano leg.    \"I didn't mean the clew; I meant the confederate.\"    \"It's a pity you think he's a pity, because he was me,\" said Gerald,  standing up and leaving the piano leg alone. He looked straight  before him, as the boy on the burning deck may have looked.    \"I couldn't help it,\" he said. \"I know you'll think I'm a criminal, but  I couldn't do it. I don't know how detectives can. I went over a  prison once, with father; and after I'd given the tip to Johnson I  remembered that, and I just couldn't. I know I'm a beast, and not  worthy to be a British citizen.\"    \"I think it was rather nice of you,\" said Mabel kindly. \"How did  you warn them?\"    \"I just shoved a paper under the man's door the one that I knew  where he lived to tell him to lie low.\"    \"Oh! do tell me what did you put on it exactly?\" Mabel warmed to  this new interest. \"It said: 'The police know all except your names.  Be virtuous and you are safe. But if there's any more burgling I  shall split and you may rely on that from a friend.' I know it was  wrong, but I couldn't help it. Don't tell the others. They wouldn't  understand why I did it. I don't understand it myself.\"    \"I do, said Mabel: it's because you've got a kind and noble heart.\"    \"Kind fiddlestick, my good child!\" said Gerald, suddenly losing the  burning boy expression and becoming in a flash entirely himself.  \"Cut along and wash your hands; you're as black as ink.\"    \"So are you,\" said Mabel, \"and I'm not. It's dye with me. Auntie  was dyeing a blouse this morning. It told you how in Home Drivel  and she's as black as ink too, and the blouse is all streaky. Pity the  ring won't make just parts of you invisible the dirt, for instance.\"    \"Perhaps,\" Gerald said unexpectedly, \"it won't make even all of  you invisible again.\"    \"Why not? You haven't been doing anything to it have you?\"  Mabel sharply asked.    \"No; but didn't you notice you were invisible twenty-one hours; I  was fourteen hours invisible, and Eliza only seven that's seven less  each time. And now we've come to \"    \"How frightfully good you are at sums!\" said Mabel, awe-struck.    \"You see, it's got seven hours less each time, and seven from seven  is nought; it's got to be something different this time. And then  afterwards it can't be minus seven, because I don't see how  unless  it made you more visible thicker, you know.\"    \"Don't!\" said Mabel; \"you make my head go round.\"    \"And there's another odd thing,\" Gerald went on; \"when you're  invisible your relations don't love you. Look at your aunt, and  Cathy never turning a hair at me going burgling. We haven't got to  the bottom of that ring yet. Crikey! here's Mademoiselle with the  cakes. Run, bold bandits wash for your lives!\"    They ran    It was not cakes only; it was plums and grapes and jam tarts and  soda-water and raspberry vinegar, and chocolates in pretty boxes  and pure, thick, rich cream in brown jugs, also a big bunch of  roses. Mademoiselle was strangely merry for a governess. She  served out the cakes and tarts with a liberal hand, made wreaths of  the flowers for all their heads she was not eating much herself  drank the health of Mabel, as the guest of the day, in the beautiful  pink drink that comes from mixing raspberry vinegar and  soda-water, and actually persuaded Jimmy to wear his wreath, on  the ground that the Greek gods as well as the goddesses always  wore wreaths at a feast.    There never was such a feast provided by any French governess  since French governesses began. There were jokes and stories and  laughter. Jimmy showed all those tricks with forks and corks and  matches and apples which are so deservedly popular.  Mademoiselle told them stories of her own schooldays when she  was \"a quite little girl with two tight tresses  so\", and when they  could not understand the tresses, called for paper and pencil and  drew the loveliest little picture of herself when she was a child  with two short fat pig-tails sticking out from her head like  knitting-needles from a ball of dark worsted. Then she drew  pictures of everything they asked for, till Mabel pulled Gerald's  jacket and whispered: \"The acting!\"    \"Draw us the front of a theatre,\" said Gerald tactfully \"a French  theatre.\"    \"They are the same thing as the English theatres,\" Mademoiselle  told him.    \"Do you like acting the theatre, I mean?\"    \"But yes I love it.\"    \"All right,\" said Gerald briefly. \"We'll act a play for you now this  afternoon if you like.\"    \"Eliza will be washing up,\" Cathy whispered, \"and she was  promised to see it.\"    \"Or this evening,\" said Gerald \"and please, Mademoiselle, may  Eliza come in and look on?\"    \"But certainly,\" said Mademoiselle; \"amuse yourselves well, my  children.\"    \"But it's you,\" said Mabel suddenly, \"that we want to amuse.  Because we love you very much don't we, all of you?\"    \"Yes,\" the chorus came unhesitatingly. Though the others would  never have thought of saying such a thing on their own account.  Yet, as Mabel said it, they found to their"]]]
