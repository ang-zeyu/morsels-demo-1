THE STREETS.      You have seen how the wall surrounded Roman London. The same wall which  defended and limited Augusta defended and limited Plantagenet London.  Outside the wall on the east there continued to extend wide marshes  along the river; moorlands and forest on the north; marshes with rising  ground on the west; marshes on the south. Wapping was called Wapping in  the Wose (Wash or Ouze), meaning in the Marsh: Bermondsey was Bermond's  Island, standing in the marsh: Battersea was Batter's Island, or perhaps  Island of Boats: Chelsea was the Island of Chesel or Shingle:  Westminster Abbey was built on the Isle of Thorns. The monasteries  standing outside the wall attracted a certain number of serving people  who built houses round them: some of the riverside folk--boat-builders,  lightermen, and so forth--were living in the precinct of St. Katharine,  just outside the Tower: all along the Strand were great men's houses,  one of which, the Somerset House, still stands in altered form, and  another, Northumberland House, was only pulled down a few years ago.  Southwark had a single main street with a few branches east and west: it  also contained several great houses, and was provided with many Inns for  the use of those who brought their goods from Kent and Surrey to London  Market. It was also admitted as a ward. On either side of the High  Street lay marshes. The river was banked--hence the name Bank Side--but  it is not known at what time.    That part of the wall fronting the river had long been pulled down, but  the stairs were guarded with iron chains, and there was a river police  which rowed about among the shipping at night.    [Illustration: CHEPE IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.]    The streets and lanes of London within the walls were very nearly the  same as they are at present, except for the great thoroughfares  constructed within the last thirty years. That is to say, when one  entered at Lud Gate and passed through Paul's Churchyard, he found  himself in the broad street, the market place of the City, known as  Chepe. This continued to the place where the Royal Exchange now stands,  where it broke off into two branches, Cornhill and Lombard Street.  These respectively led into Leadenhall Street and Fenchurch Street,  which united again before Aldgate. Another leading thoroughfare crossed  the City from London Bridge to Bishopsgate, and another, Thames Street,  by far the most important, because here the merchant adventurers--those  who had ships and imported goods--met for the transaction of business.  The rough cobbled pavement of Thames Street was the Exchange of  Whittington and the merchants of his time, who all had their houses on  the rising ground, among the narrow lanes north of the street. You have  seen what splendid houses a London merchant loved to build. What kind of  house did the retailer and the craftsman occupy? It was of stone in the  lower parts, but the upper storey was generally of wood, and the roof  was too often thatched. The window was glazed in the upper part, but had  open work and shutter for the lower half: this half, with the door,  stood open during the greater part of the year. The lower room was the  living room, and sometimes the work room of the occupant. The upper  floor contained the bed rooms. There was but one fireplace in the  house--that in the living room. At the back of the house was generally a  small garden. But, besides these houses, there were courts dark, narrow,  noisome, where the huts were still 'wattle and daub,' that is, built  with posts, the sides filled in with branches or sticks and clay or mud,  the fire in the middle of the floor, the chimney overhead. And still, as  in Saxon times, the great danger to the City was from fire.    Men of the same trade still congregated together for convenience. When  all lived together the output would be regulated, prices maintained, and  wages agreed upon. Nothing was more hateful to the mediaeval trader than  forestalling and regrating. To forestall was to buy things before they  arrived at market with intent to sell at a higher price. To regrate was  to buy up in the market and sell again in the same market at an advanced  price. To undersell your neighbour was then also an unpardonable crime.  You discover, therefore, that trade in Plantagenet London was not like  trade in Victorian London. Then, all men of the same trade stood by each  other and were brothers: now, too often, men of the same trade are  enemies.    The names of streets show the nature of the trades carried on in them.  Turners and makers of wooden cups and platters, Wood Street:  ironmongers, in their Lane: poultry sellers, the Poultry: bakers, Bread  Street: and so on. Chepe was the great retail market of the City. It was  built over gradually, but in early times it was a broad market covered  with stalls, like the market-place of Norwich, for instance; these  stalls were ranged in lines and streets: churches stood about among the  lines. Then the stalls, which had been temporary wooden structures, were  changed into permanent shops, which were also the houses of the tenants:  the living room and kitchen were behind the shop: the master and his  family slept above, and the prentices slept under the counter.

The story of Dick Whittington has been a favourite legend for many  generations. The boy coming up to London poor and friendless; lying  despairing on the green slope of Highgate; resolved to return to the  country since he can find no work in London: the falling upon his ears  of the bells of Bow, wafted across the fields by the south wind--every  child knows all this. What did the bells say to him--the soft and  mellow bells, calling to him across four miles of fields? 'Turn again,  Whittington--Turn again, Whittington--Lord Mayor of London--Turn again,  Whittington.' He did turn, as we know, and became not once, but four  times Lord Mayor of London and entertained kings, and was the richest  merchant of his time. And all through a cat--we know how the cat began  his fortune.    That is the familiar legend. Now you shall learn the truth.    There was a Dick Whittington: and he was Lord Mayor of London--to be  accurate, he was Mayor of London, for the title of Lord Mayor did not  yet exist.    He was not a poor and friendless lad by any means. He belonged to a good  family, his father, Sir William Whittington, Knight, being owner of an  estate in Herefordshire called Soler's Hope, and one in Gloucestershire  called Pauntley. The father was buried at Pauntley Church, where his  shield may still be seen. Richard was the youngest of three sons of whom  the eldest, William, died without children: and the second, Robert, had  sons of whom one, Guy, fought at Agincourt. From the second son there  are descendants to this day.    Richard, at the age of fourteen, was sent to London, where he had  connections. Many country people had connections in London who were  merchants. Remember that in those days it would be impossible for a boy  to rise from poverty to wealth and distinction by trade. Such a lad  might rise in the church, or even, but I know not of any instance, by  distinguished valour on the field of battle. Most certainly, he would be  prenticed to a craft and a craftsman he would remain all his life.  Whittington was a gentleman: that was the first and necessary condition  to promotion: he came to London, not to learn a craft at all, but to be  apprenticed to his cousin Sir John Fitzwarren, Mercer and Merchant  Adventurer. The Mercers were the richest and most important company in  London: the merchant adventurers were those--the foremost among the  Mercers--who owned ships which they despatched abroad with exports and  with which they imported stuffs and merchandise to the Port of London.  Whittington's master may have had a shop or stall in Chepe--but he was a  great importer of silks, satins, cloth of gold, velvets, embroideries,  precious stones, and all splendid materials required for an age of  splendid costume.    [Illustration: A SEA-FIGHT.    (_From the 'Life of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick'; drawn by John  Rous about 1485._)]    What is the meaning of the 'cat' story? Immediately after Whittington's  death the story was spread about. When his executors repaired Newgate  they placed a carven cat on the outside: when Whittington's nephews, a  few years later, built a house in Gloucester they placed a carven cat  over the door in recognition of the story. All sorts of explanations  have been offered. First, that there never was any cat at all. Next,  that by a 'cat' is meant a kind of ship, a collier. Thirdly, that the  cat is symbolical and means something else. Why need we go out of our  way at all? A cat at that time was a valuable animal: not by any means  common: in certain countries where rats were a nuisance a cat was very  valuable indeed. Why should not the lad entrust a kitten to one of his  master's skippers with instructions to sell it for him in any Levantine  port at which the vessel might touch? Then he would naturally ever  afterwards refer to the sale of the cat, the first venture of his own,  as the beginning and foundation of his fortune. But you must believe  about the cat whatever you please. The story has been told of other men.  There was a Portuguese sailor, named Alphonso, who was wrecked on the  Coast of Guinea. He carried a cat safely ashore and sold her to the  King for her weight in gold: with this for his first capital he rapidly  made a large fortune. Again, one Diego Almagro, a companion of Pizarro,  bought the first cat ever taken to South America for 600 pieces of  eight. And the"]]]
