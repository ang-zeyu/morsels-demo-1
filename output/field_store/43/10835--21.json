[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31529"],[0,"Modern marriage and how to bear it (#17)"],[1," extremely rude to each other, when necessary for the purposes of  argument. On this particular occasion, the inevitable marriage  discussion, which is always to be found in one or other of the  newspapers, was the subject of conversation, and the Good Stockbroker  (unmarried) was vigorously defending the Holy Estate. His moral attitude  is certainly somewhat boring, but nevertheless the Good Stockbroker is  one of those people to whom one really is polite. Although obvious  irritation was visible on the face of the Family Egotist we listened  respectfully, with the exception of the Wicked Stockbroker, whose dinner  was far too important in his scheme of life to be trifled with by moral  conversations.    Whatever the Good Stockbroker says the Weary Roue is of course bound to  contradict as a matter of honour. I may mention that the Weary Roue is a  man of the highest virtue and a model husband and father. His pose of  evil experience has gained him his sarcastic nickname, but in no way has  he earned it by his conduct. 'You forget,' he interposed languidly, when  the Good Stockbroker paused, 'that no less a philosopher than  Schopenhauer said that the natural tendency of man is towards polygamy,  and of woman towards monogamy.'    'I deny the first statement,' said the Good Stockbroker heatedly. He was  always heated where questions of morality were concerned, and was  proceeding to give chapter and verse for what promised to become a  somewhat dull discussion when the Bluestocking firmly interposed in her  small staccato pipe:    'To hear you, one would suppose monogamic marriage was a divine  institution.'    'Absurd, isn't it?' grinned the Weary Roue. The Good Stockbroker looked  pained and cleared his throat. At this formidable signal, the Family  Egotist--whose irritation had been increasing like the alleged  circulation of a newspaper--showed every sign of hurling the boomerang  of his opinion into the fray. This would have meant the death of all  liveliness for some hours to come, and a general sigh had begun to  heave, when once more our brave Bluestocking stemmed the tide.    'You make rather a cult of the Bible,' she quacked scornfully, directing  her remarks principally at the Good Stockbroker; 'but you don't seem  very conversant with the Old Testament. You will find there ample proof  that monogamic marriage is no more divine than--than polygamy or free  love. Nor has it any celestial origin, since it varies with race and  climate. It is simply an indispensable social safeguard.'    'I'll have a shilling each way on it,' murmured the Ass (an incorrigible  youth, quite the Winston Churchill of our family cabinet), using his  customary formula. Unheeding, the Bluestocking chirruped on severely:  'You must know, if you have ever studied sociology, that marriage is  essentially a _social contract_, primarily based on selfishness. At  present it still retains its semi-barbarous form, and those who preach  without reason of its alleged sacredness would be better employed in  suggesting how the savage code now in vogue can be modified to meet the  necessities of modern civilisation.'    She paused for breath. The Good Stockbroker was pale, but faced her  manfully. 'Well done, Bluestocking!' said the Weary Roue. 'Wonderful  woman, our Quacker,' said the Ass, 'I'll have a shilling each way on  her.' The Wicked Stockbroker took a second helping of salad, and ate on  unheeding, whilst the Gentle Lady at the head of the table anxiously  watched the Family Egotist, who looked apoplectic and was toying  truculently with a wineglass with evident danger of shortening its  career of usefulness.    'I was taught,' said the Good Stockbroker slowly, 'to regard marriage as  a sacred institution--a holy mystery.'    'Then you were taught rot,' snapped the Bluestocking, thus living up to  the worst traditions of the polite dinner-table, and quivering with  intellectual fury.    'Recrimination--' began the Good Stockbroker.    ('Good word that, I'll have a shilling each way on it,' murmured the  Ass.)    '--is not argument,' continued the Good Stockbroker.    'It may not be, but what you said was _rot_,' replied the Bluestocking,  '\"a holy mystery, instituted in the time of man's innocency\"--I  recognise the quotation! And when was that time, pray? Are you referring  to the Garden of Eden, or to what part of the Bible? The chosen people,  the Hebrews, were polygamists from the time of Lamech, evidently with  the approval of the Deity. Even the immaculate David had thirteen wives,  and the saintly Solomon a clear thousand. Not much of a holy mystery in  those days, eh?'    'Dear Bluestocking, you really _are_--' murmured the Gentle Lady.    'Not at all; she's perfectly sound,' interposed the Weary Roue, gloating  with ghoulish joy over the Good Stockbroker's apparent discomfort.    'I give in,' said the latter, and a yell of joy burst from the Ass and  the Weary Roue. 'I really cannot argue against a lady of such  overwhelming eloquence,' he continued, bowing in his delightful courtly  way. 'All the same, I shall always believe that marriage is a holy  institution.'    'My dear old chap,' said the Weary Roue, hastily, with one eye on the  Family Egotist, who was certainly being treated badly that evening:  'your high-mindedness is admirable, quite admirable, but it won't work;  it doesn't fit into modern conditions. Theoretically, Marriage is a Holy  Mystery no doubt--in practice it's apt to be an Unholy Muddle, sometimes  a Mess. Personally I believe in polygamy.'    Roars of laughter were stifled in their birth, as we thought of the  Weary Roue's circumspect spouse, and his several circumspect children,  discreet from birth upwards.    'So do I--a shilling each way,' said the Ass, inevitably.    'Not for myself, of course,' continued the Weary Roue, without a trace  of a smile, 'that is to say, not--er--not now, but speaking for the  majority and--er, in the abstract, polygamy would be a sensible  institution. Just think how it would simplify all our modern  complications, how it would mend our two worst social evils.'    'Yes, _think_, please--thinking will do,' interposed the Gentle Lady,  hastily.    'How it would solve the superfluous woman question,' continued the Weary  Roue, enthusiastically. 'Think of the enormous number of miserable  spinsters who would be happily provided for.' An indignant quack came  from the Bluestocking.    'Think of the expense,' remarked the Good Stockbroker, dryly, and the  Weary Roue collapsed like a pricked gas-bag.    'Herbert Spencer says,' continued the Good Stockbroker, 'that the  tendency to monogamy is innate, and all the other forms of marriage have  been temporary deviations, each bringing their own retributive evils.  After all, monogamous marriage was instituted for the protection of  women, and has been held sacred in the great and noble ages of the  world. Quite apart from the moral point of view, however, polygamy could  only be possible in a tropical climate, where the necessities of life  were reduced to a minimum, and one could live on dates and rice, but as  the average man in our glorious Free Trade country can't afford to keep  one wife, in decent comfort, let alone several--I ask, how in the name  of the bank rate--?'    'You stockbroking chaps are so devilish sordid,' returned the Weary  Roue. 'Didn't I say _in the abstract_? Of course I know it wouldn't do  practically, not yet anyway, but honestly I believe it would go far to  solve the whole sex problem.'    'You neither of you seem to take the woman into consideration at all,'  piped the Bluestocking. 'Do you suppose we modern women with our  resources and our education would consider such an idea for a moment?'    'Well, what do you think?' asked the Weary Roue, with diplomatic  deference.    To our surprise the Bluestocking began to blush, and her blush is not  the coy, irresponsible flushing of an ordinary girl, but a painful rush  of blood to the face under stress of deep earnestness, the kind of blush  which forces one to look away.    'Well,' she said, with a gulp, 'I think, perhaps--they might.' It was  obvious the admission had cost her something. We were all dumfounded.  The Family Egotist forgot his burning desire for speech and ceased to  threaten his wineglass; the Gentle Lady was quite excited; the Weary  Roue became almost alert, and the Good Stockbroker looked as if he were  about to burst into tears.    'I think women might not be averse from polygamy--as a choice of evils,'  continued the little Bluestocking bravely, 'for the present waste of  womanhood in this country is a very serious evil. Of course the  financial conditions make it impossible, as the Good Stockbroker says,  but if it _were_ possible, if it were instituted for highest motives,  and in an entirely honourable, open manner authorised and sanctioned by  the--er--the proper people--I think women could concur in it without any  loss of self-respect, especially if the first ardent love of youth were  over. After that, and when a woman forgets herself, having truly found  herself, in the love and care of her children and a larger view of life  and its duties--then I think most women could be happy in such  circumstances. I think a great deal of utterly untrue stuff is talked  about the agony of sexual jealousy, and women's jealousy especially.  Men may suffer thus, I can't say, but I'm sure women don't. It's the  humiliation, the unkindness, the _being deceived_ and supplanted that  hurts so when a man is unfaithful. But if it were all fair and  above-board, if it were grasped that polygamy is more suited to men's  nature, and more likely to make for the happiness of the greatest number  of women--their numerical strength being so far in advance of men that  they couldn't possibly expect to have a mate each--then I really think,  after women had had time to readjust their ideas to this new  condition--it may take a generation or "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31534"],[0,"Fifty-Two Sunday Dinners: A Book of Recipes (#17)"],[1,"with triangles of buttered toast sprinkled with  finely chopped parsley.
