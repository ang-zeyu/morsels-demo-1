At other seasons and in other places, many of them  were found in a vertical position but practically all had their bodies  toward the wind prevailing at the time. The observers were unable to  ascertain definitely whether the insects thus oriented themselves at  the time of alighting, so that their wings presented the least  resistance to the force of the wind, or whether this was a mechanical  result of the breezes.       =The Great Southern White=    _Pontia monuste_    There used to be in the Northern states before the advent of the  Imported Cabbage butterfly a familiar white butterfly which then laid  its eggs upon cabbages in much the same way that the imported pest now  does. One who has seen this northern Gray-veined White and then sees  the Great Southern White will be likely to think of the latter as a  larger edition of the former, for in the males of the southern species  the wings are practically white save for a narrow dusky border at the  outer angle of the front pair, although in the female this dusky  margin is wider and the hind wings show a series of dusky triangles  near the margin. There is also a curious black marking suggestive of a  crescent on each front wing near the middle of the front border, which  helps to make the appearance of this butterfly very distinct from that  of any other.    Although this species is at times so abundant that it swarms in great  flocks and although it has been known for many years, its life-history  seems not to have been carefully worked out since it was first  described by Abbott more than a century ago. The caterpillars feed  upon cruciferous plants and when full grown are about an inch and a  half long, of a general yellow color, more or less striped with  purple lines. The species is distinctly tropical extending northward  into our Southern states.    Dr. G. B. Longstaff reports this species as abundant in Jamaica where  he found that the clubs of the antennae of the living insects showed a  beautiful turquoise blue color, although another observer described  them as bright green with a tinge of blue. This is an interesting  color variation for a member of this group. In the tropics also there  are two forms, one belonging to the dry season and one to the wet  season.      _Synopsis of the Whites_    _Imported Cabbage Butterfly_ (_Pieris rapae_). Expanse 2 inches. Upper  surface white with a black marginal dash on the front outer angle of  the front wing. One round black spot on each of the four wings in the  male. Two round spots on each of the front wings in the female and one  round spot on each of the hind wings. Under surface of hind wings  yellowish white; spots on front wings in same position as on upper  surface. A spring form (_immaculata_) is smaller and the black spots  are almost obsolete.    _Gray-veined White_ (_Pieris napi_). Expanse 2 inches. Upper surface  white with only a darker marginal splash next the body. Under surface  white with gray veins.    _Checkered White_ (_Pontia protodice_ or _Pieris protodice_). Expanse  2 inches. Upper surface white, strongly marked especially in the  female with dark grayish brown on both pairs of wings. Along the outer  margins these marks are so arranged as to enclose white diamond spots.  Male with front wings only lightly marked and hind wings scarcely  marked at all. Under surface much like upper, with a slight yellowish  tinge in female.    _Great Southern White_ (_Pontia monuste_ or _Pieris phileta_.) Expanse  2 1/2 inches. General color white with a narrow black margin around  apical angle of front wings. These margins are wider in the female, in  which sex there is a series of marginal spots on the hind wings.  Easily known by its large size.          THE TRIBE OF THE ORANGE-TIPS      When one sees a gossamer-winged butterfly flitting from flower to  flower on a bright June day it seems one of the most ethereal of  earth's visions. One could readily fancy that the whole  sight--flowers, butterflies, and all--might easily vanish into thin  air. So it is something of a shock to hear scientists talk about  fossil butterflies and to realize that these fragile creatures have  been living generation after generation for untold millions of years.  A realization of this fact, however, helps us to understand the many  wonderful ways in which butterflies in all stages of their existence  have become adapted to the conditions of their lives.    There is perhaps no group of butterflies whose beauty seems more  fragile than that of the Orange-tips. These are delicate creatures,  with slender bodies and almost gauzy wings, of a size somewhat smaller  than our common white and yellow butterflies. Perhaps the most  remarkable feature is the marking of the wings, the upper sides of the  front pair having an orange patch near the apex and the under sides  having a background of delicate whitish or yellowish green, lined and  spotted with darker coloring in a very characteristic way. This  peculiar marking is so significant that it has been called \"flower  picturing.\" To understand the reason for its existence one has only to  watch the butterflies in their native haunts. He will find them  flitting from blossom to blossom among the plants of the mustard  family--the _Cruciferae_. This is one of the most characteristic  families in the plant world: the foliage for the most part is small  and delicate and the flowers have a characteristic four-petaled  structure, being practically always of small size and generally toned  in whites or yellows. When an Orange-tip is at rest upon these  blossoms it merges so completely into the background that it  disappears from view. Should a bird chase one of these insects through  the air it would see chiefly the orange tips which are so marked upon  the upper side of the wing, and when the butterfly closed its wings  and lighted among the flowers the orange color would instantly  disappear and there would be only an almost invisible surface against  the background of flower and leaf.    The adaptations of these Orange-tips to the conditions of their lives  are by no means confined to this remarkable resemblance to the flowery  background. In the case of some species the whole yearly cycle has  been adapted to correspond to the yearly history of the cruciferous  food plant. As is well known many species of the mustard family spring  up early in the season, put forth their blossoms which quickly develop  into fruits and then die down, the species being carried through until  the next year by the dormant seeds. In a similar way the Orange-tips  feed as caterpillars upon the host plant through the spring,  completing their growth before the plant dies and then changing to  chrysalids which remain dormant through summer, fall, and winter and  come forth as butterflies early the following spring. The insect has  thus adapted itself in a most remarkable manner to the yearly history  of its plant host.       =The Falcate Orange-tip=    _Synchloe genutia_    The Falcate Orange-tip is about the only member of this tribe  generally distributed east of the Rocky Mountains. This is a beautiful  insect which is sparingly found even as far north as New England. It  is more abundant throughout the Southern states, occurring south at  least as far as Texas. It appears to be a good illustration of the  adaptation of its development to that of its food plants. The eggs are  laid upon leaves or stems of such spring-flowering _Cruciferae_ as  rock cress (_Arabis_), and hedge mustard (_Sisymbrium_). On hatching  the caterpillars feed upon stems, leaves, flowers, and even seed pods  of these plants, becoming mature in a few weeks and changing to  chrysalids under the protection of such shelter as they can find. In  the Northern states these chrysalids remain unchanged until the  following spring when the butterflies emerge and are found upon the  wing for a few weeks in May and early June. In some southern regions  at least the species is evidently double-brooded, as Dr. Holland  reports that he has taken the butterflies in late autumn in the  western portion of North Carolina.       [Illustration: Egg of _Synchloe genutia_, magnified 20       diameters. (From Holland)]    This Falcate Orange-tip is one of the daintiest and most exquisite of  northern butterflies. It is a prize which any collector will find joy  in possessing. It is easily recognized by its general white color,  which in the female is relieved only by a distinct black mark on the  upper surface of the front wings and a row of marginal markings upon  all the wings. The male is slightly smaller and is at once known by  the orange blotch on the outer angle of the upper surface of the front  wing. This outer angle projects into a distinct point which gives the  species its name Falcate. (_See plate, page 256._)    Dr. J. L. Hancock has described in a most interesting manner the way  in which this Orange-tip loses itself among the flowers of rock cress.  In northern Indiana he found this butterfly abundant in April at the  time of the blossoming of _Arabis lyrata_. The butterflies would be  flying about, easily seen in the air. Then they would suddenly  disappear and could be found only after the most careful search. They  had simply lit upon the flower heads, when the flower picturing of the  under surface of the wings blended perfectly with the appearance of  the clustered flower.    \"The green markings of the under side of the wing,\" writes Dr.  Hancock, \"are so arranged as to divide the ground color into patches  of white, which blend with or simulate perfectly the petals of the  clustered flowers. The eyes of the butterfly are delicate pale green  and the antennae are whitish, all of which adds to the effectiveness  of the blend. The flowers of _Arabis_ have white petals with the  centre yellowish green, as is also the calyx."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3708"],[0,"An Introduction to Chemical Science (#17)"],[1," are not quite so strong as  those of Cl. Its affinity for H and for metals is also strongly  marked. A drop of Br on the skin produces a sore slow to heal.  Bromine salts are mainly KBr, NaBr, MgBr2. These in small  quantities accompany NaCl, and are most common in brine springs.  The world's supply of Br comes chiefly from West Virginia and  Ohio, over 300,000 pounds being produced from the salt (NaCl)  wells there in 1884. The water taken from these wells is nearly  evaporated, after which NaCl crystallizes out, leaving a thick  liquid--bittern, or mother liquor--which contains the salts of  Br. The bittern is treated with H2SO4 and Mn02, as above.    For transportation in large quantities, Br has to be made into  the salts NaBr and KBr, on account of the danger attending  leakage or breakage of the receptacles for Br.    160. Uses.--Its chief uses are in photography (page 167),  medicine, as KBr, and analytical chemistry.    Chapter XXXII.    IODINE.    Examine iodine, potassium iodide.    161. Preparation of I.    Experiment 98.--Put into a t.t. 2 or 3 g. of powdered KI mixed  with an equal bulk of MnO2, add H2SO4 enough to cover well, shake  together, complete the apparatus as for making Br, and heat.  Notice the color of the vapor, and any sublimate. The direct  product of the solidification of a vapor is called a sublimate.  The process is sublimation. Observe any crystals formed. Write  the reaction, and compare the process with that for making Br and  Cl. Compare the vapor density of I with that of Br and of Cl.  With that of air. What vapor is heavier than I? What acid and  what base are represented by KI?    162. Tests.    Experiment 99.--(1) Put a crystal of I in the palm of the hand  and watch it for a minute. (2) Put 2 or 3 crystals into a t.t.,  and warm it, meanwhile holding a stirring-rod half-way down the  tube. Notice the vapor, also a sublimate on the sides of the t.t.  and rod. (3) Add to 2 or 3 crystals in a t.t. 5 cc. of alcohol,  C2H5OH; warm it, and see whether a solution is formed. If so, add  5 cc. H2O and look for a ppt. of I. Does this show that I is not  at all soluble in H2O, or not so soluble as in alcohol?    163. Starch Solution and Iodine Test.    Experiment 100.--Pulverize a gram or two of starch, put it into  an evaporating-dish, add 4 or 5 drops of water, and mix; then  heat to the boiling-point 10 cc. H2O in a t.t., and pour it over  the starch, stirring it meanwhile.    (1) Dip into this starch paste a piece of paper, hold it in the  vapor of I, and look for a change of color. (2) Pour a drop of  the starch paste into a clean t.t., and add a drop or two of the  solution of I in alcohol. Add 5 cc. H2O, note the color, then  boil, and finally cool. (3) The presence of starch in a potato or  apple can be shown by putting a drop of I solution in alcohol on  a slice of either, and observing the color. (4) Try to dissolve a  few crystals of I in 5 cc. H2O by boiling. If it does not  disappear, see whether any has dissolved, by touching a drop of  the water to starch paste. This should show that I is slightly  soluble in water.    164. Iodo-Starch Paper.    Experiment 101.--Add to some starch paste that contains no I 5  cc. of a solution of KI, and stir the mixture. Why is it not  colored blue? Dip into this several strips of paper, dry them,  and save for use. This paper is called iodo-starch paper, and is  used as a test for ozone, chlorine, etc. Bring a piece of it in  contact with the vapor of chlorine, bromine, or ozone, and notice  the blue color.    Experiment 102.--Add a few drops of chlorine water to 2cc. of the  starch and KI solution in 10 cc. H2O. This should show the same  effect as the previous experiment.    165. Explanation.--Only free I, not compounds of it, will color  starch blue. It must first be set free from KI. Ozone, chlorine,  etc., have a strong affinity for K, and when brought in contact  with KI they unite with K and set free I, which then acts on the  starch present. Com- plete the equation: KI + Cl = ?    166. Occurrence.--The ultimate source of I is sea water, of which  it constitutes far too small a percentage to be separated  artificially. Sea-weeds, or algae, especially those growing in  the deep sea, absorb its salts--NaI, KI, etc.--from the water. It  thus forms a part of the plant, and from this much of the I of  commerce is obtained. Algae are collected in the spring, on the  coasts of Ireland, Scotland, and Normandy, where rough weather  throws them up. They are dried, and finally burned or distilled;  the ashes are leached to dissolve I salts; the water is nearly  evaporated, and the residue is treated with H2SO4, and MnO2, as  in the case of Br and Cl. I also occurs in Chili, as NaI and  NaIO3, mixed with NaNO3. This is an important source of the I  supply.    167. Uses.--I is much used in medicine, and was formerly employed  in taking daguerreotypes and photographs. Its solution in alcohol  or in ether is known as tincture of iodine.    168. Fluorine.--F, Cl, Br, I, are called halogens or haloids, and  exist in compounds--salts--in sea water. F is the most active of  all elements, combining with every element except O. Until  recently it has never been isolated, for as soon as set free from  one compound it attacks the nearest substance, and seems to be as  much averse to combining with itself, or to existing in the  elementary state, as to uniting with O. It is supposed to be a  gas, and, as is claimed, has lately been isolated by electrolysis  from HF in a Pt U-tube. Fluorite (CaF2) and cryolite (Al2F6 + 6  NaF) are its two principal mineral sources. The enamel of the  teeth contains F in composition.    CHAPTER XXXIII.    THE HALOGENS.    169. Halogens Compared.--The elements F, Cl, Br, I, form a  natural group. Their properties, as well as those of their  compounds, vary in a step-by-step way, as seen below. F is  sometimes an exception. They are best remembered by comparing  them with one another. Notice:    1. Similarity of name-ending. Each name ends in ine.    2. Similarity of origin. Salt water is the ultimate source of  all, except F.    3. Similarity of valence. Each is usually a monad.    4. Similarity of preparation. Cl, Br, I, are obtained from their  salts by means of MnO2 end H2SO4.    5. Variation in occurrence. Cl occurs in sea-salt, Br in sea-  water, I in sea-weed.    6. Variation in color; F being colorless, Cl green, Br red, I  violet.    7. Gradation in sp. gr.; F 19, Cl 35.5, Br 80, I 127.    8. Gradation in state, corresponding to sp. gr.; F being a light  gas, Cl a heavy gas, Br a liquid, I a solid.    9. Corresponding gradation in their usual chemical activity; F  being most active, then Cl, Br, and I.    10. Corresponding gradation in the strength of the H acids; the  strongest being HF, the next, HCl, etc.    11. Corresponding gradation in the explosibility of their N  compounds; the strongest NCl3, the next, NBr3, etc.    12. Corresponding gradation in the number of H and O acids; Cl 4,  Br 3, I 2.    170. Compounds.--The following are some of the oxides, acids, and  salts of the halogens. Name them.      CI2O (+H2O=) 2 HClO. The salts are hypochlorites, as Ca(ClO)2.  Cl2O3 (+H20=) 2 HClO2. The salts are chlorites, as KClO2.  Cl2O4  -- HClO3 The salts are chlorates, as KClO3.  -- HClO4 The salts are perchlorates, as KClO4,  -- HBrO The salts are ? KBrO,  -- -- The salts are wanting.  -- HBrO3. The salts are ? KBrO3,  -- HBrO4. The salts are ? KBrO4,  -- -- The salts are wanting.  -- -- The salts are wanting.  I2O5 (+H2O=) 2 HIO3. The salts are ? KIO3.  -- HIO4. The salts are ? KIO4.      F forms no oxides, and no acids except HF. HF, HCl, HBr, HI, are  striking illustrations of acids with no O. HClO4 is a very strong  oxidizing agent. A drop of it will set paper on fire, or with  powdered charcoal explode violently. This is owing to the ease  with which it gives up 0. Notice why its molecule is broken up  more readily than HC103. The higher the molecular tower, or the  more atoms it contains, the greater its liability to fall. Some  organic compounds contain hundreds of atoms, and hence are easily  broken down, or, as we say, are unstable. Inorganic compounds  are, as a rule, much more stable than organic ones. It is not  always true, however, that the compound with the least number of  atoms is the most stable. SO2 is more stable than SO3, but H2SO3  is less so than H2SO4.  Chapter XXXIV.    VAPOR DENSITY AND MOLECULAR WEIGHT.    Examine a liter measure, in the form of a cube,--cubic decimeter,  --and a cubic centimeter.    171. Gaseous Weights and Volumes.--A liter of  H, at 0 degrees  and 760 mm., weighs nearly 0.09 g. This weight is called a crith.  Find the weight of H in the following, in criths and in grams: 15  1., 0.07 1., 50.3 1., 0.035 1., 0.6 1..    It has been estimated that there are (10) 24. molecules of H in a  liter. Does the number vary for different gases? The weight of a  molecule of H in parts of a crith is 1/(10) 24.; in parts of a  gram .09/(10) 24.. If the H molecule is composed of 2 atoms, what  is the weight of its atom in fractions of a crith? What in  fractions of a gram? The weight of the H atom is a microcrith.  What part of a crith is a microcrith?    172. Vapor Density.--Vapor density, or specific gravity referred  to H as the standard, (Physics) is the ratio of the weight of a  given volume of a gas or vapor to the weight of the same volume  of H. A liter of steam weighs nine times as much as a liter of H.  Its vapor density is therefore nine. For convenience, a definite  volume of H is usually taken as the standard, viz., the H atom.  The volume of the H atom and that of the half-molecule of H2O, or  of any gas are identical, each being represented by one square.  If, then, the standard of vapor density is the H atom, half the  molecular weight of a gas must be its vapor density, since it is  evident that we thus compare the weights of equal volumes.
