He may be living and suffering, and  every night I dream that he has come home and when I wake up and find  it's only a dream it just breaks my heart.\"    \"It's ever so much worse than when he was so sick last fall,\" said  Cecily drearily. \"Then we knew that everything was done for him that  could be done.\"    We could not appeal to Peg Bowen this time. In our desperation we would  have done it, but Peg was far away. With the first breath of spring she  was up and off, answering to the lure of the long road. She had not  been seen in her accustomed haunts for many a day. Her pets were gaining  their own living in the woods and her house was locked up.          CHAPTER XI. THE WITCH'S WISHBONE      When a fortnight had elapsed we gave up all hope.    \"Pat is dead,\" said the Story Girl hopelessly, as we returned one  evening from a bootless quest to Andrew Cowan's where a strange gray  cat had been reported--a cat which turned out to be a yellowish brown  nondescript, with no tail to speak of.    \"I'm afraid so,\" I acknowledged at last.    \"If only Peg Bowen had been at home she could have found him for us,\"  asserted Peter. \"Her skull would have told her where he was.\"    \"I wonder if the wishbone she gave me would have done any good,\" cried  Cecily suddenly. \"I'd forgotten all about it. Oh, do you suppose it's  too late yet?\"    \"There's nothing in a wishbone,\" said Dan impatiently.    \"You can't be sure. She TOLD me I'd get the wish I made on it. I'm going  to try whenever I get home.\"    \"It can't do any harm, anyhow,\" said Peter, \"but I'm afraid you've left  it too late. If Pat is dead even a witch's wishbone can't bring him back  to life.\"    \"I'll never forgive myself for not thinking about it before,\" mourned  Cecily.    As soon as we got home she flew to the little box upstairs where she  kept her treasures, and brought therefrom the dry and brittle wishbone.    \"Peg told me how it must be done. I'm to hold the wishbone with both  hands, like this, and walk backward, repeating the wish nine times. And  when I've finished the ninth time I'm to turn around nine times, from  right to left, and then the wish will come true right away.\"    \"Do you expect to see Pat when you finish turning?\" said Dan  skeptically.    None of us had any faith in the incantation except Peter, and, by  infection, Cecily. You never could tell what might happen. Cecily  took the wishbone in her trembling little hands and began her backward  pacing, repeating solemnly, \"I wish that we may find Paddy alive, or  else his body, so that we can bury him decently.\" By the time Cecily  had repeated this nine times we were all slightly infected with the  desperate hope that something might come of it; and when she had  made her nine gyrations we looked eagerly down the sunset lane, half  expecting to see our lost pet. But we saw only the Awkward Man turning  in at the gate. This was almost as surprising as the sight of Pat  himself would have been; but there was no sign of Pat and hope flickered  out in every breast but Peter's.    \"You've got to give the spell time to work,\" he expostulated. \"If Pat  was miles away when it was wished it wouldn't be reasonable to expect to  see him right off.\"    But we of little faith had already lost that little, and it was a very  disconsolate group which the Awkward Man presently joined.    He was smiling--his rare, beautiful smile which only children ever  saw--and he lifted his hat to the girls with no trace of the shyness and  awkwardness for which he was notorious.    \"Good evening,\" he said. \"Have you little people lost a cat lately?\"    We stared. Peter said \"I knew it!\" in a triumphant pig's whisper. The  Story Girl started eagerly forward.    \"Oh, Mr. Dale, can you tell us anything of Paddy?\" she cried.    \"A silver gray cat with black points and very fine marking?\"    \"Yes, yes!\"    \"Alive?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, doesn't that beat the Dutch!\" muttered Dan.    But we were all crowding about the Awkward Man, demanding where and when  he had found Paddy.    \"You'd better come over to my place and make sure that it really is your  cat,\" suggested the Awkward Man, \"and I'll tell you all about finding  him on the way. I must warn you that he is pretty thin--but I think  he'll pull through.\"    We obtained permission to go without much difficulty, although the  spring evening was wearing late, for Aunt Janet said she supposed none  of us would sleep a wink that night if we didn't. A joyful procession  followed the Awkward Man and the Story Girl across the gray, star-litten  meadows to his home and through his pine-guarded gate.    \"You know that old barn of mine back in the woods?\" said the Awkward  Man. \"I go to it only about once in a blue moon. There was an old barrel  there, upside down, one side resting on a block of wood. This morning  I went to the barn to see about having some hay hauled home, and I had  occasion to move the barrel. I noticed that it seemed to have been  moved slightly since my last visit, and it was now resting wholly on the  floor. I lifted it up--and there was a cat lying on the floor under it.  I had heard you had lost yours and I took it this was your pet. I was  afraid he was dead at first. He was lying there with his eyes closed;  but when I bent over him he opened them and gave a pitiful little mew;  or rather his mouth made the motion of a mew, for he was too weak to  utter a sound.\"    \"Oh, poor, poor Paddy,\" said tender-hearted Cecily tearfully.    \"He couldn't stand, so I carried him home and gave him just a little  milk. Fortunately he was able to lap it. I gave him a little more at  intervals all day, and when I left he was able to crawl around. I think  he'll be all right, but you'll have to be careful how you feed him for a  few days. Don't let your hearts run away with your judgment and kill him  with kindness.\"    \"Do you suppose any one put him under that barrel?\" asked the Story  Girl.    \"No. The barn was locked. Nothing but a cat could get in. I suppose  he went under the barrel, perhaps in pursuit of a mouse, and somehow  knocked it off the block and so imprisoned himself.\"    Paddy was sitting before the fire in the Awkward Man's clean, bare  kitchen. Thin! Why, he was literally skin and bone, and his fur was dull  and lustreless. It almost broke our hearts to see our beautiful Paddy  brought so low.    \"Oh, how he must have suffered!\" moaned Cecily.    \"He'll be as prosperous as ever in a week or two,\" said the Awkward Man  kindly.    The Story Girl gathered Paddy up in her arms. Most mellifluously did he  purr as we crowded around to stroke him; with friendly joy he licked our  hands with his little red tongue; poor Paddy was a thankful cat; he was  no longer lost, starving, imprisoned, helpless; he was with his comrades  once more and he was going home--home to his old familiar haunts of  orchard and dairy and granary, to his daily rations of new milk and  cream, to the cosy corner of his own fireside. We trooped home joyfully,  the Story Girl in our midst carrying Paddy hugged against her shoulder.  Never did April stars look down on a happier band of travellers on the  golden road. There was a little gray wind out in the meadows that  night, and it danced along beside us on viewless, fairy feet, and sang  a delicate song of the lovely, waiting years, while the night laid her  beautiful hands of blessing over the world.    \"You see what Peg's wishbone did,\" said Peter triumphantly.    \"Now, look here, Peter, don't talk nonsense,\" expostulated Dan. \"The  Awkward Man found Paddy this morning and had started to bring us word  before Cecily ever thought of the wishbone. Do you mean to say you  believe he wouldn't have come walking up our lane just when he did if  she had never thought of it?\"    \"I mean to say that I wouldn't mind if I had several wishbones of the  same kind,\" retorted Peter stubbornly.    \"Of course I don't think the wishbone had really anything to do with  our getting Paddy back, but I'm glad I tried it, for all that,\" remarked  Cecily in a tone of satisfaction.    \"Well, anyhow, we've got Pat and that's the main thing,\" said Felix.    \"And I hope it will be a lesson to him to stay home after this,\"  commented Felicity.    \"They say the barrens are full of mayflowers,\" said the Story Girl. \"Let  us have a mayflower picnic tomorrow to celebrate Paddy's safe return.\"          CHAPTER XII. FLOWERS O' MAY      Accordingly we went a-maying, following the lure of dancing winds to a  certain westward sloping hill lying under the spirit-like blue of spring  skies, feathered over with lisping young pines and firs, which cupped  little hollows and corners where the sunshine got in and never got out  again, but stayed there and grew mellow, coaxing dear things to bloom  long before they would dream of waking up elsewhere.    'Twas there we found our mayflowers, after faithful seeking. Mayflowers,  you must know, never flaunt themselves; they must be sought as  becomes them, and then they will yield up their treasures to the  seeker--clusters of star-white and dawn-pink that have in them the very  soul of all the springs that ever were, re-incarnated in something it  seems gross to call perfume, so exquisite and spiritual is it.    We wandered gaily over the hill, calling to each other with laughter  and jest, getting parted and delightfully lost in that little pathless  wilderness, and finding each other unexpectedly in nooks and dips and  sunny silences, where the wind purred and gentled and went softly. When  the sun began to hang low, sending great fan-like streamers of radiance  up to the zenith, we foregathered in a tiny, sequestered valley, full  of young green fern, lying in the shadow of a wooded hill. In it was a  shallow pool--a glimmering green sheet of water on whose banks nymphs  might dance as blithely as ever they did on Argive hill or in Cretan  dale.

He won her before long, however, and early in April the pair  were established in one of the four or five boxes I had put up for them,  but not until they had changed their minds several times. As soon as  the first brood had flown, and while they were yet under their parents'  care, they began another nest in one of the other boxes, the female, as  usual, doing all the work, and the male all the complimenting.    A source of occasional great distress to the mother-bird was a white cat  that sometimes followed me about. The cat had never been known to catch  a bird, but she had a way of watching them that was very embarrassing to  the bird. Whenever she appeared, the mother bluebird would set up that  pitiful melodious plaint. One morning the cat was standing by me, when  the bird came with her beak loaded with building material, and alighted  above me to survey the place before going into the box. When she saw the  cat, she was greatly disturbed, and in her agitation could not keep her  hold upon all her material. Straw after straw came eddying down, till  not half her original burden remained. After the cat had gone away, the  bird's alarm subsided, till, presently seeing the coast clear, she flew  quickly to the box and pitched in her remaining straws with the greatest  precipitation, and, without going in to arrange them, as was her wont,  flew away in evident relief.    In the cavity of an apple-tree but a few yards off, and much nearer the  house than they usually build, a pair of high-holes, or golden-shafted  woodpeckers, took up their abode. A knot-hole which led to the decayed  interior was enlarged, the live wood being cut away as clean as a  squirrel would have done it. The inside preparations I could not  witness, but day after day, as I passed near, I heard the bird hammering  away, evidently beating down obstructions and shaping and enlarging the  cavity. The chips were not brought out, but were used rather to  floor the interior. The woodpeckers are not nest-builders, but rather  nest-carvers.    The time seemed very short before the voices of the young were heard in  the heart of the old tree,--at first feebly, but waxing stronger day by  day until they could be heard many rods distant. When I put my hand upon  the trunk of the tree, they would set up an eager, expectant chattering;  but if I climbed up it toward the opening, they soon detected the  unusual sound and would hush quickly, only now and then uttering a  warning note. Long before they were fully fledged they clambered up to  the orifice to receive their food. As but one could stand in the opening  at a time, there was a good deal of elbowing and struggling for this  position. It was a very desirable one aside from the advantages it had  when food was served; it looked out upon the great shining world, into  which the young birds seemed never tired of gazing. The fresh air  must have been a consideration also, for the interior of a high-hole's  dwelling is not sweet. When the parent birds came with food the young  one in the opening did not get it all, but after he had received a  portion, either on his own motion or on a hint from the old one, he  would give place to the one behind him. Still, one bird evidently  outstripped his fellows, and in the race of life, was two or three days  in advance of them. His voice was loudest and his head oftenest at the  window. But I noticed that when he had kept the position too long,  the others evidently made it uncomfortable in his rear, and, after  \"fidgeting\" about a while, he would be compelled to \"back down.\" But  retaliation was then easy, and I fear his mates spent few easy moments  at that lookout. They would close their eyes and slide back into the  cavity as if the world had suddenly lost all its charms for them.    This bird was, of course, the first to leave the nest. For two days  before that event he kept his position in the opening most of the time  and sent forth his strong voice incessantly. The old ones abstained from  feeding him almost entirely, no doubt to encourage his exit. As I  stood looking at him one afternoon and noting his progress, he suddenly  reached a resolution,--seconded, I have no doubt, from the rear,--and  launched forth upon his untried wings. They served him well and carried  him about fifty yards up-hill the first heat. The second day after, the  next in size and spirit left in the same manner; then another, till only  one remained. The parent birds ceased their visits to him, and for one  day he called and called till our ears were tired of the sound. His  was the faintest heart of all. Then he had none to encourage him from  behind. He left the nest and clung to the outer bowl of the tree, and  yelped and piped for an hour longer; then he committed himself to his  wings and went his way like the rest.    A young farmer in the western part of New York, who has a sharp,  discriminating eye, sends me some interesting notes about a tame  high-hole he once had.    \"Did you ever notice,\" says he, \"that the high-hole never eats anything  that he cannot pick up with his tongue? At least this was the case with  a young one I took from the nest and tamed. He could thrust out his  tongue two or three inches, and it was amusing to see his efforts to eat  currants from the hand. He would run out his tongue and try to stick it  to the currant; failing in that, he would bend his tongue around it like  a hook and try to raise it by a sudden jerk. But he never succeeded,  the round fruit would roll and slip away every time. He never seemed to  think of taking it in his beak. His tongue was in constant use to find  out the nature of everything he saw; a nail-hole in a board or any  similar hole was carefully explored. If he was held near the face he  would soon be attracted by the eye and thrust his tongue into it. In  this way he gained the respect of a number of half-grown cats that were  around the house. I wished to make them familiar to each other, so there  would be less danger of their killing him. So I would take them both on  my knee, when the bird would soon notice the kitten's eyes, and leveling  his bill as carefully as a marksman levels his rifle, he would remain so  a minute when he would dart his tongue into the cat's eye. This was held  by the cats to be very mysterious: being struck in the eye by something  invisible to them. They soon acquired such a terror of him that they  would avoid him and run away whenever they saw his bill turned in their  direction. He never would swallow a grasshopper even when it was placed  in his throat; he would shake himself until he had thrown it out of his  mouth. His 'best hold' was ants. He never was surprised at anything, and  never was afraid of anything. He would drive the turkey gobbler and  the rooster. He would advance upon them holding one wing up as high as  possible, as if to strike with it, and shuffle along the ground toward  them, scolding all the while in a harsh voice. I feared at first that  they might kill him, but I soon found that he was able to take care of  himself. I would turn over stones and dig into ant-hills for him, and he  would lick up the ants so fast that a stream of them seemed going  into his mouth unceasingly. I kept him till late in the fall, when he  disappeared, probably going south, and I never saw him again.\"    My correspondent also sends me some interesting observations about the  cuckoo. He says a large gooseberry bush standing in the border of an old  hedgerow, in the midst of open fields, and not far from his house, was  occupied by a pair of cuckoos for two seasons in succession, and, after  an interval of a year, for two seasons more. This gave him a good chance  to observe them. He says the mother-bird lays a single egg, and sits  upon it a number of days before laying the second, so that he has seen  one young bird nearly grown, a second just hatched, and a whole egg  all in the nest at once. \"So far as I have seen, this is the settled  practice,--the young leaving the nest one at a time to the number of six  or eight. The young have quite the look of the young of the dove in many  respects. When nearly grown they are covered with long blue pin-feathers  as long as darning-needles, without a bit of plumage on them. They part  on the back and hang down on each side by their own weight. With its  curious feathers and misshapen body the young bird is anything but  handsome. They never open their mouths when approached, as many young  birds do, but sit perfectly still, hardly moving when touched.\" He also  notes the unnatural indifference of the mother-bird when her nest and  young are approached. She makes no sound, but sits quietly on a near  branch in apparent perfect unconcern.    These observations, together with the fact that the egg of the cuckoo  is occasionally found in the nests of other birds, raise the inquiry  whether our bird is slowly relapsing into the habit of the European  species, which always foists its egg upon other birds; or whether, on  the other hand, it is not mending its manners in this respect. It has  but little to unlearn or to forget in the one case, but great progress  to make in the other. How far is its rudimentary nest--a mere platform  of coarse twigs and dry stalks of weeds--from the deep, compact, finely  woven and finely modeled nest of the goldfinch or king-bird, and what a  gulf between its indifference toward its young and their solicitude! Its  irregular manner of laying also seems better suited to a parasite like  our cow-bird, or the European cuckoo, than to a regular nest-builder.    This observer, like most sharp-eyed persons, sees plenty of interesting  things as he goes about his work. He one day saw a white swallow, which  is of rare occurrence. He saw a bird, a sparrow he thinks, fly against  the side of a horse and fill his beak with hair from the loosened coat  of the animal. He saw a shrike pursue a chickadee,"]]]
