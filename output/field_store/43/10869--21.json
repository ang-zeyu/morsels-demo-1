I experimented on Latreille's Osmia, using short and even very short  stumps of reed. All that I had to do was to lay them just beside the  nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds, nests beloved by this particular  Osmia. Old, disused hurdles supplied me with reeds inhabited from end to  end by the Horned Osmia. In both cases I obtained the same results and  the same conclusions as with the Three-horned Osmia.    I return to the latter, nidifying under my eyes in some old nests of the  Mason-bee of the Walls, which I had placed within her reach, mixed up  with the tubes. Outside my study, I had never yet seen the Three-horned  Osmia adopt that domicile. This may be due to the fact that these nests  are isolated one by one in the fields; and the Osmia, who loves to feel  herself surrounded by her kin and to work in plenty of company, refuses  them because of this isolation. But on my table, finding them close  to the tubes in which the others are working, she adopts them without  hesitation.    The chambers presented by those old nests are more or less spacious  according to the thickness of the coat of mortar which the Chalicodoma  has laid over the assembled chambers. To leave her cell, the Mason-bee  has to perforate not only the plug, the lid built at the mouth of the  cell, but also the thick plaster wherewith the dome is strengthened at  the end of the work. The perforation results in a vestibule which gives  access to the chamber itself. It is this vestibule which is sometimes  longer and sometimes shorter, whereas the corresponding chamber is of  almost constant dimensions, in the case of the same sex, of course.    We will first consider the short vestibule, at the most large enough to  receive the plug with which the Osmia will close up the lodging. There  is then nothing at her disposal except the cell proper, a spacious  apartment in which one of the Osmia's females will find ample  accommodation, for she is much smaller than the original occupant of the  chamber, no matter the sex; but there is not room for two cocoons at  a time, especially in view of the space taken up by the intervening  partition. Well, in those large, well-built chambers, formerly the homes  of Chalicodomae, the Osmia settles females and none but females.    Let us now consider the long vestibule. Here, a partition is  constructed, encroaching slightly on the cell proper, and the residence  is divided into two unequal storeys, a large room below, housing a  female, and a narrow cabin above, containing a male.    When the length of the vestibule permits, allowing for the space  required by the outer stopper, a third storey is built, smaller than the  second; and another male is lodged in this cramped corner. In this way  the old nest of the Mason-bee of the Pebbles is colonized, cell after  cell, by a single mother.    The Osmia, as we see, is very frugal of the lodging that has fallen to  her share; she makes the best possible use of it, giving to the females  the spacious chambers of the Mason-bee and to the males the narrow  vestibules, subdivided into storeys when this is feasible. Economy of  space is the chief consideration, since her stay-at-home tastes do not  allow her to indulge in distant quests. She has to employ the site which  chance places at her disposal just as it is, now for a male and now for  a female. Here we see displayed, more clearly than ever, her power of  deciding the sex of the egg, in order to adapt it judiciously to the  conditions of the house-room available.    I had offered at the same time to the Osmiae in my study some old  nests of the Mason-bee of the Shrubs, which are clay spheroids with  cylindrical cavities in them. These cavities are formed, as in the old  nests of the Mason-bee of the Pebbles, of the cell properly so-called  and of the exit-way which the perfect insect cut through the outer  coating at the time of its deliverance. Their diameter is about seven  millimetres (.273 inch.--Translator's Note.); their depth at the centre  of the heap is 23 millimetres (.897 inch.--Translator's Note.); and at  the edge averages 14 millimetres (.546 inch.--Translator's Note.)    The deep central cells receive only the females of the Osmia; sometimes  even the two sexes together, with a partition in the middle, the female  occupying the lower and the male the upper storey. True, in such cases  economy of space is strained to the utmost, the apartments provided by  the Mason-bee of the Shrubs being very small as it is, despite their  entrance-halls. Lastly, the deeper cavities on the circumference are  allotted to females and the shallower to males.    I will add that a single mother peoples each nest and also that she  proceeds from cell to cell without troubling to ascertain the depth. She  goes from the centre to the edges, from the edges to the centre, from a  deep cavity to a shallow cavity and vice versa, which she would not  do if the sexes were to follow upon each other in a settled order. For  greater certainty, I numbered the cells of one nest as each of them was  closed. On opening them later, I was able to see that the sexes were  not subjected to a chronological arrangement. Females were succeeded by  males and these by females without its being possible for me to make out  any regular sequence. Only--and this is the essential point--the deep  cavities were allotted to the females and the shallow ones to the males.    We know that the Three-horned Osmia prefers to haunt the habitations of  the Bees who nidify in populous colonies, such as the Mason-bee of the  Sheds and the Hairy-footed Anthophora. Exercising the very greatest  care, I broke up some great lumps of earth removed from the banks  inhabited by the Anthophora and sent to me from Carpentras by my dear  friend and pupil M. Devillario. I examined them conscientiously in the  quiet of my study. I found the Osmia's cocoons arranged in short series,  in very irregular passages, the original work of which is due to the  Anthophora. Touched up afterwards, made larger or smaller, lengthened  or shortened, intersected with a network of crossings by the numerous  generations that had succeeded one another in the same city, they formed  an inextricable labyrinth.    Sometimes these corridors did not communicate with any adjoining  apartment; sometimes they gave access to the spacious chamber of the  Anthophora, which could be recognized, in spite of its age, by its oval  shape and its coating of glazed stucco. In the latter case, the bottom  cell, which once constituted, by itself, the chamber of the Anthophora,  was always occupied by a female Osmia. Beyond it, in the narrow  corridor, a male was lodged, not seldom two, or even three. Of course,  clay partitions, the work of the Osmia, separated the different  inhabitants, each of whom had his own storey, his own closed cell.    When the accommodation consisted of no more than a simple cylinder,  with no state-bedroom at the end of it--a bedroom always reserved for  a female--the contents varied with the diameter of the cylinder. The  series, of which the longest were series of four, included, with a  wider diameter, first one or two females, then one or two males. It also  happened, though rarely, that the series was reversed, that is to say,  it began with males and ended with females. Lastly, there were a good  many isolated cocoons, of one sex or the other. When the cocoon was  alone and occupied the Anthophora's cell, it invariably belonged to a  female.    I have observed the same thing in the nests of the Mason-bee of the  Sheds, but not so easily. The series are shorter here, because the  Mason-bee does not bore galleries but builds cell upon cell. The work  of the whole swarm thus forms a stratum of cells that grows thicker from  year to year. The corridors occupied by the Osmia are the holes which  the Mason-bee dug in order to reach daylight from the deep layers.  In these short series, both sexes are usually present; and, if the  Mason-bee's chamber is at the end of the passage, it is inhabited by a  female Osmia.    We come back to what the short tubes and the old nests of the Mason-bee  of the Pebbles have already taught us. The Osmia who, in tubes of  sufficient length, divides her whole laying into a continuous sequence  of females and a continuous sequence of males, now breaks it up into  short series in which both sexes are present. She adapts her sectional  layings to the exigencies of a chance lodging; she always places a  female in the sumptuous chamber which the Mason-bee or the Anthophora  occupied originally.    Facts even more striking are supplied by the old nests of the Masked  Anthophora (A. personata, ILLIG.), old nests which I have seen utilized  by the Horned Osmia and the Three-horned Osmia at the same time. Less  frequently, the same nests serve for Latreille's Osmia. Let us first  describe the Masked Anthophora's nests.    In a steep bank of sandy clay, we find a set of round, wide-open holes.  There are generally only a few of them, each about half an inch in  diameter. They are the entrance-doors leading to the Anthophora's abode,  doors always left open, even after the building is finished. Each of  them gives access to a short passage, sometimes straight, sometimes  winding, nearly horizontal, polished with minute care and varnished with  a sort of white glaze. It looks as if it had received a thin coat of  whitewash. On the inner surface of this passage, in the thickness of  the earthy bank, spacious oval niches have been excavated, communicating  with the corridor by means of a narrow bottle-neck, which is closed,  when the work is done, with a substantial mortar stopper. The Anthophora  polishes the outside of this stopper so well, smooths its surface so  perfectly, bringing it to the same level as that of the passage, is so  careful to give it the white tint of the rest of the wall"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34211"],[0,"A Treatise on Physiology and Hygiene (#17)"],[1,"comparatively insipid. Hence the desire for high-seasoned food, and  pungent sauces, that both deprave the taste and over excite the digestive  organs. Rapid eating also permits the entrance of injurious substances  which may escape detection by the taste, and be unconsciously received into  the system. In some instances, the most acrid and poisonous substances have  frequently been swallowed \"by mistake,\" before the sense of taste could  act, and demand their rejection.    [Sidenote: 21. Effect of imperfectly broken food in the stomach? Dyspepsia?  Overeating?]    21. Thirdly, the food, being imperfectly broken up by the teeth, is hurried  onward to the stomach, to be by it more thoroughly divided. But the task  thus imposed upon the stomach, it is not at all adapted to perform; so that  the crude masses of food remain a heavy burden within the stomach, and a  source of distress to that organ, retarding the performance of its  legitimate duty. Hence persons who habitually eat too rapidly, frequently  fall victims to dyspepsia. Rapid eating also conduces to overeating. The  food is introduced so rapidly, that the system has not {90} time to  recognize that its real wants are met, and that its losses have been made  good; and hence the appetite continues, although more nutriment has been  swallowed than the system requires, or can healthfully appropriate.

Describe the stomach and its location. Effects of  gormandizing?]    22. THE STOMACH.--As soon as each separate portion of food is masticated  and insalivated, it is swallowed; that is, it is propelled downward to the  stomach, through a narrow muscular tube about nine inches in length, called  the _oesophagus_, or gullet (Fig. 23). The stomach is the only large  expansion of the digestive canal, and is the most important organ of  digestion. It is a hollow, pear-shaped a pouch, having a capacity of three  pints, in the adult. Its walls are thin and yielding, and may become  unnaturally distended, as in the case of those who subsist on a bulky,  innutritious diet, and of those who habitually gormandize.    [Sidenote: 23. Heart-orifice? Gatekeeper? Coins, etc.? Indication of the  soft and yielding texture of the stomach?]    23. The stomach has also two openings; that by which food enters, being  situated near the heart, is called the _cardiac_, or heart orifice; the  other is the _pylorus_, or \"gatekeeper,\" which guards the entrance to the  intestines, {91} and, under ordinary circumstances, permits only such  matters to pass it as have first been properly acted upon in the stomach.  Coins, buttons, and the like are, however, readily allowed to pass, because  they can be of no use if retained. The soft and yielding texture of this  organ--the stomach--indicates that it is not designed to crush and  comminute solid articles of food.    [Illustration: FIG. 23.--THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION.

THE GASTRIC JUICE.--We have seen how the presence of food in the mouth  excites the salivary glands, causing the saliva quickly to flow. In the  same manner, when food reaches the stomach, its inner lining, the mucous  membrane, is at once excited to activity. (At first its surface, which  while the stomach is empty presents a pale pink hue, turns to a bright red  color, for the minute blood-vessels which course through it, are filled  with blood. Presently a clear, colorless, and acid fluid exudes, drop by  drop, from its numerous minute glands or \"tubules,\" until finally the  surface is moistened in every part, and the fluid begins to mingle with the  food. This fluid is termed the gastric juice. {92}    [Sidenote: 25. What is the office of the gastric juice? Acidity of the  gastric juice? Quantity of gastric juice used? What becomes of it?]    25. The gastric juice is the proper solvent of certain articles of food,  especially those belonging to the albuminoid class. This solvent power is  due to its peculiar ingredient, _pepsin_; in digestion, this substance acts  like a ferment; that is, it induces changes in the food simply by its  presence, but does not itself undergo change. The acidity of the gastric  juice, which is due to _lactic acid_, is not accidental; for we find that  the pepsin cannot act in an alkaline solution--that is, one which is not  acid or neutral. The quantity of gastric juice secreted daily is very  large, probably not less than three or four pints at each meal. Though this  fluid is at once used in the reduction of the food, it is not lost; since  it is soon re-absorbed by the stomach, together with those parts of the  food which it has digested and holds in solution.    [Sidenote: 26. Muscular coat of the stomach? Expansion and contraction of  its fibres? Action of the fibres?]    26. MOVEMENTS OF THE STOMACH.--The inner coating of the stomach is the  mucous membrane, which, as we have seen, furnishes the gastric juice. Next  to this coating lies another, called the muscular coat, composed of  involuntary muscular fibres, some of which run circularly, and others in a  longitudinal direction. These expand to accommodate the food as it is  introduced, and contract as it passes out. In addition, these fibres are in  continual motion while food remains in the stomach, and they act in such  manner that the contents are gently turned round from side to side, or from  one end of it to the other.    [Sidenote: 27. Peristaltic movements? What is said of our consciousness of  and power over these movements? Describe the movements of the pylorus.]    27. By these incessant movements of the stomach, called the _peristaltic_  movements, the gastric juice comes in contact with all parts of the food.  We are, however, not conscious that these movements take place, nor have we  the power to control them. When such portions of the food as are  sufficiently digested approach the pylorus, it {93} expands to allow them  to pass out, and it closes again to confine the residue for further  preparation.    [Sidenote: 28. How has the knowledge and the workings of the stomach been  ascertained? St. Martin? How else?]    28. The knowledge of these and other interesting and instructive facts has  been obtained by actual observation; the workings of the stomach of a  living human being have been laid open to view and examined--the result of  a remarkable accident. Alexis St. Martin, a Canadian _voyageur_, received a  gun-shot wound which laid open his stomach, and which, in healing, left a  permanent orifice nearly an inch in diameter. Through this opening the  observer could watch the progress of digestion, and experiment with  different articles of food. Since that occurrence, artificial openings into  the stomach of the inferior animals have been repeatedly made, so that the  facts of stomach-digestion are very well ascertained and verified.    [Sidenote: 29. What was formerly thought? What do we now know? What else do  we now know? Water, salt, and sugar? Absorption?]    29. GASTRIC DIGESTION.--What portions of the food are digested in the  stomach? It was formerly thought that all the great changes of digestion  were wrought here, but later investigation has taught us better. We now  know that the first change in digestion takes place in the mouth, in the  partial conversion of starch into sugar. We also know that, of the three  organic food principles (considered in Chapter IV.) two--the fats and the  sugars--are but slightly affected by the stomach; but that its action is  confined to that third and very important class, from which the tissues are  renewed, the albuminoids. A few articles need no preparation before  entering the system, as water, salt, and grape-sugar. These are rapidly  taken up by the blood-vessels of the stomach, which everywhere underlie its  mucous membrane in an intricate and most delicate network. In this way the  function of absorption begins.    [Sidenote: 30. Albuminose? The process? Chyme?]    30. The albuminoid substances are speedily attacked and {94} digested by  the gastric juice. From whatever source they are derived, vegetable or  animal, they are all transformed into the same digestive product, called  _albuminose_. This is very soluble in water, and is readily absorbed by the  blood-vessels of the stomach. After a longer or shorter time, varying from  one to five hours, according to the individual and the quantity and quality  of his food, the stomach will be found empty. Not only has the digested  food passed out, but also those substances which the stomach could not  digest or absorb have passed little by little through the pylorus, to  undergo further action in the intestines. At the time of its exit, the  digested food is of a pulpy consistence, and dark color, and is then known  as the _chyme_.    [Sidenote: 31. What are the intestines? The small intestines? The large  intestines? Their structure?]    31. THE INTESTINES.--The intestines, or \"bowels,\" are continuous with the  stomach, and consist of a fleshy tube, or canal, twenty-five feet in  length. The small intestine, whose diameter is about one inch and a half,  is twenty feet long and very tortuous. The large intestine is much wider  than the former, and five feet long (Fig. 23). The general structure of  these organs resembles that of the stomach. Like it, they are provided with  a mucous membrane, or inner lining, whence flow their digestive juices;  and, just outside of this, a muscular coat, which propels the food onward  from one point to another.
