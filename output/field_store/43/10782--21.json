They had had their Godfathers and Godmothers, these Bells  (for my part, by the way, I would rather incur the responsibility of  being Godfather to a Bell than a Boy), and had had their silver mugs, no  doubt, besides. But Time had mowed down their sponsors, and Henry the  Eighth had melted down their mugs; and they now hung, nameless and  mugless, in the church tower.    Not speechless, though. Far from it. They had clear, loud, lusty,  sounding voices, had these Bells; and far and wide they might be heard  upon the wind. Much too sturdy Chimes were they, to be dependent on the  pleasure of the wind, moreover; for, fighting gallantly against it when  it took an adverse whim, they would pour their cheerful notes into a  listening ear right royally; and bent on being heard, on stormy nights,  by some poor mother watching a sick child, or some lone wife whose  husband was at sea, they had been sometimes known to beat a blustering  Nor'Wester; ay, \"all to fits,\" as Toby Veck said;--for though they chose  to call him Trotty Veck, his name was Toby, and nobody could make it  anything else either (except Tobias); he having been as lawfully  christened in his day as the bells had been in theirs, though with not  quite so much of solemnity or public rejoicing.    For my part, I confess myself of Toby Veck's belief, for I am sure he  had opportunities enough of forming a correct one. And whatever Toby  Veck said, I say. And I take my stand by Toby Veck, although he _did_  stand all day long (and weary work it was) just outside the church-door.  In fact he was a ticket-porter, Toby Veck, and waited there for jobs.    And a breezy, goose-skinned, blue-nosed, red-eyed, stony-toed,  tooth-chattering place it was to wait in, in the winter-time, as Toby  Veck well knew. The wind came tearing round the corner--especially the  east wind--as if it had sallied forth, express, from the confines of the  earth, to have a blow at Toby. And oftentimes it seemed to come upon him  sooner than it had expected, for bouncing round the corner, and passing  Toby, it would suddenly wheel round again, as if it cried \"Why, here he  is!\"    Toby was curious about the Bells because there were points of  resemblance between them and him. They hung there in all weathers, with  the wind and rain driving in upon them; facing only the outsides of all  the houses; never getting any nearer to the blazing fires that gleamed  and shone upon the windows or came puffing out of the chimney tops; and  incapable of participating in any of the good things that were  constantly being handed through the street doors and iron railings to  prodigious cooks. Being but a simple man, he invested the Bells with a  strange and solemn character. They were so mysterious, often heard and  never seen; so high up, so far off, so full of such a deep, strong  melody, that he regarded them with a species of awe; and sometimes when  he looked up at the dark arched windows in the tower, he half expected  to be beckoned to by something which was not a Bell, and yet was what he  heard so often sounding in the Chimes. For all this Toby scouted with  indignation a certain flying rumor that the Chimes were haunted, as  implying the possibility of their being connected with any Evil thing.  In short, they were very often in his ears, and very often in his  thoughts, but always in his good opinion; and he very often got such a  crick in his neck by staring with his mouth wide open, at the steeple  where they hung, that he was fain to take an extra trot or two,  afterward, to cure it.    The very thing he was in the act of doing one cold day, when the last  drowsy sound of Twelve o'clock, just struck, was humming like a  melodious monster of a Bee, and not by any means a busy Bee, all through  the steeple?    \"Dinner time, eh!\" said Toby, trotting up and down before the church.  \"Ah!\"    Toby's nose was very red, and his eyelids were very red, and he winked  very much, and his shoulders were very near his ears, and his legs were  very stiff, and altogether he was evidently a long way upon the frosty  side of cool.    \"Dinner time, eh!\" repeated Toby, using his right hand muffler like an  infantine boxing-glove, and punishing his chest for being cold.  \"Ah-h-h-h!\"    He took a silent trot, after that, for a minute or two.    \"There's nothing,\" said Toby, \"more regular in its coming round than  dinner time, and nothing less regular in its coming round than dinner.  That's the great difference between 'em. It's took me a long time to  find it out. I wonder whether it would be worth any gentleman's while,  now, to buy that obserwation for the Papers; or the Parliament!\"    Tony was only joking, for he gravely shook his head in  self-depreciation.    \"Why! Lord!\" said Toby. \"The Papers is full of obserwations as it is;  and so's the Parliament. Here's last week's paper, now;\" taking a very  dirty one from his pocket, and holding it from him at arm's length;  \"full of obserwations! Full of obserwations! I like to know the news as  well as any man,\" said Toby, slowly; folding it a little smaller, and  putting it in his pocket again: \"but it almost goes against the grain  with me to read a paper now. It frightens me almost. I don't know what  we poor people are coming to. Lord send we may be coming to something  better in the New Year nigh upon us!\"    \"Why, father, father!\" said a pleasant voice, hard by.    But Toby, not hearing it continued to trot backward and forward: musing  as he went, and talking to himself.    \"It seems as if we can't go right, or do right, or be righted,\" said  Toby. \"I hadn't much schooling, myself, when I was young; and I can't  make out whether we have any business on the face of the earth, or not.  Sometimes I think we must have--a little; and sometimes I think we must  be intruding. I get so puzzled sometimes that I am not even able to make  up my mind whether there is any good at all in us, or whether we are  born bad. We seem to do dreadful things; we seem to give a deal of  trouble; we are always being complained of and guarded against. One way  or another, we fill the papers. Talk of a New Year!\" said Toby,  mournfully. \"I can bear up as well as another man at most times; better  than a good many, for I am as strong as a lion, and all men an't; but  supposing it should really be that we have no right to a New  Year--supposing we really _are_ intruding----\"    \"Why, father, father!\" said the pleasant voice again.    Toby heard it this time; started; stopped; and shortening his sight,  which had been directed a long way off as seeking for enlightenment in  the very heart of the approaching year, found himself face to face with  his own child, and looking close into her eyes.    Bright eyes they were. Eyes that would bear a world of looking in,  before their depth was fathomed. Dark eyes, that reflected back the eyes  which searched them; not flashingly or at the owner's will, but with a  clear, calm, honest, patient radiance, claiming kindred with that light  which Heaven called into being. Eyes that were beautiful and true, and  beaming with Hope. With Hope so young and fresh; with Hope so buoyant,  vigorous and bright, despite the twenty years of work and poverty on  which they had looked; that they became a voice to Trotty Veck, and  said: \"I think we have some business here--a little!\"    Trotty kissed the lips belonging to the eyes, and squeezed the blooming  face between his hands.    \"Why, Pet,\" said Trotty. \"What's to-do? I didn't expect you, to-day,  Meg.\"    \"Neither did I expect to come, father,\" cried the girl, nodding her head  and smiling as she spoke. \"But here I am! And not alone; not alone!\"    \"Why you don't mean to say,\" observed Trotty, looking curiously at a  covered basket which she carried in her hand, \"that you----\"    \"Smell it, father dear,\" said Meg, \"Only smell it!\"    Trotty was going to lift up the cover at once, in a great hurry, when  she gayly interposed her hand.    \"No, no, no,\" said Meg, with the glee of a child. \"Lengthen it out a  little. Let me just lift up the corner; just the lit-tle ti-ny cor-ner,  you know,\" said Meg, suiting the action to the word with the utmost  gentleness, and speaking very softly, as if she were afraid of being  overheard by something inside the basket; \"there. Now. What's that!\"    Toby took the shortest possible sniff at the edge of the basket, and  cried out in a rapture:    \"Why, it's hot!\"    \"It is burning hot!\" cried Meg. \"Ha, ha, ha! It's scalding hot!\"    \"Ha, ha, ha!\" roared Toby, with a sort of kick. \"It's scalding hot!\"    \"But what is it father?\" said Meg. \"Come! you haven't guessed what it  is. And you must guess what it is. I can't think of taking it out till  you guess what it is. Don't be in such a hurry! Wait a minute! A little  bit more of the cover. Now guess!\"    Meg was in a perfect fright lest he should guess right too soon;  shrinking away, as she held the basket toward him; curling up her pretty  shoulders; stopping her ear with her hand, as if by so doing she could  keep the right word out of Toby's lips; and laughing softly the whole  time.    Meanwhile Toby, putting a hand on each knee, bent down his nose to the  basket, and took a long inspiration at the lid; the grin upon his  withered face expanded in the process, as if he were inhaling laughing  gas.    \"Ah! It's very nice,\" said Toby. \"It ain't--I suppose it ain't  Polonies?\"    \"No, no, no!\" cried Meg, delighted. \"Nothing like Polonies!\"    \"No,\" said Toby, after another sniff. \"It's--it's mellower than  Polonies. It's very nice. It improves every moment. It's too decided for  Trotters. Ain't it?\"    Meg was in ecstasy. He could _not_ have gone wider of the mark than  Trotters--except Polonies.    \"Liver?\" said Toby, communing with himself. \"No. There's a mildness  about it that don't answer to liver. Pettitoes? No. It an't faint enough  for pettitoes. It wants the stringiness of Cocks' heads.

There is no apparent action of sulphuric acid on  the vessels and the slight increase in temperature resulting from the  absorption of water-vapor as the air passes through does not appear to  have any deleterious effect.    [Illustration: FIG. 28.--Cross-section of sulphuric-acid absorber. The  air enters at the top of the right-hand opening, descends to the bottom  of the absorber, and then passes through three concentric rings, which  are covered with acid, and it finally passes out at the left-hand  opening. Beneath the left-hand opening is a cup arrangement for  preventing the acid being carried mechanically out through the opening.  The opening for filling and emptying the absorber is shown midway  between the two large openings.]    The vessels without filling and without rubber elbows weigh 11.5  kilograms; with the special elbows and couplings attached so as to  enable them to be connected with the ventilating air-system, the empty  absorbers weigh 13.4 kilograms; and filled with sulphuric acid they  weigh 19 kilograms. Repeated tests have shown that 5.5 kilograms of  sulphuric acid will remove the water-vapor from a current of air passing  through the absorbers at the rate of 75 liters of air per minute,  without letting any appreciable amount pass by until 500 grams of water  have been absorbed. At this degree of saturation a small persistent  amount of moisture escapes absorption in the acid and consequently a  second absorber will begin to gain in weight. Experiments demonstrate  that the first vessel can gain 1,500 grams of water before the second  gains 5 grams. As a matter of fact, it has been found more advantageous  to use but one absorber and have it refilled as soon as it has gained  400 grams, thus allowing a liberal factor of safety and no danger of  loss of water.      POTASH-LIME CANS.    The problem of absorbing the water-vapor from so rapid a current of air  is second only to that of absorbing the carbon dioxide from such a  current. All experiments with potassium hydroxide in the form of sticks  or in solution failed to give the desired results and the use of  soda-lime has supplemented all other forms of carbon dioxide absorption.  More recently we have been using potash-lime, substituting caustic  potash for caustic soda in the formula, and the results thus obtained  are, if anything, more satisfactory than with the soda-lime.    The potash-lime is made as follows: 1 kilogram of commercial potassium  hydroxide, pulverized, is dissolved in 550 to 650 cubic centimeters of  water and 1 kilogram of pulverized quicklime added slowly. The amount of  water to be used varies with the moisture content of the potash. There  is a variation in the moisture content of different kegs of potash, so  when a keg is opened we determine experimentally the amount of water to  be used. After a batch is made up in this way it should be allowed to  cool before testing whether it has the right amount of water, and this  is determined by feeling of it and noting how it pulverizes in the hand.  It is not advisable to make a great quantity at once, because we have  found that if a large quantity is made and broken into small particles  and stored in a container it has a tendency to cake and thus interfere  with its ready subsequent use.    A record was kept of the gains in weight of a can filled with  potash-lime during a series of experiments where there were three  silver-plated cans used. This can was put at the head of the system and  when it began to lose weight it was removed. The records of gains of  weight when added together amount to 400 grams. From experience with  other cans where the loss of moisture was determined, it is highly  probable that at least 200 grams of water were vaporized from the  reagent and thus the total amount of carbon dioxide absorbed must have  been not far from 600 grams. At present our method is not to allow the  cans to gain a certain weight, but during 4-hour or 5-hour experiments,  in which each can may be used 2 or 3 hours, it is the practice to put a  new can on each side of the absorber system (see page 66) at the  beginning of every experiment. This insures the same power of absorption  on each side of the absorption system so that the residual amount of  carbon dioxide in the chamber from period to period does not undergo  very marked changes. This has been found the best method, because if one  can is left on a day longer than the other there is apt to be  alternately a rise and fall in the amount of residual carbon dioxide in  the apparatus, owing to the unequal efficiency of the absorbers.    These cans are each day taken to the basement, where the first  section[19] only is taken out and replaced with new potash-lime. Thus,  three-quarters of the contents of the can is used over and over, while  the first quarter is freshly renewed every day. Potash-lime has not been  found practicable for the U-tubes because one can not, as in the case of  soda-lime, see the whitening of the reagent where the carbon dioxide is  absorbed.    The importance of having the soda-lime or potash-lime somewhat moist, to  secure the highest efficiency for the absorption of the carbon dioxide,  makes it necessary to absorb the moisture taken up by the dry air in  passing through the potash-lime can. Consequently a second vessel  containing sulphuric acid is placed in the system to receive the air  immediately after it leaves the potash-lime can. Obviously the amount of  water absorbed here is very much less than in the first acid absorber  and hence the same absorber can be used for a greater number of  experiments.      BALANCE FOR WEIGHING ABSORBERS.    The complete removal of water-vapor and carbon dioxide from a current of  air moving at the rate of 75 liters per minute calls for large and  somewhat unwieldy vessels in which is placed the absorbing material.  This is particularly the case with the vessels containing the rather  large amounts of sulphuric acid required to dry the air. In the course  of an hour there is ordinarily removed from the chamber not far from 25  grams of water-vapor and 20 to 30 grams of carbon dioxide. This  necessitates weighing the absorbers to within 0.25 gram if an accuracy  of 1 per cent is desired. The sulphuric-acid absorbers weigh about 18  kilograms when filled with acid. In order to weigh this receptacle so as  to measure accurately the increase in weight due to the absorption of  water to within less than 1 per cent, we use the balance shown in fig.  29. This balance has been employed in a number of other manipulations in  connection with the respiration calorimeter and accessory apparatus and  the general type of balance leaves nothing to be desired as a balance  capable of carrying a heavy load with remarkable sensitiveness.    The balance is rigidly mounted on a frame consisting of four upright  structural-steel angle-irons, fastened at the top to a substantial  wooden bed. Two heavy wooden pieces run the length of the table and  furnish a substantial base to which the standard of the balance is  bolted. The balance is surrounded by a glass case to prevent errors due  to air-currents (see fig. 2). The pan of the balance is not large enough  to permit the weighing of an absorber, hence provision is made for  suspending it on a steel or brass rod from one of the hanger arms. This  rod passes through a hole in the bottom of the balance case, and its  lower end is provided with a piece of pipe having hooks at either end.  Since the increase in weight rather than the absolute weight of the  absorber is used, the greater part of the weight is taken up by lead  counterpoises suspended above the pan on the right-hand arm of the  balance. The remainder of the weight is made up with brass weights  placed in the pan.    [Illustration: FIG. 29.--Balance for weighing absorbers, showing general  type of balance and case surrounding it, with counterpoise and weights  upon right-hand pan. A sulphuric-acid absorber is suspended in position  ready for weighing. Elevator with compressed-air system is shown in  lower part of case.]    In order to suspend this heavy absorber, a small elevator has been  constructed, so that the vessel may be raised by a compressed-air  piston. This piston is placed in an upright position at the right of the  elevator and is connected with the compressed-air service of the  building. The pressure is about 25 pounds per square inch and the  diameter of the cylinder is 2.5 inches, thus giving ample service for  raising and lowering the elevator and its load. By turning a 3-way  valve at the end of the compressed-air supply-pipe, so that the air  rushes into the cylinder above the piston, the piston is pushed to the  base of the cylinder and the elevator thereby raised. The pressure of  the compressed air holds the elevator in this position while the hooks  are being adjusted on the absorber. By turning the 3-way valve so as to  open the exhaust leading to the upper part of the cylinder to the air,  the weight of the elevator expels the air, and it soon settles into the  position shown in the figure. The weighing can then be made as the  absorber is swinging freely in the air. After the weighing has been  made, the elevator is again lifted, the hooks are released, and by  turning the valve the elevator and load are safely lowered.    The size of the openings of the pipes into the cylinder is so adjusted  that the movement of the elevator is regular and moderate whether it is  being raised or lowered, thus avoiding any sudden jars that might cause  an accident to the absorbers. With this system it is possible to weigh  these absorbers to within 0.1 gram and, were it necessary, probably the  error could be diminished so that the weight could be taken to 0.05  gram. On a balance of this type described elsewhere,[20] weighings could  be obtained to within 0.02 gram. For all practical purposes, however, we  do not use the balance for"]]]
