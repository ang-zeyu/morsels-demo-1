[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38207"],[0,"On the Origin and Metamorphoses of Insects (#17)"],[1,"that many beetles and other insects are derived from larvae  closely resembling _Campodea_.    Since, then, individual insects are certainly in many cases developed  from larvae closely resembling the genus _Campodea_, why should it be  regarded as incredible that insects as a group have gone through similar  stages? That the ancestors of beetles under the influence of varying  external conditions, and in the lapse of geological ages, should have  undergone changes which the individual beetle passes through under our  own eyes and in the space of a few days, is surely no wild or  extravagant hypothesis. Again, other insects come from vermiform larvae  much resembling the genus _Lindia_, and it has been also repeatedly shown  that in many particulars the embryo of the more specialized forms  resembles the full-grown representatives of lower types. I conclude,  therefore, that the Insecta generally are descended from ancestors  resembling the existing genus _Campodea_, and that these again have arisen  from others belonging to a type represented more or less closely by the  existing genus _Lindia_.    Of course it may be argued that these facts have not really the  significance which they seem to me to possess. It may be said that when  Divine power created insects, they were created with these remarkable  developmental processes. By such arguments the conclusions of geologists  were long disputed. When God made the rocks, it was tersely said, He  made the fossils in them. No one, I suppose, would now be found to  maintain such a theory; and I believe the time will come when it will be  generally admitted that the structure of the embryo, and its  developmental changes, indicate as truly the course of organic  development in ancient times as the contents of rocks and their sequence  teach us the past history of the earth itself.

[65] A still nearer approach is afforded by the genus _Peripatus_, which  since the above was written has been carefully described, especially by  Moseley and Hutton. There are several species, scattered over the  southern hemisphere. In general appearance they look like a link between  a caterpillar and a centipede. They have a pair of antennae, two pairs of  jaws, and (according to the species) from fourteen to thirty-three pairs  of legs. They breathe by means of tracheae, which open diffusely all over  the body.    [66] Unters. ueb. die Entwick, und den Bau der Gliederthiere, p. 73.    [67] Linnean Transactions, v. xxii.

A friend who reared four orphan grosbeaks says that they left the nest  when about eleven {133} days old. They were very tame, even  affectionate toward him, hopping over his shoulders, head, knees, and  hands without the least fear, and eating from his fingers. When only  ten weeks old the little boy grosbeaks began to warble. On being  released to pick up their own living in the garden, these pets repaid  their foster-father by eating quantities of potato-bugs, among other  pests. Some people call this grosbeak the potato-bug bird.      CARDINAL GROSBEAK    _Called also: Crested Redbird: Virginia Nightingale._    It was on a cold January day in Central Park, New York, that I first  met a cardinal and was warmed by the sight. Then I supposed that he  must have escaped from a cage, for he is uncommon north of Washington.  With tail and crest erect, he was hopping about rather clumsily on the  ground near the bear's cage, and picking up bits of broken peanuts  that had missed their mark. Presently a dove-coloured bird, lightly  washed with dull red, joined him and I guessed by her crest that she  must be his mate. Therefore both birds were permanent residents in the  park and not escaped pets. Although they look as if they belonged  {134} in the tropics, cardinals never migrate as the rose-breasted  grosbeak and so many of our fair-weather feathered friends do. That is  because they can live upon the weed seeds and the buds of trees and  bushes in winter as comfortably as upon insects in summer. It pays not  to be too particular.    In the Southern States every child knows the common cardinal and could  tell you that he is a little smaller than a robin (not half so  graceful), that he is red all over, except a small black area around  his red bill, and that he wears his head-feathers crested like the  blue jay and the titmouse. In a Bermuda garden, a shelf restaurant  nailed up in a cedar tree attracted cardinals about it every hour of  the day. If you can think of a prettier sight than that dark  evergreen, with the brilliant red birds hopping about in its branches  and the sparkling sapphire sea dashing over gray coral rocks in the  background, do ask some artist to paint it!    Few lady birds sing--an accomplishment usually given to their lover's  only, to help woo them. But the female cardinal is a charming singer  with a softer voice than her mate's--most becoming to one of her  sex--and an individual song quite different from his loud, clear  whistle.    [Illustration]    Cardinal    [Illustration]    That dusky rascal, the cowbird      {135}    CHAPTER IX    THE ILL-ASSORTED BLACKBIRD FAMILY      Bobolink    Cowbird    Red-winged Blackbird    Rusty Blackbird    Meadowlark    Orchard Oriole    Baltimore Oriole    Purple and Bronzed Grackles    {136}    {137}    BOBOLINK    _Called also: Reedbird; Ricebird; Ortolan; Maybird_      Such a rollicking, jolly singer is the bobolink! On a May morning,  when buttercups spangle the fresh grasses in the meadows, he rises  from their midst into the air with the merriest frolic of a song you  ever heard. Loud, clear, strong, full of queer kinks and twists that  could not possibly be written down in our musical scale, the rippling,  reckless music seems to keep his wings in motion as well as his  throat; for when it suddenly bursts forth, up he shoots into the air  like a skylark, and paddles himself along with just the tips of his  wings while it is the \"mad music\" that seemingly propels him:--then he  drops with his song into the grass again. Frequently he pours out his  hilarious melody while swaying on the slender stems of the grasses,  propped by the stiff, pointed feathers of his tail. A score or more of  bobolinks rising in some open meadow all day long, are worth  travelling miles to hear.    If you were to see the mate of one of these merry minstrels apart from  him, you might easily mistake her for another of those tiresome {138}  sparrows. A brown, streaked bird, with some buff and a few white  feathers, she shades into the colours of the ground as well as they  and covers her loose heap of twigs, leaves and grasses in the hay  field so harmoniously that few people ever find it or the clever  sitter.    As early as the Fourth of July, bobolinks begin to desert the choir,  being the first birds to leave us. Travelling southward by easy  stages, they feed on the wild rice in the marshes until, late in  August, enormous flocks reach the cultivated rice fields of South  Carolina and Georgia.    On the way, a great transformation has gradually taken place in the  male bobolink's dress. At the North he wore a black, buff and white  wedding garment, with the unique distinction of being lighter above  than below; but this he has exchanged, feather by feather, for a  striped, brown, sparrowy winter suit like his mate's and children's,  only with a little more buff about it.    In this inconspicuous dress the reedbirds, or ricebirds, as bobolinks  are usually called south of Mason and Dixon's line, descend in hordes  upon the rice plantations when the grain is in the milk, and do  several millions of dollars' worth of damage to the crop every year,  sad, sad to tell. Of course, the birds are snared, shot, poisoned. In  southern markets half {139} a dozen of them on a skewer may be bought,  plucked and ready for the oven, for fifty cents or less. Isn't this a  tragic fate to overtake our joyous songsters? Birds that have the  misfortune to like anything planted by man, pay a terribly heavy  penalty.    Such bobolinks as escape death, leave this country by way of Florida  and continue their four thousand mile journey to southern Brazil,  where they spend the winter; yet, nothing daunted by the tragedies in  the rice fields, they dare return to us by the same route in May. By  this time the males have made another complete change of feather to go  a-courting. Most birds are content to moult once a year, just after  nursery duties have ended; some, it is true, put on a partially new  suit in the following spring, retaining only their old wing and tail  feathers; but a very few, the bobolink, goldfinch, and scarlet tanager  among them, undergo as complete a change as Harlequin.      COWBIRD    This contemptible bird every child should know if for no better reason  than to despise it. You will see it alone or in small flocks walking  about the pastures after the cattle; or, in the {140} West, boldly  perching upon their backs to feed upon the insect parasites--a  pleasant visitor for the cows. So far, so good.    The male is a shining, greenish-black bird, smaller than a robin, with  a coffee-brown head and neck. His morals are awful, for he makes  violent love to any brownish-gray cowbird he fancies but mates with  none. What should be his song is a squeaking _kluck tse-e-e_, squeezed  out with difficulty, or a gurgle, like water being poured from a  bottle. When he goes a-wooing, he behaves ridiculously, parading with  spread wings and tail and acting as if he were violently nauseated in  the presence of the lady. Fancy a cousin of the musical bobolink  behaving so!    And nothing good can be said for the female cowbird. Shirking as she  does every motherly duty, she sneaks about the woods and thickets,  slyly watching her chance to lay an egg in the cradle of some other  bird, since she never makes a nest of her own. Thus she scatters her  prospective family throughout the neighbourhood. The yellow warbler,  who is a famous sufferer from her visits, sometimes outwits her, as we  have seen; but other warblers, less clever, the vireos, some sparrows,  and, more rarely, woodpeckers, flycatchers, orioles, thrushes and  wrens, seem to accept the unwelcome gift without a protest. If you  were a bird so imposed upon, wouldn't {141} you peck holes in that  egg, or roll it out of your nest, or build another cradle rather than  hatch a big, greedy interloper that would smother and starve your own  babies? Probably every cowbird you see has sacrificed the lives of at  least part of a brood of valuable, insectivorous songsters. Without  the least spark of gratitude in its cold heart, a young cowbird  grafter forsakes its over-kind foster parents as soon as it can pick  up its living and remains henceforth among its own kin--of whom only  cows could think well.      RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD    _Called also: Swamp Blackbird_    When you are looking for the first pussy willows in the frozen  marshes, or listening to the peeping of young frogs some day in early  spring, you will, no doubt, become acquainted with this handsome  blackbird, with red and orange epaulettes on his shoulders, who has  just returned, from the South. _''Ke, kong-ker-ee,''_ he flutes from  the willows and alders about the reedy meadows where he and his  bachelor friends flock together and make them ring \"with social cheer  and jubilee.\" A little later, flocks of dingy, brown, streaked birds,  {142} travelling northward, pause to rest in the marshes. Wholesale  courting takes place shortly after and every red-wing in a black  uniform chooses one of the plain, streaked, matter-of-fact birds for  his mate. The remainder continue their unmaidenly journey in search of  husbands, whom they find waiting in cheerful readiness in almost any  marsh. By the first of May all have settled down to home life.    Then how constant are the rich, liquid, sweet _o-ka-lee_ notes of the  red-wing! Ever in foolish fear for the safety of his nest, he  advertises its whereabouts in musical headlines from the top of the  nearest tree, or circles around it on fluttering wings above the  sedges, or _chucks_ at any trespasser near it until one might easily  torture him by going straight to its site.    But how short-lived is this excessive devotion to his family! In July,  the restless young birds flock with the mothers, but the now  indifferent fathers keep apart by themselves. Strange"]]]
