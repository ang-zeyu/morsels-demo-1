Cranes bear a general resemblance to Herons in that they are  long-legged, long-necked birds, but when on the wing, they carry the  neck fully extended, a habit which will readily distinguish them from  the curved neck Herons. Cranes are less aquatic than Herons and are  often found feeding on the prairies or pine-barrens where worms,  grasshoppers, lizards, roots, etc., form their fare. They nest on the  ground laying two buffy eggs thickly marked with brown. The young,  unlike the nearly naked, helpless young of Herons, are born covered  with down and can soon follow their parents. The Cranes have loud  sonorous voices; the Herons raucous croaks.    The Limpkin is a singular inhabitant of the more retired Florida  swamps. It feeds upon the ground largely upon a kind of land shell,  but also perches in trees. Its nest of twigs is placed in a small tree  or bush, and it lays from four to seven pale buffy eggs stained and  speckled with cinnamon brown.    The Rails (Subfamily RallinA|) are inhabitants of grassy marshes where,  trusting to their long legs, they more often escape observation by  running than by flying. One may hear their characteristic notes coming  from the dense growth only a few yards distant and still be unable to  catch a glimpse of their maker.    Rails nest on the ground laying six to twelve or fifteen buffy eggs  spotted with reddish brown. The young of all our species are born  covered with a shining black down.    The Gallinules (Subfamily GallinulinA|) are more aquatic than the Rails  and are consequently less difficult to observe.    The Coots (Subfamily FulicinA|) are still more aquatic than the  Gallinules, as might be supposed from their lobed toes, in fact are as  much at home in the water as though they were Ducks. Both Gallinules  and Coots lay eight to sixteen buffy, thickly speckled eggs in a nest  of reeds often built on a pile of rushes in the reeds.

Remains of the Mammoth and Woolly Rhinoceros, found in  Siberia and Northern Europe, were thought to indicate that at the period  when these animals lived the climate was mild, a very natural inference,  since the elephants and rhinoceroses we now know are all inhabitants of  tropical climes. But the discovery of more or less complete specimens  makes it evident that the climate was not particularly mild; the  animals were simply adapted to it; instead of being naked like their  modern relatives, they were dressed for the climate in a woolly  covering. We think of the tiger as prowling through the jungles of  India, but he ranges so far north that in some localities this beast  preys upon reindeer, which are among the most northern of large mammals,  and there the tiger is clad in fairly thick fur.    When we come to coloring a reconstructed animal we have absolutely no  guide, unless we assume that the larger a creature the more soberly will  it be colored. The great land animals of to-day, the elephant and  rhinoceros, to say nothing of the aquatic hippopotamus, are very dully  colored, and while this sombre coloration is to-day a protection,  rendering these animals less easily seen by man than they otherwise  would be, yet at the time this color was developing man was not nor were  there enemies sufficiently formidable to menace the race of elephantine  creatures.    For where mere size furnishes sufficient protection one would hardly  expect to find protective coloration as well, unless indeed a creature  preyed upon others, when it might be advantageous to enable a predatory  animal to steal upon its prey.    Color often exists (or is supposed to) as a sexual characteristic, to  render the male of a species attractive to, or readily recognizable by,  the female, but in the case of large animals mere size is quite enough  to render them conspicuous, and possibly this may be one of the factors  in the dull coloration of large animals.    So while a green and yellow Triceratops would undoubtedly have been a  conspicuous feature in the Cretaceous landscape, from what we know of  existing animals it seems best to curb our fancy and, so far as large  Dinosaurs are concerned, employ the colors of a Rembrandt rather than  those of a sign painter.    Aids, or at least hints, to the coloration of extinct animals are to be  found in the coloration of the young of various living species, for as  the changes undergone by the embryo are in a measure an epitome of the  changes undergone by a species during its evolution, so the brief color  phases or markings of the young are considered to represent the  ordinary coloring of distant ancestors. Young thrushes are spotted,  young ostriches and grebes are irregularly striped, young lions are  spotted, and in restoring the early horse, or Hyracothere, Professor  Osborn had the animal represented as faintly striped, for the reason  that zebras, the wild horses of to-day, are striped, and because the  ass, which is a primitive type of horse, is striped over the shoulders,  these being hints that the earlier horse-like forms were also striped.    Thus just as the skeleton of a Dinosaur may be a composite structure,  made up of the bones of a dozen individuals, and these in turn mosaics  of many fragments, so may the semblance of the living animal be based on  a fact, pieced out with a probability and completed by a bit of theory.      _REFERENCES_    _There is a large series of restorations of extinct animals, prepared by  Mr. Charles R. Knight, under the direction of Professor Osborn, in the  Hall of Palaeontology of the American Museum of Natural History, and  these are later to be reproduced and issued in portfolio form._    _Should the reader visit Princeton, he may see in the museum there a  number of B. Waterhouse Hawkins's creations--creations is the proper  word--which are of interest as examples of the early work in this line._    _The \"Report of the Smithsonian Institution for 1900\" contains an  article on \"The Restoration of Extinct Animals,\" pages 479-492, which  includes a number of plates showing the progress that has been made in  this direction._    [Illustration: Fig. 27.--A Hint of Buried Treasures.]          VIII    FEATHERED GIANTS        _\"There were giants in the earth in those days.\"_      Nearly every group of animals has its giants, its species which tower  above their fellows as Goliath of Gath stood head and shoulders above  the Philistine hosts; and while some of these are giants only in  comparison with their fellows, belonging to families whose members are  short of stature, others are sufficiently great to be called giants  under any circumstances. Some of these giants live to-day, some have but  recently passed away, and some ceased to be long ages before man trod  this earth. The most gigantic of mammals--the whales--still survive, and  the elephant of to-day suffers but little in comparison with the  mammoth of yesterday; the monstrous Dinosaurs, greatest of all  reptiles--greatest, in fact, of all animals that have walked the  earth--flourished thousands upon thousands of years ago. As for birds,  some of the giants among them are still living, some existed long  geologic periods ago, and a few have so recently vanished from the scene  that their memory still lingers amid the haze of tradition. The best  known among these, as well as the most recent in point of time, are the  Moas of New Zealand, first brought to notice by the Rev. W. Colenso,  later on Bishop of New Zealand, one of the many missionaries to whom  Science is under obligations. Early in 1838, Bishop Colenso, while on a  missionary visit to the East Cape region, heard from the natives of  Waiapu tales of a monstrous bird, called Moa, having the head of a man,  that inhabited the mountain-side some eighty miles away. This mighty  bird, the last of his race, was said to be attended by two equally huge  lizards that kept guard while he slept, and on the approach of man  wakened the Moa, who immediately rushed upon the intruders and trampled  them to death. None of the Maoris had seen this bird, but they had seen  and somewhat irreverently used for making parts of their fishing  tackle, bones of its extinct relatives, and these bones they declared to  be as large as those of an ox.    About the same time another missionary, the Rev. Richard Taylor, found a  bone ascribed to the Moa, and met with a very similar tradition among  the natives of a near-by district, only, as the foot of the rainbow  moves away as we move toward it, in his case the bird was said to dwell  in quite a different locality from that given by the natives of East  Cape. While, however, the Maoris were certain that the Moa still lived,  and to doubt its existence was little short of a crime, no one had  actually seen it, and as time went on and the bird still remained unseen  by any explorer, hope became doubt and doubt certainty, until it even  became a mooted question whether such a bird had existed within the past  ten centuries, to say nothing of having lived within the memory of man.    But if we do not know the living birds, their remains are scattered  broadcast over hillside and plain, concealed in caves, buried in the mud  of swamps, and from these we gain a good idea of their size and  structure, while chance has even made it possible to know something of  their color and general appearance. This chance was the discovery of a  few specimens, preserved in exceptionally dry caves on the South Island,  which not only had some of the bones still united by ligaments, but  patches of skin clinging to the bones, and bearing numerous feathers of  a chestnut color tipped with white. These small, straggling, rusty  feathers are not much to look at, but when we reflect that they have  been preserved for centuries without any care whatever, while the  buffalo bugs have devoured our best Smyrna rugs in spite of all possible  precautions, our respect for them increases.    [Illustration: Fig. 28.--Relics of the Moa.]    From the bones we learn that there were a great many kinds of Moas,  twenty at least, ranging in size from those little larger than a turkey  to that giant among giants, _Dinornis maximus_, which stood at least ten  feet high,[10] or two feet higher than the largest ostrich, and may  well claim the distinction of being the tallest of all known birds. We  also learn from the bones that not only were the Moas flightless, but  that many of them were absolutely wingless, being devoid even of such  vestiges of wings as we find in the Cassowary or Apteryx. But if Nature  deprived these birds of wings, she made ample amends in the matter of  legs, those of some species, the Elephant-footed Moa, _Pachyornis  elephantopus_, for example, being so massively built as to cause one to  wonder what the owner used them for, although the generally accepted  theory is that they were used for scratching up the roots of ferns on  which the Moas are believed to have fed. And if a blow from an irate  ostrich is sufficient to fell a man, what must have been the kicking  power of an able-bodied Moa? Beside this bird the ostrich would appear  as slim and graceful as a gazelle beside a prize ox.    [10] _The height of the Moas, and even of some species of AEpyornis, is  often stated to be twelve or fourteen feet, but such a height can only  be obtained by placing the skeleton in a wholly unnatural attitude._    The Moas were confined to New Zealand, some species inhabiting the North  Island, some the South, very few being common to both, and from these  peculiarities of distribution geologists deduce that at some early  period in the history of the earth the two islands formed one, that  later on the land subsided, leaving the islands separated by a strait,  and that since this subsidence there has been sufficient time for the  development of the species"]]]
