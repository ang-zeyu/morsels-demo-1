In Count Castiglione, the penetration of Julius recognised  a fit instrument for promoting his favourite scheme of securing  Urbino to his nephew Francesco Maria della Rovere; and by attaching  him to Guidobaldo, he fixed at that court a friend whose influence  was certain to extend itself, and whose example would benefit his  youthful relation.    [Footnote *36: For the biography of Castiglione, see  MARLIANI in the Cominana edition of the _Opere Volgari_  (Padua, 1733), and SERASSI, in _Poesie volgari e latine del  Castiglione_ (Roma, 1760), as well as the following works:--    MAZZUCHELLI, _Baldassare Castiglione_ (Narducci, Roma).

While he was still very  young he was attached to the Court of Il Moro. His father died in  1499 from a wound got at the battle of the Taro. He returned to  Casatico on the fall of Sforza, and then joined Marchese Francesco.]    The court of Urbino had already been for half a century the brightest  star in the constellation of Italian principalities, and under  its fostering influence were fully developed those fine qualities  which nature and early training had formed in Castiglione. His  first essay was as captain of fifty men-at-arms, with 400 ducats  of nominal pay, besides allowances; and his earliest exploit in  this new service was the reduction of Forli, in 1504. The finances  of Guidobaldo were necessarily at a low ebb, and it is amusing to  find Baldassare's frequent lamentations to his mother, over the  arrears of his pay:--\"Our doings are jolly but inconsiderable, that  is, on small means; we have never yet seen a farthing, but daily  and most devoutly look for some cash.\" It was not, however, till  nearly a year later that he received twenty-five ducats to account,  having often in the interval asked her aid, representing himself as  penniless, and living upon credit. In 1509,[*38] after returning  from his mission to England, which peculiarly required the graces  of a finished cavalier, and of which some account will be found in  II. of the Appendix, he attached himself to the Duke's immediate  person during the brief remainder of his life, and when it closed,  was sent to Gubbio, to maintain the interests of the succession, in  event of any popular outbreak. The favour which he had enjoyed from  Guidobaldo was amply continued under his nephew, whose fortunes he  followed during several years, sharing his successes in the field,  and sustaining him under his disgrace at the pontifical court. These  events must, however, be here touched with a flying pen, that we may  not anticipate details on which we shall afterwards have to dwell.  His reward was a grant of Novillara, near Pesaro; and when Francesco  Maria had exchanged sovereignty for exile, he returned to the service  of his natural lord, the Marquis of Mantua, whom he long represented  at the court of Leo X. To this Pontiff, Baldassare had nearly become  related, by a marriage with his niece Clarice de' Medici, which was  greatly promoted by Giuliano, during their residence at Urbino.  The negotiation was, however, broken off in January, 1509, by the  intrigues of her aunt, Lucrezia Salviati, who persuaded her uncle,  the Cardinal Giovanni, that, by bestowing her hand upon Filippo  Strozzi, he would strengthen the interest of his family at Florence.  The match having been, according to Italian usage, an interested  arrangement, its dissolution was borne with great philosophy by the  intended bridegroom; who some seven years later married Ippolita,  daughter of Count Guido Torelli, a celebrated condottiere, by  Francesca, daughter of Giovanni Bentivoglio, Lord of Bologna.[*39]  The ceremony was performed at Mantua, and was celebrated with  tournaments and pompous shows, in which the court and people took a  lively interest. But their happy union was of brief duration. The  Countess died four years after, in childbed of a daughter. Her name  has been embalmed in a beautiful Latin ode, wherein her husband  embodied those laments for his absence which he doubtless had often  heard from her lips, expressing all the tenderness of nuptial love,  and adorning a woman's pathos with a poet's fire. Nothing can be more  beautiful than the allusion to her husband's portrait:--         \"Your features portrayed by Raffaele's art       Alone my longings can solace in part:       On them I lavish jests and winning wiles,       As if their words could echo back my smiles;       At times they seem by gestures to respond,       And answer in your wonted accents fond:       Our boy his sire salutes with babbling phrase.       Such are the thoughts deceive my lingering days.\"    [Footnote *38: He was in England in 1506. Guidobaldo died in 1508. It  was to Duke Francesco he attached himself on his return.]    [Footnote *39: On the various designs for Castiglione's marriage, see  CIAN, _op. cit._, p. 46, note 1.]    In her epitaph, the Count summed up his wife's character and  endowments, with a doubt whether her beauty or her virtue were more  remarkable; to which her eulogist, Steffano Guazzo, has added a third  grace--her learning. During the first anguish of widowhood he was  supposed to have turned his thoughts to ecclesiastical orders; but  whatever views of that nature he may have entertained were speedily  abandoned; and in 1523 we find him again in Lombardy, with his  gallant company, under the banner of the Gonzagas.    On the accession of Clement VII., the Marquis of Mantua again sent  him to represent his interests at Rome, where he was not long in  obtaining from the new Pope the same favour which he had enjoyed  under his uncle, Leo X. His diplomatic talents were now acknowledged  as of the first order; and Clement, foreseeing, perhaps, the  impending difficulties of his position with the Emperor, prevailed  upon Castiglione to accept the nomination of nuncio to Madrid. His  courtly qualities were not less agreeable to Charles V. and the  grandees of Spain than they had been in Italy; and in the romantic  project by which the Emperor proposed to decide in single combat  his unquenchable rivalry with Francis I., the Count was selected as  his second,--an honour which his diplomatic functions prevented his  accepting. Even while the troops and name of Charles were used by  Bourbon to inflict upon the Apostolic See the greatest blow which  its capital had suffered since the temporal power of the Church  rose on the ruins of the Roman empire, the Nuncio was receiving new  honours at Madrid, and was only prevented by his own scruples  from obtaining the temporalities of the bishopric of Avila, one of  the richest in Spain. In this most delicate position he retained  the confidence of his master, who seems to have been satisfied that  to no remissness on his part were owing the horrors of the sack of  Rome. But these miserable results of jealousies between the Pope  and the Emperor, which all his tact and influence were powerless to  remove, rendered his position anything but enviable, and appear to  have preyed alike upon mind and body. He sank under a short illness  at Toledo, on the 2nd of February, 1529,[*40] and was lamented by  Charles as \"one of the best knights in the world.\" A letter of  condolence, written to his mother by Clement, affords ample evidence  that the fruitless results of his diplomacy in Spain had nowise  diminished the Pope's confidence in his good service and attachment  to his person.    [Footnote *40: He died on February 7th, not 2nd.]    [Illustration: _Alinari_    HAIR DRESSING IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY    _Detail from the fresco by Pisanello in S. Anastasia of Verona_]    In the _Cortegiano_ of Castiglione we are furnished with an  elaborate, and in the main faithful, delineation of the men, the  manners, and the accomplishments which rendered the court of Urbino  a model for his age, and also with an interesting picture of the  immediate circle which Guidobaldo and his estimable Duchess formed  around them. We have drawn upon it amply for this portion of our  volumes, but the notices which it affords of the Duke are of the  most vague and disappointing character. This deficiency would be  of little consequence, did the accounts which the same author  has left in a Latin letter to Henry VIII. do full justice to his  early patron. But from one whose opportunities of collecting ample  and authentic particulars were unusual, the passing allusions to  many momentous incidents are truly unsatisfactory. His details of  scholarship and accomplishments would be more valuable, if divested  of an air of exaggeration which even solemn asseverations of veracity  scarcely remove. With all their faults, these are preferable to the  compilation of Bembo, to which we shall in due time more particularly  advert. Those who wade through its laboured and redundant expletives  will probably come to the conclusion that Castiglione has preserved  whatever they contain worthy of notice.    The Count was a finished gentleman, in an age when that character  included a variety of mental acquirements, as well as many personal  accomplishments. His verses in Latin and Italian breathe a fine  spirit of poetry; his letters merit a distinguished place as models  of correspondence; his diplomatic address was highly approved by  the sovereigns"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/443"],[0,"The Love Affairs of a Bibliomaniac (#17)"],[1," will find the same harping upon the one  string of present decay and former virtue. Herodotus, Sallust, Caesar,  Cicero, and Pliny take up and repeat the lugubrious tale in turn.    Upon earth there are three distinct classes of men:  Those who  contemplate the past, those who contemplate the present, those who  contemplate the future.  I am of those who believe that humanity  progresses, and it is my theory that the best works of the past have  survived and come down to us in these books which are our dearest  legacies, our proudest possessions, and our best-beloved companions.        XV    A BOOK THAT BRINGS SOLACE AND CHEER    One of my friends had a mania for Bunyan once upon a time, and,  although he has now abandoned that fad for the more fashionable passion  of Napoleonana, he still exhibits with evident pride the many editions  of the \"Pilgrim's Progress\" he gathered together years ago.  I have  frequently besought him to give me one of his copies, which has a  curious frontispiece illustrating the dangers besetting the traveller  from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City.  This frontispiece,  which is prettily illuminated, occurs in Virtue's edition of the  \"Pilgrim's Progress\"; the book itself is not rare, but it is hardly  procurable in perfect condition, for the reason that the colored plate  is so pleasing to the eye that few have been able to resist the  temptation to make away with it.    For similar reasons it is seldom that we meet with a perfect edition of  Quarles' \"Emblems\"; indeed, an \"Emblems\" of early publication that does  not lack the title-page is a great rarity. In the \"good old days,\" when  juvenile books were few, the works of Bunyan and of Quarles were vastly  popular with the little folk, and little fingers wrought sad havoc with  the title-pages and the pictures that with their extravagant and vivid  suggestions appealed so directly and powerfully to the youthful fancy.    Coleridge says of the \"Pilgrim's Progress\" that it is the best summary  of evangelical Christianity ever produced by a writer not miraculously  inspired.  Froude declares that it has for two centuries affected the  spiritual opinions of the English race in every part of the world more  powerfully than any other book, except the Bible.  \"It is,\" says  Macaulay, \"perhaps the only book about which, after the lapse of a  hundred years, the educated minority has come over to the opinion of  the common people.\"    Whether or not Bunyan is, as D'Israeli has called him, the Spenser of  the people, and  whether or not his work is the poetry of Puritanism,  the best evidence of the merit of the \"Pilgrim's Progress\" appears, as  Dr. Johnson has shrewdly pointed out, in the general and continued  approbation of mankind.  Southey has critically observed that to his  natural style Bunyan is in some degree beholden for his general  popularity, his language being everywhere level to the most ignorant  reader and to the meanest capacity; \"there is a homely reality about  it--a nursery tale is not more intelligible, in its manner of  narration, to a child.\"    Another cause of his popularity, says Southey, is that he taxes the  imagination as little as the understanding.  \"The vividness of his own,  which, as history shows, sometimes could not distinguish ideal  impressions from actual ones, occasioned this. He saw the things of  which he was writing as distinctly with his mind's eye as if they were,  indeed, passing before him in a dream.\"    It is clear to me that in his youth Bunyan would have endeared himself  to me had I lived at that time, for his fancy was of that kind and of  such intensity as I delight to find in youth.  \"My sins,\" he tells us,  \"did so offend the Lord that even in my childhood He did scare and  affright me with fearful dreams and did terrify me with dreadful  visions.  I have been in my bed greatly afflicted, while asleep, with  apprehensions of devils and wicked spirits, who still, as I then  thought, labored to draw me away with them, of which I could never be  rid.\"    It is quite likely that Bunyan overestimated his viciousness. One of  his ardent, intense temperament having once been touched of the saving  grace could hardly help recognizing in himself the most miserable of  sinners.  It is related that upon one occasion he was going somewhere  disguised as a wagoner, when he was overtaken by a constable who had a  warrant for his arrest.    \"Do you know that devil of a fellow Bunyan?\" asked the constable.    \"Know him?\" cried Bunyan.  \"You might call him a devil indeed, if you  knew him as well as I once did!\"    This was not the only time his wit served him to good purpose. On  another occasion a certain Cambridge student, who was filled with a  sense of his own importance, undertook to prove to him what a divine  thing reason was, and he capped his argument with the declaration that  reason was the chief glory of man which distinguished him from a beast.  To this Bunyan calmly made answer:  \"Sin distinguishes man from beast;  is sin divine?\"    Frederick Saunders observes that, like Milton in his blindness, Bunyan  in his imprisonment had his spiritual perception made all the brighter  by his exclusion from the glare of the outside world.  And of the great  debt of gratitude we all owe to \"the wicked tinker of Elstow\" Dean  Stanley has spoken so truly that I am fain to quote his words:  \"We all  need to be cheered by the help of Greatheart and Standfast and  Valiant-for-the-Truth, and good old Honesty!  Some of us have been in  Doubting Castle, some in the Slough of Despond.  Some have experienced  the temptations of Vanity Fair; all of us have to climb the Hill of  Difficulty; all of us need to be instructed by the Interpreter in the  House Beautiful; all of us bear the same burden; all of us need the  same armor in our fight with Apollyon; all of us have to pass through  the Wicket Gate--to pass through the dark river, and for all of us (if  God so will) there wait the shining ones at the gates of the Celestial  City!  Who does not love to linger over the life story of the 'immortal  dreamer' as one of those characters for whom man has done so little and  God so much?\"    About my favorite copy of the \"Pilgrim's Progress\" many a pleasant  reminiscence lingers, for it was one of the books my grandmother gave  my father when he left home to engage in the great battle of life; when  my father died this thick, dumpy little volume, with its rude cuts and  poorly printed pages, came into my possession.  I do not know what part  this book played in my father's life, but I can say for myself that it  has brought me solace and cheer a many times.    The only occasion upon which I felt bitterly toward Dr. O'Rell was when  that personage observed in my hearing one day that Bunyan was a  dyspeptic, and that had he not been one he would doubtless never have  written the \"Pilgrim's Progress.\"    I took issue with the doctor on this point; whereupon he cited those  visions and dreams, which, according to the light of science as it now  shines, demonstrate that Bunyan's digestion must have been morbid.  And, forthwith, he overwhelmed me with learned instances from Galen and  Hippocrates, from Spurzheim and Binns, from Locke and Beattie, from  Malebranche and Bertholini, from Darwin and Descartes, from Charlevoix  and Berkeley, from Heraclitus and Blumenbach, from Priestley and  Abercrombie; in fact, forsooth, he quoted me so many authorities that  it verily seemed to me as though the whole world were against me!    I did not know until then that Dr. O'Rell had made a special study of  dreams, of their causes and of their signification.  I had always  supposed that astrology was his particular hobby, in which science I  will concede him to be deeply learned, even though he has never yet  proved to my entire satisfaction that the reason why my copy of  Justinian has faded from a royal purple to a  pale blue is, first,  because the binding was renewed at the wane of the moon and when Sirius  was in the ascendant, and, secondly, because (as Dr. O'Rell has  discovered) my binder was born at a moment fifty-six years ago when  Mercury was in the fourth house and Herschel and Saturn were aspected  in conjunction, with Sol at his northern declination.    Dr. O'Rell has frequently expressed surprise that I have never wearied  of and drifted away from the book-friendships of my earlier years.  Other people, he says, find, as time elapses, that they no longer  discover those charms in certain books which attracted them so  powerfully in youth.  \"We have in our earlier days,\" argues the doctor,  \"friendships so dear to us that we would repel with horror the  suggestion that we could ever become heedless or forgetful of them;  yet, alas, as we grow older we gradually become indifferent to these  first friends, and we are weaned from them by other friendships; there  even comes a time when we actually wonder how it were possible for us  to be on terms of intimacy with  such or such a person.  We grow away  from people, and in like manner and for similar reasons we grow away  from books.\"    Is it indeed possible for one to become indifferent to an object he has  once loved?  I can hardly believe so.  At least it is not so with me,  and, even though the time may come when I shall no longer be able to  enjoy the uses of these dear old friends with the old-time enthusiasm,  I should still regard them with that tender reverence which in his age  the poet Longfellow expressed when looking round upon his beloved books:      Sadly as some old mediaeval knight        Gazed at the arms he could no longer wield--        The sword two-handed and the shining shield    Suspended in the hall and full in sight,    While secret longings for the lost delight        Of tourney or adventure in the field        Came over him, and tears but half concealed    Trembled and fell upon his beard of white;    So I behold these books"]]]
