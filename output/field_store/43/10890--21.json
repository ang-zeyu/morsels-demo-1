Let the water be warm but  not hot, put the cat in slowly, and when its feet rest on the bottom of  the tub, you may commence the washing.    Mr. A. A. Clarke, the well-known cat fancier, says: \"I seldom wash my  cats, I rather prefer giving them a good clean straw-bed, and attending  to their general health and condition, and they will then very seldom  require washing. I find that much washing makes the coat harsh and poor,  and I also know from experience that it is 'a work of art' to wash a  cat properly, and requires an artist in that way to do it. My plan is to  prepare some liquid soap, by cutting a piece into shreds, and putting it  into cold water, and then boiling it for an hour. I then have two clean  tubs got ready, one to wash, the other to rinse in. Have soft water  about blood heat, with a very small piece of soda in the washing-tub,  into which I place the cat, hind-quarters first, having some one that it  knows perfectly well, to hold and talk to the cat while the washing is  going on. I begin with the tail, and thoroughly rubbing in the soap with  my hands, and getting by degrees over the body and shoulders up to the  ears, leaving the head until the cat is rinsed in the other tub, which  ought to be half filled with warm soft water, into which I place the  cat, and thoroughly rinse out all the soap, when at the same time I wash  the head, and I then sit in front of the fire and dry with warm towels;  and if it is done well and thoroughly, it is a good three hours' hard  work.\"    I would add to the foregoing that I should use Naldire's dog soap, which  I have found excellent in all ways, and it also destroys any insect life  that may be present.    Also in washing, be careful not to move the hands in circles, or the  hair will become entangled and knotty, and very difficult to untwist or  unravel. Take the hair in the hands, and press the softened soap through  and through the interstices, and when rinsing do the same with the  water, using a large sponge for the purpose. After drying I should put  the cat in a box lightly, full of oat straw, and place it in front of,  or near a fire, at such distance as not to become too warm, and only  near enough to prevent a chill before the cat is thoroughly dry.      MATING.        Yet nature is made better by no mean,      But nature makes that mean: so, o'er that art,      Which, you say, adds to nature, is an art      That nature makes.                                        _Coriolanus, Act II. Scene I._    This requires much and careful consideration, and in this, as well as in  many other things, experience and theory join hands, while the knowledge  of the naturalist and fancier is of great and superlative value; yet,  with all combined, anything like certainty can never be assured,  although the possession of pedigree is added, and the different  properties of food, health, quality, and breed understood and taken into  account. Still, much may be gained by continued observation and close  study of the peculiar properties of colour, besides that of form. If,  for instance, a really, absolutely _blue_ cat, without a shade of any  other colour, were obtainable, and likewise a pure, clear, canary  yellow, there is little doubt that at a distant period, a green would be  the ultimate goal of success. But the yellow tabby is not a yellow, nor  the blue a blue. There being, then, only a certain variety of colours in  cats, the tints to be gained are limited entirely to a certain set of  such colours, and the numerous shades and half-shades of these mixed,  broken, or not, into tints, markings light or dark, as desired. To all  colour arrangements, if I may so call them, by the mind, intellect, or  hand of man, there is a limit, beyond which none can go. It is thus far  and no further.    There is the black cat, and the white; and between these are intervening  shades, from very light, or white-gray, to darker, blue, dark blue,  blackish blue, gray and black. If a blue-black is used, the lighter  colours are of one tint; if a brown-black, they are another.    Then in what are termed the sandies and browns, it commences with the  yellow-white tint scarcely visible apart from white to the uninitiated  eye; then darker and darker, until it culminates in deep brown, with the  intervening yellows, reds, chestnuts, mahoganys, and such colours, which  generally are striped with a darker colour of nearly their own shade,  until growing denser, it ends in brown-black.    The gray tabby has a ground colour of gray. In this there are the  various shades from little or no markings, leaving the colour a brown or  gray, or the gray gradually disappearing before the advance of the black  in broader and broader bands, until the first is excluded and black is  the result.    The tortoiseshell is a mixture of colours in patches, and is certainly  an exhibition of what may be done by careful selection, mating, and  crossing of an animal while under the control of man, in a state of  thorough domestication. What the almond tumbler is to the pigeon  fancier, so is the tortoiseshell cat to the cat fancier, or the bizarre  tulip to the florist. As regards colour, it is a triumph of art over  nature, by the means of skilful, careful mating, continued with  unwearying patience. We get the same combination of colour in the  guinea-pig, both male and female, and therefore this is in part a proof  that by proper mating, eventually a tortoiseshell male cat should soon  be by no means a rarity. There are rules, which, if strictly followed  under favourable conditions, ought to produce certain properties, such  properties that may be desired, either by foolish (which generally it  is) fashion, or the production of absolute beauty of form, markings in  colours, or other brilliant effects, and which the true fanciers  endeavour to obtain. It is to this latter I shall address my remarks,  rather than to the reproduction of the curious, the inelegant, or the  deformed, such as an undesirable number of toes, which are impediments  to utility.    In the first place, the fancier must thoroughly make up his mind as to  the variety of form, colour, association of colours or markings by  which he wishes to produce, if possible, perfection; and, having done  so, he must provide himself with such stock as, on being mated, are  likely to bring such progeny as will enable him in due time to attain  the end he has in view. This being gained, he must also prepare himself  for many disappointments, which are the more likely to accrue from the  reason that, in all probability, he starts without any knowledge of the  ancestry or pedigree of the animals with which he begins his operations.  Therefore, for this reason, he has to gain his knowledge of any aptitude  for divergence from the ordinary or the common they may exhibit, or  which his practical experience discovers, and thus, as it were, build up  a family with certain points and qualities before he can actually embark  in the real business of accurately matching and crossing so as to  produce the results which, by a will, undeviating perseverance, and  patience, he is hoping to gain eventually--the perfection he so long,  ardently, and anxiously seeks to acquire; but he must bear in mind that  that, on which he sets his mark, though high, must come within the  limits and compass of that which _is_ attainable, for it is not the  slightest use to attempt that which is not within the charmed circle of  possibilities.      TORTOISESHELLS.    I place these first on the list because, being an old pigeon fancier and  somewhat of a florist, I deem these to be the breed wherein there is the  most art and skill required to produce properly all the varied mottled  beauty of bright colours that a cat of this breed should possess; and  those who have bred tortoiseshells well know how difficult a task it is.    In breeding for this splendid, gorgeous, and diversified arrangement of  colouring, a black, or even a blue, may be used with a yellow or red  tabby female, or a white male, supposing either or both were the  offspring of a tortoiseshell mother. The same males might be used with  advantage with a tortoiseshell female. This is on the theory of whole  colours, and patches or portions of whole colours, without bars or  markings when possible. In the same way some of the best almond tumbler  pigeons are bred from an almond cock mated to a yellow hen. The  difficulty here, until lately, has been to breed hens of the varied  mottling on almond colour, the hen almost invariably coming nearly, if  not quite yellow--so much so that forty to fifty years ago a yellow hen  was considered as a pair to an almond cock, in the same way as the red  tabby male is now regarded in respect to the tortoiseshell female; and  it was not until at Birmingham, many years ago, when acting as judge, I  refused to award prizes to them as such, that the effort was made, and a  successful one, to breed almond-coloured hens with the same plumage as  the cock--that is, the three colours. With cats the matter is entirely  different, it being the male at present that is the difficulty, if a  real difficulty it may be called.    Mr. Herbert Young, a most excellent cat fancier and authority on the  subject, is of opinion that if a tortoiseshell male cat could be found,  it would not prove fertile with a tortoiseshell female. But of this I am  very doubtful, because, if the red and the yellow tabby is so, which is  decidedly a weaker colour, I do not see how it can possess more vitality  than a cat marked with the _three_ colours; in fact the latter ought, in  reality, to be more prolific, having black as one of the colours, which  is a strong colour, blue being only the weak substitute, or with white  _combined_. A whole black is one of the strongest colours and most  powerful of cats.    Reverting once again to"]]]
