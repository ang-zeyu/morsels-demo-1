In that world of floating fancies there was a  struggle for life; there were myths which never emerged from that  first stage of popular conception, or were absorbed by stronger  competitors, because, as some true heroes have done, they lacked the  sacred poet or prophet, and were never remodelled by literature;  while, out of the myth of Demeter, under the careful conduct of  poetry and art, came the little pictures, the idylls, of the Homeric  hymn, and the gracious imagery of Praxiteles.  The myth has now  entered its second or poetical phase, then, in which more definite  fancies are grouped about the primitive stock, in a conscious  literary temper, and the whole interest settles round the images of  the beautiful girl going down into the darkness, and the weary woman  who seeks her lost daughter--divine persons, then sincerely believed  in by the majority of the Greeks.  The Homeric hymn [114] is the  central monument of this second phase.  In it, the changes of the  natural year have become a personal history, a story of human  affection and sorrow, yet with a far-reaching religious significance  also, of which the mere earthly spring and autumn are but an analogy;  and in the development of this human element, the writer of the hymn  sometimes displays a genuine power of pathetic expression.  The whole  episode of the fostering of Demophoon, in which over the body of the  dying child human longing and regret are blent so subtly with the  mysterious design of the goddess to make the child immortal, is an  excellent example of the sentiment of pity in literature.  Yet though  it has reached the stage of conscious literary interpretation, much  of its early mystical or cosmical character still lingers about the  story, as it is here told.  Later mythologists simply define the  personal history; but in this hymn we may, again and again, trace  curious links of connexion with the original purpose of the myth.  Its subject is the weary woman, indeed, our Lady of Sorrows, the  mater dolorosa of the ancient world, but with a certain latent  reference, all through, to the mystical person of the earth.  Her  robe of dark blue is the raiment of her mourning, but also the blue  robe of the earth in shadow, as we see it in Titian's landscapes; her  great age is the age of the immemorial earth; she becomes a nurse,  therefore, holding Demophoon in her bosom; [115] the folds of her  garment are fragrant, not merely with the incense of Eleusis, but  with the natural perfume of flowers and fruit.  The sweet breath with  which she nourishes the child Demophoon, is the warm west wind,  feeding all germs of vegetable life; her bosom, where he lies, is the  bosom of the earth, with its strengthening heat, reserved and shy,  offended if human eyes scrutinise too closely its secret chemistry;  it is with the earth's natural surface of varied colour that she has,  \"in time past, given pleasure to the sun\"; the yellow hair which  falls suddenly over her shoulders, at her transformation in the house  of Celeus, is still partly the golden corn;--in art and poetry she is  ever the blond goddess; tarrying in her temple, of which an actual  hollow in the earth is the prototype, among the spicy odours of the  Eleusinian ritual, she is the spirit of the earth, lying hidden in  its dark folds until the return of spring, among the flower-seeds and  fragrant roots, like the seeds and aromatic woods hidden in the  wrappings of the dead.  Throughout the poem, we have a sense of a  certain nearness to nature, surviving from an earlier world; the sea  is understood as a person, yet is still the real sea, with the waves  moving.  When it is said that no bird gave Demeter tidings of  Persephone, we feel that to that earlier world, ways of communication  between all creatures may have seemed open, which are closed to us.  It is Iris who brings to Demeter the message of Zeus; [116] that is,  the rainbow signifies to the earth the good-will of the rainy sky  towards it.  Persephone springing up with great joy from the couch of  Aidoneus, to return to her mother, is the sudden outburst of the  year.  The heavy and narcotic aroma of spring flowers hangs about  her, as about the actual spring.  And this mingling of the primitive  cosmical import of the myth with the later, personal interests of the  story, is curiously illustrated by the place which the poem assigns  to Hecate.  This strange Titaness is, first, a nymph only;  afterwards, as if changed incurably by the passionate cry of  Persephone, she becomes her constant attendant, and is even  identified with her.  But in the Homeric hymn her lunar character is  clear; she is really the moon only, who hears the cry of Persephone,  as the sun saw her, when Aidoneus carried her away.  One morning, as  the mother wandered, the moon appeared, as it does in its last  quarter, rising very bright, just before dawn; that is, in the words  of the Homeric hymn--\"on the tenth morning Hecate met her, having a  light in her hands.\"  The fascinating, but enigmatical figure,  \"sitting ever in her cave, half-veiled with a shining veil, thinking  delicate thoughts,\" in which we seem to see the subject of some  picture of the Italian Renaissance, is but the lover of Endymion--  like Persephone, withdrawn, in her season, from the eyes of men.  The  sun saw her; the moon saw her not, but heard her cry, and is [117]  ever after the half-veiled attendant of the queen of dreams and of  the dead.    But the story of Demeter and Persephone lends itself naturally to  description, and it is in descriptive beauties that the Homeric hymn  excels; its episodes are finished designs, and directly stimulate the  painter and the sculptor to a rivalry with them.  Weaving the names  of the flowers into his verse, names familiar to us in English,  though their Greek originals are uncertain, the writer sets  Persephone before us, herself like one of them--kalykôpis+--like the  budding calyx of a flower,--in a picture, which, in its mingling of a  quaint freshness and simplicity with a certain earnestness, reads  like a description of some early Florentine design, such as Sandro  Botticelli's Allegory of the Seasons.  By an exquisite chance also, a  common metrical expression connects the perfume of the newly-created  narcissus with the salt odour of the sea.  Like one of those early  designs also, but with a deeper infusion of religious earnestness, is  the picture of Demeter sitting at the wayside, in shadow as always,  with the well of water and the olive-tree.  She has been journeying  all night, and now it is morning, and the daughters of Celeus bring  their vessels to draw water.  That image of the seated Demeter,  resting after her long flight \"through the dark continent,\" or in the  house of Celeus, when she refuses the red wine, or again, solitary,  in her newly-finished [118] temple of Eleusis, enthroned in her  grief, fixed itself deeply on the Greek imagination, and became a  favourite subject of Greek artists.  When the daughters of Celeus  come to conduct her to Eleusis, they come as in a Greek frieze, full  of energy and motion and waving lines, but with gold and colours upon  it.  Eleusis--coming--the coming of Demeter thither, as thus told in  the Homeric hymn, is the central instance in Greek mythology of such  divine appearances.  \"She leaves for a season the company of the gods  and abides among men;\" and men's merit is to receive her in spite of  appearances.  Metaneira and others, in the Homeric hymn, partly  detect her divine character; they find charis+;--a certain gracious  air--about her, which makes them think her, perhaps, a royal person  in disguise.  She becomes in her long wanderings almost wholly  humanised, and in return, she and Persephone, alone of the Greek  gods, seem to have been the objects of a sort of personal love and  loyalty.  Yet they are ever the solemn goddesses,--theai semnai,+  the word expressing religious awe, the Greek sense of the divine  presence.    Plato, in laying down the rules by which the poets are to be guided  in speaking about divine things to the citizens of the ideal  republic, forbids all those episodes of mythology which represent the  gods as assuming various forms, and visiting the earth in disguise.  Below the [119] express reasons which he assigns for this rule, we  may perhaps detect that instinctive antagonism to the old"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4042"],[0,"Mozart: The Man and the Artist, as Revealed in His Own Words (#17)"],[1,"will never  return. Now we are sunk in the emptiness of everyday life.\"    (Remarked on remembering that at the age of fourteen he had  composed a \"Requiem\" at the command of Empress Maria Theresa and  had conducted it as chapelmaster of the imperial orchestra.)    226. \"Did I not tell you that I was composing this 'Requiem' for  myself?\"    (Said on the day of his death while still working on the  \"Requiem\" for which he had received so mysterious a commission.  The work had been ordered by a Count Walsegg, who made  pretensions to musical composition, and who wished to palm it off  as a work of his own, written in memory of his wife. Mozart never  knew him.)    227. \"I shall not last much longer. I am sure that I have been  poisoned! I can not rid myself of this thought.\"    (Mozart believed that he had been poisoned by one of his Italian  rivals, his suspicion falling most strongly on Salieri. [\"As  regards Mozart, Salieri cannot escape censure, for though the  accusation of having been the cause of his death has been long  ago disproved, it is more than possible that he was not  displeased at the removal of so formidable a rival. At any rate,  though he had it in his power to influence the Emperor in  Mozart's favor, he not only neglected to do so, but even  intrigued against him as Mozart himself relates in a letter to  his friend Puchberg. After his death, however, Salieri befriended  his son, and gave him a testimonial which secured him his first  appointment.\" C.F. Pohl, in \"Grove's Dictionary of Music and  Musicians.\"])    228. \"Stay with me to-night; you must see me die. I have long had  the taste of death on my tongue, I smell death, and who will  stand by my Constanze, if you do not stay?\"    (Reported by his sister-in-law, Sophie, sister of Constanze.)    229. \"And now I must go just as it had become possible for me to  live quietly. Now I must leave my art just as I had freed myself  from the slavery of fashion, had broken the bonds of speculators,  and won the privilege of following my own feelings and compose  freely and independently whatever my heart prompted! I must away  from my family, from my poor children in the moment when I should  have been able better to care for their welfare!\"    (Uttered on his death-bed.)        MORALS        As regards his manner of life and morals Mozart long stood in a  bad light before the world. The slanderous stories all came from  his enemies in Vienna, and a long time passed before their true  character was recognized. A great contribution to this end was  made by the publication of his letters, which disclose an  extraordinarily strong moral sense. The tale of an alleged  liaison with a certain Frau Hofdamel, as a result of which the  deceived husband was said to have committed suicide, has been  proved to be wholly untrue and without warrant.    It may be said, indeed, that Mozart was an exception among the  men of his period. The immorality of the Viennese was proverbial.  Karoline Pichler, a contemporary, writes as follows in her book  of recollections of the eighth decade of the eighteenth century:  \"In Vienna at the time there reigned a spirit of appreciation for  merriment and a susceptibility for every form of beauty and  sensuous pleasure. There was the greatest freedom of thought and  opinion; anything could be written and printed which was not, in  the strictest sense of the words, contrary to religion and the  state. Little thought was bestowed on good morals. There was  considerable license in the current plays and novels. Kotzebue  created a tremendous sensation. His plays...and a multitude of  romances and tales (Meissner's sketches among other things) were  all based on meretricious relations. All the world and every  young girl read them without suspicion or offence. More than once  had I read and seen these things; 'Oberon' was well known to me;  so was Meissner's 'Alcibiades.' No mother hesitated to acquaint  her daughter with such works and before our eyes there were so  many living exemplars whose irregular conduct was notorious, that  no mother could have kept her daughter in ignorance had she  tried.\"    Mozart was a passionate jester and his jokes were coarse enough;  of that there is no doubt. But these things were innocent at the  time. The letters of the lad to his little cousin in Augsburg  contain many passages that would be called of questionable  propriety now; but the little cousin does not seem to have even  blushed. The best witness to the morality of Mozart's life is his  wife, who, after his death, wrote to the publishing firm of  Breitkopf and Hartel: \"His letters are beyond doubt the best  criterion for his mode of thought, his peculiarities and his  education. Admirably characteristic is his extraordinary love for  me, which breathes through all his letters. Those of his last  year on earth are just as tender as those which he must have  written in the first year of our married life;--is it not so? I  beg as a particular favor that special attention be called to  this fact for the sake of his honor.\"    He was a Freemason with all his heart, and gave expression to his  humanitarian feeling in his opera \"The Magic Flute.\" Without  suspicion himself, he thought everybody else good, which led to  painful experiences with some of his friends.    230. \"Parents strive to place their children in a position which  shall enable them to earn their own living; and this they owe to  their children and the state. The greater the talents with which  the children have been endowed by God, the more are they bound to  make use of those talents to improve the conditions of themselves  and their parents, to aid their parents and to care for their own  present and future welfare. We are taught thus to trade with our  talents in the Gospels. I owe it, therefore, to God and my  conscience to pay the highest gratitude to my father, who  tirelessly devoted all his hours to my education, and to lighten  his burdens.\"    (From his request for dismissal from service in August, 1777. He  wished to undertake an artistic tour with his father. He received  his dismissal from the Archbishop of Salzburg, who granted it  right unwillingly, however.)    231. \"Only one thing vexed me a trifle,--the question whether I  had forgotten confession. I have no complaint to make, but I do  ask one favor, and that is that you do not think so ill of me!  I am fond of merriment, but, believe me, I can also be serious.  Since I left Salzburg (and while still in Salzburg) I have met  persons whose conduct was such that I would have been ashamed to  talk and act as they did though they were ten, twenty or thirty  years older than I! Again I humbly beg of you to have a better  opinion of me.\"    (Mannheim, December 30, 1777, to his father, in answer to a  letter of reproaches.)    232. \"With all my heart I do wish Herr von Schiedenhofen joy. It  is another marriage for money and nothing else. I should not like  to marry thus; I want to make my wife happy,--not have her make  my fortune. For that reason I shall not marry but enjoy my golden  freedom until I am so situated that I can support wife and  children. It was necessary that Herr Sch. should marry a rich  woman; that's the consequence of being a nobleman. The nobility  must never marry from inclination or love, but only from  considerations of interest, and all manner of side  considerations. Nor would it be becoming in such persons if they  were still to love their wives after the latter had done their  duty and brought forth a plump heir.\"    (Mannheim, February 7, 1778, to his father.)    233. \"In my opinion there is nothing more shameful than to  deceive an honest girl.\"    (Paris, July 18, 1778, to his father.)    234. \"I am unconscious of any guilt for which I might fear your  reproaches. I have committed no error (meaning by error any act  unbecoming to a Christian and an honest man). I am anticipating  the pleasantest and happiest days, but only in company with you  and my dearest sister. I swear to you on my honor that I can not  endure Salzburg and its citizens (I speak of the natives). Their  speech and mode of life are utterly intolerable.\"    (Munich, January 8, 1779, to his father, who was urging his  return from Paris to take the post of chapelmaster in Salzburg.  The musicians of Salzburg were notorious because of their loose  lives.)    235. \"From the way in which my last letter was received I observe  to my sorrow that (just as if I were an arch scoundrel or an ass,  or both at once) you trust the tittle-tattle and scribblings of  other people more than you do me. But I assure you that this does  not give me the least concern. The people may write the eyes out  of their heads, and you may applaud them as much as you please,  it will not cause me to change a hair's breadth; I shall remain  the same honest fellow that I have always been.\"    (Vienna, September 5, 1781, to his father, who was still  listening to the slander mongers. Mozart could not lightly forget  the fact that it was due to these gentlemen that he had been  forced to leave the house of the widow Weber with whose daughter  Constanze he was in love.)    236. \"You have been deceived in your son if you could believe him  capable of doing a mean thing....You know that I could not have  acted otherwise without outraging my conscience and my honor....I  beg pardon for my too hasty trust in your paternal love. Through  this frank confession you have a new proof of my love of truth  and detestation of a lie.\"    (Vienna, August 7, 1782, to his father, whose consent to his  son's marriage did not arrive till the day after.)    237. \"Dearest and best of fathers:--I beg of you, for the sake of  all that is good in the world, give your consent to my marriage  with my dear Constanze. Do not think that it is alone because of  my desire to get married; I could well wait. But I see that it is  absolutely essential to my honor, the honor "]]]
