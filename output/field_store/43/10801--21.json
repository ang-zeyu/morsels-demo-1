And if Thiodolf's heart were overcast, his face  showed it not, but he passed from hall to wain-burg and from wain-burg to  hall again blithe and joyous with all men.  And thereby he raised the  hearts of men, and they deemed it good that they had gotten such a War-  duke, meet to uphold all hearts of men both at the feast and in the fray.          CHAPTER X--THAT CARLINE COMETH TO THE ROOF OF THE WOLFINGS      Now it was three days after this that the women were gathering to the  Women's-Chamber of the Roof of the Wolfings a little before the afternoon  changes into evening.  The hearts of most were somewhat heavy, for the  doubt wherewith they had watched the departure of the fighting-men still  hung about them; nor had they any tidings from the host (nor was it like  that they should have).  And as they were somewhat down-hearted, so it  seemed by the aspect of all things that afternoon.  It was not yet the  evening, as is aforesaid, but the day was worn and worsened, and all  things looked weary.  The sky was a little clouded, but not much; yet was  it murky down in the south-east, and there was a threat of storm in it,  and in the air close round each man's head, and in the very waving of the  leafy boughs.  There was by this time little doing in field and fold (for  the kine were milked), and the women were coming up from the acres and  the meadow and over the open ground anigh the Roof; there was the grass  worn and dusty, and the women that trod it, their feet were tanned and  worn, and dusty also; skin-dry and weary they looked, with the sweat  dried upon them; their girt-up gowns grey and lightless, their  half-unbound hair blowing about them in the dry wind, which had in it no  morning freshness, and no evening coolness.    It was a time when toil was well-nigh done, but had left its aching  behind it; a time for folk to sleep and forget for a little while, till  the low sun should make it evening, and make all things fair with his  level rays; no time for anxious thoughts concerning deeds doing, wherein  the anxious ones could do nought to help.  Yet such thoughts those stay-  at-homes needs must have in the hour of their toil scarce over, their  rest and mirth not begun.    Slowly one by one the women went in by the Women's-door, and the Hall-Sun  sat on a stone hard by, and watched them as they passed; and she looked  keenly at all persons and all things.  She had been working in the acres,  and her hand was yet on the hoe she had been using, and but for her face  her body was as of one resting after toil: her dark blue gown was  ungirded, her dark hair loose and floating, the flowers that had wreathed  it, now faded, lying strewn upon the grass before her: her feet bare for  coolness' sake, her left hand lying loose and open upon her knee.    Yet though her body otherwise looked thus listless, in her face was no  listlessness, nor rest: her eyes were alert and clear, shining like two  stars in the heavens of dawn-tide; her lips were set close, her brow  knit, as of one striving to shape thoughts hard to understand into words  that all might understand.    So she sat noting all things, as woman by woman went past her into the  hall, till at last she slowly rose to her feet; for there came two young  women leading between them that same old carline with whom she had talked  on the Hill-of-Speech.  She looked on the carline steadfastly, but gave  no token of knowing her; but the ancient woman spoke when she came near  to the Hall-Sun, and old as her semblance was, yet did her speech sound  sweet to the Hall-Sun, and indeed to all those that heard it and she  said:    \"May we be here to-night, O Hall-Sun, thou lovely Seeress of the mighty  Wolfings? may a wandering woman sit amongst you and eat the meat of the  Wolfings?\"    Then spake the Hall-Sun in a sweet measured voice: \"Surely mother: all  men who bring peace with them are welcome guests to the Wolfings: nor  will any ask thine errand, but we will let thy tidings flow from thee as  thou wilt.  This is the custom of the kindred, and no word of mine own; I  speak to thee because thou hast spoken to me, but I have no authority  here, being myself but an alien.  Albeit I serve the House of the  Wolfings, and I love it as the hound loveth his master who feedeth him,  and his master's children who play with him.  Enter, mother, and be glad  of heart, and put away care from thee.\"    Then the old woman drew nigher to her and sat down in the dust at her  feet, for she was now sitting down again, and took her hand and kissed it  and fondled it, and seemed loth to leave handling the beauty of the Hall-  Sun; but she looked kindly on the carline, and smiled on her, and leaned  down to her, and kissed her mouth, and said:    \"Damsels, take care of this poor woman, and make her good cheer; for she  is wise of wit, and a friend of the Wolfings; and I have seen her before,  and spoken with her; and she loveth us.  But as for me I must needs be  alone in the meads for a while; and it may be that when I come to you  again, I shall have a word to tell you.\"    Now indeed it was in a manner true that the Hall-Sun had no authority in  the Wolfing House; yet was she so well beloved for her wisdom and beauty  and her sweet speech, that all hastened to do her will in small matters  and in great, and now as they looked at her after the old woman had  caressed her, it seemed to them that her fairness grew under their eyes,  and that they had never seen her so fair; and the sight of her seemed so  good to them, that the outworn day and its weariness changed to them, and  it grew as pleasant as the first hours of the sunlight, when men arise  happy from their rest, and look on the day that lieth hopeful before them  with all its deeds to be.    So they grew merry, and they led the carline into the Hall with them, and  set her down in the Women's-Chamber, and washed her feet, and gave her  meat and drink, and bade her rest and think of nothing troublous, and in  all wise made her good cheer; and she was merry with them, and praised  their fairness and their deftness, and asked them many questions about  their weaving and spinning and carding; (howbeit the looms were idle as  then because it was midsummer, and the men gone to the war).  And this  they deemed strange, as it seemed to them that all women should know of  such things; but they thought it was a token that she came from far away.    But afterwards she sat among them, and told them pleasant tales of past  times and far countries, and was blithe to them and they to her and the  time wore on toward nightfall in the Women's-Chamber.          CHAPTER XI--THE HALL-SUN SPEAKETH      But for the Hall-Sun; she sat long on that stone by the Women's-door; but  when the evening was now come, she arose and went down through the  cornfields and into the meadow, and wandered away as her feet took her.    Night was falling by then she reached that pool of Mirkwood-water, whose  eddies she knew so well.  There she let the water cover her in the deep  stream, and she floated down and sported with the ripples where the river  left that deep to race over the shallows; and the moon was casting  shadows by then she came up the bank again by the shallow end bearing in  her arms a bundle of the blue-flowering mouse-ear.  Then she clad herself  at once, and went straight as one with a set purpose toward the Great  Roof, and entered by the Man's-door; and there were few men within and  they but old and heavy with the burden of years and the coming of night-  tide; but they wondered and looked to each other and nodded their heads  as she passed them by, as men who would say, There is something toward.    So she went to her sleeping-place, and did on fresh raiment, and came  forth presently clad in white and shod with gold and having her hair  wreathed about with the herb of wonder, the blue-flowering mouse-ear of  Mirkwood-water.  Thus she passed through the Hall, and those elders were  stirred in their hearts when they beheld her beauty.  But she opened the  door of the Women's-Chamber, and stood on the threshold; and lo, there  sat the carline amidst a ring of the Wolfing women, and she telling them  tales of old time such as they had not yet heard; and her eyes were  glittering, and the sweet words were flowing from her mouth; but she sat  straight up like a young woman; and at whiles it seemed to those who  hearkened, that she was no old and outworn woman, but fair and strong,  and of much avail.  But when she heard the Hall-Sun she turned and saw  her on the threshold, and her speech fell suddenly, and all that might  and briskness faded from her, and she fixed her eyes on the Hall-Sun and  looked wistfully and anxiously on her.    Then spake the Hall-Sun standing in the doorway:       \"Hear ye a matter, maidens, and ye Wolfing women all,     And thou alien guest of the Wolfings!  But come ye up the hall,     That the ancient men may hearken: for methinks I have a word     Of the battle of the Kindreds, and the harvest of the sword.\"    Then all arose up with great joy, for they knew that the tidings were  good, when they looked on the face of the Hall-Sun and beheld the pride  of her beauty unmarred by doubt or pain.    She led them forth to the dais, and there were the sick and the elders  gathered and some ancient men of the thralls: so she stepped lightly up  to her place, and stood under her namesake, the wondrous lamp of ancient  days.  And thus she spake:       \"On my soul there lies no burden, and no tangle of the fight     In plain or dale or wild-wood enmeshes now my sight.     I see the Markmen's wain-burg, and I see"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2888"],[0,"Yorkshire Dialect Poems (1673-1915) and traditional poems (#17)"],[1," iverything's nut stowed away       To cumulate frae day to day.
