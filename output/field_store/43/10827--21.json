By this may be seen, that the language we have adopted is both copious  and expressive. The first or lowest degree of oxygenation in bodies,  converts them into _oxyds_; a second degree of additional oxygenation  constitutes the class of acids, of which the specific names, drawn from  their particular bases, terminate in _ous_, as the _nitrous_ and  _sulphurous_ acids; the third degree of oxygenation changes these into  the species of acids distinguished by the termination in ic, as the  _nitric_ and _sulphuric_ acids; and, lastly, we can express a fourth, or  highest degree of oxygenation, by adding the word _oxygenated_ to the  name of the acid, as has been already done with the _oxygenated  muriatic_ acid.    We have not confined the term _oxyd_ to expressing the combinations of  metals with oxygen, but have extended it to signify that first degree of  oxygenation in all bodies, which, without converting them into acids,  causes them to approach to the nature of salts. Thus, we give the name  of _oxyd of sulphur_ to that soft substance into which sulphur is  converted by incipient combustion; and we call the yellow matter left by  phosphorus, after combustion, by the name of _oxyd of phosphorus_. In  the same manner, nitrous gas, which is azote in its first degree of  oxygenation, is the _oxyd of azote_. We have likewise oxyds in great  numbers from the vegetable and animal kingdoms; and I shall show, in the  sequel, that this new language throws great light upon all the  operations of art and nature.    We have already observed, that almost all the metallic oxyds have  peculiar and permanent colours. These vary not only in the different  species of metals, but even according to the various degrees of  oxygenation in the same metal. Hence we are under the necessity of  adding two epithets to each oxyd, one of which indicates the metal  _oxydated_[15], while the other indicates the peculiar colour of the  oxyd. Thus, we have the black oxyd of iron, the red oxyd of iron, and  the yellow oxyd of iron; which expressions respectively answer to the  old unmeaning terms of martial ethiops, colcothar, and rust of iron, or  ochre. We have likewise the gray, yellow, and red oxyds of lead, which  answer to the equally false or insignificant terms, ashes of lead,  massicot, and minium.    These denominations sometimes become rather long, especially when we  mean to indicate whether the metal has been oxydated in the air, by  detonation with nitre, or by means of acids; but then they always convey  just and accurate ideas of the corresponding object which we wish to  express by their use. All this will be rendered perfectly clear and  distinct by means of the tables which are added to this work.    FOOTNOTES:    [15] Here we see the word oxyd converted into the verb _to oxydate_,  _oxydated_, _oxydating_, after the same manner with the derivation of  the verb _to oxygenate_, _oxygenated_, _oxygenating_, from the word  _oxygen_. I am not clear of the absolute necessity of this second verb  here first introduced, but think, in a work of this nature, that it is  the duty of the translator to neglect every other consideration for the  sake of strict fidelity to the ideas of his author.--E.          CHAP. VIII.    _Of the Radical Principle of Water, and of its Decomposition by Charcoal  and Iron._      Until very lately, water has always been thought a simple substance,  insomuch that the older chemists considered it as an element. Such it  undoubtedly was to them, as they were unable to decompose it; or, at  least, since the decomposition which took place daily before their eyes  was entirely unnoticed. But we mean to prove, that water is by no means  a simple or elementary substance. I shall not here pretend to give the  history of this recent, and hitherto contested discovery, which is  detailed in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1781, but shall only bring  forwards the principal proofs of the decomposition and composition of  water; and, I may venture to say, that these will be convincing to such  as consider them impartially.      _Experiment First._    Having fixed the glass tube EF, (Pl. vii. fig. 11.) of from 8 to 12  lines diameter, across a furnace, with a small inclination from E to F,  lute the superior extremity E to the glass retort A, containing a  determinate quantity of distilled water, and to the inferior extremity  F, the worm SS fixed into the neck of the doubly tubulated bottle H,  which has the bent tube KK adapted to one of its openings, in such a  manner as to convey such aeriform fluids or gasses as may be disengaged,  during the experiment, into a proper apparatus for determining their  quantity and nature.    To render the success of this experiment certain, it is necessary that  the tube EF be made of well annealed and difficultly fusible glass, and  that it be coated with a lute composed of clay mixed with powdered  stone-ware; besides which, it must be supported about its middle by  means of an iron bar passed through the furnace, lest it should soften  and bend during the experiment. A tube of China-ware, or porcellain,  would answer better than one of glass for this experiment, were it not  difficult to procure one so entirely free from pores as to prevent the  passage of air or of vapours.    When things are thus arranged, a fire is lighted in the furnace EFCD,  which is supported of such a strength as to keep the tube EF red hot,  but not to make it melt; and, at the same time, such a fire is kept up  in the furnace VVXX, as to keep the water in the retort A continually  boiling.    In proportion as the water in the retort A is evaporated, it fills the  tube EF, and drives out the air it contained by the tube KK; the aqueous  gas formed by evaporation is condensed by cooling in the worm SS, and  falls, drop by drop, into the tubulated bottle H. Having continued this  operation until all the water be evaporated from the retort, and having  carefully emptied all the vessels employed, we find that a quantity of  water has passed over into the bottle H, exactly equal to what was  before contained in the retort A, without any disengagement of gas  whatsoever: So that this experiment turns out to be a simple  distillation; and the result would have been exactly the same, if the  water had been run from one vessel into the other, through the tube EF,  without having undergone the intermediate incandescence.      _Experiment Second._    The apparatus being disposed, as in the former experiment, 28 grs. of  charcoal, broken into moderately small parts, and which has previously  been exposed for a long time to a red heat in close vessels, are  introduced into the tube EF. Every thing else is managed as in the  preceding experiment.    The water contained in the retort A is distilled, as in the former  experiment, and, being condensed in the worm, falls into the bottle H;  but, at the same time, a considerable quantity of gas is disengaged,  which, escaping by the tube KK, is received in a convenient apparatus  for that purpose. After the operation is finished, we find nothing but a  few atoms of ashes remaining in the tube EF; the 28 grs. of charcoal  having entirely disappeared.    When the disengaged gasses are carefully examined, they are sound to  weigh 113.7 grs.[16]; these are of two kinds, viz. 144 cubical inches  of carbonic acid gas, weighing 100 grs. and 380 cubical inches of a  very light gas, weighing only 13.7 grs. which takes fire when in  contact with air, by the approach of a lighted body; and, when the water  which has passed over into the bottle H is carefully examined, it is  found to have lost 85.7 grs. of its weight. Thus, in this experiment,  85.7 grs. of water, joined to 28 grs. of charcoal, have combined in  such a way as to form 100 grs. of carbonic acid, and 13.7 grs. of a  particular gas capable of being burnt.    I have already shown, that 100 grs. of carbonic acid gas consists of  72 grs. of oxygen, combined with 28 grs. of charcoal; hence the 28  grs. of charcoal placed in the glass tube have acquired 72 grs. of  oxygen from the water; and it follows, that 85.7 grs. of water are  composed of 72 grs. of oxygen, combined with 13.7 grs. of a gas  susceptible of combustion. We shall see presently that this gas cannot  possibly have been disengaged from the charcoal, and must, consequently,  have been produced from the water.    I have suppressed some circumstances in the above account of this  experiment, which would only have complicated and obscured its results  in the minds of the reader. For instance, the inflammable gas dissolves  a very small part of the charcoal, by which means its weight is somewhat  augmented, and that of the carbonic gas proportionally diminished.  Altho' the alteration produced by this circumstance is very  inconsiderable; yet I have thought it necessary to determine its effects  by rigid calculation, and to report, as above, the results of the  experiment in its simplified state, as if this circumstance had not  happened. At any rate, should any doubts remain respecting the  consequences I have drawn from this experiment, they will be fully  dissipated by the following experiments, which I am going to adduce in  support of my opinion.      _Experiment Third._    The apparatus being disposed exactly as in the former experiment, with  this difference, that instead of the 28 grs. of charcoal, the tube EF  is filled with 274 grs. of soft iron in thin plates, rolled up  spirally. The tube is made red hot by means of its furnace, and the  water in the retort A is kept constantly boiling till it be all  evaporated, and has passed through the tube EF, so as to be condensed in  the bottle H.    No carbonic acid gas is disengaged in this experiment, instead of which  we obtain 416 cubical inches, or 15 grs. of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/308"],[0,"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog) (#17)"],[1,", they had been towing the wrong boat.  George fancied that, if it had not been for the restraining influence of  the sweet woman at his side, the young man might have given way to  violent language.    The maiden was the first to recover from her surprise, and, when she did,  she clasped her hands, and said, wildly:    \"Oh, Henry, then _where_ is auntie?\"    \"Did they ever recover the old lady?\" asked Harris.    George replied he did not know.    Another example of the dangerous want of sympathy between tower and towed  was witnessed by George and myself once up near Walton.  It was where the  tow-path shelves gently down into the water, and we were camping on the  opposite bank, noticing things in general.  By-and-by a small boat came  in sight, towed through the water at a tremendous pace by a powerful  barge horse, on which sat a very small boy.  Scattered about the boat, in  dreamy and reposeful attitudes, lay five fellows, the man who was  steering having a particularly restful appearance.    \"I should like to see him pull the wrong line,\" murmured George, as they  passed.  And at that precise moment the man did it, and the boat rushed  up the bank with a noise like the ripping up of forty thousand linen  sheets.  Two men, a hamper, and three oars immediately left the boat on  the larboard side, and reclined on the bank, and one and a half moments  afterwards, two other men disembarked from the starboard, and sat down  among boat-hooks and sails and carpet-bags and bottles.  The last man  went on twenty yards further, and then got out on his head.    This seemed to sort of lighten the boat, and it went on much easier, the  small boy shouting at the top of his voice, and urging his steed into a  gallop.  The fellows sat up and stared at one another.  It was some  seconds before they realised what had happened to them, but, when they  did, they began to shout lustily for the boy to stop.  He, however, was  too much occupied with the horse to hear them, and we watched them,  flying after him, until the distance hid them from view.    I cannot say I was sorry at their mishap.  Indeed, I only wish that all  the young fools who have their boats towed in this fashion--and plenty  do--could meet with similar misfortunes.  Besides the risk they run  themselves, they become a danger and an annoyance to every other boat  they pass.  Going at the pace they do, it is impossible for them to get  out of anybody else's way, or for anybody else to get out of theirs.  Their line gets hitched across your mast, and overturns you, or it  catches somebody in the boat, and either throws them into the water, or  cuts their face open.  The best plan is to stand your ground, and be  prepared to keep them off with the butt-end of a mast.    Of all experiences in connection with towing, the most exciting is being  towed by girls.  It is a sensation that nobody ought to miss.  It takes  three girls to tow always; two hold the rope, and the other one runs  round and round, and giggles.  They generally begin by getting themselves  tied up.  They get the line round their legs, and have to sit down on the  path and undo each other, and then they twist it round their necks, and  are nearly strangled.  They fix it straight, however, at last, and start  off at a run, pulling the boat along at quite a dangerous pace.  At the  end of a hundred yards they are naturally breathless, and suddenly stop,  and all sit down on the grass and laugh, and your boat drifts out to  mid-stream and turns round, before you know what has happened, or can get  hold of a scull.  Then they stand up, and are surprised.    \"Oh, look!\" they say; \"he's gone right out into the middle.\"    [Picture: Lady pinning up frock] They pull on pretty steadily for a bit,  after this, and then it all at once occurs to one of them that she will  pin up her frock, and they ease up for the purpose, and the boat runs  aground.    You jump up, and push it off, and you shout to them not to stop.    \"Yes.  What's the matter?\" they shout back.    \"Don't stop,\" you roar.    \"Don't what?\"    \"Don't stop--go on--go on!\"    \"Go back, Emily, and see what it is they want,\" says one; and Emily comes  back, and asks what it is.    \"What do you want?\" she says; \"anything happened?\"    \"No,\" you reply, \"it's all right; only go on, you know--don't stop.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"Why, we can't steer, if you keep stopping.  You must keep some way on  the boat.\"    \"Keep some what?\"    \"Some way--you must keep the boat moving.\"    \"Oh, all right, I'll tell 'em.  Are we doing it all right?\"    \"Oh, yes, very nicely, indeed, only don't stop.\"    \"It doesn't seem difficult at all.  I thought it was so hard.\"    \"Oh, no, it's simple enough.  You want to keep on steady at it, that's  all.\"    \"I see.  Give me out my red shawl, it's under the cushion.\"    You find the shawl, and hand it out, and by this time another one has  come back and thinks she will have hers too, and they take Mary's on  chance, and Mary does not want it, so they bring it back and have a  pocket-comb instead.  It is about twenty minutes before they get off  again, and, at the next corner, they see a cow, and you have to leave the  boat to chivy the cow out of their way.    There is never a dull moment in the boat while girls are towing it.    George got the line right after a while, and towed us steadily on to  Penton Hook.  There we discussed the important question of camping.  We  had decided to sleep on board that night, and we had either to lay up  just about there, or go on past Staines.  It seemed early to think about  shutting up then, however, with the sun still in the heavens, and we  settled to push straight on for Runnymead, three and a half miles  further, a quiet wooded part of the river, and where there is good  shelter.    We all wished, however, afterward that we had stopped at Penton Hook.  Three or four miles up stream is a trifle, early in the morning, but it  is a weary pull at the end of a long day.  You take no interest in the  scenery during these last few miles.  You do not chat and laugh.  Every  half-mile you cover seems like two.  You can hardly believe you are only  where you are, and you are convinced that the map must be wrong; and,  when you have trudged along for what seems to you at least ten miles, and  still the lock is not in sight, you begin to seriously fear that somebody  must have sneaked it, and run off with it.    I remember being terribly upset once up the river (in a figurative sense,  I mean).  I was out with a young lady--cousin on my mother's side--and we  were pulling down to Goring.  It was rather late, and we were anxious to  get in--at least _she_ was anxious to get in.  It was half-past six when  we reached Benson's lock, and dusk was drawing on, and she began to get  excited then.  She said she must be in to supper.  I said it was a thing  I felt I wanted to be in at, too; and I drew out a map I had with me to  see exactly how far it was.  I saw it was just a mile and a half to the  next lock--Wallingford--and five on from there to Cleeve.    \"Oh, it's all right!\" I said.  \"We'll be through the next lock before  seven, and then there is only one more;\" and I settled down and pulled  steadily away.    We passed the bridge, and soon after that I asked if she saw the lock.  She said no, she did not see any lock; and I said, \"Oh!\" and pulled on.  Another five minutes went by, and then I asked her to look again.    \"No,\" she said; \"I can't see any signs of a lock.\"    \"You--you are sure you know a lock, when you do see one?\" I asked  hesitatingly, not wishing to offend her.    The question did offend her, however, and she suggested that I had better  look for myself; so I laid down the sculls, and took a view.  The river  stretched out straight before us in the twilight for about a mile; not a  ghost of a lock was to be seen.    \"You don't think we have lost our way, do you?\" asked my companion.    I did not see how that was possible; though, as I suggested, we might  have somehow got into the weir stream, and be making for the falls.    This idea did not comfort her in the least, and she began to cry.  She  said we should both be drowned, and that it was a judgment on her for  coming out with me.    It seemed an excessive punishment, I thought; but my cousin thought not,  and hoped it would all soon be over.    I tried to reassure her, and to make light of the whole affair.  I said  that the fact evidently was that I was not rowing as fast as I fancied I  was, but that we should soon reach the lock now; and I pulled on for  another mile.    Then I began to get nervous myself.  I looked again at the map.  There  was Wallingford lock, clearly marked, a mile and a half below Benson's.  It was a good, reliable map; and, besides, I recollected the lock myself.  I had been through it twice.  Where were we?  What had happened to us?  I  began to think it must be all a dream, and that I was really asleep in  bed, and should wake up in a minute, and be told it was past ten.    I asked my cousin if she thought it could be a dream, and she replied  that she was just about to ask me the same question; and then we both  wondered if we were both asleep, and if so, who was the real one that was  dreaming, and who was the one that was only a dream; it got quite  interesting.    I still went on pulling, however, and still no lock came in sight, and  the river grew more and more gloomy and mysterious under the gathering  shadows of night, and things seemed to be getting weird and uncanny.  I  thought of hobgoblins and banshees, and will-o'-the-wisps, and those  wicked girls who sit up all night on rocks, and lure people into  whirl-pools and things; and I wished I had been a better man, and knew  more hymns; and in the middle of these reflections I heard the blessed  strains of \"He's got 'em on,\" played, badly, on a concertina, and knew  that we were saved.    I do not admire the tones of a concertina, as a"]]]
