Roadways      This entry gives the total length of the road network and includes  the length of the paved and unpaved portions.        S          School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)      School life expectancy (SLE) is the total number of years of  schooling (primary to tertiary) that a child can expect to receive,  assuming that the probability of his or her being enrolled in school  at any particular future age is equal to the current enrollment  ratio at that age. Caution must be maintained when utilizing this  indicator in international comparisons. For example, a year or grade  completed in one country is not necessarily the same in terms of  educational content or quality as a year or grade completed in  another country. SLE represents the expected number of years of  schooling that will be completed, including years spent repeating  one or more grades.        Sex ratio      This entry includes the number of males for each female in five age  groups - at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over,  and for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently  emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in  some countries. For instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian  countries are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and  infanticide due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect  future marriage patterns and fertility patterns. Eventually, it  could cause unrest among young adult males who are unable to find  partners.        Stock of broad money      This entry covers all of \"Narrow money,\" plus the total quantity of  time and savings deposits, credit union deposits, institutional  money market funds, short-term repurchase agreements between the  central bank and commercial deposit banks, and other large liquid  assets held by nonbank financial institutions, state and local  governments, nonfinancial public enterprises, and the private sector  of the economy. National currency units have been converted to US  dollars at the closing exchange rate for the date of the  information. Because of exchange rate movements, changes in money  stocks measured in national currency units may vary significantly  from those shown in US dollars, and caution is urged when making  comparisons over time in US dollars. In addition to serving as a  medium of exchange, broad money includes assets that are slightly  less liquid than narrow money and the assets tend to function as a  \"store of value\" - a means of holding wealth.        Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad      This entry gives the cumulative US dollar value of all investments  in foreign countries made directly by residents - primarily  companies - of the home country, as of the end of the time period  indicated. Direct investment excludes investment through purchase of  shares.        Stock of direct foreign investment - at home      This entry gives the cumulative US dollar value of all investments  in the home country made directly by residents - primarily companies  - of other countries as of the end of the time period indicated.  Direct investment excludes investment through purchase of shares.        Stock of domestic credit      This entry is the total quantity of credit, denominated in the  domestic currency, provided by financial institutions to the central  bank, state and local governments, public non-financial  corporations, and the private sector. The national currency units  have been converted to US dollars at the closing exchange rate on  the date of the information.        Stock of narrow money      This entry, also know as \"M1,\" comprises the total quantity of  currency in circulation (notes and coins) plus demand deposits  denominated in the national currency held by nonbank financial  institutions, state and local governments, nonfinancial public  enterprises, and the private sector of the economy, measured at a  specific point in time. National currency units have been converted  to US dollars at the closing exchange rate for the date of the  information. Because of exchange rate movements, changes in money  stocks measured in national currency units may vary significantly  from those shown in US dollars, and caution is urged when making  comparisons over time in US dollars. Narrow money consists of more  liquid assets than broad money and the assets generally function as  a \"medium of exchange\" for an economy.        Suffrage      This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the right to  vote is universal or restricted.        T      Telephone numbers      All telephone numbers in The World Factbook consist of the country  code in brackets, the city or area code (where required) in  parentheses, and the local number. The one component that is not  presented is the international access code, which varies from  country to country. For example, an international direct dial  telephone call placed from the US to Madrid, Spain, would be as  follows: 011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx, where 011 is the international  access code for station-to-station calls; 01 is for calls other than  station-to-station calls, [34] is the country code for Spain, (1) is  the city code for Madrid, 577 is the local exchange, and xxxx is the  local telephone number. An international direct dial telephone call  placed from another country to the US would be as follows:  international access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx, where [ 1] is the  country code for the US, (202) is the area code for Washington, DC,  939 is the local exchange, and xxxx is the local telephone number.
