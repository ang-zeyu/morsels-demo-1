The one is a compact, organized, single-minded  body; the other is scattered, loosely put together, swayed to and fro  by every change in the political atmosphere, and can offer no  resistance that is sufficient to oppose the steady, unremittent  attacks of its enemy. The two, therefore, must not be placed in  collision. The very indifference manifested towards the national  religion by the great bulk of the French people is the cause why so  much danger is to be apprehended from the efforts of the church.  Because a religion is dead, says M. Quinet, there is the danger. A  living religion, like that of the puritans, may certainly mould the  government into a despotic form, but it communicates to it, at least,  a portion of its own power and energy, whilst a dead religion  infallibly occasions death to the state and to the people with which  it is politically and organically united. He argues the whole subject  with eloquent force, and with not a little of the earnestness which  reminds the reader of his personal controversies with the Roman  Catholic Church.           *       *       *       *       *    A history of _Marie Stuart_, by I. M. Dargaud, has just been published  in Paris, and for its brilliancy, completeness, clearness, and  impartiality, attracts much attention. Queen Mary of Scotland was one  of the famously beautiful women whose history is romance. She must be  named with the heroines of history and the figures of poetry, with  Helen, and Aspasia, and Cleopatra. Certainly, we trace no more  sparkling and sorrowful career than hers upon the confused page of  history, and our admiration, condemnation, surprise, sorrow and  delight, fall, summed in a tear, upon her grave. In this work it  appears that she was undoubtedly privy to the death of Darnley. During  his assassination, she was dancing at Holyrood. The fearful  fascination of a brigand like Bothwell, for so proud and passionate a  nature as Mary's, is well explained by M. Dargaud. He is just, also,  to her own tragedy, the long and bitter suffering, the betrayal of  friends; the final despair, and the laying aside two crowns to mount  the scaffold. She died nobly, and as most of the illustrious victims  of history have died; as if nature, unwilling that they should live,  would yet compassionately show the world in their ending, that heroism  and nobility were not altogether unknown to them.    _Apropos_ of this history of Queen Mary, Lamartine has written a  letter to Beranger, which praises the work exceedingly, but much more  glorifies himself. The letter is a perfect specimen of that vanity,  wherein only Lamartine is sublime: \"Ah! if you or I had had such a  heroine at twenty years, what epic poems and what songs would have  been the result!\"           *       *       *       *       *    THE COUNT MONTALEMBERT, the fervid champion of Catholicism in the  French chamber, has just published a work, entitled _The higher and  lower Radicalism: in its enmity to Religion, Right, Freedom and  Justice, in France, Switzerland and Italy_.           *       *       *       *       *    Although M. GUIZOT appears to be as busily engaged as ever in  politics, the advertisements of the booksellers would induce a belief  that his whole attention is given to literary studies. He has just  published _Etudes Biographiques sur la Revolution de l'Angleterre_,  which, with his sketch of General Monk, he says, \"form a sort of  gallery of portraits of the English Revolution, in which personages of  the most different characters appear together--chiefs or champions of  sects or parties, parliamentarians, cavaliers, republicans, levellers,  who, either at the end of the political conflicts in which they were  engaged, or when in retirement towards the close of their lives,  resolved to describe themselves, their own times, and the part they  played therein. In the drawing together of such men,\" he adds, \"and in  the mixture of truth and vanity which characterize such works, there  is, if I do not deceive myself, sufficient to interest persons of  serious and curious minds, especially among us and in these times; for  in spite of the profound diversity of manners, contemporary  comparisons and applications will present themselves at every step,  whatever may be the pains taken not to seek them.\" The studies here  collected we suppose are not new; they are doubtless the articles  which the author contributed to the _Biographie Universelle_ and other  works before he became a minister--perhaps, as in the cases of his  \"Monk\" and \"Washington,\" with scarcely a word of alteration. The work  is, however, interesting. The period of English history to which it  refers has been profoundly studied by Guizot, and it would probably be  impossible to select a mode of treating it that would admit of more  effective or attractive delineation. The life of Ludlow appears as the  first of the series.           *       *       *       *       *    French Literature tends in a remarkable degree towards monarchical  institutions. Guizot and his associates publicly advocate the  Restoration. M. Cousin has published a new argument against  Republicanism, and M. Romieu, whose curious book, which men doubted  whether to receive as a jest or an earnest argument, _The Era of the  Caesars_--in which he declared his belief that the true and only law  for France is _force_--is before the public again, in a volume  entitled _Le Spectre Rouge de 1852_. He predicts the subversion of all  order, and such terrible scenes as have never been witnessed even in  France, unless some one bold, resolute, scorning all \"constitutional\"  figments, and relying solely on his soldiers--some one who shall say  _L'etat c'est moi!_ shall save France. A Cromwell, a Francia, or in  default of such Louis Napoleon--any one who will constitute himself an  autocrat, will become the saviour of France!           *       *       *       *       *    The COUNT DE JARNAC, formerly secretary and _charge d'affaires_ of the  French embassy in London, has published a novel which is well spoken  of, entitled the _Dernier d'Egmont_.           *       *       *       *       *    A French traveller in upper Egypt has collected for the Parisian  Ethnological Museum copies of many curious inscriptions upon the walls  of the great temple of Philae. Among others, there is the modern one of  Dessaix, which the Parisians think \"reflects the grandiose simplicity  of the Republic.\" \"The sixth year of the Republic, the thirteenth  Messidor, a French army commanded by Bonaparte descended upon  Alexandria; twenty days after, the army having routed the Mamelukes at  the Pyramids, Dessaix, commanding the first division, pursued them  beyond the Cataracts, where he arrived the thirteenth Ventose of the  year seven, with Brigadier-Generals Davoust, Friant, and Belliard.  Donzelot, chief of the staff, La Tournerie, commanding the artillery,  Eppler, Chief of the twenty-first Light Infantry. The thirteenth  Ventose, year seven of the Republic, third March, year of J.C., 1799.  Engraved by Casteix.\" The last date, however, strikes us as a base  compromise to the _temporal_ prejudices of the world, on the part of  the author of this \"simple and grandiose\" inscription.           *       *       *       *       *    M. de Saint Beauve has published in Paris some hitherto inedited MSS.  of MIRABEAU, consisting of _Dialogues_ between the great orator and  the celebrated Sophie (Madame de Monnier), written when Mirabeau was  confined in the fortress of Vincennes, principally, it seems, from the  pleasure he had in reflecting on the object of his passion. He gives  an account of their first meeting, the growth of their love, and their  subsequent adventures, in the language, no doubt, as well as he could  recollect, that had passed between them, in conversation or in  letters. There is not much that is absolutely new in these papers, or  that throws any peculiar light on Mirabeau's character, but nothing  could have been written by him which is without a certain interest,  especially upon the subject of these _Dialogues_. Circulating-library  people had always a morbid desire to see illustrious personages while  under the influence of the tender passion.           *       *       *       *       *    _Progression Constante de la Democratie pendant soixante ans_, is the  title of a new Parisian brochure well noticed. Of the same character  is the _Le Mont-Saint-Michel_, by Martin Bernard, a serial publication  devoted to the details of the sufferings of Democratic martyrs. The  author is now in exile, having shown himself too republican for the  present Republic.           *       *       *       *       *    Victor Hugo's paper, _L'Evenement_, says of Louis Philippe's Gallery  at the Palais Royal, which the heirs now wish to sell, that it has two  paintings of Gericault's, the Chasseur and the Cuirassier, and that  they symbolize the two phases of the Empire, victorious France and the  Invasion. He hopes, therefore, that they will not be permitted to go  out of France.           *       *       *       *       *    William Howitt is writing a life of George Fox.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Ticknor's _History of Spanish Literature_ is reviewed in _La Revue  des Deux Mondes_ by PROSPER MERIMEE, of whose recent travels in the  United States we have had occasion to speak once or twice in _The  International_. M. Merimee is the author of a _Life of Peter the  Cruel_, of which a translation has been published within a few months  by Bentley in London, and he professes to be thoroughly acquainted  with Spanish literature, from a loving study of it while residing in  Spain. Perhaps he had some thought of writing its history himself; he  certainly seems to bestow unwillingly the praises he is compelled to  give Mr. Ticknor, whose extraordinary merits he however distinctly  admits. \"The writer of this History,\" he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3623"],[0,"The Golden Bough: A Study of Magic and Religion (#17)"],[1,"of that philosopher.        4. The Magician's Progress    WE have now concluded our examination of the general principles of  sympathetic magic. The examples by which I have illustrated them  have been drawn for the most part from what may be called private  magic, that is from magical rites and incantations practised for the  benefit or the injury of individuals. But in savage society there is  commonly to be found in addition what we may call public magic, that  is, sorcery practised for the benefit of the whole community.  Wherever ceremonies of this sort are observed for the common good,  it is obvious that the magician ceases to be merely a private  practitioner and becomes to some extent a public functionary. The  development of such a class of functionaries is of great importance  for the political as well as the religious evolution of society. For  when the welfare of the tribe is supposed to depend on the  performance of these magical rites, the magician rises into a  position of much influence and repute, and may readily acquire the  rank and authority of a chief or king. The profession accordingly  draws into its ranks some of the ablest and most ambitious men of  the tribe, because it holds out to them a prospect of honour,  wealth, and power such as hardly any other career could offer. The  acuter minds perceive how easy it is to dupe their weaker brother  and to play on his superstition for their own advantage. Not that  the sorcerer is always a knave and impostor; he is often sincerely  convinced that he really possesses those wonderful powers which the  credulity of his fellows ascribes to him. But the more sagacious he  is, the more likely he is to see through the fallacies which impose  on duller wits. Thus the ablest members of the profession must tend  to be more or less conscious deceivers; and it is just these men who  in virtue of their superior ability will generally come to the top  and win for themselves positions of the highest dignity and the most  commanding authority. The pitfalls which beset the path of the  professional sorcerer are many, and as a rule only the man of  coolest head and sharpest wit will be able to steer his way through  them safely. For it must always be remembered that every single  profession and claim put forward by the magician as such is false;  not one of them can be maintained without deception, conscious or  unconscious. Accordingly the sorcerer who sincerely believes in his  own extravagant pretensions is in far greater peril and is much more  likely to be cut short in his career than the deliberate impostor.  The honest wizard always expects that his charms and incantations  will produce their supposed effect; and when they fail, not only  really, as they always do, but conspicuously and disastrously, as  they often do, he is taken aback: he is not, like his knavish  colleague, ready with a plausible excuse to account for the failure,  and before he can find one he may be knocked on the head by his  disappointed and angry employers.    The general result is that at this stage of social evolution the  supreme power tends to fall into the hands of men of the keenest  intelligence and the most unscrupulous character. If we could  balance the harm they do by their knavery against the benefits they  confer by their superior sagacity, it might well be found that the  good greatly outweighed the evil. For more mischief has probably  been wrought in the world by honest fools in high places than by  intelligent rascals. Once your shrewd rogue has attained the height  of his ambition, and has no longer any selfish end to further, he  may, and often does, turn his talents, his experience, his  resources, to the service of the public. Many men who have been  least scrupulous in the acquisition of power have been most  beneficent in the use of it, whether the power they aimed at and won  was that of wealth, political authority, or what not. In the field  of politics the wily intriguer, the ruthless victor, may end by  being a wise and magnanimous ruler, blessed in his lifetime,  lamented at his death, admired and applauded by posterity. Such men,  to take two of the most conspicuous instances, were Julius Caesar  and Augustus. But once a fool always a fool, and the greater the  power in his hands the more disastrous is likely to be the use he  makes of it. The heaviest calamity in English history, the breach  with America, might never have occurred if George the Third had not  been an honest dullard.    Thus, so far as the public profession of magic affected the  constitution of savage society, it tended to place the control of  affairs in the hands of the ablest man: it shifted the balance of  power from the many to the one: it substituted a monarchy for a  democracy, or rather for an oligarchy of old men; for in general the  savage community is ruled, not by the whole body of adult males, but  by a council of elders. The change, by whatever causes produced, and  whatever the character of the early rulers, was on the whole very  beneficial. For the rise of monarchy appears to be an essential  condition of the emergence of mankind from savagery. No human being  is so hide-bound by custom and tradition as your democratic savage;  in no state of society consequently is progress so slow and  difficult. The old notion that the savage is the freest of mankind  is the reverse of the truth. He is a slave, not indeed to a visible  master, but to the past, to the spirits of his dead forefathers, who  haunt his steps from birth to death, and rule him with a rod of  iron. What they did is the pattern of right, the unwritten law to  which he yields a blind unquestioning obedience. The least possible  scope is thus afforded to superior talent to change old customs for  the better. The ablest man is dragged down by the weakest and  dullest, who necessarily sets the standard, since he cannot rise,  while the other can fall. The surface of such a society presents a  uniform dead level, so far as it is humanly possible to reduce the  natural inequalities, the immeasurable real differences of inborn  capacity and temper, to a false superficial appearance of equality.  From this low and stagnant condition of affairs, which demagogues  and dreamers in later times have lauded as the ideal state, the  Golden Age, of humanity, everything that helps to raise society by  opening a career to talent and proportioning the degrees of  authority to men's natural abilities, deserves to be welcomed by all  who have the real good of their fellows at heart. Once these  elevating influences have begun to operate--and they cannot be for  ever suppressed--the progress of civilisation becomes comparatively  rapid. The rise of one man to supreme power enables him to carry  through changes in a single lifetime which previously many  generations might not have sufficed to effect; and if, as will often  happen, he is a man of intellect and energy above the common, he  will readily avail himself of the opportunity. Even the whims and  caprices of a tyrant may be of service in breaking the chain of  custom which lies so heavy on the savage. And as soon as the tribe  ceases to be swayed by the timid and divided counsels of the elders,  and yields to the direction of a single strong and resolute mind, it  becomes formidable to its neighbours and enters on a career of  aggrandisement, which at an early stage of history is often highly  favourable to social, industrial, and intellectual progress. For  extending its sway, partly by force of arms, partly by the voluntary  submission of weaker tribes, the community soon acquires wealth and  slaves, both of which, by relieving some classes from the perpetual  struggle for a bare subsistence, afford them an opportunity of  devoting themselves to that disinterested pursuit of knowledge which  is the noblest and most powerful instrument to ameliorate the lot of  man.    Intellectual progress, which reveals itself in the growth of art and  science and the spread of more liberal views, cannot be dissociated  from industrial or economic progress, and that in its turn receives  an immense impulse from conquest and empire. It is no mere accident  that the most vehement outbursts of activity of the human mind have  followed close on the heels of victory, and that the great  conquering races of the world have commonly done most to advance and  spread civilisation, thus healing in peace the wounds they inflicted  in war. The Babylonians, the Greeks, the Romans, the Arabs are our  witnesses in the past: we may yet live to see a similar outburst in  Japan. Nor, to remount the stream of history to its sources, is it  an accident that all the first great strides towards civilisation  have been made under despotic and theocratic governments, like those  of Egypt, Babylon, and Peru, where the supreme ruler claimed and  received the servile allegiance of his subjects in the double  character of a king and a god. It is hardly too much to say that at  this early epoch despotism is the best friend of humanity and,  paradoxical as it may sound, of liberty. For after all there is more  liberty in the best sense--liberty to think our own thoughts and to  fashion our own destinies--under the most absolute despotism, the  most grinding tyranny, than under the apparent freedom of savage  life, where the individual's lot is cast from the cradle to the  grave in the iron mould of hereditary custom.    So far, therefore, as the public profession of magic has been one of  the roads by which the ablest men have passed to supreme power, it  has contributed to emancipate mankind from the thraldom of tradition  and to elevate them into a larger, freer life, with a broader  outlook on the world. This is no small service rendered to humanity.  And when we remember further that in another direction magic has  paved the way for science, we are forced to admit that if the black  art has done much evil,"]]]
