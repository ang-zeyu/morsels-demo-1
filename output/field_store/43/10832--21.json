BY ISAAC M'LELLAN.      A century ago, the deep shadows of the untrimmed wilderness overspread  the broad valleys and wild hills of western New-York. The sound of the  squatter's axe had not then aroused the echoes of those remote  solitudes; nor the smoke of the frontiersman's cabin curled above the  tall branching oaks and the solemn hemlocks of the primeval forest. The  ploughshare had not then turned the fertile glebe, nor the cattle  browsed upon the tender herbage of that region, now so populous and  cultivated. The red stag there shook his branching antlers, and bounded  fearlessly through the open glades of the wood, or led the dappled doe  or fawn, at rosy dawn, or mellow eventide, to drink at the ice-cold  water-course, or the pellucid surface of the lake. The shaggy bear  prowled in the briery thicket, or fed on the acorns that autumn shook  down from the oak; and the tawny panther ranged unmolested in the rocky  fastnesses of the hills, or lay in the leafy covert for its prey. The  Indian hunter was then lord of the land. The Mohawk and the Oneida held  the region from the waters of the Hudson to the shores where Erie and  Ontario rolled upon the beach; and the smoke of the wigwam ascended by  many a quiet stream and wood. The hunter's rifle echoed among the hills,  and his arrow whistled in the glade--the war-dance and battle-song  resounded in every valley; and the sharp canoe, urged by the flashing  paddle, skimmed every stream and lake.    Many years since, a small band of marksmen of the Mohawk tribe, having  wandered far from their hunting-ground, were ambushed by a war-party of  the Oneidas, and their chief, Owaka, was slain in the contest. Wauchee,  or the Red-Feather, the only son of the old chief, and now the head of  the nation of the Mohawks, had been deeply distressed at his father's  loss, and had sworn that he would take the scalp of an Oneida, before  the flowers of another spring should bloom over his father's grave.    In the leafy month of June, the young chief wandered afar from the  lovely valley of his native river in pursuit of a small hunting-party of  the Oneidas who were said to be prowling in the neighborhood. He had  followed for many days the trail of the fugitives, and had often come  upon their deserted camp-fires, but had not yet overtaken them. They  were on their return to their village, which was situated on the shores  of the Ontario, where the Niagara river, after its mighty plunge at the  Falls, empties into its frothy abyss. On a pleasant evening of  summer-time, he paused to encamp for the night in a place where a  transparent streamlet poured its crystal tribute into the bosom of the  Genessee. A dense and lofty grove of pines advanced their ranks to the  very edge of the stream, and afforded him a faithful shelter from the  dews and breezes of night.    The hunter soon enkindled a roaring fire from the decayed and fallen  branches of trees, and while his supper of venison broiled upon its  embers, he flung himself upon the turf, wearied with his march. The  Indian was a noble specimen of his race. His shapely limbs indicated the  presence of extraordinary strength and activity. He was clad in a  buckskin hunting-frock, handsomely ornamented with quills and feathers.  His deer-skin leggins were fringed with the red-stained hair of some  wild animal, and his neat moccasons were adorned in the extreme of  savage fashion. On his head was placed a bunch of eagle-feathers, which  fluttered gayly in the wind. A heavy rifle lay at his side, with its  ornamented pouch and horn. In his belt were thrust the fatal knife and  hatchet. A huge wolf-hound, the only companion of his expedition,  stretched its limbs before the blaze, watching with hungry eyes the  progress of the evening meal. But the night passed not away without  adventure. A thick darkness had now fallen upon the woods, and the ruddy  flames of the fire but partially illuminated the rough black shafts of  the pines, whose plumed branches sighed mournfully overhead. Suddenly  the hound sprang to his feet, with a fierce growl, at the same time  glaring upward into the thick recesses of a towering pine-tree. For a  moment the sharp eye of the hunter could discern no object of alarm; but  he soon heard the branches creak, as with the movements of some wild  creature. He presently heard a growl among the tree-tops, and discerned  two flaming globes of fire, which he knew to be the eyeballs of some  animal, illuminated by the flashes of his camp-fire. In an instant his  rifle was poised at his shoulder, and its glittering sight brought in  range with the shining objects of its alarm. For an instant the heavy  tube was held motionless at its aim, and then the sharp crack of the  weapon sounded on the air. Before the smoke of the discharge had  dissolved in the breeze, a dark object tumbled headlong among the  boughs, and at length plunged headlong in the midst of the flames,  scattering the flashing sparks in all directions. With a furious yell  the hound fastened upon the prey, and soon dragged forth from the flames  the lifeless body of an immense panther, from one of whose perforated  eyes the life-blood flowed in a copious stream. The Indian was greatly  elated at his successful shot, and after removing with his knife one of  its sharp claws as a trophy, and heaping fresh logs on the flames, he  spread out his blanket and resigned himself to slumber.    The morning sun had not drank up the dew-drops that sparkled like gems  on herb and foliage before the young hunter had again resumed his march.  He followed with unerring precision the trail of the fugitives through  thorny thicket and quaking morass, and ere the evening sun had dropped  behind the hills, he came upon the encampment of his foe. The party had  flung themselves upon the soft turf, beneath the drooping branches of a  grove of cedars, and were enjoying their evening pipe, while a huge side  of venison smoked upon the embers. The group consisted of tall and  stalwart warriors, whose brawny limbs seemed well able to triumph in any  act of savage barbarity they might be called upon to undertake. Some of  them wore frocks of buckskin, and leggins of bright-colored cloth,  ornamented with strings of wampum, tin trinkets and glass beads, that  jingled with every motion of the wearer. Some wore feathers from the  eagle's wing on their heads, as marks of rank. At the side of most of  them rested an ornamented gun, while pouches and horns were suspended  from the branches around. Each warrior was encircled with a belt of  hide, in which glittered the usual implements of the chase and war. Some  of the inferior ones carried only a stout ash bow, a sheaf of feathered  arrows, and a weighty club of bone, adorned with quills and colored  feathers.    The cunning Wauchee crept cautiously within a short distance of the  camp, trusting that during the drowsy hours of the night he should be  able to strike a blow; but to his chagrin he perceived that the party  was on the alert, and that two wakeful sentinels constantly kept watch,  while the others slept. On the following morning the party resumed their  march, still followed by their pursuer, who hoped to cut off some  straggler during the retreat; but no such victim fell in his way. In the  course of a day or two the roar of waters, and the ascending mist of the  cataract, warned them of their approach to the mighty falls of Niagara;  and soon the Oneida party had encamped among the gloomy pines and  hemlocks opposite the torrent.    Wauchee, though he had often heard among the dim traditions of his race,  of the existence of an awful torrent of water, that poured for ever with  a voice of thunder, among the remote woods of the wilderness, had never  yet gazed on this stupendous spectacle, and now, as he listened to its  earthquake voice with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31219"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#17)"],[1,"a will what give all of his niggers a little piece o' land.
