A woman, Leah, when she cried out in the fulness of  her joy: 'Now again will I praise the Lord.'\"    Under the influence of such ideal views, and in obedience to such  standards, Jewish woman led a modest, retired life of domestic activity,  the help-meet and solace of her husband, the joy of his age, the  treasure of his liberty, his comforter in sorrow. For, when the  portentous catastrophe overwhelmed the Jewish nation, when Jerusalem and  the Temple lay in ruins, when the noblest of the people were slain, and  the remnant of Israel was made to wander forth out of his land into a  hostile world, to fulfil his mission as a witness to the truth of  monotheism, then Jewish woman, too, was found ready to assume the  burdens imposed by distressful days.    Israel, broken up into unresisting fragments, began his two thousand  years' journey through the desert of time, despoiled of all possessions  except his Law and his family. Of these treasures Titus and his legions  could not rob him. From the ruins of the Jewish state blossomed forth  the spirit of Jewish life and law in vigorous renewal. Judaism rose  rejuvenated on the crumbling temples of Jupiter, immaculate in doctrine,  incorruptible in practice. Israel's spiritual guides realized that  adherence to the Law is the only safeguard against annihilation and  oblivion. From that time forth, the men became the guardians of the  _Law_, the women the guardians of the purity of _life_, both working  harmoniously for the preservation of Judaism.    The muse of history recorded no names of Jewish women from the  destruction of the Temple to the eleventh century. Yet the student  cannot fail to assign the remarkable preservation of the race to  woman's gentle, quiet, though paramount influence by the side of the  earnest tenacity of men. Among Jews leisure, among non-Jews knowledge,  was lacking to preserve names for the instruction of posterity. Before  Jews could record their suffering, the oppressor's hand again fell, its  grasp more relentless than ever. For many centuries blood and tears  constitute the chronicle of Jewish life, and at the sources of these  streams of blood and rivers of tears, the genius of Jewish history sits  lamenting.    Whenever the sun of tolerance broke through the clouds of oppression,  and for even a brief period shone upon the martyr race, its marvellous  development under persecution and in despite of unspeakable suffering at  once stood revealed. During these occasional breaks in the darkness,  women appeared whose erudition was so profound as to earn special  mention. As was said above, the first names of women distinguished for  beauty and intellect come down to us from the eleventh century, and even  then only Italy, Provence, Andalusia, and the Orient, were favored, Jews  in these countries living unmolested and in comparative freedom, and  zealously devoting their leisure to the study of the Talmud and secular  branches of learning. In praise of Italy it was said: \"Out of Bari goes  forth the Law, and the word of the Lord from Otranto.\" It is, therefore,  not surprising to read in Jewish sources of the maiden Paula, of the  family Dei Mansi (Anawim), the daughter of Abraham, and later the wife  of Yechiel dei Mansi, who, in 1288, copied her father's abstruse  Talmudic commentary, adding ingenious explanations, the result of  independent research. But one grows somewhat sceptical over the account,  by a Jewish tourist, Rabbi Petachya of Ratisbon, of Bath Halevi,  daughter of Rabbi Samuel ben Ali in Bagdad, equally well-read in the  Bible and the Talmud, and famous for her beauty. She lectured on the  Talmud to a large number of students, and, to prevent their falling in  love with her, she sat behind lattice-work or in a glass cabinet, that  she might be heard but not seen. The dry tourist-chronicler fails to  report whether her disciples approved of the preventive measure, and  whether in the end it turned out to have been effectual. At all events,  the example of the learned maiden found an imitator. Almost a century  later we meet with Miriam Shapiro, of Constance, a beautiful Jewish  girl, who likewise delivered public lectures on the Talmud sitting  behind a curtain, that the attention of her inquisitive pupils might not  be distracted by sight of her from their studies.    Of the learned El Muallima we are told that she transplanted Karaite  doctrines from the Orient to Castile, where she propagated them. The  daughter of the prince of poets, Yehuda Halevi, is accredited with a  soulful religious poem hitherto attributed to her father, and Rabbi  Joseph ibn Nagdela's wife was esteemed the most learned and  representative woman in Granada. Even in the choir of Arabic-Andalusian  poets we hear the voice of a Jewish songstress, Kasmune, the daughter  of the poet Ishmael. Only a few blossoms of her delicate poetry have  been preserved.[31] Catching sight of her young face in the mirror, she  called out:        \"A vine I see, and though 'tis time to glean,        No hand is yet stretched forth to cull the fruit.      Alas! my youth doth pass in sorrow keen,        A nameless 'him' my eyes in vain salute.\"    Her pet gazelle, raised by herself, she addresses thus:        \"In only thee, my timid, fleet gazelle,        Dark-eyed like thee, I see my counterpart;      We both live lone, without companion dwell,        Accepting fate's decree with patient heart.\"    Of other women we are told whose learning and piety inspired respect,  not only in Talmudic authorities, but, more than that, in their sisters  in faith. Especially in the family of Rashi (Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac),  immortal through his commentaries on the Bible and the Talmud, a number  of women distinguished themselves. His daughter Rachel (Bellejeune), on  one occasion when her father was sick, wrote out for Rabbi Abraham Cohen  of Mayence an opinion on religious questions in dispute. Rashi's two  granddaughters, Anna and Miriam, were equally famous. In questions  relating to the dietary laws, they were cited as authorities, and their  decisions accepted as final.    Zunz calls the wife of Rabbi Joseph ben Jochanan of Paris \"almost a  rabbi\"; and Dolce, wife of the learned Rabbi Eleazar of Worms, supported  her family with the work of her hands, was a thorough student of the  dietary laws, taught women on Jewish subjects, and on Sabbath delivered  public lectures. She wore the twofold crown of learning and martyrdom.  On December 6, 1213, fanatic crusaders rushed into the rabbi's house,  and most cruelly killed her and her two daughters, Bella and Anna.    Israel having again fallen on evil times, the rarity of women writers  during the next two centuries needs no explanation. In the sixteenth  century their names reappear on the records, not only as Talmudic  scholars, but also as writers of history in the German language. Litte  of Ratisbon composed a history of King David in the celebrated \"Book of  Samuel,\" a poem in the _Nibelungen_ stanza, and we are told that Rachel  Ackermann of Vienna was banished for having written a piquant novel,  \"Court Secrets.\"    These tentative efforts led the way to busy and widespread activity by  Jewish women in various branches of literature at a somewhat later  period, when the so-called _Judendeutsch_, also known as  _Altweiberdeutsch_ (old women's German), came into general use. Rebekah  Tiktiner, daughter of Rabbi Meir Tiktiner, attained to a reputation  considerable enough to suggest her scholarly work to J. G. Zeltner, a  Rostock professor, as the subject of an essay published in 1719. Her  book, _Meneketh Ribka_, deals with the duties of woman. Edel Mendels of  Cracow epitomized \"Yosippon\" (History of the Jews after Josephus); Bella  Chasan, who died a martyr's death, composed two instructive works on  Jewish history, in their time widely read; Glikel Hamel of Hamburg wrote  her memoirs, describing her contemporaries and the remarkable events of  her life; Hannah Ashkenasi was the author of addresses on moral  subjects; and Ella Goetz translated the Hebrew prayers into  Jewish-German.    Litte of Ratisbon found imitators. Rosa Fischels of Cracow was the first  to put the psalms into Jewish-German rhymes (1586). She turned the whole  psalter \"into simple German very prettily, modestly, and withal  pleasantly for women and maidens to read.\" The authoress acknowledges  that it was her aim to imitate the rhyme and melody of the \"Book of  Samuel\" by her famed predecessor. Occasionally her paraphrase rises to  the height of true poetry, as in the first and last verses of Psalm  xcvi:    \"Sing to God a new song, sing to God all the land, sing to God, praise  His name, show forth His ready help from day to day.... The field and  all thereon shall show great joy; they will sing with all their leaves,  the trees of the wood and the grove, before the Lord God who will come  to judge the earth far and near. He judgeth the earth with righteousness  and the nations with truth.\"    Rosa Fischels was followed by a succession of women writers: Taube Pan  in Prague, a poetess; Bella Hurwitz, who wrote a history of the House  of David, and, in association with Rachel Rausnitz, an account of the  settlement of Jews in Prague; and a number of scholarly women famous  among their co-religionists for knowledge of the Talmud, piety, and  broad, secular culture.    In a rapid review like this of woman's achievements on the field of  Jewish scholarship, the results recorded must appear meagre, owing  partly to the paucity of available data, partly to the nature of the  inquiry. Abstruse learning, pure science, original research, are by no  means woman's portion. Such occupations demand complete surrender on the  part of the student, uninterrupted attention to the subject pursued, and  delicately organized woman is not capable of such absorption. Woman's  perceptions are subtle, and she rests satisfied with her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27911"],[0,"The Giraffe Hunters (#17)"],[1," For, from their acquaintance with the country, they  knew of the cataract; and were confident that he must have been carried  over the falls; thence a shattered, inanimate mass rolling onward to  ocean.    When little more than a mile down stream, Groot Willem discharged his  gun.  The report echoed in afar along the banks.  Every one paused and  stood listening to hear if there should be any response.    It came.    Faintly and from afar they could distinguish the sounds of a human  voice.  Uttering a shout of joy, the three hunters rushed forward, and  soon after, when Hans shouted \"Hendrik,\" they heard from the river the  words, \"Here, this way.\"    A minute more, and they were standing within a few feet of the object of  their search, and had a full comprehension of what had hindered him from  returning to the succour of his companions.    As the Makololo had come out well provided with comestibles, the hungry  hunters were fed to their full satisfaction and then all went back to  the place where the elephant had breathed its last.  There forming their  camp, they kindled fires, and made ready to pass the night,--the  followers of Macora feasting upon one of their favourite dishes,--baked  elephant's foot.    Congo had still his tale to tell.  When deserted by the others in their  pursuit of the giraffes, he had waited two or three hours, expecting  them to return.  He then started off along their spoor, but being  hampered by caring for the pack-horse, he progressed but slowly.    Night overtook him by the body of the dead giraffe.  Unable through the  darkness to follow the trail any farther, he remained by the carcass  till morning.    By that time, the heavy rain had obliterated the spoor so completely  that even Spoor'em, the hound, could only follow it with great  difficulty.  After a time, Congo saw that the horse-tracks separated,  going in different directions.  He followed one set of them for some  time till the horse himself was found, but without saddle, bridle, or  rider.    This was Willem's horse, that had taken flight on the approach of the  elephants.    Congo had gone the wrong way for finding his master, and he now returned  upon the horse's tracks.  This, of course, brought him to the place  where the elephant had first charged; and, on reaching the bank of the  river and looking over, he saw the situation in which the hunters were  placed.  But the wounded elephant was there, and this, charging upon  him, hindered him from continuing the observation.  He had seen enough  to knew that he must go to the camp for assistance, and this was just  what he did.    They passed the night by the pool, pleasantly enough.  The joy of once  more being together would have deprived them of sleep, had it not been  for their extreme weariness.  But Hans and the chief, seeing the other  three so exhausted, did not insist on hearing the details of the  dangerous adventure; and at an early hour the camp was buried in the  silence of slumber.    Two horses had been lost.  This, under the circumstances, was a serious  misfortune; but their own lives had been miraculously preserved; and  none of them was now disposed to find fault with fortune for anything  that had occurred.    Next morning, they started back to the place where the giraffe-trap was  being constructed.  On reaching it, they found Swartboy impatiently  waiting for their return.  His expressions of joy at seeing them once  more safe and sound were accompanied with the declaration that they had  been more fortunate than he had expected, considering that they had gone  forth with only Congo for their guide.        CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.    MISTAKES OF A NIGHT.    As nearly two weeks would be required for constructing the hopo, Groot  Willem determined on making another hunting expedition.  There was  plenty of game in the immediate neighbourhood; but the chief strongly  protested against the firing of guns, lest the sounds should betray  their presence in the place.    Several giraffes had been seen in the mimosa groves, and the banks of  the river were marked with their spoor.    Macora objected to their being alarmed, as it would drive them away  before the pen could be got ready for them.    Groot Willem was a hunter, and out on a hunting expedition.  This being  the case, he could not remain for two weeks idle; and taking Hendrik and  Congo along with him, he left the camp to visit a river, which,  according to the chief's account, lay about thirty miles to the  north-west.  They expected to reach it in one day, and could have done  so, but for a large drove of elands, which was encountered upon the way,  and the pursuit of which delayed them.    They encamped that night, as they supposed, about five miles from the  river, and the next morning continued on, to reach it.  A ride of  between ten and fifteen miles was made, but no river was arrived at.    Early in the afternoon, they came upon a tiny rivulet running out of a  pool, or _vley_.  Supposing it to be a tributary of the river they were  in search of, they concluded that by following it down, they should  reach the main stream.  This, however, they were in no haste to do,  since the country around the pool appeared to be the best sort of  hunting-ground.  The fresh tracks of many varieties of animals could be  seen in the mud; and Willem proposed that they should stay over night  and lie in wait by the vley.    To this Hendrik agreed; and the horses were tethered out to graze.    A suitable place for a pit was chosen twenty paces from the pool, and,  in less than an hour, two excavations were made, in which the hunters  might conveniently conceal themselves.    Early in the evening, leaving Congo at some distance off, under the  protection of a large fire, they repaired to the pits, and there  commenced their silent vigil.    The first animals that made their appearance were antelopes of a small  species; and, as the hunters were not in want of food, no attempt was  made to hinder the little creatures from having their drink and  retiring.    Suddenly there was a commotion in the herd, which ended in a rush from  the pool.  A leopard had pounced on one of them, and, as the others left  the ground, the leopard was seen shouldering its victim with the  intention to carry it off.  As it turned side towards them, Willem  fired, and the large heavy bullet from the roer went crashing through  the creature's ribs.    With a loud roar it sprang upwards; then, standing on its hind feet, it  walked forward a few paces and fell.  The shot had been discharged at  random through the dim light, but a better could not have been made with  the most deliberate aim, and in the light of day.    After this, the pool was visited by hyenas, jackals, and various other  creatures not worth the powder that would be required in killing them.    Some time elapsed, during which the hunters had nothing else to interest  them than listening to the snarls, laughter, and growling of the  carrion-eaters assembled around the pool.    \"I can't say there's much sport in this,\" muttered Hendrik,  discontentedly.  \"I've hard work in keeping awake.\"    Another hour passed without their seeing any game worthy of their  attention, when Willem, too, became weary of inaction.    They were thinking of vacating the pits and joining Congo by the  camp-fire, when something heavier than hyenas was heard approaching the  spot.  With only their eyes above the surface of the ground, they gazed  eagerly in the direction from which proceeded the sound.  Two large  animals appeared through the darkness, evidently approaching the vley.    \"Quaggas!\" whispered Willem, as he strained his eyes to assure himself  of their species.    \"Yes,\" answered Hendrik.  \"Let us knock them over.  They're not much  good, but it will serve to wake us up.\"    Doubtful whether a shot at anything better might be had that night,  Groot Willem was nothing loath, and was the first to fire.  The animal  at which he had aimed fell forward, and they heard a heavy plunging, as  it rolled over into the pool.    Its companion was about turning to make off when Hendrik fired.  There  was no apparent interruption to its flight, and Hendrik was under the  impression that his shot had missed.  He was soon undeceived, however,  by hearing the animal fall to the earth with a dull heavy sound, at the  same time uttering a groan, which did not seem unfamiliar, and yet was  not the cry of a quagga.    Without saying a word, both leaped out of the pits, and hastened towards  the fallen animals, with a strong presentiment that there was something  amiss.    The animal brought down by Hendrik was first reached.    It was not a quagga, but a horse!    \"A horse!\" exclaimed Willem as he stooped over the carcass to examine  it.  \"It is not mine, thank God, nor yours neither.\"    \"That is rather a selfish remark of yours, Willem,\" said Hendrik.  \"The  horse belongs to some one.  I can see a saddle-mark on its back.\"    \"May be,\" muttered Willem, who thought nearly as much of his steed as  his great roer.  \"For all that I'm glad it isn't mine.\"    They then proceeded to the vley, where the other horse was still  struggling in the shallow water.  As it was evidently unable to get to  its feet, and wounded to the death, another shot was fired to release it  from its misery.    Wondering to whom the two horses could belong, they returned to the  camp-fire; both under the impression that they had destroyed enough of  animal life for that night.    Early the next morning they left the pool, and, continuing down stream,  within two hours reached the river they had been so long in search of.  Here they determined to stop until the next day, and their horses were  again tethered out; and, as they were somewhat wearied, they lay down to  take repose under the shade of a mokhala tree.  From this they were  startled by the loud barking of Spoor'em and the calls of Congo.    Springing to their"]]]
