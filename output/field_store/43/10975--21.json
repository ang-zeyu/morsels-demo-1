I'm taking no chances.\"    \"That's right, Master Tom. I'll keep steam up in the boiler to-night,  though we don't really need it, as your father told me you would  probably not run any machinery when he was gone. But with a good head  of steam up, and a hose handy, I can give any burglars a hot  reception. I almost wish they'd come, so I could get square with  them.\"    \"I don't, Garret. Well, I guess everything is in good shape. If you  hear anything unusual, or the alarm goes off during the night, call  me.\"    \"I will, Master Tom,\" and the old engineer, who had a living-room in  a shack adjoining the boiler-room, locked the door after Tom left.    The young inventor spent the early evening in attaching a new wire  to his motor-cycle to replace the one he had purchased while on his  disastrous trip. The temporary one was not just the proper thing,  though it answered well enough. Then, having done some work on a new  boat propeller he was contemplating patenting, Tom felt that it was  time to go to bed, as he was tired. He made a second round of the  house, looking to doors and windows, until Mrs. Baggert exclaimed:    \"Oh, Tom, do stop! You make me nervous, going around that way. I'm  sure I shan't sleep a wink to-night, thinking of burglars and  tramps.\"    Tom laughingly desisted, and went up to his room. He sat up a few  minutes, writing a letter to a girl of his acquaintance, for, in  spite of the fact that the young inventor was very busy with his own  and his father's work, he found time for lighter pleasures. Then, as  his eyes seemed determined to close of their own accord, if he did  not let them, he tumbled into bed.    Tom fancied it was nearly morning when he suddenly awoke with a  start. He heard a noise, and at first he could not locate it. Then  his trained ear traced it to the dining-room.    \"Why, Mrs. Baggert must be getting breakfast, and is rattling the  dishes,\" he thought. \"But why is she up so early?\"    It was quite dark in Tom's room, save for a little gleam from the  crescent moon, and by the light of this Tom arose and looked at his  watch.    \"Two o'clock,\" he whispered. \"That can't be Mrs. Baggert, unless  she's sick, and got up to take some medicine.\"    He listened intently. Below, in the dining-room, he could hear  stealthy movements.    \"Mrs. Baggert would never move around like that,\" he decided. \"She's  too heavy. I wonder--it's a burglar--one of the gang has gotten in!\"  he exclaimed in tense tones. \"I'm going to catch him at it!\"    Hurriedly he slipped on some clothes, and then, having softly turned  on the electric light in his room, he took from a corner a small  rifle, which he made sure was loaded. Then, having taken a small  electric flashlight, of the kind used by police men, and sometimes  by burglars, he started on tiptoe toward the lower floor.    As Tom softly descended the stairs he could more plainly hear the  movements of the intruder. He made out now that the burglar was in  Mr. Swift's study, which opened from the dining-room.    \"He's after dad's papers!\" thought Tom. \"I wonder which one this  is?\"    The youth had often gone hunting in the woods, and he knew how to  approach cautiously. Thus he was able to reach the door of the  dining-room without being detected. He had no need to flash his  light, for the intruder was doing that so frequently with one he  carried that Tom could see him perfectly. The fellow was working at  the safe in which Mr. Swift kept his more valuable papers.    Softly, very softly Tom brought his rifle to bear on the back of the  thief. Then, holding the weapon with one hand, for it was very  light, Tom extended the electric flash, so that the glare would be  thrown on the intruder and would leave his own person in the black  shadows. Pressing the spring which caused the lantern to throw out a  powerful glow, Tom focused the rays on the kneeling man.    \"That will be about all!\" the youth exclaimed in as steady a voice  as he could manage.    The burglar turned like a flash, and Tom had a glimpse of his face.  It was the tramp--Happy Harry--whom he had encountered on the lonely  road.          CHAPTER XIX.    TOM ON A HUNT      Tom held his rifle in readiness, though he only intended it as a  means of intimidation, and would not have fired at the burglar  except to save his own life. But the sight of the weapon was enough  for the tramp. He crouched motionless. His own light had gone out,  but by the gleam of the electric he carried Tom could see that the  man had in his hand some tool with which he had been endeavoring to  force the safe.    \"I guess you've got me!\" exclaimed the intruder, and there was in  his tones no trace of the tramp dialect.    \"It looks like it,\" agreed Tom grimly. \"Are you a tramp now, or in  some other disguise?\"    \"Can't you see?\" asked the fellow sullenly, and then Tom did notice  that the man still had on his tramp make-up.    \"What do you want?\" asked Tom.    \"Hard to tell,\" replied the burglar calmly. \"I hadn't got the safe  open before you came down and disturbed me. I'm after money,  naturally.\"    \"No, you're not!\" exclaimed Tom.    \"What's that?\" and the man seemed surprised.    \"No, you're not!\" went on Tom, and he held his rifle in readiness.  \"You're after the patent papers and the model of the turbine motor.  But it's gone. Your confederates got it away from me. They probably  haven't told you yet, and you're still on the hunt for it. You'll  not get it, but I've got you.\"    \"So I see,\" admitted Happy Harry, and he spoke with some culture.  \"If you don't mind,\" he went on, \"would you just as soon move that  gun a little? It's pointing right at my head, and it might go off.\"    \"It is going off--very soon!\" exclaimed Tom grimly, and the tramp  started in alarm. \"Oh, I'm not going to shoot you,\" continued the  young inventor. \"I'm going to fire this as an alarm, and the  engineer will come in here and tie you up. Then I'm going to hand  you over to the police. This rifle is a repeater, and I am a pretty  good shot. I'm going to fire once now, to summon assistance, and if  you try to get away I'll be ready to fire a second time, and that  won't be so comfortable for you. I've caught you, and I'm going to  hold on to you until I get that model and those papers back.\"    \"Oh, you are, eh?\" asked the burglar calmly. \"Well, all I've got to  say is that you have grit. Go ahead. I'm caught good and proper. I  was foolish to come in here, but I thought I'd take a chance.\"    \"Who are you, anyhow? Who are the men working with you to defraud my  father of his rights?\" asked Tom somewhat bitterly.    \"I'll never tell you,\" answered the burglar. \"I was hired to do  certain work, and that's all there is to it. I'm not going to peach  on my pals.\"    \"We'll see about that!\" burst out Tom. Then he noticed that a  dining-room window behind where the burglar was kneeling was open.  Doubtless the intruder had entered that way, and intended to escape  in the same manner.    \"I'm going to shoot,\" announced Tom, and, aiming his rifle at the  open window, where the bullet would do no damage, he pressed the  trigger. He noticed that the burglar was crouching low down on the  floor, but Tom thought nothing of this at the time. He imagined that  Happy Harry--or whatever his name was--might be afraid of getting  hit.    There was a flash of fire and a deafening report as Tom fired. The  cloud of smoke obscured his vision for a moment, and as the echoes  died away Tom could hear Mrs. Baggert screaming in her room.    \"It's all right!\" cried the young inventor reassuringly. \"No one is  hurt, Mrs. Baggert!\" Then he flashed his light on the spot where the  burglar had crouched. As the smoke rolled away Tom peered in vain  for a sight of the intruder.    Happy Harry was gone!    Holding his rifle in readiness, in case he should be attacked from  some unexpected quarter, Tom strode forward. He flashed his light in  every direction. There was no doubt about it. The intruder had fled.  Taking advantage of the noise when the gun was fired, and under  cover of the smoke, the burglar had leaped from the open window. Tom  guessed as much. He hurried to the casement and peered out, at the  same time noticing the cut wire of the burglar alarm. It was quite  dark, and he fancied he could hear the noise of some one running  rapidly. Aiming his rifle into the air, he fired again, at the same  time crying out:    \"Hold on!\"    \"All right, Master Tom, I'm coming!\" called the voice of the  engineer from his shack. \"Are you hurt? Is Mrs. Baggert murdered? I  hear her screaming.\"    \"That's pretty good evidence that she isn't murdered,\" said Tom with  a grim smile.    \"Are you hurt?\" again called Mr. Jackson.    \"No, I'm all right,\" answered Tom. \"Did you see any one running away  as you came up?\"    \"No, Master Tom, I didn't. What happened?\"    \"A burglar got in, and I had him cornered, but he got away when I  fired to arouse you.\"    By this time the engineer was at the stoop, on which the window  opened. Tom unlocked a side door and admitted Mr. Jackson, and then,  the incandescent light having been turned on, the two looked around  the apartment. Nothing in it had been disturbed, and the safe had  not been opened.    \"I heard him just in time,\" commented Tom, telling the engineer what  had happened. \"I wish I had thought to get between him and the  window. Then he couldn't have gotten away.\"    \"He might have injured you, though,\" said Mr. Jackson. \"We'll go  outside now, and look--\"    \"Is any one killed? Are you both murdered?\" cried Mrs. Baggert at  the dining-room door. \"If any one is killed I'm not coming in there.  I can't bear the sight of blood.\"    \"No one is hurt,\" declared Tom with a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324"],[0,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus (#17)"],[1,"l;  but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of  poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed  violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She herself wept  as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own agitation and anguish  was extreme during the whole trial. I believed in her innocence; I knew  it. Could the daemon, who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my  brother, also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death  and ignominy? I could not sustain the horror of my situation; and when I  perceived that the popular voice, and the countenances of the judges,  had already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in  agony. The tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained  by innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom, and would not  forego their hold.    I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to the  court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal  question; but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my  visit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was  condemned.    I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced  sensations of horror; and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them  adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the  heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom I  addressed myself added, that Justine had already confessed her guilt.  \"That evidence,\" he observed, \"was hardly required in so glaring a case,  but I am glad of it; and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a  criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive.\"    This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had my  eyes deceived me? and was I really as mad as the whole world would  believe me to be, if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I hastened  to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.    \"My cousin,\" replied I, \"it is decided as you may have expected; all  judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer, than that one guilty  should escape. But she has confessed.\"    This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness  upon Justine's innocence. \"Alas!\" said she, \"how shall I ever again  believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my  sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?  her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has  committed a murder.\"    Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see  my cousin. My father wished her not to go; but said, that he left it to  her own judgment and feelings to decide. \"Yes,\" said Elizabeth, \"I will  go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me: I  cannot go alone.\" The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could  not refuse.    We entered the gloomy prison-chamber, and beheld Justine sitting on some  straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested  on her knees. She rose on seeing us enter; and when we were left alone  with her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly.  My cousin wept also.    \"Oh, Justine!\" said she, \"why did you rob me of my last consolation? I  relied on your innocence; and although I was then very wretched, I was  not so miserable as I am now.\"    \"And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also  join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?\" Her  voice was suffocated with sobs.    \"Rise, my poor girl,\" said Elizabeth, \"why do you kneel, if you are  innocent? I am not one of your enemies; I believed you guiltless,  notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself  declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be assured,  dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment,  but your own confession.\"    \"I did confess; but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might obtain  absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my  other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was condemned, my  confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost  began to think that I was the monster that he said I was. He threatened  excommunication and hell fire in my last moments, if I continued  obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked on me as a  wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do? In an evil  hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable.\"    She paused, weeping, and then continued--\"I thought with horror, my  sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt  had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a  crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated. Dear  William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in heaven,  where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to  suffer ignominy and death.\"    \"Oh, Justine! forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you. Why  did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I will  proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony hearts of  your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die!--You, my  play-fellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold! No! no! I  never could survive so horrible a misfortune.\"    Justine shook her head mournfully. \"I do now not fear to die,\" she said;  \"that pang is past. God raises my weakness, and gives me courage to  endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember  me, and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the  fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to the  will of Heaven!\"    During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison-room,  where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who  dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the  awful boundary between life and death, felt not as I did, such deep and  bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth, and ground them together, uttering a  groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When she saw who  it was, she approached me, and said, \"Dear sir, you are very kind to  visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?\"    I could not answer. \"No, Justine,\" said Elizabeth; \"he is more convinced  of your innocence than I was; for even when he heard that you had  confessed, he did not credit it.\"    \"I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude  towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affection  of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than half my  misfortune; and I feel as if I could die in peace, now that my innocence  is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.\"    Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed  gained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the  never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or  consolation. Elizabeth also wept, and was unhappy; but her's also was  the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair  moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and  despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within  me, which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with  Justine; and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear  herself away. \"I wish,\" cried she, \"that I were to die with you; I  cannot live in this world of misery.\"    Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty  repressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth, and said, in a voice  of half-suppressed emotion, \"Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my  beloved and only friend; may Heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve  you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer! Live,  and be happy, and make others so.\"    And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth's heart-rending eloquence  failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the  criminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant appeals  were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers, and heard  the harsh unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal died away  on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the  sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She perished on the scaffold as  a murderess!    From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and  voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my father's  woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home--all was the work  of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones; but these are not  your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound  of your lamentations shall again and again be heard! Frankenstein, your  son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend  each vital drop of blood for your sakes--who has no thought nor sense of  joy, except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances--who would  fill the air with blessings, and spend his life in serving you--he bids  you weep--to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus  inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the  peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!    Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,  I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and  Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.          CHAPTER IX.      Nothing is more painful to the human mind, than, after the feelings have  been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of  inaction and certainty which follows, and deprives the soul both of hope  and fear.
