[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34131"],[0,"Butterflies and Moths (British) (#17)"],[1,"There was a time when we would try to capture a butterfly at rest on a  flower by a quick sweep of the hand, or, more commonly, by a sharp  downward stroke of the cap. We were led to this action by a mere  childish love of sport, or by a desire to possess an insect simply  because it was pretty. When we succeeded in securing our prize, we  handled it somewhat carelessly, often passing it from one hand to the  other, or boxing it in our closed and perspiring fist till our fingers  were dusted with the pretty microscopic scales of the creature's wings,  and the wings themselves, stripped of all their beautiful clothing, were  merely transparent and veined membranes. Having thus carelessly but  unintentionally deprived the creature of its greatest beauty, we set it  free, often in such a damaged or exhausted condition that the poor thing  could scarcely fly.    But our childish ideas and inclinations have vanished. Now we would  rather watch the insect than catch it, for we find much pleasure and  interest in its varied movements. And if for purposes of study we  occasionally require to make one captive, we proceed in such a manner as  to preserve its beauty unimpaired. The cap now gives place to a  well-made and suitable net; and we are careful to provide ourselves with  sufficient and proper accommodation for our captives.    It is probable that many of my readers are as yet unacquainted with the  nature of an entomologist's requirements for field work, so we shall  describe them, confining ourselves at first to those that are required  for a butterfly hunt.    First and foremost comes the net. This essential portion of your  equipment may be either purchased or constructed by yourself. Very  little skill is required to enable you to do the former. Provided your  pocket is well charged, you may start off at once to the dealer in  naturalists' appliances, and treat yourself to a complete outfit. But  even in this case a little advice may not be out of place. See that what  you purchase is very _strongly_ made. You can get nicely finished nets  constructed on the most convenient principles, made to fold and go in an  ordinary coat pocket, but with _weak joints_. See that you have the most  convenient form of net by all means, but do not go in for convenience  and appearance at the expense of strength and durability. Nothing is  more annoying than to find your net give way just when you are in the  midst of a good day's sport.    [Illustration: FIG. 39.--A WIRE FRAME FOR A BUTTERFLY NET.]    [Illustration: FIG. 40.]    The folding net is certainly very convenient, for you can conceal it in  your pocket while you are walking through town or travelling in a  railway carriage, and thus avoid that contemptuous gaze which certain of  the public are prone to cast on a poor 'bug hunter.' And although such  nets are generally purchased, yet they _may_ be constructed by anyone  who has had experience in the working of metals. But other forms of  nets, equally useful and even stronger, can be made by anybody; and I  will give a few hints on two or three different ways of putting them  together.    A very simple and strong frame for a net may be made as follows: Get a  piece of stout iron or brass wire about forty inches in length, and bend  it into a circle with the two ends, turned out about two inches each, at  right angles to the circumference as shown in the accompanying sketch.    Now take a good tough stick, the length of an ordinary walking stick,  and cut out two grooves opposite each other at the end, just large  enough to take the straight ends of the wire. The end of the stick will  now resemble fig. 40 in shape. Place the ends in their grooves, and bind  them tightly to the stick by a good many turns of rather fine wire.    A frame well made after this fashion is as strong as anything you could  desire, but it has the disadvantage of being always fixed to the handle,  thus preventing the use of the latter as a walking stick when you are  not directly engaged in your entomological work.    A much more convenient frame may be made by thrusting the ends of a  piece of cane into the two narrow arms of a metal Y. You may purchase  the Y at any of the naturalists' stores, or you can make one yourself if  you know how to perform the operation of soldering. I have always made  mine with odds and ends of brass tubing such as old gas pipes. One piece  must be just the size to fix on the stick; and the other two must fit  the cane tightly. The three pieces must be filed off at the proper  angles, and the doubly bevelled end of the wider tube must then be  flattened down to the width of the smaller ones before soldering. If you  decide to buy one, give the preference to strong brass rather than the  cheaper and more fragile ones made of tinned iron.    [Illustration: FIG. 41. THE METAL Y.]    The advantage of such an arrangement over the last frame is evident at  once. The cane, with net attached, can be pulled out of the Y when not  in use, and bent small enough to go in the pocket or a satchel; and the  Y can also be separated from the stick, thus allowing the latter to be  used as a walking stick.    Some entomologists speak very favourably of what is known as the  'umbrella net'--a large and light net that will shut up like an  umbrella, and may even be made to look very much like this useful  protector, but the possession of such an imitation is somewhat  tantalising in a pelting shower. The ring of this net consists of two  steel springs attached to a couple of brass hinges, one of which is  fixed near one end of the handle, while the other slides up and down in  the gamp fashion.    One other form of net--'the clap net'--although still occasionally seen,  has had its best days. Two sticks are provided to this one, so that the  two sides of the net may be brought together on the insect; but as both  hands are required to manage it, it is almost surprising that it ever  had any advocates at all.    When your frame is completed, sew round it a strip of strong calico, to  which the net itself may be afterwards sewn, for the lighter material of  the net is too delicate to stand the constant friction against the metal  or cane frame.    The material usually employed in making the 'bag' is called leno. It can  be purchased at most of the drapers' shops, and three colours--white,  yellow and green--are usually kept in stock. Measure the circumference  of your net frame, and see that you get sufficient leno to make a good  full net. Suppose, for instance, that the circle of your frame measures  thirty-six inches round, then your leno should be at least forty inches  in length. Fold this double, and then cut out two pieces of the shape  shown in fig. 42, letting the depth of the net be nearly or quite equal  to the width of the material. There is nothing to be done now but to  stitch the bag together and sew it to the calico on the ring.    [Illustration: FIG. 42.]    At first you will find the leno rather stiff and harsh, but a damping  and good rubbing between the hands will soften it down; or, if you  prefer it, you may soften the material by a slight washing before  cutting out the net. The latter is perhaps the better plan, for the  washing will remove the objectionable 'dressing' that renders the  material rather hard and stiff.    Of the three colours mentioned above, green is the one most generally  chosen, because it is more in harmony with the surroundings of a  butterfly catcher; but many prefer the white leno to the green, as the  insects are more easily seen in a net of this colour. Yellow is  certainly not a desirable tint.    As a rule it will be necessary to kill an insect as soon as it is  captured. This is always the case with butterflies unless you require to  keep them alive either to watch their movements or to obtain eggs. For  this purpose you will require a killing bottle or box containing some  volatile substance.    The selection of this necessary piece of apparatus is a point deserving  of much consideration, for so many different forms are in use by  different entomologists, and so many advocates each declare that his own  plan is far superior to that of any of the others, that the final  decision is not to be worked out in a moment. The best thing for a  beginner is to try as many as he can, and then, after some considerable  experience of his own, he will be able to decide which apparatus suits  himself best.    I recommend this because it is impossible to say of any one plan that it  is the best, for that which gives perfect satisfaction to one individual  will often fail to give anything but annoyance in the hands of another.    To enable my young readers to follow the advice I have just given, I  will describe some of the commonly used killing arrangements and show  how they should be used.    I will take first the 'cyanide bottle.' This is a wide-mouthed bottle,  containing a very poisonous substance called _cyanide of potassium_. It  is fitted with a good sound cork. The 'cyanide' is a solid substance,  and must be fixed in some way or other at the bottom of the bottle so  that it cannot shake about and damage the butterflies.    [Illustration: FIG. 43.--THE CYANIDE BOTTLE.]    A cyanide bottle can be purchased ready for use at the cost of a  shilling or thereabouts; but if you are old enough to be trusted with  deadly poisons, you may buy the 'cyanide' of a chemist who knows you  well and is satisfied as to your intentions, and then prepare your own.  Every entomologist should know how to do this, for the poison loses its  power after some time, and it is not always convenient to leave your  bottle in the hands of a chemist or a 'naturalist' to have it recharged.  This will cost you more than it would to do it yourself, but that is  nothing compared with the annoyance that may result when, the night  before an anticipated butterfly hunt, you are calmly told that 'your"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34175"],[0,"Domestic Animals (#17)"],[1,"as before, where it stands three or four  hours, and is again worked over; again replaced for five or six hours,  when it is worked over for the third time. It is now replaced, where it  stands till the next morning, and worked over for the fourth time. A  small quantity of nitre is then put in the butter. Thus finished, it is  placed in firkins holding about eighty-five pounds.    Previous to packing, the firkin is scalded with hot water, rinsed and  cooled with cold water, then rubbed all around with fine salt; this  prevents the butter from adhering to the sides of the firkin. When the  firkin is full, a linen cloth is placed over the top of the butter; on  this cloth a covering of salt is put one inch deep, and cold water  enough added to it to form a brine. It then stands till it is to be sent  to market, when the cloth and salt are removed, the firkin turned down,  the top of the butter in the keg washed with cold water, and the pickle  drained off. The firkin is now neatly headed up and sent to market.\"    The salt added to the butter should be from 1-24th to 1-28th of its  weight, or about two-thirds of an ounce to a pound, and this must be of  the best quality. All the buttermilk must be thoroughly extracted by  repeated washings; and when completed, the butter should be immediately  packed, and not a particle of air allowed to come in contact with it  till opened for the table.      CHEESE.    The Circumstances affecting the Quality of Cheese.    \"All cheese consists essentially of the curd, mixed with a certain  portion of the fatty matter, and of the sugar of milk. But differences  in the quality of the milk, in the proportion in which the several  constituents of milk are mixed together, or in the general mode of dairy  management, give rise to varieties of cheese almost without number.  Nearly every dairy district produces one or more qualities of cheese  peculiar to itself.      Natural Differences in the Milk    It is obvious that whatever gives rise to natural differences in the  quality of the milk, must affect also that of the cheese prepared from  it. If the milk be poor in butter, so must the cheese be. If the pasture  be such as to give a milk rich in cream, the cheese will partake of the  same quality. If the herbage or other food affect the taste of the milk  or cream, it will also modify the flavor of the cheese.      Milk of Different Animals.    So the milk of different animals will give cheese of unlike qualities.  The ewe-milk cheeses of Tuscany, Naples, and Languedoc, and those of  goats' milk made on Mont Dor and elsewhere, are celebrated for qualities  which are not possessed by cheeses prepared from cows' milk in a similar  way. Buffalo milk also gives a cheese of peculiar qualities, which is  manufactured in some parts of the Neapolitan territory.\"    Other kinds of cheese are made from mixtures of the milk of different  animals. Thus the strong-tasted cheese of Lecca and the celebrated  Roquefort cheese are prepared from mixtures of goat with ewe milk, and  the cheese of Mont Cenis from both of these mixed with the milk of the  cow.      Creamed or Uncreamed Milk.    Still further differences are produced, according to the proportion of  cream which is left in or is added to the milk. Thus, if cream only be  employed, we have the rich _cream-cheese_ which must be eaten in a  comparatively recent state. Or, if the cream of the previous night's  milking be added to the new milk of the morning, we may have such cheese  as the _Stilton_ of England, or the small, soft, and rich _Brie_  cheeses, so much esteemed in France.    If the entire milk only be used, we have such cheeses as the _Cheshire_,  the _Double Gloucester_, the _Cheddar_, the _Wiltshire_, and the  _Dunlop_ cheeses of Britain, the Kinnegad cheese of Ireland, and the  Gouda and Edam cheeses of Holland. Even here, however, it makes a  difference, whether the warm milk from the cow is curdled alone, as at  Gouda and Edam, or whether it is mixed with the milk of the evening  before, as is generally done in Cheshire and Ayrshire. Many persons are  of opinion that cream, which has once been separated, can never be so  well mixed again with the milk, that a portion of the fatty matter shall  not flow out with the whey and render the cheese less rich.    If the cream of the evening's milk be removed, and the skimmed milk  added to the new milk of the next morning, such cheeses as the _Single  Gloucester_ are obtained. If the cream be taken once from _all_ the  milk, the better kinds of skimmed-milk cheese, such as the Dutch cheese  of Leyden, are prepared; while if the milk be twice skimmed, we have the  poorer cheeses of Friesland and Groningen. If skimmed for three or four  days in succession, we get the hard and horny cheeses of Essex and  Sussex, which often require the axe to break them up.      Buttermilk Cheese.    But poor or butterless cheese will also differ in quality according to  the state of the milk from which it is extracted. If the new milk be  allowed to stand to throw up its cream, and this be then removed in the  usual way, the ordinary skimmed-milk cheese will be obtained by adding  rennet to the milk. But if, instead of skimming, we allow the milk to  stand till it begins to sour, and then remove the butter by churning the  whole, we obtain the milk in a sour state, (_buttermilk_.) From this  milk the curd separates naturally by gentle heating. But being thus  prepared from sour milk, and without the use of rennet, buttermilk  cheese differs more or less in quality from that which is made from  sweet skimmed-milk. The acid in the buttermilk, especially after it has  stood a day or two, is capable of coagulating new milk also; and thus,  by mixing more or less sweet milk with the buttermilk before it is  warmed, several other qualities of mixed butter and sweet-milk cheese  may readily be manufactured.      Whey Cheese.    The whey which separates from the curd, and especially the white whey,  which is pressed out towards the last, contains a portion of curd, and  not unfrequently a considerable quantity of butter also. When the whey  is heated, the curd and butter rise to the surface, and are readily  skimmed off. This curd alone will often yield a cheese of excellent  quality, and so rich in butter, that a very good imitation of Stilton  cheese may sometimes be made with alternate layers of new-milk curd and  this curd of whey.      Mixtures of Vegetable Substances with the Milk.    New varieties of cheese are formed by mixing vegetable substances with  the curd. A green decoction of two parts of sage leaves, one of  marigold, and a little parsley, gives its color to the _green cheese_ of  Wiltshire; some even mix up the entire leaves with the curd. The  celebrated Schabzieger cheese of Switzerland, is made by crushing the  skim-milk cheese after it is several months old to fine powder in a  mill, mixing it then with one-tenth of its weight of fine salt, and  one-twentieth of the powdered leaves of the mellilot trefoil,  (_trifolium melilotus cerulea_,) and afterwards with oil or butter,  working the whole into a paste, which is pressed and carefully dried.      Potato Cheeses,    As they are called, are made in various ways. One pound of sour milk is  mixed with five pounds of boiled potatoes and a little salt, and the  whole is beat into a pulp, which, after standing five or six days, is  worked up again, and then dried in the usual way. Others mix three parts  of dried boiled potatoes with two of fresh curd, or equal weights, or  more curd than potato, according to the quality required. Such cheeses  are made in Thuringia, in Saxony, and in other parts of Germany. In  Savoy, an excellent cheese is made by mixing one of the pulp of potatoes  with three of ewe-milk curd; and in Westphalia, a potato cheese is made  with skimmed milk.      Preparation of Rennet.    Rennet is prepared from the salted stomach or intestines of the sucking  calf, the unweaned lamb, the young kid, or even the young pig. In  general, however, the stomach of the calf is preferred, and there are  various ways of curing and preserving it.    The stomach of the newly killed animal contains a quantity of curd  derived from the milk on which it has been fed. In most districts, it is  usual to remove by a gentle washing the curd and slimy matters which are  present in the stomach, as they are supposed to impart a strong taste to  the cheese. In Cheshire, the curd is frequently salted separately for  immediate use. In Ayrshire and Limburg, on the other hand, the curd is  always left in the stomach and salted along with it. Some even give the  calf a copious draught of milk shortly before it is killed, in order  that the stomach may contain a larger quantity of the valuable curd.      Salting the Stomach.    In the mode of salting the stomach, similar differences prevail. Some  merely put a few handfuls of salt into and around it, then roll it  together, and hang it near the chimney to dry. Others salt it in a  pickle for a few days, and then hang it up to dry; while others pack  several of them in layers, with much salt both within and without, and  preserve them in a cool place, till the cheese-making season of the  following year. They are then taken out, drained from the brine, spread  upon a table, sprinkled with salt which is rolled in with a wooden  roller, and then hung up to dry. In some foreign countries, the recent  stomach is minced very fine, mixed with salt and bread into a paste, put  into a bladder, and then dried. In Lombardy, the stomach, after being  salted and dried, is minced and mixed up with salt, pepper, and a little  whey or water into a paste, which is preserved for use.    In whatever way the stomach or intestine of the calf is prepared and  preserved, the almost universal opinion seems to be, that it should be  kept for 10 or 12 months, before it is capable of yielding the best and  strongest rennet.
