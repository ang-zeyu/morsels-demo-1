It is evident that Milton was familiar with the apparently irregular  paths pursued by the planets when observed from the Earth. He knew of  their stationary points, and also the backward loopings traced out by  them on the surface of the sphere.    If observed from the Sun, all the planets would be seen to follow their  true paths round that body; their motion would invariably lie in the  same direction, and any variation in their speed as they approached  perihelion or aphelion would be real. But the planets, when observed  from the Earth, which is itself in motion, appear to move irregularly.  Sometimes they remain stationary for a brief period, and, instead of  progressing onward, affect a retrograde movement. This irregularity of  motion is only apparent, and can be explained as a result of the  combined motions of the Earth and planets, which are travelling together  round the Sun with different velocities, and in orbits of unequal  magnitude.    In his allusion to the Copernican system the 'planet' 'Earth' is  described by Milton as seventh. This is not strictly accurate, as only  five planets were known--viz. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn;  but to make up the number Milton has included the Moon, which may be  regarded as the Earth's planet.    The three motions ascribed to the Earth are--(1) The diurnal rotation on  her axis; (2) her annual revolution round the Sun; (3) Precession of the  Equinoxes.    The rotation of the Earth on her axis may be likened to the spinning  motion of a top, and is the cause of the alternation of day and night.  This rotatory motion is sustained with such exact precision that, during  the past 2,000 years, it has been impossible to detect the minutest  difference in the time in which the Earth accomplishes a revolution on  her axis, and therefore the length of the sidereal day, which is 3  minutes 56 seconds shorter than the mean solar day, is invariable. In  this motion of the Earth we have a time-measuring unit which may be  regarded as absolutely correct.    The Earth completes a revolution of her orbit in 365-1/4 days. In this  period of time she accomplishes a journey of 580 millions of miles,  travelling at the average rate of 66,000 miles an hour. The change of  the seasons, and the lengthening and shortening of the day, are natural  phenomena, which occur as a consequence of the Earth's annual revolution  round the Sun. Precession is a retrograde or westerly motion of the  equinoctial points, caused by the attraction of the Sun, Moon, and  planets on the spheroidal figure of the Earth. By this movement the  poles of the Earth are made to describe a circular path in that part of  the heavens to which they point; so that, after the lapse of many years,  the star which is known as the Pole Star will not occupy the position  indicated by its name, but will be situated at a considerable distance  from the pole. These motions, Milton says, unless attributed to the  Earth, must be ascribed to several spheres crossing and thwarting each  other obliquely; but the Earth, by rotating from west to east, will of  herself fetch day, her other half, averted from the Sun's rays, being  enveloped in night. Thus saving the Sun his labour, and the 'primum  mobile,' 'that swift nocturnal and diurnal rhomb,' which carried all the  lower spheres along with it, and brought about the change of day and  night.    Milton's allusion to the occurrence of natural phenomena in the Moon  similar to those which happen on the Earth is in keeping with the  opinions entertained regarding our satellite, Galileo having imagined  that he discovered with his telescope continents and seas on the lunar  surface, which led to the belief that the Moon was the abode of  intelligent life.        ... and other suns, perhaps,      With their attendant moons, thou wilt descry      Communicating male and female light.--viii. 148-50.    Milton in these lines refers to Jupiter and Saturn, and their  satellites, which had been recently discovered; those of the former by  Galileo, and four of those of the latter by Cassini. The existence of  male and female light was an idea entertained by the ancients, and which  is mentioned by Pliny. The Sun was regarded as a masculine star, and the  Moon as feminine; the light emanating from each being similarly  distinguished, and possessing different properties.    Milton supposes that, as the Earth receives light from the stars, she  returns light back to them. But in his time little was known about the  stars, nor was it ascertained how distant they are.    The Angel, in bringing to a conclusion his conversation with Adam, deems  it unadvisable to vouchsafe him a decisive reply to his inquiry  regarding the motions of celestial bodies, and in the following lines  gives a beautifully poetical summary of this elevated and philosophic  discussion:--        But whether thus these things, or whether not,      Whether the Sun, predominant in Heaven,      Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun;      He from the east his flaming round begin,      Or she from west her silent course advance      With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps      On her soft axle, whilst she paces even,      And bears thee soft with the smooth air along--      Solicit not thy thoughts with matters hid.--viii. 159-67.    In this scientific discourse between Adam and Raphael, in which they  discuss the structural arrangement of the heavens and the motions of  celestial bodies, we are afforded an opportunity of learning what exact  and comprehensive knowledge Milton possessed of both the Ptolemaic and  Copernican theories. The concise and accurate manner in which he  describes the doctrines belonging to each system indicates that he must  have devoted considerable time and attention to making himself master of  the details associated with both theories, which in his time were the  cause of much controversy and discussion among philosophers and men of  science.    The Ptolemaic system, with its crystalline spheres revolving round the  Earth, the addition to those of cycles and epicycles, and the heaping of  them upon each other, in order to account for phenomena associated with  the motions of celestial bodies, are concisely and accurately described.    The unreasonableness of this theory, when compared with the Copernican,  is clearly delineated by Milton where Adam is made to express his views  with regard to motion in the heavens. His argument, declared in logical  and persuasive language, demonstrates how contrary to reason it would be  to imagine that the entire heavens should revolve round the Earth to  bring about a result which could be more easily attained by imparting  motion to the Earth herself. The inconceivable velocity with which it  would be necessary for the celestial orbs to travel in order to  accomplish their daily revolution is described by him as opposed to all  reason, and entailing upon them a journey which it would be impossible  for material bodies to perform. None the less accurate is Milton's  description of the Copernican system. He describes the Sun as occupying  that position in the system which his magnitude and supreme importance  claim as his sole right, having the planets with their satellites,        That from his lordly eye keep distance due.--iii. 578,    circling in majestic orbits around him, acknowledging his controlling  power, and bending to his firm but gentle sway. Their positions, their  paths, and their motions, real and apparent, are described in flowing  and harmonious verse.          CHAPTER IV    MILTON AND GALILEO      After the death of his mother, which occurred in 1637, Milton expressed  a desire to visit the Continent, where there were many places of  interest which he often longed to see. Having obtained the consent of  his kind and indulgent father, he set out on his travels in April 1638,  accompanied by a single man-servant, and arrived in Paris, where he only  stayed a few days. During his residence in the French capital he was  introduced by Lord Scudamore, the English Ambassador at the Court of  Versailles, to Hugo Grotius, one of the most distinguished scholars and  philosophic thinkers of his age. From Paris Milton journeyed to Nice,  where he first beheld the beauty of Italian scenery and the classic  shores of the Mediterranean Sea. From Nice he sailed to Genoa and  Leghorn, and after a short stay at those places continued his journey to  Florence, one of the most interesting and picturesque of Italian cities.  Situated in the Valley of the Arno, and encircled by sloping hills  covered with luxuriant vegetation, the sides of which were studded with  residences half-hidden among the foliage of gardens and vineyards,  Florence, besides being famed for its natural beauty, was at that time  the centre of Italian culture and learning, and the abode of men eminent  in literature and science. Here Milton remained for a period of two  months, and enjoyed the friendship and hospitality of its most noted  citizens, many of whom delighted to honour their English visitor. He was  warmly welcomed by the members of the various literary academies, who  admired his compositions and conversation; the flattering encomiums  bestowed upon him by those learned societies having been amply repaid by  Milton in choice and elegant Latin verse.    Among those who resided in the vicinity of Florence was the illustrious  Galileo, who in his sorrow-stricken old age was held a prisoner of the  Inquisition for having upheld and taught scientific doctrines which were  declared to be heretical. After his abjuration he was committed to  prison, but on the intervention of influential friends was released  after a few days' incarceration, and permitted to return to his home at  Arcetri. He was, however, kept under strict surveillance, and forbidden  to leave his house or receive any of his intimate friends without having  first obtained"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28458"],[0,"What a Young Woman Ought to Know (#17)"],[1,"merely to a slow development, and in this case there is nothing to do  but wait. If the girl seems well, if she has no backache, no headache,  no general lassitude, no undue nervous symptoms, the mere  non-appearance of the menses need occasion no alarm. If, however, she  has these symptoms, it is an evidence that nature is attempting to  establish the function and is hindered either by general lack of  vitality or by some local condition, and in either case the giving of  forcing medicines would be a mistake. The weekly sitz bath would do no  harm as a semi-local measure. All proper precautions should be  observed as to maintenance of general health and mental serenity, and  if these do not prove sufficient the physician should be consulted.    In the case I mentioned, where the reproductive organs were lacking,  the girl had been subjected to a long course of home medication which  had proven disastrous to her digestion, and yet, as will be readily  understood, had not resulted in the establishment of a function that  is dependent upon organs which, in this case, did not exist.    Sometimes there are slight mechanical hindrances which can only be  determined by the physician, though their presence will be indicated  by the symptoms of menstruation without the accompanying sanguineous  discharge. In these cases the home medication is dangerous. If the  girl regularly has symptoms of approaching menstruation, with pain and  bloating, and these subside without flow, it would be wise to consult  the physician instead of resorting to domestic remedies or letting the  matter go on without attention.    Quite frequently the first appearance of menstruation is followed by  weeks or even months of freedom from its reappearance. In these cases  no alarm need be felt as long as the general health is not affected.  Again, there may be suspension of the function from change of  surroundings. Girls who go away to school often suffer from  irregularity. I have known of a case where the girl never menstruated  during the school year, but was perfectly regular during vacations.    These cases may be accounted for by the nervous strain, the using up  of vital forces in mental effort to such degree that there is nothing  left with which to carry on the menstrual function. In all such cases  it is wise to watch carefully the general health, and if all functions  are not properly conducted, to reduce the strain until the vitality is  able to keep all functions in order.    Girls are sometimes disturbed because the flow is scanty, and think  they should do something to increase the amount. It is no doubt true  that profuse menstrual flow is the result of our artificial lives. If  we lived more normally we should have naturally a scanty menstrual  flow. Therefore if a girl has good health and no monthly pain and the  flow is scanty, she may consider herself as more nearly in a normal  state, and be thankful.    If, however, the menses are suddenly less than normal it denotes a  suppression, which may be the result of cold, exhaustion of body,  weariness of nerves, mental anxiety, or disturbance of the emotions.    If gradual suppression occurs, accompanied by loss of health, it  indicates some constitutional difficulty or local trouble which  demands professional counsel.    Profuse menstruation is also a relative term, as there is no definite  standard as to amount of menstrual flow, nor the length of time it  should continue. The profuseness must be measured by the condition of  the individual. Where health seems fully maintained there would appear  no cause for anxiety. But if there is a marked increase over the  amount usual for the individual, if great weakness and prostration is  produced, either at the time or afterward, it may be called profuse,  and the cause may be either debility, that is weakness, or plethora,  which means fullness. If from the latter, there will be throbbing  headache, pain in the back, and general signs of fever. If from  debility, there will be pallor, weakness, and perhaps an almost  continuous flow.    As may be imagined, the treatment in the two cases will differ. The  full-blooded girl should be put on a plain, unstimulating diet, with  plenty of out-door exercise during the month, but about twenty-four  hours before the flow is expected she should have complete mental and  physical rest. She should remain in bed, and apply cold wet cloths  over the abdomen and between the thighs for an hour at a time, with  intervals of at least one-half hour between the applications. The  bowels should be freed from all fecal matter, and cool, small enemas  be given two or three times a day. If these simple measures do not  avail, the doctor should be consulted.    The pale and debilitated girl needs to rest. Sometimes, if hemorrhage  continues almost from one period to the next, she should remain in bed  even after the flow seems checked. The great desideratum is to build  up the general health, not by tonics, which are usually only  stimulants, but by the judicious observance of the laws of health.  This will, in many cases, call for the advice of the physician, who  can see and study the patient and her special conditions. It is not  safe to trust to book-doctoring.          CHAPTER XVIII.    CARE DURING MENSTRUATION.      I have said that I do not want you to think yourself a semi-invalid  and so be \"fussy\" about yourself, but I have also said that I want you  to take care of yourself at all times, and especially during your  menstrual periods. How can you make these ideas agree with each other?    I know that many writers say that a girl should spend one day each  month in bed, or at least lying down; that there are some things that  should always be forbidden to girls, simply because they are girls,  such as running up and down stairs. These wholesale restrictions make  girls rebellious at their womanhood. I simply want you to use good  sense at all times in your care of yourself.    Knowing the fact that just before and during menstruation the uterus  is heavier than at other times, because engorged with blood, and  remembering that it is loosely suspended, it is easy to understand  that long walks or severe exercise at the menstrual period will more  easily cause it to sag, and this sagging becoming permanent may cause  pain, backache, and other discomforts. Therefore, having good sense,  you will not plan to take long rides or walks or do any severe  exercise. At the same time moderate exercise in proper clothing will  tend to relieve pelvic congestion by equalizing the circulation, and  if the clothing is properly adjusted and the muscles are strong and  well-developed, an ordinary amount of physical activity may be  beneficial rather than harmful.    Girls are so often told that they must not walk at their monthly  periods, must not study, must not ride, etc., etc., that it really is  no wonder that they feel it a very undesirable thing to be a woman. My  observation leads me to believe that if girls from earliest childhood  were dressed loosely, with no clothing suspended on the hips, if their  muscles were well developed through judicious exercise, they would  seldom find it necessary to be semi-invalids at any time. In fact, we  do sometimes find a young woman who has no consciousness of physical  disturbance during menstruation. She can pursue her usual avocations  without hindrance, and finds her physical womanhood no bar to any  enjoyment.    This is as it should be; but as girls have not all been well developed  and properly dressed, we cannot assert that all girls can be  indifferent to physical conditions at this time. If a girl is well,  has no pain or discomfort, then I would say, let her use good common  sense in the ordering of her daily life and give the matter no special  or anxious thought. If she has pain or uneasiness, let her govern her  life accordingly, using care, taking some rest at the time of the  menses; but, above all things, let her arrange her clothing at all  times so as to secure for herself absolute freedom of movement. Then  let her, during the intervals between the menstrual periods, endeavor  by judicious exercise to build up strong muscular structure around the  vital organs, such structure as will support the _viscera_ where they  belong, and in time she will probably find herself growing free from  menstrual pain.    During the painful periods resulting from congestion it is often  advisable to keep the recumbent position, and to use heat both  externally and internally. However, I would advise never using  alcoholic beverages. Their apparent usefulness lies principally in the  hot water with which they are administered, and the danger of forming  the alcohol habit is too great to justify their use.    There are cases of nervous pain at menstruation that are aggravated by  heat and diminished by cold. I knew such a case where a girl at  school, suffering with menstrual pain, alarmed teachers and friends by  wringing towels out of cold water and laying them over her abdomen.  But the alarm subsided when they saw that the pain soon passed away  under the cold application. The girl was one in whom there were no  local congestions, but great nervous exhaustion and heat always  increased her sufferings, while cold allayed.    I have read that a woman should not bathe or change her underwear  while menstruating. I cannot see how soiled clothing can be more  healthful than that which is clean; and if well-aired, I should no  more object to your putting on clean underwear than to your changing  your dress. Most especially would I advise a frequent change of  napkins, in order to remove those which are soiled from their  irritating contact with the body. A full bath during menstruation  would, for most people, be unadvisable, but the cleansing of the  private parts is imperative. For this, tepid water, with good soap,  may be used daily or oftener.
