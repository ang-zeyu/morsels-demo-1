The young man gave up school-keeping, thinking it a  loss of time. He learned pencil-making, surveying, and farm work, and  found that by manual labor for six weeks in the year he could meet all  the expenses of living. He haunted the woods and pastures, explored  rivers and ponds, built the famous hut on Emerson's wood-lot with the  famous axe borrowed from Alcott, was put in jail for refusal to pay  his polltax, and, to sum up much in little, \"signed off\" from social  obligations. \"I, Henry D. Thoreau, have signed off, and do not hold  myself responsible to your multifarious uncivil chaos named Civil  Government.\" When his college class held its tenth reunion in 1847, and  each man was asked to send to the secretary a record of achievement,  Thoreau wrote: \"My steadiest employment, if such it can be called, is to  keep myself at the top of my condition and ready for whatever may turn  up in heaven or on earth.\" There is the motto of Transcendentalism,  stamped upon a single coin.    For \"to be ready for whatever may turn up\" is Thoreau's racier, homelier  version of Emerson's \"endless seeker\"; and Thoreau, more easily than  Emerson, could venture to stake everything upon the quest. The elder  man had announced the programme, but by 1847 he was himself almost  what Thoreau would call a \"committed man,\" with family and household  responsibilities, with a living to earn, and bound, like every  professional writer and speaker, to have some measure of regard for his  public. But Thoreau was ready to travel lightly and alone. If he should  fail in the great adventure for spiritual perfection, it was his own  affair. He had no intimates, no confidant save the multitudinous pages  of his \"Journal,\" from which--and here again he followed Emerson's  example--his future books were to be compiled. Many of his most loyal  admirers will admit that such a quest is bound, by the very conditions  of the problem, to be futile. Hawthorne allegorized it in \"Ethan Brand,\"  and his quaint illustration of the folly of romantic expansion of the  self apart from the common interests of human kind is the picture of a  dog chasing its own tail. \"It is time now that I begin to live,\" notes  Thoreau in the \"Journal,\" and he continued to say it in a hundred  different ways until the end of all his journalizing, but he never quite  captured the fugitive felicity. The haunting pathos of his own allegory  has moved every reader of \"Walden:\" \"I long ago lost a hound, a bay  horse, and a turtle-dove, and am still on their trail.\" Precisely what  he meant it is now impossible to say, but surely he betrays a doubt in  the ultimate efficacy of his own system of life. He bends doggedly to  the trail, for Henry Thoreau is no quitter, but the trail leads nowhere,  and in the latest volumes of the \"Journals\" he seems to realize that he  has been pursuing a phantom. He dived fearlessly and deep into himself,  but somehow he failed to grasp that pearl of great price which all the  transcendental prophets assured him was to be had at the cost of diving.    This is not to say that this austere and strenuous athlete came up quite  empty-handed. Far from it. The byproducts of his toil were enough to  have enriched many lesser men, and they have given Thoreau a secure  fame. From his boyhood he longed to make himself a writer, and an  admirable writer he became. \"For along time,\" he says in \"Walden,\" \"I  was reporter to a journal, of no very wide circulation, whose editor  has never seen fit to print the bulk of my contributions, and, as is too  common with writers, I got only my labor for my pains. However, in  this case my pains were their reward.\" Like so many solitaries, he  experienced the joy of intense, long-continued effort in composition,  and he was artist enough to know that his pages, carefully assembled  from his note books, had pungency, form, atmosphere. No man of his  day, not even Lowell the \"last of the bookmen,\" abandoned himself more  unreservedly to the delight of reading. Thoreau was an accomplished  scholar in the Greek and Roman classics, as his translations attest.  He had some acquaintance with several modern languages, and at one time  possessed the best collection of books on Oriental literature to  be found in America. He was drenched in the English poetry of the  seventeenth century. His critical essays in the \"Dial,\" his letters  and the bookish allusions throughout his writings, are evidence of  rich harvesting in the records of the past. He left some three thousand  manuscript pages of notes on the American Indians, whose history and  character had fascinated him from boyhood. Even his antiquarian hobbies  gave him durable satisfaction. Then, too, he had deep delight in his  life-long studies in natural history, in his meticulous measurements of  river currents, in his notes upon the annual flowering of plants and the  migration of birds. The more thoroughly trained naturalists of our own  day detect him now and again in error as to his birds and plants, just  as specialists in Maine woodcraft discover that he made amusing, and for  him unaccountable, blunders when he climbed Katahdin. But if he was not  impeccable as a naturalist or woodsman, who has ever had more fun out of  his enthusiasm than Thoreau, and who has ever stimulated as many men and  women in the happy use of their eyes? He would have had slight patience  with much of the sentimental nature study of our generation, and  certainly an intellectual contempt for much that we read and write  about the call of the wild; but no reader of his books can escape his  infection for the freedom of the woods, for the stark and elemental in  nature. Thoreau's passion for this aspect of life may have been selfish,  wolflike, but it is still communicative.    Once, toward the close of his too brief life, Thoreau \"signed on\" again  to an American ideal, and no man could have signed more nobly. It was  the cause of Freedom, as represented by John Brown of Harper's Ferry.  The French and Scotch blood in the furtive hermit suddenly grew hot.  Instead of renouncing in disgust the \"uncivil chaos called Civil  Government,\" Thoreau challenged it to a fight. Indeed he had already  thrown down the gauntlet in \"Slavery in Massachusetts,\" which Garrison  had published in the \"Liberator\" in 1854. And now the death upon the  scaffold of the old fanatic of Ossawatomie changed Thoreau into a  complete citizen, arguing the case and glorifying to his neighbors the  dead hero. \"It seems as if no man had ever died in America before; for  in order to die you must first have lived.... I hear a good many pretend  that they are going to die.... Nonsense! I'll defy them to do it. They  haven't got life enough in them. They'll deliquesce like fungi, and keep  a hundred eulogists mopping the spot where they left off. Only half  a dozen or so have died since the world began.\" Such passages as this  reveal a very different Thoreau from the Thoreau who is supposed to have  spent his days in the company of swamp-blackbirds and woodchucks. He  had, in fact, one of the highest qualifications for human society,  an absolute honesty of mind. \"We select granite,\" he says, \"for the  underpinning of our houses and barns; we build fences of stone; but we  do not ourselves rest on an underpinning of granite truth, the lowest  primitive rock. Our sills are rotten.... In proportion as our inward  life fails, we go more constantly and desperately to the postoffice.  You may depend upon it, that the poor fellow who walks away with the  greatest number of letters, proud of his extensive correspondence, has  not heard from himself this long time.\"    This hard, basic individualism was for Thoreau the foundation of all  enduring social relations, and the dullest observer of twentieth century  America can see that Thoreau's doctrine is needed as much as ever. His  sharp-edged personality provokes curiosity and pricks the reader into  dissent or emulation as the case may be, but its chief ethical value to  our generation lies in the fact that here was a Transcendentalist who  stressed, not the life of the senses, though he was well aware of their  seductiveness, but the stubborn energy of the will.    The scope of the present book prevents more than a glimpse at the other  members of the New England Transcendental group. They are a very mixed  company, noble, whimsical, queer, impossible. \"The good Alcott,\" wrote  Carlyle, \"with his long, lean face and figure, with his gray worn  temples and mild radiant eyes; all bent on saving the world by a return  to acorns and the golden age; he comes before one like a venerable Don  Quixote, whom nobody can laugh at without loving.\" These words paint a  whole company, as well as a single man. The good Alcott still awaits  an adequate biographer. Connecticut Yankee, peddler in the South,  school-teacher in Boston and elsewhere, he descended upon Concord,  flitted to the queer community of Fruitlands, was starved back to  Concord, inspired and bored the patient Emerson, talked endlessly, wrote  ineffective books, and had at last his apotheosis in the Concord School  of Philosophy, but was chiefly known for the twenty years before his  death in 1888 as the father of the Louisa Alcott who wrote \"Little  Women.\" \"A tedious archangel,\" was Emerson's verdict, and it is likely  to stand.    Margaret Fuller, though sketched by Hawthorne, analyzed by Emerson, and  painted at full length by Thomas Wentworth Higginson, is now a fading  figure--a remarkable woman, no doubt, one of the first of American  feminists, suggesting George Eliot in her physical unattractiveness,  her clear brain, her touch of sensuousness.

I have seen them in  a case of this kind where several and perhaps nearly all the hairs on  the end of the tail would shed or pull out thereby damaging the skin  to a greater or less extent.    Now when I get a mink in this condition after pulling on the board  and tacking all around, I split the tail open after which I lay it  open and tack all around the same way you would with an otter skin.  By employing this means you will often save the loss of the tail by  thus tainting and a corresponding loss on the value of the skin. The  value of the mink skin is in no way damaged by this process. Some  dealers prefer to have all the skins they buy cured in this manner.    For stretching the muskrat skin I also use a board of the same  thickness as for mink, about 20 inches in length, 6 1/2 or 7 inches  at the large end with a slightly rounding taper to a width of about 3  inches at small end, the sides planed down to a thin edge the same as  for the mink boards; in fact, I prefer the same manner of stretching  all cased skins, using care not to have the boards so wide as to  stretch the skins to a width much exceeding the natural width before  it was placed over the board, but giving them all the strain they  will stand with reason, lengthwise. If stretched too wide it tends to  make the fur thinner and lessens the value of it.    I usually pull the skins, especially muskrats, onto the boards far  enough so that the smaller end will extend through the mouth of the  skin for perhaps 1/2 inch, and when the skins are sufficiently dry to  remove, all that is required is to take hold of them with a hand on  either edge of the skin and give it a sharp tap on the small end,  when the skin will come off at once. By stretching the skins on the  boards with the back on one side, belly on the opposite side, they  come off the boards looking smooth and uniform in width, and command  a great deal better price than if thrown on in a haphazard way on a  shingle or an inch board badly shaped, as a great many beginners do.  I have seen some shameful work done in this respect.    It is always necessary to remove all surplus grease and fat which can  readily be done immediately after the skin is stretched, otherwise  they will heat, sweat and mold to a certain extent after they are  removed from the boards, which injures both the appearance and sale  of them. It is well to look after all these little details. These  descriptions are given with the desire to help some of the beginners.  If they will start in by using a little care in stretching and having  pride in their work they will find the business both more pleasant  and profitable.      * * *    If convenient when going into camp, writes an old successful trapper  who has pursued the fur bearers in many states, you should take  several stretching boards for your different kinds of fur with you.  If not, you can generally find a tree that will split good and you  can split some out. It is usually hard to find widths that are long  and straight enough to bend so as to form a good shaped stretcher.  You should always aim to stretch and cure furs you catch in the best  manner.    In skinning you should rip the animal straight from one heel across  to the other and close to the roots of the tail on the under side.  Work the skin loose around the bone at the base until you can grasp  the bone of the tail with the first two fingers of the right hand  while you place the bone between the first two fingers of the left  hand. Then, by pulling you will draw the entire bone from the tail  which you should always do.    Sometimes when the animal has been dead for some time the bone will  not readily draw from the tail. In this case cut a stick the size of  your finger about eight inches long. Cut it away in the center until  it will readily bend so that the two ends will come together. Then  cut a notch in each part of stick just large enough to let the bone  of the tail in and squeeze it out. It is necessary to whittle one  side of the stick at the notch so as to form a square shoulder.    You should have about three sizes of stretching boards for mink and  fox. For mink they should be from 4 1/2 inches down to 3 inches and  for fox from 6 1/4 inches down to 5 inches wide, and in length the  fox boards may be four feet long, and the mink boards three feet  long.    The boards should taper slightly down to within 8 inches of the end  for fox, and then rounded up to a round point. The mink boards should  be rounded at 4 or 5 inches from this point. You will vary the shape  of the board in proportion to the width. Stretching boards should not  be more than 3/8 inch thick. A belly strip the length or nearly the  length of the boards 1 1/4 inches at the wide end, tapering to a  point at the other end and about 1/4 to 3/8 inch thick. Have the  boards smooth and even on the edges. Other stretching boards should  be made in proportion to the size and shape of the animal whose skin  is to be stretched.    You should not fail to remove all the fat and flesh from the skin  immediately after the skin is on the board. If a skin is wet when  taken from the animal it should be drawn lightly on a board until the  fur is quite dry. Then turn the skin flesh side out and stretch.      * * *    Beginning at the left, dimensions and skins stretched on the various  boards are given:    No. 1. Mink board, length 28 inches and 4 wide.    No. 2. Mink board, length 28 inches and 3 1/2 wide.    No. 3. Weasel board length 20 inches and 2 1/2 wide.    No. 4. Muskrat board, length 21 inches and 6 inches wide.    No. 5. Opossum board, (small), length 20 inches and 6 1/2 inches  wide.    No. 6. Skunk or opossum, (medium), length 28 inches and 7 inches  wide.    No. 7. Skunk and opossum, (large), length 28 inches and 8 inches  wide.      [Illustration: SIZE OF STRETCHING BOARDS.]    Old and experienced hunters and trappers know about the shape and  size to make the various stretching boards for the fur bearers, but  for the guidance of beginners and those who are careless about  stretching pelts, the above description is especially meant.    Trappers in Southern sections will no doubt find the boards as  described here too large for most of their skunk. In the Northeast  the mink boards will also be too large, but for this section (Ohio),  they are about correct. The general shape of the boards can be seen  from the illustration.      * * *    One of the best ways, writes a Minnesota trapper, to take off the  skin of an animal is by cutting the skin around the hind legs or  feet, and then slitting the skin down inside the hind legs to the  body joining the two slits between the hind legs, then remove the  skin on the tail by pushing up the thumb nail, or a thin flat piece  of wood against the bone of the tail and draw off the skin.    Now commence to draw the body of the animal through the slit already  made without enlarging it, drawing the skin over itself, the fur side  within. When the forefeet are reached, cut the skin away from them at  the wrists, and then skin over the head until the mouth is reached  when the skin should be finally removed at the lips.    One thing to be borne in mind when stretching a skin to dry, is that  it must be drawn tight; another, that it must be stretched in a place  where neither the heat of a fire or that of the sun will reach it too  strongly, and it should not be washed. Large skins may be nailed on a  wall of a shed or barn.    The board stretcher should be made of some thin material. Prepare a  board of bass wood or some other light material, two feet three  inches long, three inches and a half wide at one end, and two inches  and an eighth at the other, and three-eighths of an inch thick.  Chamfer it from the center to the sides almost to an edge. Round and  chamfer the small end about an inch upon the sides. Split the board  through the center with a knife or saw, finally prepare a wedge of  the same length and thickness, one inch wide at the large end, and  taper to a blunt point. This is a stretcher suitable for a mink, or a  marten.    Two large sizes with similar proportions are required for the large  animals, the largest size suitable for the full grown otter and wolf,  should be five feet and a half long, seven inches wide at the large  end when fully spread by the wedge, and six inches at the small end.  An intermediate size is required for the fisher, raccoon, fox and  some other animals, the proportions of which can be easily figured  out.    These stretchers require that the skin of the animal should not be  ripped through the belly, but should be stripped off whole. Peel the  skin from the body by drawing it over itself, leaving the fur inward.  In this condition the skin should be drawn on to the split board  (with the back on one side and the belly on the other), to its utmost  length, and fastened with tacks, and then the wedge should be driven  between the two halves. Finally, make all fast by a tack at the root  of the tail, and another on the opposite side. The skin is then  stretched to its utmost capacity and it may be hung away to dry.      * * *    Not alone the skulls of the larger animals, but the skulls of any  game, the skeleton of any bird, or fish, has a ready market, provided  such specimens are properly cleaned, and in perfect condition.  However, the hunter or trapper must bear in mind the fact that it is  the perfect specimen that is in demand, and that a bruise on the bone  literally spoils it for the curator.    If you will look carefully at any skull, you will notice that some of  the bones are very thin and frail, almost like a spider web. These  fine bones must be preserved if they are to be of any value to the  Comparative Anatomist, and boiling or scraping"]]]
