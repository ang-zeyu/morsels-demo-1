I have not a single miserable coin about me; what do I  want with money? By all the saints in heaven and all the demons in hell,  do you imagine that I am one of those honest peasants who only drink  when they can pay for it?\"    All the bandits pulled out purses full of gold, and exclaimed--    \"Brother, take as much money as you want; we will lend it to you until  we make our next haul; you can then pay us back out of your share of  it.\"    \"I thank you,\" replied Martin; \"but I won't take it, for I don't want  it. You will see, by Se[~n]or Noah, that I'll manage to get wine enough to  make half Castile drunk, even if, to procure it, I have to send to the  devil all the innkeepers within ten leagues round us.\"    Thus speaking, he gave spurs to his horse, rode through the thick wood,  and disappeared, light as the wind, in the direction of a lonely  hostelry, which could scarcely be distinguished on the distant horizon.  He paid no attention to the voices of his new comrades, who called after  him, cautioning him of the risk he ran of falling into the hands of a  patrol of the Salvadores,[1] bodies of armed horsemen who, by command of  the king, requested to give it by the Count of Carrion and other  grandees, wandered through that district for the purpose of protecting  travellers from the attacks of the highwaymen.    [1] Saviours, deliverers.    We know not how Martin arranged matters with the innkeeper, but two  hours had scarcely passed when he returned, bringing, thrown across his  saddle-bow, a large leather wine-bag, which contained fully twenty  gallons, according to our modern measures. Shouts of joy and loud  applause received him on his return.    \"He is a good comrade, and will be the pride of the band of the Raposo.\"    \"What an aroma that wine has! It is three years old, at least.\"    \"I'd like to have some of those Moorish dogs here, to see if they would  turn up their noses at that gift of God.\"    \"The monks of Sahagun never taste better.\"    \"Thunder and lightning, what a night we'll have with it!\"    \"I'd turn Moor at once if Mahomet were only as good as it is.\"    \"The innkeeper was a heretic, and kept it without baptizing it.\"    \"Yes, yes, the wine-bag is a Moor--it is a Moor!\"    \"Then let us attack him. To arms--to arms! War, war!\"    \"War to the Moor! Up for St. James and Spain!\"    Such were some of the exclamations which followed the arrival of Martin.    Having uttered these cries, the bandits took several sacred vessels from  the heap whence the Raposo took the crucifix on which he had  administered the oath to Martin, and the sacrilegious ruffians filled  them with wine and lifted them to their impure lips.    Martin shuddered at the sight of this impious profanation and did not  take any part in it.    The Raposo noticed this, and said to him--    \"Brother, you would make a bad priest if you can't drink out of a  chalice. Is it because you have not taken orders?\"    \"By Lucifer!\" exclaimed Martin, placing his hand on his sword, feeling  persuaded that he was lost if he did not put on a bold face. \"Know, Don  Raposo, or Don Villain, that if I have not orders I at least have a  sword, and that if I do not drink wine, I'll drink the blood of anyone  that insults me as you do.\"    \"So, low peasant,\" replied the Raposo, also placing his hand on his  steel, \"you dare to speak thus to your captain! I'll resign my  honourable position if my dagger does not teach you to be respectful.\"    The two opponents held their naked swords, and were about to rush on  each other; all the bandits, however, hastened to make peace, trying to  persuade the Raposo that their new comrade, instead of meriting  punishment, deserved praise, since by his audacity he showed what might  be expected from him when occasion should arise. These reasonings  appeared to be satisfactory to the Raposo; he laid aside his vexation  and stretched out his hand to Martin, saying--    \"Pardon, brother; I only wished to try your mettle, and I am satisfied  with it.\"    \"You, se[~n]or captain, must pardon me,\" replied the young man, clasping  the rough hand of the bandit; \"but know that I cannot bear being  calumniated, by being supposed incapable of doing what my comrades do.  Do you think that it is scruples of conscience that prevent me from  using these vessels? I want a big draught of wine to satisfy my thirst,  and I shall not drink it from a nutshell, as you do.\"    Thus speaking, Martin took the helmet from the head of one of the  robbers, poured wine into it and emptied it at a draught, amid the  applause and acclamations of the bandits.    They continued without ceasing their libations, the wine-bag was getting  emptier and emptier, and drunkenness was overmastering all of them,  including the captain. Notwithstanding, Martin kept his head clear,  whether it was that he was more accustomed to wine, or, which is more  probable, that he drank very little, although he lifted the helmet often  to his mouth, taking advantage of the condition of his companions.    The state in which they then were was horrible to see; their lips only  uttered blasphemies, obscene expressions, and disconnected phrases; and  in the end sleep took possession of the greater part of them. Even the  look-out had abandoned his post, seeing that his comrades did not come  to relieve him, and as he was desirous of participating in their  libations and uproarious merriment.    It appeared to Martin that he heard the sound of the footsteps of horses  in the direction of the main road, and, turning in that direction, he  cried out--    \"The Salvadores! Up, comrades! the Salvadores!\"    Five or six of the bandits arose on hearing that cry, and, following the  example of Martin, hastened to mount their horses. Some of the others,  including the Raposo, were fast asleep, and the rest, having tried to  rise, fell back again on the ground.    The danger was imminent, the situation was desperate; the hill extended  in its entire length only about fifteen hundred paces, and was  surrounded on all sides by an extensive and bare plain. The only exit  from the wood was the path which led to the road, for the roughness of  the ground and the closeness of the trees and bushes made it impossible  for horses to proceed in any other direction. If Martin and his  companions abandoned their steeds, and hid themselves in the brushwood,  they would be very soon discovered; if they tried to go on foot across  the plain, they could easily be overtaken by the Salvadores, who were  mounted on swift horses. What course should then be adopted? This  question was asked him by the robbers, when the band of the Salvadores,  only about forty paces distant from them, was advancing in their  direction as quickly as the nature of the ground permitted.    \"Companions,\" said Martin, placing himself at their head, \"no other  resource remains for us but to break through them, sword in hand, and  endeavour to reach the plain, whether we are killed or not.\"    \"Yes, yes, forward!\" they all cried out, knowing that Martin had  indicated the only means of escape left for them, and they put spurs to  their horses. As that of Martin was the best, the least fatigued, and  the lightest, the young man preceded his comrades by a short distance,  and rushing, with sword in hand, into the midst of the Salvadores, he  unhorsed one of them with almost each stroke, and the others followed  him, and broke through their opponents, not less boldly and promptly. At  last they succeeded in gaining the main road, from whence they heard the  death-cries of those whom they had left in the wood, struck down by the  swords of the Salvadores; they then fled across the plain in the  direction of the mountains of Oca.    Martin had received several wounds, although none of them were serious,  and was losing much blood. After some time they arrived at a small hill,  surrounded by trees on all sides, and from which the surrounding country  could be seen for a considerable distance.    \"Brother, let us dismount here, that we may examine your wounds,\" said  his companions to Martin.    They at once dismounted, and all the bandits embraced Martin, calling  him their deliverer.    \"You shall be our captain,\" said one of them, \"for you are worth more  than a hundred like Raposo.\"    \"Yes, yes, you shall be our captain, brother. Long live our captain!\"  they all cried out unanimously and with enthusiasm.    \"I thank you, comrades,\" replied Martin; \"and I swear by those dogs of  Salvadores whom my good sword has sent to the other world, that I shall  prove myself worthy of the honour you confer on me. You have heard the  cries of agony of our companions, who have been cowardly butchered by  those fellows?\"    \"Yes, yes, we have heard them! Poor Captain Raposo!\"    \"Well, then, it is for us to avenge them. You do not yet know the name  of your new captain. I call myself the Vengador,[1] brothers. Let the  band, then, of the Vengador be as much feared as was that of the Raposo;  war to the death against the grandees who urged on the king to institute  the brotherhood of the Salvadores. At present we are weak, but in a  short time we shall be strong; we are persecuted to-day, to-morrow we  shall be protected everywhere, if you will only obey my orders and be  guided by my advice.\"    [1] Avenger.    \"We shall be your slaves, brother captain. You are skilful and brave, we  owe you our safety, and we trust in you to avenge our comrades.\"    \"Now listen, brothers,\" continued Martin; \"I wish to explain to you what  our conduct is to be from this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/420"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#17)"],[1,"'s surface, which meant home to them.  But when the  adventurers looked more carefully around them they discovered that  there were in a strong prison from which there was no hope of escape.    \"But we're ALMOST on earth again,\" cried Dorothy, \"for there is the  sun--the most BEAU'FUL sun that shines!\" and she pointed eagerly at the  crack in the distant roof.    \"Almost on earth isn't being there,\" said the kitten, in a discontented  tone.  \"It wouldn't be possible for even me to get up to that crack--or  through it if I got there.\"    \"It appears that the path ends here,\" announced the Wizard, gloomily.    \"And there is no way to go back,\" added Zeb, with a low whistle of  perplexity.    \"I was sure it would come to this, in the end,\" remarked the old  cab-horse.  \"Folks don't fall into the middle of the earth and then get  back again to tell of their adventures--not in real life.  And the  whole thing has been unnatural because that cat and I are both able to  talk your language, and to understand the words you say.\"    \"And so can the nine tiny piglets,\" added Eureka. \"Don't forget them,  for I may have to eat them, after all.\"    \"I've heard animals talk before,\" said Dorothy, \"and no harm came of  it.\"    \"Were you ever before shut up in a cave, far under the earth, with no  way of getting out?\" enquired the horse, seriously.    \"No,\" answered Dorothy.  \"But don't you lose heart, Jim, for I'm sure  this isn't the end of our story, by any means.\"    The reference to the piglets reminded the Wizard that his pets had not  enjoyed much exercise lately, and must be tired of their prison in his  pocket.  So he sat down upon the floor of the cave, brought the piglets  out one by one, and allowed them to run around as much as they pleased.    \"My dears,\" he said to them, \"I'm afraid I've got you into a lot of  trouble, and that you will never again be able to leave this gloomy  cave.\"    \"What's wrong?\" asked a piglet.  \"We've been in the dark quite a while,  and you may as well explain what has happened.\"    The Wizard told them of the misfortune that had overtaken the wanderers.    \"Well,\" said another piglet, \"you are a wizard, are you not?\"    \"I am,\" replied the little man.    \"Then you can do a few wizzes and get us out of this hole,\" declared  the tiny one, with much confidence.    \"I could if I happened to be a real wizard,\" returned the master sadly.  \"But I'm not, my piggy-wees; I'm a humbug wizard.\"    \"Nonsense!\" cried several of the piglets, together.    \"You can ask Dorothy,\" said the little man, in an injured tone.    \"It's true enough,\" returned the girl, earnestly.  \"Our friend Oz is  merely a humbug wizard, for he once proved it to me.  He can do several  very wonderful things--if he knows how.  But he can't wiz a single  thing if he hasn't the tools and machinery to work with.\"    \"Thank you, my dear, for doing me justice,\" responded the Wizard,  gratefully.  \"To be accused of being a real wizard, when I'm not, is a  slander I will not tamely submit to.  But I am one of the greatest  humbug wizards that ever lived, and you will realize this when we have  all starved together and our bones are scattered over the floor of this  lonely cave.\"    \"I don't believe we'll realize anything, when it comes to that,\"  remarked Dorothy, who had been deep in thought.  \"But I'm not going to  scatter my bones just yet, because I need them, and you prob'ly need  yours, too.\"    \"We are helpless to escape,\" sighed the Wizard.    \"WE may be helpless,\" answered Dorothy, smiling at him, \"but there are  others who can do more than we can.  Cheer up, friends.  I'm sure Ozma  will help us.\"    \"Ozma!\" exclaimed the Wizard.  \"Who is Ozma?\"    \"The girl that rules the marvelous Land of Oz,\" was the reply.  \"She's  a friend of mine, for I met her in the Land of Ev, not long ago, and  went to Oz with her.\"    \"For the second time?\" asked the Wizard, with great interest.    \"Yes.  The first time I went to Oz I found you there, ruling the  Emerald City.  After you went up in a balloon, and escaped us, I got  back to Kansas by means of a pair of magical silver shoes.\"    \"I remember those shoes,\" said the little man, nodding.  \"They once  belonged to the Wicked Witch.  Have you them here with you?\"    \"No; I lost them somewhere in the air,\" explained the child.  \"But the  second time I went to the Land of Oz I owned the Nome King's Magic  Belt, which is much more powerful than were the Silver Shoes.\"    \"Where is that Magic Belt?\" enquired the Wizard, who had listened with  great interest.    \"Ozma has it; for its powers won't work in a common, ordinary country  like the United States.  Anyone in a fairy country like the Land of Oz  can do anything with it; so I left it with my friend the Princess Ozma,  who used it to wish me in Australia with Uncle Henry.\"    \"And were you?\" asked Zeb, astonished at what he heard.    \"Of course; in just a jiffy.  And Ozma has an enchanted picture hanging  in her room that shows her the exact scene where any of her friends may  be, at any time she chooses.  All she has to do is to say: 'I wonder  what So-and-so is doing,' and at once the picture shows where her  friend is and what the friend is doing.  That's REAL magic, Mr. Wizard;  isn't it?  Well, every day at four o'clock Ozma has promised to look at  me in that picture, and if I am in need of help I am to make her a  certain sign and she will put on the Nome King's Magic Belt and wish me  to be with her in Oz.\"    \"Do you mean that Princess Ozma will see this cave in her enchanted  picture, and see all of us here, and what we are doing?\" demanded Zeb.    \"Of course; when it is four o'clock,\" she replied, with a laugh at his  startled expression.    \"And when you make a sign she will bring you to her in the Land of Oz?\"  continued the boy.    \"That's it, exactly; by means of the Magic Belt.\"    \"Then,\" said the Wizard, \"you will be saved, little Dorothy; and I am  very glad of it.  The rest of us will die much more cheerfully when we  know you have escaped our sad fate.\"    \"I won't die cheerfully!\" protested the kitten.  \"There's nothing  cheerful about dying that I could ever see, although they say a cat has  nine lives, and so must die nine times.\"    \"Have you ever died yet?\" enquired the boy.    \"No, and I'm not anxious to begin,\" said Eureka.    \"Don't worry, dear,\" Dorothy exclaimed, \"I'll hold you in my arms, and  take you with me.\"    \"Take us, too!\" cried the nine tiny piglets, all in one breath.    \"Perhaps I can,\" answered Dorothy.  \"I'll try.\"    \"Couldn't you manage to hold me in your arms?\" asked the cab-horse.    Dorothy laughed.    \"I'll do better than that,\" she promised, \"for I can easily save you  all, once I am myself in the Land of Oz.\"    \"How?\" they asked.    \"By using the Magic Belt.  All I need do is to wish you with me, and  there you'll be--safe in the royal palace!\"    \"Good!\" cried Zeb.    \"I built that palace, and the Emerald City, too,\" remarked the Wizard,  in a thoughtful tone, \"and I'd like to see them again, for I was very  happy among the Munchkins and Winkies and Quadlings and Gillikins.\"    \"Who are they?\" asked the boy.    \"The four nations that inhabit the Land of Oz,\" was the reply.  \"I  wonder if they would treat me nicely if I went there again.\"    \"Of course they would!\" declared Dorothy.  \"They are still proud of  their former Wizard, and often speak of you kindly.\"    \"Do you happen to know whatever became of the Tin Woodman and the  Scarecrow?\" he enquired.    \"They live in Oz yet,\" said the girl, \"and are very important people.\"    \"And the Cowardly Lion?\"    \"Oh, he lives there too, with his friend the Hungry Tiger; and Billina  is there, because she liked the place better than Kansas, and wouldn't  go with me to Australia.\"    \"I'm afraid I don't know the Hungry Tiger and Billina,\" said the  Wizard, shaking his head.  \"Is Billina a girl?\"    \"No; she's a yellow hen, and a great friend of mine.  You're sure to  like Billina, when you know her,\" asserted Dorothy.    \"Your friends sound like a menagerie,\" remarked Zeb, uneasily.  \"Couldn't you wish me in some safer place than Oz.\"    \"Don't worry,\" replied the girl.  \"You'll just love the folks in Oz,  when you get acquainted.  What time is it, Mr. Wizard?\"    The little man looked at his watch--a big silver one that he carried in  his vest pocket.    \"Half-past three,\" he said.    \"Then we must wait for half an hour,\" she continued; \"but it won't take  long, after that, to carry us all to the Emerald City.\"    They sat silently thinking for a time.  Then Jim suddenly asked:    \"Are there any horses in Oz?\"    \"Only one,\" replied Dorothy, \"and he's a sawhorse.\"    \"A what?\"    \"A sawhorse.  Princess Ozma once brought him to life with a  witch-powder, when she was a boy.\"    \"Was Ozma once a boy?\" asked Zeb, wonderingly.    \"Yes; a wicked witch enchanted her, so she could not rule her kingdom.  But she's a girl now, and the sweetest, loveliest girl in all the  world.\"    \"A sawhorse is a thing they saw boards on,\" remarked Jim, with a sniff.    \"It is when it's not alive,\" acknowledged the girl.  \"But this sawhorse  can trot as fast as you can, Jim; and he's very wise, too.\"    \"Pah!  I'll race the miserable wooden donkey any day in the week!\"  cried the cab-horse.    Dorothy did not reply to that.  She felt that Jim would know more about  the Saw-Horse later on.    The time dragged wearily enough to the eager watchers, but finally the  Wizard announced that four o'clock had arrived, and Dorothy caught up  the kitten and began to make the signal that had been agreed upon to  the far-away invisible Ozma.    \"Nothing seems to happen,\" said Zeb, doubtfully.    \"Oh, we must give Ozma time to put on the Magic Belt,\" replied the girl.    She had scarcely spoken the words then she suddenly disappeared from  the cave, and with her went the kitten.  There had been no sound of any  kind and no warning.  One moment Dorothy sat beside them with the "]]]
