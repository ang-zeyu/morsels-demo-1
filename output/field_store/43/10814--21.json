This however  was left to the two Americans, Orville and Wilbur Wright, who have  done more to advance the art of navigating the air than all the  other experimenters whose names we have used. The story of the  Wright brothers is one of boyhood interest gradually developed into  the passion of a lifetime. It parallels to some degree the story of  Santos-Dumont who insisting as a child that \"man flies\" finally made  it a fact. The interest of the Wrights was first stimulated when, in  1878, their father brought home a small toy, called a \"helicopter,\"  which when tossed in the air rose up instead of falling. Every child  had them at that time, but curiously this one was like the seed  which fell upon fertile soil. The boys went mad, as boys will, on  the subject of flying. But unlike most boys they nurtured and  cultivated the passion and it stayed with them to manhood. From  helicopters they passed to kites, and from kites to gliders. By  calling they were makers and repairers of bicycles, but their spare  time was for years devoted to solving the problem of flight. In time  it became their sole occupation and by it they won a fortune and  world-wide fame. Their story forms a remarkable testimony to the  part of imagination, pertinacity, and courage in winning success.  After years of tests with models, and with kites controlled from the  ground, the brothers had worked out a type of glider which they  believed, in a wind of from eighteen to twenty miles an hour, would  lift and carry a man. But they had to find a testing ground. The  fields near their home in Ohio were too level, and their firm  unyielding surface was not attractive as a cushion on which to light  in the event of disaster. Moreover the people round about were  getting inquisitive about these grown men \"fooling around\" with  kites and flying toys. To the last the Wrights were noted for their  dislike of publicity, and it is entirely probable that the sneering  criticisms of their \"level headed\" and \"practical\" neighbours had a  good deal to do with rooting them in this distaste.    Low steep hills down the sides of which they could run and at the  proper moment throw themselves upon their glider; a sandy soil which  would at least lessen the shock of a tumble; and a vicinage in which  winds of eighteen miles an hour or more is the normal atmospheric  state were the conditions they sought. These they found at a little  hamlet called Kitty-Hawk on the coast of North Carolina. There for  uncounted centuries the tossing Atlantic had been throwing up its  snowy sand upon the shore, and the steady wind had caught it up,  piled it in windrows, rolled it up into towering hills, or carried  it over into the dunes which extended far inland. It was a lonely  spot, and there secure from observation the Wrights pitched their  camp. For them it was a midsummer's holiday. Not at first did they  decide to make aviation not a sport but a profession. To their camp  came visitors interested in the same study, among them Chanute, a  well-known experimenter, and some of his associates. They had  thought to give hours at a time to actual flight. When they closed  their first season, they found that all their time spent in actual  flight footed up less than an hour. Lilienthal, despite all he  accomplished, estimated that he, up to a short time before his  death, spent only about five hours actually in the air. In that  early day of experimentation a glide covering one hundred feet, and  consuming eight or ten seconds, was counted a triumph.    [Illustration: Chanute's Glider.]    But the season was by no means wasted. Indeed such was the estimate  that the Wrights put upon it that they folded their tents determined  that when they returned the year following it would be as  professionals, not amateurs. They were confident of their ability to  build machines that would fly, though up to that time they had never  mounted a motor on their aircraft.    In the clear hot air of a North Carolina midsummer the Wrights used  to lie on their backs studying through glasses the methods of flight  of the great buzzards--filthy scavenger birds which none the less  soaring high aloft against a blue sky are pictures of dignity and  grace.         Bald eagles, ospreys, hawks, and buzzards give us daily       exhibitions of their powers [wrote Wilbur Wright]. The buzzards       were the most numerous, and were the most persistent soarers.       They apparently never flapped except when it was absolutely       necessary, while the eagles and hawks usually soared only when       they were at leisure. Two methods of soaring were employed. When       the weather was cold and damp and the wind strong the buzzards       would be seen soaring back and forth along the hills or at the       edge of a clump of trees. They were evidently taking advantage of       the current of air flowing upward over these obstructions. On       such days they were often utterly unable to soar, except in these       special places. But on warm clear days when the wind was light       they would be seen high in the air soaring in great circles.       Usually, however, it seemed to be necessary to reach a height of       several hundred feet by flapping before this style of soaring       became possible. Frequently a great number of them would begin       circling in one spot, rising together higher and higher till       finally they would disperse, each gliding off in whatever       direction it wished to go. At such times other buzzards only a       short distance away found it necessary to flap frequently in       order to maintain themselves. But when they reached a point       beneath the circling flock they began to rise on motionless       wings. This seemed to indicate that rising columns of air do not       exist everywhere, but that the birds must find them. They       evidently watch each other and when one finds a rising current       the others quickly make their way to it. One day when scarce a       breath of wind was stirring on the ground we noticed two bald       eagles sailing in circling sweeps at a height of probably five       hundred feet. After a time our attention was attracted to the       flashing of some object considerably lower down. Examination with       a field-glass proved it to be a feather which one of the birds       had evidently cast. As it seemed apparent that it would come to       earth only a short distance away, some of our party started to       get it. But in a little while it was noted that the feather was       no longer falling, but on the contrary was rising rapidly. It       finally went out of sight upward. It apparently was drawn into       the same current in which the eagles were soaring and was carried       up like the birds.    It was by such painstaking methods as these, coupled with the  mathematical reduction of the fruits of such observations to terms  of angles and supporting planes, that the Wrights gradually  perfected their machine. The first airplane to which they fitted a  motor and which actually flew has been widely exhibited in the  United States, and is to find final repose in some public museum.  Study it as you will you can find little resemblance in those  rectangular rigid planes to the wings of a bird. But it was built  according to deductions drawn from natural flight.    [Illustration: Photo by Paul Thompson.    _A German Taube Pursued by British Planes._]    The method of progress in these preliminary experiments was, by  repeated tests, to determine what form of airplane, and of what  proportions, would best support a man. It was evident that for free  and continuous flight it must be able to carry not only the pilot,  but an engine and a store of fuel as well. Having, as they thought,  determined these conditions the Wrights essayed their first flight  at their home near Dayton, Ohio. It was a cold December day in 1903.  The first flight, with motor and all, lasted twelve seconds; the  fourth fifty-nine seconds. The handful of people who came out to  witness the marvel went home jeering. In the spring of the next year  a new flight was announced near Dayton. The newspapers had been  asked to send reporters. A crowd of perhaps fifty persons had  gathered. Again fate was hostile. The engine worked badly and the  airplane refused to rise. The crowd dispersed and the newspapermen,  returning the next day, met only with another disappointment.    [Illustration: The First Wright Glider.]    These repeated failures in public exhibitions resulted in creating  general indifference to the real progress that the Wrights were  making in solving the flight problem. While the gliding experiments  at Kitty-Hawk were furnishing the data for the plans on which the  tens of thousands of airplanes used in the European war were  afterwards built, no American newspaper was sufficiently interested  to send representatives to the spot. The people of the United States  were supremely indifferent. Perhaps this was due to the fact that  superficially regarded the machine the Wrights were trying to  perfect gave promise of usefulness only in war or in sport. We are  not either a warlike or a sporting people. Ready enough to adopt a  new device which seems adapted for utilitarian purposes, as is shown  by the rapid multiplication of automobiles, we leave sport to our  professional ball players, and our military equipment to luck.    [Illustration: Pilcher's Glider.]    So after continued experimental flights in the open fields near  Dayton had convinced them that the practical weaknesses in their  machine had been eliminated, the Wrights packed up their flyer and  went to France. Before so doing they tried to get encouragement from  the United States Government, but failed. Neither the government nor  any rich American was willing to share the cost of further  experiments. All that had been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3005"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Airship (#17)"],[1,"Tom, who was peering ahead, with his hand on the steering  wheel, cried out \"I say! It looks as if we were going to run into a  thunder storm!\"    \"How's that?\" inquired Mr. Sharp, poking his head from the motor  compartment.    \"He says there's a big storm ahead,\" repeated Mr. Damon, \"and I guess  he's right. I see a big bank of dark clouds, and there is a roaring in  the air.\"    Mr. Sharp, who had been making some adjustments to the motor went  forward to take a look. The Red Cloud was swiftly gliding downward on a  slant, straight toward a dark mass of vapor, that seemed to be rolling  first one way, and then another, while as Mr. Damon had said, there was  a low rumbling proceeding from it.    \"That doesn't seem to be a thunder storm,\" spoke the balloonist, with a  puzzled air.    They all regarded the dark mass of vapor intently for a few seconds.  Tom had brought the airship to a more level keel, and it was now  spinning along under its own momentum, like a flat piece of tin, scaled  by some lead. But it was headed for the clouds, if such they were,  though losing speed by degrees.    \"I'll have to start the motor!\" exclaimed Mr. Sharp. \"We don't want to  run into a storm, if we can help it, though I don't ever remember  seeing a thunder disturbance like that.\"    \"Whew! It's getting warm,\" suddenly announced the youth, and he let go  of the steering wheel for a moment, while he took off his coat.    \"That's what it is,\" agreed Mr. Damon, who also divested himself of his  garments. \"Bless my spark plug, but it's like a July day. No wonder  there's a thunderstorm ahead.\"    Then Mr. Sharp uttered a cry. \"That's no storm!\" he fairly shouted.  \"It's a big forest fire! That's smoke we see! We must get out of this.  Turn around Tom, while I start the engine. We must rise above it!\"    He fairly leaped for the motor, and Tom and Mr. Damon could hear him  turning the levers and wheels, ready to start. But before the  explosions came something happened. There was a sound as of some great,  siren whistle blowing, and then, with a howl of the on rushing air, the  Red Cloud, the propellers of which hung motionless on their shafts, was  fairly sucked forward toward the fire, as the current sucks a boat over  a water fall.    \"Start the motor! Start the motor, Mr. Sharp!\" cried Tom.    \"I'm trying to, but something seems to be the matter.\"    \"We're being drawn right over the fire!\" yelled Mr. Damon. \"It's  getting hotter every minute! Can't you do something?\"    \"You take the wheel,\" called the balloonist to Mr. Damon. \"Steer  around, just as if it was an auto when we start the engine. Tom, come  here and give me a hand. The motor has jammed!\"    The young inventor sprang to obey. Mr. Damon, his face showing some of  the fear he felt, grasped the steering wheel. The airship was now about  a quarter of a mile high, but instead of resting motionless in the air,  sustained by the gas in the container, she was being pulled forward,  right toward the heart of the mass of black vapor, which it could now  be seen was streaked with bright tongues of flame.    \"What's making us go ahead, if the motor isn't going?\" asked Tom, as he  bent over the machine, at which the aeronaut was laboring.    \"Suction--draught from the fire!\" explained Mr. Sharp. \"Heated air  rises and leaves a vacuum. The cold air rushes in. It's carrying us  with it. We'll be right in the fire in a few minutes, if we can't get  started with this motor! I don't see what ails it.\"    \"Can't we steer to one side, as it is?\"    \"No. We're right in a powerful current of air, and steering won't do  any good, until we have some motion of our own. Turn the gasolene lever  on a little more, and see if you can get a spark.\"    Tom did so, but no explosion resulted. The twenty cylinders of the big  engine remained mute. The airship, meanwhile, was gathering speed,  sucked onward and downward as it was by the draught from the fire. The  roaring was plainer now, and the crackling of the flames could be heard  plainly. The heat, too, grew more intense.    Frantically Tom and Mr. Sharp labored over the motor. With the  perverseness usual to gas engines, it had refused to work at a critical  moment.    \"What shall I do?\" cried Mr. Damon from his position in the pilot  house. \"We seem to be heading right for the midst of it?\"    \"Slant the elevation rudder,\" called Tom. \"Send the ship up. It will be  cooler the higher we go. Maybe we can float over it!\"    \"You'd better go out there,\" advised Mr. Sharp. \"I'll keep at this  motor. Go up as high as you can. Turn on more gas. That will elevate  us, but maybe not quick enough. The gas doesn't generate well in great  heat. I'm afraid we're in for it,\" he added grimly.    Tom sprang to relieve Mr. Damon. The heat was now intense. Nearer and  nearer came the Red Cloud to the blazing forest, which seemed to cover  several square miles. Great masses of smoke, with huge pieces of  charred and blazing wood carried up by the great draught, circled  around the ship. The Red Cloud was being pulled into the midst of the  fire by the strong suction. Tom yanked over the elevation rudder, and  the nose of the craft pointed upward. But it still moved downward, and,  a moment later the travelers of the air felt as if they were over a  fiery furnace.          Chapter 17    \"Wanted For Robbery!\"      Choking and gasping for breath, feeling as if they could not stand the  intense heat more than a moment longer, the young inventor and his  companions looked at each other. Death seemed ready to reach out and  grasp them. The mass of heated air was so powerful that it swung and  tossed the Red Cloud about as if it were a wisp of paper.    \"We must do something!\" cried Mr. Damon, beginning to take off his  collar and vest. \"I'm choking!\"    \"Lie down in the bottom of the car,\" suggested Mr. Sharp. \"The smoke  won't trouble you so much there.\"    The eccentric man, too startled, now, to use any of his \"blessing\"  expressions, did so.    \"Can't you start the motor?\" asked Tom frantically, as he stuck to his  post, with his hand on the steering wheel, the elevation lever jammed  back as far as it would go.    \"I've done my best,\" answered the balloonist, gasping as he swallowed  some smoke. \"I'm afraid--afraid it's all up with us. We should have  steered clear of this from the first. My, how it roars!\"    The crackling and snapping of the flames below them, as they fed on the  dry wood, which no rain had wet for weeks, was like the rush of some  great cataract. Up swirled the dark smoke-clouds, growing hotter and  hotter all the while as the craft came nearer and nearer to the center  of the conflagration.    \"We must rise higher!\" cried Tom. \"It's our only chance. Turn on the  gas machine full power, and fill the container. That will carry us up!\"    \"Yes, it's our only hope,\" muttered Mr. Sharp. \"We must go up, but the  trouble is the gas doesn't generate so fast when there's too much heat.  We're bound to have to stay over this fiery pit for some time yet.\"    \"We're going up a little!\" spoke Tom hopefully, as he glanced at a  gauge near him. \"We're fifteen hundred feet now, and we were only  twelve a while ago.\"    \"Good! Keep the elevation rudder as it is, and I'll see what I can do  with the gas,\" advised the balloonist. \"It's our only hope,\" and he  hurried into the engine room, which, like the other parts of the cabin,  was now murky with choking vapor and soot.    Suddenly the elevation gauge showed that they were falling. The airship  was going down.    \"What's the matter?\" called Mr. Damon, from the cabin floor.    \"I don't know,\" answered Tom, \"unless the rudder has broken.\"    He peered through the haze. No, the big elevation rudder was still in  place, but it seemed to have no effect on the shim.    \"It's a down draught!\" cried Mr. Sharp. \"We're being sucked down. It  won't last but a few seconds. I've been in 'em before.\"    He seemed to have guessed rightly, for, the next instant the airship  was shooting upward again, and relief came to the aeronauts, though it  was not much, for the heat was almost unbearable, and they had taken  off nearly all their clothing.    \"Lighten ship!\" sung out Mr. Sharp. \"Toss over all the things you think  we can spare, Tom. Some of the cases of provisions--we can get more--if  we need 'em. We must rise, and the gas isn't generating fast enough!\"    There was no need for the young inventor at the steering wheel now, for  the craft simply could not be guided. It was swirled about, now this  way, now that, by the currents of heated air. At times it would rise a  considerable distance, only to be pulled down again, and, just before  Tom began to toss overboard some boxes of food, it seemed that the end  had come, for the craft went down so low that the upward leaping  tongues of flame almost reached the lower frame.    \"I'll help you,\" gasped Mr. Damon, and while he and Tom tossed from the  cabin windows some of their stores, Mr. Sharp was frantically  endeavoring to make the gas generate faster.    It was slow work, but with the lightening of the ship their situation  improved. Slowly, so slowly that it seemed an age, the elevation  pointer went higher and higher on the dial.    \"Sixteen hundred feet!\" sung out Tom, pausing for a look at the gauge.  \"That's the best yet!\"    The heat was felt less, now, and every minute was improving their  situation. Slowly the hand moved. The gas was being made in larger  quantities now that the heat was less. Ten minutes more of agony, and  their danger was over. They were still above the burning area, but  sufficiently high so that only stray wisps of smoke enveloped them.    \"Whew! But that was the worst ever!\" cried Tom, as he sank exhausted on  a bench, and wiped his perspiring face. \"We sure were in a bad way!\"    \"I should say so,\" agreed Mr. Sharp. \"And if we don't get a breeze we  may have to stay here for some time.\"    \"Why, can't you get that motor to work"]]]
