The detective also left his uncomfortable post, and crouching in  a doorway, waited for Gypsy and her companion to get out, with the  intention of following closely upon their heels.    Five minutes passed, and still there were no signs of them.    \"What can they be doing all this time?\" grumbled the detective.    With great precautions, he approached the cab, and peeped in.    Oh, cruel deception! it was empty!    Fanferlot felt as if someone had thrown a bucket of ice-water over him;  he remained rooted to the spot with his mouth stretched, the picture of  blank bewilderment.    He soon recovered his wits sufficiently to burst forth in a volley of  oaths, loud enough to rattle all the window-panes in the neighborhood.    \"Tricked!\" he said, \"fooled! Ah! but won't I make them pay for this!\"    In a moment his quick mind had run over the gamut of possibilities,  probable and improbable.    \"Evidently,\" he muttered, \"this fellow and Gypsy entered one door, and  got out of the other; the trick is simple enough. If they resorted  to it, 'tis because they feared being watched. If they feared being  watched, they have uneasy consciences: therefore--\"    He suddenly interrupted his monologue as the idea struck him that he had  better attempt to find out something from the driver.    Unfortunately, the driver was in a very surly mood, and not only refused  to answer, but shook his whip in so threatening a manner that Fanferlot  deemed it prudent to beat a retreat.    \"Oh, Lord,\" he muttered, \"perhaps he and the driver are one and the  same!\"    But what could he do now, at this time of night? He could not imagine.  He walked dejectedly back to the quay, and it was half-past eleven when  he reached his own door.    \"Has the little fool returned?\" he inquired of Mme. Alexandre, the  instant she opened the door for him.    \"No; but here are two large bundles which have come for her.\"    Fanferlot hastily opened the bundles.    They contained three calico dresses, some coarse shoes, and some linen  caps.    \"Well,\" said the detective in a vexed tone, \"now she is going to  disguise herself. Upon my word, I am getting puzzled! What can she be up  to?\"    When Fanferlot was sulkily walking down the Faubourg St. Martin, he  had fully made up his mind that he would not tell his wife of his  discomfiture.    But once at home, confronted with a new fact of a nature to negative all  his conjectures, his vanity disappeared. He confessed everything--his  hopes so nearly realized, his strange mischance, and his suspicions.    They talked the matter over, and finally decided that they would not  go to bed until Mme. Gypsy, from whom Mme. Alexandre was determined to  obtain an explanation of what had happened, returned. At one o'clock the  worthy couple were about giving over all hope of her re-appearance, when  they heard the bell ring.    Fanferlot instantly slipped into the closet, and Mme. Alexandre remained  in the office to received Gypsy.    \"Here you are at last, my dear child!\" she cried. \"Oh, I have been so  uneasy, so afraid lest some misfortune had happened!\"    \"Thanks for your kind interest, madame. Has a bundle been sent here for  me?\"    Poor Gypsy's appearance had strikingly changed; she was very sad, but  not as before dejected. To her melancholy of the last few days, had  succeeded a firm and generous resolution, which was betrayed in her  sparkling eyes and resolute step.    \"Yes, two bundles came for you; here they are. I suppose you saw M.  Bertomy's friend?\"    \"Yes, madame; and his advice has so changed my plans, that, I regret to  say, I must leave you to-morrow.\"    \"Going away to-morrow! then something must have happened.\"    \"Oh! nothing that would interest you, madame.\"    After lighting her candle at the gas-burner, Mme. Gypsy said  \"Good-night\" in a very significant way, and left the room.    \"And what do you think of that, Mme. Alexandre?\" questioned Fanferlot,  emerging from his hiding-place.    \"It is incredible! This girl writes to M. de Clameran to meet her here,  and then does not wait for him.\"    \"She evidently mistrusts us; she knows who I am.\"    \"Then this friend of the cashier must have told her.\"    \"Nobody knows who told her. I shall end by believing that I am among  a gang of thieves. They think I am on their track, and are trying to  escape me. I should not be at all surprised if this little rogue has the  money herself, and intends to run off with it to-morrow.\"    \"That is not my opinion; but listen to me: you had better take my  advice, and consult M. Lecoq.\"    Fanferlot meditated awhile, then exclaimed.    \"Very well; I will see him, just for your satisfaction; because I  know that, if I have discovered nothing, neither has he. But, if  he undertakes to be domineering, it won't do; for, if he shows his  insolence to me, _I_ will make him know his place!\"    Notwithstanding this brave speech, the detective passed an uneasy night,  and at six o'clock the next morning he was up--it was necessary to rise  very early if he wished to catch M. Lecoq at home--and, refreshed by a  cup of strong coffee, he directed his steps toward the dwelling of the  celebrated detective.    Fanferlot the Squirrel certainly was not afraid of his patron, as he  called him; for he started out with his nose in the air, and his hat  cocked on one side.    But by the time he reached the Rue Montmartre, where M. Lecoq lived,  his courage had vanished; he pulled his hat over his eyes, and hung  his head, as if looking for relief among the paving-stones. He slowly  ascended the steps, pausing several times, and looking around as if he  would like to fly.    Finally he reached the third floor, and stood before a door decorated  with the arms of the famous detective--a cock, the symbol of  vigilance--and his heart failed him so that he had scarcely the courage  to ring the bell.    The door was opened by Janouille, M. Lecoq's old servant, who had very  much the manner and appearance of a grenadier. She was as faithful to  her master as a watch-dog, and always stood ready to attack anyone who  did not treat him with the august respect which she considered his due.    \"Well, M. Fanferlot,\" she said, \"you come in time for once in your life.  Your patron wants to see you.\"    Upon this announcement, Fanferlot was seized with a violent desire to  retreat. By what chance could Lecoq want anything of him?    While he thus hesitated, Janouille seized him by the arm, and pulled him  in, saying:    \"Do you want to take root there? Come along, your patron is waiting for  you.\"    In the middle of a large room curiously furnished, half library and half  green-room, was seated at a desk the same person with gold spectacles,  who had said to Prosper at the police-office, \"Have courage.\"    This was M. Lecoq in his official character.    Upon Fanferlot's entrance, as he advanced respectfully, bowing till  his backbone was a perfect curve, M. Lecoq laid down his pen, and said,  looking sharply at him:    \"Ah, here you are, young man. Well, it seems that you haven't made much  progress in the Bertomy case.\"    \"Why,\" murmured Fanferlot, \"you know--\"    \"I know that you have muddled everything until you can't see your way  out; so that you are ready to give up.\"    \"But, M. Lecoq, it was not I----\"    M. Lecoq arose, and walked up and down the room: suddenly he confronted  Fanferlot, and said, in a tone of scornful irony:    \"What would you think, Master Squirrel, of a man who abuses the  confidence of those who employ him, who reveals just enough to lead the  prosecution on the wrong scent, who sacrifices to his own foolish vanity  the cause of justice and the liberty of an unfortunate man?\"    Fanferlot started back with a frightened look.    \"I should say,\" he stammered, \"I should say--\"    \"You would say this man ought to be punished, and dismissed from his  employment; and you are right. The less a profession is honored, the  more honorable should those be who belong to it. And yet you have been  false to yours. Ah! Master Fanferlot, we are ambitious, and we try to  make the police force serve our own views! We let Justice stray her way,  and we go ours. One must be a more cunning bloodhound than you are, my  friend, to be able to hunt without a huntsman. You are too self-reliant  by half.\"    \"But, patron, I swear--\"    \"Silence! Do you pretend to say that you did your duty, and told all  to the judge of instruction? Whilst others were informing against the  cashier, you undertook to inform against the banker. You watched his  movements: you became intimate with his valet.\"    Was M. Lecoq really angry, or pretending to be? Fanferlot, who knew him  well, was puzzled to know whether all this indignation was real.    \"If you were only skilful,\" he continued, \"but no: you wish to be  master, and you are not fit to be a journeyman.\"    \"You are right, patron,\" said Fanferlot, piteously, for he saw that  it was useless for him to deny anything. \"But how could I go about an  affair like this, where there was not even a trace or sign to start  from?\"    M. Lecoq shrugged his shoulders.    \"You are an ass! Why, don't you know that on the very day you were sent  for with the commissary to verify the robbery, you held--I do not say  certainly, but very probably held--in your great stupid hands the means  of knowing which key had been used when the money was stolen?\"    \"How! What!\"    \"You want to know, do you? I will tell you. Do you remember the scratch  you discovered on the safe-door? You were so struck by it, that you  exclaimed directly you saw it. You carefully examined it, and were  convinced that it was a fresh scratch, only a few hours old. You  thought, and rightly too, that this scratch was made at the time of the  theft. Now, with what was it made? Evidently with a key. That being  the case, you should have asked for the keys both of the banker and the  cashier.

[Illustration: HUDSONIAN CURLEW         LONG-BILLED CURLEW                   (Numenius hudsonicus)    (Numenius longirostris)]      THE LONG-BILLED CURLEW    (Numenius longirostris)    The long-billed curlew, or sickle bill as it is often called, is a  plentiful resident in all suitable localities. The young birds mature  early and find their way to the marshes during August, when the season  for their killing should begin. At this time and even during the month  of September they are quite palatable, but later they become strong in  flavor. In these months they feed largely upon the seeds and insects  to be found on the plains, but later they confine themselves  principally to the marshes. They breed near the mountain lakes and  streams and even to considerable extent on the lower grounds. A glance  at the accompanying illustration will be sufficient to enable the  uninitiated to always know a curlew.    =Color=--Head, back of neck and back, dark brown, mottled with buff;  throat and under parts, pale buff, the feathers on the breast being  streaked with brown; axillars, reddish brown.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is usually made on the ground in tall grass  and back some distance from the marsh. The eggs are about four and of  an olive gray, spotted with brown.    =Measurements=--Total length, without the bill, which varies very  much, about 20 inches; wing, 9 to 11; bill, from four to eight inches,  and bent downwards, with nearly as much curve as a sickle; in most  specimens the bill will be about six inches in length.      THE HUDSONIAN CURLEW    (Numenius hudsonicus)    The Hudsonian curlew, or jack curlew, by which name it is also known,  is also a common visitor to our hunting grounds. It is often seen  mixed with flocks of the preceding species, which leads many to  suppose that they are the younger birds of that species. Unlike the  long-billed, the Hudsonian curlew is not a resident species, or, at  least, not to so great an extent, although it makes its appearance on  our marshes quite early in the season, even as far south as central  California. In markings the two species are almost identical, with the  exception that the Hudsonian is somewhat paler in shade. Any doubt  arising as to which species a specimen may belong can easily be  settled by an examination of the axillar plumes. If a long-bill, these  feathers will be a solid reddish-brown, but if a Hudsonian, they will  be of a pale buff color barred with a dull-brown, the buff and brown  being nearly of the same width. Both species become less common north  of southern California during the late winter months.    =Color=--Same as the long-billed curlew, except that it is a little  paler on the under parts, and the mottling shows more distinctly on  the back. The axillars are pale buff, distinctly barred with light  brown.    =Nest and Eggs=--The same as the long-billed curlew.    =Measurements=--Total length, including bill, which varies but little  in this species, about 17 inches; wing, 9, and bill about 3-1/2 inches.        [Illustration: BLACK-BELLIED PLOVER (Charadrius squatarola)]      BLACK-BELLIED PLOVER    (Charadrous squaterola)    The largest of the family =Charadridae= is the black-bellied plover. In  its plumage, both summer and winter, it closely resembles the golden  plover, as the black on the sides of the head, front of neck, breast  and abdomen disappear from both species in their winter plumage. But,  notwithstanding this, they can easily be distinguished by the small  rudimentary hind toe of the black-bellied species, the other having  but three toes. A few specimens of the golden plover have been taken  on the Coast, but it is of rare occurrence. The black-bellied plover  is reasonably common along the coast line, but it is not seen to any  great extent in the interior valleys.    =Color=--Upper plumage, dull brown, mottled with gray, the top of the  head being somewhat darker; under parts, nearly white and the sides  and breast streaked with brown. In the summer the throat and belly are  black.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is usually made on the uplands, where four  eggs are deposited of a pale olive, spotted with brown.    =Measurements=--Total length, 11 inches; wing, 7-1/2, and bill,  1-1/4 inches.        [Illustration:        SNOWY PLOVER       MOUNTAIN PLOVER      RING-NECK PLOVER       (AEgialitis nivosa)  (AEgialitis montana)  (AEgialitis semipalmata)]      THE MOUNTAIN PLOVER    (AEgialitis montana)    The mountain plover is very plentiful on the plains of southern  California during the winter months. This little bird as a table  delicacy is not surpassed by any of the long list of shore birds. In  fact it is preferred by many to the far-famed jack snipe. It is an  upland bird, feeding largely on insects, and rarely found near the  marshes whether salt or fresh-water. In its winter plumage, as seen  here, its underparts are white with the breast and upper parts of a  brownish gray.    =Color=--Throat, breast and under parts, white; the rest of the  plumage, light buffish gray; sometimes the breast will show a slight  tinge of buff; axillars, white; bill, black. Three toes without web.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nests are placed on the uplands and contain three  grayish eggs, spotted with brown.    =Measurements=--Total length, 8-3/4 inches; wing, 6, and  bill, 9/10 of an inch.      THE SNOWY PLOVER    (AEgialitis nivosa)    The snowy plover is quite common from northern California to Mexico.  It is a small bird and, while it is hunted but little, its flesh is  quite delicate. In its winter plumage it is much lighter in color  than any of the others named.    =Color=--Top of head, back of neck and back, buffish gray; forehead  and under parts, white; a patch of dull brown just above the white of  the forehead, and another of the same color on each side of the  throat. Three toes without web.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nests are found throughout its range; they are  nothing more than a depression in the sand and contain four grayish  buff eggs, spotted with black.    =Measurements=--Total length, about 6-3/4 inches; wing, 4-1/4, and bill  5/8 of an inch.      THE RING-NECKED PLOVER    (AEgialitis semipalmata)    The ring-neck plover is a fairly common visitor during the winter  months. It is usually seen on the coast or on other sandy shores. It  may be known by its partially webbed feet.    =Color=--Forehead, chin and neck, white, with a faint streak of dull  brown from the bill under the eye to the back of the neck; a band of  dull, brownish gray on the breast; back and wings, ashy gray; under  parts, white; bill, black with a spot of orange at the base. Three  toes which are webbed for about half their length.    =Nest and Eggs=--Nests are made in the sand and contain from three to  four dirty white eggs, spotted with brown. =Measurements=--Total  length, 6-3/4 inches; wing, 4-3/4, and bill, 1/2 inch.      WILSON'S PLOVER    (AEgialitis wilsonia)    While the Wilson plover is found to some extent on the southern  Atlantic Coast, it may properly be said to be a Pacific species. Here  it is seen on the beaches in large numbers, just beyond the reach of  the surf, picking the insects and minute shellfish as they are washed  on the sand, or flying in flocks just above the breakers.    =Color=--Forehead and stripe over the eye, white; black stripe in  front of crown; top of head and stripe from the eye to the bill,  black; black band just below the throat; back, gray; under parts,  white; bill black, and legs and feet, light pink.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is a mere depression in the ground, with  three to four eggs of a pale olive, spotted with dark brown.    =Measurements=--Total length, 7 to 8 inches; wing, 4 to 5; bill, about  3/4 of an inch. Three toes with a small    [Note: Unfinished sentence in original printed version.]    There are a number of other plovers on the hunting grounds of the  Pacific Coast, but they are either too small or the flesh too poor to  interest the sportsman. Of these the killdeer plover is the most  common and the best known. A description of these would be of no  interest to the sportsman and therefore add nothing to the purposes of  this work.        [Illustration: AMERICAN AVOCET (Recurvirostra americana)]      THE AVOCET    (Recurvirostra americana)    The family =Recurvirostridae= has but two representatives on the Coast.  The American avocet breeds from Washington southward and spends its  winters from central California south. They are quite plentiful in  southern California during the winter months, increasing in numbers in  Lower California and Mexico. Its webbed feet and long upward turned  bill are features by which it may always be known. It is generally  found in flocks and frequents both fresh and salt-waters.    =Color=--Head and neck, ashy gray; back and under parts, white; the  primaries and upper half of the secondaries,"]]]
