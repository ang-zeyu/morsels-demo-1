[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38253"],[0,"A Description of the Coasts of East Africa and Malabar in the Beginning of the (#17)"],[1," passing this  mountain range, the country is almost entirely plain, very fertile  and abundantly supplied in the inland districts, which belong to the  kingdom of Narsinga, in which there are many cities and villages and  forts, and many large rivers run through it. There is in this  country much cultivation of rice and other vegetables, with which  they maintain themselves, and many cows, buffaloes, pigs, goats,  sheep, asses, and diminutive ponies, all of which they make use of;  and they carry their goods by means of buffaloes, oxen, asses, and  ponies, and do their field work with them. Almost all the villages  are of Gentiles, and among them are a few Moors; some of the lords  of these villages are of these last, to whom the king of Narsinga  has granted the villages, and others are his, and he keeps his  governors and tax collectors in them.      BIJANAGUER.    Forty-five leagues from these mountains inland, there is a very  large city which is called Bijanaguer, very populous and surrounded  on one side by a very good wall, and on another by a river, and on  the other by a mountain. This city is on level ground, the King of  Narsinga always resides in it. He is a Gentile and is called Raheni:  he has in this place very large and handsome palaces, with numerous  courts in which are many mounds, pools of water with plenty of fish,  gardens of shrubs, flowers, and sweet-smelling herbs. There are also  in the city many other palaces of great lords who live there. And  all the other houses of the place are covered with thatch, and the  streets and squares are very wide: they are constantly filled with  an innumerable crowd of all nations and creeds; for, besides many  Moorish merchants and traders, and the Gentile inhabitants of the  country who are very rich, an infinite number of others flock there  from all parts, who are able to come, dwell, trade, and live very  freely and in security, without anyone molesting them, or asking or  requiring of them any account of whence they come, or in what creed  they live, whether they be Moors, Christians, or Gentiles; and each  one may live according to any creed, or as he pleases. There is an  infinite trade in this city, and strict justice and truth are  observed towards all by the governors of the country. In this city  there are very many jewels which are brought from Pegu and Celani,  and in the country itself many diamonds are found, because there is  a mine of them in the kingdom of Narsinga and another in the kingdom  of Dacani. There are also many pearls and seed-pearls to be found  there, which are brought from Ormus and Cael; and all these jewels  and pearls are much esteemed among them, because they adorn  themselves much with them, and on that account a great quantity are  poured in. In this city they wear many silks and inferior brocades,  which are brought from China and Alexandria, and much scarlet cloth,  and of other colours, and much coral worked into round beads; and  they import copper, quicksilver, vermilion, saffron, rose-water, much  anfiani which is opium, sandal and aloes wood, camphor, musk,  because the inhabitants of this country are much in the habit of  anointing themselves with these perfumes.    There is also a great consumption in this place, and in the whole  kingdom, of pepper, which is brought from Malabar on oxen and asses.  The money is of gold, and is called parda, and is worth three  hundred maravedis;[179] it is coined in certain cities of this  kingdom of Narsinga, and throughout all India they use this money,  which passes in all those kingdoms; its gold is a little inferior.  This coin is round, and made in a mould. Some of them have some  Indian letters on one side, and two figures on the other of a man  and a woman, and others have nothing but the lettering on one side.      CUSTOMS OF THIS KINGDOM OF NARSINGA AND OF ITS INHABITANTS.    This king constantly resides in the before-mentioned palaces, and  very seldom goes out of them: he lives very luxuriously and without  any labour, because he discharges it all upon his governors. He and  all the dwellers in this city are Gentiles, coloured men and nearly  white, of long and very smooth black hair; they are well  proportioned men, of features and ----[180] similar to our own, and  so likewise are the women. The costume of the men is from the waist  downwards with many folds and very tight, and a short shirt which  reaches half way down the thigh, made of white cotton stuff, silk,  or brocade, open down the front, small caps on their heads, and the  hair gathered up on the top, some caps of silk or brocade, and their  sandals on their bare feet, cloaks of cotton stuff or silk on their  arms, and their pages with their swords behind them, and their  bodies anointed with white sandal, aloes-wood, camphor, musk, and  saffron; all ground together with rose-water. They bathe every day,  and after bathing, anoint themselves. They wear small gold chains  and jewels round their necks, and bracelets on their arms, and rings  on their fingers of very valuable jewels, and also many jewels in  their ears of pearls and precious stones. And they take a second  page who carries for them a slender canopy with a long handle with  which to shade them and protect them from the rain. These shades are  of silk stuff, much ornamented with gold fringes, and some of them  have jewels and seed-pearls, and made in such a manner that they  shut up and open; and some of these cost three or four hundred gold  pieces, according to the quality of the persons. The women wear a  cloth of very fine white cotton, or of silk of pretty colours, which  may be about six cubits long; they gird themselves with part of this  cloth from the waist below, and the other end of the cloth they cast  over the shoulder and the breasts, and one arm and shoulder remain  uncovered; on their feet sandals of gilt and well-worked leather;  their heads bare, only their hair combed, and they put a plait of it  over their heads, and in this many flowers and scents; and in the  nostrils a small hole on one side, and in it a gold thread with a  drop, either a pearl, or a ruby, or a sapphire drilled with a hole;  their ears also are bored and in them they wear many gold rings with  pearls and precious stones; and jewel necklaces round their throats,  bracelets on their arms of the same fashion, and also strings of  fine round coral on their arms, many rings with precious stones on  their fingers; and girt over their clothes with belts of gold and  jewels; and rings of gold on their legs; so that for the most part  these are very rich and well-dressed people. They are great dancers;  they sing and play on various instruments; they are taught to tumble  and to perform many feats of agility. They are pretty women, and of  a grand presence. These people marry in our manner; they have a  marriage law, but the great men marry as many women as they can  maintain, and the king has with him in his palaces many wives,  daughters of the great lords of his kingdom; and, besides these, he  has many others as concubines, and others as serving women who are  chosen throughout the kingdom as the most beautiful. And all the  attendance on the king is done by women, who wait upon him within  doors; and amongst them are all the employments of the king's  household: and all these women live and find room within these  palaces, which contain apartments for all. They bathe every day in  the pools of water, they sing and play on their instruments, and in  a thousand ways amuse the king: and he goes to see them bathe, and  from thence sends to his chamber the one that pleases him most; and  the first son that he has from any of these, inherits the kingdom.  Amongst them there is so much envy and rivality for the preference  of the king, that sometimes they kill themselves with poison. This  king has a house in which he meets with the governors and his  officers in council upon the affairs of the kingdom; and there all  the great men of the realm go to see him with great gifts; and he  dispenses great favours and likewise great punishments to those that  deserve them. These great men, his relations and those of great  lineage, when they do anything ill-done or prejudicial to his  service, are summoned to him; and they have to come immediately: and  they come in very rich litters on men's shoulders, and their horses  are led by the bridle before them, and many horsemen go in front of  them. They get down at the door of the palace and wait there with  their trumpets and musical instruments, until word is brought to the  king, and he commands them to come to his presence; and if they do  not give a good excuse and account of themselves and of the evil of  which they are accused, he commands them to be stripped and thrown  on the ground, and there bids them to receive many stripes. If such  a person were a near relation of the king's or a very great  personage, the king himself scourges him with his own hand, and  after he has been well beaten, the king orders very rich garments to  be given him from his own clothes chests, and then directs him to be  reconducted to his litter, and carried with great honour and great  clang of musical instruments and festivity to his abode. Many  litters and many horsemen always stand at the door of this palace:  and the king keeps at all times nine hundred elephants and more than  twenty thousand horses, all which elephants and horses are bought  with his money: the elephants, at the price of fifteen hundred to  two thousand ducats each, because they are very great and  well-fitted for war, and for taking about with him continually for  state. And the horses cost from three to six hundred ducats each,  and some of the choicest for his personal use, nine hundred or a  thousand ducats. These horses are distributed amongst the great  lords who are responsible for them, and keep them for the gentry and  knights to whom the king "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3829"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#17)"],[1,"stand it. We mustn't have any more omelettes, Millie. We must  economise. Millions of people get on all right without omelettes. I  suppose there are families where, if you suddenly produced an omelette,  the whole strength of the company would get up and cheer, led by  father. Cancel the omelettes, old girl, from now onward.\"    \"Yes, dear. But--\"    \"Well?\"    \"I don't _think_ Mrs. Beale would like that very much, dear. She has  been complaining a good deal about chicken at every meal. She says that  the omelettes are the only things that give her a chance. She says  there are always possibilities in an omelette.\"    \"In short,\" I said, \"what you propose to do is deliberately to remove  from this excellent lady's life the one remaining element of poetry.  You mustn't do it. Give Mrs. Beale her omelettes, and let's hope for a  larger supply of eggs.\"    \"Another thing,\" said Ukridge. \"It isn't only that there's a shortage  of eggs. That wouldn't matter so much if only we kept hatching out  fresh squads of chickens. I'm not saying the hens aren't doing their  best. I take off my hat to the hens. As nice a hard-working lot as I  ever want to meet, full of vigour and earnestness. It's that damned  incubator that's letting us down all the time. The rotten thing won't  work. _I_ don't know what's the matter with it. The long and the short  of it is that it simply declines to incubate.\"    \"Perhaps it's your dodge of letting down the temperature. You remember,  you were telling me? I forget the details.\"    \"My dear old boy,\" he said earnestly, \"there's nothing wrong with my  figures. It's a mathematical certainty. What's the good of mathematics  if not to help you work out that sort of thing? No, there's something  deuced wrong with the machine itself, and I shall probably make a  complaint to the people I got it from. Where did we get the incubator,  old girl?\"    \"Harrod's, I think, dear,--yes, it was Harrod's. It came down with the  first lot of things.\"    \"Then,\" said Ukridge, banging the table with his fist, while his  glasses flashed triumph, \"we've got 'em. The Lord has delivered  Harrod's into our hand. Write and answer that letter of theirs  to-night, Millie. Sit on them.\"    \"Yes, dear.\"    \"Tell 'em that we'd have sent them their confounded eggs long ago, if  only their rotten, twopenny-ha'penny incubator had worked with any  approach to decency.\" He paused. \"Or would you be sarcastic, Garny, old  horse? No, better put it so that they'll understand. Say that I  consider that the manufacturer of the thing ought to be in Colney  Hatch--if he isn't there already--and that they are scoundrels for  palming off a groggy machine of that sort on me.\"    \"The ceremony of opening the morning's letters at Harrod's ought to be  full of interest and excitement to-morrow,\" I said.    This dashing counter-stroke seemed to relieve Ukridge. His pessimism  vanished. He seldom looked on the dark side of things for long at a  time. He began now to speak hopefully of the future. He planned out  ingenious improvements. Our fowls were to multiply so rapidly and  consistently that within a short space of time Dorsetshire would be  paved with them. Our eggs were to increase in size till they broke  records and got three-line notices in the \"Items of Interest\" column in  the _Daily Mail_. Briefly, each hen was to become a happy combination  of rabbit and ostrich.    \"There is certainly a good time coming,\" I said. \"May it be soon.  Meanwhile, what of the local tradesmen?\"    Ukridge relapsed once more into gloom.    \"They are the worst of the lot. I don't mind the London people so much.  They only write, and a letter or two hurts nobody. But when it comes to  butchers and bakers and grocers and fishmongers and fruiterers and what  not coming up to one's house and dunning one in one's own garden,--well  it's a little hard, what?\"    \"Oh, then those fellows I found you talking to yesterday were duns? I  thought they were farmers, come to hear your views on the rearing of  poultry.\"    \"Which were they? Little chap with black whiskers and long, thin man  with beard? That was Dawlish, the grocer, and Curtis, the fishmonger.  The others had gone before you came.\"    It may be wondered why, before things came to such a crisis, I had not  placed my balance at the bank at the disposal of the senior partner for  use on behalf of the farm. The fact was that my balance was at the  moment small. I have not yet in the course of this narrative gone into  my pecuniary position, but I may state here that it was an inconvenient  one. It was big with possibilities, but of ready cash there was but a  meagre supply. My parents had been poor. But I had a wealthy uncle.  Uncles are notoriously careless of the comfort of their nephews. Mine  was no exception. He had views. He was a great believer in matrimony,  as, having married three wives--not simultaneously--he had every right  to be. He was also of opinion that the less money the young bachelor  possessed, the better. The consequence was that he announced his  intention of giving me a handsome allowance from the day that I  married, but not an instant before. Till that glad day I would have to  shift for myself. And I am bound to admit that--for an uncle--it was a  remarkably sensible idea. I am also of the opinion that it is greatly  to my credit, and a proof of my pure and unmercenary nature, that I did  not instantly put myself up to be raffled for, or rush out into the  streets and propose marriage to the first lady I met. But I was making  quite enough with my pen to support myself, and, be it never so humble,  there is something pleasant in a bachelor existence, or so I had  thought until very recently.    I had thus no great stake in Ukridge's chicken farm. I had contributed  a modest five pounds to the preliminary expenses, and another five  after the roop incident. But further I could not go with safety. When  his income is dependent on the whims of editors and publishers, the  prudent man keeps something up his sleeve against a sudden slump in his  particular wares. I did not wish to have to make a hurried choice  between matrimony and the workhouse.    Having exhausted the subject of finance--or, rather, when I began to  feel that it was exhausting me--I took my clubs, and strolled up the  hill to the links to play off a match with a sportsman from the  village. I had entered some days previously for a competition for a  trophy (I quote the printed notice) presented by a local supporter of  the game, in which up to the present I was getting on nicely. I had  survived two rounds, and expected to beat my present opponent, which  would bring me into the semi-final. Unless I had bad luck, I felt that  I ought to get into the final, and win it. As far as I could gather  from watching the play of my rivals, the professor was the best of  them, and I was convinced that I should have no difficulty with him.  But he had the most extraordinary luck at golf, though he never  admitted it. He also exercised quite an uncanny influence on his  opponent. I have seen men put completely off their stroke by his good  fortune.    I disposed of my man without difficulty. We parted a little coldly. He  had decapitated his brassy on the occasion of his striking Dorsetshire  instead of his ball, and he was slow in recovering from the complex  emotions which such an episode induces.    In the club-house I met the professor, whose demeanour was a welcome  contrast to that of my late opponent. The professor had just routed his  opponent, and so won through to the semi-final. He was warm, but  jubilant.    I congratulated him, and left the place.    Phyllis was waiting outside. She often went round the course with him.    \"Good afternoon,\" I said. \"Have you been round with the professor?\"    \"Yes. We must have been in front of you. Father won his match.\"    \"So he was telling me. I was very glad to hear it.\"    \"Did you win, Mr. Garnet?\"    \"Yes. Pretty easily. My opponent had bad luck all through. Bunkers  seemed to have a magnetic attraction for him.\"    \"So you and father are both in the semi-final? I hope you will play  very badly.\"    \"Thank you,\" I said.    \"Yes, it does sound rude, doesn't it? But father has set his heart on  winning this year. Do you know that he has played in the final round  two years running now?\"    \"Really?\"    \"Both times he was beaten by the same man.\"    \"Who was that? Mr. Derrick plays a much better game than anybody I have  seen on these links.\"    \"It was nobody who is here now. It was a Colonel Jervis. He has not  come to Combe Regis this year. That's why father is hopeful.\"    \"Logically,\" I said, \"he ought to be certain to win.\"    \"Yes; but, you see, you were not playing last year, Mr. Garnet.\"    \"Oh, the professor can make rings round me,\" I said.    \"What did you go round in to-day?\"    \"We were playing match-play, and only did the first dozen holes; but my  average round is somewhere in the late eighties.\"    \"The best father has ever done is ninety, and that was only once. So  you see, Mr. Garnet, there's going to be another tragedy this year.\"    \"You make me feel a perfect brute. But it's more than likely, you must  remember, that I shall fail miserably if I ever do play your father in  the final. There are days when I play golf as badly as I play tennis.  You'll hardly believe me.\"    She smiled reminiscently.    \"Tom is much too good at tennis. His service is perfectly dreadful.\"    \"It's a little terrifying on first acquaintance.\"    \"But you're better at golf than at tennis, Mr. Garnet. I wish you were  not.\"    \"This is special pleading,\" I said. \"It isn't fair to appeal to my  better feelings, Miss Derrick.\"    \"I didn't know golfers had any where golf was concerned. Do you really  have your off-days?\"    \"Nearly always. There are days when I slice with my driver as if it  were a bread-knife.\"    \"Really?\"    \"And when I couldn't putt to hit a haystack.\" "]]]
