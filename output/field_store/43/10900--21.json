The negro was a  constant source of wonder to the crowds of Indians who visited them. The  one-eyed great chief of the Minnetarees said that some foolish young men  had told him there was a person quite black. When York, the negro,  appeared, the one-eyed savage, much surprised, examined the negro  closely, and spitting on a finger rubbed the skin in order to wash off  the paint, and it was not until the negro showed his curly hair that the  Indian could be persuaded he was not a painted white man.    Game, though at some distance, was abundant, and seventy head of large  animals were obtained in a hunt of ten days. With regard to the Indians  Lewis says: \"A camp of Mandans caught within two days one hundred goats  a short distance below us. Their mode of hunting them is to form a large  strong pen or fold, from which a fence is made of bushes gradually  widening on each side; the animals are surrounded by the hunters and  gently driven toward this pen, in which they imperceptibly find  themselves enclosed, and are then at the mercy of the hunters.    \"When the Indians engage in killing buffalo, the hunters mount on  horseback and, armed with bows and arrows, encircle the herd and  gradually drive it into a plain or open place fit for the movement of  horse; they then ride in among them, and singling out a buffalo, a  female being preferred, go as close as possible and wound her with  arrows till they think they have given the mortal stroke; when they  pursue another till the quiver is exhausted. If, which rarely happens,  the wounded buffalo attacks the hunter, he evades the blow by the  agility of his horse, which is trained for the combat with great  dexterity.\"    The winter proved to be of unusual severity, and several times the  temperature fell to forty degrees below zero, and proof spirits froze  into hard ice. The fortitude with which the hardy savages withstood such  extreme cold, half naked as they often were, impressed our explorers.    Spring opened early, and on April 7, 1805, Fort Mandan was abandoned,  one party of ten with the barge going down the river with despatches and  specimens. Lewis and Clark with their party of thirty started up the  Missouri in six canoes and two large open boats, which had been  constructed by them. They had three interpreters--Drewyer, Chaboneau,  and his wife. Drewyer was a Canadian half-breed who had always lived in  the woods, and while he had inherited from his mother the intuitive  sagacity of the Indian in following the faintest trail, he had also  acquired to a wonderful degree that knowledge of the shifts and  expedients of camp life which is the resource and pride of the frontier  huntsman. Chaboneau's life had been largely spent among the Blackfeet,  by whom his wife, a Snake Indian, had been taken in war and enslaved  when a young girl.    At the mouth of the Little Missouri the three French hunters, who had  ventured to follow the party, stopped for trapping, as they found beaver  very plentiful. Chaboneau Creek, the farthest point on the Missouri yet  visited by white men, was passed, and on April 26th they arrived at the  mouth of the Yellowstone. Lewis was here particularly pleased with the  wide plains, interspersed with forests of various trees, and expressed  his opinion that the situation was most suitable for a trading  establishment.    Spring had now fairly opened, the trees were in leaf, a flower was seen,  and despite the scanty verdure of the new grass, game was very abundant.  In many places, however, the barren banks and sand-bars were covered  with a white incrustation of alkali salts, looking like frost or newly  fallen snow, which were present in such quantities that all the small  tributaries of the Missouri proved to be bitter and unhealthy water.  Signs of human life became rarer, but now and then they passed an old  Indian camp, and near one saw the burial place of an Indian woman. The  body, carefully wrapped in dressed buffalo robes, rested on a high  scaffold, with two sleds and harness over it. Nearby lay the remains of  a dog sacrificed to the shades of his dead mistress. In a bag were  articles fitting for women--moccasins, red and blue paint, beavers'  nails, scrapers for dressing hides, dried roots, a little Mandan  tobacco, and several plaits of sweet-smelling grass.    The oar was plied unceasingly save when a favoring wind filled their  sails and facilitated their progress. In early May they drew up their  canoes for the night at the mouth of a bold, beautiful stream, and in  the abundant timber found feeding on the young willows so many clumsy  porcupines that they called it Porcupine River. Game was present in vast  quantities; the elk were tame, and the male buffalo would scarcely quit  grazing at the approach of man. As Lewis remarks: \"It has become an  amusement to supply the party with provisions.\"    On May 8th they dined at the mouth of a river flowing from a level,  well-watered, and beautiful country. As the water had a peculiar  whiteness they were induced to call it Milk River. The Missouri now  turned to the southwest and south, the country became more open, and  timber, of pine mostly, small and scanty.    [Illustration: Captain Meriwether Lewis.]    Although the buffalo were so tame and harmless that the men drove them  out of their way with sticks, yet the grizzly bear never failed to be a  dangerous and vicious visitor. One day six good hunters attacked a  grizzly, and four firing at forty paces, each lodged a ball in the body,  two going through the lungs. The animal ran at them furiously, when the  other hunters fired two balls into him, breaking a shoulder. The bear  yet pursued them, driving two into a canoe and the others into thickets,  from which they fired as fast as they could reload. Turning on them, he  drove two so closely that they dropped their guns and sprang from a  precipice twenty feet high into the river followed by the bear, who  finally succumbed to a shot through the head after eight balls had  passed completely through his body. Another bear, shot through the  heart, ran a quarter of a mile with undiminished speed before he fell  dead.    On the 20th, twenty-two hundred and seventy miles from St. Louis, they  came to the greenish-yellow waters of the Musselshell, and a short  distance beyond Captain Lewis caught his first glimpse of the Rocky  Mountains, the object of his hope and ambition. Beyond the Musselshell  their experiences were less pleasant: the country became more barren,  game and timber scarce, mosquitoes annoying; the high dry winds, full of  sand, made their eyes sore; the sun of midday burned, while almost every  night ice or frost chilled them.    The clear waters of the Judith River and its woods beautiful with  multitudinous mountain roses, the fragrant honeysuckle, and the tiny red  willows delighted their eyes; but the sight of a hundred and twenty-six  lately abandoned lodge-fires caused some uneasiness, as indicating a  late camping-place of a war-party of vicious northern Minnetarees or  Blackfeet.    A few miles farther, as they passed a precipice a hundred and twenty  feet high, they saw evidence of the cunning and wasteful methods of  hunting by Indians, for the remains of over a hundred buffalo were  scattered around, though the stream must have washed many away. Lewis  adds: \"These buffaloes had been chased down the precipice in a way very  common on the Missouri, and by which vast herds are destroyed in a  moment. The mode of hunting is to select one of the most active and  fleet young men, who is disguised in a buffalo skin round his body. The  skin of the head, with the ears and horns, are fastened on his own head  in such a way as to deceive the buffalo. Thus dressed he fixes himself  at a convenient distance between a herd of buffalo and any of the river  precipices, which sometimes extend for several miles. His companions, in  the meantime, get in the rear and side of the herd, and at a given  signal show themselves and advance toward the buffalo. They instantly  take the alarm, and finding the hunters beside them they run toward the  disguised Indian or decoy, who leads them on at full speed toward the  river, when suddenly securing himself in some crevice of the cliff,  which he had previously fixed on, the herd is left on the brink of the  precipice. It is then in vain for the foremost to retreat or even to  stop; they are pressed on by the hindmost ranks, who, seeing no danger  but from the hunters, goad on those before them till the whole are  precipitated and the shore is strewed with their dead bodies. Sometimes  in this perilous seduction the Indian himself is either trodden under  foot or, missing his footing in the cliff, is urged down the precipice  by the falling herd.\"    The river now took the form of frequent rapids, which made the work of  dragging the heavy canoes very painful, and the narrative runs: \"The  banks are so slippery in some places, and the mud so adhesive, that the  men are unable to wear moccasins. One-fourth of the time they are  obliged to be up to their arm-pits in the cold water, and sometimes walk  for yards over sharp fragments of rocks.\"    On June 3d they came to where the river divided into two large streams,  and it became of vital importance to the expedition to determine which  was the Missouri or Ahmateahza, as the Minnetarees called it, and which  they said approached very near to the Columbia. The success of the  expedition depended on the right decision, so Captain Lewis concluded to  encamp until reconnoitering columns could examine the two forks.    Lewis following up the north branch, two days' march, decided that it  was not the Missouri, and named it Maria's River. In returning he  narrowly escaped slipping over a precipice some ninety feet high. Lewis  had just reached a spot of safety when, says the narrative,    \"He heard a voice behind him"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36124"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 4, No. 1, August, 1851 (#17)"],[1,"here, give it to me, and go away,\" and taking the letter  from the man's hand, he threw it down on the table beside him, as if  it were not his intention to read it that night. Probably, indeed, it  was not; for he muttered as he looked at the address, \"She wants more  money, I dare say, to pay for some trash or another. How greedy these  women are. The parson preached the other day about the horse-leech's  daughter. By ---- I think I have got the horse-leech's mother!\" and he  laughed stupidly, not perceiving that, the point of his sarcasm  touched himself.    He drank another glass of wine, and then looked at the letter again;  but at length, after yet another glass, curiosity got the better of  his moodiness, and he opened the epistle.    The first sight of the contents dispelled not only his indifference  but the effects of the wine he had taken, and he read the letter with  an eager and a haggard eye. The substance was as follows:    \"MY DEAREST BOY:    \"All is lost and discovered. I can but write you a very short account  of the things that have been happening here, for I am under what these  people call the surveillance of the police. I have got a few minutes,  however, and I will pay the maid secretly to give this to the post.  Never was such a time as I have had this morning. Four men have been  here, and among them Atkinson, who lived just down below at the  cottage with the gray shutters. He knew me in a minute, and told  everybody who I was. But that is not the worst of it, for they have  got a commissioner of police with him--a terrible looking man, who  took as much snuff as Mr. Jenkins, the justice of peace. They had got  all sorts of information in England about me, and you, and every body,  and they came to me to give them more, and cross-questioned me in a  terrible manner; and that ugly old Commissioner, in his black coat and  great wig, took my keys, and opened all the drawers and places. What  could I do to stop them? So they got all your letters to me; because I  could not bear to burn my dear boy's letters, and that letter from old  Sir John to my poor father, which I once showed you. So when they got  all these, there was no use of trying to conceal it any more, and,  besides, they might have sent me to the Bastile or the Tower of  London. So every thing has come out, and the best thing you can do is  to take whatever money you have got, or can get, and run away as fast  as possible, and come over here and take me away. One of them was as  fine a man as ever I saw, and quite gentleman, though very severe.    \"Pray, my dear John, don't lose a moment's time, but run away before  they catch you; for they know every thing now, depend upon it, and  nothing will stop them from hanging you or sending you to the colonies  that you can do; for they have got all the proofs, and I could see by  their faces that they wanted nothing more; and if they do, my heart  will be quite broken, that is, if they hang you or send you to the  colonies, where you will have to work like a slave, and a man standing  over you with a whip, beating your bare back very likely. So run away,  and come to your afflicted mother.\"    She did not seem to have been quite sure what name to sign, for she  first put \"Brown,\" but then changed the word to \"Hastings,\" and then  again to \"Ayliffe.\" There were two or three postscripts, but they were  of no great importance, and John Ayliffe did not take the trouble of  reading them. The terms he bestowed upon his mother--not in the  secrecy of his heart, but aloud and fiercely--were any thing but  filial, and his burst of rage lasted full five minutes before it was  succeeded by the natural fear and trepidation which the intelligence  he had received might well excite. Then, however, his terror became  extreme. The color, usually high, and now heightened both by rage and  wine, left his cheeks, and, as he read over some parts of his mother's  letter again, he trembled violently.    \"She has told all,\" he repeated to himself, \"she has told all--and  most likely has added from his own fancy. They have got all my letters  too, which the fool did not burn. What did I say, I wonder? Too  much--too much, I am sure. Heaven and earth, what will come of it!  Would to God I had not listened to that rascal Shanks! Where should I  go now for advice? It must not be to him. He would only betray and  ruin me--make me the scape-goat--pretend that I had deceived him, I  dare say. Oh, he is a precious villain, and Mrs. Hazleton knows that  too well to trust him even with a pitiful mortgage--Mrs. Hazleton--I  will go to her. She is always kind to me, and she is devilish clever  too--knows a good deal more than Shanks if she did but understand the  law--I will go to her--she will tell me how to manage.\"    No time was to be lost. Ride as hard as he could it would take him  more than an hour to reach Mrs. Hazleton's house, and it was already  late. He ordered a horse to be saddled instantly, ran to his bedroom,  drew on his boots, and then, descending to the hall, stood swearing at  the slowness of the groom till the sound of hoofs made him run to the  door. In a moment he was in the saddle and away, much to the  astonishment of the servants, who puzzled themselves a little as to  what intelligence their young master could have received, and then  proceeded to console themselves according to the laws and ordinances  of the servants' hall in such cases made and provided. The wine he had  left upon the table disappeared with great celerity, and the butler,  who was a man of precision, arrayed a good number of small silver  articles and valuable trinkets in such a way as to be packed up and  removed with great facility and secrecy.    In the meanwhile John Ayliffe rode on at a furious pace, avoiding a  road which would have led him close by Mr. Shanks's dwelling, and  reached Mrs. Hazleton's door about nine o'clock.    That lady was sitting in a small room behind the drawing-room, which I  have already mentioned, where John Ayliffe was announced once more as  Sir John Hastings. But Mrs. Hazleton, in personal appearance at least,  was much changed since she was first introduced to the reader. She was  still wonderfully handsome. She had still that indescribable air of  calm, high-bred dignity which we are often foolishly inclined to  ascribe to noble feelings and a high heart; but which--where it is not  an art, an acquirement--only indicates, I am inclined to believe, when  it has any moral reference at all, strength of character and great  self-reliance. But Mrs. Hazleton was older--looked older a good  deal--more so than the time which had passed would alone account for.  The passions of the last two or three years had worn her sadly, and  probably the struggle to conceal those passions had worn her as much.  Nevertheless, she had grown somewhat fat under their influence, and a  wrinkle here and there in the fair skin was contradicted by the  plumpness of her figure.    She rose with quiet, easy grace to meet her young guest, and held out  her hand to him, saying, \"Really, my dear Sir John, you must not pay  me such late visits or I shall have scandal busying herself with my  good name.\"    But even as she spoke she perceived the traces of violent agitation  which had not yet departed from John Ayliffe's visage, and she added,  \"What is the matter? Has any thing gone wrong?\"    \"Every thing is going to the devil, I believe,\" said John Ayliffe, as  soon as the servant had closed the door. \"They have found out my  mother at St. Germain.\"    He paused there to see what effect this first intelligence would  produce, and it was very great; for Mrs. Hazleton well knew that upon  the concealment of his mother's existence had depended one of the  principal points in his suit against Sir Philip Hastings. What was  going on in her mind, however, appeared not in her countenance. She  paused in silence, indeed, for a moment or two, and then said in her  sweet musical voice, \"Well, Sir John, is that all?\"    \"Enough too, dear Mrs. Hazleton!\" replied the young man. \"Why you  surely remember that it was judged absolutely necessary she should be  supposed dead--you yourself said, when we were talking of it, 'Send  her to France.' Don't you remember?\"    \"No I do not,\" answered Mrs. Hazleton, thoughtfully; \"and if I did it  could only be intended to save the poor thing from all the torment of  being cross-examined in a court of justice.\"    \"Ay, she has been cross-examined enough in France nevertheless,\" said  the young man bitterly, \"and she has told every thing, Mrs.  Hazleton--all that she knew, and I dare say all that she guessed.\"    This news was somewhat more interesting than even the former; it  touched Mrs. Hazleton personally to a certain extent, for all that  Jane Ayliffe knew and all that she guessed might comprise a great deal  that Mrs. Hazleton would not have liked the world to know or guess  either. She retained all her presence of mind however, and replied  quite quietly \"Really, Sir John, I cannot at all form a judgment of  these things, or give you either assistance or advice, as I am anxious  to do, unless you explain the whole matter fully and clearly. What has  your mother done which seems to have affected you so much? Let me hear  the whole details, then I can judge and speak with some show of  reason. But calm yourself, calm yourself, my dear sir. We often at the  first glance of any unpleasant intelligence take fright, and thinking  the danger ten times greater than it really is, run into worse dangers  in trying to avoid it. Let me hear all, I say, and then I will  consider what is to be done.\"    Now Mrs. Hazleton had already, from what she had just heard,  determined precisely and entirely what she would do. She had divined  in an instant that the artful game in which John Ayliffe had been  engaged, and in which she herself had taken a hand, was played out,  and that he was the loser; but it "]]]
