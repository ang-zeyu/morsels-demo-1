Junge AP & ad medium ejus punctum  erige perpendiculum rectæ GH occurrens in H.    Lemma XXVIII.        _Nulla extat figura Ovalis cujus area, rectis pro lubitu abscissa,      possit per æquationes numero terminorum ac dimensionum finitas      generaliter inveniri._    Intra Ovalem detur punctum quodvis, circa quod ceu polum revolvatur  perpetuo linea recta, & interea in recta illa exeat punctum mobile de polo,  pergatq; semper ea cum velocitate, quæ sit ut rectæ illius intra Ovalem  longitudo. Hoc motu punctum illud describet Spiralem gyris infinitis. Jam  si area Oualis per finitam æquationem inveniri potest, invenietur etiam per  eandem æquationem distantia puncti a polo; quæ huic areæ proportionalis  est, adeoq; omnia Spiralis puncta per æquationem finitam inveniri possunt:  & propterea rectæ cujusvis positione datæ intersectio cum spirali inveniri  etiam potest per æquationem finitam. Atqui recta omnis infinite producta  spiralem secat in punctis numero infinitis, & æquatio, qua intersectio  aliqua duarum linearum invenitur, exhibet earum intersectiones omnes  radicibus totidem, adeoq; ascendit ad tot dimensiones quot sunt  intersectiones. Quoniam circuli duo se mutuo secant in punctis duobus,  intersectio una non invenitur nisi per æquationem duarum dimensionum, qua  intersectio altera etiam inveniatur. Quoniam duarum sectionum Conicarum  quatuor esse possunt intersectiones, non potest aliqua earum generaliter  inveniri nisi per æquationem quatuor dimensionum, qua omnes simul  inveniantur. Nam si intersectiones illæ seorsim quærantur, quoniam eadem  est omnium lex & conditio, idem erit calculus in casu unoquoq; & propterea  eadem semper conclusio, quæ igitur debet omnes intersectiones simul  complecti & indifferenter exhibere. Unde etiam intersectiones Sectionum  Conicarum & curvarum tertiæ potestatis, eo quod sex esse possunt, simul  prodeunt per æquationes sex dimensionum, & intersectiones duarum curvarum  tertiæ potestatis, quia novem esse possunt, simul prodeunt per æquationes  dimensionum novem. Id nisi necessario fieret, reducere liceret Problemata  omnia Solida ad Plana, & plusquam solida ad solida. Eadem de causa  intersectiones binæ rectarum & sectionum Conicarum prodeunt semper per  æquationes duarum dimensionum; ternæ rectarum & curvarum tertiæ potestatis  per æquationes trium, quaternæ rectarum & curvarum quartæ potestatis per  æquationes dimensionum quatuor, & sic in infinitum. Ergo intersectiones  numero infinitæ rectarum, propterea quod omnium eadem est lex & idem  calculus, requirunt æquationes numero dimensionum & radicum infinitas,  quibus omnes possunt simul exhiberi. Si a polo in rectam illam secantem  demittatur perpendiculum, & perpendiculum una cum secante revolvatur circa  polum, intersectiones spiralis transibunt in se mutuo, quæq; prima erat seu  proxima, post unam revolutionem secunda erit, post duas tertia, & sic  deinceps: nec interea mutabitur æquatio nisi pro mutata magnitudine  quantitatum per quas positio secantis determinatur. Unde cum quantitates  illæ post singulas revolutiones redeunt ad magnitudines primas, æquatio  redibit ad formam primam, adeoq; una eademq; exhibebit intersectiones  omnes, & propterea radices habebit numero infinitas, quibus omnes exhiberi  possunt. Nequit ergo intersectio rectæ & spiralis per æquationem finitam  generaliter inveniri, & idcirco nulla extat Ovalis cujus area, rectis  imperatis abscissa, possit per talem æquationem generaliter exhiberi.    Eodem argumento, si intervallum poli & puncti, quo spiralis describitur,  capiatur Ovalis perimetro abscissæ proportionale, probari potest quod  longitudo perimetri nequit per finitam æquationem generaliter exhiberi.    _Corollarium._    Hinc area Ellipseos, quæ radio ab umbilico ad corpus mobile ducto  describitur, non prodit ex dato tempore, per æquationem finitam; &  propterea per descriptionem Curuarum Geometrice rationalium determinari  nequit. Curvas Geometrice rationales appello quarum puncta omnia per  longitudines æquationibus definitas, id est, per longitudinum rationes  complicatas, determinari possunt; cæterasq; (ut Spirales, Quadratrices,  Trochoides) Geometrice irrationales. Nam longitudines quæ sunt vel non sunt  ut numerus ad numerum (quemadmodum in decimo Elementorum) sunt Arithmetice  rationales vel irrationales. Aream igitur Ellipseos tempori proportionalem  abscindo per Curvam Geometrice irrationalem ut sequitur.    Prop. XXXI. Prob.

The seeming irregularity of  the phenomena discouraged continuous attention; casual observations were  made the basis of arbitrary conjectures, and real knowledge received  little or no increase. In 1620 we find Jean Tarde, Canon of Sarlat,  arguing that because the sun is \"the eye of the world,\" and the eye of  the world _cannot suffer from ophthalmia_, therefore the appearances in  question must be due, not to actual specks or stains on the bright solar  disc, but to the transits of a number of small planets across it! To  this new group of heavenly bodies he gave the name of \"Borbonia Sidera,\"  and they were claimed in 1633 for the House of Hapsburg, under the title  of \"Austriaca Sidera\" by Father Malapertius, a Belgian Jesuit.[131] A  similar view was temporarily maintained against Galileo by the justly  celebrated Father Scheiner of Ingolstadt, and later by William  Gascoigne, the inventor of the micrometer; but most of those who were  capable of thinking at all on such subjects (and they were but few)  adhered either to the _cloud theory_ or to the _slag theory_ of  sun-spots. The first was championed by Galileo, the second by Simon  Marius, \"astronomer and physician\" to the brother Margraves of  Brandenburg. The latter opinion received a further notable development  from the fact that in 1618, a year remarkable for the appearance of  three bright comets, the sun was almost free from spots; whence it was  inferred that the cindery refuse from the great solar conflagration,  which usually appeared as dark blotches on its surface, was occasionally  thrown off in the form of comets, leaving the sun, like a snuffed taper,  to blaze with renewed brilliancy.[132]    In the following century, Derham gathered from observations carried on  during the years 1703-11, \"That the spots on the sun are caused by the  eruption of some new volcano therein, which at first pouring out a  prodigious quantity of smoke and other opacous matter, causeth the  spots; and as that fuliginous matter decayeth and spendeth itself, and  the volcano at last becomes more torrid and flaming, so the spots decay,  and grow to umbrae, and at last to faculae.\"[133]    The view, confidently upheld by Lalande,[134] that spots were rocky  elevations uncovered by the casual ebbing of a luminous ocean, the  surrounding penumbrae representing shoals or sandbanks, had even less to  recommend it than Derham's volcanic theory. Both were, however,  significant of a growing tendency to bring solar phenomena within the  compass of terrestrial analogies.    For 164 years, then, after Galileo first levelled his telescope at the  setting sun, next to nothing was learned as to its nature; and the facts  immediately ascertained, of its rotation on an axis nearly erect to the  plane of the ecliptic, in a period of between twenty-five and twenty-six  days, and of the virtual limitation of the spots to a so-called \"royal\"  zone extending some thirty degrees north and south of the solar equator,  gained little either in precision or development from five generations  of astronomers.    But in November, 1769, a spot of extraordinary size engaged the  attention of Alexander Wilson, professor of astronomy in the University  of Glasgow. He watched it day by day, and to good purpose. As the great  globe slowly revolved, carrying the spot towards its western edge, he  was struck with the gradual contraction and final disappearance of the  penumbra _on the side next the centre of the disc_; and when on the 6th  of December the same spot re-emerged on the eastern limb, he perceived,  as he had anticipated, that the shady zone was now deficient _on the  opposite side_, and resumed its original completeness as it returned to  a central position. In other spots subsequently examined by him, similar  perspective effects were visible, and he proved in 1774,[135] by strict  geometrical reasoning, that they could only arise in vast photospheric  excavations. It was not, indeed, the first time that such a view had  been suggested. Father Scheiner's later observations plainly  foreshadowed it;[136] a conjecture to the same effect was emitted by  Leonard Rost of Nuremburg early in the eighteenth century;[137] both by  Lahire in 1703 and by J. Cassini in 1719 spots had been seen as notches  on the solar limb; while in 1770 Pastor Schuelen of Essingen, from the  careful study of phenomena similar to those noted by Wilson, concluded  their depressed nature.[138] Modern observations, nevertheless, prove  those phenomena to be by no means universally present.    Wilson's general theory of the sun was avowedly tentative. It took the  modest form of an interrogatory. \"Is it not reasonable to think,\" he  asks, \"that the great and stupendous body of the sun is made up of two  kinds of matter, very different in their qualities; that by far the  greater part is solid and dark, and that this immense and dark globe is  encompassed with a thin covering of that resplendent substance from  which the sun would seem to derive the whole of his vivifying heat and  energy?\"[139] He further suggests that the excavations or spots may be  occasioned \"by the working of some sort of elastic vapour which is  generated within the dark globe,\" and that the luminous matter, being in  some degree fluid, and being acted upon by gravity, tends to flow down  and cover the nucleus. From these hints, supplemented by his own  diligent observations and sagacious reasonings, Herschel elaborated a  scheme of solar constitution which held its ground until the physics of  the sun were revolutionised by the spectroscope.    A cool, dark, solid globe, its surface diversified with mountains and  valleys, clothed in luxuriant vegetation, and \"richly stored with  inhabitants,\" protected by a heavy cloud-canopy from the intolerable  glare of the upper luminous region, where the dazzling coruscations of a  solar aurora some thousands of miles in depth evolved the stores of  light and heat which vivify our world--such was the central luminary  which Herschel constructed with his wonted ingenuity, and described with  his wonted eloquence.    \"This way of considering the sun and its atmosphere,\" he says,[140]  \"removes the great dissimilarity we have hitherto been used to find  between its condition and that of the rest of the great bodies of the  solar system. The sun, viewed in this light, appears to be nothing else  than a very eminent, large, and lucid planet, evidently the first, or,  in strictness of speaking, the only primary one of our system; all  others being truly secondary to it. Its similarity to the other globes  of the solar system with regard to its solidity, its atmosphere, and its  diversified surface, the rotation upon its axis, and the fall of heavy  bodies, leads us on to suppose that it is most probably also inhabited,  like the rest of the planets, by beings whose organs are adapted to the  peculiar circumstances of that vast globe.\"    We smile at conclusions which our present knowledge condemns as  extravagant and impossible, but such incidental flights of fancy in no  way derogate from the high value of Herschel's contributions to solar  science. The cloud-like character which he attributed to the radiant  shell of the sun (first named by Schroeter the \"photosphere\") is borne  out by all recent investigations; he observed its mottled or corrugated  aspect, resembling, as he described it, the roughness on the rind of an  orange; showed that \"faculae\" are elevations or heaped-up ridges of the  disturbed photospheric matter; and threw out the idea that spots may  ensue from an excess of the ordinary luminous emissions. A certain  \"empyreal\" gas was, he supposed (very much as Wilson had done),  generated in the body of the sun, and rising everywhere by reason of its  lightness, made for itself, when in moderate quantities, small openings  or \"pores,\"[141] abundantly visible as dark points on the solar disc.  But should an uncommon quantity be formed, \"it will,\" he maintained,  \"burst through"]]]
