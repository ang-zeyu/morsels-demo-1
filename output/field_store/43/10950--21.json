[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39341"],[0,"The Sea: Its Stirring Story of Adventure, Peril, & Heroism. Volume 1 (#17)"],[1,"of our young sailor on the experimental cruises gave him  plenty of employment. In his own words it was as follows:--Commencing at  five a.m.--\"Turn hands up; holystone or scrub upper deck; coil down ropes.  Half-past six--breakfast, half an hour; call the watch, watch below, clean  the upper deck; watch on deck, clean wood and brass-work; put the upper  decks to rights. Eight a.m.--hands to quarters; clean guns and arms;  division for inspection; prayers; make sail, reef topsails, furl  top-sails, top-gallant sails, royals; reef courses, down top-gallant and  royal yards. This continued till eight bells, twelve o'clock, dinner one  hour. 'All hands again; cutlass, rifle, and big-gun drill till four  o'clock; clear up decks, coil up ropes;' and then our day's work is done.\"  Then they would make little trips to sea, many of them to experience the  woes of sea-sickness for the first time.    But the boys on the clean and well-kept training-brig were better off in  all respects than poor Dana. When first ordered aloft, he tells us, \"I had  not got my 'sea-legs' on, was dreadfully sea-sick, with hardly strength to  hold on to anything, and it was 'pitch-dark' * * * How I got along I  cannot now remember. I 'laid out' on the yards, and held on with all my  strength. I could not have been of much service; for I remember having  been sick several times before I left the top-sail yard. Soon all was snug  aloft, and we were again allowed to go below. This I did not consider much  of a favour; for the confusion of everything below, and that inexpressibly  sickening smell, caused by the shaking up of bilge-water in the hold, made  the steerage but an indifferent refuge to the cold, wet decks. I had often  read of the nautical experiences of others, but I felt as though there  could be none worse than mine; for, in addition to every other evil, I  could not but remember that this was only the first night of a two years'  voyage. When we were all on deck, we were not much better off, for we were  continually ordered about by the officer, who said that it was good for us  to be in motion. Yet anything was better than the horrible state of things  below. I remember very well going to the hatchway and putting my head  down, when I was oppressed by nausea, and felt like being relieved  immediately.\" We can fully recommend the example of Dana, who, acting on  the advice of the black cook on board, munched away at a good half-pound  of salt beef and hard biscuit, which, washed down with cold water, soon,  he says, made a man of him.    Some little explanation of the mode of dividing time on board ship may be  here found useful. A \"watch\" is a term both for a division of the crew and  of their time: a full watch is four hours. At the expiration of each four  hours, commencing from twelve o'clock noon, the men below are called in  these or similar terms--\"All the starboard (or port) watch ahoy! Eight  bells!\" The watch from four p.m. to eight p.m. is divided, on a  well-regulated ship, into two \"dog-watches;\" the object of this is to make  an uneven number of periods--seven, instead of six, so that the men change  the order of their watches daily. Otherwise, it will be seen that a man,  who, on leaving port, stood in a particular watch--from twelve noon to four  p.m.--would stand in the same watch throughout the voyage; and he who had  two night-watches at first would always have them. The periods of the  \"dog-watches\" are usually devoted to smoking and recreation for those off  duty.    As the terms involved must occur frequently in this work, it is necessary  also to explain for some readers the division of time itself by \"bells.\"  The limit is \"eight bells,\" which are struck at twelve, four, and eight  o'clock a.m. or p.m. The ship's bell is sounded each half-hour. Half-past  any of the above hours is \"one bell\" struck sharply by itself. At the  hour, two strokes are made sharply _following_ each other. Expressing the  strokes by signs, half-past twelve would be | (representing one stroke);  one o'clock would be || (two strokes sharply struck, one after the other);  half-past one, || |; two o'clock, || ||; half-past two, || || |; three  o'clock, || || ||; half-past three, || || || |; and four o'clock, || || ||  ||, or \"eight bells.\" The process is then repeated in the next watch, and  the only disturbing element comes from the elements, which occasionally,  when the vessel rolls or pitches greatly, cause the bell to strike without  leave.    Seamen before the mast are divided into three classes--able, ordinary, and  boys. In the merchant service a \"green hand\" of forty may be rated as a  boy; a landsman must ship for boy's wages on the first voyage. Merchant  seamen rate themselves--in other words, they cause themselves to be entered  on the ship's books according to their qualifications and experience.  There are few instances of abuse in this matter, and for good reason.  Apart from the disgrace and reduction of wages and rating which would  follow, woe to the man who sets himself up for an A.B. when he should  enter as a boy; for the rest of the crew consider it a fraud on  themselves. The vessel would be short-handed of a man of the class  required, and their work would be proportionately increased. No mercy  would be shown to such an impostor, and his life on board would be that of  a dog, but anything rather than that of a \"jolly sea-dog.\"(40)    There are lights in the sailor's chequered life. Seamen are, Shakespeare  tells us, \"but men\"--and, if we are to believe Dibdin, grog is a decided  element in their happier hours. \"Grog\" is now a generic term; but it was  not always. One Admiral Vernon--who persisted in wearing a grogram(41)  tunic so much that he was known among his subordinates as \"Old  Grog\"--earned immortality of a disagreeable nature by watering the  rum-ration of the navy to its present standard. At 11.30 a.m., on all  ships of the Royal Navy nowadays, half a gill of watered rum--two parts of  water to one of the stronger drink--is served out to each of the crew,  unless they have forfeited it by some act of insubordination. The  officers, including the petty officers, draw half a gill of pure rum; the  former put it into the general mess, and many never taste it. \"Six-water\"  grog is a mild form of punishment. \"Splicing the main-brace\" infers extra  grog served out for extraordinary service. Formerly, and, indeed, as late  as forty odd years ago, the daily ration was a full gill; but, as sailors  traded and bartered their drinks among themselves, it would happen once in  awhile that one would get too much \"on board.\" It has happened  occasionally in consequence that a seaman has tumbled overboard, or fallen  from the yards or rigging, and has met an inglorious death. Boys are not  allowed grog in the Royal Navy, and there is no absolute rule among  merchant-vessels. In the American navy there is a coin allowance in lieu  of rum, and every nation has its own peculiarities in this matter. In the  French navy, wine, very _ordinaire_, and a little brandy is issued.    There are shadows, too, in the sailor's life--as a rule, he brings them on  himself, but by no means always. If sailors are \"but men,\" officers rank  in the same category, and occasionally act like brutes. So much has been  written on the subject of the naval \"cat\"--a punishment once dealt out for  most trifling offences, and not abolished yet, that the writer has some  diffidence in approaching the subject. A volume might be written on the  theme; let the testimony of Dr. Stables,(42) a surgeon of the Royal Navy,  suffice. It shall be told in his own words:--    \"One item of duty there is, which occasionally devolves on the medical  officer, and for the most part goes greatly against the feeling of the  young surgeon; I refer to his compulsory attendance at floggings. It is  only fair to state that the majority of captains and commanders use the  cat as seldom as possible, and that, too, only sparingly. In some ships,  however, flogging is nearly as frequent as prayers of a morning. Again, it  is more common on foreign stations than at home, and boys of the first or  second class, marines, and ordinary seamen, are for the most part the  victims.... We were at anchor in Simon's Bay. All the minutiae of the scene  I remember as though it were but yesterday. The morning was cool and  clear, the hills clad in lilac and green, sea-birds floating high in air,  and the waters of the bay reflecting the blue of the sky, and the lofty  mountain-sides forming a picture almost dream-like in its quietude and  serenity. The men were standing about in groups, dressed in their whitest  of pantaloons, bluest of smocks, and neatest of black-silk neckerchiefs.  By-and-by the culprit was led in by a file of marines, and I went below  with him to make the preliminary examination, in order to report whether  or not he might be fit for the punishment.    \"He was as good a specimen of the British mariner as one could wish to  look upon--hardy, bold, and wiry. His crime had been smuggling spirits on  board.    \"'Needn't examine me, doctor,' said he; 'I aint afeared of their four  dozen; they can't hurt me, sir--leastways my back, you know--my breast,  though; hum--m!' and he shook his head, rather sadly I thought, as he bent  down his eyes.    \"'What,' said I, 'have you anything the matter with your chest?'    \"'Nay, doctor, nay; it's my feelings they'll hurt. I've a little girl at  home that loves me, and, bless you, sir, I won't look her in the face  again nohow.'    \"I felt his pulse. No lack of strength there, no nervousness; the artery  had the firm beat of health, the tendons felt like rods of iron beneath  the finger, and his biceps stood out hard and round as the mainstay of an  old seventy-four.... All hands had already assembled--the men and boys on  one side, and the officers, in cocked hats and swords, on the other.

Considering the distinctive combination of characters possessed by  _tropicalis_, and its isolated, restricted geographic range (the  nearest known record of _Geomys_ is approximately 165 miles to the  north), _tropicalis_ is here regarded as a full species. A skull alone  examined from 10 miles northwest of Tampico does not differ from those  of other specimens studied.    The average weight of five non-pregnant July-taken females was 189.4  (180-200) grams. Weights of three males were 280, 270, and 255 grams.  Females are in all measurements smaller than males.         _Measurements._--Average and extreme measurements of five       females and three males from one mile south of Altamira are,       respectively, as follows: 243.5 (235-250), 260, 260, 265;       82.0 (78-85), 87, 93, 89; 32.2 (31-33), 35, 35, 33; ear from       notch in both sexes, 5; condylobasal length, 42.3       (41.3-43.1), 46.0, 48.0, 46.2; zygomatic breadth, 26.6       (25.1-27.7), 30.4, 31.2, 30.5; interorbital constriction,       6.2 (6.1-6.3), 6.0, 6.2, 6.3; length of nasals, 14.6       (14.0-15.3), 17.0, 16.8, 15.9; alveolar length of maxillary       tooth-row, 9.0 (8.6-9.3), 9.9, 10.0, 9.4.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 19: 1 mi. S       Altamira, 18; 10 mi. NW Tampico, 1.         Additional record: Altamira (Goldman, 1915:134).      =Heterogeomys hispidus negatus= Goodwin    Hispid Pocket Gopher         1953. _Heterogeomys hispidus negatus_ Goodwin, Amer. Mus.       Novit., 1620:1, May 4, type from Gomez Feras [Farias], 1300       ft., Tamaulipas.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Known only from the vicinity       of the type locality.    Specimens of this pocket gopher were taken in large Macabee traps, at  night with the aid of a dog, and by natives using slingshots. Mounds of  _H. hispidus_ were common two miles west of El Carrizo near banana  trees; the mouths of burrows were four to five inches in diameter. Two  females collected at this locality on April 16 and 17 were lactating.    Specimens examined of _H. hispidus_ from Tamaulipas resemble the  description of _H. h. negatus_ more than that of _H. h. concavus_, and  are referred, therefore, to _negatus_. I assume, on geographic grounds,  that the individuals reported by Hooper (1953:5) as _concavus_ are  _negatus_; they are here referred to as _negatus_. If this referral is  correct, the subspecies _concavus_ probably does not occur in  Tamaulipas.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 6: Ejido Santa       Isabel, 2 km. W Pan-American Highway, 2000 ft., 1; 2 km. W       El Carrizo, 1; 5 km. W El Carrizo, 4.

Specimens from Miquihuana were trapped in tunnels at 6400 feet  elevation. At Palmillas, individuals were trapped in an area of  mesquite, other bushes and \"lechuguilla.\" Three specimens from  southeast of Reynosa were collected in traps set along the dikes of  irrigation ditches. Most specimens from Nicolas were brought by natives  to the collector, but some were caught in traps set in tunnels among  the desert bushes.      =Cratogeomys castanops planifrons= Nelson and Goldman         1943. _Cratogeomys castanops planifrons_ Nelson and Goldman,       Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 47:146, June 13, type from       Miquihuana, 5000 ft., Tamaulipas.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Higher elevations in       southwestern part of state.    Specimens from four miles north of Jaumave do not differ from specimens  from Miquihuana. The weights of nine females averaged 146.4 (110-210)  grams; three males weighed 178, 203, and 215 grams.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 29:       Miquihuana, 6400 ft., 9; 4 mi. N Jaumave, 2500 ft., 5;       Nicolas, 56 km. NW Tula, 5500 ft., 15.      =Cratogeomys castanops tamaulipensis= Nelson and Goldman         1934. _Cratogeomys castanops tamaulipensis_ Nelson and       Goldman, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 47:141, June 13, type       from Matamoros, Tamaulipas.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Known only from two       localities in extreme northern part of state, but probably       occurs throughout northeastern part of state.    Three specimens from three miles southeast of Reynosa are referred to  _C. c. tamaulipensis_ on geographic grounds. They are tawny brown  dorsally instead of cinnamon brown or pinkish cinnamon as Nelson and  Goldman (1943:141) described _tamaulipensis_, and the basioccipital  bone (in one male) is parallel-sided instead of wedge-shaped. Possibly  this difference is owing to sex; Nelson and Goldman studied only one  adult, a female (the type), and the only adult seen by me was a male.         _Measurements._--An adult male (58118) from three miles       southeast of Reynosa, measured as follows: 301; 81; 40; 7;       condylobasal length, 57.0; zygomatic breadth, 41.2; palatal       length, 36.1; breadth of rostrum, 11.8; length of nasals,       22.0; squamosal breadth, 34.0; alveolar length of maxillary       tooth-row, 10.8.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 3, from 3 mi.       SE Reynosa.         Additional record: Matamoros (Nelson and Goldman, 1934:140).      =Perognathus merriami merriami= J. A. Allen    Merriam's Pocket Mouse         1892. _Perognathus merriami_ J. A. Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus.       Nat. Hist., 4:45, March 25, type from Brownsville, Cameron       Co., Texas.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--State-wide except       southwestern part.    Most of the available specimens of _P. m. merriami_ were collected in  the semi-arid areas of mesquite and grasses. At Soto la Marina _P. m.  merriami_ was abundant in open fields surrounded by brush. One female,  collected on July 4, one mile south of Altamira was lactating. Weights  of 16 adults from Soto la Marina and that of nine adults from the  vicinity of San Fernando are, respectively: 8.2 (7-10) and 8.1 (7-9)  grams.    Specimens from Tamaulipas are darker than those examined from Coahuila  and southern Texas. A skull picked up on the barrier beach, 73 miles  south of Washington Beach, differs from all other skulls examined in  having the rostrum (3.6 mm.) and M1 (4.3) wider, auditory bullae  relatively smaller, and glenoid fossa larger (2.6 instead of less than  2.3 in specimens from Soto la Marina).         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 46: 4-4.5 mi.       S Nuevo Laredo, 900 ft., 4; 10 mi. S, 11 mi. E Nuevo Laredo,       600 ft., 2; 1 mi. S Santa Teresa, 1; San Fernando, 180 ft.,       1; 2 mi. W San Fernando, 180 ft., 14; 73 mi. S Washington       Beach, 1; 12 mi. NW San Carlos, 1300 ft., 1; Soto la Marina,       19; Ciudad Victoria, 1; 17 mi. SW Tula, 3900 ft., 1; 1 mi. S       Altamira, 1.         Additional records (Osgood, 1900:22, unless otherwise       noted): Mier; Reynosa; Matamoros; 40 mi. S Matamoros       (Hooper, 1953:5); Hidalgo; Altamira.      =Perognathus hispidus hispidus= Baird    Hispid Pocket Mouse         1858. _Perognathus hispidus_ Baird, Mammals, in Repts. Expl.       Surv. ..., 8(1):421, July 14, type from Charco Escondido,       Tamaulipas.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Central and northern parts of       state.    Two specimens examined from the vicinity of Nuevo Laredo were trapped  in weeds and tall grass along an irrigation ditch that ran between  desert and a cornfield. One was a lactating female (November 15) and  weighed 31 grams; the other, an immature male, weighed 23 grams. A  May-taken specimen from Soto la Marina possesses a broader and more  ochraceous lateral line than the other three individuals examined from  Tamaulipas and the Texan specimens seen.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 4: 10 mi. S,       11 mi. E Nuevo Laredo, 600 ft., 2; Soto la Marina, 500 ft.,       1; 9-1/2 mi. SW Padilla, 800 ft., 1.         Additional records (Osgood, 1900:44, unless otherwise       noted): Mier; Matamoros; Charco Escondido (Baird, 1858:422);       3 mi. W Soto la Marina (Hooper, 1953:5).      =Perognathus nelsoni nelsoni= Merriam    Nelson's Pocket Mouse         1894. _Perognathus (Chaetodipus) nelsoni_ Merriam, Proc.       Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia, 46:266, September 27, type       from Hacienda La Parada, about 25 mi. NW Cd. San Luis       Potosi, San Luis Potosi.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Known only from the west side       of the Sierra Madre Oriental in southwestern part of state.    Most of the specimens examined were taken in semi-arid habitats where  the dominant plants were cactus, weeds and bushes.    In Tamaulipas, specimens from the southern localities (places labeled  with reference to Tula) are darker than those from the two northernmost  localities (Miquihuana and four miles north of Jaumave). Most  measurements are about equal in the southern and northern specimens,  but in some measurements southern specimens average slightly smaller  than those from the north. Greatest"]]]
