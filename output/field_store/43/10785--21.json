X      The shout was hushed on lake and fell,    The Monk resumed his muttered spell;    Dismal and low its accents came,                               225    The while he scathed the Cross with flame:    And the few words that reached the air,    Although the holiest name was there,    Had more of blasphemy than prayer.    But when he shook above the crowd                              230    Its kindled points, he spoke aloud:    \"Woe to the wretch, who fails to rear    At this dread sign the ready spear!    For, as the flames this symbol sear,    His home, the refuge of his fear,                              235            A kindred fate shall know;    Far o'er its roof the volumed flame    Clan-Alpine's vengeance shall proclaim,    While maids and matrons on his name    Shall call down wretchedness and shame,                        240            And infamy and woe.\"    Then rose the cry of females, shrill    As goshawk's whistle on the hill,    Denouncing misery and ill,    Mingled with childhood's babbling trill                        245            Of curses stammered slow;    Answering, with imprecation dread,    \"Sunk be his home in embers red!    And cursed be the meanest shed    That e'er shall hide the houseless head                        250            We doom to want and woe!\"    A sharp and shrieking echo gave,    Coir-Uriskin, thy goblin cave!    And the gray pass where birches wave,            On Beala-nam-bo.                                       255      XI      Then deeper paused the priest anew,    And hard his laboring breath he drew,    While, with set teeth and clenched hand,    And eyes that glowed like fiery brand,    He meditated curse more dread,                                 260    And deadlier, on the clansman's head,    Who, summoned to his chieftain's aid,    The signal saw and disobeyed.    The crosslet's points of sparkling wood    He quenched among the bubbling blood,                          265    And, as again the sign he reared,    Hollow and hoarse his voice was heard:    \"When flits this Cross from man to man,    Vich-Alpine's summons to his clan,    Burst be the ear that fails to heed!                           270    Palsied the foot that shuns to speed!    May ravens tear the careless eyes,    Wolves make the coward heart their prize!    As sinks that blood-stream in the earth,    So may his heart's blood drench his hearth!                    275    As dies in hissing gore the spark,    Quench thou his light, Destruction dark!    And be the grace to him denied,    Bought by this sign to all beside!\"    He ceased; no echo gave again                                  280    The murmur of the deep Amen.      XII      Then Roderick, with impatient look,    From Brian's hand the symbol took:    \"Speed, Malise, speed!\" he said, and gave    The crosslet to his henchman brave.                            285    \"The muster-place be Lanrick mead--    Instant the time--speed, Malise, speed!\"    Like heath-bird, when the hawks pursue,    A barge across Loch Katrine flew;    High stood the henchman on the prow,                           290    So rapidly the barge-men row,    The bubbles, where they launched the boat,    Were all unbroken and afloat,    Dancing in foam and ripple still,    When it had neared the mainland hill;                          295    And from the silver beach's side    Still was the prow three fathom wide,    When lightly bounded to the land    The messenger of blood and brand.      XIII      Speed, Malise, speed! the dun deer's hide                      300    On fleeter foot was never tied.    Speed, Malise, speed! such cause of haste    Thine active sinews never braced.    Bend 'gainst the steepy hill thy breast,    Burst down like torrent from its crest;                        305    With short and springing footstep pass    The trembling bog and false morass;    Across the brook like roebuck bound,    And thread the brake like questing hound;    The crag is high, the scar is deep,                            310    Yet shrink not from the desperate leap:    Parched are thy burning lips and brow.    Yet by the fountain pause not now;    Herald of battle, fate, and fear,    Stretch onward in thy fleet career!                            315    The wounded hind thou track'st not now,    Pursuest not maid through greenwood bough,    Nor pliest thou now thy flying pace,    With rivals in the mountain race;    But danger, death, and warrior deed,                           320    Are in thy course--speed, Malise, speed!      XIV      Fast as the fatal symbol flies,    In arms the huts and hamlets rise;    From winding glen, from upland brown,    They poured each hardy tenant down.                            325    Nor slacked the messenger his pace;    He showed the sign, he named the place,    And, pressing forward like the wind,    Left clamor and surprise behind.    The fisherman forsook the strand,                              330    The swarthy smith took dirk and brand;    With changed cheer, the mower blithe    Left in the half-cut swathe the scythe;    The herds without a keeper strayed,    The plow was in mid-furrow stayed,                             335    The falc'ner tossed his hawk away,    The hunter left the stag at bay;    Prompt at the signal of alarms,    Each son of Alpine rushed to arms;    So swept the tumult and affray                                 340    Along the margin of Achray.    Alas, thou lovely lake! that e'er    Thy banks should echo sounds of fear!    The rocks, the bosky thickets, sleep    So stilly on thy bosom deep,                                   345    The lark's blithe carol, from the cloud    Seems for the scene too gaily loud.      XV      Speed, Malise, speed! the lake is past,    Duncraggan's huts appear at last,    And peep, like moss-grown rocks, half seen,                    350    Half hidden in the copse so green;    There mayst thou rest, thy labor done,    Their Lord shall speed the signal on.    As stoops the hawk upon his prey,    The henchman shot him down the way.                            355    --What woeful accents load the gale?    The funeral yell, the female wail!    A gallant hunter's sport is o'er,    A valiant warrior fights no more.    Who, in the battle or the chase,                               360    At Roderick's side shall fill his place!--    Within the hall, where torches' ray    Supplies the excluded beams of day,    Lies Duncan on his lowly bier,    And o'er him streams his widow's tear.                         365    His stripling son stands mournful by,    His youngest weeps, but knows not why;    The village maids and matrons round    The dismal coronach resound.      XVI    CORONACH      He is gone on the mountain,                                    370      He is lost to the forest,    Like a summer-dried fountain,      When our need was the sorest.    The font, reappearing,      From the raindrops shall borrow,                             375    But to us comes no cheering,      To Duncan no morrow!      The hand of the reaper      Takes the ears that are hoary,    But the voice of the weeper                                    380      Wails manhood in glory.    The autumn winds rushing      Waft the leaves that are searest,    But our flower was in flushing,      When blighting was nearest.                                  385      Fleet foot on the correi,      Sage counsel in cumber,    Red hand in the foray,      How sound is thy slumber!    Like dew on the mountain,                                      390      Like the foam on the river,    Like the bubble on the fountain      Thou art gone, and forever!      XVII      See Stumah, who, the bier beside,    His master's corpse with wonder eyed--                         395    Poor Stumah! whom his least halloo    Could send like lightning o'er the dew,    Bristles his crest, and points his ears,    As if some stranger step he hears.    'Tis not a mourner's muffled tread,                            400    Who comes to sorrow o'er the dead,    But headlong haste, or deadly fear,    Urge the precipitate career.    All stand aghast--unheeding all,    The henchman bursts into the hall;                             405    Before the dead man's bier he stood;    Held forth the Cross besmeared with blood:    \"The muster-place is Lanrick mead;    Speed forth the signal! clansmen, speed!\"      XVIII      Angus, the heir of Duncan's line,                              410    Sprung forth and seized the fatal sign.    In haste the stripling to his side    His father's dirk and broadsword tied;    But when he saw his mother's eye    Watch him in speechless agony,                                 415    Back to her opened arms he flew,    Pressed on her lips a fond adieu--    \"Alas!\" she sobbed--\"and yet be gone,    And speed thee forth, like Duncan's son!\"    One look he cast upon the bier,                                420    Dashed from his eye the gathering tear,    Breathed deep to clear his laboring breast,    And tossed aloft his bonnet crest,    Then, like the high-bred colt, when, freed,    First he essays his fire and speed,                            425    He vanished, and o'er moor and moss    Sped forward with the Fiery"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2832"],[0,"Myth, Ritual and Religion, Vol. 1 (of 2) (#17)"],[1,"is not a mere idle fancy--it  influences conduct. \"A man does not kill or use as food any of the  animals of the same subdivision (Kroki or Kumite) with himself,  excepting when hunger compels, and then they express sorrow for having  to eat their wingong (friends) or tumanang (their flesh). When using the  last word they touch their breasts, to indicate the close relationship,  meaning almost a portion of themselves. To illustrate: One day one of  the blacks killed a crow. Three or four days afterwards a Boortwa (a man  of the crow surname and stock), named Larry, died. He had been ailing  for some days, but the killing of his wingong (totem) hastened his  death.\"(1) Commenting on this statement, Mr. Fison observes: \"The South  Australian savage looks upon the universe as the Great Tribe, to one  of whose divisions he himself belongs; and all things, animate and  inanimate, which belong to his class are parts of the body corporate  whereof he himself is part\". This account of the Australian beliefs and  customs is borne out, to a certain extent, by the evidence of Sir George  Grey,(2) and of the late Mr. Gideon Scott Lang.(3) These two writers  take no account of the singular \"dichotomous\" divisions, as of Kumite  and Kroki, but they draw attention to the groups of kindred which derive  their surnames from animals, plants, and the like. \"The origin of these  family names,\" says Sir George Grey, \"is attributed by the natives to  different causes.... One origin frequently assigned by the natives is,  that they were derived from some vegetable or animal being very common  in the district which the family inhabited.\" We have seen from  the evidence of Messrs. Fison and Howitt that a more common native  explanation is based on kinship with the vegetable or plant which  bestows the family surname. Sir George Gray mentions that the families  use their plant or animal as a crest or kobong (totem), and he adds that  natives never willingly kill animals of their kobong, holding that some  one of that species is their nearest friend. The consequences of eating  forbidden animals vary considerably. Sometimes the Boyl-yas (that is,  ghosts) avenge the crime. Thus when Sir George Grey ate some mussels  (which, after all, are not the crest of the Greys), a storm followed,  and one of his black fellow improvised this stave:--           Oh, wherefore did he eat the mussels?       Now the Boyl-yas storms and thunders make;       Oh, wherefore would he eat the mussels?      (1) Kamilaroi and Kurnai, p. 169.    (2) Travels, ii. 225.    (3) Lang, Lecture on Natives of Australia, p. 10.      There are two points in the arrangements of these stocks of kindred  named from plants and animals which we shall find to possess a high  importance. No member of any such kindred may marry a woman of the same  name and descended from the same object.(1) Thus no man of the Emu stock  may marry an Emu woman; no Blacksnake may marry a Blacksnake woman, and  so forth. This point is very strongly put by Mr. Dawson, who has had  much experience of the blacks. \"So strictly are the laws of marriage  carried out, that, should any sign of courtship or affection be observed  between those 'of one flesh,' the brothers or male relatives of the  woman beat her severely.\" If the incestuous pair (though not in the  least related according to our ideas) run away together, they are  \"half-killed\"; and if the woman dies in consequence of her punishment,  her partner in iniquity is beaten again. No \"eric\" or blood-fine of any  kind is paid for her death, which carries no blood-feud. \"Her punishment  is legal.\"(2) This account fully corroborates that of Sir George  Grey.(3)      (1) Taplin, The Nerrinyeri. p. 2. \"Every tribe, regarded by them as a  family, has its ngaitge, or tutelary genius or tribal symbol, in the  shape of some bird, beast, fish, reptile, insect, or substance. Between  individuals of the same tribe no marriage can take place.\" Among the  Narrinyeri kindred is reckoned (p. 10) on the father's side. See  also (p. 46) ngaitge = Samoan aitu. \"No man or woman will kill their  ngaitge,\" except with precautions, for food.    (2) Op. cit., p. 28.    (3) Ibid., ii. 220.      Our conclusion is that the belief in \"one flesh\" (a kinship shared  with the animals) must be a thoroughly binding idea, as the notion is  sanctioned by capital punishment.    Another important feature in Australian totemism strengthens our  position. The idea of the animal kinship must be an ancient one in the  race, because the family surname, Emu, Bandicoot, or what not, and the  crest, kobong, or protecting and kindred animal, are inherited through  the mother's side in the majority of stocks. This custom, therefore,  belongs to that early period of human society in which the woman is the  permanent and recognised factor in the family while male parentage is  uncertain.(1) One other feature of Australian totemism must be mentioned  before we leave the subject. There is some evidence that in certain  tribes the wingong or totem of each man is indicated by a tattooed  representation of it upon his flesh. The natives are very licentious,  but men would shrink from an amour with a woman who neither belonged to  their own district nor spoke their language, but who, in spite of that,  was of their totem. To avoid mistakes, it seems that some tribes mark  the totem on the flesh with incised lines.(2) The natives frequently  design figures of some kind on the trees growing near the graves of  deceased warriors. Some observers have fancied that in these designs  they recognised the totem of the dead men; but on this subject evidence  is by no means clear. We shall see that this primitive sort of heraldry,  this carving or painting of hereditary blazons, is common among the Red  Men of America.(3)      (1) Cf. Bachofen, Das Mutterrecht; M'Lennan, Primitive Marriage, passim;  Encycl. Brit. s. v. Family.    (2) Fison, op. cit., p. 66.    (3) Among other recent sources see Howitt in \"Organisation of Australian  Tribes\" (Transactions of Royal Society of Victoria, 1889), and Spencer  and Gillen, Natives of Central Australia. In Central Australia there is  a marked difference in the form of Totemism.      Though a large amount of evidence might be added to that already put  forward, we may now sum up the inferences to be drawn from the study  of totemism in Australia. It has been shown (1) that the natives think  themselves actually akin to animals, plants, the sun, and the wind, and  things in general; (2) that those ideas influence their conduct, and  even regulate their social arrangements, because (3) men and women of  the kinship of the same animal or plant may not intermarry, while men  are obliged to defend, and in case of murder to avenge, persons of the  stock of the family or plant from which they themselves derive their  family name. Thus, on the evidence of institutions, it is plain that  the Australians are (or before the influence of the Europeans became  prevalent were) in a state of mind which draws no hard and fast line  between man and the things in the world. If, therefore, we find that  in Australian myth, men, gods, beasts, and things all shift shapes  incessantly, and figure in a coroboree dance of confusion, there will  be nothing to astonish us in the discovery. The myths of men in the  Australian intellectual condition, of men who hold long conversations  with the little \"native bear,\" and ask him for oracles, will naturally  and inevitably be grotesque and confused.(1)      (1) Brough Smyth, i. 447, on MS. authority of W. Thomas.      It is \"a far cry\" from Australia to the West Coast of Africa, and it  is scarcely to be supposed that the Australians have borrowed ideas and  institutions from Ashantee, or that the people of Ashantee have derived  their conceptions of the universe from the Murri of Australia. We find,  however, on the West African Coast, just as we do in Australia, that  there exist large local divisions of the natives. These divisions are  spoken of by Mr. Bowditch (who visited the country on a mission in 1817)  as nations, and they are much more populous and powerful (as the people  are more civilised) than the local tribes of Australia. Yet, just as  among the local tribes of Australia, the nations of the West African  Coast are divided into stocks of kindred, each STOCK having its  representatives in each NATION. Thus an Ashantee or a Fantee may belong  to the same stock of kindred as a member of the Assin or Akini nation.  When an Ashantee of the Annona stock of kindred meets a Warsaw man of  the same stock they salute and acknowledge each other as brothers.  In the same way a Ballarat man of the Kangaroo stock in Australia  recognises a relative in a Mount Gambier man who is also a Kangaroo.  Now, with one exception, all the names of the twelve stocks of West  African kindreds, or at least all of them which Mr. Bowditch could get  the native interpreters to translate, are derived from animals, plants  and other natural objects, just as in Australia.(1) Thus Quonna is a  buffalo, Abrootoo is a cornstalk, Abbradi a plantain. Other names are,  in English, the parrot, the wild cat, red earth, panther and dog. Thus  all the natives of this part of Africa are parrots, dogs, buffaloes,  panthers, and so forth, just as the Australians are emus, iguanas, black  cockatoos, kangaroos, and the rest. It is remarkable that there is an  Incra stock, or clan of ants, in Ashantee, just as there was a race of  Myrmidons, believed to be descended from or otherwise connected with  ants, in ancient Greece. Though Bowditch's account of these West African  family divisions is brief, the arrangement tallies closely with that  of Australia. It is no great stretch of imagination to infer that the  African tribes do, or once did, believe themselves to be of the kindred  of the animals whose names they bear.(2) It is more or less confirmatory  of this hypothesis that "]]]
