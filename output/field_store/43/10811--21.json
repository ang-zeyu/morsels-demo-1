The Grantline crew shoved  close around us, tense and silent.    Above everything we must make some Earth station aware of our plight.  Conditions were against us. There were very few observers, in the  high-powered Earth stations who knew that an exploring party was on  the Moon. Perhaps none of them. The Government officials who had  sanctioned the expedition--and Halsey and his confreres in the  Detective Bureau--were not anticipating trouble now. The _Planetara_  was supposed to be well on her course to Ferrok-Shahn. It was when she  was due to return that Halsey would be alert.    And it seemed, too, that nature was against us. The bulging  half-Earth[1] hung poised near the zenith over our little crater. Its  rotation through the hours was clearly visible. We timed our signals  when the western hemisphere was facing us. But nature was against us.  No clouds, no faintest hint of mist could fog the airless Lunar  surface. But there were continuous clouds over the Americas.    [Footnote 1: Between the half and the full illumined disc, the  complete Earth now was some ten days old.]    \"Try it again,\" Snap urged.           *       *       *       *       *    These bulging walls! Grantline used his power far beyond the limits of  safety. He cut down his lights; the telescope intensifiers were  permanently disconnected; the ventilators were momentarily stilled, so  that the air here in the little room crowded with men rapidly grew  fetid. All to save power pressure, that the vital Erentz system might  survive.    Even so it was strained to the danger point. The walls seemed to bulge  outward with the pressure of the room, the aluminite braces straining  and creaking. And our heat was radiating away; the deadly chill of  space crept in.    \"Again!\" ordered Grantline.    The duty-man flung on the power in rhythmic pulses. In the silence the  tubes hissed. The light sprang through the banks of rotating prisms,  intensified up the scale until, with a vague, almost invisible beam,  it left the last swaying mirror and leaped through our overhead dome  into space.    \"Commander!\" The duty-man's voice carried an appeal. These bulging  walls! If they cracked, or even sprung a serious leak, the camp would  be uninhabitable....    \"Enough,\" said Grantline. \"Switch it off. We'll let it go at that for  now.\"    It seemed that every man in the room had been holding his breath in  the darkness. The lights came on again: the Erentz motors accelerated  to normal. The strain on the walls eased up, and the room began  warming.    Had the Earth caught our signal? We did not want to waste the power to  find out. Our receivers were disconnected. If an answering signal  came, we could not know it. One of the men said:    \"Let's assume they saw us.\" He laughed, but it was a high-pitched,  tense laugh. \"We don't dare even use the telescope. Our rescue ship  will be right overhead, visible to the naked eye before we see it.  Three days more--that's what I'll give it.\"           *       *       *       *       *    But the three days passed, and no rescue ship came. The Earth was  almost at the full. We tried signaling again. Perhaps it got  through--we did not know. But our power was weaker now. The wall of  one of the rooms sprang a leak, and the men were hours repairing it. I  did not say so, but never once did I feel that our signals were seen  on Earth. Those cursed clouds! The Earth almost everywhere seemed to  have poor visibility.    Four of our eight days of grace were all too soon passed. The brigand  ship must be half-way here by now.    They were busy days for us. If we could have captured Miko and his  band, our danger would have been less imminent. With the treasure  insulated so that its Gamma rays could not betray us, and our camp in  darkness, the arriving brigand ship might never find us. But Miko knew  our location: he would signal his oncoming ship when it was close and  lead it to us.    Three times during those days--and the days which followed  them--Grantline sent out searching parties. But it was unavailing.  Miko, Moa and Coniston, with their five underlings, could not be  found. We searched all the territory from the camp to the _Planetara_,  and off to the foot-crags of Archimedes, and a score of miles into the  flatness of the Mare Imbrium. There was no sign of the brigands. Yet  we knew they could be near here--it was so easy to hide amid the  tumbled crags, the ravines, the gullies, the numberless craters and  pit-holes: or underground in the vast honeycombed subterranean  recesses.           *       *       *       *       *    We had at first hoped that the brigands might have perished. But that  was soon dispelled! I went--about the third day--with the party that  was sent to the _Planetara_. We wanted to salvage such of its  equipment, its unbroken power units, as might be available. And Snap  and I had worked out an idea which we thought might be of service. We  needed some of the _Planetara's_ smaller gravity-plate sections. Those  in Grantline's wrecked little _Comet_ had stood so long that their  radiations had gone dead. But the _Planetara's_ were still  efficacious.    We secured the fragments of Newtonia.[2] But our hope that Miko might  have perished was dashed. He too had returned to the _Planetara_! The  evidence was clear before us. The vessel was stripped of all its power  units save those which were dead and useless. The last of the food and  water stores was taken. The weapons in the chart-room--the Benson  curve-lights, bullet projectors, and heat-rays--had vanished.    [Footnote 2: An allusion to the element Newtonia, named in memory of  the great founder of celestial mechanics, Sir Isaac Newton.  Artificially electronized, this metal element may be charged either  positively or negatively, thus to attract or repell other masses of  matter. The gravity plates of all space-ships were built of it.]    Other days passed. The Earth reached the full, and began waning. The  twenty-eight day Lunar night was in its last half. No rescue ship came  from Earth. We had ceased our efforts to signal, for we needed all our  power to maintain ourselves. The camp would be in a state of siege.  That was the best we could hope for. We had a few short-range weapons,  such as Bensons, heat-rays and rifles. A few hundred feet of effective  range was the most any of them could obtain. The heat-rays--in giant  form one of the most deadly weapons on Earth--were only slowly  efficacious on the airless Moon. Striking an intensely cold surface,  their warming radiations, without atmosphere to aid them, were slow  to act. Even in a blasting heat-beam a man in his Erentz helmet-suit  could withstand the ray for several minutes.           *       *       *       *       *    We were, however, well equipped with explosives. Grantline had brought  a large supply for his mining operations, and much of it was still  unused. We had, also, an ample stock of oxygen fuses, and a variety of  oxygen light flares in small fragile glass-globes.    It was to use these explosives against the brigands that Snap and I  were working out our scheme with the gravity-plates. The brigand ship  would come with giant projectors and with some thirty men. If we could  hold out against them for a time, the fact that the _Planetara_ was  missing would bring us help from Earth.    \"A month,\" said Grantline. \"A month at the most. If we can hold them  off that long--even in a week or two help may come.\"    Another day. A tenseness fell on us all, despite the absorption of our  feverish activities. To conserve the power, the camp was almost dark,  we lived in dim, chill rooms, with just a few weak spots of light  outside to mark the watchmen on their rounds. We did not use the  telescope,[3] but there was scarcely an hour when one or the other of  the men was not sitting on a cross-piece up in the dome of the little  instrument room, casting tense searching gaze into the black, starry  firmament. A ship might appear at any time now--a rescue ship from  Earth, or the brigands from Mars.           *       *       *       *       *    Anita and Venza during these days could aid us very little save by  their cheering words. They moved about the rooms, trying to inspire  us; so that all the men, when they might have been humanly sullen and  cursing their fate, were turned to grim activity, or grim laughter,  making a joke of this coming siege. The morale of the camp now was  perfect. An improvement indeed over the inactivity of the former  peaceful weeks!    [Footnote 3: An old-fashioned telescope, of limited field and needing  no electronic power, would have been immensely serviceable to  Grantline, but his was of the more modern type.]    Grantline mentioned it to me. \"We'll put up a good fight, Haljan.  These fellows from Mars will know they've had a task before they ever  sail off with this treasure.\"    I had many moments alone with Anita. I need not mention them. It  seemed that our love was crossed by the stars, with an adverse fate  dooming it. And Snap and Venza must have felt the same. Among the men  we were always quietly, grimly active. But alone.... I came upon Snap  once with his arms around the little Venus girl. I heard him say:    \"Accursed luck! That you and I should find each other too late, Venza.  We could have a mighty lot of fun in Great-New York together.\"    \"Snap, we will!\"    As I turned away, I murmured: \"And, pray God, so will Anita and I.\"    The girls slept together in a small room of the main building. Often  during the time of sleep, when the camp was stilled except for the  night watch, Snap and I would sit in the corridor near the girls'  door-grid, talking of that time when we would all be back on our  blessed Earth.           *       *       *       *       *    Our eight days of grace were passed. The brigand ship was due--now,  to-morrow, or the next day.    I recall,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29816"],[0,"The Industries of Animals (#17)"],[1,"out a certain number of preparatory acts,  and pushes foresight further than any other animal, since it looks  after its property while still growing. It is grain which these  insects collect, but only a single species of graminaceous grain. This  choice leads them to spend great trouble on their preferred plant.  They act in such a way that in the case of men we should say, purely  and simply, that they were cultivating. The art of treating the earth  with a view of augmenting the products which it yields is certainly of  all the manifestations of human activity that which we should least  expect to find among animals. It is, however, impossible otherwise to  describe the conduct of Agricultural Ants. The field which they  prepare is found in front of their ant-hill; it is a terrace in extent  about a square metre or more; there they will allow no other plant to  grow but that from which they propose to gather fruit. This latter  (_Aristida stricta_) is rather like a grain of oats, and in taste  resembles rice; in America it is called ant rice. This culture  represents for these insects a much more important property than a  wheat field for man. It is, in relation to their size, a forest  planted with great trees, in comparison with which baobabs and  sequoias are dwarfs. It is not known if the _Pogonomyrmex_ sow their  rice; Lincecum asserted that the ants actually sow the seeds, that he  had seen the process going on year after year; \"there can be no  doubt,\" he concludes, \"of the fact that this particular species of  grass is intentionally planted, and in farmer-like manner carefully  divested of all other grasses and weeds during the time of its  growth.\"[58] McCook is not able to accept this unqualified conclusion.  \"I do not believe that the ants deliberately sow a crop, as Lincecum  asserts, but that they have, for some reason, found it to their  advantage to permit the _Aristida_ to grow upon their disks, while  they clear off all other herbage; that the crop is seeded yearly in a  natural way by droppings from the plant, or by seeds cast out by the  ants, or dropped by them; that the probable reason for protecting the  _Aristida_ is the greater convenience of harvesting the seed; but,  finally, that there is nothing unreasonable, nor beyond the probable  capacity of the emmet intellect, in the supposition that the crop is  actually sown. Simply, it is the Scotch verdict--Not proven.\"[59]  However it may be, they certainly allow no other plant to grow in the  neighbourhood of their grain, to withdraw the nourishment which they  wish to reserve entirely for it. Properly speaking, they weed their  field, cutting off with their jaws all the troublesome plants which  appear above the soil. They pursue this labour very diligently, and no  strange shoot escapes their investigations. Thus cared for, their  culture flourishes, and at the epoch of maturity the grains are  collected one by one and carried within. Like all harvesters, these  Hymenoptera are at the mercy of a shower that may fall during the  harvest. They are well aware that in this case their provisions would  be damaged, and that they would run the risk of germination or decay  in the barns. Therefore, on the first sunny day all the ants, as  observed by Lincecum and Buckley, may be seen carrying their grains  outside, only bringing them back when they have been thoroughly dried,  and always leaving behind those that have sprouted.[60]       [58] Lincecum's most important published paper on the habits          of the _Myrmica molefaciens_ appeared in the _Proc. Acad.          Nat. Sci. Philadelphia_, vol. xviii., 1866, p. 323-331. See          also Darwin, _Proceedings of the Linnaean Soc._, 1861.       [59] H. C. McCook, _Natural History of the Agricultural Ants          of Texas_, Philadelphia, 1879, pp. 33-39.       [60] McCook, _Agricultural Ants of Texas_, pp. 105-107.    _Gardening Ants._--The Leaf-cutting Ants (_Oecodoma_) of tropical  America are often alluded to by travellers on account of their ravages  on vegetation; and they are capable of destroying whole plantations of  orange, mango, and lemon trees. They climb the tree, station  themselves on the edge of a leaf and make a circular incision with  their scissor-like jaws; the piece of leaf, about the size of a  sixpence, held vertically between the jaws, is then borne off to the  formicarium. This consists of low wide mounds, in the neighbourhood of  which no vegetation is allowed, probably in order that the ventilation  of the underground galleries may not be interfered with.    For a long time there was considerable doubt as to the use to which  the leaf-cutting ants put the leaves; some naturalists supposed they  are used directly as food, others that the ants roof their underground  dwellings with them. The question was set at rest by Fritz Mueller, who  observed these ants in Brazil,[61] and independently by Belt, who  studied them in Nicaragua, and has written an interesting account of  their proceedings.[62] The real use of the leaves is as manure on  which to grow a minute species of fungus; these ants are, in reality,  mushroom growers and eaters. Belt several times exposed the  underground chambers to observation and found that they were always  about three parts filled with \"a speckled, brown, flocculent,  spongy-looking mass of a light and loosely-connected substance.\"  Scattered throughout these masses were the pupae and larvae, together  with the smallest division of workers who do not engage in  leaf-carrying, but whose duties appear to be to cut up the leaves into  small fragments and to care for the young. On examination the masses  proved to be composed of \"minutely sub-divided pieces of leaves,  withered to a brown colour, and overgrown and lightly connected  together by a minute white fungus that ramified in every direction  throughout it.\" That they do not eat the leaves themselves was shown  by the fact that near the tenanted chambers were found deserted ones  filled with the refuse of leaves that had been exhausted as manure,  and which served as food for the larvae of various beetles. There are  numerous holes leading up from the underground chambers, and these are  opened out or closed up, apparently in order to regulate the  temperature below. Great care is also taken that the nest should be  neither too dry nor too damp; if a sudden shower comes on the leaves  are left near the entrance, and carried down when nearly dry; during  very hot weather, on the other hand, when the leaves would be parched  in a very short time, the ants only work in the cool of the day and  during the night. Occasionally, inexperienced ants carry in grass and  unsuitable leaves; these are invariably brought out again and thrown  away.[63]       [61] _Nature_, 11th June 1874. And see Appendix.       [62] _Naturalist in Nicaragua_, 2nd edition, 1888, pp. 71-84.       [63] For a brief discussion of the relation of ants to          plants generally, see Lubbock's _Ants, Bees, and Wasps_,          1882, chap. iii.    _Domestic animals of Ants._--Following through different species the  perfection reached in the art of laying up provisions for the future,  we have gradually arrived at methods resembling those of Man. But a  foresight still greater and nearer to his is manifested by those ants  who breed and keep near them animals of different species, not for the  sake of their flesh, but for certain secretions, just as man utilises  the milk of the cow or the goat. Ants have true domestic animals  belonging to a variety of species, but the most widely spread are the  _Claviger_ and the Aphides or plant-lice. To keep these insects at  their disposal, Hymenoptera act in various ways: some, who are a  little experienced, are content to take advantage of a free aphis  which chance may put in their way; others shut up their cattle in  stables situated in the midst of the ant-hill, or else pen them in the  country at a spot where they can best find their food. These facts  have long since been carefully studied and leave no room for doubt.    The _Claviger testaceus_ is a small beetle, often met in the dwellings  of ants. Nature has not been very generous on its behalf. It is blind,  and its eyes are indeed altogether atrophied. The elytra are soldered  at the median edge, so that it cannot spread its wings to fly. It is  an animal predestined to the yoke; and for the rest its masters treat  it with extreme kindness. The yellow ants, according to Mueller,[64]  have reduced this outcast beetle to domesticity, and it is almost a  piece of good fortune for him to have lost his freedom and to have  gained in exchange a shelter and a well-furnished trough. These  insects are in fact cared for by their masters, who feed them by  disgorging into their mouths the sweet liquids they have gathered here  and there. If a nest is disturbed the ants hasten to carry their eggs  and larvae out of danger; they display the same solicitude with regard  to the _Claviger_, and carefully bear them to the depth of their  galleries. It must not be believed that the practical insect takes so  much care in order to repair the injustice of nature towards the  beetle; the part of a devoted sick nurse would not suit him; he cares  for the _Claviger_ because it is his property, a capital which brings  in interest in the shape of excellent sweet little drops which are  good to suck.[65]       [64] Ph.

[65] There is little doubt, however, that some species of          Aphides and allied Coccidae would be liable to extermination          if not protected by their ant masters. See, for instance,          Forel, _Bull. Soc. Vaud._, 1876. Mr. Cockerell in Jamaica          has noted an interesting Coccid, _Icerya rosae_, which is          protected by ants; \"at"]]]
