I have received letters     from Eugène and Hortense. I am delighted with the children. I will     send you their letters as soon as I am joined by my household, which     is now somewhat dispersed.       We have made five thousand prisoners, and killed at least six     thousand of the enemy. Adieu, my adorable Josephine. Think of me     often. When you cease to love your Achilles, when your heart grows     cool towards him, you wilt be very cruel, very unjust. But I am     sure you will always continue my faithful mistress, as I shall ever     remain your fond lover ('tendre amie'). Death alone can break the     union which sympathy, love, and sentiment have formed. Let me have     news of your health. A thousand and a thousand kisses.    It is impossible for me to avoid occasionally placing myself in the  foreground in the course of these Memoirs. I owe it to myself to answer,  though indirectly, to certain charges which, on various occasions, have  been made against me. Some of the documents which I am about to insert  belong, perhaps, less to the history of the General-in-Chief of the army  of-Italy than to that of his secretary; but I must confess I wish  to show that I was not an intruder, nor yet pursuing, as an obscure  intriguer, the path of fortune. I was influenced much more by friendship  than by ambition when I took a part on the scene where the rising-glory  of the future Emperor already shed a lustre on all who were attached  to his destiny. It will be seen by the following letters with what  confidence I was then honoured; but these letters, dictated by  friendship, and not written for history, speak also of our military  achievements; and whatever brings to recollection the events of that  heroic period must still be interesting to many.                          HEADQUARTERS AT MILAN,                 20th Prairial, year IV. (8th June 1796).       The General-in-Chief has ordered me, my dear Bourrienne, to make     known to you the pleasure he experienced on hearing of you, and his     ardent desire that you should join us. Take your departure, then,     my dear Bourrienne, and arrive quickly. You may be certain of     obtaining the testimonies of affection which are your due from all     who know you; and we much regret that you were not with us to have a     share in our success. The campaign which we have just concluded     will be celebrated in the records of history. With less than 30,000     men, in a state of almost complete destitution, it is a fine thing     to have, in the course of less than two months, beaten, eight     different times, an army of from 65 to 70,000 men, obliged the King     of Sardinia to make a humiliating peace, and driven the Austrians     from Italy. The last victory, of which you have doubtless had an     account, the passage of the Mincio, has closed our labours. There     now remain for us the siege of Mantua and the castle of Milan; but     these obstacles will not detain us long. Adieu, my dear Bourrienne:     I repeat General Bonaparte's request that you should repair hither,     and the testimony of his desire to see you.     Receive, etc.,                (Signed) MARMONT.     Chief of Brigade (Artillery) and Aide de camp to the     General-in-Chief.    I was obliged to remain at Sens, soliciting my erasure from the emigrant  list, which I did not obtain, however, till 1797, and to put an end to a  charge made against me of having fabricated a certificate of residence.  Meanwhile I applied myself to study, and preferred repose to the  agitation of camps. For these reasons I did not then accept his friendly  invitation, notwithstanding that I was very desirous of seeing my young  college friend in the midst of his astonishing triumphs. Ten months  after, I received another letter from Marmont, in the following terms:--                        HEADQUARTERS GORIZIA               2d Germinal, year V. (22d March 1797).       The General-in-Chief, my dear Bourrienne, has ordered me to express     to you his wish for your prompt arrival here. We have all along     anxiously desired to see you, and look forward with great pleasure     to the moment when we shall meet. I join with the General, my dear     Bourrienne, in urging you to join the army without loss of time.     You will increase a united family, happy to receive you into its     bosom. I enclose an order written by the General, which will serve     you as a passport. Take the post route and arrive as soon as you     can. We are on the point of penetrating into Germany. The language     is changing already, and in four days we shall hear no more Italian.     Prince Charles has been well beaten, and we are pursuing him. If     this campaign be fortunate, we may sign a peace, which is so     necessary for Europe, in Vienna. Adieu, my dear Bourrienne: reckon     for something the zeal of one who is much attached to you.                      (Signed) MARMONT.         BONAPARTE, GENERAL-IN-CHIEF OF THE ARMY OF ITALY.         Headquarters, Gorizia, 2d Germinal, year V.       The citizen Bourrienne is to come to me on receipt     of the present order.                 (Signed) BONAPARTE.    The odious manner in which I was then harassed, I know not why, on the  part of the Government respecting my certificate of residence, rendered  my stay in France not very agreeable. I was even threatened with being  put on my trial for having produced a certificate of residence which was  alleged to be signed by nine false witnesses. This time, therefore, I  resolved without hesitation to set out for the army. General Bonaparte's  order, which I registered at the municipality of Sens, answered for a  passport, which otherwise would probably have been refused me. I have  always felt a strong sense of gratitude for his conduct towards me on  this occasion.    Notwithstanding the haste I made to leave Sens, the necessary  formalities and precautions detained me some days, and at the moment I  was about to depart I received the following letter:                        HEADQUARTERS, JUDENBOURG,               19th Germinal, Year V. (8th April 1797).       The General-in-Chief again orders me, my dear Bourrienne, to urge     you to come to him quickly. We are in the midst of success and     triumphs. The German campaign begins even more brilliantly than did     the Italian. You may judge, therefore, what a promise it holds out     to us. Come, my dear Bourrienne, immediately--yield to our     solicitations--share our pains and pleasures, and you will add to     our enjoyments.       I have directed the courier to pass through Sens, that he may     deliver this letter to you, and bring me back your answer.                    (Signed) MARMONT.    To the above letter this order was subjoined:         The citizen Fauvelet de Bourrienne is ordered to leave Sens, and     repair immediately by post to the headquarters of the army of Italy.                    (Signed) BONAPARTE.    I arrived at the Venetian territory at the moment when the insurrection  against the French was on the point of breaking out. Thousands of  peasants were instigated to rise under the pretext of appeasing the  troubles of Bergamo and Brescia. I passed through Verona on the 16th of  April, the eve of the signature of the preliminaries of Leoben and of  the revolt of Verona. Easter Sunday was the day which the ministers  of Jesus Christ selected for preaching \"that it was lawful, and even  meritorious, to kill Jacobins.\" Death to Frenchmen!--Death to Jacobins!  as they called all the French, were their rallying cries. At the time I  had not the slightest idea of this state of things, for I had left Sens  only on the 11th of April.    After stopping two hours at Verona, I proceeded on my journey without  being aware of the massacre which threatened that city. When about a  league from the town I was, however, stopped by a party of insurgents  on their way thither, consisting, as I estimated, of about two thousand  men. They only desired me to cry 'El viva Santo Marco', an order with  which I speedily complied, and passed on. What would have become of me  had I been in Verona on the Monday? On that day the bells were rung,  while the French were butchered in the hospitals. Every one met in the  streets was put to death. The priests headed the assassins, and more  than four hundred Frenchmen were thus sacrificed. The forts held  out against the Venetians, though they attacked them with fury; but  repossession of the town was not obtained until after ten days. On the  very day of the insurrection of Verona some Frenchmen were assassinated  between that city and Vicenza, through which I passed on the day before  without danger; and scarcely had I passed through Padua, when I learned  that others had been massacred there. Thus the assassinations travelled  as rapidly as the post.    I shall say a few words respecting the revolt of the Venetian States,  which, in consequence of the difference of political opinions, has been  viewed in very contradictory lights.    The last days of Venice were approaching, and a storm had been brewing  for more than a year. About the beginning of April 1797 the threatening  symptoms of a general insurrection appeared. The quarrel commenced when  the Austrians entered Peschiera, and some pretext was also afforded by  the reception given to Monsieur, afterwards Louis XVIII. It was certain  that Venice had made military preparations during the siege of Mantua  in 1796. The interests of the aristocracy outweighed the political  considerations in our favour. On, the 7th of June 1796 General Bonaparte  wrote thus to the Executive Directory:         The Senate of Venice lately sent two judges of their Council here to     ascertain definitively how things stand. I repeated my complaints.     I spoke to them about the reception given to Monsieur.

Everything loose on the earth seeks its rest on the earth, why  should not the whole earth itself be at rest?    5. We always see half of the heavens and the fixed stars also in a  great half circle, which we could not see if the earth moved, and  especially if it declined to the north and south....    6. A stone or an arrow shot straight up falls straight down. But if  the earth turned under it, from west to east, it must fall west of its  starting point.    7. In such revolutions houses and towers would fall in heaps.    8. High and low tide could not exist; the flying of birds and the  swimming of fish would be hindered and all would be in a state of  dizziness.      Reasons for the belief that the earth is moved:    1. The sun, the most excellent, the greatest and the midmost star,  rightly stands still like a king while all the other stars with the  earth swing round it.    2. That you believe that the heavens revolve is due to ocular  deception similar to that of a man on a ship leaving shore.    3. That Joshua bade the sun stand still Moses wrote for the people in  accordance with the popular misconception.    4. As the planets are each a special created thing in the heavens, so  the earth is a similar creation and similarly revolves.    5. The sun fitly rests at the center as the heart does in the middle  of the human body.    6. Since the earth has in itself its especial _centrum_, a stone or an  arrow falls freely out of the air again to its own _centrum_ as do all  earthly things.    7. The earth can move five miles in a second more readily than the sun  can go forty miles in the same time.    And similarly on both sides.[325]    [Footnote 322: Schotto: _Organum Mathematicum_ (1667).]    [Footnote 323: Voight: _Der Kunstguenstigen Einfalt Mathematischer  Raritaeten Erstes Hundert_. (Hamburg, 1667).]    [Footnote 324: Voight: _op. cit._: 28.]    [Footnote 325: Ibid: 30-31.]    Another writer preferring the Tychonic scheme was Longomontanus, whose  _Astronomica Danica_ (Amsterdam, 1640) upheld this theory because it  \"obviates the absurdities of the Copernican hypothesis and most aptly  corresponds to celestial appearances,\" and also because it is \"midway  between that and the Ptolemaic one.\"[326] Even though he speaks of the  \"apparent motion of the sun,\" he attributed diurnal motion to the  heavens, and believed the earth was at the center of the universe  because (1), from the account of the Creation, the heaven and the  earth were first created, and what could be more likely than that the  heavens should fill the space between the center (the earth) and the  circumference? (2) and because of the incredibly enormous interval  between the sphere of the fixed stars and the earth necessitated by  Copernican doctrine.[327]    [Footnote 326: Longomontanus: _Op. cit._: 162.]    [Footnote 327: Longomontanus: _Op. cit._: 158.]    The high-water mark of opposition after Galileo's condemnation was  reached in the _Almagestum Novum_ (Bologna, 1651) by Father Riccioli  of the Society of Jesus. It was the authoritative answer of that  order, the leaders of the Church in matters of education, to the  challenges of the literary world for a justification of the  condemnation of the Copernican doctrine and of Galileo for upholding  it. Father Riccioli had been professor of philosophy and of  mathematics for six years and of theology for ten when by order of his  superiors, he was released from his lectureship to prepare a book  containing all the material he could gather together on this great  controversy of the age.[328] He wrote it as he himself said, as \"an  _apologia_ for the Sacred Congregation of the Cardinals who officially  pronounced these condemnations, not so much because I thought such  great height and eminence needed this at my hands but especially in  behalf of Catholics; also out of the love of truth to which every  non-Catholic, even, should be persuaded and from a certain notable  zeal and eagerness for the preservation of the Sacred Scriptures  intact and unimpaired; and lastly because of that reverence and  devotion which I owe from my particular position toward the Holy,  Catholic and Apostolic Church.\"[329]    [Footnote 328: Riccioli: _Alm. Nov._: Praefatio, I, xviii.]    [Footnote 329: Riccioli: _Alm. Nov._: II, 496.]    This monumental work, the most important literary production of the  Society in the 17th century,[330] is abundant witness to Riccioli's  remarkable erudition and industry. Nearly one-fifth of the total bulk  of the two huge volumes is devoted to a statement of the Copernican  controversy. This is prefaced by a brief account of his own theory of  the universe--the invention of which is another proof of the ability  of the man--for his scientific training prevented his acceptance of  the Aristotelian-Ptolemaic theory in the light of Galileo's  discoveries; his position as a Jesuit and a faithful son of the Church  precluded him from adopting the system condemned by its  representatives; and Tycho Brahe's scheme was not wholly to his  liking. Therefor he proposed an adaptation of the last-named, more in  accordance, as he thought, with the facts.[331] Where Tycho had all  the planets except the earth and the moon encircle the sun, and that  in turn, together with the moon and the sphere of the fixed stars,  sweep around the earth as the center of the universe, Riccioli made  only Mars, Mercury and Venus encircle the sun,--Mars with an orbit the  radius of which included the earth within its sweep, the other two  planets with orbital radii shorter than that of the sun, and so  excluding the earth. This he did, (1) because both Jupiter and Saturn  have their own kingdoms in the heavens, and Mars, Mercury and Venus  are but satellites of the sun; (2) because there are greater varieties  of eccentricity among these three than the other two; (3) because  Saturn and Jupiter are the greatest planets and with the sphere of the  fixed stars move more slowly; (4) Mars belongs with the sun because of  their related movements; and (5) because it is likely that one of the  planets would have much in common both with Saturn and Jupiter and  with Mercury and Venus also.[332]    [Footnote 330: _Cath. Ency._: \"Riccioli,\" and Walsh: Catholic  Churchmen in Science: 200. (2nd series, 1909.)]    [Footnote 331: Riccioli: _Alm. Nov._: II, 288-289; see frontispiece.]    [Footnote 332: Riccioli: _Alm. Nov._: II, 288-289; see frontispiece.]    Then he takes up the attack upon the Copernican doctrine. M. Delambre  summarizes and comments upon 57 of his arguments against it,[333] and  Riccioli himself claims[334] to have stated \"40 new arguments in  behalf of Copernicus and 77 against him.\" But these sound somewhat  familiar to the reader of anti-Copernican literature: as, for  instance, \"which is more natural, straight or circular movement?\" Or,  the Copernican argument that movement is easier if the object moved is  smaller involves a matter of Faith since it implies a question of  God's power; for to God all is alike, there is no hard nor easy.[335]  Although diurnal movement is useful to the earth alone and so,  according to the Copernicans, the earth should have the labor of it,  Riccioli argues that everything was created for man; let the stars  revolve around him. The sun may be nobler than the earth, but man is  nobler than the sun.[336] If the earth's movement were admitted,  Ptolemy's defense would be broken down through the elimination of the  epicycles of the superior planets: here, if ever, the Copernicans  appear to score, as Riccioli himself admits,[337] but he calls to his  aid Tycho Brahe and the Bible. \"To invoke such aids is to avow his  defeat\" is M. Delambre's comment at this point.[338] There are many  more arguments, of which the foregoing are but instances chosen more  or less at random; but no one of them is of especial weight or  novelty.    [Footnote 333: Delambre: _Astr. Mod._: I, 674-680.]    [Footnote 334: Riccioli: _Apologia_: 2.]    [Footnote 335: Riccioli: _Alm. Nov._: II, 313, 315.]    [Footnote 336: Riccioli: _Alm. Nov._: II, 330-351.]    [Footnote 337: Ibid: II, 339-340.]    [Footnote 338: Delambre: _Op. cit._: I, 677.]    To strengthen his case, Riccioli listed the supporters of the  heliocentric doctrine throughout the ages, with those of the opposite  view. If a man's fame adds to the weight of his opinion, the modern  reader will be inclined to think the Copernicans have the best of it,  for omitting the ancients, most of those opposing it are obscure  men.[339]    [Footnote 339: Ibid: I, 673.]      In favor of the Copernican doctrine [references omitted].[340]      Copernicus    Rheticus    Maestlin    Kepler    Rothman    Galileo    Gilbert (diurnal motion)    Foscarini    Didacus Stunica (_sic_)    Ismael Bullialdus    Jacob Lansberg    Peter Herigonus    Gassendi,--\"but submits his intellect captive to the Church decrees.\"    Descartes \"inclines to this belief.\"    A.L.

After a full statement of it, he comments: \"We have not yet exhausted  the full profundities of the Copernican hypothesis, for the deeper one  digs into it, the "]]]
