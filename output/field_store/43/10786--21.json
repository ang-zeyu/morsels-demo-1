But she nevertheless made no scruple of abounding  in her cousin's sense and pretending to sigh for the charms of her  native land. She would be as American as it pleased him to regard her,  and if he chose to laugh at her she would give him plenty of occupation.  She defended England against his mother, but when Ralph sang its praises  on purpose, as she said, to work her up, she found herself able to  differ from him on a variety of points. In fact, the quality of this  small ripe country seemed as sweet to her as the taste of an October  pear; and her satisfaction was at the root of the good spirits which  enabled her to take her cousin's chaff and return it in kind. If her  good-humour flagged at moments it was not because she thought herself  ill-used, but because she suddenly felt sorry for Ralph. It seemed to  her he was talking as a blind and had little heart in what he said. \"I  don't know what's the matter with you,\" she observed to him once; \"but I  suspect you're a great humbug.\"    \"That's your privilege,\" Ralph answered, who had not been used to being  so crudely addressed.    \"I don't know what you care for; I don't think you care for anything.  You don't really care for England when you praise it; you don't care for  America even when you pretend to abuse it.\"    \"I care for nothing but you, dear cousin,\" said Ralph.    \"If I could believe even that, I should be very glad.\"    \"Ah well, I should hope so!\" the young man exclaimed.    Isabel might have believed it and not have been far from the truth. He  thought a great deal about her; she was constantly present to his mind.  At a time when his thoughts had been a good deal of a burden to him her  sudden arrival, which promised nothing and was an open-handed gift of  fate, had refreshed and quickened them, given them wings and something  to fly for. Poor Ralph had been for many weeks steeped in melancholy;  his outlook, habitually sombre, lay under the shadow of a deeper cloud.  He had grown anxious about his father, whose gout, hitherto confined to  his legs, had begun to ascend into regions more vital. The old man had  been gravely ill in the spring, and the doctors had whispered to  Ralph that another attack would be less easy to deal with. Just now  he appeared disburdened of pain, but Ralph could not rid himself of a  suspicion that this was a subterfuge of the enemy, who was waiting to  take him off his guard. If the manoeuvre should succeed there would be  little hope of any great resistance. Ralph had always taken for granted  that his father would survive him--that his own name would be the first  grimly called. The father and son had been close companions, and the  idea of being left alone with the remnant of a tasteless life on his  hands was not gratifying to the young man, who had always and tacitly  counted upon his elder's help in making the best of a poor business.  At the prospect of losing his great motive Ralph lost indeed his one  inspiration. If they might die at the same time it would be all very  well; but without the encouragement of his father's society he should  barely have patience to await his own turn. He had not the incentive of  feeling that he was indispensable to his mother; it was a rule with his  mother to have no regrets. He bethought himself of course that it had  been a small kindness to his father to wish that, of the two, the active  rather than the passive party should know the felt wound; he remembered  that the old man had always treated his own forecast of an early end as  a clever fallacy, which he should be delighted to discredit so far as  he might by dying first. But of the two triumphs, that of refuting a  sophistical son and that of holding on a while longer to a state of  being which, with all abatements, he enjoyed, Ralph deemed it no sin to  hope the latter might be vouchsafed to Mr. Touchett.    These were nice questions, but Isabel's arrival put a stop to his  puzzling over them. It even suggested there might be a compensation for  the intolerable ennui of surviving his genial sire. He wondered whether  he were harbouring \"love\" for this spontaneous young woman from Albany;  but he judged that on the whole he was not. After he had known her for  a week he quite made up his mind to this, and every day he felt a little  more sure. Lord Warburton had been right about her; she was a really  interesting little figure. Ralph wondered how their neighbour had  found it out so soon; and then he said it was only another proof of his  friend's high abilities, which he had always greatly admired. If his  cousin were to be nothing more than an entertainment to him, Ralph was  conscious she was an entertainment of a high order. \"A character like  that,\" he said to himself--\"a real little passionate force to see at  play is the finest thing in nature. It's finer than the finest work  of art--than a Greek bas-relief, than a great Titian, than a Gothic  cathedral. It's very pleasant to be so well treated where one had least  looked for it. I had never been more blue, more bored, than for a week  before she came; I had never expected less that anything pleasant would  happen. Suddenly I receive a Titian, by the post, to hang on my wall--a  Greek bas-relief to stick over my chimney-piece. The key of a beautiful  edifice is thrust into my hand, and I'm told to walk in and admire. My  poor boy, you've been sadly ungrateful, and now you had better keep very  quiet and never grumble again.\" The sentiment of these reflexions was  very just; but it was not exactly true that Ralph Touchett had had a key  put into his hand. His cousin was a very brilliant girl, who would take,  as he said, a good deal of knowing; but she needed the knowing, and his  attitude with regard to her, though it was contemplative and critical,  was not judicial. He surveyed the edifice from the outside and admired  it greatly; he looked in at the windows and received an impression of  proportions equally fair. But he felt that he saw it only by glimpses  and that he had not yet stood under the roof. The door was fastened, and  though he had keys in his pocket he had a conviction that none of them  would fit. She was intelligent and generous; it was a fine free nature;  but what was she going to do with herself? This question was irregular,  for with most women one had no occasion to ask it. Most women did  with themselves nothing at all; they waited, in attitudes more or less  gracefully passive, for a man to come that way and furnish them with  a destiny. Isabel's originality was that she gave one an impression of  having intentions of her own. \"Whenever she executes them,\" said Ralph,  \"may I be there to see!\"    It devolved upon him of course to do the honours of the place. Mr.  Touchett was confined to his chair, and his wife's position was that of  rather a grim visitor; so that in the line of conduct that opened itself  to Ralph duty and inclination were harmoniously mixed. He was not a  great walker, but he strolled about the grounds with his cousin--a  pastime for which the weather remained favourable with a persistency not  allowed for in Isabel's somewhat lugubrious prevision of the climate;  and in the long afternoons, of which the length was but the measure of  her gratified eagerness, they took a boat on the river, the dear little  river, as Isabel called it, where the opposite shore seemed still a  part of the foreground of the landscape; or drove over the country in a  phaeton--a low, capacious, thick-wheeled phaeton formerly much used by  Mr. Touchett, but which he had now ceased to enjoy. Isabel enjoyed it  largely and, handling the reins in a manner which approved itself to  the groom as \"knowing,\" was never weary of driving her uncle's capital  horses through winding lanes and byways full of the rural incidents she  had confidently expected to find; past cottages thatched and timbered,  past ale-houses latticed and sanded, past patches of ancient common and  glimpses of empty parks, between hedgerows made thick by midsummer. When  they reached home they usually found tea had been served on the lawn  and that Mrs. Touchett had not shrunk from the extremity of handing her  husband his cup. But the two for the most part sat silent; the old  man with his head back and his eyes closed, his wife occupied with her  knitting and wearing that appearance of rare profundity with which some  ladies consider the movement of their needles.    One day, however, a visitor had arrived. The two young persons, after  spending an hour on the river, strolled back to the house and perceived  Lord Warburton sitting under the trees and engaged in conversation, of  which even at a distance the desultory character was appreciable, with  Mrs. Touchett. He had driven over from his own place with a portmanteau  and had asked, as the father and son often invited him to do, for a  dinner and a lodging. Isabel, seeing him for half an hour on the day of  her arrival, had discovered in this brief space that she liked him; he  had indeed rather sharply registered himself on her fine sense and  she had thought of him several times. She had hoped she should see him  again--hoped too that she should see a few others. Gardencourt was not  dull; the place itself was sovereign, her uncle was more and more a  sort of golden grandfather, and Ralph was unlike any cousin she had  ever encountered--her idea of cousins having tended to gloom. Then her  impressions were still so fresh and so quickly renewed that there was as  yet hardly a hint of vacancy in the view. But Isabel had need to remind  herself that she was interested in human nature and that her foremost  hope in coming abroad had been that she should see a great many people.  When Ralph said to her, as he had done several times, \"I wonder you find  this endurable; you ought to see some of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2834"],[0,"The Portrait of a Lady â€” Volume 2 (#17)"],[1,"happen! She was ready--she had been ready always, waiting  for him to speak. If he had not spoken she would have waited for ever;  but when the word came she dropped like the peach from the shaken tree.  Rosier felt that if he should draw her toward him and hold her to his  heart she would submit without a murmur, would rest there without a  question. It was true that this would be a rash experiment in a yellow  Empire salottino. She had known it was for her he came, and yet like  what a perfect little lady she had carried it off!    \"You're very dear to me,\" he murmured, trying to believe that there was  after all such a thing as hospitality.    She looked a moment at her hand, where he had kissed it. \"Did you say  papa knows?\"    \"You told me just now he knows everything.\"    \"I think you must make sure,\" said Pansy.    \"Ah, my dear, when once I'm sure of YOU!\" Rosier murmured in her ear;  whereupon she turned back to the other rooms with a little air of  consistency which seemed to imply that their appeal should be immediate.    The other rooms meanwhile had become conscious of the arrival of Madame  Merle, who, wherever she went, produced an impression when she entered.  How she did it the most attentive spectator could not have told you, for  she neither spoke loud, nor laughed profusely, nor moved rapidly, nor  dressed with splendour, nor appealed in any appreciable manner to the  audience. Large, fair, smiling, serene, there was something in her very  tranquillity that diffused itself, and when people looked round it was  because of a sudden quiet. On this occasion she had done the quietest  thing she could do; after embracing Mrs. Osmond, which was more  striking, she had sat down on a small sofa to commune with the master  of the house. There was a brief exchange of commonplaces between these  two--they always paid, in public, a certain formal tribute to the  commonplace--and then Madame Merle, whose eyes had been wandering, asked  if little Mr. Rosier had come this evening.    \"He came nearly an hour ago--but he has disappeared,\" Osmond said.    \"And where's Pansy?\"    \"In the other room. There are several people there.\"    \"He's probably among them,\" said Madame Merle.    \"Do you wish to see him?\" Osmond asked in a provokingly pointless tone.    Madame Merle looked at him a moment; she knew each of his tones to the  eighth of a note. \"Yes, I should like to say to him that I've told you  what he wants, and that it interests you but feebly.\"    \"Don't tell him that. He'll try to interest me more--which is exactly  what I don't want. Tell him I hate his proposal.\"    \"But you don't hate it.\"    \"It doesn't signify; I don't love it. I let him see that, myself, this  evening; I was rude to him on purpose. That sort of thing's a great  bore. There's no hurry.\"    \"I'll tell him that you'll take time and think it over.\"    \"No, don't do that. He'll hang on.\"    \"If I discourage him he'll do the same.\"    \"Yes, but in the one case he'll try to talk and explain--which would be  exceedingly tiresome. In the other he'll probably hold his tongue and go  in for some deeper game. That will leave me quiet. I hate talking with a  donkey.\"    \"Is that what you call poor Mr. Rosier?\"    \"Oh, he's a nuisance--with his eternal majolica.\"    Madame Merle dropped her eyes; she had a faint smile. \"He's a gentleman,  he has a charming temper; and, after all, an income of forty thousand  francs!\"    \"It's misery--'genteel' misery,\" Osmond broke in. \"It's not what I've  dreamed of for Pansy.\"    \"Very good then. He has promised me not to speak to her.\"    \"Do you believe him?\" Osmond asked absentmindedly.    \"Perfectly. Pansy has thought a great deal about him; but I don't  suppose you consider that that matters.\"    \"I don't consider it matters at all; but neither do I believe she has  thought of him.\"    \"That opinion's more convenient,\" said Madame Merle quietly.    \"Has she told you she's in love with him?\"    \"For what do you take her? And for what do you take me?\" Madame Merle  added in a moment.    Osmond had raised his foot and was resting his slim ankle on the other  knee; he clasped his ankle in his hand familiarly--his long, fine  forefinger and thumb could make a ring for it--and gazed a while  before him. \"This kind of thing doesn't find me unprepared. It's what I  educated her for. It was all for this--that when such a case should come  up she should do what I prefer.\"    \"I'm not afraid that she'll not do it.\"    \"Well then, where's the hitch?\"    \"I don't see any. But, all the same, I recommend you not to get rid of  Mr. Rosier. Keep him on hand; he may be useful.\"    \"I can't keep him. Keep him yourself.\"    \"Very good; I'll put him into a corner and allow him so much a day.\"  Madame Merle had, for the most part, while they talked, been glancing  about her; it was her habit in this situation, just as it was her habit  to interpose a good many blank-looking pauses. A long drop followed the  last words I have quoted; and before it had ended she saw Pansy come out  of the adjoining room, followed by Edward Rosier. The girl advanced a  few steps and then stopped and stood looking at Madame Merle and at her  father.    \"He has spoken to her,\" Madame Merle went on to Osmond.    Her companion never turned his head. \"So much for your belief in his  promises. He ought to be horsewhipped.\"    \"He intends to confess, poor little man!\"    Osmond got up; he had now taken a sharp look at his daughter. \"It  doesn't matter,\" he murmured, turning away.    Pansy after a moment came up to Madame Merle with her little manner  of unfamiliar politeness. This lady's reception of her was not more  intimate; she simply, as she rose from the sofa, gave her a friendly  smile.    \"You're very late,\" the young creature gently said.    \"My dear child, I'm never later than I intend to be.\"    Madame Merle had not got up to be gracious to Pansy; she moved toward  Edward Rosier. He came to meet her and, very quickly, as if to get it  off his mind, \"I've spoken to her!\" he whispered.    \"I know it, Mr. Rosier.\"    \"Did she tell you?\"    \"Yes, she told me. Behave properly for the rest of the evening, and come  and see me to-morrow at a quarter past five.\" She was severe, and in  the manner in which she turned her back to him there was a degree of  contempt which caused him to mutter a decent imprecation.    He had no intention of speaking to Osmond; it was neither the time nor  the place. But he instinctively wandered toward Isabel, who sat talking  with an old lady. He sat down on the other side of her; the old lady  was Italian, and Rosier took for granted she understood no English. \"You  said just now you wouldn't help me,\" he began to Mrs. Osmond. \"Perhaps  you'll feel differently when you know--when you know--!\"    Isabel met his hesitation. \"When I know what?\"    \"That she's all right.\"    \"What do you mean by that?\"    \"Well, that we've come to an understanding.\"    \"She's all wrong,\" said Isabel. \"It won't do.\"    Poor Rosier gazed at her half-pleadingly, half-angrily; a sudden flush  testified to his sense of injury. \"I've never been treated so,\" he said.  \"What is there against me, after all? That's not the way I'm usually  considered. I could have married twenty times.\"    \"It's a pity you didn't. I don't mean twenty times, but once,  comfortably,\" Isabel added, smiling kindly. \"You're not rich enough for  Pansy.\"    \"She doesn't care a straw for one's money.\"    \"No, but her father does.\"    \"Ah yes, he has proved that!\" cried the young man.    Isabel got up, turning away from him, leaving her old lady without  ceremony; and he occupied himself for the next ten minutes in pretending  to look at Gilbert Osmond's collection of miniatures, which were neatly  arranged on a series of small velvet screens. But he looked without  seeing; his cheek burned; he was too full of his sense of injury. It was  certain that he had never been treated that way before; he was not used  to being thought not good enough. He knew how good he was, and if such  a fallacy had not been so pernicious he could have laughed at it. He  searched again for Pansy, but she had disappeared, and his main desire  was now to get out of the house. Before doing so he spoke once more to  Isabel; it was not agreeable to him to reflect that he had just said a  rude thing to her--the only point that would now justify a low view of  him.    \"I referred to Mr. Osmond as I shouldn't have done, a while ago,\" he  began. \"But you must remember my situation.\"    \"I don't remember what you said,\" she answered coldly.    \"Ah, you're offended, and now you'll never help me.\"    She was silent an instant, and then with a change of tone: \"It's not  that I won't; I simply can't!\" Her manner was almost passionate.    \"If you COULD, just a little, I'd never again speak of your husband save  as an angel.\"    \"The inducement's great,\" said Isabel gravely--inscrutably, as he  afterwards, to himself, called it; and she gave him, straight in the  eyes, a look which was also inscrutable. It made him remember somehow  that he had known her as a child; and yet it was keener than he liked,  and he took himself off.        CHAPTER XXXVIII    He went to see Madame Merle on the morrow, and to his surprise she let  him off rather easily. But she made him promise that he would stop  there till something should have been decided. Mr. Osmond had had higher  expectations; it was very true that as he had no intention of giving his  daughter a portion such expectations were open to criticism or even, if  one would, to ridicule. But she would advise Mr. Rosier not to take that  tone; if he would possess his soul in patience he might arrive at his  felicity. Mr. Osmond was not favourable to his suit, but it wouldn't be  a miracle if he should gradually come round. Pansy would never defy  her father, he might depend on that; so nothing was to be gained by  precipitation. Mr. Osmond needed to accustom his mind "]]]
