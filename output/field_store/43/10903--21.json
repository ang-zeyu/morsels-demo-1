Often is the southern planter as a patriarch in olden  times. Those who are striving to sever his household know not what  they do.    Well may we who live in these troubled times exclaim with Madame  Roland, the martyr of the false principles of her murderers, \"O  Liberte! O Liberte! que de crimes on commet en ton nom!\" This she  said, turning to the statue of liberty beside the scaffold. Liberty  unrestrained degenerates into license. There may be political freedom  without social liberty. Says Lamartine, speaking of the inhabitants of  Malta, \"Ils sont esclaves de la loi immuable de la force que Dieu leur  fait; nous sommes esclaves des lois variables et capricieuses que nous  nous faisons.\"    A few years' residence on this soil might teach even a Wilberforce to  turn in his philanthropy to other and wider fields of action.    Of Mr. Calhoun's character as a master much might be said, for all who  knew him admit that it was exemplary. But we need not multiply  examples to prove his unaffected goodness, and I will repeat only a  circumstance or two, which, by way of illustrating some subjects  discussed, he incidentally mentioned to me. One related to a free  negro, formerly a slave in Carolina, but then living in one of our  northern cities, who came to him in Washington, begging him to  intercede for his return to Carolina. He represented his condition as  deplorable, said that he could not support himself and family by his  trade, (he was a shoemaker,) and that not being able to obtain  sufficient food or fuel in that cold climate, they were almost frozen.  \"When I told him,\" said Mr. Calhoun, \"that I would do all I could for  him, he seized both my hands in his and expressed fervent gratitude.\"  At another time, speaking of a family whom his son designed to take to  Alabama, he told me that the mother of the family came to him and said  she would prefer to stay with her master and mistress on the  plantation, even if all her children went with master A. Mr. Calhoun  added, \"I could not think of her remaining without either of her  children; and as she chose to stay, we retained her youngest son, a  boy of twelve years.\"    Mr. Calhoun required very little of any one, doing more for others  than he asked of them. He seemed to act upon the principle that the  strong should bear the burthens of the weak. In sickness he feared to  give trouble, and unless his friends insisted, would have little done  for him. \"Energetic as he was,\" said a near relative, \"he would lie  patiently all day, asking for nothing.\" His sensibility was of the  most unselfish nature. Some months before his death, and after he left  Fort Hill the last time, he said he felt that death was near, much  nearer than he was willing to have his family know, and added that he  wished to give all the time he could spare from public duty to  preparation for death. While suffering from increasing illness at  Washington, still, as he hoped to return again to his family, he was  unwilling, though they anxiously awaited his summons, that they should  be alarmed, saying he could not bear to see their grief. No doubt his  conscientious spirit felt that his country at that critical moment  demanded his best energies, and that he should be unnerved by the  presence of his nearest friends; and loving his own family as he did,  and so beloved as he was by them, he serenely awaited the approach of  the king of Terrors, and suffered his last sorrow far from his home,  cheered only by one watcher from his household.    There was a beautiful adaptation in his bearing--a just appreciation  of what was due to others, and a nice sense of propriety. I have had  opportunities to compare his manners with those of other great men.  His kind and unaffected interest was expressed in a way peculiarly  dignified and refined. Some men appear to think they atone for a low  estimate of our sex by flattery. Not so with Mr. Calhoun. He paid the  highest compliment which could be paid to woman, by recognizing in her  a soul--a soul capable of understanding and appreciating. Of his  desire for her improvement and elevation he gave substantial proofs.  Although Fort Hill was five miles from the female academy he never  suffered an examination to pass without honoring it with his presence.  He came not for the sake of form, but he exhibited an interest in the  exercises, and was heard to comment upon them afterwards in a manner  which showed that he had given them attention. He never reminded you  that his hours were more precious than yours. The question may be  asked how could he, amid his great and stern duties, find time for  attention to those things from which so many men excuse themselves on  the plea of business. But he wasted no time, and by gathering up its  fragments, he had enough and to spare. I have before said that his  kind acts were his recreations.    Were I asked wherein lay the charm which won the hearts of all who  came within his circle, I could not at once reply. It was perhaps his  perfect _abandon_, his sincerity, his confidential manner, his  childlike simplicity, in union with his majestic intelligence, and his  self-renunciation--the crowning virtue of his life: these imparted the  vivid enjoyment and the delightful repose which his friends felt in  his presence. It was often not so much what he said as his manner of  saying it, that was so impressive. Never can I forget an incident  which occurred at the time when a war with England, on account of  Oregon, seemed impending. He arrived in Charleston during the  excitement on that subject. He was asked in the drawing-room if he  thought there would be a war. He waived an answer, saying that for  some time he had been absent from home and had received no official  documents; but as he passed with us from the drawing-room to the  street door, he said to me in his rapid, earnest manner, \"I anticipate  a severe seven months' campaign. I have never known our country in  such a state.\" War has a terror for me, and I said, \"Oh, Mr. Calhoun,  do not let a war arise. Do all you can to prevent it.\" He replied, \"I  will do all, in honor, I can do,\" and paused. A thousand thoughts  seemed to pass over his face, his soul was in his eyes, and bending a  little forward, as if bowed by a sense of his responsibility and  insufficiency, he added, speaking slowly and with emphasis and with  the deepest solemnity, as if questioning with himself, \"_But what can  one man do?_\" I see him now. No painting or sculpture could remind me  so truly of him as does my faithful memory. But I will not dwell on  the subject, for I fear I can never by words convey to the mind of  another the impression which I received of his sincerity, and of his  devotion to his country and to the cause of humanity. How he redeemed  his pledge to do all that he, in honor, could do, his efforts in the  settlement of the Oregon question truly show. When next I saw him I  told him how much I was delighted with his Oregon speech. In his  kindest manner he replied, \"I am glad I can say any thing to please  you.\"    The last time I saw Mr. Calhoun, you, my brother, were with me. You  remember that his kind wife took us to his room, and that you remarked  the cheerfulness and affability with which he received us, although  his feeble health had obliged him to refuse almost every one that day.  We shall see him no more, but his memory will linger with us.    To you I would commend him as an example. Read his letter to a young  law-student. As you are so soon to enter the profession of law, such a  model as Mr. Calhoun may be studied with advantage. While I would  never wish any one to lose his own individuality, or to descend to  imitation, I believe that one gifted mind leaves its impress on  another; while I would not deify or canonize a mortal, I would render  homage to one who united such moral attainments to so rare a  combination of intellectual gifts; while it is degrading to ourselves  and injurious to others to lavish unmerited and extravagant praise, it  is a loss not to appreciate a character like his, for it ennobles our  own nature to contemplate the true and the beautiful.    Although it is said that our country is in danger from its ideas of  equality, and its want of reverence and esteem for age, and wisdom,  and office, and talents, and attainments, and virtues--and this  feature of the American character is so strongly impressed that Mar  Yohannah, the Nestorian bishop, said in my presence, in his peculiar  English, \"Yes, I know this nation glory in its republicanism, but I am  afraid it will become republican to God\"--yet it is a cheering omen  when a man like Mr. Calhoun is so beloved and reverenced. I think  every one who was favored with a personal acquaintance with him will  admit that I have not been guilty of exaggeration, and \"will delight  to do him honor.\"    The question naturally arises, to what are we to ascribe the formation  of such a character? There must have been causes for such effects.  Whence came his temperance, his self-denial, his incorruptible  integrity, his fidelity in every duty, his love for mankind, his  indefatigable efforts for the good of others, and his superiority to  those things which the natural heart most craves? Mr. Calhoun's  childhood was spent among the glorious works of nature, and was  sheltered from the temptations which abound in promiscuous society. He  was the son of pious parents, and by them he was taught the Bible, and  from that source undoubtedly his native gifts were perfected. I have  understood that from early life he was an advocate for the doctrines  of the Bible, as understood by orthodox Christians. I have been told  by relatives of his who were on the most intimate terms with him, that  for some time before his death his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36496"],[0,"On the cattle plague: or, Contagious typhus in horned cattle.

That the want of prompt and stringent measures first to  concentrate, and then to stifle this typhus in its focus; the love of  lucre, the perfidy of some, and the absence of foresight and caution in  others, may be, and have been in the particular cases which we are  dealing with, material causes and agencies of its diffusion.    Such we consider to be the causes which engender and propagate cattle  typhus, and which will serve as a basis for the preventive measures to  be employed in order to withstand and check its propagation.    FOOTNOTES:    [B] We are aware that the transport of cattle is conducted in a  different manner during the prevalence of this epizootia. The account  given by two German veterinary surgeons of the management of the vessels  of the North German Lloyd's, and of the manner in which the animals are  treated, is a proof of this; but before the appearance of the epizootia,  the transport of animals by land and by sea left much to be desired.  This account will be found at the end of this work (NOTE A); and all  documents in support of the facts which have served as the basis of our  dissertation, are also in the Appendix, arranged alphabetically in the  form of notes.

CHAPTER III.    _Description of the Contagious Typhus of the Ox; its Symptoms, Course,  Progress, &c._      I have already written the history of the typhus which affects the ox; I  have shown and dwelt upon the signs and characters of typhus diseases  generally, deducing therefrom the denomination and definition of that of  the ox in particular; finally, I have described the causes which  generate and diffuse it abroad.    Now, I must make known the various phases and alterations to which the  disease is liable, and which, in the language of the medical schools,  are called its symptoms and characteristics; its progress or course; its  prognosis; its _post-mortem_ appearances, &c. &c.    This examination, like those which have preceded it, will afford new  foundations for medical practice.      I.    _Symptomatic Characteristics._--The typhus of the ox, like all  infectious and contagious diseases, offers to observation four  successive changes: 1st, a _period of Incubation_, during which the  original structure is subject to internal and latent derangements; 2nd,  a _period of Initiation_, during which the first evident signs of the  disease are manifested; 3rd, a _period of Endurance_, during which the  phenomena are fully developed; 4th, a _period of Decline_, or wasting  atony.    These divisions and classifications, it will readily be conceived, are  rather fanciful, for nature does not adapt herself to our methodical  forms. Still we shall abide by them, because they have their relative  and practical utility, and because they will afford to the practitioner  suggestions more easily understood; and finally, because the organic  changes are different at these various periods, which in their entirety  constitute the typhus of the bovine species.    The description of those different phases through which the organism of  cattle smitten with the contagion has to pass, has moreover been given  in a masterly manner by the veterinary physicians of the different  European countries, especially by those in which opportunities to  observe it have been most frequent--that is to say, by the Russian,  German, and French veterinary doctors, Jessen, Roell, D'Arboval, Gelle.    The English physicians of the 18th century, as we have already seen,  were also in no respect inferior to those of our own time. Finally, Mr.  Simonds, who published a very able Report on his return from his  scientific exploration in Galicia, in 1857, and the skilful Professor  Bouley, in his recent communications to the Academie de Medecine, in  Paris, respecting his examination of the present cattle typhus in  England, have described the disease with minute exactness, as we  ourselves have verified on the various sick beasts which we have seen  during the last two months.    1. _Period of Incubation._--Several careful experiments, which have been  cited in the historical division of this work, and numerous fortuitous  occasions, have authorized us to assign a duration of nine or twelve  days to the period of incubation, according to the general conditions  of the epizootia, the manner in which the contagion is transmitted, and  the former state of health of the affected cattle.    Thus an epizootia at the outset, either when it has become general, or  when it is at its decline, does not always transmit typhic miasma of the  same virulent intensity, nor does it always provoke in the frame a  labour of incubation which is invariable. The contagion transmitted from  animal to animal living continually in the same stalls or sheds is  followed by an incubation more quick and active than that which results  from a chance contact in the markets, or from a contagion produced at a  distance, by the transmission of the miasmatic effluvium along the  public highways.    Let us add to these considerations the relative state of each animal's  health, and we shall then perfectly understand that the incubation must  vary both in its continuance and in the characteristics of its  manifestation. In some animals it scarcely betrays the derangements  produced by its morbid operation: they preserve their appetite and their  usual looks. A close and attentive observation would alone be able to  distinguish some slight alterations in their way of living, in the  regularity of their rumination and sleep. But in others, there is no  mistaking a something irregular and unusual in their appearance and  living; the vital state is no longer the same. Thus an animal which used  to be cheerful and familiar becomes silent and solitary; it browses the  grass with less eagerness and avidity; it lies down more frequently and  longer; it lingers by the side of the hedge along the field, or it  wanders about, here and there, with a listless look, and without any  object. Others moan and complain, bellowing at intervals in an unusual  manner, very expressive of languor and pain.    But apart from seasons of epizootia, the beasts too often exhibit these  imperceptible shades of variety in their looks and actions for the  attention to be struck by them; these changes, therefore, are almost  always unnoticed.    However, the typhic miasma absorbed at the same time by the respiratory  and digestive mucous membranes serves to modify the qualities of the  blood, and secretly reacts on the nervous system; soon after, the  animal exhibits more decidedly those changes which previously were  hardly to be detected; his want of appetite is more marked, his sadness  more obvious, and his attention fixes itself more slowly and carelessly  on the objects which surround him. When he is in the shed, his usual  food is found in excess of his wants, his thirst is much keener and more  frequent, and a continual dejection and lowness of spirits or a  transitory agitation disturb all his functions. When the farmers or  graziers notice these premonitory signs for the first time they pay but  little attention thereto; but if the contagion has found its way into  their stalls and sheds they are no longer deceived by them, but begin to  apprehend that in a day or two fresh victims will be added to the  number.    2. _Period of Initiation._--Soon the elaboration of the virulent miasma  in the organic structure changes the quality of the blood and humours,  the functions of assimilation and secretion are modified, the nervous  centres receive vitiated organic elements and are disturbed in their  physiological conditions, and the smitten animal displays that state of  latent uneasiness which he is imperfectly conscious of by a general  look of heaviness and stupor (+Typhos+), which has suggested for this  disease its name of typhus.    Indeed, the poor animal's eyes are fixed, the hearing becomes obtuse or  indifferent, as may be seen in the sinking of the ears, those organs  which are so sensitive, so contractile, and so vigilant in herbivorous  animals. With the head hanging down and motionless, the neck stretched  out, their forelegs open and spread, their buttocks drawn together and  one of them completely lax, they seem to succumb beneath the weight of  their bodies. In a word, the animal exhibits through its whole bearing a  heavy sadness, a general dejection, which bespeak a great derangement in  the whole structure. From this time, in the animals which are most  seriously affected, the appetite ceases, the rumination becomes  irregular and partial, whilst in some others the appetite and rumination  are maintained in different degrees.    But the incubation of the morbid elements pursues its course, the  alteration of the blood becomes general, and the circulation is  increased and quickened. After this the fever interposes and stops the  secretions, that of the udders is dried up, the mucous channels cease to  flow, the mucous membrane of the mouth becomes whitish, the little  glands situated on it are more permanent, especially in the  circumference of the gums; the floor of the tongue and the larynx are  inflamed, the mucous membrane of the cow's sexual organs is red and  furrowed with livid streaks, the white of the eye is parched, and the  skin feels alternately hot and cold, as well as the"]]]
