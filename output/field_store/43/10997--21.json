[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/446"],[0,"A Book of Remarkable Criminals (#17)"],[1,"of eighteenth century  England.    Crime in the nineteenth century becomes more scientific in its methods  and in its detection also. The revolver places a more hasty, less  decorous weapon than the old-fashioned pistol in the hands of the  determined burglar. The literature of crime, such as it is, becomes  vulgar and prosaic. Peace has no charm about him, no gaiety, but he has  the virtues of his defects. He, unlike Sheppard, shuns company; he works  alone, never depending on accomplices; a \"tight cock,\" as Sheppard would  have phrased it, and not relying on a like quality of tightness in  his fellows. Sheppard is a slave to his women, Edgeworth Bess and Mrs.  Maggot; Mrs. Peace and Sue Thompson are the slaves of Peace. Sheppard  loves to stroll openly about the London streets in his fine suit  of black, his ruffled shirt and his silver-hilted sword. Peace lies  concealed at Peckham beneath the homely disguise of old Mr. Thompson.  Sheppard is an imp, Peace a goblin. But both have that gift of  personality which, in their own peculiar line, lifts them out from the  ruck, and makes them Jack and Charley to those who like to know famous  people by cheery nicknames.    And so we must accept Charles Peace as a remarkable character, whose  unquestioned gifts as a man of action were squandered on a criminal  career; neither better nor worse than a great number of other persons,  whose good fortune it has been to develop similar qualities under  happier surroundings. There are many more complete villains than the  ordinary criminal, who contrive to go through life without offending  against the law. Close and scientific investigation has shown that the  average convicted criminal differs intellectually from the normal person  only in a slightly lower level of intelligence, a condition that may  well be explained by the fact that the convicted criminal has been  found out. Crime has been happily defined by a recent and most able  investigator into the character of the criminal(12) as \"an unusual act  committed by a perfectly normal person.\" At the same time, according  to the same authority, there is a type of normal person who tends to  be convicted of crime, and he is differentiated from his fellows by  defective physique and mental capacity and an increased possession of  antisocial qualities.(13)           (12) \"The English Convict,\" a statistical study, by Charles Goring, M.D.  His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1913.         (13) Murderers--at least those executed for their crimes--have not for  obvious reasons been made the subject of close scientific observation.  Their mental capacity would in all probability be found to be rather  higher than that of less ambitious criminals.      How does Peace answer to the definition? Though short in stature, his  physical development left little to be desired: he was active, agile,  and enjoyed excellent health at all times. For a man of forty-seven he  had aged remarkably in appearance. That is probably to be accounted for  by mental worry. With two murders on his conscience we know from Sue  Thompson that all she learnt of his secrets was what escaped from him in  his troubled dreams--Peace may well have shown traces of mental  anxiety. But in all other respects Charles Peace would seem to have been  physically fit. In intellectual capacity he was undoubtedly above the  average of the ordinary criminal. The facts of his career, his natural  gifts, speak for themselves. Of anti-social proclivities he no doubt  possessed his share at the beginning, and these were aggravated, as in  most cases they were in his day, by prison life and discipline.    Judged as scientifically as is possible where the human being is  concerned, Peace stands out physically and intellectually well above  the average of his class, perhaps the most naturally gifted of all those  who, without advantages of rank or education, have tried their hands at  crime. Ordinary crime for the most part would appear to be little better  than the last resort of the intellectually defective, and a poor game  at that. The only interesting criminals are those worthy of something  better. Peace was one of these. If his life may be said to point a  moral, it is the very simple one that crime is no career for a man of  brains.          The Career of Robert Butler      There is a report of Butler's trial published in Dunedin. It gives in  full the speeches and the cross-examination of the witnesses, but not  in all cases the evidence-in-chief. By the kindness of a friend in  New Zealand I obtained a copy of the depositions taken before the  magistrate; with this I have been able to supplement the report of the  trial. A collection of newspaper cuttings furnished me with the details  of the rest of Butler's career.    I    THE DUNEDIN MURDERS    On the evening of March 23, 1905, Mr. William Munday, a highly respected  citizen of the town of Tooringa, in Queensland, was walking to the  neighbouring town of Toowong to attend a masonic gathering. It was about  eight o'clock, the moon shining brightly. Nearing Toowong, Mr. Munday  saw a middle-aged man, bearded and wearing a white overcoat, step  out into the moonlight from under the shadow of a tree. As Mr. Munday  advanced, the man in the white coat stood directly in his way. \"Out with  all you have, and quick about it,\" he said. Instead of complying with  this peremptory summons, Mr. Munday attempted to close with him. The man  drew back quickly, whipped out a revolver, fired, and made off as fast  as he could. The bullet, after passing through Mr. Munday's left arm,  had lodged in the stomach. The unfortunate gentleman was taken to a  neighbouring hospital where, within a few hours, he was dead.    In the meantime a vigorous search was made for his assailant. Late the  same night Constable Hennessy, riding a bicycle, saw a man in a white  coat who seemed to answer to the description of the assassin. He  dismounted, walked up to him and asked him for a match. The man put his  hand inside his coat. \"What have you got there?\" asked the constable.  \"I'll--soon show you,\" replied the man in the white coat, producing  suddenly a large revolver. But Hennessy was too quick for him. Landing  him one under the jaw, he sent him to the ground and, after a sharp  struggle, secured him. Constable Hennessy little knew at the time that  his capture in Queensland of the man in the white coat was almost as  notable in the annals of crime as the affray at Blackheath on an autumn  night in 1878, when Constable Robinson grappled successfully, wounded as  he was, with Charles Peace.    The man taken by Hennessy gave the name of James Wharton, and as  James Wharton he was hanged at Brisbane. But before his death it was  ascertained beyond doubt, though he never admitted it himself, that  Wharton was none other than one Robert Butler, whose career as a  criminal and natural wickedness may well rank him with Charles Peace in  the hierarchy of scoundrels. Like Peace, Butler was, in the jargon of  crime, a \"hatter,\" a \"lone hand,\" a solitary who conceived and  executed his nefarious designs alone; like Peace, he supplemented an  insignificant physique by a liberal employment of the revolver; like  Peace, he was something of a musician, the day before his execution he  played hymns for half an hour on the prison organ; like Peace, he knew  when to whine when it suited his purpose; and like Peace, though not  with the same intensity, he could be an uncomfortably persistent lover,  when the fit was on him. Both men were cynics in their way and viewed  their fellow-men with a measure of contempt. But here parallel ends.  Butler was an intellectual, inferior as a craftsman to Peace, the  essentially practical, unread, naturally gifted artist. Butler was a man  of books. He had been schoolmaster, journalist. He had studied the lives  of great men, and as a criminal, had devoted especial attention to those  of Frederick the Great and Napoleon. Butler's defence in the Dunedin  murder trial was a feat of skill quite beyond the power of Peace. Peace  was a religious man after the fashion of the mediaeval tyrant, Butler  an infidel. Peace, dragged into the light of a court of justice, cut a  sorry figure; here Butler shone. Peace escaped a conviction for murder  by letting another suffer in his place; Butler escaped a similar  experience by the sheer ingenuity of his defence. Peace had the modesty  and reticence of the sincere artist; Butler the loquacious vanity of the  literary or forensic coxcomb. Lastly, and it is the supreme difference,  Butler was a murderer by instinct and conviction, as Lacenaire or  Ruloff; \"a man's life,\" he said, \"was of no more importance than a  dog's; nature respects the one no more than the other, a volcanic  eruption kills mice and men with the one hand. The divine command,  'kill, kill and spare not,' was intended not only for Joshua, but for  men of all time; it is the example of our rulers, our Fredericks and  Napoleons.\"    Butler was of the true Prussian mould. \"In crime,\" he would say, \"as  in war, no half measures. Let us follow the example of our rulers whose  orders in war run, 'Kill, burn and sink,' and what you cannot carry  away, destroy.'\" Here is the gospel of frightfulness applied almost  prophetically to crime. To Butler murder is a principle of warfare; to  Peace it was never more than a desperate resort or an act the outcome of  ungovernable passion.    Ireland can claim the honour of Butler's birth. It took place at  Kilkenny about 1845. At an early age he left his native land for  Australia, and commenced his professional career by being sentenced  under the name of James Wilson--the same initials as those of James  Wharton of Queensland--to twelve months' imprisonment for vagrancy. Of  the sixteen years he passed in Victoria he spent thirteen in prison,  first for stealing, then in steady progression for highway robbery and  burglary.

All feeble individual convictions become confirmed  upon becoming collective.    Leaders of great repute or unusual violence can sometimes, by  acting on all the groups of an assembly, make them a single  crowd.  The majority of the members of the Convention enacted  measures entirely contrary to their opinions under the influence  of a very small number of such leaders.    Collectivities have always given way before active sectaries.  The history of the revolutionary Assemblies shows how  pusillanimous they were, despite the boldness of their language  respecting kings, before the leaders of the popular riots.  The  invasion of a band of energumens commanded by an imperious leader  was enough to make them vote then and there the most absurd and  contradictory measures.    An assembly, having the characteristics of a crowd, will, like a  crowd, be extreme in its sentiments.  Excessive in its violence,  it will be excessive in its cowardice.  In general it will be  insolent to the weak and servile before the strong.    We remember the fearful humility of the Parliament when the  youthful Louis XIV. entered, whip in hand, to pronounce his brief  speech.  We know with what increasing impertinence the  Constituent Assembly treated Louis XVI. as it felt that he was  becoming defenceless.  Finally, we recall the terror of the  Convention under the reign of Robespierre.    This characteristic of assemblies being a general law, the  convocation of an assembly by a sovereign when his power is  failing must be regarded as a gross error in psychology.  The  assembling of the States General cost the life of Louis  XVI.  It all but lost Henry III. his throne, when, obliged to  leave Paris, he had the unhappy idea of assembling the Estates at  Blois.  Conscious of the weakness of the king, the Estates at  once spoke as masters of the situation, modifying taxes,  dismissing officials, and claiming that their decisions should  have the force of law.    This progressive exaggeration of sentiments was plainly  demonstrated in all the assemblies of the Revolution.  The  Constituent Assembly, at first extremely respectful toward the  royal authority and its prerogatives, finally proclaimed itself a  sovereign Assembly, and treated Louis XVI as a mere official.  The Convention, after relatively moderate beginnings, ended with  a preliminary form of the Terror, when judgments were still  surrounded by certain legal guarantees: then, quickly increasing  its powers, it enacted a law depriving all accused persons of the  right of defence, permitting their condemnation upon the mere  suspicion of being suspect.  Yielding more and more to its  sanguinary frenzy, it finally decimated itself.  Girondists,  Hebertists, Dantonists, and Robespierrists successively ended  their careers at the hands of the executioner.    This exaggeration of the sentiments of assemblies explains why  they were always so little able to control their own destinies  and why they so often arrived at conclusions exactly contrary to  the ends proposed.  Catholic and royalist, the Constituent  Assembly, instead of the constitutional monarchy it wished to  establish and the religion it wished to defend, rapidly led  France to a violent republic and the persecution of the clergy.    Political assemblies are composed, as we have seen, of  heterogeneous groups, but they have sometimes been formed of  homogeneous groups, as, for instance, certain of the clubs, which  played so enormous a part during the Revolution, and whose  psychology deserves a special examination.      2.  The Psychology of the Revolutionary Clubs.      Small assemblies of men possessing the same opinions, the same  beliefs, and the same interests, which eliminate all dissentient  voices, differ from the great assemblies by the unity of their  sentiments and therefore their wills.  Such were the communes,  the religious congregations, the corporations, and the clubs  during the Revolution, the secret societies during the first half  of the nineteenth century, and the Freemasons and syndicalists of  to-day.    The points of difference between a heterogeneous assembly and a  homogeneous club must be thoroughly grasped if we are to  comprehend the progress of the French Revolution.  Until the  Directory and especially during the Convention the Revolution was  directed by the clubs.    Despite the unity of will due to the absence of dissident parties  the clubs obey the laws of the psychology of crowds.  They are  consequently subjugated by leaders.  This we see especially in  the Jacobin Club, which was dominated by Robespierre.    The function of the leader of a club, a homogeneous crowd, is far  more difficult than that of a leader of a heterogeneous crowd.  The latter may easily be led by harping on a small number of  strings, but in a homogeneous group like a club, whose  sentiments and interests are identical, the leader must  know how to humour them and is often himself led.    Part of the strength of homogeneous agglomerations resides in  their anonymity.  We know that during the Commune of 1871 a few  anonymous orders sufficed to effect the burning of the finest  monuments of Paris: the Hotel de Ville, the Tuileries, the  Cour des Comptes, the buildings of the Legion of Honour, &c.  A  brief order from the anonymous committees, ``Burn Finances, burn  Tuileries,'' &c., was immediately executed.  An unlooked-for  chance only saved the Louvre and its collections.  We know too  what religious attention is in our days accorded to the most  absurd injunctions of the anonymous leaders of the trades unions.    The clubs of Paris and the insurrectionary Commune were not less  scrupulously obeyed at the time of the Revolution.  An order  emanating from these was sufficient to hurl upon the Assembly a  popular army which dictated its wishes.    Summing up the history of the Convention in another chapter, we  shall see how frequent were these irruptions, and with what  servility the Assembly, which according to the legends was so  powerful bowed itself before the most imperative injunctions of a  handful of rioters.  Instructed by experience, the Directory  closed the clubs and put an end to the invasion of the populace  by energetically shooting them down.    The Convention had early grasped the superiority of homogeneous  groups over heterogeneous assemblies in matters of government,  which is why it subdivided itself into committees composed each  of a limited number of individuals.  These committees--of  Public Safety, of Finance, &c.--formed small sovereign assemblies  in the midst of the larger Assembly.  Their power was held in  check only by that of the clubs.    The preceding considerations show the power of groups over the  wills of the members composing them.  If the group is  homogeneous, this action is considerable; if it is heterogeneous,  it is less considerable but may still become important, either  because the more powerful groups of an assembly will dominate  those whose cohesion is weaker or because certain contagious  sentiments will often extend themselves to all the members of an  assembly.    A memorable example of this influence of groups occurred at the  time of the Revolution, when, on the night of the 4th of August,  the nobles voted, on the proposition of one of their members, the  abandonment of feudal privileges.  Yet we know that the  Revolution resulted in part from the refusal of the clergy and  the nobles to renounce their privileges.  Why did they refuse to  renounce them at first?  Simply because men in a crowd do not act  as the same men singly.  Individually no member of the nobility  would ever have abandoned his rights.    Of this influence of assemblies upon their members Napoleon at  St. Helena cited some curious examples:  ``Nothing was more  common than to meet with men at this period quite unlike the  reputation that their acts and words would seem to justify.  For  instance, one might have supposed Monge to be a terrible fellow;  when war was decided upon he mounted the tribune of the Jacobins  and declared that he would give his two daughters to the two  first soldiers to be wounded by the enemy.  He wanted the  nobles to be killed, &c.  Now, Monge was the most gentle and  feeble of men, and wouldn't have had a chicken killed if he had  had to do it with his own hands, or even to have it done in his  presence.''      3.  A Suggested Explanation of the Progressive Exaggeration of  Sentiments in Assemblies.      If collective sentiments were susceptible of exact quantitative  measurement, we might translate them by a curve which, after a  first gradual ascent, runs upward with extreme rapidity and then  falls almost vertically.  The equation of this curve might be  called the equation of the variations of collective sentiments  subjected to a constant excitation.    It is not always easy to explain the acceleration of certain  sentiments under the influence of a constant exciting cause.  Perhaps, however, one may say that if the laws of psychology are  comparable to those of mechanics, a cause of invariable  dimensions acting in a continuous fashion will rapidly increase  the intensity of a sentiment.  We know, for example, that a force  which is constant in dimension and direction, such as gravity  acting upon a mass, will cause an accelerated movement.  The  speed of a free object falling in space under the influence of  gravity will be about 32 feet during the first second, 64 feet  during the next, 96 feet during the next, &c.  It would be easy,  were the moving body allowed to fall from a sufficient height, to  give it a velocity sufficient to perforate a plate of steel.    But although this explanation is applicable to the acceleration  of a sentiment subjected to a constant exciting cause, it  does not tell us why the effects of acceleration finally and  suddenly cease.  Such a fall is only comprehensible if we bring  in"]]]
