If the letter of condolence with the  Counts Oberto and Guido of Romena on the death of their uncle is  genuine, it has great value for the passage in which he excuses himself  for not having come to the funeral:--'It was not negligence or  ingratitude, but the poverty into which I am fallen by reason of my  exile. This, like a cruel persecutor, holds me as in a prison-house  where I have neither horse nor arms; and though I do all I can to free  myself, I have failed as yet.' The letter has no date. Like the other  ten or twelve epistles attributed to Dante, it is in Latin.    [103] There is a splendid passage in praise of this family, _Purg._  viii. 121. A treaty is on record in which Dante acts as representative  of the Malaspini in settling the terms of a peace between them and the  Bishop of Luni in October 1306.    [104] The authority for this is Benvenuto of Imola in his comment on the  _Comedy_ (_Purg._ xi.). The portrait of Dante by Giotto, still in  Florence, but ruined by modern bungling restoration, is usually believed  to have been executed in 1301 or 1302. But with regard to this, see the  note at the end of this essay.    [105] It is true that Villani not only says that 'he went to study at  Bologna,' but also that 'he went to Paris and many parts of the world'  (_Cronica_, ix. 136), and that Villani, of all contemporary or nearly  contemporary writers, is by far the most worthy of credence. But he  proves to be more than once in error regarding Dante; making him,  _e.g._, die in a wrong month and be buried in a wrong church at Ravenna.  And the 'many parts of the world' shows that here he is dealing in  hearsay of the vaguest sort. Nor can much weight be given to Boccaccio  when he sends Dante to Bologna and Paris. But Benvenuto of Imola, who  lectured on the _Comedy_ at Bologna within fifty years of Dante's death,  says that Dante studied there. It would indeed be strange if he did not,  and at more than one period, Bologna being the University nearest  Florence. Proof of Dante's residence in Paris has been found in his  familiar reference to the Rue du Fouarre (_Parad._ x. 137). His graphic  description of the coast between Lerici and Turbia (_Purg._ iii. 49, iv.  25) certainly seems to show a familiarity with the Western as well as  the Eastern Rivieras of Genoa. But it scarcely follows that he was on  his way to Paris when he visited them.    [106] _Inf._ xiii. 58.    [107] 'O ye, who have hitherto been following me in some small  craft, ... put not further to sea, lest, losing sight of me, you lose  yourselves' (_Parad._ ii. 1). But, to tell the truth, Dante is never so  weak as a poet as when he is most the philosopher or the theologian.  The following list of books more or less known to him is not given as  complete:--The Vulgate, beginning with St. Jerome's Prologue; Aristotle,  through the Latin translation then in vogue; Averroes, etc.; Thomas  Aquinas and the other Schoolmen; much of the Civil and Canon law;  Boethius; Homer only in scraps, through Aristotle, etc.; Virgil, Cicero  in part, Livy, Horace, Ovid, Terence, Lucan, and Statius; the works of  Brunetto Latini; the poetical literature of Provence, France, and Italy,  including the Arthurian Romances--the favourite reading of the Italian  nobles, and the tales of Charlemagne and his Peers--equally in favour  with the common people. There is little reason to suppose that among the  treatises of a scientific and quasi-scientific kind that he fell in  with, and of which he was an eager student, were included the works of  Roger Bacon. These there was a conspiracy among priests and schoolmen to  keep buried. Dante seems to have set little store on ecclesiastical  legends of wonder; at least he gives them a wide berth in his works.    [108] In the notes to Fraticelli's _Vita di Dante_ (Florence 1861) are  given copies of documents relating to the property of the Alighieri, and  of Dante in particular. In 1343 his son Jacopo, by payment of a small  fine, recovered vineyards and farms that had been his father's.--Notes  to Chap. iii. Fraticelli's admirable Life is now in many respects out of  date. He accepts, _e.g._, Dino Compagni as an authority, and believes in  the romantic story of the letter of Fra Ilario.    [109] The details are given by Witte, _Dante-Forschungen_, vol ii. p.  61. The amount borrowed by Dante and his brother (and a friend) comes to  nearly a thousand gold florins. Witte takes this as equivalent to 37,000  francs, _i.e._ nearly L1500. But the florin being the eighth of an  ounce, or about ten shillings' worth of gold, a thousand florins would  be equal only to L500--representing, of course, an immensely greater sum  now-a-days.    [110] _Purg._ viii. 76.    [111] See in Scartazzini, _Dante Alighieri_, 1879, page 552, extract  from the will of her mother Maria Donati, dated February 1314. Many of  these Florentine dates are subject to correction, the year being usually  counted from Lady-Day. 'In 1880 a document was discovered which proves  Gemma to have been engaged in a law-suit in 1332.--_Il Propugnatore_,  xiii^a. 156,'--Scheffer-Boichorst, _Aus Dantes Verbannung_, page 213.    [112] _Purg._ xxiv. 37.    [113] _Inf._ xxi. 40.    [114] _In questo mirifico poeta trovo ampissimo luego la lussuria; e non  solamente ne' giovanili anni, ma ancora ne' maturi._--Boccaccio, _La  Vita di Dante_. After mentioning that Dante was married, he indulges in  a long invective against marriage; confessing, however, that he is  ignorant of whether Dante experienced the miseries he describes. His  conclusion on the subject is that philosophers should leave marriage to  rich fools, to nobles, and to handicraftsmen.    [115] In Purgatory his conscience accuses him of pride, and he already  seems to feel the weight of the grievous burden beneath which the proud  bend as they purge themselves of their sin (_Purg._ xiii. 136). Some  amount of self-accusation seems to be implied in such passages as  _Inf._, v. 142 and _Purg._ xxvii. 15, etc.; but too much must not be  made of it.    [116] In a letter of a few lines to one of the Marquises Malaspina,  written probably in the earlier years of his exile, he tells how his  purpose of renouncing ladies' society and the writing of love-songs had  been upset by the view of a lady of marvellous beauty who 'in all  respects answered to his tastes, habits, and circumstances.' He says he  sends with the letter a poem containing a fuller account of his  subjection to this new passion. The poem is not found attached to the  copy of the letter, but with good reason it is guessed to be the Canzone  beginning _Amor, dacche convien_, which describes how he was  overmastered by a passion born 'in the heart of the mountains in the  valley of that river beside which he had always been the victim of  love.' This points to the Casentino as the scene. He also calls the  Canzone his 'mountain song.' The passion it expresses may be real, but  that he makes the most of it appears from the close, which is occupied  by the thought of how the verses will be taken in Florence.    [117] However early the _De Monarchia_ may have been written, it is  difficult to think that it can be of a later date than the death of  Henry.    [118] The _De Vulgari Eloquio_ is in Latin. Dante's own Italian is  richer and more elastic than that of contemporary writers. Its base is  the Tuscan dialect, as refined by the example of the Sicilian poets. His  Latin, on the contrary, is I believe regarded as being somewhat  barbarous, even for the period.    [119] In his _Quaestio de Aqua et Terra_. In it he speaks of having been  in Mantua. The thesis was maintained in Verona, but of course he may,  after a prolonged absence, have returned to that city.    [120] _Parad._ xvii. 70.    [121] _Purg._ xviii. 121.    [122] But in urgent need of more of it.--He says of 'the sublime  Cantica, adorned with the title of the _Paradiso_', that '_illam sub  praesenti epistola, tamquam sub epigrammate proprio dedicatam, vobis  adscribo, vobis offero, vobis denique recommendo_.' But it may be  questioned if this involves that the Cantica was already finished.    [123] As, for instance, Herr Scheffer-Boichorst in his _Aus Dantes  Verbannung_, 1882.    [124] The Traversari (_Purg._ xiv. 107). Guido's wife was of the  Bagnacavalli (_Purg._ xiv. 115). The only mention of the Polenta family,  apart from that of Francesca, is at _Inf._ xxvii. 41.    [125] In 1350 a sum of ten gold florins was sent from Florence by the  hands of Boccaccio to Beatrice, daughter of Dante; she being then a nun  at Ravenna.    [126] The embassy to Venice is mentioned by Villani, and there was a  treaty concluded in 1321 between the Republic and Guido. But Dante's  name does not appear in it among those of the envoys from Ravenna. A  letter, probably apocryphal, to Guido from Dante in Venice is dated  1314. If Dante, as is maintained by some writers, was engaged in tuition  while in Ravenna, it is to be feared that his pupils would find in him  an impatient master.    [127] Not that Dante ever mentions these any more than a hundred other  churches in which he must have spent thoughtful hours.    [128] _Purg._ xxviii. 20.    [129] A certain Cecco d'Ascoli stuck to him like a bur, charging him,  among other things, with lust, and a want of religious faith which would  one day secure him a place in his own Inferno. Cecco was himself burned  in Florence, in 1327, for making too much of evil spirits, and holding  that human actions are necessarily affected by the position of the  stars. He had been at one time a professor of astronomy.    [130] Gabriel Rossetti, _Comment on the Divina Commedia_, 1826, and  Aroux, _Dante, Heretique, Revolutionnaire et Socialiste_, 1854.
