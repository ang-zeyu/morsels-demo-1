Beds should always be  located between either hiding or feeding districts. In passing from  one to another of these districts, coyotes follow in the main, the  same route, and the experienced eye can soon locate a good place for  a trap bed. These spots may be far apart or they may be near each  other. The past season I had two not more than three yards apart.  Failing to get such a location, the trapper traps by chance and  catches by accident. After a rain the trap bed should be torn up and  sunned awhile. Fresh sign is suspicious. Four traps make a good bed,  but I seldom use more than two. Traps and chains must be well hidden  and the ground left as level as would seem natural.\"    \"If the traps are so fastened as to hold the animal to the spot, that  bed is lost for that season. I prefer small pieces of worn out  machinery, rusty iron, weighing ten or fifteen pounds for clogs. Then  comes the most important matter of all--bait. In this I have deviated  from anything I have ever noticed in guides. I use unrendered beef  fat. Leaf fat is good, but I prefer what is commonly called gut fat.  If taken off without too much care, it is best. Hung up and dried it  lasts indefinitely. This dried article I cut up in pieces from the  size of a pea to the size of the end of my thumb, the smaller the  better, and scatter around over the trap bed, say 10 feet square. If  the bed is in short grass, this baiting is better. The bait must be  carried in a bag for the purpose, and must not be touched, in any  case, until the traps are set. With traps well disinfected this is  the slickest cheat I have ever seen worked on a coyote.\"    Some of the northern trappers will probably smile when they read of  the following set, but the fact that it is used extensively in the  South, proves that it is a good one for that part. It was contributed  by one of the Arizona trappers. \"There is plenty of small timber  here, so the first thing I do when I find a good brush to wire the  bait to, is to cut a drag about three to four feet long and about  three or four inches in diameter about the center of the drag. Cut a  notch on one side and in the center of the drag. Wire the ring of the  trap chain securely to the drag in the notched place with about two  lengths of hay baling wire. Lay the drag on the ground on one side of  the pen and cover with brush. The pen would be brushed up all around  about 18 inches high, except the entrance.\"    \"I make a 'U' shaped enclosure about four feet long with bait wired  to bush in the farther end. The pen should be about a foot wide  inside of the brush. Dig a hole just inside the entrance of the pen  for the trap, which set lengthwise, and cover even with the surface.  Also be sure and cover the trap chain. Instead of cotton under the  pan, I use a piece of canvas that just fits inside of jaws and put  over the pan and cover all with sifted dirt from the hole until level  with the surface. Place a stick across the entrance so that when the  coyote goes up, if he wants to get the meat, he will have to go over  the stick. It should be about eight inches in front of the trap. This  keeps him from digging in the trap.\"    \"Now fill in on both sides of the trap between it and the side of the  pen with small brush or twigs so as to guide his foot into the trap.  Do not put the twigs on the trap where you want him to step. I guide  his feet right into my traps that way. Always lay the bait on the  ground in the pen, wired to the brush or stake in rear end, as  coyotes will not enter pen if bait is hung up. I use horse meat  mostly, but sometimes rabbits and beef. Hawks and ravens are bad on  rabbit baits, and cattle paw the traps up if set with beef.\"    \"I set my traps from one-fourth to one-half mile apart, and use a  fresh rabbit or fresh piece of meat and drag from one trap to the  other, when making my rounds. Also spoiled fish scent is good for a  trail. I never use gloves to prevent human scent in setting traps,  and I consider it nonsense. After the first night a set has been out,  almost any coyote will go into the trap. I use No. 14 Newhouse traps,  and when they catch they never let go.\"    \"I never set traps at a large carcass of a horse or other animal, for  when one does when the coyotes come there to feed and one of their  number steps into a trap, that generally settles it for the rest of  them, and they will not come back. Set traps from one-eighth to  one-fourth of a mile all around the carcass and bait with meat from  the carcass is a good plan.\"    \"I visit my coyote traps daily if possible, as they should not be  left in the traps to frighten others away that would get caught, if  the trap was set, and seeing that coyote in trouble, they will be  very shy about coming up to the place afterward. I ride horse-back  looking after my traps, and am able to get over a good deal of ground  in that way.\"    Another coyote trapper from Texas gives the same method, and adds:  \"For bait take cracklings from either lard or tallow. Heat them in a  skillet and when hot, cut up some garlic and drop in, but don't let  it cook too much. Put the mixture in the pen the same as any other  bait and see how it works. It does fine here, but it might be that  there are so many coyotes here that they will eat any old thing. The  best thing about that kind of bait is the buzzards will not bother  it. I have tried it for coyotes, skunk and badger, and it is good for  all of them.\"    This is the mode of trapping employed by a party from Southern  California: \"Now a word about trapping those cute little coyotes. As  every one has his way of trapping for them so do I. The best way to  catch anything that walks on four legs is to make a fool of them.  Some people may think that is 'hot air', but I know better. The way  to fool an old coyote is to take a fresh sheep skin and drag it, you  riding, on a horse, for a mile or so in the hills near where your man  is in the habit of going, (now be sure you do not touch it with your  hands), until you find an open hill not too high. Have a stake there  beforehand and have your traps set. The traps should be left lying in  the sheep pen for a week before setting. When you get to the stake,  hang your pelt on it, so when the wind blows the pelt will move.\"    \"Mr. Coyote will be sure to find the trail you have made and will  follow it until he sees the pelt, and then he will walk around it for  a night or so, but he will not get too near the first night or for  three or four nights, but he will be sure to get there after a while  and try to pull the skin down, and he will forget about the traps and  everything else, and he will be taken in just like all the other  suckers.\"        CHAPTER XIV.    NORTHERN BAIT METHODS FOR COYOTES.    Mr. C. B. Peyton, who met such a tragic end, while attempting to  arrest a party of game-law violating Indians last fall, wrote the  following article on coyote trapping, several years ago. \"I herewith  submit my method for trapping the coyote, hoping it will be of  interest to the readers. My outfit is as follows: Eighty steel traps,  various sizes 2 to 4 1/2, two saddle horses, one short handle spade,  one hunter's axe, a piece of canvas, some wool; 3 or 4 pounds of  sheep or coyote wool is enough for one day's setting, one 30-40, 95  Model Winchester.    \"When there is a bounty I do not start trapping until the frost is  about all out in the spring. I start some morning with as many traps  as I can set that day, four to the setting, five settings is a fair  day's work if done right. I never bait until I have my entire line  set.\"    \"I have used the following style of setting with fair success, known  as the square set. I select a spot where there is sand or no sod, cut  a stake about 14 inches long, take four traps, fasten chains to  stake, drive stake down until about two inches below surface, pull  traps out about two feet from stake, a No. 2 trap chain is about  right length, making a square set. Now dig out bed for each trap,  placing dirt removed on canvas or blanket. Bed traps so there will be  a half inch of dirt over them when covered; place enough wool under  pan of trap to keep dirt out and keep rabbits or birds from springing  them; leave a mark directly over stake to tell you where to place  bait, when making your rounds with bait sack. Carry what dirt is left  on canvas some distance, before dropping.    \"I prefer a fowl for bait, such as an old dead hen, duck or grouse;  place bait in center of setting on its side, lift a wing and drive a  slender stake thru into the ground to anchor it and drop the wing  down on top of stake to conceal it.\"    \"Now back away a few feet and throw a few handfuls of dry sand or  dirt over your tracks. If your work has been well done, it will be  difficult to tell exactly where your traps are hidden, if your  setting is properly located Mr. Coyote will not be slow to see or  smell bait, as he is always on the lookout for handouts. He will take  careful note of surroundings, if he sees or smells nothing  suspicious, he will attempt to remove bait to some less exposed place  and eat it or hide it for a future repast. He is very careful in  approaching bait, making numerous circles of setting; if they succeed  in reaching bait without stepping in one of the four traps, they soon  find one when they attempt to raise the anchored bait, then begins a  dance that lands him in two or more traps, there to await the coming  of his friend, the trapper.\"    \"Care should be used in killing captured animals, so they will not  bleed on ground as that will spoil"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3457"],[0,"The Man of the Forest (#17)"],[1,"  stream of grays and browns and here and there a black. They were keeping  to a trail over the flats. Dale headed into this trail and, if anything,  trotted a little faster.    Presently the clouds lifted and broke, showing blue sky and one streak  of sunshine. But the augury was without warrant. The wind increased. A  huge black pall bore down from the mountains and it brought rain that  could be seen falling in sheets from above and approaching like a  swiftly moving wall. Soon it enveloped the fugitives.    With head bowed, Helen rode along for what seemed ages in a cold, gray  rain that blew almost on a level. Finally the heavy downpour passed,  leaving a fine mist. The clouds scurried low and dark, hiding the  mountains altogether and making the gray, wet plain a dreary sight.  Helen's feet and knees were as wet as if she had waded in water. And  they were cold. Her gloves, too, had not been intended for rain, and  they were wet through. The cold bit at her fingers so that she had to  beat her hands together. Ranger misunderstood this to mean that he was  to trot faster, which event was worse for Helen than freezing.    She saw another black, scudding mass of clouds bearing down with its  trailing sheets of rain, and this one appeared streaked with white.  Snow! The wind was now piercingly cold. Helen's body kept warm, but  her extremities and ears began to suffer exceedingly. She gazed ahead  grimly. There was no help; she had to go on. Dale and Roy were hunched  down in their saddles, probably wet through, for they wore no rain-proof  coats. Bo kept close behind them, and plain it was that she felt the  cold.    This second storm was not so bad as the first, because there was less  rain. Still, the icy keenness of the wind bit into the marrow. It lasted  for an hour, during which the horses trotted on, trotted on. Again the  gray torrent roared away, the fine mist blew, the clouds lifted and  separated, and, closing again, darkened for another onslaught. This one  brought sleet. The driving pellets stung Helen's neck and cheeks, and  for a while they fell so thick and so hard upon her back that she was  afraid she could not hold up under them. The bare places on the ground  showed a sparkling coverlet of marbles of ice.    Thus, storm after storm rolled over Helen's head. Her feet grew numb  and ceased to hurt. But her fingers, because of her ceaseless efforts  to keep up the circulation, retained the stinging pain. And now the wind  pierced right through her. She marveled at her endurance, and there were  many times that she believed she could not ride farther. Yet she kept  on. All the winters she had ever lived had not brought such a day as  this. Hard and cold, wet and windy, at an increasing elevation--that was  the explanation. The air did not have sufficient oxygen for her blood.    Still, during all those interminable hours, Helen watched where she was  traveling, and if she ever returned over that trail she would recognize  it. The afternoon appeared far advanced when Dale and Roy led down into  an immense basin where a reedy lake spread over the flats. They rode  along its margin, splashing up to the knees of the horses. Cranes and  herons flew on with lumbering motion; flocks of ducks winged swift  flight from one side to the other. Beyond this depression the land  sloped rather abruptly; outcroppings of rock circled along the edge of  the highest ground, and again a dark fringe of trees appeared.    How many miles! wondered Helen. They seemed as many and as long as  the hours. But at last, just as another hard rain came, the pines  were reached. They proved to be widely scattered and afforded little  protection from the storm.    Helen sat her saddle, a dead weight. Whenever Ranger quickened his gait  or crossed a ditch she held on to the pommel to keep from falling  off. Her mind harbored only sensations of misery, and a persistent  thought--why did she ever leave home for the West? Her solicitude for Bo  had been forgotten. Nevertheless, any marked change in the topography  of the country was registered, perhaps photographed on her memory by the  torturing vividness of her experience.    The forest grew more level and denser. Shadows of twilight or gloom lay  under the trees. Presently Dale and Roy, disappeared, going downhill,  and likewise Bo. Then Helen's ears suddenly filled with a roar of rapid  water. Ranger trotted faster. Soon Helen came to the edge of a great  valley, black and gray, so full of obscurity that she could not see  across or down into it. But she knew there was a rushing river at  the bottom. The sound was deep, continuous, a heavy, murmuring roar,  singularly musical. The trail was steep. Helen had not lost all feeling,  as she had believed and hoped. Her poor, mistreated body still responded  excruciatingly to concussions, jars, wrenches, and all the other  horrible movements making up a horse-trot.    For long Helen did not look up. When she did so there lay a green,  willow-bordered, treeless space at the bottom of the valley, through  which a brown-white stream rushed with steady, ear-filling roar.    Dale and Roy drove the pack-animals across the stream, and followed,  going deep to the flanks of their horses. Bo rode into the foaming water  as if she had been used to it all her days. A slip, a fall, would have  meant that Bo must drown in that mountain torrent.    Ranger trotted straight to the edge, and there, obedient to Helen's  clutch on the bridle, he halted. The stream was fifty feet wide, shallow  on the near side, deep on the opposite, with fast current and big waves.  Helen was simply too frightened to follow.    \"Let him come!\" yelled Dale. \"Stick on now!... Ranger!\"    The big black plunged in, making the water fly. That stream was nothing  for him, though it seemed impassable to Helen. She had not the strength  left to lift her stirrups and the water surged over them. Ranger, in two  more plunges, surmounted the bank, and then, trotting across the green  to where the other horses stood steaming under some pines, he gave a  great heave and halted.    Roy reached up to help her off.    \"Thirty miles, Miss Helen,\" he said, and the way he spoke was a  compliment.    He had to lift her off and help her to the tree where Bo leaned. Dale  had ripped off a saddle and was spreading saddle-blankets on the ground  under the pine.    \"Nell--you swore--you loved me!\" was Bo's mournful greeting. The girl  was pale, drawn, blue-lipped, and she could not stand up.    \"Bo, I never did--or I'd never have brought you to this--wretch that I  am!\" cried Helen. \"Oh, what a horrible ride!\"    Rain was falling, the trees were dripping, the sky was lowering. All the  ground was soaking wet, with pools and puddles everywhere. Helen could  imagine nothing but a heartless, dreary, cold prospect. Just then home  was vivid and poignant in her thoughts. Indeed, so utterly miserable  was she that the exquisite relief of sitting down, of a cessation of  movement, of a release from that infernal perpetual-trotting horse,  seemed only a mockery. It could not be true that the time had come for  rest.    Evidently this place had been a camp site for hunters or sheep-herders,  for there were remains of a fire. Dale lifted the burnt end of a log  and brought it down hard upon the ground, splitting off pieces. Several  times he did this. It was amazing to see his strength, his facility, as  he split off handfuls of splinters. He collected a bundle of them, and,  laying them down, he bent over them. Roy wielded the ax on another log,  and each stroke split off a long strip. Then a tiny column of smoke  drifted up over Dale's shoulder as he leaned, bareheaded, sheltering the  splinters with his hat. A blaze leaped up. Roy came with an armful of  strips all white and dry, out of the inside of a log. Crosswise these  were laid over the blaze, and it began to roar. Then piece by piece the  men built up a frame upon which they added heavier woods, branches  and stumps and logs, erecting a pyramid through which flames and smoke  roared upward. It had not taken two minutes. Already Helen felt the  warmth on her icy face. She held up her bare, numb hands.    Both Dale and Roy were wet through to the skin, yet they did not tarry  beside the fire. They relieved the horses. A lasso went up between two  pines, and a tarpaulin over it, V-shaped and pegged down at the four  ends. The packs containing the baggage of the girls and the supplies and  bedding were placed under this shelter.    Helen thought this might have taken five minutes more. In this short  space of time the fire had leaped and flamed until it was huge and hot.  Rain was falling steadily all around, but over and near that roaring  blaze, ten feet high, no water fell. It evaporated. The ground began to  steam and to dry. Helen suffered at first while the heat was driving out  the cold. But presently the pain ceased.    \"Nell, I never knew before how good a fire could feel,\" declared Bo.    And therein lay more food for Helen's reflection.    In ten minutes Helen was dry and hot. Darkness came down upon the  dreary, sodden forest, but that great camp-fire made it a different  world from the one Helen had anticipated. It blazed and roared, cracked  like a pistol, hissed and sputtered, shot sparks everywhere, and sent  aloft a dense, yellow, whirling column of smoke. It began to have a  heart of gold.    Dale took a long pole and raked out a pile of red embers upon which the  coffee-pot and oven soon began to steam.    \"Roy, I promised the girls turkey to-night,\" said the hunter.    \"Mebbe to-morrow, if the wind shifts. This 's turkey country.\"    \"Roy, a potato will do me!\" exclaimed Bo. \"Never again will I ask for  cake and pie! I never appreciated good things to eat. And I've been a  little pig, always. I never--never knew what it was to be hungry--until  now.\"    Dale glanced up quickly.    \"Lass, it's worth learnin',\" he said."]]]
