Grease and season the outside after  stuffing is done,--never before it. If game is shot-torn, soak for ten  minutes in weak salt water after plucking, rinse in cold salt water,  wipe dry and drain.    Furred game, as rabbits, squirrels, possums, ought to be drawn before it  is cold, if you would have the finest flavor. This is especially  necessary with possums--which should be bought alive, and fattened for  several weeks in a clean cage, feeding them on bread, milk, apples,  potatoes, cabbage leaves, and grass. This makes them tender and much  more delicate in flavor. Kill by dislocating the neck with a quick,  upward jerk, then cut the throat and hang to bleed. Roll after dampening  fur well in very hot embers--then scrape the same as a pig, draw, and  hang to cool. Divide the skin of rabbits and squirrels around the  middle, and pull off each half, the same as a kid glove. Thus no hairs  stick on the clean flesh. Draw very quickly, wipe lightly with a damp  cloth, and hang where it is cool and airy for at least an hour.    _Roast Turkey_: Make a stuffing of stale bread. Cut the crusts from a  small loaf, grate the crumb, brown crusts crisp, crush, sift and mix  well with the gratings. Shred finely through it four ounces fresh suet,  and a lump of butter the size of an egg. Add a tiny heart of celery cut  small, half a tart apple also cut fine, two dozen fat raisins, seeded,  halved, and soaked for twelve hours in whiskey to cover, salt, pepper,  and paprika to taste. Mix well, stuff the turkey but not too tight. Put  a handful in the crop space, and fasten the skin neatly over. Truss your  turkey firmly, rub all over with soft fat, then sprinkle with salt and  pepper, and set upon a rack in a deep roasting pan, pour half an inch of  water in the bottom, cover tight, put in a hot oven, and roast for an  hour, then slack heat and finish. The turkey will brown thus covered,  and be tenderer and sweeter than if crisped uncovered. The pan will  hold gravy better than can be made otherwise.    Roast chickens or capons in exactly the same way. Geese need to be  roasted more slowly and to have a seasoning of sage, onion, and tart  apple in the stuffing, instead of raisins. The dry stuffing takes up the  juices of the fowl, and is much more flavorous, and less pasty than that  which is wet before use.    _Guinea Hen in Casserole_: Stick six cloves in a cored and pared apple,  thrust a heart of celery in the core space, then fit it inside a guinea  hen, buttered, salted and peppered inside. Pack in grated bread  crumbs--all there is space for. Truss, grease, season, set in a hot  oven, and brown lightly all over, then lay in a casserole on a bed of  sliced carrots, young green peas, shredded green peppers, sliced  tomatoes and tiny onions, parboiled for five minutes. Add a large lump  of butter, rolled in flour, a cup of hot water or weak broth, cover  close, and cook an hour in a hot oven. Serve on the vegetables, bedded  firmly, with tart jelly melted to barely run, splashed over the breast.    _Chickens in Blankets_: Take young fat chickens about three pounds  weight, dress as for roasting, put inside each a peeled sweet potato,  and a small lump of butter, after greasing and seasoning inside and out.  Lay on low rack in deep pan, brown lightly in oven, then fit close over  each a round of good short crust, rolled a quarter-inch thick. Return to  oven--when crust is a rich brown the chickens will be done. Serve crust  with each portion--thereby recalling a glorified chicken pie.    _Fried Chicken_: Cut into joints two tender young chickens, wipe the  pieces dry, season with salt and pepper, red and black, then set on ice.  Fry a pound of streaky bacon in a deep skillet, take out when crisp,  roll chicken in flour, dip in beaten egg, then roll again, and lay in  the fat, which must be bubbling hot, but not scorching. Cook, turning  often, to a rich brown, take out, then pile in a pan, set the pan over  another with boiling water in the bottom, and put all in a very hot  oven for fifteen minutes. This cooks the chicken through and through  without making it hard. The pieces must not touch in frying so there  will be two skilletfuls. When all the chicken is fried, and in the oven,  dredge in more flour, stir it well through the fat, then add a cup of  cream, stirring hard all the time, and letting it barely simmer--boiling  curdles it. Or if you want a full-cream gravy, pour off the fat, stir  the cream in double quantity in the skillet to take up the flavors, then  pour it in a double boiler, add pepper, salt, minced celery, a little  onion juice, and one at a time, lumps of butter, rolled well in flour.  Cook until thick and rich, and serve in a gravy boat.    _Smothered Chicken_: Get two pound broilers fat and tender, have them  split down the back, make clean, season by buttering inside and out,  sprinkling with salt, pepper and paprika, and dredging with flour. Lay  breasts down, upon a low rack in a deep pan, cover with slices of  streaky bacon, shingling the slices well. Dredge with pepper and flour,  lay in sliced tomatoes, shredded green peppers, and a few small  parboiled onions. Add lumps of butter rolled in flour, dotting them all  about the bacon. Pour in enough water to barely reach the top of the  rack, cover the pan close, and cook in a hot oven, about an hour.  Uncover after three-quarters of an hour, add a half-cup more water--this  is for the gravy. Cover again, and finish cooking. The chickens should  be brown all over but meltingly tender. Take up on a hot dish, breaking  the bacon slices as little as possible. Serve the vegetables separate,  also the gravy from the pan. The vegetables can be omitted, and  smothered chicken still be a dish to rejoice an epicure.    _Glorified Chicken Croquets_: (Mrs. G. H. Patch.) Boil a large-size  tender young chicken till the meat almost drops from the bones. Boil  likewise tender, in salt water, one pound either sweetbreads or calf  brains. Pick up the chicken and grind the meat fine, then mash it well  together with the brains or sweetbreads, and season to taste. Put into a  double boiler half-pint cream, tablespoonful butter, two tablespoonfuls  flour, one tablespoonful parsley chopped fine, one teaspoonful onion  juice, one teaspoonful salt, black and Cayenne pepper to taste. Cook  smooth, stirring hard, let thicken, then add the meat, and mix  thoroughly. Let cool, shape into croquets, dip in egg, roll in cracker  crumbs, and fry quickly in deep hot fat.    _Chicken-Turkey Hash_: Cut the meat small, freeing of skin and gristle.  If there is rich gravy left, put it into a skillet, and cook tender in  it, half a dozen sliced tomatoes, three shredded green peppers, a small  sliced onion, and a cupful of raw potato cubes. Lacking gravy, cook in  butter or bacon fat, and season to taste--gravy requires less seasoning  than plain fat. Add the meat, pour in a cup of boiling water, stir all  well together, and cook for five minutes. Serve in a hot dish lined with  thin toast. Fine for breakfast, or a very late supper.    _Rabbit or Squirrel Smothered_: Leave whole, rub over with fat, season  highly, lay in a pan or skillet, with slices of bacon, add a cup of hot  water, cover close, set over the fire, and simmer until tender.  Uncover, and brown in the gravy, adding a little Cayenne vinegar at the  very last.    _Rabbit or Squirrel Barbecued_: Leave whole, skewer flat, grease all  over, lay on rack in pan, and roast in hot oven, basting every five  minutes with hot salt water. When crisp, take up and serve with the  sauce directed for barbecued lamb.    _Quail_: Smother quail the same as rabbits. I like them better halved,  and fried crisp and quickly, in deep hot bacon fat. But to make the most  of them, a pie's the thing. The crust must be rich and rolled a  quarter-inch thick. Put in the birds whole, seasoning them well inside  and out, with salt and black pepper. Put in also generous lumps of  butter rolled in flour, slices of fat bacon, strips of crust an inch  wide and three inches long, a little minced onion, celery or shredded  green pepper if the flavors are approved, and a tiny pod of Cayenne  pepper. Pour in cold water till it stands half way up the birds. Be sure  the cover-crust is plenty big--pinch it down tight, prick and make a  cross-cut at the center into which a tubelet of paper must be thrust to  prevent the gravy's boiling over. Bake three-quarters of an hour, in a  hot oven. Take up, and serve very hot. A gill of hot cream poured in  through a funnel after taking up suits some palates--mine is not among  them. Other folks like a wineglass of sherry made very hot.    _Wild Duck_: If likely to be fishy, soak an hour in vinegar and water  made very salt, and roast with an onion inside stuck very full of  cloves. Season inside and out, rub over with fat or butter, and roast in  quick heat, to the degree required. Ducks or geese mild in flavor should  be roasted with a tart apple stuck with cloves inside, also a mild  onion. Rub over with fat, season with salt and pepper inside and out,  and strew inside lightly a small pinch of powdered sage. A good sauce  for them is made by browning half a cup of grated bread crumbs in a  tablespoonful of butter, adding to it a spoonful of tart jelly, a  wineglass of claret, a tablespoonful of tomato catsup, with seasoning  to taste of salt and pepper.    _Possum Roasted_: Chill thoroughly after scraping and drawing. Save all  the inside fat, let it soak in weak salt water until cooking time, then  rinse it well, and partly try it out in the pan before putting in the  possum. Unless he is huge, leave him whole, skewering him flat, and  laying him skin side up in the pan. Set in a hot oven and cook until  crisply tender, taking care there is no scorching.

C. Jones).        Tyr's Sword    According to an ancient legend, Cheru's sword, which had been fashioned  by the same dwarfs, sons of Ivald, who had also made Odin's spear,  was held very sacred by his people, to whose care he had entrusted it,  declaring that those who possessed it were sure to have the victory  over their foes. But although carefully guarded in the temple, where  it was hung so that it reflected the first beams of the morning sun,  it suddenly and mysteriously disappeared one night. A Vala, druidess,  or prophetess, consulted by the priests, revealed that the Norns had  decreed that whoever wielded it would conquer the world and come  to his death by it; but in spite of all entreaties she refused to  tell who had taken it or where it might be found. Some time after  this occurrence a tall and dignified stranger came to Cologne, where  Vitellius, the Roman prefect, was feasting, and called him away from  his beloved dainties. In the presence of the Roman soldiery he gave  him the sword, telling him it would bring him glory and renown, and  finally hailed him as emperor. The cry was taken up by the assembled  legions, and Vitellius, without making any personal effort to secure  the honour, found himself elected Emperor of Rome.    The new ruler, however, was so absorbed in indulging his taste for  food and drink that he paid but little heed to the divine weapon. One  day while leisurely making his way towards Rome he carelessly left it  hanging in the antechamber to his pavilion. A German soldier seized  this opportunity to substitute in its stead his own rusty blade, and  the besotted emperor did not notice the exchange. When he arrived at  Rome, he learned that the Eastern legions had named Vespasian emperor,  and that he was even then on his way home to claim the throne.    Searching for the sacred weapon to defend his rights, Vitellius  now discovered the theft, and, overcome by superstitious fears, did  not even attempt to fight. He crawled away into a dark corner of his  palace, whence he was ignominiously dragged by the enraged populace to  the foot of the Capitoline Hill. There the prophecy was duly fulfilled,  for the German soldier, who had joined the opposite faction, coming  along at that moment, cut off Vitellius' head with the sacred sword.    The German soldier now changed from one legion to another, and  travelled over many lands; but wherever he and his sword were found,  victory was assured. After winning great honour and distinction, this  man, having grown old, retired from active service to the banks of the  Danube, where he secretly buried his treasured weapon, building his hut  over its resting-place to guard it as long as he might live. When he  lay on his deathbed he was implored to reveal where he had hidden it,  but he persistently refused to do so, saying that it would be found  by the man who was destined to conquer the world, but that he would  not be able to escape the curse. Years passed by. Wave after wave  the tide of barbarian invasion swept over that part of the country,  and last of all came the terrible Huns under the leadership of Attila,  the \"Scourge of God.\" As he passed along the river, he saw a peasant  mournfully examining his cow's foot, which had been wounded by some  sharp instrument hidden in the long grass, and when search was made  the point of a buried sword was found sticking out of the soil.    Attila, seeing the beautiful workmanship and the fine state of  preservation of this weapon, immediately exclaimed that it was  Cheru's sword, and brandishing it above his head he announced that  he would conquer the world. Battle after battle was fought by the  Huns, who, according to the Saga, were everywhere victorious, until  Attila, weary of warfare, settled down in Hungary, taking to wife the  beautiful Burgundian princess Ildico, whose father he had slain. This  princess, resenting the murder of her kin and wishing to avenge it,  took advantage of the king's state of intoxication upon his wedding  night to secure possession of the divine sword, with which she slew  him in his bed, once more fulfilling the prophecy uttered so many  years before.    The magic sword again disappeared for a long time, to be unearthed once  more, for the last time, by the Duke of Alva, Charles V.'s general,  who shortly after won the victory of Muehlberg (1547). The Franks  were wont to celebrate yearly martial games in honour of the sword;  but it is said that when the heathen gods were renounced in favour  of Christianity, the priests transferred many of their attributes to  the saints, and that this sword became the property of the Archangel  St. Michael, who has wielded it ever since.    Tyr, whose name was synonymous with bravery and wisdom, was also  considered by the ancient Northern people to have the white-armed  Valkyrs, Odin's attendants, at his command, and they thought that  he it was who designated the warriors whom they should transfer to  Valhalla to aid the gods on the last day.          \"The god Tyr sent      Gondul and Skogul      To choose a king      Of the race of Ingve,      To dwell with Odin      In roomy Valhal.\"                Norse Mythology (R. B. Anderson).        The Story of Fenris    Tyr was generally spoken of and represented as one-armed, just as Odin  was called one-eyed. Various explanations are offered by different  authorities; some claim that it was because he could give the victory  only to one side; others, because a sword has but one blade. However  this may be, the ancients preferred to account for the fact in the  following way:    Loki married secretly at Joetun-heim the hideous giantess Angur-boda  (anguish boding), who bore him three monstrous children--the wolf  Fenris, Hel, the parti-coloured goddess of death, and Ioermungandr,  a terrible serpent. He kept the existence of these monsters secret as  long as he could; but they speedily grew so large that they could no  longer remain confined in the cave where they had come to light. Odin,  from his throne Hlidskialf, soon became aware of their existence,  and also of the disquieting rapidity with which they increased in  size. Fearful lest the monsters, when they had gained further strength,  should invade Asgard and destroy the gods, Allfather determined to  get rid of them, and striding off to Joetun-heim, he flung Hel into  the depths of Nifl-heim, telling her she could reign over the nine  dismal worlds of the dead. He then cast Ioermungandr into the sea,  where he attained such immense proportions that at last he encircled  the earth and could bite his own tail.          \"Into mid-ocean's dark depths hurled,        Grown with each day to giant size,      The serpent soon inclosed the world,        With tail in mouth, in circle-wise;          Held harmless still          By Odin's will.\"                Valhalla (J. C. Jones).      None too well pleased that the serpent should attain such fearful  dimensions in his new element, Odin resolved to lead Fenris to  Asgard, where he hoped, by kindly treatment, to make him gentle  and tractable. But the gods one and all shrank in dismay when they  saw the wolf, and none dared approach to give him food except Tyr,  whom nothing daunted. Seeing that Fenris daily increased in size,  strength, voracity, and fierceness, the gods assembled in council  to deliberate how they might best dispose of him. They unanimously  decided that as it would desecrate their peace-steads to slay him,  they would bind him fast so that he could work them no harm.    With that purpose in view, they obtained a strong chain named Laeding,  and then playfully proposed to Fenris to bind this about him as a test  of his vaunted strength. Confident in his ability to release himself,  Fenris patiently allowed them to bind him fast, and when all stood  aside, with a mighty effort he stretched himself and easily burst  the chain asunder.    Concealing their chagrin, the gods were loud in praise of his strength,  but they next produced a much stronger fetter, Droma, which, after  some persuasion, the wolf allowed them to fasten around him as  before. Again a short, sharp struggle sufficed to burst this bond,  and it is proverbial in the North to use the figurative expressions,  \"to get loose out of Laeding,\" and \"to dash out of Droma,\" whenever  great difficulties have to be surmounted.          \"Twice did the AEsir strive to bind,      Twice did they fetters powerless find;      Iron or brass of no avail,      Naught, save through magic, could prevail.\"                Valhalla (J. C. Jones).      The gods, perceiving now that ordinary bonds, however strong, would  never prevail against the Fenris wolf's great strength, bade Skirnir,  Frey's servant, go down to Svart-alfa-heim and bid the dwarfs fashion  a bond which nothing could sever.    By magic arts the dark elves manufactured a slender silken rope from  such impalpable materials as the sound of a cat's footsteps, a woman's  beard, the roots of a mountain, the longings of the bear, the voice of  fishes, and the spittle of birds, and when it was finished they gave  it to Skirnir, assuring him that no strength would avail to break it,  and that the more it was strained the stronger it would become.          \"Gleipnir, at last,      By Dark Elves cast,      In Svart-alf-heim, with strong spells wrought,      To Odin was by Skirnir brought:      As soft as silk, as light as air,      Yet still of magic power most rare.\"                Valhalla (J. C. Jones).      Armed with this bond, called Gleipnir, the gods went with Fenris to the  Island of Lyngvi, in the middle of Lake Amsvartnir, and again proposed  to test his strength. But although Fenris had grown still stronger,  he mistrusted the bond which looked so slight. He therefore refused to"]]]
