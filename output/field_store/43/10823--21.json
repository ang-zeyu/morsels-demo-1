My oldest girl used to take the place of a  cowboy, and put her hair up in her hat. And ride! My goodness, she loved  to ride! They thought she was a boy. She wore pants and leggin's. And  maybe you think she couldn't ride!    \"After we left that ranch, we took up some state land. I couldn't tell  you how big that place was. We had 640 in one place and 640 in another  place; it was a good big place. After my husband got sick, we had to let  it go back. We couldn't pay it out. We only lived on it about four  years.    \"My husband has been dead about nineteen years. I had a pen full and a  half of chillen. I have four livin' chillen, two girls and two boys. I  have a girl, Carrie, in California, workin' in the fruit all the time;  one boy, George, in Arizona, workin' in the mines; and a girl in  Arizona, Lavinia, washes and irons and cooks and ever'thing else she can  get at. And I have one boy here. I have ten grandchillen and I've got  five great grandchillen.    \"I belong to the Methodist Church. I joined about twenty-five years ago.  My husband joined with me. But here, of late years, when I go to church,  it makes me mad to see how the people do the preacher up there trying to  do all the good he can do and them settin' back there laughin' and  talkin'. I was baptized. There was about five or six of us baptized in  the Leona down here.    \"People tell that I've got plenty and don't need help. Even the Mexkins  here and ever'body say I've got money. Jes' because we had that farm  down there they think I come out with money. But what in the world would  I want with money if I didn't use it? I can't take it with me when I die  and I could be gettin' the use of it now while I need it. I could have  what I want to eat, anyway. I'm gettin' a little pension, but it ain't  near enough to keep us. I've got these two grandchillen here, and things  is so high, too, so I don't have enough of anything without skimpin' all  the time.          420312           ELVIRA BOLES, 94, has outlived nine of her ten children. She lives       at 3109 Manzana St., El Paso, Texas, with her daughter, Minnie. She       was born a slave of the Levi Ray family near Lexington,       Mississippi, and was sold as a child to Elihn Boles, a neighboring       plantation owner. During the last year of the Civil War she was       brought to Texas, with other refugee slaves.      \"I jus' 'member my first marster and missus, 'cause she don' want me  there. I'se a child of the marster. Dey didn' tell me how old I was when  dey sold me to Boles. My missus sold me to Boles. Dey tuk us to where  dere was a heap of white folks down by the court house and we'd be there  in lots and den de whites 'ud bid for us. I don' know how old I was, but  I washed dishes and den dey put me to work in de fields. We don' git a  nickel in slavery.    \"Marster Boles didn' have many slaves on de farm, but lots in brickyard.  I toted brick back and put 'em down where dey had to be. Six bricks each  load all day. That's de reason I ain't no 'count, I'se worked to death.  I fired de furnace for three years. Stan'in' front wid hot fire on my  face. Hard work, but God was wid me. We'd work 'till dark, quit awhile  after sundown. Marster was good to slaves, didn' believe in jus' lashin'  'em. He'd not be brutal but he'd kill 'em dead right on the spot.  Overseers 'ud git after 'em and whop 'em down.    \"I'se seventeen, maybe, when I married to slave of Boles. Married on  Saturday night. Dey give me a dress and dey had things to eat, let me  have something like what you call a party. We just had common clothes  on. And then I had to work every day. I'd leave my baby cryin' in de  yard and he'd be cryin', but I couldn' stay. Done everything but split  rails. I've cut timber and ploughed. Done everything a man could do. I  couldn' notice de time, but I'd be glad to git back to my baby.    \"Log cabins had dirt floor, sometimes plankin' down. I worked late and  made pretty quilts. Sometimes dey'd let us have a party. Saturday  nights, de white people give us meat and stuff. Give us syrup and we'd  make candy, out in de yard. We'd ask our frien's and dance all night.  Den go to work next day. We'd clean off de yard and dance out dere.  Christmas come, dey give us a big eggnog and give us cake. Our white  folks did. White folks chillen had bought candy. We didn' git any, but  dey let us play wid de white chillen. We'd play smut. Whoever beat wid  de cards, he'd git to smut you. Take de smut from fireplace and rub on  your face.    \"Doctor take care of us iffen we sick, so's git us well to git us to  work.    \"Iffen dey had a pretty girl dey would take 'em, and I'se one of 'em,  and my oldest child, he boy by Boles, almost white.    \"We had to steal away at night to have church on de ditch bank, and  crawl home on de belly.

Freedom was give Jan. 1, 1865, but de slaves  didn' know it 'till June 19. We'se refugees. Boles, our marster, sent us  out and we come from Holmes County to Cherokee County in a wagon. We was  a dodgin' in and out, runnin' from de Yankees. Marster said dey was  runnin' us from de Yankees to keep us, but we was free and didn' know  it. I lost my baby, its buried somewhere on dat road. Died at Red River  and we left it. De white folks go out and buy food 'long de road and  hide us. Dey say we'd never be free iffen dey could git to Texas wid us,  but de people in Texas tol' us we's free. Den marster turn us loose in  de world, without a penny. Oh, dey was awful times. We jus' worked from  place to place after freedom.    \"When we started from Mississippi, dey tol' us de Yankees 'ud kill us  iffen dey foun' us, and dey say, 'You ain't got no time to take nothin'  to whar you goin'. Take your little bundle and leave all you has in your  house.' So when we got to Texas I jus' had one dress, what I had on.  Dat's de way all de cullud people was after freedom, never had nothin'  but what had on de back. Some of dem had right smart in dere cabins, but  they was skeered and dey lef' everything.

Johnson, who farmed       at Johnson Station in Tarrant County. He owned Betty's parents,       five sisters and four brothers, in addition to about 75 other       slaves. After the family was freed, they moved with the other       slaves to a piece of land Col. Johnson allowed them the use of       until his death. Betty lives in a negro settlement at Stop Six, a       suburb of Fort Worth.      \"I'se bo'n April 4th, in 1857, at Johnson Station. It was named after my  marster.

The food of these tribes  consisted of caribou, deer, moose, and musk-ox together with smaller  animals such as the beaver and hare. They also ate various kinds of  birds and the fish found in the numerous lakes and rivers. They killed  deer by driving them into an angle formed by two converging rows  of stakes, where they were shot by hunters lying in wait. Among the  Kawchodinne tribe near Great Bear Lake hares were the chief source of  both food and clothing. When an unusually severe winter or some other  disaster diminished the supply, the Indians believed that the animals  had mounted to the sky by means of the trees and would return by the  same way. In 1841 owing to scarcity of hares many of this tribe died of  starvation, and numerous acts of cannibalism are said to have occurred.  Small wonder that civilization was low and that infanticide, especially  of female children, was common. Among such people women were naturally  treated with a minimum of respect. Since they were not skilled as  hunters, there was relatively little which they could contribute toward  the sustenance of the family. Hence they were held in low esteem, for  among most primitive people woman is valued largely in proportion to her  economic contribution. Her low position is illustrated by the peculiar  funeral custom of the Takulli, an Athapascan tribe on the Upper Frazer  River. A widow was obliged to remain upon the funeral pyre of her  husband till the flames reached her own body. When the fire had died  down she collected the ashes of her dead and placed them in a basket,  which she was obliged to carry with her during three years of servitude  in the family of her husband. At the end of that time a feast was held,  when she was released from thraldom and permitted to remarry if she  desired.    Poor and degraded as the people of the northern forests may have  been, they had their good traits. The Kutchins of the Yukon and Lower  Mackenzie regions, though they killed their female children, were  exceedingly hospitable and kept guests for months. Each head of a family  took his turn in feasting the whole band. On such occasions etiquette  required the host to fast until the guests had departed. At such feasts  an interesting wrestling game was played. First the smallest boys began  to wrestle. The victors wrestled with those next in strength and so on  until finally the strongest and freshest man in the band remained the  final victor. Then the girls and women went through the same progressive  contest. It is hard to determine whether the people of the northern  pine forest were more or less competent than their Eskimo neighbors. It  perhaps makes little difference, for it is doubtful whether even a  race with brilliant natural endowments could rise far in the scale of  civilization under conditions so highly adverse.    The Eskimos of the northern coasts and the people of the pine forests  were not the only aborigines whose development was greatly retarded  because they could not practice agriculture. All the people of  the Pacific coast from Alaska to Lower California were in similar  circumstances. Nevertheless those living along the northern part of this  coast rose to a much higher level than did those of California. This has  sometimes been supposed to show that geographical environment has  little influence upon civilization, but in reality it proves exactly the  opposite.    The coast of British Columbia was one of the three chief centers of  aboriginal America. As The Encyclopaedia Britannica * puts it: \"The  Haida people constituted with little doubt the finest race and that most  advanced in the arts of the entire west coast of North America.\" They  and their almost equally advanced Tlingit and Tsimshian neighbors on the  mainland displayed much mechanical skill, especially in canoe-building,  woodcarving, and the working of stone and copper, as well as in making  blankets and baskets. To this day they earn a considerable amount of  money by selling their carved objects of wood and slate to traders and  tourists. Their canoes were hollowed out of logs of cedar and were often  very large. Houses which were sometimes 40 by 100 feet were built of  huge cedar beams and planks, which were first worked with stone and  were then put together at great feasts. These correspond to the \"raising  bees\" at which the neighbors gathered to erect the frames of houses in  early New England. Each Haida house ordinarily had a single carved totem  pole in the middle of the gable end which faced toward the beach. Often  the end posts in front were also carved and the whole house was painted.  Another evidence of the fairly advanced state of the Haidas was their  active commercial intercourse with regions hundreds of miles away.  At their \"potlatches,\" as the raising bees were called by the whites,  trading went on vigorously. Carved copper plates were among the articles  which they esteemed of highest value. Standing in the tribe depended  on the possession of property rather than on ability in war, in which  respect the Haidas were more like the people of today than were any of  the other Indian tribes.          * 11th Edition, vol. XXII, p. 730.      Slavery was common among the Haidas. Even as late as 1861, 7800 Tlingits  held 828 slaves. Slavery may not be a good institution in itself, but  it indicates that people are well-to-do, that they dwell in permanent  abodes, and that they have a well-established social order. Among the  more backward Iroquois, captives rarely became genuine slaves, for the  social and economic organization was not sufficiently developed to admit  of this. The few captives who were retained after a fight were adopted  into the tribe of the captors or else were allowed to live with them and  shift for themselves--a practice very different from that of the Haidas.    Another feature of the Haidas' life which showed comparative progress  was the social distinctions which existed among them. One of the ways  in which individuals maintained their social position was by giving away  quantities of goods of all kinds at the potlatches which they organized.  A man sometimes went so far as to strip himself of nearly every  possession except his house. In return for this, however, he obtained  what seemed to him an abundant reward in the respect with which his  fellow-tribesmen afterward regarded him. At subsequent potlatches he  received in his turn a measure of their goods in proportion to his own  gifts, so that he was sometimes richer than before. These potlatches  were social as well as industrial functions, and dancing and singing  were interspersed with the feasting. One of the amusements was a musical  contest in which singers from one tribe or band would contend with  one another as to which could remember the greatest number of songs or  accurately repeat a new song after hearing it for the first time. At the  potlatches the children of chiefs were initiated into secret societies.  They had their noses, ears, and lips pierced for ornaments, and some  of them were tattooed. This great respect for social position which the  Haidas manifested is doubtless far from ideal, but it at least indicates  that a part of the tribe was sufficiently advanced to accumulate  property and to pass it on to its descendants--a custom that is almost  impossible among tribes which move from place to place. The question  suggests itself why these coast barbarians were so much in advance  of their neighbors a few hundred miles away in the pine woods of the  mountains. The climate was probably one reason for this superiority.  Instead of being in a region like the center of the pine forests of  British Columbia where human energy is sapped by six or eight months of  winter, the Haidas enjoyed conditions like those of Scotland. Although  snow fell occasionally, severe cold was unknown. Nor was there great  heat in summer. The Haidas dwelt where both bodily strength and mental  activity were stimulated. In addition to this advantage of a favorable  climate these Indians had a large and steady supply of food close at  hand. Most of their sustenance was obtained from the sea and from the  rivers, in which the runs of salmon furnished abundant provisions, which  rarely failed. In Hecate Strait, between the Queen Charlotte Islands and  the mainland, there were wonderfully productive halibut fisheries, from  which a supply of fish was dried and packed away for the winter, so that  there was always a store of provisions on hand. The forests in their  turn furnished berries and seeds, as well as bears, mountain goats, and  other game.    Moreover the people of the northwest coast had the advantage of not  being forced to move from place to place in order to follow the fish.  They lived on a drowned shore where bays, straits, and sounds are  extraordinarily numerous. The great waves of the Pacific are shut out  by the islands so that the waterways are almost always safe for canoes.  Instead of moving their dwellings in order to follow the food supply,  as the Eskimo and the people of the pine forest were forced to do, the  Haidas and their neighbors were able without difficulty to bring their  food home. At all seasons the canoes made it easy to transport large  supplies of fish from places even a hundred miles away. Having settled  dwellings, the Haidas could accumulate property and acquire that feeling  of permanence which is one of the most important conditions for the  development of civilization. Doubtless the Haidas were intellectually  superior to many other tribes, but even if they had not been greatly  superior, their surroundings would probably have made them stand  relatively high in the scale of civilization. Southward from the Haidas,  around Puget Sound and in Washington and Oregon, there was a gradual  decline in civilization. The "]]]
