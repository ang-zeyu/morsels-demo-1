He will be able to explain it more fully than  I.\"    \"Paradighty!\" said the Queen in her own language. \"Why did we not  think of that before! Fetch him back again at once!\"    So two of the warriors fetched the youth from prison, and he was soon  standing before the Assembly, with his head held as high and his eyes  as bright and shining as before.    \"Read us the token!\" commanded the King.    The youth bowed low. \"The Princess read it aright yesterday. It is a  token of love.\"    \"Explain yourself!\" said the King. \"How can a beast with horns be a  token of love?\"    The youth drew himself up to his full height.    \"It is not a beast,\" said he. \"It is the branch of a holly-tree. On  this day of the year, which in my country we call Christmas Day, our  people decorate their houses with branches of this holly or holy tree  as a token of love and peace and good-will. This is the message that I  have brought to you--a message that we in our country know very well,  but which you have never heard before.\"    The King and the Warriors, the Wise Men, the Queen and Princesses all  listened to his words in silence.    When he had ended there was a long pause.    \"And in what particular way does your message affect us?\" said the  King at last.    \"Thus, your Majesty,\" answered the youth, approaching the Youngest  Princess and taking both her hands in his, \"on this day I, Prince  Moldo, would have peace and good-will between my kingdom and your  kingdom; and I would seal it for ever by taking the Youngest Princess  home with me as my bride. You, O King, recognized me not, for I have  much changed since I lived here with her for playfellow, but in all my  wanderings I found a Pearl of no greater price than this, and I would  proclaim to all the world that the Secret of Happiness is Love.\"    So on that very Christmas Day they were married, amid great  rejoicings, and war ceased throughout the kingdom. And on every  Christmas Day for ever after, the people of that country decorated  their houses with holly, the symbol of love and peace and good-will,  and wished each other a Merry Christmas, even as I do now to you.          THE WILLOW MAN          There once was a Willow, and he was very old,      And all his leaves fell off from him, and left him in the cold;      But ere the rude winter could buffet him with snow,      There grew upon his hoary head a crop of Mistletoe.        All wrinkled and furrowed was this old Willow's skin      His taper fingers trembled, and his arms were very thin;      Two round eyes and hollow, that stared but did not see,      And sprawling feet that never walked, had this most ancient tree.        A Dame who dwelt a-near was the only one who knew      That every year upon his head the Christmas berries grew;      And when the Dame cut them, she said--it was her whim--      \"A merry Christmas to you, Sir,\" _and left a bit for him_.        \"Oh, Granny dear, tell us,\" the children cried, \"where we      May find the shining mistletoe that grows upon the tree?\"      At length the Dame told them, but cautioned them to mind      To greet the willow civilly, _and leave a bit behind_.        \"Who cares,\" said the children, \"for this old Willow-man?      We'll take the Mistletoe, and he may catch us if he can.\"      With rage the ancient Willow shakes in every limb,      For they have taken all, and _have not left a bit for him_.        Then bright gleamed the holly, the Christmas berries shone      But in the wintry wind, without the Willow-man did moan:      \"Ungrateful, and wasteful! the mystic Mistletoe      A hundred years hath grown on me, but never more shall grow.\"        A year soon passed by, and the children came once more,      But not a sprig of Mistletoe the aged Willow bore.      Each slender spray pointed; he mocked them in his glee,      And chuckled in his wooden heart, that ancient Willow-tree.        O children, who gather the spoils of wood and wold,      From selfish greed and wilful waste your little hands withhold.      Though fair things be common, this moral bear in mind,      \"Pick thankfully and modestly, _and leave a bit behind_.\"                            Juliana Horatia Ewing.          THE IVY GREEN          Oh, a dainty plant is the ivy green,        That creepeth o'er ruins old!      Of right choice food are his meals, I ween,        In his cell so lone and cold.      The wall must be crumbled, the stone decayed        To pleasure his dainty whim;      And the mouldering dust that years have made,        Is a merry meal for him.          Creeping where no life is seen,          A rare old plant is the ivy green.                            Charles Dickens.          LEGEND OF SAINT NICHOLAS    Amy Steedman      Of all the saints that little children love is there any to compare  with Santa Claus? The very sound of his name has magic in it, and  calls up visions of well-filled stockings, with the presents we  particularly want peeping over the top, or hanging out at the side,  too big to go into the largest sock. Besides, there is something so  mysterious and exciting about Santa Claus, for no one seems to have  ever seen him. But we picture him to ourselves as an old man with a  white beard, whose favourite way of coming into our rooms is down the  chimney, bringing gifts for the good children and punishments for the  bad.    Yet this Santa Claus, in whose name the presents come to us at  Christmas time, is a very real saint, and we can learn a great deal  about him, only we must remember that his true name is Saint  Nicholas. Perhaps the little children, who used to talk of him long  ago, found Saint Nicholas too difficult to say, and so called him  their dear Santa Claus. But we learn, as we grow older, that Nicholas  is his true name, and that he is a real person who lived long years  ago, far away in the East.    The father and mother of Nicholas were noble and very rich, but what  they wanted most of all was to have a son. They were Christians, so  they prayed to God for many years that He would give them their  hearts' desire; and when at last Nicholas was born, they were the  happiest people in the world.    They thought there was no one like their boy; and indeed, he was wiser  and better than most children, and never gave them a moment's trouble.  But alas, while he was still a child, a terrible plague swept over the  country, and his father and mother died, leaving him quite alone.    All the great riches which his father had possessed were left to  Nicholas, and among other things he inherited three bars of gold.  These golden bars were his greatest treasure, and he thought more of  them than all the other riches he possessed.    Now in the town where Nicholas lived there dwelt a nobleman with three  daughters. They had once been very rich, but great misfortunes had  overtaken the father, and now they were all so poor they had scarcely  enough to live upon.    At last a day came when there was not even bread enough to eat, and  the daughters said to their father:    \"Let us go into the streets and beg, or do anything to get a little  money, that we may not starve.\"    But the father answered:    \"Not to-night. I cannot bear to think of it. Wait at least until  to-morrow. Something may happen to save my daughters from such  disgrace.\"    Now, just as they were talking together, Nicholas happened to be  passing, and as the window was open he heard all that the poor father  said. It seemed terrible to think that a noble family should be so  poor and actually in want of bread, and Nicholas tried to plan how it  would be possible to help them. He knew they would be much too proud  to take money from him, so he had to think of some other way. Then he  remembered his golden bars, and that very night he took one of them  and went secretly to the nobleman's house, hoping to give the treasure  without letting the father or daughters know who brought it.    To his joy Nicholas discovered that a little window had been left  open, and by standing on tiptoe he could reach it. So he lifted the  golden bar and slipped it through the window, never waiting to hear  what became of it, in case any one should see him. (And now do you see  the reason why the visits of Santa Claus are so mysterious?)    Inside the house the poor father sat sorrowfully watching, while his  children slept. He wondered if there was any hope for them anywhere,  and he prayed earnestly that heaven would send help. Suddenly  something fell at his feet, and to his amazement and joy, he found it  was a bar of pure gold.    \"My child,\" he cried, as he showed his eldest daughter the shining  gold, \"God has heard my prayer and has sent this from heaven. Now we  shall have enough and to spare. Call your sisters that we may rejoice  together, and I will go instantly and change this treasure.\"    The precious golden bar was soon sold to a money-changer, who gave so  much for it that the family were able to live in comfort and have all  that they needed. And not only was there enough to live upon, but so  much was over that the father gave his eldest daughter a large dowry,  and very soon she was happily married.    When Nicholas saw how much happiness his golden bar had brought to the  poor nobleman he determined that the second daughter should have a  dowry too. So he went as before and found the little window again  open, and was able to throw in the second golden bar as he had done  the first. This time the father was dreaming happily, and did not find  the treasure until he awoke in the morning. Soon afterwards the second  daughter had her dowry and was married too.    The father now began to think that, after all, it was not usual for  golden bars to fall from heaven, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3458"],[0,"Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures (#17)"],[1,"          this vision, name the face that smiles on them and the  76:3    hand which beckons them, as one at Niagara, with eyes          open only to that wonder, forgets all else and breathes          aloud his rapture.                                Real Life is God    76:6    When being is understood, Life will be recognized as          neither material nor finite, but as infinite, - as God,          universal good; and the belief that life, or  76:9    mind, was ever in a finite form, or good in          evil, will be destroyed. Then it will be understood that          Spirit never entered matter and was therefore never  76:12   raised from matter. When advanced to spiritual being          and the understanding of God, man can no longer com-          mune with matter; neither can he return to it, any more  76:15   than a tree can return to its seed. Neither will man seem          to be corporeal, but he will be an individual conscious-          ness, characterized by the divine Spirit as idea, not matter.    76:18   Suffering, sinning, dying beliefs are unreal. When          divine Science is universally understood, they will have          no power over man, for man is immortal and lives by  76:21   divine authority.                               Immaterial pleasure            The sinless joy, - the perfect harmony and immortality          of Life, possessing unlimited divine beauty and goodness  76:24   without a single bodily pleasure or pain, -          constitutes the only veritable, indestructible          man, whose being is spiritual. This state of existence  76:27   is scientific and intact, - a perfection discernible only          by those who have the final understanding of Christ in          divine Science. Death can never hasten this state of  76:30   existence, for death must be overcome, not submitted to,          before immortality appears.            The recognition of Spirit and of infinity comes not  77:1    suddenly here or hereafter. The pious Polycarp said:          \"I cannot turn at once from good to evil.\" Neither do  77:3    other mortals accomplish the change from error to truth          at a single bound.                                  Second death            Existence continues to be a belief of corporeal sense  77:6    until the Science of being is reached. Error brings its          own self-destruction both here and hereafter,          for mortal mind creates its own physical con-  77:9    ditions. Death will occur on the next plane of existence          as on this, until the spiritual understanding of Life is          reached. Then, and not until then, will it be demon-  77:12   strated that \"the second death hath no power.\"                                A dream vanishing            The period required for this dream of material life,          embracing its so-called pleasures and pains, to vanish  77:15   from consciousness, \"knoweth no man . . .          neither the Son, but the Father.\" This period          will be of longer or shorter duration according to the  77:18   tenacity of error. Of what advantage, then, would it be          to us, or to the departed, to prolong the material state and          so prolong the illusion either of a soul inert or of a sinning,  77:21   suffering sense, - a so-called mind fettered to matter.                             Progress and purgatory            Even if communications from spirits to mortal con-          sciousness were possible, such communications would  77:24   grow beautifully less with every advanced stage          of existence. The departed would gradually          rise above ignorance and materiality, and Spiritualists  77:27   would outgrow their beliefs in material spiritualism.          Spiritism consigns the so-called dead to a state resembling          that of blighted buds, - to a wretched purgatory, where  77:30   the chances of the departed for improvement narrow          into nothing and they return to their old standpoints of          matter.                              Unnatural deflections    78:1    The decaying flower, the blighted bud, the gnarled oak,          the ferocious beast, - like the discords of disease, sin,  78:3    and death, - are unnatural. They are the fal-          sities of sense, the changing deflections of mor-          tal mind; they are not the eternal realities of Mind.                                 Absurd oracles    78:6    How unreasonable is the belief that we are wearing          out life and hastening to death, and that at the same          time we are communing with immortality!  78:9    If the departed are in rapport with mor-          tality, or matter, they are not spiritual, but must still          be mortal, sinning, suffering, and dying. Then why  78:12   look to them - even were communication possible - for          proofs of immortality, and accept them as oracles? Com-          munications gathered from ignorance are pernicious in  78:15   tendency.            Spiritualism with its material accompaniments would          destroy the supremacy of Spirit. If Spirit pervades all  78:18   space, it needs no material method for the transmission          of messages. Spirit needs no wires nor electricity in order          to be omnipresent.                                Spirit intangible    78:21   Spirit is not materially tangible. How then can it          communicate with man through electric, material effects?          How can the majesty and omnipotence of  78:24   Spirit be lost? God is not in the medley          where matter cares for matter, where spiritism makes          many gods, and hypnotism and electricity are claimed  78:27   to be the agents of God's government.            Spirit blesses man, but man cannot \"tell whence          it cometh.\" By it the sick are healed, the sorrowing are  78:30   comforted, and the sinning are reformed. These are the          effects of one universal God, the invisible good dwelling          in eternal Science.                             Thought regarding death    79:1    The act of describing disease - its symptoms, locality,          and fatality - is not scientific. Warning people against  79:3    death is an error that tends to frighten into          death those who are ignorant of Life as God.          Thousands of instances could be cited of health restored  79:6    by changing the patient's thoughts regarding death.                              Fallacious hypotheses            A scientific mental method is more sanitary than the          use of drugs, and such a mental method produces perma-  79:9    nent health. Science must go over the whole          ground, and dig up every seed of error's sow-          ing. Spiritualism relies upon human beliefs and hy-  79:12   potheses. Christian Science removes these beliefs and          hypotheses through the higher understanding of God, for          Christian Science, resting on divine Principle, not on ma-  79:15   terial personalities, in its revelation of immortality, intro-          duces the harmony of being.            Jesus cast out evil spirits, or false beliefs. The Apostle  79:18   Paul bade men have the Mind that was in the Christ.          Jesus did his own work by the one Spirit. He said: \"My          Father worketh hitherto, and I work.\" He never de-  79:21   scribed disease, so far as can be learned from the Gospels,          but he healed disease.                                Mistaken methods            The unscientific practitioner says: \"You are ill. Your  79:24   brain is overtaxed, and you must rest. Your body is          weak, and it must be strengthened. You have          nervous prostration, and must be treated for it.\"  79:27   Science objects to all this, contending for the rights of in-          telligence and asserting that Mind controls body and brain.                                 Divine strength            Mind-science teaches that mortals need \"not be weary  79:30   in well doing.\" It dissipates fatigue in doing          good. Giving does not impoverish us in the          service of our Maker, neither does withholding enrich us.  80:1    We have strength in proportion to our apprehension of          the truth, and our strength is not lessened by giving  80:3    utterance to truth. A cup of coffee or tea is not the equal          of truth, whether for the inspiration of a sermon or for          the support of bodily endurance.                             A denial of immortality    80:6    A communication purporting to come from the late          Theodore Parker reads as follows: \"There never was,          and there never will be, an immortal spirit.\"  80:9    Yet the very periodical containing this sen-          tence repeats weekly the assertion that spirit-communica-          tions are our only proofs of immortality.                             Mysticism unscientific    80:12   I entertain no doubt of the humanity and philanthropy          of many Spiritualists, but I cannot coincide with their          views. It is mysticism which gives spiritual-  80:15   ism its force. Science dispels mystery and          explains extraordinary phenomena; but Science never          removes phenomena from the domain of reason into the  80:18   realm of mysticism.                               Physical falsities            It should not seem mysterious that mind, without the          aid of hands, can move a table, when we already know  80:21   that it is mind-power which moves both table          and hand. Even planchette - the French toy          which years ago pleased so many people - attested the con-  80:24   trol of mortal mind over its substratum, called matter.            It is mortal mind which convulses its substratum, matter.          These movements arise from the volition of human belief,  80:27   but they are neither scientific nor rational. Mortal mind          produces table-tipping as certainly as table-setting, and          believes"]]]
