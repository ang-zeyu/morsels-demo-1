[Sidenote: No reform in the Transvaal.]    The more hopeful situation in the Transvaal that followed upon the  determined action of the Imperial Government in May was succeeded by a  period punctuated by events which, taken collectively, obliterated all  prospect of \"reform from within.\" The treatment accorded to the report  of the Industrial Commission, which, as we have noticed, established  the truth of practically all the fiscal and administrative complaints  of the Uitlanders, was a matter of especial significance. The  Commission was created by President Krueger; it was in effect the  fulfilment of his promises, made after the Raid, to redress the  grievances of the Uitlanders. The Commissioners were his own  officials, Boers and Hollanders; men who had no prejudice against the  Government, and no sympathy with the new population, yet their  recommendations, if carried into effect, would have removed the most  serious of the industrial grievances of the British community. The  Report had raised great expectations. It was thought that, not all,  but a substantial proportion of its recommendations would be put into  effect. Here, then, was an opportunity for reform which involved no  loss of prestige, entailed no danger to the independence of the  Republic, and held not the slightest threat to the stability of  burgher predominance. If what President Krueger was waiting for was a  convenient opportunity, he had such an opportunity now. This  reasonable forecast was utterly falsified by the event. Mr. Schalk  Burger, the Chairman of the Commission, was denounced by Mr. Krueger in  the Volksraad as a traitor to the Republic, because he had dared to  set his hand to so distasteful a document. The report itself was  thrown contemptuously by the grim old President from the Volksraad to  the customary committee of true-blue \"doppers,\" whose ignorance of the  industrial conditions of the Rand was equalled only by their personal  devotion to himself. Here the adverse findings of the commissioners on  the dynamite and railway monopolies were reversed; and the  recommendation for a Local Board for the Rand was condemned as  subversive of the authority of the State. At length, after the report  had been tossed about from Volksraad to committee, and from committee  to Volksraad, until very little of the original recommendations  remained, the Government took action. In addition to an immaterial  reduction of the exorbitant rates charged by the Netherlands Railway  Company--a concession subsequently alleged to have been the price paid  by the Hollander Corporation to avoid further inquiry into its  affairs--it was announced that, with the object of lessening the cost  of living on the Rand, the import duties upon certain necessaries in  common use would be reduced, in accordance with the recommendations of  the Commissioners on this point; but that, since it was obviously  inexpedient to diminish the revenue of the Republic, the duties upon  certain other articles of the same class would be raised to an extent  more than counterbalancing the loss upon the reduction. _Parturiunt  montes; nascitur ridiculus mus._    [Sidenote: Krueger re-elected president.]    This singular display of mingled effrontery and duplicity marked the  closing months of the year (1897). In the February following Mr.  Krueger was elected to the presidency of the South African Republic for  the fourth time. It was generally recognised that the success of his  candidature was inevitable, but few, within or without the Transvaal,  had expected him to secure so decisive a victory over his competitors.  The figures--Krueger 12,858, Schalk Burger 3,750, and Joubert  (Commandant-General) 2,001--were additional evidence of the impotency  or lukewarmness of the reform party among the burghers. The first act  of President Krueger, on his return to power, was to dismiss Chief  Justice Kotze. Mr. Kotze's struggle for the independence of the law  courts, thus summarily closed, had commenced a year before with what  was known as the \"High Court crisis.\" At that time President Krueger  had obtained power from the Volksraad by the notorious law No. 1 of  1897 to compel the judges, on pain of dismissal, to renounce the  right, recently exercised, to declare laws, which were in their  opinion inconsistent with the Grondwet (Constitution), to be, to that  extent, invalid. As a protest against this autocratic proceeding the  entire bench of judges threatened to resign, and the courts were  adjourned. The deadlock continued until a compromise was arranged  through the intervention of Chief Justice de Villiers. The President  undertook to introduce a new law providing satisfactorily for the  independence of the Courts, and the judges, on their side, pledged  themselves not to exercise the \"testing\" right in the meantime. In  February, 1898, Chief Justice Kotze wrote to remind President Krueger  that his promise remained unfulfilled,[35] withdrawing at the same  time the conditional pledge not to exercise the \"testing\" right given  by himself. The President then dismissed Mr. Kotze under Law No. 1,  compelled a second judge, Mr. Justice Amershof (who had supported the  Chief Justice in the position he had taken up) to resign, and  appointed, as the new Chief Justice, Mr. Gregorowski, who, as Chief  Justice of the Free State, had presided at the trial of the Reformers  in 1896, and at the time of the crisis a year before had declared that  \"no honourable man could possibly accept the position of a judge so  long as Law No. 1 remained in force.\" The judicature was now rendered  subservient to the Executive, and the Uitlanders were thus deprived of  their last constitutional safeguard against the injustice of the Boer  and Hollander oligarchy.             [Footnote 35: There appears to have been some question as to           whether the terms of the President's undertaking bound him to           introduce the proposed measure into the Volksraad in 1897, or           in 1898. Chief Justice de Villiers held that the latter date           was contemplated by the President. But the point is           immaterial, since President Krueger denied in the Volksraad,           after the dismissal of Mr. Kotze, that he had ever given an           undertaking at all to Chief Justice de Villiers or to anybody           else.]    [Sidenote: His reactionary policy.]    This was the position in the Transvaal in February, 1898. President  Krueger had demonstrated by his refusal to carry out the  recommendations of the Industrial Commission, and by the dismissal of  Chief Justice Kotze, that he was determined not merely to set himself  against all measures of reform, but to increase the disabilities under  which the Uitlanders had hitherto lived. He had been placed, for the  fourth time, at the head of the Republic by an overwhelming majority;  he had refused to sacrifice a penny of revenue, and he was in  possession of ample resources, which were being sedulously applied in  increasing his already disproportionate supply of munitions of war.  Through Dr. Leyds, who had returned from his mission to Europe, he  had opened up communications with European Powers, that placed him in  a position to avail himself to the full of the possible embarrassment  of Great Britain through international rivalries or disagreements. In  South Africa he had carried through a treaty of offensive and  defensive alliance with the Free State, and he had received more than  one recent assurance that the flame of Afrikander nationalism had been  kindled anew by the Bond in the Cape Colony.    These events were disquieting enough in themselves; but what made the  disappearance of any prospect of spontaneous reform in the Transvaal  still more serious to the High Commissioner for South Africa, was the  complaisance with which President Krueger's reactionary policy was  regarded by the Dutch subjects of the Crown. It was just here that  Lord Milner's observations must have yielded the most startling  results. We know that the days which had passed since the Jubilee  despatch was written had brought him constant and varied opportunities  for seeing \"things as they really were\" in South Africa; we know that  he was keenly alert in the accomplishment of his mission, and we may  presume, therefore, that few, if any, of these opportunities were  lost.    In September Lord Milner had travelled right round the Colony. At  every little town and _dorp_--wherever, in fact, he went--he conversed  with the Dutch, whom his pleasant manner quickly won to friendliness;  and all the speeches that he made in reply to the addresses of  welcome were extremely conciliatory in tone. This was the time when  there were hopeful anticipations of the good results that were to come  from the Industrial Commission; and Lord Milner often began his speech  with an expression of the sense of relief which he felt--a feeling  which his audience must share--that now there was to be peace in South  Africa. These conciliatory utterances of the new High Commissioner  were almost completely ignored by the Dutch Press. An exception to  this rule of silence was significant. The High Commissioner was  accompanied by the Minister of Agriculture, Mr. (now Sir Pieter)  Faure. On one occasion Mr. Faure made some remarks in the same spirit  as that in which Lord Milner had spoken. \"People,\" he said, \"talk of  Africa for the Afrikanders; but what I say is, Africa for all.\" The  expression of this moderate sentiment drew down upon Mr. Faure a sharp  reproof from _Ons Land_. From this and many other such incidents it  must have begun to dawn upon Lord Milner's mind that what the Dutch of  the Cape Colony wanted was not conciliation but domination.

All we can do is to bring forward the  different evidence we have been able to collect, and then to let our  readers judge for themselves.    In an old print of Patrick Sarsfield, Earl of Lucan, there are two  wolf-dogs, which are represented as smooth, prick-eared, and with  somewhat bushy tails. Lord Lucan distinguished himself in several  engagements, and commanded the second troop of Irish Horse Guards, to  which he was appointed by James II., and received his death wound,  behaving most gallantly at the head of his countrymen, in 1693, when  the allies, under William III., were defeated by Marshal Luxembourg at  the battle of Landen. He was probably attended by his faithful  wolf-dogs on that occasion, when he uttered those sublime words which  no Irishman will ever forget--\"Oh that this was for Ireland!\" thus  showing his love and affection for his native country as he was  expiring in the arms of victory.    An old and amiable acquaintance, Mr. Aylmer Bourke Lambert, now, alas!  no more, communicated an account of the wolf-hound to the Linnean  Society, which may be found in the third volume of their  \"Transactions.\" He had in his possession an old picture of one of  these dogs, which, at the sale of his effects, was purchased by the  Earl of Derby; the dog is represented as smooth-haired, with a  somewhat wide forehead, and having no appearance of the greyhound, but  more of that of the mastiff.    In February, 1841, Mr. Webber presented to the Royal Irish Academy an  ancient stone, on which was carved a rude bas-relief, supposed to be  the representation of a dog killing a wolf. Mr. Webber accompanied the  present with a communication, to the effect that the stone was taken  from the castle of Ardnaglass, in the barony of Tireragh, and county  of Sligo, and was said to commemorate the destruction of the last wolf  in Ireland. The current tradition in the place from whence it came  was, that some years after it was supposed that the race of wolves was  extinct, the flocks in the county of Leitrim were attacked by a wild  animal, which turned out to be a wolf; that thereupon the chieftains  of Leitrim applied to O'Dowd, the chieftain of Tireragh (who possessed  a celebrated dog of the breed of the ancient Irish wolf-dog), to come  and hunt the wolf. This application having been complied with by  O'Dowd, there ensued a chase, which forms the subject of an ancient  Irish legend, detailing the various districts through which it was  pursued, until at length the wolf was overtaken and killed in a small  wood of pine-trees, at the foot of one of the mountains of Tireragh.  The quarter of land on which the wolf was killed is to this day called  _Carrow na Madhoo_, which means \"the dog's quarter.\" In commemoration  of the event, O'Dowd had a representation of it carved on stone, and  placed in the wall of his baronial residence. It is difficult to form  an opinion of the shape of a dog from so rude a representation, except  that it appears to have had a wide forehead and pricked ears.    A gentleman, who in his youth saw one of these dogs, informs me that  it was smooth, strong, and partaking somewhat of the character and  appearance of a powerful Danish dog. This agrees with the account  given of it by some writers, especially in \"The Sportsman's Cabinet,\"  a work more remarkable for the truth and fineness of its engravings,  than for the matter contained in it. Buffon also forms much the same  opinion. That great strength must be necessary to enable a dog to  compete with a wolf, cannot be doubted, and perhaps there is no breed  of the rough greyhound now known capable of competing with a wolf  single-handed. Her Majesty has now in her possession one of the finest  specimens of the Highland deer-hound. He has great strength and  height, is rough-coated, wide across the loins, and altogether a noble  animal. Powerful, however as he is, it may be questioned whether such  a dog would be a match for a wolf, which the Irish hounds undoubtedly  were. This circumstance alone would lead us to suppose, that we must  look to a different breed than that of greyhounds as the antagonists  of the wolf.    But it is time to turn to the other side of the question.    In a very agreeable, well-written article in the \"Irish Penny Journal\"  of May, 1841, the author brings forward strong evidence to prove that  the celebrated Irish wolf-dog resembled a greyhound in form. He will,  I hope, allow me to quote some of his arguments, which show  considerable research and historical information. He says:--    \"Public opinion has long been divided respecting the precise  appearance and form of this majestic animal, and so many different  ideas have been conceived of him, that many persons have been induced  to come to the conclusion that no particular breed of dogs was ever  kept for wolf-hunting in Ireland, but that the appellation of  'wolf-dog' was bestowed upon any dog swift enough to overtake and  powerful enough to contend with and overcome that formidable animal.  While some hold this opinion, others suppose that though a particular  breed was used, it was a sort of heavy mastiff-like dog, now extinct.  It is the object of the present paper to show, that not only did  Ireland possess a peculiar race of dogs, exclusively devoted to  wolf-hunting, but that those dogs, instead of being of the mastiff  kind, resembled the greyhound in form; and instead of being extinct  are still to be met with, although they are very scarce. I myself was  once in a very gross error respecting this dog, for I conceived him  to have been a mastiff, and implicitly believed that the dogs of Lord  Altamont, described in the third volume of the Linnean 'Transactions'  by Mr. Lambert, were the sole surviving representatives of the Irish  wolf-dog. An able paper, read by Mr. Haffield about a year ago, before  the Dublin Natural History Society, served to stagger me in my belief,  and subsequent careful inquiry and research have completed my  conversion. I proceed to lay before my readers the result of that  inquiry, and I feel confident that no individual, after reading the  evidence which I shall adduce, will continue to harbour a doubt  respecting the true appearance and form of the ancient Irish wolf-dog.    \"We are informed by several disjointed scraps of Celtic verse, that in  the times of old, when Fionn Mac Cumhaill, popularly styled Finn Mac  Cool, wielded the sceptre of power and justice, we possessed a  prodigious and courageous dog, used for hunting the deer and wild  boar, and also the wolf, which ravaged the folds and slaughtered the  herds of our ancestors. We learn from the same source that these dogs  were also frequently employed as auxiliaries in war, and that they  were 'mighty in combat, their breasts like plates of brass, and  greatly to be feared.' We might adduce the songs of Ossian, where the  epithets 'hairy-footed,' 'white-breasted,' and 'bounding,' are  singularly characteristic of some of the striking peculiarities of the  dog in question, and strangely coincide with the descriptions  furnished by other writers respecting him. Mac Pherson must, at all  events, have been at the pains of considerable research if he actually  forged the beautiful poems, which he put forth to the world under  Ossian's name. The word 'Bran,' the name given to Fingal's noble  hound, employed by others than Ossian, is Celtic, and signifies  'Mountain Torrent,' implying that impetuosity of course and headlong  courage which the dog possessed. I have said that many assert the  Irish wolf-dog to be no longer in existence. I have ventured a denial  of this, and refer to the wolf-dog or deer-dog of the Highlands of  Scotland, as his actual and faithful living representative. Perhaps I  am wrong in saying representative. I hold that the Irish wolf-dog and  the Highland deer-dog are one and the same, and I now proceed to cite  a few authorities in support of my position.    \"The Venerable Bede, as well as the Scotch historian John Major,  informs us that Scotland was originally peopled from Ireland under the  conduct of Renda, and that one half of Scotland spoke the Irish  language as their mother-tongue. Many persons, also, are doubtless  aware that, even at this present time, the Gaelic and Erse are so much  alike, that a Connaught man finds no difficulty in comprehending and  conversing with a Highlander. Scotland also was called by the early  writers Scotia Minor, and Ireland, Scotia Major. The colonization,  therefore, of Scotland from Ireland admits of little doubt. As the  Irish wolf-dog was at that time in the enjoyment of his most extended  fame, it was not to be expected that the colonists would omit taking  with them such a fine description of dog, and which would prove so  useful to them in a newly established settlement, and that, too, at a  period when hunting was not merely an amusement, but one of their main  occupations, and also their main source of subsistence. The Irish  wolf-dog was thus carried into Scotland, and became the Highland or  Scottish wolf-dog, changing in process of time his name with his  country; and when wolves disappeared from the land, his occupation was  that of deer-hunting, and thus his present name.    \"In Ireland the wolves were in existence longer than in Scotland, but  as soon as wolves ceased to exist in the former country, the dogs were  suffered to become extinct also, while in Scotland there was still  abundant employment for them after the days of wolf-hunting were  over--the deer still remained; and useful as they had been as  wolf-dogs, they proved themselves, if possible, still more so as  deer-hounds.    \"That the Irish wolf-dog was a tall, rough greyhound, similar in every  respect to the Highland dog of the present day (of which an engraving  is given) cannot be doubted from the following authorities. Strabo  mentions a tall greyhound in use among the Pictish and Celtic nations,  which he"]]]
