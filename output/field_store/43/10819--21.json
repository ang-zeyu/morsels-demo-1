The book revealed, in a way fitted to  carry conviction to every unprejudiced reader, the impossibility of  uniting slavery with freedom under the same Government. Either all must  be free or the mass subject to the few--or there is actual war. This  principle is finely brought out in the predicament of the Quaker  confronted by a fugitive with wife and child who had seen a sister sold  and conveyed to a life of shame on a Southern plantation. \"Am I going to  stand by and see them take my wife and sell her?\" exclaimed the negro.  \"No, God help me! I'll fight to the last breath before they shall take  my wife and son. Can you blame me?\" To which the Quaker replied: \"Mortal  man cannot blame thee, George. Flesh and blood could not do otherwise.  'Woe unto the world because of offences but woe unto them through whom  the offence cometh.'\" \"Would not even you, sir, do the same, in my  place?\" \"I pray that I be not tried.\" And in the ensuing events the  Quaker played an important part.    Laws enacted for the protection of slave property are shown to be  destructive of the fundamental rights of freemen; they are inhuman. The  Ohio Senator, who in his lofty preserve at the capital of his country  could discourse eloquently of his readiness to keep faith with the  South in the matter of the faithful execution of the Fugitive Slave Law,  becomes, when at home with his family, a flagrant violator of the law.  Elemental human nature is pitted against the apparent interests of a few  individual slaveowners. The story of Uncle Tom placed all supporters  of the new law on the defensive. It was read by all classes North and  South. \"Uncle Tom's Cabin as it is\" was called forth from the South as a  reply to Mrs. Stowe's book, and there ensued a general discussion of the  subject which was on the whole enlightening. Yet the immediate political  effect of the publication was less than might have been expected from  a book so widely read and discussed. Its appearance early in the decade  did not prevent the apparent pro-slavery reaction already described. But  Mr. Rhodes calls attention to the different impression which the book  made upon adults and boys. Hardened sinners in partizan politics could  read the book, laugh and weep over the passing incidents, and then go  on as if nothing had happened. Not so with the thirteen-year-old boy.  He never could be the same again. The Republican party of 1860 was  especially successful in gaining the first vote of the youthful citizen  and undoubtedly owed much of its influence to \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\"    Two lines of attack were rapidly rendering impossible the continuance  of slavery in the United States. Mrs. Stowe gave effective expression to  the moral, religious, and humanitarian sentiment against slavery. In the  year in which her work was published, Frederick Law Olmsted began his  extended journeys throughout the South. He represents the impartial  scientific observer. His books were published during the years 1856,  1857, and 1861. They constitute in their own way an indictment against  slavery quite as forcible as that of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" but an  indictment that rests chiefly upon the blighting influence of the  institution of slavery upon agriculture, manufactures, and the general  industrial and social order. The crisis came too soon for these  publications to have any marked effect upon the issue. Their appeal  was to the deliberate and thoughtful reader, and political control had  already drifted into the hands of those who were not deliberate and  composed.    In 1857, however, there appeared a book which did exert a marked  influence upon immediate political issues. There is no evidence that  Hinton Rowan Helper, the author of \"The Impending Crisis,\" had any  knowledge of the writings of Olmsted; but he was familiar with  Northern anti-slavery literature. \"I have considered my subject more  particularly,\" he states in his preface, \"with reference to its economic  aspects as regards the whites--not with reference, except in a very  slight degree, to its humanitarian or religious aspects. To the latter  side of the question, Northern writers have already done full and timely  justice.... Yankee wives have written the most popular anti-slavery  literature of the day. Against this I have nothing to say; it is all  well enough for women to give the fictions of slavery; men should give  the facts.\" He denies that it had been his purpose to cast unmerited  opprobium upon slaveholders; yet a sense of personal injury breathes  throughout the pages. If he had no intention of casting unmerited  opprobrium upon slaveholders, it is difficult to imagine what language  he could have used if he had undertaken to pass the limit of deserved  reprobation. In this regard the book is quite in line with the style of  Southern utterance against abolitionists.    Helper belonged to a slaveholding family, for a hundred years resident  in the Carolinas. The dedication is significant. It is to three personal  friends from three slave States who at the time were residing in  California, in Oregon, and in Washington Territory, \"and to the  non-slaveholding whites of the South generally, whether at home or  abroad.\" Out of the South had come the inspiration for the religious and  humanitarian attack upon slavery. From the same source came the call for  relief of the poverty-stricken white victims of the institution.    Helper's book revived the controversy which had been forcibly terminated  a quarter of a century before. He resumes the argument of the members of  the Virginia legislature of 1832. He reprints extended selections from  that memorable debate and then, by extended references to later official  reports, points out how slavery is impoverishing the South. The South  is shown to have continuously declined, while the North has made immense  gains. In a few years the relation of the South to the North would  resemble that of Poland to Russia or of Ireland to England. The author  sees no call for any arguments against slavery as an economic system; he  would simply bring the earlier characterization of the situation down to  date.    Helper differs radically from all earlier speakers and writers in that  he outlines a program for definite action. He estimates that for the  entire South there are seven white non-slaveholders for every three  slaveholders. He would organize these non-slaveholding whites into  an independent political party and would hold a general convention of  non-slaveholders from every slave State to adopt measures to restrain  \"the diabolical excesses of the oligarchy\" and to annihilate slavery.  Slaveholders should be entirely excluded from any share in government.  They should be treated as criminals ostracized from respectable society.  He is careful to state, however, that by slaveholder he does not mean  such men as Benton of Missouri and many others throughout the slave  States who retain the sentiments on the slavery question of the  \"immortal Fathers of the Republic.\" He has in mind only the new order of  owners, who have determined by criminal methods to inflict the crime of  slavery upon an overwhelming majority of their white fellow-citizens.    The publication of \"The Impending Crisis\" created a profound sensation  among Southern leaders. So long as the attack upon the peculiar  institution emanated from the North, the defenders had the full benefit  of local prejudice and resentment against outside intrusion. Helper was  himself a thorough-going believer in state rights. Slavery was to be  abolished, as he thought, by the action of the separate States. Here  he was in accord with Northern abolitionists. If such literature as  Helper's volume should find its way into the South, it would be no  longer possible to palm off upon the unthinking public the patent  falsehood that abolitionists of the North were attempting to impose by  force a change in Southern institutions. All that Southern abolitionists  ever asked was the privilege of remaining at home in their own South in  the full exercise of their constitutional rights.    Southern leaders were undoubtedly aware of the concurrent publications  of travelers and newspaper reporters, of which Olmsted's books were  conspicuous examples. Olmsted and Helper were both sources of proof that  slavery was bringing the South to financial ruin. The facts were getting  hold of the minds of the Southern people. The debate which had been  adjourned was on the eve of being resumed. Complete suppression of  the new scientific industrial argument against slavery seemed to  slave-owners to furnish their only defense.    The Appalachian ranges of mountains drove a wedge of liberty and freedom  from Pennsylvania almost to the Gulf. In the upland regions slavery  could not flourish. There was always enmity between the planters of the  coast and the dwellers on the upland. The slaveholding oligarchy had  always ruled, but the day of the uplanders was at hand. This is the  explanation of the veritable panic which Helper's publication created.  A debate which should follow the line of this old division between the  peoples of the Atlantic slave States would, under existing conditions,  be fatal to the institution of slavery. West Virginia did become a free  State at the first opportunity. Counties in western North Carolina claim  to have furnished a larger proportion of their men to the Union army  than any other counties in the country. Had the plan for peaceable  emancipation projected by abolitionists been permitted to take its  course, the uplands of South Carolina would have been pitted against  the lowlands, and Senator Tillman would have appeared as a rampant  abolitionist. There might have been violence, but it would have been  confined to limited areas in the separate States. Had the crisis been  postponed, there surely would have been a revival of abolitionism within  the Southern States."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30396"],[0,"Books and Authors (#17)"],[1,"pared to the quick. We see the eyes and nose moving with  convulsive twitches; we see the heavy form rolling; we hear it puffing;  and then comes the \"Why, sir!\" and the \"What then, sir?\" and the \"No,  sir!\" and the \"You don't see your way through the question, sir!\"           *       *       *       *       *      DR. CHALMERS'S INDUSTRY.    In October, 1841, Dr. Chalmers commenced two series of biblical  compositions, which he continued with unbroken regularity till the day  of his decease, May 31, 1847. Go where he might, however he might be  engaged, each week-day had its few verses read, thought over, written  upon--forming what he denominated \"Horae Biblicae Quotidianae:\" each  Sabbath-day had its two chapters, one in the Old and the other in the  New Testament, with the two trains of meditative devotion recorded to  which the reading of them respectively gave birth--forming what he  denominated \"Horae Biblicae Sabbaticae.\" When absent from home, or when the  manuscript books in which they were ordinarily inserted were not beside  him, he wrote in short-hand, carefully entering what was thus written  in the larger volumes afterwards. Not a trace of haste nor of the  extreme pressure from without, to which he was so often subjected, is  exhibited in the handwriting of these volumes. There are but few words  omitted--scarcely any erased. This singular correctness was a general  characteristic of his compositions. His lectures on the Epistle to the  Romans were written _currente calamo_, in Glasgow, during the most  hurried and overburthened period of his life. And when, many years  afterwards, they were given out to be copied for the press, scarcely a  blot, or an erasure, or a correction, was to be found in them, and they  were printed off exactly as they had originally been written.    In preparing the \"Horae Biblicae Quotidianae,\" Chalmers had by his side,  for use and reference, the \"Concordance,\" the \"Pictorial Bible,\"  \"Poole's Synopsis,\" \"Henry's Commentary,\" and \"Robinson's Researches in  Palestine.\" These constituted what he called his \"Biblical Library.\"  \"There,\" said he to a friend, pointing, as he spoke, to the above-named  volumes, as they lay together on his library-table, with a volume of the  \"Quotidianae,\" in which he had just been writing, lying open beside  them,--\"There are the books I use--all that is Biblical is there. I have  to do with nothing besides in my Biblical study.\" To the consultation of  these few volumes he throughout restricted himself.    The whole of the MSS. were purchased, after Dr. Chalmers's death, for a  large sum of money, by Mr. Thomas Constable, of Edinburgh, her Majesty's  printer; and were in due time given to, and most favourably received by,  the public.           *       *       *       *       *      LATEST OF DR. JOHNSON'S CONTEMPORARIES.[6]    In the autumn of 1831, died the Rev. Dr. Shaw, at Chesley,  Somersetshire, at the age of eighty-three: he is said to have been the  last surviving friend of Dr. Johnson.    On the 16th of January, in the above year, died Mr. Richard Clark,  chamberlain of the City of London, in the ninety-second year of his age.  At the age of fifteen, he was introduced by Sir John Hawkins to Johnson,  whose friendship he enjoyed to the last year of the Doctor's life. He  attended Johnson's evening parties at the Mitre Tavern, in Fleet-street;[7]  where, among other literary characters he met Dr. Percy, Dr. Goldsmith,  and Dr. Hawksworth. A substantial supper was served at eight o'clock;  the party seldom separated till a late hour; and Mr. Clark recollected  that early one morning he, with another of the party, accompanied the  Doctor to his house, where Mrs. Williams, then blind, made tea for them.  When Mr. Clark was sheriff, he took Johnson to a \"Judges' Dinner,\" at  the Old Bailey; the judges being Blackstone and Eyre. Mr. Clark often  visited the Doctor, and met him at dinner-parties; and the last time he  enjoyed his company was at the Essex Head Club, of which, by the  Doctor's invitation, Clark became a member.     [6] See, also, an ensuing page, 120.     [7] Johnson, by the way, had a strange nervous feeling, which made him   uneasy if he had not touched every post between the Mitre Tavern and   his own lodgings.           *       *       *       *       *      A SNAIL DINNER.    The chemical philosophers, Dr. Black and Dr. Hutton, were particular  friends, though there was something extremely opposite in their external  appearance and manner. Dr. Black spoke with the English pronunciation,  and with punctilious accuracy of expression, both in point of matter and  manner. The geologist, Dr. Hutton, was the very reverse of this: his  conversation was conducted in broad phrases, expressed with a broad  Scotch accent, which often heightened the humour of what he said.    It chanced that the two Doctors had held some discourse together upon  the folly of abstaining from feeding on the testaceous creatures of the  land, while those of the sea were considered as delicacies. Wherefore  not eat snails? they are known to be nutritious and wholesome, and even  sanative in some cases. The epicures of old praised them among the  richest delicacies, and the Italians still esteem them. In short, it was  determined that a gastronomic experiment should be made at the expense  of the snails. The snails were procured, dieted for a time, and then  stewed for the benefit of the two philosophers, who had either invited  no guests to their banquet, or found none who relished in prospect the  _piece de resistance_. A huge dish of snails was placed before them:  still, philosophers are but men, after all; and the stomachs of both  doctors began to revolt against the experiment. Nevertheless, if they  looked with disgust on the snails, they retained their awe for each  other, so that each, conceiving the symptoms of internal revolt peculiar  to himself, began, with infinite exertion, to swallow, in very small  quantities, the mess which he internally loathed.    Dr. Black, at length, showed the white feather, but in a very delicate  manner, as if to sound the opinion of his messmate. \"Doctor,\" he said,  in his precise and quiet manner--\"Doctor--do you not think that they  taste a little--a very little, green?\" \"D----d green! d----d green!  indeed--tak' them awa',--tak' them awa'!\" vociferated Dr. Hutton, starting  up from table, and giving full vent to his feelings of abhorrence. So  ended all hopes of introducing snails into the modern _cuisine_; and  thus philosophy can no more cure a nausea than honour can set a broken  limb.--_Sir Walter Scott._           *       *       *       *       *      CURRAN'S IMAGINATION.    \"Curran!\" (says Lord Byron) \"Curran's the man who struck me most. Such  imagination!--there never was anything like it that I ever heard of.  His _published_ life--his published speeches, give you no idea of the  man--none at all. He was a _machine_ of imagination, as some one said  that Prior was an epigrammatic machine.\" Upon another occasion, Byron  said, \"the riches of Curran's Irish imagination were exhaustless. I have  heard that man speak more poetry than I have ever seen written--though I  saw him seldom, and but occasionally. I saw him presented to Madame de  Stael, at Mackintosh's--it was the grand confluence between the Rhone  and the Saone; they were both so d----d ugly, that I could not help  wondering how the best intellects of France and Ireland could have taken  up respectively such residences.\"           *       *       *       *       *      COWLEY AT CHERTSEY.    The poet Cowley died at the Porch House, Chertsey, on the 21st of July,  1667. There is a curious letter preserved of his condition when he  removed here from Barn Elms. It is addressed to Dr. Sprat, dated  Chertsey, 21 May, 1665, and is as follows:--        \"The first night that I came hither I caught so great a cold, with      a defluxion of rheum, as made me keep my chamber ten days. And,      too, after had such a bruise on my ribs with a fall, that I am yet      unable to move or turn myself in bed. This is my personal fortune      here to begin with. And besides, I can get no money from my tenants,      and have my meadows eaten up every night by cattle put in by my      neighbours. What this signifies, or may come to in time, God knows!      if it be ominous, it can end in nothing but hanging.\"----\"I do hope      to recover my hurt so farre within five or six days (though it be      uncertain yet whether I shall ever recover it) as to walk about      again. And then, methinks, you and I and _the Dean_ might be very      merry upon St. Ann's Hill. You might very conveniently come hither      by way of Hampton Town, lying there one night. I write this in      pain, and can say no more.--_Verbum sapienti._\"    It is stated, by Sprat, that the last illness of Cowley was owing to his  having taken cold through staying too long among his labourers in the  meadows; but, in Spence's _Anecdotes_ we are informed, (on the authority  of Pope,) that \"his death was occasioned by a mere accident whilst his  great friend, Dean Sprat, was with him on a visit at Chertsey. They had  been together to see a neighbour of Cowley's, who, (according to the  fashion of those times,) made them too welcome. They did not set out for  their walk home till it was too late; and had drank so deep that they  lay out in the fields all night. This gave Cowley the fever that carried  him off. The parish still talk of the drunken Dean.\"           *       *       *       *       *      A PRETTY COMPLIMENT.    Although Dr. Johnson had (or professed to have) a profound and unjustified  contempt for actors, he succeeded in comporting himself towards Mrs.  Siddons with great politeness; and once, when she called to see him at  Bolt Court, and his servant Frank could not immediately furnish her with  a chair, the doctor said, \"You see, madam, that wherever you go there  are _no"]]]
