And now I hate such depraved and crooked persons,  though I love them if corrigible, so as to prefer to money the learning  which they acquire, and to learning, Thee, O God, the truth and fulness  of assured good, and most pure peace. But then I rather for my own sake  misliked them evil, than liked and wished them good for Thine.    When therefore they of Milan had sent to Rome to the prefect of the  city, to furnish them with a rhetoric reader for their city, and sent  him at the public expense, I made application (through those very  persons, intoxicated with Manichaean vanities, to be freed wherefrom  I was to go, neither of us however knowing it) that Symmachus, then  prefect of the city, would try me by setting me some subject, and so  send me. To Milan I came, to Ambrose the Bishop, known to the whole  world as among the best of men, Thy devout servant; whose eloquent  discourse did then plentifully dispense unto Thy people the flour of Thy  wheat, the gladness of Thy oil, and the sober inebriation of Thy wine.  To him was I unknowing led by Thee, that by him I might knowingly be  led to Thee. That man of God received me as a father, and showed me an  Episcopal kindness on my coming. Thenceforth I began to love him, at  first indeed not as a teacher of the truth (which I utterly despaired  of in Thy Church), but as a person kind towards myself. And I listened  diligently to him preaching to the people, not with that intent I ought,  but, as it were, trying his eloquence, whether it answered the fame  thereof, or flowed fuller or lower than was reported; and I hung on his  words attentively; but of the matter I was as a careless and scornful  looker-on; and I was delighted with the sweetness of his discourse,  more recondite, yet in manner less winning and harmonious, than that of  Faustus. Of the matter, however, there was no comparison; for the one  was wandering amid Manichaean delusions, the other teaching salvation  most soundly. But salvation is far from sinners, such as I then stood  before him; and yet was I drawing nearer by little and little, and  unconsciously.    For though I took no pains to learn what he spake, but only to hear how  he spake (for that empty care alone was left me, despairing of a way,  open for man, to Thee), yet together with the words which I would  choose, came also into my mind the things which I would refuse; for  I could not separate them. And while I opened my heart to admit \"how  eloquently he spake,\" there also entered \"how truly he spake\"; but this  by degrees. For first, these things also had now begun to appear to  me capable of defence; and the Catholic faith, for which I had thought  nothing could be said against the Manichees' objections, I now thought  might be maintained without shamelessness; especially after I had heard  one or two places of the Old Testament resolved, and ofttimes \"in a  figure,\" which when I understood literally, I was slain spiritually.  Very many places then of those books having been explained, I now blamed  my despair, in believing that no answer could be given to such as hated  and scoffed at the Law and the Prophets. Yet did I not therefore then  see that the Catholic way was to be held, because it also could find  learned maintainers, who could at large and with some show of reason  answer objections; nor that what I held was therefore to be condemned,  because both sides could be maintained. For the Catholic cause seemed to  me in such sort not vanquished, as still not as yet to be victorious.    Hereupon I earnestly bent my mind, to see if in any way I could by any  certain proof convict the Manichees of falsehood. Could I once have  conceived a spiritual substance, all their strongholds had been beaten  down, and cast utterly out of my mind; but I could not. Notwithstanding,  concerning the frame of this world, and the whole of nature, which the  senses of the flesh can reach to, as I more and more considered and  compared things, I judged the tenets of most of the philosophers to have  been much more probable. So then after the manner of the Academics (as  they are supposed) doubting of every thing, and wavering between all, I  settled so far, that the Manichees were to be abandoned; judging that,  even while doubting, I might not continue in that sect, to which I  already preferred some of the philosophers; to which philosophers  notwithstanding, for that they were without the saving Name of Christ,  I utterly refused to commit the cure of my sick soul. I determined  therefore so long to be a Catechumen in the Catholic Church, to which  I had been commended by my parents, till something certain should dawn  upon me, whither I might steer my course.          BOOK VI      O Thou, my hope from my youth, where wert Thou to me, and whither wert  Thou gone? Hadst not Thou created me, and separated me from the beasts  of the field, and fowls of the air? Thou hadst made me wiser, yet did I  walk in darkness, and in slippery places, and sought Thee abroad out of  myself, and found not the God of my heart; and had come into the depths  of the sea, and distrusted and despaired of ever finding truth. My  mother had now come to me, resolute through piety, following me over sea  and land, in all perils confiding in Thee. For in perils of the sea, she  comforted the very mariners (by whom passengers unacquainted with the  deep, use rather to be comforted when troubled), assuring them of a safe  arrival, because Thou hadst by a vision assured her thereof. She found  me in grievous peril, through despair of ever finding truth. But when  I had discovered to her that I was now no longer a Manichee, though  not yet a Catholic Christian, she was not overjoyed, as at something  unexpected; although she was now assured concerning that part of my  misery, for which she bewailed me as one dead, though to be reawakened  by Thee, carrying me forth upon the bier of her thoughts, that Thou  mightest say to the son of the widow, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise;  and he should revive, and begin to speak, and Thou shouldest deliver him  to his mother. Her heart then was shaken with no tumultuous exultation,  when she heard that what she daily with tears desired of Thee was  already in so great part realised; in that, though I had not yet  attained the truth, I was rescued from falsehood; but, as being assured,  that Thou, Who hadst promised the whole, wouldest one day give the rest,  most calmly, and with a heart full of confidence, she replied to me,  \"She believed in Christ, that before she departed this life, she should  see me a Catholic believer.\" Thus much to me. But to Thee, Fountain  of mercies, poured she forth more copious prayers and tears, that Thou  wouldest hasten Thy help, and enlighten my darkness; and she hastened  the more eagerly to the Church, and hung upon the lips of Ambrose,  praying for the fountain of that water, which springeth up unto life  everlasting. But that man she loved as an angel of God, because she knew  that by him I had been brought for the present to that doubtful state of  faith I now was in, through which she anticipated most confidently that  I should pass from sickness unto health, after the access, as it were,  of a sharper fit, which physicians call \"the crisis.\"    When then my mother had once, as she was wont in Afric, brought to the  Churches built in memory of the Saints, certain cakes, and bread and  wine, and was forbidden by the door-keeper; so soon as she knew that the  Bishop had forbidden this, she so piously and obediently embraced  his wishes, that I myself wondered how readily she censured her own  practice, rather than discuss his prohibition. For wine-bibbing did not  lay siege to her spirit, nor did love of wine provoke her to hatred of  the truth, as it doth too many (both men and women), who revolt at a  lesson of sobriety, as men well-drunk at a draught mingled with  water. But she, when she had brought her basket with the accustomed  festival-food, to be but tasted by herself, and then given away, never  joined therewith more than one small cup of wine, diluted according to  her own abstemious habits, which for courtesy she would taste. And if  there were many churches of the departed saints that were to be honoured  in that manner, she still carried round that same one cup, to be  used every where; and this, though not only made very watery, but  unpleasantly heated with carrying about, she would distribute to those  about her by small sips; for she sought there devotion, not pleasure.  So soon, then, as she found this custom to be forbidden by that famous  preacher and most pious prelate, even to those that would use it  soberly, lest so an occasion of excess might be given to the drunken;  and for these, as it were, anniversary funeral solemnities did much  resemble the superstition of the Gentiles, she most willingly forbare  it: and for a basket filled with fruits of the earth, she had learned to  bring to the Churches of the martyrs a breast filled with more  purified petitions, and to give what she could to the poor; that so  the communication of the Lord's Body might be there rightly celebrated,  where, after the example of His Passion, the martyrs had been sacrificed  and crowned. But yet it seems to me, O Lord my God, and thus thinks my  heart of it in Thy sight, that perhaps she would not so readily have  yielded to the cutting off of this custom, had it been forbidden by  another, whom she loved not as Ambrose, whom, for my salvation,  she loved most entirely; and he her again, for her most religious  conversation, whereby in good works, so fervent in spirit, she was  constant at church; so that, when he saw me, he often burst forth into  her praises; congratulating me that I had such a mother; not knowing  what a son she had in me, who doubted of all these things, and imagined"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32982"],[0,"Student's Hand-book of Mushrooms of America, Edible and Poisonous (#17)"],[1,"     15.

Pileus not striate                           _Panaeolus_    In the Friesian classification which, with modifications, has prevailed  for many years among mycologists, the _genus Agaricus_ included in its  _subgenera_ the greater part of the species of the order _Agaricini_.  The subgenera, printed in the above table in italics, were included in  this genus. The genera are printed in capitals. In the Saccardian  system, all the _subgenera_ of _Agaricus_ having been elevated to  _generic_ rank, the term Agaricus is limited to a very small group which  includes the _subgenus Psalliota_ of Fries, the species being  characterized by fleshy caps, free gills, ringed stem, and dark brown or  purplish brown spores. As restricted, it naturally falls into the spore  series _Melanosporeae._    In the white-spored section, Leucospori, the recorded edible species  occur in the following genera: Marasmius, Cantharellus, Lactarius,  Russula, Hygrophorus, Collybia, Pleurotus, Clitocybe, Tricholoma,  Armillaria, Lepiota, and Amanita. The plants of Marasmius are usually  thin and dry, reviving with moisture. Cantharellus is characterized by  the obtuseness of the edges of the lamellae, Lactarius by the copious  milky or sticky fluid which exudes from the plants when cut or bruised.  Russula is closely allied to Lactarius, and the plants bear some  resemblance in external appearance to those of that genus, but they are  never milky, and the gills are usually rigid and brittle. In Hygrophorus  the plants are moist, not very large, often bright colored, and the  gills have a waxy appearance. The Collybias are usually caespitose, the  stems exteriorly cartilaginous, in some species swelling and splitting  open in the centre.    In Pleurotus the stem is lateral or absent. The plants are epiphytal,  usually springing from the decaying bark of trees and old stumps.    In Clitocybe the plants are characterized by a deeply depressed, often  narrow cap, with the gills acutely adnate, or running far down the stem,  which is elastic, with a fibrous outer coat covered with minute fibers.  Many of the species have a fragrant odor. The Tricholomas are stout and  fleshy, somewhat resembling the Russulas, but distinguished from them by  the sinuate character of the gills, which show a slight notched or  toothed depression just before reaching the stem (represented in Fig. 4,  Plate IV). Typical species of Armillaria show a well-defined ring and  scales upon the stem, the remains of the partial veil, and the plants  are usually large, and caespitose. The Lepiotas are recognized by the  soft, thready character of the fleshy portion of the cap, and the  fringed scales formed by the breaking of the cuticle. The ease with  which the ringed stem is removed from its socket in the cap is another  characteristic which distinguishes the plants from those of other  genera.    The Amanitas are distinguished by the volva, which sheathes the somewhat  bulbous stem at its base and the ring and veil which in the young plant  are very distinct features, the whole plant in embryo being enveloped in  the volva.    The Amanita group, besides containing some very good edible species, is  also credited with containing the most dangerous species of all the  mushroom family, and some which are undoubtedly fatal in their  effects.[A]    [A] A more detailed description of this group will appear in No. 5 of  this series.    The Nyctali are minute mushrooms parasitic on other mushrooms.    In Omphalia, the plants are quite small, with membranaceous caps, gills  truly decurrent, and cartilaginous stems.    The Myceneae are generally very small, slender, and fragile, usually  caespitose, with bell-shaped caps, sinuate gills, not decurrent, and  cartilaginous stems. In some species the plants exude a milky juice.    In the genera Panus, Lentinus, Lenzites, Schizophyllum, Xerotus, and  Trogia, the plants are leathery or coriaceous, dry and tough, and though  none are recorded as poisonous, they are too tough to be edible.    The mushrooms having pink or salmon colored spores, section Rhodosporii,  form the smallest of the four primary groups of Agaricini, the number of  known species not exceeding 400, and most of these are tasteless, or of  disagreeable odor, while some are recorded as unwholesome.    The species are pink-gilled when mature, though often white or whitish  when very young.    The recorded edible species are found in Volvaria, Clitopilus, and  Pluteus. The Volvariae are characterized by the very large and perfect  volva which wraps the base of the stem in loose folds, the ringless  stem, and the pink, soft, liquescent gills, which are free and rounded  behind. The cap is not warted; in some species it is viscid, and in  _bombycinus_, recorded by several authors as edible, and by some as  doubtful, it is covered with a silky down.    In Clitopilus the odor of the edible species is more or less mealy. The  cap is fleshy, and the margin at first involute. Two edible species  which closely resemble each other--viz., Clitopilus _prunulus_, \"Plum  mushroom,\" and Clitopilus _orcella_, \"Sweetbread mushroom,\"--are highly  recommended for their delicacy of flavor.    In Leptonia most of the species are small, thin, and brittle,  corresponding with Mycena in the white-spored series, and with Psathyra  and Psathyrella in the dark-spored series.    Eccilia corresponds with Omphalia. Claudopus corresponds with Pleurotus  in its habit of growth and lateral stem, differing in the color of the  spores.    Annularia includes only a few small species having a ringed stem, no  volva, and free pink gills. Cooke says of this subgenus that no British  species are known."]]]
