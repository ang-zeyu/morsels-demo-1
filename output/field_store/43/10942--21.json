Hence we find the bull Indras, the winner of the cows,  become a winner and a seducer of women; we see the bull Wind, who aids  Indras in the conquest of the cows, become the violator of a hundred  damsels;[265] we read of the bull and god Rudras, as husband of Uma,  given up to sensual indulgence for a hundred years without a pause; that  the son of the bull, or of the wind, Hanumant, does prodigies of valour  and strength for the sake of a beautiful woman, and receives, as a  reward for his zeal, from the king Bharatas, a hundred thousand cows,  sixteen wives, and a hundred servant-maids.[266] What could Hanumant  have done with so many wives and maids, if he were simply a bull? or  what could he have done with so many cows, if he had been an ape? It is  these inconsistencies which have caused mythology to be condemned by the  crowd of old but prolific pedants, as a vain science; whereas, on the  contrary, it is precisely these inconsistencies which raise it, in our  esteem, to the rank of a valid science. He who handed down to us the  feats of Hanumant, took care also to tell us how he had the faculty of  changing his form at will; and this faculty, attributed to this  impersonation of a celestial phenomenon, is the fruit of one of the most  _naive_ but just observations of virgin and grandiose nature.    FOOTNOTES:    [132] I must, however, observe that competent authorities, such as  Professor Weber, consider the phallical worship of Civas to have  originated in the beliefs of the indigenous tribes of Dravidian race.

As a result of the commercial agreement between Spain and the United  States, German submarines began a blockade of Spanish ports, April 11.    Because a German submarine had captured a Uruguayan military commission  bound for France, the Government of Uruguay on April 11 asked Berlin,  through Switzerland, whether it considered that a state of war existed  with Uruguay.
