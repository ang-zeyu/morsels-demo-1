Our language happily has no words in which the state of this village  can be described. In front of this room is a broken ditch full of  slimy greenish water, which Hadji took for my tea! There has been a  slight snowfall during the night, and snow is impending. We have now  reached a considerable altitude, and may expect anything. Hadji has  just climbed the stair with groans of \"_Ya Allah_,\" and has almost  wailed out, \"Colonel says we go--God help us.\"    _Kirrind, Jan. 23._--From Saripul-i-Zohab we are taking the most  southerly of the three routes to Kirmanshah traversed by Sir H.  Rawlinson in 1836.[12] A sea of mud varied by patches of sodden snow,  walls of rock with narrow passes, great snow-covered mountains, seen  spectrally for a minute at a time through swirling snow-clouds, black  tents of nomads, half-drowned villages, and a long, cold, steep  ascent, among scrub oaks and dwarf ash, to snow which was not melting,  and the hospitalities of a Kurdish village, comprise the interests of  the march from Saripul to Myan Tak, so far as they lie on the surface,  but in various ways this part of Kurdistan has many interests, not to  be absolutely ignored even in a familiar letter.    Here the Ilyats, who are supposed to constitute a fifth of the rural  population of Persia, are met with in large numbers, and their brown  flocks and herds are still picking up a scanty subsistence. The great  chief of this, the Gur[=a]n tribe, holds the region on an annual  payment to the Persian Government, gives grain to his tribesmen, and  receives from them, of corn one-half, and of rice two-thirds of the  crop. These people sow their grain in early spring, and then move up  with their flocks to the mountain pastures, leaving behind only a few  men to harvest the crops. They use no manure, this being required for  fuel, and in the case of rice they allow a fallow of at least seven  years. There are very few cultivators resident upon these lands, but  Ilyat camps occur frequently.    The region is steeped in history. The wretched village of Saripul is  the Calah of Asshur and the Halah of the Israelitish captivity,[13]  and gave to the surrounding country the name of Chalonitis, which we  have on our old maps. A metropolitan See in the fifth century A.D.,  soon after the institution of the Nestorian hierarchy, it was called  Calah, Halah, and Holwan. If the Diyalah be the ancient Gyndes,  noteworthy for the singular delay of Cyrus on his march to Babylon,  and Saripul the ancient Holwan, and if in addition to the numerous  Chaldaean and Sasanian remains there are relics of Semiramis and of the  fire-temples of the Magi, the crowd of historic associations is almost  too much for one day, and I will return to the insignificant details  of the journey.    We left at nine, crossed the Holwan by a four-arched brick bridge, and  in falling snow and deep mud rode over fairly level ground till we  came to an abrupt range of limestone rock, with a natural rift, across  which the foundations of a wall still remain. The clouds were rolling  low, and the snow was driving wildly, so as to make it impossible to  see the sculptured tablet described by Rawlinson and Layard, on which  a high-priest of the Magi is represented, with one hand raised in  benediction, and the other grasping a scroll, the dress being the  pontifical robe worn by the Zoroastrian priests, with a square cap,  pointed in front, and lappets covering the mouth. Above this is a tomb  with an ornamented entrance.    We were now among a very strange and mysterious people, of whose  ancestry and actual beliefs very little is known. They are Ali-Ilahis,  but Europeans often speak of them as \"Davidites,\" from their special  veneration for King David. This tomb in the rift is called  Dukkani-Daoud, or David's shop, and the people believe that he still  dwells there, and come on pilgrimages and to offer animals in  sacrifice from all parts of Kurdistan. He is believed to work as a  smith, and the _katirgis_ say that he makes suits of fine armour. A  part of the tomb which is divided from the rest by a low partition is  believed to be a reservoir containing the water which he uses to  temper his metal. A great mound with some building in the centre, on  the right of the road near this gorge, though properly it bears  another name, is called by the people \"David's Fort.\" Jewish  traditions abound, specially concerning David, who is regarded by the  tribes as their great tutelar prophet.    The Gur[=a]ns and Kalhurs, who are the nomadic inhabitants of this  district, are of a very marked type of physiognomy, so Israelitish  indeed that, taken along with certain traditions of their origin,  their Jewish names, and their veneration for David, they have been put  forward as claimants to the dignity of being the \"lost tribes.\" The  great Hebrew traveller of the twelfth century, to whom I have referred  before, believed that the whole of the Ali-Ilahis were Jews, and  writes of 100 synagogues in the Zagros mountains, and of 50,000 Jewish  families in the neighbourhood.    As we shall be for some days among these people, I will abbreviate Sir  H. Rawlinson's sketch of their tenets. He considers that Ali-Ilahism  bears evident marks of Judaism, mixed up with Moslem, Christian, and  Sabaean legends. The Ali-Ilahis believe in 1001 incarnations of the  Godhead in a series; among them Benjamin, Moses, Elias, David, Jesus  Christ, Ali and Salman his tutor, the Imam Houssein and the Haft[=a]n  (or seven bodies), the chief spiritual guides in the early ages of  Islam, \"and each, worshipped as a Deity, is an object of adoration in  some locality of Kurdistan.\" The tomb of one of these, B[=a]b[=a]  Yadg[=a]r, is their holy place, and this was regarded as the dwelling  of Elijah at the time when the Arabs invaded Persia. All these  incarnations are regarded as of one and the same person. All that  changes is the bodily form of the Divine manifestation. There are  degrees in the perfection of the development, and the most perfect  forms are Benjamin, David, and Ali.    Practically, however, the metaphysical speculations involved in this  creed of successive incarnations are unknown, and the Imam Ali, the  cousin of Mohammed, is the great object of worship. Though professing  Mohammedanism the Ali-Ilahis are held in great horror by \"believers,\"  and those of this region lie under the stigma of practising unholy  rites as a part of their religion, and have received the name of  \"Chiragh Sonderan,\" the putters-out of lights.[14] This accusation,  Sir A. H. Layard observes, may be only a calumny invented, like many  another, to justify persecution.    Passing through the rift in the Dukkani-Daoud range which has led to  this digression, we entered an ascending valley between the range  through which we had passed and some wild mountains covered with snow,  which were then actively engaged in brewing a storm. Farther on there  was irrigation and cultivation, and then the wretched village of Pai  Tak, and the ruins of a bridge. There, the people told us, we must  halt, as the caravanserai at the next place was already full, and we  plunged about in the snow and mud looking for a hovel in which to take  shelter, but decided to risk going on, and shortly began the ascent of  the remarkable pass known as \"The Gates of Zagros,\" on the ancient  highway between Babylonia and Media, by which, in a few hours, the  mountain barrier of Zagros is crossed, and the plain of Kirrind, a  part of the great Iranian plateau, is reached.    This great road, which zigzags steeply up the pass, is partly composed  of smoothed boulders and partly of natural rock, somewhat dressed, and  much worn by the continual passage of shod animals. It is said to be  much like a torrent bed, but the snow was lying heavily upon it,  filling up its inequalities. Dwarf oaks, hawthorn, ash, and other  scrub find root-hold in every crevice. All that may be ugly was draped  in pure white, and looking back from the surrounding glitter, the view  of low ranges lying in indigo gloom was very striking. On the ascent  there is a remarkable arch of great blocks of white marble, with a  vaulted recess, called the \"Tak-i-Girreh,\" \"the arch holding the  road,\" which gives the popular name of Gardan-i-Tak-i-Girreh (the pass  of Tak-i-Girreh) to the ascent, though the geographers call it  Akabah-i-Holwan (the defile of Holwan).    After the deep mud of the earlier part of the march it was a pleasure  to ride through pure, deep, powdery snow, and to find the dirt of the  village of Myan Tak, a Kurdish hamlet situated on a mountain torrent  among steep hills and small trees, covered with this radiant mantle.  The elevation of the pass is 4630 feet, but Myan Tak is at a lower  altitude an hour farther on.    The small and ruinous caravanserai was really full of caravans  detained by the snowstorm, and we lodged in a Kurdish house, typical  of the style of architecture common among the settled tribes. Within a  wide doorway without a door, high enough for a loaded mule to enter,  is a very large room, with a low, flat mud roof, supported on three  rows of misshapen trunks of trees, with their branches cut off about a  foot from the stem, all black and shiny with smoke. Mud and rubble  platforms, two feet high, run along one side and one end, and on the  end one there is a clay, beehive-shaped fireplace, but no chimney.  Under this platform the many fowls are shut in at night by a stone at  the hole by which they enter. Within this room is a perfectly dark  stable of great size. Certainly forty mules, besides asses and oxen,  were lodged in it, and the overflow shared the living-room with a  number"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38828"],[0,"Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, Volume 2 (of 2) (#17)"],[1,"plain. A blazing hillside; a mountain of  gravel among others of similar ugliness, sprinkled with camel thorn  and thistles; a steep and long descent to a stream; ripe wheat on some  irrigated slopes; above these the hundred hovels of the village of  Sarawand clinging one above another to the hillside, their white clay  roofs intolerable in the fierce light; more scorched gravel hills  breaking off abruptly, and then a blazing plain, in a mist of dust and  heat, and low hills on the farther side seen through a brown haze,  make up the view from my tent. The plain is Silakhor in Persia proper,  and, _nolens volens_, that heat and dust must shortly be encountered  in the hottest month of the year. Meanwhile the mercury is at 105 deg. in  the tent.    Outside is a noisy crowd of a mixed race, more Persian than Lur, row  behind row. The _ketchuda_ said if I would stand outside and show  myself the people would be pacified, but the desired result was not  attained, and the crushing and pushing were fearful--not that the  people here or elsewhere are ever rude, it is simply that their  curiosity is not restrained by those rules which govern ours. The Agha  tried to create a diversion by putting a large musical box at a little  distance, but they did not care for it. I attempted to give each woman  a card of china buttons, which they like for sewing on the caps of  their children, but the crush was so overpowering that I was obliged  to leave it to Aziz. Then came the sick people with their many woes  and wants, and though now at sunset they have all gone, Aziz comes in  every few minutes with the laugh of a lost spirit, bringing a fresh  copper bowl for eye lotion, quite pleased to think of my annoyance at  being constantly dragged up from my writing.    _Camp Parwez, July 31._--We left early in the morning, _en route_ for  the fort of Yahya Khan, the powerful chief of the Pulawand tribe, with  a tall, well-dressed, and very respectable-looking man, Bagha Khan,  one of his many fathers-in-law, the father of the present \"reigning  favourite,\" as guide. It was a very pretty track, pursuing sheep-paths  over steep spurs of Parwez, and along the narrow crests of ridges,  always with fine views. On reaching an alpine valley, rich in flowers,  we halted till the caravan approached, and then rode on, the \"we\" that  day being the guide on foot, and the Agha, the Sahib, Aziz Khan,  Mirza, and myself on horseback in single file. Three men looked over  the crest of a ridge to the left and disappeared abruptly, and I  remarked to Mirza that this was the most suspicious circumstance we  had yet seen. There was one man on the hill to the right, with whom  the guide exchanged some sentences in patois.    The valley opened out on the stony side of a hill, which had to be  crossed. As we climbed it was crested with a number of men with long  guns. Presently a number of shots were fired at us, and the reloading  of the guns was distinctly seen. The order was given to \"scatter\" and  proceed slowly. When the first shot was fired Bagha Khan, who must  have been well known to all his tribesmen, dodged under a rock. Then  came an irregular volley from a number of guns, and the whistle and  thud of bullets over and among us showed that the tribesmen, whatever  were their intentions, were in earnest. To this volley the Agha  replied by a rifle shot which passed close over their heads, but again  they reloaded rapidly. We halted, and Aziz Khan was sent up to parley  with them. No one could doubt his courage after that solitary ascent  in the very face of the guns.    Karim cantered up, anxious to fight, Mujid and Hassan, much excited,  dashed up, and we rode on slowly, Hadji and his _charvadars_ bringing  up the caravan as steadily as if there were no danger ahead. Not a man  showed the \"white feather,\" though most, like myself, were \"under  fire\" for the first time. When we reached the crest of the pass such a  wild lot crowded about us, their guns yet hot from firing upon us.  Such queer arms they had--one gun with a flint lock a century old,  with the \"Tower mark\" upon it, loaded sticks, and long knives. With  much talking and excitement they accompanied us to this  camping-ground.[8]    The men varied considerably in their stories. They were frightened,  they said, and fired because they thought we were come to harm them.  At first I was sorry for them, and regarded them as merely defending  their \"hearths and homes,\" for in the alpine valley behind the hill  are their black tents, their families, their flocks and herds--their  world, in fact. But they told another story, and said they took us for  a party of Hajwands. This was untenable, and the Agha told them that  they knew that Hajwands do not ride on English saddles, and carry  white umbrellas, and march with big caravans of mules. To me, when  they desired my services, they said that had they known that one of  the party was a _Hak[=i]m_ they never would have fired.    Later, from Hadji and others I have heard what I think may be the true  version of the affair. They knew that the party was a small one--only  three rifles; that on the fifteen baggage-animals there were things  which they specially covet, the value of which rumour had doubtless  magnified a hundredfold; and that we had no escort. Behind were a  number of the Sarawand men, and the Pulawands purposed, if we turned  back or showed the \"white feather\" in any way, to double us up between  the two parties and rob the caravan at discretion. The Agha was  obliged to speak very severely to them, telling them that firing on  travellers is a grave offence, and deserves as such to be represented  to the Governor of Burujird. I cannot acquit the demure-looking guide  of complicity in this transaction.    At this height of 9400 feet there is a pleasant plain, on which our  assailants are camped, and our camps are on platforms in a gully near  the top of Parwez. It is all very destitute of springs or streams, and  we have only snow-water, and that only during the hot hours of the  day, for ourselves and the animals.    The tribes among which we are now are powerful and very predatory in  their habits. Their loyalty to the Ilkhani is shadowy, and their  allegiance to the Shah consists in the payment of tribute, which  cannot in all cases be exacted. Indeed, I think that both in Tihran  and Isfahan there is only imperfect information as to the attitude of  the Bakhtiari Lurs. Their unification under the rule of the Ilkhani  grows more and more incomplete as the distance from Isfahan increases,  and these tribes, which are under the government of Burujird  nominally, are practically not under the Ilkhani at all. Blood feuds,  predatory raids, Khans at war with each other, tribal disputes and  hostilities, are nearly universal. It is not for the interest of  Persia to produce by her misrule and intrigues such a chronic state  of insecurity as makes the tribes desire any foreign interference  which will give them security and rest, and relieve them from the  oppressive exactions of the Persian governors.    On a recent march I was riding alone in advance of the caravan when I  met two men, one mounted, the other on foot. The pedestrian could not  have been passed anywhere unnoticed. He looked like a Sicilian  brigand, very handsome and well dressed, walked with a long elastic  stride, and was armed with a double-barrelled gun and two revolvers.  He looked hard at me, with a jolly but not unfriendly look, and then  seeing the caravan, passed on. This was Jiji, a great robber Khan of  the Hajwand tribe, whose name inspires much fear. Afterwards he met  Aziz Khan, and sent this picturesque message: \"Sorry to have missed  you in my own country, as I should have liked to have left you  standing in your skins.\"    I went up the Kuh-i-Parwez with Bagha Khan, the guide of whom I have  such grave suspicions, in the early morning, when the cool blue  shadows were still lying in the ravines. Parwez, which on this side is  an uninteresting mountain of herbage-covered gravelly slopes, falls  down 4300 feet to the Holiwar valley on the other in a series of  tremendous battlemented precipices of dark conglomerate rock.    The level summit of Parwez, though about 11,000 feet in altitude, is  as uninteresting as the shapeless slopes by which we ascended it, but  this dip on the southern side is wonderful, and is carried on to the  gap of Bahrain, where it has a perpendicular scarp from its summit to  the river of 5000 feet, and as it grandly terminates the Outer range,  it looks like a glorious headland abutting on the Silakhor plain.    As a panoramic view it is the finest I have had from any mountain,  taking in the great Shuturun range--the wide cultivated plain of  Silakhor, with its many villages; the winding Ab-i-Diz, its yellow  crops, hardly distinguishable from the yellow soil and hazy yellow  hills whose many spurs descend upon the plain--all merged in a haze of  dust and heat. The eye is not tempted to linger long upon that  specimen of a Persian summer landscape, but turns with relief to the  other side of the ridge, to a confused mass of mountains of great  height, built up of precipices of solid rock, dark gray, weathered  into black and denuded of soil, a mystery of chasms, rifts, and  river-beds, sheltering and feeding predatory tribes, but unknown to  the rest of the world.    The chaos of mountain summits, chasms, and precipices is very  remarkable, merging into lower and less definite ranges, with alpine  meadows at great heights, and ravines much wooded, where charcoal is  burned and carried to Burujird and Hamadan. Among the salient points  of this singular landscape are the mighty Shuturun range, the peak of  Kuh-i-Kargun on the other side of the Silakhor plain, the river which  comes down from Lake Irene, the Holiwar, with the fantastic range of  the Kuh-i-Haft-Kuh (seven peaks) on its left bank, descending abruptly  to the Ab-i"]]]
