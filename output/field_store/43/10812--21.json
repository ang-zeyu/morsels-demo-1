The leader sprang at her, leaping  as high as he could against the trunk; and she, barely out of reach of  his clashing, bloody fangs, snapped back at him with a vicious growl,  trying to catch the tip of his nose. Failing in this, she struck at  him like lightning with her powerful claws, raking his muzzle so  severely that he fell back with a startled yelp. A moment later the  whole pack, their famine still unsatisfied, swept off again upon the  trail of the moose. The carcajou came down, sniffed angrily at the  clean bones which had been cracked for their marrow, then hurried off  on the track of the wolves.      II    Meanwhile, it had chanced that the man on snowshoes, fetching a wide  circle that would bring the end of his line of traps back nearly to  his cabin, had come suddenly face to face with the fleeing moose. Worn  out with the terror of his flight and the heart-breaking effort of  floundering through the heavy snow--which was, nevertheless, hard  enough, on the surface, to bear up his light-footed pursuers--the  great beast was near his last gasp. At sight of the man before him,  more to be dreaded even than the savage foe behind him, he snorted  wildly and plunged off to one side. But the man, borne up upon his  snowshoes, overtook him in a moment, and, suddenly stooping forward,  drew his long hunting-knife across the gasping throat. The snow about  grew crimson instantly, and the huge beast sank with a shudder.    The trapper knew that a moose so driven must have had enemies on  its trail, and he knew also that no enemies but wolves, or another  hunter, could have driven the moose to such a flight. There was no  other hunter ranging within twenty miles of him. Therefore, it was  wolves. He had no weapon with him but his knife and his light axe,  because his rifle was apt to be a useless burden in winter, when he  had always traps or pelts to carry. And it was rash for one man,  without his gun, to rob a wolf-pack of its kill! But the trapper  wanted fresh moose-meat. Hastily and skilfully he began to cut  from the carcass the choicest portions of haunch and loin. He had no  more than fairly got to work when the far-off cry of the pack  sounded on his expectant ears. He laboured furiously as the voices  drew nearer. The interruption of the lynx he understood, in a  measure, by the noises that reached him; but when the pack came  hot on the trail again he knew it was time to get away. He must  retreat promptly, but not be seen retreating. Bearing with him such  cuts as he had been able to secure, he made off in the direction of  his cabin. But at a distance of about two hundred yards he stepped  into a thicket at the base of a huge hemlock, and turned to see  what the wolves would do when they found they had been forestalled. As  he turned, the wolves appeared, and swept down upon the body of the  moose. But within a couple of paces of it they stopped short, with a  snarl of suspicion, and drew back hastily. The tracks and the  scent of their arch-enemy, man, were all about the carcass. His  handiwork--his clean cutting--was evident upon it. Their first  impulse was toward caution. Suspecting a trap, they circled warily  about the body. Then, reassured, their rage blazed up. Their own  quarry had been killed before them, their own hunting insolently  crossed. However, it was man, the ever-insolent overlord, who had  done it. He had taken toll as he would, and withdrawn when he would.  They did not quite dare to follow and seek vengeance. So in a few  moments their wrath had simmered down; and they fell savagely upon the  yet warm feast.    The trapper watched them from his hiding-place, not wishing to risk  attracting their attention before they had quite gorged themselves. He  knew there would be plenty of good meat left, even then; and that  they would at length proceed to bury it for future use. Then he could  dig it up again, take what remained clean and unmauled, and leave the  rest to its lawful owners; and all without unnecessary trouble.    As he watched the banqueting pack, he was suddenly conscious of a  movement in the branches of a fir a little beyond them. Then his quick  eye, keener in discrimination than that of any wolf, detected the  sturdy figure of a large wolverene making its way from tree to tree at  a safe distance above the snow, intent upon the wolves. What one  carcajou--\"Glutton,\" he called it--could hope, for all its cunning, to  accomplish against five big timber-wolves, he could not imagine.  Hating the \"Glutton,\" as all trappers do, he wished most earnestly  that it might slip on its branch and fall down before the fangs of the  pack.    There was no smallest danger of the wary carcajou doing anything of  the sort. Every faculty was on the alert to avenge herself on the  wolves who had robbed her of her destined prey. Most of the other  creatures of the wild she despised, but the wolves she also hated,  because she felt herself constrained to yield them way. She crawled  carefully from tree to tree, till at last she gained one whose lower  branches spread directly over the carcass of the moose. Creeping  out upon one of those branches, she glared down maliciously upon  her foes. Observing her, two of the wolves desisted long enough from  their feasting to leap up at her with fiercely gnashing teeth. But  finding her out of reach, and scornfully unmoved by their futile  demonstrations, they gave it up and fell again to their ravenous  feasting.    The wolverene is a big cousin to the weasel, and also to the skunk.  The ferocity of the weasel it shares, and the weasel's dauntless  courage. Its kinship to the skunk is attested by the possession of a  gland which secretes an oil of peculiarly potent malodour. The smell  of this oil is not so overpowering, so pungently strangulating, as  that emitted by the skunk; but all the wild creatures find it  irresistibly disgusting. No matter how pinched and racked by famine  they may be, not one of them will touch a morsel of meat which a  wolverene has defiled ever so slightly. The wolverene itself, however,  by no means shares this general prejudice.    When the carcajou had glared down upon the wolves for several minutes,  she ejected the contents of her oil-gland all over the body of the  moose, impartially treating her foes to a portion of the nauseating  fluid. With coughing, and sneezing, and furious yelping, the wolves  bounded away, and began rolling and burrowing in the snow. They could  not rid themselves at once of the dreadful odour; but, presently  recovering their self-possession, and resolutely ignoring the polluted  meat, they ranged themselves in a circle around the tree at a safe  distance, and snapped their long jaws vengefully at their adversary.  They seemed prepared to stay there indefinitely, in the hope of  starving out the carcajou and tearing her to pieces. Perceiving this,  the carcajou turned her back upon them, climbed farther up the tree to  a comfortable crotch, and settled herself indifferently for a nap. For  all her voracious appetite, she knew she could go hungry longer than  any wolf, and quite wear out the pack in a waiting game. Then the  trapper, indignant at seeing so much good meat spoiled, but his  sporting instincts stirred to sympathy by the triumph of one beast  like the carcajou over a whole wolf-pack, turned his back upon the  scene and resumed his tramp. The wolves had lost prestige in his  eyes, and he now felt ready to fight them all with his single axe.      III    From that day on the wolf-pack cherished a sleepless grudge against  the carcajou, and wasted precious hours, from time to time, striving  to catch her off her guard. The wolf's memory is a long one, and the  feud lost nothing in its bitterness as the winter weeks, loud with  storm or still with deadly cold, dragged by. For a time the crafty old  carcajou fed fat on the flesh which none but she could touch, while  all the other beasts but the bear, safe asleep in his den, and the  porcupine, browsing contentedly on hemlock and spruce, went lean with  famine. During this period, since she had all that even her great  appetite could dispose of, the carcajou robbed neither the hunter's  traps nor the scant stores of the other animals. But at last her  larder was bare. Then, turning her attention to the traps again, she  speedily drew upon her the trapper's wrath, and found herself obliged  to keep watch against two foes at once, and they the most powerful in  the wilderness--namely, the man and the wolf-pack. Even the magnitude  of this feud, however, did not daunt her greedy but fearless spirit,  and she continued to rob the traps, elude the wolves, and evade the  hunter's craftiest efforts, till the approach of spring not only eased  the famine of the forest but put an end to the man's trapping. When  the furs of the wild kindred began to lose their gloss and vitality,  the trapper loaded his pelts upon a big hand-sledge, sealed up his  cabin securely, and set out for the settlements before the snow should  all be gone. Once assured of his absence, the carcajou devoted all her  strength and cunning to making her way into the closed cabin. At last,  after infinite patience and endeavour, she managed to get in, through  the roof. There were supplies--flour, and bacon, and dried apples, all  very much to her distinctly catholic taste--and she enjoyed herself  immensely till private duties summoned her reluctantly away.    Spring comes late to the great snows, but when it does come it is  swift and not to be denied. Then summer, with much to do and little  time to do it in, rushes ardently down upon the plains and the  fir-forests. About three miles back from the cabin, on a dry knoll in  the heart of a tangled swamp, the old wolverene dug herself a  commodious and secret burrow. Here she gave birth to a litter of tiny  young ones, much"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30000"],[0,"The Bird Book (#17)"],[1,"._    Range.--Northern North America, breeding from Labrador, the Hudson Bay  region and the Aleutian Islands northward; winters south to Virginia,  the Great Lakes and California.

Wintering south to the Middle States,  southern Illinois and southern California.    The largest of the Scoters, length 22 inches, distinguished by a large  white speculum on the wing, also a white comet extending from under the  eye backwards. It also has a yellow eye. Like the other Scoters, this  species often feeds in very deep water. They are strong, active diving  birds, and are also strong on the wing, generally flying close to the  surface of the water. Their flesh is not regarded as good eating,  although they are often sold for that purpose. They nest on the ground,  generally in long grass or under low bushes making a coarse nest of  grasses, and sometimes twigs, lined with feathers. They lay from five to  eight eggs of a pale buff color. Size 2.75 x 1.85.      166. SURF SCOTER. _Oidemia perspicillata._    Range.--Northern North America, breeding north of the United States  boundary, and wintering south to Virginia and southern California.    The male of this species is entirely black, except for the white patches  on the forehead and nape, and the vari-colored bill of black, white,  pink and yellow. They nest either along the coast or in the interior,  building a nest lined with down, in the marsh grass bordering small  ponds. They lay from five to eight buffy cream colored eggs. Size 2.40 x  1.70. The females of all the Scoters are a dingy brownish color, but  show the characteristic marking of the species, although the white is  generally dull or sometimes mottled.

SNOW GOOSE. _Chen hyperboreus hyperboreus._    Range.--North America west of the Mississippi Valley, breeding in  northern Alaska and the MacKenzie River district.    This smaller species of the Snow Goose nests on islands in rivers along  the arctic coast. The nest is a depression in the ground, lined with  grasses and, occasionally down. They lay from four to eight eggs of a  buffy or yellowish white color. Size 2.75 x 1.75.      169a. GREATER SNOW GOOSE. _Chen hyperboreus nivalis._    Range.--Eastern North America, breeding in the Arctic regions and  wintering chiefly on the Atlantic coast, south to Cuba.    This bird is like the preceding; except in size; about thirty-six  inches, instead of twenty-six inches in length as is the lesser variety.  The entire plumage is white except for the black primaries. They  construct their nests of grasses on the ground the same as the preceding  variety. The eggs number from five to eight and are cream colored. Size  3.40 x 2.40.      169.1. BLUE GOOSE. _Chen caerulescens._    Range.--North America, principally in the interior, breeding from Hudson  Bay northward and wintering along the Gulf coast.

ROSS'S SNOW GOOSE. _Chen rossi._    Range.--This beautiful species, which is similar in plumage to the large  Snow Goose, is but twenty-one inches in length. It breeds in the extreme  north, and in winter is found in the western part of the United States  as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. Their nesting habits and eggs  probably do not differ from others in the family except in the matter of  size.      171. WHITE-FRONTED GOOSE. _Anser albifrons albifrons._    This European species is exactly like the American except that it is  said to average a trifle smaller. It is occasionally found in Greenland.      171a. AMERICAN WHITE-FRONTED GOOSE. _Anser albifrons gambeli._    Range.--Whole of North America, breeding in the Arctic regions and  wintering south to the Gulf coast; not common on the Atlantic coast  during migrations.    These birds may be recognized by their mottled plumage, dark head and  white forehead. This species is more abundant than any of the preceding  and nests in large colonies along the arctic coast and in Alaska. Their  nests are made of dried grasses, feathers and down and are placed on the  ground in a slight depression. From four to nine eggs are laid; these  have a dull buff ground. Size 3.00 x 2.05.

CANADA GOOSE. _Branta canadensis canadensis._    Range.--The whole of North America, breeding from northern United States  northward, and wintering in the southern parts of the United States.    This species is the most widely known of American Geese and is the most  abundant. Its familiar \"honk\" has long been regarded as the signal of  the coming of spring, and the familiar V-shaped formation in which the  flocks migrate is always an object of interest to everyone. With the  exception of in North Dakota and Minnesota, they breed chiefly north of  the United States. They construct quite a large nest of weeds and grass,  and warmly line it with down and feathers. They lay from four to nine  eggs of a buff or drab color. Size about 3.50 x 2.50. Data.--Ellingsars  Lake, North Dakota, May 18, 1896. Five eggs. Nest on an island in the  lake, constructed of weeds and trash, and lined with a few feathers.  Collector, Edwin S. Bryant.      172a. HUTCHINS GOOSE. _Branta canadensis hutchinsi._    This sub-species is like the preceding except that it is smaller, thirty  inches in length. It is a western variety, breeding in Alaska and along  the Arctic coast and wintering to southern California. Its breeding  habits, nests and eggs are the same as the common goose except that the  eggs are smaller. Size 3.00 x 2.05.      172b. WHITE-CHEEKED GOOSE. _Branta canadensis occidentalis._    This bird is about the same size as the Canada Goose and the plumage is  very similar except that the black sometimes extends on the throat,  thereby isolating the white cheek patches, and there is a white collar  below the back of the neck. It is a western species, breeding in Alaska  and wintering along the Pacific coast of the United States. Its nesting  habits and eggs are same as those of the Canada Goose except that the  latter are a trifle smaller.      172c. CACKLING GOOSE. _Branta canadensis minima._    This bird is really a miniature of the Canada Goose, being but  twenty-four inches in length. It breeds in Alaska and along the Arctic  coast and migrates into the western parts of the United States. They are  abundant birds in their breeding range, where they place their nests  upon the shores of ponds,"]]]
