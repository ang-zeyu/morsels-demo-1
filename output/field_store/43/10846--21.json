These apprehensions,  however, she tried to check, considering that they were probably the  effect of a melancholy imagination, which her father's situation, and  a consideration of her own circumstances, had made sensible to every  impression.    They passed slowly on, for they were now almost in darkness, which,  together with the unevenness of the ground, and the frequent roots of  old trees, that shot up above the soil, made it necessary to proceed  with caution. On a sudden Michael stopped the carriage; and, as St.  Aubert looked from the window to enquire the cause, he perceived a  figure at some distance moving up the avenue. The dusk would not permit  him to distinguish what it was, but he bade Michael go on.    'This seems a wild place,' said Michael; 'there is no house hereabout,  don't your honour think we had better turn back?'    'Go a little farther, and if we see no house then, we will return to the  road,' replied St. Aubert.    Michael proceeded with reluctance, and the extreme slowness of his pace  made St. Aubert look again from the window to hasten him, when again he  saw the same figure. He was somewhat startled: probably the gloominess  of the spot made him more liable to alarm than usual; however this  might be, he now stopped Michael, and bade him call to the person in the  avenue.    'Please your honour, he may be a robber,' said Michael. 'It does not  please me,' replied St. Aubert, who could not forbear smiling at the  simplicity of his phrase, 'and we will, therefore, return to the road,  for I see no probability of meeting here with what we seek.'    Michael turned about immediately, and was retracing his way with  alacrity, when a voice was heard from among the trees on the left. It  was not the voice of command, or distress, but a deep hollow tone, which  seemed to be scarcely human. The man whipped his mules till they went as  fast as possible, regardless of the darkness, the broken ground, and  the necks of the whole party, nor once stopped till he reached the gate,  which opened from the avenue into the high-road, where he went into a  more moderate pace.    'I am very ill,' said St. Aubert, taking his daughter's hand. 'You are  worse, then, sir!' said Emily, extremely alarmed by his manner, 'you  are worse, and here is no assistance. Good God! what is to be done!' He  leaned his head on her shoulder, while she endeavoured to support him  with her arm, and Michael was again ordered to stop. When the rattling  of the wheels had ceased, music was heard on their air; it was to Emily  the voice of Hope. 'Oh! we are near some human habitation!' said she,  'help may soon be had.'    She listened anxiously; the sounds were distant, and seemed to come from  a remote part of the woods that bordered the road; and, as she looked  towards the spot whence they issued, she perceived in the faint  moon-light something like a chateau. It was difficult, however, to reach  this; St. Aubert was now too ill to bear the motion of the carriage;  Michael could not quit his mules; and Emily, who still supported her  father, feared to leave him, and also feared to venture alone to such a  distance, she knew not whither, or to whom. Something, however, it was  necessary to determine upon immediately; St. Aubert, therefore, told  Michael to proceed slowly; but they had not gone far, when he fainted,  and the carriage was again stopped. He lay quite senseless.--'My dear,  dear father!' cried Emily in great agony, who began to fear that he was  dying, 'speak, if it is only one word to let me hear the sound of your  voice!' But no voice spoke in reply. In the agony of terror she bade  Michael bring water from the rivulet, that flowed along the road;  and, having received some in the man's hat, with trembling hands she  sprinkled it over her father's face, which, as the moon's rays now  fell upon it, seemed to bear the impression of death. Every emotion of  selfish fear now gave way to a stronger influence, and, committing St.  Aubert to the care of Michael, who refused to go far from his mules,  she stepped from the carriage in search of the chateau she had seen at  a distance. It was a still moon-light night, and the music, which yet  sounded on the air, directed her steps from the high road, up a shadowy  lane, that led to the woods. Her mind was for some time so entirely  occupied by anxiety and terror for her father, that she felt none for  herself, till the deepening gloom of the overhanging foliage, which now  wholly excluded the moon-light, and the wildness of the place, recalled  her to a sense of her adventurous situation. The music had ceased,  and she had no guide but chance. For a moment she paused in terrified  perplexity, till a sense of her father's condition again overcoming  every consideration for herself, she proceeded. The lane terminated in  the woods, but she looked round in vain for a house, or a human being,  and as vainly listened for a sound to guide her. She hurried on,  however, not knowing whither, avoiding the recesses of the woods, and  endeavouring to keep along their margin, till a rude kind of avenue,  which opened upon a moon-light spot, arrested her attention. The  wildness of this avenue brought to her recollection the one leading to  the turreted chateau, and she was inclined to believe, that this was a  part of the same domain, and probably led to the same point. While she  hesitated, whether to follow it or not, a sound of many voices in loud  merriment burst upon her ear. It seemed not the laugh of cheerfulness,  but of riot, and she stood appalled. While she paused, she heard a  distant voice, calling from the way she had come, and not doubting but  it was that of Michael, her first impulse was to hasten back; but a  second thought changed her purpose; she believed that nothing less than  the last extremity could have prevailed with Michael to quit his mules,  and fearing that her father was now dying, she rushed forward, with a  feeble hope of obtaining assistance from the people in the woods. Her  heart beat with fearful expectation, as she drew near the spot whence  the voices issued, and she often startled when her steps disturbed the  fallen leaves. The sounds led her towards the moon-light glade she had  before noticed; at a little distance from which she stopped, and saw,  between the boles of the trees, a small circular level of green turf,  surrounded by the woods, on which appeared a group of figures. On  drawing nearer, she distinguished these, by their dress, to be peasants,  and perceived several cottages scattered round the edge of the woods,  which waved loftily over this spot. While she gazed, and endeavoured  to overcome the apprehensions that withheld her steps, several peasant  girls came out of a cottage; music instantly struck up, and the dance  began. It was the joyous music of the vintage! the same she had before  heard upon the air. Her heart, occupied with terror for her father,  could not feel the contrast, which this gay scene offered to her own  distress; she stepped hastily forward towards a group of elder peasants,  who were seated at the door of a cottage, and, having explained her  situation, entreated their assistance. Several of them rose with  alacrity, and, offering any service in their power, followed Emily, who  seemed to move on the wind, as fast as they could towards the road.    When she reached the carriage she found St. Aubert restored to  animation. On the recovery of his senses, having heard from Michael  whither his daughter was gone, anxiety for her overcame every regard for  himself, and he had sent him in search of her. He was, however, still  languid, and, perceiving himself unable to travel much farther, he  renewed his enquiries for an inn, and concerning the chateau in the  woods. 'The chateau cannot accommodate you, sir,' said a venerable  peasant who had followed Emily from the woods, 'it is scarcely  inhabited; but, if you will do me the honour to visit my cottage, you  shall be welcome to the best bed it affords.'    St. Aubert was himself a Frenchman; he therefore was not surprised at  French courtesy; but, ill as he was, he felt the value of the offer  enhanced by the manner which accompanied it. He had too much delicacy  to apologize, or to appear to hesitate about availing himself of  the peasant's hospitality, but immediately accepted it with the same  frankness with which it was offered.    The carriage again moved slowly on; Michael following the peasants up  the lane, which Emily had just quitted, till they came to the moon-light  glade. St. Aubert's spirits were so far restored by the courtesy of  his host, and the near prospect of repose, that he looked with a sweet  complacency upon the moon-light scene, surrounded by the shadowy  woods, through which, here and there, an opening admitted the streaming  splendour, discovering a cottage, or a sparkling rivulet. He listened,  with no painful emotion, to the merry notes of the guitar and tamborine;  and, though tears came to his eyes, when he saw the debonnaire dance of  the peasants, they were not merely tears of mournful regret. With Emily  it was otherwise; immediate terror for her father had now subsided into  a gentle melancholy, which every note of joy, by awakening comparison,  served to heighten.    The dance ceased on the approach of the carriage, which was a phenomenon  in these sequestered woods, and the peasantry flocked round it with  eager curiosity. On learning that it brought a sick stranger, several  girls ran across the turf, and returned with wine and baskets of grapes,  which they presented to the travellers, each with kind contention  pressing for a preference. At length, the carriage stopped at a neat  cottage, and his venerable conductor, having assisted St. Aubert to  alight, led him and Emily to a small inner room, illuminated only by  moon-beams, which the open casement "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32706"],[0,"Triplanetary (#17)"],[1,"girls, and the number of people who heard your dumb stooge give  you away, you won't dare to. In fact, I told some of my people that you  wouldn't; that you are a smart enough operator to keep your nose clean.\"    \"You _told_ them!\" Black shouted, in anger and dismay.    \"Yes? Why not?\" The words were innocent enough, but Kinnison's  expression was full of meaning. \"I don't want to seem trite, but you are  just beginning to find out that honesty and loyalty are a hell of a hard  team to beat.\"    \"Get out! Take these termination papers and GET OUT!\"    And Doctor Ralph K. Kinnison, head high, strode out of President Black's  office and out of Entwhistle Ordnance Plant.          CHAPTER 6    19--?      \"Theodore K. Kinnison!\" a crisp, clear voice snapped from the speaker of  an apparently cold, ordinary-enough-looking radio-television set.    A burly young man caught his breath sharply as he leaped to the  instrument and pressed an inconspicuous button.    \"Theodore K. Kinnison acknowledging!\" The plate remained dark, but he  knew that he was being scanned.    \"Operation Bullfinch!\" the speaker blatted.    Kinnison gulped. \"Operation Bullfinch--Off!\" he managed to say.    \"Off!\"    He pushed the button again and turned to face the tall, trim  honey-blonde who stood tensely poised in the archway. Her eyes were wide  and protesting; both hands clutched at her throat.    \"Uh-huh, sweets, they're coming--over the Pole,\" he gritted. \"Two hours,  more or less.\"    \"Oh, Ted!\" She threw herself into his arms. They kissed, then broke  away.    The man picked up two large suitcases, already packed--everything else,  including food and water, had been in the car for weeks--and made  strides. The girl rushed after him, not bothering even to close the door  of the apartment, scooping up _en passant_ a leggy boy of four and a  chubby, curly-haired girl of two or thereabouts. They ran across the  lawn toward a big, low-slung sedan.    \"Sure you got your caffeine tablets?\" he demanded as they ran.    \"Uh-huh.\"    \"You'll need 'em. Drive like the devil--_stay ahead_! You can--this heap  has got the legs of a centipede and you've got plenty of gas and oil.  Eleven hundred miles from anywhere and a population of one-tenth per  square mile--you'll be safe there if anybody is.\"    \"It isn't us I'm worried about--it's you!\" she panted. \"Technos' wives  get a few minutes' notice ahead of the H-blast--I'll be ahead of the  rush and I'll stay ahead. It's you, Ted--_you_!\"    \"Don't worry, keed. That popcycle of mine has got legs, too, and there  won't be so much traffic, the way I'm going.\"    \"Oh, blast! I didn't mean that, and you know it!\"    They were at the car. While he jammed the two bags into an  exactly-fitting space, she tossed the children into the front seat, slid  lithely under the wheel, and started the engine.    \"I know you didn't, sweetheart. I'll be back.\" He kissed her and the  little girl, the while shaking hands with his son. \"Kidlets, you and  mother are going out to visit Grand-dad Kinnison, like we told you all  about. Lots of fun. I'll be along later. Now, Lady Lead-Foot, scram--and  shovel on the coal!\"    The heavy vehicle backed and swung; gravel flew as the accelerator-pedal  hit the floor.    Kinnison galloped across the alley and opened the door of a small  garage, revealing a long, squat motorcycle. Two deft passes of his hands  and two of his three spotlights were no longer white--one flashed a  brilliant purple, the other a searing blue. He dropped a perforated  metal box into a hanger and flipped a switch--a peculiarly-toned siren  began its ululating shriek. He took the alley turn at an angle of  forty-five degrees; burned the pavement toward Diversey.    The light was red. No matter--everybody had stopped--that siren could be  heard for miles. He barreled into the intersection; his step-plate  ground the concrete as he made a screaming left turn.    A siren--creeping up from behind. City tone. Two red spots--city cop--so  soon--good! He cut his gun a trifle, the other bike came alongside.    \"Is this IT?\" the uniformed rider yelled, over the coughing thunder of  the competing exhausts.    \"Yes!\" Kinnison yelled back. \"Clear Diversey to the Outer Drive, and the  Drive south to Gary and north to Waukegan. Snap it up!\"    The white-and-black motorcycle slowed; shot over toward the curb. The  officer reached for his microphone.    Kinnison sped on. At Cicero Avenue, although he had a green light,  traffic was so heavy that he had to slow down; at Pulaski two policemen  waved him through a red. Beyond Sacramento nothing moved on wheels.    Seventy ... seventy five ... he took the bridge at eighty, both wheels  in air for forty feet. Eighty five ... ninety ... that was about all he  could do and keep the heap on so rough a road. Also, he did not have  Diversey all to himself any more; blue-and-purple-flashing bikes were  coming in from every side-street. He slowed to a conservative fifty and  went into close formation with the other riders.    The H-blast--the city-wide warning for the planned and supposedly  orderly evacuation of all Chicago--sounded, but Kinnison did not hear  it.    Across the Park, edging over to the left so that the boys going south  would have room to make the turn--even such riders as those need _some_  room to make a turn at fifty miles per hour!    Under the viaduct--biting brakes and squealing tires at that sharp,  narrow, right-angle left turn--north on the wide, smooth Drive!    That highway was made for speed. So were those machines. Each rider, as  he got into the flat, lay down along his tank, tucked his chin behind  the cross-bar, and twisted both throttles out against their stops. They  were in a hurry. They had a long way to go; and if they did not get  there in time to stop those trans-polar atomic missiles, all hell would  be out for noon.    Why was all this necessary? This organization, this haste, this  split-second timing, this city-wide exhibition of insane hippodrome  riding? Why were not all these motorcycle-racers stationed permanently  at their posts, so as to be ready for any emergency? Because America,  being a democracy, could not strike first, but had to wait--wait in  instant readiness--until she was actually attacked. Because every good  Techno in America had his assigned place in some American Defense Plan;  of which Operation Bullfinch was only one. Because, without the presence  of those Technos at their every-day jobs, all ordinary technological  work in America would perforce have stopped.    A branch road curved away to the right. Scarcely slowing down, Kinnison  bulleted into the turn and through an open, heavily-guarded gate. Here  his mount and his lights were passwords enough: the real test would come  later. He approached a towering structure of alloy--jammed on his  brakes--stopped beside a soldier who, as soon as Kinnison jumped off,  mounted the motorcycle and drove it away.    Kinnison dashed up to an apparently blank wall, turned his back upon  four commissioned officers holding cocked forty-fives at the ready, and  fitted his right eye into a cup. Unlike fingerprints, retinal patterns  cannot be imitated, duplicated, or altered; any imposter would have died  instantly, without arrest or question. For every man who belonged  aboard that rocket had been checked and tested--_how_ he had been  checked and tested!--since one spy, in any one of those Technos' chairs,  could wreak damage untellable.    The port snapped open. Kinnison climbed a ladder into the large, but  crowded, Operations Room.    \"Hi, Teddy!\" a yell arose.    \"Hi, Walt! Hi-ya, Red! What-ho, Baldy!\" and so on. These men were  friends of old.    \"Where are they?\" he demanded. \"Is our stuff getting away? Lemme take a  peek at the Ball!\"    \"I'll say it is! O.K., Ted, squeeze in here!\"    He squeezed in. It was not a ball, but a hemisphere, slightly oblate and  centered approximately by the North Pole. A multitude of red dots moved  slowly--a hundred miles upon that map was a small distance--northward  over Canada; a closer-packed, less numerous group of yellowish-greens,  already on the American side of the Pole, was coming south.    As had been expected, the Americans had more missiles than did the  enemy. The other belief, that America had more adequate defenses and  better-trained, more highly skilled defenders, would soon be put to  test.    A string of blue lights blazed across the continent, from Nome through  Skagway and Wallaston and Churchill and Kaniapiskau to Belle Isle;  America's First Line of Defense. Regulars all. Ambers almost blanketed  those blues; their combat rockets were already grabbing altitude. The  Second Line, from Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver across to Halifax,  also showed solid green, with some flashes of amber. Part Regulars; part  National Guard.    Chicago was in the Third Line, all National Guard, extending from San  Francisco to New York. Green--alert and operating. So were the Fourth,  the Fifth, and the Sixth. Operation Bullfinch was clicking; on schedule  to the second.    A bell clanged; the men sprang to their stations and strapped down.  Every chair was occupied. Combat Rocket Number One Oh Six Eight Five,  full-powered by the disintegrating nuclei of unstable isotopes, took off  with a whooshing roar which even her thick walls could not mute.    The Technos, crushed down into their form-fitting cushions by three G's  of acceleration, clenched their teeth and took it.    Higher! Faster! The rocket shivered and trembled as it hit the wall at  the velocity of sound, but it did not pause.    Higher! Faster! Higher! Fifty miles high. One hundred ... five hundred  ... a thousand ... fifteen hundred ... two thousand! Half a radius--the  designated altitude at which the Chicago Contingent would go into  action.    Acceleration was cut to zero. The Technos, breathing deeply in relief,  donned peculiarly-goggled helmets and set up their"]]]
