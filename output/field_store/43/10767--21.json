It  is _urgent_ to set him free to-day, this very evening, at eight  o'clock!--_urgent!_\" And Baisemeaux, shrugging his shoulders with an air  of supreme disdain, flung the order on the table and began eating again.    \"They are fond of these tricks!\" he said, with his mouth full; \"they  seize a man, some fine day, keep him under lock and key for ten years,  and write to you, 'Watch this fellow well,' or 'Keep him very strictly.'  And then, as soon as you are accustomed to look upon the prisoner as a  dangerous man, all of a sudden, without rhyme or reason they write--'Set  him at liberty,' and actually add to their missive--'urgent.' You will  own, my lord, 'tis enough to make a man at dinner shrug his shoulders!\"    \"What do you expect? It is for them to write,\" said Aramis, \"for you to  execute the order.\"    \"Good! good! execute it! Oh, patience! You must not imagine that I am a  slave.\"    \"Gracious Heaven! my very good M. Baisemeaux, who ever said so? Your  independence is well known.\"    \"Thank Heaven!\"    \"But your goodness of heart is also known.\"    \"Ah! don't speak of it!\"    \"And your obedience to your superiors. Once a soldier, you see,  Baisemeaux, always a soldier.\"    \"And I shall directly obey; and to-morrow morning, at daybreak, the  prisoner referred to shall be set free.\"    \"To-morrow?\"    \"At dawn.\"    \"Why not this evening, seeing that the _lettre de cachet_ bears, both on  the direction and inside, '_urgent_'?\"    \"Because this evening we are at supper, and our affairs are urgent,  too!\"    \"Dear Baisemeaux, booted though I be, I feel myself a priest, and  charity has higher claims upon me than hunger and thirst. This  unfortunate man has suffered long enough, since you have just told me  that he has been your prisoner these ten years. Abridge his suffering.  His good time has come; give him the benefit quickly. God will repay you  in Paradise with years of felicity.\"    \"You wish it?\"    \"I entreat you.\"    \"What! in the very middle of our repast?\"    \"I implore you; such an action is worth ten Benedicites.\"    \"It shall be as you desire, only our supper will get cold.\"    \"Oh! never heed that.\"    Baisemeaux leaned back to ring for Francois, and by a very natural  motion turned round towards the door. The order had remained on the  table; Aramis seized the opportunity when Baisemeaux was not looking to  change the paper for another, folded in the same manner, which he drew  swiftly from his pocket. \"Francois,\" said the governor, \"let the major  come up here with the turnkeys of the Bertaudiere.\" Francois bowed and  quitted the room, leaving the two companions alone.        Chapter VIII. The General of the Order.    There was now a brief silence, during which Aramis never removed his  eyes from Baisemeaux for a moment. The latter seemed only half decided  to disturb himself thus in the middle of supper, and it was clear he was  trying to invent some pretext, whether good or bad, for delay, at any  rate till after dessert. And it appeared also that he had hit upon an  excuse at last.    \"Eh! but it is impossible!\" he cried.    \"How impossible?\" said Aramis. \"Give me a glimpse of this  impossibility.\"    \"'Tis impossible to set a prisoner at liberty at such an hour. Where can  he go to, a man so unacquainted with Paris?\"    \"He will find a place wherever he can.\"    \"You see, now, one might as well set a blind man free!\"    \"I have a carriage, and will take him wherever he wishes.\"    \"You have an answer for everything. Francois, tell monsieur le major to  go and open the cell of M. Seldon, No. 3, Bertaudiere.\"    \"Seldon!\" exclaimed Aramis, very naturally. \"You said Seldon, I think?\"    \"I said Seldon, of course. 'Tis the name of the man they set free.\"    \"Oh! you mean to say Marchiali?\" said Aramis.    \"Marchiali? oh! yes, indeed. No, no, Seldon.\"    \"I think you are making a mistake, Monsieur Baisemeaux.\"    \"I have read the order.\"    \"And I also.\"    \"And I saw 'Seldon' in letters as large as that,\" and Baisemeaux held up  his finger.    \"And I read 'Marchiali' in characters as large as this,\" said Aramis,  also holding up two fingers.    \"To the proof; let us throw a light on the matter,\" said Baisemeaux,  confident he was right. \"There is the paper, you have only to read it.\"    \"I read 'Marchiali,'\" returned Aramis, spreading out the paper. \"Look.\"    Baisemeaux looked, and his arms dropped suddenly. \"Yes, yes,\" he said,  quite overwhelmed; \"yes, Marchiali. 'Tis plainly written Marchiali!  Quite true!\"    \"Ah!--\"    \"How? the man of whom we have talked so much? The man whom they are  every day telling me to take such care of?\"    \"There is 'Marchiali,'\" repeated the inflexible Aramis.    \"I must own it, monseigneur. But I understand nothing about it.\"    \"You believe your eyes, at any rate.\"    \"To tell me very plainly there is 'Marchiali.'\"    \"And in a good handwriting, too.\"    \"'Tis a wonder! I still see this order and the name of Seldon, Irishman.  I see it. Ah! I even recollect that under this name there was a blot of  ink.\"    \"No, there is no ink; no, there is no blot.\"    \"Oh! but there was, though; I know it, because I rubbed my finger--this  very one--in the powder that was over the blot.\"    \"In a word, be it how it may, dear M. Baisemeaux,\" said Aramis, \"and  whatever you may have seen, the order is signed to release Marchiali,  blot or no blot.\"    \"The order is signed to release Marchiali,\" replied Baisemeaux,  mechanically, endeavoring to regain his courage.    \"And you are going to release this prisoner. If your heart dictates you  to deliver Seldon also, I declare to you I will not oppose it the least  in the world.\" Aramis accompanied this remark with a smile, the irony of  which effectually dispelled Baisemeaux's confusion of mind, and restored  his courage.    \"Monseigneur,\" he said, \"this Marchiali is the very same prisoner whom  the other day a priest confessor of _our order_ came to visit in so  imperious and so secret a manner.\"    \"I don't know that, monsieur,\" replied the bishop.    \"'Tis no such long time ago, dear Monsieur d'Herblay.\"    \"It is true. But _with us_, monsieur, it is good that the man of to-day  should no longer know what the man of yesterday did.\"    \"In any case,\" said Baisemeaux, \"the visit of the Jesuit confessor must  have given happiness to this man.\"    Aramis made no reply, but recommenced eating and drinking. As for  Baisemeaux, no longer touching anything that was on the table, he again  took up the order and examined it every way. This investigation, under  ordinary circumstances, would have made the ears of the impatient Aramis  burn with anger; but the bishop of Vannes did not become incensed for  so little, above all, when he had murmured to himself that to do so was  dangerous. \"Are you going to release Marchiali?\" he said. \"What mellow,  fragrant and delicious sherry this is, my dear governor.\"    \"Monseigneur,\" replied Baisemeaux, \"I shall release the prisoner  Marchiali when I have summoned the courier who brought the order, and  above all, when, by interrogating him, I have satisfied myself.\"    \"The order is sealed, and the courier is ignorant of the contents. What  do you want to satisfy yourself about?\"    \"Be it so, monseigneur; but I shall send to the ministry, and M. de  Lyonne will either confirm or withdraw the order.\"    \"What is the good of all that?\" asked Aramis, coldly.    \"What good?\"    \"Yes; what is your object, I ask?\"    \"The object of never deceiving oneself, monseigneur; nor being wanting  in the respect which a subaltern owes to his superior officers, nor  infringing the duties of a service one has accepted of one's own free  will.\"    \"Very good; you have just spoken so eloquently, that I cannot but admire  you. It is true that a subaltern owes respect to his superiors; he  is guilty when he deceives himself, and he should be punished if he  infringed either the duties or laws of his office.\"    Baisemeaux looked at the bishop with astonishment.    \"It follows,\" pursued Aramis, \"that you are going to ask advice, to put  your conscience at ease in the matter?\"    \"Yes, monseigneur.\"    \"And if a superior officer gives you orders, you will obey?\"    \"Never doubt it, monseigneur.\"    \"You know the king's signature well, M. de Baisemeaux?\"    \"Yes, monseigneur.\"    \"Is it not on this order of release?\"    \"It is true, but it may--\"    \"Be forged, you mean?\"    \"That is evident, monseigneur.\"    \"You are right. And that of M. de Lyonne?\"    \"I see it plain enough on the order; but for the same reason that the  king's signature may have been forged, so also, and with even greater  probability, may M. de Lyonne's.\"    \"Your logic has the stride of a giant, M. de Baisemeaux,\" said Aramis;  \"and your reasoning is irresistible. But on what special grounds do you  base your idea that these signatures are false?\"    \"On this: the absence of counter-signatures. Nothing checks his  majesty's signature; and M. de Lyonne is not there to tell me he has  signed.\"    \"Well, Monsieur de Baisemeaux,\" said Aramis, bending an eagle glance on  the governor, \"I adopt so frankly your doubts, and your mode of clearing  them up, that I will take a pen, if you will give me one.\"    Baisemeaux gave him a pen.    \"And a sheet of white paper,\" added Aramis.    Baisemeaux handed him some paper.    \"Now, I--I, also--I, here present--incontestably, I--am going to write  an order to which I am certain you will give credence, incredulous as  you are!\"    Baisemeaux turned pale at this icy assurance of manner. It seemed to  him that the voice of the bishop's, but just now so playful and gay, had  become funereal and sad; that the wax lights changed into the tapers of  a mortuary chapel, the very glasses of wine into chalices of blood.    Aramis took a pen and wrote. Baisemeaux, in terror, read over his  shoulder.    \"A. M. D. G.,\" wrote the bishop; and he drew a cross under these four"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27600"],[0,"Zoonomia; Or, the Laws of Organic Life, Vol. II (#17)"],[1,"set of teeth, and the ends of exfoliating bones, and sometimes the  matter of chalk-stones in the gout, the coagulable lymph, which is  deposited on the lungs, or on the muscles after inflammation of those  parts, and which frequently produces difficulty of breathing, and the pains  of chronic rheumatism, and lastly the earthy part of the living bones are  dissolved and absorbed by the increased actions of this system of vessels.  See Sect. XXXIII. 3. 1.    The earthy part of bones in this disease of the innutrition of them seems  to suffer a solution, and reabsorption; while the secerning vessels do not  supply a sufficient quantity of calcareous earth and phosphoric acid, which  constitute the substance of bones. As calcareous earth abounds every where,  is the want of phosphoric acid the remote cause? One cause of this malady  is given in the Philosophic Transactions, where the patient had been  accustomed to drink large quantities of vinegar. Two cases are described by  Mr. Gouch. In one case, which I saw, a considerable quantity of calcareous  earth, and afterwards of bone-ashes, and of decoction of madder, and also  of sublimate of mercury, were given without effect. All the bones became  soft, many of them broke, and the patient seemed to die from the want of  being able to distend her chest owing to the softness of the ribs.    M. M. Salt of urine, called sal microcosmicum, phosphorated soda. Calcined  hartshorn. Bone-ashes. Hard or petrifying water, as that of Matlock, or  such as is found in all limestone or marly countries. The calcareous earth  in these waters might possibly be carried to the bones, as madder is known  to colour them. Warm bath. Volatile or fixed alcali as a lotion on the  spine, or essential oils.    The innutrition of the bones is often first to be perceived by the  difficulty of breathing and palpitation of the heart on walking a little  faster than usual, which I suppose is owing to the softness of the ends of  the ribs adjoining to the sternum; on which account they do not perfectly  distend the chest, when they are raised by the pectoral and intercostal  muscles with greater force than usual. After this the spine becomes curved  both by the softness of its vertebrae, and for the purpose of making room  for the disturbed heart. See Species 16 of this genus.    As these patients are pale and weak, there would seem to be a deficiency of  oxygene in their blood, and in consequence a deficiency of phosphoric acid;  which is probably produced by oxygene in the act of respiration.    Mr. Bonhome in the Chemical Annals, August, 1793, supposes the rickets to  arise from the prevalence of vegetable or acetous acid, which is known to  soften bones out of the body. Mr. Dettaen seems to have espoused a similar  opinion, and both of them in consequence give alcalies and testacea. If  this theory was just, the soft bones of such patients should shew evident  marks of such acidity after death; which I believe has not been observed.  Nor is it analogous to other animal facts, that nutritious fluids secreted  by the finest vessels of the body should be so little animalized, as to  retain acetous or vegetable acidity.    The success attending the following case in so short a time as a fortnight  I ascribed principally to the use of the warm bath; in which the patient  continued for full half an hour every night, in the degree of heat, which  was most grateful to her sensation, which might be I suppose about 94. Miss  ----, about ten years of age, and very tall and thin, has laboured under  palpitation of her heart, and difficult breathing on the least exercise,  with occasional violent dry cough, for a year or more, with dry lips,  little appetite either for food or drink, and dry skin, with cold  extremities. She has at times been occasionally worse, and been relieved in  some degree by the bark. She began to bend forwards, and to lift up her  shoulders. The former seemed owing to a beginning curvature of the spine,  the latter was probably caused to facilitate her difficult respiration.    M. M. She used the warm bath, as above related; which by its warmth might  increase the irritability of the smallest series of vessels, and by  supplying more moisture to the blood might probably tend to carry further  the materials, which form calcareous or bony particles, or to convey them  in more dilute solution. She took twice a day twenty grains of extract of  bark, twenty grains of soda phosphorata, and ten grams of chalk, and ten of  calcined hartshorn mixed into a powder with ten drops of laudanum; with  flesh food both to dinner and supper; and port wine and water instead of  the small beer, she had been accustomed to; she lay on a sofa frequently in  a day, and occasionally used a neck-swing.    15. _Rachitis._ Rickets. The head is large, protuberant chiefly on the  forepart. The smaller joints are swelled; the ribs depressed; the belly  tumid, with other parts emaciated. This disease from the innutrition or  softness of the bones arose about two centuries ago; seems to have been  half a century in an increasing or spreading state; continued about half a  century at its height, or greatest diffusion; and is now nearly vanished:  which gives reason to hope, that the small-pox, measles, and venereal  disease, which are all of modern production, and have already become  milder, may in process of time vanish from the earth, and perhaps be  succeeded by new ones! See the preceding species.    16. _Spinae distortio._ Distortion of the spine is another disease  originating from the innutrition or softness of the bones. I once saw a  child about six years old with palpitation of heart, and quickness of  respiration, which began to have a curvature of the spine; I then doubted,  whether the palpitation and quick respiration were the cause or consequence  of the curvature of the spine; suspecting either that nature had bent the  spine outwards to give room to the enlarged heart; or that the malformation  of the chest had compressed and impeded the movements of the heart. But a  few weeks ago on attending a young lady about ten years old, whose spine  had lately began to be distorted, with very great difficulty and quickness  of respiration, and alarming palpitation of the heart, I convinced myself,  that the palpitation and difficult respiration were the effect of the  change of the cavity of the chest from the distortion of the spine; and  that the whole was therefore a disease of the innutrition or softness of  the bones.    For on directing her to lie down much in the day, and to take the bark, the  distortion became less, and the palpitation and quick respiration became  less at the same time. After this observation a neck-swing was directed,  and she took the bark, madder, and bone-ashes; and she continues to amend  both in her shape and health.    Delicate young ladies are very liable to become awry at many boarding  schools. This is occasioned principally by their being obliged too long to  preserve an erect attitude, by sitting on forms many hours together. To  prevent this the school-seats should have either backs, on which they may  occasionally rest themselves; or desks before them, on which they may  occasionally lean. This is a thing of greater consequence than may appear  to those, who have not attended to it.    When the least tendency to become awry is observed, they should be advised  to lie down on a bed or sofa for an hour in the middle of the day for many  months; which generally prevents the increase of this deformity by taking  off for a time the pressure on the spine of the back, and it at the same  time tends to make them grow taller. Young persons, when nicely measured,  are found to be half an inch higher in a morning than at night; as is well  known to those, who inlist very young men for soldiers. This is owing to  the cartilages between the bones of the back becoming compressed by the  weight of the head and shoulders on them during the day. It is the same  pressure which produces curvatures and distortions of the spine in growing  children, where the bones are softer than usual; and which may thus be  relieved by an horizontal posture for an hour in the middle of the day, or  by being frequently allowed to lean on a chair, or to play on the ground on  a carpet.    Young ladies should also be directed, where two sleep in a bed, to change  every night, or every week, their sides of the bed; which will prevent  their tendency to sleep always on the same side; which is not only liable  to produce crookedness, but also to occasion diseases by the internal parts  being so long kept in uniform contact as to grow together. For the same  reason they should not be allowed to sit always on the same side of the  fire or window, because they will then be inclined too frequently to bend  themselves to one side.    Another great cause of injury to the shape of young ladies is from the  pressure of stays, or other tight bandages, which at the same time cause  other diseases by changing the form or situation of the internal parts. If  a hard part of the stays, even a knot of the thread, with which they are  sewed together, is pressed hard upon one side more than the other, the  child bends from the side most painful, and thus occasions a curvature of  the spine. To counteract this effect such stays, as have fewest hard parts,  and especially such as can be daily or weekly turned, are preferable to  others.    [Illustration]    Where frequent lying down on a sofa in the day-time, and swinging  frequently for a short time by the hands or head, with loose dress, do not  relieve a beginning distortion of the back; recourse may be had to a chair  with stuffed moveable arms for the purpose of suspending the weight of the  body by cushions under the arm-pits, like resting on crutches, or like the  leading strings of infants. From the top of the back of the same chair a  curved steel bar may also "]]]
