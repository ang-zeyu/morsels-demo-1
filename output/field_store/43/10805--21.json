[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29031"],[0,"Sir William Herschel: His Life and Works (#17)"],[1," I      constantly inspected and directed every person's labor; though      sometimes there were not less than forty different workmen employed      at the same time. While the stand of the telescope was preparing, I      also began the construction of the great mirror, of which I      inspected the casting, grinding, and polishing, and the work was in      this manner carried on with no other interruption than that      occasioned by the removal of all the apparatus and materials from      where I then lived, to my present situation at Slough.        \"Here, soon after my arrival, I began to lay the foundation upon      which by degrees the whole structure was raised as it now stands,      and the speculum being highly polished and put into the tube, I had      the first view through it on February 19, 1787. I do not, however,      date the completing of the instrument till much later. For the first      speculum, by a mismanagement of the person who cast it, came out      thinner on the centre of the back than was intended, and on account      of its weakness would not permit a good figure to be given to it.        \"A second mirror was cast January 26, 1788, but it cracked in      cooling. February 16 we recast it, and it proved to be of a proper      degree of strength. October 24 it was brought to a pretty good      figure and polish, and I observed the planet _Saturn_ with it. But      not being satisfied, I continued to work upon it till August 27,      1789, when it was tried upon the fixed stars, and I found it to give      a pretty sharp image. Large stars were a little affected with      scattered light, owing to many remaining scratches on the mirror.      August the 28th, 1789, having brought the telescope to the parallel      of _Saturn_, I discovered a _sixth_ satellite of that planet, and      also saw the spots upon _Saturn_ better than I had ever seen them      before, so that I may date the finishing of the forty-foot telescope      from that time.\"    Another satellite of _Saturn_ was discovered with the forty-foot on the  17th of September (1789). It was used for various observations so late  as 1811. On January 19, of that year, HERSCHEL observed the nebula of  _Orion_ with it. This was one of his last observations.    The final disposition of the telescope is told in the following extract  from a letter of Sir JOHN HERSCHEL'S to Mr. WELD, Secretary of the Royal  Society:                                           \"COLLINGWOOD, _March 13, 1847_.        . . . \"In reply to your queries, respecting the forty-foot      reflecting telescope constructed by my father, I have to state that      King GEORGE III. munificently defrayed the _entire_ cost of that      instrument (including, of course, all preparatory cost in the nature      of construction of tools, and of the apparatus for casting, grinding,      and figuring the reflectors, of which two were constructed), at a      total cost of L4,000. The woodwork of the telescope being so far      decayed as to be dangerous, in the year 1839 I pulled it down, and      piers were erected on which the tube was placed, _that_ being of      iron and so well preserved, that, although not more than      one-twentieth of an inch thick, when in the horizontal position it      sustained within it all my family, and continues to sustain inclosed      within it, to this day, not only the heavier of the two reflectors,      but also all the more important portions of the machinery. . . .      The mirror and the rest of the polishing apparatus are on the      premises. The iron grinding tools and polishers are placed      underneath the tube, let into the ground, and level with the surface      of the gravelled area in which it stands.\". . .    The closing of the tube was done with appropriate ceremony on  New-Year's-Day, 1840, when, after a procession through it by the family  at Slough, a poem, written by Sir JOHN, was read, the machinery put into  its present position, and the tube sealed.    The memoir on the forty-foot telescope shows throughout that HERSCHEL'S  prime object was not the making of the telescope itself, but that his  mind was constantly directed towards the uses to which it was to be  put--towards the questions which he wished it to answer.    Again and again, in his various papers, he returns to the question of  the _limit of vision_. As BESSEL has said:        \"The naked eye has its limit of vision in the stars of the sixth      magnitude. The light of fainter stars than these does not affect the      retina enough for them to be seen. A very small telescope penetrates      to smaller, and, in general, without doubt, to more distant stars.      A more powerful one penetrates deeper into space, and as its power is      increased, so the boundaries of the visible universe are widened,      and the number of stars increased to millions and millions. Whoever      has followed the history of the series of HERSCHEL'S telescopes will      have observed this. But HERSCHEL was not content with the bare fact,      but strove ever to know _how far_ a telescope of a certain      construction and size could penetrate, compared with the naked and      unassisted eye. These investigations were never for the discovery of      new facts concerning the working of his instruments; it was for the      knowledge of the distribution of the fixed stars in space itself      that he strove. . . . HERSCHEL'S instruments were designed to aid      vision to the last extent. They were only secondarily for the taking      of measures. His efforts were not for a knowledge of the _motions_,      but of the _constitution_ and _construction_ of the heavenly      bodies.\"    Besides the stands for his telescopes, which were both ingenious and  convenient, HERSCHEL devised many forms of apparatus for facilitating  the art of observation. His micrometers for measuring position angles,  his lamp micrometer, the method of limiting apertures, and the methods  he used for viewing the sun may be mentioned among these.    Points in practical astronomy are considered all through the years of  observation. A reference to his original papers will show how numerous,  how varied, and how valuable these are. I cannot forbear quoting here  the account of a precaution observed during his examination of the belts  on _Saturn_ (1794).    It is the most striking example of how fully HERSCHEL realized that the  eye of the observer is a material part of the optical apparatus of  astronomy. Simple as this principle may appear, it was an absolute  novelty in his day.    In making these observations, he says:        \"I took care to bend my head so as to receive the picture of the      belt in the same direction as I did formerly. This was a precaution      that occurred to me, as there was a possibility that the vertical      diameter of the retina might be more or less sensitive than the      horizontal one.\"    Astronomers will recognize in this the first suggestion of the processes  which have led to important results in the hands of Dr. OTTO STRUVE and  others in the comparison of the measures of double stars by different  observers, each of whom has a personal habit of observation, which, if  not corrected, may affect his results in the way which HERSCHEL was  striving to avoid.                 _Researches on the Relative Brightness of the                       Stars: Variable Stars._    No research of HERSCHEL'S was more laborious than the elaborate  classification of the stars according to their comparative brightness,  which he executed during the years 1796 to 1799. It was directly in the  line of his main work--to find out the construction of the heavens.    His first paper had been upon the variable star _Mira Ceti_. Here was a  sun, shining by its native brightness, which waxed and waned like the  moon itself. This star is periodic. It is for a long period invisible to  the unassisted eye. Then it can just be seen, and increases in  brightness for a little over a month, and attains a maximum brilliancy.  From this it decreases for nearly three months, and after becoming  invisible, remains so for five or six months. Its whole period is about  333 days. Are all other stars constant in brightness? The example of  _Mira Ceti_ and of other known variables makes this at least doubtful.  But the sun itself may vary for all that we know. It is a simple star  like the rest.    This question of variability in general is an important one, then.  It can only be tested by making accurate catalogues of the relative  brilliance of stars at various times, and by comparing these. No such  general catalogue existed before HERSCHEL'S time, and led by the  discrepancies in isolated cases, which he found between his own  estimates and those of his predecessors, he made from observation a  series of four catalogues, in which were set down the order of sequence  of the stars of each constellation.    The method adopted by HERSCHEL was perfectly simple in principle, though  most laborious in practice. Suppose any number of stars, A, B, C, D, E,  . . . etc., near enough to each other to be well compared. The process  consists simply in writing down the names of the stars, A, B, C, etc.,  in the order of their relative brightness. Thus if for a group of eight  stars we have found at one epoch A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and if at  another time the order was A, B, C, D, F, E, G, H, symptoms of  variability are pointed out. Repeated observations, where the same star  is found in different sequences, will decide the question. Thus, for the  stars visible to the naked eye, we know exactly the state of the sky in  HERSCHEL'S day, now nearly a century ago. Any material change cannot  escape us. These catalogues have been singularly overlooked by the  observers of our generation who have followed this branch of  observation, and it was not till 1876 that they received proper  attention and a suitable reduction (at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29070"],[0,"Brighter Britain! (Volume 1 of 2) (#17)"],[1,"ularize, as each and all  have the same work to do, and live in exactly the same style. There is  brotherhood and equality among us, which is even extended to some who  would _not_ be called by that old-world title just alluded to, anywhere  at all. We do not recognize class distinctions here much. We take a man  as we find him; and if he is a good, hearty, honest fellow, that is  enough for us.    A good many of us come from the classes in England among whom manual  labour is considered low and degrading. That is, unless it is undertaken  solely for amusement. Out here we are navvies, day-labourers, mechanics,  artisans, anything. At home, we should have to uphold the family  position by grinding as clerks on a miserable pittance, or by toiling in  some equally sedentary and dull routine of life. If we attempted to  work there as we work here, we should be scouted and cut by all our  friends.    Out here we have our hardships, to be sure; we have got to learn what  roughing it really means. It is no child's play, that is certain. But  here, an industrious man is always getting nearer and nearer to a home  and a competence, won by his toil. Can every one in the old country, no  matter how industrious, say that of himself? Is it not too often the  poor-house, or the charity of friends, that is the only goal of  labouring-class and middle-class alike, in overcrowded Britain? Does  patient industry invariably lead to a better fortune for the declining  years in England? We know that it does here.    This is enough for one digression, though. Be it understood, then, that  we are not horny-handed sons of toil by birth. We were once called  gentlemen, according to the prevailing notions of that caste at home.  Here, the very air has dissolved all those ancient prejudices, and much  better do we feel for the change. Only occasionally does some amusing  instance of the old humbug crop up. I may light upon some such example  before I lay down my pen.    It is now some years since our shanty was built--seven or eight, I  suppose. The edifice certainly looks older. Not to put too fine a point  on it, one might candidly call it ruinous, rather than otherwise. This  is singular and surprising; we cannot account for it. Frame-houses in  this country ought to require no repairs for twenty years at least. That  is the received opinion. We dogmatically assert that the house we built  ourselves, with such infinite labour and trouble, is as good as any  other of its size and kind. Consequently, it will not want repairing for  twenty years. _But it does._ It looks as old as the hills, and seems to  be coming to pieces about us, though only eight years old. Nevertheless,  we will not forswear ourselves, we will _not_ repair our shanty till  twenty years are gone!    As for allowing that there could be any fault in our workmanship, that  our inexperienced joinery can have been the cause of the shanty's  premature decay, that, even Old Colonial says, is ridiculous. No, the  wood was unseasoned; or, perhaps, it was over-seasoned. We admit so  much, but our handicraft was certainly not to blame.    The imperfections of the shanty are many and grievous. The door and  windows have quarrelled desperately with their settings. On windy nights  we get no sleep, as every one is engaged trying to fasten and wedge them  into noiseless security. The door developed a most obstreperous and  noxious habit of being blown into the middle of the house during the  night, with much hideous clatter and clamour. We stopped that at last by  nailing it up altogether, and making a new entrance through the side of  the chimney-place.    Then, each particular board in the sides of the shanty has somehow  warped itself out of place. We are thus enabled to view the lovely  scenery lying round the place from our bunks, without the trouble of  rising and going to the window. Old Colonial says that free ventilation  is one of the great blessings of life. He thinks that the chinks in our  walls are absolutely a provision of Nature, since, he says, we would  certainly be choked with smoke if there were none.    Sometimes the cattle, feeding on the clearings round the shanty, come  and thrust their noses through the gaps in the boards, or stand and eye  us as we are taking our meals. The Saint says he has invited them to  breakfast with us, on the first of April next, by which time he expects  that the chinks will have gaped wide enough to permit of the passage of  cattle.    Of course, the smoke of the fire will not go up the chimney as it ought,  but floats freely about the shanty. This is good for the bacon and hams,  when there are any, that depend from the rafters. It is also a wholesome  thing, says Old Colonial, and sweetens and preserves everything. \"None  of your gassy, sooty coal-smoke, but the fragrant vapours of the burning  forest!\" so he remarked one night, when we were all blinded and choked  by the volumes of smoke that rolled through the shanty. O'Gaygun is  often funny, but not always original. He says that the smoke floats  about our habitation because it never knows which hole it ought to go  out at!    On rainy nights--and that is nearly every night during some three months  of the year--there is perpetual misery in the shanty. One hears some  choice varieties of rhetorical flowers of speech; there is a continual  shifting about of beds; and often unseemly scuffling for drier places.  O'Gaygun says that he loves to \"astthronomise\" when lying comfortably in  bed; but he adds, that, \"a shower-bath is a quare place to sleep in.\"    It will be surmised from this that our roof is leaky. All roofs are  that, you know, in a greater or lesser degree, only ours in a greater,  perhaps. Those shingles _will_ come off. We are sure we put them on  properly and securely. The nails must have been some inferior rotten  quality, doubtless. Loose shingles lie about all around the shanty. They  come in useful as plates, as our crockery is generally short. In fact,  O'Gaygun prefers them to the usual article, and always goes outside to  pick up a plate for any stranger who may happen to drop in to lunch. To  use his words, \"They fall aff the shanty roof loike the laves aff the  tthrees!\"    Somehow or other all these things go unremedied. It would, of course, be  an admission that our work had been unsatisfactory, if we were to  earnestly set about repairing the shanty, and thereby formally allow  that it required such renovation. No one will dare to initiate such a  serious thing. Besides, it is no one man's particular business to begin  the work of mending; while we are always busy, and have acquired such an  amazing notion of the value of our time, that we consider the necessary  repairs would not be worth the time it would take us to effect them.    Moreover, Old Colonial is a bush-philosopher, and delivers himself of  moral orations in the shanty of nights. His views on some subjects are  peculiar, and they are always hurled at our heads with the utmost scorn  and contempt for all who may differ from them. This is his theory on  repairing--    \"We are pioneers; it is our special duty and purpose to make, to begin,  to originate. We inherit nothing; we are ourselves the commencement of a  future society, just as Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden. Our  whole time and labour must be given to the one purpose of hewing out  the new path. We cannot stop to repair our faults and failures. For _us_  that would be a waste of energy and of time. It is for those who inherit  the commencement we have made to do that; not for us, the pioneers. They  will improve our beginnings; we must continue onward. _Never mend  anything_, except your manners, boys! Put up with discomforts and  hardships, as pioneers should!\"    The furniture and internal arrangements of our shanty are more simple in  construction than elegant in appearance. We go in for utility, and not  for show. As a central feature is the table. It is our pride and glory,  that table, for it was made in Auckland, and imported by us from  Helensville. It is the one piece of furniture we possess that displays  an art superior to our own. Solid, strong and large, made of stout kauri  wood, it has borne a great deal of rough usage, and is capable of  bearing a great deal more.    Besides all the customary uses to which a table may be put, this article  of ours fulfils even another purpose. It comes in very handy sometimes  as a bedstead. I have known two men to sleep upon it on occasions; its  breadth being considerable. For a long time it went by the name of  O'Gaygun's four-poster, that gentleman having a predilection for  sleeping on it. He is a huge, bony Irishman, and somewhat restless in  his sleep. Accordingly, it was no unusual thing for him to roll off the  table in the night, and descend upon the floor with considerable uproar.  This was got over by inverting the table at night, and making him  recline on the inside of it, with the legs sticking up around him. He  does not like this position, though, for he says the rats run across him  all night.    Chairs we have none, except two curious contrivances belonging to the  Saint and the Little'un. We use empty kegs and boxes, sawn logs set up  on end, and the sides of our bunks, when we sit at table. When at our  ease and our tobacco, we either recline in our bunks, or sit on the edge  of the floor opening into the chimney-place.    The two curious contrivances alluded to are styled armchairs by their  manufacturers, and somewhat remarkable objects they are. The Saint's is  made out of the section of a cask set up on four legs. It possesses a  fifth leg, or outrigger at the back, and has cushions of flour-bags,  stuffed with turkey's feathers. The owner doubtless finds it to his  mind, but he has to guard against leaning to either side, or collapse is  always the consequence.    The other armchair is the Little'un's. Now, this young gentleman, though  the"]]]
