His  reputation as Union scout, guide for the Indian country, and sheriff of  frontier towns, our leader said, was a sufficient competency of fame to  justify his retirement upon it. In this opinion the public will  certainly coincide.    Buffalo Bill was to be our guide. He informed us that Wild Bill was his  cousin. Cody is spare and wiry in figure, admirably versed in plain  lore, and altogether the best guide I ever saw. The mysterious plain is  a book that he knows by heart. He crossed it twice as teamster, while a  mere boy, and has spent the greater part of his life on it since. He led  us over its surface on starless nights, when the shadow of the blackness  above hid our horses and the earth, and though many a time with no trail  to follow and on the very mid-ocean of the expanse, he never made a  failure. Buffalo Bill has since figured in one of Buntline's Indian  romances. We award him the credit of being a good scout and most  excellent guide; but the fact that he can slaughter buffalo is by no  means remarkable, since the American bison is dangerous game only to  amateurs.    We were off early on Tuesday morning for the Saline, our course toward  which lay before us a little west of north, the citizens turning out to  see us start. We had just parted from Gripe, who went East on the first  train to get his ribs healed. \"To think, gentlemen,\" said he, \"that I  should have escaped rebel bullets and Indian atrocities, only to have my  ribs cracked at last by a stampede of mules!\" Poor Gripe's farewell  reminded me strongly of the old saying about the ruling passion strong  in death. As he stood on the platform, with one hand against his aching  side, he could not refrain from waving a courtly adieu with the other,  and bowing himself from our presence, into the car, as if leaving the  stage after a political speech.    We were sorry to lose our friend, and this, together with the thought of  the weeks of uncertainties and anxieties which lay before us, made our  exit from Hays rather a solemn affair. Even Tammany Sachem's face was  ironed out so completely that not a smile wrinkled it. Dobeen had loaded  one wagon with culinary weapons, and now sat among his pots and pans,  evidently ill at ease and wishing himself doing any thing else rather  than about to plunge further into the wilderness.    When about to mount Cynocephalus, Semi's feelings were wounded by a  depraved urchin who suggested, \"You'd better fust knock that fly off,  Boss. Both on ye 'll be too much for the hoss!\" Fortunately, perhaps,  for our feelings, the remainder of the inhabitants were so civil that  further criticisms on our outfit, though they may have been ripe at  their tongues' end, were carefully repressed.    Moving out over the divide above town the Professor noticed the general  depression of the party, and forthwith began philosophising.    \"My friends,\" said he, \"had the feelings which explorers suffer, when  fairly launched, been allowed to be present during the days of  preparation, science and discovery would be in their infancy. Enthusiasm  bridges the first obstacles to an undertaking, but others roll on and  block the explorer's path, and the spirit which has got him into the  difficulty momentarily deserts him. If properly courted, however, she  returns, and meanwhile the traveler is afforded the opportunity of  looking, through matter-of-fact spectacles, along his future journey.  What he thought pebbles reveal themselves as hills, and what he had  marked on his chart as hills develop into mountains. These he must  recognize and examine with all the resolution he can summon, and he will  be the more able to climb them from expecting to do so. Right here is  the critical point in his journey. Numerous cross-roads branch off--some  right, others left, but all with a brighter prospect down them. Perhaps  on one, a wife and children stand at the door of their home, beckoning  him. The garden that his own hand planted blooms in a background of  flowers, while the path he has now chosen sparkles with winter snow. He  knows, however, that beyond these, perhaps amid sterile mountains, are  the precious diamonds he seeks.    \"It is wise that, where these roads branch off--some to castles of  indolence, others to comfortable homes and moderate exertion--the man  should be left alone for a time and allowed to survey the rough path  before him, with all the blinding glamour of enthusiasm subdued by the  light of truth, and with a full knowledge of all the stumbling blocks  which lie before him. If he then thumbs the edge of his hunting-knife,  examines his Henry rifle, and presses forward, the metal is there, and  from that time onward you may at any time learn of his whereabouts by  inquiring at the temple of fame.\"    Sachem interrupted the Professor to remonstrate at the girding of loins  being left out. He had always been used to the girding in similar  discourses, and considered that loins were in much more general use than  Henry rifles.    And now Shamus, from his perch on the pans, suddenly broke in: \"Faith,  Professor, your enthusiasm once brought me sore trouble. It got me into  a haunted house, when the clock was strikin' midnight, and my legs were  sore put to it to get me out fast enough. Ye see, I bet a pig with my  next cousin that I would stay all night in an old house full of spirits.  The master and his house-keeper had been murdered in the tenantry riots,  and the boys that did the business, they swung for it soon afterward.  And now, there was a regular barricadin' and attackin' going on those  nights ever since. While I was lookin' at the old clock, and thinkin' of  the pig I'd drag home in the morning, I must have dramed a little. He  was as likely a pig as yez ever saw, and I was listenin' proudly to his  swate cries as I carried him from the sty, and feelin' full enough of  enthusiasm to stay there a hundred years. Just then there was a rustlin'  in front, and I opened my eyes wide, and there stood the old  house-keeper leanin' against the shaky clock, with her ear to its yellow  face, and lookin' straight behind me to where I could feel the master  was sittin'. There was an awful light in her eyes, and I thought I heard  her say--any way, I knew she was sayin' it--'Hark, Sir Donald, they're  comin', but the soldiers will be here, too, at twelve.' An' then there  was a sort of shudder in the old clock and it commenced a wheezin' an'  bangin' away, a tryin' to get through the strokes of twelve, as it did  twenty years before. But it hadn't got out half, when I heard the crowd  outside scrapin' against the window sill. An' then there come a report,  and the room was filled with smoke, an' somethin' hit the back of my  head. How I got out I don't know, but when I come to myself I was  running for dear life across the common. I have the scar of the ghost's  bullet ever since. See here, yez can see it for yourselves.\" And taking  off his cap, Shamus showed us a bald spot about the size of a silver  dollar on the back of his cranium.    \"And what became of the pig?\" asked Mr. Colon quietly.    \"Faith, an' my cousin carried him home next morning,\" replied Shamus,  with a regretful sigh; \"and lady Dobeen, bless her sowl, never forgot  to tell me of that to her dying day. We were needin' the bacon them  times.\"    Sachem, who delighted to spoil our cook's stories, declared that, to  gain a pig, it was worth the cousin's while to fire an old musket  through the window over a drunken Irishman inside. Still that did not  excuse him for his carelessness; he should have seen that the wad flew  higher.    What Dobeen's answer might have been will never be known; for, just at  that moment, the attention of the entire party was suddenly directed to  a dark mass of moving objects away off upon our right, a mile distant at  least, and to our untrained eyes entirely unrecognizable. The Mexicans,  however, pronounced them buffaloes. Whether thinking to vindicate his  reputation for personal courage, or whether simply from love of  excitement, is not exactly clear, but Dobeen eagerly requested  permission to pursue them, and as he would, _ex officio_, be debarred  the pleasure of future sport, consent was given. This was done the more  readily, because we knew that Shamus, while as inexperienced in the  chase as any of us, was also a wretched rider; for, although constantly  boasting of the tournaments he had been engaged in, we all indorsed  Sachem's opinion, that, if ever connected with such an affair at all, it  must have been in holding a horse, not riding one.    It was worthy of note that every one of the party was as eager for the  chase as Shamus, and yet that personage was allowed to ride off alone.  Mr. Colon, it is true, essayed to join his company, but after going a  hundred yards or so, suddenly changed his mind and came back. Our  maiden efforts in buffalo hunting promised such modesty as to refuse a  public appearance, unless together.    Our cook had been instructed by the guide to avail himself of the  ravines, and after getting as near the herd as possible, then spur  rapidly up to it. He went off at a gallop, his solid body flying clear  of the saddle whenever the donkey's feet struck ground, and soon  disappeared in a ravine which seemed to promise a winding way almost  into the very midst of the herd. We watched intently for his  reappearance. In such periods of suspense the minutes seem strangely  long, creeping as slowly toward their allotted three-score as they do  when one, at a sickbed vigil, listens for the funeral chimes of the  clock, telling when the minutes are buried in the hours.    At length, in the far away distance, we descried Shamus, disdaining  further concealment, riding gallantly out of the ravine for a charge. A  few moments more and game and hunter were face to face, and we held our  breath, expecting to see the dark cloud dash away with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39685"],[0,"Nooks and Corners of Old England (#17)"],[1,": CASTLE COMBE.]    Biddestone, above Corsham, has many good old houses round its village  green. The little bell turret to the church is singular, but the eye is  detracted by an ugly stove-pipe which sticks out of the roof close by.  There is some Roman work within, but the high box pews look out of  keeping. About three miles to the north-west is Castle Combe, one of  the sweetest villages in Wiltshire or in any other county. It is  surrounded by hills and hanging woods, and lies deep down and hidden  from view. As you descend, the banks on either side show glimpses, here  and there; a grey gable peeping out of the dense foliage or grey  cottages perched up high. Still downward, the road winds in the shade of  lofty trees, then suddenly you find yourself looking down upon the  quaint old market-cross, with the grey church tower peering over some  ancient roofs. This presumably is the market-place,--not a busy one by  any means, for beyond an aged inhabitant resting on the solid stone  base, or perhaps a child or two climbing up and down the steps (for it  is a splendid playground)--all is still. The village pump alongside the  cross, truly, supplies occasional buckets of water for the various  gabled stone cottages around, indeed (as is invariably the case when  one's camera is in position) people seemed to spring up from nowhere,  and the pump handle was exceptionally busy. The cross is richly  sculptured with shields and roses at the base, and the shaft rises high  above the picturesque old roof, which is supported by four moulded stone  supports. Undoubtedly it is one of the most perfect fifteenth-century  crosses in England. The road still winds downwards to a rushing stream  crossed by a little bridge, and here there is a group of pretty cottages  with prettier gardens abutting on the road. We have seen these under  very different aspects, in March with snow upon the creepers, and in  October when the creepers were brilliant scarlet, and scarcely know  which made the prettier picture. The sound of rushing water adds romance  to this sweet village.    The ancient family of Scrope has been seated here for over five  centuries and a half. The \"Castle Inn\" by the market-cross remains  primitive in its arrangements, although the \"tripping\" season makes  great demands upon its supplies. Though ordinarily quiet enough,  occasionally there is a swarm, and a sudden demand of a hundred or so  \"teas\" is enough to try the resources of any hostess. But it was too  much for the poor lady here; her health was bad, and she would have to  flee before another season came round. Strange to say, it is the  slackness of business that usually sends folks away. The graceful  fifteenth-century pinnacled and embattled tower of the church gives the  ancient building a grand appearance. The church is rich in stained  glass, containing the arms of the various lords of the manor.    [Illustration: YATTON KEYNELL MANOR.]    Yatton Keynell, a couple of miles eastwards, possesses a fine Jacobean  manor-house, with a curious porch and very uncommon mullioned window.  The wing to the right was demolished not many years ago, so that now a  front of three gables is all that remains; and though it looks fairly  capacious, there are but few rooms, the space being taken up with  staircase (a fine one) and attics. The exterior of the church is good,  but the interior is \"as new as ninepence,\" saving a fine  fifteenth-century stone rood-screen. The spiral staircase up to the  summit has been cut through, which is a pity, as otherwise the organ  would have been less conspicuous. The steps of the village cross now  serve as a basement for the village inn.    [Illustration: BULLICH MANOR-HOUSE.]    The churches of Stanton St. Quinton and Kingston St. Michael have  suffered internally as much as that of Yatton Keynell, and, alas! the  fourteenth-century manor-house of the St. Quintons is now no more. An  aged person working in the churchyard, though very proud that he had  helped to pull it down, insisted on pointing out the \"ould dov-cart\"  This may be pure \"Wilshire,\" but until we saw the dovecot we did not  grasp the meaning. Nearer Chippenham is Bullich House, which fortunately  has been left in peace. Beside the entrance gate two queer little  \"gazebos\" were covered with Virginia creeper in its bright autumn tints.  The remains of the clear moat washed the garden wall, over which peeped  the gables of the house with the waning red sunlight reflected in the  casements--this was a picture to linger in one's memory; and there is  no telling how far one's fancy might not have been led by speculating  upon the meaning of two grim heads which form pinnacles above the porch,  had the stillness not been broken by the harsh sounds of the gramophone  issuing from a neighbouring cottage! If Bullich possesses a ghost, as it  ought to, judging by appearances, surely an up-to-date music-hall ditty  should \"lay\" him in the moat in desperation.    [Illustration: SHELDON MANOR.]    [Illustration: SHELDON MANOR.]    About a mile away on the western side of the main road from Chippenham  to Yatton Keynell is Sheldon Manor, a charming old residence with a  great Gothic porch like a church, and a Gothic window over it belonging  to what is called the \"Priest's chamber.\" Upon the gable end, over it,  is one of those queer little box sundials one occasionally sees in  Wiltshire. As you enter the porch the massive staircase faces you, with  its picturesque newels and pendants, and the little carved oak gate,  which was there to keep the dogs downstairs. In the wall to the right,  just beyond the entrance door, is a curious stone trough of fair  capacity. It is screened by a door, and exteriorly looks like a  cupboard; but what was the use of this trough we are at a loss to  conjecture, unless in old days the horses were admitted.    [Illustration: SOUTH WRAXALL MANOR-HOUSE.]    [Illustration: SOUTH WRAXALL.]    But two of the finest old houses in the county are certainly South  Wraxall and Great Chaldfield, situated within a couple of miles from one  another to the west of Melksham. The former has recently been converted  from a farmhouse again into a mansion, and the latter is now undergoing  careful restoration. Though the exterior of Great Chaldfield is  unimpaired, and as perfect a specimen of an early fifteenth-century  house as one could wish to see, sad havoc has been played inside. The  great hall many years ago was so divided up that it was difficult to  guess at its original proportions. The finest Gothic windows with  groined roofs, ornamental bosses, and fireplaces, and carved oak beams,  have long since been blocked up and their places filled with mean ones  of the Georgian period or later. To fully comprehend the wholesale  obliteration of the original work, one has only to see the thousand bits  of sculptured masonry laid out upon the lawn of the back garden. To  place the pieces of the puzzle correctly together must be a task to try  the knowledge and patience of the most expert in such matters, but piece  by piece each is going into its proper place. The huge stone heads with  scooped-out eyes, through which the ancient lord of the manor could  watch what was going on below in the hall without being observed, once  again will be reinstated. There are three of them, and the hollowed eyes  have sharp edges, as if they were cut out only yesterday. Then there is  an ungainly grinning figure of the fifteenth century, locally known as  \"Blue Beard,\" who within living memory has sat on the lawn in front of  the mansion; but his proper place is up aloft on top of one of the gable  ends, and there, of course, he will go, and, like Sister Ann, be able to  survey the road to Broughton Gifford to see whether anybody is coming.  Among the rooms now under course of repair is \"Blue Beard's chamber,\"  and naturally enough the neighbouring children of the past generation  (we do not speak of the present, for doubtless up-to-date education has  made them far too knowing to treat such things seriously--the more's the  pity) used to hold the house in holy dread. But there certainly is a  creepy look about it, especially towards dusk, when the light of the  western sky shines through the shell of a beautiful oriel window, and  makes the monsters on the gable ends stand out while the front courtyard  is wrapt in shade. The reed-grown moat gives the house a neglected and  sombre look. The group of buildings, with curious little church with its  crocketed bell turret on one side and a great barn on the other, is  altogether remarkable. How it got the name of \"Blue Beard's Castle\" we  could not learn. Recently a \"priest's hole\" has been discovered up  against the ceiling in a corner of his chamber; but whether he concealed  himself here or some of his wives we cannot say.    At the back of the manor there used to be a tumble-down old mill, which  unfortunately is now no more. The little church contains a good stone  screen (which has been removed from its original position), and some  stained glass in the windows. The pulpit, a canopied two-decker, and the  capacious high-backed pews (half a dozen at the most) have the  appearance of a pocket place of worship. But Great Chaldfield is a  parish by itself without a village; the congregation also is a pocket  one.    As before stated, South Wraxall manor-house is restored to all its  ancient dignity; but somehow or other, though much care and money have  been bestowed upon it, it seems to have lost half of its poetry, for the  walls and gardens are now so trim and orderly, that it is almost  difficult to recognise it as the same when the gardens were weed-grown  and the walls toned with lichen and moss. Moreover, the road has been  diverted, so that now the fine old gatehouse stands not against the  highway, but well within the boundary walls. Inside are some remarkably  fine old rooms with linen panelling. The drawing-room "]]]
