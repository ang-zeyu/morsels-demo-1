This method still is practised, and succeeds occasionally, but the weapon  is an unwieldy one, both in use, and for carriage to the place of action;  and science has now placed in our power another plan, by means of which I  believe that by far the greater number of recent captures have been made.    The plan alluded to, is to take advantage of the creature's royal taste for  game--for in that light I take his predilection for decomposing animal  matter, now a matter of notoriety; and so potent is the attraction of the  _haut-gout_ for the royal palate, that if any animal, or part of one, not  too recently slaughtered, be suspended near the known haunts of the insect,  ten to one but its savour will bring him down to earth to taste the  luxurious morsel, and so engrossed does he become when thus engaged, that  he may be swept off by the net without difficulty. In the space of two or  three days large numbers of Emperors have been caught by means {115} of  this novel and singular trap, and the seemingly coarse and unbutterfly-like  taste that leads them to it.    The wings of the male only have that splendid glow of changing purple that  gives him his name and honours, the empress having in its place a sober  garb of brown; she, however, considerably exceeds her lord in dimensions  and expanse of wing. From her stay-at-home habits, sitting all day in her  oak-leaf bower, she is comparatively seldom seen or captured. I believe  collectors generally take about ten males to one female.    On the under side the colouring of both sexes is similar, and affords a  striking contrast to the dark upper surface, having the white markings  arranged as on the upper side, but rather broader; and, instead of the dark  brown or purple, a lively pattern of orange-brown, greyish brown, and  black. On the front wing is a purple-centred eye-spot, and a smaller one is  seen near the lower angle of the hind wing.    The firm, muscular appearance of the wings, gives promise of great strength  in those organs, fully borne out in the powerful and bird-like flight of  the creature, who has also a habit of soaring, about midday, to vast  heights in the air, and there engaging in contests, sportive or pugnacious,  with his brother, or rival, Emperors.    In the _caterpillar_ state also the Purple Emperor is a remarkable  creature, of the form shown in Plate I. fig. 5, bright green, striped with  yellow on each side, and bearing on his head a pair of horns or tentacles.  {116} Though the perfect insect is chiefly found on the oak, the  caterpillar feeds generally on the broad-leaved Sallow, though it has been  occasionally found on the Poplar.    The _chrysalis_, which may be found on the same trees, suspended to the  under side of a leaf, is shown at Fig. 22, Plate I. and is of a light green  colour.    The _butterfly_ appears in July, and is found in oak woods in many  localities of the South. The following are a few of these:--Near  Colchester, extremely abundant, Epping, Great and Little Stour Woods;  Kettering, Barnwell Wold, Northamptonshire; Bourne, Lincoln; Leicester;  Reading, Newbury, Berks; Herefordshire; Forest of Dean, Monmouthshire;  Warwickshire; Suffolk; Monkswood, Hunts; Clapham Park Wood, Beds; Darenth  Wood, Chatham, Tenterden; Ticehurst, Balcombe, Tilgate Forest, Arundel,  near Brighton; Lyndhurst; Stowmarket; Isle of Wight.    [Illustration: XII.]    {117} THE PAINTED LADY. (_Cynthia Cardui._)    (Plate VII. fig. 3.)    We now come to a very natural group of butterflies, rich, and often  gorgeous, in their colouring, and having, both in their perfect and  preparatory states, many characteristics in common, in point of habits, as  well as of appearance and construction. The caterpillars are all thorny,  and the chrysalides are adorned with brilliant metallic (generally  _golden_) spots, from which appearance was derived the name  \"_chrysalis_,\"[11] since applied, but somewhat improperly, to the _pupae_  of _all_ butterflies. This golden effect is produced by a brilliant white  membrane underlying the transparent yellow outer skin of the chrysalis, and  it may be imitated, as discovered by Lister many years ago, \"by putting a  small piece of black gall in a strong decoction of nettles; this produces a  scum which, when left on cap-paper, will exquisitely gild it, without the  application of the real metal.\"    The present species is a highly elegant insect, well named the Painted  Lady, and in France the \"_Belle Dame_.\"    The colouring of the upper surface is composed of black and very dark  brown, with irregular markings of an orange red, tinged partially with a  rosy hue. Near the tip of the front wings are several pure white spots.    Beneath, the great beauty lies in the delicate pencilling of the hind wing  with pearly greys and browns, and contrasted with this, the warm roseate  blush and aurora tint on the upper wing.    The _caterpillar_ is thorny and brown, with yellow stripes down the back  and sides. It feeds on various {118} species of thistle, but sometimes also  on the nettle and other plants.    The _chrysalis_ is brown and grey, with silver spots.    The butterfly first appears about the end of July, and is seen till the end  of September, and occasionally in October. I took a beautiful fresh  specimen in _October_, while strolling through a nursery garden at  Wandsworth.    Those seen in early spring are _hybernated_ specimens.    The appearance of this butterfly in any given locality is a matter of great  uncertainty, though it capriciously visits, and even abounds occasionally  in almost every place.    It is a bold insect, and, though agile in its movements, not difficult to  catch, for, if disturbed or missed at the first stroke, it returns to the  charge quite fearlessly.           *       *       *       *       *    THE RED ADMIRAL. (_Vanessa Atalanta._)    (Plate VIII. fig. 1.)    In grand simplicity and vividness of colour, the Red Admiral perhaps  surpasses every other British butterfly, and reminds one forcibly of some  of the gorgeous denizens of the tropics. Intense black and brilliant  scarlet in bands and borders are the two chief elements {119} of this  splendour, relieved delightfully by the cool white spots at the outer and  upper corners, and by the choice little bits of blue at the inner and lower  angles and near the margins. The painting of the under surface entirely  beggars description. There is, in addition to the red band, a good deal of  blue on the upper wing, and the lower wing is covered by an intricate  embroidery of indescribable tints--all manner of browns, and greys, and  blacks, with golden and other hues of metals, are here pencilled and  blended with magic effect.    The _caterpillar_, which feeds on the common nettle, is thorny, yellowish  grey in colour, with light yellow lines on each side and black markings.    The _chrysalis_ is brownish, with gold spots.    The butterfly usually comes out in August, and may be met with till early  in October. The hybernated specimens of this are more rarely seen than  those of any of the other common _Vanessas_.    Like others of its genus, the Red Admiral is familiar, and even saucy, in  its manners, seeming to prefer the haunts of men to the solitudes that  other insects love, flaunting boldly before our face in gardens and  highways, where most we meet it.    It is found commonly all over the country.           *       *       *       *       *    {120}    THE PEACOCK BUTTERFLY. (_Vanessa Io._)    (Plate VIII. fig. 2.)    The form and markings of this species, so distinct from every other of our  butterflies, will be seen by reference to the plate; and as to its  colouring, I will not do it the injustice to attempt a description of its  rich perfection, more especially as almost every reader may hope to add the  insect to his collection during his first year's hunting, and then he can  study its beauties for himself.    The under side, however, presents a remarkable contrast to the splendour of  the reverse, being covered with shades and streaks of funereal blacks and  browns. This affords a strange effect when the insect, sitting on a flower  head, alternately opens and shuts the wings with a fanning motion,  according to its custom.    The _caterpillar_ (Plate I. fig. 6), which feeds gregariously upon the  nettle, is black, dotted with white, and thorny.    The _chrysalis_ is greenish, with gold spots.    The _butterfly_, which is common in nearly every part of England, comes out  in August and September, the individuals met with not unfrequently in the  spring having hybernated.    Mr. Doubleday writes thus to the _Zoologist_ regarding the winter retreats  of butterflies of this genus:--\"Last {121} winter some large stacks of  beech faggots, which had been loosely stacked up in our forest (_Epping_)  the preceding spring, with the dead leaves adhering to them, were taken  down and carted away, and among these were many scores of _Io_, _Urticae_,  and _Polychloros_.\"    In Scotland this is generally a very rare butterfly, but has latterly been  abundant in Dumfriesshire and Kirkcudbrightshire.           *       *       *       *       *    THE CAMBERWELL BEAUTY. (_Vanessa Antiopa._)    (Plate VIII. fig. 3.)    Many years ago, when Camberwell was a real village, luxuriating in its  willows, the entomologists of the day were delighted by the apparition, in  that suburb, of this well-named \"Beauty,\" whose name since then has always  been associated with Camberwell--certainly not a promising place in the  present day for a butterfly hunt, for, though it has its \"beauties\" still,  they are not of the lepidopterous order, nor game for any net that the  entomologist usually carries. Since then it has been found at intervals,  and in very variable abundance, in a wide range of localities.    The arrangement of colours in this butterfly is most remarkable and  unusual, by reason of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33941"],[0,"The Methods of Glass Blowing and of Working Silica in the Oxy-Gas Flame (#17)"],[1,"to make several shorter  tubes of the required diameter, and say 200 to 250 mm. in length, and to  join these end to end. It does not answer to add lumps of silica to the  end of the bulb, for the sides of the tube made in this way become too  thin, and blow-holes are constantly formed during the making of them.  These can be mended, it is true, but they spoil the appearance of the  work.    [Illustration]    Tubes made in the manner described above are thickened by adding rings  of silica and blowing them when hot to spread the silica. If a  combination of several jets is employed, very large tubes can be  constructed in this way. One of Messrs. Baird and Tatlock's workmen  lately blew a bulb about 5 cm. in diameter, and it was clear that he  could have converted it into a long cylindrical tube of equal diameter  had it been necessary to do so.    Very thin tubes of 1.5 cm. diameter, and tubes of considerable thickness  and of equal size, are easily made after some practice, and fine  capilliaries and millimetre tube can be made with about equal readiness.    If a very fine tube of even bore is required, it may be drawn from a  small thick cylinder after a little practice.    When a tube becomes so large that it cannot be heated uniformly on all  sides by rotating it in the flame, it is convenient to place a sheet of  silica in front of the flame a little beyond the object to be heated, in  order that the former may throw back the flame on those parts of the  tube which are most remote from the jet. A suitable plate may be made by  sticking together small lumps of silica rendered plastic by heat.    The silica tubes thus made can be cut and broken like glass, they can be  joined together before the flame, and they can also be drawn into  smaller tubes when softened by heat.    In order to make a side connection as in a T piece, a ring of silica  should be applied to the tube in the position fixed upon for the joint.  This ring must then be slightly expanded, a new ring added, and so on,  till a short side tube is formed. To this it is easy to seal a longer  tube of the required dimensions. It is thus possible to produce Geissler  tubes, small distilling flasks, etc. Solid rods of silica are easily  made by pressing together the softened ends of the fine rods or threads  previously mentioned. Such rods and small masses can be ground and  polished without annealing them.      =Quartz Fibres.=--These were introduced into physical work by Mr. Boys  in 1889. They may be made by attaching a fine rod of vitrified quartz to  the tail of a small straw arrow provided with a needle-point; placing  the arrow in position on a cross-bow, heating the rod of silica till it  is thoroughly softened and then letting the arrow fly from the bow, when  it will carry with it an extremely fine thread of silica. A little  practice is necessary to ensure success, but a good operator can  produce threads of great tenacity and great uniformity. Fuller accounts  of the process and of the various properties and uses of quartz fibres  will be found in Mr. Boys' lectures (Roy. Inst. Proc. 1889, and Proc.  Brit. Assn. 1890), and in Mr. Threlfall's Laboratory Arts.            INDEX.        Air-traps,                                               69.
