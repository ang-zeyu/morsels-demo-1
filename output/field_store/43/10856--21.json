This small terrestrial species inhabits the pine and fir forests of the  Cordillera Volcanica between elevations of 1850 and 3100 meters;  apparently it is absent from the Sierra de Coalcoman. It seems to prefer  rather open coniferous forests in which there is a more or less  continuous cover of grasses on the ground. On warm sunny days the  lizards can be observed scurrying about in the grass; in the early hours  of the day, or on cold days, they are found beneath stones, logs, or  dead clumps of bunch grass.      ~Sceloporus asper~ Boulenger         _Sceloporus asper_ Boulenger, Proc. Zool. Soc. London,       1897:497, October, 1897.--La Cumbre de los Arrastrados,       Jalisco, Mexico.         Apatzingan (3); 10 km. E of Dos Aguas; Uruapan (41).    This strictly arboreal lizard is abundant in the mixed broad-leafed  forest near Uruapan. The lizards are exceedingly wary and can be  approached only with difficulty. In life males have pale blue bellies;  the throat is pale pink. The pale gray dorsum marked with irregular  darker gray blotches blends well with the color of the tree trunks on  which the lizard lives. The one specimen from Dos Aguas was found on a  pine tree; it provides the only record for the species from the Sierra  de Coalcoman.      ~Sceloporus bulleri~ Boulenger         _Sceloporus bulleri_ Boulenger, Proc. Zool. Soc. London,       1894:729, April, 1895.--Las Cumbre de los Arrastrados,       Jalisco, Mexico.         Acuaro de las Lleguas (13); Barolosa (9); Dos Aguas (61); 10       km. NE of Dos Aguas (5).    Heretofore this species has been known only from a few specimens from  scattered localities in the Sierra Madre Occidental in southwestern  Jalisco and Sinaloa. The collection of a large series of these lizards  in virgin pine forest at elevations of more than 2000 meters in the  Sierra de Coalcoman now makes possible an analysis of variation in the  species.    Superficially _S. bulleri_ resembles _S. torquatus_, but _S. bulleri_ is  smaller, has more dorsal scales, fewer scales in the dark collar, and  fewer femoral pores. In 88 specimens of _S. bulleri_ there are 36-41  (38.7) dorsal scales and 2 or 3 (2.6) middorsal scales in the collar, as  compared with 28-31 (29.3) dorsal scales and 3 or 4 (3.4) middorsal  scales in the collar of 26 specimens of _S. torquatus_ from Uruapan. In  20 adult males of _S. bulleri_ there are 13-15 (14.3) femoral pores, and  13-16 (14.4) in 11 females; 13 males of _S. torquatus_ have 14-21 (17.3)  femoral pores, and 13 females have 15-21 (16.7). Seventeen adult males  of _S. bulleri_ have snout-vent lengths of 72-91 (82.0); ten females,  71-87 (75.7). In comparison, 13 adult males of _S. torquatus_ have an  average snout-vent length of 88.9 mm., and 13 females, 88.5 mm. In _S.  bulleri_ there is little variation in the head scales. The frontal is in  contact with the interparietal in 63, and not in 24, specimens; the  median frontonasal is in contact with the frontal in 13, and not in 74,  specimens. In 39 specimens there are two canthals, and in 48 there is  one; in 29 specimens there are three preauriculars, and in 58 there are  four.    In life adult males have a pale blue tail, bright blue belly patches, a  purplish blue throat, and pale blue lines on the sides of the head and  neck.    This species was obtained at four localities in the high mountains of  the Sierra de Coalcoman. In this mountain range _Sceloporus bulleri_  apparently replaces _S. torquatus_, a species that is widespread in the  Cordillera Volcanica and on the Mexican Plateau. At Dos Aguas and at  Acuaro de las Lleguas the lizards were abundant in the tall pine forest,  where they were found on standing pine trees, on pine logs, and on rock  outcroppings.      ~Sceloporus dugesi intermedius~ Duges         _Sceloporus intermedius_ Duges, La Naturaleza, 4:29,       1877.--La Noria, near Zamora, Michoacan, Mexico.         _Sceloporus dugesii intermedius_, Smith, Univ. Kansas Sci.       Bull., 24:663, February 16, 1938.         Cojumatlan (6); Jiquilpan (11); Lago de Camecuaro; Lago de       Chapala; Morelia (23); Patzcuaro (84); Quiroga (35); Sahuayo       (4); Tacicuaro (2); Tangamandapio (17); Tangancicuaro (9);       Zacapu (4); Zamora (11); Zinapecuaro (9).    This lizard is strictly an inhabitant of the Mexican Plateau, where it  is found in rocky places, sometimes in pine-oak forest, but more  frequently in mesquite-grassland. It is a terrestrial species, and is  most often seen on rock fences at elevations of 1500 to 2200 meters.    This species differs from _S. bulleri_ and _S. torquatus_ in having two  rows of supraoculars, instead of one; also it has more dorsal scales.  Twenty-six specimens of _Sceloporus dugesi intermedius_ from  Tangamandapio and Tangancicuaro have 44-48 (45.7) dorsal scales, as  compared with an average of 38.7 in _S. bulleri_ and 29.3 in _S.  torquatus_. In life _Sceloporus dugesi intermedius_ has a dull greenish  gray dorsum; in males the belly patches are bright blue bordered  medially by black, and the throat is bluish gray. The largest specimen  examined is a male having a snout-vent length of 80 mm.      ~Sceloporus gadowae~ Boulenger         _Sceloporus gadoviae_ Boulenger, Proc. Zool. Soc. London,       1905, 2:246, October 7, 1905.--Mezquititlan, Guerrero,       Mexico.         Chupio; El Sabino (77); La Playa (6); Rio Marquez, 10 km. S       of Lombardia (11).    Although this species has a rather extensive range in the  Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin in the state of Michoacan, Guerrero, Morelos,  and Puebla, it is only locally abundant in that area. Usually these  lizards are found on rocky cliffs in which there are many crevices for  cover. _Sceloporus gadowae_ is abundant on a conglomerate cliff along  the Rio Marquez south of Lombardia. Although the closely related _S.  pyrocephalus_ is abundant in the stream valley and in the hills above  the cliff, _S. gadowae_ has been found only on the cliff; few  individuals of _S. pyrocephalus_ have been observed on the cliff. A  similar situation was discovered on a much more extensive conglomerate  cliff along the Rio Balsas near Mexcala, Guerrero. Near Tehuitzingo,  Puebla, where _S. pyrocephalus_ was not found, _S. gadowae_ was found on  conglomerate cliffs. Probably there is strong competition between the  two species; possibly this has resulted in the restriction of _S.  gadowae_ to isolated cliff-habitats within the extensive range of the  more widespread _S. pyrocephalus_.    In Michoacan _Sceloporus gadowae_ has been found along the lower slopes  of the Cordillera Volcanica at elevations from 250 to 1050 meters. All  of the localities from which this lizard is known lie in the arid  tropical scrub forest.      ~Sceloporus grammicus microlepidotus~ Wiegmann         _Sceloporus microlepidotus_ Wiegmann, Herpetologia Mexicana,       p. 51, 1834.--Mexico. Type locality restricted to Mexico,       Distrito Federal, by Smith and Taylor (1950b:120).         _Sceloporus grammicus microlepidotus_, Smith and Laufe,       Trans. Kansas Acad.

SE of Zitacuaro; between Zurumbeneo and Cerro       Garnica.    This small species of _Sceloporus_ is an ubiquitous inhabitant of the  coniferous forests from 1550 to 3100 meters in the Cordillera Volcanica.  Usually it is seen on tree trunks, but occasionally on the ground. Near  the lower limit of the altitudinal distribution of the species, as at  Uruapan, individuals sometimes are found on broad-leafed trees.  Apparently _Sceloporus heterolepis_ replaces _S. grammicus  microlepidotus_ in the Sierra de Coalcoman.      ~Sceloporus heterolepis~ Boulenger         _Sceloporus heterolepis_ Boulenger, Proc. Zool. Soc. London,       1894:731, April, 1895.--La Cumbre de los Arrastrados,       Jalisco, Mexico.         Araparicuaro; Cerro Barolosa (6); Dos Aguas (13); Los       Conejos; 11 km. N of Uruapan (3).    Although Michoacan has not previously been included in the range of this  lizard, it was first collected in the state by Gadow in 1908 (BMNH  1914.1.28.69 from Araparicuaro). The description of _S. heterolepis_  given by Smith (1939:197) can be supplemented by data on the 23  specimens now in the collections of the Museum of Zoology at the  University of Michigan. All have two canthals; there are 55 to 71 (63.6)  scales in the middorsal row; 1 to 3 rows middorsally are somewhat  enlarged and bordered on either side by a row of larger scales bearing  high keels. There are 14 to 20 (16.2) femoral pores. Eight adult males  have snout-vent lengths from 49 to 61 (58.0) mm. and tail lengths from  57 to 74 (66.0) mm.; four adult females have snout-vent lengths from 52  to 57 (55.2) mm. and tail lengths from 60 to 66 (63.5) mm. The smallest  of eight juveniles has a snout-vent length of 28 mm. and a tail length  of 32 mm. The dorsum in adults is pale grayish brown; there are three  irregular chevron-shaped dark marks and a triangular dark brown mark  above the insertion of the hind limbs; on the tail are dark brown rings.  There are scattered faint blue flecks on the flanks and narrow  transverse dark lines on the lower limbs.

They ought to be able to hear it now,  and it will relieve their minds.\"    He discharged his rifle four or five times, and they fancied that they  heard shots in return.    \"Hullo!\" Mr. Atherton exclaimed suddenly. \"Easy all! Hold her up hard  all!\" Although the order was entirely unexpected it was given so sharply  that it was instantly obeyed, and the boat was brought to a stand-still  before she had advanced another length. Then the rowers looked round to  see what had been the occasion of the sudden order. In front of them,  scarce ten feet away, towered up a dark mass of rock. They could only  see it ahead of the boat, and how high it was or how far it extended on  either side they knew not.    \"Why, what is this?\" the mate said in astonishment. \"We did not notice  any islands as we came along. It has been a narrow escape, for at the  rate at which we were going through the water we should have stove in  our bow had we run on it.\"    \"We have had a narrower escape than we deserve,\" Mr. Atherton said. \"I  cannot think how we can have been so foolish.\"    \"What do you mean?\" the mate asked.    \"Why we have been steering straight for the guns, have we not?\"    \"Of course we have.\"    \"Well, we ought not to have done so. If the ship had been lying well out  from the land it would have been all right; but she is lying in a deep  bay, and of course a straight course to her from the point we started  from would take us just where we are, that is ashore, on the other side  of the headland.\"    \"Of course it would. We ought to have kept well to seaward of the guns  till they bore right on our beam, and then headed in to her. Well,  fortunately no harm has been done, but we have had a mighty narrow  escape. If the fog had been as thick as it was when it first came down  upon us we should have gone right into it before we saw it.\"    The boat was turned and rowed out to sea for some distance, then they  again headed her in the direction in which they wished to go, but  keeping the guns well in shore of them until they judged by the sound  that they were nearly opposite to her, then they rowed straight towards  her. The sound of their oars was heard, and a loud hail informed them of  the exact position of the ship, and two or three minutes later a dark  image loomed up in front of the boat.    \"All well, Mr. Ryan?\" the captain shouted.    \"All well, sir.\"    \"You have given us a great fright,\" the captain went on. \"We expected  you back at least two hours ago, thinking of course you would have  returned when the fog set in, even if you had not done so before.\"    \"We had turned, sir, before the fog rolled in; but what with losing our  way, and the difficulty of keeping our course in the fog, and the fact  that there is, we think, a strong current that was running against us  further out, we have been a long time coming back. So, you see, we have  double banked all the oars.\"    By this time they were lying by the gangway. It was found that the girls  in spite of their wraps were so stiff with the cold that they had to be  assisted up the gangway to the deck. Exercise warmed the blood of the  rest, and they were soon on deck. Mr. Atherton, who alone of the men  had not been rowing, had some little difficulty in getting up, although,  as he said, he had no more right to feel cold than a walrus, protected  as he was by nature.    There had been much anxiety on board until the shots fired by Mr.  Atherton were heard. The captain had ordered plenty of hot soup to be  got ready, and the girls soon felt in a comfortable glow. Mr. Atherton  gave a comical account of their adventures, but he did not conceal the  fact that at one time their position had been really a perilous one, and  that if they had not been pretty vigilant they might have fallen into  the hands of the natives.    \"Well, all is well that ends well,\" Mr. Renshaw said, \"but I think we  will have no more boat excursions as long as we are in the neighbourhood  of cannibals. Of course no one could have foreseen the fog coming on so  suddenly, but you have evidently all had a narrow escape.\"    Those who had taken part in the adventure, however, were highly pleased  with their share in it, and agreed that although perhaps at the time it  was unpleasant it was very exciting, and was an incident that they  should never forget all their lives.    The fog continued for three days, at the end of which time an easterly  wind set in and the air cleared, and the _Flying Scud_ weighed her  anchor and proceeded on her voyage. Ten days later a gale set in from  the south. The cold was intense, and the spray as it flew from her bows  cased her fore-rigging and deck with ice. The wind increased hourly in  fury, and the captain decided to run before it. \"We have plenty of  sea-room,\" he said, \"and shall get out of this bitter cold as we get  further north. It will not last long, I daresay.\"    Day after day, however, the gale continued, seeming to increase rather  than diminish in force. On the morning of the sixth day after it had  begun the passengers heard a tremendous crash on deck. Wilfrid ran up  the companion and looked out, and reported that the mainmast and the  fore-top-mast had gone overboard. Fortunately the gust that had done this  damage proved to be the climax of the gale; by nightfall its force had  sensibly abated, and two days later it fell to a calm, and all hands set  to work to repair damages.    \"I have no spar that will be of any use for a mainmast,\" the captain  said. \"We must content ourselves with getting up a fore-top-mast and  then under what sail we can set upon that and the mizzen make for one of  the islands and try to get a good-sized spar for the mainmast. I reckon  that we are not more than two hundred and fifty miles from the Austral  Group. We have been blown nearly twenty degrees north.\"    Three days later land was seen ahead, and this the captain, after taking  an observation, declared to be Malayta, one of the largest islands of  the group.    \"I would rather have gone on under this reduced sail,\" he said to Mr.  Atherton, in whom he had great confidence, \"if we had been sure of fine  weather; but that we cannot reckon upon at this time of year, and I  should not like to be caught in another gale in this crippled state so  near the islands. So of the two evils I consider it the least to go in  and try and get a spar that will do for our purpose.\"    \"What is the evil of going in?\" Mr. Atherton asked.    \"The natives,\" the captain replied shortly. \"They are a treacherous lot  in all these islands; but the Australs bear a particularly bad  reputation, and we shall have to be very careful in our dealings with  them.\"    \"Well, as we are forewarned they are not likely to take us by surprise,  captain; and as with the crew and passengers we can muster a pretty  strong force, we ought to be able to beat off any open attack.\"    \"Yes, I think we could do that,\" the captain agreed. \"If I did not think  so I would not put in, but would take the chance of our making our way,  crippled as we are, to New Zealand. The thing we shall have to guard  against is a sudden and treacherous onslaught; the crews of many ships  have been massacred owing to carelessness and over-confidence. However,  we will not be caught napping, and I therefore hope to get off  unscathed.\"    As they neared the land the passengers were delighted with the aspect of  the shore. Groves of trees came down to the very edge of the water; in  the interior the land was high, but was covered to the summit of the  hills with foliage. As they approached, and the captain gave orders to  prepare for anchoring, they could see a number of natives gathered on  the narrow strip of sands close to the water. They were waving boughs of  trees in token of friendship, and were, as far as could be seen by the  aid of a telescope, unarmed.    \"They look friendly, mother,\" Marion said after watching them through  the glass. \"Won't it be nice to land and take a walk among those  feathery-looking trees. There will be no fear of fogs or cold here, the  temperature is quite perfect.\"    \"You will not land, I can assure you, young lady,\" the captain, who was  passing by and overheard her, said. \"Those fellows look friendly enough,  I agree, but there are no more treacherous rascals among the islanders  of the Pacific. I shall give them as wide a berth as I can, and get them  if possible to cut a spar and tow it out to us, instead of sending a  party on shore to fetch it. No one will leave this ship with my  permission, unless it be a boat's party armed to the teeth to fetch  water. These fellows are as treacherous as the natives of Tierra del  Fuego, and vastly more warlike and dangerous.\"    \"Are they cannibals, captain?\" Mrs. Renshaw asked.    \"That I cannot tell you for certain, Mrs. Renshaw. They are thieves and  murderers, but whether they eat human flesh is more than I can tell. It  does not concern me greatly whether if they kill me they eat me  afterwards or not; but I do not mean to give them the chance of killing  me or any of us, I can assure you.\"    \"After the character you have given me of them I have no longer the  slightest inclination to land, captain.\"    As soon as the vessel came to an anchor a number of canoes put out,  laden with yams, cocoa-nuts, and other vegetables and fruit for  exchange. Had they been allowed they would have come alongside and  climbed up to the deck, but the captain would not permit them to come  within thirty or forty yards. Although there was no one on board who  could speak their language, his emphatic gestures were understood by  the natives, and were sufficient to show them that he was not to be  trifled with. Two boats only were allowed to approach at a time, and a  guard of six sailors with muskets were placed on deck with orders to  prevent anyone coming up, and to cover those who descended the gangway.  The younger passengers thought that"]]]
