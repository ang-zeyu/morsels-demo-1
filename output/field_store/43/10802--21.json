In the two last chapters the nature and force of Inheritance, the  circumstances which interfere with its power, and the tendency to  Reversion, with its many remarkable contingencies, were discussed. In the  present chapter some other related phenomena will be treated of, as fully  as my materials permit.    _Fixedness of Character._    It is a general belief amongst breeders that the longer any character has  been transmitted by a breed, the more firmly it will continue to be  transmitted. I do not wish to dispute the truth of the proposition, that  inheritance gains strength simply through long continuance, but I doubt  whether it can be proved. In one sense the proposition is little better  than a truism; if any character has remained constant during many  generations, it will obviously be little likely, the conditions of life  remaining the same, to vary during the next generation. So, again, in  improving a breed, if care be taken for a length of time to exclude all  inferior individuals, the breed will obviously tend to become truer, as it  will not have been crossed during many generations by an inferior animal.  We have previously seen, {63} but without being able to assign any cause,  that, when a new character appears, it is occasionally from the first well  fixed, or fluctuates much, or wholly fails to be transmitted. So it is with  the aggregate of slight differences which characterise a new variety, for  some propagate their kind from the first much truer than others. Even with  plants multiplied by bulbs, layers, &c., which may in one sense be said to  form parts of the same individual, it is well known that certain varieties  retain and transmit through successive bud-generations their newly-acquired  characters more truly than others. In none of these, nor in the following  cases, does there appear to be any relation between the force with which a  character is transmissible and the length of time during which it has  already been transmitted. Some varieties, such as white and yellow  hyacinths and white sweet-peas, transmit their colours more faithfully than  do the varieties which have retained their natural colour. In the Irish  family, mentioned in the twelfth chapter, the peculiar tortoiseshell-like  colouring of the eyes was transmitted far more faithfully than any ordinary  colour. Ancon and Mauchamp sheep and niata cattle, which are all  comparatively modern breeds, exhibit remarkably strong powers of  inheritance. Many similar cases could be adduced.    As all domesticated animals and cultivated plants have varied, and yet are  descended from aboriginally wild forms, which no doubt had retained the  same character from an immensely remote epoch, we see that scarcely any  degree of antiquity ensures a character being transmitted perfectly true.  In this case, however, it may be said that changed conditions of life  induce certain modifications, and not that the power of inheritance fails;  but in every case of failure, some cause, either internal or external, must  interfere. It will generally be found that the parts in our domesticated  productions which have varied, or which still continue to vary,--that is,  which fail to retain their primordial state,--are the same with the parts  which differ in the natural species of the same genus. As, on the theory of  descent with modification, the species of the same genus have been modified  since they branched off from a common progenitor, it follows that the  characters by which they differ from each other have varied whilst other  parts of the organisation have remained unchanged; and it might be argued  that {64} these same characters now vary under domestication, or fail to be  inherited, owing to their lesser antiquity. But we must believe structures,  which have already varied, would be more liable to go on varying, rather  than structures which during an immense lapse of time have remained  unaltered; and this variation is probably the result of certain relations  between the conditions of life and the organisation, quite independently of  the greater or less antiquity of each particular character.    Fixedness of character, or the strength of inheritance, has often been  judged of by the preponderance of certain characters in the crossed  offspring between distinct races; but prepotency of transmission here comes  into play, and this, as we shall immediately see, is a very different  consideration from the strength or weakness of inheritance. It has often  been observed[136] that breeds of animals inhabiting wild and mountainous  countries cannot be permanently modified by our improved breeds; and as  these latter are of modern origin, it has been thought that the greater  antiquity of the wilder breeds has been the cause of their resistance to  improvement by crossing; but it is more probably due to their structure and  constitution being better adapted to the surrounding conditions. When  plants are first subjected to culture, it has been found that, during  several generations, they transmit their characters truly, that is, do not  vary, and this has been attributed to ancient characters being strongly  inherited; but it may with equal or greater probability be consequent on  changed conditions of life requiring a long time for their accumulative  action. Notwithstanding these considerations, it would perhaps be rash to  deny that characters become more strongly fixed the longer they are  transmitted; but I believe that the proposition resolves itself into  this,--that all characters of all kinds, whether new or old, tend to be  inherited, and that those which have already withstood all counteracting  influences and been truly transmitted, will, as a general rule, continue to  withstand them, and consequently be faithfully inherited.    {65}    _Prepotency in the Transmission of Character._    When individuals distinct enough to be recognised, but of the same family,  or when two well-marked races, or two species, are crossed, the usual  result, as stated in the previous chapter, is, that the offspring in the  first generation are intermediate between their parents, or resemble one  parent in one part and the other parent in another part. But this is by no  means the invariable rule; for in many cases it is found that certain  individuals, races, and species are prepotent in transmitting their  likeness. This subject has been ably discussed by Prosper Lucas,[137] but  is rendered extremely complicated by the prepotency sometimes running  equally in both sexes, and sometimes more strongly in one sex than in the  other; it is likewise complicated by the presence of secondary sexual  characters, which render the comparison of mongrels with their  parent-breeds difficult.    It would appear that in certain families some one ancestor, and after him  others in the same family, must have had great power in transmitting their  likeness through the male line; for we cannot otherwise understand how the  same features should so often be transmitted after marriages with various  females, as has been the case with the Austrian Emperors, and as, according  to Niebuhr, formerly occurred in certain Roman families with their mental  qualities.[138] The famous bull Favourite is believed[139] to have had a  prepotent influence on the shorthorn race. It has also been observed[140]  with English race-horses that certain mares have generally transmitted  their own character, whilst other mares of equally pure blood have allowed  the character of the sire to prevail.        The truth of the principle of prepotency comes out more clearly when      certain races are crossed. The improved Shorthorns, notwithstanding      that the breed is comparatively modern, are generally acknowledged to      possess great power in impressing their likeness on all other breeds;      and it is chiefly in consequence of this power that they are so highly      valued {66} for exportation.[141] Godine has given a curious case of a      ram of a goat-like breed of sheep from the Cape of Good Hope, which      produced offspring hardly to be distinguished from himself, when      crossed with ewes of twelve other breeds. But two of these half-bred      ewes, when put to a merino ram, produced lambs closely resembling the      merino breed. Girou de Buzareingues[142] found that of two races of      French sheep the ewes of one, when crossed during successive      generations with merino rams, yielded up their character far sooner      than the ewes of the other race. Sturm and Girou have given analogous      cases with other breeds of sheep and with cattle, the prepotency      running in these cases through the male side; but I was assured on good      authority in South America, that when niata cattle are crossed with      common cattle, though the niata breed is prepotent whether males or      females are used, yet that the prepotency is strongest through the      female line. The Manx cat is tailless and has long hind legs; Dr.      Wilson crossed a male Manx with common cats, and, out of twenty-three      kittens, seventeen were destitute of tails; but when the female Manx      was crossed by common male cats all the kittens had tails, though they      were generally short and imperfect.[143]        In making reciprocal crosses between pouter and fantail pigeons, the      pouter-race seemed to be prepotent through both sexes over the fantail.      But this is probably due to weak power in the fantail rather than to      any unusually strong power in the pouter, for I have observed that      barbs also preponderated over fantails. This weakness of transmission      in the fantail, though the breed is an ancient one, is said[144] to be      general; but I have observed one exception to the rule, namely, in a      cross between a fantail and laugher. The most curious instance known to      me of weak power in both sexes is in the trumpeter pigeon.

During  six days of the week all that could happen might happen, so far as  Dermod was concerned, but on the seventh day nothing should happen at  all if the High King could restrain it. Had it been possible he would  have tethered the birds to their own green branches on that day, and  forbidden the clouds to pack the upper world with stir and colour. These  the king permitted, with a tight lip, perhaps, but all else that came  under his hand felt his control.    It was his custom when he arose on the morn of Sunday to climb to the  most elevated point of Tara, and gaze thence on every side, so that  he might see if any fairies or people of the Shi' were disporting  themselves in his lordship; for he absolutely prohibited the usage of  the earth to these beings on the Sunday, and woe's worth was it for the  sweet being he discovered breaking his law.    We do not know what ill he could do to the fairies, but during Dermod's  reign the world said its prayers on Sunday and the Shi' folk stayed in  their hills.    It may be imagined, therefore, with what wrath he saw his wife's  preparations for her journey, but, although a king can do everything,  what can a husband do...? He rearranged himself for slumber.    \"I am no party to this untimely journey,\" he said angrily.    \"Let it be so,\" said Becfola.    She left the palace with one maid, and as she crossed the doorway  something happened to her, but by what means it happened would be hard  to tell; for in the one pace she passed out of the palace and out of the  world, and the second step she trod was in Faery, but she did not know  this.    Her intention was to go to Cluain da chaillech to meet Crimthann, but  when she left the palace she did not remember Crimthann any more.    To her eye and to the eye of her maid the world was as it always had  been, and the landmarks they knew were about them. But the object for  which they were travelling was different, although unknown, and the  people they passed on the roads were unknown, and were yet people that  they knew.    They set out southwards from Tara into the Duffry of Leinster, and after  some time they came into wild country and went astray. At last Becfola  halted, saying:    \"I do not know where we are.\"    The maid replied that she also did not know.    \"Yet,\" said Becfola, \"if we continue to walk straight on we shall arrive  somewhere.\"    They went on, and the maid watered the road with her tears.    Night drew on them; a grey chill, a grey silence, and they were  enveloped in that chill and silence; and they began to go in expectation  and terror, for they both knew and did not know that which they were  bound for.    As they toiled desolately up the rustling and whispering side of a  low hill the maid chanced to look back, and when she looked back she  screamed and pointed, and clung to Becfola's arm. Becfola followed the  pointing finger, and saw below a large black mass that moved jerkily  forward.    \"Wolves!\" cried the maid. \"Run to the trees yonder,\" her mistress  ordered. \"We will climb them and sit among the branches.\"    They ran then, the maid moaning and lamenting all the while.    \"I cannot climb a tree,\" she sobbed, \"I shall be eaten by the wolves.\"    And that was true.    But her mistress climbed a tree, and drew by a hand's breadth from the  rap and snap and slaver of those steel jaws. Then, sitting on a branch,  she looked with angry woe at the straining and snarling horde below,  seeing many a white fang in those grinning jowls, and the smouldering,  red blink of those leaping and prowling eyes.        CHAPTER III    But after some time the moon arose and the wolves went away, for their  leader, a sagacious and crafty chief, declared that as long as they  remained where they were, the lady would remain where she was; and so,  with a hearty curse on trees, the troop departed. Becfola had pains in  her legs from the way she had wrapped them about the branch, but there  was no part of her that did not ache, for a lady does not sit with any  ease upon a tree.    For some time she did not care to come down from the branch. \"Those  wolves may return,\" she said, \"for their chief is crafty and sagacious,  and it is certain, from the look I caught in his eye as he departed,  that he would rather taste of me than cat any woman he has met.\"    She looked carefully in every direction to see if one might discover  them in hiding; she looked closely and lingeringly at the shadows under  distant trees to see if these shadows moved; and she listened on every  wind to try if she could distinguish a yap or a yawn or a sneeze. But  she saw or heard nothing; and little by little tranquillity crept into  her mind, and she began to consider that a danger which is past is a  danger that may be neglected.    Yet ere she descended she looked again on the world of jet and silver  that dozed about her, and she spied a red glimmer among distant trees.    \"There is no danger where there is light,\" she said, and she thereupon  came from the tree and ran in the direction that she had noted.    In a spot between three great oaks she came upon a man who was roasting  a wild boar over a fire. She saluted this youth and sat beside him. But  after the first glance and greeting he did not look at her again, nor  did he speak.    When the boar was cooked he ate of it and she had her share. Then he  arose from the fire and walked away among the trees. Becfola followed,  feeling ruefully that something new to her experience had arrived;  \"for,\" she thought, \"it is usual that young men should not speak to me  now that I am the mate of a king, but it is very unusual that young men  should not look at me.\"    But if the young man did not look at her she looked well at him, and  what she saw pleased her so much that she had no time for further  cogitation. For if Crimthann had been beautiful, this youth was ten  times more beautiful. The curls on Crimthann's head had been indeed as  a benediction to the queen's eye, so that she had eaten the better and  slept the sounder for seeing him. But the sight of this youth left her  without the desire to eat, and, as for sleep, she dreaded it, for if she  closed an eye she would be robbed of the one delight in time, which was  to look at this young man, and not to cease looking at him while her eye  could peer or her head could remain upright.    They came to an inlet of the sea all sweet and calm under the round,  silver-flooding moon, and the young man, with Becfola treading on his  heel, stepped into a boat and rowed to a high-jutting, pleasant island.  There they went inland towards a vast palace, in which there was no  person but themselves alone, and there the young man went to sleep,  while Becfola sat staring at him until the unavoidable peace pressed  down her eyelids and she too slumbered.    She was awakened in the morning by a great shout.    \"Come out, Flann, come out, my heart!\"    The young man leaped from his couch, girded on his harness, and strode  out. Three young men met him, each in battle harness, and these four  advanced to meet four other men who awaited them at a little distance on  the lawn. Then these two sets of four fought togethor with every warlike  courtesy but with every warlike severity, and at the end of that combat  there was but one man standing, and the other seven lay tossed in death.    Becfola spoke to the youth.    \"Your combat has indeed been gallant,\" she said.    \"Alas,\" he replied, \"if it has been a gallant deed it has not been a  good one, for my three brothers are dead and my four nephews are dead.\"    \"Ah me!\" cried Becfola, \"why did you fight that fight?\"    \"For the lordship of this island, the Isle of Fedach, son of Dali.\"    But, although Becfola was moved and horrified by this battle, it was in  another direction that her interest lay; therefore she soon asked the  question which lay next her heart:    \"Why would you not speak to me or look at me?\"    \"Until I have won the kingship of this land from all claimants, I am no  match for the mate of the High King of Ireland,\" he replied.    And that reply was llke balm to the heart of Becfola.    \"What shall I do?\" she inquired radiantly. \"Return to your home,\" he  counselled. \"I will escort you there with your maid, for she is not  really dead, and when I have won my lordship I will go seek you in  Tara.\"    \"You will surely come,\" she insisted.    \"By my hand,\" quoth he, \"I will come.\"    These three returned then, and at the end of a day and night they saw  far off the mighty roofs of Tara massed in the morning haze. The  young man left them, and with many a backward look and with dragging,  reluctant feet, Becfola crossed the threshold of the palace, wondering  what she should say to Dermod and how she could account for an absence  of three days' duration.        CHAPTER IV    IT was so early that not even a bird was yet awake, and the dull grey  light that came from the atmosphere enlarged and made indistinct all  that one looked at, and swathed all things in a cold and livid gloom.    As she trod cautiously through dim corridors Becfola was glad that,  saving the guards, no creature was astir, and that for some time yet  she need account to no person for her movements. She was glad also of  a respite which would enable her to settle into her home and draw about  her the composure which women feel when they are surrounded by the walls  of their houses, and can see about them the possessions which, by the  fact of ownership, have become almost a part of their personality.  Sundered from her belongings, no woman is tranquil, her heart is not  truly at ease, however her mind may function, so that under the broad  sky or in the house of another she is not the competent, precise  individual which she becomes when she sees again her household in order  and her"]]]
