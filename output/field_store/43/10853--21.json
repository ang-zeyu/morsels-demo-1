The doctor had  packed the case among his clothing in the middle of his trunk, and had  taken every possible precaution, but, as usual upon such occasions, the  most important instrument had rusted at the point, and in that state  was utterly useless. There was no cutler in the place, nor any other  person competent to touch it. Mr. Catherwood, however, brought out an  old razor hone, and between them they worked off the rust.    At ten o'clock the doctor's subject made his appearance. He was the son  of a widow lady of very respectable family, about fourteen years old,  but small of stature, and presenting even to the most casual glance the  stamp of a little gentleman. He had large black eyes, but, unluckily,  their expression was very much injured by an inward squint. With the  light heart of boyhood, however, he seemed indifferent to his personal  appearance, and came, as he said, because his mother told him to do so.  His handsome person, and modest and engaging manners, gave us  immediately a strong interest in his favour. He was accompanied by the  gentleman who had spoken of bringing him, Dr. Bado, a Guatimalian  educated in Paris, the oldest and principal physician of Merida, and by  several friends of the family, whom we did not know.    Preparations were commenced immediately. The first movement was to  bring out a long table near the window; then to spread upon it a  mattress and pillow, and upon these to spread the boy. Until the actual  moment of operating, the precise character of this new business had not  presented itself to my mind, and altogether it opened by no means so  favourably as Daguerreotype practice.    Not aiming to be technical, but desiring to give the reader the benefit  of such scraps of learning as I pick up in my travels, modern science  has discovered that the eye is retained in its orbit by six muscles,  which pull it up and down, inward and outward, and that the undue  contraction of either of these muscles produces that obliquity called  squinting, which was once supposed to proceed from convulsions in  childhood, or other unknown causes. The cure discovered is the cutting  of the contracted muscle, by means of which the eye falls immediately  into its proper place. This muscle lies under the surface; and, as it  is necessary to pass through a membrane of the eye, the cutting cannot  be done with a broadaxe or a handsaw. In fact, it requires a knowledge  of the anatomy of the eye, manual dexterity, fine instruments, and Mr.  Catherwood and myself for assistants.    Our patient remained perfectly quiet, with his little hands folded  across his breast; but while the knife was cutting through the muscle  he gave one groan, so piteous and heart-rending, that it sent into the  next room all who were not immediately engaged. But before the sound of  the groan had died away the operation was over, and the boy rose with  his eye bleeding, but perfectly straight. A bandage was tied over it,  and, with a few directions for its treatment, amid the congratulations  and praises of all present, and wearing the same smile with which he  had entered, the little fellow walked off to his mother.    The news of this wonder spread rapidly, and before night Dr. Cabot had  numerous and pressing applications, among which was one from a  gentleman whom we were all desirous to oblige, and who had this defect  in both eyes.    On his account we determined to postpone our departure another day;  and, in furtherance of his original purpose, Dr. Cabot mentioned that  he would perform the operation upon all who chose to offer. We  certainly took no trouble to spread this notice, but the next morning,  when we returned from breakfast, there was a gathering of squint-eyed  boys around the door, who, with their friends and backers, made a  formidable appearance, and almost obstructed our entrance. As soon as  the door opened there was a rush inside; and as some of these slanting  eyes might not be able to distinguish between meum and tuum, we were  obliged to help their proprietors out into the street again.    At ten o'clock the big table was drawn up to the window, and the  mattress and pillow were spread upon it, but there was such a gathering  around the window that we had to hang up a sheet before it. Invitations  had been given to Dr. Bado and Dr. Munoz, and all physicians who chose  to come, and having met the governor in the evening, I had asked him to  be present. These all honoured us with their company, together with a  number of self-invited persons, who had introduced themselves, and  could not well be turned out, making quite a crowded room.    The first who presented himself was a stout lad about nineteen or  twenty, whom we had never seen or heard of before. Who he was or where  he came from we did not know, but he was a bisco of the worst kind, and  seemed able-bodied enough to undergo anything in the way of surgery. As  soon as the doctor began to cut the muscle, however, our strapping  patient gave signs of restlessness; and all at once, with an actual  bellow, he jerked his head on one side, carried away the doctor's hook,  and shut his eye upon it with a sort of lockjaw grip, as if determined  it should never be drawn out. How my hook got out I have no idea;  fortunately, the doctor let his go, or the lad's eye would have been  scratched out. As it was, there he sat with the bandage slipped above  one eye, and the other closed upon the hook, the handle of which stood  out straight. Probably at that moment he would have been willing to  sacrifice pride of personal appearance, keep his squint, and go through  life with his eye shut, the hook in it, and the handle sticking out;  but the instrument was too valuable to be lost. And it was interesting  and instructive to notice the difference between the equanimity of one  who had a hook in his eye, and that of lookers-on who had not. All the  spectators upbraided him with his cowardice and want of heart, and  after a round of reproof to which he could make no answer, he opened  his eye and let out the hook. But he had made a bad business of it. A  few seconds longer, and the operation would have been completed. As it  was, the whole work had to be repeated. As the muscle was again lifted  under the knife, I thought I saw a glare in the eyeball that gave token  of another fling of the head, but the lad was fairly browbeaten into  quiet; and, to the great satisfaction of all, with a double share of  blackness and blood, and with very little sympathy from any one, but  with his eye straight, he descended from the table. Outside he was  received with a loud shout by the boys, and we never heard of him  again.    The room was now full of people, and, being already disgusted with the  practice of surgery, I sincerely hoped that this exhibition would cure  all others of a wish to undergo the operation, but a little Mestizo  boy, about ten years old, who had been present all the time, crept  through the crowd, and, reaching the table, squinted up at us without  speaking, his crisscross expression telling us very plainly what he  wanted. He had on the usual Mestizo dress of cotton shirt and drawers  and straw hat, and seemed so young, simple, and innocent, that we did  not consider him capable of judging for himself. We told him he must  not be operated on, but he answered, in a decided though modest tone,  \"Yo quiero, yo quiero,\" \"I wish it, I wish it.\" We inquired if there  was any one present who had any authority over him, and a man whom we  had not noticed before, dressed, like him, in shirt and drawers,  stepped forward and said he was the boy's father; he had brought him  there himself on purpose, and begged Doctor Cabot to proceed. By his  father's directions, the little fellow attempted to climb up on the  table, but his legs were too short, and he had to be lifted up. His eye  was bandaged, and his head placed upon the pillow. He folded his hands  across his breast, turned his eye, did in all things exactly as he was  directed, and in half a minute the operation was finished. I do not  believe that he changed his position a hair's breadth or moved a  muscle. It was an extraordinary instance of fortitude. The spectators  were all admiration, and, amid universal congratulation, he was lifted  from the table, his eye bound up, and, without a word, but with the  spirit of a little hero, he took his father's hand and went away.    At this time, amid a press of applicants, a gentleman came to inform us  that a young lady was waiting her turn. This gave us an excuse for  clearing the room, and we requested all except the medical gentlemen  and the immediate friends to favour us with their absence. Such was the  strange curiosity these people had for seeing a most disagreeable  spectacle, that they were very slow in going away, and some slipped  into the other rooms and the yard, but we ferreted them out, and got  the room somewhat to ourselves.    The young lady was accompanied by her mother. She was full of  hesitation and fears, anxious to be relieved, but doubting her ability  to endure the pain, and the moment she saw the instruments, her courage  entirely forsook her. Doctor Cabot discouraged all who had any distrust  of their own fortitude, and, to my mingled joy and regret, she went  away.    The next in order was the gentleman on whose account we had postponed  our departure. He was the oldest general in the Mexican service, but  for two years an exile in Merida. By the late revolution, which placed  Santa Ana in power, his party was uppermost; and he had strong claims  upon our good feelings, for, in a form expatriation from Mexico,  he had served as volunteer aid to General Jackson at the battle of  New-Orleans. This gentleman had an inward squint in both eyes, which,  however, instead of being a defect, gave character to his face; but his  sight was injured by it, and this Doctor Cabot thought"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3317"],[0,"Now It Can Be Told (#17)"],[1,"  There were mascots for luck, at the doorways of their dugouts--a woman's  face carved in chalk, the name of a girl written in pebbles, a portrait  of the King in a frame of withered wild flowers.    A company of our New Army boys had respected a memento of French troops  who were once in this section of trenches. It was an altar built  into the side of the trench, where mass was said each morning by a  soldier--priest. It was decorated with vases and candlesticks, and above  the altar-table was a statue, crudely modeled, upon the base of which I  read the words Notre Dame des Tranchees (\"Our Lady of the Trenches\"). A  tablet fastened in the earth-wall recorded in French the desire of those  who worshiped here:    \"This altar, dedicated to Our Lady of the Trenches, was blessed by the  chaplain of the French regiment. The 9th Squadron of the 6th Company  recommends its care and preservation to their successors. Please do not  touch the fragile statue in trench-clay.\"    \"Our Lady of the Trenches!\" It was the first time I had heard of this  new title of the Madonna, whose spirit, if she visited those ditches of  death, must have wept with pity for all those poor children of mankind  whose faith was so unlike the work they had to do.    From a dugout near the altar there came tinkling music. A young soldier  was playing the mandolin to two comrades. \"All the latest ragtime,\" said  one of them with a grin.    So we paddled on our way, glimpsing every now and then over the parapets  at the German lines a few hundred yards away, and at a village in which  the enemy was intrenched, quiet and sinister there. The water through  which we waded was alive with a multitude of swimming frogs. Red  slugs crawled up the sides of the trenches, and queer beetles with  dangerous-looking horns wriggled along dry ledges and invaded the  dugouts in search of the vermin which infested them.    \"Rats are the worst plague,\" said a colonel, coming out of the battalion  headquarters, where he had a hole large enough for a bed and table.  \"There are thousands of rats in this part of the line, and they're  audacious devils. In the dugout next door the straw at night writhes  with them... I don't mind the mice so much. One of them comes to dinner  on my table every evening, a friendly little beggar who is very pally  with me.\"    We looked out above the mine-craters, a chaos of tumbled earth, where  our trenches ran so close to the enemy's that it was forbidden to smoke  or talk, and where our sappers listened with all their souls in their  ears to any little tapping or picking which might signal approaching  upheaval. The coats of some French soldiers, blown up long ago by some  of these mines, looked like the blue of the chicory flower growing in  the churned-up soil... The new mine was not fired that afternoon, up  to the time of my going away. But it was fired next day, and I wondered  whether the gloomy boy had gone up with it. There was a foreknowledge of  death in his eyes.    One of the officers had spoken to me privately.    \"I'm afraid of losing my nerve before the men. It haunts me, that  thought. The shelling is bad enough, but it's the mining business that  wears one's nerve to shreds. One never knows.\"    I hated to leave him there to his agony... The colonel himself was  all nerves, and he loathed the rats as much as the shell-fire and the  mining, those big, lean, hungry rats of the trenches, who invaded the  dugouts and frisked over the bodies of sleeping men. One young subaltern  was in terror of them. He told me how he shot at one, seeing the glint  of its eyes in the darkness. The bullet from his revolver ricocheted  from wall to wall, and he was nearly court-martialed for having fired.    The rats, the lice that lived on the bodies of our men, the water-logged  trenches, the shell-fire which broke down the parapets and buried men in  wet mud, wetter for their blood, the German snipers waiting for English  heads, and then the mines--oh, a cheery little school of courage for  the sons of gentlemen! A gentle academy of war for the devil and General  Squeers!          VII      The city of Ypres was the capital of our battlefields in Flanders from  the beginning to the end of the war, and the ground on which it stands,  whether a new city rises there or its remnants of ruin stay as a  memorial of dreadful things, will be forever haunted by the spirit of  those men of ours who passed through its gates to fight in the fields  beyond or to fall within its ramparts.    I went through Ypres so many times in early days and late days of the  war that I think I could find my way about it blindfold, even now. I saw  it first in March of 1915, before the battle when the Germans first  used poison-gas and bombarded its choking people, and French and British  soldiers, until the city fell into a chaos of masonry. On that first  visit I found it scarred by shell--fire, and its great Cloth Hall was  roofless and licked out by the flame of burning timbers, but most of the  buildings were still standing and the shops were busy with customers  in khaki, and in the Grande Place were many small booths served by the  women and girls who sold picture post-cards and Flemish lace and fancy  cakes and soap to British soldiers sauntering about without a thought of  what might happen here in this city, so close to the enemy's lines, so  close to his guns. I had tea in a bun-shop, crowded with young officers,  who were served by two Flemish girls, buxom, smiling, glad of all the  English money they were making.    A few weeks later the devil came to Ypres. The first sign of his work  was when a mass of French soldiers and colored troops, and English,  Irish, Scottish, and Canadian soldiers came staggering through the Lille  and Menin gates with panic in their look, and some foul spell upon them.  They were gasping for breath, vomiting, falling into unconsciousness,  and, as they lay, their lungs were struggling desperately against some  stifling thing. A whitish cloud crept up to the gates of Ypres, with a  sweet smell of violets, and women and girls smelled it and then gasped  and lurched as they ran and fell. It was after that when shells came in  hurricane flights over Ypres, smashing the houses and setting them  on fire, until they toppled and fell inside themselves. Hundreds of  civilians hid in their cellars, and many were buried there. Others  crawled into a big drain-pipe--there were wounded women and children  among them, and a young French interpreter, the Baron de Rosen, who  tried to help them--and they stayed there three days and nights, in  their vomit and excrement and blood, until the bombardment ceased. Ypres  was a city of ruin, with a red fire in its heart where the Cloth Hall  and cathedral smoldered below their broken arches and high ribs of  masonry that had been their buttresses and towers.    When I went there two months later I saw Ypres as it stood through the  years of the war that followed, changing only in the disintegration of  its ruin as broken walls became more broken and fallen houses were raked  into smaller fragments by new bombardments, for there was never a day  for years in which Ypres was not shelled.    The approach to it was sinister after one had left Poperinghe and passed  through the skeleton of Vlamertinghe church, beyond Goldfish Chateau...  For a long time Poperinghe was the last link with a life in which men  and women could move freely without hiding from the pursuit of death;  and even there, from time to time, there were shells from long-range  guns and, later, night-birds dropping high-explosive eggs. Round about  Poperinghe, by Reninghelst and Locre, long convoys of motor-wagons,  taking up a new day's rations from the rail-heads, raised clouds of dust  which powdered the hedges white. Flemish cart-horses with huge  fringes of knotted string wended their way between motor-lorries and  gun-limbers. Often the sky was blue above the hop-gardens, with fleecy  clouds over distant woodlands and the gray old towers of Flemish  churches and the windmills on Mont Rouge and Mont Neir, whose sails have  turned through centuries of peace and strife. It all comes back to me as  I write--that way to Ypres, and the sounds and the smells of the roads  and fields where the traffic of war went up, month after month, year  after year.    That day when I saw it first, after the gas-attack, was strangely quiet,  I remember. There was \"nothing doing,\" as our men used to say. The  German gunners seemed asleep in the noonday sun, and it was a charming  day for a stroll and a talk about the raving madness of war under every  old hedge.    \"What about lunch in Dickebusch on the way up?\" asked one of my  companions. There were three of us.    It seemed a good idea, and we walked toward the village which then--they  were early days!--looked a peaceful spot, with a shimmer of sunshine  above its gray thatch and red-tiled roofs.    Suddenly one of us said, \"Good God!\"    An iron door had slammed down the corridors of the sky and the hamlet  into which we were just going was blotted out by black smoke, which came  up from its center as though its market-place had opened up and vomited  out infernal vapors.    \"A big shell that!\" said one man, a tall, lean-limbed officer, who later  in the war was sniper-in-chief of the British army. Something enraged  him at the sight of that shelled village.    \"Damn them!\" he said. \"Damn the war! Damn all dirty dogs who smash up  life!\"    Four times the thing happened, and we were glad there had been a minute  or so between us and Dickebusch. (In Dickebusch my young cobbler friend  from Fleet Street was crouching low, expecting death.) The peace of the  day was spoiled. There was seldom a real peace on the way to Ypres. The  German gunners had wakened up again. They always did. They were getting  busy, those house-wreckers. The long rush of shells tore great holes  through the air. Under"]]]
