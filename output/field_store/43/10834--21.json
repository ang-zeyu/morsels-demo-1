The teacher of  Christian Science needs continually to study this textbook.  His work is to replenish thought, and to spiritualize human  life, from this open fount of Truth and Love.    He who sees most clearly and enlightens other minds [10]  most readily, keeps his own lamp trimmed and burning.  He will take the textbook of Christian Science into his  class, repeat the questions in the chapter on Recapitula-  tion, and his students will answer them from the same  source. Throughout his entire explanations, the teacher [15]  should strictly adhere to the questions and answers con-  tained in that chapter of \"Science and Health with Key  to the Scriptures.\" It is important to point out the  lesson to the class, and to require the students thor-  oughly to study it before the recitations; for this spirit- [20]  ualizes their thoughts. When closing his class, the  teacher should require each member to own a copy of  the above-named book and to continue the study of this  textbook.    The opinions of men cannot be substituted for God's [25]  revelation. It must not be forgotten that in times past,  arrogant ignorance and pride, in attempting to steady  the ark of Truth, have dimmed the power and glory of  the Scriptures, to which this Christian Science textbook  is the Key. [30]    That teacher does most for his students who most  divests himself of pride and self, spiritualizes his own    [Page 93.]    thought, and by reason thereof is able to empty his stu- [1]  dents' minds, that they may be filled with Truth.    Beloved students, _so_ teach that posterity shall call  you blessed, and the heart of history shall be made  glad! [5]    _Can fear or sin bring back old beliefs of disease that have_  _been healed by Christian Science?_    The Scriptures plainly declare the allness and oneness  of God to be the premises of Truth, and that God is  good: in Him dwelleth no evil. Christian Science au- [10]  thorizes the logical conclusion drawn from the Scriptures,  that there is in reality none besides the eternal, infinite  God, good. Evil is temporal: it is the illusion of time  and mortality.    This being true, sin has no power; and fear, its coeval, [15]  is without divine authority. Science sanctions only what  is supported by the unerring Principle of being. Sin can  do nothing: all cause and effect are in God. Fear is a  belief of sensation in matter: this belief is neither main-  tained by Science nor supported by facts, and exists only [20]  as fable. Your answer is, that neither fear nor sin can  bring on disease or bring back disease, since there is in  reality no disease.    Bear in mind, however, that human consciousness does  not test sin and the fact of its nothingness, by believing [25]  that sin is pardoned without repentance and reforma-  tion. Sin punishes itself, because it cannot go unpun-  ished either here or hereafter. Nothing is more fatal than  to indulge a sinning sense or consciousness for even one  moment. Knowing this, obey Christ's Sermon on the [30]  Mount, even if you suffer for it in the first instance,--    [Page 94.]    are misjudged and maligned; in the second, you will [1]  reign with him.    I never knew a person who knowingly indulged evil,  to be grateful; to understand me, or himself. He must  first see himself and the hallucination of sin; then he [5]  must repent, and love good in order to understand God.  The sinner and the sin are the twain that are one flesh,--  but which God hath not joined together.            CHAPTER IV. ADDRESSES.      [Page 95.]          Christian Science In Tremont Temple.      From the platform of the Monday lectureship in [2]  Tremont Temple, on Monday, March 16, 1885, as  will be seen by what follows. Reverend Mary Baker G.  Eddy was presented to Mr. Cook's audience, and allowed [5]  ten minutes in which to reply to his public letter con-  demning her doctrines; which reply was taken in full by  a shorthand reporter who was present, and is transcribed  below.    Mrs. Eddy responding, said:-- [10]    As the time so kindly allotted me is insufficient for  even a synopsis of Christian Science, I shall confine my-  self to questions and answers.    Am I a spiritualist?    I am not, and never was. I understand the impossi- [15]  bility of intercommunion between the so-called dead and  living. There have always attended my life phenomena  of an uncommon order, which spiritualists have mis-  called mediumship; but I clearly understand that no  human agencies were employed,--that the divine Mind [20]  reveals itself to humanity through spiritual law. And  to such as are \"waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption  of our body,\" Christian Science reveals the in-    [Page 96.]    finitude of divinity and the way of man's salvation from [1]  sickness and death, as wrought out by Jesus, who robbed  the grave of victory and death of its sting. I understand  that God is an ever-present help in all times of trouble,--  have found Him so; and would have no other gods, no [5]  remedies in drugs, no material medicine.    Do I believe in a personal God?    I believe in God as the Supreme Being. I know not  what the person of omnipotence and omnipresence is,  or what the infinite includes; therefore, I worship that [10]  of which I can conceive, first, as a loving Father and  Mother; then, as thought ascends the scale of being to  diviner consciousness, God becomes to me, as to the  apostle who declared it, \"God is Love,\"--divine Prin-  ciple,--which I worship; and \"after the manner of my [15]  fathers, so worship I God.\"    Do I believe in the atonement of Christ?    I do; and this atonement becomes more to me since  it includes man's redemption from sickness as well as  from sin. I reverence and adore Christ as never before. [20]    It brings to my sense, and to the sense of all who enter-  tain this understanding of the Science of God, a _whole_  salvation.    How is the healing done in Christian Science?    This answer includes too much to give you any con- [25]  clusive idea in a brief explanation. I can name some  means by which it is not done.    It is not one mind acting upon another mind; it is  not the transference of human images of thought to  other minds; it is not supported by the evidence before [30]  the personal senses,--Science contradicts this evidence;  it is not of the flesh, but of the Spirit. It is Christ come    [Page 97.]    to destroy the power of the flesh; it is Truth over error; [1]  that understood, gives man ability to rise above the evi-  dence of the senses, take hold of the eternal energies of  Truth, and destroy mortal discord with immortal har-  mony,--the grand verities of being. It is not one mortal [5]  thought transmitted to another's thought from the human  mind that holds within itself all evil.    Our Master said of one of his students, \"He is a devil,\"  and repudiated the idea of casting out devils through  Beelzebub. Erring human mind is by no means a de- [10]  sirable or efficacious healer. Such suppositional healing  I deprecate. It is in no way allied to divine power. All  human control is animal magnetism, more despicable  than all other methods of treating disease.    Christian Science is not a remedy of faith alone, but [15]  combines faith with understanding, through which we  may touch the hem of His garment; and know that om-  nipotence has all power. \"I am the Lord, and there is  none else, there is no God beside me.\"    Is there a personal man? [20]    The Scriptures inform us that man was made in the  image and likeness of God. I commend the Icelandic  translation: \"He created man in the image and likeness  of Mind, in the image and likeness of Mind created  He him.\" To my sense, we have not seen all of man; [25]  he is more than personal sense can cognize, who is the  image and likeness of the infinite. I have not seen a  perfect man in mind or body,--and such must be the  personality of him who is the true likeness: the lost  image is not this personality, and corporeal man is this [30]  lost image; hence, it doth not appear what is the real  personality of man. The only cause for making this    [Page 98.]    question of personality a point, or of any importance, is [1]  that man's perfect model should be held in mind, whereby  to improve his present condition; that his contemplation  regarding himself should turn away from inharmony, sick-  ness, and sin, to that which is the image of his Maker. [5]          Science And The Senses.      Substance of my Address at the National Convention in Chicago,  June 13, 1888    The National Christian Scientist Association has  brought us together to minister and to be ministered [10]  unto; mutually to aid one another in finding ways and  means for helping the whole human family; to quicken  and extend the interest already felt in a higher mode of  medicine; to watch with eager joy the individual growth  of Christian Scientists, and the progress of our common [15]  Cause in Chicago,--the miracle of the Occident. We  come to strengthen and perpetuate our organizations  and institutions; and to find strength in union,--strength  to build up, through God's right hand, that pure and  undefiled religion whose Science demonstrates God and [20]  the perfectibility of man. This purpose is immense,  and it must begin with individual growth, a \"consum-  mation devoutly to be wished.\" The lives of all re-  formers attest the authenticity of their mission, and call  the world to acknowledge its divine Principle. Truly [25]  is it written:--    \"Thou must be true thyself, if thou the truth would'st teach;  Thy heart must overflow, if thou another's heart would'st reach.\"    [Page 99.]    Science is absolute and final. It is revolutionary in [1]  its very nature; for it upsets all that is not upright.  It annuls false evidence, and saith to the five material  senses, \"Having eyes ye see not, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31511"],[0,"A History of Witchcraft in England from 1558 to 1718 (#17)"],[1,"Darrel's story of the affair,[17] William  Somers had nine years before met an old woman who had threatened him.  Again, more than a year before Darrel came to Nottingham, Somers had had  two encounters with a strange woman \"at a deep cole-pit, hard by the  way-side.\" Soon afterwards he \"did use such strang and idle kinde of  gestures in laughing, dancing and such like lighte behaviour, that he  was suspected to be madd.\" He began to suffer from bodily distortions  and to evince other signs of possession which created no little  excitement in Nottingham.    Darrel had been sent for by this time. He came at once and with his  usual precipitancy pronounced the case one of possession. Somers, he  said, was suffering for the sins of Nottingham.[18] It was time that  something should be done. Prayer and fasting were instituted. For three  days the youth was preached to and prayed over, while the people of  Nottingham, or some of them at least, joined in the fast. On the third  day came what was deemed a most remarkable exhibition. The preacher  named slowly, one after another, fourteen signs of possession. As he  named them Somers illustrated in turn each form of possession.[19] Here  was confirmatory evidence of a high order. The exorcist had outdone  himself. He now held out promises of deliverance for the subject. For a  quarter of an hour the boy lay as if dead, and then rose up quite well.    Darrel now took up again the witchfinder's role he had once before  assumed. Somers was encouraged to name the contrivers of his  bewitchment. Through him, Darrel is said to have boasted, they would  expose all the witches in England.[20] They made a most excellent start  at it. Thirteen women were accused by the boy,[21] who would fall into  fits at the sight of a witch, and a general invitation was extended to  prefer charges. But the community was becoming a bit incredulous and  failed to respond. All but two of the accused women were released.    The witch-discoverer, who in the meantime had been chosen preacher at  St. Mary's in Nottingham, made two serious mistakes. He allowed  accusations to be preferred against Alice Freeman, sister of an  alderman,[22] and he let Somers be taken out of his hands. By the  contrivance of some citizens who doubted the possession, Somers was  placed in the house of correction, on a trumped-up charge that he had  bewitched a Mr. Sterland to death.[23] Removed from the clergyman's  influence, he made confession that his possessions were pretended.[24]  Darrel, he declared, had taught him how to pretend. The matter had now  gained wide notoriety and was taken up by the Anglican church. The  archdeacon of Derby reported the affair to his superiors, and the  Archbishop of York appointed a commission to examine into the case.[25]  Whether from alarm or because he had anew come under Darrel's influence,  Somers refused to confess before the commission and again acted out his  fits with such success that the commission seems to have been convinced  of the reality of his possession.[26] This was a notable victory for the  exorcist.    But Chief-Justice Anderson of the court of common pleas was now  commencing the assizes at Nottingham and was sitting in judgment on the  case of Alice Freeman. Anderson was a man of intense convictions. He  believed in the reality of witchcraft and had earlier sent at least one  witch to the gallows[27] and one to prison.[28] But he was a man who  hated Puritanism with all his heart, and would at once have suspected  Puritan exorcism. Whether because the arch-instigator against Alice  Freeman was a Puritan, or because the evidence adduced against her was  flimsy, or because Somers, again summoned to court, acknowledged his  fraud,[29] or for all these reasons, Anderson not only dismissed the  case,[30] but he wrote a letter about it to the Archbishop of  Canterbury. Archbishop Whitgift called Darrel and More before the court  of high commission, where the Bishop of London, two of the Lord  Chief-Justices, the master of requests, and other eminent officials  heard the case. It seems fairly certain that Bancroft, the Bishop of  London, really took control of this examination and that he acted quite  as much the part of a prosecutor as that of a judge. One of Darrel's  friends complained bitterly that the exorcist was not allowed to make  \"his particular defences\" but \"was still from time to time cut off by  the Lord Bishop of London.\"[31] No doubt the bishop may have been  somewhat arbitrary. It was his privilege under the procedure of the  high commission court, and he was dealing with one whom he deemed a very  evident impostor. In fine, a verdict was rendered against the two  clergymen. They were deposed from the ministry and put in close  prison.[32] So great was the stir they had caused that in 1599 Samuel  Harsnett, chaplain to the Bishop of London, published _A Discovery of  the Fraudulent Practises of John Darrel_, a careful resume of the entire  case, with a complete exposure of Darrel's trickery. In this account the  testimony of Somers was given as to the origin of his possession. He  testified before the ecclesiastical court that he had known Darrel  several years before they had met at Nottingham. At their first meeting  he promised, declared Somers, \"to tell me some thinges, wherein if I  would be ruled by him, I should not be driven to goe so barely as I  did.\" Darrel related to Somers the story of Katherine Wright and her  possession, and remarked, \"If thou wilt sweare unto me to keepe my  counsell, I will teache thee to doe all those trickes which Katherine  Wright did, and many others that are more straunge.\" He then illustrated  some of the tricks for the benefit of his pupil and gave him a written  paper of directions. From that time on there were meetings between the  two at various places. The pupil, however, was not altogether successful  with his fits and was once turned out of service as a pretender. He was  then apprenticed to the musician already mentioned, and again met  Darrel, who urged him to go and see Thomas Darling of Burton, \"because,\"  says Somers, \"that seeing him in his fittes, I might the better learn to  do them myselfe.\" Somers met Darrel again and went through with a  series of tricks of possession. It was after all these meetings and  practice that Somers began his career as a possessed person in  Nottingham and was prayed over by Mr. Darrel. Such at least was his  story as told to the ecclesiastical commission. It would be hazardous to  say that the narrative was all true. Certainly it was accepted by  Harsnett, who may be called the official reporter of the proceedings at  Darrel's trial, as substantially true.[33]    The publication of the _Discovery_ by Harsnett proved indeed to be only  the beginning of a pamphlet controversy which Darrel and his supporters  were but too willing to take up.[34] Harsnett himself after his first  onslaught did not re-enter the contest. The semi-official character of  his writing rendered it unnecessary to refute the statements of a  convicted man. At any rate, he was soon occupied with another production  of similar aim. In 1602 Bishop Bancroft was busily collecting the  materials, in the form of sworn statements, for the exposure of Catholic  pretenders. He turned the material over to his chaplain. Whether the  several examinations of Roman exorcists and their subjects were the  result of a new interest in exposing exorcism on the part of the powers  which had sent Darrel to prison, or whether they were merely a phase of  increased vigilance against the activity of the Roman priests, we cannot  be sure. The first conclusion does not seem improbable. Be that as it  may, the court of high commission got hold of evidence enough to  justify the privy council in authorizing a full publication of the  testimony.[35] Harsnett was deputed to write the account of the Catholic  exorcists which was brought out in 1603 under the title of _A  Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures_. We have not the historical  materials with which to verify the claims made in the book. On the face  of it the case against the Roman priests looks bad. A mass of  examinations was printed which seem to show that the Jesuit Weston and  his confreres in England had been guilty of a great deal of jugglery and  pretence. The Jesuits, however, were wiser in their generation than the  Puritans and had not made charges of witchcraft. For that reason their  performances may be passed over.    Neither the pretences of the Catholics nor the refutation of them are  very important for our purposes. The exposure of John Darrel was of  significance, because it involved the guilt or innocence of the women he  accused as witches, as well as because the ecclesiastical authorities  took action against him and thereby levelled a blow directly at exorcism  and possession[36] and indirectly at loose charges of witchcraft.  Harsnett's books were the outcome of this affair and the ensuing  exposures of the Catholics, and they were more significant than  anything that had gone before. The Church of England had not committed  itself very definitely on witchcraft, but its spokesman in the attack  upon the Catholic pretenders took no uncertain ground. He was skeptical  not only about exorcism but about witchcraft as well. It is refreshing  and inspiriting to read his hard-flung and pungent words. \"Out of  these,\" he wrote, \"is shaped us the true _Idea_ of a Witch, an old  weather-beaten Croane, having her chinne and her knees meeting for age,  walking like a bow leaning on a shaft, hollow-eyed, untoothed, furrowed  on her face, having her lips trembling with the palsie, going mumbling  in the streetes, one that hath forgotten her _pater noster_, and hath  yet a shrewd tongue in her head, to call a drab, a drab. If shee have  learned of an olde wife in a chimnies end: _Pax, max, fax_, for a spel:  or can say _Sir John of Grantams_ curse,"]]]
