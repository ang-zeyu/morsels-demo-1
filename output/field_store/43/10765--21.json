The two new dignitaries,  having secured Khalid Effendi as a partisan, resolved to profit by his  influence to carry out their plans of vengeance on the Tepelenian  family. The news of Pacho Bey's promotion roused Ali from the security  in which he was plunged, and he fell a prey to the most lively anxiety.  Comprehending at once the evil which this man,--trained in his own  school, might cause him, he exclaimed, \"Ah! if Heaven would only restore  me the strength of my youth, I would plunge my sword into his heart even  in the midst of the Divan.\"    It was not long before Ali's enemies found an extremely suitable  opportunity for opening their attack. Veli Pacha, who had for his own  profit increased the Thessalian taxation fivefold, had in doing so  caused so much oppression that many of the inhabitants preferred the  griefs and dangers of emigration rather than remain under so tyrannical  a rule. A great number of Greeks sought refuge at Odessa, and the great  Turkish families assembled round Pacho Bey and Abdi Effendi at  Constantinople, who lost no opportunity of interceding in their favour.  The sultan, who as yet did not dare to act openly against the Tepelenian  family, was at least able to relegate Veli to the obscure post of  Lepanto, and Veli, much disgusted, was obliged to obey. He quitted the  new palace he had just built at Rapehani, and betook himself to the  place of exile, accompanied by actors, Bohemian dancers, bear leaders,  and a crowd of prostitutes.    Thus attacked in the person of his most powerful son, Ali thought to  terrify his enemies by a daring blow. He sent three Albanians to  Constantinople to assassinate Pacho Bey. They fell upon him as he was  proceeding to the Mosque of Saint-Sophia, on the day on which the sultan  also went in order to be present at the Friday ceremonial prayer, and  fired several shots at him. He was wounded, but not mortally.    The assassins, caught red-handed, were hung at the gate of the Imperial  Seraglio, but not before confessing that they were sent by the Pacha of  Janina. The Divan, comprehending at last that so dangerous a man must be  dealt with at any cost, recapitulated all Ali's crimes, and pronounced a  sentence against him which was confirmed by a decree of the Grand Mufti.  It set forth that Ali Tepelen, having many times obtained pardon for his  crimes, was now guilty of high treason in the first degree, and that he  would, as recalcitrant, be placed under the ban of the Empire if he did  not within forty days appear at the Gilded Threshold of the Felicitous  Gate of the Monarch who dispenses crowns to the princes who reign in  this world, in order to justify himself. As may be supposed, submission  to such an order was about the last thing Ali contemplated. As he failed  to appear, the Divan caused the Grand Mufti to launch the thunder of  excommunication against him.    Ali had just arrived at Parga, which he now saw for the third time since  he had obtained it, when his secretaries informed him that only the rod  of Moses could save him from the anger of Pharaoh--a figurative mode of  warning him that he had nothing to hope for. But Ali, counting on his  usual luck, persisted in imagining that he could, once again, escape  from his difficulty by the help of gold and intrigue. Without  discontinuing the pleasures in which he was immersed, he contented  himself with sending presents and humble petitions to Constantinople.  But both were alike useless, for no one even ventured to transmit them  to the sultan, who had sworn to cut off the head of anyone who dared  mention the name of Ali Tepelen in his presence.    Receiving no answer to his overtures, Ali became a prey to terrible  anxiety. As he one day opened the Koran to consult it as to his future,  his divining rod stopped at verse 82, chap. xix., which says, \"He doth  flatter himself in vain. He shall appear before our tribunal naked and  bare.\" Ali closed the book and spat three times into his bosom. He was  yielding to the most dire presentiments, when a courier, arriving from  the capital, informed him that all hope of pardon was lost.    He ordered his galley to be immediately prepared, and left his seraglio,  casting a look of sadness on the beautiful gardens where only yesterday  he had received the homage of his prostrate slaves. He bade farewell to  his wives, saying that he hoped soon to return, and descended to the  shore, where the rowers received him with acclamations. The sail was set  to a favourable breeze, and Ali, leaving the shore he was never to see  again, sailed towards Erevesa, where he hoped to meet the Lord High  Commissioner Maitland. But the time of prosperity had gone by, and the  regard which had once been shown him changed with his fortunes. The  interview he sought was not granted.    The sultan now ordered a fleet to be equipped, which, after Ramadan, was  to disembark troops on the coast of Epirus, while all the neighbouring  pashas received orders to hold themselves in readiness to march with all  the troops of their respective Governments against Ali, whose name was  struck out of the list of viziers. Pacho Bey was named Pasha of Janina  and Delvino on condition of subduing them, and was placed in command of  the whole expedition.    However, notwithstanding these orders, there was not at the beginning of  April, two months after the attempted assassination of Pacho Bey, a  single soldier ready to march on Albania. Ramadan, that year, did not  close until the new moon of July. Had Ali put himself boldly at the head  of the movement which was beginning to stir throughout Greece, he might  have baffled these vacillating projects, and possibly dealt a fatal blow  to the Ottoman Empire. As far back as 1808, the Hydriotes had offered to  recognise his son Veli, then Vizier of the Morea, as their Prince, and  to support him in every way, if he would proclaim the independence of  the Archipelago. The Moreans bore him no enmity until he refused to help  them to freedom, and would have returned to him had he consented.    On the other side, the sultan, though anxious for war, would not spend a  penny in order to wage it; and it was not easy to corrupt some of the  great vassals ordered to march at their own expense against a man in  whose downfall they had no special interest. Nor were the means of  seduction wanting to Ali, whose wealth was enormous; but he preferred to  keep it in order to carry on the war which he thought he could no longer  escape. He made, therefore, a general appeal to all Albanian warriors,  whatever their religion. Mussulmans and Christians, alike attracted by  the prospect of booty and good pay, flocked to his standard in crowds.    He organised all these adventurers on the plan of the Armatous, by  companies, placing a captain of his own choice at the head of each, and  giving each company a special post to defend. Of all possible plans this  was the best adapted to his country, where only a guerilla warfare can  be carried on, and where a large army could not subsist.    In repairing to the posts assigned to them, these troops committed such  terrible depredations that the provinces sent to Constantinople  demanding their suppression. The Divan answered the petitioners that it  was their own business to suppress these disorders, and to induce the  Klephotes to turn their arms against Ali, who had nothing to hope from  the clemency of the Grand Seigneur. At the same time circular letters  were addressed to the Epirotes, warning them to abandon the cause of a  rebel, and to consider the best means of freeing themselves from a  traitor, who, having long oppressed them, now sought to draw down on  their country all the terrors of war. Ali, who every where maintained  numerous and active spies, now redoubled his watchfulness, and not a  single letter entered Epirus without being opened and read by his  agents. As an extra precaution, the guardians of the passes were  enjoined to slay without mercy any despatch-bearer not provided with an  order signed by Ali himself; and to send to Janina under escort any  travellers wishing to enter Epirus. These measures were specially aimed  against Suleyman Pacha, who had succeeded Veli in the government of  Thessaly, and replaced Ali himself in the office of Grand Provost of the  Highways. Suleyman's secretary was a Greek called Anagnorto, a native of  Macedonia, whose estates Ali had seized, and who had fled with his  family to escape further persecution. He had become attached to the  court party, less for the sake of vengeance on Ali than to aid the cause  of the Greeks, for whose freedom he worked by underhand methods. He  persuaded Suleyman Pacha that the Greeks would help him to dethrone Ali,  for whom they cherished the deepest hatred, and he was determined that  they should learn the sentence of deprivation and excommunication  fulminated against the rebel pacha. He introduced into the Greek  translation which he was commissioned to make, ambiguous phrases which  were read by the Christians as a call to take up arms in the cause of  liberty. In an instant, all Hellas was up in arms. The Mohammedans were  alarmed, but the Greeks gave out that it was in order to protect  themselves and their property against the bands of brigands which had  appeared on all sides. This was the beginning of the Greek insurrection,  and occurred in May 1820, extending from Mount Pindus to Thermopylae.  However, the Greeks, satisfied with having vindicated their right to  bear arms in their own defence, continued to pay their taxes, and  abstained from all hostility.    At the news of this great movement, Ali's friends advised him to turn it  to his own advantage. \"The Greeks in arms,\" said they, \"want a chief:  offer yourself as their leader. They hate you, it is true, but this  feeling may change.

Algeria has the fifth-largest reserves of natural    gas in the world and is the second-largest gas exporter; it ranks    14th in oil reserves. Algeria's financial and economic indicators    improved during the mid-1990s, in part because of policy reforms    supported by the IMF and debt rescheduling from the Paris Club.    Algeria's finances in 2000-03 benefited from substantial trade    surpluses, record foreign exchange reserves, and reductions in    foreign debt. Real GDP has risen due to higher oil output and    increased government spending. The government's continued efforts to    diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment    outside the energy sector, however, has had little success in    reducing high unemployment and improving living standards.
