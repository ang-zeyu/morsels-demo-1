(_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department  of Agriculture._)]    _Cripples._ There will always be found in the flocks more or less  crippled ducks and those with crooked backs, twisted wings, etc. As a  rule ducks with twisted wings fatten well and are in good condition and  can be killed about as soon as any of the others. The crippled ducks are  sorted out into a lot by themselves where they are held until they can  be put into condition to market. It is doubtful whether it pays the duck  growers to bother with these ducks since they are rather difficult to  condition and it would probably pay better to kill them. However, it is  quite common practice to carry them until they can be marketed.    _Cleaning the Yards._ The yards must be cleaned whenever they need it.  It is a matter of judgment to decide when this is necessary but they  must be cleaned whenever they get sticky or sloppy. The weather will  have a considerable influence upon the frequency of cleaning which may  be necessary once in two weeks, or in the yards of brooder houses Nos. 2  and 3 may run as often as once a week. In dry weather the yards are  cleaned by sweeping up the droppings and carting them away. In wet  weather the ducks in running about over the yard pack down the droppings  until they form a sort of putty-like layer which has to be scraped off  with a hoe.    _Critical Period with Young Ducks._ The critical period with young ducks  is the first week of their existence. With good management after they  have passed this point not many are lost. The loss in young ducks from  the time they are hatched until they are ready for market will range all  the way from 5 to 30%. When the loss does not average more than 10% for  the season this is considered good. Undoubtedly many duck raisers lose a  greater percent than 10.    [Illustration: FIG. 37. Yard ducks at rest. (_Photograph from the Bureau  of Animal Industry. U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    [Illustration: FIG. 38. On this plant, the lay of the land was such that  not all of the yards could be run down to the stream. So a shallow canal  was dug from the stream through the yards which were without natural  water frontage. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.  Department of Agriculture._)]    Disease Prevention    Trouble from disease in young ducks is not severe although there is a  greater loss from this source than in the case of mature ducks. The aim  of the grower should be to use such methods of management and feeding as  will keep the ducklings in good health and reduce the losses to a  minimum. To accomplish this care must be taken to see that the brooding  temperatures are correct, that the feed used contains what the ducklings  need, that they are not overfed and that the house and yards are clean  and dry and the feed and water dishes are clean. Remember that green  feed and animal feed are essential ingredients in the ration.    _Gapes or Pneumonia._ One of the principal troubles is a disease which  is called \"pneumonia\" by some duck raisers and by others \"gapes\". It is  not the same disease which is called gapes in chickens. In fact, it is a  form of cold which approaches pneumonia. The little ducks stretch their  necks up and breathe hard and usually die within a comparatively short  time. This disease may affect either the baby ducks or ducks which are  old enough to kill. All that can be done is to make sure that the  housing and brooding conditions are such as to correct the trouble which  causes the colds.    _Fits._ In addition, the little ducks for the first 3 or 4 days may be  more or less subject to a disease which is called \"fits\" by some duck  growers. With this disease they simply keel over and soon die. It is  probably a digestive difficulty of some sort. The feeding of plenty of  green stuff or the turning of the ducks out on grass will usually stop  this trouble.    _Diarrhoea._ This is a fairly common trouble. It may be due to improper  feeding, or to too high or low temperature in the brooder. The obvious  treatment is to remedy the cause or causes of the trouble.    _Lameness._ Not infrequently growers, particularly beginners, experience  difficulty from a fairly large proportion of their ducklings becoming  lame. This may grow worse until a considerable number of the birds will  die. This trouble may be due to a lack of animal matter and mineral  matter in the ration or may be due to digestive troubles caused by poor  rations, by over feeding, by failing to gather up feed not eaten by the  ducklings and leaving it to sour, or by lack of cleanliness of the feed  and water dishes. Where the pens are allowed to become damp and sloppy  this may also cause some lameness.    _Sore Eyes._ Occasionally duck growers complain that their ducklings  suffer from sore eyes. This may be due to a cold causing a discharge  from the eyes or may be due to the use of too sloppy feed which adheres  to the eyes and causes an irritation. Affected birds should be placed in  a separate pen from the others and the eyes should be bathed with an  antiseptic solution.    _Feather Eating or \"Quilling\"._ This is a bad habit which is apt to  cause more or less trouble when the ducklings are about two-thirds  grown. It is much more likely to occur when the birds are kept in  cramped quarters. It is usually started by one or a few individuals but  when the feathers are injured so that they begin to bleed, which they  will very quickly do, the vice will spread among the whole flock and  serious damage will occur. It is therefore necessary to be on the  lookout for this trouble, and as soon as detected, the birds responsible  should be removed. If the culprits are placed with older birds which are  already feathered, they will not trouble by trying to eat the feathers.  It is the blood in the growing feathers which attracts them. If the  habit has become general, it is more difficult to check. About the best  thing that can be done, is to turn them out in a roomy yard, one with a  growing green crop, if available, where they will be so busy as to stop  the feather eating of their own accord.    _Rats._--Rats are very destructive if they get into the brooder house. A  single rat has been known to kill and drag off as many as 200 ducklings  in one night. If a rat gets into the brooder house it is therefore of  the utmost importance that it be hunted down and killed without delay.  Otherwise serious losses will result.      Cooperative Feed Association    A very large proportion of the feed used on a duck plant is that which  is fed to the market ducks. By purchasing feed in considerable  quantities the duck grower is able to cut down the cost to some extent.  A number of the duck raisers on Long Island have developed this idea  further by forming a cooperative feed organization. Stock in this  concern is held both by the duck growers and by outsiders but is  controlled by the duck growers. The feed association maintains a feed  warehouse, purchases feeds in quantity and does business both with the  duck growers and with other persons in the market for feed. The  existence of a cooperative feed purchasing association of this sort not  only cuts down to some extent the cost of feed but likewise makes it  possible for the duck growers to have greater assurance of securing the  supply which is so necessary to them during the growing season.          CHAPTER VII    Commercial Duck Farming--Marketing      On commercial duck farms, the business consists mainly of producing  large quickly grown ducklings which are marketed before they are mature.  Because of this immaturity, the ducks are quite commonly termed green  ducks. The business has also become so highly specialized on Long Island  and this is such a center of the industry, that the birds are commonly  quoted on the New York market as Long Island ducklings.    _Proper Age to Market._ It is important that the ducklings be marketed  as soon as they have reached the proper age and stage of development.  When the ducklings are about 10 to 12 weeks old they begin to shed their  first growth of feathers. This is apparent first on the neck and breast,  giving them somewhat of a rough appearance. The ducklings must be  marketed within one week after they begin this moult. If they are  allowed to go longer than this they will begin to get thin and as it  will take them 6 weeks or more to grow a new crop of feathers it will be  a considerable period before they get back in market condition again and  any additional weight which they may attain will not be sufficient to  pay for the feed eaten during this period.    _Weights at the Time of Marketing._ Well grown ducklings should average  in weight from 5 to 6 pounds at 10 to 12 weeks of age when they are  ready to be marketed. A majority of the ducks will weigh closer to 5  pounds than they will to 6. The vast majority of ducklings are marketed  at this age as it does not pay to keep them past the time they reach  prime market condition. On commercial duck farms practically the only  ducks which are marketed at an older age than this are the breeders  which are turned off at the end of the laying season and the ducklings  which by reason of their being crippled or less thrifty are not in  suitable market condition at this time and are held longer until they  are in good condition. The ducklings are marketed from early spring  until late fall. The time at which ducklings are first available for  market in any quantity depends upon the earliness with which the  breeders begin to lay and the end of the season depends upon how late  the breeders continue to lay at a profitable rate."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33044"],[0,"Birds from North Borneo (#17)"],[1,"3024; [Male] testis 4 x 4 mm., October 28, 1962, MCT 3179.  5.5 mi.

This bird of the primary forest and primary-secondary forest       ecotone was common at all three principal collecting stations.    _=Muscicapa sibirica=_ Gmelin: Sooty Flycatcher.--_Specimens_, 2: Cocoa  Research Station: [Male], 10.0 gm., August 25, 1962, MCT 2811; [Male],  July 8, 1963, ADG 174.         Several small \"brown\" flycatchers which could not be assigned to       species were observed at Quoin Hill and Kalabakan. The specimen       taken by Garcia is of interest as it was taken on a date extremely       early for a migrant. Garcia's specimen (not the other) also       presented problems of identification and its assignment to this       species is tentative.    _=Muscicapa latirostris latirostris=_ Raffles: Brown  Flycatcher.--_Specimen_, 1: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], September  26, 1962, MCT 2965.    _=Muscicapa cyanomelana cyanomelana=_ Temminck: Blue and White  Flycatcher.--_Specimen_, 1: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], November 27,  1962, MCT 3335.         The specimen, netted in the cocoa, apparently provides the only       record from the east coast of Borneo (see Smythies, 1957:742).    _=Muscicapa concreta everetti=_ (Sharpe): White-tailed Blue  Flycatcher.--_Specimens_, 6: 12 mi.

SW Tenom:  [Male], December 19, 1962, MCT 3465; [Female], December 23, 1962, MCT  3516.         This species seems to be confined to the primary forest, and was       common at both localities listed. Smythies (1960:444) thought it       resided primarily at elevations of 2,000 to 4,000 feet,       occasionally occurring near sea level. This flycatcher seems to       prefer the understory of the forest, where it was observed sitting       on bare limbs and darting out after insects.    _=Muscicapa unicolor infuscata=_ (Hartert): Pale Blue  Flycatcher.--_Specimens_, 2: 12 mi.

The birds collected appear to provide the only definitive       records for North Borneo (_cf._ Smythies, 1960:445), although Mary       Norman observed the species once at Quoin Cocoa Estate on an       unspecified date (Smythies, 1963:281).    _=Muscicapa turcosa rupatensis=_ Oberholser: Malaysian Blue  Flycatcher.--_Specimen_, 1: Tiger Estate: [Female], November 25, 1962,  MCT 3320.    _=Muscicapa caerulata caerulata=_ (Bonaparte): Large-billed Blue  Flycatcher.--_Specimens_, 10: Ulu Balung Cocoa Estate: [Male], July 10,  1963, ADG 185. 12 mi.

This was the most common \"blue\" flycatcher at Kalabakan. It was       recorded at Quoin Hill only by Garcia. The record by Smythies       (1963:281) seems open to question as no specimen was preserved.    _=Muscicapa venusta=_ Deignan: Bornean Blue Flycatcher.--_Specimens_,  6: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], September 24, 1962, MCT 2939; [Male],  June 12, 1963, ADG 128. 12 mi.

Kinabatangan: sex?, October 15,  1963, ADG 309.         The \"blue\" flycatcher of the Quoin Hill area was observed several       times in the primary forest and primary forest edge. On July 14,       1962, I saw a male and a female of _M. venusta_ bathing in a       shallow stream in the deep forest. They fluttered their wings in       the water and then flew to a nearby fallen log and preened for       several minutes.    _=Muscicapa rufigastra rufigastra=_ Raffles: Mangrove Blue  Flycatcher.--_Specimen_, 1: Tuaran: [Male], December 14, 1963, SCFC 33.    _=Muscicapa dumetoria mulleri=_ Blyth: Orange-breasted  Flycatcher.--_Specimens_, 5: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], 11.8 gm.,  July 25, 1962, MCT 2661; [Female], November 1, 1962, MCT 3198; [Male]  testis 3 x 2 mm., November 11, 1962, MCT 3246; [Male] testis 5 x 4 mm.,  November 28, 1962, MCT 3384. 5.5 mi. SW Tenom: [Male], December 25,  1962, MCT 3531.         This species was seen only in the understory of primary forest. On       November 10, I watched a male and female feeding about three feet       above the ground in the undergrowth. They sat on small vines and       plants and darted out after insects. I never observed this species       more than 20 feet above the ground.    _=Muscicapa narcissina=_ Temminck: Black and Yellow  Flycatcher.--_Specimens_, 2: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], November  27, 1962, MCT 3331. 5.5 mi.

This abundant species at Quoin Hill and Kalabakan was chiefly an       inhabitant of primary forest.         On July 31, I observed this species singing at Quoin Hill. One sang       with its mouth closed and sounded much farther away than it       actually was. The song has seven notes on a descending scale. Birds       observed on September 27 were in heavy molt and one specimen lacked       tail feathers.    _=Philentoma pyrrhoptera pyrrhoptera=_ (Temminck): Chestnut-winged  Monarch Flycatcher.--_Specimens_, 10: 12 mi.
