M de Foix gave the necessary orders, chose a hundred of his bravest men,  put himself at their head, and joined M. de La Jonquiere, showing him  his orders; but the latter, confiding in the courage of his soldiers and  unwilling to share with anyone the glory of a victory of which he felt  assured, not only sent away M. de Foix, but begged him to go back to  Uzes, declaring to him that he had enough troops to fight and conquer  all the Camisards whom he might encounter; consequently the hundred  dragoons whom the lieutenant had brought with him were quite useless at  Sainte-Chatte, while on the contrary they might be very necessary  somewhere else. M. de Foix did not consider that it was his duty to  insist on remaining under these circumstances, and returned to Uzes,  while M. de La Jonquiere continued his route in order to pass the night  at Moussac. Cavalier left the town by one gate just as M. de La  Jonquiere entered at the other. The wishes of the young Catholic  commander were thus in a fair way to be fulfilled, for in all  probability he would come up with his enemy the next day.    As the village was inhabited for the most part by new converts, the  night instead of being spent in repose was devoted to pillage.    The next day the Catholic troops reached Moussac, which they found  deserted, so they went on to Lascours-de-Gravier, a little village  belonging to the barony of Boucairan, which M. de La Jonquiere gave up  to pillage, and where he had four Protestants shot--a man, a woman, and  two young girls. He then resumed his route. As it had rained, he soon  came on the trail of the Camisards, the terrible game which he was  hunting down. For three hours he occupied himself in this pursuit,  marching at the head of his troops, lest someone else less careful than  he should make some mistake, when, suddenly raising his eyes, he  perceived the Camisards on a small eminence called Les Devois de  Maraignargues. This was the spot they had chosen to await attack in,  being eager for the approaching combat.    As soon as Cavalier saw the royals advancing, he ordered his men,  according to custom, to offer up prayers to God, and when these were  finished he disposed his troops for battle. His plan was to take up  position with the greater part of his men on the other side of a ravine,  which would thus form a kind of moat between him and the king's  soldiers; he also ordered about thirty horsemen to make a great round,  thus reaching unseen a little wood about two hundred yards to his left,  where they could conceal themselves; and lastly, he sent to a point on  the right sixty foot-soldiers chosen from his best marksmen, whom he  ordered not to fire until the royal forces were engaged in the struggle  with him.    M de La Jonquiere having approached to within a certain distance,  halted, and sent one of his lieutenants named de Sainte-Chatte to make a  reconnaissance, which he did, advancing beyond the men in ambush, who  gave no sign of their existence, while the officer quietly examined the  ground. But Sainte-Chatte was an old soldier of fortune and not easily  taken in, so on his return, while explaining the plan of the ground  chosen by Cavalier for the disposition of his troops to M. de La  Jonquiere, he added that he should be very much astonished if the young  Camisard had not employed the little wood on his left and the lie of the  ground on his right as cover for soldiers in ambush; but M. de La  Jonquiere returned that the only thing of importance was to know the  position of the principal body of troops in order to attack it at once.  Sainte-Chatte told him that the principal body was that which was before  his eyes, and that on this subject there could be no mistake; for he had  approached near enough to recognise Cavalier himself in the front rank.    This was enough for M. de La Jonquiere: he put himself at the head of  his men and rode straight to the ravine, beyond which Cavalier and his  comrades awaited him in order of battle. Having got within a  pistol-shot, M. de La Jonquiere gave the order to fire, but he was so  near that Cavalier heard the words and saw the motion made by the men as  they made ready; he therefore gave a rapid sign to his men, who threw  themselves on their faces, as did their leader, and the bullets passed  over them without doing any harm M.M. de La Jonquiere, who believed them  all dead, was astonished when Cavalier and his Camisards rose up and  rushed upon the royal troops, advancing to the sound of a psalm. At a  distance of ten paces they fired, and then charged the enemy at the  point of the bayonet. At this moment the sixty men in ambush to the  right opened fire, while the thirty horsemen to the left, uttering loud  shouts, charged at a gallop. Hearing this noise, and seeing death  approach them in three different directions, the royals believed  themselves surrounded, and did not attempt to make a stand; the men,  throwing away their weapons, took to their heels, the officers alone and  a few dragoons whom they had succeeded in rallying making a desperate  resistance.    Cavalier was riding over the field of battle, sabring all the fugitives  whom he met, when he caught sight of a group, composed of ten naval  officers; standing close together and back to back, spontoon in hand,  facing the Camisards, who surrounded them. He spurred up to them,  passing through the ranks of his soldiers, and not pausing till he was  within fifteen paces of them, although they raised their weapons to  fire. Then making a sign with his hand that he wished to speak to them,  he said, \"Gentlemen, surrender. I shall give quarter, and in return for  the ten lives I now spare you, will ask that my father, who is in prison  at Nimes, be released.\"    For sole answer, one of the officers fired and wounded the young chief's  horse in the head. Cavalier drew a pistol from his belt, took aim at the  officer and killed him, then turning again to the others, he asked,  \"Gentlemen, are you as obstinate as your comrade, or do you accept my  offer?\" A second shot was the reply, and a bullet grazed his shoulder.  Seeing that no other answer was to be hoped for, Cavalier turned to his  soldiers. \"Do your duty,\" said he, and withdrew, to avoid seeing the  massacre. The nine officers were shot.    M de La Jonquiere, who had received a slight wound in the cheek,  abandoned his horse in order to climb over a wall. On the other side he  made a dragoon dismount and give him his horse, on which he crossed the  river Gardon, leaving behind him on the battlefield twenty-five officers  and six hundred soldiers killed. This defeat was doubly disastrous to  the royal cause, depriving it of the flower of its officers, almost all  of those who fell belonging to the noblest families of France, and also  because the Camisards gained what they so badly needed, muskets, swords,  and bayonets in great quantities, as well as eighty horses, these latter  enabling Cavalier to complete the organisation of a magnificent troop of  cavalry.    The recall of the Marechal de Montrevel was the consequence of this  defeat, and M. de Villars, as he had anticipated, was appointed in his  place. But before giving up his governorship Montrevel resolved to  efface the memory of the check which his lieutenant's foolhardiness had  caused, but for which, according to the rules of war, the general had to  pay the penalty. His plan was by spreading false rumours and making  feigned marches to draw the Camisards into a trap in which they, in  their turn, would be caught. This was the less difficult to accomplish  as their latest great victory had made Cavalier over confident both in  himself and his men.    In fact, since the incident connected with the naval officers the troops  of Cavalier had increased enormously in numbers, everyone desiring to  serve under so brave a chief, so that he had now under him over one  thousand infantry and two hundred cavalry; they were furnished, besides,  just like regular troops, with a bugler for the cavalry, and eight drums  and a fife for the infantry.    The marechal felt sure that his departure would be the signal for some  expedition into the level country under Cavalier, so it was given out  that he had left for Montpellier, and had sent forward some of his  baggage-waggons to that place. On April 15th he was informed that  Cavalier, deceived by the false news, had set out on the 16th April,  intending to pass the night at Caveyrac, a small town about a league  from Nimes, that he might be ready next day to make a descent on La  Vannage. This news was brought to M. de Montrevel by a village priest  called Verrien, who had in his pay vigilant and faithful spies in whom  he had every confidence.    Montrevel accordingly ordered the commandant of Lunel, M. de Grandval,  to set out the next day, very early in the morning, with the Charolais  regiment and five companies of the Fimarcon and Saint-Sernin dragoons,  and to repair to the heights of Boissieres, where instructions would  await him. Sandricourt, governor of Nimes, was at the same time directed  to withdraw as many men as possible from the garrison, both Swiss and  dragoons, and send them by night towards Saint-Come and Clarensac;  lastly, he himself set out, as he had said, but instead of going on to  Montpellier, he stopped at Sommieres, whence he could observe the  movements of Cavalier.    Cavalier, as M. de Montrevel already knew, was to sleep on the 15th at  Caveyrac. On this day Cavalier reached the turning-point in his  magnificent career. As he entered the town with his soldiers, drums  beating and flags flying, he was at the zenith of his power. He rode the  splendid horse M. de La Jonquiere had abandoned in his flight; behind  him, serving as page, rode his young brother, aged ten, followed by four  grooms; he was preceded"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2744"],[0,"Mary Stuart (#17)"],[1,"sat down again,  joyful and triumphant at the victory she had just gained, and ate with a  better appetite than she had yet done since she was a prisoner, while  Mary Seyton deplored in a low tone and with all possible respect this  fatal gift of repartee that Mary had received, and which, with her  beauty, was one of the causes of all her misfortunes; but the queen did  nothing but laugh at all her observations, saying she was curious to see  the figure her good hostess would cut at dinnertime.    After breakfast, the queen went down into the garden: her satisfied  pride had restored some of her cheerfulness, so much so that, seeing,  while crossing the hall, a mandolin lying forgotten on a chair, she told  Mary Seyton to take it, to see, she said, if she could recall her old  talent. In reality the queen was one of the best musicians of the time,  and played admirably, says Brantome, on the lute and viol d'amour, an  instrument much resembling the mandolin.    Mary Seyton obeyed.    Arrived in the garden, the queen sat down in the deepest shade, and  there, having tuned her instrument, she at first drew from it lively and  light tones, which soon darkened little by little, at the same time that  her countenance assumed a hue of deep melancholy. Mary Seyton looked at  her with uneasiness, although for a long time she had been used to these  sudden changes in her mistress's humour, and she was about to ask the  reason of this gloomy veil suddenly spread over her face, when,  regulating her harmonies, Mary began to sing in a low voice, and as if  for herself alone, the following verses:        \"Caverns, meadows, plains and mounts,       Lands of tree and stone,       Rivers, rivulets and founts,       By which I stray alone,       Bewailing as I go,       With tears that overflow,       Sing will I       The miserable woe       That bids me grieve and sigh.         Ay, but what is here to lend       Ear to my lament?       What is here can comprehend       My dull discontent?       Neither grass nor reed,       Nor the ripples heed,       Flowing by,       While the stream with speed       Hastens from my eye.         Vainly does my wounded heart       Hope, alas, to heal;       Seeking, to allay its smart,       Things that cannot feel.       Better should my pain       Bitterly complain,       Crying shrill,       To thee who dost constrain       My spirit to such ill.         Goddess, who shalt never die,       List to what I say;       Thou who makest me to lie       Weak beneath thy sway,       If my life must know       Ending at thy blow,       Cruellest!       Own it perished so       But at thy behest.         Lo! my face may all men see       Slowly pine and fade,       E'en as ice doth melt and flee       Near a furnace laid.       Yet the burning ray       Wasting me away       Passion's glow,       Wakens no display       Of pity for my woe.         Yet does every neighbour tree,       Every rocky wall,       This my sorrow know and see;       So, in brief, doth all       Nature know aright       This my sorry plight;       Thou alone       Takest thy delight       To hear me cry and moan.         But if it be thy will,       To see tormented still       Wretched me,       Then let my woful ill       Immortal be.\"    This last verse died away as if the queen were exhausted, and at the  same time the mandolin slipped from her hands, and would have fallen to  the ground had not Mary Seyton thrown herself on her knees and prevented  it. The young girl remained thus at her mistress's feet for some time,  gazing at her silently, and as she saw that she was losing herself more  and more in gloomy reverie--    \"Have those lines brought back to your Majesty some sad remembrance?\"  she asked hesitatingly.    \"Oh, yes,\" answered the queen; \"they reminded me of the unfortunate  being who composed them.\"    \"And may I, without indiscretion, inquire of your grace who is their  author?\"    \"Alas! he was a noble, brave, and handsome young man, with a faithful  heart and a hot head, who would defend me to-day, if I had defended him  then; but his boldness seemed to me rashness, and his fault a crime.  What was to be done? I did not love him. Poor Chatelard! I was very  cruel to him.\"    \"But you did not prosecute him, it was your brother; you did not condemn  him, the judges did.\"    \"Yes, yes; I know that he too was Murray's victim, and that is no doubt  the reason that I am calling him to mind just now. But I was able to  pardon him, Mary, and I was inflexible; I let ascend the scaffold a man  whose only crime was in loving me too well; and now I am astonished and  complain of being abandoned by everyone. Listen, darling, there is one  thing that terrifies me: it is, that when I search within myself I find  that I have not only deserved my fate, but even that God did not punish  me severely enough.\"    \"What strange thoughts for your grace!\" cried Mary; \"and see where those  unlucky lines which returned to your mind have led you, the very day  when you were beginning to recover a little of your cheerfulness.\"    \"Alas!\" replied the queen, shaking her head and uttering a deep sigh,  \"for six years very few days have passed that I have not repeated those  lines to myself, although it may be for the first time to-day that I  repeat them aloud. He was a Frenchman too, Mary: they have exiled from  me, taken or killed all who came to me from France. Do you remember that  vessel which was swallowed up before our eyes when we came out of Calais  harbour? I exclaimed then that it was a sad omen: you all wanted to  reassure me. Well, who was right, now, you or I?\"    The queen was in one of those fits of sadness for which tears are the  sole remedy; so Mary Seyton, perceiving that not only would every  consolation be vain, but also unreasonable, far from continuing to react  against her mistress's melancholy, fully agreed with her: it followed  that the queen, who was suffocating, began to weep, and that her tears  brought her comfort; then little by little she regained self-control,  and this crisis passed as usual, leaving her firmer and more resolute  than ever, so that when she went up to her room again it was impossible  to read the slightest alteration in her countenance.    The dinner-hour was approaching, and Mary, who in the morning was  looking forward impatiently to the enjoyment of her triumph over Lady  Lochleven, now saw her advance with uneasiness: the mere idea of again  facing this woman, whose pride one was always obliged to oppose with  insolence, was, after the moral fatigues of the day, a fresh weariness.  So she decided not to appear for dinner, as on the day before: she was  all the more glad she had taken this resolution, that this time it was  not Lady Lochleven who came to fulfil the duties enjoined on a member of  the family to make the queen easy, but George Douglas, whom his mother  in her displeasure at the morning scene sent to replace her. Thus, when  Mary Seyton told the queen that she saw the young man with dark hair  cross the courtyard on his way to her, Mary still further congratulated  herself on her decision; for this young man's insolence had wounded her  more deeply than all his mother's haughty insults. The queen was not a  little astonished, then, when in a few minutes Mary Seyton returned and  informed her that George Douglas, having sent away the servants, desired  the honour of speaking to her on a matter of importance. At first the  queen refused; but Mary Seyton told her that the young man's air and  manner this time were so different from what she had seen two days  before, that she thought her mistress would be wrong to refuse his  request.    The queen rose then, and with the pride and majesty habitual to her,  entered the adjoining room, and, having taken three steps, stopped with  a disdainful air, waiting for George to address her.    Mary Seyton had spoken truly: George Douglas was now another man. To-day  he seemed to be as respectful and timid as the preceding day he had  seemed haughty and proud. He, in his turn, made a step towards the  queen; but seeing Mary Seyton standing behind her--    \"Madam,\" said he, \"I wished to speak with your Majesty alone: shall I  not obtain this favour?\"    \"Mary Seyton is not a stranger to me, Sir: she is my sister, my friend;  she is more than all that, she is my companion in captivity.\"    \"And by all these claims, madam, I have the utmost veneration for her;  but what I have to tell you cannot be heard by other ears than yours.  Thus, madam, as the opportunity furnished now may perhaps never present  itself again, in the name of what is dearest to you, grant me what I  ask.\"    There was such a tone of respectful prayer in George's voice that Mary  turned to the young girl, and, making her a friendly sign with her  hand--    \"Go, then, darling,\" said she; \"but be easy, you will lose nothing by  not hearing. Go.\"    Mary Seyton withdrew; the queen smilingly looked after her, till the  door was shut; then, turning to George--    \"Now, sir,\" said she, \"we are alone, speak.\"    But George, instead of replying, advanced to the queen, and, kneeling on  one knee, drew from his breast a paper which he presented to her. Mary  took it with amazement, unfolded it, glancing at Douglas, who remained  in the same posture, and read as follows:    We, earls, lords, and barons, in consideration that our queen is  detained at Lochleven, and that her faithful subjects cannot have access  to her person; seeing, on the other hand, that our duty pledges us to  provide for her safety, promise and swear to employ all reasonable means  which will depend on us to set her at liberty again on conditions  compatible with the honour of her Majesty, the welfare of the kingdom,  and even with the safety of those who keep her in prison, provided that  they consent to give her up; that if they refuse, we declare that we are  prepared to make use of"]]]
