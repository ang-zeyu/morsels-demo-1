In  analyzing some of these tints, Ridolfi discovered that they bore little  resemblance to those used by the ancient Greeks, and quite distinct from  those tawny, brown, and azure colours, since introduced at the expense  of the more natural. Such of his pictures as are composed in the style  of his Dead Christ, in the Monte di Pieta at Trevigi, the S. Omobono at  the Scuola de' Sarti, in Venice, or the Tempest stilled by the Saint, at  that of S. Marco, in which among other figures are those of three rowers  drawn naked, excellent both in their design and their attitudes; such  are the rarest triumphs of his art. The city of Milan possesses two of  an oblong shape, in which several of the figures extend beyond the  proportions of Poussin, and may be pronounced rather full than  beautiful. One of these is to be viewed at the Ambrosiana, the other in  the archepiscopal palace; esteemed by some the happiest effort of  Giorgione that now survives. It represents the child Moses just rescued  from the Nile, and presented to the daughter of Pharaoh. Very few  colours, but well harmonized and distributed, and finely broken with the  shades, produce a sort of austere union, if I may be allowed the  expression, and may be assimilated to a piece of music composed of few  notes, but skilfully adapted, and delightful beyond any more noisy  combination of sounds.    Giorgione died at the early age of thirty-four, in 1511. Thus his  productions, rather than the pupils he educated, remained to instruct  the Venetians. Vasari, however, mentions several who have been contested  by other writers. A Pietro Luzzo is recorded by Ridolfi;--a native of  Feltre, called Zarato, or Zarotto,--who after being a pupil became a  rival of Giorgione, and seduced from his house a woman, to whom he was  passionately attached, at whose loss it has been asserted by some that  the disappointed artist died in despair. By others, on the contrary, he  is said to have died of a disease contracted during his intercourse with  the same lady. This Zarato, as we read in a MS. history of Feltre, and  in a MS. upon the pictures of Udine, is the same whom Vasari entitles,  _Morto da Feltro_; and adds, that he went when young to Rome, and  subsequently flourished in Florence and elsewhere, distinguished for his  skill in grotesques; of which more hereafter. Going afterwards to  Venice, he is known to have assisted Giorgione in the paintings he made  for the Fondaco de' Tedeschi, about the year 1505; and, lastly, having  remained some time at his native place, he embraced a military life,  obtaining the rank of captain. Proceeding to Zara, he fell in battle  near that place in his forty-fifth year; at least such is the account of  Vasari. From the mention of his native place of Feltre, his assisting  Giorgione in his works, and his surnames of _Zarato_ and _Morto_, I  think there is some degree of probability in the assertion contained in  these MSS. though the dates attaching to the life of Morto in Vasari,  will not countenance the supposition of Ridolfi, of his being the pupil  of Giorgione, a man considerably younger than himself; so that I should  conjecture that Ridolfi may have denominated him a scholar of Giorgione,  because, when already of a mature age, he painted under him as his  assistant. Notwithstanding the assertion of Vasari, he had a tolerable  genius for figures, and in the history already cited, written by  Cambrucci, and in possession of the bishop of Feltre, a picture of our  Lady between saints Francesco and Antonio, placed at S. Spirito, and  another at Villabruna, besides a figure of Curtius on horseback, upon a  house at Teggie, are attributed to his hand. We gather from the same  history that another Luzzi, by name Lorenzo, a contemporary and perhaps  friend of Pietro, painted very skilfully in fresco, at the church of S.  Stefano; and that he was equally successful in oils, he himself assures  us in his altarpiece of the proto-martyr S. Stefano, conspicuous for  correctness of design, beauty of forms, force of tints, and bearing his  name and the date of 1511.    The most distinguished disciple of the school of Giorgione is  Sebastiano, a Venetian, commonly called, from the habit and office he  afterwards assumed at Rome, Fra Sebastiano del Piombo. Having left Gian  Bellini, he attached himself to Giorgione, and in the tone of his  colours, and the fulness of his forms, imitated him better than any  other artist. An altarpiece in S. Gio. Crisostomo, from his hand, was by  some mistaken for the work of his master; so strikingly does it abound  with his manner. It may be presumed, indeed, that he was assisted in the  design; Sebastiano being known to possess no surprising richness of  invention,--slow in the composition of most of his figures; irresolute;  eager to undertake, but difficult to commence, and most difficult in the  completion. Hence we rarely meet with any of his histories or his  altarpieces comparable to the Nativity of the Virgin, at S. Agostino, in  Perugia, or the _Flagellazione_ at the Osservanti of Viterbo, which is  esteemed the best picture in the city. Pictures for private rooms, and  portraits, he painted in great number, and with comparative ease; and we  no where meet with more beautiful hands, more rosy flesh tints, or more  novel accessaries than in these. Thus, in taking the portrait of Pietro  Aretino, he distinguished five different tints of black in his dress;  imitating with exactness those of the velvet, of the satin, and so of  the rest. Being invited to Rome by Agostino Chigi, and there esteemed as  one of the first colourists of his time, he painted in competition with  Peruzzi, and with Raffaello himself; and the rival labours of all three  are still preserved in a hall of the Farnesina, at that period the house  of the Chigi.    Sebastiano became aware, that in such a competition, his own design  would not appear to much advantage in Rome, and he improved it. But  occasionally he fell into some harshness of manner, owing to the  difficulties he there encountered. Yet, in several of his works, he was  assisted by Michelangiolo, from whose design he painted that _Pieta_,  placed at the Conventuali of Viterbo, and the Transfiguration, with the  other pieces which he produced, during six years, for S. Pietro in  Montorio, at Rome. It is stated by Vasari, that Michelangiolo united  with him, in order to oppose the too favourable opinion entertained by  the Romans, of Raffaello. He adds, that on the death of the latter,  Sebastiano was universally esteemed the first artist of his time, upheld  by the favour of Michelangiolo; Giulio Romano, and the rest of the rival  school, being all inferior to him. I am almost at a loss how to judge of  a fact, which, if discredited, seems to cast an imputation upon the  historian, and, if received, reflects very little credit upon  Buonarotti; and the reader will do best, perhaps, to decide for himself.  The name of Sebastiano must also be added to the list of inventors, for  his new method of oil painting upon stone, upon which plan he executed  the _Flagellazione_, for S. Pietro in Montorio, a work as much defaced  by time as the others which he made in fresco remain at the same place  entire. He coloured also upon stone several pictures for private houses,  a practice highly esteemed at its earlier period, but which was soon  abandoned owing to the difficulty of carriage. Upon this plan, or some  other resembling it, we find several pictures of the sixteenth century  executed, and which, at this period, are esteemed in museums real  antiques.[42]    Among the disciples of the School of Giorgione, were, likewise, Gio. da  Udine and Francesco Torbido, a Veronese, who has been surnamed _il  Moro_, and both were distinguished practisers of his tints. In regard to  Giovanni, afterwards a pupil of Raffaello, we have written, and we shall  again write elsewhere. Moro remained but little with Giorgione, a much  longer while with Liberale. Of this last he imitated very truly both the  diligence and the design, in the former even surpassing him; always a  severe critic upon himself, and slow in completing his undertakings. We  rarely meet with him in altarpieces, still more rarely in collections of  paintings, for which he was often employed in sacred subjects and in  portraits; deficient in nothing, except, perhaps, we could wish to see  somewhat greater freedom of hand. In the dome of Verona, he painted  several histories in fresco, among which is the Assumption of the  Virgin, truly admirable; but the designs are not his, Giulio Romano  having prepared the cartoons. His style of execution, however, is  clearly enough perceived, which, in respect to colouring and to  chiaroscuro, discovers him to be an artist, as Vasari has recorded, \"as  careful in regard to his use of colours, as any other who flourished at  the same period.\"    The other names that here follow, are included, according to history, in  the train of Giorgione, not as his pupils, but his imitators. Yet all  exhibit traces of Bellini, because the Venetian manner, up to the time  of Tintoretto, did not so much aim at inventing new things, as at  perfecting such as had already been discovered; not so desirous of  relinquishing the taste of the Bellini, as of modernizing it upon the  model of Titian and Giorgione. Hence it arose, that a people of painters  were formed in a taste extremely uniform; and the exaggerated  observation, \"that whoever had cultivated an acquaintance with one  Venetian artist of that age, knew them all,\" seemed to have some ground  in truth. But still, as I have said, it is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3470"],[0,"Such Is Life (#17)"],[1,"the geography of Riverina as well as if I had laid out  the whole territory myself, I was aware of a sandhill composed of material  unstable as water; an unfavourable place for a bucking horse,  and a favourable place for a man to dismount head foremost if the worst came;  and that sand-hill was my destination.          CHAPTER II        When I undertook the pleasant task of writing out these reminiscences,  I engaged, you will remember, to amplify the record of one week;  judging that a rigidly faithful analysis of that sample would disclose  the approximate percentage of happiness, virtue, &c., in Life.  But whilst writing the annotations on Sept. 9th (which, by the way,  gratuitously overlap on the following day), I saw an alpine difficulty  looming ahead.  At the Blowhard Sand-hill, on the night of the 10th,  I camped with a party of six sons of Belial, bound for Deniliquin,  with 3,000 Boolka wethers off the shears.  Now, anyone who has listened  for four hours to the conversation of a group of sheep drovers, named,  respectively, Splodger, Rabbit, Parson, Bottler, Dingo, and Hairy-toothed Ike,  will agree with me as to the impossibility of getting the dialogue  of such dramatis personae into anything like printable form.  The bullock drivers were bad enough, but these fellows are out of the question.    Then it occurred to me that a wider scope of observation might give  in perhaps fewer pages, a fairer estimate of that ageless enigma,  the true solution of which forms our all-embracing and only responsibility.  I therefore concluded to skip one calendar month, dipping again  into my old diary at Oct. 9th in the same year, namely, '83    After this, I shall pick out of each consecutive month the 9th day  for amplification and comment, keeping not too long in one tune,  but a snip and away.  This will prospect the gutter of Life  (gutter is good) at different points; in other words, it will give us  a range of seven months instead of seven days.    The thread of narrative being thus purposely broken, no one of these short  and simple analyses can have any connection with another--a point on which  I congratulate the judicious reader and the no less judicious writer;  for the former is thereby tacitly warned against any expectation of plot  or denouement, and so secured against disappointment, whilst the latter  is relieved from the (to him) impossible task of investing prosaic people  with romance, and a generally hap-hazard economy with poetical justice.  Go to, then.      TUES. OCT. 9. Goolumbulla.  To Rory's.      This record transports you (saving reverence of our 'birth stain')  something more than a hundred miles northward from the scene sketched  in Chap.I, thus unveiling a territory blank on the map, and similarly qualified  in the ordinary conversation of its inhabitants.    The Willandra Billabong, which in moderately wet seasons relieves  the Middle Lachlan of some superfluous water, and in epoch-marking flood-times  reluctantly debouches into the Lower Darling, divides the country  between those rivers into two unequal parts.  Roughly speaking--  the black-soil plains (which are chiefly light red) lie to the south  of this almost imperceptible depression, whilst on the north--  sometimes close by, sometimes out of sight, and sometimes thirty miles away--  the irregular scrub--frontier denotes an abrupt change of soil,  though the uniform level is maintained.    Here you enter upon a region presenting to the rarely clouded sky  an unbroken foliage-surface, with isothermal zones rigidly marked  by their indigenous growths.  A tract of country until yesterday  bare of surface water for lack of occupation, and lacking occupation  for dearth of surface water.  Which goes to show that regularity of rainfall  is not ensured by copious growth of timber.    However, a hundred miles back in that leafy solitude,--just where the line  of water conservation, creeping northward from the Lachlan,  here and there touched the line creeping southward from the Darling,--  I was standing in the veranda of the barracks, on Goolumbulla station,  when the narangies' pagan henchman announced, \"Brekfit leddy, all li.\"    During the meal, Jack Ward, the senior narangy, made some remark  implying that certain cattle, on a certain occasion, had scented water  from a fabulous distance.  Whereupon Andrews, the storekeeper,  interrogated deponent with some severity, driving him down, down,  to three hundred yards' range, where he made a final stand.  But the two junior narangies supported Ward in the endowment of cattle  with the faculty in question; and, as a matter of course, each young fellow  supplemented his limited experience by a number of instances, all alike  distinguished by that want of proper hang which makes the judicious grieve.    A practical knowledge of the subject, founded on irrefragable proofs,  led me to side with Andrews; and it was thus that I came to quote  a case in point, with all the advantage of local reference.  It will be necessary to lay the facts before you:--    In Feb., '81--two years and eight months before the date of this record--  I had drawn up to Goolumbulla homestead with six tons of wire.  The manager, Mr. Spanker, in his fine, off-hand way, asked me  to just dump it down carelessly in five or six places over the run,  as the contractor would be using it at once.  He would pay me  for the extra mileage; and Dan O'Connell would show me where to sling it off.  I objected to the mileage agreement, inasmuch as carting over raw ground  was a very different thing from travelling on a track.  I wanted £1 a day  for the extra time--a fair current rate, and easily counted.  Mr. Spanker, in reply, had no objection to paying by the day;  but, as my account came to £42, and as it had taken me twelve weeks  to do the two hundred and thirty miles from Hay, and as the contractor  had been cursing me steadily for the last four weeks--well,  if I asked him anything about it, he thought that ten shillings  came nearer the mark, and was almost as easily counted.  Finally, with that pliancy of temper which keeps me down in the world,  I assented to these terms; whereupon Spanker, with characteristic perversity,  called it fifteen.    Next day, following Andrews' directions, I took the faint track  of the ration cart for seven or eight miles, and found a tank  without any trouble.  (Remember that this is a recital of what happened  long before the date of our record.) Early next morning,  Dan O'Connell joined me, and we crawled along for another five or six miles,  on a still fainter track, marked only by a few trips  of the contractor's wagonette.  In the afternoon we struck a line  of bored posts, and dumped twenty coils.  In due time, I unyoked,  and Dan led me to a new tank, half-full of horribly alkaline water.  Thence, after arranging to meet me in the morning, he cut across  to his own boundary hut, six or eight miles away.    Next day, still following the line of posts, we dropped the rest of the wire;  and, before Dan left me, I made him repeat again and again  his directions for finding a gilgie, which he knew to be full  of first-class water, and which I ought to strike about sunset.  Next day I would reach the station in good time, thus completing  a loop journey of thirty-odd miles in four days.    Dan had impressed me as a person likely to be of considerably more account  in the estimation of his Maker than of his fellow-products;  and, having previously studied men of the same description,  I now accepted this involuntary sentiment as the only way of accounting  for something not unfamiliar in his voice and bearing.  A man  of average stature, with a vast black beard, and guileless blue eyes,  set off by a powerful Armagh accent.  Evidently unobservant, uncritical,  and utterly destitute of devil in any form, it seemed that  the Spirit of the Bog had followed him into the bush, preserving  his noxious innocence and all-round ineptitude in their pristine integrity.  Naturally, he had taken a slight local colour, but this seemed to express  the limit of his susceptibility to altered conditions.    Yet he twice startled me by the breadth and exactness of his information--  once when America was mentioned, and he glanced at the character and policy  of each President, from Washington to Van Buren; and again,  when he spoke of the Massacre of Cawnpore, almost as if he had been there  at the time.  Also, an unconscious familiarity with the Bible and Shakespear  was noticeable in his conversation, though he was evidently  a Catholic of the Catholics.    When I complimented him on his erudition, he remarked,  with amusing incompatibility of dialect and manner, 'Mebbe it's thrue fur ye.  Me father hed consitherable mains, so he hed; an' A har'ly ivver done  a han's turn, furbye divarsion, to A come out here.' However,  you will now understand why I made him repeat his topographical notes  half a dozen times before I let him go.    Just at sunset I struck the partly-plain patch of sixty or eighty acres,  where the gilgie ought to be.  I unyoked with despatch, then left the bullocks,  and rode round, looking for a clump of mallee, which would indicate  the immediate neighbourhood of the water.  No use.  I could find  no mallee anywhere.  Night came on--richest starlight, though, of course,  dark in the scrub--and still I objurgated round, and purposely scattered  the bullocks to search for themselves, and anathematised in all directions,  and consigned the whole vicinity to the Evil One, for lack  of that clump of mallee.  Hour after hour passed; the bullocks  from time to time trying to clear off for the distant Lachlan,  and I spending half my time in using them as divining rods,  and the other half in execrating back and forward in search of that mallee.  It was about midnight when I gave it best.  I must have struck the wrong spot.   Now--would it be advisable to make a bee-line to the"]]]
