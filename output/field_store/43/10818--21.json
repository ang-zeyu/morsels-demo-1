Morphia is present in good  opium to the extent of about 10 per cent. In medicine it is a most useful  agent in allaying pain. It first produces a stimulating action, which is  followed by drowsiness, a disposition to sleep or complete anesthesia,  depending on the quantity of the drug used. In poisonous doses a state of  exhilaration is well marked at first. This is particularly noticeable in  cattle and in horses. The animal becomes much excited, and this stage does  not pass into insensibility unless an enormous dose has been given. If the  dose is large enough, a second stage sometimes supervenes, in which the  symptoms are those of congestion of the brain. The visible membranes have a  bluish tint (cyanotic) from interference with the air supply. The breathing  is slow, labored, and later stertorous; the pupils of the eyes are very  much contracted; the skin dry and warm. Gas accumulates in the stomach, so  that tympanites is a prominent symptom. The patient may be aroused by great  noise or the infliction of sharp pain, when the breathing becomes more  natural. A lapse into the comatose condition takes place when the  excitement ceases. Later, there is perfect coma and the patient can no  longer be aroused from the insensible condition. The contraction of the  pupil becomes more marked, the breathing intermittent and slower, there is  perspiration, the pulse more feeble and rapid, till death takes place.  Poisoning of cattle with opium or its products rarely goes beyond the stage  of excitement, because the quantity of the drug required for the later  effects is so great. Seventy-five grains of morphia administered  subcutaneously has sufficed merely to excite for 12 hours.    _Treatment._--Give strong coffee, 1 to 4 quarts, aromatic spirits of  ammonia or carbonate of ammonia. Atropia is the physiological antidote.      STRYCHNIN POISONING.    Strychnin is a very concentrated poison and produces its effect very  quickly, usually only a few minutes being necessary if given in sufficient  dose and in such a way that it will be at once absorbed. When employed as a  medicine, as a rule, minimum doses should be used, as cattle are quite  susceptible to its effects and may be killed by the maximum doses given in  the common manuals of veterinary medicine. The first noticeable symptom is  evidence of unrest or mental excitement; at the same time the muscles over  the shoulder and croup may be seen to quiver or twitch, and later there  occurs a more or less well-marked convulsion; the head is jerked back, the  back arched and leg extended, the eyes drawn. The spasm continues for only  a few minutes, when it relaxes and another occurs in a short time. The  return is hastened by excitement and in a short time again disappears,  continuing to disappear and reappear until death results. As the poisonous  effect advances the intervals between the spasms become shorter and less  marked and the spasms more severe until the animal dies in violent  struggles.    _Treatment._--The best method is to put the patient under the influence of  chloral, chloroform, or ether, and keep it there continuously until the  effect of the poison has passed off. Alcohol may be given in large doses.      ACONITE POISONING.    In recent years tincture of aconite has become a popular stable remedy. If  an animal is ailing, aconite is given whether indicated or not. Fortunately  the dose used is generally small, and for this reason the damage done is  much less than it would otherwise be. Aconite is one of the most deadly  poisons known. It produces paralysis of motion and sensation, depresses the  heart's action, and causes death by paralysis of respiration. In large  doses it causes profuse salivation, champing of the jaws, and attempts at  swallowing. If not sufficient to cause death, there is impaired appetite  with more or less nausea for some time after. In poisonous doses it causes  the animal to tremble violently, to lose power to support itself, and  brings on slight convulsions, with perspiration. The pulse is depressed,  irregular, and afterwards intermittent.    _Treatment._--The chemical antidote is tannic acid, which forms an  insoluble compound with the aconitin. The depressing effect on the heart  should be counteracted by the use of ammonia, digitalis, alcohol, camphor,  or other diffusible stimulants, which have a physiological effect opposite  to aconite.      POISONOUS PLANTS.    An important group of poisons may be classed under this head. In most cases  it is poison naturally belonging in the plant; in other cases the poisonous  principle is developed in what would otherwise be harmless plants as a  plant disease, or as a fermentation or putrefaction due to bacterial growth  and observed in forage, grain, or meal that has become heated, damaged, or  \"spoilt.\"    The subject of poisonous plants is an important one and is of especial  interest to those using the western stock ranges, for it is probable that  there is no other single cause producing so many fatalities. In this  article only a few of the more important plants are treated in a brief way,  for an extended treatise would be necessary if the subject were to be  handled adequately. Further information should be sought in the more  elaborate publications. Many of the American poisonous plants have been  treated in bulletins issued by the United States Department of Agriculture.    _Treatment for plant poisoning._--Remedies given by the mouth in most cases  fail to give relief to cattle affected by poisonous plants. The material of  the poisonous plants in the first stomach is not very largely affected by a  remedy given as a drench. If any beneficial result is effected, it must be  on the material which has already passed into the fourth stomach, so that  to get any real antidotal result the remedy must be given repeatedly in  order to meet the alkaloid poisons as they are passing through the fourth  stomach. While certain substances like tannic acid and potassium  permanganate are the logical antidotes for plant poisons, in practical  application they are very disappointing in the treatment of ruminant  animals. Reliance must be mainly on prevention and upon such remedies as  will increase elimination. A laxative or purgative is always helpful, and  for this purpose Epsom salt may be given in pound doses, or linseed oil in  doses of 1 or 2 pints. In some few cases special remedies can be given as  is indicated below.    It is well to bear in mind that cattle while grazing freely in good pasture  are not likely to eat poisonous plants to any extent. If these same plants  are gathered and thrown in a pile, the animals, through a kind of  pernicious curiosity, may eat them with disastrous results. This has  frequently happened when freshly cut branches of cherry, yew, oleander, and  other plants have been thrown where dairy cattle could get at them.      OAKS.    The foliage of oaks is a valuable constituent of the forage on many ranges  and pastures. It has been shown, however, that when this is eaten without  some admixture of other food, cattle frequently sicken and die. Many cases  of the poisoning of cattle by acorns have been reported in England and  Germany, and there have been some complaints in the United States. Harmful  results from eating acorns do not seem likely to occur except as they are  eaten in considerable quantities.    _Symptoms._--The symptoms of oak poisoning are constipation, mucus and  blood in the feces, emaciation, and edema. The symptoms of acorn poisoning  are much the same.    _Treatment._--Change of pasture or an addition of other food material.      HORSE CHESTNUT--BUCKEYE.    All the species of _AEsculus,_ popularly known as horse chestnut or buckeye,  are considered poisonous. The bark, leaves, and fruit are injurious. It is  said that if the fruit is boiled or roasted and washed out it becomes  harmless and even is a desirable addition to the feed of cattle. The  Indians in time of scarcity of food have used the fruit after preparing it  in this way. The buckeyes are said to have a specific effect in producing  abortion in cattle and goats.      DEATH CAMAS (SPECIES OF ZYGADENUS).    The death-camas plants, which are commonly known in the Pacific States as  \"lobelia,\" are especially destructive of sheep, but cattle sometimes eat  them and are poisoned. Cases of cattle poisoning are not likely to result  fatally.    _Symptoms._--The symptoms are salivation, nausea accompanied by vomiting,  great weakness, and lowered temperature.    _Treatment._--There is no effective treatment for death-camas poisoning.      FLY POISON (CHROSPERMA MUSCAETORIUM).    This plant, which is closely related to the death-camas plants, is  sometimes known as \"stagger grass\" and causes a considerable loss in the  Southern States. It grows earlier than the grasses, and on this account is  more likely to be eaten. Like death camas, it produces pronounced nausea,  resulting in vomiting and weakness, and in cases which recover the effects  may continue for several days. Apparently the injurious effects are more  common in the case of cattle than in other domestic animals. There is no  known way of treating these animals, though doubtless purgatives would be  beneficial.      YEW (TAXUS BACCATA).    The European yew has long been known as a very poisonous plant. It is  cultivated in America, and while cases of poisoning have not been common,  it is well to recognize its dangerous character. A comparatively small dose  is poisonous and ordinarily acts with great rapidity. It causes respiratory  paralysis and the animal dies in convulsions.      LAUREL.    The laurels, including the broad-leafed laurel, _Kalmia latifolia_, the  narrow-leafed laurel, _Kalmia angustifolia_, the rhododendrons, and other  closely related plants are poisonous and cause considerable losses. It is  dangerous to let"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3032"],[0,"The Fathers of the Constitution: A Chronicle of the Establishment of the Union (#17)"],[1,"the punishment of treason; but treason itself  was defined in the Constitution, and it was further asserted that  a person could be convicted of treason only on the testimony of two  witnesses, and that attainder of treason should not \"work corruption of  blood nor forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.\"  Arising more nearly out of their own experience was the prohibition  of export taxes, of capitation taxes, and of the granting of titles of  nobility.    While the committee of detail was preparing its report, the Southern  members of that committee had succeeded in getting a provision inserted  that navigation acts could be passed only by a two-thirds vote of  both houses of the legislature. New England and the Middle States were  strongly in favor of navigation acts for, if they could require all  American products to be carried in American-built and American-owned  vessels, they would give a great stimulus to the ship-building and  commerce of the United States. They therefore wished to give Congress  power in this matter on exactly the same terms that other powers were  granted. The South, however, was opposed to this policy, for it wanted  to encourage the cheapest method of shipping its raw materials. The  South also wanted a larger number of slaves to meet its labor demands.  To this need New England was not favorably disposed. To reconcile the  conflicting interests of the two sections a compromise was finally  reached. The requirement of a two-thirds vote of both houses for the  passing of navigation acts which the Southern members had obtained was  abandoned, and on the other hand it was determined that Congress should  not be allowed to interfere with the importation of slaves for twenty  years. This, again, was one of the important and conspicuous compromises  of the Constitution. It is liable, however, to be misunderstood, for one  should not read into the sentiment of the members of the Convention  any of the later strong prejudice against slavery. There were some  who objected on moral grounds to the recognition of slavery in the  Constitution, and that word was carefully avoided by referring to \"such  Persons as any States now existing shall think proper to admit.\" And  there were some who were especially opposed to the encouragement of  that institution by permitting the slave trade, but the majority of the  delegates regarded slavery as an accepted institution, as a part of the  established order, and public sentiment on the slave trade was not much  more emphatic and positive than it is now on cruelty to animals. As  Ellsworth said, \"The morality or wisdom of slavery are considerations  belonging to the States themselves,\" and the compromise was nothing more  or less than a bargain between the sections.    The fundamental weakness of the Confederation was the inability of the  Government to enforce its decrees, and in spite of the increased powers  of Congress, even including the use of the militia \"to execute the  laws of the Union,\" it was not felt that this defect had been entirely  remedied. Experience under the Confederation had taught men that  something more was necessary in the direction of restricting the  States in matters which might interfere with the working of the central  Government. As in the case of the powers of Congress, the Articles of  Confederation were again resorted to and the restrictions which had  been placed upon the States in that document were now embodied in the  Constitution with modifications and additions. But the final touch was  given in connection with the judiciary.    There was little in the printed draft and there is comparatively little  in the Constitution on the subject of the judiciary. A Federal Supreme  Court was provided for, and Congress was permitted, but not required, to  establish inferior courts; while the jurisdiction of these tribunals was  determined upon the general principles that it should extend to cases  arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, to  treaties and cases in which foreigners and foreign countries were  involved, and to controversies between States and citizens of different  States. Nowhere in the document itself is there any word as to that  great power which has been exercised by the Federal courts of  declaring null and void laws or parts of laws that are regarded as in  contravention to the Constitution. There is little doubt that the more  important men in the Convention, such as Wilson, Madison, Gouverneur  Morris, King, Gerry, Mason, and Luther Martin, believed that the  judiciary would exercise this power, even though it should not be  specifically granted. The nearest approach to a declaration of this  power is to be found in a paragraph that was inserted toward the end  of the Constitution. Oddly enough, this was a modification of a clause  introduced by Luther Martin with quite another intent. As adopted it  reads: \"That this Constitution and the Laws of the United States... and  all Treaties... shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges  in every State shall be bound thereby; any Thing in the Constitution or  Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\" This paragraph may  well be regarded as the keystone of the constitutional arch of national  power. Its significance lies in the fact that the Constitution is  regarded not as a treaty nor as an agreement between States, but as a  law; and while its enforcement is backed by armed power, it is a law  enforceable in the courts.    One whole division of the Constitution has been as yet barely referred  to, and it not only presented one of the most perplexing problems which  the Convention faced but one of the last to be settled--that providing  for an executive. There was a general agreement in the Convention that  there should be a separate executive. The opinion also developed quite  early that a single executive was better than a plural body, but that  was as far as the members could go with any degree of unanimity. At the  outset they seemed to have thought that the executive would be dependent  upon the legislature, appointed by that body, and therefore more or  less subject to its control. But in the course of the proceedings the  tendency was to grant greater and greater powers to the executive; in  other words, he was becoming a figure of importance. No such office as  that of President of the United States was then in existence. It was a  new position which they were creating. We have become so accustomed to  it that it is difficult for us to hark back to the time when there was  no such officer and to realize the difficulties and the fears of the men  who were responsible for creating that office.    The presidency was obviously modeled after the governorship of the  individual States, and yet the incumbent was to be at the head of the  Thirteen States. Rufus King is frequently quoted to the effect that the  men of that time had been accustomed to considering themselves subjects  of the British king. Even at the time of the Convention there is good  evidence to show that some of the members were still agitating the  desirability of establishing a monarchy in the United States. It was a  common rumor that a son of George III was to be invited to come over,  and there is reason to believe that only a few months before the  Convention met Prince Henry of Prussia was approached by prominent  people in this country to see if he could be induced to accept the  headship of the States, that is, to become the king of the United  States. The members of the Convention evidently thought that they were  establishing something like a monarchy. As Randolph said, the people  would see \"the form at least of a little monarch,\" and they did not want  him to have despotic powers. When the sessions were over, a lady asked  Franklin: \"Well, Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?\" \"A  republic,\" replied the doctor, \"if you can keep it.\"    The increase of powers accruing to the executive office necessitated  placing a corresponding check upon the exercise of those powers. The  obvious method was to render the executive subject to impeachment,  and it was also readily agreed that his veto might be overruled by a  two-thirds vote of Congress; but some further safeguards were necessary,  and the whole question accordingly turned upon the method of his  election and the length of his term. In the course of the proceedings of  the Convention, at several different times, the members voted in favor  of an appointment by the national legislature, but they also voted  against it. Once they voted for a system of electors chosen by the State  legislatures and twice they voted against such a system. Three times  they voted to reconsider the whole question. It is no wonder that Gerry  should say: \"We seem to be entirely at a loss.\"    So it came to the end of August, with most of the other matters disposed  of and with the patience of the delegates worn out by the long strain  of four weeks' close application. During the discussions it had become  apparent to every one that an election of the President by the people  would give a decided advantage to the large States, so that again there  was arising the divergence between the large and small States. In order  to hasten matters to a conclusion, this and all other vexing details  upon which the Convention could not agree were turned over to a  committee made up of a member from each State. It was this committee  which pointed the way to a compromise by which the choice of the  executive was to be entrusted to electors chosen in each State as its  legislature might direct. The electors were to be equal in number to  the State's representation in Congress, including both senators and  representatives, and in each State they were to meet and to vote for  two persons, one of whom should not be an inhabitant of that State. The  votes were to be listed and sent to"]]]
