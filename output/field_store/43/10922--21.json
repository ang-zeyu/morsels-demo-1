Nothing more thoughtful, more refined, more feeling, can be  conceived.\" In another passage he writes: \"I love them (the robins),  but they fill a much smaller part than the blackbird does in my heart.  To hear the blackbird talking to his mate a field off, with  deliberate, refined conversation, the very acme of grace and courtesy,  is perfectly splendid.\"    There are two more common British songsters that produce much the same  effect as the willow wren and blackbird; these are the swallow and  pied wagtail. They are not in the first rank as melodists, and I can  find no explanation of the fact that they please me better than the  great singers other than their more human-like tones, which to my  hearing have something of an exceedingly beautiful contralto sound.  The swallow's song is familiar to every one, but that of the wagtail  is not well known. The bird has two distinct songs: one, heard  oftenest in early spring, consists of a low rambling warble, with some  resemblance to the whinchat's song; it is the second song, heard  occasionally until late June, frequently uttered on the wing--a  torrent of loud, rapidly uttered, and somewhat swallow-like  notes--that comes nearest in tone to the human voice, and has the  greatest charm.    After these, we find other songsters with one or two notes, or a  phrase, human-like in quality, in their songs. Of these I will only  mention the blackcap, linnet, and tree-pipit. The most beautiful of  the blackcap's notes, which come nearest to the blackbird, have this  human sound; and certainly the most beautiful part of the linnet's  song is the opening phrase, composed of notes that are both  swallow-like and human-like.    It may appear strange to some readers that I put the tree-pipit, with  his thin, shrill, canary-like pipe, in this list; but his notes are  not all of this character; he is moreover a most variable singer; and  it happens that in some individuals the concluding notes of the song  have more of that peculiar human quality than any other British  songster. No doubt it was a bird in which these human-like,  languishing notes at the close of the song were very full and  beautiful that inspired Burns to write his \"Address to a Wood-lark.\"  The tree pipit is often called by that name in Scotland, where the  true wood-lark is not found.       O stay, sweet warbling wood-lark, stay,     Nor quit for me the trembling spray,     A hopeless lover courts thy lay,         Thy soothing, fond complaining.       Again, again that tender part,     That I may catch thy melting art;     For surely that would touch her heart         Who kills me wi' disdaining.       Say, was thy little mate unkind,     And heard thee as the passing wind?     O nocht but love and sorrow joined         Sic notes o' wae could waken!       Thou tells o' never-ceasing care,     O' speechless grief and dark despair;     For pity's sake, sweet bird, nae mair,         Or my poor heart is broken!    Much more could be said about these and other species in the passerine  order that have some resemblance, distinct or faint, to the human  voice in their singing notes--an echo, as it were, of our own common  emotions, in most cases simply glad or joyous, but sometimes, as in  the case of the tree-pipit, of another character. And even those  species that are furthest removed from us in the character of the  sounds they emit have some notes that suggest a highly brightened  human voice. Witness the throstle and nightingale. The last approaches  to the human voice in that rich, musical throb, repeated many times  with passion, which is the invariable prelude to his song; and again,  in that \"one low piping note, more sweet than all,\" four times  repeated in a wonderfully beautiful crescendo. Who that ever listened  to Carlotta Patti does not remember sounds like these from her lips?  It was commonly said of her that her voice was bird-like; certainly it  was clarified and brightened beyond other voices--in some of her notes  almost beyond recognition as a human voice. It was a voice that had a  great deal of the quality of gladness in it, but less depth of human  passion than other great singers. Still, it was a human voice; and,  just as Carlotta Patti (outshining the best of her sister-singers even  as the diamond outsparkles all other gems) rose to the birds in her  miraculous flights, so do some of the birds come down to and resemble  us in their songs.    If I am right in thinking that it is the human note in the voices of  some passerine birds that gives a peculiar and very great charm to  their songs, so that an inferior singer shall please us more than one  that ranks high, according to the accepted standard, it remains to ask  why it should be so. Why, I mean, should the mere likeness to a human  tone in a little singing-bird impart so great a pleasure to the mind,  when the undoubtedly human-like voices of many non-passerine species  do not as a rule affect us in the same way? As a matter of fact, we  find in the multitude of species that resemble us in their voices a  few, outside of the order of singers, that do give us a pleasure  similar to that imparted by the willow wren, swallow, and tree-pipit.  Thus, among British birds we have the wood-pigeon, and the stock-dove;  the green woodpecker, with his laugh-like cry; the cuckoo, a universal  favourite on account of his double fluty call; and (to those who are  not inclined to be superstitious) the wood-owl, a most musical  night-singer; and the curlew, with, in a less degree, various other  shore birds. But in a majority of the larger birds of all orders the  effect produced is different, and often the reverse of pleasant. Or if  such sounds delight us, the feeling differs in character from that  produced by the melodious singer, and is mainly due to that wildness  with which we are in sympathy expressed by such sounds. Human-like  voices are found among the auks, loons, and grebes; eagles and  falcons; cuckoos, pigeons, goatsuckers, owls, crows, rails, ducks,  waders, and gallinaceous birds. The cries and shrieks of some among  these, particularly when heard in the dark hours, in deep woods and  marshes and other solitary places, profoundly impress and even startle  the mind, and have given rise all the world over to numberless  superstitious beliefs. Such sounds are supposed to proceed from  devils, or from demons inhabiting woods and waters and all desert  places; from night-wandering witches; spirits sent to prophesy death  or disaster; ghosts of dead men and women wandering by night about the  world in search of a way out of it; and sometimes human beings who,  burdened with dreadful crimes or irremediable griefs, have been  changed into birds. The three British species best known on account of  their supernatural character have very remarkable voices with a human  sound in them: the raven with his angry, barking cry, and deep, solemn  croak; the booming bittern; and the white or church owl, with his  funereal screech.    It is, I think, plain that the various sensations excited in us by the  cries, moans, screams, and the more or less musical notes of different  species, are due to the human emotions which they express or seem to  express. If the voice simulates that of a maniac, or of a being  tortured in body or mind, or overcome with grief, or maddened with  terror, the blood-curdling and other sensations proper to the occasion  will be experienced; only, if we are familiar with the sound or know  its cause, the sensation will be weak. Similarly, if in some deep,  silent wood we are suddenly startled by a loud human whistle or  shouted \"Hi!\" although we may know that a bird, somewhere in that  waste of foliage around us, uttered the shout, we yet cannot help  experiencing the feelings--a combination of curiosity, amusement, and  irritation--which we should have if some friend or some human being  had hailed us while purposely keeping out of sight. Finally, if the  bird-sounds resemble refined, bright, and highly musical human voices,  the voices, let us say, of young girls in conversation, expressive of  various beautiful qualities--sympathy, tenderness, innocent mirth, and  overflowing gladness of heart--the effect will be in the highest  degree delightful.    Herbert Spencer, in his account of the origin of our love of music in  his Psychology, writes: \"While the tones of anger and authority are  harsh and coarse, the tones of sympathy and refinement are relatively  gentle and of agreeable timbre. That is to say, the timbre is  associated in experience with the receipt of gratification, has  acquired a pleasure-giving quality, and consequently the tones which  in music have an allied timbre become pleasure-giving and are called  beautiful. Not that this is the sole cause of their pleasure-giving  quality.... Still, in recalling the tones of instruments which  approach the tones of the human voice, and observing that they seem  beautiful in proportion to their approach, we see that this secondary  aesthetic element is important.\"    As with instruments, so it is with bird voices; in proportion as they  approach the tones of the human voice, expressive of sympathy,  refinement, and other beautiful qualities, they will seem  beautiful--in some cases even more beautiful than those which, however  high they may rank in other ways, are yet without this secondary  aesthetic element.          CHAPTER VII    SECRET OF THE CHARM OF FLOWERS      When my mind was occupied with the subject of the last chapter--the  human quality in some sweet bird voices--it struck me forcibly that  all resemblances to man in the animal and vegetable worlds and in  inanimate nature, enter largely into and strongly colour our aesthetic  feelings. We have but to listen to the human tones in wind and water,  and in animal voices; and to recognise the human shape in plant, and  rock, and cloud, and in the round heads of certain mammals,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37814"],[0,"The Story of Magellan and The Discovery of the Philippines (#17)"],[1,"ory, but the  good of the world in his life. He was ever ready to put his own interest  aside in the service of that which was best for others. He had sought  welfare and not wealth, service and not self, and his life was about to  end in the unselfish spirit in which it had lived.    On Friday, April 26, 1520, Zula, one of the great chiefs of the Island  of Matan, sent to Magellan one of his sons and two goats as a present.  He had promised his service to the King of Spain, but this surrender of  royalty had been opposed by another chief named Silapalapa. This chief  had declared with native spirit that Matan would never submit to the  Spanish King.    \"But I can overthrow Silapalapa,\" ran the Matan chief's message, \"if I  can have your help. Send me a boatload of men. Let them come to-morrow  night.\"    Magellan received the message and the presents in a friendly feeling,  and resolved to follow the chief's lead.    \"I will not send another on this expedition so full of peril,\" he  thought. \"I will lead it myself.\"    So he set out from Zubu to Matan at midnight, with sixty men, in  corselets and helmets. He took with him the Christian King, and the  chief men of his new adherents.    The boats moved silently over the tropic waters under the moon and  stars. Magellan had become a happy man. He could not doubt that he was  on his way to new victories. Pigafetta, the Italian, always true to the  Admiral, was with him.    The expedition arrived at Matan just before the dawn of the morning.    The mellow nature of Magellan came back to him on this short night  journey. He had no wish to slaughter men.    So he spoke to a Moorish merchant.    \"Go to the natives,\" he said, \"and tell them if they will recognize a  Christian King as their sovereign I will become their friend. If not,  that they must feel our lances.\"    The Moorish ambassador was landed, and met the chiefs.    \"Go tell your master,\" they said, \"that if he has lances, so have we,  and our lances are hardened by fire.\"    At the red dawn of the morning, the Admiral gave the order to  disembark, and forty-nine men leaped into the water. They faced a fierce  army, some fifteen hundred in number.    Magellan divided his followers into two bands. The musketeers and cross  bowmen began the attack. But the firing was not effective. The black  army moved down upon them like a cloud, throwing javelins and spears  hardened with fire. Some of them singled out Magellan. They threw at him  lances pointed with iron.    Magellan, seeing that the odds were against him in such a contest,  sought to break their lines by firing their houses. Some thirty houses  burst into flame.    The sight of the fire maddened the natives and rendered them furious.  They discovered that the legs of the invaders were exposed, and that  they could be wounded there with poisoned arrows.    A poisoned arrow was aimed at Magellan. It pierced him in the leg. He  felt the wound, and knew its import.    He gave orders to retreat. A panic ensued, and his men took to flight.    The air was filled with arrows, spears, stones, and mud.    The Spaniards tried to escape to the boat. The islanders followed them  and directed their fury to Magellan. They struck him twice on his  helmet.    Magellan's thought now was not for himself, but for the safety of his  men.    He stood at his own post fighting that they might make safe their  retreat.    He thus broke the assault for nearly an hour, until he was almost left  alone.    An Indian suddenly rushed down toward him having a cane lance. He thrust  this into his face. Magellan wounded the Indian, and attempted to draw  his sword. But he had received a javelin wound in his arm, and his  strength failed.    Seeing him falter, the Indian rushed upon him and brought him down to  the earth with a rude sword.    The Indians now fell upon him and ran him through with lances.    He tried to rise up, to see if his men were safe. He did not call for  assistance, but to the last sought to secure the safety of his men. In  fact, he never seemed to so much as think of himself in the whole  contest. It was thus that his life went out, and his heart ceased to  beat. He was left dead on the sand, on April 27, 1521. The natives  refused to surrender his body. Eight of his own men and four Indians,  who had become Christians, perished with him.    [Illustration: The death of Magellan.]    There was one man who was true to the Admiral to the end. He was wounded  with him, but survived. He it was that saw that the Admiral had  forgotten himself at the hour of the final conflict. It was Pigafetta,  the Italian, whose narrative we are following.    This hero of the pen says of him to whom he gave his heart:    \"One of his principal virtues was constancy in the most adverse  fortune.\"    \"It was God who made me the messenger of the new heavens and new earth,  and told me where to find them,\" said Columbus. \"Maps, charts, and  mathematical knowledge had nothing to do with the case.\"    As sublime an inspiration is seen in the words of Pigafetta in regard to  Magellan:    \"_No one gave to him the example how to encompass the globe._\" His sight  was the inner eye, the pure vision of a consecrated purpose in life.    No hero of the sea has ever been more noble! His purpose in life was  everything; he had the faith of a Christian Knight; he was as nothing to  himself, but to others all, and he died giving his own body for a shield  to his men. His name will always be associated with what is glorious in  the history of the Philippines.    Magellan was dead, but a good purpose lives in others. Magellan dead,  Del Cano yet lives, and the Italian historian has other scenes to  record.    The farol of Magellan will go on; it will never cease to shine, and the  cast-out name of the Christian Knight will become a fixed star amid the  lights that have inspired the world.          CHAPTER XXI.    THE SPICE ISLANDS.--WONDERFUL BIRDS.--CLOVES, CINNAMON, NUTMEGS,  GINGER.--THE SHIPS OVERLOADED.      The massacre at Matan caused the Spaniards to lose credit in the eyes of  the natives. The King of Seba turned against them, thus throwing a  shadow on the glory of Magellan's missionary work. The Spaniards were,  however, much to blame for the change that took place in the King's  heart.    Their ships were becoming unseaworthy.    They were reduced to two ships, the Victoria and the Trinidad, and these  shaped their course for the Moluccas, or Spice Islands, by the way of  Borneo. Del Cano began to represent the spirit of Magellan among the  crews.    They came to the Bornean city, Brunei, \"a collection of houses built on  piles over the water, where were twenty-five thousand fires or  families.\" On the shore was the palace of a voluptuous Sultan, its walls  hung with brocades of silk. Here was also one of the most curious  markets in all the world, carried on at high tide, when there gathered  a great army of canoes.    On November 8, 1521, the two ships anchored off Tidor on the Spice  Islands, saluting the King of the place with a broadside.    They concluded a treaty of peace with the King, and began to load the  two ships with spice, and especially with cloves, a kind of spice at  that time regarded as a great luxury in Spain.    If Pigafetta had desired above all things to see the wonders of the  ocean world, he must again have been gratified here at some of the  presents sent to the ships by the natives. Columbus had brought to Spain  gorgeous parrots or macaws. But the King of Batchian sent to him a bird  whose plumage surpassed anything that he had ever seen.    \"It is the bird of Paradise,\" said the agent of the royal almoner.    The Italian did not doubt it. He wished to learn the history of this  superb inhabitant of the air.    He did in a way that excited his wonder beyond measure.    The bird, after the Mohammedan account, was born in Paradise. It came  down from Heaven where dwelt departed souls, who had died true to the  Moslem faith.    These birds were found dead, and they had no feet. If Pigafetta inquired  the cause of this, he doubtless was answered:    \"They do not need feet; they never alight on the ground.\"    But as greatly as the Chevalier must have wondered, he was not induced  to accept the Moslem faith.    They overcrowded the ships while receiving the favors of the Sultan of  Tidor.    An account of their voyage about the Spice Islands, \"most delightful to  read,\" as we are told in the title, was written by one Maximilianus  Transylvanus, from which we gather the following incidents (Hakluyt  Society) of great pearls and strange men:    \"They came to the shores of the Island of Solo, where they heard that  there were pearls as big as dove's eggs, and sometimes as hen's eggs,  but which can only be fished up from the very deepest sea. Our men  brought no large pearl, because the season of the year did not allow of  the fishery. But they testify that they had taken an oyster in that  region, the flesh of which weighed forty-seven pounds. For which reason  I could easily believe that pearls of that great size are found there;  for it is clearly proved that pearls are the product of shellfish. And  to omit nothing, our men constantly affirm that the islanders of Porne  told him that the King wore in his crown two pearls of the size of a  goose's egg.    \"Hence they went to the Island of Gilo, where they saw men with ears so  long and pendulous that they reached to their shoulders. When our men  were mightily astonished at this, they learnt from the natives that  there was another island not far off where the men had ears not only  pendulous, but so long and broad that one of them would cover the whole  head if they wanted it (_cum exusu esset_). But our men, who sought not  monsters but spices, neglecting this nonsense, went straight to the  Moluccas, and they discovered them eight months after their Admiral,  Magellan, had fallen in Matan. The islands are five in "]]]
