One of the  great qualifications for Yoga is \"right notion\" \"Right notion\"  means that the thought shall correspond with the outside truth;  that a man shall he fundamentally true, so that his thought  corresponds to fact; unless there is truth in a man, Yoga is for  him impossible. Missing the point, illogical, stupid, making the  important, unimportant and vice versa. Lastly, instability: which  makes Yoga impossible, and even a small amount of which makes  Yoga futile; the unstable man cannot be a yogi.          Capacities of Yoga        Can everybody practise Yoga? No. But every well-educated person  can prepare for its future practice. For rapid progress you must  have special capacities, as for anything else. In any of the  sciences a man may study without being the possessor of very  special capacity, although he cannot attain eminence therein; and  so it is with Yoga. Anybody with a fair intelligence may learn  something from Yoga which he may advantageously practice, but he  cannot hope unless he starts with certain capacities, to be a  success in Yoga in this life. It is only right to say that; for  if any special science needs particular capacities in order to  attain eminence therein, the science of sciences certainly cannot  fall behind the ordinary sciences in the demands that it makes on  its students.    Suppose I am asked: \"Can I become a great mathematician?\" What  must be my answer? \"You must have a natural aptitude and capacity  for mathematics to be a great mathematician. If you have not that  capacity, you cannot be a great mathematician in this life.\" But  this does not mean that you cannot learn any mathematics. To be a  great mathematician you must be born with a special capacity for  mathematics. To be born with such a special capacity means that  you have practiced it in very many lives and now you are born  with it ready-made. It is the same with Yoga. Every man can learn  a little of it. But to be a great Yogi means lives of practice.  If these are behind you, you will have been born with the  necessary faculties in the present birth.    There are three faculties which one must have to obtain success  in Yoga. The first is a strong desire. \"Desire ardently.\" Such a  desire is needed to break the strong links of desire which knit  you to the outer world. Moreover, without that strong desire you  will never go through all the difficulties that bat your way. You  must have the conviction that you will ultimately succeed, and  the resolution to go on until you do succeed. It must be a desire  so ardent and so firmly rooted, that obstacles only make it more  keen. To such a man an obstacle is like fuel that you throw on a  fire. It burns but the more strongly as it catches hold of it and  finds it fuel for the burning. So difficulties and obstacles are  but fuel to feed the fire of the yogi's resolute desire. He only  becomes the more firmly fixed, because he finds the difficulties.    If you have not this strong desire, its absence shows that you  are new to the work, but you can begin to prepare for it in this  life. You can create desire by thought; you cannot create desire  by desire. Out of the desire nature, the training of the desire  nature cannot come.    What is it in us that calls out desire? Look into your own mind,  and you will find that memory and imagination are the two things  that evoke desire most strongly. Hence thought is the means  whereby all the changes in desire can be brought about. Thought,  imagination, is the only creative power in you, and by  imagination your powers are to be unfolded. The more you think of  a desirable object, the stronger becomes the desire for it. Then  think of Yoga as desirable, if you want to desire Yoga. Think  about the results of Yoga and what it means for the world when  you have become a yogi, and you will find your desire becoming  stronger and stronger. For it is only by thought that you can  manage desire. You can do nothing with it by itself. You want the  thing, or you do not want it, and within the limits of the desire  nature you are helpless in its grasp. As just said, you cannot  change desire by desire. You must go into another region of your  being, the region of thought, and by thought you can make  yourself desire or not desire, exactly as you like, if only you  will use the right means, and those means, after all, are fairly  simple. Why is it you desire to possess a thing? Because you  think it will make you happier. But suppose you know by past  experience that in the long run it does not make you happier, but  brings you sorrow, trouble, distress. You have at once, ready to  your hands, the way to get rid of that desire. Think of the  ultimate results. Let your mind dwell carefully on all the  painful things. Jump over the momentary pleasure, and fix your  thought steadily on the pain which follows the gratification of  that desire. And when you have done that for a month or so, the  very sight of those objects of desire will repel you. You will  have associated it in your mind with suffering, and will recoil  from it instinctively. You will not want it. You have changed the  want, and have changed it by your power of imagination. There is  no more effective way of destroying a vice than by deliberately  picturing the ultimate results of its indulgence. Persuade a  young man who is inclined to be profligate to keep in his mind  the image of an old profligate; show him the profligate worn out,  desiring without the power to gratify; and if you can get him to  think in that way, unconsciously he will begin to shrink from  that which before attracted him; the very hideousness of the  results frightens away the man from clinging to the object of  desire. And the would-be yogi has to use his thought to mark out  the desires he will permit, and the desires that he is determined  to slay.    The next thing after a strong desire is a strong will. Will is  desire. transmuted, its directing is changed from without to  within. If your will is weak, you must strengthen it. Deal with  it as you do with other weak things: strengthen it by practice.  If a boy knows that he has weak arms, he says: \"My arms are weak,  but I shall practice gymnastics, work on the parallel bars: thus  my arms. will grow strong.\" It is the same with the will.  Practice will make strong the little, weak will that you have at  present.    Resolve, for example, saying: \"I will do such and such thing  every morning,\" and do it. One thing at a time is enough for a  feeble will. Make yourself a promise to do such and such a thing  at such a time, and you will soon find that you will be ashamed  to break your promise. When you have kept such a promise to  yourself for a day, make it for a week, then for a fortnight.  Having succeeded, you can choose a harder thing to do, and so on.  By this forcing of action, you strengthen the will. Day after day  it grows greater in power, and you find your inner strength  increases. First have a strong desire. Then transmute it into a  strong will.    The third requisite for Yoga is a keen and broad intelligence.  You cannot control your mind, unless you have a mind to control.  Therefore you must develop your mind. You must study. By study, I  do not mean the reading of books. I mean thinking. You may read a  dozen books and your mind may be as feeble as in the beginning.  But if you have read one serious book properly, then, by slow  reading and much thinking, your intelligence will be nurtured and  your; mind grow strong.    These are the things you want--a strong desire, an indomitable  will, a keen. intelligence. Those are the capacities that you  must unfold in order that the practice of Yoga may be possible to  you. If your mind is very unsteady, if it is a butterfly mind  like a child's, you must make it steady. That comes by close  study and thinking. You must unfold the mind by which you are to  work.          Forthgoing and Returning        It will help you, in doing this and in changing your desire, if  you realise that the great evolution of humanity goes on along  two paths--the Path of Forthgoing, and the Path of Return.    On the Path, or marga, of Pravritti--forthgoing on which are the  vast majority of human beings, desires are necessary and useful.  On that path, the more desire a man has, the better for his  evolution. They are the motives that prompt to activity. Without  these the stagnates, he is inert. Why should Isvara have filled  the worlds with desirable objects if He did not intend that  desire should be an ingredient in evolution? He deals with  humanity as a sensible mother deals -with her child. She does not  give lectures to the child on the advantages of walking nor  explain to it learnedly the mechanism of the muscles of the leg.  She holds a bright glittering toy before the child, and says:  \"Come and get it.\" Desire awakens, and the child begins to crawl,  and so it learns to walk. So Isvara has put toys around us, but  always just out of our reach, and He says: \"Come, children, take  these. Here are love, money, fame, social consideration; come and  get them. Walk, make efforts for them.\" And we, like children,  make great efforts and struggle along to snatch these toys. When  we seize the toy, it breaks into pieces and is of no use. People  fight and struggle and toil for wealth, and, when they become  multi-millionaires, they ask: \"How shall we spend this wealth?\" I  read of a millionaire in America, who was walking on foot from  city to city, in order to distribute the vast wealth which he  accumulated. He learned his lesson. Never in another life will  that man be induced to put forth efforts for the toy of wealth.  Love of fame, love of power, stimulate men to most strenuous  effort. But when they are grasped and held in the hand, weariness  is the result. The mighty statesman, the leader of the nation,  the man idolised by millions--follow him home, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4294"],[0,"Tales of Aztlan; The Romance of a Hero of Our Late Spanish-American War, (#17)"],[1," maidens.    Saturn gave her his ring of amethysts and Uranus the greenish  malachite, of buoyant hope the emblem. This, in time, was changed to  copper, the king of all commercial metals.    Mars gave the bloodstone. From it came soldiers bold, heroes who fought  Apaches and the Spaniard.    The winged Mercury on passing tossed her two stones, most precious; the  lodestone and a Blackstone. The lodestone was a stone of grit. When  Arizona placed it in her crib thence came the lucky prospector who  sinks his shafts through earth and rock in search of mineral treasure.    Then opened she the Blackstone and lo, from it arose the men of  eloquence who aided by retainers fight keenly in continued terms for  order, law and justice with weapons that are mightier than the sword  which giveth glory, eternal rest and immortality to heroes only whom it  smiteth.    Behold, a shadow now fell on the Earth and as a serpent coils and  creeping stretches forth its slimy length, it came apace.    Foreboding evil it announced the knight-errant of never-ending space, a  wicked comet. To Arizona gave he playthings many: the rattlesnake,  hairy tarantelas and stinging scorpions, horned toads and centipedes, a  scented hydrophobia-cat, the Gila monster, a Mexican and the Apache;  also a thorny cactus plant.    Anon the tricky Hassayampa rose from his source. On mischief bent he  overflowed his bed, teasing the infant Arizona. He worried her, poor  dearie--dear till she shed tears and nature adding to the gush of  waters there flowed a brackish stream away; now named Saltriver and on  its banks nested the Phoenix.    From Elysium in his chariot descended then the sungod to nurse his  infant daughter. He dried the Hassayampa's bed in the hot desert sand  and where man-like, incautiously he scorched the hem of Arizona's  dress--where now lies Yuma--there the temperature rose ten degrees  hotter than hades; but luckily since then it has cooled off as much.    The happy maiden smiled with joy as Apollo kissed her long and often.  He took the turquoise from the skies, an emblem of unfaltering faith.  It and a lock of shining hair he gave her. That hid she in her rocky  bed where it became gold of the mint; the filthy lucre of unworthiness  and avarice, a blessing when in charity bestowed; a boon as the reward  of honest labor!    With lengthening shadows Luna, night's gentle goddess came, a full mile  nearer to Arizona than to other lands beaming her softest rays over the  sleeping child. Under the lunar kisses woke Arizona and stored the  moonshine in her gown. That nature has transformed to silver; serving  the poor man as his needed coin.    In sadness waned the moon, for caught between the horns of a dilemma  she had no wealth left to endow the infant with. Intemperate habits had  the goddess always, was often full and now reduced to her last quarter,  but that was waning fast and her man's shadow also growing less. Her  semi-transparent stone, alas! had given she long since to California,  but this proudest of all daughters of the seas did not appreciate the  kindly gift. She cast it on the white sands of her beaches where it is  gathered by the thankful tourist who shouts exultantly, delighted with  his find:      The moonstone, climate, atmosphere,    The only things free-gratis here--    Eureka!    I have found!          A ROYAL FIASCO.    (HISTORICAL ANECDOTES.)      A village on the coast of northern Germany, where the Elbe flows into  the North Sea, was my birthplace, its parsonage, my childhood's home.    Two great earth-dikes which sheltered our village from fierce  southwesterly gales were the only barrier standing between untold  thousands of lives and watery graves, for the coasts of Holland and  northern Germany are below the level of high tides.    It is known that through inundations caused by breaks in these levees,  occurring as late as the tenth and eleventh centuries of our era more  than three hundred thousand persons with all their domestic cattle were  drowned over night.    These dikes which extend for many miles along the banks of the river  were erected by the systematic herculean toil of generations of our  ancestors.    According to a popular tradition it was Rolof, the dwarf, a thrall of  Vulcan, who taught my forefathers the art of forging tools from iron  ore, enabling them to battle successfully against the might of Neptune.    They blunted the angry sea-god's trident with their plows and shovels  and repulsed him at the very threshold of his element, stemming the  inroads of hungry seas with their stupendous handiwork which still  stands intact, an imposing monument to the memory of my forebears,  being their children's children's most precious inheritance.    On the soil which my ancestors reclaimed from the sea they founded  their homes and sowed grasses and cereals.    But ere long a dire calamity came over the land, for at the command of  the revengeful Neptune his mermaids spewed sea-foam into the river's  fresh water addling it with their fish-tails into a nasty brine.    Luckily the good dwarf who in his youth had served his term of  apprenticeship at the court of King Gambrinus and was therefore master  of the noble craft of brewing kindly taught my forefathers to brew a  foaming draught from the malt of barleycorn, which thereafter they  drank instead of water.    And now all seafaring men who navigate the river Elbe between Cuxhaven  and Hamburg are still troubled with a tremendous thirst which nothing  but foaming lager beer may quench.    The founding of the village's church dates from the conversion of Saxon  tribes who inhabited that country. The chapel's original walls were  built of rock, but its newer part was constructed of brick-work during  the fourteenth century.    Our domicile, the parsonage, although not quite as ancient, was a very  picturesque ruin with its moss-covered roof of thatched straw, under  which a flock of sparrows made their homes; but a modern building, how  prosaic-looking it might be, or deficient in uniqueness and the charm  of its surroundings, would undeniably have made a better, more sanitary  and comfortable residence.    Mother, at least, thought this when father landed her, his blushing  bride at the ancient parsonage in a rain storm which compelled them to  retire for the night under the shelter of an umbrella; and thus the  honeymoon of their married life waxed with uncommon hardship.    Later the old leaky house received a tile roof, part of it was removed  and with it the room where first I saw the light of day.    That was a cold day for father indeed, as there was another mouth to be  fed then, a very serious problem for a poor parson to solve.    When my aunt remarked that I looked like a \"monk\" father eyed me  thoughtfully, saying: \"Perhaps there is something to Darwin's theory  after all,\" but mother took me to her arms, withering her sister with  scornful glances of her flashing eyes. \"Certainly does he look like a  monk, the poor little tiddledee-diddy darling,\" she said; \"what else  would you expect of him, being the son of a preacher and a descendant  of priests?\"    On a certain fateful summer day when assembled at dinner we heard the  rumble of wheels as an imperial post-chaise hove into view, lumbering  lazily past the parsonage.    The postillion's horn sounded a letter-call and my sisters rushed out,  racing over our lawn to the gate, in order to take the message. They  returned with a large envelope bearing great official seals, both girls  struggling for its possession and fighting like cats for the privilege  of carrying the precious document. Mother's face was wreathed in smiles  of ecstacy.    \"Your salary, papa,\" she whispered, but father was very solemn. \"No,  dear, it is not due,\" he answered. He took the missive from my sister's  hands and turned it over and over, guessing at its contents until  mother who was favored with more of that quality which is commonly  called \"presence of mind\" urged him to open it, and see.    An ashen pallor spread over father's countenance, the letter dropped  from his hand and he would have fallen if mother had not caught him in  her arms. She grabbed the evil message, slipping it into the bosom of  her gown, where it could do no further harm.    Then she guided father's faltering steps to the sanctity of his studio,  where he wrote his sermons and closed the door.    My sisters availed themselves of the opportunity to make a raid on  mother's pantry, but I, poor little innocent, waited in the corridor  for mother's return, dreading to hear the worst. I heard my dear father  groan aloud and bemoan his fate and listened to mother's soothing  sympathetic words as she begged father to be calm and bear it like a  man and a Christian.    When at last mother came out I flew to her. She took me to her arms,  kissing my tear-stained face.    \"Poor little boy,\" she said, \"cheer up and you shall have a big cookie,  don't you cry!\"    \"Oh, mamma,\" I faltered, \"will papa die?\"    \"No, sonny, that he won't,\" said she with a determined glint of her  eyes and a twitching of the corners of her mouth, \"for I won't let him;  but he does suffer anguish!\"    \"Oh, tell me, mamma, what misfortune has befallen us,\" I cried.    \"It is very sad,\" said mother. \"Your father, who is the finest speaker  in the country, has been commanded by a worshipful senate and most  honorable civic corporation of the Free City of Hamburg to appear  before the visiting king in full dress, and officiate as orator of the  day at a reception to be tendered his majesty by our city\"--here mother  broke down completely, overwhelmed by grief and wept copiously into her  handkerchief.    \"Oh, oh,\" I wailed, \"do say it, mamma!\"    \"And--and your father has no coat!\" she sobbed. \"Poor man, he fears  disgrace and dreads the loss of preferment and of a royal decoration,  perhaps. He will have to feign sickness as an excuse for his absence;  but I"]]]
