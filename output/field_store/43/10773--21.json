The ruling passion strong in death!    Yes! Sir Percy would be on the southern ramparts of Boulogne one  hour after sunset on the day named, trusting, no doubt, in his usual  marvellous good-fortune, his own presence of mind and his great physical  and mental strength, to escape from the trap into which he was so ready  to walk.    That remained beyond a doubt! Therefore what mattered details?    But even at this moment, Chauvelin had already resolved on one great  thing: namely, that on that eventful day, nothing whatever should be  left to Chance; he would meet his cunning enemy not only with cunning,  but also with power, and if the entire force of the republican army  then available in the north of France had to be requisitioned for the  purpose, the ramparts of Boulogne would be surrounded and no chance of  escape left for the daring Scarlet Pimpernel.    His wave of meditation, however, was here abruptly stemmed by Blakeney's  pleasant voice.    \"Lud! Monsieur Chauvelin,\" he said, \"I fear me your luck has deserted  you. Chance, as you see, has turned to me once more.\"    \"Then it is for you, Sir Percy,\" rejoined the Frenchman, \"to name the  conditions under which we are to fight.\"    \"Ah! that is so, is it not, Monsieur?\" quoth Sir Percy lightly. \"By my  faith! I'll not plague you with formalities.... We'll fight with our  coats on if it be cold, in our shirtsleeves if it be sultry.... I'll  not demand either green socks or scarlet ornaments. I'll even try and  be serious for the space of two minutes, sir, and confine my whole  attention--the product of my infinitesimal brain--to thinking out some  pleasant detail for this duel, which might be acceptable to you. Thus,  sir, the thought of weapons springs to my mind.... Swords you said, I  think. Sir! I will e'en restrict my choice of conditions to that of the  actual weapons with which we are to fight.... Ffoulkes, I pray you,\" he  added, turning to his friend, \"the pair of swords which lie across the  top of my desk at this moment....    \"We'll not ask a menial to fetch them, eh, Monsieur?\" he continued  gaily, as Sir Andrew Ffoulkes at a sign from him had quickly left the  room. \"What need to bruit our pleasant quarrel abroad? You will like the  weapons, sir, and you shall have your own choice from the pair.... You  are a fine fencer, I feel sure... and you shall decide if a scratch or  two or a more serious wound shall be sufficient to avenge Mademoiselle  Candeille's wounded vanity.\"    Whilst he prattled so gaily on, there was dead silence among all  those present. The Prince had his shrewd eyes steadily fixed upon him,  obviously wondering what this seemingly irresponsible adventurer held  at the back of his mind. There is no doubt that everyone felt oppressed,  and that a strange murmur of anticipatory excitement went round the  little room, when, a few seconds later, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes returned,  with two sheathed swords in his hand.    Blakeney took them from his friend and placed them on the little table  in front of ex-Ambassador Chauvelin. The spectators strained their necks  to look at the two weapons. They were exactly similar one to the  other: both encased in plain black leather sheaths, with steel ferrules  polished to shine like silver; the handles too were of plain steel,  with just the grip fashioned in a twisted basket pattern of the same  highly-tempered metal.    \"What think you of these weapons, Monsieur?\" asked Blakeney, who was  carelessly leaning against the back of a chair.    Chauvelin took up one of the two swords and slowly drew it from out its  scabbard, carefully examining the brilliant, narrow steel blade as he  did so.    \"A little old-fashioned in style and make, Sir Percy,\" he said, closely  imitating his opponent's easy demeanour, \"a trifle heavier, perhaps,  than we in France have been accustomed to lately, but, nevertheless, a  beautifully tempered piece of steel.\"    \"Of a truth there's not much the matter with the tempering, Monsieur,\"  quoth Blakeney, \"the blades were fashioned at Toledo just two hundred  years ago.\"    \"Ah! here I see an inscription,\" said Chauvelin, holding the sword close  to his eyes, the better to see the minute letters engraved in the steel.    \"The name of the original owner. I myself bought them--when I travelled  in Italy--from one of his descendants.\"    \"Lorenzo Giovanni Cenci,\" said Chauvelin, spelling the Italian names  quite slowly.    \"The greatest blackguard that ever trod this earth. You, no doubt,  Monsieur, know his history better than we do. Rapine, theft, murder,  nothing came amiss to Signor Lorenzo... neither the deadly drug in the  cup nor the poisoned dagger.\"    He had spoken lightly, carelessly, with that same tone of easy banter  which he had not forsaken throughout the evening, and the same drawly  manner which was habitual to him. But at these last words of his,  Chauvelin gave a visible start, and then abruptly replaced the  sword--which he had been examining--upon the table.    He threw a quick, suspicious glance at Blakeney, who, leaning back  against the chair and one knee resting on the cushioned seat, was  idly toying with the other blade, the exact pair to the one which the  ex-ambassador had so suddenly put down.    \"Well, Monsieur,\" quoth Sir Percy after a slight pause, and meeting  with a swift glance of lazy irony his opponent's fixed gaze. \"Are you  satisfied with the weapons? Which of the two shall be yours, and which  mine?\"    \"Of a truth, Sir Percy...\" murmured Chauvelin, still hesitating.    \"Nay, Monsieur,\" interrupted Blakeney with pleasant bonhomie, \"I know  what you would say... of a truth, there is no choice between this pair  of perfect twins: one is as exquisite as the other.... And yet you must  take one and I the other... this or that, whichever you prefer....  You shall take it home with you to-night and practise thrusting at a  haystack or at a bobbin, as you please... The sword is yours to command  until you have used it against my unworthy person... yours until you  bring it out four days hence--on the southern ramparts of Boulogne, when  the cathedral bells chime the evening Angelus; then you shall cross  it against its faithless twin.... There, Monsieur--they are of equal  length... of equal strength and temper... a perfect pair... Yet I pray  you choose.\"    He took up both the swords in his hands and carefully balancing them by  the extreme tip of their steel-bound scabbards, he held them out towards  the Frenchman. Chauvelin's eyes were fixed upon him, and he from his  towering height was looking down at the little sable-clad figure before  him.    The Terrorist seemed uncertain what to do. Though he was one of  those men whom by the force of their intellect, the strength of their  enthusiasm, the power of their cruelty, had built a new anarchical  France, had overturned a throne and murdered a king, yet now, face to  face with this affected fop, this lazy and debonnair adventurer, he  hesitated--trying in vain to read what was going on behind that low,  smooth forehead or within the depth of those lazy, blue eyes.    He would have given several years of his life at this moment for one  short glimpse into the innermost brain cells of this daring mind, to see  the man start, quiver but for the fraction of a second, betray himself  by a tremor of the eyelid. What counterplan was lurking in Percy  Blakeney's head, as he offered to his opponent the two swords which had  once belonged to Lorenzo Cenci?    Did any thought of foul play, of dark and deadly poisonings linger in  the fastidious mind of this accomplished gentleman?    Surely not!    Chauvelin tried to chide himself for such fears. It seemed madness even  to think of Italian poisons, of the Cencis or the Borgias in the midst  of this brilliantly lighted English drawing-room.    But because he was above all a diplomatist, a fencer with words and with  looks, the envoy of France determined to know, to probe and to read. He  forced himself once more to careless laughter and nonchalance of manner  and schooled his lips to smile up with gentle irony at the good-humoured  face of his arch-enemy.    He tapped one of the swords with his long pointed finger.    \"Is this the one you choose, sir?\" asked Blakeney.    \"Nay! which do you advise, Sir Percy,\" replied Chauvelin lightly. \"Which  of those two blades think you is most like to hold after two hundred  years the poison of the Cenci?\"    But Blakeney neither started nor winced. He broke into a laugh, his own  usual pleasant laugh, half shy and somewhat inane, then said in tones of  lively astonishment:    \"Zounds! sir, but you are full of surprises.... Faith! I never would  have thought of that....Marvellous, I call it... demmed marvellous....  What say you, gentlemen?... Your Royal Highness, what think you?... Is  not my engaging friend here of a most original turn of mind.... Will you  have this sword or that, Monsieur?... Nay, I must insist--else we shall  weary our friends if we hesitate too long.... This one then, sir, since  you have chosen it,\" he continued, as Chauvelin finally took one of  the swords in his hand. \"And now for a bowl of punch.... Nay, Monsieur,  'twas demmed smart what you said just now... I must insist on your  joining us in a bowl.... Such wit as yours, Monsieur, must need whetting  at times. ... I pray you repeat that same sally again...\"    Then finally turning to the Prince and to his friends, he added:    \"And after that bowl, gentlemen, shall we rejoin the ladies?\"          Chapter XIII: Reflections        It seemed indeed as if the incident were finally closed, the chief  actors in the drama having deliberately vacated the centre "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27868"],[0,"The Glow-Worm and Other Beetles (#17)"],[1,"th, the insect  moults for a last time, in the usual manner, in order to attain its  final form. The wing-cases are now of a uniform yellowish white, as  are the wings, the abdomen and the greater part of the legs; very  nearly all the rest of the body is of a glossy black. In the space of  twenty-four hours, the wing-cases assume their half-black, half-russet  colouring; the wings grow darker; and the legs finish turning black.  This done, the adult organism is completed. However, the Sitaris  remains still a fortnight in the intact shell, ejecting at intervals  white droppings of uric acid, which it pushes back together with the  shreds of its last two sloughs, those of the tertiary larva and of the  nymph. Lastly, about the middle of August, it tears the double bag  that contains it, pierces the lid of the Anthophora's cell, enters a  corridor and appears outside in quest of the other sex.    I have told how, while digging in search of the Sitaris, I found two  cells belonging to _Meloe cicatricosus_. One contained an Anthophora's  egg; with this egg was a yellow Louse, the primary larva of the Meloe.  The history of this tiny creature we know. The second cell also was  full of honey. On the sticky liquid floated a little white larva,  about a sixth of an inch in length and very different from the other  little white larvae belonging to Sitares. The rapid fluctuations of  the abdomen showed that it was eagerly drinking the strong-scented  nectar collected by the Bee. This larva was the young Meloe in the  second period of its development.    I was not able to preserve these two precious cells, which I had  opened wide to examine the contents. On my return from Carpentras, I  found that their honey had been spilt by the motion of the carriage  and that their inhabitants were dead. On the 25th of June, a fresh  visit to the nests of the Anthophorae furnished me with two larvae  like the foregoing, but much larger. One of them was on the point of  finishing its store of honey, the other still had nearly half left.  The first was put in a place of safety with a thousand precautions,  the second was at once immersed in alcohol.    These larvae are blind, soft, fleshy, yellowish white, covered with a  fine down visible only under the lens, curved into a fish-hook like  the larvae of the Lamellicorns, to which they bear a certain  resemblance in their general configuration. The segments, including  the head, number thirteen, of which nine are provided with  breathing-holes with a pale, oval rim. These are the mesothorax and  the first eight abdominal segments. As in the Sitaris-larvae, the last  pair of stigmata, that of the eighth segment of the abdomen, is less  developed than the rest.    The head is horny, of a light brown colour. The epistoma is edged with  brown. The labrum is prominent, white and trapezoidal. The mandibles  are black, strong, short, obtuse, only slightly curved, sharp-edged  and furnished each with a broad tooth on the inner side. The maxillary  and labial palpi are brown and shaped like very small studs with two  or three joints to them. The antennae, inserted just at the base of  the mandibles, are brown, and consist of three sections: the first is  thick and globular; the two others are much smaller in diameter and  cylindrical. The legs are short, but fairly strong, able to serve the  creature for crawling or digging; they end in a strong black claw. The  length of the larva when fully developed is one inch.    As far as I can judge from the dissection of the specimen preserved in  alcohol, whose viscera were affected by being kept too long in that  liquid, the nervous system consists of eleven ganglia, not counting  the oesophageal collar; and the digestive apparatus does not differ  perceptibly from that of an adult Oil-beetle.    The larger of the two larvae of the 25th of June, placed in a  test-tube with what remained of its provisions, assumed a new form  during the first week of the following month. Its skin split along the  front dorsal half and, after being pushed half back, left partly  uncovered a pseudochrysalis bearing the closest analogy with that of  the Sitares. Newport did not see the larva of the Oil-beetle in its  second form, that which it displays when it is eating the mess of  honey hoarded by the Bees, but he did see its moulted skin  half-covering the pseudochrysalis which I have just mentioned. From  the sturdy mandibles and the legs armed with a powerful claw which he  observed on this moulted skin, Newport assumed that, instead of  remaining in the same Anthophora-cell, the larva, which is capable of  burrowing, passes from one cell to another in search of additional  nourishment. This suspicion seems to me to be well-founded, for the  size which the larva finally attains exceeds the proportions which the  small quantity of honey enclosed in a single cell would lead us to  expect.    Let us go back to the pseudochrysalis. It is, as in the Sitares, an  inert body, of a horny consistency, amber-coloured and divided into  thirteen segments, including the head. Its length is 20  millimetres.[1] It is slightly curved into an arc, highly convex on  the dorsal surface, almost flat on the ventral surface and edged with  a projecting fillet which marks the division between the two. The head  is only a sort of mask on which certain features are vaguely carved in  still relief, corresponding with the future parts of the head. On the  thoracic segments are three pairs of tubercles, corresponding with the  legs of the recent larva and the future insect. Lastly, there are nine  pairs of stigmata, one pair on the mesothorax and the eight following  pairs on the first eight segments of the abdomen. The last pair is  rather smaller than the rest, a peculiarity which we have already  noted in the larva which precedes the pseudochrysalis.    [Footnote 1: .787 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]    On comparing the pseudochrysalids of the Oil-beetles and Sitares, we  observe a most striking similarity between the two. The same structure  occurs in both, down to the smallest details. We find on either side  the same cephalic masks, the same tubercles occupying the place of the  legs, the same distribution and the same number of stigmata and,  lastly, the same colour, the same rigidity of the integuments. The  only points of difference are in the general appearance, which is not  the same in the two pseudochrysalids, and in the covering formed by  the cast skin of the late larva. In the Sitares, in fact, this cast  skin constitutes a closed bag, a pouch completely enveloping the  pseudochrysalis; in the Oil-beetles, on the contrary, it is split down  the back and pushed to the rear and, consequently, only half-covers  the pseudochrysalis.    The post-mortem examination of the only pseudochrysalis in my  possession showed me that, similarly to that which happens in the  Sitares, no change occurred in the organization of the viscera,  notwithstanding the profound transformations which take place  externally. In the midst of innumerable little sacs of adipose tissue  is buried a thin thread in which we easily recognize the essential  features of the digestive apparatus, both of the preceding larval form  and of the perfect insect. As for the medullary cord of the abdomen,  it consists, as in the larva, of eight ganglia. In the perfect insect  it comprises only four.    I could not say positively how long the Oil-beetle remains in the  pseudochrysalid form; but, if we consider the very complete analogy  between the evolution of the Oil-beetles and that of the Sitares,  there is reason to believe that a few pseudochrysalids complete their  transformation in the same year, while others, in greater numbers,  remain stationary for a whole year and do not attain the state of the  perfect insect until the following spring. This is also the opinion  expressed by Newport.    Be this as it may, I found at the end of August one of these  pseudochrysalids which had already attained the nymphal stage. It is  with the help of this precious capture that I shall be able to finish  the story of the Oil-beetle's development. The horny integuments of  the pseudochrysalis are split along a fissure which includes the whole  ventral surface and the whole of the head and runs up the back of the  thorax. This cast skin, which is stiff and keeps its shape, is  half-enclosed, as was the pseudochrysalis, in the skin shed by the  secondary larva. Lastly, through the fissure, which divides it almost  in two, a Meloe-nymph half-emerges; so that, to all appearances, the  pseudochrysalis has been followed immediately by the nymph, which does  not happen with the Sitares, which pass from the first of these two  states to the second only by assuming an intermediary form closely  resembling that of the larva which eats the store of honey.    But these appearances are deceptive, for, on removing the nymph from  the split sheath formed by the integuments of the pseudochrysalis, we  find, at the bottom of this sheath, a third cast skin, the last of  those which the creature has so far rejected. This skin is even now  adhering to the nymph by a few tracheal filaments. If we soften it in  water, we easily recognize that it possesses an organization almost  identical with that which preceded the pseudochrysalis. In the latter  case only, the mandibles and the legs are not so robust. Thus, after  passing through the pseudochrysalid stage, the Oil-beetles for some  time resume the preceding form, almost without modification.    The nymph comes next. It presents no peculiarities. The only nymph  that I have reared attained the perfect insect state at the end of  September. Under ordinary conditions would the adult Oil-beetle have  emerged from her cell at this period? I do not think so, since the  pairing and egg-laying do not take place until the beginning of  spring. She would no doubt have spent the autumn and the winter in the"]]]
