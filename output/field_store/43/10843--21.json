At daybreak the next morning the aggageers in high glee mounted their  horses, and with a long retinue of camels and men, provided with axes  and knives, together with large gum sacks to contain the flesh, they  quitted the camp to cut up the numerous elephants. As I had no taste for  this disgusting work, I took two of my Tokrooris, Hadji Ali and Hassan,  and, accompanied by old Abou Do, the father of the sheik, with  his harpoon, we started along the margin of the river in quest of  hippopotami.    The harpoon for hippopotamus and crocodile hunting is a piece of soft  steel about eleven inches long, with a narrow blade or point of about  three quarters of an inch in width and a single but powerful barb. To  this short and apparently insignificant weapon a strong rope is secured,  about twenty feet in length, at the extremity of which is a buoy or  float, as large as a child's head, formed of an extremely light wood  called ambatch (Aanemone mirabilis) that is of about half the specific  gravity of cork. The extreme end of the short harpoon is fixed in the  point of a bamboo about ten feet long, around which the rope is twisted,  while the buoy end is carried in the left hand.    The old Abou Do, being resolved upon work, had divested himself of his  tope or toga before starting, according to the general custom of the  aggageers, who usually wear a simple piece of leather wound round the  loins when hunting; but, I believe in respect for our party, they had  provided themselves with a garment resembling bathing drawers, such as  are worn in France, Germany, and other civilized countries. But the old  Abou Do had resisted any such innovation, and he accordingly appeared  with nothing on but his harpoon; and a more superb old Neptune I never  beheld. He carried this weapon in his hand, as the trident with which  the old sea-god ruled the monsters of the deep; and as the tall Arab  patriarch of threescore years and ten, with his long gray locks flowing  over his brawny shoulders, stepped as lightly as a goat from rock to  rock along the rough margin of the river, I followed him in admiration.    After walking about two miles we noticed a herd of hippopotami in a pool  below a rapid. This was surrounded by rocks, except upon one side, where  the rush of water had thrown up a bank of pebbles and sand. Our old  Neptune did not condescend to bestow the slightest attention when I  pointed out these animals; they were too wide awake; but he immediately  quitted the river's bed, and we followed him quietly behind the fringe  of bushes upon the border, from which we carefully examined the water.    About half a mile below this spot, as we clambered over the intervening  rocks through a gorge which formed a powerful rapid, I observed, in  a small pool just below the rapid, the immense head of a hippopotamus  close to a perpendicular rock that formed a wall to the river, about six  feet above the surface. I pointed out the hippo to old Abou Do, who had  not seen it. At once the gravity of the old Arab disappeared, and the  energy of the hunter was exhibited as he motioned us to remain, while  he ran nimbly behind the thick screen of bushes for about a hundred and  fifty yards below the spot where the hippo was unconsciously basking,  with his ugly head above the surface. Plunging into the rapid torrent,  the veteran hunter was carried some distance down the stream; but,  breasting the powerful current, he landed upon the rocks on the opposite  side, and, retiring to some distance from the river, he quickly advanced  toward the spot beneath which the hippopotamus was lying. I had a fine  view of the scene, as I was lying concealed exactly opposite the hippo,  who had disappeared beneath the water.    Abou Do now stealthily approached the ledge of rock beneath which he had  expected to see the head of the animal. His long, sinewy arm was raised,  with the harpoon ready to strike, as he carefully advanced. At length he  reached the edge of the perpendicular rock. The hippo had vanished,  but, far from exhibiting surprise, the old Arab remained standing on the  sharp edge, unchanged in attitude. No figure of bronze could have been  more rigid than that of the old river-king as he stood erect upon the  rock with the left foot advanced and the harpoon poised in his ready  right hand above his head, while in the left he held the loose coils of  rope attached to the ambatch buoy. For about three minutes he stood  like a statue, gazing intently into the clear and deep water beneath his  feet. I watched eagerly for the reappearance of the hippo; the surface  of the water was still barren, when suddenly the right arm of the statue  descended like lightning, and the harpoon shot perpendicularly into  the pool with the speed of an arrow. What river-fiend answered to the  summons? In an instant an enormous pair of open jaws appeared, followed  by the ungainly head and form of the furious hippopotamus, who,  springing half out of the water, lashed the river into foam, and,  disdaining the concealment of the deep pool, charged straight up the  violent rapids. With extraordinary power he breasted the descending  stream, gaining a footing in the rapids, about five feet deep. He  ploughed his way against the broken waves, sending them in showers of  spray upon all sides, and, upon gaining broader shallows, tore along  through the water, with the buoyant float hopping behind him along the  surface, until he landed from the river, started at full gallop along  the dry shingly bed, and at length disappeared in the thorny nabbuk  jungle.    I never could have imagined that so unwieldy an animal could have  exhibited such speed; no man would have had a chance of escape, and it  was fortunate for our old Neptune that he was secure upon the high ledge  of rock; for if he had been in the path of the infuriated beast there  would have been an end of Abou Do. The old man plunged into the deep  pool just quitted by the hippo and landed upon our side, while in the  enthusiasm of the moment I waved my cap above my head and gave him  a British cheer as he reached the shore. His usually stern features  relaxed into a grim smile of delight: this was one of those moments  when the gratified pride of the hunter rewards him for any risks. I  congratulated him upon his dexterity; but much remained to be done.  I proposed to cross the river, and to follow upon the tracks of the  hippopotamus, as I imagined that the buoy and rope would catch in the  thick jungle, and that we should find him entangled in the bush; but the  old hunter gently laid his hand upon my arm and pointed up the bed of  the river, explaining that the hippo would certainly return to the water  after a short interval.    In a few minutes later, at a distance of nearly half a mile, we observed  the hippo emerge from the jungle and descend at full trot to the bed  of the river, making direct for the first rocky pool in which we had  noticed the herd of hippopotami. Accompanied by the old howarti (hippo  hunter), we walked quickly toward the spot. He explained to me that I  must shoot the harpooned hippo, as we should not be able to secure him  in the usual method by ropes, as nearly all our men were absent from  camp, disposing of the dead elephants.    Upon reaching the pool, which was about a hundred and thirty yards in  diameter, we were immediately greeted by the hippo, who snorted and  roared as we approached, but quickly dived, and the buoyant float ran  along the surface, directing his course in the same manner as the  cork of a trimmer marks that of a pike upon the hook. Several times he  appeared, but as he invariably faced us I could not obtain a favorable  shot; I therefore sent the old hunter round the pool, and he, swimming  the river, advanced to the opposite side and attracted the attention of  the hippo, who immediately turned toward him. This afforded me a good  chance, and I fired a steady shot behind the ear, at about seventy  yards, with a single-barrelled rifle. As usual with hippopotami, whether  dead or alive, he disappeared beneath the water at the shot. The crack  of the ball and the absence of any splash from the bullet told me that  he was hit; the ambatch float remained perfectly stationary upon the  surface. I watched it for some minutes--it never moved. Several heads of  hippopotami appeared and vanished in different directions, but the float  was still; it marked the spot where the grand old bull lay dead beneath.    I shot another hippo, that I thought must be likewise dead; and, taking  the time by my watch, I retired to the shade of a tree with Hassan,  while Hadji Ali and the old hunter returned to camp for assistance in  men and knives, etc.    In a little more than an hour and a half, two objects like the backs  of turtles appeared above the surface. These were the flanks of the  two hippos. A short time afterward the men arrived, and, regardless of  crocodiles, they swam toward the bodies. One was towed directly to the  shore by the rope attached to the harpoon, the other was secured by a  long line and dragged to the bank of clean pebbles. We had now a good  supply of food, which delighted our people.    I returned to the camp, and several hours elapsed, but none of the  aggageers returned, and neither had we received any tidings of our  people and camels that had left us at daybreak to search for the dead  elephants. Fearing that some mishap might have occurred in a collision  with the Bas-e, I anxiously looked out for some sign of the party. At  about 4 P.M. I observed far up the bed of the river several men,  some mounted and others upon foot, while one led a camel with a  curious-looking load. Upon a nearer approach I could distinguish upon  the camel's back some large object that was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32426"],[0,"A Synopsis of the North American Lagomorpha (#17)"],[1,"(_ibid._); Calabasas (Nelson, 1909:118).
