Counterattacks were ordered by the French general in chief, continued  during the entire retreat and had frequently brilliant results.    On August 29, 1914, a corps of the Fifth Army and of the divisions of  reserve attacked with success in the direction of St. Quentin with the  object of withdrawing the pressure on the British army. Two other corps  and a division of reserves joined issue with the Prussian Guard and the  Tenth Corps of the German army which debouched from Guise. This was a  very violent battle, known under the name of the Battle of Guise. At the  end of the day, after various fluctuations in the fight, the Germans  were thrown completely over the Oise and the entire British front was  relieved. The Prussian Guard on that occasion suffered great losses.    August 27, 1914, the Fourth Army under General de Langle de Cary  succeeded likewise in throwing the enemy across the Meuse as he  endeavored to secure a footing on the left bank. The success continued  on the 28th; on that day a division of this army (First Division of  Morocco under the orders of General Humbert) inflicted a sanguinary  defeat on a Saxon army corps in the region of Signy l'Abbaye.    Thanks to these brilliant successes, the retreat was accomplished in  good order and without the French armies being seriously demoralized; as  a matter of fact, they were actually put to flight at no point. All the  French armies were thus found intact and prepared for the offensive.    The right wing of the German army marched in the direction of Paris at  great speed, and the rapidity of the German onslaught obliged the French  General Staff to prolong the retreat until they were able to establish a  new alignment of forces. The new army established on the left of the  French armies, and intrusted to General Manoury, was not able to  complete its concentration in the localities first intended. In place of  concentrating in the region of Amiens it was obliged to operate more to  the south.    The situation on the evening of September 2, 1914, as a result of the  vigorous onward march of the German right, was as follows:    A corps of German cavalry had crossed the Oise and had reached Chateau  Thierry. The First German Army (General von Kluck), consisting of four  active army corps and a reserve corps, had passed Compiegne. The Second  Army (General von Buelow), with three active army corps and two reserve  corps, had attained to the region of Laon. The Third German Army  (General von Hausen), with two active army corps and a reserve corps,  had crossed the Aisne and reached Chateau Porcin-Attigny.    Farther to the east the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh German Armies,  making about twelve active army corps, four reserve corps, and numerous  Ersatz companies, were in contact with the French troops (Fourth and  Fifth Armies) between Vouziers and Verdun, the others from Verdun to the  Vosges. Such was the situation.    It may be seen, if a map is consulted, that the Fifth French Army,  commanded from August 30 by General Franchet d'Esperey, would have found  itself in grave peril following on the backward bending of the British  and French forces operating on its left, if the French had accepted the  challenge of a decisive battle. The French commander in chief resolutely  chose the alternative that obviated such a risk, that is, he decided on  a postponement of the offensive and the continuation of the retreat.    Already on September 1, 1914, he prescribed as the extreme limits of the  retreat the line running through Bray-sur-Seine, Nogent-sur-Seine,  Arcis-sur-Aube, Vitry-le-Francois, and the region north of Bar-le-Duc.  That line would have been reached had it been necessary. On the other  hand, it was his intention to attack before it was reached if the forces  could be offensively arrayed, allowing of the cooperation of the British  army and the army of Manoury on the left, and on the right that of the  divisions of reserve that had been held on the heights of the Meuse.    Meanwhile, late in the afternoon of August 29, 1914, the British  retirement began afresh, and 10,000 French troops also withdrew from the  Somme, blowing up the bridges as they went. Everywhere along the roads  were crowds of country folk and villagers with wagons and carts piled  high with household goods or carrying aged persons and children, all in  panic flight before the dreaded invaders, fleeing for refuge in Paris.  At various places these stricken multitudes joined the army ambulances,  taking the shortest routes. Rumors of the coming of the uhlans ran along  the straggling lines with tales of the grievous havoc and ruin which  these horsemen, vanguards of the German columns, had wrought in the  land. Hardly had the retirement begun, when a body of uhlans entered  Amiens and demanded from the mayor the surrender of the town. This was  formally given, and the civilians were ordered, on pain of death, not to  create the slightest disturbance and not to take part in any action,  overt or covert, against the soldiery. Afterward, cavalry, infantry, and  artillery took possession of the town on August 30, 1914. On the same  day a German aeroplane dropped bombs on Paris.    While retiring from the thickly wooded country south of Compiegne, the  British First Cavalry Brigade were surprised while dismounted and at  breakfast in the early morning of September 1, 1914. Moving figures on  the distant skyline first attracted the attention of those who had field  glasses, but in the dim light their identity was not at first revealed.  Suddenly all doubt was resolved by a rain of shells on the camp. Many  men and a large number of horses were killed. At once the order \"Action  front!\" rang out, and the remaining horses, five to a man, were hurried  to cover in the rear, while on the left a battery of horse artillery  went into instant action. The German attack was pressed hard, and the  battery was momentarily lost until some detachments from the British  Third Corps, with the guns of the artillery brigade, galloped up to its  support. Then they not only recovered their own guns, but also succeeded  in capturing twelve of the enemy's.    On the eventful day of September 3, 1914, the British forces reached a  position south of the Marne between Lagny and Signy-Signets. They had  defended the passage of the river against the German armies as long as  possible, and had destroyed bridges in the path of the pursuers. Next,  at General Joffre's request, they retired some twelve miles farther  southward with a view to taking a position behind the Seine. In the  meantime the Germans had built pontoon bridges across the Marne, and  were threatening the Allies all along the line of the British forces and  the Fifth and Ninth French Armies. Consequently several outpost actions  took place.    By the 1st of September, 1914, the day of the Russian victories at  Lemberg, Von Kluck's army had reached Senlis, only twenty-five miles  from Paris. Despite this imminent danger, the capital was remarkably  quiet and calm; every day, as fateful event crowded upon event, seemed  to renew the resolution and coolness of the population. It seemed  advisable, however, to transfer the seat of government for the time  being from Paris to Bordeaux, after assuring the defense of the city by  every means that could be devised.    The defenses of Paris consisted of three great intrenched camps, on the  north, east, and southwest, respectively. Of these the most important is  the last, which includes all the fortified area to the south and west of  the Seine. A railway over sixty miles in length connects all the works,  and, under the shelter of the forts, it could not only keep them  supplied with the necessary ammunition and stores, but also it could be  utilized to convey troops from point to point as they might be needed.  However, it was an open secret that even the outer and newer defenses  were not of any great strength. If the Germans broke through the  outlying circle of forts, the inner line would be of small value, and  the city itself would be exposed to long-range bombardment. Paris was  not ready for a siege, and if attacked it would speedily fall.    Early in the morning of September 3, 1914, President Poincare,  accompanied by all the ministers, left Paris, and was followed at noon  by the members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, and the reserves  of the Banque de France. The higher courts were also transferred to  Bordeaux. The municipal authority was constituted by the president of  the City Council, and the Council of the Seine Department, who were  empowered to direct civil affairs under the authority of General  Gallieni as military governor, the prefect of Paris, and the prefect of  police.    On his appointment to the command, Gallieni did what he could to  strengthen the defenses. Trenches were dug, wire entanglements were  constructed, and hundreds of buildings that had been allowed to spring  up over the military zone of defense were demolished in order to leave a  clear field of fire. The gates of the city were barred with heavy  palisades backed by sandbags, and neighboring streets also were  barricaded for fighting. Certain strategic streets were obstructed by  networks of barbed wire, and in others pits were dug to the depth of a  man's shoulders. The public buildings were barricaded with sandbags and  guarded with machine guns.    But while Paris was preparing for siege and assault the French staff  were concentrating their efforts on making a siege impossible by a  decisive stroke against the German advance.    Hardly had the Government left the city when tidings arrived that  instead of marching on Paris, General von Kluck had swung southeastward  toward the crossing of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29349"],[0,"Creatures of the Night: A Book of Wild Life in Western Britain (#17)"],[1,"curiosity as she  daintily nibbled a grain of wheat brought from a gateway where the laden  waggons had passed. He had loitered near, searching among the  grass-roots for some fragment he supposed his mother to have left  behind, but he found only a rough, prickly husk, that stuck beneath his  tongue, nearly choked him, and drove him frantic with irritation, till,  after much violent shaking and twitching, and rubbing his throat and  muzzle with his fore-paws, he managed to get rid of the objectionable  morsel. Something, however, in the taste of the husk so aroused his  appetite for solid food, that when his mother dropped the columbine seed  he at once picked it up in his fore-paws, and, stripping off the hard,  glossy covering, devoured it with the keen relish of a new hunger that  as yet he could not entirely understand. His growth, directly he learned  to feed on the seeds his mother showed him, and to forage a little for  himself, was more rapid than before. Nature seemed in a hurry to make  him strong and fat, that he might be able to endure the cold and  privation of winter.    By the end of November, when at night the first rime-frosts lay on the  fallow, and the voles, disliking the chill mists, seldom left their  burrow, Kweek was already bigger than his dam. He was, in fact, the  equal of his sire in bone and length, but he was loose-limbed and had  not filled out to those exact proportions which, among voles as among  all other wildlings of the field, make for perfect symmetry, grace, and  stamina, and come only with maturity and the first love season.    When about two months old, Kweek, for the first time since the weasels  had visited the burrow, experienced a narrow escape from death. The  night was mild and bright, and the vole was busy in the littered loam of  the hedgerow, where, during the afternoon, a blackbird had scratched the  leaves away and left some ripe haws exposed to view. Suddenly he heard a  loud, mocking call, apparently coming from the direction of the moon:  \"Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-o-o-o!\" It was a strangely bewildering sound; so the  vole squatted among the leaves and listened anxiously, every sense alert  to catch the meaning of the weird, foreboding voice. \"Whoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-o-o-o!\"--again, from directly overhead, the cry rang out into  the night. A low squeak of warning, uttered by the father vole as he  dived into his burrow, caused the young mice foraging in the undergrowth  to bolt helter-skelter towards home. Kweek, joining in the general  panic, rushed across the field, and had almost disappeared underground  when he felt the earth and the loose pebbles falling over him, and at  the same time experienced a sharp thrill of pain. Fortunately, his speed  saved him--but only by an inch. The claws of the great brown owl,  shutting like a vice as the bird \"stooped\" on her prey, laid hold of  nothing but earth and grass, though one keen talon cut the vole's tail  as with a knife, so that the little creature squealed lustily as he ran  along the gallery to seek solace from his mother's companionship in the  central chamber beyond. Yet even there he was not allowed to remain in  peace. Maddened by the scent of a few drops of blood coming from his  wound, the adult voles chased him from the burrow, and drove him out  into the field. Luckily for him the brown owl had meanwhile flown away  with another young vole in her claws. Kweek remained in safety under the  hawthorns till the grey dawn flushed the south-east sky; then, his  injured tail having ceased to bleed, he ventured without fear among his  kindred as they lay huddled asleep in the recesses of their underground  abode.    The year drew to its close, the weather became colder, and an  irresistible desire for long-continued rest took possession of Kweek.  His appetite was more easily satisfied than hitherto; hour after hour,  by night as well as by day, he drowsed in the snug corner where lay the  remains of the nest in which he had been born. Winter, weary and  monotonous to most of the wildlings of the field, passed quickly over  his head. Scarce-broken sleep and forgetfulness, when skies are grey and  tempests rage--such are Nature's gifts to the snake, the bee, and the  flower, as well as to the squirrel in the wood and the vole in the  burrow beneath the moss. Occasionally, it is true, when at noon the sun  was bright and spring seemed to have come to the Valley of Olwen, the  snake would stir in his retreat beneath the leaves, the bee would crawl  to and fro in her hidden nest, the flower would feel the stir of rising  sap, the squirrel would venture forth to stretch cramped limbs by a  visit to some particular storehouse--the existence of which, as one  among many filled with nuts and acorns, he happened to remember--and the  vole would creep to the entrance of his burrow, and sit in the welcome  warmth till the sun declined and hunger sent him to his granary for a  hearty meal. These brief, spring-like hours, when the golden furze  blossomed in the hedge-bank near the field-vole's home, and the lark,  exultant, rose from the barren stubble, were, however, full of danger to  Kweek if he but dared to lift his head above the opening of his burrow.    On the outskirts of the wood, in a rough, ivy-grown ridge where, years  ago, some trees had been felled, a flourishing colony of  bank-voles--little creatures nearly akin, and almost similar in shape  and size, to the field-voles--dwelt among the roots and the undergrowth.  These bank-voles, probably because they lived in a sheltered place  screened from the bitter wind by a wall of gorse and pines, moved abroad  in the winter days far more frequently than did the field-voles. For  several years a pair of kestrels had lived in the valley, and had reared  their young in a nest built on a ledge of rock above the Cerdyn brook  and safe beyond the reach of marauding schoolboys. The hen-kestrel, when  provender became scarce, would regularly at noon beat her way across the  hill-top to the ridge where the red voles lived, and, watching and  waiting, with keen eyes and ready talons, would remain in the air above  the burrow as if poised at the end of an invisible thread. Chiefly she  was the terror of the bank-voles; but often, impatient of failure, she  would slant her fans and drift towards the burrows in the mossy pasture,  hoping to find that the grey voles had awakened for an hour from their  winter sleep.    Once, when the breeze blew gently from the south and the sun was bright,  Kweek, sitting on a grassy mound, saw a shadow rapidly approaching, and  heard a sharp swish of powerful wings. Though drowsy and stiff from his  winter sleep, he was roused for the moment by the imminence of danger,  and, barely in time, scurried to his hole. A fortnight afterwards, when,  again tempted out of doors by the mildness of the weather, the vole was  peeping through an archway of matted grass, the hawk, with even greater  rapidity than before, shot down from the sky. Had it not been that the  long grass screened an entrance on the outskirts of the burrow, Kweek  would then have met his fate. He fell, almost without knowing what was  happening, straight down the shaft; and the sharp talons of the hawk  touched nothing but grass and earth, and the end of a tail already  scarred by the claws of the owl. Next day, as, moving along the  galleries to his favourite exit, the vole passed beneath the shaft, he  saw, straight overhead, the shadowy wings outstretched, quivering,  lifting, gliding, pausing, while beneath those spreading fans the  baleful eyes gleamed yellow in the slant of the south-west sun, and the  cruel claws, indrawn against the keel-shaped breast, were clenched in  readiness for the deadly \"stoop.\" Fascinated, the vole stayed awhile to  look at the hovering hawk. Then, as the bird passed from the line of  sight, he continued his way along the underground passage to the spot  where he usually left his home by one of the narrow, clean-cut holes  which, in a field-vole's burrow, seem to serve a somewhat similar  purpose to that of the \"bolts\" in a rabbit's warren; and there he again  looked out. The hawk still hovered in the calm winter air, so Kweek did  not venture that day to bask in the sun outside his door. As soon as he  had fed, and shaken every speck of loose loam from his fur, and washed  himself clean with his tiny red tongue, he once more sought his cosy  corner and fell asleep.    Presently a pink and purple sunset faded in the gloom of night, and a  heavy frost, beginning a month of bitter cold, lay over the fields. In  continuous slumber Kweek passed that dreary month, till the daisies  peeped in the grass, the snowdrops and the daffodils thrust forth their  sword-shaped leaves above the water-meadows, and the earliest violet  unfolded its petals by the pathway in the woods.          II.    THE VALLEY OF OLWEN.      Eastward, the sky was covered with pale cobalt; and in the midst of the  far-spreading blue hung a white and crimson cloud, like a puff of  bright-stained vapour blown up above the rim of the world. Westward, the  sky was coloured with brilliant primrose; and on the edge of the distant  moorlands lay a great bank of mist, rainbow-tinted with deep violet, and  rose, and orange. For a space immediately on each side of the mist the  primrose deepened into daffodil--a chaste yet intense splendour that  seemed to stretch into infinite distances and overlap the sharply  defined ridges of the dark horizon. The green of the upland pasture and  the brown of the ploughland beyond were veiled by a shimmering twilight  haze, in which the varied tints of the sky harmoniously blended, till  the umber and indigo shadows of night loomed over the hills, and the  daffodil flame flickered and vanished over the last red ember of the  afterglow. Thus the first calm day of early spring drew to its close.    Kweek, the little field-vole, asleep in his hidden nest"]]]
