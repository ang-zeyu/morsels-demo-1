They came to rob  his own. Maybe the _banderillero_ even dreamt that a part of the  swordsman's fortune might fall into the hands of these god-children.  Thief! A man who was not of the family!    When he did not receive Nacional's words in silence and with looks of  hatred he tried to censure him, showing himself in favor of the  immediate shooting of all who stir up rebellion and are in consequence a  danger to good citizens.    Nacional was ten years older than the _maestro_. When Gallardo began to  fight in the capeas he was already a _banderillero_ in professional  _cuadrillas_ and he had been to America where he had killed bulls in the  plaza at Lima. At the beginning of his career he enjoyed a certain  popularity on account of being young and agile. He had also shone for a  few days as \"the bull-fighter of the future,\" and the Sevillian  connoisseurs, their eyes upon him, expected him to eclipse the  bull-fighters from other lands. But this lasted only a short while. On  his return from his travels with the prestige of hazy and distant  exploits, the populace rushed to the bull-plaza of Seville to see him  kill. Thousands were unable to get in; but at the moment of final trial  \"he lacked heart,\" as the amateurs said. He lodged the _banderillas_  with skill, like a conscientious and serious workman who fulfils his  duty, but when he went in to kill the instinct of self-preservation,  stronger than his will, kept him at a distance from the bull and  prevented his taking advantage of his stature and his strong arm.  Nacional renounced the highest glories of tauromachy. _Banderillero_,  nothing more! He resigned himself to be a journeyman of his art, serving  others younger than himself and earning a meagre salary as a _peon_ to  support his family and lay by some scanty savings to establish a small  industry by and by. His kindness and his honest habits were proverbial  among the people of the _coleta_. The wife of his _matador_ was fond of  him, believing him a kind of guardian angel of her husband's fidelity.    When, in summer, Gallardo with all his people went to a music hall in  some provincial capital, eager for gambling and sport after having  despatched the bulls in several _corridas_, Nacional remained silent and  grave among the singing girls with their gauzy dress and their painted  lips, like an anchorite from the desert in the midst of the courtesans  of Alexandria. He was not scandalized but he grew sad thinking of the  wife and children that waited for him in Seville. All defects and  corruptions in the world were, in his opinion, the result of lack of  education. Of course those poor women did not know how to read and  write. The same was true of himself and, as he attributed his  insignificance and poverty of intellect to that, he laid all misery and  degradation in the world to the same cause. In his early youth he had  been an iron-founder and an active member of the International Workmen's  Union, an assiduous listener to his more fortunate fellow-workmen who  could read in a loud voice what the newspapers said of the welfare of  the people. He played at soldiering in the days of the national militia,  figuring in the battalions which wore the red cap as the sign of being  implacable federalist propagandists. He spent whole days before the  platforms raised in the public squares, where various societies declared  themselves in permanent session and orators succeeded one another day  and night, haranguing with Andalusian fluency about the divinity of  Jesus and the increase in the price of articles of prime necessity,  until, when hard times came, a strike left him in the trying situation  of the workman black-listed on account of his ideas, finding himself  turned away from every shop.    He liked bull-fighting and he became a _torero_ at twenty-four, just as  he might have chosen any other trade. He, moreover, knew a great deal  and talked with contempt of the absurdities of the present state of  society. Not for nothing does one spend years hearing the papers read!  However ill he might fare at bull-fighting he would surely earn more and  have an easier life than if he were a skilled workman. The people,  remembering the time when he shouldered the musket of the popular  militia, nicknamed him Nacional.    He spoke of the taurine profession with a certain regret, in spite of  the years he had spent therein, and he apologized for belonging to it.  The committee of his district, who had decreed the expulsion of all who  attended bull-fights on account of their barbarous and retrograding  influence, had made an exception in his favor, retaining him as an  active member in good standing.    \"I know,\" he said in Gallardo's dining-room, \"that this business of the  bulls is a reactionary thing--something belonging to the times of the  Inquisition; I don't know whether I explain myself. The people need to  learn to read and write as much as they need bread and it is not well  for them to spend their money on us while they so greatly lack  schooling. That is what the papers that come from Madri' say. But the  club members appreciate me, and the committee, after a long preachment  from Don Joselito, have agreed to keep me on the roll of membership.\"    Don Joselito, the school teacher and chairman of the committee of the  district, was a learned young man of Israelitish extraction who brought  to the political struggle the ardor of the Maccabees and was  undistressed by his brown ugliness and his small-pox scars because they  gave him a certain likeness to Danton. Nacional always listened to him  open-mouthed.    When Don Jose, Gallardo's business manager, and other friends of the  master, jokingly disputed his doctrines at those after-dinner  gatherings, making extravagant objections, poor Nacional was in  suspense, scratching his forehead from perplexity.    \"You are gentlemen and have studied and I don't know how to read or  write. That is why we of the lower class are like sheep. But if only Don  Joselito were here! By the life of the blue dove! If you could hear him  when he lets loose and talks like an angel!\"    To fortify his faith, somewhat weakened by the assaults of the jokers,  he would go the following day to see Don Joselito, who seemed to  luxuriate in bitterness, as a descendant of the persecuted chosen  people, and look over what Joselito called his museum of horrors. The  Hebrew, returned to the native land of his forefathers, was collecting  relics of the Inquisition in a room of the school, with the vengeful  accuracy of a prisoner who might reconstruct bone by bone the skeleton  of his jailor. In a bookcase stood rows of parchment tomes--decrees of  sentences pronounced by the Inquisition and catechisms for interrogating  the offender undergoing torture. On one wall hung a white banner with  the dreaded green cross. In the corners were heaped instruments of  torture--frightful scourges and fiendish devices for cleaving, for  stripping and tearing human flesh, that Don Joselito found in the shops  of the curio-dealers and catalogued as ancient belongings of the Holy  Office. Nacional's kind and simple soul, easily roused to anger, rose in  rebellion at the sight of these rusty irons and green crosses.    \"Man alive! And yet there are those that say--! By the life of the dove!  I would like to see some folks here!\"    Often in summer, when the _cuadrilla_ was going from one province to  another and Gallardo went into the second class carriage in which \"the  boys\" were travelling, some rural priest or pair of friars would get on  board. The _banderilleros_ would nudge each other with their elbows and  wink one eye looking at Nacional, who seemed even more grave and solemn  in the presence of the enemy. The _picadores_, Potaje and Tragabuches,  lusty aggressive fellows, lovers of riots and fights who felt a decided  aversion to the ecclesiastical dress, urged him on in a loud voice.    \"There's thy chance! Go at him for the good cause! Lodge one of thy  yarns in the nape of his neck.\"    The _maestro_, with all his authority as chief of _cuadrilla_, against  which none may parley nor argue, rolled his eyes, and looked at  Nacional, who maintained a silent obedience. But stronger than duty was  the impulse of his simple soul to convert, and an insignificant word was  enough to open a discussion with the travellers, to try to convince them  of the truth; and the truth was for him a kind of confused and  disordered remnant of arguments learned from Don Joselito.    His comrades looked at each other astonished at the wisdom of their  companion, well pleased that one of them should face professional people  and put them in a tight place, for they were almost invariably priests  of little learning. And the holy men, astounded at Nacional's confused  reasoning and the smiles of the other bull-fighters, finally resorted to  an extreme measure. Did men who continually exposed their lives to peril  take no thought of God and believe in such things as he said? At this  very moment how their wives and mothers must be praying for them!    The men of the _cuadrilla_ grew serious, thinking with timorous gravity  of the scapularies and medallions feminine hands had sewed to their  fighting garments before they left Seville. The _matador_, his sleeping  superstition aroused, was angry with Nacional, as though in this lack of  piety he foresaw danger to his life.    \"Keep still and don't talk any more of your crudities. Pardon, Senores!  He is a good man but his head has been turned by so many lies. Shut up  and don't give me any impertinence. Damn it all!\"    And Gallardo, to tranquillize these gentlemen whom he believed to be  trustees of the future, overwhelmed the _banderillero_ with threats and  curses.

If they had been as  long under careful management as cattle, they would now, probably, be  equally plastic in the hands of a skillful breeder.    But raising deer for profit does not necessarily imply their complete  domestication. They may be kept in large preserves with surroundings as  nearly natural as possible and their domestication entirely ignored.  Thus the breeder may reap nearly all the profit that could be expected  from a domestic herd, while the animals escape most of the dangers  incident to close captivity. But the breeder who aims at the ultimate  domestication of the animals, and whose herd approaches nearest to true  domesticity, will in the end be most successful.      SPECIES TO BE SELECTED FOR BREEDING.    The number of species of deer suited for breeding in inclosures in the  United States is great, though the chances for success are by no means  the same for all. As a rule those native to America are to be preferred,  since they are already acclimated. In selecting any species, similarity  between its natural habitat and that to which it is to be transferred  must be considered. Important, also, is its adaptability to varied  conditions, as shown by former attempts to acclimatize it.    Unless they have shown a peculiar adaptability to such change, deer  should not be taken from arid parts of the United States to humid parts.  To a disregard of this principle are probably due many of the failures  that have attended experiments in breeding the American antelope, the  Columbia blacktail deer, the moose, and other animals in places  differing widely from their natural ranges.    The history of attempts to acclimatize the several kinds of deer shows  that some readily adapt themselves to a great variety of conditions, and  efforts to introduce them into new countries have been almost uniformly  successful. Such has been the experience with the axis deer, the  Japanese and Pekin sikas, the red and the fallow deer of Europe, and  especially with the wapiti, or Rocky Mountain elk, and the Virginia  deer. While experiments with the foreign species named offer every  promise of success to the owners of American preserves, there are  obvious reasons for recommending the two native animals just mentioned  as best suited for the production of venison in the United States.      THE WAPITI, OR ROCKY MOUNTAIN ELK.    The Wapiti (_Cervus canadensis_), including two related species and a  geographic race, and known in America as the elk, is, next to the moose,  the largest of our deer. It was once abundant over the greater part of  the United States, whence its range extended northward to about latitude  60 deg. in the Peace River region of the interior of Canada. In the United  States the limits of its range eastward were the Adirondacks, western  New Jersey, and eastern Pennsylvania; southward it reaches the southern  Alleghenies, northern Texas, southern Mexico, and Arizona; and westward  the Pacific Ocean.    For the practical purposes of this bulletin all the forms of the wapiti  are treated as a single species. At the present time the range of these  animals has so far diminished that they occur only in a few scattered  localities outside of the Yellowstone National Park and the mountainous  country surrounding it, where large herds remain. Smaller herds still  occur in Colorado, western Montana, Idaho, eastern Oregon, Manitoba,  Alberta, British Columbia, and the coast mountains of Washington,  Oregon, and northwestern California. A band of the small California  valley elk still inhabits the southern part of the San Joaquin Valley.    The herds that summer in the Yellowstone National Park and in winter  spread southward and eastward in Wyoming are said to number about 30,000  head, and constitute the only large bands of this noble game animal that  are left. Although protected in their summer ranges and partially  safeguarded from destruction in winter by the State of Wyoming, there is  yet great danger that these herds may perish from lack of food in a  succession of severe winters. Partial provision for winter forage has  been made within the National Park, but the supply is inadequate for the  large number of animals. Further safeguards are needed to place the  Wyoming elk herds beyond the reach of winter starvation.    In addition to the wild herds, there are a considerable number of elk in  private game preserves and parks, as well as in nearly all the public  zoological parks and gardens of this country. The herds in captivity  form the nucleus from which, under wise management, some of the former  ranges of this animal may be restocked and from which a profitable  business of growing elk venison for market may be developed. At the  present time this species affords a most promising field for ventures in  breeding for profit.      _Habits of Elk._    The elk is both a browsing and a grazing animal. While it eats grasses  freely and has been known to subsist entirely upon pasture, it seems to  prefer a mixture of grass and browse.    The elk is extremely polygamous. The adult bulls shed their antlers  annually in March or April, and new ones attain their full size in about  ninety days. The \"velvet\" adheres until about August. While the horns  are growing the bulls usually lead solitary lives; but early in  September, when the horns are fully matured, the rutting season begins.  Fights for supremacy then take place, and the victor takes charge of as  many cows as he can round up and control. The period of gestation is  about 8-1/2 months. The female does not usually breed until the third  year, and produces but one calf at a time.    Although the elk is less prolific than the common deer and some other  species that have been bred in parks, it increases fully as rapidly as  the common red deer of Europe. Moreover, it makes up for any lack of  fecundity by its superior hardiness and ease of management. It has been  acclimatized in many parts of the world, and shows the same vigor and  hardiness wherever it has been transplanted. In Europe it has been  successfully crossed with Altai wapiti and the red deer, and in both  instances the offspring were superior in size and general stamina to the  native stock.      _Elk Venison._    The flesh of the elk, although somewhat coarse, is superior in flavor to  most venison. That of the bulls is in its best condition about the time  the velvet is shed. By the time the rut is over, in October, their flesh  is in the poorest condition. As the open season for elk is usually in  October and November, and only bulls are killed, it follows that  hunters often obtain the venison when it is poorest. The meat is not  best when freshly killed, but should be left hanging for four or five  days before it is used. Of course fat elk are better eating than lean,  and it is said that venison from castrated bulls is superior to any  other.      _Domestication of Elk._    With few exceptions the early attempts to domesticate elk were made by  men who were wealthy enough to disregard all thought of profit in  raising them. They were usually placed under the care of servants and  the bucks were left uncastrated until they became old and unmanageable.  Soon the serious problem of controlling them outweighed the novelty of  their possession, and one by one attempts at domestication were  abandoned.    A desire to preserve this important game animal has caused a renewal of  attempts to breed it in confinement, and at present there are small  herds under private ownership in many places in the United States. The  Biological Survey has recently obtained much information from owners of  herds in regard to their experience in breeding and rearing the animals,  and also their opinions as to the possibility of making the business of  raising them profitable. Of about a dozen successful breeders, nearly  all are of the opinion that raising elk for market can be made  remunerative if present laws as to the sale of the meat are modified.    [Illustration: Elk in Enclosure. Shelter in Background.]    One especially important fact has been developed by the reports from  breeders. It is that the elk readily adapts itself to almost any  environment. Even within the narrow confines of the paddocks of the  ordinary zoological park the animal does well and increases so that  periodically the herds have to be reduced by sales.    The fullest reports that have been received by the Department of  Agriculture from breeders of elk are from George W. Russ, of Eureka  Springs, Ark., through H. N. Vinall, of the Bureau of Plant Industry.    Mr. Russ has a herd of 34 elk. They have ample range in the Ozarks on  rough land covered with hardwood forest and abundant underbrush. The  animals improve the forest by clearing out part of the thicket. They  feed on buds and leaves to a height of 8 feet, and any growth under this  is liable to be eliminated if the range is restricted. If not closely  confined, elk do not eat the bark from trees, nor do they eat  evergreens. In clearing out underbrush from thickets they are more  useful than goats, since they browse higher. Goats, however, eat closer  to the ground; and as the two animals get along well together, Mr. Russ  recommends the use of both for clearing up brushy land and fitting it  for tame grasses.    The increase of elk under domestication is equal to that of cattle.  Fully 90 per cent. of the females produce healthy young. An adult male  elk weighs from 700 to 1,000 pounds; a female from 600 to 800 pounds.  The percentage of dressed meat is greater than with cattle, but, owing  to hostile game laws, experience in marketing it is very limited. An  offer of 40 cents a pound for dressed meat was received from St. Louis,  but the law would not permit its export. Mr. Russ says:    \"From the fact that as high as $1.50 per pound has been paid for this  meat in New York City and Canada, and that the best hotels and  restaurants"]]]
