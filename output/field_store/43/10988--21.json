Sheridan, General, United States Army â€” Complete (#17)"],[1,"rse, would have taken place over the prairies of southwest  Missouri.    The army set out in pursuit of Price, but I was left at Springfield  to gather supplies from the surrounding country, by the same means  that had been used at Lebanon, and send them forward.  To succeed in  this useful and necessary duty required much hard work.  To procure  the grain and to run the mills in the country, replacing the  machinery where parts had been carried away, or changing the  principle and running the mills on some different plan when  necessary, and finally forward the product to the army, made a task  that taxed the energy of all engaged in it.  Yet, having at command a  very skillful corps of millwrights, machinists, and millers, detailed  principally from the Fourth Iowa and Thirty-sixth Illinois volunteer  regiments, we soon got matters in shape, and were able to send such  large quantities of flour and meal to the front, that only the bacon  and small parts of the ration had to be brought forward from our  depot at Rolla.  When things were well systematized, I went forward  myself to expedite the delivery of supplies, and joined the army at  Cross Hollows, just south of Pea Ridge.    Finding everything working well at Cross Hollows, I returned to  Springfield in a few days to continue the labor of collecting  supplies.  On my way back I put the mills at Cassville in good order  to grind the grain in that vicinity, and perfected there a plan for  the general supply from the neighboring district of both the men and  animals of the army, so that there should, be no chance of a failure  of the campaign from bad roads or disaster to my trains.  Springfield  thus became the centre of the entire supply section.    Just after my return to Springfield the battle of Pea Ridge was  fought.  The success of the Union troops in this battle was  considerable, and while not of sufficient magnitude to affect the  general cause materially, it was decisive as to that particular  campaign, and resulted in driving all organized Confederate forces  out of the State of Missouri.  After Pea Ridge was won, certain  efforts were made to deprive Curtis of the credit due him for the  victory; but, no matter what merit belonged to individual commanders,  I was always convinced that Curtis was deserving of the highest  commendation, not only for the skill displayed on the field, but for  a zeal and daring in campaign which was not often exhibited at that  early period of the war.  Especially should this credit be awarded  him, when we consider the difficulties under which he labored, how he  was hampered in having to depend on a sparsely settled country for  the subsistence of his troops.  In the reports of the battle that  came to Springfield, much glory was claimed for some other general  officers, but as I had control of the telegraph line from Springfield  east, I detained all despatches until General Curtis had sent in his  official report.  He thus had the opportunity of communicating with  his superior in advance of some of his vain subordinates, who would  have laid claim to the credit of the battle had I not thwarted them  by this summary means.    Not long afterward came the culmination of a little difference that  had arisen between General Curtis and me, brought about, I have since  sometimes thought, by an assistant quartermaster from Iowa, whom I  had on duty with me at Springfield.  He coveted my place, and finally  succeeded in getting it.  He had been an unsuccessful banker in Iowa,  and early in the war obtained an appointment as assistant  quartermaster of volunteers with the rank of captain.  As chief  quartermaster of the army in Missouri, there would be opportunities  for the recuperation of his fortunes which would not offer to one in  a subordinate place; so to gain this position he doubtless intrigued  for it while under my eye, and Curtis was induced to give it to him  as soon as I was relieved.  His career as my successor, as well as in  other capacities in which he was permitted to act during the war, was  to say the least not savory.  The war over he turned up in Chicago as  president of a bank, which he wrecked; and he finally landed in the  penitentiary for stealing a large sum of money from the United States  Treasury at Washington while employed there as a clerk.  The chances  that this man's rascality would be discovered were much less when  chief of the departments of transportation and supply of an army than  they afterward proved to be in the Treasury.  I had in my possession  at all times large sums of money for the needs of the army, and among  other purposes for which these funds were to be disbursed was the  purchase of horses and mules.  Certain officers and men more devoted  to gain than to the performance of duty (a few such are always to be  found in armies) quickly learned this, and determined to profit by  it.  Consequently they began a regular system of stealing horses from  the people of the country and proffering them to me for purchase.  It  took but a little time to discover this roguery, and when I became  satisfied of their knavery I brought it to a sudden close by seizing  the horses as captured property, branding them U. S., and refusing to  pay for them.  General Curtis, misled by the misrepresentations that  had been made, and without fully knowing the circumstances, or  realizing to what a base and demoralizing state of things this course  was inevitably tending, practically ordered me to make the Payments,  and I refused.  The immediate result of this disobedience was a  court-martial to try me; and knowing that my usefulness in that army  was gone, no matter what the outcome of the trial might be, I asked  General Halleck to relieve me from duty with General Curtis and order  me to St. Louis.  This was promptly done, and as my connection with  the Army of Southwest Missouri was thus severed before the court  could be convened, my case never came to trial.  The man referred to  as being the cause of this condition of affairs was appointed by  General Curtis to succeed me.  I turned over to the former all the  funds and property for which I was responsible, also the branded  horses and mules stolen from the people of the country, requiring  receipts for everything.  I heard afterward that some of the blooded  stock of southwest Missouri made its way to Iowa in an unaccountable  manner, but whether the administration of my successor was  responsible for it or not I am unable to say.    On my arrival at St. Louis I felt somewhat forlorn and disheartened  at the turn affairs had taken.  I did not know where I should be  assigned, nor what I should be required to do, but these  uncertainties were dispelled in a few days by General Halleck, who,  being much pressed by the Governors of some of the Western States to  disburse money in their sections, sent me out into the Northwest with  a sort of roving commission to purchase horses for the use of the  army.  I went to Madison and Racine, Wis., at which places I bought  two hundred horses, which were shipped to St. Louis.  At Chicago I  bought two hundred more, and as the prices paid at the latter point  showed that Illinois was the cheapest market--it at that time  producing a surplus over home demands--I determined to make Chicago  the centre of my operations.    While occupied in this way at Chicago the battle of Shiloh took  place, and the desire for active service with troops became uppermost  in my thoughts, so I returned to St. Louis to see if I could not get  into the field.  General Halleck having gone down to the Shiloh  battle-field, I reported to his Assistant Adjutant-General, Colonel  John C. Kelton, and told him of my anxiety to take a hand in active  field-service, adding that I did not wish to join my regiment, which  was still organizing and recruiting at Jefferson Barracks, for I felt  confident I could be more useful elsewhere.  Kelton knew that the  purchasing duty was but temporary, and that on its completion,  probably at no distant date, I should have to join my company at the  barracks; so, realizing the inactivity to which that situation of  affairs would subject me, he decided to assume the responsibility of  sending me to report to General Halleck at Shiloh, and gave me an  order to that effect.    This I consider the turning-point in my military career, and shall  always feel grateful to Colonel Kelton for his kindly act which so  greatly influenced my future.  My desire to join the army at Shiloh  had now taken possession of me, and I was bent on getting there by  the first means available.  Learning that a hospital-boat under  charge of Dr. Hough was preparing to start for Pittsburg Landing, I  obtained the Doctor's consent to take passage on it, and on the  evening of April 15, I left St. Louis for the scene of military  operations in northeastern Mississippi.    At Pittsburg Landing I reported to General Halleck, who, after some  slight delay, assigned me to duty as an assistant to Colonel George  Thom, of the topographical engineers.  Colonel Thom put me at the  work of getting the trains up from the landing, which involved the  repair of roads for that purpose by corduroying the marshy places.  This was rough, hard work, without much chance of reward, but it, was  near the field of active operations, and I determined to do the best  I could at it till opportunity for something better might arise.    General Halleck did not know much about taking care of himself in the  field.  His camp arrangements were wholly inadequate, and in  consequence he and all the officers about him were subjected to much  unnecessary discomfort and annoyance.  Someone suggested to him to  appoint me quartermaster for his headquarters, with a view to  systematizing the establishment and remedying the defects complained  of, and I was consequently assigned to this duty.  Shortly after this  assignment I had the satisfaction of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4363"],[0,"Beyond Good and Evil (#17)"],[1,"that at last, as soon as he dreams, he is  conscious of the power and art of flying as his privilege and his  peculiarly enviable happiness; such a person, who believes that on the  slightest impulse, he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles, who  knows the sensation of a certain divine levity, an \"upwards\"  without effort or constraint, a \"downwards\" without descending  or lowering--without TROUBLE!--how could the man with such  dream-experiences and dream-habits fail to find \"happiness\" differently  coloured and defined, even in his waking hours! How could he fail--to  long DIFFERENTLY for happiness? \"Flight,\" such as is described by poets,  must, when compared with his own \"flying,\" be far too earthly, muscular,  violent, far too \"troublesome\" for him.    194. The difference among men does not manifest itself only in the  difference of their lists of desirable things--in their regarding  different good things as worth striving for, and being disagreed as to  the greater or less value, the order of rank, of the commonly recognized  desirable things:--it manifests itself much more in what they regard as  actually HAVING and POSSESSING a desirable thing. As regards a woman,  for instance, the control over her body and her sexual gratification  serves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the  more modest man; another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for  possession, sees the \"questionableness,\" the mere apparentness of such  ownership, and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especially  whether the woman not only gives herself to him, but also gives up for  his sake what she has or would like to have--only THEN does he look upon  her as \"possessed.\" A third, however, has not even here got to the limit  of his distrust and his desire for possession: he asks himself whether  the woman, when she gives up everything for him, does not perhaps do  so for a phantom of him; he wishes first to be thoroughly, indeed,  profoundly well known; in order to be loved at all he ventures to let  himself be found out. Only then does he feel the beloved one fully in  his possession, when she no longer deceives herself about him, when  she loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealed  insatiability, as for his goodness, patience, and spirituality. One  man would like to possess a nation, and he finds all the higher arts of  Cagliostro and Catalina suitable for his purpose. Another, with a more  refined thirst for possession, says to himself: \"One may not deceive  where one desires to possess\"--he is irritated and impatient at the idea  that a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the people: \"I must,  therefore, MAKE myself known, and first of all learn to know myself!\"  Among helpful and charitable people, one almost always finds the awkward  craftiness which first gets up suitably him who has to be helped, as  though, for instance, he should \"merit\" help, seek just THEIR help, and  would show himself deeply grateful, attached, and subservient to them  for all help. With these conceits, they take control of the needy as a  property, just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a  desire for property. One finds them jealous when they are crossed or  forestalled in their charity. Parents involuntarily make something like  themselves out of their children--they call that \"education\"; no mother  doubts at the bottom of her heart that the child she has borne is  thereby her property, no father hesitates about his right to HIS OWN  ideas and notions of worth. Indeed, in former times fathers deemed it  right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly  born (as among the ancient Germans). And like the father, so also do the  teacher, the class, the priest, and the prince still see in every new  individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession. The  consequence is...    195. The Jews--a people \"born for slavery,\" as Tacitus and the whole  ancient world say of them; \"the chosen people among the nations,\" as  they themselves say and believe--the Jews performed the miracle of the  inversion of valuations, by means of which life on earth obtained a new  and dangerous charm for a couple of millenniums. Their prophets fused  into one the expressions \"rich,\" \"godless,\" \"wicked,\" \"violent,\"  \"sensual,\" and for the first time coined the word \"world\" as a term of  reproach. In this inversion of valuations (in which is also included  the use of the word \"poor\" as synonymous with \"saint\" and \"friend\") the  significance of the Jewish people is to be found; it is with THEM that  the SLAVE-INSURRECTION IN MORALS commences.    196. It is to be INFERRED that there are countless dark bodies near the  sun--such as we shall never see. Among ourselves, this is an allegory;  and the psychologist of morals reads the whole star-writing merely as an  allegorical and symbolic language in which much may be unexpressed.    197. The beast of prey and the man of prey (for instance, Caesar Borgia)  are fundamentally misunderstood, \"nature\" is misunderstood, so long as  one seeks a \"morbidness\" in the constitution of these healthiest of  all tropical monsters and growths, or even an innate \"hell\" in them--as  almost all moralists have done hitherto. Does it not seem that there is  a hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists? And  that the \"tropical man\" must be discredited at all costs, whether  as disease and deterioration of mankind, or as his own hell and  self-torture? And why? In favour of the \"temperate zones\"? In favour  of the temperate men? The \"moral\"? The mediocre?--This for the chapter:  \"Morals as Timidity.\"    198. All the systems of morals which address themselves with a view to  their \"happiness,\" as it is called--what else are they but suggestions  for behaviour adapted to the degree of DANGER from themselves in which  the individuals live; recipes for their passions, their good and bad  propensities, insofar as such have the Will to Power and would like  to play the master; small and great expediencies and elaborations,  permeated with the musty odour of old family medicines and old-wife  wisdom; all of them grotesque and absurd in their form--because  they address themselves to \"all,\" because they generalize where  generalization is not authorized; all of them speaking unconditionally,  and taking themselves unconditionally; all of them flavoured not merely  with one grain of salt, but rather endurable only, and sometimes even  seductive, when they are over-spiced and begin to smell dangerously,  especially of \"the other world.\" That is all of little value when  estimated intellectually, and is far from being \"science,\" much less  \"wisdom\"; but, repeated once more, and three times repeated, it is  expediency, expediency, expediency, mixed with stupidity, stupidity,  stupidity--whether it be the indifference and statuesque coldness  towards the heated folly of the emotions, which the Stoics advised and  fostered; or the no-more-laughing and no-more-weeping of Spinoza, the  destruction of the emotions by their analysis and vivisection, which he  recommended so naively; or the lowering of the emotions to an innocent  mean at which they may be satisfied, the Aristotelianism of morals;  or even morality as the enjoyment of the emotions in a voluntary  attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art, perhaps as  music, or as love of God, and of mankind for God's sake--for in religion  the passions are once more enfranchised, provided that...; or, finally,  even the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotions, as has  been taught by Hafis and Goethe, the bold letting-go of the reins, the  spiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional cases of  wise old codgers and drunkards, with whom it \"no longer has much  danger.\"--This also for the chapter: \"Morals as Timidity.\"    199. Inasmuch as in all ages, as long as mankind has existed, there have  also been human herds (family alliances, communities, tribes, peoples,  states, churches), and always a great number who obey in proportion  to the small number who command--in view, therefore, of the fact that  obedience has been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto,  one may reasonably suppose that, generally speaking, the need thereof is  now innate in every one, as a kind of FORMAL CONSCIENCE which gives  the command \"Thou shalt unconditionally do something, unconditionally  refrain from something\", in short, \"Thou shalt\". This need tries to  satisfy itself and to fill its form with a content, according to its  strength, impatience, and eagerness, it at once seizes as an omnivorous  appetite with little selection, and accepts whatever is shouted into  its ear by all sorts of commanders--parents, teachers, laws, class  prejudices, or public opinion. The extraordinary limitation of human  development, the hesitation, protractedness, frequent retrogression, and  turning thereof, is attributable to the fact that the herd-instinct of  obedience is transmitted best, and at the cost of the art of command. If  one imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent, commanders  and independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether, or they  will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience, and will have to impose  a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to  command just as if they also were only obeying. This condition of things  actually exists in Europe at present--I call it the moral hypocrisy of  the commanding class. They know no other way of protecting themselves  from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executors of older  and higher orders (of predecessors, of the constitution, of justice, of  the law, or of God himself), or they even justify themselves by maxims  from the current opinions of the herd, as \"first servants of their  people,\" or \"instruments of the public weal\".
