These butchers cut the  body up into small pieces, which are taken out on to a hill-top and  scattered about for the birds of the air or the wolves to devour. If by  any chance there is a delay in consuming these remains, this is looked  upon as a sign that the man has led an evil life during his lifetime.    On June 22 Wollaston rejoined us again. He had escorted Raeburn to  Lachen, and had there arranged for an assistant surgeon to come up and  take him back as far as Gangtok. Wollaston had then come on as fast as  possible to rejoin us. His kit did not arrive till the following day, as  he had ridden in direct from Shekar Dzong. The following day Bullock and  Mallory left us, making direct for Mount Everest, and intending to  reconnoitre the North and Northwestern slopes. Looked at from here it is  certainly a very wonderful mountain, as it seems to stand up all by  itself, but from this side it looks far too steep to be climbed. On June  25 Wheeler and Heron went off to Kyetrak, from which point Wheeler was  to begin his photographic survey. I had intended to start the following  day and join them, but the acid hypo that I had been using for fixing  had given off so many sulphur fumes that I had been quite \"gassed\" for  several days and had lost my voice in consequence. Unfortunately my  orderly and Wheeler's bearer, who were both Mahommedans, were taken ill  with enteric. Wheeler's bearer was in a very bad way, and a few days  after my departure he died, but my orderly, after a bad attack,  recovered, and when I returned three weeks later he was able to be up  and to walk about a little. As Wollaston was likely to be detained here  for some time owing to these cases of sickness, and as Morshead wanted  to get in some surveying all round Tingri, I thought it would be a good  opportunity to visit the different parties that we had sent out, and  also to get, if possible, some information about Kharta, which I  intended should be our second base. The coolies that we had still with  us at Tingri were kept busy by Wollaston, and daily they would bring in  rats, birds, lizards, beetles, or fish which they had collected for him.  The local people would not make any attempt to collect these animals, as  they said it was against their religion. On June 26 I started out to the  South and camped the first night at Sharto, a small village about 9  miles across the plain to the South of Tingri. On the way we passed  numbers of bees that seemed to be coming up out of the ground and  swarming. These were all of a very light brown colour. Sharto is only a  small village, but there are no other houses between it and Kyetrak, so  that it was necessary to stop there. As the wind always blows with great  strength here, the tents were pitched within some sheltering walls. In  every place that we went to now we managed to get some kind of green  food which was turned into spinach; a small kind of weed that grows in  the barley fields was generally thus used. At other times we tried  turnip leaves, or again, when we were higher and above the limits of  cultivation, the young shoots of the nettle which grows up to 17,000  feet, and is really very good. I had taken with me this time a Tibetan  whom we had picked up on the way. He was called Poo, and he turned out  to be an excellent cook who could make any of the Tibetan dishes. As he  was a sensible fellow, and very seldom drunk, I made a good deal of use  of him. He accompanied me in all my wanderings, and I could not have  found a more useful servant when travelling, as he never seemed to mind  the cold or the height and could always produce a fire of some kind,  even though he had forgotten to bring any matches. That evening at  Sharto there was a curious false sunset in the East with rays of light  in the deep purple of the sky. All the hills stood out with wonderful  sharpness, and the colours were very beautiful. Towards nightfall we saw  a number of kiang, which came quite close up to the camp and started  feeding on the barley fields in spite of the pillars of stones and the  strings which are put round the fields to keep both them and the hares  away from the crops. The next morning I started off early as I intended  to climb a hill 17,700 feet, on the way to Kyetrak. This hill, however,  proved further off than I anticipated, and we had some difficulty in  crossing a glacier stream, so that I did not get up to the top till 9  a.m., by which time the clouds had hidden a great part of the mountains  to the South of us. The view, nevertheless, was extraordinarily fine.  The top of Everest just showed above a great icy range to the East of  us, and South-east was that great group of mountains of which Cho-Uyo,  26,800 feet, is the highest. Immense granite precipices descended sheer  for several thousand feet until they reached great winding glaciers,  while from over the Khombu Pass long wisps of cloud came sailing round  these peaks and eventually hid them from our view. To the North the view  extended right up to the watershed of the Brahmaputra, 80 to 100 miles  distant. The different colours of the hills, the light and shade from  the clouds, all formed a charming picture. Once over 17,000 feet, I met  my old friend the dwarf blue poppy (_Meconopsis_) and many pretty white,  blue and yellow saxifrages that grew on the rocks. Descending from this  hill into the Kyetrak Valley, we passed a number of goa which were quite  tame, but unfortunately they were all females. We had two more big  glacial torrents to cross which later in the afternoon would probably  have been impassable as by that time they would have risen another 2  feet, due to the melting of the snow and the ice by the hot sun in the  morning; indeed, we only just managed to get across when we did. The  main Kyetrak stream comes from the great glacier that descends from  Cho-Uyo and the Khombu Pass. Opposite the village of Kyetrak it is  luckily divided into a number of small streams, so that it is usually  possible to get across it, though in the afternoons it is always  somewhat difficult.    This village lies at a height of 16,000 feet, at the foot of the Khombu  or Nangba Pass and the Pusi Pass. The former is a high glacier-covered  pass, about 19,000 feet, that leads into the Khombu Valley in Nepal. The  other, the Pusi Pass, is a much lower and easier pass that leads into  the Rongshar Valley. Between these two passes lies a very beautiful  glacier-covered peak called Chorabsang. Here at Kyetrak I met Heron and  Wheeler encamped in the shelter of some walls close to the village,  which consisted of a few dirty stone houses and a big Chorten. The  people told me that they lived here all the year round, and that they  owned the grazing for many miles to the North and possessed herds of  yaks several thousand in number. Traffic could be kept up over these  passes, they said, at all times of the year, though only with great  difficulty, and with much danger, whole convoys being sometimes wiped  out by blizzards when trying to cross the Khombu Pass, as the fine  powdery snow is blown down into their faces from every direction and  they finally get suffocated by it. That night there was a sharp frost,  and the following morning Heron and I started to go up towards the  Khombu Pass, following at first the East side of the Kyetrak Glacier.  For about 6 or 7 miles we rode beside the great moraine that extended  along the East side of this glacier; every now and then we climbed up on  to a mound on the edge of the glacier in order to take photographs of  it. The ice was all torn and riven into wonderful shapes and opposite  us was the finely crevassed peak of Chorabsang. I pushed on, leaving  Heron to come on at a slower pace, as I was anxious to get to the top of  the pass before the clouds should have come up and hidden all the views.  Every day it cost us a race to get up to a point of vantage before the  clouds should have come up and hidden everything. Leaving the pony  behind, with one coolie, I pressed forward for some 4 miles up a very  stony and slippery moraine on the glacier. Here were many curious ice  formations--ice tables with a big flat rock superimposed, curious  upright pillars of ice, and the main glacier itself was worn by stone  and water into the weirdest shapes and forms. In places, too, we came  across that curious formation which in South America is called Nieve  Penitentes. As we passed onwards, new glaciers opened up in every  valley. The views up some of these side valleys, which often widened out  into great amphitheatres, were very grand, especially that of the huge  glacier that swept down from below the rock walls of Cho-Uyo.    On arriving at the end of the moraine, the boots that my coolie was  wearing came to pieces and he said he could go no further across the  snow, so shouldering the big camera, I started off alone. At first the  ice was firm, but soon I came to soft snow and much water underneath it:  they made the going very unpleasant and I kept floundering about up to  my knees in snow and water. At length I came to a large crevasse along  the edge of which I followed for over half a mile as most of the snow  bridges across it were unsafe. At last I found my way across and by  climbing on to some rocks was able to look over the top of the pass and  down into Nepal. The height of the pass seemed to be about 19,000 feet,  and as the day was very hot, I lay down and went sound asleep, only  waking up when it began to snow. I then started, none too soon, on my  homeward journey: all the way back snow fell heavily. I was very  thankful to meet my coolie again and to hand over the camera to him:  carrying a camera for five or six hours in soft snow at a height of  over 18,000 feet is a heavy tax upon the endurance of anyone"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39465"],[0,"Eleven Years in the Rocky Mountains and Life on the Frontier (#17)"],[1,"its original purity, and  became clouded with the smoke from many camp-fires. And all this change  might go as quickly as it came. The tent struck and the march resumed,  solitude reigned once more, and only the cloud dotted the silent  landscape.    If the day was busy and gleesome, the night had its charms as well.  Gathered about the shining fires, groups of men in fantastic costumes  told tales of marvelous adventures, or sung some old-remembered song, or  were absorbed in games of chance. Some of the better educated men, who  had once known and loved books, but whom some mishap in life had  banished to the wilderness, recalled their favorite authors, and recited  passages once treasured, now growing unfamiliar; or whispered to some  chosen confrere the saddened history of his earlier years, and charged  him thus and thus, should ever-ready death surprise himself in the next  spring's hunt.    It will not be thought discreditable to our young trapper, Joe, that he  learned to read by the light of the camp-fire. Becoming sensible, even  in the wilderness, of the deficiencies of his early education, he found  a teacher in a comrade, named Green, and soon acquired sufficient  knowledge to enjoy an old copy of Shakspeare; which, with a Bible, was  carried about with the property of the camp.    In this life of careless gayety and plenty, the whole company was  allowed to remain without interruption, until the first of April, when  it was divided, and once more started on the march. Jackson, or \"Davey,\"  as he was called by the men, with about half the company, left for the  Snake country. The remainder, among whom was Meek, started north, with  Smith for commander, and James Bridger as pilot.    Crossing the mountains, ranges of which divide the tributary streams of  the Yellowstone from each other, the first halt was made on Tongue  River. From thence the camp proceeded to the Bighorn River. Through all  this country game was in abundance,--buffalo, elk, and bear, and beaver  also plenty. In mountain phrase, \"times were good on this hunt:\" beaver  packs increased in number, and both men and animals were in excellent  condition.    A large party usually hunted out the beaver and frightened away the game  in a few weeks, or days, from any one locality. When this happened the  camp moved on; or, should not game be plenty, it kept constantly on the  move, the hunters and trappers seldom remaining out more than a day or  two. Should the country be considered dangerous on account of Indians,  it was the habit of the men to return every night to the encampment.    It was the design of Smith to take his command into the Blackfoot  country, a region abounding in the riches which he sought, could they  only be secured without coming into too frequent conflict with the  natives: always a doubtful question concerning these savages. He had  proceeded in this direction as far as Bovey's Fork of the Bighorn, when  the camp was overtaken by a heavy fall of snow, which made traveling  extremely difficult, and which, when melted, caused a sudden great rise  in the mountain streams. In attempting to cross Bovey's Fork during the  high water, he had thirty horses swept away, with three hundred traps: a  serious loss in the business of hunting beaver.    In the manner described, pushing on through an unknown country, hunting  and trapping as they moved, the company proceeded, passing another low  chain of mountains, through a pass called Pryor's Gap, to Clark's Fork  of the Yellowstone, thence to Rose-Bud River, and finally to the main  Yellowstone River, where it makes a great bend to the east, enclosing a  large plain covered with grass, and having also extensive cotton-wood  bottoms, which subsequently became a favorite wintering ground of the  fur companies.    It was while trapping up in this country, on the Rose-Bud River, that an  amusing adventure befel our trapper Joe. Being out with two other  trappers, at some distance from the great camp, they had killed and  supped off a fat buffalo cow. The night was snowy, and their camp was  made in a grove of young aspens. Having feasted themselves, the  remaining store of choice pieces was divided between, and placed, hunter  fashion, under the heads of the party, on their betaking themselves to  their blanket couches for the night. Neither Indian nor wild beast  disturbed their repose, as they slept, with their guns beside them,  filled with comfort and plenty. But who ever dreams of the presence of a  foe under such circumstances? Certainly not our young trapper, who was  only awakened about day-break by something very large and heavy walking  over him, and snuffing about him with a most insulting freedom. It did  not need Yankee powers of guessing to make out who the intruder in camp  might be: in truth, it was only too disagreeably certain that it was a  full sized grizzly bear, whose keenness of smell had revealed to him the  presence of fat cow-meat in that neighborhood.    \"You may be sure,\" says Joe, \"that I kept very quiet, while that bar  helped himself to some of my buffalo meat, and went a little way off to  eat it. But Mark Head, one of the men, raised up, and back came the  bar. Down went our heads under the blankets, and I kept mine covered  pretty snug, while the beast took another walk over the bed, but finally  went off again to a little distance. Mitchel then wanted to shoot; but I  said, 'no, no; hold on, or the brute will kill us, sure.' When the bar  heard our voices, back he run again, and jumped on the bed as before.  I'd have been happy to have felt myself sinking ten feet under ground,  while that bar promenaded over and around us! However, he couldn't quite  make out our style, and finally took fright, and ran off down the  mountain. Wanting to be revenged for his impudence, I went after him,  and seeing a good chance, shot him dead. Then I took my turn at running  over him awhile!\"    Such are the not infrequent incidents of the trapper's life, which  furnish him with material, needing little embellishment to convert it  into those wild tales with which the nights are whiled away around the  winter camp-fire.    Arrived at the Yellowstone with his company, Smith found it necessary,  on account of the high water, to construct Bull-boats for the crossing.  These are made by stitching together buffalo hides, stretching them over  light frames, and paying the seams with elk tallow and ashes. In these  light wherries the goods and people were ferried over, while the horses  and mules were crossed by swimming.    The mode usually adopted in crossing large rivers, was to spread the  lodges on the ground, throwing on them the light articles, saddles, etc.  A rope was then run through the pin-holes around the edge of each, when  it could be drawn up like a reticule. It was then filled with the  heavier camp goods, and being tightly drawn up, formed a perfect ball. A  rope being tied to it, it was launched on the water, the children of the  camp on top, and the women swimming after and clinging to it, while a  man, who had the rope in his hand, swam ahead holding on to his horse's  mane. In this way, dancing like a cork on the waves, the lodge was  piloted across; and passengers as well as freight consigned, undamaged,  to the opposite shore. A large camp of three hundred men, and one  hundred women and children were frequently thus crossed in one hour's  time.    The camp was now in the excellent but inhospitable country of the  Blackfeet, and the commander redoubled his precautions, moving on all  the while to the Mussel Shell, and thence to the Judith River. Beaver  were plenty and game abundant; but the vicinity of the large village of  the Blackfeet made trapping impracticable. Their war upon the trappers  was ceaseless; their thefts of traps and horses ever recurring: and  Smith, finding that to remain was to be involved in incessant warfare,  without hope of victory or gain, at length gave the command to turn  back, which was cheerfully obeyed: for the trappers had been very  successful on the spring hunt, and thinking discretion some part at  least of valor, were glad to get safe out of the Blackfoot country with  their rich harvest of beaver skins.    The return march was by the way of Pryor's Gap, and up the Bighorn, to  Wind River, where the cache was made in the previous December. The furs  were now taken out and pressed, ready for transportation across the  plains. A party was also dispatched, under Mr. Tullock, to raise the  cache on the Bighorn River. Among this party was Meek, and a Frenchman  named Ponto. While digging to come at the fur, the bank above caved in,  falling upon Meek and Ponto, killing the latter almost instantly. Meek,  though severely hurt, was taken out alive: while poor Ponto was \"rolled  in a blanket, and pitched into the river.\" So rude were the burial  services of the trapper of the Rocky Mountains.    Meek was packed back to camp, along with the furs, where he soon  recovered. Sublette arrived from St. Louis with fourteen wagons loaded  with merchandise, and two hundred additional men for the service.  Jackson also arrived from the Snake country with plenty of beaver, and  the business of the yearly rendezvous began. Then the scenes previously  described were re-enacted. Beaver, the currency of the mountains, was  plenty that year, and goods were high accordingly. A thousand dollars a  day was not too much for some of the most reckless to spend on their  squaws, horses, alcohol, and themselves. For \"alcohol\" was the beverage  of the mountaineers. Liquors could not be furnished to the men in that  country. Pure alcohol was what they \"got tight on;\" and a desperate  tight it was, to be sure!    An important change took place in the affairs of the Rocky Mountain  Company at this rendezvous. The three partners, Smith, Sublette, and  Jackson, sold out to a new firm, consisting of Milton Sublette, James  Bridger,"]]]
