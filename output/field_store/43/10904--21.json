Siliceous monaxon sponges in which the horny skeleton is much reduced or  absent and the spicular skeleton is more or less definitely reticulate.  The microscleres are usually rod-like and rarely have more than one main  axis.      Family SPONGILLIDAE.    SPONGILLADAE, J. E. Gray, P. Zool. Soc. London, 1867, p. 550.    Freshwater Halichondrina which at certain seasons produce gemmules armed  with peculiar microscleres. Two distinct kinds of microsclere are often  present, that associated with the gemmule sometimes consisting of a  vertical shaft at the ends of which transverse disks or rotulae are  borne. There is always at least a trace of a subdermal cavity.    Many authors divide the Spongillidae into two subfamilies:--Spongillinae  (or Euspongillinae), in which the gemmule-spicules have no transverse  rotulae, and Meyeninae (or Ephydatiinae), in which they have rotules at one  or both ends. So gradual, however, is the transition that I find it  difficult to decide in one instance to which of two genera, typical  respectively of the two \"subfamilies,\" a species should be assigned.  Minchin in his account of the Porifera in Lankester's \"Treatise on  Zoology\" (1900) regards the Spongillidae merely as a subfamily of the  Heterorrhaphidae, and there certainly are few differences of a definite  nature between them and the marine family (or subfamily) Remeridae.        _Key to the Indian Genera of_ Spongillidae.

C. Microscleres as in _Ephydatia_ except            that the rotulae of the gemmule-spicules            have smooth edges                      TROCHOSPONGILLA, p. 113.         D. Microscleres of the gemmule without a            trace of rotules, those of the parenchyma            birotulate                        CORVOSPONGILLA, nov., p. 122.      III. Microscleres of the gemmule with a well-developed         basal rotule and a vertical shaft         ending above in a mere knob.                      TUBELLA, p. 120.    The most distinct genus of Spongillidae not yet found in India is  _Heteromeyenia_, Potts. It is easily distinguished from all others by  the fact that the birotulate spicules of the gemmule are of two quite  distinct kinds, which occur together on every mature gemmule.  _Heteromeyenia_ is represented by several American species, one of which  has been found in Europe. _Acalle_, J. E. Gray, which is represented by  a single South American species (_Spongilla recurvata_, Bowerbank), is  related to _Heteromeyenia_ but has one kind of gemmule-spicule  tubelliform, the other birotulate. Probably _Uraguaya_, Carter, should  be regarded as a subgenus of _Trochospongilla_ with an unusually solid  skeleton; it is peculiar to S. America. _Parmula_, Carter (=_Drulia_,  Gray) includes South American forms allied to _Tubella_, but with the  shaft of the gemmule-spicule degenerate and consisting of a mere  projection in the centre of a shield-like body, which represents the  lower rotule. The status of _Potamolepis_, Marshall, originally  described from the Lake of Galilee, is very doubtful; possibly some or  all of its species belong to the subgenus of _Spongilla_ here called  _Stratospongilla_ (p. 100); but they are stated never to produce  gemmules. The same is the case as regards _Pachydictyum_, Weltner, which  consists of a single species from Celebes.    The sponges from Lake Baikal assigned by Weltner (Arch. Naturg. lxi (i)  p. 131) to the subfamily Lubomirskinae are of doubtful position and need  not be considered here; while _Lessepsia_, Keller, from one of the salt  lakes on the Suez Canal, certainly does not belong to the family,  although it is assigned to it by von Lendenfeld (Mon. Horny Sponges, p.  904 (1889)) and subsequently by Minchin (Porifera, p. 152, in  Lankester's Treatise on Zoology, part ii (1900)).      Genus 1.

She has them beyond  doubt, and now she is sitting anticipating the pleasure of crushing  me--enjoying the retrospect of my frustrated endeavors--thinking how she  and Marlow will laugh together over a whole list of attempts that have  failed, and purposes that I have not been able to execute. Yes, yes, they  will laugh loud and gaily, and at the very altar, perhaps, will think with  triumph that they are filling for me the last drop of scorn and  disappointment. Never, never, never! It shall never be. That is the only  way, methinks;\" and she fell into dark and silent thought again.    The fit lasted some time, and then she spoke again, muttering the words  between her teeth as she had previously done. \"They will never marry with a  mother's curse upon their union! Oh, no, no, I know her too well. She will  not do that. That weak poppet may die before she recalls her  opposition--must die--and then they will live on loving and wretched. But  it must be made as bitter as possible. It must not stop there.\"    Again she paused and thought, and then said to herself, \"That drug which  the Italian monk sold me would do well enough if I did but fully know its  effects. There are things which leave terrible signs behind them--besides  it is old, and may have lost its virtue. I must run no risk of that--and it  must be speedy as well as sure. I have but four and twenty hours--the time  is very short;\" and relapsing into silence again, she continued in deep and  silent meditation till the carriage stopped at her own gates.    Mrs. Hazleton sat in the library that night for two or three hours, and  studied diligently a large folio volume which she had taken down herself.  She read, and she seemed puzzled. A servant entered to ask some unimportant  question, and she waved him away impatiently. Then leaning her head upon  her hand she thought profoundly. She calculated in her own mind what Emily  knew--how much--how intimately, and how she had learned it. Such a thing as  remorse she know not; but she had some fear, though very little--a sort of  shrinking from the commission of acts more daring and terrible than any she  had yet performed. There was something appalling--there is always something  appalling--in the commission of a great new crime, and the turning back, as  it were, of the mind of Mrs. Hazleton from the search for means to  accomplish a deed determined, in order to calculate the necessity of that  deed, proceeded from this sort of awe at the next highest step of evil to  those which she had already committed.    \"She must know all,\" said Mrs. Hazleton to herself, after having considered  the matter for some moments deeply. \"And she must have learned it  accurately. I know her caution well. From whom can she have learned it?\"    \"From that young villain Ayliffe,\" was the prompt reply. \"I was too harsh  with him, and in his fit of rage he has gone away at once to tell this  girl--or perhaps that old fool Dixwell. Most likely he has furnished her  with evidence too, before he fled the country. Without that I could have  set Marlow's discoveries at naught. Yet I doubt his having gone to Dixwell;  he always despised him. Mean as he was himself, he looked upon him as a  meaner. He would not go to him to whine and cant over him. He would go to  the girl herself. Her he always loved, even in the midst of his violence  and his rage. He would go to her or write to her beyond all doubt. She must  be silenced. But I must deal with another first. Come what will, this  marriage shall not take place. Besides, she is the most dangerous of the  two. The girl might be frightened or awed into secresy, and it will take  longer time to reach her, but nothing will keep that weak woman's tongue  from babbling, and in four and twenty hours her consent will be given to  this marriage. If I can but contrive it rightly, that at least may be  stopped, and a part of my revenge obtained at all events. It must be so--it  must be so.\"    She turned to the leaves of the book again, but nothing in the contents  seemed to give her satisfaction. \"That will be too long,\" she said, after  having read about a third of a page. \"Three or four days to operate! Who  could wait three or four days when the object is security, tranquility, or  revenge? Besides the case admits of no delay. Before three or four days all  will be over.\"    She read again, and was discontented with what she read. \"That will leave  traces,\" she said. \"It must be the Italian's dose, I believe, after all.  Those monks are very skilful men, and perhaps it may not have lost its  efficiency. It is easily tried,\" she exclaimed suddenly, and ascending  quietly to her own dressing-room, she sought out from the drawer of an old  cabinet a small packet of white powder, which she concealed in the palm of  her hand. Then descending to the library again, she sat for a few minutes  in dull, heavy thought, and then rang a hand-bell which stood upon her  table.    \"Bring me a small quantity of meat cut fine for the dog,\" she said, as soon  as her servant appeared. \"He seems ill; what has been the matter with him?\"    \"Nothing, madam,\" said the man, looking under the table where lay a  beautiful small spaniel sound asleep. \"He has been quite well all day.\"    \"He has had something like a fit,\" said Mrs. Hazleton.    \"Dear me, perhaps he is going mad,\" replied the man. \"Had I not better kill  him?\"    \"Kill him!\" exclaimed Mrs. Hazleton; \"on no account whatever. Bring me a  small plate of meat.\"    The man did as he was ordered, and on his return found the dog sitting at  his mistress's feet, looking up in her face.    \"Ah, Dorset,\" she said, speaking to the animal in a kindly tone, \"you are  better now, are you?\"    The man seemed inclined to linger to see whether the dog would eat: but  Mrs. Hazleton took the plate from him, and threw the poor beast a small  piece, which he devoured eagerly.    \"There that will do,\" said Mrs. Hazleton. \"You may leave the room.\"    When she was alone again, she paused for a moment or two, then deliberately  unfolded the packet, and put a very small quantity of the powder it  contained upon a piece of the meat. This morsel she threw to the poor  animal, who swallowed it at once, and then she set down the plate upon the  ground, which he cleared in a moment. After that Mrs. Hazleton turned to  her reading again, and looked round once at the end of about two minutes.  The dog had resumed his sleeping attitude, and she read on. Hardly a minute  more had passed ere the poor brute started up, ran round once or twice, as  if seized with violent convulsions, staggered for an instant to and fro,  and fell over on its side. Mrs. Hazleton rang the bell violently, and two  servants ran in at once. \"He is dying,\" she cried; \"he is dying.\"    \"Keep out of his way, madam,\" exclaimed one of the men, evidently in great  fear himself, \"there is no knowing what he may do.\"    The next instant the poor dog started once more upon his feet, uttered a  loud and terrific yell, and fell dead upon the floor.    \"Poor thing,\" said Mrs. Hazleton, \"Poor Dorset! He is dead; take him away.\"    The two men seemed unwilling to touch him, but when quite satisfied that  there was no more life left in him, they carried him away, and Mrs.  Hazleton remained alone.    \"Speedy enough,\" said the lady, replacing the large volume on the shelf.  \"We need no distillations and compoundings. This is as efficacious as ever.  Now let me see. I must try and remember the size of the bottle, and the  color of the stuff that was in it.\" She thought of these matters for some  minutes, and then retired to rest.    Did she sleep well or ill that night? God knows. But if she slept well, the  friends of hell must sometimes have repose.    The next morning very early, Mrs. Hazleton walked out. As the reader knows,  she lived at no great distance from the little town, even by the high-road,  and that was shortened considerably by a path through the park. There was  a poor man in the place, an apothecary, who had came down there in the hope  of carrying away some of the practice of good Mr. Short. He had not been  very successful, and his stock of medicines was not very great: but he had  all that Mrs. Hazleton wanted. Her demands indeed were simple  enough--merely a little logwood, a little saffron, and a little madder.  Having obtained these she asked to see some vials, and selected one  containing somewhat less than half a pint.    The good man packed all these up with zealous care, saying that he would  send them up to the house in a few minutes. Mrs. Hazleton, however, said  she would carry them herself; but the very idea of the great lady carrying  home a parcel, even through her own park, shocked the little apothecary  extremely, and he pressed hard to be permitted to send his own boy, till  Mrs. Hazleton replied in a rather peremptory tone, \"I always say what I  mean, sir. Be so good as to give me the parcel.\"    When she reached her own house, she ordered her carriage to be at the door  at half past twelve in order to convey her to the dwelling of Sir Philip  Hastings. Upon a very nice calculation the drive, commenced at that hour,  would bring her to the place of her destination shortly after that precise  period of the day when Lady Hastings was accustomed to take an hour's  sleep. But Mrs. Hazleton had laid out her plan, and did not thus act by  accident.    Almost every lady in those days acted the part of a Lady Bountiful in her  neighborhood, and gave, not alone assistance in food and money to the  cottagers and poor people about her, but medicine and sometimes medical  advice. Both the latter were very simple indeed; but the preparation of  these simple medicines entailed the necessity of what was called a  still-room in each great house. In fact to be a Lady Bountiful, and to have  a still-room, were two of the conventionalities of the day, from which no  lady, having more than a very"]]]
