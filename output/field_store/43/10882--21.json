[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34853"],[0,"The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries (#17)"],[1," My next friend to testify is Pat Ruddy, eighty years old, one of the  most intelligent and prosperous farmers living beside Ben Bulbin. He  greeted me in the true Irish way, but before we could come to talk about  fairies his good wife induced me to enter another room where she had  secretly prepared a great feast spread out on a fresh white cloth, while  Pat and myself had been exchanging opinions about America and Ireland.  When I returned to the kitchen the whole family were assembled round the  blazing turf fire, and Pat was soon talking about the 'gentry':--    _Seeing the 'Gentry' Army._--'Old people used to say the _gentry_ were  in the mountains; that is certain, but I never could be quite sure of it  myself. One night, however, near midnight, I did have a sight: I set out  from Bantrillick to come home, and near Ben Bulbin there was the  greatest army you ever saw, five or six thousand of them in armour  shining in the moonlight. A strange man rose out of the hedge and  stopped me, for a minute, in the middle of the road. He looked into my  face, and then let me go.'    _An Ossianic Fragment._--'A man went away with the _good people_ (or  _gentry_), and returned to find the townland all in ruins. As he came  back riding on a horse of the _good people_, he saw some men in a quarry  trying to move a big stone. He helped them with it, but his saddle-girth  broke, and he fell to the ground. The horse ran away, and he was left  there, an old man'[19] (cf. pp. 346-7).      A SCHOOLMASTER'S TESTIMONY    A schoolmaster, who is a native of the Ben Bulbin country, offers this  testimony:--'There is implicit belief here in the _gentry_, especially  among the old people. They consider them the spirits of their departed  relations and friends, who visit them in joy and in sorrow. On the death  of a member of a family, they believe the spirits of their near  relatives are present; they do not see them, but feel their presence.  They even have a strong belief that the spirits show them the future in  dreams; and say that cases of affliction are always foreshown in a  dream.    'The belief in changelings is not now generally prevalent; but in olden  times a mother used to place a pair of iron tongs over the cradle before  leaving the child alone, in order that the fairies should not change the  child for a weakly one of their own. It was another custom to take a  wisp of straw, and, lighting one end of it, make a fiery sign of the  cross over a cradle before a babe could be placed in it.'      WITH THE IRISH MYSTICS IN THE _SIDHE_ WORLD    Let us now turn to the Rosses Point country, which, as we have already  said, is one of the very famous places for seeing the 'gentry', or, as  educated Irish seers who make pilgrimages thither call them, the  _Sidhe_. I have been told by more than one such seer that there on the  hills and Greenlands (a great stretch of open country, treeless and  grass-grown), and on the strand at Lower Rosses Point--called Wren Point  by the country-folk--these beings can be seen and their wonderful music  heard; and a well-known Irish artist has shown me many drawings, and  paintings in oil, of these _Sidhe_ people as he has often beheld them at  those places and elsewhere in Ireland. They are described as a race of  majestic appearance and marvellous beauty, in form human, yet in nature  divine. The highest order of them seems to be a race of beings evolved  to a superhuman plane of existence, such as the ancients called gods;  and with this opinion, strange as it may seem in this age, all the  educated Irish seers with whom I have been privileged to talk agree,  though they go further, and say that these highest _Sidhe_ races still  inhabiting Ireland are the ever-young, immortal divine race known to the  ancient men of Erin as the Tuatha De Danann.    Of all European lands I venture to say that Ireland is the most  mystical, and, in the eyes of true Irishmen, as much the Magic Island of  Gods and Initiates now as it was when the Sacred Fires flashed from its  purple, heather-covered mountain-tops and mysterious round towers, and  the Greater Mysteries drew to its hallowed shrines neophytes from the  West as well as from the East, from India and Egypt as well as from  Atlantis;[20] and Erin's mystic-seeing sons still watch and wait for the  relighting of the Fires and the restoration of the old Druidic  Mysteries. Herein I but imperfectly echo the mystic message Ireland's  seers gave me, a pilgrim to their Sacred Isle. And until this mystic  message is interpreted, men cannot discover the secret of Gaelic myth  and song in olden or in modern times, they cannot drink at the  ever-flowing fountain of Gaelic genius, the perennial source of  inspiration which lies behind the new revival of literature and art in  Ireland, nor understand the seeming reality of the fairy races.      AN IRISH MYSTIC'S TESTIMONY    Through the kindness of an Irish mystic, who is a seer, I am enabled to  present here, in the form of a dialogue, very rare and very important  evidence, which will serve to illustrate and to confirm what has just  been said above about the mysticism of Ireland. To anthropologists this  evidence may be of more than ordinary value when they know that it  comes from one who is not only a cultured seer but who is also a man  conspicuously successful in the practical life of a great city:--    _Visions._--    Q.--Are all visions which you have had of the same character?    A.--'I have always made a distinction between pictures seen in the  memory of nature and visions of actual beings now existing in the inner  world. We can make the same distinction in our world: I may close my  eyes and see you as a vivid picture in memory, or I may look at you with  my physical eyes and see your actual image. In seeing these beings of  which I speak, the physical eyes may be open or closed: mystical beings  in their own world and nature are never seen with the physical eyes.'    _Otherworlds._--    Q.--By the inner world do you mean the Celtic Otherworld?    A.--'Yes; though there are many Otherworlds. The _Tir-na-nog_ of the  ancient Irish, in which the races of the _Sidhe_ exist, may be described  as a radiant archetype of this world, though this definition does not at  all express its psychic nature. In _Tir-na-nog_ one sees nothing save  harmony and beautiful forms. There are other worlds in which we can see  horrible shapes.'    _Classification of the 'Sidhe'._--    Q.--Do you in any way classify the _Sidhe_ races to which you refer?    A.--'The beings whom I call the _Sidhe_, I divide, as I have seen them,  into two great classes: those which are shining, and those which are  opalescent and seem lit up by a light within themselves. The shining  beings appear to be lower in the hierarchies; the opalescent beings are  more rarely seen, and appear to hold the positions of great chiefs or  princes among the tribes of Dana.'    _Conditions of Seership._--    Q.--Under what state or condition and where have you seen such beings?    A.--'I have seen them most frequently after being away from a city or  town for a few days. The whole west coast of Ireland from Donegal to  Kerry seems charged with a magical power, and I find it easiest to see  while I am there. I have always found it comparatively easy to see  visions while at ancient monuments like New Grange and Dowth, because I  think such places are naturally charged with psychical forces, and were  for that reason made use of long ago as sacred places. I usually find it  possible to throw myself into the mood of seeing; but sometimes visions  have forced themselves upon me.'    _The Shining Beings._--    Q.--Can you describe the shining beings?    A.--'It is very difficult to give any intelligible description of them.  The first time I saw them with great vividness I was lying on a  hill-side alone in the west of Ireland, in County Sligo: I had been  listening to music in the air, and to what seemed to be the sound of  bells, and was trying to understand these aerial clashings in which wind  seemed to break upon wind in an ever-changing musical silvery sound.  Then the space before me grew luminous, and I began to see one beautiful  being after another.'    _The Opalescent Beings._--    Q.--Can you describe one of the opalescent beings?    A.--'The first of these I saw I remember very clearly, and the manner of  its appearance: there was at first a dazzle of light, and then I saw  that this came from the heart of a tall figure with a body apparently  shaped out of half-transparent or opalescent air, and throughout the  body ran a radiant, electrical fire, to which the heart seemed the  centre. Around the head of this being and through its waving luminous  hair, which was blown all about the body like living strands of gold,  there appeared flaming wing-like auras. From the being itself light  seemed to stream outwards in every direction; and the effect left on me  after the vision was one of extraordinary lightness, joyousness, or  ecstasy.    'At about this same period of my life I saw many of these great beings,  and I then thought that I had visions of Aengus, Manannan, Lug, and  other famous kings or princes among the Tuatha De Danann; but since then  I have seen so many beings of a similar character that I now no longer  would attribute to any one of them personal identity with particular  beings of legend; though I believe that they correspond in a general way  to the Tuatha De Danann or ancient Irish gods.'    _Stature of the 'Sidhe'._--    Q.--You speak of the opalescent beings as great beings; what stature do  you assign to them, and to the shining beings?    A.--'The opalescent beings seem to be about fourteen feet in stature,  though I do not know why I attribute to them such definite height, since  I had nothing to compare them with; but I have always considered them as  much taller than our race. The shining beings seem to be about our own  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34856"],[0,"My Own Story (#17)"],[1,"child to the world. A child born in a cell! I shall never forget that  night, nor what I suffered with the birth-pangs of that woman, who, I  found later, was simply waiting trial on a charge which was found to be  baseless.    The days passed very slowly, the nights more slowly still. Being in  hospital, I was deprived of chapel, and also of work. Desperate, at last  I begged the wardress for some sewing, and she kindly gave me a skirt of  her own to hem, and later some coarse knitting to do. Prisoners were  allowed a few books, mostly of the \"Sunday-school\" kind. One day I  asked the chaplain if there were not some French or German books in the  library, and he brought me a treasure, \"_Autour de mon Jardin_,\" by  Jules Janin. For a few days I was quite happy, reading my book and  translating it on the absurd little slate they gave us in lieu of paper  and pencil. That slate was, after all, a great comfort. I did all kinds  of things with it. I kept a calendar, I wrote all the French poetry I  could remember on it, I even recorded old school chorals and old English  exercises. It helped wonderfully to pass the endless hours until my  release. I even forgot the cold, which was the harder to bear because of  the fur coat, which I knew was put away, ticketed with my name. I begged  them for the coat, but they wouldn't let me have it.    At last the time came when they gave me back all my things, and let me  go free. At the door the Governor spoke to me, and asked me if I had any  complaints to make. \"Not of you,\" I replied, \"nor of any of the  wardresses. Only of this prison, and all of men's prisons. We shall raze  them to the ground.\"    Back in my comfortable home, surrounded by loving friends, I would have  rested quietly for a few days, but there was a great meeting that night  at Albert Hall, to mark the close of a week of self-denial to raise  money for the year's campaign. Women had sold papers, flowers, toys,  swept crossings, and sung in the streets for the cause. Many women, well  known in the world of art and letters, did these things. I felt that I  should be doing little if I merely attended the meeting. So I went. My  release was not expected until the following morning, and no one thought  of my appearing at the meeting. My chairman's seat was decorated with a  large placard with the inscription, \"Mrs. Pankhurst's Chair.\" After all  the others were seated, the speakers, and hundreds of ex-prisoners. I  walked quietly onto the stage, took the placard out of the chair and sat  down. A great cry went up from the women as they sprang from their seats  and stretched their hands toward me. It was some time before I could see  them for my tears, or speak to them for the emotion that shook me like a  storm.    The next morning I, with the other released prisoners, drove off to  Peckham, a constituency of London, where the W. S. P. U. members were  fighting a vigorous by-election. In open brakes we paraded the streets,  dressed in our prison clothes, or exact reproductions of them.  Naturally, we attracted a great deal of attention and sympathy, and our  daily meetings on Peckham Rye, as their common is known, drew enormous  crowds. When polling day came our members were stationed at every  polling booth, and many men as they came to the booths told us that they  were, for the first time, voting \"for the women,\" by which they meant  against the Government. That night, amid great excitement, it was made  known that the Liberal majority of 2,339 at the last general election  had been turned into a Conservative majority of 2,494. Letters poured  into the newspapers, declaring that the loss of this important Liberal  seat was due almost entirely to the work of the Suffragettes, and many  prominent Liberals called upon party leaders to start doing something  for women before the next general election. The Liberal leaders, with  the usual perspicacity of politicians, responded not at all. Instead  they beheld with approval the rise to highest power the arch-enemy of  the suffragists, Mr. Asquith.    Mr. Asquith became prime minister about Easter time, 1908, on the  resignation, on account of ill health, of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.  Mr. Asquith was chosen, not because of any remarkable record of  statesmanship, nor yet because of great personal popularity--for he  possessed neither--but simply because no better man seemed available  just then. He was known as a clever, astute, and somewhat unscrupulous  lawyer. He had filled several high offices to the satisfaction of his  party, and under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman had been Chancellor of the  Exchequer, a post which is generally regarded as a stepping-stone to the  Premiership. The best thing the Liberal press found to say of the new  Premier was that he was a \"strong\" man. Generally in politics this term  is used to describe an obstinate man, and this we already knew Mr.  Asquith to be. He was a bluntly outspoken opponent of woman suffrage,  and it was sufficiently plain to us that no methods of education or  persuasion would ever prove successful where he was concerned. Therefore  the necessity of action on our part was greater than ever.    Such an opportunity presented itself at once through changes that took  place in the new Cabinet. According to English law, all new comers into  the Cabinet are obliged to resign their seats in Parliament and offer  themselves to their constituencies for re-election. Besides these  vacancies there were several others, on account of death or elevations  to the peerage. This made necessary a number of by-elections, and the  Women's Social and Political Union once more went into the field against  the Liberal candidates. I shall deal no further with these by-elections  than is necessary to show the effect of our work on the Government, and  its subsequent effect on our movement--which was to force us into more  and more militancy. I shall leave it to the honest judgment of my  readers to place where it ought rightly to be placed the responsibility  for those first broken windows.    We selected as our first candidate for defeat Mr. Winston Churchill, who  was about to appeal to his constituency of North West Manchester to  sanction his appointment as president of the Board of Trade. My daughter  Christabel took charge of this election, and the work of herself and her  forces was so successful that Mr. Churchill lost his seat by 420 votes.  All the newspapers acknowledged that it was the Suffragettes who had  defeated Mr. Churchill, and one Liberal newspaper, the London _Daily  News_, called upon the party to put a stop to an intolerable state of  affairs by granting the women's demand for votes.    Another seat was immediately secured for Mr. Churchill, that of Dundee,  then strongly--in the merely party sense--Liberal, and therefore safe.  Nevertheless, we determined to fight Mr. Churchill there, to defeat him  if possible, and to bring down the Liberal majority in any case. I took  personal charge of the campaign, holding a very large meeting in  Kinnaird Hall on the evening before Mr. Churchill's arrival. Although he  felt absolutely sure of election in this Scottish constituency, Mr.  Churchill dreaded the effect of our presence on the Liberal women. The  second meeting he addressed in Dundee was held for women only, and  instead of asking for support of the various measures actually on the  government's programme, the politician's usual method, he talked about  the certainty of securing, within a short time, the Parliamentary  franchise for women. \"No one,\" he declared, \"can be blind to the fact  that at the next general election woman suffrage will be a real,  practical issue; and the next Parliament, I think, ought to see the  gratification of the women's claims. I do not exclude the possibility of  the suffrage being dealt with in this Parliament.\" Mr. Churchill  earnestly reiterated his claim to be considered a true friend of the  women's cause; but when pressed for a pledge that his Government would  take action, he urged his inability to speak for his colleagues.    This specious promise, or rather, prophecy of woman suffrage at some  indefinite time, won over a great many of the Liberal women, who  forthwith went staunchly to work for Mr. Churchill's election. Dundee  has a large population of extremely poor people, workers in the jute  mills and the marmalade factories. Some concessions in the matter of the  sugar tax, timely made, and the announcement that the new Government  meant to establish old age pensions, created an immense wave of Liberal  enthusiasm that swept Mr. Churchill into office in spite of our work,  which was untiring. We held something like two hundred meetings, and on  election eve, five huge demonstrations--four of them in the open air and  one which filled a large drill hall. Polling day, May 9th, was very  exciting. For every Suffragette at the polling-booths there were half a  dozen Liberal men and women, handing out bills with such legends as  \"Vote for Churchill, and never mind the women,\" and \"Put Churchill in  and keep the women out.\" Yet for all their efforts, Mr. Churchill polled  2200 votes less than his Liberal predecessor had polled at the general  election.    In the first seven by-elections following Mr. Asquith's elevation to the  premiership, we succeeded in pulling down the Liberal vote by 6663. Then  something happened to check our progress. Mr. Asquith received a  deputation of Liberal members of Parliament, who urged him to allow the  Stanger suffrage bill, which had passed its second reading by a large  majority, to be carried into law. Mr. Asquith replied that he himself  did not wish to see women enfranchised, and that it would not be  possible for the Government to give the required facilities to Mr.  Stanger's bill. He added that he was fully alive to the many defects of  the electoral system, and that the Government intended, \"barring  accidents,\" to"]]]
