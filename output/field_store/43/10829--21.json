There is a most able, most painstaking, and most instructive work upon  this subject, \"Pronunciation for Singers,\" by Alexander Ellis, Esq.,  F.R.S., &c., published by J. Curwen and Sons, to which I would call the  attention of all who desire to make the best use of their voices. To be  really understood this book requires that the student should  conscientiously carry out all the experiments Mr. Ellis suggests. But  any one doing so will, I venture to assert, rise from the study of this  subject with a deeper conviction of the immense importance of the  \"resonator,\" and with a clearer perception of the best way of managing  it than he ever had before. I obtain better and quicker results with my  pupils since I have learnt the lessons Mr. Ellis teaches, and I have no  doubt my fellow teachers will derive similar benefit from their study.    One of the few points upon which \"doctors\" do not differ is that the  tone, in order to be pure, resonant, and far-reaching, must be allowed  to come well to the front of the mouth. It should, as the phrase goes,  be directed against the hard palate just above the front teeth. But this  is an unfortunate way of putting it, as the tone fills the whole cavity  of the mouth, and cannot be \"directed\" like a jet of water upon any  given point. Nevertheless the idea sought to be conveyed by the  injunction is good, for it is certainly essential to good quality that  the tone should be brought well forward in the mouth. This is frequently  prevented by several circumstances which we will now consider:--    The \"soft palate\" may be in the way. This is the movable partition  shaped like an arch with the little pendant called the \"uvula\" hanging  down in the centre. It acts like a curtain. If we lower it, it hangs  upon the back of the tongue, shutting off the mouth from the throat,  thereby compelling the tone to pass through the nostrils, and thus  giving it a nasal quality. This nasal quality increases the more the  passages through which the tone has to travel are impeded; but the first  and indispensable condition for its existence is the lowering of the  soft palate. Raise this, and you may completely shut the nostrils and  yet produce a pure vocal tone. The reason is that, with the soft palate  _up_, the nose is shut off from the throat, thereby compelling the tone  to pass through the mouth.    But more, the soft palate is never still for a moment while we are  singing or speaking, as it assumes a different degree of tension for  every vowel and also for every pitch of the voice. We see, therefore,  that this curtain has great influence upon the management of the voice,  and we should do all we can to get it under our control. In order to  accomplish this, arrange a mirror so that you get the light reflected  upon the back of your throat without bending the head, stretching the  neck, or otherwise assuming an awkward position. I recommend reflected  instead of direct light, because with the latter it is almost impossible  to get a perfect sight of the soft palate without making any  contortions, and these, however slight, are fatal to success. The  management of the light will, no doubt, offer a little difficulty to  those not practised in these matters, but once made it is easily  rearranged, and the gain is great.    The mirror mentioned above is to throw the light into your mouth; you  will require another one in which to see the image. Now try the  following: Open your mouth and breath through the nostrils; the soft  palate will immediately drop upon the tongue. Sing while it is in this  position, and you will produce nasal tone. Now breathe through the  mouth, and the soft palate will rise. Raise it higher still, by  attempting to yawn, till the uvula almost disappears. Sing again with  the soft palate in this position, and if nothing else interferes you  will produce pure vocal tone. If you sing up and down the scale you will  perceive that the soft palate to some extent rises and falls with the  pitch of your tones. You will also notice that the tension of it  increases as you approach the the limit of one register, and that it  diminishes as soon as you change into the next register above. All these  things, and a great many besides, you will notice if you observe  carefully, and by a little steady practice you will acquire easy control  over the movements of your soft palate, the beneficial results of which  will soon be manifested in the improved quality and the better  management of your voice.    This leads me to remark that the soft palate should, as a matter of  course, be in a perfectly healthy condition, or it cannot perform the  infinite variety of movements required from it. In many cases however,  it is in a very different state, the arch being congested, the uvula  elongated, and the tonsils greatly enlarged. People with a soft palate  like this are handicapped. They might as well try to run a race with a  heavy weight on their shoulders as to sing or speak with such  impediments in their throats. They should at once put themselves in the  hands of a properly qualified medical practitioner, who may probably  recommend clipping of the uvula or excision of the tonsils. Either  operation is a slight one, and in suitable cases nothing but good can  follow from it.    Another obstacle to the forward production of tone is often caused by  that great movable plug called the tongue. We have it on the highest  authority that the tongue is an \"unruly member.\" It is sometimes  difficult to keep it under proper control, and with some people it is  continually running away altogether. As under ordinary circumstances, so  in singing. Instead of peacefully assuming the position necessary for  the production of the various vowels, the tongue rises in rebellion; it  arches up, stiffens and defies all attempts to keep it in order. The  tone is consequently more or less impeded and shut in, with the result  of making it guttural or throaty. Here again singing before the mirror  as described above will enable the student to master his tongue and to  improve his voice to a wonderful extent. All voice trainers, as I have  said before, agree that tone should be allowed to come well forward, and  the best plan to bring about this desirable end is to sing _oo_, then to  allow _oo_ to dwindle into _o_, and finally to allow _o_ to dwindle into  _ah_.    In some cases these _oo-o-ah_ exercises are insufficient because the  throatiness of tone is partly brought about by a stiffening of the  throat in general. The _oo-o-ah_ must then be preceded by staccato  exercises upon the syllable _Koo_, which have the effect not only of  throwing the tone forward, but also of making the throat supple. Make  the experiment before a mirror and you will see the reason.    I should have pointed out in the course of this chapter that one of the  great secrets in the production of fine resonant and far-reaching tone  consists in using as little air as possible; and I conclude by advising  all those who want to be heard to open their mouths, a thing which,  curiously enough, many people in these islands seem to be determined not  to do.          _APPENDIX TO THE NINTH EDITION_          VOICE FAILURE.    A NEW CHAPTER, WRITTEN FOR THE NINTH EDITION, BY MRS. EMIL BEHNKE.      The large and ever increasing number of professional voice users of all  classes and of all grades who break down in voice is matter for serious  and earnest consideration. Innumerable students of singing of both  sexes, in England and abroad, suffer shipwreck of their hopes and  ambitions in the loss of their voices during the process of training,  long before the period arrives for professional and public voice use. In  some of these cases general delicacy of constitution has been the  principal factor in the failure; in others weakness of throat or lungs  may have been a cause. But after making ample allowance for such  physical contributories, we are still face to face with the fact that  voice failure, accompanied by throat ailments, more or less serious,  occurs with startling frequency, and no other reason is assigned for it  than the irresponsible, indefinite one that the voice broke down under  training. Of the infinitesimal number of successful students--that is to  say, of those who, having completed their studies, come before the  public as professional singers--so few escape the common lot that it  would almost appear as if a fatality attended the following of the  vocal art; yet from a health point of view, singing is an admirable  exercise, and abundant medical testimony has been adduced in proof of  this statement.    There are, of course, other causes of non-success in vocal students  besides break-down of voice. A fine voice and good musical knowledge are  but parts of the equipment of the singer; if he have not the soul of an  artist he will never rise above mediocrity. With musical and artistic  failures this chapter has nothing to do, but only with preventible  causes of break-down, such as have come under my personal observation  from close association with the work of my late husband, and also in my  own and my daughter's work since his lamented decease.    In the establishment of a rule or law founded upon general truths, a  number of examples bearing upon the subject under consideration are  relied on as conclusive evidence, and by their use we are enabled to  analyse reasons and deduce conclusions.    From the examination of a large number of cases of vocal failure in  singers and in speakers who have placed themselves under my tuition for  recovery of voice, I have found that among the most frequent and most  injurious mistakes are:--    1st. Wrong methods of breathing and of breath management.    2nd. Loud singing and shouting.    3rd.

It will be      nice to see your own name on a title-page, won't it, Aunt Janet?    _From Rupert Sent Leger_, _Vissarion_, _to Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom_.                                                           _January_ 30, 1907.        MY DEAR AUNT JANET,        I stopped writing last night--do you know why?  Because I wanted to      write more!  This sounds a paradox, but it is true.  The fact is      that, as I go on telling you of this delightful place, I keep finding      out new beauties myself.  Broadly speaking, it _is all_ beautiful.      In the long view or the little view--as the telescope or the      microscope directs--it is all the same.  Your eye can turn on nothing      that does not entrance you.  I was yesterday roaming about the upper      part of time Castle, and came across some delightful nooks, which at      once I became fond of, and already like them as if I had known them      all my life.  I felt at first a sense of greediness when I had      appropriated to myself several rooms in different places--I who have      never in my life had more than one room which I could call my      own--and that only for a time!  But when I slept on it the feeling      changed, and its aspect is now not half bad.  It is now under another      classification--under a much more important label--_proprietorship_.      If I were writing philosophy, I should here put in a cynical remark:        \"Selfishness is an appanage of poverty.  It might appear in the      stud-book as by 'Morals' out of 'Wants.'\"        I have now three bedrooms arranged as my own particular dens.  One of      the other two was also a choice of Uncle Roger's.  It is at the top      of one of the towers to the extreme east, and from it I can catch the      first ray of light over the mountains.  I slept in it last night, and      when I woke, as in my travelling I was accustomed to do, at dawn, I      saw from my bed through an open window--a small window, for it is in      a fortress tower--the whole great expanse to the east.  Not far off,      and springing from the summit of a great ruin, where long ago a seed      had fallen, rose a great silver-birch, and the half-transparent,      drooping branches and hanging clusters of leaf broke the outline of      the grey hills beyond, for the hills were, for a wonder, grey instead      of blue.  There was a mackerel sky, with the clouds dropping on the      mountain-tops till you could hardly say which was which.  It was a      mackerel sky of a very bold and extraordinary kind--not a dish of      mackerel, but a world of mackerel!  The mountains are certainly most      lovely.  In this clear air they usually seem close at hand.  It was      only this morning, with the faint glimpse of the dawn whilst the      night clouds were still unpierced by the sunlight, that I seemed to      realize their greatness.  I have seen the same enlightening effect of      aerial perspective a few times before--in Colorado, in Upper India,      in Thibet, and in the uplands amongst the Andes.        There is certainly something in looking at things from above which      tends to raise one's own self-esteem.  From the height, inequalities      simply disappear.  This I have often felt on a big scale when      ballooning, or, better still, from an aeroplane.  Even here from the      tower the outlook is somehow quite different from below.  One      realizes the place and all around it, not in detail, but as a whole.      I shall certainly sleep up here occasionally, when you have come and      we have settled down to our life as it is to be.  I shall live in my      own room downstairs, where I can have the intimacy of the garden.      But I shall appreciate it all the more from now and again losing the      sense of intimacy for a while, and surveying it without the sense of      one's own self-importance.        I hope you have started on that matter of the servants.  For myself,      I don't care a button whether or not there are any servants at all;      but I know well that you won't come till you have made your      arrangements regarding them!  Another thing, Aunt Janet.  You must      not be killed with work here, and it is all so vast . . . Why can't      you get some sort of secretary who will write your letters and do all      that sort of thing for you?  I know you won't have a man secretary;      but there are lots of women now who can write shorthand and      typewrite.  You could doubtless get one in the clan--someone with a      desire to better herself.  I know you would make her happy here.  If      she is not too young, all the better; she will have learned to hold      her tongue and mind her own business, and not be too inquisitive.      That would be a nuisance when we are finding our way about in a new      country and trying to reconcile all sorts of opposites in a whole new      country with new people, whom at first we shan't understand, and who      certainly won't understand us; where every man carries a gun with as      little thought of it as he has of buttons!  Good-bye for a while.                                                                   Your loving                                                                     RUPERT.    _From Rupert Sent Leger_, _Vissarion_, _to Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom_.                                                           _February_ 3, 1907.        I am back in my own room again.  Already it seems to me that to get      here again is like coming home.  I have been going about for the last      few days amongst the mountaineers and trying to make their      acquaintance.  It is a tough job; and I can see that there will be      nothing but to stick to it.  They are in reality the most primitive      people I ever met--the most fixed to their own ideas, which belong to      centuries back.  I can understand now what people were like in      England--not in Queen Elizabeth's time, for that was civilized time,      but in the time of Coeur-de-Lion, or even earlier--and all the time      with the most absolute mastery of weapons of precision.  Every man      carries a rifle--and knows how to use it, too.  I do believe they      would rather go without their clothes than their guns if they had to      choose between them.  They also carry a handjar, which used to be      their national weapon.  It is a sort of heavy, straight cutlass, and      they are so expert with it as well as so strong that it is as facile      in the hands of a Blue Mountaineer as is a foil in the hands of a      Persian _maitre d'armes_.  They are so proud and reserved that they      make one feel quite small, and an \"outsider\" as well.  I can see      quite well that they rather resent my being here at all.  It is not      personal, for when alone with me they are genial, almost brotherly;      but the moment a few of them get together they are like a sort of      jury, with me as the criminal before them.  It is an odd situation,      and quite new to me.  I am pretty well accustomed to all sorts of      people, from cannibals to Mahatmas, but I'm blessed if I ever struck      such a type as this--so proud, so haughty, so reserved, so distant,      so absolutely fearless, so honourable, so hospitable.  Uncle Roger's      head was level when he chose them out as a people to live amongst.      Do you know, Aunt Janet, I can't help feeling that they are very much      like your own Highlanders--only more so.  I'm sure of one thing: that      in the end we shall get on capitally together.  But it will be a slow      job, and will need a lot of patience.  I have a feeling in my bones      that when they know me better they will be very loyal and very true;      and I am not a hair's-breadth afraid of them or anything they shall      or might do.  That is, of course, if I live long enough for them to      have time to know me.  Anything may happen with such an indomitable,      proud people to whom pride is more than victuals.  After all, it only      needs one man out of a crowd to have a wrong idea or to make a      mistake as to one's motive--and there you are.  But it will be all      right that way, I am sure.  I am come here to stay, as Uncle Roger      wished.  And stay I shall even if it has to be in a little bed of my      own beyond the garden--seven feet odd long, and not too narrow--or      else a stone-box of equal proportions in the vaults of St. Sava's      Church across the Creek--the old burial-place of the Vissarions and      other noble people for a good many centuries back . . .        I have been reading over this letter, dear Aunt Janet, and I am      afraid the record is rather an alarming one.  But don't you go      building up superstitious horrors or fears on it.  Honestly, I am      only joking about death--a thing to which I have been rather prone      for a good many years back.  Not in very good taste, I suppose, but      certainly very useful when the old man with the black wings goes      flying about you day and night in strange places, sometimes visible      and at others invisible.  But you can always hear wings, especially      in the dark, when you cannot see them.  _You_ know that, Aunt Janet,      who come of a race of warriors, and who have special sight behind or      through the black curtain.        Honestly, I am in no whit afraid of the Blue Mountaineers, nor have I      a doubt of them.  I love them already for their splendid qualities,      and I am prepared to love them for themselves.  I feel, too, that      they will love me (and incidentally they are sure to love you).  I      have a sort of undercurrent of thought that there is something in      their minds concerning me--something not painful, but disturbing;      something that has a base in the past; something that has hope in it      and possible pride, and not a little respect.
