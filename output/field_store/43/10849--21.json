And now, Dick, I am thoroughly sleepy--the sooner we are in bed the  better.\"    CHAPTER EIGHT.    THE SECOND ADVANCE.    It was some days before the news reached Newcastle of the complete  success of the relieving column.  On their first day's march no  difficulty was met with.  The road was a good one, and the Zulus did not  show in any force.  The column halted for the night near the junction of  the Inyoni and Amatikulu rivers.  The waggons were placed in laager and  a ditch and parapet formed round the camp.  The ground was open and the  waggons were able to travel six abreast.  Numerous Zulu kraals were  passed; but these were found deserted.    On the afternoon of the 1st they encamped at Ginghilovo.  From this  point Ekowe was visible; signals were exchanged with the besieged, and  Colonel Pearson warned Lord Chelmsford that the Zulus were moving  forward to attack him.  The night passed quietly, but the greatest  vigilance was maintained.    At daybreak dense masses of Zulus were seen in the distance, and at six  o'clock they approached the camp.  They came on in their usual order,  with a massive centre and advanced horns on either flank.  The British  were kept lying down behind the shallow trenches they had thrown up.  The Zulus advanced in splendid order with a sort of dancing step.  Their  white and coloured shields, their crests of leopard skins and feathers,  and the long ox-tails dangling from their necks gave them a wild and  strange appearance.  Every ten or fifteen yards the first line would  halt, a shot would be fired, then a loud yell burst forth, and they  again advanced with a humming sound, in time to which their dancing  movement was kept up.  The 60th, who lay opposite to the point against  which they advanced, withheld their fire until the first line of  skirmishers came to within 300 yards.  Then a deadly sheet of flame  flashed along the ridge of the shelter-trench, and a number of the Zulu  warriors fell.    The main body now rushed forward, and although a tremendous fusilade was  kept up on them, the Zulu advance pressed on, ever fed by those in the  rear, which deployed in excellent order as they reinforced the first  line.  For twenty minutes the fire of the 60th never ceased.  Again and  again the Zulus pressed forward, but their leading ranks were swept away  by the storm of bullets.    At half-past six the Zulu masses, without the smallest confusion, faced  to their right, ran round in columns, and fell upon the face of the  laager held by the 57th and 91st.  Here they were as hotly received as  they had been by the 60th.  Notwithstanding the deadly fire, the Zulus  pressed forward with noble courage.  They had ceased to shout now, and  seemed only anxious to reach the square.  Four times they rushed  forward; each time they fell back with terrible loss.  The fire of the  soldiers was assisted by that of the native contingent, who, posted in  the waggons behind, added their fire to that of the 91st and 57th.    The last attack was led by Dabulamanzi in person, and arrived within  five yards of the muzzles of the men's rifles; indeed one or two of the  chiefs actually seized the hot barrels with one hand, while they stabbed  at the men with their shortened assegais.    This was their final repulse, and they now began to fall back.  The  moment that they did so, the cavalry dashed out in pursuit, and chased  them far across the plain.  The gatlings and 9-pounders added in no  slight degree to the effect of the rifles.  The entire English loss was  but two officers and four privates killed, and three officers and  thirty-four privates wounded; while the Zulu loss exceeded 1000.  The  force under Dabulamanzi was about 11,000, and a similar force was close  at hand, but fortunately had not joined that of Dabulamanzi before he  attacked the British.    On the following day the 57th, 60th, and 91st, together with the mounted  men and several of the mounted brigade, taking with them three days'  provisions, marched for Ekowe.  Major Barrow scouted the ground, and  reported that everywhere assegais, shields, feathers, ear and head  ornaments, skins, furs, blankets, and ever; guns were lying about in  confusion, evidently cast away in their headlong flight by the Zulus,  but that none of these had been seen.    The column, however, advanced with every precaution, as it was possible  that Dabulamanzi might procure reinforcements.  No enemy, however, was  met with, and the column continued its march until they were met by  Colonel Pearson with 500 men, coming out to lend a hand to them in case  they should be attacked.  The united column then marched into Ekowe.  The health of the garrison had suffered much from exposure to the sun  and rain, and from the want of vegetables and useful medicine.  Beef  they had plenty of, as it was considered advisable to kill and consume  the waggon-oxen rather than see them die from want of forage.    The great event of the siege had been the discovery of certain strange  flashes of light on the white walls of the church-tower; these, after  puzzling many of the officers and soldiers, were at length brought under  the notice of an officer of the naval brigade, who had been trained in  the use of the heliograph, and he was able at once to explain the  mystery.  They were three days before they could contrive an apparatus,  which could be worked, to reply.  Fortunately an old mirror was found,  and communication was opened.  The effect of their renewed intercourse  with the outer world, and of learning the preparations which were being  made for their relief, acted more beneficially on the health of the  imprisoned garrison than all the tonics the hospital could afford.  Nevertheless between the commencement of the siege and the arrival of  the relief thirty deaths had occurred.    To the great regret of the garrison they found that it had been  determined by the general to abandon the fort which they had held so  long, as the whole force was required in Natal for operations in the  veld in conjunction with the reinforcements on their way out.  Before  leaving, however, it was determined to strike another blow at  Dabulamanzi, whose private residence had escaped at the time that his  kraal was burnt.  A small party of about 200 men therefore went out and  fired the place without resistance.  Ekowe was evacuated, and, having  left a garrison at Ginghilovo, Lord Chelmsford retired with his force  across the Tugela.    Every day for the next fortnight news reached Newcastle of the arrival  of one or more transports with reinforcements, and in a month from the  date of the arrival of the first from England, seventeen transports came  in, bringing more than 9000 soldiers and 2000 horses.  The force  consisted of two regiments of cavalry, 1250 sabres, two batteries of  artillery with 540 men, 190 men of the Royal Engineers, six regiments of  infantry, 5320 bayonets, draughts of the regiments already in the colony  and Army Service Corps' men, 1200.  Most of the regiments brought their  equipments complete and ready for the field--tents, waterproof-sheets,  cooking utensils, and camp stores.  The Army Service Corps brought with  them 100 light but strongly-built waggons.    Among the arrivals was the Prince Imperial of France, who had come out  as a volunteer.    To convey the baggage and stores of so numerous a force an immense  number of waggons was required, and a very urgent appeal was made to the  loyalty of the colonists to furnish transport for the troops engaged in  fighting their battles.    In answer to this appeal Mr Humphreys and Mr Jackson decided to send  down the new waggons which had just been finished.  Immediately they  heard of the decision, Dick and Tom begged for permission again to  accompany the waggons.  Their mothers at first refused even to listen to  the request, but their fathers, talking the matter over between them,  agreed that harm was not likely this time to come of it.    The force was so overwhelmingly strong that there was not the slightest  prospect of a repetition of the disaster of Isandula.  At that time  several hundred English soldiers had been surprised and crushed by some  20,000 of the enemy, but in future every precaution would be taken, and  the British force would be ten times as strong as that which fought at  Isandula.  The colonists thought that it would be really an advantage to  the boys to take part in the expedition; it was quite possible that if  they remained in the colony they might have occasion to take part in  wars with one or other of the native tribes, and the experience that  they would gain in the campaign would in that case assuredly be useful  to them.  Having thus decided, Mr Humphreys and his friend succeeded in  obtaining their wives' consent to the boys accompanying the waggons, and  in high glee they started for Durban on the 20th of April.    The campaign was arranged on a new plan.  The numerous columns in which  the strength of the force had been frittered away were abolished, and  the following was adopted as the designation of the forces in the field,  under the lieutenant-general commanding, viz.:--1st Division South  African Field-forces, Major-General Crealock, C.B., commanding,  consisting of all troops on the left bank of the Lower Tugela; 2nd  Division South African Field-forces, Major-General Newdigate commanding,  consisting of all troops in the Utrecht district other than those  attached to the Flying Column under Brigadier-General Wood, V.C., C.B.,  which was designated as \"Brigadier-General Wood's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32950"],[0,"Camp and Trail (#17)"],[1,"to pack your equipment with only these simple auxiliaries.    Lay your tarp on the ground fully spread. On half of it pack your  effects, striving always to keep them as flat and smooth as possible.  Fold the other half of the canvas to cover the pack. Lay this thick  mattress-like affair across the horse's bare back, and proceed to throw  the squaw hitch as follows:    [Illustration: Fig. 1    Fig. 2    Fig. 3    _The Squaw Hitch._]    [Sidenote: The Squaw Hitch]    Throw a double bight across the top of the pack (Fig. 1). Pass end _a_  under the horse and through loop _c_; and end _b_ under the horse and  through loop (_d_). Take both _a_ and _b_ directly back under the horse  again, in the opposite direction, of course, and pass both through loop  (_e_). Now cinch up on the two ends and fasten.    [Sidenote: Sling]    8. _Sling No. 1._--When you possess no kyacks, but have some sort of  pack saddle, it is necessary to improvise a sling.    [Illustration: Fig. 1    Fig. 2    Fig. 3    Fig. 4    _Sling No. 1._]    Fasten the middle of your rope by means of two half hitches to the front  of the pack saddle (Fig. 1). Throw the ends (_b_, _b_) crossed as shown  in Fig. 2. Place the box or sack in bight (_a_), passing the rope around  the outside and the ends, as in Fig. 3. The end of the sack should be  just even with the front of the pack saddle. If you bring it too far  forward the front of the sling will sag. Pass the end (_b_) underneath  the sack or burden, across its middle, and over the top of the saddle.  When the other side is similarly laden, the ends (_b_, _b_) may be tied  together at the top; or if they are long enough, may be fastened at _c_  (Fig. 4).    [Sidenote: Another Sling]    9. _Sling No. 2._--Another sling is sometimes handy for long bundles,  and is made as follows:    [Illustration: _Sling No. 2._]    Fasten the rope by the middle as explained in the last. Fasten ends  (_b_, _b_) to the rear horn or to each other (see diagram). Leave the  bights of the rope (_a_, _a_) of sufficient length so they can be looped  around the burden and over the horns. This sling is useful only on a  regular pack saddle, while the other really does not need the rear  pommel at all, as the ropes can be crossed without it.    [Sidenote: The Saddle Hitch]    10. _The Saddle Hitch._--There remains now the possibility, or let us  hope probability, that you may some day wish to pack a deer on your  riding saddle, or perhaps bring in a sack of grain or some such matter.    Throw the rope across the seat of the saddle, leaving long ends on both  sides. Lay your deer aboard, crosswise. Thrust a bight (_a_) of one end  through your cinch ring, and pass the loop thus formed around the deer's  neck (Fig. 1). Repeat on the other side, bringing the loop there about  his haunch. Cinch up the two ends of the rope, and tie them on top.    [Illustration: _The Saddle Hitch._]    [Illustration: _Illustrating How to Pack Eggs or Glassware._]    [Illustration: _THE RESULT OF NOT GETTING THE HITCH ON SNUG._]    [Sidenote: The Saddle Hitch]    [Sidenote: How to Pack Fragile Stuff]    The great point in throwing any hitch is to keep the rope taut. To do  this, pay no attention to your free end, but clamp down firmly the fast  end with your left hand until the right has made the next turn. Remember  this; it is important. The least slip back of the slack you have gained  is going to loosen that pack by ever so little; and then you can rely on  the swing and knocks of the day's journey to do the rest. The horse rubs  under a limb or against a big rock; the loosened rope scrapes off the  top of the pack; something flops or rattles or falls--immediately that  cayuse arches his back, lowers his head, and begins to buck. It is  marvelous to what height the bowed back will send small articles  catapult-wise into the air. First go the tarpaulin and blankets; then  the duffle bags; then one by one the contents of the alforjas; finally,  after they have been sufficiently lightened, the alforjas themselves in  an abandoned parabola of debauched delight. In the meantime that  horse, and all the others, has been running frantically all over the  rough mountains, through the rocks, ravines, brush and forest trees. You  have ridden recklessly trying to round them up, sweating, swearing,  praying to the Red Gods that none of those indispensable animals is  going to get lame in this insane hippodrome. Finally between you, you  have succeeded in collecting and tying to trees all the culprits. Then  you have to trail inch by inch along the track of the cyclone, picking  up from where they have fallen, rolled, or been trampled, the contents  of that pack down to the smallest. It will take you the rest of the day;  and then you'll miss some. Oh, it pays to get your hitch on snug!    [Sidenote: The Tie Hitch]    11. _The Tie Hitch._--The hitches described are all I have ever had  occasion to use, and will probably carry you through any emergencies  that may be likely to arise. But perhaps many times during the day you  are likely to want to stop the train for the purpose of some  adjustments. Therefore you will attach your lead ropes in a manner  easily to be thrown loose. Thrust the bight (_a_) of the lead rope  beneath any part of the pack rope (_b_, _b_). Double back the bight  (_d_) of the loose end (_c_) through the loop (_a_) thus formed. Tighten  the knot by pulling tight on loop _d_. A sharp pull on _c_ will free the  entire lead rope.    [Illustration: _The Tie Hitch._]          CHAPTER XI    HORSES, MULES, BURROS      [Sidenote: Mules]    A GOOD riding mule, when you can get him, and provided you intend to use  him only for trail travel in the mountains, is about the best  proposition. A mule is more sure-footed than a horse, and can subsist  where a horse would starve. On the other hand he is not much good off a  walk; never acquires the horse's interest in getting around stubborn  stock, and is apt to be mean. None of these objections, however much  they may influence your decision as to saddle animals, will have any  weight against a pack beast. For the latter purpose the mule is  unexcelled. But probably in the long run you will prefer to ride a  horse.    [Sidenote: Burros]    Burros are an aggravation; and yet in some circumstances they are hard  to beat. They are unbelievably slow, and unbelievably stubborn. When  they get tired--or think they do--they stop, and urging merely confirms  their decision to rest. You cannot hurry them. They hate water, and it  is sometimes next to impossible to force them into a deep or swift  stream. They are camp thieves, and will eat anything left within their  reach. Still, they can live on sage-bush, go incredible periods without  drinking, make their way through country impassible to any other hoofed  animals excepting goats and sheep. Certain kinds of desert travel is  impossible without them, and some sorts of high rough mountaineering is  practicable only with their aid. At times you will be driven to the use  of them. In such an emergency gird your soul with patience, and try to  buy big ones.    [Sidenote: Pack Mules]    Pack mules are almost impossible to get, and are generally very high  priced. A good pack mule does not mean any old mule that comes along.  The animal should be rather small, chunkily built, gentle as to the  heels and teeth, accustomed to carrying and taking care of a pack,  trained to follow the saddle horses, and not inclined to stray from  camp. Such perfection costs anywhere from seventy-five to one hundred  and fifty dollars. It is worth the price to one who does much packing;  but as perfectly adequate pack horses can be had for from twenty to  forty dollars, and are easy to find, you will in all likelihood choose  them.    [Sidenote: Choosing a Horse]    Now I know perfectly well that I can tell you nothing about choosing a  horse. If you are a New Englander you will know all about the trade; if  you are a New Yorker, you could give me points on every horse in the  ring; if you are Middle West, you probably have read or worked or traded  or raised more horses than I will ever ride. But in selecting a mountain  horse, his mere points as a physical specimen are often little in his  favor, while glaring defects may concern his usefulness hardly at all.    [Sidenote: Western Horses]    Never mind at first how the horse offered for your inspection looks.  Examine him for blemishes later. You must first discover if he is  sure-footed and courageous. An eastern horse would not last five minutes  on a western trail. A western horse, no matter how accustomed to  mountain work, is worse than useless if subject to ordinary horse-panics  at suddenly rustling leaves, unexpected black stubs, and the like. He  must attend to his footing, keep his eyes for the trail, and _be wise_.  Next you must inquire if this steadiness carries over into other things.  He must stand when left without hitching, and must be easy to catch.  Often you will have to dismount for the purpose of clearing trail,  helping the pack train, tightening ropes, or reconnoitering. At such  junctures iron hitching posts are not always at hand. Nothing is more  aggravating than the necessity of searching everywhere for a place to  tie, or worse, to be forced to chase down and coax quiet a horse that  has promptly decamped when left for a moment to himself. Nor does it add  to your joy to get up at four for the purpose of making an early start,  only to spend the extra hour filched from sleep in an attempt to catch  some snorting fool horse.    The picture I have sketched looks to you somewhat like what is known as  an \"old cow,\" doesn't it? But in reality good horses of the quality  named are not difficult to find. Equine intelligence is of a higher  grade West than East, mainly because a western horse is all his life  thrown on his own resources. It is perfectly possible to find a horse  both handsome and"]]]
