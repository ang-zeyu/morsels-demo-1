The expansive force of steam is prodigious; but in order to subject  water to such high temperatures, it is prevented by confinement from  being converted into steam, and the expansion of heated water is  comparatively trifling. --But we have dwelt so long on the subject of  free caloric, that we must reserve the other modifications of that agent  to our next meeting, when we shall endeavour to proceed more rapidly.          CONVERSATION IV.    ON COMBINED CALORIC, COMPREHENDING SPECIFIC AND LATENT HEAT.      MRS. B.    We are now to examine the other modifications of caloric.    CAROLINE.    I am very curious to know of what nature they can be; for I have no  notion of any kind of heat that is not perceptible to the senses.    MRS. B.    In order to enable you to understand them, it will be necessary to enter  into some previous explanations.    It has been discovered by modern chemists, that bodies of a different  nature, heated to the same temperature, do not contain the same quantity  of caloric.    CAROLINE.    How could that be ascertained? Have you not told us that it is  impossible to discover the absolute quantity of caloric which bodies  contain?    MRS. B.    True; but at the same time I said that we were enabled to form a  judgment of the proportions which bodies bore to each other in this  respect. Thus it is found that, in order to raise the temperature of  different bodies the same number of degrees, different quantities of  caloric are required for each of them. If, for instance, you place a  pound of lead, a pound of chalk, and a pound of milk, in a hot oven,  they will be gradually heated to the temperature of the oven; but the  lead will attain it first, the chalk next, and the milk last.    CAROLINE.    That is a natural consequence of their different bulks; the lead being  the smallest body, will be heated soonest, and the milk, which is the  largest, will require the longest time.    MRS. B.    That explanation will not do, for if the lead be the least in bulk, it  offers also the least surface to the caloric, the quantity of heat  therefore which can enter into it in the same space of time is  proportionally smaller.    EMILY.    Why, then, do not the three bodies attain the temperature of the oven at  the same time?    MRS. B.    It is supposed to be on account of the different capacity of these  bodies for caloric.    CAROLINE.    What do you mean by the capacity of a body for caloric?    MRS. B.    I mean a certain disposition of bodies to require more or less caloric  for raising their temperature to any degree of heat. Perhaps the fact  may be thus explained:    Let us put as many marbles into this glass as it will contain, and pour  some sand over them--observe how the sand penetrates and lodges between  them. We shall now fill another glass with pebbles of various forms--you  see that they arrange themselves in a more compact manner than the  marbles, which, being globular, can touch each other by a single point  only. The pebbles, therefore, will not admit so much sand between them;  and consequently one of these glasses will necessarily contain more sand  than the other, though both of them be equally full.    CAROLINE.    This I understand perfectly. The marbles and the pebbles represent two  bodies of different kinds, and the sand the caloric contained in them;  it appears very plain, from this comparison, that one body may admit of  more caloric between its particles than another.    MRS. B.    You can no longer be surprised, therefore, that bodies of a different  capacity for caloric should require different proportions of that fluid  to raise their temperatures equally.    EMILY.    But I do not conceive why the body that contains the most caloric should  not be of the highest temperature; that is to say, feel hot in  proportion to the quantity of caloric it contains?    MRS. B.    The caloric that is employed in filling the capacity of a body, is not  free caloric; but is imprisoned as it were in the body, and is therefore  imperceptible: for we can feel only the caloric which the body parts  with, and not that which it retains.    CAROLINE.    It appears to me very extraordinary that heat should be confined in a  body in such a manner as to be imperceptible.    MRS. B.    If you lay your hand on a hot body, you feel only the caloric which  leaves it, and enters your hand; for it is impossible that you should be  sensible of that which remains in the body. The thermometer, in the same  manner, is affected only by the free caloric which a body transmits to  it, and not at all by that which it does not part with.    CAROLINE.    I begin to understand it: but I confess that the idea of insensible heat  is so new and strange to me, that it requires some time to render it  familiar.    MRS. B.    Call it insensible caloric, and the difficulty will appear much less  formidable. It is indeed a sort of contradiction to call it heat, when  it is so situated as to be incapable of producing that sensation. Yet  this modification of caloric is commonly called SPECIFIC HEAT.    CAROLINE.    But it certainly would have been more correct to have called it  _specific caloric_.    EMILY.    I do not understand how the term _specific_ applies to this modification  of caloric?    MRS. B.    It expresses the relative quantity of caloric which different _species_  of bodies of the same weight and temperature are capable of containing.  This modification is also frequently called _heat of capacity_, a term  perhaps preferable, as it explains better its own meaning.    You now understand, I suppose, why the milk and chalk required a longer  portion of time than the lead to raise their temperature to that of the  oven?    EMILY.    Yes: the milk and chalk having a greater capacity for caloric than the  lead, a greater proportion of that fluid became insensible in those  bodies: and the more slowly, therefore, their temperature was raised.    CAROLINE.    But might not this difference proceed from the different conducting  powers of heat in these three bodies, since that which is the best  conductor must necessarily attain the temperature of the oven first?    MRS. B.    Very well observed, Caroline. This objection would be insurmountable, if  we could not, by reversing the experiment, prove that the milk, the  chalk, and the lead, actually absorbed different quantities of caloric,  and we know that if the different time they took in heating, proceeded  merely from their different conducting powers, they would each have  acquired an equal quantity of caloric.    CAROLINE.    Certainly. But how can you reverse this experiment?    MRS. B.    It may be done by cooling the several bodies to the same degree in an  apparatus adapted to receive and measure the caloric which they give  out. Thus, if you plunge them into three equal quantities of water, each  at the same temperature, you will be able to judge of the relative  quantity of caloric which the three bodies contained, by that, which, in  cooling, they communicated to their respective portions of water: for  the same quantity of caloric which they each absorbed to raise their  temperature, will abandon them in lowering it; and on examining the  three vessels of water, you will find the one in which you immersed the  lead to be the least heated; that which held the chalk will be the next;  and that which contained the milk will be heated the most of all. The  celebrated Lavoisier has invented a machine to estimate, upon this  principle, the specific heat of bodies in a more perfect manner; but I  cannot explain it to you, till you are acquainted with the next  modification of caloric.    EMILY.    The more dense a body is, I suppose, the less is its capacity for  caloric?    MRS. B.    This is not always the case with bodies of different nature; iron, for  instance, contains more specific heat than tin, though it is more dense.  This seems to show that specific heat does hot merely depend upon the  interstices between the particles; but, probably, also upon some  peculiar constitution of the bodies which we do not comprehend.    EMILY.    But, Mrs. B., it would appear to me more proper to compare bodies by  _measure_, rather than by _weight_, in order to estimate their specific  heat. Why, for instance, should we not compare _pints_ of milk, of  chalk, and of lead, rather than _pounds_ of those substances; for equal  weights may be composed of very different quantities?    MRS. B.    You are mistaken, my dear; equal weight must contain equal quantities of  matter; and when we wish to know what is the relative quantity of  caloric, which substances of various kinds are capable of containing  under the same temperature, we must compare equal weights, and not equal  bulks of those substances. Bodies of the same weight may undoubtedly be  of very different dimensions; but that does not change their real  quantity of matter. A pound of feathers does not contain one atom more  than a pound of lead.    CAROLINE.    I have another difficulty to propose. It appears to me, that if the  temperature of the three bodies in the oven did not rise equally, they  would never reach the same degree; the lead would always keep its  advantage over the chalk and milk, and would perhaps be boiling before  the others had attained the temperature of the oven. I think you might  as well say that, in the course of time, you and I should be of the same  age?    MRS. B.    Your comparison is not correct, Caroline. As soon as the lead reached  the temperature of the oven, it would remain stationary; for it would  then give out as much heat as it would receive. You should recollect  that the exchange of radiating heat, between two bodies of equal  temperature, is equal: it would be impossible, therefore, for the lead  to accumulate heat after having attained the temperature of the oven;  and that of the chalk and milk therefore would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26978"],[0,"Salem Witchcraft and Cotton Mather: A Reply (#17)"],[1," been  approached, and which no community could bear. Every man and woman would  have felt in the extremest peril, hanging upon the will of an  irresponsible arbiter of life and death.    Parris and his associates, acting without authority and in a limited  sphere, had tried this experiment; had spread abroad, terror, havoc, and  ruin; and incensed the surrounding region with a madness it took  generations to allay.    To have thought, for a moment, that it was desirable to be invested with  such a power, \"by the authority,\" shows how ignorant Cotton Mather was  of human nature. However innocent, upright, or benevolent might be its  exercise, he would have been assailed by animosities of the deepest, and  approaches of the basest, kind. A hatred and a sycophancy, such as no  Priest, Pope, or despot before, had encountered, would have been brought  against him. He would have been assailed by the temptation, and aspersed  by the imputation, of \"Hush money,\" from all quarters; and, ultimately,  the whole country would have risen against what would have been regarded  as a universal levy of \"Black Mail.\" Whoever, at any time, in any  country, should undertake such an office as this, would be, in the end,  the victim of the outraged sensibilities and passions of humanity. How  long could it be endured, any where, if all men were liable to receive,  from one authorized and enabled to determine their fate, such a missive  as the Mathers addressed to the Secretary of Connecticut, and, at the  best, to be beholden, as he felt himself to be, to the \"charity\" that  might prevent their being exposed and prosecuted to the ruin of their  reputation, if not to an ignominious death?    Calef, alluding to Mather's pretensions to having been actuated by  \"exceeding tenderness towards persons complained of,\" expresses the  sentiments all would feel, in such a condition of dependence upon the  \"charity\" of one, armed with such fatal power over them: \"These are some  of the destructive notions of this age; and however the asserters of  them seem sometimes to value themselves much upon sheltering their  neighbors from spectral accusations, they may deserve as much thanks as  that Tyrant, that having industriously obtained an unintelligible charge  against his subjects, in matters wherein it was impossible they should  be guilty, having thereby their lives in his power, yet suffers them of  his mere grace to live, and will be called gracious Lord!\"--_Preface._    The mere suspicion that some persons were behind the scene, exercising  this power of pointing out some for prosecution and sheltering some from  trial or arrest, produced, as Phips says, \"a strange ferment of  dissatisfaction,\" threatening to kindle \"an inextinguishable flame.\"  Brattle complained of it bitterly: \"This occasions much discourse and  many hot words, and is a very great scandal and stumbling block to many  good people; certainly distributive justice should have its course,  without respect to persons; and, although the said Mrs. Thatcher be  mother-in-law to Mr. Curwin, who is one of the Justices and Judges, yet,  if justice and conscience do oblige them to apprehend others on account  of the afflicted their complaints, I cannot see how, without injustice  and violence to conscience, Mrs. Thatcher can escape, when it is well  known how much she is, and has been, complained of.\"--Letter dated  October 8th, 1692, in the _Massachusetts Historical Society's  Collections_, I., v., 69.    Hezekial Usher, an eminent citizen of Boston, was arrested by Joseph  Lynde, one of the Council, but suffered to remain, \"for above a  fortnight,\" in a private house, and afterwards to leave the Province.  Brattle \"cannot but admire\" at this, and says: \"Methinks that same  justice, that actually imprisoned others, and refused bail for them, on  any terms, should not be satisfied without actually imprisoning Mr. U.,  and refusing bail for him, when his case is known to be the very same  with the case of those others.\"    Brattle was a friend of Usher, and believed him innocent, yet was  indignant that such barefaced partiality should be shown in judicial  proceedings. The establishment of a regular systematized plan, committed  to any individual, for sheltering some, while others would be handed  back for punishment, would have been unendurable.    As it was, Mather exposed himself to much odium, because it was  understood that he was practising, on his own responsibility and  privately, upon the plan he wished the Judges to adopt, as a principle  and method of procedure, in all the trials. He says: \"It may be, no man  living ever had more people, under preternatural and astonishing  circumstances, cast by the providence of God into his more particular  care than I have had.\"    Of course, those persons would be most obnoxious to ill-feeling in the  community, who were known, as he says of himself, in the foregoing  sentence, to have most intimacy with, and influence over, the accusers.  For this reason, Cotton Mather was the special object of resentment. No  wonder that he sometimes bewails, and sometimes berates, the storm of  angry passions raging around. A very bitter feeling pervaded the  country, grounded on the conviction that there was \"a respect to  persons,\" and a connivance, in behalf of some, by those managing the  affair. The public was shocked by having such persons as the Rev. Samuel  Willard, Mrs. Hale of Beverly, and the Lady of the Governor, cried out  upon by the \"afflicted children;\" and the commotion was heightened by a  cross-current of indignant enquiries: \"Why, as these persons are  accused, are they not arrested and imprisoned?\"    Mather alludes, in frequent passages, to this angry state of feeling, as  the following: \"It is by our quarrels that we spoil our prayers; and if  our humble, zealous, and united prayers are once hindered! Alas, the  Philistines of Hell have cut our locks for us; they will then blind us,  mock us, ruin us. In truth, I cannot altogether blame it, if people are  a little transported, when they conceive all the secular interests of  themselves and their families at stake, and yet, at the sight of these  heart-burnings, I cannot forbear the exclamation of the sweet-spirited  Austin, in his pacificatory epistle to Jerom, on the contest with  Ruffin, '_O misera et miseranda conditio!_'\"--_Wonders_, 11.    There was another evil to which he exposed himself by seeking to have  such frequent, private, and confidential intercourse with the afflicted  accusers and confessing witches, who professed to have so often seen,  associated with, and suffered from, spectral images of the Devil's  confederates; which spectral shapes, as was believed, were, after all,  the Devil himself. He came under the imputation of what, in Scripture,  is pronounced one of the darkest of crimes. The same charge was made to  tell against Mr. Parris, helping effectually to remove him from the  ministry at Salem Village. _Leviticus_, xx., 6. \"And the soul that  turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a  whoring after them, I will set my face against that soul, and will cut  him off from among his people.\" _1 Chronicles_, x., 13. \"So Saul died  for his transgression, which he committed against the Lord, even  against the word of the Lord, which he kept not; and also, for asking  counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to inquire of it, and  inquired not of the Lord, therefore he slew him.\"    For having so much to do with persons professing to suffer from, and  from others confessing to have committed, the sin of witchcraft, Mather  became the object of a scathing rebuke in the letter of Brattle, in a  passage I shall quote, in another connection.    Such, then, so far as I can gather, was Cotton Mather's plan for the  management of witchcraft investigations; such its impracticability; and  such the dangerous and injurious consequences to himself, of attempting  to put it into practice. He never fully divulged it; but, in the  _Advice_ of the Ministers and various other writings, endeavored to pave  the way for it. All the expressions, in that document and elsewhere,  which have deceived the Reviewer and others into the notion that he was  opposed to the admission of spectre evidence, at the trials, were used  as arguments to persuade \"authority\" not to receive that species of  evidence, in open Court, but to refer it to him, in the first instance,  to be managed by him with exquisite caution and discretion, and, thereby  avoid inconveniences and promote good results; and when he could not  subdue the difficulties of the case, to deliver back the obdurate and  unrepentant, to the Court, to be proceeded against in the ordinary  course of law. With this view, he has much to say that indicates a  tender regard to the prisoners. It is true that the scheme, if adopted,  would have given him absolute power over the community, and, for this  reason, may have had attraction. But, I doubt not, that he cherished it  from benevolent feelings also. He thought that he might, in that way, do  great good. But it could not be carried into effect. It was seen, at  once, by all men, who had any sense left, to be utterly impracticable,  and had to be abandoned. That being settled and disposed of, he went  into the prosecutions without misgivings, earnestly and vehemently  sustaining the Court, in all things, spectre evidence included, as  remains to be shown.          VIII.    COTTON MATHER AND SPECTRAL EVIDENCE.      I shall continue to draw, at some length, upon Mather's writings, to  which I ask the careful attention of the reader. The subject to which  they mostly relate, is of much interest, presenting views of a class of  topics, holding, for a long period, a mighty sway over the human mind.    In his _Life of Phips_, written in 1697, and constituting the concluding  part of the Second Book of the _Magnalia_, he gives a general account of  what"]]]
