Pollution of udder_ of animal _by wading in infected water_, or by  washing same with contaminated water. This method of infection would  only be likely to occur in case of typhoid. An outbreak at the  University of Virginia in 1893[107] was ascribed to the latter cause.    _5. Pollution of creamery by-products, skim-milk, etc._ Where the milk  supply of one patron becomes infected with pathogenic bacteria, it is  possible that disease may be disseminated through the medium of the  creamery, the infective agent remaining in the skim milk after  separation and so polluting the mixed supply. This condition is more  likely to prevail with typhoid because of the greater tolerance of this  organism for acids such as would be found in raw milk. The outbreaks at  Brandon,[108] England, in 1893, Castle Island,[109] Ireland, and  Marlboro,[110] Mass., in 1894, were traced to such an origin.    While most outbreaks of disease associated with a polluted milk supply  originate in the use of the milk itself, yet infected milk may serve to  cause disease even when used in other ways. Several outbreaks of typhoid  fever have been traced to the use of ice cream where there were strong  reasons for believing that the milk used in the manufacture of the  product was polluted.[111] Hankin[112] details a case of an Indian  confection made largely from milk that caused a typhoid outbreak in a  British regiment.    Although the evidence that milk may not infrequently serve as an agent  in spreading disease is conclusive enough to satisfactorily prove the  proposition, yet it should be borne in mind that the organism of any  specific disease in question has rarely ever been found. The reasons for  this are quite the same as those that govern the situation in the case  of polluted waters, except that the difficulties of the problem are much  greater in the case of milk than with water. The inability to readily  separate the typhoid germ, for instance, from the colon bacillus, an  organism frequently found in milk, presents technical difficulties not  easily overcome. The most potent reason of failure to find disease  bacteria is the fact that infection in any case must occur sometime  previous to the appearance of the outbreak. Not only is there the usual  period of incubation, but it rarely happens that an outbreak is  investigated until a number of cases have occurred. In this interim the  original cause of infection may have ceased to be operative.    ~Typhoid fever.~ With reference to the diseases likely to to be  disseminated through the medium of milk, infected after being drawn from  the animal, typhoid fever is the most important. The reason for this is  due (1) to the wide spread distribution of the disease; (2) to the fact  that the typhoid bacillus is one that is capable of withstanding  considerable amounts of acid, and consequently finds even in raw milk  containing the normal lactic acid bacteria conditions favorable for its  growth.[113] Ability to grow under these conditions can be shown not  only experimentally, but there is abundant clinical evidence that even a  slight infection often causes extensive outbreaks, as in the Stamford,  Conn., outbreak in 1895 where 386 cases developed in a few weeks, 97 per  cent. of which occurred on the route of one milk-man. In this case the  milk cans were thoroughly and properly cleaned, but were rinsed out with  _cold_ water from a shallow well that was found to be polluted.    The most common mode of pollution of milk with typhoid organisms is  where the milk utensils are infected in one way or another.[114] Second  in importance is the carrying of infection by persons serving in the  dual capacity of nurse and dairy attendant.    ~Cholera.~ This germ does not find milk so favorable a nutrient medium as  the typhoid organism, because it is much more sensitive toward the  action of acids. Kitasato[115] found, however, that it could live in  raw milk from one to four days, depending upon the amount of acid  present. In boiled or sterilized milk it grows more freely, as the  acid-producing forms are thereby eliminated. In butter it dies out in a  few days (4 to 5).    On account of the above relation not a large number of cholera outbreaks  have been traced to milk, but Simpson[116] records a very striking case  in India where a number of sailors, upon reaching port, secured a  quantity of milk. Of the crew which consumed this, every one was taken  ill, and four out of ten died, while those who did not partake escaped  without any disease. It was later shown that the milk was adulterated  with water taken from an open pool in a cholera infected district.    ~Diphtheria.~ Milk occasionally, though not often, serves as a medium for  the dissemination of diphtheria. Swithinbank and Newman[117] cites four  cases in which the causal organism has been isolated from milk. It has  been observed that growth occurs more rapidly in raw than in sterilized  milk.[118]    Infection in this disease is more frequently attributable to direct  infection from patient on account of the long persistence of this germ  in the throat, or indirectly through the medium of an attendant.    ~Scarlet fever.~ Although it is more difficult to study the relation of  this disease to contaminated milk supplies, because the causal germ of  scarlet fever is not yet known, yet the origin of a considerable number  of epidemics has been traced to polluted milk supplies. Milk doubtless  is infected most frequently from persons in the earlier stages of the  disease when the infectivity of the disease is greater.    ~Diarrhoeal diseases.~ Milk not infrequently acquires the property of  producing diseases of the digestive tract by reason of the development  of various bacteria that form more or less poisonous by-products. These  troubles occur most frequently during the summer months, especially with  infants and children, as in cholera infantum and summer complaint. The  higher mortality of bottle-fed infants[119] in comparison with those  that are nursed directly is explicable on the theory that cows' milk is  the carrier of the infection, because in many cases it is not consumed  until there has been ample time for the development of organisms in it.  Where milk is pasteurized or boiled it is found that the mortality among  children is greatly reduced. As a cause of sickness and death these  diseases exceed in importance all other specific diseases previously  referred to. These troubles have generally been explained as produced by  bacteria of the putrefactive class which find their way into the milk  through the introduction of filth and dirt at time of milking.[120]  Fluegge[121] has demonstrated that certain peptonizing species possess  toxic properties for animals. Recent experimental inquiry[122] has  demonstrated that the dysentery bacillus (Shiga) probably bears a causal  relation to some of these summer complaints.    ~Ptomaine poisoning.~ Many cases of poisoning from food products are also  reported with adults. These are due to the formation of various toxic  products, generally ptomaines, that are produced as a result of  infection of foods by different bacteria. One of these substances,  _tyrotoxicon_, was isolated by Vaughan[123] from cheese and various  other products of milk, and found to possess the property of producing  symptoms of poisoning similar to those that are noted in such cases. He  attributes the production of this toxic effect to the decomposition of  the elements in the milk induced by putrefactive forms of bacteria that  develop where milk is improperly kept.[124] Often outbreaks of this  character[125] assume the proportions of an epidemic, where a large  number of persons use the tainted food.

In a tuberculous animal, even in the very earliest  phases of the disease, tuberculin causes a temporary fever that lasts  for a few hours. By taking the temperature a number of times before and  after injection it is possible to readily recognize any febrile  condition.

Who  is ignorant of the story? Does not every visitor to Newcastle pause  before an old house in Sandhill, and look up at the blue pane which  marks the window from which Bessie descended into her lover's arms?    Jack and Bessie were not punished with even that brief period of  suffering and uncertainty which conscientious novelists are accustomed,  for the sake of social morals, to assign to run-away lovers before the  merciful guardian or tender parent promises forgiveness and a liberal  allowance, paid in quarterly installments. In his old age Eldon used to  maintain that their plight was very pitiable on the third morning after  their rash union. \"Our funds were exhausted: we had not a home to go to,  and we knew not whether our friends would ever speak to us again.\" In  this strain ran the veteran's story, which, like all other anecdotes  from the same source, must be received with caution. But even the old  peer, ever ready to exaggerate his early difficulties, had not enough  effrontery to represent that their dejection lasted more than three  days. The fathers of the bride and bridegroom soon met and came to  terms, and with the beginning of the new year Bessie Scott was living in  New Inn Hall, Oxford, whilst her husband read Vinerian Lectures, and  presided over that scholastic house. The position of Scott at this time  was very singular. He was acting as substitute for Sir Robert Chambers,  the principal of New Inn Hall and Vinerian Professor of Law, who  contrived to hold his university preferments, whilst he discharged the  duties of a judge in India. To give an honest color to this indefensible  arrangement, it was provided that the lectures read from the Vinerian  Chair should actually be written by the Professor, although they were  delivered by deputy. Scott, therefore, as the Professor's mouth-piece,  on a salary of L60 a year, with free quarters in the Principal's house,  was merely required to read a series of treatises sent to him by the  absent teacher. \"The law-professor,\" the ex-Chancellor used to relate  with true Eldonian humor and _fancy_--\"sent me the first lecture, which  I had to read immediately to the students, and which I began without  knowing a single word that was in it. It was upon the statute (4 and 5  P. and M. c. 8), 'of young men running away with maidens.' Fancy me  reading, with about 140 boys and young men all giggling at the  Professor! Such a tittering audience no one ever had.\" If this incident  really occurred on the occasion of his 'first reading,' the laughter  must have been inextinguishable; for, of course, Jack Scott's run-away  marriage had made much gossip in Oxford Common Rooms, and the singular  loveliness of his girlish wife (described by an eye-witness as being \"so  very young as to give the impression of childhood,\") stirred the heart  of every undergraduate who met her in High Street.    There is no harm done by laughter at the old Chancellor's romantic  fictions about the poverty which he and his Bessie encountered, hand in  hand, at the outset of life; for the laughter blinds no one to the  genuine affection and wholesome honesty of the young husband and wife.  One has reason to wish that marriages such as theirs were more frequent  amongst lawyers in these ostentatious days. At present the young  barrister, who marries before he has a clear fifteen hundred a year, is  charged with reckless imprudence; and unless his wife is a woman of  fortune, or he is able to settle a heavy sum of money upon her, his  anxious friends terrify him with pictures of want and sorrow stored up  for him in the future. Society will not let him live after the fashion  of 'juniors' eighty or a hundred years since. He must maintain two  establishments--his chambers for business, his house in the west-end of  town for his wife. Moreover, the lady must have a brougham and liberal  pin money, or four or five domestic servants and a drawing-room well  furnished with works of art and costly decorations. They must give state  dinners and three or four routs every season; and in all other matters  their mode of life must be, or seem to be, that of the upper ten  thousand. Either they must live in this style, or be pushed aside and  forgotten. The choice for them lies between very expensive society or  none at all--that is to say, none at all amongst the rising members of  the legal profession, and the sort of people with whom young barristers,  from prudential motives, wish to form acquaintance. Doubtless many a  fair reader of this page is already smiling at the writer's simplicity,  and is saying to herself, \"Here is one of the advocates of marriage on  three hundred a year.\"    But this writer is not going to advocate marriage on that or any other  particular sum. From personal experience he knows what comfort a married  man may have for an outlay of three or four hundred per annum; and from  personal observation he knows what privations and ignominious poverty  are endured by unmarried men who spend twice the larger of those sums  on chamber-and-club life. He knows that there are men who shiver at the  bare thought of losing caste by marriage with a portionless girl, whilst  they are complacently leading the life which, in nine cases out of ten,  terminates in the worst form of social degradation--matrimony where the  husband blushes for his wife's early history, and dares not tell his own  children the date of his marriage certificate. If it were his pleasure  he could speak sad truths about the bachelor of modest income, who is  rich enough to keep his name on the books of two fashionable clubs, to  live in a good quarter of London, and to visit annually continental  capitals, but far too poor to think of incurring the responsibilities of  marriage. It could be demonstrated that in a great majority of instances  this wary, prudent, selfish gentleman, instead of being the social  success which many simple people believe him, is a signal and most  miserable failure; that instead of pursuing a career of various  enjoyments and keen excitements, he is a martyr to _ennui_, bored by the  monotony of an objectless existence, utterly weary of the splendid  clubs, in which he is presumed by unsophisticated admirers to find an  ample compensation for want of household comfort and domestic affection:  that as soon as he has numbered forty years, he finds the roll of his  friends and cordial acquaintances diminish, and is compelled to retire  before younger men, who snatch from his grasp the prizes of social  rivalry; and that, as each succeeding lustre passes, he finds the chain  of his secret disappointments and embarrassments more galling and heavy.    It is not a question of marriage on three hundred a year without  prospects, but a marriage on five or six hundred a year with good  expectations. In the Inns of Court there are, at the present time,  scores of clever, industrious fine-hearted gentlemen who have sure  incomes of three or four hundred pounds per annum. In Tyburnia and  Kensington there is an equal number of young gentlewomen with incomes  varying between L150 and L300 a year. These men and women see each other  at balls and dinners, in the parks and at theatres; the ladies would not  dislike to be wives, the men are longing to be husbands. But that  hideous tyrant, social opinion, bids them avoid marriage.    In Lord Eldon's time the case was otherwise. Society saw nothing  singular or reprehensible in his conduct when he brought Bessie to live  in the little house in Cursitor Street. No one sneered at the young  law-student, whose home was a little den in a dingy thoroughfare. At a  later date, the rising junior, whose wife lived over his business  chambers in Carey Street, was the object of no unkind criticism because  his domestic arrangements were inexpensive, and almost frugal. Had his  success been tardy instead of quick and decisive, and had circumstances  compelled him to live under the shadow of Lincoln's Inn wall for thirty  years on a narrow income, he would not on that account have suffered  from a single disparaging criticism. Amongst his neighbors in adjacent  streets, and within the boundaries of his Inn, he would have found  society for himself and wife, and playmates for his children. Good  fortune coming in full strong flood, he was not compelled to greatly  change his plan of existence. Even in those days, when costly  ostentation characterized aristocratic society--he was permitted to live  modestly--and lay the foundation of that great property which he  transmitted to his ennobled descendants.    When satire has done its worst with the miserly propensities of the  great lawyer and his wife, their long familiar intercourse exhibits a  wealth of fine human affection and genuine poetry which sarcasm cannot  touch. Often as he had occasion to regret Lady Eldon's peculiarities--the  stinginess which made her grudge the money paid for a fish or a basket of  fruit; the nervous repugnance to society, which greatly diminished his  popularity; and the taste for solitude and silence which marked her  painfully towards the close of her life--the Chancellor never even hinted  to her his dissatisfaction. When their eldest daughter, following her  mother's example, married without the permission of her parents, it was  suggested to Lord Eldon that her ladyship ought to take better care of  her younger daughter, Lady Frances, and entering society should play the  part of a vigilant _chaperon_. The counsel was judicious; but the  Chancellor declined to act upon it, saying,--\"When she was young and  beautiful, she gave up everything for me. What she is, I have made her;  and I cannot now bring myself to compel her inclinations. Our marriage  prevented her mixing in society when it afforded her pleasure; it  appears to give pain now,"]]]
