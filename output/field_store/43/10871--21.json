It so happened that the first trap I came to was a trap set in a  spring run, and it had a 'coon in it. I allowed Pont to help kill the  'coon, and after the 'coon was dead, I patted Pont and told him what  great things he had done in capturing the 'coon. Pont showed what  pride he took in the hunt, so much so that he did not like to have Am  go near the pelt. I saw from the very first day out that all that  Pont needed was kind treatment and proper training to make a good  help on the trap line.    I was careful to let him know what I was doing when setting a trap,  and when he would go to smell at the bait after a trap had been set,  I would speak to him in a firm voice and let him know that I did not  approve of what he was doing. When making blind sets, I took the same  pains to show and give him to understand what I was doing. I would  sometimes, after giving him fair warning, let him put his foot into a  trap. I would scold him in a moderate manner and release him. Then  all the time I was resetting the trap I would talk trap to him, and  by action and word teach him the nature of the trap. Mr. Trapper,  please do not persuade yourself to believe that the intelligent dog  cannot understand if you go about it right.    In two weeks Pont had advanced so far in his training that I no  longer had to pay any attention to him on account of the traps. The  third day Pont was with me he found a 'coon that had escaped with a  trap nearly two weeks before. My route called me up a little draw  from the main stream. I had not gone far up this when Pont took the  trail of some animal and began working it up the side of the hill. I  stood and watched him until the trail took him to an old log, when  Pont began to sniff at a hole in the log. He soon raised his head and  gave a long howl, as much as to say he is here and I want help. After  running a stick in the hole I soon discovered that the log was  hollow. I took my belt axe and pounded along on the log until I  thought I was at the right point and then chopped a hole in the log,  and as good luck would have it, I made the opening right on to the  'coon, and almost the first thing I saw on looking into the log was  the trap. Pont soon had the 'coon out, and when I saw it was the  'coon that had escaped with our trap, I gave Pont praise for what he  had done, petting him and telling him of his good deed, and he seemed  to understand it all.    Not long after this Am came into camp at night and reported that a  fox had broken the chain on a certain trap and gone off with the  trap, saying that he would take Pont in the morning and see if he  could find the fox. In the morning when we were ready to go Am tried  to have Pont follow him, but it was no go, Pont would not go with  him. Then Am put a rope on to him and tried to lead him, but Pont  would sulk and would not be led. Then Am lost his temper and wanted  to break Pont's neck again. I said that I did not like to have Pont  abused and that I would go along with him. When we came to the place  where the fox had escaped with the trap Am at once began to slap his  hands and hiss Pont on. Pont only crouched behind me for protection.  I persuaded Am to go on down the run and look at the traps down that  way while I and Pont would look after the escaped fox.    As soon as Am was gone I began to look about where the fox had been  caught and search for his trail, and soon Pont began to wag his tail.  I merely worked Pont's way and said, \"Has he gone that way?\" Pont  gave me to understand that the fox had gone that way and that he knew  what was wanted. The trail soon left the main hollow and took up a  little draft. A little way up this we found where the fox had been  fast in some bushes but had freed himself and left and gone up the  hillside. Pont soon began to get uneasy, and when I said hunt him out  Pont, away he went and in a few minutes I heard Pont give a long howl  and I knew that he had holed his game. When I came up to Pont he was  working in a hole in some shell rocks. I pulled away some loose rocks  and could see the fox, and we soon had him out, and Pont seemed more  pleased over the hunt than I was. There was scarcely a week that Pont  did not help us out on the trap line.    Not unfrequently did Pont show me a 'coon den. I had some difficulty  in teaching Pont to let the porcupines alone, but after a time he  learned that they were not the kind of game that he wanted, and he  paid no more attention to them.    I have had many different dogs on the trap line with me, and I can  say to any one who can understand dog's language, has a liking for a  dog and has a reasonable amount of patience and is willing to use it,  will find a well trained dog of much benefit on the trap line, and  often a more genial companion than some partners one may fall in  with. But if one is so constituted that he must give his dog a growl  or a kick every time he comes in reach, and perhaps only give his dog  half enough to eat and cannot treat a dog as a friend, then I say,  leave the dog off the trap line.      [Illustration: A Group of Typical Sledge Dogs.]        CHAPTER XIX.    SLEDGE DOGS OF THE NORTH.    Not a hunting dog in a strict sense of the word, yet most important  in that connection, is the sledge dog, in transportation of hunters  and their outfits to and from the hunting and trapping scenes.    Following is a first hand, specially written article by Colonel F. H.  Buzzacott, the intrepid Arctic explorer. That he writes from  experience is evident, which necessarily adds interest and value to  his highly interesting contribution.    What the Indian pony is to the plain Indian, the Pack Horse or Mule  is to the White Settler, Hunter or Trapper, the Sledge Dog or  Reindeer is to natives of the distant and Far North. An old saying  among frontiersmen is that a white man will abandon a horse as broken  down and utterly unable to go when a Mexican will take that same  horse and make him go a hundred miles further, while an Indian after  all of this will mount and ride him for a week still.    With all Indians, natives of the north or Esquimaux, knives are  luxuries, ponies and dogs, necessities. Yet, for all that, they are  never stabled, curried, washed, blanketed, shod, seldom protected or  even fed. When the icy cold wintry blasts sweep the drifting snows  over plain and valley and buries under his white mantle his food he  either digs for it, finds and eats what he can, or starves.    In my plains experience with the Indians or in the Polar Regions with  the natives of the north or Esquimaux, I have observed that the love  of an Indian for his ponies, an Esquimaux for his dogs or Laplander  for his reindeer consists in seeing how much he really can get out of  them with the least trouble or effort to him.    I have seen the Indians or natives of the northwest and the Esquimaux  of Hudson's and Baffin's Bay, Greenland, etc., drive half starved  dogs to the sledge until they fell or froze, only to be eaten by  their masters or mates, whom for a lifetime they had pulled with or  served faithfully. Necessity recognizes no law--man is but an animal  himself--and in the struggle for life or gain it is everywhere but  the \"Survival of the Fittest\" or strongest and passing of the weak,  be it white man or Indian.    The best of the \"Sledge Dogs of the North\" are to be found in  Greenland or Siberia, \"Samoyed\" dogs or its Esquimaux cousin, the  \"Immit Dog\", used by explorers and Esquimaux generally. Those with  short, thick hair, medium build, size and full breed are considered  the best for all around work. They will exist and work well on one  pound of food per day, or a big feast once a week. Their food  consists mostly of dried and fresh fish, carrion or fresh, or, if  with explorers, dog biscuit added.    They closely resemble a wolf and howl like one. Are of various colors  and sizes, iron grey predominating. They average about two feet four  inches in height by three feet six inches in length, of unusually  light weight for their size, owing to the bristle out appearance of  their hair which adds to their real size. As a rule females are  killed at birth, except those few to suffice for breeding. Commence  training at six months to a year old and when two or three years old  and seasoned to work are considered prime and preferable for long  heavy distant sledging and hunting.    The best trained of the team (eight, twelve or more in number) is  selected as a leader. They are guided by voice and whip, a loud  \"Brr-Brr\" taking the place of our \"Gee\" in starting and the word  \"Sass-Sass\" used as \"Whoa.\" \"Hi\" and \"He\" for right and left, \"Ho\" to  correct, or speed, as they are trained, of course. A good leader  possesses the quality of rarely failing to lead one safely over any  route once traveled by them, bringing you safely to the place even if  buried under the snow.    They eat each other's flesh wolf-like with gusto and will tear their  fellows to pieces in fight or injury, unless beaten, torn apart or  separated by a man of whom they are afraid. They hate water in winter  as much as they love it in summer when they frequent the salmon  streams and support themselves by fishing, pounce upon nearing fish  of any size that approach them, much as does the bear, two of them  even tackling an immensely big fish and fighting to secure and bring  it to shore. As bear, muskox, or reindeer, dogs, a pack of them will  invariably round up, hold or drive anything sighted within reasonable  distance so long as the hunters will follow on, needing but little  urging, as they realize the prospect of a \"good big feast,\" hence get  busy to the end; younger dogs often paying the penalty with their  lives but seldom older ones.    As a rule, rawhide or seal harness is used in the far north, Alaska  and Greenland and by the Esquimaux but with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3434"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#17)"],[1,"Sura, to have originated at Medina.    9 Ex spermate cum seminatum fuerit.    10 The Dog-star, worshipped by the Arabians.    11 Compare the refrain in Sura lv. p. 74.

Fain would the wicked redeem himself from  punishment on that day at the price of his children,    Of his spouse and his brother,    And of his kindred who shewed affection for him,    And of all who are on the earth that then it might deliver him.    But no. For the fire,    Dragging by the scalp,    Shall claim him who turned his back and went away,    And amassed and hoarded.    Man truly is by creation hasty;    When evil befalleth him, impatient;    But when good falleth to his lot, tenacious.    Not so the prayerful,    Who are ever constant at their prayers;    And of whose substance there is a due and stated portion    For him who asketh, and for him who is ashamed3 to beg;    And who own the judgment-day a truth,    And who thrill with dread at the chastisement of their Lord    For there is none safe from the chastisement of their Lord    And who control their desires,    (Save with their wives or the slaves whom their right hands have won, for  there they shall be blameless;    But whoever indulge their desires beyond this are transgressors);    And who are true to their trusts and their engagements,    And who witness uprightly,    And who keep strictly the hours of prayer:    These shall dwell, laden with honours, amid gardens.    But what hath come to the unbelievers that they run at full stretch around  thee,    On the right hand and on the left, in bands?    Is it that every man of them would fain enter that garden of delights?    Not at all. We have created them, they know of what.    It needs not that I swear by the Lord of the East and of the West4 that we  have power.    To replace them with better than themselves: neither are we to be hindered.    Wherefore let them flounder on and disport them, till they come face to face  with their threatened day,    The day on which they shall flock up out of their graves in haste like men  who rally to a standard:    Their eyes downcast; disgrace shall cover them.
