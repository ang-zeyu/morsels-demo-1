According to  my plans, a large party of picked natives would accompany me to land's  end and somewhat beyond on the Polar sea when I started for my dash in  the coming spring. As spring is the best hunting season, it was  therefore imperative to secure sufficient advance provisions for the  families of these men in addition to preparing requisites for my  expedition. So the early days of the winter would have to be busily  occupied by the men in a ceaseless hunt for game, and later, even when  the darkness had fully fallen, the moonlight days and nights would thus  have to be utilized also.    In the Polar cycle of the seasons there are peculiar conditions which  apply to circumstances and movements. As the word, seasons, is  ordinarily understood, there are but two, a winter season and a summer  season--a winter season of nine months and a summer of three months.    But, for more convenient division of the yearly periods, it is best to  retain the usual cycle of four seasons. Eskimos call the winter  \"ookiah,\" which also means year, and the summer \"onsah.\" Days are  \"sleeps.\" The months are moons, and the periods are named in accord with  the movements of various creatures of the chase.    In early September at Annoatok the sun dips considerably under the  northern horizon. There is no night. At sunset and at sunrise storm  clouds hide the bursts of color which are the glory of twilight, and the  electric afterglow is generally lost in a dull gray.    The gloom of the coming winter night now thickens. The splendor of the  summer day has gone. A day of six months and a night of six months is  often ascribed to the Polar regions as a whole, but this is only true of  a very small area about the Pole.    As we come south, the sun slips under the horizon for an ever-increasing  part of each twenty-four hours. Preceding and following the night, as we  come from the Pole, there is a period of day and night which lengthens  with the descent of latitude.    It is this period which enables us to retain the names of the usual  seasons--summer for the double days, fall for the period of the setting  sun. This season begins when the sun first dips under the ice at  midnight for a few moments. These moments increase rapidly, yet one  hardly appreciates that the sun is departing until day and night are of  equal length, for the night remains light, though not cheerful. Then the  day rapidly shortens and darkens, and the sun sinks until at last there  is but a mere glimmer of the glory of day. Winter is limited to the  long night, and spring applies to the days of the rising sun, a period  corresponding to the autumn days of the setting sun.    At Annoatok the midnight sun is first seen on April 23. It dips in the  sea on August 19. It thus encircles the horizon, giving summer and  continuous day for one hundred and eighteen days. It sets at midday on  October 24, and is absent a period of prolonged night corresponding to  the day, and it rises on February 19. The Arctic air, with its low  temperature and its charge of frosted humidity, so distorts the sun's  rays that when low it is frequently lifted one or two diameters;  therefore, the exact day or hour for sunrise or sunset does not  correspond to mathematical calculations. Then follow days of spring.    In the fall, when the harmonizing influence of the sun is withdrawn,  there begins a battle of the elements which continues until stilled by  the hopeless frost of early night.    At this time, although field work was painful, the needs of our venture  forced us to persistent action in the chase of walrus, seal, narwhal and  white whale. We thus harvested food and fuel.    Before winter ice spread over the sea, ptarmigan, hare and reindeer were  sought on land to supply the table during the long night with  delicacies, while bear and fox pleased the palates of the Eskimos, and  their pelts clothed all.    Many long journeys were undertaken to secure an important supply of  grass to pad boots and mittens and also to secure moss, which serves as  wick for the Eskimo lamp. During the months of September and October,  along the entire Greenland coast, the Eskimos were engaged in a feverish  quest for reserve supplies. Shortly after my arrival, word had been  carried from village to village that I was at Annoatok, and, intending  to make a dash for the \"Big Nail,\" desired the help of the entire tribe.  Intense and spontaneous activity followed. Knowing the demands of the  North, and of such work as I planned, the natives, without specific  instructions from me and with only a brief outline of the planned Polar  campaign which was sent from village to village, immediately got busy  gathering the needed things. They knew better than I where to go for  certain game, and where certain desirable things were obtainable. This  relieved me of a great responsibility. Each local group of natives was  to perform some important duty, suited to its available resources, in  gathering the tremendous amount of material required for our trip. Each  village had its peculiar game advantages.    In some places foxes and hares, the skins of which were necessary for  coats and stockings, were abundant, and the Eskimos must not only gather  the greatest number possible, but prepare the skins and make them into  properly fitting garments. In other places reindeer were plentiful. The  skin of these was needed for sleeping bags, while the sinew was required  for thread. In still other places seal was the luck of the chase; its  skin was one of our most important needs. Of it boots were made, and an  immense amount of line and lashings prepared.    Thus, in one way or another, every man and woman and most of the  children of this tribe of two hundred and fifty people were kept busy in  the service of the expedition. The work was well done, and with much  better knowledge of the fitness of things than could have been possessed  by any possible gathering of alien white men.    The quest of the walrus and the narwhal came in our own immediate plan  of adventure, although the narwhal, called by whale fishers the unicorn,  does not often come under the eye of the white man. It afforded for a  brief spell good results in sport and useful material. Its blubber is  the pride of every housekeeper, for it gives a long, hot flame to the  lamp, with no smoke to spot the igloo finery. The skin is regarded as  quite a delicacy. Cut into squares, it looks and tastes like scallops,  with only a slight aroma of train oil. The meat dries easily, and is  thus prized as an appetizer or as a lunch to be eaten en route in sled  or kayak. In this shape it was an extremely useful thing for us, for it  took the place of pemmican on our less urgent journeys.    Narwhals played in schools, far off shore, and usually along the edges  of some large ice field, their long ivory tusks rising under spouts of  breath and spray. Whenever this glad sight was noted, every kayak about  camp was manned, and the skin canoes went flittering like birds over the  water. Some of the Eskimos climbed to the ice fields and delivered their  harpoons from a secure footing. Others hid behind floating fragments of  heavy ice and made a sudden rush as the animals passed. Still others  came up in the rear, for the narwhal cannot easily see backward, and  does not often turn to watch its enemies, its speed being so fast that  it can easily keep ahead of them.    In these exciting hunts I participated with eager delight, and by proxy  mentally engaged in every encounter. For, in this sea game, existed  food supplies which, instead of entirely confining myself to pemmican, I  planned also to use on my Polar journey. As the skin boats, like bugs,  sped over the water, I felt the movement of them surge in my brain; with  the upraising of each swift-darting native's arm I felt, as it were, my  heart stop with bated suspense. With every failure I experienced a throb  of dismay. With the hauling in of each slimy beast I felt, as it were,  nearer my goal.    Narwhal hunting, in itself, and without the added spur of personal  interest, which I had, is brimful of thrilling sport. The harpoon is  always delivered at close range. Whenever the dragging float marks the  end of the line in tow of the frightened creature, the line of skin  canoes follows. Timid by nature and fearing to rise for breath, the  narwhal plunges along until nearly strangled. When he does come up,  there are likely to be several Eskimos near with drawn lances, which  inflict deep gashes.    Again the narwhal plunges deep down, with but one breath, and hurries  along as best it can. But its speed slackens and a line of crimson marks  its hidden path. Loss of blood and want of air do not give it a chance  to fight. Again it comes up with a spout. Again the lances are hurled.    The battle continues for several hours, with many exciting adventures,  but in the end the narwhal always succumbs, offering a prize of several  thousands of pounds of meat and blubber. Victory as a rule is not gained  until the hunters are far from home, and also far from the shore line.  But the Eskimo is a courageous hunter and an intelligent seaman.    To the huge carcass frail kayaks are hitched in a long line. Towing is  slow, wind and sea combining to make the task difficult and dangerous.  One sees nothing of the narwhal and very little of the kayak, for  dashing seas wash over the little craft, but the double-bladed paddles  see-saw with the regularity of a pendulum. Homecoming takes many hours  and demands a prodigious amount of hard work, but there is energy to  spare, for a wealth of meat and fat is the culmination of all Eskimo  ambition.    Seven of these ponderous animals were brought in during five days,  making a heap of more than forty thousand pounds of food and fuel. The  sight of this tremulous, blubbering mass filled my heart"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36974"],[0,"Old Trails on the Niagara Frontier (#17)"],[1,"as much noted for enormity and crime, as for any       good ever derived from it by the nation in occupation.... During       the American Revolution it was the headquarters of all that was       barbarous, unrelenting and cruel. There, were congregated the       leaders and chiefs of those bands of murderers and miscreants, that       carried death and destruction into the remote American settlements.       There, civilized Europe revelled with savage America; and ladies of       education and refinement mingled in the society of those whose       only distinction was to wield the bloody tomahawk and       scalping-knife. There, the squaws of the forest were raised to       eminence, and the most unholy unions between them and officers of       the highest rank, smiled upon and countenanced. There, in their       strong hold, like a nest of vultures, securely, for seven years,       they sallied forth and preyed upon the distant settlements of the       Mohawks and Susquehannahs. It was the depot of their plunder; there       they planned their forays, and there they returned to feast, until       the hour of action came again.[18]    This striking passage, which the worthy author did not substantiate by a  single fact, may stand as the present text. I have undertaken to trace  some of the flights of the birds of prey from this nest, and to bring  together the details relating to the captives who were brought hither.  From many sources I have traced out the narratives of thirty-two persons  who were brought to Fort Niagara captive by the Indians, during the  years 1778 to 1783. Among them is my boy hero Davy Ogden, whose  adventures I undertake to tell with some minuteness. Just how many  American prisoners were brought into Fort Niagara during this period I  am unable to say, though it is possible that from the official  correspondence of the time figures could be had on which a very close  estimate could be based. My examination of the subject warrants the  assertion that several hundred were brought in by the war parties under  Indian, British and Tory leaders. In this correspondence, very little of  which has ever been published, one may find such entries as the  following:    Guy Johnson wrote from Fort Niagara, June 30, 1781:         In my last letter of the 24th inst. I had just time to enclose a       copy of Lieut. Nelles's letter with an account of his success,       since which he arrived at this place with more particular       information by which I find that he killed thirteen and took seven       (the Indians not having reckoned two of the persons whom they left       unscalped)....    Again:         I have the honor to transmit to Your Excellency a general letter       containing the state of the garrison and of my Department to the       1st inst., and a return, at the foot, of the war parties that have       been on service this year, ... by which it will appear that they       have killed and taken during the season already 150 persons,       including those last brought in....    Again he reports, August 30, 1781:         The party with Capt. Caldwell and some of the Indians with Capt.       Lottridge are returning, having destroyed several settlements in       Ulster County, and about 100 of the Indians are gone against other       parts of the frontiers, and I have some large parties under good       leaders still on service as well as scouts towards Fort Pitt....    Not only are there many returns of this sort, but also tabulated  statements, giving the number of prisoners sent down from Fort Niagara  to Montreal on given dates, with their names, ages, names of their  captors, and the places where they were taken. There were many shipments  during the summer of '83, and the latest return of this sort which I  have found in the archives is dated August 1st of that year, when eleven  prisoners were sent from the fort to Montreal. It was probably not far  from this time that the last American prisoner of the Revolution was  released from Fort Niagara. But let the reader beware of forming hasty  conclusions as to the cruelty or brutality of the British at Fort  Niagara. In the first place, remember that harshness or kindness in the  treatment of the helpless depends in good degree--and always has  depended--upon the temperament and mood of the individual custodian.  There were those in command at Fort Niagara who appear to have been  capable of almost any iniquity. Others gave frequent and conspicuous  proofs of their humanity. Remember, secondly, that the prisoners  primarily belonged to the Indians who captured them. The Indian custom  of adoption--the taking into the family circle of a prisoner in place of  a son or husband who had been killed by the enemy--was an Iroquois  custom, dating back much further than their acquaintance with the  English. Many of the Americans who were detained in this fashion by  their Indian captors, probably never were given over to the British.  Some, as we know, like Mary Jemison, the White Woman of the Genesee,  adopted the Indian mode of life and refused to leave it. Others died in  captivity, some escaped. Horatio Jones and Jasper Parrish were first  prisoners, then utilized as interpreters, but remained among the  Indians.[19] And in many cases, especially of women and children, we  know that they were got away from the Indians by the British officers at  Fort Niagara, only after considerable trouble and expense. In these  cases the British were the real benefactors of the Americans, and the  kindness in the act cannot always be put aside on the mere ground of  military exchange, prisoner for prisoner. Gen. Haldimand is quoted to  the effect that he \"does not intend to enter into an exchange of  prisoners, but he will not add to the distresses attending the present  war, by detaining helpless women and children from their families.\"[20]    I have spoken of Mrs. Campbell, who was held some months at Kanadasaga.  The letter just cited further illustrates the point I would make:         A former application had been made in behalf of Col. Campbell to       procure the exchange of his family for that of Col. Butler, and the       officer commanding the upper posts collected Mr. Campbell's and the       family of a Mr. Moore, and procured their release from the Indians       upon the above mentioned condition with infinite trouble and a very       heavy expense. They are now at Fort Niagara where the best care       that circumstances will admit of, is taken of them, and I am to       acquaint you that Mrs. Campbell & any other women or children that       shall be specified shall be safely conducted to Fort Schuyler, or       to any other place that shall be thought most convenient, provided       Mrs. Butler & her family consisting of a like number shall in the       same manner have safe conduct to my advance post upon Lake       Champlain in order that she may cross the lake before the ice       breaks up.    The official correspondence carried on during the years 1779 to '83,  between Gen. Haldimand and the commanding officers at Fort Niagara shows  in more than one instance that American prisoners were a burden and a  trouble at that post. Sometimes, as in the case of Mrs. Campbell, who  was finally exchanged for Mrs. Butler and her children, they were  detained as hostages. More often, they were received from the Indians in  exchange for presents, the British being obliged to humor the Indians  and thus retain their invaluable services. Thus, under date of Oct. 2,  1779, we find Col. Bolton writing from Fort Niagara to Gen. Haldimand:  \"I should be glad to know what to do with the prisoners sent here by  Capt. Lernault. Some of them I forwarded to Carleton Island, and Maj.  Nairne has applied for leave to send them to Montreal. I have also many  here belonging to the Indians, who have not as yet agreed to deliver  them up.\"[21]    I could multiply at great length these citations from the official  correspondence, but enough has been given to show that the wholesale  condemnation of the British, into whose hands American prisoners fell,  is not warranted by the facts. But there is no plainer fact in it all  than that the British organized and aided the Indian raids, and were,  therefore, joint culprits in general.    And this brings us to the subject of scalps. For many years Fort Niagara  was called a scalp-market. The statement is frequent in early writers  that the British officers offered about eight dollars for every  American's scalp, and that it was this offer, more than anything else,  which fired the Indians to their most horrible deeds. Many scalps were  brought into Fort Niagara, but I have failed, as yet, to find any  report, or figure, or allusion, in the British archives pointing to the  payment of anything whatever. Further search may discover something to  settle this not unimportant matter; for we may readily believe that if  such payments were made the matter would be passed over as unobtrusively  as possible, especially in the reports to the Ministry. The facts appear  to be that warriors who brought scalps into Fort Niagara gave them to  the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, or his deputy, and then received  presents from him. Probably these presents were proportioned to the  success on the warpath.    These facts and reflections are offered to assist the reader's ready  understanding and imagination in following in detail the adventures of  one out of the many prisoners whose paths we have glanced at; for of all  these unfortunate patriots who were thus brought to the \"vultures' nest\"  none has laid hold of my interest and my imagination more strongly than  has David Ogden. He was born in a troublous time, and the hazards of  border life were his sole heritage, save alone a sturdy intrepidity of  character which chiefly commends him to me as the typical hero of all  the heroic souls, men, women, and children, who came through"]]]
