The    government has taken measures to curb violent crime and to spur    economic activity and trade. The economy is bolstered by remittances    from abroad of $400-$600 million annually, mostly from Greece and    Italy; this helps offset the sizable trade deficit. Agriculture,    which accounts for one-half of GDP, is held back because of frequent    drought and the need to modernize equipment and consolidate small    plots of land. Severe energy shortages and antiquated and inadequate    infrastructure make it difficult to attract and sustain foreign    investment. The government plans to boost energy imports to relieve    the shortages and is moving slowly to improve the poor national road    and rail network, a long-standing barrier to sustained economic    growth.

The    transition has proven difficult as successive governments have tried    to deal with high unemployment, widespread corruption, a dilapidated    infrastructure, powerful organized crime networks with links to    government officials, and disruptive political opponents. Albania    has made incremental progress in its democratic development since    first holding multiiparty elections in 1991, but deficiencies remain    - particularly in regard to the rule of law. Despite some lingering    problems, international observers have judged elections to be    largely free and fair since the restoration of political stability    following the collapse of pyramid schemes in 1997. In the 2005    general elections, the Democratic Party and its allies won a    decisive victory on pledges of reducing crime and corruption,    promoting economic growth, and decreasing the size of government.    Although Albania's economy continues to grow, the country is still    one of the poorest in Europe, hampered by a large informal economy,    large public debt, and an inadequate energy and tranportation    infrastructure. Albania has played a largely helpful role in    managing inter-ethnic tensions in southeastern Europe, and is    continuing to work toward joining NATO and the EU.
