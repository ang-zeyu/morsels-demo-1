In the rapid development of the country the steel trap has played a  wonderful part. They have subdued the monster bear and have as well  caught millions of the small fur bearing animals, adding largely to  the annual income of the hardy trapper. Steel traps have been in use  for more than fifty years, but for many years after they were  invented they were so expensive that they were not generally used. Of  late years they have become cheaper and their use has become general.  In fact, the price is now so reasonable that the trapper, on his  first expedition, has a supply. The professional trapper, who in the  North, spends from seven to nine months in the woods has a supply of  these traps, ranging from the smallest to the largest. His needs are  such too that all of them are in use during the trapping season. A  trapper can use from 50 to 250 traps.    Traps are made in various sizes. The smallest No. 0 is used for  gophers, rats, etc., while the largest, No. 6, is for the grizzly  bear and will hold him. The No. 2 is known as the fox trap having two  springs and spread of jaws of 4 7/8 inches. The No. 1 1/2 single  spring is also much used by fox trappers. The No. 1 will also hold  the fox, but we think best to use the No. 1 1/2 or No. 2.    We are alluding to the Newhouse manufactured by the Oneida Community,  Ltd., Oneida, N. Y., as it is acknowledged to be the best trap in the  world.    As most fox trappers devote more or less time to trapping other fur  bearing animals, a description of the various Newhouse traps, telling  the animal or animals each size is adapted to, etc., will no doubt be  of Interest.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 0 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 3 1/2 inches. This, the smallest trap made, is used  mostly for catching the gopher, a little animal which is very  troublesome to western farmers, and also rats and other vermin. It  has a sharp grip and will hold larger game, but should not be  overtaxed.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 1 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 4 inches. This Trap is used for catching muskrats and  other small animals, and sold in greater numbers than any other size.  Its use is well understood by professional trappers and it is the  most serviceable size for catching skunks, weasels, rats and such  other animals as visit poultry houses and barns.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 81 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 4 inches. Occasionally animals free themselves from  traps by gnawing their legs off just below the trap jaws, where the  flesh is numb from pressure. Various forms of traps have been  experimented with to obviate this difficulty. The Webbed Jaws shown  above have proved very successful in this respect.    Noting the cross-section of the jaws, as illustrated at the left, it  is plain the animal can only gnaw off its leg at a point quite a  distance below the meeting edges. The flesh above the point of  amputation and below the jaws will swell and make it impossible to  pull the leg stump out of the trap.    The No. 81 Trap corresponds in size with the regular No. 1 Newhouse.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 91 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws--#91, 5 1/4 inches; #91 1/2, 6 1/4 inches. The double  jaws take an easy and firm grip so high up on the muskrat that he can  not twist out. A skunk cannot gnaw out either.    These traps are especially good for Muskrat, Mink, Skunk and Raccoon.    All parts of the No. 91 except the jaws are the same size as the  regular No. 1 Newhouse, while the 91 1/2 corresponds to the regular  No. 1 1/2.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 1 1/2 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 4 7/8 inches. This size is called the Mink Trap. It  is, however, suitable for catching the Woodchuck, Skunk, etc.  Professional trappers often use it for catching Foxes. It is very  convenient in form and is strong and reliable.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 2 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 4 7/8 inches.  The No. 2 Trap is called the Fox Trap.  Its spread of jaws is the same as the No. 1 1/2 but having two  springs it is, of course, much stronger.     [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 3 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 5 1/2 inches. This, the Otter Trap, is very powerful.  It will hold almost any game smaller than a bear.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 4 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 6 1/2 inches. This is the regular form of Beaver  Trap. It is longer than the No. 3 Trap, and has one inch greater  spread of jaws. It is a favorite with those who trap and hunt for a  living in the Northwest and Canada. It is also extensively used for  trapping the smaller Wolves and Coyotes in the western stock raising  regions.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 2 1/2 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 6 1/2 inches. In some localities the Otter grows to  an unusual size, with great proportionate strength, so that the  manufacturers have been led to produce an especially large and strong  pattern. All the parts are heavier than the No. 2 1/2, the spread of  jaws greater and the spring stiffer.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 3 1/2 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 5 inches. The above cut represents a Single Spring  Otter Trap. It is used more especially for catching Otter on their  \"slides.\" For this purpose a thin, raised plate of steel is adjusted  to the pan so that when the trap is set the plate will be a trifle  higher than the teeth on the jaws. The spring is very powerful, being  the same as used on the No. 4 Newhouse Trap. The raised plate can be  readily detached if desired, making the trap one of general utility.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 21 1/2 TRAP]    Single Spring. Same as No. 2 1/2 but without Teeth or Raised Plate.    No. 31 1/2 NEWHOUSE TRAP.    Single Spring. Same as No. 3 1/2 but without Teeth or Raised Plate.    Spread of Jaws--No. 21 1/2, 5 1/4 inches; No. 31 1/2, 6 1/2 inches.  These Traps are the largest smooth jaw, single spring sizes that are  made. Professional trappers will find these especially valuable when  on a long trapping line, as they are more compact and easier to  secrete than the large double spring traps. The springs are made  extra heavy.    Note.--The 21 1/2 is practically a single spring No. 3 and the 31 1/2  a single spring No. 4.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 14 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 6 1/2 inches. This Trap is the same in size as the  No. 4 Beaver, but has heavier and stiffer springs and offset jaws,  which allow the springs to raise higher when the animal's leg is in  the trap, and is furnished with teeth sufficiently close to prevent  the animal from pulling its foot out.      [Illustration: CLUTCH DETACHABLE TRAP]    Clutch Detachable--Trap can be used with or without it.    PATENTED.    Spread of Jaws, No. 23, 5 1/2 inches; No. 24, 6 1/4 inches. The  inventor of this attachment claims to have had wonderful success with  it in taking Beaver. The trap should be set with the clutch end  farthest from shore. The beaver swims with his fore legs folded back  against his body, and when he feels his breast touch the bank he puts  them down. The position of the trap can be so calculated that he will  put his fore legs in the trap, when the clutch will seize him across  the body and hold him securely.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 4 1/2 TRAP]    In response to a demand for a new model of the Newhouse Trap  especially adapted to catching wolves, the manufacturers have  perfected a trap which is numbered 4 1/2 and is called the \"Newhouse  Wolf Trap.\"    This trap has eight inches spread of jaw, with other parts in  proportion, and is provided with a pronged \"drag,\" a heavy snap and  an extra heavy steel swivel and chain, five feet long, warranted to  hold 2,000 pounds. The trap complete with chain and \"drag\" weighs  about nine pounds.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 50 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 9 inches. This trap is intended for catching small  sized Bears. In design it is exactly like the standard No. 5 Bear  Trap, only that the parts are all somewhat smaller. Weight, 11 1/4  pounds each.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 150 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 9 inches. This trap is identical with No. 5 excepting  that the jaws are offset, making a space five-eighths inch between  them. This allows the springs to come up higher when the bear's foot  is in the trap, and thus secure a better grip. Also there is less  chance of breaking the bones of the foot. Weight, 11 1/4 pounds each.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 5 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 11 3/4 inches. This trap weighs nineteen pounds. It  is used for taking the common Black Bear and is furnished with a very  strong chain.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 15 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 11 3/4 inches. To meet the views of certain hunters  whose judgment is respected, the manufacturers designed a style of  jaw for the No. 5 trap, making an offset of 3/4 of an inch, so as to  allow the springs to come up higher when the bear's leg is in the  trap. This gives the spring a better grip. Those wishing this style  should specify \"No. 15.\"      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 6 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 16 inches. Weight, complete, 42 pounds. This is the  strongest trap made. We have never heard of anything getting out of  it when once caught. It is used to catch lions and tigers, as well as  the great Grizzly Bears of the Rocky Mountains.      [Illustration: BEAR CHAIN CLEVIS AND BOLT]    This cut illustrates Bear Chain Clevis and Bolt, intended as a  substitute for the ring on the end of the trap chain, when desired.    With this clevis a loop can be made around any small log or tree  without the trouble of cutting to fit the ring. The chain is made  five feet long, suitable for any clog, and the prices of bear traps  fitted with it are the same as with the regular short chain and ring.      [Illustration: TRAP SETTING CLAMP]    Every trapper knows how difficult it is to set a large trap alone in  the woods, especially in cold weather, when the fingers are stiff,  and the difficulty is greatly increased when one has to work in a  boat. One of these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34093"],[0,"Mink Trapping: A Book of Instruction Giving Many Methods of Trapping (#17)"],[1,"taken in selecting places to  build deadfalls. If there are dens this is a good place to construct  them. If there are many dens so much the better, but one is all that  is required, for a mink is apt to investigate all and will scent  bait. If you are acquainted with the territory you must know some  places where mink frequent. It seems that the nature and habits of  mink are such that although a mink had never traveled that territory  before it would follow about the same course as others, as tracks in  the mud and snow showed.    To prove this I will mention that some years ago in one deadfall I  caught eight mink in five winters and one in a steel trap, making  nine caught in the five years. This deadfall was built on the bank of  a small stream some 20 feet from the water and near a large sycamore,  under which there was a den, although the trap was some feet from the  entrance to the den.    The first winter one mink was taken; the second two; the third three;  the fourth two; the fifth one.    The fourth winter a few weeks after catching one in the deadfall the  trap was down and the bait gone. The trap was rebaited, but for  several trips I found the trap down and bait eaten. I felt sure that  it was a mink, and although I set the triggers easy--I was using the  two piece trigger and upright spindle--the animal continued to get  the bait.    After a few more visits and the trap down, bait invariably eaten, I  made the pen smaller. The next round I brought a No. 1 Newhouse steel  trap intending to set it if the deadfall was down without making a  catch. Sure enough it was.    For some trips I had been suspecting that the \"bait getter\" was a  small mink. I baited and reset the deadfall as usual. Next a small  place was excavated inside the pen and near the bait, on the deadfall  spindle, the trap placed and carefully covered.      [Illustration: STONE DEADFALLS.]    The next morning I found everything as I had left it the day before,  but the second round I saw that the \"fall\" was down before I got near  and on closer approach saw a mink, a very small one, in the steel  trap.    The mink was small and went inside the pen for the bait. In  constructing deadfalls for mink care must be taken to have the pen  built tight but not too large.    It is best to build deadfalls in advance of the active trapping  season so that the animals may become accustomed to them, and the  trap weather beaten. Chopping and pounding might tend to drive  animals away. In August, September and October is a good time to  build, for if in new territory signs, if any, should be readily seen.    While it is best to construct deadfalls in advance of trapping  season, yet the writer has built deadfalls late in November, set and  baited and found mink in them the next morning. If rightly built ten  or a dozen is all a man can make in a day, and like setting steel  traps, a dozen carefully set for mink are worth a hundred set at  haphazzard.    Mink are great travelers, so that it is needless to set deadfalls  close together. One about every mile is enough unless there should be  many dens and rocky bluffs along the streams, then they could to  advantage be built closer, for other game is liable to be caught. In  this case they should be made a little heavier, as you may catch  opossum, skunk and coon.    Where one stream empties into another is often a good place to  construct a deadfall. If before selecting your places to build a few  trips are taken along the streams it will be a great help. Where  small streams empty into ponds or lakes or the outlets will be found  ideal places for mink.    When deadfalls are built before the trapping season it is well to set  them, having the top of the pen covered, just as though the trap was  baited and ready for business.    Another thing that should be carefully looked after is triggers. Many  cut triggers from green bushes. If this is done, hard wood such as  oak, hickory, dogwood, sugar, beech, etc., is best. The upright  trigger, which is only a straight piece of wood about a half inch  thick, should be slightly rounded so that the spindle will slip off  easier when the animal is at bait.    It is a good idea to prepare a lot of triggers in advance. For  stone deadfalls the figure 4 must be used as the two piece will not  work--going off entirely too hard.    Of course we all admit the steel trap is more convenient and  up-to-date, says a New Hampshire trapper. You can make your sets  faster and can change the steel trap from place to place. Of course  the deadfall you cannot. But all this does not signify the deadfall  is no good; they are good, and when mink trapping is consumed the  deadfall is the trap you want. To the trapper who traps in the same  locality every year, when his deadfalls are once built it is only a  few minutes work to put them in shape, then he has got a trap for the  season.      [Illustration: BOARD OR LOG TRAP.]    I give a diagram of a deadfall (called here Log Trap) which, when  properly made and baited, there is no such a mink catcher in the trap  line that has yet been devised. This trap requires about twenty  minutes time to make, and for tools a camp hatchet and a good, strong  jack-knife, also a piece of strong string, which all trappers carry.  This trap should be about fifteen inches wide with a pen built with  sticks or pieces of boards driven in the ground. (See diagram.) The  jaws of this trap consist of two pieces of board three inches wide  and about three and a half feet long, resting edgeways one on the  other, held firmly by four posts driven in the ground. The top board  or drop should move easily up and down before weights are put on. The  treadle should be set three inches inside, level with the top of  bottom board. This is a round stick about three-fourths inch through  resting against two pegs driven in the ground. (See diagram.) The  lever should be the same size. Now put your stout string around top  board, then set, pass lever through the string over the cross piece  and latch it in front of the treadle, then put on weights and adjust  to spring, heavy or light as desired. This trap should be set around  old dams or log jams by the brook, baited with fish, muskrat, rabbit  or chicken.        CHAPTER XX.    STEEL TRAPS.    For generations there will be good trapping sections in parts of the  North, West and South, so that the hardy trapper will continue to  reap a harvest of pelts and fur.    Mink are widely distributed over America, and while their numbers, in  some sections, have been reduced by the high prices and close  trapping and hunting, they are found much more frequently in the  settled districts than those who give trapping no attention or  thought.    In the rapid development of the country the steel trap has played a  wonderful part. They have subdued the monster bear and hungry wolf,  as well as caught millions of the smaller fur bearing animals, adding  largely to the annual income of the hardy trapper.    Steel traps have been in use for more than fifty years, but for some  time after they were invented they were so expensive that they were  not generally used. Of recent years they have become cheaper and  their use has become general. Trappers will be found using them in  large numbers whether in the Far North for marten, fox, beaver, etc.,  or in the South and Southwest after coon, otter, and smaller fur  bearing animals. Professional trappers use generally from 50 to 300  steel traps, depending upon what game they are after.      [Illustration: A GOOD FASTENING.]    Steel traps are manufactured in various sizes. The smallest, No. 0,  is used for gophers, rats, etc., while the largest, No. 6, is for  grizzly bear, and will hold him. The No. 1 1/2 is known as the Mink  trap. The spread of jaws is 4 7/8 inches. The No. 1 spread of jaws 4  inches is also adapted for mink.    An old and experienced trapper who has spent many years in the  forests of Northern Canada has used the No. 0 with remarkably good  success. There is no doubt but that the smallest size will hold the  mink in the Newhouse brand, and we are alluding to the Newhouse  manufactured by the Oneida Community, Ltd., Oneida, New York, as it  is acknowledged to be the best trap in the world.    The fastening of traps for any animal has much to do with the  trapper's success. Traps fastened to something solid are not so apt  to hold the game. If only caught by a toe or two and the animal jumps  around the toes are apt to be pulled off. Traps should be fastened  far out in the water, when trapping for mink, if the weather is not  so cold that the water is frozen. In that case the fastening should  be to a \"bushy\" bush, or at least to something that will give with  every pull and jerk of the animal.    As many mink trappers devote more or less time to trapping other fur  bearing animals, a description of the various Newhouse traps, telling  the animal or animals each size is adapted to, etc., will no doubt be  of interest.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 0 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 3 1/2 inches. This, the smallest trap made, is used  mostly for catching the gopher, a little animal which is very  troublesome to western farmers, and also rats and other vermin. It  has a sharp grip and will hold larger game, but should not be  overtaxed.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 1 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 4 inches. This Trap is used for catching muskrats and  other small animals, and sold in greater numbers than any other size.  Its use is well understood by professional trappers and it is the  most serviceable size for catching skunks, weasels, rats and such  other animals as visit poultry houses and barns.      [Illustration: NEWHOUSE NO. 81 TRAP]    Spread of Jaws, 4 inches.
