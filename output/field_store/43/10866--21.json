The Lynx family is a branch of the cat tribe and its members are  found in various parts of the world, but it is the European and  Canadian species that are of the most importance, when viewed from  the hunters' and trappers' standpoint. There are two species in North  America, namely, the Canada Lynx and the Bay Lynx or wild cat. The  Canada Lynx is the most valuable and they are most sought by the  trappers. This animal is found throughout practically all of Canada,  Alaska and Newfoundland, also in all of the most northern states and  in the Rocky mountain region extending down into Wyoming and perhaps  still farther south. Those found in Newfoundland and Alaska are of  slightly different varieties.    The Lynx, when full grown will measure about three or three and a  half feet in length and the weight is from twenty to thirty pounds,  but occasional specimens will weigh forty pounds or even more. They  are very \"cat like\" in appearance but the legs are rather long, the  feet large and the tail very short. The feet are heavily furred and  the toes connected with a web, the whole forming a sort of snowshoe,  which prevents the lynx from sinking in the loose snow. The ears are  small and pointed and tipped with a pencil of black hairs. The tail  is also tipped with black. The general color in winter is a silver  grey on the back, shading to white on the under parts. In summer they  take on a reddish color. The fur is long and soft and there is a ruff  of longer fur on the sides of the face, near the throat.    The young are born usually in May and there are from three to seven  in a litter. The entire family will be found living in the same  locality and although each will have its own particular route of  travel, they frequently travel together along the border of certain  swamps and occasionally the entire family will start off together and  look for a better feeding ground. They live mostly in the swampy  parts of the more open country, being rarely found in the great bush.  In the west they are found in the timbered parts of the mountains. In  the North, you will find their tracks leading along the edges of the  swamps and alder or willow thickets.    Their food consists mostly of rabbits and partridge. The snow-shoe  rabbit falls an easy victim. They have been known to kill small deer  and caribou, but only in very rare instances.    There has been considerable controversy among naturalists regarding  the courage of the lynx. From my own observations, I should say that  they are very cowardly, as a rule, but all rules have exceptions. I  know of two instances in which the lynx has stood his ground for a  man, and in one case, for a number of men. This lynx was killed by an  axe thrown by one of the men at a distance of twelve feet.    In traveling, the lynx usually walks, only running when in pursuit of  some animal, and always traveling the same route. They are active all  winter, but travel most in fall and spring. They become prime about  the first of November and if the spring is late, will remain in good  condition until the middle of April.    The European lynx closely resembles the Canadian in habits and  appearance. Its general color is a dull reddish grey, mottled with  black. In winter the fur is longer and lighter colored than in  summer. It is found from the Pryenees to the Far North, and eastward  throughout northern Asia.    As a rule, the lynx is easily taken with the steel trap, unless food  is very plentiful, when they do not care for dead bait. Almost any  trap will hold them as they do not struggle much, and I have caught a  number of them with the No. 1 trap, but because of their large feet,  I would advise the use of a larger trap. The Nos. 3 and 4 traps are  perhaps the best sizes to use.    There are various methods of trapping them but the most common, as  well as the best is to set the trap in an enclosure, with bait. I  prefer to make the enclosures of split wood, placing the split side  inward. I make the pen about three feet in height, about two and a  half feet long, wide at the top and just wide enough to receive the  trap at the bottom. The pen should be well roofed with evergreen  boughs to protect the trap from the snow, and the trap should be just  inside of the entrance. If there is snow on the ground, I make a bed  of green boughs for the trap to rest on. It is not necessary to cover  the trap but I prefer to do so. The bait should be placed on a stick  in the back of the pen.    Rabbit and partridge is the best bait, but it must be fresh, as the  lynx does not care for stale food. Some scent should also be used as  the lynx's sense of smell is not so highly developed as that of some  other animals. Beaver Castor is perhaps the best, but fish oil is  much used by the western trappers. Muskrat musk is also good.    The trap should be fastened to a stout clog. I use a small spruce or  balsam tree, about three inches thick at the butt and fasten the trap  by stapling or by looping the chain around the clog, leaving some  snags to prevent the chain from slipping over the end.    The rabbits are a great nuisance, they being found in great numbers  in the northern swamps. The scent of the hands left there while  setting the trap, also the fresh cutting, attracts the rabbit into  the pen and it is sometimes difficult to keep the trap in working  order until the lynx journeys by that way again. The best way I have  found to keep them out of the trap is by dropping some dead brush in  front of the enclosure, as the rabbits do not like to jump through  the dead brush.    Squirrels and birds are also troublesome, and I have found it a good  idea to place the bait well up under the roof of the pen so as to be  out of sight of these creatures. I also place a small springy stick  under the pan of the trap, which will sometimes prevent the squirrels  and birds from springing it. I sometimes make a trap pen by standing  up a number of small evergreen trees, cutting the boughs away on the  inside. This is a very good method.    When lynx do not take bait well, some trappers make a long pen or  passage, open at both ends and high enough so that the lynx can walk  through easily. The trap is set inside and some beaver castor or  other scent is placed on a stick in the passage. Others put scent on  a piece of red cloth and fix it in a pen of brush, setting the trap  in the entrance.    As the lynx's eye is more keen than its nose, I have found it a good  plan to hang a rabbit skin from a string near the setting, so that it  will swing about in the breeze. This will attract the animal for  quite a distance, and is a good method to use when setting traps  along the shore of a lake, as the lynx walks the ice and will  sometimes pass outside of scenting distance of the trap.    Lynx are easily killed by a blow from a stick but when caught in  small traps it is safer to shoot them, using a small caliber pistol  or rifle. Another good way is to choke them by tieing a snare to the  end of a ten or twelve foot pole. Slip the snare over the animal's  head, draw it tight and hold the pole; the lynx will die in a very  short time. The advantage of this method is in the fact that the skin  is kept clean and free from blood.    The track of the lynx resembles that of the cat but is much larger. A  large specimen will make a track three and a half inches in diameter  and the length of step is from sixteen to eighteen inches.      [Illustration: The Wildcat, or Bay Lynx.]        CHAPTER XVII.    THE BAY LYNX, OR WILD CAT.    The Bay Lynx replaces the Canada Lynx throughout the greater part of  the United States. This animal is known to the fur trade as the wild  cat and is also known in some localities as the Catamount and the  bobcat.    The true wild cat is not found in America, being a native of Europe  and Northern Asia, and resembling the domestic cat, somewhat, in  appearance. Such cats are also found in certain parts of the United  States but they are only the descendants of domestic cats which have  strayed into the woods and become wild, and are not the wild cat of  Europe.    The Bay Lynx is found throughout the rough timbered portions of the  eastern, northern and western States, also in the swamps and cane  brakes of the south. The International Boundary is about the northern  limit of its range. They are quite plentiful in parts of the south,  also in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where they have become  so destructive to sheep that the stockmen pay bounty on those that  are killed.    The animal is somewhat smaller than the Canada Lynx, but resembles  that animal in general appearance. It is about thirty inches in  length, with a tail of five or six inches, and weighs from eighteen  to twenty-five pounds, in some instances exceeding these figures. Its  color on the back and sides is of a pale reddish brown, overlaid with  grayish, the latter color being most prevalent in fall and winter.  The throat is surrounded with a collar of long hair. The under parts  are light colored and spotted and a few dark spots are also found on  the sides. The tail is tipped with black and has half rings on its  upper surface. The ears are also tipped with black hairs, but this  tip is not so conspicuous as in the case of the Canadian Lynx. The  hair is also shorter and coarser, and the feet smaller and less  heavily furred.    The food of this animal consists of rabbits, partridges, sage hens,  and any other small animals and birds which they can capture. They  are fond of poultry and have been known to kill and devour the  raccoon. As before mentioned, they are partial to mutton. In all  probability they capture large numbers of mice, moles, prairie dogs,  etc.    In the West, as in parts of the East the wild cat dens in natural  holes in the rocks. In the swamps of the South they no doubt, nest in  hollow trees.    They are, as a rule, shy and retiring animals, but when brought to  bay"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/341"],[0,"Myths and Legends of the Sioux (#17)"],[1,". They took her body several  miles from camp and rolled it in fine robes and blankets, then they laid  her on a scaffold which they had erected. (This was the custom of burial  among the Indians). They placed four forked posts into the ground and  then lashed strong poles lengthwise and across the ends and made a bed  of willows and stout ash brush. This scaffold was from five to seven  feet from the ground. After the funeral the parents gave away all of  their horses, fine robes and blankets and all of the belongings of  the dead girl. Then they cut their hair off close to their heads, and  attired themselves in the poorest apparel they could secure.    When a year had passed the friends and relatives of the old couple tried  in vain to have them set aside their mourning. \"You have mourned long  enough,\" they would say. \"Put aside your mourning and try and enjoy a  few more pleasures of this life while you live. You are both growing old  and can't live very many more years, so make the best of your time.\" The  old couple would listen to their advice and then shake their heads and  answer: \"We have nothing to live for. Nothing we could join in would be  any amusement to us, since we have lost the light of our lives.\"    So the old couple continued their mourning for their lost idol. Two  years had passed since the death of the beautiful girl, when one evening  a hunter and his wife passed by the scaffold which held the dead girl.  They were on their return trip and were heavily loaded down with game,  and therefore could not travel very fast. About half a mile from the  scaffold a clear spring burst forth from the side of a bank, and from  this trickled a small stream of water, moistening the roots of the  vegetation bordering its banks, and causing a growth of sweet green  grass. At this spring the hunter camped and tethering his horses, at  once set about helping his wife to erect the small tepee which they  carried for convenience in traveling.    When it became quite dark, the hunter's dogs set up a great barking  and growling. \"Look out and see what the dogs are barking at,\" said the  hunter to his wife. She looked out through the door and then drew back  saying: \"There is the figure of a woman advancing from the direction of  the girl's scaffold.\" \"I expect it is the dead girl; let her come,  and don't act as if you were afraid,\" said the hunter. Soon they heard  footsteps advancing and the steps ceased at the door. Looking down at  the lower part of the door the hunter noticed a pair of small moccasins,  and knowing that it was the visitor, said: \"Whoever you are, come in and  have something to eat.\"    At this invitation the figure came slowly in and sat down by the door  with head covered and with a fine robe drawn tightly over the face. The  woman dished up a fine supper and placing it before the visitor, said:  \"Eat, my friend, you must be hungry.\" The figure never moved, nor  would it uncover to eat. \"Let us turn our back towards the door and our  visitor may eat the food,\" said the hunter. So his wife turned her back  towards the visitor and made herself very busy cleaning the small pieces  of meat that were hanging to the back sinews of the deer which had been  killed. (This the Indians use as thread.) The hunter, filling his pipe,  turned away and smoked in silence. Finally the dish was pushed back to  the woman, who took it and after washing it, put it away. The figure  still sat at the door, not a sound coming from it, neither was it  breathing. The hunter at last said: \"Are you the girl that was placed  upon that scaffold two years ago?\" It bowed its head two or three times  in assent. \"Are you going to sleep here tonight; if you are, my wife  will make down a bed for you.\" The figure shook its head. \"Are you going  to come again tomorrow night to us?\" It nodded assent.    For three nights in succession the figure visited the hunter's camp. The  third night the hunter noticed that the figure was breathing. He saw one  of the hands protruding from the robe. The skin was perfectly black and  was stuck fast to the bones of the hand. On seeing this the hunter arose  and going over to his medicine sack which hung on a pole, took down the  sack and, opening it, took out some roots and mixing them with skunk oil  and vermillion, said to the figure:    \"If you will let us rub your face and hands with this medicine it will  put new life into the skin and you will assume your complexion again and  it will put flesh on you.\" The figure assented and the hunter rubbed the  medicine on her hands and face. Then she arose and walked back to the  scaffold. The next day the hunter moved camp towards the home village.  That night he camped within a few miles of the village. When night came,  the dogs, as usual, set up a great barking, and looking out, the wife  saw the girl approaching.    When the girl had entered and sat down, the hunter noticed that the girl  did not keep her robe so closely together over her face. When the wife  gave her something to eat, the girl reached out and took the dish, thus  exposing her hands, which they at once noticed were again natural. After  she had finished her meal, the hunter said: \"Did my medicine help you?\"  She nodded assent. \"Do you want my medicine rubbed all over your body?\"  Again she nodded. \"I will mix enough to rub your entire body, and I will  go outside and let my wife rub it on for you.\" He mixed a good supply  and going out left his wife to rub the girl. When his wife had completed  the task she called to her husband to come in, and when he came in he  sat down and said to the girl: \"Tomorrow we will reach the village. Do  you want to go with us?\" She shook her head. \"Will you come again to our  camp tomorrow night after we have camped in the village?\" She nodded  her head in assent. \"Then do you want to see your parents?\" She nodded  again, and arose and disappeared into the darkness.    Early the next morning the hunter broke camp and traveled far into the  afternoon, when he arrived at the village. He instructed his wife to go  at once and inform the old couple of what had happened. The wife did  so and at sunset the old couple came to the hunter's tepee. They were  invited to enter and a fine supper was served them. Soon after they had  finished their supper the dogs of the camp set up a great barking. \"Now  she is coming, so be brave and you will soon see your lost daughter,\"  said the hunter. Hardly had he finished speaking when she entered the  tent as natural as ever she was in life. Her parents clung to her and  smothered her with kisses.    They wanted her to return home with them, but she would stay with the  hunter who had brought her back to life, and she married him, becoming  his second wife. A short time after taking the girl for his wife, the  hunter joined a war party and never returned, as he was killed on the  battlefield.    A year after her husband's death she married again. This husband was  also killed by a band of enemies whom the warriors were pursuing for  stealing some of their horses. The third husband also met a similar fate  to the first. He was killed on the field of battle.    She was still a handsome woman at the time of the third husband's death,  but never again married, as the men feared her, saying she was holy, and  that any one who married her would be sure to be killed by the enemy.    So she took to doctoring the sick and gained the reputation of being the  most skilled doctor in the nation. She lived to a ripe old age and when  she felt death approaching she had them take her to where she had rested  once before, and crawling to the top of the newly erected scaffold,  wrapped her blankets and robes about her, covered her face carefully,  and fell into that sleep from which there is no more awakening.              THE STORY OF THE PET CRANE    There was once upon a time a man who did not care to live with his tribe  in a crowded village, but preferred a secluded spot in the deep forest,  there to live with his wife and family of five children. The oldest of  the children (a boy) was twelve years of age, and being the son of a  distinguished hunter, soon took to roaming through the forest in search  of small game.    One day during his ramblings, he discovered a crane's nest, with only  one young crane occupying it. No doubt some fox or traveling weasel  had eaten the rest of the crane's brothers and sisters. The boy said to  himself, \"I will take this poor little crane home and will raise him as  a pet for our baby. If I leave him here some hungry fox will be sure to  eat the poor little fellow.\" He carried the young crane home and it grew  to be nearly as tall as the boy's five-year-old sister.    Being brought up in a human circle, it soon grew to understand all the  family said. Although it could not speak it took part in all the games  played by the children. The father of the family was, as I have before  mentioned, a great hunter. He always had a plentiful supply of deer,  antelope, buffalo and beaver meats on hand, but there came a change.  The game migrated to some other locality, where no deadly shot like  \"Kutesan\" (Never Miss) would be around to annihilate their fast  decreasing droves. The hunter started out early one morning in hopes of  discovering some of the game which had disappeared as suddenly as though  the earth had swallowed them. The hunter traveled the whole day, all to  no purpose. It was late in the evening when he staggered into camp. He  was nearly dead with fatigue. Hastily swallowing a cup of cherry bark  tea (the only article of food they had in store), he at once retired  and was soon in the sweet land of dreams. The children soon joined their  father and the poor woman sat thinking how they could save their dear  children from starvation. Suddenly out upon the night air rang the cry  of a crane. Instantly the pet crane awoke, stepped outside and answered  the call. The crane which"]]]
