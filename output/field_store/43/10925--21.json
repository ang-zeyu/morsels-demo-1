The Fine Arts.      Schwanthaler's Bavaria, and the Theresienwiese at Munich.--On the  western side of Munich several streets converge in a plain which is the  arena of the great popular festival that takes place every October.  Around this plain, which is called the Theresienwiese, as well as around  the whole district in which the city is placed, the land rises some  thirty or forty feet. Near the spot where the green waters of the Iser  break through this ridge, King Louis founded the Hall of Fame, which is  to transmit to posterity the busts of renowned natives of the country.  This edifice is in Doric style, and with its two wings forms a  court-yard, opening toward the city. In the center of this court is  placed upon a granite pedestal, thirty feet high, a colossal statue of  bronze, fifty-four feet high, representing Bavaria, to which we have  several times referred in _The International_--our European  correspondence enabling us to anticipate in regard to subjects of  literature and art generally even the best-informed foreign journals.    The Hall of Fame will not be completed for some years, but the statue is  finished, and was first exposed to view on the 9th of October. The  execution of this statue was committed by King Louis to Schwanthaler,  who began by making a model of thirteen feet in height. In order to  carry out the work a wooden house was erected at the royal foundry, and  a skeleton was built by masons, carpenters, and smiths, to sustain the  earth used in the mould for the full-sized model. This was begun in  1838, and ere long the figure stood erect. The subsequent work on the  model occupied two years. The result was greatly praised by the critics,  who wondered at the skill which had been able to give beauty as well as  dignity to a statue of so large dimensions. It holds up a crown of  oak-leaves in the left hand, while the right, resting upon the hip,  grasps an unsheathed sword twined with laurel, beneath which rests a  lion. The breast is covered with a lion's skin which falls as low as the  hips; under it is a simple but admirably managed robe extending to the  feet. The hair is wreathed with oak-leaves, and is disposed in rich  masses about the forehead and temples, giving spirit to the face and  dignity to the form. Such was the model, and such is the now finished  statue. But the subsequent steps in its completion are worthy of a  particular description.    The model was in gypsum, and the first thing done was to take a mould  from it in earth peculiarly prepared for the reception of the melted  metal. The first piece, the head, was cast September 11th, 1844. It  weighs one hundred and twenty hundred-weight, and is five or six feet in  diameter: the remainder was cast at five separate times. When the head  was brought successful out of the mould, King Louis and many of the  magnates of Germany were present. The occasion was in fact a festival,  which Mueller, the inspector of the royal bronze foundry and probably the  first living master of the art of casting in bronze, rendered still more  brilliant by illuminations and garlands of flowers. Vocal music also was  not wanting, as the artists of Munich were present in force, and their  singing is noted throughout Germany. Since last July workmen have been  constantly engaged in transporting the pieces of bronze weighing from  200 to 300 cwt. to the place where the statue was to be erected. For  this purpose a wagon of peculiar construction was used, with from  sixteen to twenty horses to draw it. On the 7th of August the last  piece, the head, was conveyed; it was attended by a festal procession.  The space within the head is so great that some twenty-eight men can  stand together in it. The body, the main portions of which were made in  five castings, weighs from 1300 to 1500 cwt., and has a diameter of  twelve feet; the left arm, which is extended to hold the wreaths, from  125 to 130 cwt.; its diameter is five feet, and the diameter of its  index finger six inches. The nail of the great toe can hardly be covered  with both a man's hands. A door in the pedestal leads to a cast-iron  winding stairway which ascends to the head, within which benches have  been arranged for the comfort of visitors, several of whom can sit there  together with ease. The light enters through openings arranged in the  hair, whence also the eye can enjoy the view of the city and the  surrounding country with the magical Alps in the background. The entire  mass of bronze, weighing about 2600 cwt., was obtained from Turkish  cannon lost in the sea at Navarino and recovered by Greek divers. The  value of the bronze is about sixty thousand dollars. The sitting lion  has a height of near thirty feet. It was cast in three pieces, and  completes the composition in the most felicitous manner.    The statue having been completed, the final removing of the scaffolding  around it and its full exposure to the public took place on the 9th of  October. This was a day of great festivity at Munich and its vicinity. A  platform had been erected directly in front of the statue for the  accommodation of King Maximilian and his suite. The festivities began  with an enormous procession of carriages, led by bands of music and  bearing the representatives of the different industrial and agricultural  trades, with symbols of their respective occupations. As they passed  before the King's platform each carriage stopped, saluted his majesty,  and received a few kindly words in reply. The procession was closed by  the artists of Munich. The carriages took their station in a half circle  around the platform. Soon after, accompanied by the thunder of cannon,  the board walls surrounding the scaffold were gradually lowered to the  ground. The admiration of the statue (which by the way is exactly  fifty-four feet high), was universal and enthusiastic. All beholders  were delighted with the harmony of its parts and the loveliness of its  expression notwithstanding its colossal size. The ceremonies of the day  were closed with speeches and music; the painter Tischlein made a speech  lauding King Louis as the creator of a new era for German art. A very  numerous chorus sung several festive hymns composed for the occasion,  after which the multitude dispersed.           *       *       *       *       *    The Dominican Monastery of San Marco at Florence has for centuries been  regarded"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3788"],[0,"Haydn (#17)"],[1,"tters, English edition, Vol. I., p.  281.]    London Acquaintances    Haydn made many interesting acquaintances during this London visit.  Besides those already mentioned, there was Bartolozzi, the famous  engraver, to whose wife he dedicated three clavier trios and a sonata  in E flat (Op. 78), which, so far unprinted in Germany, is given by  Sterndale Bennett in his Classical Practice. There was also John Hunter,  described by Haydn as \"the greatest and most celebrated chyrurgus in  London,\" who vainly tried to persuade him to have a polypus removed from  his nose. It was Mrs Hunter who wrote the words for most of his English  canzonets, including the charming \"My mother bids me bind my hair.\" And  then there was Mrs Billington, the famous singer, whom Michael Kelly  describes as \"an angel of beauty and the Saint Cecilia of song.\" There  is no more familiar anecdote than that which connects Haydn with Sir  Joshua Reynolds's portrait of this notorious character. Carpani  is responsible for the tale. He says that Haydn one day found Mrs  Billington sitting to Reynolds, who was painting her as St Cecilia  listening to the angels. \"It is like,\" said Haydn, \"but there is a  strange mistake.\" \"What is that?\" asked Reynolds. \"You have painted  her listening to the angels. You ought to have represented the angels  listening to her.\" It is a very pretty story, but it cannot possibly  be true. Reynolds's portrait of Mrs Billington was painted in 1789,  two years before Haydn's arrival, and was actually shown in the Academy  Exhibition of 1790, the last to which Sir Joshua contributed. [The  portrait, a whole length, was sold in 1798 for 325 pounds, 10s., and  again at Christie's, in 1845, for 505 guineas--to an American, as  usual.] Of course Haydn may have made the witty remark here attributed  to him, but it cannot have been at the time of the painting of the  portrait. That he was an enthusiastic admirer of Mrs Billington there  can be no doubt.    Another Romance    There was another intimacy of more import, about which it is necessary  to speak at some length. When Dies published his biography of Haydn  in 1810 he referred to a batch of love-letters written to the composer  during this visit to London. The existence of the letters was known  to Pohl, who devotes a part of his Haydn in London to them, and prints  certain extracts; but the letters themselves do not appear to have been  printed either in the original English or in a German translation until  Mr Henry E. Krehbiel, the well-known American musical critic, gave them  to the world through the columns of the New York Tribune. Mr Krehbiel  was enabled to do this by coming into possession of a transcript of  Haydn's London note-book, with which we will deal presently. Haydn, as  he informs us, had copied all the letters out in full, \"a proceeding  which tells its own story touching his feelings towards the missives and  their fair author.\" He preserved them most carefully among the souvenirs  of his visit, and when Dies asked him about them, he replied: \"They are  letters from an English widow in London who loved me. Though sixty years  old, she was still lovely and amiable, and I should in all likelihood  have married her if I had been single.\" Who was the lady thus  celebrated? In Haydn's note-book the following entry occurs: \"Mistress  Schroeter, No. 6 James Street, Buckingham Gate.\" The inquiry is here  answered: Mistress Schroeter was the lady.    Mistress Schroeter    Haydn, it will be seen, describes her as a widow of sixty. According  to Goldsmith, women and music should never be dated; but in the present  case, there is a not unnatural curiosity to discover the lady's age. Mr  Krehbiel gives good grounds for doubting Haydn's statement that Mistress  Schroeter was sixty when he met her. She had been married to Johann  Samuel Schroeter, an excellent German musician, who settled in London  in 1772. Schroeter died in 1788, three years before the date of Haydn's  visit, when he was just thirty-eight. Now Dr Burney, who must have known  the family, says that Schroeter \"married a young lady of considerable  fortune, who was his scholar, and was in easy circumstances.\" If,  therefore, Mrs Schroeter was sixty years old when Haydn made her  acquaintance, she must have been nineteen years her husband's senior,  and could not very well be described as a \"young\" lady at the time of  her marriage.    It is, however, unnecessary to dwell upon the matter of age. The  interesting point is that Haydn fell under the spell of the charming  widow. There is no account of their first meeting; but it was probably  of a purely professional nature. Towards the end of June 1791 the lady  writes: \"Mrs Schroeter presents her compliments to Mr Haydn, and informs  him she is just returned to town, and will be very happy to see him  whenever it is convenient to him to give her a lesson.\" A woman of sixty  should hardly have been requiring lessons, especially after having been  the wife of a professor who succeeded the \"English Bach\" as music-master  to the Queen. But lessons sometimes cover a good deal of love-making,  and that was clearly the case with Haydn and Mrs Schroeter.    Love Letters    There is indeed some reason to doubt if the lessons were continued. At  any rate, by February 1792, the affair had ripened so far as to allow  the lady to address the composer as \"my dear,\" and disclose her tender  solicitude for his health. On the 7th of the following month she writes  that she was \"extremely sorry\" to part with him so suddenly the previous  night. \"Our conversation was particularly interesting, and I had a  thousand affectionate things to say to you. My heart was and is full  of tenderness for you, but no language can express half the love and  affection I feel for you. You are dearer to me every day of my life.\"    This was pretty warm, considering that Haydn was still in the bonds  of wedlock. We cannot tell how far he reciprocated the feeling, his  letters, if he wrote any, not having been preserved; but it may be  safely inferred that a lady who was to be \"happy to see you both in the  morning and the evening\" did not do all the love-making. On the 4th of  April the composer gets a present of soap, and is the \"ever dear Haydn\"  of the \"invariable and truly affectionate\" Mistress Schroeter. He had  been working too hard about this particular date (he notes that he was  \"bled in London\" on the 17th of March), and on the 12th the \"loveress,\"  to use Marjorie Fleming's term, is \"truly anxious\" about her \"dear  love,\" for whom her regard is \"stronger every day.\" An extract from the  letter of April 19 may be quoted as it stands:    I was extremely sorry to hear this morning that you were indisposed. I  am told you were five hours at your studies yesterday. Indeed, my dear  love, I am afraid it will hurt you. Why should you, who have already  produced so many wonderful and charming compositions, still fatigue  yourself with such close application? I almost tremble for your health.  Let me prevail on you, my much-loved Haydn, not to keep to your studies  so long at one time. My dear love, if you could know how very precious  your welfare is to me, I flatter myself you would endeavour to preserve  it for my sake as well as your own.    Come Early    The next letter shows that Haydn had been deriving some profit from  Mistress Schroeter's affections by setting her to work as an amanuensis.  She has been copying out a march, and is sorry that she has not done it  better. \"If my Haydn would employ me oftener to write music, I hope  I should improve; and I know I should delight in the occupation.\"  Invitations to dine at St James's Street are repeatedly being sent, for  Mistress Schroeter wishes \"to have as much of your company as possible.\"  When others are expected, Haydn is to come early, so that they may  have some time together \"before the rest of our friends come.\" Does the  adored Schroeter go to one of her \"dearest love's\" concerts, she  thanks him a thousand times for the entertainment. \"Where your sweet  compositions and your excellent performance combine,\" she writes, \"it  cannot fail of being the most charming concert; but, apart from that,  the pleasure of seeing you must ever give me infinite satisfaction.\" As  the time drew near for Haydn's departure, \"every moment of your  company is more and more precious to me.\" She begs to assure him with  \"heart-felt affection\" that she will ever consider the acquaintance with  him as one of the chief blessings of her life. Nay, she entertains for  her \"dearest Haydn\" \"the fondest and tenderest affection the human heart  is capable of.\" And so on.    An Innocent Amourette    One feels almost brutally rude in breaking in upon the privacy of  this little romance. No doubt the flirtation was inexcusable enough on  certain grounds. But taking the whole circumstances into account--above  all, the loveless, childless home of the composer--the biographer  is disposed to see in the episode merely that human yearning after  affection and sympathy which had been denied to Haydn where he had most  right to expect them. He admitted that he was apt to be fascinated by  pretty and amiable women, and the woman to whom he had given his name  was neither pretty nor amiable. An ancient philosopher has said that a  man should never marry a plain woman, since his affections would always  be in danger of straying when he met a beauty. This incident in Haydn's  career would seem to support the philosopher's contention. For the rest,  it was probably harmless enough, for there is nothing to show that the  severer codes of morality were infringed.    The biographers of Haydn have not succeeded in discovering how the  Schroeter amourette ended. The letters printed by Mr Krehbiel are all  confined to the year 1792, and mention is nowhere made of any of later  date. When Haydn returned to London in 1794, he occupied rooms at No. 1  Bury Street, St"]]]
