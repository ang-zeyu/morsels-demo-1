The principal avian scavengers in the Windy River area seem  to be the Rough-legged Hawk (_Buteo lagopus sancti-johannis_), the  Herring Gull (_Larus argentatus smithsonianus_), the Canada Jay  (_Perisoreus canadensis canadensis_), and the Raven (_Corvus corax  principalis_). These birds are evidently attracted to the vicinity of  camps and trap-lines by reason of the numbers of caribou bodies lying  about. On their first arrival in late May or early June, before the  lakes have opened up and while food in general is scarce, Herring Gulls  seem particularly prone to assemble where Caribou have been recently  killed. For example, up to June 3 only a handful of these birds had been  seen about Windy River. On that day several Caribou were killed, and on  June 4 about 100 Herring Gulls had gathered at the scene. Their  scavenger activities make it especially necessary to protect the caribou  bodies in the way described in the section on _Relations to man_. In a  few days one of the bodies (apparently not so protected) had been almost  entirely consumed. The Herring Gulls operate locally only from May to  September, being absent during the rest of the year. A few Ring-billed  Gulls (_Larus delawarensis_) appeared meanwhile and attacked a caribou  carcass.    The Rough-legged Hawk is far less numerous than the Herring Gull and so  is a much less serious scavenger. Now and then, however, it may be noted  feeding on a caribou carcass. Even the Long-tailed Jaeger (_Stercorarius  longicaudus_) is reported in such a role. The Canada Jay and the Raven  are permanent residents and are undoubtedly helped through the  inhospitable winter by man-killed Caribou. On the other hand, a good  many Ravens fall victims to the fox traps placed about the bodies.  Charles Schweder has frequently seen Ravens following Wolves, as if in  expectation of a kill. Buchanan remarks (1920: 248) concerning the  Reindeer Lake region, that the Ravens \"appear to remain in the vicinity  of the Caribou herds all th[r]ough winter.\" In the Windy River area the  Canada Jay became noticeably more numerous in August, after the Caribou  had returned from the north. The Ravens and the Rough-legs exhibited a  similar increase in September and October.    The depredations of these carnivorous birds result to the detriment of  the living Caribou in that they virtually force the hunters and trappers  to kill a larger number of the animals than would otherwise be  necessary.      _References._--Hanbury, 1904: 135; Stefánsson, 1913a: 93;    Seton, 1929, +3+: 108; Ingstad, 1933: 157-159; Downes, 1943:    228; Banfield, 1951a: 36, 42; Harper, 1953: 28, 60, 62-64, 72,    74, 76.      _Relations to miscellaneous animals_    The Schweder boys spoke of Arctic Hares (_Lepus arcticus andersoni_)  being in the habit of eating the stomach contents of Caribou after the  animals have been dressed in the field. This represents merely harmless  utilization of a normally waste product, although it serves some of the  natives as _nerrooks_ or \"Eskimo salad\" (_cf._ Richardson, 1829: 245).  Wolverines, Mink, Weasels, and Lemmings help to consume unprotected  caribou bodies. (In the Old World the Wolverine is regarded as a serious  enemy of live Reindeer [Jacobi, 1931: 243; Harper, 1945: 473].)      _References._--Pike, 1917 (1892): 56-58; Seton, 1911: 252, 1929,    +2+: 413, 424, 443, and 1929, +3+: 108; Harper, 1932: 23;    Ingstad, 1933: 157-159; Freuchen, 1935: 93, 99; Hoffman, 1949:    12; Banfield, 1951a: 36, 41; Harper, 1953: 40, 41.      _Relations to flies_    Flies of various kinds perhaps cause more wide-spread, year-round misery  to the Caribou than all other pests and enemies combined. It is safe to  say that not a single individual in the whole population escapes their  attacks, and some even succumb to mosquitoes (Gavin, 1945: 228). The  various biting and parasitic flies have already been discussed to some  extent in the section on _Influence of insects on distribution_.  Harassment by these pests is believed to be the leading cause of the  haste with which the Caribou are frequently seen passing over the  Barrens in summer. Downes (1943: 204) has commented on the habit of  Chipewyan hunters in the Nueltin Lake region of examining the legs of  Caribou for swellings caused by mosquito bites. In a buck secured on  August 17 the legs exhibited numerous little bumps of this sort;  furthermore, black flies covered the buck's body, while scarcely  troubling those of us who were preparing the specimen. Fortunately the  suffering from mosquitoes and black flies on the Barrens is largely  limited to the months of July and August.    Even at this season the Caribou are granted occasional relief from the  blood-sucking flies. The characteristic strong winds of that region help  greatly in keeping the insects in abeyance. Furthermore, both mosquitoes  and black flies become more or less inactive whenever the temperature  drops to the neighborhood of 45° (_cf._ Weber, 1950: 196), and this  happens fairly frequently even in mid-summer. Finally, the black flies  retire during the hours of darkness; and short as these hours are, the  relief they bring is very noteworthy. These conditions offer something  of a contrast to those surrounding the Woodland Caribou. It is difficult  to see how that animal can secure a moment's respite from mosquito  attacks, by day or night, through most of the summer. In its forested  habitat there is not sufficient lowering of the temperature nor  sufficient penetration of strong winds. Hard as the life of the Barren  Ground Caribou may be, it seems to have a few advantages not available  to the Woodland Caribou; and possibly it is these that have enabled it  to attain a vastly greater population than the other species.    Of 52 mosquito specimens brought back from the Windy River area, 39 were  _Aedes nearcticus_ Dyar, 2 were probably _Aedes fitchii_ (F. and Y.),  and the remaining 11 were of the same genus but not in condition for  specific determination (_cf._ Dyar, 1919; Weber, 1950: 196). _Ae.  nearcticus_ is holarctic in distribution; in North America it occurs  chiefly on the Barren Grounds, but is known from as far south as  Montana. _Ae. fitchii_ ranges through the northern United States and  Canada, north to the limit of trees. Of 26 black flies, all were  _Simulium venustum_ Say, which occurs in northern Europe, Alaska, and  Labrador, south to the Adirondacks, Illinois, Iowa, Georgia, and  Alabama. (Names and ranges supplied by Dr. Alan Stone, of the United  States Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine.) These mosquitoes and  black flies were presumably the species attacking the Caribou in the  Nueltin Lake region.    The effects of the two parasitic flies are felt nearly throughout the  year. The adult warble fly (_Oedemagena tarandi_) is seen in the Windy  River area in August, when the Caribou are on their southward march. On  August 22 Fred Schweder, Jr., secured three of them on freshly killed  Caribou and another that alighted on himself--all on an island in Windy  Bay. His name for them is \"deer fly.\" He reported seeing about 50 of  them on this day (more than ever before), although he sighted only 10  Caribou. As he remarked, these fuzzy flies look much like bumblebees.  Three days later, along Little River, something buzzed past me while a  band of Caribou were near. It was probably this species, although it  suggested a hummingbird almost as much as a bumblebee. On several  subsequent August days, while numbers of Caribou were passing very close  to me, I detected no more of the warble flies. In general, they might  well have escaped my notice owing to my preoccupation with photography;  but on August 30, when I looked for them on one of the nearest animals,  I saw none. Evidently they are not sufficiently numerous (like  horse-flies on cattle) to be constantly in attendance on each Caribou.  In fact, a comparative scarcity (or at least difficulty of capture) may  be surmised from the fact that the Canadian Arctic Expedition 1913-18  brought back only three adult females--one from Teller, Alaska, and two  from Bernard Harbour, Dolphin and Union Strait (Malloch, 1919: 55).  Weber (1950) collected no Oestridae in Arctic Alaska.    Apparently there has been scarcely any published study of the egg-laying  or other habits of the adult _Oedemagena_ in relation to _Rangifer  arcticus arcticus_, other than a few recent notes by Banfield (1951a:  31-32, fig. 17); but its behavior in relation to the Lapland Reindeer  seems to be fairly well known, and it is summarized by Jacobi (1931:  245-246)"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33767"],[0,"Campward Ho! A Manual for Girl Scout Camps (#17)"],[1,"not record everything about a  girl. When reviewing the chart or record book before deciding who  deserves the final honors, or merit badges, there are other things to be  taken into account, for instance, the effort and the progress or  improvement and the kind of spirit that went with the material  achievement.          X    HIKES              _Now away we go toward the topmost mountains. Many            still, small voices, as well as the noon thunder,            are calling, \"Come higher!\"_                                                --_John Muir_      Daytime    The daytime hike gives the camper an opportunity to see something of the  surrounding country, and to have the experience of following paths and  trails, of climbing and coming into touch with the deep woods, and all  of their beauties. Also the necessary routine and rules of an organized  camp would prove unbearable to the all-summer hiker if she did not get  away from them once in a while. The very purpose of the camp would be  thwarted. All children are not so constituted or trained that they can  go off and sleep in the woods even for one night, but they should be  encouraged to take hikes varying in length from five to twenty miles  according to the child's ability to endure.    The daytime hikers should leave camp by ten o'clock, each one properly  shod and clothed and for convenience carrying her own luncheon either in  a knapsack or in a little, well-wrapped parcel. She should have her  individual drinking cup, and if the hike is to include a swim in some  far-off lake, a bathing suit and bath towel should be taken. There  should be an objective for these daytime hikes and the paths and roads  should be well known by some member of the party. Two hours is none too  long a time for the noon rest and luncheon and the return trip should be  planned to bring the campers into camp before supper. It is never wise  to start out with a group of girls who cannot keep about the same pace.  Nothing is more fatiguing than exerting oneself to keep up to a pace or  on the other hand to slacken one's pace for the accommodation of the  lagger. There should always be one person in charge of the entire group  and she should have as many assistants as the size of the group  requires. One counsellor to every ten girls is none too many for a  daytime hike. Under no circumstances, even though there were but six  girls, should one counsellor assume the entire responsibility for a  week-end or overnight hike. There should always be at least two older  people. The great opportunity for studying Nature should be taken  advantage of and if possible a nature study teacher should accompany the  girls. All hikers on return to camp should be examined, and any  blisters, bruises, cuts or strains should be reported and properly  attended to. There have been cases where from neglect, a blister on the  foot has become infected, causing serious trouble.    Girl Scouts when hiking along highways should walk in single file on the  left hand side of the way, thus giving them an opportunity to see  approaching vehicles.    There are many interesting signs that can be made by Scouts when hiking,  to mark the trail or note conditions observed. These signs and their  uses are given in the Girl Scout Handbook and should be learned and put  into practice. The use of them develops the powers of observation and  makes for alertness.      Week-End Hike    No child should be permitted to start out on a week-end hike unless her  physical condition is such as to withstand any unexpected weather  conditions which might arise or prolonged exposure in the open. Also she  should be properly clothed; preferably in thin woolen clothes, wearing  as little as possible, yet being comfortable. Her shoes should be stout,  low-heeled and round-toed. She should take with her a sweater, extra  underwear, stockings, nightclothes, toilet articles, and blankets.    Only sufficient food should be taken to last during the time planned  for. This food should be packed in small bags, preferably waterproof.  Two and a quarter pounds for one day's rations is sufficient. Cereal in  some form, many prefer flour in order to make bread, a fat--such as  bacon or butter--rice, for bulk, something to drink, cocoa or tea, a  sweet, preferably chocolate, a small amount of sugar and raisins are  suggested. Eggs can be added to the above; also salt, baking powder,  evaporated milk and dried egg.    Never start for a week-end hike late in the afternoon. Plan to make camp  not later in the day than five o'clock. At once build the campfire and  start to prepare the supper. Select suitable places on the ground for  sleeping. Make sure that the ground is dry, and if possible spread a  poncho under the blankets. A hole dug so that the body will fit into it  and touch the ground at every point makes sleeping more comfortable.  Keep the campfire burning all night, different members of the party, two  at a time, being on guard. Do not have the fire too large. One of the  signs of a tenderfoot woodsman is a big fire for cooking or the night  watch. Not only are they dangerous, but when using them for cooking the  cook as well as the food is apt to be burned. Before building the fire,  scrape all leaves and dried grass from the ground, leaving a foundation  of bare earth. Make sure that every vestige of fire is out upon breaking  camp. Also that no evidences of a camp save the matted grass are left  behind.    In carrying a pack, place the load high on the back and move the body  forward to keep the center of gravity.      Overnight Hike              _... And when the airs is warming, it's then            yourself and me should be pacing ... in the dews            of night, the times sweet smells do be rising, and            you'd see a little shiny new moon, may be, sinking            on the hills._                                              --_J. M. Synge_    The overnight hike is more of a lark than the week-end hike. Its  principal features are sleeping in the open and cooking one's food in  the most primitive manner. The same requirements as for week-end hikes  should obtain as to the number of counsellors and the child's physical  condition. Also she should be properly clothed for the trip as to shoes,  stockings, underclothes, and so forth. The necessary equipment for an  overnight hike such as nightclothes, toilet articles, etc., can be  neatly laid in a blanket and the blanket rolled from end to end. It  should be tied in the center, about four inches from either end and  between the ends and the center with a stout string. Bring the ends  together side by side and tie tightly. Throw the blanket over the head,  the ends under one arm, the center of the blanket on the opposite  shoulder.    The hiker can take more food than is strictly necessary, for as a  general thing she walks only a short distance and can thus carry a quite  heavy pack. The trip should be so planned that the hikers reach their  destination by five o'clock in the afternoon. The following day can be  spent in exploring the surrounding country, finding as many points of  interest as possible, studying the trees, the flowers, the birds, and  following up any trails, paths or streams which look interesting. The  day should be so planned that the return to the main camp will be  accomplished in the late afternoon or early evening.    [Illustration: FIRST AIDES. Several Kinds of Bandages]      Camp Fires    There are various kinds of camp fires that can be made and experimented  with while off on a hike. The log cabin fire, in which two sticks are  laid parallel to each other about nine inches apart, two more laid in  the opposite direction on top of the ends of the first two sticks, the  square made about three sticks high. In the center of this is laid a  small fire of dried leaves and small dried twigs. When the fire is well  started larger twigs should be slowly added until there is a bed of  coals on which can be put short sticks of wood. The cooking utensils can  be stood on the log cabin foundation if it has been made of wood  sufficiently large to withstand the heat of the fire, or they can stand  on a grating placed over the fire. Never cook over a blaze. Wait until  there is a bed of coals.    Another way of building a campfire is to select two large green logs;  place them near together at one end, the other ends 18 inches or more  apart and facing the wind. Build the fire in between the logs. Smooth  off the top of the logs with an axe to form a support for the cooking  utensils.    Where large stones are available make a fireplace by putting two stones  about ten or twelve inches apart at right angles to a large back stone,  or place three stones to form a hollow square, building the fire in the  center. Cooking utensils can be stood on a stone placed over the top of  the fireplace or on a grating placed across the top, or rested on two  iron bars laid on top of the fireplace.    Another fire can be built by placing three medium sized sticks in the  shape of an Indian tepee or wigwam. The sticks must be of about the same  size and placed so carefully that they will not fall into the fire which  is built underneath them. When the dried leaves and twigs have started  to burn well, add a little wood of a larger size, thus gradually  building up the fire. Over the fire three larger sticks can be  placed--those which are three or four feet in length--brought to a  point, fastened with rope and a kettle hung over the fire from the  center.    One of the best woods to use is scrub oak which is distributed quite  widely over the United States. It burns slowly and gives out an even  heat.    Another fire, especially useful in the case of high wind, is built in a  trench, one end of which is deeper than the other, also wider. Start the  fire with dried leaves, twigs, etc., gradually adding larger wood,  finally using logs placed lengthwise in the"]]]
