Two of the bravest men I  ever saw were here, almost side by side on the little porch--Captain  Mills and Private Clark--one white, the other black. They were wounded  almost at the same time, and in the same way. The patient suffering and  heroism of the black soldier was fully equal to that of the Anglo-Saxon.  It was quite the same, the gentleness and appreciation. They were a  study, these men so widely apart in life, but here strangely close and  alike on the common ground of duty and sacrifice. They received  precisely the same care; each fed like a child, for with their bandaged  eyes they were as helpless as blind men. When the ice pads were renewed  on Captain Mills's eyes the same change was made on Private Clark's  eyes. There was no difference in their beds or food. Neither uttered a  word of complaint. The nearest to a regret expressed by Captain Mills  was a heavy sigh, followed by the words: 'Oh, we were not ready. Our  army was not prepared.'    \"Of himself he talked cheerfully, strong, and hopeful. 'I think I shall  go home with the sight of one eye,' he said. That was all.    \"In the early part of the night he was restless, his brain was active,  cool, and brave as he might be. The moonlight was very bright, a flood  of silver, seen only in the tropics. Hoping to divert him I said: 'The  moonlight is too bright, captain. I will put up a paper screen so you  can get to sleep.'    \"He realized at once the absurdity and the ludicrous side, and with an  amused smile replied: 'But you know I can't see the moonlight.'    \"I said it was time to get more ice for his head and half stumbled  across the porch, blinded by tears. When told who his nearest neighbor  was, Captain Mills expressed great sympathy for Private Clark and paid a  high tribute to the bravery of the colored troops and their faithful  performance of duty.    \"Private Clark talked but little. He would lie apparently asleep until  the pain in his head became unbearable. Then he would try to sit up,  always careful to keep the ice-pad on his eyes over the bandage.    \"'What can I do for you, Clark?' I would ask, anxious to relieve his  pain.    \"'Nothing, thank you,' he would answer. 'It's very nice and comfortable  here. But it's only the misery in my head--the misery is awful.'    \"Poor fellow! there was never a moan, merely a little sigh now and  then, but always that wonderful patience that seemed to me not without a  touch of divine philosophy, complete acceptance.    \"I have mentioned these two men, not as exceptional in bravery, but to  illustrate the rule of heroism, and because they were among the patients  under my immediate care that night. It was a strange night picture--a  picture that could never be dimmed by time but live through all the  years of one's life.    \"After midnight a restful atmosphere pervaded the hospital and the  blessing of sleep fell upon the suffering men, one by one. In the little  interval of repose I dropped into an old chair on the porch, looked away  to the beautiful mountains sharply outlined in the moonlight, and the  sea like waves of silver, the camp on the shore; near by thirty or forty  horses standing motionless. Then the hospital tents, with now and then  the flickering light of a candle; in the background the cliffs, with  here and there a Spanish blockhouse. Over all the tragedy of life and  death, the pain and sorrow, there was the stillness of a peaceful  night--a stillness broken only by the sound of the surf brought back on  the cool breeze, the cool, refreshing breeze, for which we all thanked  God.\"      Later on, as will be remembered, Miss Jennings went North--a volunteer  nurse on the transport Seneca. The brave men whose lives hung in the  balance that night--with little hope that, if life were spared, they  would ever see again--recovered, but each with the loss of an eye. After  a long furlough Private Clark returned to his regiment. Captain Mills,  now General Mills, is the Superintendent of the West Point Military  Academy.    Three times in the first week I went over those terrible roads from the  front to Siboney and return. Arriving at Siboney late one night, there  was no way I could get on board the State of Texas and I was obliged to  remain on shore. The Postmaster insisted that I occupy a room in the  building used for a post-office. Such a courtesy could not be refused,  and against all feeling of acquiescence, and with a dread as if there  were something wrong about it, I allowed myself to be helped out of the  wagon and entered the house. The Postmaster sat down and talked with me  a little while. I thought he seemed ill. I had never met him before, but  my heart went out in sympathy for him. I feared I was taking his room,  although he did not admit it.    I was shown into a room where there was a cot, a table, and a candle  without a stick, burning upon the table. The men went outside and laid  down upon the steps for the night. I laid down upon the cot, but it was  impossible for me to remain there. Something constantly warned me to  leave it. I got up, went to the door, looked out upon the night and  darkness, and waited for the gray of the morning. I went out and stood  upon the beach beside the sea and waited more and more, until finally  some of the men appeared, and I went with them down to the water.    Six days later they told me that the rightful occupant of the cot--the  Postmaster, who had seemed so ill--had died of a fever raging here that  they called \"yellow fever.\" I had occupied his cot. I wonder who it was  that so continually warned me that night to keep away from that room,  away from the cot, away from all connected with it? \"Yellow fever\" was  not then talked of. Did some one tell me? I do not know--but something  told me.    The negotiations between General Shafter and the Spanish army at  Santiago were going on. The flag of truce, that threatened every day to  come down, still floated. The Spanish soldiers had been led by their  officers to believe that every man who surrendered--and the people as  well--would be butchered whenever the city should fall and the American  troops should come in. But when General Shafter commenced to send back  convoys of captured Spanish officers, their wounds dressed, and  carefully placed on stretchers, borne under flags of truce to the  Spanish lines at Santiago, and set down at the feet of General Toral,  and when in astonishment that officer learned the object of the flag of  truce and sent companies of his soldiers to form in line and present  arms, while the cortege of wounded were borne through by American  troops, a lesson was learned that went far toward the surrender of that  city.    I happen to know that it was not without some very natural home  criticism that General Shafter persisted in his course in the face of  the time-honored custom of \"hostages.\" One can readily understand that  the voluntary giving up of prisoners--officers at that--in view of an  impending battle, might seem in the light of old-time army usages a  waste, to characterize it by no harder term. It is possible that none of  the officers in that field had ever read the Articles of the Treaty of  Geneva, or fully recalled that the treaty had become a law, or that  their commander was acting in full accord with its wise and humane  principles.    By this time the main talk of the camp was \"yellow fever.\" It was soon  discovered by the medical authorities that, from there having been at  first one case of fever, there were now one hundred and sixteen, and  that a fever camp would probably be made there, and the wounded gotten  away. It was advisable then that we return to our ship and attempt, as  far as possible, to hold that free from contagion. I was earnestly  solicited to do this, in view of what was expected of our ship, and of  what was expected of us, that we not only protect ourselves but our  cargo and ship from all contamination and even suspicion.    I faithfully promised to do so, and again called for an army wagon,  leaving all supplies that were useful for the men in camp--sending to El  Caney what was most needed there--and taking only our personal effects,  started for Siboney. In less than twenty minutes the rain was pouring on  us and for two hours it fell as if from buckets. The water was from a  foot and a half to two feet deep in the road as we passed along. At one  time our wagon careened, the mules were held up, and we waited to see  whether it should go over or could be brought out, the water a few  inches only from the top of the lower side. It was scarcely possible for  us to stir, hemmed in as we were, but the men from the other wagons  sprang to our wheels, hanging in the air on the upper side, and we were  simply saved by an inch.    But like other things, this cleared away. We came into Siboney about  three o'clock, in a bright glare of sunshine, to find the town entirely  burned--all buildings gone or smoking--and a \"yellow fever\" hospital  established a mile and a half out from Siboney.    All effort was made to hold our ship free from suspicion. The process of  reasoning leading to the conclusion that a solid cargo, packed in tight  boxes in the hold of a ship, anchored at sea, could become infected in  a day from the land or a passing individual, is indeed an intricate  process. But we had some experience in this direction. Captain McCalla,  in his repeated humane attempts to feed the refugees around Guantanamo,  had called again for a hundred thousand rations, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30249"],[0,"Ways of Nature (#17)"],[1,"ends, or are caught around branches; the  weaving and the sewing are effective, and the whole nest is a marvel  of blind skill, of untaught intelligence; yet how unmethodical, how  delightfully irregular, how unmistakably a piece of wild nature!    Sometimes the instinct of the bird is tardy, and the egg of the bird  gets ripe before the nest is ready; in such a case the egg is of  course lost. I once found the nest of the black and white creeping  warbler in a mossy bank in the woods, and under the nest was an egg of  the bird. The warbler had excavated the site for her nest, dropped her  egg into it, and then gone on with her building. Instinct is not  always inerrant. Nature is wasteful, and plays the game with a free  hand. Yet what she loses on one side she gains on another; she is like  that least bittern Mr. Frank M. Chapman tells about. Two of the  bittern's five eggs had been punctured by the long-billed marsh wren.  When the bird returned to her nest and found the two eggs punctured,  she made no outcry, showed no emotion, but deliberately proceeded to  eat them. Having done this, she dropped the empty shells over the side  of the nest, together with any straws that had become soiled in the  process, cleaned her bill, and proceeded with her incubation. This was  Nature in a nut-shell,--or rather egg-shell,--turning her mishaps to  some good account. If the egg will not make a bird, it will make food;  if not food, then fertilizer.    Among nearly all our birds, the female is the active business member  of the partnership; she has a turn for practical affairs; she chooses  the site of the nest, and usually builds it unaided. The life of the  male is more or less a holiday or picnic till the young are hatched,  when his real cares begin, for he does his part in feeding them. One  may see the male cedar-bird attending the female as she is busy with  her nest-building, but never, so far as I have observed, assisting  her. One spring I observed with much interest a phoebe-bird building  her nest not far from my cabin in the woods. The male looked on  approvingly, but did not help. He perched most of the time on a  mullein stalk near the little spring run where Phoebe came for mud.  In the early morning hours she made her trips at intervals of a minute  or two. The male flirted his tail and called encouragingly, and when  she started up the hill with her load he would accompany her part way,  to help her over the steepest part, as it were, then return to his  perch and watch and call for her return. For an hour or more I  witnessed this little play in bird life, in which the female's part  was so primary and the male's so secondary. There is something in such  things that seems to lend support to Professor Lester F. Ward's  contention, as set forth in his \"Pure Sociology,\" that in the natural  evolution of the two sexes the female was first and the male second;  that he was made from her rib, so to speak, and not she from his.    With our phalarope and a few Australian birds, the position of the two  sexes as indicated above is reversed, the females having the  ornaments and bright colors and doing the courting, while the male  does the incubating. In a few cases also the female is much the more  masculine, noisy, and pugnacious. With some of our common birds, such  as the woodpeckers, the chickadee, and the swallows, both sexes take  part in nest-building.    It is a very pretty sight to witness a pair of wood thrushes building  their nest. Indeed, what is there about the wood thrush that is not  pleasing? He is a kind of visible embodied melody. Some birds are so  sharp and nervous and emphatic in their movements, as the common  snowbird or junco, the flashing of whose white tail quills expresses  the character of the bird. But all the ways of the wood thrush are  smooth and gentle, and suggest the melody of its song. It is the only  bird thief I love to see carrying off my cherries. It usually takes  only those dropped upon the ground by other birds, and with the red or  golden globe impaled upon its beak, its flight across the lawn is a  picture delightful to behold. One season a pair of them built a nest  in a near-by grove; morning after morning, for many mornings, I used  to see the two going to and from the nest, over my vineyard and  currant patch and pear orchard, in quest of, or bringing material for,  the structure. They flew low, the female in the lead, the male just  behind in line with her, timing his motions to hers, the two making a  brown, gently undulating line, very pretty to look upon, from my  neighbor's field where they obtained the material, to the tree that  held the nest. A gentle, gliding flight, hurried but hushed, as it  were, and expressive of privacy and loving preoccupation. The male  carried no material; apparently he was simply the escort of his mate;  but he had an air of keen and joyous interest. He never failed to  attend her each way, keeping about a yard behind her, and flying as if  her thought were his thought and her wish his wish. I have rarely seen  anything so pretty in bird life. The movements of all our thrushes  except the robin give one this same sense of harmony,--nothing sharp  or angular or abrupt. Their gestures are as pleasing as their notes.    One evening, while seated upon my porch, I had convincing proof that  musical or song contests do take place among the birds. Two wood  thrashes who had nests near by sat on the top of a dead tree and  pitted themselves against each other in song for over half an hour,  contending like champions in a game, and certainly affording the  rarest treat in wood thrush melody I had ever had. They sang and sang  with unwearied spirit and persistence, now and then changing position  or facing in another direction, but keeping within a few feet of each  other. The rivalry became so obvious and was so interesting that I  finally made it a point not to take my eyes from the singers. The  twilight deepened till their forms began to grow dim; then one of the  birds could stand the strain no longer, the limit of fair competition  had been reached, and seeming to say, \"I will silence you, anyhow,\" it  made a spiteful dive at its rival, and in hot pursuit the two  disappeared in the bushes beneath the tree. Of course I would not say  that the birds were consciously striving to outdo each other in song;  it was the old feud between males in the love season, not a war of  words or of blows, but of song. Had the birds been birds of brilliant  plumage, the rivalry would probably have taken the form of strutting  and showing off their bright colors and ornaments.    An English writer on birds, Edmund Selous; describes a similar song  contest between two nightingales. \"Jealousy,\" he says, \"did not seem  to blind them to the merit of each other's performance. Though often  one, upon hearing the sweet, hostile strains, would burst forth  instantly itself,--and here there was no certain mark of  appreciation,--yet sometimes, perhaps quite as often, it would put its  head on one side and listen with exactly the appearance of a musical  connoisseur, weighing, testing, and appraising each note as it issued  from the rival bill. A curious, half-suppressed expression would  steal, or seem to steal (for Fancy may play her part in such matters),  over the listening bird, and the idea appear to be, 'How exquisite  would be those strains were they not sung by ----, and yet I must  admit that they are exquisite.'\" Fancy no doubt does play a part in  such matters. It may well be doubted if birds are musical  connoisseurs, or have anything like human appreciation of their own or  of each other's songs. My reason for thinking so is this: I have heard  a bobolink with an instrument so defective that its song was broken  and inarticulate in parts, and yet it sang with as much apparent joy  and abandon as any of its fellows. I have also heard a hermit thrush  with a similar defect or impediment that appeared to sing entirely to  its own satisfaction. It would be very interesting to know if these  poor singers found mates as readily as their more gifted brothers. If  they did, the Darwinian theory of \"sexual selection\" in such matters,  according to which the finer songster would carry off the female,  would fall to the ground. Yet it is certain that it is during the  mating and breeding season that these \"song combats\" occur, and the  favor of the female would seem to be the matter in dispute. Whether or  not it be expressive of actual jealousy or rivalry, we have no other  words to apply to it.    A good deal of light is thrown upon the ways of nature as seen in the  lives of our solitary wasps, so skillfully and charmingly depicted by  George W. Peckham and his wife in their work on those insects. So  whimsical, so fickle, so forgetful, so fussy, so wise, and yet so  foolish, as these little people are! such victims of routine and yet  so individual, such apparent foresight and yet such thoughtlessness,  at such great pains and labor to dig a hole and build a cell, and then  at times sealing it up without storing it with food or laying the egg,  half finishing hole after hole, and then abandoning them without any  apparent reason; sometimes killing their spiders, at other times only  paralyzing them; one species digging its burrow before it captures its  game, others capturing the game and then digging the hole; some of  them hanging the spider up in the fork of a weed to keep it away from  the ants while they work at their nest, and running to it every few  minutes to see that it is safe; others laying the insect on the ground  while they dig; one species walking backward and dragging its spider  after it, and when the spider is so small that it carries it in its  mandible, still walking backward as if dragging it, when it would be  much more convenient to walk forward.
