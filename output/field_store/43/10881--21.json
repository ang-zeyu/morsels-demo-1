RULE II. When the stars in the northern sky can be seen. Find [b]  Cassiopeiæ, and imagine a line drawn from it to Polaris, and another  line from Polaris to the zenith. The sidereal time is equal to the angle  between these lines, provided that that angle must be measured from the  zenith toward the west. Turn the angle from degrees into hours by  dividing by 15.    55. THE EARTH'S ROTATION.--We are familiar with the fact that a watch  may run faster at one time than at another, and it is worth while to  inquire if the same is not true of our chief timepiece--the earth. It is  assumed in the sections upon the measurement of time that the earth  turns about its axis with absolute uniformity, so that mean solar time  never gains or loses even the smallest fraction of a second. Whether  this be absolutely true or not, no one has ever succeeded in finding  convincing proof of a variation large enough to be measured, although it  has recently been shown that the axis about which it rotates is not  perfectly fixed within the body of the earth. The solid body of the  earth wriggles about this axis like a fish upon a hook, so that the  position of the north pole upon the earth's surface changes within a  year to the extent of 40 or 50 feet (15 meters) without ever getting  more than this distance away from its average position. This is probably  caused by the periodical shifting of masses of air and water from one  part of the earth to another as the seasons change, and it seems  probable that these changes will produce some small effect upon the  rotation of the earth. But in spite of these, for any such moderate  interval of time as a year or a century, so far as present knowledge  goes, we may regard the earth's rotation as uniform and undisturbed. For  longer intervals--e. g., 1,000,000 or 10,000,000 years--the question is  a very different one, and we shall have to meet it again in another  connection.    56. LONGITUDE AND TIME.--In what precedes there has been constant  reference to the meridian. The day begins when the sun is on the  meridian. Solar time is the angular distance of the sun past the  meridian. Sidereal time was determined by observing transits of stars  over a meridian line actually laid out upon the ground, etc. But every  place upon the earth has its own meridian from which \"the time\" may be  reckoned, and in Fig. 31, where the rays of sunlight are represented as  falling upon a part of the earth's equator through which the meridians  of New York, Chicago, and San Francisco pass, it is evident that these  rays make different angles with the meridians, and that the sun is  farther from the meridian of New York than from that of San Francisco by  an amount just equal to the angle at _O_ between these meridians. This  angle is called by geographers the difference of longitude between the  two places, and the student should note that the word longitude is here  used in a different sense from that on page 36. From Fig. 31 we obtain  the    _Theorem._--The difference between \"the times\" at any two meridians is  equal to their difference of longitude, and the time at the eastern  meridian is greater than at the western meridian. Astronomers usually  express differences of longitude in hours instead of degrees. 1h. = 15°.    The name given to any kind of time should distinguish all the elements  which enter into it--e. g., New York sidereal time means the hour angle  of the vernal equinox measured from the meridian of New York, Chicago  true solar time is the hour angle of the sun reckoned from the meridian  of Chicago, etc.    [Illustration: FIG. 31.--Longitude and time]    [Illustration: FIG. 32.--Standard time.]    57. STANDARD TIME.--The requirements of railroad traffic have led to the  use throughout the United States and Canada of four \"standard times,\"  each of which is a mean solar time some integral number of hours slower  than the time of the meridian passing through the Royal Observatory at  Greenwich, England.        Eastern time is 5 hours slower than that of Greenwich.      Central  \"      6  \"      \"     \"    \"         \"      Mountain \"      7  \"      \"     \"    \"         \"      Pacific  \"      8  \"      \"     \"    \"         \"    In Fig. 32 the broken lines indicate roughly the parts of the United  States and Canada in which these several kinds of time are used, and  illustrate how irregular are the boundaries of these parts.    Standard time is sent daily into all of the more important telegraph  offices of the United States, and serves to regulate watches and clocks,  to the almost complete exclusion of local time.    58. TO DETERMINE THE LONGITUDE.--With an ordinary watch observe the time  of the sun's transit over your local meridian, and correct the observed  time for the equation of time by means of the curve in Fig. 30. The  difference between the corrected time and 12 o'clock will be the  correction of your watch referred to local mean solar time. Compare your  watch with the time signals in the nearest telegraph office and find its  correction referred to standard time. The difference between the two  corrections is the difference between your longitude and that of the  standard meridian.    N. B.--Don't tamper with the watch by trying to \"set it right.\" No harm  will be done if it is wrong, provided you take due account of the  correction as indicated above.    If the correction of the watch changed between your observation and the  comparison in the telegraph office, what effect would it have upon the  longitude determination? How can you avoid this effect?    59. CHRONOLOGY.--The Century Dictionary defines chronology as \"the  science of time\"--that is, \"the method of measuring or computing time  by regular divisions or periods according to the revolutions of the sun  or moon.\"    We have already seen that for the measurement of short intervals of time  the day and its subdivisions--hours, minutes, seconds--furnish a very  complete and convenient system. But for longer periods, extending to  hundreds and thousands of days, a larger unit of time is required, and  for the most part these longer units have in all ages and among all  peoples been based upon astronomical considerations. But to this there  is one marked exception. The week is a simple multiple of the day, as  the dime is a multiple of the cent, and while it may have had its origin  in the changing phases of the moon this is at best doubtful, since it  does not follow these with any considerable accuracy. If the still  longer units of time--the month and the year--had equally been made to  consist of an integral number of days much confusion and  misunderstanding might have been avoided, and the annals of ancient  times would have presented fewer pitfalls to the historian than is now  the case. The month is plainly connected with the motion of the moon  among the stars. The year is, of course, based upon the motion of the  sun through the heavens and the change of seasons which is thus  produced; although, as commonly employed, it is not quite the same as  the time required by the earth to make one complete revolution in its  orbit. This time of one revolution is called a sidereal year, while, as  we have already seen in Chapter V, the year which measures the course of  the seasons is shorter than this on account of the precession of the  equinoxes. It is called a tropical year with reference to the circuit  which the sun makes from one tropic to the other and back again.    We can readily understand why primitive peoples should adopt as units of  time these natural periods, but in so doing they incurred much the same  kind of difficulty that we should experience in trying to use both  English and American money in the ordinary transactions of life. How  many dollars make a pound sterling? How shall we make change with  English shillings and American dimes, etc.? How much is one unit worth  in terms of the other?    One of the Greek poets[2] has left us a quaint account of the confusion  which existed in his time with regard to the place of months and moons  in the calendar:        \"The moon by us to you her greeting sends,      But bids us say that she's an ill-used moon      And takes it much amiss that you will still      Shuffle her days and turn them topsy-turvy,      So that when gods, who know their feast days well,      By your false count are sent home supperless,      They scold and storm at her for your neglect.\"      [2] Aristophanes, The Clouds, Whewell's translation.    60. DAY, MONTH, AND YEAR.--If the day, the month, and the year are to be  used concurrently, it is necessary to determine how many days are  contained in the month and year, and when this has been done by the  astronomer the numbers are found to be very awkward and inconvenient for  daily use; and much of the history of chronology consists in an account  of the various devices by which ingenious men have sought to use  integral numbers to replace the cumbrous decimal fractions which follow.    According to Professor Harkness, for the epoch 1900 A. D.--        One tropical year = 365.242197 mean solar days.       \"     \"      \"   = 365d. 5h. 48m. 45.8s.      One lunation      = 29.530588 mean solar days.       \"     \"          = 29d. 12h. 44m. 2.8s.    The word _lunation_ means the average interval from one new moon to the  next one--i. e., the time required by the moon to go from conjunction  with the sun round to conjunction again.    A very ancient device was to call a year equal to 365 days, and to have  months alternately of 29 and 30 days in length, but this was  unsatisfactory in more than one way. At the end of four years this  artificial calendar would be about one day ahead of the true one, at the  end of forty years ten days in error, and within a single lifetime the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34848"],[0,"Mammals of the San Gabriel Mountains of California (#17)"],[1,"in 1950, and others said they saw huge cat tracks in  Icehouse Canyon. State Trapper James Wolfort reported that he trapped  two lions on the coastal face of the range in 1947. Authentic reports  indicate that mountain lions occur in remote sections on both slopes of  the range, and in these areas mountain lions probably are as common as  they ever were.      Family CERVIDAE      =Odocoileus hemionus californicus= (Caton)    Mule Deer    Mule deer are common in chaparral areas on both slopes of the San  Gabriel Mountains. The animals or their tracks have been observed from  the coastal sagebrush flats up to about 9200 feet on Mount San Antonio,  and on the desert slope down to the lower limit of the juniper belt.    Deer are plentiful in the upper chaparral belt, and large bands are  often noted there in spring. These bands may form in the up-mountain  migration and reoccupation of areas which were covered by winter snows.  A band of fourteen was observed on March 17, 1951, one mile east of the  mouth of Cattle Canyon, and bands of about half a dozen individuals each  were often noted in March, 1951, at the base of Icehouse Canyon.  Cronemiller and Bartholomew (1950) gave a good account of the mule deer  in the chaparral belt of the San Gabriel Mountains.    On Blue Ridge in the fall of 1951, deer were plentiful, usually being  observed near patches of snowbrush and sage. They were seldom found in  the coniferous forests. On November 6, 1951, while tending a line of  snap traps before sunup, I startled a deer from its bed at one edge of a  several-acre patch of snowbrush. In synchrony with the noise made by  this deer's rising five other deer in various parts of the brush patch  leaped up and made off. When bedded down in these extensive brush tracts  deer are probably safe from an undetected approach, for a noiseless  approach through the brush is impossible.    Two deer skulls from the San Gabriels were examined: that of an adult  male from Evey Canyon, and that of an adult female from the mouth of  Palmer Canyon. Using as a basis for comparison the cranial measurements  for the subspecies _californicus_ and _fuliginatus_ given by Cowan  (1933:326), these skulls were subspecies _californicus_. In none of the  cranial characteristics considered did they tend toward the southern  race _fuliginatus_. A young adult male, however, which was killed by a  car near Cajon Pass on October 2, 1951, showed pelage characteristics of  _fuliginatus_. Its fresh winter pelage was dark, and had the distinct  black mid-dorsal line and the broad dorsal line on the tail mentioned by  Cowan (_ibid._) as distinguishing marks of the race _fuliginatus_. Its  cranial measurements were not taken. Judging from this limited material  the deer in the central part of the range, that is to say, in the San  Antonio Canyon region, are of the race _californicus_, while  _fuliginatus_ may penetrate the extreme eastern end of the range.    Deer hair and bones were often found in coyote feces from the sagebrush  belt. Some of these records may represent deer eaten as carrion. On  February 6, 1952, tracks across a sandy channel in San Antonio Wash  demonstrated that a deer had been closely pursued by a coyote. The deer  had leaped from a cutbank onto the sand, had whirled around in several  sharp turns, and had run into the adjacent brush. The tracks of a  running coyote followed every twist of the deer's trail. The trail was  followed into the brush where it was lost. Two bobcats trapped near  Graham Canyon on the desert slope had hair and bones of deer in their  stomachs.        _Specimens examined_, 2: Los Angeles County: Evey Canyon, 2100      ft., 1 (PC); Palmer Canyon, 1900 ft., 1 (PC).      Family BOVIDAE      =Ovis canadensis nelsoni= Merriam    Bighorn    Bands of bighorn sheep occur on some of the higher and more rugged peaks  of the San Gabriel Mountains. Although I never sighted the animals  themselves, I have seen abundant signs of their presence on the ridge  sloping west from Telegraph Peak at about 9000 feet elevation. Several  bands reportedly range in the head of San Antonio Canyon, and to the  south on Telegraph, Ontario, and Cucamonga peaks. The sheep usually stay  in the higher sections of the range, generally above about 7000 feet  elevation. According to district Ranger A. Lewis some bighorns summer in  the lower East Fork of San Gabriel Canyon. The subspecific status of the  bighorns in the San Gabriel Mountains has not been definitely  determined. Following Grinnell (1933:211) they are here referred to  _nelsoni_. If the band can be preserved without introduction of \"alien\"  stock, the United States Forest Service and the California Fish and Game  Commission will have registered an achievement that will be applauded by  all persons who are interested in American wildlife.
