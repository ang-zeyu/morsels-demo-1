After a long time some animal  splashed in the water, and seemed to cross the river at the ford beyond  the lair, but what animal it was she could not see. From the distant  drinking-pools she could hear the sound of splashing, and the noise of  elephants--so still was the night.    The earth was now a colourless arrangement of white reflections and  impenetrable shadows, under the blue sky. The silvery moon was already  spotted with the filigree crests of the chestnut woods, and over the  shadowy eastward hills the stars were multiplying. The knoll fires were  bright red now, and black figures stood waiting against them. They were  waiting for a scream.... Surely it would be soon.    The night suddenly seemed full of movement. She held her breath. Things  were passing--one, two, three--subtly sneaking shadows.... Jackals.    Then a long waiting again.    Then, asserting itself as real at once over all the sounds her mind had  imagined, came a stir in the thicket, then a vigorous movement. There  was a snap. The reeds crashed heavily, once, twice, thrice, and then  everything was still save a measured swishing. She heard a low tremulous  growl, and then everything was still again. The stillness  lengthened--would it never end? She held her breath; she bit her lips to  stop screaming. Then something scuttled through the undergrowth. Her  scream was involuntary. She did not hear the answering yell from the  mound.    Immediately the thicket woke up to vigorous movement again. She saw the  grass stems waving in the light of the setting moon, the alders swaying.  She struggled violently--her last struggle. But nothing came towards  her. A dozen monsters seemed rushing about in that little place for a  couple of minutes, and then again came silence. The moon sank behind the  distant chestnuts and the night was dark.    Then an odd sound, a sobbing panting, that grew faster and fainter. Yet  another silence, and then dim sounds and the grunting of some animal.    Everything was still again. Far away eastwards an elephant trumpeted,  and from the woods came a snarling and yelping that died away.    In the long interval the moon shone out again, between the stems of the  trees on the ridge, sending two great bars of light and a bar of  darkness across the reedy waste. Then came a steady rustling, a splash,  and the reeds swayed wider and wider apart. And at last they broke open,  cleft from root to crest.... The end had come.    She looked to see the thing that had come out of the reeds. For a moment  it seemed certainly the great head and jaw she expected, and then it  dwindled and changed. It was a dark low thing, that remained silent, but  it was not the lion. It became still--everything became still. She  peered. It was like some gigantic frog, two limbs and a slanting body.  Its head moved about searching the shadows....    A rustle, and it moved clumsily, with a sort of hopping. And as it moved  it gave a low groan.    The blood rushing through her veins was suddenly joy. \"_Ugh-lomi!_\" she  whispered.    The thing stopped. \"_Eudena_,\" he answered softly with pain in his  voice, and peering into the alders.    He moved again, and came out of the shadow beyond the reeds into the  moonlight. All his body was covered with dark smears. She saw he was  dragging his legs, and that he gripped his axe, the first axe, in one  hand. In another moment he had struggled into the position of all fours,  and had staggered over to her. \"The lion,\" he said in a strange mingling  of exultation and anguish. \"Wau!--I have slain a lion. With my own hand.  Even as I slew the great bear.\" He moved to emphasise his words, and  suddenly broke off with a faint cry. For a space he did not move.    \"Let me free,\" whispered Eudena....    He answered her no words but pulled himself up from his crawling  attitude by means of the alder stem, and hacked at her thongs with the  sharp edge of his axe. She heard him sob at each blow. He cut away the  thongs about her chest and arms, and then his hand dropped. His chest  struck against her shoulder and he slipped down beside her and lay  still.    But the rest of her release was easy. Very hastily she freed herself.  She made one step from the tree, and her head was spinning. Her last  conscious movement was towards him. She reeled, and dropped. Her hand  fell upon his thigh. It was soft and wet, and gave way under her  pressure; he cried out at her touch, and writhed and lay still again.    Presently a dark dog-like shape came very softly through the reeds. Then  stopped dead and stood sniffing, hesitated, and at last turned and slunk  back into the shadows.    Long was the time they remained there motionless, with the light of the  setting moon shining on their limbs. Very slowly, as slowly as the  setting of the moon, did the shadow of the reeds towards the mound flow  over them. Presently their legs were hidden, and Ugh-lomi was but a bust  of silver. The shadow crept to his neck, crept over his face, and so at  last the darkness of the night swallowed them up.    The shadow became full of instinctive stirrings. There was a patter of  feet, and a faint snarling--the sound of a blow.           *       *       *       *       *    There was little sleep that night for the women and children at the  squatting-place until they heard Eudena scream. But the men were weary  and sat dozing. When Eudena screamed they felt assured of their safety,  and hurried to get the nearest places to the fires. The old woman  laughed at the scream, and laughed again because Si, the little friend  of Eudena, whimpered. Directly the dawn came they were all alert and  looking towards the alders. They could see that Eudena had been taken.  They could not help feeling glad to think that Uya was appeased. But  across the minds of the men the thought of Ugh-lomi fell like a shadow.  They could understand revenge, for the world was old in revenge, but  they did not think of rescue. Suddenly a hyaena fled out of the thicket,  and came galloping across the reed space. His muzzle and paws were  dark-stained. At that sight all the men shouted and clutched at  throwing-stones and ran towards him, for no animal is so pitiful a  coward as the hyaena by day. All men hated the hyaena because he preyed on  children, and would come and bite when one was sleeping on the edge of  the squatting-place. And Cat's-skin, throwing fair and straight, hit the  brute shrewdly on the flank, whereat the whole tribe yelled with  delight.    At the noise they made there came a flapping of wings from the lair of  the lion, and three white-headed vultures rose slowly and circled and  came to rest amidst the branches of an alder, overlooking the lair. \"Our  lord is abroad,\" said the old woman, pointing. \"The vultures have their  share of Eudena.\" For a space they remained there, and then first one  and then another dropped back into the thicket.    Then over the eastern woods, and touching the whole world to life and  colour, poured, with the exaltation of a trumpet blast, the light of the  rising sun. At the sight of him the children shouted together, and  clapped their hands and began to race off towards the water. Only little  Si lagged behind and looked wonderingly at the alders where she had seen  the head of Eudena overnight.    But Uya, the old lion, was not abroad, but at home, and he lay very  still, and a little on one side. He was not in his lair, but a little  way from it in a place of trampled grass. Under one eye was a little  wound, the feeble little bite of the first axe. But all the ground  beneath his chest was ruddy brown with a vivid streak, and in his chest  was a little hole that had been made by Ugh-lomi's stabbing-spear. Along  his side and at his neck the vultures had marked their claims. For so  Ugh-lomi had slain him, lying stricken under his paw and thrusting  haphazard at his chest. He had driven the spear in with all his strength  and stabbed the giant to the heart. So it was the reign of the lion, of  the second incarnation of Uya the Master, came to an end.    From the knoll the bustle of preparation grew, the hacking of spears and  throwing-stones. None spake the name of Ugh-lomi for fear that it might  bring him. The men were going to keep together, close together, in the  hunting for a day or so. And their hunting was to be Ugh-lomi, lest  instead he should come a-hunting them.    But Ugh-lomi was lying very still and silent, outside the lion's lair,  and Eudena squatted beside him, with the ash spear, all smeared with  lion's blood, gripped in her hand.      V--THE FIGHT IN THE LION'S THICKET    Ugh-lomi lay still, his back against an alder, and his thigh was a red  mass terrible to see. No civilised man could have lived who had been so  sorely wounded, but Eudena got him thorns to close his wounds, and  squatted beside him day and night, smiting the flies from him with a fan  of reeds by day, and in the night threatening the hyaenas with the first  axe in her hand; and in a little while he began to heal. It was high  summer, and there was no rain. Little food they had during the first two  days his wounds were open. In the low place where they hid were no roots  nor little beasts, and the stream, with its water-snails and fish, was  in the open a hundred yards away. She could not go abroad by day for  fear of the tribe, her brothers and sisters, nor by night for fear of  the beasts, both on his account and hers. So they shared the lion with  the vultures. But there was a trickle of water near by, and Eudena  brought him plenty in her hands.    Where Ugh-lomi lay was well hidden from the tribe by a thicket of  alders, and all fenced about with bulrushes and tall reeds. The dead  lion he had killed lay near his old lair on a place of trampled reeds  fifty yards away, in sight through the reed-stems, and the vultures  fought each other"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27378"],[0,"The Story of the Heavens (#17)"],[1,"his latitude and tell him his local  time, but the captain further requires to know the Greenwich time before  he can place his finger at a point of the chart and say, \"My ship is  here.\" To ascertain the Greenwich time the ship carries a chronometer  which has been carefully rated before starting, and, as a precaution,  two or three chronometers are usually provided to guard against the risk  of error. An unknown error of a minute in the chronometer might perhaps  lead the vessel fifteen miles from its proper course.    [Illustration: PLATE VI.    CHART OF THE MOON'S SURFACE.]    [Illustration: Fig. 27.--Key to Chart of the Moon (Plate VI.).]    It is important to have the means of testing the chronometers during the  progress of the voyage; and it would be a great convenience if every  captain, when he wished, could actually consult some infallible standard  of Greenwich time. We want, in fact, a Greenwich clock which may be  visible over the whole globe. There is such a clock; and, like any other  clock, it has a face on which certain marks are made, and a hand which  travels round that face. The great clock at Westminster shrinks into  insignificance when compared with the mighty clock which the captain  uses for setting his chronometer. The face of this stupendous dial is  the face of the heavens. The numbers engraved on the face of a clock are  replaced by the twinkling stars; while the hand which moves over the  dial is the beautiful moon herself. When the captain desires to test  his chronometer, he measures the distance of the moon from a  neighbouring star. For example, he may see that the moon is three  degrees from the star Regulus. In the Nautical Almanac he finds the  Greenwich time at which the moon was three degrees from Regulus.  Comparing this with the indications of the chronometer, he finds the  required correction.    There is one widely-credited myth about the moon which must be regarded  as devoid of foundation. The idea that our satellite and the weather  bear some relation has no doubt been entertained by high authority, and  appears to be an article in the belief of many an excellent mariner.  Careful comparison between the state of the weather and the phases of  the moon has, however, quite discredited the notion that any connection  of the kind does really exist.    We often notice large blank spaces on maps of Africa and of Australia  which indicate our ignorance of parts of the interior of those great  continents. We can find no such blank spaces in the map of the moon.  Astronomers know the surface of the moon better than geographers know  the interior of Africa. Every spot on the face of the moon which is as  large as an English parish has been mapped, and all the more important  objects have been named.    A general map of the moon is shown in Plate VI. It has been based upon  drawings made with small telescopes, and it gives an entire view of that  side of our satellite which is presented towards us. The moon is shown  as it appears in an astronomical telescope, which inverts everything, so  that the south is at the top and the north at the bottom (to show  objects upright a telescope requires an additional pair of lenses in the  eye-piece, and as this diminishes the amount of light reaching the eye  they are dispensed with in astronomical telescopes). We can see on the  map some of the characteristic features of lunar scenery. Those dark  regions so conspicuous in the ordinary full moon are easily recognised  on the map. They were thought to be seas by astronomers before the days  of telescopes, and indeed the name \"Mare\" is still retained, though it  is obvious that they contain no water at present. The map also shows  certain ridges or elevated portions, and when we apply measurement to  these objects we learn that they must be mighty mountain ranges. But the  most striking features on the moon are those ring-like objects which are  scattered over the surface in profusion. These are known as the lunar  craters.    To facilitate reference to the chief points of interest we have arranged  an index map (Fig. 27) which will give a clue to the names of the  several objects depicted upon the plate. The so-called seas are  represented by capital letters; so that A is the Mare Crisium, and H the  Oceanus Procellarum. The ranges of mountains are indicated by small  letters; thus a on the index is the site of the so-called Caucasus  mountains, and similarly the Apennines are denoted by _c_. The numerous  craters are distinguished by numbers; for example, the feature on the  map corresponding to 20 on the index is the crater designated Ptolemy.      A. Mare Crisium.    B.

In the case of the moon we  can only give a map of one hemisphere, for the simple reason that the  moon always turns the same side towards us, and accordingly we never get  a view of the other side. This is caused by the interesting circumstance  that the moon takes exactly the same time to turn once round its own  axis as it takes to go once round the earth. The rotation is, however,  performed with uniform speed, while the moon does not move in its orbit  with a perfectly uniform velocity (_see_ Chapter IV.). The consequence  is that we now get a slight glimpse round the east limb, and now a  similar glimpse round the west limb, as if the moon were shaking its  head very gently at us. But it is only an insignificant margin of the  far side of the moon which this _libration_ permits us to examine.    Lunar objects are well suited for observation when the sunlight falls  upon them in such a manner as to exhibit strongly contrasted lights and  shadows. It is impossible to observe the moon satisfactorily when it is  full, for then no conspicuous shadows are cast. The most opportune  moment for seeing any particular lunar object is when it lies just at  the illuminated side of the boundary between light and shade, for then  the features are brought out with exquisite distinctness.    Plate VII.[7] gives an illustration of lunar scenery, the object  represented being known to astronomers by the name of Triesnecker. The  district included is only a very small fraction of the entire surface of  the moon, yet the actual area is very considerable, embracing as it does  many hundreds of square miles. We see in it various ranges of lunar  mountains, while the central object in the picture is one of those  remarkable lunar craters which we meet with so frequently in every lunar  landscape. This crater is about twenty miles in diameter, and it has a  lofty mountain in the centre, the peak of which is just illuminated by  the rising sun in that phase of our satellite which is represented in  the picture.    A typical view of a lunar crater is shown in Plate VIII. This is, no  doubt, a somewhat imaginary sketch. The point of view from which the  artist is supposed to have taken the picture is one quite unattainable  by terrestrial astronomers, yet there can be little doubt that it is a  fair representation of objects on the moon. We should, however,  recollect the scale on which it is drawn. The vast crater must be many  miles across, and the mountain at its centre must be thousands of feet  high. The telescope will, even at its best, only show the moon as well  as we could see it with the unaided eye if it were 250 miles away  instead of being 240,000. We must not, therefore, expect to see any  details on the moon even with the finest telescopes, unless they were  coarse enough to be visible at a distance of 250 miles. England from  such a point of view would only show London as a coloured spot, in  contrast with the general surface of the country.    We return, however, from a somewhat fancy sketch to a more prosaic  examination of what the telescope does actually reveal. Plate IX.  represents the large crater Plato, so well known to everyone who uses a  telescope. The floor of this remarkable object is nearly flat, and the  central mountain, so often seen in other craters, is entirely wanting.  We describe it more fully in the general list of lunar objects.    The mountain peaks on the moon throw long, well-defined shadows,  characterised by a sharpness which we do not find in the shadows of  terrestrial objects. The difference between the two cases arises from  the absence of air from the moon. Our atmosphere diffuses a certain  amount of light, which mitigates the blackness of terrestrial shadows  and tends to soften their outline. No such influences are at work on the  moon, and the sharpness of the shadows is taken advantage of in our  attempts to measure the heights of the lunar mountains.    It is often easy to compute the altitude of a church steeple, a lofty  chimney, or any similar object, from the length of its shadow. The  simplest and the most accurate process is to measure at noon the number  of feet from the base of the object to the end of the shadow. The  elevation of the sun at noon on the day in question can be obtained from"]]]
