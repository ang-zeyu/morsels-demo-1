And when the storm was over it was  nowhere to be seen.    So Drake offered another ship to Lane.  It was a large one, too large  to get into the little harbour, but the only one he could spare.  Lane was now doubtful what was best to do.  Did it not seem as if  by driving away their ship God had stretched out His hand to take  them from thence? Was the storm not meant as a sign to them?    So not being able to decide by himself what was best to do, Lane  called his officers and gentlemen together, and asked advice of  them.    They all begged him to go home.  No help had come from Sir Richard  Grenville, nor was it likely to come, for Drake had brought the  news that war between Spain and England had been declared.  They knew  that at such a time every Englishman would bend all his energies to  the defeat of Spain, and that Raleigh would have neither thoughts  nor Money to spare for that far-off colony.    At length it was settled that they should all go home.  In haste  then the Englishmen got on board, for Drake, was anxious to be gone  from the dangerous anchorage \"which caused him more peril of wreck,\"  says Ralph Lane, \"than all his former most honourable actions  against the Spaniards.\"    So on the 19th of June 1586, the colonists set sail and arrived  in England some six weeks later.  They brought with them two things  which afterward proved to be of wit great importance.  The first  was tobacco.  The use of it had been known ever since the days of  Columbus, but it was now for the first time brought to England.  The second was the potato.  This Raleigh planted on his estates in  Ireland, and to this day Ireland is one of the great potato growing  countries of the world.    But meanwhile Raleigh had not forgotten his colonists, and scarce  a week after they had sailed away, a ship arrived laden \"with all  manner of things in most plentiful manner for the supply and relief  of his colony.\"    For some time the ship beat up and down the coast searching vainly  for the colony.  And at length finding no sign of it, it returned to  England.  About a fortnight later Sir Richard Grenville also arrived  with three ships.  To his astonishment when he reached Roanoke he  saw no sign of the ship which he knew had sailed shortly before  him.  And to his still greater astonishment he found the colony  deserted.  Yet he could not believe that it had been abandoned.  So  he searched the country up and down in the hope of finding some of  the colonists.  But finding no trace of them he at length gave up  the search and returned to the forsaken huts.  And being unwilling  to lose possession of the country, he determined to leave some of  his men there.  So fifteen men were left behind, well provided with  everything necessary to keep them for two years.  Then Sir Richard  sailed homeward.    In spite of all these mischances Raleigh would not give up his great  idea.  And the following year he fitted out another expedition.  This  time there were a few women among the colonists, and John White,  who had already been out with Lane, was chosen as Governor.    It was now decided to give up Roanoke which had proved such an  unfortunate spot, and the new company of colonists was bound for  Chesapeake Bay.  But before they settled there they were told to go  to Roanoke to pick up the fifteen men left by Sir Richard Grenville  and take them to Chesapeake also.    When, however, they reached Roanoke the Master of the vessels, who  was by birth a Spaniard, and who was perhaps in league with the  Spanish, said that it was too late in the year to go seeking another  spot.  So whether they would or not he landed the colonists, and  sailed away, leaving only one small boat with them.    Thus perforce they had to take up their abode in the old spot.  They  found it deserted.  The fort was razed to the ground, and although  the huts were still standing they were choked with weeds and  overgrown with wild vines, while deer wandered in and out of the  open doors.  It was plain that for many months no man had lived  there.  And although careful search was made, saving the bones of  one, no sign was found of the fifteen men left there by Sir Richard.  At length the new colonists learned from a few friendly Indians  that they had been traitorously set upon by hostile Indians.  Most  of them were slain; the others escaped in their boat and went no  man knew whither.    The Englishmen were very angry when they heard that, and wanted to  punish the Indians.  So they set out against them.  But the Indians  fled at their coming, and the Englishmen by mistake killed some  of the friendly Indians instead of their enemies.  Thus things were  made worse instead of better.    And now amid all these troubles on the 18th of August, 1587, a  little girl was born.  Her father was Ananias Dare, and her mother  was the daughter of John White, the Governor.  The little baby was  thus the grand-daughter of the Governor, and because she was the  first English child to be born in Virginia she was called Virginia.    But matters were not going well in the colony.  Day by day the men  were finding out things which were lacking and which they felt  they must have if they were not all to perish.  So a few days after  Virginia was christened all the chief men came to the Governor and  begged him to go back to England to get fresh supplies, and other  things necessary to the life of the colony.  John White, however,  refused to go.  The next day not only the men but the women also came  to him and again begged him to go back to England.  They begged so  hard that at last the Governor consented to go.    All were agreed that the place they were now in was by no means the  best which might be chosen for a colony, and it had been determined  that they should move some fifty miles further inland.  Now it was  arranged that if they moved while the Governor was away they should  carve on the trees and posts of the door the name of the place to  which they had gone, so that on his return he might be able easily  to find them.  And also it was arranged that if they were in any  trouble or distress they should carve a cross over the name.    All these matters being settled John White set forth.  And it was  with great content that the colonists saw their Governor go.  For  they knew that they could send home no better man to look after  their welfare, and they were sure he would bring back the food and  other things which were needed.    But when White arrived in England he found that no man, not even  Raleigh, had a thought to spare for Virginia.  For Spain was making  ready all her mighty sea power to crush England.  And the English  were straining every nerve to meet and break that power.  So John  White had to wait with what patience he could.  Often his heart was  sick when he thought of his daughter and his little granddaughter,  Virginia Dare, far away in that great unknown land across the sea.  Often he longed to be back beside them.  But his longings were of no  avail.  He could but wait.  For every ship was seized by Government  and pressed into the service of the country.  And while the Spaniards  were at the gate it was accounted treason for any Englishman to  sail to western lands.    So the summer of 1588 passed, the autumn came, and at length the  great Armada sailed from Spain.  It sailed across the narrow seas  in pride and splendour, haughtily certain of crushing the insolent  sea dogs of England.  But \"God blew with His breath and they were  scattered.\" Before many days were over these proud ships were fleeing  before the storm, their sails torn, their masts splintered.  They  were shattered upon the rocky shores of Scotland and Ireland.  They  were swallowed by the deep.    The sea power of Spain was broken, and the history of America truly  began.  For as has been said \"the defeat of the Invincible Armada  was the opening event in the history of the United States.\"    Free now from the dread of Spain, ships could come and go without  hindrance.  But another year and more passed before John White  succeeded in getting ships and provisions and setting out once more  for Virginia.    It was for him an anxious voyage, but as he neared the place where  the colony had been, his heart rejoiced, for he saw smoke rising  from the land.  It was dark, however, before they reached the spot,  and seeing no lights save that of a huge fire far in the woods  the Governor sounded a trumpet call.  The notes of the trumpet rang  through the woods and died away to silence.  There was no answer.  So  the men called and called again, but still no answer came.  Then  with sinking heart John White bade them sing some well-known English  songs.  For that, he thought, would surely bring an answer from the  shore.    So through the still night air the musical sound of men's voices  rang out.  But still no answer came from the silent fort.  With a  heart heavy as lead the Governor waited for the dawn.  As soon as it  was light he went ashore.  The fort was deserted.  Grass and weeds  grew in the ruined houses.  But upon a post \"in fair capital letters\"  was carved the word \"Croatoan.\" This was the name of a neighbouring  island inhabited by friendly Indians.  There was no cross or sign  of distress carved over the letters.  And when the Governor saw that  he was greatly comforted.    He spent some time searching about for other signs of the colonists.  In one place he found some iron and lead thrown aside as if too  heavy to carry away, and now overgrown with weeds.  In another he  found five chests which had evidently been buried by the colonists,  and dug up again by the Indians.    They had been burst open and the contents lay scattered about the  grass.  Three of these chests John White saw were his own, and it  grieved him greatly to see his things spoiled and broken.

One of the senators went to Cambaceres, and said, \"What would be  gratifying to General Bonaparte? Does he wish to be king? Only let  him say so, and we are all ready to vote for the re-establishment  of royalty. Most willingly will we do it for him, for he is worthy  of that station.\" But the First Consul shut himself up in impenetrable  reserve. Even his most intimate friends could catch no glimpse of  his secret wishes. At last the question was plainly and earnestly  put to him. With great apparent humility, he replied: \"I have not  fixed my mind upon any thing. Any testimony of the public confidence  will be sufficient for me, and will fill me with satisfaction.\"  The question was then discussed whether to add ten years to his  Consulship, or to make him First Consul for life. Cambaceres knew  well the boundless ambition of Napoleon, and was fully conscious,  that any limited period of power would not be in accordance with  his plans. He ventured to say to him \"You are wrong not to explain  yourself. Your enemies, for notwithstanding your services, you have  some left even in the Senate, will abuse your reserve.\" Napoleon  calmly replied: \"Let them alone. The majority of the Senate is  always ready to do more than it is asked. They will go further than  you imagine.\"    On the evening of the 8th of May, 1802, the resolution was adopted,  of prolonging the powers of the First Consul for ten years . Napoleon  was probably surprised and disappointed. He however, decided to  return a grateful answer, and to say that from the Senate, but from  the suffrages of the people alone could he accept a prolongation  of that power to which their voices had elevated him. The following  answer was transmitted to the Senate, the next morning:    \"The honorable proof of your esteem, given in your deliberation  of the 8th, will remain forever engraven on my heart. In the three  years which have just elapsed fortune has smiled upon the republic.  But fortune is fickle. How many men whom she has loaded with favors,  have lived a few years too long. The interest of my glory and that  of my happiness, would seem to have marked the term of my public  life, at the moment when the peace of the world is proclaimed. But  the glory and the happiness of the citizen ought to be silent, when  the interest of the state, and the public partiality, call him. You  judge that I owe a new sacrifice to the people. I will make it, if  the wishes of the people command what your suffrage authorizes.\"    Napoleon immediately left Paris for his country-seat at Malmaison.  This beautiful chateau was about ten miles from the metropolis.  Josephine had purchased the peaceful, rural retreat at Napoleon's  request during his first Italian campaign. Subsequently, large  sums had been expended in enlarging and improving the grounds; and  it was ever the favorite the grounds; and it was ever the favorite  residence of both Josephine and Napoleon. Cambacres called an extraordinary  meeting of the Council of State. After much deliberation, it was  resolved, by an immense majority, that the following preposition  should be submitted to the people: \"Shall Napoleon Bonaparte be  the First Consul for life? It was then resolved to submit a second  question: \" Shall the First Consul have the power of appointing  his successor? This was indeed re-establishing monarchy, under a  republican name.    Cambaceres immediately repaired to Malmaison, to submit these  resolutions to Napoleon. To the amazement of all, he immediately  and firmly rejected the second question. Energetically, he said  \"Whom would you have me appoint my successor? on brothers? But  will France which has consented to be governed by Joseph or Lucien?  Shall I nominate you consul, Cambceres? You? Dare you undertake  such a task? And then the will of Louis XIV was not respected; it  is likely that mine would be? A dead man, let him be who he will,  is nobody.\" In opposition to all urgency, he ordered the second  question to be erased, and the first only to be submitted to the  people. It is impossible to divine the motive which influenced  Napoleon in the most unexpected decision. Some have supposed that  even then he had in view the Empire and the hereditary monarchy,  and that he wished to leave a chasm in the organization of the  government, as a reason for future change. Others have supposed  that he dreaded the rivalries which would arise among his brothers  and his nephews, from his having his disposal so resplendent a gift  as the Empire of France. But the historian treads upon dangerous  ground, when he begins to judge of motives. That which Napoleon  actually did was moderate and noble in the highest degree. He  declined the power of appointing his successor, and submitted his  election to the suffrages of the people. A majority of 3,568,885  voted for the Consulate for life, and only eight thousands and  a few hundreds, against it. Never before, or since, was an early  government established by such unamitity. Never had a monarch a  more indisputable title to his throne. Upon this occasion Lafayette  added to his vote these or qualifying words: \"I can not vote for  such a magistracy, until public freed sufficiently guarantied. When  that is done, I give my voice to Napoleon Bonaparte.\" In a private  conversation with the First Consul, he added: \"A free government,  and you at its head-that comprehends all my desires.\" Napoleon  remarked: In theory Lafayette is perhaps right. But what is theory?  A mere dream, when applied to the masses of mankind. He think he  is still in the United States--as if the French were Americans. He  has no conception of what is required for this country.\"    A day was fixed for a grand diplomatic festival, when Napoleon  should receive the congratulations of the constituted authorities,  and of the foreign embassadors. The soldiers, in brilliant uniform,  formed a double line, from the Tuileries to the Luxembourg. The First  Consul was seated in a magnificent chariot, drawn by eight horses.  A cortege of gorgeous splendor accompanied him. All Paris thronged  the streets through which he passed, and the most enthusiastic  applause rent the heavens. To the congratulatory address of the Senate,  Napoleon replied: \"The life of a citizen belongs to his country.  The French nation wishes that mine should be wholly consecrated to  France. I obey its will. Through my efforts, by your assistance,  citizen-senators, by the aid of the authorities, and by the confidence  and support of this mighty people, the liberty, equality and  prosperity of France will be rendered secure against the caprices of  fate, and the uncertainty of futurity. The most virtuous of nations  will be the most happy, as it deserves to be; and its felicity will  contribute to the general happiness of all Europe. Proud then of  being thus called, by the command of that Power from which every  thing emanates, to bring back order, justice, and equality to the  earth, when my last hour approaches, I shall yield myself up with  resignation, and, without any solicitude respecting the opinions  of future generations.\"    On the following day the new articles, modifying the constitution  in accordance with the change in the consulship, were submitted  to the Council of State. The First Consul presided, and with his  accustomed vigor and perspicuity, explained the reasons of each  article, as he recounted them one by one. The articles contained  the provision that Napoleon should nominate his successor to the  Senate. To this, after a slight resistance, he yielded, The most  profound satisfaction now pervaded France. Even Josephine began  to be tranquil and happy She imagined that all thoughts of royalty  and of hereditary succession had now passed away. She contemplated  with no uneasiness the power which Napoleon sympathized cordially  with her in her high gratification that Hortense was soon to become  a mother. This child was already, in their hearts, the selected heir  to the power of Napoleon. On the 15th of August, Paris magnificiently  celebrated the anniversary of the birth-day of the First Consul.  This was another introduction of monarchical usages. All the high  authorities of the Church and the State, and the foreign diplomatic  bodies, called upon him with congratulations. At noon, in all  the churches of the metropolis, a Te Deun was sung, in gratitude  to God for the gift of Napoleon. At night the city blazed with  illuminations. The splendors and the etiquette of royalty were now  rapidly introduced; and the same fickle populace who had so recently  trampled princes and thrones into blood and ruin, were now captivated  with re-introduction of these discarded splendors. Napoleon soon  established himself in the beautiful chateau of St. Cloud, which he  has caused to be repaired with great magnificence. On the Sabbath the  First Consul, with Josephine, invariably attended divine service.  Their example was soon followed by most of the members of the  court, and the nation as a body returned to Christianity, which,  even in its most corrupt form, saves humanity from those abysses  of degradation into which infidelity plunges it. Immediately after  divine service he conversed in the gallery of the chateau with  the visitors who were then waiting for him. The brilliance of  his intellect, and his high renown, caused him to be approached  with emotions of awe. His words were listened to with intensest  eagerness. He was the exclusive object of observation and attention.  No earthly potentate had ever attained such a degree of homage,  pure and sincere, as now circled around the First Consul.    Napoleon was very desirous of having his court a model of decorum  and of morals. Lucien owned a beautiful rural mansion near  Neuilly. Upon one occasion he invited Napoleon, and all the inmates  of Malmaison, to attend some private theatricals at"]]]
