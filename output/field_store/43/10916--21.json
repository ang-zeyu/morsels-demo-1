Which she and many other ladies  perceiving, made merry together more than once, to see a man of his years  and discretion in love, as if they deemed that this most delightful passion  of love were only fit for empty-headed youths, and could not in men be  either harboured or engendered. Master Alberto thus continuing to haunt the  front of the house, it so happened that one feast-day the lady with other  ladies was seated before her door, and Master Alberto's approach being thus  observed by them for some time before he arrived, they complotted to receive  him and shew him honour, and then to rally him on his love; and so they did,  rising with one accord to receive him, bidding him welcome, and ushering him  into a cool courtyard, where they regaled him with the finest wines and  comfits; which done, in a tone of refined and sprightly banter they asked  him how it came about that he was enamoured of this fair lady, seeing that  she was beloved of many a fine gentleman of youth and spirit. Master  Alberto, being thus courteously assailed, put a blithe face on it, and  answered:--\"Madam, my love for you need surprise none that is conversant  with such matters, and least of all you that are worthy of it. And though  old men, of course, have lost the strength which love demands for its full  fruition, yet are they not therefore without the good intent and just  appreciation of what beseems the accepted lover, but indeed understand it  far better than young men, by reason that they have more experience. My hope  in thus old aspiring to love you, who are loved by so many young men, is  founded on what I have frequently observed of ladies' ways at lunch, when  they trifle with the lupin and the leek. In the leek no part is good, but  the head is at any rate not so bad as the rest, and indeed not unpalatable;  you, however, for the most part, following a depraved taste, hold it in your  hand and munch the leaves, which are not only of no account but actually  distasteful. How am I to know, madam, that in your selection of lovers, you  are not equally eccentric? In which case I should be the man of your choice,  and the rest would be cast aside.\" Whereto the gentle lady, somewhat  shame-stricken, as were also her fair friends, thus made answer:--\"Master  Alberto, our presumption has received from you a most just and no less  courteous reproof; but your love is dear to me, as should ever be that of a  wise and worthy man. And therefore, saving my honour, I am yours, entirely  and devotedly at your pleasure and command.\" This speech brought Master  Alberto to his feet, and the others also rising, he thanked the lady for her  courtesy, bade her a gay and smiling adieu, and so left the house. Thus the  lady, not considering on whom she exercised her wit, thinking to conquer was  conquered herself--against which mishap you, if you are discreet, will ever  be most strictly on your guard.    As the young ladies and the three young men finished their storytelling the  sun was westering and the heat of the day in great measure abated. Which  their queen observing, debonairly thus she spoke:--\"Now, dear gossips, my  day of sovereignty draws to a close, and nought remains for me to do but to  give you a new queen, by whom on the morrow our common life may be ordered  as she may deem best in a course of seemly pleasure; and though there seems  to be still some interval between day and night, yet, as whoso does not in  some degree anticipate the course of time, cannot well provide for the  future; and in order that what the new queen shall decide to be meet for the  morrow may be made ready beforehand, I decree that from this time forth the  days begin at this hour. And so in reverent submission to Him in whom is the  life of all beings, for our comfort and solace we commit the governance of  our realm for the morrow into the hands of Queen Filomena, most discreet of  damsels.\" So saying she arose, took the laurel wreath from her brow, and  with a gesture of reverence set it on the brow of Filomena, whom she then,  and after her all the other ladies and the young men, saluted as queen,  doing her due and graceful homage.    Queen Filomena modestly blushed a little to find herself thus invested with  the sovereignty; but, being put on her mettle by Pampinea's recent  admonitions, she was minded not to seem awkward, and soon recovered her  composure. She then began by confirming all the appointments made by  Pampinea, and making all needful arrangements for the following morning and  evening, which they were to pass where they then were. Whereupon she thus  spoke:--\"Dearest gossips, though, thanks rather to Pampinea's courtesy than  to merit of mine, I am made queen of you all, yet I am not on that account  minded to have respect merely to my own judgment in the governance of our  life, but to unite your wisdom with mine; and that you may understand what I  think of doing, and by consequence may be able to amplify or curtail it at  your pleasure, I will in few words make known to you my purpose. The course  observed by Pampinea to-day, if I have judged aright, seems to be alike  commendable and delectable; wherefore, until by lapse of time, or for some  other cause, it grow tedious, I purpose not to alter it. So when we have  arranged for what we have already taken in hand, we will go hence and enjoy  a short walk; at sundown we will sup in the cool; and we will then sing a  few songs and otherwise divert ourselves, until it is time to go to sleep.  To-morrow we will rise in the cool of the morning, and after enjoying  another walk, each at his or her sweet will, we will return, as to-day, and  in due time break our fast, dance, sleep, and having risen, will here resume  our story-telling, wherein, methinks, pleasure and profit unite in  superabundant measure. True it is that Pampinea, by reason of her late  election to the sovereignty, neglected one matter, which I mean to  introduce, to wit, the circumscription of the topic of our story-telling,  and its preassignment, that each may be able to premeditate some apt story  bearing upon the theme; and seeing that from the beginning of the world  Fortune has made men the sport of divers accidents, and so it will continue  until the end, the theme, so please you, shall in each case be the same; to  wit, the fortune of such as after divers adventures have at last attained a  goal of unexpected felicity.    The ladies and the young men alike commended the rule thus laid down, and  agreed to follow it. Dioneo, however, when the rest had done speaking,  said:--\"Madam, as all the rest have said, so say I, briefly, that the rule  prescribed by you is commendable and delectable; but of your especial grace  I crave a favour, which, I trust, may be granted and continued to me, so  long as our company shall endure; which favour is this: that I be not bound  by the assigned theme if I am not so minded, but that I have leave to choose  such topic as best shall please me. And lest any suppose that I crave this  grace as one that has not stories ready to hand, I am henceforth content  that mine be always the last.\" The queen, knowing him to be a merry and  facetious fellow, and feeling sure that he only craved this favour in order  that, if the company were jaded, he might have an opportunity to recreate  them by some amusing story, gladly, with the consent of the rest, granted  his petition. She then rose, and attended by the rest sauntered towards a  stream, which, issuing clear as crystal from a neighbouring hill,  precipitated itself into a valley shaded by trees close set amid living rock  and fresh green herbage. Bare of foot and arm they entered the stream, and  roving hither and thither amused themselves in divers ways till in due time  they returned to the palace, and gaily supped. Supper ended, the queen sent  for instruments of music, and bade Lauretta lead a dance, while Emilia was  to sing a song accompanied by Dioneo on the lute.    Accordingly Lauretta led a dance, while Emilia with passion sang the  following song:    So fain I am of my own loveliness,      I hope, nor think not e'er    The weight to feel of other amorousness.    When in the mirror I my face behold,    That see I there which doth my mind content,    Nor any present hap or memory old    May me deprive of such sweet ravishment.    Where else, then, should I find such blandishment       Of sight and sense that e'er    My heart should know another amorousness?    Nor need I fear lest the fair thing retreat,    When fain I am my solace to renew;    Rather, I know, 'twill me advance to meet,    To pleasure me, and shew so sweet a view    That speech or thought of none its semblance true       Paint or conceive may e'er,    Unless he burn with ev'n such amorousness.    Thereon as more intent I gaze, the fire    Waxeth within me hourly, more and more,    Myself I yield thereto, myself entire,    And foretaste have of what it hath in store,    And hope of greater joyance than before,      Nay, such as ne'er    None knew; for ne'er was felt such amorousness.    This ballade, to which all heartily responded, albeit its words furnished  much matter of thought to some, was followed by some other dances, and part  of the brief night being thus spent, the queen proclaimed the first day  ended, and bade light the torches that all might go to rest until the  following morning; and so, seeking their several chambers, to rest they  went.      --  Endeth here the first day of the Decameron; beginneth the second, in which,  under the rule of Filomena, they discourse of the fortunes of such as after  divers misadventures have at last attained a goal of unexpected felicity.  --    The sun was already trailing the new day in his wake of light, and the  birds, blithely chanting their lays among the green boughs, carried the  tidings to the ear, when with one accord all the ladies and the three young  men arose, and entered the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],[0,"The Domestic Cat (#17)"],[1," pelage.  I am convinced, for  instance, that boiled bullock's lights do, and so does sheep's blood.  This fact is perhaps worth knowing.  I am making experiments with other  foods and some condiments, but am not yet in a position to state  results.    _Sixthly.  Breeding for colour_.  No matter what colour your parent cats  are, you will occasionally find waifs and strays in a litter that you  will wonder to find of a different colour.  But do not be discouraged;  stick only to the true colours, and you will find in time that such  anomalies will become few and far between.  Be careful to avoid the  possibility of any litter of kittens having more than one father.    _Seventhly_.  In young cats, which you are breeding to take prizes with,  begin to look out for symptoms of the queen's getting gay, any time  after six months, and on the first signs lock her up for a week, or  until she becomes herself again.  Do not think of breeding from a cat  you mean for the show-bench until she is at least eighteen months old,  else you will spoil her for size.    Some people fancy that to manage cats properly, and guide their breeding  to the Tom you desire them to, is very difficult.  I have not found it  so.  There is a little trouble, certainly, but you are amply rewarded,  when you find on the birth of the kittens that you have been successful.  The only thing you've got to do, is to watch the queen well, and lock  her up for a night or two with her own lord in an outhouse.  Then  afterwards keep her prisoner by herself for ten days.  The danger is  quite past then.    _Eighthly_.  About a week before any important show, be more than  usually careful with the grooming, etc, of your cats, and feed them up a  bit; give them an extra allowance of milk and cream, and boiled rice and  sugar, and occasionally mutton and mutton-broth, but take great care not  to induce diarrhoea.    _Ninthly_.  Send them to the show in a basket lined with flannel and a  cushion, and pretty collar or ribbon to match the colour of the coat.  Let the colour of the cushion be also effective, and in keeping with  pussy's jacket.    As to cat-shows themselves, I have nothing but good to say.  All  prosperity to their promoters and patrons!  They are in general, indeed  almost invariably, well managed, and the cats are carefully caged,  properly tended and fed, and no lady need apprehend the slightest danger  to her feline favourite, in being sent to any of our great shows.  It is  seldom, if ever, that a cat is lost, the baskets containing the pussies  never being opened, until inside the building, and then only with the  greatest care.  Indeed, one needs to be pretty cautious in handling a  strange cat.  Your well-bred beauties, in particular, make it a rule to  stand no nonsense.    The cats are fed morning and night, and regularly supplied with the best  and sweetest milk which the town can afford.  Indeed, altogether, the  poor things appear quite as happy as they are at their own firesides.  If it is a four-day show, they soon come to know and welcome with gloved  hand, the girl attendants every time they pass.  There is no  head-splitting noise and din as there is in a dog-show.  Peace and quiet  and serenity reign everywhere in a cat-show.    At nearly all the shows--at all events at all the _great_ shows--Mr  Sillet, the well-known naturalist of Southampton, has the arrangement of  the pens or cages for the pussies.  And very well he does his work too.  Every cage is supplied with a box for sand at the back, and in the fore  part with a beautiful soft cushion.  The boxes are emptied daily, and  disinfectants are also used, so that everything is sweet and clean.  The  entries at some of our national shows, such as the Crystal Palace and  Birmingham, number between three and four hundred, and every year I  trust the numbers will be increased.    You see then, reader, that no danger can accrue from sending your feline  favourite to a show, and I may tell you also that if she is anything  like good at all, she is almost sure of finding herself placed.  Cat-shows are only in their infancy, and anyone who _chances_ to have a  good cat, may nowadays take prizes.  In future years, there will be no  chance work about the matter at all, and those only who study the  breeding and rearing of cats in a scientific and sensible manner will be  the winners.    When you send your entry form up to the secretary, be careful you have  placed your pussy in the right class, not only as to breed but as to  sex, whether male, female, or gelded.  As to breed, you must attend to  the colour and also to the length of the coat.    There are classes for all kinds of cats, and a class for anomalies  besides.    I am often sorry, when judging at shows, to have to disqualify many a  beautiful specimen of the feline race, because it has been carelessly  entered in a wrong class.  If people only will read with some degree of  attention the description of each class, given in the schedules, they  need never make this mistake.    To such clever and energetic managers of shows as Mr Wilson, of the  Crystal Palace, who seems to have adopted the motto of the Cameron clan,  \"Whatever a man dares he can do,\" or sensible Mr Chaplin, of  Birmingham, or Mr Brown, of Edinburgh, or Mr Martin, of Glasgow, I  have positively nothing to suggest.  Let anyone who wants to get up a  cat-show take a lesson out of the books of either.    To amateur managers I may say this: Be very tender and gentle with the  feline property entrusted to your care; remember not only that cats are  extremely nervous and sensitive creatures, but also that numbers of them  have a value in the eyes of their owners far above money and above  price.    Feed with Spratt's Patent Cat Food.  This ought to be used at all shows;  it has the advantage of being cleanly, handy, and wholesome.  A small  allowance of boiled lights may be added.    Use chloride of lime, not too much of it, as a disinfectant.    Fill the utility boxes with plain garden mould or sand, but _never put  charcoal in it_.  That soils the fur, and doesn't give a white cat the  chance of looking well.    _Never put sawdust in a cat's cage_.  It gets into the milk and spoils  it, and if they lick it it will make them ill.    Do not receive a cat that is suffering from illness of any sort.    If a cat should appear to be ill any time during the exhibition, have  her carefully removed and sent home.    Finally, if possible, have beautifully ornamented prize cards, and send  them home neat and clean to the successful exhibitors.  These cards are  greatly valued, and generally framed and hung in a conspicuous place.    No one, except the initiated, can have any idea what an important little  creature a cat becomes that has once taken a prize.  She is then more  than ever the valued pet of her owners, and an object of interest even  to the neighbours.    CHAPTER NINETEEN.    ON CRUELTY TO CATS.      \"He prayeth well, who loveth well,        Both man, and bird, and beast;    He prayeth best, who loveth best,        All things both great and small,    For the dear God who loveth us,        He made and loveth all.\"      Coleridge.    I am fond of cats, and am never happier than when I am writing about  them; nevertheless, it is with feelings the very reverse of pleasant  that I commence the present chapter.  Were I to consult my own comfort,  I should avoid the subject of cruelty to cats, and it is only with the  hope, that I may be the means of doing some little good to poor harmless  pussy, that I approach the matter at all.    I am not a sentimentalist by any means, yet I abominate wanton cruelty.  I am fond of animals, yet not maudlinly so.  I am not a vegetarian; and,  although I neither believe that all animals were made for man's use, nor  that man was made for theirs (as, you remember, was the opinion of the  pampered goose), still I think we are right to kill and to use them as  food.  So I am fond of fishing, and fond too of shooting, and I can see  nothing in the Bible against either practice.  The very reverse, indeed,  and everywhere in nature we observe that God permits one animal to prey  upon another; and can the Lord Himself do wrong?    Yet, albeit I love sport and shooting, I do not think I am cruel.  All  my animals love me.  My fishes know me, and come to be fed; my birds  flutter their wings with affectionate excitement when I approach their  cage; my white rats run to me when I call; my cat certainly never rushes  up the chimney when I enter the room; and when I am dead I know my dogs  will miss me.    Now, what I particularly object to is wanton and unnecessary cruelty.  If we have to, and must, put the lower animals to death, in order that  we--the higher animals--may live, we ought to do so as humanely as  possible; and never, on any account, should we torture animals for mere  sport.  Hence I object to cock-fighting, pigeon or sparrow-shooting, and  ratting--all mean and cowardly employments, and quite unfitted for men  above the rank of the commonest navvy.  I see no harm in deer-stalking  in Scotland, where the deer are as wild as the hare or coney; but I do  see very great cruelty in what is called stag-hunting in England.  The  stag in England is a domesticated animal, and I do not see that there is  greater pluck or courage needed in hunting it, than there would be in  chasing a decent old Alderney cow.  I had travelled pretty nearly all  over the world, and had shot in Africa, India, and Greenland, before I  witnessed the first English stag-hunt.  If my sympathies had not been  all with the poor stag, I should have been highly amused indeed.  The  first stag wouldn't move at all; he looked upon the matter as too good a  joke.  \"No, beggar me,\" he seemed to say, \"if I'll budge an inch, to  please anybody!\"  And he didn't.  Yet this stag-hunting, they will tell  you, seriously, keeps up the national courage.  Believe me, reader,"]]]
