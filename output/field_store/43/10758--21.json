His  capital is at Sabbia, in the maritime foot-hills, with a very trying  climate. Asir might suit the naturalist or explorer who could adapt  himself to his environment and respect local prejudice. No one has yet  entered the country in either capacity, but, from what has been told me  before the War by intelligent Turkish officers who campaigned there, I  think that the birds and smaller mammals would repay research, while the  great Dawasir valley and other geographical problems inland might be  investigated with advantage under the _aegis_ of local chiefs. All that  is required, besides the necessary scientific knowledge and Arabic, is a  certain amount of perseverance and resolution blended with a reasonable  regard for other people's convictions. Most Arabian expeditions fail  through lack of time spent in preliminary steps. I have tripped up in  that way myself, but it was owing to the restrictions of a paternal  Government, and not through lack of patience. Before I started serious  exploration in the Aden hinterland I spent a year on the littoral plain  getting in touch with the people and mastering the dialect. Any success  I may have had up-country was due to the foundation I laid in those  early days, and it was not until the Aden authorities closed their  sphere of influence against exploration in general and myself in  particular that my expeditions began to miss fire, as I had to land at  remote places along the coast and hasten up-country before their  fostering care could set the tribes on me. He who would explore Asir  should take a Khedivial mail steamer from Suez to Jeddah, and there show  his credentials and explain his purpose to his consul and the local  authorities. The Idrisi has an agent there, and it should not be  difficult to pick up an Asiri dhow returning down the coast to Gizan,  which is the port for Sabbia. He would have to stay there until he got  the Idrisi's permit and an escort, without which he would be held up to  a certainty. In any case, no such enterprise need be contemplated until  Asiri affairs have settled down a good deal.    In Yamen proper it should be feasible to travel again within certain  limits as soon as the Imam can come to an understanding with the tribal  chiefs. There is not much left for the explorer or naturalist to do,  unless he goes very far inland toward the great central desert, which  project is not likely to be encouraged by the local authorities. There  is, however, a possible field for the mineralogist and prospector east  and south-east of Sanaa, which area also contains Sabaean ruins and  inscriptions of interest to the archaeologist.    The northern boundary of Yamen may be said nowadays to trend north-east  from Loheia inland through highland country to the desert borders of  Nejran (once a Christian diocese). Its eastern border is very vague,  but may be said to coincide approximately with the 45th parallel of  longitude. Southward the limit has been clearly defined by the  Anglo-Turkish Boundary Commission of 1902-5 inland from the Bana valley,  about a hundred map-miles north of Aden, to the straits of  Bab-el-Mandeb.    Within these limits the two great divisions of Islam are represented in  force--the orthodox _Sunnis_ on the littoral plain and far inland along  the upland deserts, while the highlanders among the lofty fertile ranges  separating these two areas and forming the backbone of the country  follow the _Shiah_ schism, being Zeidis, which of all the schismatic  sects approaches most nearly to orthodox Islam and regards Mecca as its  pilgrim-centre. The feeling between these two religious divisions may be  compared with that existing between Anglicans and Catholics. They will  occasionally use each other's places of worship--more especially the  upper or governing classes--and seldom come to open loggerheads; when  they do, it is usually about politics, and not religion. At the same  time, if you, as a Christian traveller among both parties, want a  scathing opinion of a Zeidi, you will get it from an orthodox lowlander,  and the men of the mountains reciprocate with point and weight, for the  balance of religious culture and position is with them among the big  hill-centres; including Sanaa, the political capital where the Imam  holds, or should hold, his court as hereditary ruler spiritual and  temporal. This ecclesiastical potentate has backed the Turk in a  non-committal but flamboyant manner during the War up to the turning of  the tide against them, when he sat on the fence until his Turkish  subsidy ceased. He now looks to Western diplomacy in general and the  British Government in particular not only to continue but to enhance  this subsidy, in order that he may really govern in Yamen. His attitude  throughout is natural and, indeed, justifiable in the interests of  himself and his dynasty; at least occidental politicians cannot cavil at  his motives; but what they ought to ascertain is how far he can fill the  bill as a ruler in Yamen and the extent to which he should be backed.  Without a considerable subsidy his administrative powers (not hitherto  very marked) will not carry far even in the highlands.    Missionaries were allowed to enter Yamen before the War, but did not  establish themselves, even on the coast. Some of them went up-country  and stayed there some time without being molested. The average Yameni is  not fanatical by temperament; there is more bigotry among the urban Jew  colonies than in the whole Moslem countryside.    In the Aden protectorate there has been long established the Falconer  Medical Mission, which, though actually at Sheikh Othman, just inside  the British border, has done splendid work among natives of the  hinterland, who visit it from all parts. Its relations with the Arabs  have always been excellent, though the local ruffians looted the Mission  when the Turks held Sheikh Othman temporarily.    The province of Hadhramaut, politically, includes not only the vast  valley of that name with its tributaries, but the whole of the western  part of Southern Arabia outside the Aden protectorate from the Yamen  border to the confines of Oman near longitude 55. Mokalla is the capital  and principal port. Missionaries have been well received there by the  enlightened ruler--a member of the Kaaiti house with the local title of  Jemadar, inherited from an ancestor who soldiered in the Arab bodyguard  of a former Nizam at Haiderabad. The interior is not suited to  missionary enterprise.    Muscat, the capital of Oman, has already been occupied by missionaries.  The Sultan (at whose court there is a British Resident) is well-disposed,  but has lost most of his influence inland.    Further up the Persian Gulf missionaries have long been established on  the islands of Bahrein, which are under British protection.    Continuing our journey eastward, we can dismiss the Shiahs of Persia as  outside our pan-Islamic calculations, for their pilgrim-centre is at  Kerbela, some twenty odd miles west of the Euphrates and the site of  ancient Babylon. This centre has been visited by missionaries.    Afghanistan and Beluchistan both bar missionaries, but there are C.M.S.  frontier posts from Quetta, in British Beluchistan, to Peshawar, near  the Afghan border. They do good hospital work, otherwise their  evangelising activities over the border are confined to native  colporteurs and the circulation of vernacular Scriptures. There is a  fierce and barbarous Turcoman spirit in both countries which their  respective rulers (the Khan of Kelat and the Emir at Cabul) do their  best to keep within bounds, aided by British Residents. Missionaries  seem to think this spirit can be exorcised by their entrance into the  arena. You might as well throw squibs into a cage full of tigers.    On entering India (that vast hunting-ground of many sects and creeds),  Moslem and missionary are almost swamped in the flood of Hinduism. There  is no restriction on the activities of either within the four corners  of the King-Emperor's peace, and there is very little antagonism between  the two in so big a field, where both are doing good work. Although the  Moslems outnumber the Christians by seven to one, the honours of war go  to the missionaries. Their highly-organised medical and educational  missions do excellent work--the Zenana Mission is, in itself, a  justification of Christian mission work in India to any humanitarian  with some knowledge of _zenana_ conditions. The Moslems, on the other  hand, in spite of their high standard of education, in India show a  tendency among their less educated classes toward the caste prejudices  of Hinduism, which are dead against the teaching of Islam and a handicap  to any social organisation.    Few people realise what a huge proposition the Indian Empire is to solve  in its entirety, with its population of 315 millions, of whom over 90  per cent. are illiterate. Of the more or less educated residuum, not  quite 90 per cent. are Brahmins having little in common with the huge  uneducated bulk of the population, which is chiefly agricultural and, by  its patient toil, supplies most of the wealth of India. Yet it is the  cultured but unproductive Brahmin (organised by a brainy old lady) who  wants to control the native affairs of India--and probably will.    In Farther India the Brahmin is at a discount and the Buddhist is to the  fore, while Moslem and missionary are far too busy among the heathen to  bother about each other; as also in Malay, where there is field enough  and to spare for both of them.    The only other debatable field in Asia is that vast area which we call  China, comprising China proper, Manchuria, Mongolia, Tibet and Eastern  Turkestan.

I should be more particular about  the place than the money he would fetch.\"    After this they left us.    \"They'll soon take you away,\" said Ginger, \"and I shall lose the only  friend I have, and most likely we shall never see each other again. 'Tis  a hard world!\"    About a week after this Robert came into the field with a halter, which  he slipped over my head, and led me away. There was no leave-taking  of Ginger; we neighed to each other as I was led off, and she trotted  anxiously along by the hedge, calling to me as long as she could hear  the sound of my feet.    Through the recommendation of York, I was bought by the master of the  livery stables. I had to go by train, which was new to me, and required  a good deal of courage the first time; but as I found the puffing,  rushing, whistling, and, more than all, the trembling of the horse-box  in which I stood did me no real harm, I soon took it quietly.    When I reached the end of my journey I found myself in a tolerably  comfortable stable, and well attended to. These stables were not so  airy and pleasant as those I had been used to. The stalls were laid on  a slope instead of being level, and as my head was kept tied to the  manger, I was obliged always to stand on the slope, which was very  fatiguing. Men do not seem to know yet that horses can do more work if  they can stand comfortably and can turn about; however, I was well fed  and well cleaned, and, on the whole, I think our master took as much  care of us as he could. He kept a good many horses and carriages of  different kinds for hire. Sometimes his own men drove them; at  others, the horse and chaise were let to gentlemen or ladies who drove  themselves.          28 A Job Horse and His Drivers      Hitherto I had always been driven by people who at least knew how to  drive; but in this place I was to get my experience of all the different  kinds of bad and ignorant driving to which we horses are subjected; for  I was a \"job horse\", and was let out to all sorts of people who wished  to hire me; and as I was good-tempered and gentle, I think I was oftener  let out to the ignorant drivers than some of the other horses, because  I could be depended upon. It would take a long time to tell of all the  different styles in which I was driven, but I will mention a few of  them.    First, there were the tight-rein drivers--men who seemed to think that  all depended on holding the reins as hard as they could, never relaxing  the pull on the horse's mouth, or giving him the least liberty of  movement. They are always talking about \"keeping the horse well in  hand\", and \"holding a horse up\", just as if a horse was not made to hold  himself up.    Some poor, broken-down horses, whose mouths have been made hard and  insensible by just such drivers as these, may, perhaps, find some  support in it; but for a horse who can depend upon his own legs, and who  has a tender mouth and is easily guided, it is not only tormenting, but  it is stupid.    Then there are the loose-rein drivers, who let the reins lie easily on  our backs, and their own hand rest lazily on their knees. Of course,  such gentlemen have no control over a horse, if anything happens  suddenly. If a horse shies, or starts, or stumbles, they are nowhere,  and cannot help the horse or themselves till the mischief is done. Of  course, for myself I had no objection to it, as I was not in the habit  either of starting or stumbling, and had only been used to depend on my  driver for guidance and encouragement. Still, one likes to feel the rein  a little in going downhill, and likes to know that one's driver is not  gone to sleep.    Besides, a slovenly way of driving gets a horse into bad and often lazy  habits, and when he changes hands he has to be whipped out of them with  more or less pain and trouble. Squire Gordon always kept us to our best  paces and our best manners. He said that spoiling a horse and letting  him get into bad habits was just as cruel as spoiling a child, and both  had to suffer for it afterward.    Besides, these drivers are often careless altogether, and will attend to  anything else more than their horses. I went out in the phaeton one day  with one of them; he had a lady and two children behind. He flopped the  reins about as we started, and of course gave me several unmeaning cuts  with the whip, though I was fairly off. There had been a good deal of  road-mending going on, and even where the stones were not freshly laid  down there were a great many loose ones about. My driver was laughing  and joking with the lady and the children, and talking about the country  to the right and the left; but he never thought it worth while to keep  an eye on his horse or to drive on the smoothest parts of the road; and  so it easily happened that I got a stone in one of my fore feet.    Now, if Mr. Gordon or John, or in fact any good driver, had been there,  he would have seen that something was wrong before I had gone three  paces. Or even if it had been dark a practiced hand would have felt by  the rein that there was something wrong in the step, and they would have  got down and picked out the stone. But this man went on laughing and  talking, while at every step the stone became more firmly wedged between  my shoe and the frog of my foot. The stone was sharp on the inside and  round on the outside, which, as every one knows, is the most dangerous  kind that a horse can pick up, at the same time cutting his foot and  making him most liable to stumble and fall.    Whether the man was partly blind or only very careless I can't say, but  he drove me with that stone in my foot for a good half-mile before he  saw anything. By that time I was going so lame with the pain that at  last he saw it, and called out, \"Well, here's a go! Why, they have sent  us out with a lame horse! What a shame!\"    He then chucked the reins and flipped about with the whip, saying, \"Now,  then, it's no use playing the old soldier with me; there's the journey  to go, and it's no use turning lame and lazy.\"    Just at this time a farmer came riding up on a brown cob. He lifted his  hat and pulled up.    \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" he said, \"but I think there is something the  matter with your horse; he goes very much as if he had a stone in  his shoe. If you will allow me I will look at his feet; these loose  scattered stones are confounded dangerous things for the horses.\"    \"He's a hired horse,\" said my driver. \"I don't know what's the matter  with him, but it is a great shame to send out a lame beast like this.\"    The farmer dismounted, and slipping his rein over his arm at once took  up my near foot.    \"Bless me, there's a stone! Lame! I should think so!\"    At first he tried to dislodge it with his hand, but as it was now  very tightly wedged he drew a stone-pick out of his pocket, and very  carefully and with some trouble got it out. Then holding it up he said,  \"There, that's the stone your horse had picked up. It is a wonder he did  not fall down and break his knees into the bargain!\"    \"Well, to be sure!\" said my driver; \"that is a queer thing! I never knew  that horses picked up stones before.\"    \"Didn't you?\" said the farmer rather contemptuously; \"but they do,  though, and the best of them will do it, and can't help it sometimes on  such roads as these. And if you don't want to lame your horse you must  look sharp and get them out quickly. This foot is very much bruised,\"  he said, setting it gently down and patting me. \"If I might advise,  sir, you had better drive him gently for awhile; the foot is a good deal  hurt, and the lameness will not go off directly.\"    Then mounting his cob and raising his hat to the lady he trotted off.    When he was gone my driver began to flop the reins about and whip the  harness, by which I understood that I was to go on, which of course I  did, glad that the stone was gone, but still in a good deal of pain.    This was the sort of experience we job horses often came in for.          29 Cockneys      Then there is the steam-engine style of driving; these drivers were  mostly people from towns, who never had a horse of their own and  generally traveled by rail.    They always seemed to think that a horse was something like a  steam-engine, only smaller. At any rate, they think that if only they  pay for it a horse is bound to go just as far and just as fast and with  just as heavy a load as they please. And be the roads heavy and muddy,  or dry and good; be they stony or smooth, uphill or downhill, it is all  the same--on, on, on, one must go, at the same pace, with no relief and  no consideration.    These people never think of getting out to walk up a steep hill. Oh, no,  they have paid to ride, and ride they will! The horse? Oh, he's used  to it! What were horses made for, if not to drag people uphill? Walk! A  good joke indeed! And so the whip is plied and the rein is chucked and  often a rough, scolding voice cries out, \"Go along, you lazy beast!\" And  then another slash of the whip, when all the time we are doing our  very best to get along, uncomplaining and obedient, though often sorely  harassed and down-hearted.    This steam-engine style of driving wears us up faster than any other  kind. I would far rather go twenty miles with a good considerate driver  than I would go ten with some of these; it would take less out of me.    Another thing, they scarcely ever put on the brake, however steep the  downhill may be, and thus bad accidents sometimes happen; or if they do  put it on, they often forget to take it off at the bottom of the hill,  and more than once I have had to pull halfway up the next hill, with one  of the wheels held by the brake, before my driver chose to think about  it; and that is a terrible strain on a horse.    Then these cockneys, instead of starting at an easy pace, as a gentleman  would do,"]]]
