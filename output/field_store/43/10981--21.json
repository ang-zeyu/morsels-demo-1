In this neat little volume we have the substance of a course of lectures  delivered at the Royal Institution of Great Britain in 1877, with thirty  or more engraved illustrations of various metallurgical operations. The  author discusses briefly, yet with sufficient fullness for popular  purposes, the principal processes for reducing metals from their ores,  the natural sources of metals, the metallurgy of the different metals,  the physical properties of metals, and their thermic, electric, and  chemical relations. The style is simple and the matter well chosen.      DOSIA. A Russian Story. Translated from the French of Henry Greville,       by Mary Neal Sherwood. Boston: Estes & Lauriat. Price $1.50.

P. says: Please inform me of some recipe for removing superfluous  hair. A. Make a strong solution of sulphuret of barium into a paste with  powdered starch. Apply immediately after being mixed and allow to remain  for ten or fifteen minutes. See also p. 107 (8), vol. 38, and p. 25,  current volume.    (2) M. A. C. writes: I would like to know how to dissolve bleached  shellac, to make it a cement for stone. A. Dissolve it by digestion in 3  or 4 parts of strong alcohol, or by the aid of 1/4 its weight of borax in  about 4 volumes of boiling water.    (3) A. K. asks: 1. In rating substances as to hardness, diamond being  No. 10, how do aluminum, osmium, iridium and steel as used in steel  pens, number, also common and tempered glass? A. Aluminum about 3,  iridosmine 6.5 to 7, steel 5.5 to 6, glass 5 to 5.5. 2. Can glass 1/32  inch in thickness be ground to angles of 15 per cent or less, and points  as fine as pins, without difficulty, and how? A. No.    (4) D. C. S. asks for a good recipe for cleaning and polishing dirty and  tarnished brass. A. Dip for a short time in strong hot aqueous solution  of caustic alkali, rinse in water, dip for a few moments in nitric acid  diluted with an equal volume of water, rinse again, and finish with  whiting.    (5) C. J. H. asks for the simplest way of producing a coating of the  magnetic or black oxide of iron on iron plates 3 feet x 6 feet. I think  it is called the Barff process. A. See pp. 1041 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN  SUPPLEMENT, and 232, vol. 36, and 4, vol. 37, of the SCIENTIFIC  AMERICAN.    How can I make tissue paper impervious to air and water, and yet strong  enough to confine gas? A. You may pass the fabric through a solution of  about 1 part caoutchouc in 35 parts of carbonic disulphide, exposing it  then to the air until the solvent has evaporated.    (6) J. H. J. asks how to use hyposulphite (?) of soda to neutralize  chloride of lime in cotton and linen goods after bleaching the same. A.  After washing from it the large excess of the hypochlorite, the fabric  is passed slowly through a solution containing about 10 per cent of the  hyposulphite, and then again thoroughly washed in clean water.

I had the evening previously ordered the horses I intended taking with me  across the channel, and at an early hour of the morning I followed them.  Getting on a plain, immediately after I had disengaged myself from the  reeds on the opposite side of the river, which was full of holes and  exceedingly treacherous for the animals, I pushed on for a part of the  wood Mr. Hume had endeavoured to gain from the boat, with the intention of  keeping near the marsh. On entering it, I found myself in a thick brush of  eucalypti, casuarinae and minor trees; the soil under them being mixed  with sand. I kept a N.N.W. course through it, and at the distance of  three miles from its commencement, ascended a tree, to ascertain if I was  near the marshes; when I found that I was fast receding from them. I  concluded, therefore, that my conjecture as to their direction was right,  and altered my course to N.W., a direction in which I had observed a dense  smoke arising, which I supposed had been made by some natives near water.  At the termination of the brush I crossed a barren sandy plain, and from  it saw the smoke ascending at a few miles' distance from me. Passing  through a wood, at the extremity of the plain, I found myself at the  outskirts of an open space of great extent, almost wholly enveloped in  flames. The fire was running with incredible rapidity through the rhagodia  shrubs with which it was covered. Passing quickly over it, I continued my  journey to the N.W. over barren plains of red sandy loam of even surface,  and bushes of cypresses skirted by acacia pendula. It was not until after  sunset that we struck upon a creek, in which the water was excellent; and  we halted on its banks for the night, calculating our distance at  twenty-nine miles from the camp. The creek was of considerable size,  leading northerly. Several huts were observed by us, and from the heaps of  muscle-shells that were scattered about, there could be no doubt of its  being much frequented by the natives. The grass being fairly burnt up, our  animals found but little to eat, but they had a tolerable journey and did  not attempt to wander in search of better food. I shot a snipe near the  creek, much resembling the painted snipe of India; but I had not the means  with me of preserving it.    A TRIBE OF NATIVES.    Continuing our journey on the following morning, we at first kept on the  banks of the creek, and at about a quarter of a mile from where we had  slept, came upon a numerous tribe of natives. A young girl sitting by the  fire was the first to observe us as we were slowly approaching her. She  was so excessively alarmed, that she had not the power to run away; but  threw herself on the ground and screamed violently. We now observed a  number of huts, out of which the natives issued, little dreaming of the  spectacle they were to behold. But the moment they saw us, they started  back; their huts were in a moment in flames, and each with a fire-brand  ran to and fro with hideous yells, thrusting them into every bush they  passed. I walked my horse quietly towards an old man who stood more  forward than the rest, as if he intended to devote himself for the  preservation of his tribe. I had intended speaking to him, but on a nearer  approach I remarked that he trembled so violently that it was impossible  to expect that I could obtain any information from him, and as I had not  time for explanations, I left him to form his own conjectures as to what  we were, and continued to move towards a thick brush, into which they did  not venture to follow us.    CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY.    After a ride of about eighteen miles, through a country of alternate plain  and brush, we struck upon a second creek leading like the first to the  northward. The water in it was very bitter and muddy, and it was much  inferior in appearance to that at which we had slept. After stopping for  half-an-hour upon its banks, to rest our animals, we again pushed forward.  We had not as yet risen any perceptible height above the level of the  marshes, but had left the country subject to overflow for a considerable  space behind us. The brushes through which we had passed were too sandy to  retain water long, but the plains were of such an even surface, that they  could not but continue wet for a considerable period after any fall of  rain. They were covered with salsolaceous plants, without a blade of  grass; and their soil was generally a red sandy loam. There were  occasional patches that appeared moist, in which the calystemma was  abundant, and these patches must, I should imagine, form quagmires in the  wet season.    On leaving the last-mentioned creek, we found a gently rising country  before us; and about three or four miles from it we crossed some stony  ridges, covered with a new species of acacia so thickly as to prevent our  obtaining any view from them. As the sun declined, we got into open forest  ground; and travelled forwards in momentary expectation, from appearances,  of coming in sight of water; but we were obliged to pull up at sunset on  the outskirts of a larger plain without having our expectation realized.  The day had been extremely warm, and our animals were as thirsty as  ourselves. Hope never forsakes the human breast; and thence it was that,  after we had secured the horses, we began to wander round our lonely  bivouac. It was almost dark, when one of my men came to inform me that he  had found a small puddle of water, to which he had been led by a pigeon.    It was, indeed, small enough, probably the remains of a passing shower; it  was, however, sufficient for our necessities, and I thanked Providence for  its bounty to us. We were now about sixty miles from the Macquarie, in a  N.W. by W. direction, and the country had proved so extremely  discouraging, that I intimated to my men my intention of retracing my  steps, should I not discover any change in it before noon on the morrow.  A dense brush of acacia succeeded to the plain on which we had slept,  which we entered, and shortly afterwards found ourselves in an open space,  of oblong shape, at the extremity of which there was a shallow lake. The  brush completely encircled it, and a few huts were upon its banks. About  10 p.m. we got into an open forest track of better appearance than any  over which we had recently travelled.    ISOLATED HILL.    There was a visible change in the country, and the soil, although red, was  extremely rich and free from sand. A short time afterwards we rose to the  summit of a round hill, from which we obtained an extensive view on most  points of the compass. We had imperceptibly risen considerably above the  general level of the interior.    VIEW FROM THE SUMMIT.    Beneath us, to the westward, I observed a broad and thinly wooded valley;  and W. by S., distant apparently about twenty miles, an isolated mountain,  whose sides seemed almost perpendicular, broke the otherwise even line of  the horizon; but the country in every other direction looked as if it was  darkly wooded. Anticipating that I should find a stream in the valley, I  did not for a moment hesitate in striking down into it. Disappointed,  however, in this expectation, I continued onwards to the mountain, which I  reached just before the sun set. Indeed, he was barely visible when I  gained its summit; but my eyes, from exposure to his glare, became so  weak, my face was so blistered, and my lips cracked in so many places,  that I was unable to look towards the west, and was actually obliged to  sit down behind a rock until he had set.    Perhaps no time is so favourable for a view along the horizon as the  sunset hour; and here, at an elevation of from five to six hundred feet  above the plain, the visible line of it could not have been less than from  thirty-five to forty-five miles. The hill upon which I stood was broken  into two points; the one was a bold rocky elevation; the other had its  rear face also perpendicular, but gradually declined to the north, and at  a distance of from four to five miles was lost in an extensive and open  plain in that direction. In the S.E. quarter, two wooded hills were  visible, which before had appeared to be nothing more than swells in the  general level of the country. A small hill, similar to the above, bore  N.E. by compass; and again, to the west, a more considerable mountain than  that I had ascended, and evidently much higher, reflected the last beams  of the sun as he sunk behind them. I looked, however, in vain for water.  I could not trace either the windings of a stream, or the course of a  mountain torrent; and, as we had passed a swamp about a mile from the  hill, we descended to it for the night, during which we were grievously  tormented by the mosquitoes.    RESULTS OF THE EXCURSION.    I had no inducement to proceed further into the interior. I had been  sufficiently disappointed in the termination of this excursion, and the  track before me was still less inviting. Nothing but a dense forest, and a  level country, existed between me and the distant hill. I had learnt, by  experience, that it was impossible to form any opinion of the probable  features of so singular a region as that in which I was wandering, from  previous appearances, or to expect the same result, as in other countries,  from similar causes. In a geographical point of view, my journey had been  more successful, and had enabled me to put to rest for ever a question of  much previous doubt. Of whatever extent the marshes of the Macquarie might  be, it was evident they were not connected with those of the Lachlan. I  had gained knowledge of more than 100 miles of the western interior, and  had ascertained that no sea, indeed that little water, existed on its  surface; and that, although it is generally flat, it still has elevations  of considerable magnitude upon it.    Although I had passed over much barren ground,"]]]
