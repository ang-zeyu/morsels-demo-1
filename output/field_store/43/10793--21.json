MULTIPOLAR DYNAMOS.    Hitherto we have considered the magnetic field produced by one bi-polar  magnet only. Large dynamos have four, six, eight, or more field magnets  set inside a casing, from which their cores project towards the armature  so as almost to touch it (Fig. 74). The magnet coils are wound to give  N. and S. poles alternately at their armature ends round the field; and  the lines of force from each N. pole stream each way to the two adjacent  S. poles across the path of the armature coils. In dynamos of this kind  several pairs of collecting brushes pick current off the commutator at  equidistant points on its circumference.    [Illustration: FIG. 74.--A Holmes continuous current dynamo: A,  armature; C, commutator; M, field magnets.]      EXCITING THE FIELD MAGNETS.    Until current passes through the field magnet coils, no magnetic field  can be created. How are the coils supplied with current? A dynamo,  starting for the first time, is excited by a current from an outside  source; but when it has once begun to generate current it feeds its  magnets itself, and ever afterwards will be self-exciting,[19] owing to  the residual magnetism left in the magnet cores.    [Illustration: FIG. 75.--Partly finished commutator.]    Look carefully at Figs. 77 and 78. In the first of these you will  observe that part of the wire forming the external circuit is wound  round the arms of the field magnet. This is called a _series_ winding.  In this case _all_ the current generated helps to excite the dynamo. At  the start the residual magnetism of the magnet cores gives a weak field.  The armature coils cut this and pass a current through the circuit. The  magnets are further excited, and the field becomes stronger; and so on  till the dynamo is developing full power. Series winding is used where  the current in the external circuit is required to be very constant.    [Illustration: FIG. 76.--The brushes of a Holmes dynamo.]    Fig. 78 shows another method of winding--the _shunt_. Most of the  current generated passes through the external circuit 2, 2; but a part  is switched through a separate winding for the magnets, denoted by the  fine wire 1, 1. Here the strength of the magnetism does not vary  directly with the current, as only a small part of the current serves  the magnets. The shunt winding is therefore used where the voltage (or  pressure) must be constant.    [Illustration: FIG. 77.--Sketch showing a \"series\" winding.]    [Illustration: FIG. 78.--\"Shunt\" winding.]    A third method is a combination of the two already named. A winding of  fine wire passes from brush to brush round the magnets; and there is  also a series winding as in Fig. 77. This compound method is adapted  more especially for electric traction.      ALTERNATING DYNAMOS.    These have their field magnets excited by a separate continuous current  dynamo of small size. The field magnets usually revolve inside a fixed  armature (the reverse of the arrangement in a direct-current generator);  or there may be a fixed central armature and field magnets revolving  outside it. This latter arrangement is found in the great power stations  at Niagara Falls, where the enormous field-rings are mounted on the top  ends of vertical shafts, driven by water-turbines at the bottom of pits  178 feet deep, down which water is led to the turbines through great  pipes, or penstocks. The weight of each shaft and the field-ring  attached totals about thirty-five tons. This mass revolves 250 times a  minute, and 5,000 horse power is constantly developed by the dynamo.  Similar dynamos of 10,000 horse power each have been installed on the  Canadian side of the Falls.    [Illustration: FIG. 79.]      TRANSMISSION OF POWER.    Alternating current is used where power has to be transmitted for long  distances, because such a current can be intensified, or stepped up, by  a transformer somewhat similar in principle to a Ruhmkorff coil _minus_  a contact-breaker (see p. 122). A typical example of transformation is  seen in Fig. 79. Alternating current of 5,000 volts pressure is produced  in the generating station and sent through conductors to a distant  station, where a transformer, B, reduces the pressure to 500 volts to  drive an alternating motor, C, which in turn operates a direct current  dynamo, D. This dynamo has its + terminal connected with the insulated  or \"live\" rail of an electric railway, and its - terminal with the wheel  rails, which are metallically united at the joints to act as a  \"return.\" On its way from the live rail to the return the current passes  through the motors. In the case of trams the conductor is either a cable  carried overhead on standards, from which it passes to the motor through  a trolley arm, or a rail laid underground in a conduit between the  rails. In the top of the conduit is a slit through which an arm carrying  a contact shoe on the end projects from the car. The shoe rubs  continuously on the live rail as the car moves.    To return for a moment to the question of transformation of current.  \"Why,\" it may be asked, \"should we not send low-pressure _direct_  current to a distant station straight from the dynamo, instead of  altering its nature and pressure? Or, at any rate, why not use  high-pressure direct current, and transform _that_?\" The answer is, that  to transmit a large amount of electrical energy at low pressure (or  voltage) would necessitate large volume (or _amperage_) and a big and  expensive copper conductor to carry it. High-pressure direct current is  not easily generated, since the sparking at the collecting brushes as  they pass over the commutator segments gives trouble. So engineers  prefer high-pressure alternating current, which is easily produced, and  can be sent through a small and inexpensive conductor with little loss.  Also its voltage can be transformed by apparatus having no revolving  parts.      THE ELECTRIC MOTOR.    Anybody who understands the dynamo will also be able to understand the  electric motor, which is merely a reversed dynamo.    Imagine in Fig. 70 a dynamo taking the place of the lamp and passing  current through the brushes and commutator into the coil _w x y z_. Now,  any coil through which current passes becomes a magnet with N. and S.  poles at either end. (In Fig. 70 we will assume that the N. pole is  below and the S. pole above the coil.) The coil poles therefore try to  seek the contrary poles of the permanent magnet, and the coil revolves  until its S. pole faces the N. of the magnet, and _vice versa_. The  lines of force of the coil and the magnet are now parallel. But the  momentum of revolution carries the coil on, and suddenly the commutator  reverses its polarity, and a further half-revolution takes place. Then  comes a further reversal, and so on _ad infinitum_. The rotation of the  motor is therefore merely a question of repulsion and attraction of like  and unlike poles. An ordinary compass needle may be converted into a  tiny motor by presenting the N. and S. poles of a magnet to its S. and  N. poles alternately every half-revolution.    In construction and winding a motor is practically the same as a dynamo.  In fact, either machine can perform either function, though perhaps not  equally well adapted for both. Motors may be run with direct or  alternating current, according to their construction.    On electric cars the motor is generally suspended from the wheel truck,  and a small pinion on the armature shaft gears with a large pinion on a  wheel axle. One great advantage of electric traction is that every  vehicle of a train can carry its own motor, so that the whole weight of  the train may be used to get a grip on the rails when starting. Where a  single steam locomotive is used, the adhesion of its driving-wheels only  is available for overcoming the inertia of the load; and the whole  strain of starting is thrown on to the foremost couplings. Other  advantages may be summed up as follows:--(1) Ease of starting and rapid  acceleration; (2) absence of waste of energy (in the shape of burning  fuel) when the vehicles are at rest; (3) absence of smoke and smell.      ELECTRIC LIGHTING.    Dynamos are used to generate current for two main purposes--(1) To  supply power to motors of all kinds; (2) to light our houses, factories,  and streets. In private houses and theatres incandescent lamps are  generally used; in the open air, in shops, and in larger buildings, such  as railway stations, the arc lamp is more often found.      INCANDESCENT LAMP.    If you take a piece of very fine iron wire and lay it across the  terminals of an accumulator, it becomes white hot and melts, owing to  the heat generated by its resistance to the current. A piece of fine  platinum wire would become white hot without melting, and would give out  an intense light. Here we have the principle of the glow or incandescent  lamp--namely, the interposition in an electric circuit of a conductor  which at once offers a high resistance to the current, but is not  destroyed by the resulting heat.    In Fig. 80 is shown a fan propelling liquid constantly through a pipe.  Let us assume that the liquid is one which develops great friction on  the inside of the pipe. At the contraction, where the speed of travel  is much greater than elsewhere in the circuit, most heat will be  produced.    [Illustration: FIG. 80.--Diagram to show circulation of water through a  pipe.]    In quite the early days of the glow-lamp platinum wire was found to be  unreliable as regards melting, and filaments of carbon are now used. To  prevent the wasting away of the carbon by combination with oxygen the  filament is enclosed in a glass bulb from which practically all air has  been sucked by a mercury pump before sealing.    [Illustration: FIG. 81.--The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28570"],[0,"Astronomy of To-day: A Popular Introduction in Non-Technical Language (#17)"],[1,"other portions of the Yerkes and Lick telescopes were,  however, constructed by the Warner and Swasey Co., of Cleveland, Ohio.    The largest reflector, and so the largest telescope in the world, is  still the six-foot erected by the late Lord Rosse at Parsonstown in  Ireland, and completed in the year 1845. It is about fifty-six feet in  length. Next come two of five feet, with mirrors of silver on glass;  one of them made by the late Dr. Common, of Ealing, and the other by the  American astronomer, Professor G.W. Ritchey. The latter of these is  installed in the Solar Observatory belonging to Carnegie Institution of  Washington, which is situated on Mount Wilson in California. The former  is now at the Harvard College Observatory, and is considered by  Professor Moulton to be probably the most efficient reflector in use at  present. Another large reflector is the three-foot made by Dr. Common.  It came into the possession of Mr. Crossley of Halifax, who presented it  to the Lick Observatory, where it is now known as the \"Crossley  Reflector.\"    Although to the house of Clark belongs, as we have seen, the credit of  constructing the object-glasses of the largest refracting telescopes of  our time, it has nevertheless keen competitors in Sir Howard Grubb, of  Dublin, and such well-known firms as Cooke of York and Steinheil of  Munich. In the four-foot reflector, made in 1870 for the Observatory of  Melbourne by the firm of Grubb, the Cassegrainian principle was  employed.    With regard to the various merits of refractors and reflectors much  might be said. Each kind of instrument has, indeed, its special  advantages; though perhaps, on the whole, the most perfect type of  telescope is the achromatic refractor.    [Illustration: PLATE IV. THE GREAT YERKES TELESCOPE    Great telescope at the Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago,  Williams Bay, Wisconsin, U.S.A. It was erected in 1896-7, and is the  largest refracting telescope in the world. Diameter of object-glass, 40  inches; length of telescope, about 60 feet. The object-glass was made by  the firm of Alvan Clark and Sons, of Cambridge, Massachusetts; the other  portions of the instrument by the Warner and Swasey Co., of Cleveland,  Ohio.    (Page 117)]    In connection with telescopes certain devices have from time to time  been introduced, but these merely aim at the _convenience_ of the  observer and do not supplant the broad principles upon which are based  the various types of instrument above described. Such, for instance, are  the \"Siderostat,\" and another form of it called the \"Coelostat,\" in  which a plane mirror is made to revolve in a certain manner, so as to  reflect those portions of the sky which are to be observed, into the  tube of a telescope kept fixed. Such too are the \"Equatorial Coude\" of  the late M. Loewy, Director of the Paris Observatory, and the  \"Sheepshanks Telescope\" of the Observatory of Cambridge, in which a  telescope is separated into two portions, the eye-piece portion being  fixed upon a downward slant, and the object-glass portion jointed to it  at an angle and pointed up at the sky. In these two instruments (which,  by the way, differ materially) an arrangement of slanting mirrors in the  tubes directs the journey of the rays of light from the object-glass to  the eye-piece. The observer can thus sit at the eye-end of his telescope  in the warmth and comfort of his room, and observe the stars in the same  unconstrained manner as if he were merely looking down into a  microscope.    Needless to say, devices such as these are subject to the drawback that  the mirrors employed sap a certain proportion of the rays of light. It  will be remembered that we made allusion to loss of light in this way,  when pointing out the advantage in light grasp of the Herschelian form  of telescope, where only _one_ reflection takes place, over the  Newtonian in which there are _two_.    It is an interesting question as to whether telescopes can be made much  larger. The American astronomer, Professor G.E. Hale, concludes that the  limit of refractors is about five feet in diameter, but he thinks that  reflectors as large as nine feet in diameter might now be made. As  regards refractors there are several strong reasons against augmenting  their proportions. First of all comes the great cost. Secondly, since  the lenses are held in position merely round their rims, they will bend  by their weight in the centres if they are made much larger. On the  other hand, attempts to obviate this, by making the lenses thicker,  would cause a decrease in the amount of light let through.    But perhaps the greatest stumbling-block to the construction of larger  telescopes is the fact that the unsteadiness of the air will be  increasingly magnified. And further, the larger the tubes become, the  more difficult will it be to keep the air within them at one constant  temperature throughout their lengths.    It would, indeed, seem as if telescopes are not destined greatly to  increase in size, but that the means of observation will break out in  some new direction, as it has already done in the case of photography  and the spectroscope. The direct use of the eye is gradually giving  place to indirect methods. We are, in fact, now _feeling_ rather than  seeing our way about the universe. Up to the present, for instance, we  have not the slightest proof that life exists elsewhere than upon our  earth. But who shall say that the twentieth century has not that in  store for us, by which the presence of life in other orbs may be  perceived through some form of vibration transmitted across illimitable  space? There is no use speaking of the impossible or the inconceivable.  After the extraordinary revelations of the spectroscope--nay, after the  astounding discovery of Roentgen--the word impossible should be cast  aside, and inconceivability cease to be regarded as any criterion.      [8] The principle upon which the telescope is based appears to have been  known _theoretically_ for a long time previous to this. The monk Roger  Bacon, who lived in the thirteenth century, describes it very clearly;  and several writers of the sixteenth century have also dealt with the  idea. Even Lippershey's claims to a practical solution of the question  were hotly contested at the time by two of his own countrymen, _i.e._ a  certain Jacob Metius, and another spectacle-maker of Middleburgh, named  Jansen.          CHAPTER XI    SPECTRUM ANALYSIS      If white light (that of the sun, for instance) be passed through a glass  prism, namely, a piece of glass of triangular shape, it will issue from  it in rainbow-tinted colours. It is a common experience with any of us  to notice this when the sunlight shines through cut-glass, as in the  pendant of a chandelier, or in the stopper of a wine-decanter.    The same effect may be produced when light passes through water. The  Rainbow, which we all know so well, is merely the result of the sunlight  passing through drops of falling rain.    White light is composed of rays of various colours. Red, orange, yellow,  green, blue, indigo, and violet, taken all together, go, in fact, to  make up that effect which we call white.    It is in the course of the _refraction_, or bending of a beam of light,  when it passes in certain conditions through a transparent and denser  medium, such as glass or water, that the constituent rays are sorted out  and spread in a row according to their various colours. This production  of colour takes place usually near the edges of a lens; and, as will be  recollected, proved very obnoxious to the users of the old form of  refracting telescope.    It is, indeed, a strange irony of fate that this very same production  of colour, which so hindered astronomy in the past, should have aided it  in recent years to a remarkable degree. If sunlight, for instance, be  admitted through a narrow slit before it falls upon a glass prism, it  will issue from the latter in the form of a band of variegated colour,  each colour blending insensibly with the next. The colours arrange  themselves always in the order which we have mentioned. This seeming  band is, in reality, an array of countless coloured images of the  original slit ranged side by side; the colour of each image being the  slightest possible shade different from that next to it. This strip of  colour when produced by sunlight is called the \"Solar Spectrum\" (see  Fig. 9, p. 123). A similar strip, or _spectrum_, will be produced by any  other light; but the appearance of the strip, with regard to  preponderance of particular colours, will depend upon the character of  that light. Electric light and gas light yield spectra not unlike that  of sunlight; but that of gas is less rich in blue and violet than that  of the sun.    The Spectroscope, an instrument devised for the examination of spectra,  is, in its simplest form, composed of a small tube with a narrow slit  and prism at one end, and an eye-piece at the other. If we drop ordinary  table salt into the flame of a gas light, the flame becomes strongly  yellow. If, then, we observe this yellow flame with the spectroscope, we  find that its spectrum consists almost entirely of two bright yellow  transverse lines. Chemically considered ordinary table salt is sodium  chloride; that is to say, a compound of the metal sodium and the gas  chlorine. Now if other compounds of sodium be experimented with in the  same manner, it will soon be found that these two yellow lines are  characteristic of sodium when turned into vapour by great heat. In the  same manner it can be ascertained that every element, when heated to a  condition of vapour, gives as its spectrum a set of lines peculiar to  itself. Thus the spectroscope enables us to find out the composition of  substances when they are reduced to vapour in the laboratory.
