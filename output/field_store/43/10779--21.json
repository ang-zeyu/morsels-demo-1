GEDDES.    When the first bill was introduced by Judge Hertell in 1836, he made a  very elaborate argument in its favor, covering all objections, and  showing the incontestable justice of the measure. Being too voluminous  for a newspaper report it was published in pamphlet form. His wife,  Barbara Amelia Hertell, dying a few years since, by her will left a  sum for the republication of this exhaustive argument, thus keeping  the memory of her husband green in the hearts of his countrywomen, and  expressing her own high appreciation of its value.    Step by step the Middle and New England States began to modify their  laws, but the Western States, in their Constitutions, were liberal in  starting. Thus the discussions in the constitutional convention and  the Legislature, heralded by the press to every school district,  culminated at last in a woman's rights convention.    The _Seneca County Courier_, a semi-weekly journal, of July 14, 1848,  contained the following startling announcement:                            SENECA FALLS CONVENTION.         WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION.--A Convention to discuss the social,       civil, and religious condition and rights of woman, will be held       in the Wesleyan Chapel, at Seneca Falls, N. Y., on Wednesday and       Thursday, the 19th and 20th of July, current; commencing at 10       o'clock A.M. During the first day the meeting will be exclusively       for women, who are earnestly invited to attend. The public       generally are invited to be present on the second day, when       Lucretia Mott, of Philadelphia, and other ladies and gentlemen,       will address the convention.    This call, without signature, was issued by Lucretia Mott, Martha C.  Wright, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Mary Ann McClintock. At this time  Mrs. Mott was visiting her sister Mrs. Wright, at Auburn, and  attending the Yearly Meeting of Friends in Western New York. Mrs.  Stanton, having recently removed from Boston to Seneca Falls, finding  the most congenial associations in Quaker families, met Mrs. Mott  incidentally for the first time since her residence there. They at  once returned to the topic they had so often discussed, walking arm  in arm in the streets of London, and Boston, \"the propriety of holding  a woman's convention.\" These four ladies, sitting round the tea-table  of Richard Hunt, a prominent Friend near Waterloo, decided to put  their long-talked-of resolution into action, and before the twilight  deepened into night, the call was written, and sent to the Seneca  County Courier. On Sunday morning they met in Mrs. McClintock's parlor  to write their declaration, resolutions, and to consider subjects for  speeches.[8] As the convention was to assemble in three days, the time  was short for such productions; but having no experience in the _modus  operandi_ of getting up conventions, nor in that kind of literature,  they were quite innocent of the herculean labors they proposed. On the  first attempt to frame a resolution; to crowd a complete thought,  clearly and concisely, into three lines; they felt as helpless and  hopeless as if they had been suddenly asked to construct a steam  engine. And the humiliating fact may as well now be recorded that  before taking the initiative step, those ladies resigned themselves to  a faithful perusal of various masculine productions. The reports of  Peace, Temperance, and Anti-Slavery conventions were examined, but all  alike seemed too tame and pacific for the inauguration of a rebellion  such as the world had never before seen. They knew women had wrongs,  but how to state them was the difficulty, and this was increased from  the fact that they themselves were fortunately organized and  conditioned; they were neither \"sour old maids,\" \"childless women,\"  nor \"divorced wives,\" as the newspapers declared them to be. While  they had felt the insults incident to sex, in many ways, as every  proud, thinking woman must, in the laws, religion, and literature of  the world, and in the invidious and degrading sentiments and customs  of all nations, yet they had not in their own experience endured the  coarser forms of tyranny resulting from unjust laws, or association  with immoral and unscrupulous men, but they had souls large enough to  feel the wrongs of others, without being scarified in their own flesh.    After much delay, one of the circle took up the Declaration of 1776,  and read it aloud with much spirit and emphasis, and it was at once  decided to adopt the historic document, with some slight changes such  as substituting \"all men\" for \"King George.\" Knowing that women must  have more to complain of than men under any circumstances possibly  could, and seeing the Fathers had eighteen grievances, a protracted  search was made through statute books, church usages, and the customs  of society to find that exact number. Several well-disposed men  assisted in collecting the grievances, until, with the announcement of  the eighteenth, the women felt they had enough to go before the world  with a good case. One youthful lord remarked, \"Your grievances must be  grievous indeed, when you are obliged to go to books in order to find  them out.\"    The eventful day dawned at last, and crowds in carriages and on foot,  wended their way to the Wesleyan church. When those having charge of  the Declaration, the resolutions, and several volumes of the Statutes  of New York arrived on the scene, lo! the door was locked. However, an  embryo Professor of Yale College was lifted through an open window to  unbar the door; that done, the church was quickly filled. It had been  decided to have no men present, but as they were already on the spot,  and as the women who must take the responsibility of organizing the  meeting, and leading the discussions, shrank from doing either, it was  decided, in a hasty council round the altar, that this was an occasion  when men might make themselves pre-eminently useful. It was agreed  they should remain, and take the laboring oar through the Convention.    James Mott, tall and dignified, in Quaker costume, was called to the  chair; Mary McClintock appointed Secretary, Frederick Douglass, Samuel  Tillman, Ansel Bascom, E. W. Capron, and Thomas McClintock took part  throughout in the discussions. Lucretia Mott, accustomed to public  speaking in the Society of Friends, stated the objects of the  Convention, and in taking a survey of the degraded condition of woman  the world over, showed the importance of inaugurating some movement  for her education and elevation. Elizabeth and Mary McClintock, and  Mrs. Stanton, each read a well-written speech; Martha Wright read some  satirical articles she had published in the daily papers answering the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28026"],[0,"Great Pianists on Piano Playing (#17)"],[1,"is so clearly and  openly outlined that any error is easily detected, while in Bach the  structure is so close and compact that it is difficult to make an error  without interrupting the movement of some other voice that will reveal  the error. The main consideration, however, is personal carefulness, and  it makes little difference what the study is, so long as the student  himself takes great pains to see that he is right, and exactly right,  before he attempts to go ahead. Most musicians, however, would say that  Bach was the one great stone upon which our higher technical structure  must firmly stand.    Some individuals are so superficial and so \"frothy\" that it is difficult  to conceive of their doing anything serious or really worth while. It is  very hard for the teacher to work with such a pupil, because they have  not realized themselves as yet. They have not looked into their lives  and discerned those things which make life of most importance. Life is  not all play, nor is it all sorrow. But sorrow often does much to  develop the musician's character, to make him look into himself and  discover his more serious purposes. This might also be accomplished by  some such means of self-introspection as \"Christian Science.\" Although I  am not a \"Christian Scientist,\" I am a great believer in its wonderful  principles.    The greatest care must be taken in developing the individualities of the  superficial pupils. To give them Bach or Brahms at the outstart would be  to irritate them. They must be led to a fondness for music of a deeper  or more worthy character by gradual steps in that direction. In my own  case I was fortunate in having the advice of mature and famous  musicians, and as a child was given music of a serious order only. I  have always been grateful for this experience. At one of my first New  York concerts I had the honor of having Theodore Thomas as first  violinist, and I well remember his natural bent for music of a serious  order, which was in a decided contrast to the popular musical taste of  the times.      THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDYING MUSICAL HISTORY    Every composer has a pronounced individuality. To the experienced  musician this individuality becomes so marked that he can often detect  the composer's style in a composition which he has never heard. The  artist studies the individuality of the composer through the study of  his biography, through the study of musical history in general and  through the analysis of individual compositions.    Every music student should be familiar with the intensely necessary and  extremely valuable subject of musical history. How else can he become  familiar with the personal individualities of the great composers? The  more I know of Chopin, Beethoven, Scarlatti or Mendelssohn as men, and  the more I know of the times in which they lived, the closer I feel to  the manner in which they would have wished their compositions  interpreted. Consider how markedly different are the individualities of  Wagner and Haydn, and how different the interpretations of the works of  these masters should be.    Strauss and Debussy are also very different in their methods of  composition. Strauss seems to me a tremendous genius who is inventing a  new musical language as he goes. Debussy does not appeal to me in the  same manner. He always seems to be groping for musical ideas, while with  Strauss the greatness of his ideas is always evident and all-compelling.    In closing, let me say that _Time_, _Experience_ and _Work_ are the  moulders of all individuality. Few of us close our days with the same  individualities which become evident in our youth. We are either  growing better or worse all the time. We rarely stand still. To the  musician work is the great sculptor of individuality. As you work and as  you think, so will you be. No deed, no thought, no hope is too  insignificant to fail to influence your nature. As through work we  become better men and women, so through work do we become better  musicians. Carlyle has beautifully expressed this thought in \"Past and  Present\" thus: \"The latest Gospel in this world is, 'Know thy work and  do it.' Blessed is he who has found his work; let him ask no other  blessedness. He has a WORK, a life purpose; he has found it and will  follow it.\"      QUESTIONS ON STYLE, INTERPRETATION, EXPRESSION  AND TECHNIC OF PIANO PLAYING    SERIES VI    TERESA CARRENO    1.

GABRILOWITSCH]    OSSIP GABRILOWITSCH    BIOGRAPHICAL      Ossip Gabrilowitsch was born in St. Petersburg, February 8, 1878. His  father was a well-known jurist of the Russian capital. His brothers were  musical and his first teacher was one of his brothers. Later, he was  taken to Anton Rubinstein who earnestly advocated a career as a  virtuoso. Accordingly he entered the classes of Victor Tolstoff at the  St. Petersburg Conservatory, then under the supervision of Rubinstein  himself. His frequent personal conferences with the latter were of  immense value to him. Thereafter he went to Vienna and studied with  Leschetizky for two years. He has made many tours of Europe and America  as a piano virtuoso and has also appeared as an orchestral conductor  with pronounced success. He was a great friend of the late Mark Twain  (Samuel L. Clemens) and married one of his daughters.    (The following conference was conducted in English.)          IX    ESSENTIALS OF TOUCH    OSSIP GABRILOWITSCH      \"Modern pianoforte teachers in many instances seem to make deliberate  attempts to complicate the very simple matter of touch. In the final  analyses the whole study of touch may be resolved into two means of  administering force to the keyboard, _i. e._, weight and muscular  activity. The amount of pressure brought to bear upon the keys depends  upon the amount of arm weight and upon the quickness with which the  muscles of the hand, forearm, full-arm and back permit the key to be  struck. Upon these two means of administering force must depend whatever  differentiation in dynamic power and tonal quality the player desires to  produce. The various gradations of tone which the virtuoso's hand and  arm are trained to execute are so minute that it is impossible for me to  conceive of a scientific instrument or scale to measure them.  Physiologists have attempted to construct instruments to do this, but  little of value has come from such experiments.      A RIGID ARM UNDESIRABLE    \"Only a comparatively few years ago thousands of teachers were insisting  upon having their pupils keep the arms in a still, even rigid, condition  during practice. This naturally resulted in the stiffest imaginable  kind of a touch, and likewise in a mechanical style of playing that made  what has come to be known in later days as 'tone color' impossible.    \"At this day the finger touch as it was formerly known has almost gone  out of existence. By finger touch I refer to the old custom of holding  the hand and forearm almost rigid and depending upon the muscular  strength of the fingers for all tonal effects. In fact, I so rarely  employ the finger touch, except in combination with the arm touch, that  it is almost an insignificant factor as far as my own playing is  concerned. By this the reader must not think that the training of the  fingers, and particularly the finger tips, is to be neglected. But this  training, to my mind, is not so much a matter of acquiring digital  strength to produce force as to accustom the fingers to strike the notes  with the greatest possible accuracy and speed. This belongs rather to  the realm of technic than to that of touch, and behind all technic is  the intellect of the player. Technic is a matter of training the finger  tips to attack and leave the keys under the absolute discipline of the  brain. Touch has a much broader and wider significance. It is touch that  reveals the soul of the player.      TOUCH A DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC    \"Touch is the distinguishing characteristic which makes one player's  music sound different from that of another, for it is touch that  dominates the player's means of producing dynamic shading or tone  quality. I know that many authorities contend that the quality of tone  depends upon the instrument rather than upon the performer.  Nevertheless, I am reasonably confident that if I were to hear a number  of pianists play in succession upon the same instrument behind a screen  and one of these performers were to be my friend, Harold Bauer, I could  at once identify his playing by his peculiarly individual touch. In  fact, the trained ear can identify different individual characteristics  with almost the same accuracy that we identify different voices. One  could never forget Leschetizky's touch, or that of many another  contemporary pianist.    \"No matter how wonderful the pianist's technic--that is, how rapidly and  accurately he can play passages of extraordinary difficulty, it is quite  worthless unless he possesses that control over his touch which enables  him to interpret the composer's work with the right artistic shading. A  fine technic without the requisite touch to liberate the performer's  artistic intelligence and 'soul' is like a gorgeous chandelier without  the lights. Until the lights are ignited all its beauty is obscured in  darkness. With an excellent technic and a fine touch,"]]]
