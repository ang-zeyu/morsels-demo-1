Another I have seen at Mrs.  Mawe's, and one is in the British Museum: but the finest specimen in colour  and preservation is in the possession of my friend W. J. Broderip, Esq., of  Lincoln's-Inn: from this it seems the spiral whorls are finely and  delicately marked by transverse elevated striae, while those on the basal  volution are striated transversely, though in a less regular manner.    Bruguiere mentions that this species is generally found in the South  American islands, Cayenne, and Guiana.    Mr. Dillwyn has given the new name of _aurea_ to this shell, in addition to  the five others under which different authors have described it. Such  changing of names and multiplication of synonyms, without strong reasons,  are very objectionable. I have retained that of _Bruguiere_, as being the  only author who has placed it in its proper genus.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 47    [Illustration]    BULIMUS citrinus (_var_. perversu).    _Reverse, banded Citron Bulimus._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 4.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 46.

Dubois, to whom I am indebted on this and many other occasions, for the  facilities he has afforded me in prosecuting the present work: one of these  is now figured; it differs in no respect from that in the last plate,  except in being reversed and having the umbilicus not so completely closed;  a character which, perhaps, exists only in very old shells. The other  specimen is also reversed and banded, though in a different manner.           *       *       *       *       *    BULIMUS aureus.    _Golden Bulimus.--upper and lower figures._    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _B. testa obovata, spira conica, anfractibus 5 convexis, sutura      simplici, umbilico aperto._        Shell obovate; spire conic, of five convex volutions; suture simple;      umbilicus open.        _Lister_ 34. 33. _Martini_ 9. _tab._ 110. 928. 929?        OBS. BULIMUS _aureus_, in Mr. Spurrett's valuable cabinet is another      specimen of this shell minutely agreeing with that here described.           *       *       *       *       *    Having seen but a single specimen of this shell, I have placed it as a  distinct species, not without some doubts, and principally for the purpose  of calling the attention of conchologists to a more rigid examination of  the specific distinctions of this family (unconnected with colour) than has  heretofore been done. The regular convexity of the whorls, not in any  degree compressed at the suture, the want of that thickened appearance on  the spire, and of the contraction at the base of the mouth (all which  characters I have found in the varieties of _B. citrinus_ to be constant),  afford a specific distinction which future observations must confirm or  annul. Bruguiere notices a variety of _B. citrinus_ which is entirely  yellow, a most beautiful specimen of which is in the British Museum, and  which possesses (as well as the excellent figure of Gualtieri) all the  specific characters I have given to _B. citrinus_, but not of the present  shell. Lister's figure, on the contrary, is rude, though very  characteristic of this; and Martini's representation, here cited, also  appears the same.    Mr. Dubois, in whose collection this specimen exists, is unacquainted with  its locality.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 48    [Illustration]    MITRA casta,    _Chesnut-banded Mitre._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 23.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _Mitra (Div. 3.) testa alba, laevi, olivaeformi, spira apertura      breviore, anfractibus supra tenuiter reticulatis, basi epidermide      castaneam fasciam formante, in anfractu basali centralem et latam._        Shell white, smooth, olive-formed, spire shorter than the aperture, the      volutions finely reticulated above, the lower half with the epidermis      forming a chesnut band which is central and broad on the basal whorl.

In the  Banksian cabinet are two fine specimens, and which have enabled me to  ascertain that this brown band is nothing more than an epidermis, or  external coating, with which the shell is only partially covered--a  circumstance of very rare occurrence; and which, being removed, proves the  real colour of the shell to be of a uniform polished white. This, together  with its excessive rarity, and the opportunity of giving original figures,  has induced me to include it in this work, although it exists both in those  of Martini and Martyn above quoted. I have neither seen nor heard of  specimens being in any other collection, besides the two above noticed; and  which no doubt were collected by their late lamented possessor on some of  the South Sea islands. A striking affinity exists between this and _M.  zonata_ figured at the third plate of this work.           *       *       *       *       *    MITRA olivaeformis.    _Olive-shaped Mitre._        _M. testa olivaeformi, glabra, nitida, spira brevissima,      longitudinaliter rugata, stria centrali transversa; columella      4-plicata._        M. Shell olive-shaped, smooth, polished, spire very short,      longitudinally wrinkled, with a central transverse stria, pillar      four-plaited.           *       *       *       *       *    I introduce the description of this diminutive and undescribed shell from  its affinity with the last, and as forming a most interesting transition  from the Mitres to the Olives: agreeing with the former in the structure of  the pillar and the sculptured spire, and with the latter in its general  form and _prima facie_ appearance. Its perfect resemblance, in fact, to a  small olive, may have occasioned its being hitherto overlooked. The spire  is slightly wrinkled and striated; the teeth on the pillar very near each  other, slender, and four in number. The colour pale yellowish; the mouth  darker, and the tip and base purple. The whole shell is scarcely half an  inch long.    It was received from the South Seas.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 49    [Illustration]    OXYRHYNCUS cristatus.    _Crested Sharpbill._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Oxyruncus_ Temminck.        _Rostrum breve, rectissimum, basi trigona, ultra basin attenuatum,      apice acutissimum; mandibula superiore supra rotundata, utrisque      integris.

The Professor  has slightly described it, in the new edition of his _Manuel_, without a  _specific_, but under the _generic_ name of _Oxyruncus_, the spelling of  which must be presumed as an error of the press: no mention, however, is  made of the beautiful crimson colour which adorns the crest.    Total length near seven inches. Bill eight-tenths in length from the gape;  general colour of the bird olive-green, becoming nearly white on the under  part, and on the transverse stripes on each side the neck, front and  temples, where there are also obscure bands of black; crown with a  concealed crest, which is vivid crimson at the base and blackish at the  tips; inner margin of the covers, quills and tail blackish; inner covers  yellowish; chin, neck and breast banded with blackish lines, which are  broken into spots and stripes beyond.    Inhabits Brazil, but is very rare.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 50    [Illustration]    ALCEDO Asiatica.    _Asiatic Kingsfisher._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 26.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _A. capite nigro, fasciis transversis cyaneis, postice cristato;      auribus cyaneis; mento, gula, strigaque laterali colli albescentibus;      dorso nitide caeruleo;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39472"],[0,"Zoological Illustrations, Volume 2 (#17)"],[1,"           68      _hairy-breasted_                       72      Trochilus, Gen.
