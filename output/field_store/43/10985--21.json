A flexible vice may not be so easy to ridicule as a rigid  virtue. It is rigidity that society eyes with suspicion. Consequently,  it is the rigidity of Alceste that makes us laugh, though here rigidity  stands for honesty. The man who withdraws into himself is liable to  ridicule, because the comic is largely made up of this very withdrawal.  This accounts for the comic being so frequently dependent on the  manners or ideas, or, to put it bluntly, on the prejudices, of a  society.    It must be acknowledged, however, to the credit of mankind, that there  is no essential difference between the social ideal and the rule, that  it is the faults of others that make us laugh, provided we add that  they make us laugh by reason of their UNSOCIABILITY rather than of  their IMMORALITY. What, then, are the faults capable of becoming  ludicrous, and in what circumstances do we regard them as being too  serious to be laughed at?    We have already given an implicit answer to this question. The comic,  we said, appeals to the intelligence, pure and simple; laughter is  incompatible with emotion. Depict some fault, however trifling, in such  a way as to arouse sympathy, fear, or pity; the mischief is done, it is  impossible for us to laugh. On the other hand, take a downright  vice,--even one that is, generally speaking, of an odious nature,--you  may make it ludicrous if, by some suitable contrivance, you arrange so  that it leaves our emotions unaffected. Not that the vice must then be  ludicrous, but it MAY, from that time forth, become so. IT MUST NOT  AROUSE OUR FEELINGS; that is the sole condition really necessary,  though assuredly it is not sufficient.    But, then, how will the comic poet set to work to prevent our feelings  being moved? The question is an embarrassing one. To clear it up  thoroughly, we should have to enter upon a rather novel line of  investigation, to analyse the artificial sympathy which we bring with  us to the theatre, and determine upon the circumstances in which we  accept and those in which we refuse to share imaginary joys and  sorrows. There is an art of lulling sensibility to sleep and providing  it with dreams, as happens in the case of a mesmerised person. And  there is also an art of throwing a wet blanket upon sympathy at the  very moment it might arise, the result being that the situation, though  a serious one, is not taken seriously. This latter art would appear to  be governed by two methods, which are applied more or less  unconsciously by the comic poet. The first consists in ISOLATING,  within the soul of the character, the feeling attributed to him, and  making it a parasitic organism, so to speak, endowed with an  independent existence. As a general rule, an intense feeling  successively encroaches upon all other mental states and colours them  with its own peculiar hue; if, then, we are made to witness this  gradual impregnation, we finally become impregnated ourselves with a  corresponding emotion. To employ a different image, an emotion may be  said to be dramatic and contagious when all the harmonics in it are  heard along with the fundamental note. It is because the actor thus  thrills throughout his whole being that the spectators themselves feel  the thrill. On the contrary, in the case of emotion that leaves us  indifferent and that is about to become comic, there is always present  a certain rigidity which prevents it from establishing a connection  with the rest of the soul in which it has taken up its abode. This  rigidity may be manifested, when the time comes, by puppet-like  movements, and then it will provoke laughter; but, before that, it had  already alienated our sympathy: how can we put ourselves in tune with a  soul which is not in tune with itself? In Moliere's L'Avare we have a  scene bordering upon drama. It is the one in which the borrower and the  usurer, who have never seen each other, meet face to face and find that  they are son and father. Here we should be in the thick of a drama, if  only greed and fatherly affection, conflicting with each other in the  soul of Harpagon, had effected a more or less original combination. But  such is not the case. No sooner has the interview come to an end than  the father forgets everything. On meeting his son again he barely  alludes to the scene, serious though it has been: \"You, my son, whom I  am good enough to forgive your recent escapade, etc.\" Greed has thus  passed close to all other feelings ABSENTMINDEDLY, without either  touching them or being touched. Although it has taken up its abode in  the soul and become master of the house, none the less it remains a  stranger. Far different would be avarice of a tragic sort. We should  find it attracting and absorbing, transforming and assimilating the  divers energies of the man: feelings and affections, likes and  dislikes, vices and virtues, would all become something into which  avarice would breathe a new kind of life. Such seems to be the first  essential difference between high-class comedy and drama.    There is a second, which is far more obvious and arises out of the  first. When a mental state is depicted to us with the object of making  it dramatic, or even merely of inducing us to take it seriously, it  gradually crystallises into ACTIONS which provide the real measure of  its greatness. Thus, the miser orders his whole life with a view to  acquiring wealth, and the pious hypocrite, though pretending to have  his eyes fixed upon heaven, steers most skilfully his course here  below. Most certainly, comedy does not shut out calculations of this  kind; we need only take as an example the very machinations of  Tartuffe. But that is what comedy has in common with drama; and in  order to keep distinct from it, to prevent our taking a serious action  seriously, in short, in order to prepare us for laughter, comedy  utilises a method, the formula of which may be given as follows:  INSTEAD OF CONCENTRATING OUR ATTENTION ON ACTIONS, COMEDY DIRECTS IT  RATHER TO GESTURES. By GESTURES we here mean the attitudes, the  movements and even the language by which a mental state expresses  itself outwardly without any aim or profit, from no other cause than a  kind of inner itching. Gesture, thus defined, is profoundly different  from action. Action is intentional or, at any rate, conscious; gesture  slips out unawares, it is automatic. In action, the entire person is  engaged; in gesture, an isolated part of the person is expressed,  unknown to, or at least apart from, the whole of the personality.  Lastly--and here is the essential point--action is in exact proportion  to the feeling that inspires it: the one gradually passes into the  other, so that we may allow our sympathy or our aversion to glide along  the line running from feeling to action and become increasingly  interested. About gesture, however, there is something explosive, which  awakes our sensibility when on the point of being lulled to sleep and,  by thus rousing us up, prevents our taking matters seriously. Thus, as  soon as our attention is fixed on gesture and not on action, we are in  the realm of comedy. Did we merely take his actions into account,  Tartuffe would belong to drama: it is only when we take his gestures  into consideration that we find him comic. You may remember how he  comes on to the stage with the words: \"Laurent, lock up my hair-shirt  and my scourge.\" He knows Dorine is listening to him, but doubtless he  would say the same if she were not there. He enters so thoroughly into  the role of a hypocrite that he plays it almost sincerely. In this way,  and this way only, can he become comic. Were it not for this material  sincerity, were it not for the language and attitudes that his  long-standing experience as a hypocrite has transformed into natural  gestures, Tartuffe would be simply odious, because we should only think  of what is meant and willed in his conduct. And so we see why action is  essential in drama, but only accessory in comedy. In a comedy, we feel  any other situation might equally well have been chosen for the purpose  of introducing the character; he would still have been the same man  though the situation were different. But we do not get this impression  in a drama. Here characters and situations are welded together, or  rather, events form part and parcel with the persons, so that were the  drama to tell us a different story, even though the actors kept the  same names, we should in reality be dealing with other persons.    To sum up, whether a character is good or bad is of little moment:  granted he is unsociable, he is capable of becoming comic. We now see  that the seriousness of the case is of no importance either: whether  serious or trifling, it is still capable of making us laugh, provided  that care be taken not to arouse our emotions. Unsociability in the  performer and insensibility in the spectator--such, in a word, are the  two essential conditions. There is a third, implicit in the other two,  which so far it has been the aim of our analysis to bring out.    This third condition is automatism. We have pointed it out from the  outset of this work, continually drawing attention to the following  point: what is essentially laughable is what is done automatically. In  a vice, even in a virtue, the comic is that element by which the person  unwittingly betrays himself--the involuntary gesture or the unconscious  remark. Absentmindedness is always comical. Indeed, the deeper the  absentmindedness the higher the comedy. Systematic absentmindedness,  like that of Don Quixote, is the most comical thing imaginable: it is  the comic itself, drawn as nearly as possible from its very source.  Take any other comic character: however unconscious he may be of what  he says or does, he cannot be comical unless there be some aspect of  his person of which he is unaware, one side of his nature which he  overlooks;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4357"],[0,"American Fairy Tales (#17)"],[1,"augh, and one said:    \"Our mighty king has become a bird! Who ever before heard of a  feathered polar bear?\"    Then the king gave way to wrath. He advanced upon them with deep  growls and stately tread and with one blow of his monstrous paw  stretched the mocker lifeless at his feet.    The other ran away to his fellows and carried the news of the king's  strange appearance. The result was a meeting of all the polar bears  upon a broad field of ice, where they talked gravely of the  remarkable change that had come upon their monarch.    \"He is, in reality, no longer a bear,\" said one; \"nor can he justly  be called a bird. But he is half bird and half bear, and so unfitted  to remain our king.\"    \"Then who shall take his place?\" asked another.    \"He who can fight the bird-bear and overcome him,\" answered an aged  member of the group. \"Only the strongest is fit to rule our race.\"    There was silence for a time, but at length a great bear moved to  the front and said:    \"I will fight him; I--Woof--the strongest of our race! And I will be  King of the Polar Bears.\"    The others nodded assent, and dispatched a messenger to the king to  say he must fight the great Woof and master him or resign his  sovereignty.    \"For a bear with feathers,\" added the messenger, \"is no bear at all,  and the king we obey must resemble the rest of us.\"    \"I wear feathers because it pleases me,\" growled the king. \"Am I not  a great magician? But I will fight, nevertheless, and if Woof  masters me he shall be king in my stead.\"    Then he visited his friends, the gulls, who were even then feasting  upon the dead bear, and told them of the coming battle.    \"I shall conquer,\" he said, proudly. \"Yet my people are in the  right, for only a hairy one like themselves can hope to command  their obedience.\"    The queen gull said:    \"I met an eagle yesterday, which had made its escape from a big city  of men. And the eagle told me he had seen a monstrous polar bear  skin thrown over the back of a carriage that rolled along the  street. That skin must have been yours, oh king, and if you wish I  will sent an hundred of my gulls to the city to bring it back to  you.\"    \"Let them go!\" said the king, gruffly. And the hundred gulls were  soon flying rapidly southward.    For three days they flew straight as an arrow, until they came to  scattered houses, to villages, and to cities. Then their search  began.    The gulls were brave, and cunning, and wise. Upon the fourth day  they reached the great metropolis, and hovered over the streets  until a carriage rolled along with a great white bear robe thrown  over the back seat. Then the birds swooped down--the whole hundred  of them--and seizing the skin in their beaks flew quickly away.    They were late. The king's great battle was upon the seventh day,  and they must fly swiftly to reach the Polar regions by that time.    Meanwhile the bird-bear was preparing for his fight. He sharpened  his claws in the small crevasses of the ice. He caught a seal and  tested his big yellow teeth by crunching its bones between them. And  the queen gull set her band to pluming the king bear's feathers  until they lay smoothly upon his body.    But every day they cast anxious glances into the southern sky,  watching for the hundred gulls to bring back the king's own skin.    The seventh day came, and all the Polar bears in that region  gathered around the king's cavern. Among them was Woof, strong and  confident of his success.    \"The bird-bear's feathers will fly fast enough when I get my claws  upon him!\" he boasted; and the others laughed and encouraged him.    The king was disappointed at not having recovered his skin, but he  resolved to fight bravely without it. He advanced from the opening  of his cavern with a proud and kingly bearing, and when he faced his  enemy he gave so terrible a growl that Woof's heart stopped beating  for a moment, and he began to realize that a fight with the wise and  mighty king of his race was no laughing matter.    After exchanging one or two heavy blows with his foe Woof's courage  returned, and he determined to dishearten his adversary by bluster.    \"Come nearer, bird-bear!\" he cried. \"Come nearer, that I may pluck  your plumage!\"    The defiance filled the king with rage. He ruffled his feathers as a  bird does, till he appeared to be twice his actual size, and then he  strode forward and struck Woof so powerful a blow that his skull  crackled like an egg-shell and he fell prone upon the ground.    While the assembled bears stood looking with fear and wonder at  their fallen champion the sky became darkened.    An hundred gulls flew down from above and dripped upon the king's  body a skin covered with pure white hair that glittered in the sun  like silver.    And behold! the bears saw before them the well-known form of their  wise and respected master, and with one accord they bowed their  shaggy heads in homage to the mighty King of the Polar Bears.    * * * * *    This story teaches us that true dignity and courage depend not upon  outward appearance, but come rather from within; also that brag and  bluster are poor weapons to carry into battle.          THE MANDARIN AND THE BUTTERFLY      A mandarin once lived in Kiang-ho who was so exceedingly cross and  disagreeable that everyone hated him. He snarled and stormed at  every person he met and was never known to laugh or be merry under  any circumstances. Especially he hated boys and girls; for the boys  jeered at him, which aroused his wrath, and the girls made fun of  him, which hurt his pride.    When he had become so unpopular that no one would speak to him, the  emperor heard about it and commanded him to emigrate to America.  This suited the mandarin very well; but before he left China he  stole the Great Book of Magic that belonged to the wise magician  Haot-sai. Then, gathering up his little store of money, he took ship  for America.    He settled in a city of the middle west and of course started a  laundry, since that seems to be the natural vocation of every  Chinaman, be he coolie or mandarin.    He made no acquaintances with the other Chinamen of the town, who,  when they met him and saw the red button in his hat, knew him for a  real mandarin and bowed low before him. He put up a red and white  sign and people brought their laundry to him and got paper checks,  with Chinese characters upon them, in exchange, this being the only  sort of character the mandarin had left.    One day as the ugly one was ironing in his shop in the basement of  263 1/2 Main street, he looked up and saw a crowd of childish faces  pressed against the window. Most Chinamen make friends with  children; this one hated them and tried to drive them away. But as  soon as he returned to his work they were back at the window again,  mischievously smiling down upon him.    The naughty mandarin uttered horrid words in the Manchu language and  made fierce gestures; but this did no good at all. The children  stayed as long as they pleased, and they came again the very next  day as soon as school was over, and likewise the next day, and the  next. For they saw their presence at the window bothered the  Chinaman and were delighted accordingly.    The following day being Sunday the children did not appear, but as  the mandarin, being a heathen, worked in his little shop a big  butterfly flew in at the open door and fluttered about the room.    The mandarin closed the door and chased the butterfly until he  caught it, when he pinned it against the wall by sticking two pins  through its beautiful wings. This did not hurt the butterfly, there  being no feeling in its wings; but it made him a safe prisoner.    This butterfly was of large size and its wings were exquisitely  marked by gorgeous colors laid out in regular designs like the  stained glass windows of a cathedral.    The mandarin now opened his wooden chest and drew forth the Great  Book of Magic he had stolen from Haot-sai. Turning the pages slowly  he came to a passage describing \"How to understand the language of  butterflies.\" This he read carefully and then mixed a magic formula  in a tin cup and drank it down with a wry face. Immediately  thereafter he spoke to the butterfly in its own language, saying:    \"Why did you enter this room?\"    \"I smelled bees-wax,\" answered the butterfly; \"therefore I thought  I might find honey here.\"    \"But you are my prisoner,\" said the mandarin. \"If I please I can kill  you, or leave you on the wall to starve to death.\"    \"I expect that,\" replied the butterfly, with a sigh. \"But my race is  shortlived, anyway; it doesn't matter whether death comes sooner or  later.\"    \"Yet you like to live, do you not?\" asked the mandarin.    \"Yet; life is pleasant and the world is beautiful. I do not seek  death.\"    \"Then,\" said the mandarin, \"I will give you life--a long and  pleasant life--if you will promise to obey me for a time and carry  out my instructions.\"    \"How can a butterfly serve a man?\" asked the creature, in surprise.    \"Usually they cannot,\" was the reply. \"But I have a book of magic  which teaches me strange things. Do you promise?\"    \"Oh, yes; I promise,\" answered the butterfly; \"for even as your  slave I will get some enjoyment out of life, while should you kill  me--that is the end of everything!\"    \"Truly,\" said the mandarin, \"butterflies have no souls, and  therefore cannot live again.\"    \"But I have enjoyed three lives already,\" returned the butterfly,  with some pride. \"I have been a caterpillar and a chrysalis before I  became a butterfly. You were never anything but a Chinaman, although  I admit your life is longer than mine.\"    \"I will extend your life for many days, if you will obey me,\"  declared the Chinaman. \"I can easily do so by means of my magic.\"    \"Of course I will obey you,\" said the butterfly, carelessly.    \"Then, listen! You know children, do you not?--boys and girls?\"    \"Yes, I know them. They chase me,"]]]
