It was doubtless this last miracle which brought the Bishop  of Poitiers to Loudun, \"not,\" as he said to those who came to pay their  respects to him, \"to examine into the genuineness of the possession, but  to force those to believe who still doubted, and to discover the classes  which Urbain had founded to teach the black art to pupils of both  sexes.\"    Thereupon the opinion began to prevail among the people that it would be  prudent to believe in the possession, since the king, the cardinal-duke,  and the bishop believed in it, and that continued doubt would lay them  open to the charges of disloyalty to their king and their Church, and of  complicity in the crimes of Grandier, and thus draw down upon them the  ruthless punishment of Laubardemont.    \"The reason we feel so certain that our work is pleasing to God is that  it is also pleasing to the king,\" wrote Pere Lactance.    The arrival of the bishop was followed by a new exorcism; and of this an  eye-witness, who was a good Catholic and a firm believer in possession,  has left us a written description, more interesting than any we could  give. We shall present it to our readers, word for word, as it stands:--    \"On Friday, 23rd June 1634, on the Eve of Saint John, about 3 p.m., the  Lord Bishop of Poitiers and M. de Laubardemont being present in the  church of Sainte-Croix of Loudun, to continue the exorcisms of the  Ursuline nuns, by order of M. de Laubardemont, commissioner, Urbain  Grandier, priest-in-charge, accused and denounced as a magician by the  said possessed nuns, was brought from his prison to the said church.    \"There were produced by the said commissioner to the said Urbain  Grandier four pacts mentioned several times by the said possessed nuns  at the preceding exorcisms, which the devils who possessed the nuns  declared they had made with the said Grandier on several occasions:  there was one in especial which Leviathan gave up on Saturday the 17th  inst., composed of an infant's heart procured at a witches' sabbath,  held in Orleans in 1631; the ashes of a consecrated wafer, blood, etc.,  of the said Grandier, whereby Leviathan asserted he had entered the body  of the sister, Jeanne des Anges, the superior of the said nuns, and took  possession of her with his coadjutors Beherit, Eazas, and Balaam, on  December 8th, 1632. Another such pact was composed of the pips of  Grenada oranges, and was given up by Asmodeus and a number of other  devils. It had been made to hinder Beherit from keeping his promise to  lift the commissioner's hat two inches from his head and to hold it  there the length of a Miseyere, as a sign that he had come out of the  nun. On all these pacts being shown to the said Grandier, he said,  without astonishment, but with much firmness and resolution, that he had  no knowledge of them whatever, that he had never made them, and had not  the skill by which to make them, that he had held no communication with  devils, and knew nothing of what they were talking about. A report of  all this being made and shown to him, he signed it.    \"This done, they brought all the possessed nuns, to the number of eleven  or twelve, including three lay sisters, also possessed, into the choir  of the said church, accompanied by a great many monks, Carmelites,  Capuchins, and Franciscans; and by three physicians and a surgeon. The  sisters on entering made some wanton remarks, calling Grandier their  master, and exhibiting great delight at seeing him.    \"Thereupon Pere Lactance and Gabriel, a Franciscan brother, and one of  the exorcists, exhorted all present with great fervour to lift up their  hearts to God and to make an act of contrition for the offences  committed against His divine majesty, and to pray that the number of  their sins might not be an obstacle to the fulfilment of the plans which  He in His providence had formed for the promotion of His glory on that  occasion, and to give outward proof of their heartfelt grief by  repeating the Confiteor as a preparation for the blessing of the Lord  Bishop of Poitiers. This having been done, he went on to say that the  matter in question was of such moment and so important in its relation  to the great truths of the Roman Catholic Church, that this  consideration alone ought to be sufficient to excite their devotion; and  furthermore, that the affliction of these poor sisters was so peculiar  and had lasted so long, that charity impelled all those who had the  right to work for their deliverance and the expulsion of the devils, to  employ the power entrusted to them with their office in accomplishing so  worthy a task by the forms of exorcism prescribed by the Church to its  ministers; then addressing Grandier, he said that he having been  anointed as a priest belonged to this number, and that he ought to help  with all his power and with all his energy, if the bishop were pleased  to allow him to do so, and to remit his suspension from authority. The  bishop having granted permission, the Franciscan friar offered a stole  to Grandier, who, turning towards the prelate, asked him if he might  take it. On receiving a reply in the affirmative, he passed it round his  neck, and on being offered a copy of the ritual, he asked permission to  accept it as before, and received the bishop's blessing, prostrating  himself at his feet to kiss them; whereupon the Veni Creator Spiritus  having been sung, he rose, and addressing the bishop, asked--    \"'My lord, whom am I to exorcise?'\"    The said bishop having replied--    \"'These maidens.'    \"Grandier again asked--    \"'What maidens?'    \"'The possessed maidens,' was the answer.    \"'That is to say, my lord,' said he; 'that I am obliged to believe in  the fact of possession. The Church believes in it, therefore I too  believe; but I cannot believe that a sorcerer can cause a Christian to  be possessed unless the Christian consent.'    \"Upon this, some of those present exclaimed that it was heretical to  profess such a belief; that the contrary was indubitable, believed by  the whole Church and approved by the Sorbonne. To which he replied that  his mind on that point was not yet irrevocably made up, that what he had  said was simply his own idea, and that in any case he submitted to the  opinion of the whole body of which he was only a member; that nobody was  declared a heretic for having doubts, but only for persisting in them,  and that what he had advanced was only for the purpose of drawing an  assurance from the bishop that in doing what he was about to do he would  not be abusing the authority of the Church. Sister Catherine having been  brought to him by the Franciscan as the most ignorant of all the nuns,  and the least open to the suspicion of being acquainted with Latin, he  began the exorcism in the form prescribed by the ritual. But as soon as  he began to question her he was interrupted, for all the other nuns were  attacked by devils, and uttered strange and terrible noises. Amongst the  rest, Sister Claire came near, and reproached him for his blindness and  obstinacy, so that he was forced to leave the nun with whom he had  begun, and address his words to the said Sister Claire, who during the  entire duration of the exorcism continued to talk at random, without  paying any heed to Grandier's words, which were also interrupted by the  mother superior, to whom he of last gave attention, leaving Sister  Claire. But it is to be noted that before beginning to exorcise the  superior, he said, speaking in Latin as heretofore, that knowing she  understood Latin, he would question her in Greek. To which the devil  replied by the mouth of the possessed:    \"'Ah! how clever you are! You know it was one of the first conditions of  our pact that I was not to answer in Greek.'    \"Upon this, he cried, 'O pulchra illusio, egregica evasio!' ( O superb  fraud, outrageous evasion!)    \"He was then told that he was permitted to exorcise in Greek, provided  he first wrote down what he wished to say, and the superior hereupon  said that he should be answered in what language he pleased; but it was  impossible, for as soon as he opened his mouth all the nuns recommenced  their shrieks and paroxysms, showing unexampled despair, and giving way  to convulsions, which in each patient assumed a new form, and persisting  in accusing Grandier of using magic and the black art to torment them;  offering to wring his neck if they were allowed, and trying to outrage  his feelings in every possible way. But this being against the  prohibitions of the Church, the priests and monks present worked with  the utmost zeal to calm the frenzy which had seized on the nuns.  Grandier meanwhile remained calm and unmoved, gazing fixedly at the  maniacs, protesting his innocence, and praying to God for protection.  Then addressing himself to the bishop and M. de Laubardemont, he  implored them by the ecclesiastical and royal authority of which they  were the ministers to command these demons to wring his neck, or at  least to put a mark in his forehead, if he were guilty of the crime of  which they accused him, that the glory of God might be shown forth, the  authority of the Church vindicated, and himself brought to confusion,  provided that the nuns did not touch him with their hands. But to this  the bishop and the commissioner would not consent, because they did not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2748"],[0,"Derues (#17)"],[1,"ry,\" said he, \"impressed me much; yours only  brings back my uncertainty. It is less possible than ever to deliver any  opinion on this serious question of dreams, since the second instance  contradicts the first.\"    \"It is true,\" answered the cure, \"no possible conclusion can be drawn  from two facts which contradict each other, and the best thing we can do  is to choose a less dismal subject of conversation.\"    \"Monsieur Derues;\" asked Monsieur de Lamatte, \"if you are not too tired  with your journey, shall we go and look at the last improvements I have  made? It is now your affair to decide upon them, since I shall shortly  be only your guest here.\"    \"Just as I have been yours for long enough, and I trust you will often  give me the opportunity of exercising hospitality in my turn. But you  are ill, the day is cold and damp; if you do not care to go out, do not  let me disturb you. Had you not better stay by the fire with Monsieur le  cure? For me, Heaven be thanked! I require no assistance. I will look  round the park, and come back presently to tell you what I think.  Besides, we shall have plenty of time to talk about it. With your  permission, I should like to stay two or three days.\"    \"I shall be pleased if you will do so.\"    Derues went out, sufficiently uneasy in his mind, both on account of his  reception of Monsieur de Lamotte's fears and of the manner in which the  latter had watched him during the conversation. He walked quickly up and  down the park--    \"I have been foolish, perhaps; I have lost twelve or fifteen days, and  delayed stupidly from fear of not foreseeing everything. But then, how  was I to imagine that this simple, easily deceived man would all at once  become suspicious? What a strange dream! If I had not been on my guard,  I might have been disconcerted. Come, come, I must try to disperse these  ideas and give him something else to think about.\"    He stopped, and after a few minutes consideration turned back towards  the house.    As soon as he had left the room, Monsieur de Lamotte had bent over  towards the cure, and had said--    \"He did not show any emotion, did--he?\"    \"None whatever.\"    \"He did not start when I spoke of the man armed with those two daggers?\"    \"No. But put aside these ideas; you must see they are mistaken.\"    \"I did not tell everything, my father: this murderer whom I saw in my  dream--was Derues himself! I know as well as you that it must be a  delusion, I saw as well as you did that he remained quite calm, but, in  spite of myself, this terrible dream haunts me . . . .There, do not  listen to me, do not let me talk about it; it only makes me blush for  myself.\"    Whilst Derues remained at Buisson-Souef, Monsieur de Lamotte received  several letters from his wife, some from Paris, some from Versailles.  She remarked that her son and herself were perfectly well.... The  writing was so well imitated that no one could doubt their genuineness.  However, Monsieur de Lamotte's suspicions continually increased and he  ended by making the cure share his fears. He also refused to go with  Derues to Paris, in spite of the latter's entreaties. Derues, alarmed at  the coldness shown him, left Buisson-Souef, saying that he intended to  take possession about the middle of spring.    Monsieur de Lamotte was, in spite of himself, still detained by  ill-health. But a new and inexplicable circumstance made him resolve to  go to Paris and endeavour to clear up the mystery which appeared to  surround his wife and son. He received an unsigned letter in unknown  handwriting, and in which Madame de Lamotte's reputation was attacked  with a kind of would-be reticence, which hinted that she was an  unfaithful wife and that in this lay the cause of her long absence. Her  husband did not believe this anonymous denunciation, but the fate of the  two beings dearest to him seemed shrouded in so much obscurity that he  could delay no longer, and started for Paris.    His resolution not to accompany Derues had saved his life. The latter  could not carry out his culminating crime at Buisson-Souef; it was only  in Paris that his victims would disappear without his being called to  account. Obliged to leave hold of his prey, he endeavoured to bewilder  him in a labyrinth where all trace of truth might be lost. Already, as  he had arranged beforehand, he had called calumny to his help, and  prepared the audacious lie which was to vindicate himself should an  accusation fall upon his head. He had hoped that Monsieur de Lamotte  would fall defenceless into his hands; but now a careful examination of  his position, showing the impossibility of avoiding an explanation had  become inevitable, made him change all his plans, and compelled him to  devise an infernal plot, so skilfully laid that it bid fair to defeat  all human sagacity.    Monsieur de Lamotte arrived in Paris early in March. Chance decided that  he should lodge in the rue de la Mortellerie, in a house not far from  the one where his wife's body lay buried. He went to see Derues, hoping  to surprise him, and determined to make him speak, but found he was not  at home. Madame Derues, whether acting with the discretion of an  accomplice or really ignorant of her husband's proceedings, could not  say where he was likely to be found. She said that he told her nothing  about his actions, and that Monsieur de Lamotte must have observed  during their stay at Buisson (which was true) that she never questioned  him, but obeyed his wishes in everything; and that he had now gone away  without saying where he was going. She acknowledged that Madame de  Lamotte had lodged with them for six weeks, and that she knew that lady  had been at Versailles, but since then she had heard nothing. All  Monsieur de Lamotte's questions, his entreaties, prayers, or threats,  obtained no other answer. He went to the lawyer in the rue de Paon, to  the schoolmaster, and found the same uncertainty, the same ignorance.  His wife and his son had gone to Versailles, there the clue ended which  ought to guide his investigations. He went to this town; no one could  give him any information, the very name of Lamotte was unknown. He  returned to Paris, questioned and examined the people of the quarter,  the proprietor of the Hotel de France, where his wife had stayed on her  former visit; at length, wearied with useless efforts, he implored help  from justice. Then his complaints ceased; he was advised to maintain a  prudent silence, and to await Derues' return.    The latter thoroughly understood that, having failed to dissipate  Monsieur de Lamotte's fears, there was no longer an instant to lose, and  that the pretended private contract of February 12th would not of itself  prove the existence of Madame de Lamotte. This is how he employed the  time spent by the unhappy husband in fruitless investigation.    On March 12th, a woman, her face hidden in the hood of her cloak, or  \"Therese,\" as it was then called, appeared in the office of Maitre  N-----, a notary at Lyons. She gave her name as Marie Francoise  Perffier, wife of Monsieur Saint-Faust de Lamotte, but separated, as to  goods and estate, from him. She caused a deed to be drawn up,  authorising her husband to receive the arrears of thirty thousand livres  remaining from the price of the estate of Buisson-Souef, situated near  Villeneuve-le-Roi-lez-Sens. The deed was drawn up and signed by Madame  de Lamotte, by the notary, and one of his colleagues.    This woman was Derues. If we remember that he only arrived at Buisson  February 28th, and remained there for some days, it becomes difficult to  understand how at that period so long a journey as that from Paris to  Lyons could have been accomplished with such rapidity. Fear must have  given him wings. We will now explain what use he intended to make of it,  and what fable, a masterpiece of cunning and of lies, he had invented.    On his arrival in Paris he found a summons to appear before the  magistrate of police. He expected this, and appeared quite tranquil,  ready to answer any questions. Monsieur de Lamotte was present. It was a  formal examination, and the magistrate first asked why he had left  Paris.    \"Monsieur,\" replied Derues, \"I have nothing to hide, and none of my  actions need fear the daylight, but before replying, I should like to  understand my position. As a domiciled citizen I have a right to require  this. Will you kindly inform me why I have been summoned to appear  before you, whether on account of anything personal to myself, or simply  to give information as to something which may be within my knowledge?\"    \"You are acquainted with this gentleman, and cannot therefore be  ignorant of the cause of the present inquiry.\"    \"I am, nevertheless, quite in ignorance of it.\"    \"Be good enough to answer my question. Why did you leave Paris? And  where have you been?\"    \"I was absent for business reasons.\"    \"What business?\"    \"I shall say no more.\"    \"Take care! you have incurred serious suspicions, and silence will not  tend to clear you.\"    Derues hung down his head with an air of resignation; and Monsieur de  Lamotte, seeing in this attitude a silent confession of crime,  exclaimed, \"Wretched man! what have you done with my wife and my son?\"    \"Your son!--\" said Derues slowly and with peculiar emphasis. He again  cast down his eyes.    The magistrate conducting the inquiry was struck by the expression of  Derues' countenance and by this half answer, which appeared to hide a  mystery and to aim at diverting attention by offering a bait to  curiosity. He might have stopped Derues at the moment when he sought to  plunge into a tortuous argument, and compelled him to answer with the  same clearness and decision which distinguished Monsieur de Lamotte's  question; but he reflected that the latter's inquiries, unforeseen,  hasty, and passionate, were perhaps more likely to disconcert a prepared  defence than cooler and more"]]]
