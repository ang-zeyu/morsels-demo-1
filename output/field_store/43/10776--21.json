If the Porcupine could have  philosophized about it he would probably have said that this was the  wrong time of year for starving; and from his point of view he would  have been right. June, in the woods, is the season of plenty for  everybody but man. Man thinks he must have wheat-flour, and that doesn't  grow on pines or maple-trees, nor yet in the tamarack swamp. But was  there any wild, fierce glare in the boy's eyes, such a light of hunger  as the story-books tell us is to be seen in the eyes of the wolf and the  lynx when they have not eaten for days and days, and when the snow lies  deep in the forest, and famine comes stalking through the trees? I don't  think so. He was too weak and miserable to do any glaring, and his  stomach was aching so hard from eating green gooseberries that he could  scarcely think of anything else.    But his face brightened a very little when he saw the old she-porcupine,  and he picked up a heavy stick and waded out beside her log. She clacked  her teeth together angrily as he approached; but he paid no attention,  so she drew herself into a ball, with her head down and her nose covered  by her forepaws. Reaching across her back and down on each side was a  belt or girdle of quills, the largest and heaviest on her whole body,  which could be erected at will, and now they stood as straight as young  spruce-trees. Their tips were dark-brown, but the rest of their length  was nearly white, and when you looked at her from behind she seemed to  have a pointed white ruffle, edged with black, tied around the middle of  her body. But the boy wasn't thinking about ruffles, and he didn't care  what she did with her quills. He gave her such a thrust with his stick  that she had to grab at the log with both hands to keep from being  shoved into the water. That left her nose unprotected, and he brought  the stick down across it once, twice, three times. Then he picked her up  by one foot, very gingerly, and carried her off; and our Porky never saw  his mother again.    Perhaps we had best follow her up and see what finally became of her.  Half a mile from the scene of the murder the boy came upon a woman and a  little girl. I sha'n't try to describe them, except to say that they  were even worse off than he. Perhaps you read in the papers, some years  ago, about the woman and the two children who were lost for several  weeks in the woods of northern Michigan.    \"I've got a porky,\" said the boy.    [Illustration: \"_High up in the top of a tall hemlock._\"]    He dropped his burden on the ground, and they all stood around and  looked at it. They were hungry--oh, so hungry!--but for some reason they  did not seem very eager to begin. An old porcupine with her clothes on  is not the most attractive of feasts, and they had no knife with which  to skin her, no salt to season the meat, no fire to cook it, and no  matches with which to start one. Rubbing two sticks together is a very  good way of starting a fire when you are in a book, but it doesn't work  very well in the Great Tahquamenon Swamp. And yet, somehow or other--I  don't know how, and I don't want to--they ate that porcupine. And it did  them good. When the searchers found them, a week or two later, the woman  and the boy were dead, but the little girl was still alive, and for all  I know she is living to this day.    Let us return to the Glimmerglass. The young Porcupine ought to have  mourned deeply for his mother, but I grieve to say that he did nothing  of the kind. I doubt if he was even very lonesome. His brain was  smaller, smoother, and less corrugated than yours is supposed to be; its  wrinkles were few and not very deep; and it may be that the bump of  filial affection was quite polished, or even that there wasn't any such  bump at all. Anyhow, he got along very well without her, dispensing with  her much more easily than the woman and the boy and girl could have.  He watched stolidly while the boy killed her and carried her off, and a  little later he was eating lily-pads again.    As far as his future prospects were concerned, he had little reason for  worrying. He knew pretty well how to take care of himself, for that is a  kind of knowledge which comes early to young porcupines. Really, there  wasn't much to learn. His quills would protect him from most of his  enemies, if not from all of them; and, what was still better, he need  never suffer from a scarcity of food. Of all the animals in the woods  the porcupine is probably the safest from starvation, for he can eat  anything from the soft green leaves of the water-plants to the bark and  the small twigs of the tallest hemlock. Summer and winter, his  storehouse is always full. The young lions may lack, and suffer hunger,  and seek their meat from God; but the young porky has only to climb a  tree and set his teeth at work. All the woods are his huckleberry.    And, by the way, our Porcupine's teeth were a great institution,  especially the front ones, and were well worthy of a somewhat detailed  description. They were long and sharp and yellow, and there were two in  the upper jaw and two in the lower, with a wide gap on each side between  them and the molars. They kept right on growing as long as he lived, and  there is no telling how far they would have gone if there had been  nothing to stop them. Fortunately, he did a great deal of eating and  chewing, and the constant friction kept them worn down, and at the same  time served to sharpen them. Like a beaver's, they were formed of thin  shells of hard enamel in front, backed up by softer pulp behind; and of  course the soft parts wore away first, and left the enamel projecting in  sharp, chisel-like edges that could gnaw crumbs from a hickory  axe-handle.    The next few months were pleasant ones, with plenty to eat, and nothing  to do but keep his jaws going. By and by the leaves began to fall, and  whenever the Porky walked abroad they rustled around him like silk  skirts going down the aisle of a church. A little later the beechnuts  came down from the sky, and he feasted more luxuriously than ever. His  four yellow chisels tore the brown shells open, his molars ground the  sweet kernels into meal, and he ate and ate till his short legs could  hardly keep his fat little belly off the ground.    Then came the first light snow, and his feet left tracks which bore a  faint resemblance to a baby's--that is, if your imagination was  sufficiently vigorous. The snow grew deeper and deeper, and after a  while he had to fairly plough his way from the hollow log to the tree  where he took his meals. It was hard work, for his clumsy legs were not  made for wading, and at every step he had to lift and drag himself  forward, and then let his body drop while he shifted his feet. A  porcupine's feet will not go of themselves, the way other animals' do.  They have to be picked up one at a time and lifted forward as far as  they can reach--not very far at the best, for they are fastened to the  ends of very short legs. It almost seems as if he could run faster if he  could drop them off and leave them behind. One evening, when the snow  was beginning to freeze again after a thawing day, he lay down to rest  for a few minutes; and when he started on, some of his quills were fast  in the hardening crust and had to be left behind. But no matter how  difficult the walk might be, there was always a good square meal at the  end of it, and he pushed valiantly on till he reached his dinner-table.    Sometimes he stayed in the same tree for several days at a time,  quenching his thirst with snow, and sleeping in a crotch.    He was not by any means the only porcupine in the woods around the  Glimmerglass, although weeks sometimes passed without his seeing any of  his relations. At other times there were from one to half a dozen  porkies in the trees close by, and when they happened to feel like it  they would call back and forth to each other in queer, harsh, and often  querulous voices.    One afternoon, when he and another porcupine were occupying trees next  each other, two land-lookers came along and camped for the night between  them. Earlier in the day the men had crossed the trail of a pack of  wolves, and they talked of it as they cut their firewood, and, with all  the skill of the _voyageurs_ of old, cooked their scanty supper, and  made their bed of balsam boughs. The half-breed was much afraid that  they would have visitors before morning, but the white man only laughed  at the idea.    The meal was hardly finished when they lay down between their  blankets--the white man to sleep, and the half-breed to listen, listen,  listen for the coming of the wolves. Beyond the camp-fire's little  circle of ruddy light, vague shadows moved mysteriously, as if living  things were prowling about among the trees and only waiting for him to  fall asleep. Yet there was no wolf-howl to be heard, nor anything else  to break the silence of the winter night, save possibly the dropping of  a dead branch, or the splitting open of a tree-trunk, torn apart by the  frost. And by and by, in spite of himself, the half-breed's eyelids  began to droop.    But somebody else was awake--awake, and tempted with a great temptation.  The porcupine--not ours, but the other one--had caught the fragrance of  coffee and bacon. Here were new odors--different from anything that had  ever before tickled his nostrils--strange, but indescribably delicious.  He waited till the land-lookers were snoring, and then he started down  the tree. Half-way to the ground he encountered the cloud of smoke that  rose from the camp-fire. Here was another new odor, but with nothing  pleasant about it. It stung his nostrils and made his eyes smart, and he  scrambled up again as fast as he could go, his claws and quills rattling  on the bark.

The Buffalo, seeing him  approach, rose and shook his head as a prelude to immediate hostilities.  My friend fired, and hit him on the side. The enraged brute came  thundering at the doctor, who lost no time in running round to the  opposite side of the elephant; the _mohout_, at the same time, pushed  forward, to meet and screen him from the Buffalo, which absolutely put  his horns under the elephant's belly, and endeavoured to raise him from  the ground. We had no other gun, and might, perhaps, have felt some more  severe effects from the doctor's frolic, had not the Buffalo, from loss  of blood, dropped at our side. The Buffalo was upwards of six feet high  at the shoulder, and measured nearly a yard in breadth at the chest. His  horns were above five feet and a half in length.\"    In systems of classification, even of very recent date, the Arnee is  considered merely as a variety of the Buffalo. It appears to me,  however, that our information on the subject is not yet sufficiently  precise to determine this point.    [Illustration]    FOOTNOTES:    [A] In Shaw's 'Zoology,' it is mentioned that a Mr. Dillon saw some  horns in India which were ten feet long.          THE ZAMOUSE, OR BUSH COW.    _Bos Brachyceros._      [Illustration]    [The following extract, from the 'Annals of Nat. Hist.,' vol. ii, p.  284, is from the pen of Mr. J. E. Gray.]    \"Captain Clapperton and Colonel Denham, when they returned from their  expedition in Northern and Central Africa, brought with them two heads  of a species of Ox, covered with their skins. These heads are the  specimens which are mentioned in Messrs. Children and Vigors' accounts  of the animals collected in the expedition, as belonging to the  Buffalo, _Bos Bubalus_, and they are stated to be called _Zamouse_ by  the natives; but, as no particular locality is given for the head, this  name is probably the one applied to the common Buffalo, which is found  in most parts of North Africa.    \"Having some years ago compared these heads with the skull of the common  Buffalo, _Bos Bubalus_, and satisfied myself, from the difference in the  form and position of the horns, that they were a distinct species, in  the 'Mag. of Nat. Hist.,' for 1837 (new series, vol. i, p. 589), I  indicated them as a new species, under the name of _Bos Brachyceros_.    \"In the course of this summer (1838), Mr. Cross, of the Surrey  Zoological Gardens, received from Sierra Leone, under the name of the  _Bush Cow_, a specimen which serves more fully to establish the species.  It differs from the Buffalo and all other oxen in several important  characters, especially in the large size and particular bearding of the  ears, and in being totally deficient in any dewlap. It also differs from  the Buffalo in its forehead, being flatter and quite destitute of the  convex form which is so striking in all the varieties of that animal.    \"Mr. Cross's cow is, like the head in the Museum, of a nearly uniform  pale chesnut colour. The hair is rather scattered, and nearly  perpendicular to the surface of the body. The legs, about the knees and  hocks, are rather darker. The ears are very large, with two rows of very  long hairs on the inner side, and a tuft of long hairs at the tips. The  body is short and barrel-shaped, and the tail reaches to the hocks,  rather thin and tapering, with a tuft of long hairs at the tip. The  chest is rounded and rather dependent, but without the least appearance  of a dewlap; and the horns nearly resemble those of the Museum  specimen, but are less developed, from the sex and evidently greater  youth of the animal. The Rev. Mr. Morgan informs me that the animal is  not rare in the bush near Sierra Leone.    \"I have added a slight sketch of Mr. Cross's animal, which I hope will  enable any person to distinguish this very distinct and interesting  addition to the species of this useful genus.\"    The engraving at the head of this article is a reduced copy of Mr.  Gray's figure just alluded to. The following representation of the head  is from a specimen in the British Museum.    [Illustration]          THE MUSK OX.    _Bos Moschatus._      [Illustration]    The Musk-ox, in its external appearance, more nearly resembles the Yak  of Thibet than any other member of the Bos genus; and they both inhabit  mountainous districts near regions of perpetual snow.    The horns of the Musk Bull are remarkably broad at their bases, which  are closely united; they bend down on each side of the head, with an  outward curve turning upwards towards their ends, which taper to a sharp  point. They are two feet long measured along the curvature, and two feet  in girth at the base; the weight of a pair of these horns is sometimes  sixty pounds. The broad base of the horn is hollow on the inside, and of  a form approaching to a square; when this is separated from the head and  the other part of the horn, it forms a convenient dish, which is very  generally used by the native Esquimaux for many domestic purposes.    The horns of the cow are nine inches distant from each other at the  base, and are placed exactly on the sides of the head; they are thirteen  inches long, and eight or nine inches round at the base.    The head and the body generally is covered with very long silky hairs of  a dark colour; some of which are seventeen inches long; on the middle of  the back (which is broad and flat), the hair is lighter and not so long.  Beneath the long hairs, in all parts, there is a thick coat of cinereous  wool of exquisite fineness. M. Jeramie brought some to France, of which  stockings were made more beautiful than silk.    The tail is only three inches long, and completely covered with very  long hairs, so as to be undistinguishable to the sight. Of this tail,  the Esquimaux of the northwest side of Hudson's Bay, make a cap of a  most horrible appearance, for the hairs fall all round their heads, and  cover their faces; yet it is of singular service in keeping off the  musquitoes, which would otherwise be intolerable.    The ears are only three inches long, quite erect, and sharp pointed, but  dilate much in the middle; they are thickly lined with hair of a dusky  colour, marked with a stripe of white.    The frog in the hoof is soft, partially covered with hair, and  transversely ribbed. The following sketch represents the under surface  of the foot of the Musk-ox, the external hoof being rounded, the  internal pointed.    [Illustration]    The foot-marks of the Musk-ox and those of the rein-deer are so much  alike, that it requires the eye of an experienced hunter to distinguish  them. The mark of the Musk-ox's hoof, however, is a little narrower.    The food of the Musk-ox is the same with that of the rein-deer--lichens  and grass; and sometimes twigs and shoots of willow, birch, and pine.    At present this animal is not found in a lower latitude than 66 deg.; but  formerly they came much further to the south; and their flesh used to be  brought by the natives to Fort Churchill in latitude 58 deg.. It would  appear that they are retiring northward, probably owing to the alarm  created by the attacks made upon them by fire-arms. It is worthy of  remark, that the American Bison has also retreated considerably to the  north. According to Dr. Richardson, the Musk-ox inhabits the North  Georgian Islands in the summer months. They arrive in Melville Island in  the middle of May, crossing the ice from the southward, and quit it on  their return towards the end of September.    The Musk-oxen, like the Bison, herd together in bands, and generally  frequent barren grounds during the summer months, keeping near the  rivers; but retire to the woods in winter. They seem to be less watchful  than most other wild animals; and when feeding are not difficult of  approach, provided the hunters go against the wind. When two or three  men get so near a herd as to fire at them from different points, these  animals, instead of separating or running away, huddle closer together,  and in this case they are easily shot down; but if the wound is not  mortal, they become enraged, and dart in the most furious manner at the  hunters, who must be very dexterous to evade them; for, notwithstanding  the shortness of their legs, they can run with great rapidity, and climb  hills and rocks, with great ease. They can defend themselves by their  powerful horns against wolves and bears, which, as the Indians say, they  not unfrequently kill.--(Capt. Franklin's 'Journey to the Polar Sea.')    They are hunted in their winter retreats by the Esquimaux only, the  Indian tribes never visiting the barren grounds at that season.    When the Musk-ox is fat, its flesh is well tasted, and it is then  preferred by the Copper Indians to the rein-deer. The flesh of bulls is  high-flavoured; but both bulls and cows smell strongly of musk, their  flesh at the same time being very dark and tough. The contents of the  paunch, and other intestinal parts, are relished as much by the Indian  as the similar parts of the rein-deer.--(Appendix to Capt. Parry's  'Second Voyage.')    The weight of the bulls killed during Capt. Parry's Second Voyage was,  on an average about 700 lbs., yielding about 400 lbs. of meat. Their  height, at the withers, was about ten hands and a half.    They were observed by Capt. Franklin's party to rut in the end of  August and beginning of September; and Hearne says, that they bring  forth one calf in the latter end of May, or beginning of June; thus the  period of gestation is about nine months.    The figure at the beginning of this article, as well as the following  cut of the head, are from the beautiful specimen of the Musk Ox, in the  British Museum.
