[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42243"],[0,"The Hour of the Dragon (#17)"],[1," Nemedian soldiers who stood on  guard were half drunk, and much too busy watching for handsome peasant  girls and rich merchants who could be bullied to notice workmen or dusty  travelers, even one tall wayfarer whose worn cloak could not conceal the  hard lines of his powerful frame.    This man carried himself with an erect, aggressive bearing that was too  natural for him to realize it himself, much less dissemble it. A great  patch covered one eye, and his leather coif, drawn low over his brows,  shadowed his features. With a long thick staff in his muscular brown  hand, he strode leisurely through the arch where the torches flared and  guttered, and, ignored by the tipsy guardsmen, emerged upon the wide  streets of Tarantia.    Upon these well-lighted thoroughfares the usual throngs went about their  business, and shops and stalls stood open, with their wares displayed.  One thread ran a constant theme through the pattern. Nemedian soldiers,  singly or in clumps, swaggered through the throngs, shouldering their  way with studied arrogance. Women scurried from their path, and men  stepped aside with darkened brows and clenched fists. The Aquilonians  were a proud race, and these were their hereditary enemies.    The knuckles of the tall traveler knotted on his staff, but, like the  others, he stepped aside to let the men in armor have the way. Among the  motley and varied crowd he did not attract much attention in his drab,  dusty garments. But once, as he passed a sword-seller's stall and the  light that streamed from its wide door fell full upon him, he thought  he felt an intense stare upon him, and turning quickly, saw a man in the  brown jerkin of a free workman regarding him fixedly. This man turned  away with undue haste, and vanished in the shifting throng. But Conan  turned into a narrow by-street and quickened his pace. It might have  been mere idle curiosity; but he could take no chances.    The grim Iron Tower stood apart from the citadel, amid a maze of narrow  streets and crowding houses where the meaner structures, appropriating a  space from which the more fastidious shrank, had invaded a portion of  the city ordinarily alien to them. The Tower was in reality a castle, an  ancient, formidable pile of heavy stone and black iron, which had itself  served as the citadel in an earlier, ruder century.    Not a long distance from it, lost in a tangle of partly deserted  tenements and warehouses, stood an ancient watchtower, so old and  forgotten that it did not appear on the maps of the city for a hundred  years back. Its original purpose had been forgotten, and nobody, of such  as saw it at all, noticed that the apparently ancient lock which kept it  from being appropriated as sleeping-quarters by beggars and thieves, was  in reality comparatively new and extremely powerful, cunningly disguised  into an appearance of rusty antiquity. Not half a dozen men in the  kingdom had ever known the secret of that tower.    No keyhole showed in the massive, green-crusted lock. But Conan's  practised fingers, stealing over it, pressed here and there knobs  invisible to the casual eye. The door silently opened inward and he  entered solid blackness, pushing the door shut behind him. A light would  have showed the tower empty, a bare, cylindrical shaft of massive stone.    Groping in a corner with the sureness of familiarity, he found the  projections for which he was feeling on a slab of the stone that  composed the floor. Quickly he lifted it, and without hesitation lowered  himself into the aperture beneath. His feet felt stone steps leading  downward into what he knew was a narrow tunnel that ran straight toward  the foundations of the Iron Tower, three streets away.    The bell on the citadel, which tolled only at the midnight hour or for  the death of a king, boomed suddenly. In a dimly lighted chamber in the  Iron Tower a door opened and a form emerged into a corridor. The  interior of the Tower was as forbidding as its external appearance. Its  massive stone walls were rough, unadorned. The flags of the floor were  worn deep by generations of faltering feet, and the vault of the ceiling  was gloomy in the dim light of torches set in niches.    The man who trudged down that grim corridor was in appearance in keeping  with his surroundings. He was a tall, powerfully built man, clad in  close-fitting black silk. Over his head was drawn a black hood which  fell about his shoulders, having two holes for his eyes. From his  shoulders hung a loose black cloak, and over one shoulder he bore a  heavy ax, the shape of which was that of neither tool nor weapon.    As he went down the corridor, a figure came hobbling up it, a bent,  surly old man, stooping under the weight of his pike and a lantern he  bore in one hand.    'You are not as prompt as your predecessor, master headsman,' he  grumbled. 'Midnight has just struck, and masked men have gone to  milady's cell. They await you.'    'The tones of the bell still echo among the towers,' answered the  executioner. 'If I am not so quick to leap and run at the beck of  Aquilonians as was the dog who held this office before me, they shall  find my arm no less ready. Get you to your duties, old watchman, and  leave me to mine. I think mine is the sweeter trade, by Mitra, for you  tramp cold corridors and peer at rusty dungeon doors, while I lop off  the fairest head in Tarantia this night.'    The watchman limped on down the corridor, still grumbling, and the  headsman resumed his leisurely way. A few strides carried him around a  turn in the corridor, and he absently noted that at his left a door  stood partly open. If he had thought, he would have known that that door  had been opened since the watchman passed; but thinking was not his  trade. He was passing the unlocked door before he realized that aught  was amiss, and then it was too late.    A soft tigerish step and the rustle of a cloak warned him, but before he  could turn, a heavy arm hooked about his throat from behind, crushing  the cry before it could reach his lips. In the brief instant that was  allowed him he realized with a surge of panic the strength of his  attacker, against which his own brawny thews were helpless. He sensed  without seeing the poised dagger.    'Nemedian dog!' muttered a voice thick with passion in his ear. 'You've  cut off your last Aquilonian head!'    And that was the last thing he ever heard.           *       *       *       *       *    In a dank dungeon, lighted only by a guttering torch, three men stood  about a young woman who knelt on the rush-strewn flags staring wildly up  at them. She was clad only in a scanty shift; her golden hair fell in  lustrous ripples about her white shoulders, and her wrists were bound  behind her. Even in the uncertain torchlight, and in spite of her  disheveled condition and pallor of fear, her beauty was striking. She  knelt mutely, staring with wide eyes up at her tormenters. The men were  closely masked and cloaked. Such a deed as this needed masks, even in a  conquered land. She knew them all nevertheless; but what she knew would  harm no one--after that night.    'Our merciful sovereign offers you one more chance, Countess,' said the  tallest of the three, and he spoke Aquilonian without an accent. 'He  bids me say that if you soften your proud, rebellious spirit, he will  still open his arms to you. If not--' he gestured toward a grim wooden  block in the center of the cell. It was blackly stained, and showed many  deep nicks as if a keen edge, cutting through some yielding substance,  had sunk into the wood.    Albiona shuddered and turned pale, shrinking back. Every fiber in her  vigorous young body quivered with the urge of life. Valerius was young,  too, and handsome. Many women loved him, she told herself, fighting with  herself for life. But she could not speak the word that would ransom her  soft young body from the block and the dripping ax. She could not reason  the matter. She only knew that when she thought of the clasp of  Valerius' arms, her flesh crawled with an abhorrence greater than the  fear of death. She shook her head helplessly, compelled by an impulsion  more irresistible than the instinct to live.    'Then there is no more to be said!' exclaimed one of the others  impatiently, and he spoke with a Nemedian accent. 'Where is the  headsman?'    As if summoned by the word, the dungeon door opened silently, and a  great figure stood framed in it, like a black shadow from the  underworld.    Albiona voiced a low, involuntary cry at the sight of that grim shape,  and the others stared silently for a moment, perhaps themselves daunted  with superstitious awe at the silent, hooded figure. Through the coif  the eyes blazed like coals of blue fire, and as these eyes rested on  each man in turn, he felt a curious chill travel down his spine.    Then the tall Aquilonian roughly seized the girl and dragged her to the  block. She screamed uncontrollably and fought hopelessly against him,  frantic with terror, but he ruthlessly forced her to her knees, and bent  her yellow head down to the bloody block.    'Why do you delay, headsman?' he exclaimed angrily. 'Perform your task!'    He was answered by a short, gusty boom of laughter that was  indescribably menacing. All in the dungeon froze in their places,  staring at the hooded shape--the two cloaked figures, the masked man  bending over the girl, the girl herself on her knees, twisting her  imprisoned head to look upward.    'What means this unseemly mirth, dog?' demanded the Aquilonian uneasily.    The man in the black garb tore his hood from his head and flung it to  the ground; he set his back to the closed door and lifted the headsman's  ax.    'Do you know me, dogs?' he rumbled. 'Do you know me?'    The breathless silence was broken by a scream.    'The king!' shrieked Albiona, wrenching herself free from the slackened  grasp of her captor. 'Oh, Mitra, the king!'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4227"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Wireless Message; Or, The Castaways of Earthquake Island (#17)"],[1,"UTE. Fortunate it was that Mr. Fenwick had  brought along such a supply of food, for there were now many mouths  to feed.    That the supper (which the meal really was, for it was getting late)  was much enjoyed, goes without saying. The yacht castaways had  subsisted on what little food had been hurriedly put into the life  boat, as they left the vessel.    At Tom's request, while it was yet light, Captain Mentor and some of  the men hunted for a spring of fresh water, and found one, for, with  the increase in the party, the young inventor saw the necessity for  more water. The spring gave promise of supplying a sufficient  quantity.    There was plenty of material at hand for making other shacks, and  they were soon in course of construction. They were made light, as  was the one Tom and his friends first built, so that, in case of  another shock, no one would be hurt seriously. The two ladies were  given the larger shack, and the men divided themselves between two  others that were hastily erected on the beach. The remainder of the  food and stores was taken from the wreck of the airship, and when  darkness began to fall, the camp was snug and comfortable, a big  fire of driftwood burning brightly.    \"Oh, if only we can sleep without being awakened by an earthquake!\"  exclaimed Mrs. Nestor, as she prepared to go into the shack with  Mrs. Anderson. \"But I am almost afraid to close my eyes!\"    \"If it would do any good to stay up and watch, to tell you when one  was coming, I'd do so,\" spoke Tom, with a laugh, \"but they come  without warning.\"    However, the night did pass peacefully, and there was not the least  tremor of the island. In the morning the castaways took courage and,  after breakfast, began discussing their situation more calmly.    \"It seems to me that the only solution is to build some sort of a  raft, or other craft and leave the island,\" said Mr. Fenwick.    \"Bless my hair brush!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Why can't we hoist a signal  of distress, and wait for some steamer to see it and call for us? It  seems to me that would be more simple than going to sea on a raft. I  don't like the idea.\"    \"A signal would be all right, if this island was in the path of the  steamers,\" said Captain Mentor. \"But it isn't. Our flag might fly  for a year, and never be seen.\"    His words seemed to strike coldness to every heart. Tom, who was  looking at the wreck of the airship, suddenly uttered an  exclamation. He sprang to his feet.    \"What is it?\" demanded Mr. Fenwick. \"Does your sore leg hurt you?\"    \"No, but I have just thought of a plan!\" fairly shouted the young  inventor. \"I have it! Wait and see if I can work it!\"    \"Work what?\" cried Mr. Damon.    Tom did not get a chance to answer, for, at that moment, there  sounded, at the far end of the island, whence the yacht castaways  had come, a terrific crash. It was accompanied, rather than  followed, by a shaking, trembling and swaying of the ground.    \"Another earthquake!\" screamed Mrs. Nestor, rushing toward her  husband. The castaways gazed at each other affrighted.    Suddenly, before their eyes, they saw the extreme end of that part  of the island on which they were camping, slip off, and beneath the  foaming waves of the sea, while the echoes of the mighty crash came  to their ears!          CHAPTER XVIII    MR. JENKS HAS DIAMONDS      Stunned, and well-nigh paralyzed by the suddenness of the awful  crash, and the recurrence of the earthquake, the castaways gazed  spell-bound at one another.    Succeeding the disappearance of the end of the island there arose a  great wave in the ocean, caused by the immersion of such a quantity  of rock and dirt.    \"Look out!\" yelled Tom, \"there may be a flood here!\"    They realized his meaning, and hastened up the beach, out of reach  of the water if it should come. And it did. At first the ocean  retreated, as though the tide was going out, then, with a rush and  roar, the waves came leaping back, and, had the castaways remained  where they had been standing they would have been swept out to sea.    As it was the flood reached part of the wreck of the airship, that  lay on the beach, and washed away some of the broken planks. But,  after the first rush of water, the sea grew less troubled, and there  was no more danger from that source.    True, the whole island was rumbling and trembling in the throes of  an earthquake, but, by this time, the refugees had become somewhat  used to this, and only the two ladies exhibited any outward signs of  great alarm, though Mr. Barcoe Jenks, Tom observed, was nervously  fingering the belt which he wore about his waist.    \"I guess the worst is over,\" spoke Mr. Fenwick, as they stood  looking toward where part of the island had vanished. \"The shock  expended itself on tearing that mass of rock and earth away.\"    \"Let us hope so,\" added Mr. Hosbrook, solemnly. \"Oh, if we could  only get away from this terrible place! We must hoist a signal of  distress, even if we are out of the track of regular vessels. Some  ship, blown out of her course may see it. Captain Mentor, I wish you  and Mr. Fordam would attend to that.\"    \"I will, sir,\" answered the commander of the ill-fated RESOLUTE.  \"The signal shall be hoisted at once. Come on, Mr. Fordam,\" he  added, turning to the first mate.    \"If you don't mind,\" interrupted Tom, \"I wish you would first help  me to get what remains of the airship up out of reach of any more  possible high waves. That one nearly covered it, and if there are  other big rollers, the wreck may be washed out to sea.\"    \"I can't see that any great harm would result from that,\" put in Mr.  Jenks. \"There isn't anything about the wreck that we could use to  make a boat or raft from.\" Indeed, there was little left of the  airship, save the mass of machinery.    \"Well, it may come in handy before we leave here,\" said Tom, and  there was a quiet determined air about him, that caused Mr. Damon to  look at him curiously. The odd gentleman started to utter one of his  numerous blessings, and to ask Tom a question, but he thought better  of it. By this time the earthquake had ceased, and the castaways  were calmer.    Tom started toward the airship wreck, and began pulling off some  broken boards to get at the electrical machinery.    \"I guess you had better give Mr. Swift a hand, Captain Mentor,\"  spoke the millionaire yacht owner. \"I don't know what good the wreck  can be, but we owe considerable to Mr. Swift and his friends, and  the least we can do is to aid them in anything they ask. So,  Captain, if you don't mind, you and the mate bear a hand. In fact,  we'll all help, and move the wreck so far up that there will be no  danger, even from tidal waves.\"    Tom looked pleased at this order, and soon he and all the men in the  little party were busy taking out the electrical apparatus, and  moving it farther inland.    \"What are you going to do with it, Tom?\" asked Mr. Damon, in a low  voice, as he assisted the young inventor to carry a small dynamo,  that was used for operating the incandescent lights.    \"I hardly know myself. I have a half-formed plan in my mind. I may  be able to carry it out, and I may not. I don't want to say anything  until I look over the machinery, and see if all the parts which I  need are here. Please say nothing about it.\"    \"Bless my toothpick! Of course, I'll not,\" promised Mr. Damon.    When the removal of most of the machinery of the wrecked airship had  been completed, Mrs. Nestor exclaimed:    \"Well, since you are moving that out of harm's way, don't you think  it would be a good idea to change our camp, also? I'm sure I'll  never sleep a wink, thinking that part of the island may fall into  the ocean at any moment in the night, and create a wave that may  wash us all out to sea. Can't we move the camp, Mr. Swift?\"    \"No reason why we can't,\" answered the lad, smiling. \"I think it  would be a good plan to take it farther back. We are likely to be  here some time, and, while we are about it, we might build more  complete shelters, and have a few more comforts.\"    The others agreed with this idea, so the little shacks that had been  erected were taken down, and moved to higher ground, where a better  outlook could be had of the surrounding ocean. At the same time as  safe a place as possible, considering the frequent earthquakes, was  picked out--a place where there were no overhanging rocks or cliffs.    Three huts were built, one for the two ladies, one for the men, and  third where the cooking could be done. This last also held the food  supplies and stores, and Tom noted, with satisfaction, that there  was still sufficient to eat to last over a week. Mr. Fenwick had not  stinted his kitchen stores.    This work done, Captain Mentor and Mate Fordam went to the highest  part of the island, where they erected a signal, made from pieces of  canvas that had been in the life boat. The boat itself was brought  around to the new camp, and at first it was hoped that it could be  repaired, and used. But too large a hole had been stove in the  bottom, so it was broken up, and the planks used in making the  shacks.    This work occupied the better part of two days, and during this  time, there were no more earthquakes. The castaways began to hope  that the island would not be quiet for a while. Mrs. Anderson and  Mrs. Nestor assumed charge of the \"housekeeping\" arrangements, and  also the cooking, which relieved Tom from those duties. The two  ladies even instituted \"wash-day,\" and when a number of garments  were hung on lines to dry, the camp looked like some summer colony  of pleasure-seekers, out for a holiday.    In the meanwhile, Tom had spent most of his time among the machinery  which had been taken from the airship. He inspected it carefully,  tested some of the apparatus, and made some calculations on a bit of  paper. He seemed greatly pleased over something, and one afternoon,  when he was removing some of the guy and"]]]
