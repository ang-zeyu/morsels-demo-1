Under the supervision of the engineers, roadways had been opened  over chasms to the right where the walls were so steep that men could  barely climb them.  Animals could not.  These had been opened under  cover of night, without attracting the notice of the enemy.  The  engineers, who had directed the opening, led the way and the troops  followed. Artillery was let down the steep slopes by hand, the men  engaged attaching a strong rope to the rear axle and letting the guns  down, a piece at a time, while the men at the ropes kept their ground on  top, paying out gradually, while a few at the front directed the course  of the piece.  In like manner the guns were drawn by hand up the  opposite slopes.  In this way Scott's troops reached their assigned  position in rear of most of the intrenchments of the enemy, unobserved.  The attack was made, the Mexican reserves behind the works beat a hasty  retreat, and those occupying them surrendered.  On the left General  Pillow's command made a formidable demonstration, which doubtless held a  part of the enemy in his front and contributed to the victory. I am not  pretending to give full details of all the battles fought, but of the  portion that I saw.  There were troops engaged on both sides at other  points in which both sustained losses; but the battle was won as here  narrated.    The surprise of the enemy was complete, the victory overwhelming; some  three thousand prisoners fell into Scott's hands, also a large amount of  ordnance and ordnance stores.  The prisoners were paroled, the artillery  parked and the small arms and ammunition destroyed.  The battle of Buena  Vista was probably very important to the success of General Scott at  Cerro Gordo and in his entire campaign from Vera Cruz to the great  plains reaching to the City of Mexico.  The only army Santa Anna had to  protect his capital and the mountain passes west of Vera Cruz, was the  one he had with him confronting General Taylor. It is not likely that he  would have gone as far north as Monterey to attack the United States  troops when he knew his country was threatened with invasion further  south.  When Taylor moved to Saltillo and then advanced on to Buena  Vista, Santa Anna crossed the desert confronting the invading army,  hoping no doubt to crush it and get back in time to meet General Scott  in the mountain passes west of Vera Cruz.  His attack on Taylor was  disastrous to the Mexican army, but, notwithstanding this, he marched  his army to Cerro Gordo, a distance not much short of one thousand miles  by the line he had to travel, in time to intrench himself well before  Scott got there.  If he had been successful at Buena Vista his troops  would no doubt have made a more stubborn resistance at Cerro Gordo.  Had  the battle of Buena Vista not been fought Santa Anna would have had time  to move leisurely to meet the invader further south and with an army not  demoralized nor depleted by defeat.    After the battle the victorious army moved on to Jalapa, where it was in  a beautiful, productive and healthy country, far above the fevers of the  coast.  Jalapa, however, is still in the mountains, and between there  and the great plain the whole line of the road is easy of defence.  It  was important, therefore, to get possession of the great highway between  the sea-coast and the capital up to the point where it leaves the  mountains, before the enemy could have time to re-organize and fortify  in our front. Worth's division was selected to go forward to secure this  result.  The division marched to Perote on the great plain, not far from  where the road debouches from the mountains.  There is a low, strong  fort on the plain in front of the town, known as the Castle of Perote.  This, however, offered no resistance and fell into our hands, with its  armament.    General Scott having now only nine or ten thousand men west of Vera  Cruz, and the time of some four thousand of them being about to expire,  a long delay was the consequence.  The troops were in a healthy climate,  and where they could subsist for an indefinite period even if their line  back to Vera Cruz should be cut off.  It being ascertained that the men  whose time would expire before the City of Mexico could possibly fall  into the hands of the American army, would not remain beyond the term  for which they had volunteered, the commanding-general determined to  discharge them at once, for a delay until the expiration of their time  would have compelled them to pass through Vera Cruz during the season of  the vomito.  This reduced Scott's force in the field to about five  thousand men.    Early in May, Worth, with his division, left Perote and marched on to  Puebla.  The roads were wide and the country open except through one  pass in a spur of mountains coming up from the south, through which the  road runs.  Notwithstanding this the small column was divided into two  bodies, moving a day apart. Nothing occurred on the march of special  note, except that while lying at the town of Amozoque--an easy day's  march east of Puebla--a body of the enemy's cavalry, two or three  thousand strong, was seen to our right, not more than a mile away.  A  battery or two, with two or three infantry regiments, was sent against  them and they soon disappeared.  On the 15th of May we entered the city  of Puebla.    General Worth was in command at Puebla until the latter end of May, when  General Scott arrived.  Here, as well as on the march up, his  restlessness, particularly under responsibilities, showed itself.  During his brief command he had the enemy hovering around near the city,  in vastly superior numbers to his own.  The brigade to which I was  attached changed quarters three different times in about a week,  occupying at first quarters near the plaza, in the heart of the city;  then at the western entrance; then at the extreme east.  On one occasion  General Worth had the troops in line, under arms, all day, with three  days' cooked rations in their haversacks.  He galloped from one command  to another proclaiming the near proximity of Santa Anna with an army  vastly superior to his own.  General Scott arrived upon the scene the  latter part of the month, and nothing more was heard of Santa Anna and  his myriads.  There were, of course, bodies of mounted Mexicans hovering  around to watch our movements and to pick up stragglers, or small bodies  of troops, if they ventured too far out.  These always withdrew on the  approach of any considerable number of our soldiers.  After the arrival  of General Scott I was sent, as quartermaster, with a large train of  wagons, back two days' march at least, to procure forage.  We had less  than a thousand men as escort, and never thought of danger.  We procured  full loads for our entire train at two plantations, which could easily  have furnished as much more.    There had been great delay in obtaining the authority of Congress for  the raising of the troops asked for by the administration.  A bill was  before the National Legislature from early in the session of 1846-7,  authorizing the creation of ten additional regiments for the war to be  attached to the regular army, but it was the middle of February before  it became a law.  Appointments of commissioned officers had then to be  made; men had to be enlisted, the regiments equipped and the whole  transported to Mexico.  It was August before General Scott received  reinforcement sufficient to warrant an advance.  His moving column, not  even now more than ten thousand strong, was in four divisions, commanded  by Generals Twiggs, Worth, Pillow and Quitman.  There was also a cavalry  corps under General Harney, composed of detachments of the 1st, 2d, and  3d dragoons.  The advance commenced on the 7th of August with Twiggs's  division in front.  The remaining three divisions followed, with an  interval of a day between.  The marches were short, to make  concentration easier in case of attack.    I had now been in battle with the two leading commanders conducting  armies in a foreign land.  The contrast between the two was very marked.  General Taylor never wore uniform, but dressed himself entirely for  comfort.  He moved about the field in which he was operating to see  through his own eyes the situation.  Often he would be without staff  officers, and when he was accompanied by them there was no prescribed  order in which they followed.  He was very much given to sit his horse  side-ways--with both feet on one side--particularly on the battlefield.  General Scott was the reverse in all these particulars.  He always wore  all the uniform prescribed or allowed by law when he inspected his  lines; word would be sent to all division and brigade commanders in  advance, notifying them of the hour when the commanding general might be  expected.  This was done so that all the army might be under arms to  salute their chief as he passed.  On these occasions he wore his dress  uniform, cocked hat, aiguillettes, sabre and spurs.  His staff proper,  besides all officers constructively on his staff--engineers, inspectors,  quartermasters, etc., that could be spared--followed, also in uniform  and in prescribed order.  Orders were prepared with great care and  evidently with the view that they should be a history of what followed.    In their modes of expressing thought, these two generals contrasted  quite as strongly as in their other characteristics.  General Scott was  precise in language, cultivated a style peculiarly his own; was proud of  his rhetoric; not averse to speaking of himself, often in the third  person, and he could bestow praise upon the person he was talking about  without the least embarrassment.  Taylor was not a conversationalist,  but on paper he could put his meaning so plainly that there could be no  mistaking it.  He knew how to express what he wanted to say in the  fewest well-chosen words, but would not sacrifice meaning to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4376"],[0,"Sowing Seeds in Danny (#17)"],[1,"feather in her bonnet, and they're a terrible costly  thing, I hear. Mind you they only keep six cows, and they send every  drop they don't use to the creamery. Everybody can do as they like, I  suppose, but I know they'll go to the wall, and they deserve it too!\"    And yet!    She and Mrs. Slater had been girls together and sat in school with arms  entwined and wove romances of the future, rosy-hued and golden. When  they consulted the oracle of \"Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor, rich  man, poor man, beggar man, thief,\" the buttons on her gray winsey dress  had declared in favour of the \"rich man.\" Then she had dreamed dreams  of silks and satins and prancing steeds and liveried servants, and  ease, and happiness--dreams which God in His mercy had let her forget  long, long ago.    When she had become the mistress of the big stone house, she had  struggled hard against her husband's penuriousness, defiantly  sometimes, and sometimes tearfully. But he had held her down with a  heavy hand of unyielding determination. At last she grew weary of  struggling, and settled down in sullen submission, a hopeless  heavy-eyed, spiritless women, and as time went by she became greedier  for money than her husband.    \"Good-morning,\" Pearl said brightly. \"Are you Mr. Tom Motherwell?\"    \"That's what!\" Tom replied. \"Only you needn't mind the handle.\"    Pearl laughed.    \"All right,\" she said, \"I want a little favor done. Will you open the  window upstairs for me?\"    \"Why?\" Tom asked, staring at her.    \"To let in good air. It's awful close up there, and I'm afraid I'll get  the fever or somethin' bad.\"    \"Polly got it,\" Tom said. \"Maybe that is why Polly got it. She's awful  sick now. Ma says she'll like as not die. But I don't believe ma will  let me open it.\"    \"Where is Polly?\" Pearl asked eagerly. She had forgotten her own  worries. \"Who is Polly? Did she live here?\"    \"She's in the hospital now in Brandon,\" Tom said in answer to her rapid  questions. \"She planted them poppies out there, but she never seen the  flowers on them. Ma wanted me to cut them down, for Polly used to put  off so much time with them, but I didn't want to. Ma was mad, too, you  bet,\" he said, with a reminiscent smile at his own foolhardiness.    Pearl was thinking--she could see the poppies through the window,  bright and glowing in the morning light. They rocked lightly in the  wind, and a shower of crimson petals fell. Poor Polly! she hadn't seen  them.    \"What's Polly's other name?\" she asked quickly.    \"Polly Bragg,\" he answered. \"She was awful nice, Polly was, and jolly,  too. Ma thought she was lazy. She used to cry a lot and wish she could  go home; but my! she could sing fine.\"    Pearl went on with her work with a preoccupied air.    \"Tom, can you take a parcel for me to town to-day?\"    \"I am not goin',\" he said in surprise. \"Pa always goes if we need  anything. I haven't been in town for a month.\"    \"Don't you go to church?\" Pearl asked in surprise.    \"No, you bet I don't, not now. The preacher was sassy to pa and tried  to get money. Pa says he'll never touch wood in his church again, and  pa won't give another cent either, and, mind you, last year we gave  twenty-five dollars.\"    \"We paid fourteen dollars,\" Pearl said, \"and Mary got six dollars on  her card.\"    \"Oh, but you town people don't have the expenses we have.\"    \"That's true, I guess,\" Pearl said doubtfully--she was wondering about  the boot bills. \"Pa gets a dollar and a quarter every day, and ma gets  seventy-five cents when she washes. We're gettin' on fine.\"    Then Mrs. Motherwell made her appearance, and the conversation came to  an end.    That afternoon when Pearl had washed the dishes and scrubbed the floor,  she went upstairs to the little room to write in her diary. She knew  Mrs. Francis would expect to see something in it, so she wrote  laboriously:       I saw a lot of yalla flowers and black-burds. The rode     was full of dust and wagging marks. I met a man with     a top buggy and smelt a skunk. Mrs. M. made a kake     to-day--there was no lickens.       I'm goin' to tidy up the granary for Arthur. He's     offel nice--an' told me about London Bridge--it hasn't     fallen down at all, he says, that's just a song.    All day long the air had been heavy and close, and that night while  Pearl was asleep the face of the heavens was darkened with  storm-clouds. Great rolling masses came up from the west, shot through  with flashes of lightening, and the heavy silence was more ominous than  the loudest thunder would have been. The wind began in the hills, gusty  and fitful at first, then bursting with violence over the plain below.  There was a cutting whine in it, like the whang of stretched steel,  fateful, deadly as the singing of bullets, chilling the farmer's heart,  for he knows it means hail.    Pearl woke and sat up in bed. The lightning flashed in the little  window, leaving the room as black as ink. She listened to the whistling  wind.    \"It's the hail,\" she whispered delightedly. \"I knew the Lord would find  a way to open the windy without me puttin' my fist through it--I'll  have a look at the clouds to see if they have that white edge on them.  No--I won't either--it isn't my put in. I'll just lave the Lord alone.  Nothin' makes me madder than when I promise Tommy or Mary or any of  them something and then have them frettin' all the time about whether  or not I'll get it done. I'd like to see the clouds though. I'll bet  they're a sight, just like what Camilla sings about:       Dark is His path on the wings o' the storm.    In the kitchen below the Motherwells gathered with pale faces. The  windows shook and rattled in their casings.    \"Keep away from the stove, Tom,\" Mrs. Motherwell said, trembling.  \"That's where the lightnin' strikes.\"    Tom's teeth were chattering.    \"This'll fix the wheat that's standing, every--bit of it,\" Sam said. He  did not make it quite as strong as he intended. Something had taken the  profanity out of him.    \"Hadn't you better go up and bring the kid down, ma?\" Tom asked,  thinking of Pearl.    \"Her!\" his father said contemptuously. \"She'll never hear it.\" The wind  suddenly ceased. Not a breath stirred, only a continuous glare of  lightning. Then crack! crack! crack! on the roof, on the windows,  everywhere, like bad boys throwing stones, heavier, harder, faster,  until it was one beating, thundering roar.    It lasted but a few minutes, though it seemed longer to those who  listened in terror in the kitchen.    The roar grew less and less and at last ceased altogether, and only a  gentle rain was falling.    Sam Motherwell sat without speaking, \"You have cheated the Lord all  these years, and He has borne with you, trying to make you pay up  without harsh proceedings\"--he found himself repeating the minister's  words. Could this be what he meant by harsh proceedings? Certainly it  was harsh enough taking away a man's crop after all his hard work.    Sam was full of self-pity. There were very few men who had ever been  treated as badly as he felt himself to be.    \"Maybe there'll only be a streak of it hailed out,\" Tom said, breaking  in on his father's dismal thoughts.    \"You'll see in the mornin',\" his father growled, and Tom went back to  bed.    When Pearl woke it was with the wind blowing in upon her; the morning  breeze fragrant with the sweetness of the flowers and the ripening  grain. The musty odours had all gone, and she felt life and health in  every breath. The blackbirds were twittering in the oats behind the  house, and the rising sun was throwing long shadows over the field.  Scattered glass lay on the floor.    \"I knew the dear Lord would fix the gurms,\" Pearl said as she dressed,  laughing to herself. But her face clouded in a moment. What about the  poppies?    Then she laughed again. \"There I go frettin' again. I guess the Lord  knows they're, there and He isn't going to smash them if Polly really  needs them.\"    She dressed herself hastily and ran down the ladder and around behind  the cookhouse, where a strange sight met her eyes. The cookhouse roof  had been blown off and placed over the poppies, where it had sheltered  them from every hailstone.    Pearl looked under the roof. The poppies stood there straight and  beautiful, no doubt wondering what big thing it was that hid them from  the sun.    When Tom and his father went out in the early dawn to investigate the  damage done by the storm, they found that only a narrow strip through  the field in front of the house had been touched.    The hail had played a strange trick; beating down the grain along this  narrow path, just as if a mighty roller had come through it, until it  reached the house, on the other side of which not one trace of damage  could be found.    \"Didn't we get off lucky?\" Tom exclaimed \"and the rest of the grain is  not even lodged. Why, twenty-five dollars would cover the whole loss,  cookhouse roof and all.\"    His father was looking over the rippling field, green-gold in the rosy  dawn. He started uncomfortably at Tom's words.    Twenty-five dollars!        CHAPTER XV    INASMUCH    After sundown one night Pearl's resolve was carried into action. She  picked a shoe-box full of poppies, wrapping the stems carefully in wet  newspaper. She put the cover on, and wrapped the box neatly.    Then she wrote the address. She wrote it painfully, laboriously, in  round blocky letters. Pearl always put her tongue out when she was  doing anything that required minute attention. She was so anxious to  have the address just right that her tongue was almost around to her  ear. The address read:       Miss Polly Bragg, english gurl     and sick with fever     Brandon Hospittle     Brandon.    Then she drew a design around it. Jimmy's teacher had made them once in  Jimmy's scribbler, just beautiful. She was sorry she could not do a  bird with a long strip of tape in his mouth with \"Think of Me\" or \"From  a Friend\""]]]
