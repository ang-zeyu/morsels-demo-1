Now that hope which depends not on men's own power, but on others' ill  success, is a very ticklish thing; for there is no certainty among men,  either in their bad or good fortunes; but we may easily observe that  fortune is mutable, and goes from one side to another; and this you may  readily learn from examples among yourselves; for when you were once  victors in the former fight, your enemies overcame you at last; and very  likely it will now happen so, that these who think themselves sure of  beating you will themselves be beaten. For when men are very confident,  they are not upon their guard, while fear teaches men to act with  caution; insomuch that I venture to prove from your very timorousness  that you ought to take courage; for when you were more bold than you  ought to have been, and than I would have had you, and marched on,  Athenio's treachery took place; but your present slowness and seeming  dejection of mind is to me a pledge and assurance of victory. And  indeed it is proper beforehand to be thus provident; but when we come  to action, we ought to erect our minds, and to make our enemies, be they  ever so wicked, believe that neither any human, no, nor any providential  misfortune, can ever depress the courage of Jews while they are alive;  nor will any of them ever overlook an Arabian, or suffer such a one to  become lord of his good things, whom he has in a manner taken captive,  and that many times also. And do not you disturb yourselves at the  quaking of inanimate creatures, nor do you imagine that this earthquake  is a sign of another calamity; for such affections of the elements are  according to the course of nature, nor does it import any thing further  to men, than what mischief it does immediately of itself. Perhaps there  may come some short sign beforehand in the case of pestilences, and  famines, and earthquakes; but these calamities themselves have their  force limited by themselves [without foreboding any other calamity]. And  indeed what greater mischief can the war, though it should be a violent  one, do to us than the earthquake hath done? Nay, there is a signal of  our enemies' destruction visible, and that a very great one also; and  this is not a natural one, nor derived from the hand of foreigners  neither, but it is this, that they have barbarously murdered our  ambassadors, contrary to the common law of mankind; and they have  destroyed so many, as if they esteemed them sacrifices for God, in  relation to this war. But they will not avoid his great eye, nor his  invincible right hand; and we shall be revenged of them presently, in  case we still retain any of the courage of our forefathers, and rise up  boldly to punish these covenant-breakers. Let every one therefore go on  and fight, not so much for his wife or his children, or for the  danger his country is in, as for these ambassadors of ours; those dead  ambassadors will conduct this war of ours better than we ourselves who  are alive. And if you will be ruled by me, I will myself go before  you into danger; for you know this well enough, that your courage is  irresistible, unless you hurt yourselves by acting rashly.\" 30    5. When Herod had encouraged them by this speech, and he saw with  what alacrity they went, he offered sacrifice to God; and after that  sacrifice, he passed over the river Jordan with his army, and pitched  his camp about Philadelphia, near the enemy, and about a fortification  that lay between them. He then shot at them at a distance, and was  desirous to come to an engagement presently; for some of them had been  sent beforehand to seize upon that fortification: but the king sent some  who immediately beat them out of the fortification, while he himself  went in the forefront of the army, which he put in battle-array every  day, and invited the Arabians to fight. But as none of them came out  of their camp, for they were in a terrible fright, and their general,  Elthemus, was not able to say a word for fear,--so Herod came upon  them, and pulled their fortification to pieces, by which means they were  compelled to come out to fight, which they did in disorder, and so that  the horsemen and foot-men were mixed together. They were indeed superior  to the Jews in number, but inferior in their alacrity, although they  were obliged to expose themselves to danger by their very despair of  victory.    6. Now while they made opposition, they had not a great number slain;  but as soon as they turned their backs, a great many were trodden to  pieces by the Jews, and a great many by themselves, and so perished,  till five thousand were fallen down dead in their flight, while the rest  of the multitude prevented their immediate death, by crowding into the  fortification. Herod encompassed these around, and besieged them; and  while they were ready to be taken by their enemies in arms, they had  another additional distress upon them, which was thirst and want of  water; for the king was above hearkening to their ambassadors; and when  they offered five hundred talents, as the price of their redemption,  he pressed still harder upon them. And as they were burnt up by their  thirst, they came out and voluntarily delivered themselves up by  multitudes to the Jews, till in five days' time four thousand of them  were put into bonds; and on the sixth day the multitude that were left  despaired of saving themselves, and came out to fight: with these Herod  fought, and slew again about seven thousand, insomuch that he punished  Arabia so severely, and so far extinguished the spirits of the men, that  he was chosen by the nation for their ruler.              CHAPTER 20.           Herod Is Confirmed In His Kingdom By Caesar, And Cultivates       A Friendship With The Emperor By Magnificent Presents; While       Caesar Returns His Kindness By Bestowing On Him That Part Of       His Kingdom Which Had Been Taken Away From It By Cleopatra       With The Addition Of Zenodoruss Country Also.    1. But now Herod was under immediate concern about a most important  affair, on account of his friendship with Antony, who was already  overcome at Actium by Caesar; yet he was more afraid than hurt; for  Caesar did not think he had quite undone Antony, while Herod continued  his assistance to him. However, the king resolved to expose himself to  dangers: accordingly he sailed to Rhodes, where Caesar then abode, and  came to him without his diadem, and in the habit and appearance of a  private person, but in his behavior as a king. So he concealed nothing  of the truth, but spoke thus before his face: \"O Caesar, as I was made  king of the Jews by Antony, so do I profess that I have used my royal  authority in the best manner, and entirely for his advantage; nor will I  conceal this further, that thou hadst certainly found me in arms, and an  inseparable companion of his, had not the Arabians hindered me. However,  I sent him as many auxiliaries as I was able, and many ten thousand  [cori] of corn. Nay, indeed, I did not desert my benefactor after the  bow that was given him at Actium; but I gave him the best advice I was  able, when I was no longer able to assist him in the war; and I told him  that there was but one way of recovering his affairs, and that was to  kill Cleopatra; and I promised him that, if she were once dead, I would  afford him money and walls for his security, with an army and myself  to assist him in his war against thee: but his affections for Cleopatra  stopped his ears, as did God himself also who hath bestowed the  government on thee. I own myself also to be overcome together with  him; and with his last fortune I have laid aside my diadem, and am come  hither to thee, having my hopes of safety in thy virtue; and I desire  that thou wilt first consider how faithful a friend, and not whose  friend, I have been.\"    2. Caesar replied to him thus: \"Nay, thou shalt not only be in safety,  but thou shalt be a king; and that more firmly than thou wast before;  for thou art worthy to reign over a great many subjects, by reason  of the fastness of thy friendship; and do thou endeavor to be equally  constant in thy friendship to me, upon my good success, which is what I  depend upon from the generosity of thy disposition. However, Antony hath  done well in preferring Cleopatra to thee; for by this means we have  gained thee by her madness, and thus thou hast begun to be my friend  before I began to be thine; on which account Quintus Didius hath written  to me that thou sentest him assistance against the gladiators. I do  therefore assure thee that I will confirm the kingdom to thee by decree:  I shall also endeavor to do thee some further kindness hereafter, that  thou mayst find no loss in the want of Antony.\"    3. When Caesar had spoken such obliging things to the king, and had put  the diadem again about his head, he proclaimed what he had bestowed on  him by a decree, in which he enlarged in the commendation of the man  after a magnificent manner. Whereupon Herod obliged him to be kind  to him by the presents he gave him, and he desired him to forgive  Alexander, one of Antony's friends, who was become a supplicant to him.  But Caesar's anger against him prevailed, and he complained of the many  and very great offenses the man whom he petitioned for had been guilty  of; and by that means he rejected his petition. After this Caesar went  for Egypt through Syria, when Herod received him with royal and rich  entertainments; and then did he first of all ride along with Caesar, as  he was reviewing his army about Ptolemais, and feasted him with all  his friends, and then distributed among the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2853"],[0,"Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero (#17)"],[1,"\"    But desire, astonishment, rage, and wine cut the legs from under him.  He staggered once and a second time, seized the naked arm of one of the  bacchanals, and began to inquire, with blinking eyes, what had happened.  She, taking a goblet of wine, gave it to him with a smile in her  mist-covered eyes.    \"Drink!\" said she.    Vinicius drank, and fell to the floor.    The greater number of the guests were lying under the table; others were  walking with tottering tread through the triclinium, while others were  sleeping on couches at the table, snoring, or giving forth the excess  of wine. Meanwhile, from the golden network, roses were dropping  and dropping on those drunken consuls and senators, on those drunken  knights, philosophers, and poets, on those drunken dancing damsels and  patrician ladies, on that society all dominant as yet but with the soul  gone from it, on that society garlanded and ungirdled but perishing.    Dawn had begun out of doors.          Chapter VIII      No one stopped Ursus, no one inquired even what he was doing. Those  guests who were not under the table had not kept their own places; hence  the servants, seeing a giant carrying a guest on his arm, thought him  some slave bearing out his intoxicated mistress. Moreover, Acte was with  them, and her presence removed all suspicion.    In this way they went from the triclinium to the adjoining chamber, and  thence to the gallery leading to Acte's apartments. To such a degree  had her strength deserted Lygia, that she hung as if dead on the arm of  Ursus. But when the cool, pure breeze of morning beat around her, she  opened her eyes. It was growing clearer and clearer in the open air.  After they had passed along the colonnade awhile, they turned to a side  portico, coming out, not in the courtyard, but the palace gardens, where  the tops of the pines and cypresses were growing ruddy from the light  of morning. That part of the building was empty, so that echoes of music  and sounds of the feast came with decreasing distinctness. It seemed to  Lygia that she had been rescued from hell, and borne into God's bright  world outside. There was something, then, besides that disgusting  triclinium. There was the sky, the dawn, light, and peace. Sudden  weeping seized the maiden, and, taking shelter on the arm of the giant,  she repeated, with sobbing,--\"Let us go home, Ursus! home, to the house  of Aulus.\"    \"Let us go!\" answered Ursus.    They found themselves now in the small atrium of Acte's apartments.  Ursus placed Lygia on a marble bench at a distance from the fountain.  Acte strove to pacify her; she urged her to sleep, and declared that  for the moment there was no danger,--after the feast the drunken guests  would sleep till evening. For a long time Lygia could not calm  herself, and, pressing her temples with both hands, she repeated like a  child,--\"Let us go home, to the house of Aulus!\"    Ursus was ready. At the gates stood pretorians, it is true, but he  would pass them. The soldiers would not stop out-going people. The space  before the arch was crowded with litters. Guests were beginning to go  forth in throngs. No one would detain them. They would pass with the  crowd and go home directly. For that matter, what does he care? As the  queen commands, so must it be. He is there to carry out her orders.    \"Yes, Ursus,\" said Lygia, \"let us go.\"    Acte was forced to find reason for both. They would pass out, true; no  one would stop them. But it is not permitted to flee from the house of  Caesar; whoso does that offends Caesar's majesty. They may go; but in the  evening a centurion at the head of soldiers will take a death sentence  to Aulus and Pomponia Graecina; they will bring Lygia to the palace  again, and then there will be no rescue for her. Should Aulus and his  wife receive her under their roof, death awaits them to a certainty.    Lygia's arms dropped. There was no other outcome. She must choose her  own ruin or that of Plautius. In going to the feast, she had hoped  that Vinicius and Petronius would win her from Caesar, and return her to  Pomponia; now she knew that it was they who had brought Caesar to remove  her from the house of Aulus. There was no help. Only a miracle could  save her from the abyss,--a miracle and the might of God.    \"Acte,\" said she, in despair, \"didst thou hear Vinicius say that Caesar  had given me to him, and that he will send slaves here this evening to  take me to his house?\"    \"I did,\" answered Acte; and, raising her arms from her side, she was  silent. The despair with which Lygia spoke found in her no echo. She  herself had been Nero's favorite. Her heart, though good, could not feel  clearly the shame of such a relation. A former slave, she had grown too  much inured to the law of slavery; and, besides, she loved Nero yet. If  he returned to her, she would stretch her arms to him, as to happiness.  Comprehending clearly that Lygia must become the mistress of the  youthful and stately Vinicius, or expose Aulus and Pomponia to ruin, she  failed to understand how the girl could hesitate.    \"In Caesar's house,\" said she, after a while, \"it would not be safer for  thee than in that of Vinicius.\"    And it did not occur to her that, though she told the truth, her words  meant, \"Be resigned to fate and become the concubine of Vinicius.\"    As to Lygia, who felt on her lips yet his kisses, burning as coals and  full of beastly desire, the blood rushed to her face with shame at the  mere thought of them.    \"Never,\" cried she, with an outburst, \"will I remain here, or at the  house of Vinicius,--never!\"    \"But,\" inquired Acte, \"is Vinicius hateful to thee?\"    Lygia was unable to answer, for weeping seized her anew. Acte gathered  the maiden to her bosom, and strove to calm her excitement. Ursus  breathed heavily, and balled his giant fists; for, loving his queen with  the devotion of a dog, he could not bear the sight of her tears. In his  half-wild Lygian heart was the wish to return to the triclinium, choke  Vinicius, and, should the need come, Caesar himself; but he feared to  sacrifice thereby his mistress, and was not certain that such an  act, which to him seemed very simple, would befit a confessor of the  Crucified Lamb.    But Acte, while caressing Lygia, asked again, \"Is he so hateful to  thee?\"    \"No,\" said Lygia; \"it is not permitted me to hate, for I am a  Christian.\"    \"I know, Lygia. I know also from the letters of Paul of Tarsus, that it  is not permitted to defile one's self, nor to fear death more than sin;  but tell me if thy teaching permits one person to cause the death of  others?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then how canst thou bring Caesar's vengeance on the house of Aulus?\"  A moment of silence followed. A bottomless abyss yawned before Lygia  again.    \"I ask,\" continued the young freedwoman, \"for I have compassion on  thee--and I have compassion on the good Pomponia and Aulus, and on their  child. It is long since I began to live in this house, and I know what  Caesar's anger is. No! thou art not at liberty to flee from here. One way  remains to thee: implore Vinicius to return thee to Pomponia.\"    But Lygia dropped on her knees to implore some one else. Ursus knelt  down after a while, too, and both began to pray in Caesar's house at the  morning dawn.    Acte witnessed such a prayer for the first time, and could not take her  eyes from Lygia, who, seen by her in profile, with raised hands, and  face turned heavenward, seemed to implore rescue. The dawn, casting  light on her dark hair and white peplus, was reflected in her eyes.  Entirely in the light, she seemed herself like light. In that pale  face, in those parted lips, in those raised hands and eyes, a kind of  superhuman exaltation was evident. Acte understood then why Lygia could  not become the concubine of any man. Before the face of Nero's former  favorite was drawn aside, as it were, a corner of that veil which hides  a world altogether different from that to which she was accustomed. She  was astonished by prayer in that abode of crime and infamy. A moment  earlier it had seemed to her that there was no rescue for Lygia; now she  began to think that something uncommon would happen, that some aid would  come,--aid so mighty that Caesar himself would be powerless to resist it;  that some winged army would descend from the sky to help that maiden, or  that the sun would spread its rays beneath her feet and draw her up to  itself. She had heard of many miracles among Christians, and she thought  now that everything said of them was true, since Lygia was praying.    Lygia rose at last, with a face serene with hope. Ursus rose too, and,  holding to the bench, looked at his mistress, waiting for her words.    But it grew dark in her eyes, and after a time two great tears rolled  down her checks slowly.    \"May God bless Pomponia and Aulus,\" said she. \"It is not permitted me to  bring ruin on them; therefore I shall never see them again.\"    Then turning to Ursus she said that he alone remained to her in the  world; that he must be to her as a protector and a father. They could  not seek refuge in the house of Aulus, for they would bring on it the  anger of Caesar. But neither could she remain in the house of Caesar or  that of Vinicius. Let Ursus take her then; let him conduct her out of  the city; let him conceal her in some place where neither Vinicius  nor his servants could find her. She would follow Ursus anywhere, even  beyond the sea, even beyond the mountains, to the barbarians, where the  Roman name was not heard, and whither the power of Caesar did not reach.  Let him take her and save her, for he alone had remained to her.    The Lygian was ready, and in sign of obedience he bent to her feet  and embraced them. But on the face of Acte, who had been expecting a  miracle, disappointment was evident. Had the prayer effected only that  much? To flee from the house of Caesar is to commit an offence"]]]
