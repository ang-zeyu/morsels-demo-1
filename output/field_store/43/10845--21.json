[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3261"],[0,"News from Nowhere; Or, An Epoch of Rest (#17)"],[1," crime is gone.  Again, many violent acts came from the artificial perversion of the  sexual passions, which caused overweening jealousy and the like miseries.  Now, when you look carefully into these, you will find that what lay at  the bottom of them was mostly the idea (a law-made idea) of the woman  being the property of the man, whether he were husband, father, brother,  or what not.  That idea has of course vanished with private property, as  well as certain follies about the 'ruin' of women for following their  natural desires in an illegal way, which of course was a convention  caused by the laws of private property.    \"Another cognate cause of crimes of violence was the family tyranny,  which was the subject of so many novels and stories of the past, and  which once more was the result of private property.  Of course that is  all ended, since families are held together by no bond of coercion, legal  or social, but by mutual liking and affection, and everybody is free to  come or go as he or she pleases.  Furthermore, our standards of honour  and public estimation are very different from the old ones; success in  besting our neighbours is a road to renown now closed, let us hope for  ever.  Each man is free to exercise his special faculty to the utmost,  and every one encourages him in so doing.  So that we have got rid of the  scowling envy, coupled by the poets with hatred, and surely with good  reason; heaps of unhappiness and ill-blood were caused by it, which with  irritable and passionate men--_i.e._, energetic and active men--often led  to violence.\"    I laughed, and said: \"So that you now withdraw your admission, and say  that there is no violence amongst you?\"    \"No,\" said he, \"I withdraw nothing; as I told you, such things will  happen.  Hot blood will err sometimes.  A man may strike another, and the  stricken strike back again, and the result be a homicide, to put it at  the worst.  But what then?  Shall we the neighbours make it worse still?  Shall we think so poorly of each other as to suppose that the slain man  calls on us to revenge him, when we know that if he had been maimed, he  would, when in cold blood and able to weigh all the circumstances, have  forgiven his manner?  Or will the death of the slayer bring the slain man  to life again and cure the unhappiness his loss has caused?\"    \"Yes,\" I said, \"but consider, must not the safety of society be  safeguarded by some punishment?\"    \"There, neighbour!\" said the old man, with some exultation \"You have hit  the mark.  That _punishment_ of which men used to talk so wisely and act  so foolishly, what was it but the expression of their fear?  And they had  need to fear, since they--_i.e._, the rulers of society--were dwelling  like an armed band in a hostile country.  But we who live amongst our  friends need neither fear nor punish.  Surely if we, in dread of an  occasional rare homicide, an occasional rough blow, were solemnly and  legally to commit homicide and violence, we could only be a society of  ferocious cowards.  Don't you think so, neighbour?\"    \"Yes, I do, when I come to think of it from that side,\" said I.    \"Yet you must understand,\" said the old man, \"that when any violence is  committed, we expect the transgressor to make any atonement possible to  him, and he himself expects it.  But again, think if the destruction or  serious injury of a man momentarily overcome by wrath or folly can be any  atonement to the commonwealth?  Surely it can only be an additional  injury to it.\"    Said I: \"But suppose the man has a habit of violence,--kills a man a  year, for instance?\"    \"Such a thing is unknown,\" said he.  \"In a society where there is no  punishment to evade, no law to triumph over, remorse will certainly  follow transgression.\"    \"And lesser outbreaks of violence,\" said I, \"how do you deal with them?  for hitherto we have been talking of great tragedies, I suppose?\"    Said Hammond: \"If the ill-doer is not sick or mad (in which case he must  be restrained till his sickness or madness is cured) it is clear that  grief and humiliation must follow the ill-deed; and society in general  will make that pretty clear to the ill-doer if he should chance to be  dull to it; and again, some kind of atonement will follow,--at the least,  an open acknowledgement of the grief and humiliation.  Is it so hard to  say, I ask your pardon, neighbour?--Well, sometimes it is hard--and let  it be.\"    \"You think that enough?\" said I.    \"Yes,\" said he, \"and moreover it is all that we _can_ do.  If in addition  we torture the man, we turn his grief into anger, and the humiliation he  would otherwise feel for _his_ wrong-doing is swallowed up by a hope of  revenge for _our_ wrong-doing to him.  He has paid the legal penalty, and  can 'go and sin again' with comfort.  Shall we commit such a folly, then?  Remember Jesus had got the legal penalty remitted before he said 'Go and  sin no more.'  Let alone that in a society of equals you will not find  any one to play the part of torturer or jailer, though many to act as  nurse or doctor.\"    \"So,\" said I, \"you consider crime a mere spasmodic disease, which  requires no body of criminal law to deal with it?\"    \"Pretty much so,\" said he; \"and since, as I have told you, we are a  healthy people generally, so we are not likely to be much troubled with  _this_ disease.\"    \"Well, you have no civil law, and no criminal law.  But have you no laws  of the market, so to say--no regulation for the exchange of wares? for  you must exchange, even if you have no property.\"    Said he: \"We have no obvious individual exchange, as you saw this morning  when you went a-shopping; but of course there are regulations of the  markets, varying according to the circumstances and guided by general  custom.  But as these are matters of general assent, which nobody dreams  of objecting to, so also we have made no provision for enforcing them:  therefore I don't call them laws.  In law, whether it be criminal or  civil, execution always follows judgment, and someone must suffer.  When  you see the judge on his bench, you see through him, as clearly as if he  were made of glass, the policeman to emprison, and the soldier to slay  some actual living person.  Such follies would make an agreeable market,  wouldn't they?\"    \"Certainly,\" said I, \"that means turning the market into a mere battle-  field, in which many people must suffer as much as in the battle-field of  bullet and bayonet.  And from what I have seen I should suppose that your  marketing, great and little, is carried on in a way that makes it a  pleasant occupation.\"    \"You are right, neighbour,\" said he.  \"Although there are so many, indeed  by far the greater number amongst us, who would be unhappy if they were  not engaged in actually making things, and things which turn out  beautiful under their hands,--there are many, like the housekeepers I was  speaking of, whose delight is in administration and organisation, to use  long-tailed words; I mean people who like keeping things together,  avoiding waste, seeing that nothing sticks fast uselessly.  Such people  are thoroughly happy in their business, all the more as they are dealing  with actual facts, and not merely passing counters round to see what  share they shall have in the privileged taxation of useful people, which  was the business of the commercial folk in past days.  Well, what are you  going to ask me next?\"          CHAPTER XIII: CONCERNING POLITICS      Said I: \"How do you manage with politics?\"    Said Hammond, smiling: \"I am glad that it is of _me_ that you ask that  question; I do believe that anybody else would make you explain yourself,  or try to do so, till you were sickened of asking questions.  Indeed, I  believe I am the only man in England who would know what you mean; and  since I know, I will answer your question briefly by saying that we are  very well off as to politics,--because we have none.  If ever you make a  book out of this conversation, put this in a chapter by itself, after the  model of old Horrebow's Snakes in Iceland.\"    \"I will,\" said I.          CHAPTER XIV: HOW MATTERS ARE MANAGED      Said I: \"How about your relations with foreign nations?\"    \"I will not affect not to know what you mean,\" said he, \"but I will tell  you at once that the whole system of rival and contending nations which  played so great a part in the 'government' of the world of civilisation  has disappeared along with the inequality betwixt man and man in  society.\"    \"Does not that make the world duller?\" said I.    \"Why?\" said the old man.    \"The obliteration of national variety,\" said I.    \"Nonsense,\" he said, somewhat snappishly.  \"Cross the water and see.  You  will find plenty of variety: the landscape, the building, the diet, the  amusements, all various.  The men and women varying in looks as well as  in habits of thought; the costume far more various than in the commercial  period.  How should it add to the variety or dispel the dulness, to  coerce certain families or tribes, often heterogeneous and jarring with  one another, into certain artificial and mechanical groups, and call them  nations, and stimulate their patriotism--_i.e._, their foolish and  envious prejudices?\"    \"Well--I don't know how,\" said I.    \"That's right,\" said Hammond cheerily; \"you can easily understand that  now we are freed from this folly it is obvious to us that by means of  this very diversity the different strains of blood in the world can be  serviceable and pleasant to each other, without in the least wanting to  rob each other: we are all bent on the same enterprise, making the most  of our lives.  And I must tell you whatever quarrels or misunderstandings  arise, they very seldom take place between people of different race; and  consequently since there is less unreason in them, they are the more  readily appeased.\"    \"Good,\" said I, \"but as to those matters of politics; as to general"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32677"],[0,"The Invention of the Sewing Machine (#17)"],[1,"that  produced sewing-machine cases and attachments. The yearly value of these  products was approximately four and a half million dollars, of which the  amount exported in 1861 was $61,000. Although the number of  sewing-machine factories dropped from 74 in 1860 to 69 by 1870, the  value of the machines produced increased to almost sixteen million  dollars.    The number of sewing-machine companies fluctuated greatly from year to  year as many attempted to enter this new field of manufacture. Some were  not able to make a commercial success of their products. The Civil War  did not seem to be an important factor in the number of companies in  business in the North. Although one manufacturer ceased operations in  Richmond, Virginia, and a Vermont firm converted to arms manufacture,  several companies began operations during the war years. Of the 69 firms  in business in 1870, only part had been in business since 1860 or  before; some were quite new as a result of the expiration of the Howe  patent renewal in 1867.    Probably due to the termination of many of the major patents, there were  124 factories in 1880, but the yearly product value remained at sixteen  million dollars. The 1890 census reports only 66 factories with a yearly  production of a little less than the earlier decade. But by 1900, the  yearly production of a like number of factories had reached a value of  over twenty-one million, of which four and a half million dollars worth  were exported annually. The total value of American sewing machines  exported from 1860 to 1900 was approximately ninety million dollars. The  manufacture of sewing machines made a significant contribution to the  economic development of 19th-century America.

[90] Sewing-machine manufacture in the South was just beginning to  blossom when it was curtailed by the outbreak of the Civil War. See  Lester sewing machine, figure 109 on page 102.          II. American Sewing-Machine Companies of the 19th Century      During the latter half of the 19th century, there was a total of two  hundred or more sewing-machine companies in the United States. Although  a great many manufacturing-type machines were sold, this business was  carried on by relatively few companies and most were primarily concerned  with the family-type machines. A representative number of these family  machines together with information concerning both the company and  serial-number dating are found in figures 68 through 132. A great many  of the companies were licensed by the \"Combination,\" but, in addition,  some companies were constructing machines that did not infringe the  patents, other companies infringed the patents but managed to avoid  legal action, and there were numerous companies that mushroomed into  existence after the \"Combination\" was dissolved in 1877. Most of the  latter were very short-lived. It is difficult to establish the exact  dates of some of these companies as many of their records were  incomplete or have since disappeared; even a great many of the  \"Combination\" records were lost by fire. A summary of the existing  records kept by the \"Combination\" is given in figure 37.    As will be noted in the subsequent listing, only a small percentage of  the companies were in business for a period longer than ten years; of  those that continued longer, all but a few had disappeared by 1910.  Today there are about sixty United States sewing-machine companies. Most  of them manufacture highly specialized sewing machines used for specific  types of commercial work; only a few produce family or home-style  machines. Foreign competition has increased, and the high cost of  skilled labor in this country has made competition in this  consumer-product field increasingly difficult. The countless varieties  of American family sewing machines, so evident in the 19th century, have  passed away.
