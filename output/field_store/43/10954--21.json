And from the time Adam left the garden until he wedded Eve, were  two hundred and twenty-three days, that is seven months and thirteen  days.    9 Thus was Satan's war with Adam defeated.          Chapter LXXIV - The birth of Cain and Luluwa.  Why they received those  names.    1 And they lived on the earth working in order to keep their bodies in  good health; and they continued so until the nine months of Eve's  pregnancy were over, and the time drew near when she must give birth.    2 Then she said to Adam, \"The signs placed in this cave since we left  the garden indicate that this is a pure place and we will be praying in  it again some time.  It is not appropriate then, that I should give  birth in it.  Let us instead go to the sheltering rock cave that was  formed by the command of God when Satan threw a big rock down on us in  an attempt to kill us with it.    3 Adam then took Eve to that cave.  When the time came for her to give  birth, she strained a lot.  Adam felt sorry, and he was very worried  about her because she was close to death and the words of God to her  were being fulfilled: \"In suffering shall you bear a child, and in  sorrow shall you bring forth a child.\"    4 But when Adam saw the distress in which Eve was, he got up and prayed  to God, and said, \"O Lord, look at me with the eye of Your mercy, and  bring her out of her distress.\"    5 And God looked at His maid-servant Eve, and delivered her, and she  gave birth to her first-born son, and with him a daughter.    6 The Adam rejoiced at Eve's deliverance, and also over the children  she had borne him.  And Adam ministered to Eve in the cave, until the  end of eight days; when they named the son Cain, and the daughter  Luluwa.    7 The meaning of Cain is \"hater,\" because he hated his sister in their  mother's womb; before they came out of it.  Therefore Adam named him  Cain.    8 But Luluwa means \"beautiful,\" because she was more beautiful than her  mother.    9 Then Adam and Eve waited until Cain and his sister were forty days  old, when Adam said to Eve, \"We will make an offering and offer it up  in behalf of the children.\"    10 And Eve said, \"We will make one offering for the first-born son and  then later we shall make one for the daughter.\"          Chapter LXXV - The family revisits the Cave of Treasures.  Birth of  Abel and Aklia.    1 Then Adam prepared an offering, and he and Eve offered it up for  their children, and brought it to the altar they had built at first.    2 And Adam offered up the offering, and asked God to accept his  offering.    3 Then God accepted Adam's offering, and sent a light from heaven that  shown on the offering.  Adam and his son drew near to the offering, but  Eve and the daughter did not approach it.    4 Adam and his son were joyful as they came down from on the altar.  Adam and Eve waited until the daughter was eighty days old, then Adam  prepared an offering and took it to Eve and to the children. They went  to the altar, where Adam offered it up, as he was accustomed, asking  the Lord to accept his offering.    5 And the Lord accepted the offering of Adam and Eve.  Then Adam, Eve,  and the children, drew near together, and came down from the mountain,  rejoicing.    6 But they returned not to the cave in which they were born; but came  to the Cave of Treasures, in order that the children should go around  in it, and be blessed with the tokens brought from the garden.    7 But after they had been blessed with these tokens, they went back to  the cave in which they were born.    8 However, before Eve had offered up the offering, Adam had taken her,  and had gone with her to the river of water, in which they threw  themselves at first; and there they washed themselves.  Adam washed his  body and Eve hers also clean, after the suffering and distress that had  come over them.    9 But Adam and Eve, after washing themselves in the river of water,  returned every night to the Cave of Treasures, where they prayed and  were blessed; and then went back to their cave, where their children  were born.    10 Adam and Eve did this until the children had been weaned.  After  they were weaned, Adam made an offering for the souls of his children  in addition to the three times every week he made an offering for them.    11 When the children were weaned, Eve again conceived, and when her  pregnancy came to term, she gave birth to another son and daughter.  They named the son Abel and the daughter Aklia.    12 Then at the end of forty days, Adam made an offering for the son,  and at the end of eighty days he made another offering for the  daughter, and treated them, as he had previously treated Cain and his  sister Luluwa.    13 He brought them to the Cave of Treasures, where they received a  blessing, and then returned to the cave where they were born.  After  these children were born, Eve stopped having children.          Chapter LXXVI - Cain becomes jealous of Abel because of his sisters.    1 And the children began to grow stronger and taller; but Cain was  hard-hearted, and ruled over his younger brother.    2 Often when his father made an offering, Cain would remain behind and  not go with them, to offer up.    3 But, as to Abel, he had a meek heart, and was obedient to his father  and mother.  He frequently moved them to make an offering, because he  loved it.  He prayed and fasted a lot.    4 Then came this sign to Abel.  As he was coming into the Cave of  Treasures, and saw the golden rods, the incense and the myrrh, he asked  his parents, Adam and Eve, to tell him about them and asked, \"Where did  you get these from?\"    5 Then Adam told him all that had befallen them.  And Abel felt deeply  about what his father told him.    6 Furthermore his father, Adam, told him of the works of God, and of  the garden.  After hearing that, Abel remained behind after his father  left and stayed the whole of that night in the Cave of Treasures.    7 And that night, while he was praying, Satan appeared to him under the  figure of a man, who said to him, \"You have frequently moved your  father into making offerings, fasting and praying, therefore I will  kill you, and make you perish from this world.\"    8 But as for Abel, he prayed to God, and drove away Satan from him; and  did not believe the words of the devil.  Then when it was day, an angel  of God appeared to him, who said to him, \"Do not cut short either  fasting, prayer, or offering up an offering to your God.  For, look,  the Lord had accepted your prayer.  Be not afraid of the figure which  appeared to you in the night, and who cursed you to death.\"  And the  angel departed from him.    9 Then when it was day, Abel came to Adam and Eve, and told them of the  vision he had seen.  When they heard it, they grieved much over it, but  said nothing to him about it; they only comforted him.    10 But as to the hard-hearted Cain, Satan came to him by night, showed  himself and said to him, \"Since Adam and Eve love your brother Abel so  much more than they love you, they wish to join him in marriage to your  beautiful sister because they love him.  However, they wish to join you  in marriage to his ugly sister, because they hate you.    11 Now before they do that, I am telling you that you should kill your  brother. That way your sister will be left for you, and his sister will  be cast away.\"    12 And Satan departed from him.  But the devil remained behind in  Cain's heart, and frequently aspired to kill his brother.          Chapter LXXVII - Cain, 15 years old, and Abel 12 years old, grow apart.    1 But when Adam saw that the older brother hated the younger, he  endeavored to soften their hearts, and said to Cain, \"O my son, take of  the fruits of your sowing and make an offering to God, so that He might  forgive you for your wickedness and sin.\"    2 He said also to Abel, \"Take some of your sowing and make an offering  and bring it to God, so that He might forgive you for your wickedness  and sin.\"    3 Then Abel obeyed his father's voice, took some of his sowing, and  made a good offering, and said to his father, Adam, \"Come with me and  show me how to offer it up.\"    4 And they went, Adam and Eve with him, and they showed him how to  offer up his gift on the altar.  Then after that, they stood up and  prayed that God would accept Abel's offering.    5 Then God looked at Abel and accepted his offering.  And God was more  pleased with Abel than with his offering, because of his good heart and  pure body.  There was no trace of guile in him.    6 Then they came down from the altar, and went to the cave in which  they lived.  But Abel, by reason of his joy at having made his  offering, repeated it three times a week, after the example of his  father Adam.    7 But as to Cain, he did not want to make an offering, but after his  father became very angry, he offered up a gift once.  He took the  smallest of his sheep for an offering and when he offered it up, his  eyes were on the lamb.    8 Therefore God did not accept his offering, because his heart was full  of murderous thoughts.    9 And they all thus lived together in the cave in which Eve had brought  forth, until Cain was fifteen years old, and Abel twelve years old.          Chapter LXXVIII - Jealousy overcomes Cain.  He makes trouble in the  family.  How the first murder was planned.    1 Then Adam said to Eve, \"Behold the children are grown up; we must  think of finding wives for them.\"    2 Then Eve answered, \"How can we do it?\"    3 Then Adam said to her, \"We will join Abel's sister in marriage to  Cain, and Cain's sister to Abel.    4 The said Eve to Adam, \"I do not like Cain because he is hard-hearted;  but let them stay"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39996"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 5 (of 6) (#17)"],[1,"al piu potente fa contrasto!    Che perde la vittoria; e sempre al fine,    Oltra lo scorno, di dolor si e guasto!                                          _Opera_ V. 210.      Fool, that will dare to cross the path of one    More powerful! and ever to the loss    Of victory, at last add scorn and grief.    It was now that the Caracci, more than ever confident in their style,  answered the voice of censure only by works full of vigour and nature,  opposed to the works of older masters, feeble and void of truth. By such  means that revolution of style which had so long been meditated, at length  took place; but it became necessary, in order to accelerate it, to bring  over the students of the art to their party, the better to insure the hopes  of a new and improved era. This too the Caracci achieved, by opening an  academy of painting at their house, which they entitled _Degli  Incamminati_, supplying it with casts, designs, and prints, in the same  manner as those of their rivals; besides introducing a school for the  drawing of the naked figure, and for the study of anatomy and perspective:  in short, every thing requisite to the art; directing the whole with a  skill added to a kindness that could not fail to procure it abundance of  pupils. In particular, the fiery temper of Dionisio Calvart contributed to  fill it, who, being in the habit of striking, and even wounding his  disciples, drove Guido, Albano, and Domenichino, to transfer their talents  to the studio of the Caracci. Panico too entered it from the school of  Fontana, and from all sides the best young artists assembled, drawing after  them fresh ranks of students. Finally, the other academies were closed;  every school was left to solitude; every name gave way before that of the  Caracci; to them the best commissions, to them the meed of praise were  accorded. Their humbled rivals soon assumed another language, especially  when the grand hall of Magnani was thrown open, presenting the wonders of  the new Carraccesque art. It was then Cesi declared that he would become a  disciple of the new school; and Fontana only lamented that he was too  grey-headed to keep pace with it, while Calvart alone, with his usual  bravado, ventured to blame the work, being the last of all to recant, or at  least to become silent.    It is now time to record the pursuits and the maxims of an academy, which,  besides educating many illustrious pupils, perfected the art of their  masters; and confirmed the axiom, that the shortest method of learning much  is that of teaching. The three brothers were on the most perfect  understanding as to the art of teaching, as free from venality as from  envy; but the most laborious branches of the professorship were sustained  by Agostino. He had drawn up a short treatise of perspective and  architecture, from which he expounded to the school. He explained the  nature of the bones and muscles, designating them by their names, in which  he was assisted by Lanzoni the anatomist, who also secretly provided the  school with bodies for such dissections as were required. His lectures were  sometimes founded upon history, at others upon fictions; and these he  illustrated, and offered for designs, which being exhibited at stated  intervals, were examined by skilful judges, who decided upon their  respective merits; as we gather from a ticket written to Cesi, one of the  arbiters. The meed of fame was sufficient for the crowned candidates, round  whom the poets collected to celebrate their name; with whom Agostino  enthusiastically joined both with harp and voice, applauding the progress  of his scholars. These last were likewise instructed in true criticism, and  to give due praise or blame to the works of others; they were also taught  to criticise their own works, and whoever could not give good reasons for  what he had done, and defend his own work, must cancel it upon the spot.  Each, however, was at liberty to pursue what path he pleased, or rather  each entered upon that to which nature had best adapted him, which gave  rise to so many original manners from the same studio; yet each style was  to be founded upon reason, nature, and imitation. In all more doubtful  points, recourse was had to the opinion of Lodovico; the cousins presided  over the daily exercises of design, full of assiduity, industry, and  perseverance. Even the recreations of the academicians had a view to art;  to draw landscapes from nature, or to sketch caricatures, were the  customary amusements of Annibale and the disciples of the school, when they  wished to relax from study.[23]         Footnote 23: It must be observed that the two younger       Caracci visited Rome, where they continued to instruct their       pupils on the same plan. Passeri, in his life of Guido,       says, that they were joined by literary men, who proposed       history-pieces to them, with premiums for such as should be       best executed; and that on one occasion Domenichino, one of       the youngest, being preferred above all, Guido was seized       with the most lively emulation to eclipse him. The historian       adds, that the same method was soon adopted in the Roman       academy, and that Car. Barberini, nephew to Urban VIII.,       presided at the election of the first, and rewarded him with       money, and those that next followed, to the fourth member.       Moreover he gave the first a commission for a picture from       the same subject as the design. What a secret is here shewn       for promoting the fine arts.    The maxim of uniting together the study of nature, and the imitation of the  best masters, already touched upon in the outset of this book, formed the  real foundation of the school of Caracci; although they took care to modify  it according to particular talents, as we have seen. Their object was to  collect into one whatever they found most valuable in other schools, and in  this process they observed two methods. The first resembles that of the  poets, who, in several Canzoni, propose different models for imitation; in  one, for instance, borrowing from Petrarch, in another from Chiabrera, in a  third from Frugoni. The second method is like that of those, who, being  masters of these three styles, form and harmonize them into one, like  Corinthian metal, composed of various other kinds. Thus the Caracci, in  some of their compositions, were accustomed to present different styles in  a variety of different figures. So Lodovico, in his Preaching of St. John  the Baptist, at the church of the Certosini (where Crespi is especially  opposed to Paul Veronese), has exhibited the audience of the saint in such  a manner that a judge described them by these names:--the Raffaellesque,  the Tizianesque, and the imitator of Tintoretto. Annibal too, who had long  admired only Coreggio, having finally adopted Lodovico's maxim, painted his  celebrated picture for the church of St. George, where, in his figure of  the Virgin, he imitated Paolo; in that of the Divine Infant and St. John,  Coreggio; in St. John the Evangelist he exhibited Titian; and in the very  graceful form of St. Catherine, the sweetness of Parmigianino. Most  generally, however, they pursued the second path, and still more examples  might be adduced of less apparent and more free and mixed imitations, so  modified as to produce a whole of a perfectly original character. And the  ingenious Agostino, emulating the ancient legislators, who embodied all  their laws in a few verses, composed that very picturesque, rather than  poetical sonnet, in praise of Niccolino Abati, but which also well explains  the maxim of their school, in selecting the peculiar merits of each  different style. It has been handed down to us by Malvasia, in his life of  Primaticcio, and runs as follows:--      Chi farsi un buon pittor brama e desia      Il disegno di Roma abbia alla mano,      La mossa coll'ombrar Veneziano,    E il degno colorir di Lombardia;    Di Michelangiol la terribil via,      Il vero natural di Tiziano,      Di Coreggio lo stil puro e sovrano,    Di un Raffael la vera simmetria;    Del Tibaldi il decoro e il fondamento,      Del dotto Primaticcio l'inventare,      E un po' di grazia del Parmigianino:    Ma senza tanti studii e tanto stento    Si ponga solo l'opre ad imitare      Che qui lasciocci il nostro Niccolino.      To paint for fame, who nurtures high desire,      Will Rome's design keep ever in his view;      To the Venetian shade and action true,    Of Lombardy's whole colouring never tire;    Kindle at Michael's terrors, and his fire,      Seize Titian's living truth, who nature drew;      Allegri's pure and sovereign graces too;    To heavenly Raphael's symmetry aspire:    Tibaldi's solid sense, appropriate air,      And Primaticcio's learn'd inventive thought,      With Parmigiano's graceful sweetness fraught.    And should all these ask too much studious care,      Turn to our Niccolino's bright display      Of wondrous works, the envy of his day.    It is not easy to ascertain how far the Caracci may have carried this  project, though it must always reflect the highest degree of credit upon  them to have executed it in a superior manner to all other artists. In the  outset they most felt their deficiency in their imitation of the antique,  called by Agostino the design of Rome. He and Annibal, however, while  residing there as strangers, in some measure reproduced and restored it to  Roman artists themselves; and Lodovico, though remaining at Bologna, shewed  that he was by no means unacquainted with it. At first, observes Mengs,  they devoted much study to Coreggio, both in their ample outline and in  their general design, although they did not observe the same exact  equilibrium in their concave and convex lines, but rather affected the  latter. There were other points which they did not attempt to include in  such imitation, as in the shortening of the heads, and exhibiting them so"]]]
