Dan scoffed at their \"nonsense,\" and swore stoutly as he tried to teach  them the new game.    But Tommy was very sleepy, and Nat's head began to ache with the beer  and the smoke, so neither of them was very quick to learn, and the game  dragged. The room was nearly dark, for the lantern burned badly; they  could not laugh loud nor move about much, for Silas slept next door in  the shed-chamber, and altogether the party was dull. In the middle of a  deal Dan stopped suddenly, and called out, \"Who's that?\" in a startled  tone, and at the same moment drew the slide over the light. A voice in  the darkness said tremulously, \"I can't find Tommy,\" and then there was  the quick patter of bare feet running away down the entry that led from  the wing to the main house.    \"It's Demi! he's gone to call some one; cut into bed, Tom, and don't  tell!\" cried Dan, whisking all signs of the revel out of sight, and  beginning to tear off his clothes, while Nat did the same.    Tommy flew to his room and dived into bed, where he lay, laughing  till something burned his hand, when he discovered that he was still  clutching the stump of the festive cigar, which he happened to be  smoking when the revel broke up.    It was nearly out, and he was about to extinguish it carefully when  Nursey's voice was heard, and fearing it would betray him if he hid it  in the bed, he threw it underneath, after a final pinch which he thought  finished it.    Nursey came in with Demi, who looked much amazed to see the red face of  Tommy reposing peacefully upon his pillow.    \"He wasn't there just now, because I woke up and could not find him  anywhere,\" said Demi, pouncing on him.    \"What mischief are you at now, bad child?\" asked Nursey, with a  good-natured shake, which made the sleeper open his eyes to say meekly,    \"I only ran into Nat's room to see him about something. Go away, and let  me alone; I'm awful sleepy.\"    Nursey tucked Demi in, and went off to reconnoitre, but only found two  boys slumbering peacefully in Dan's room. \"Some little frolic,\" she  thought, and as there was no harm done she said nothing to Mrs. Bhaer,  who was busy and worried over little Teddy.    Tommy was sleepy, and telling Demi to mind his own business and not ask  questions, he was snoring in ten minutes, little dreaming what was going  on under his bed. The cigar did not go out, but smouldered away on the  straw carpet till it was nicely on fire, and a hungry little flame went  creeping along till the dimity bedcover caught, then the sheets, and  then the bed itself. The beer made Tommy sleep heavily, and the smoke  stupified Demi, so they slept on till the fire began to scorch them, and  they were in danger of being burned to death.    Franz was sitting up to study, and as he left the school-room he smelt  the smoke, dashed up-stairs and saw it coming in a cloud from the left  wing of the house. Without stopping to call any one, he ran into the  room, dragged the boys from the blazing bed, and splashed all the water  he could find at hand on to the flames. It checked but did not quench  the fire, and the children wakened on being tumbled topsy-turvy into  a cold hall, began to roar at the top of their voices. Mrs. Bhaer  instantly appeared, and a minute after Silas burst out of his room  shouting, \"Fire!\" in a tone that raised the whole house. A flock of  white goblins with scared faces crowded into the hall, and for a minute  every one was panic-stricken.    Then Mrs. Bhaer found her wits, bade Nursey see to the burnt boys, and  sent Franz and Silas down-stairs for some tubs of wet clothes which  she flung on the bed, over the carpet, and up against the curtains, now  burning finely, and threatening to kindle the walls.    Most of the boys stood dumbly looking on, but Dan and Emil worked  bravely, running to and fro with water from the bath-room, and helping  to pull down the dangerous curtains.    The peril was soon over, and ordering the boys all back to bed, and  leaving Silas to watch lest the fire broke out again, Mrs. Bhaer and  Franz went to see how the poor boys got on. Demi had escaped with one  burn and a grand scare, but Tommy had not only most of his hair scorched  off his head, but a great burn on his arm, that made him half crazy with  the pain. Demi was soon made cosy, and Franz took him away to his own  bed, where the kind lad soothed his fright and hummed him to sleep as  cosily as a woman. Nursey watched over poor Tommy all night, trying to  ease his misery, and Mrs. Bhaer vibrated between him and little Teddy  with oil and cotton, paregoric and squills, saying to herself from time  to time, as if she found great amusement in the thought, \"I always knew  Tommy would set the house on fire, and now he has done it!\"    When Mr. Bhaer got home next morning he found a nice state of things.  Tommy in bed, Teddy wheezing like a little grampus, Mrs. Jo quite used  up, and the whole flock of boys so excited that they all talked at once,  and almost dragged him by main force to view the ruins. Under his quiet  management things soon fell into order, for every one felt that he was  equal to a dozen conflagrations, and worked with a will at whatever task  he gave them.    There was no school that morning, but by afternoon the damaged room was  put to rights, the invalids were better, and there was time to hear and  judge the little culprits quietly. Nat and Tommy told their parts in the  mischief, and were honestly sorry for the danger they had brought to the  dear old house and all in it. But Dan put on his devil-may-care look,  and would not own that there was much harm done.    Now, of all things, Mr. Bhaer hated drinking, gambling, and swearing;  smoking he had given up that the lads might not be tempted to try it,  and it grieved and angered him deeply to find that the boy, with whom he  had tried to be most forbearing, should take advantage of his absence to  introduce these forbidden vices, and teach his innocent little lads  to think it manly and pleasant to indulge in them. He talked long and  earnestly to the assembled boys, and ended by saying, with an air of  mingled firmness and regret,    \"I think Tommy is punished enough, and that scar on his arm will remind  him for a long time to let these things alone. Nat's fright will do for  him, for he is really sorry, and does try to obey me. But you, Dan, have  been many times forgiven, and yet it does no good. I cannot have my boys  hurt by your bad example, nor my time wasted in talking to deaf ears, so  you can say good-bye to them all, and tell Nursey to put up your things  in my little black bag.\"    \"Oh! sir, where is he going?\" cried Nat.    \"To a pleasant place up in the country, where I sometimes send boys when  they don't do well here. Mr. Page is a kind man, and Dan will be happy  there if he chooses to do his best.\"    \"Will he ever come back?\" asked Demi.    \"That will depend on himself; I hope so.\"    As he spoke, Mr. Bhaer left the room to write his letter to Mr. Page,  and the boys crowded round Dan very much as people do about a man who is  going on a long and perilous journey to unknown regions.    \"I wonder if you'll like it,\" began Jack.    \"Shan't stay if I don't,\" said Dan coolly.    \"Where will you go?\" asked Nat.    \"I may go to sea, or out west, or take a look at California,\" answered  Dan, with a reckless air that quite took away the breath of the little  boys.    \"Oh, don't! stay with Mr. Page awhile and then come back here; do, Dan,\"  pleaded Nat, much affected at the whole affair.    \"I don't care where I go, or how long I stay, and I'll be hanged if I  ever come back here,\" with which wrathful speech Dan went away to put up  his things, every one of which Mr. Bhaer had given him.    That was the only good-bye he gave the boys, for they were all talking  the matter over in the barn when he came down, and he told Nat not to  call them. The wagon stood at the door, and Mrs. Bhaer came out to speak  to Dan, looking so sad that his heart smote him, and he said in a low  tone,    \"May I say good-bye to Teddy?\"    \"Yes, dear; go in and kiss him, he will miss his Danny very much.\"    No one saw the look in Dan's eyes as he stooped over the crib, and saw  the little face light up at first sight of him, but he heard Mrs. Bhaer  say pleadingly,    \"Can't we give the poor lad one more trial, Fritz?\" and Mr. Bhaer answer  in his steady way,    \"My dear, it is not best, so let him go where he can do no harm to  others, while they do good to him, and by and by he shall come back, I  promise you.\"    \"He's the only boy we ever failed with, and I am so grieved, for I  thought there was the making of a fine man in him, spite of his faults.\"    Dan heard Mrs. Bhaer sigh, and he wanted to ask for one more trial  himself, but his pride would not let him, and he came out with the hard  look on his face, shook hands without a word, and drove away with Mr.  Bhaer, leaving Nat and Mrs. Jo to look after him with tears in their  eyes.    A few days afterwards they received a letter from Mr. Page, saying that  Dan was doing well, whereat they all rejoiced. But three weeks later  came another letter, saying that Dan had run away, and nothing had been  heard of him, whereat they all looked sober, and Mr. Bhaer said,    \"Perhaps I ought to have given him another chance.\"    Mrs. Bhaer, however, nodded wisely and answered, \"Don't be troubled,  Fritz; the boy will come back to us, I'm sure of it.\"    But time went on and no Dan came.        CHAPTER VII. NAUGHTY NAN    \"Fritz, I've got a new idea,\" cried Mrs. Bhaer, as she met her husband  one day after school.    \"Well, my dear, what is it?\" and he waited willingly to hear the new  plan, for some of Mrs. Jo's ideas were so droll, it was impossible to  help laughing at them, though usually they were quite sensible, and he  was glad to carry them out."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27887"],[0,"Wild Animals at Home (#17)"],[1,"is littered over with the scales fresh cut  from a pine cone; sometimes there is a pile of a bushel or more by the  place; you have stumbled on a Squirrel's workshop. Here is where he does  his husking, and the \"clear corn\" produced is stored away in some  underground granary till It is needed.    The Pine Squirrel loves to nest in a hollow tree, but also builds an  outside nest which at a distance looks like a mass of rubbish. This, on  investigation, turns out to be a convenient warm chamber some six inches  wide and two or three high. It is covered with a waterproof roof of bark  thatch, and entered by a door artfully concealed with layers and fringes  of bark that hide it alike from blood-thirsty foes and piercing winter  blasts.    [Illustration]      CHIPMUNKS AND GROUND-SQUIRRELS    The Red-squirrel is safe and happy only when in the tall trees, but his  kinsmen have sought out any and every different environment. One  enormous group of his great grandfather's second cousins have abandoned  tree life altogether. They have settled down like the Dakota farmers, to  be happy on the prairie, where, never having need to get over anything  higher than their own front doorstep, they have lost the last vestige of  power to climb. These are the Ground-squirrels, that in a variety of  forms are a pest in gardens and on farms in most of the country west of  the Mississippi.    Standing between these and the true Squirrels are the elegant Chipmunks,  the prettiest and most popular of all the family. They frequent the  borderland between woods and prairie; they climb, if anything is to be  gained by it, but they know, like the Ground-squirrels, that Mother  Earth is a safer retreat in time of danger than the tallest tree that  ever grew.      THE GROUND-SQUIRREL THAT PLAYS PICKET-PIN    Conspicuous in its teeming numbers in the Yellowstone Park is the  Picket-Pin Ground-squirrel. On every level, dry prairie along the great  river I found it in swarms.    [Illustration]    It looks much like a common Squirrel, but its coat has become more  mud-coloured, and its tail is reduced by long ages of neglect to a mere  vestige of the ancestral banner. It has developed great powers of  burrowing, but it never climbs anything higher than the little mound  that it makes about the door of its home.    The Picket-pin is an interesting and picturesque creature in some ways,  but it has one habit that I cannot quite condone. In this land of sun  and bright blue air, this world of outdoor charm, it comes forth tardily  in late spring, as late sometimes as the first of May, and promptly  retires in mid-August, when blazing summer is on the face of the earth,  and the land is a land of plenty. Down it goes after three and one half  short months, to sleep for eight and a half long ones; and since during  these three and a half months it is above ground only in broad daylight,  this means that for only two months of the year it is active, and the  other ten, four fifths of its life, it passes in a deathlike sleep.    Of course, the Picket-pin might reply that it has probably as many hours  of active life as any of its kind, only it breaks them up into sections,  with long blanks of rest between. Whether this defense is a good one or  not, we have no facts at present to determine.    [Illustration]    It has a fashion of sitting up straight on the doorway mound when it  wishes to take an observation, and the more it is alarmed by the  approach of an enemy the straighter it sits up, pressing its paws tight  to its ribs, so that at a short distance it looks like a picket-pin of  wood; hence the name.    Oftentimes some tenderfoot going in the evening to stake out his horse  and making toward the selected patch of grassy prairie, exclaims, \"Good  Luck! here's a picket-pin already driven in.\" But on leading up his  horse within ten or twelve feet of the pin, it gives a little \"_chirr_\"  and dives down out of sight. Then the said tenderfoot realizes why the  creature got the name.    The summer of 1897 I spent in the Park about Yancey's and there had  daily chances of seeing the Picket-pin and learning its ways, for the  species was there in thousands on the little prairie about my cabin. I  think I am safe in saying that there were ten families to the acre of  land on all the level prairie in this valley.      CHINK AND THE PICKET-PINS    As already noted in the Coyote chapter, we had in camp that summer the  little dog called Chink. He was just old enough to think himself a  remarkable dog with a future before him. There was hardly anything that  Chink would not attempt, except perhaps keeping still. He was always  trying to do some absurd and impossible thing, or, if he did attempt the  possible, he usually spoiled his best efforts by his way of going about  it. He once spent a whole morning trying to run up a tall, straight,  pine tree in whose branches was a snickering Pine Squirrel.    The darling ambition of his life for some weeks was to catch one of the  Picket-pin Ground-squirrels that swarmed on the prairie about the camp.    Chink had determined to catch one of these Ground-squirrels the very  first day he came into the valley. Of course, he went about it in his  own original way, doing everything wrong end first, as usual. This, his  master said, was due to a streak of Irish in his makeup. So Chink would  begin a most elaborate stalk a quarter of a mile from the  Ground-squirrel. After crawling on his breast from tussock to tussock  for a hundred yards or so, the nervous strain would become too great,  and Chink, getting too much excited to crawl, would rise on his feet and  walk straight toward the Squirrel, which would now be sitting up by its  hole, fully alive to the situation.    After a minute or two of this very open approach, Chink's excitement  would overpower all caution. He would begin running, and at the last,  just as he should have done his finest stalking, he would go bounding  and barking toward the Ground-squirrel, which would sit like a peg of  wood till the proper moment, then dive below with a derisive chirrup,  throwing with its hind feet a lot of sand right into Chink's eager, open  mouth.    Day after day this went on with level sameness, and still Chink did not  give up, although I feel sure he had bushels of sand thrown in his mouth  that summer by the impudent Picket-pins.    [Illustration]    Perseverance, he seemed to believe, must surely win in the end, as  indeed it did. For, one day, he made an unusually elaborate stalk after  an unusually fine big Picket-pin, carried out all his absurd tactics,  finishing with the grand, boisterous charge, and actually caught his  victim; but this time it happened to be a _wooden_ picket-pin. Any one  who doubts that a dog knows when he has made a fool of himself should  have seen Chink that day as he sheepishly sneaked out of sight behind  the tent.      CHIPMUNKS    Every one recognizes as a Chipmunk the lively little creature that, with  striped coat and with tail aloft, dashes across all the roads and  chirrups on all the log piles that line the roads throughout the  timbered portions of the Park. I am sure I have often seen a thousand of  them in a mile of road between the Mammoth Hot Springs and Norris Geyser  Basin. The traveller who makes the entire round of the Park may see a  hundred thousand if he keeps his eyes open. While every one knows them  at once for Chipmunks, it takes a second and more careful glance to show  they are of three totally distinct kinds.      THE GROUND-SQUIRREL THAT PRETENDS IT'S A CHIPMUNK    First, largest, and least common, is the Big Striped Ground-squirrel,  the Golden Ground-squirrel or Say's Ground-squirrel, called  scientifically _Citellus lateralis cinerascens_. This, in spite of its  livery, is not a Chipmunk at all but a Ground-squirrel that is trying  hard to be a Chipmunk. And it makes a good showing so far as manners,  coat and stripes are concerned, but the incontrovertible evidence of its  inner life, as indicated by skull and makeup, tells us plainly that it  is merely a Ground-squirrel, a first cousin to the ignoble Picket-pin.    I found it especially common in the higher parts of the Park. It is  really a mountain species, at home chiefly among the rocks, yet is very  ready to take up its abode under buildings. At the Lake Hotel I saw a  number of them that lived around the back door, and were almost tamed  through the long protection there given them. Like most of these small  rodents, they are supposed to be grain-eaters but they really are  omnivorous, and quite ready to eat flesh and eggs, as well as seeds and  fruit. Warren in his \"Mammals of Colorado,\" tells of having seen one of  these Ground-squirrels kill some young Bluebirds; and adds another  instance of flesh-eating observed in the Yellowstone Park, where he and  two friends, riding along one of the roads, saw a Say Ground-squirrel  demurely squatting on a log, holding in its arms a tiny young Meadow  Mouse, from which it picked the flesh as one might pick corn from a cob.  Meadow Mice are generally considered a nuisance, and the one devoured  probably was of a cantankerous disposition; but just the same it gives  one an unpleasant sensation to think of this elegant little creature, in  appearance, innocence personified, wearing all the insignia of a  grain-eater, yet ruthlessly indulging in such a bloody and cannibal  feast.      A FOUR-LEGGED BIRD--THE NORTHERN CHIPMUNK    The early naturalists who first made the acquaintance of the Eastern  Ground-squirrel named it Tamias or \"The Steward.\" Later the Northern  Chipmunk was discovered and it was found to be more of a Chipmunk than  its Eastern cousin. The new one had all the specialties of the old kind,  but in a higher degree. So they named this one _Eutamias_, which means  \"good\" or \"extra good\" Chipmunk. And extra good this exquisite little  creature surely is in all that goes to make a"]]]
