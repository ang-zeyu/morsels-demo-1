It was a severe  ordeal for one who, up till then, had never even known what it  meant to receive a severe verbal scolding; for one who had never  seen a man's hand lifted in anger.    An end came at last to this horrible drive.    \"Thank Gawd, 'ere's 'orley!\" said the man who drove; and after  another minute or two the little cart came to a standstill in a  walled-in yard. The pony was taken out and stabled, and then the  man addressed as \"Matey,\" still sullen and sour, let down the tail-board  of the cart with a jerk, and dragged Finn out by the collar,  allowing him to fall with a thud from the cart to the ground,  rendered helpless by the strap round his fore-legs.    \"'Ere, get up outa that!\" growled the man, with a careless kick.  Then, seeing that Finn could not move, he bent down, unbuckled the  green enamelled strap, dragged it roughly away, and kicked the dog  again. Cramped and sore beyond belief, Finn staggered on to his  feet. A door was opened, and Finn was jerked and dragged into a  perfectly dark, evil-smelling hole, about four feet square, with an  earthen floor, from which horrible odours rose. The ground in this  place was filthy. It had no drainage and no ventilation, except a  few round holes in the door; which door was now slammed to and  locked on the outside.    \"Ain't ye goin' to give 'im a drink, matey?\" asked Bill, outside.    \"Drink be blowed! Let 'im wait till mornin'. Come in an' 'ave one  yerself. I'm blessed glad this night's job's done; an' if I can't  make fifty quid out 've it, I shall want to know the reason why, I  can tell yer. Big, ugly brute, ain't 'e! Strong as a mule, too.  _I'd_ want to be paid pretty 'andsome fer the keepin' o' such a  brute; but the American gent's red 'ot ter get 'im, I can tell yer.  Biggest ever bred, they tell me. I think I shall 'ave to stick on  another tenner, eh, Bill? Come on!\"    Their very voices were a misery to the shrinking, aching, choking  Finn, who stood shuddering in his fetid den, his sensitive nose  wrinkling with horror and disgust. His need of water was the thing  which hurt him the most cruelly; but the nature of his prison was a  good deal of a torture, too. Remember that his life so far had been  as cleanly and decent in detail as yours or mine. Certainly this  was a sad plight for the hero of the Kennel Club Show, and the  finest living descendant of a fifteen hundred year old line of  princes among dogs.          [Illustration]    CHAPTER VIII    FINN WALKS ALONE      For a long while after the men had left the scene of Finn's  miserable captivity, he remained standing, and occupying as small a  space as possible in his prison. The fastidiousness bred in him by  careful rearing told severely against Finn just now. He had never,  until this night, been without water to slake his thirst; and  never, never had he smelt anything so horrible as the earth of the  little den in which he was now confined. Also, the place was  actually filthy, as well as apparently so. Finn could not bring  himself to move in it. He stood shrinking by the door, with his  nose near a crack beside its hinges. For long he reflected upon the  events of that night, without moving. Then, gradually, thoughts of  Kathleen and Tara, and the sweet cleanliness and freedom of his home  beside the Downs, came swimming into Finn's mind, and these  thoughts seemed to add intolerably to the aching of his bruised  bones and muscles, to the soreness of those spots in which his skin  had been broken, and to the misery of the thirst which kept his  tongue protruding at one side of his jaws.    Unable to bear these things any longer, Finn turned cautiously  toward the middle of his loathsome prison, and, though his feet  shrank from the task, scraped a hollow place in its midst of about  the bigness of a wash-hand basin. Then, treading as though upon hot  bricks, he squirmed his great body round to avoid touching the  walls of his prison, and sat on his haunches in the hollow he had  made. He was now filled with a desire to inform Tara and the  Master, and, it may be, the rest of the world, about his sorry  plight. But, particularly, he wanted to let the Master and Tara  know about it. And so, seated there in what he had endeavoured to  make the one approachably clean spot available, Finn pointed his  long muzzle toward the stars he could not see, and, opening his  jaws wide, expelled from them the true Irish Wolfhound howl, which  seemed to tear its way outward and upward from the very centre of  the hound's grief-smitten heart, to wind slowly through his lungs  and throat, and to reach the outer air with very much the effect of  a big steamship's syren in a dense fog. It is a very long-drawn  cry, beginning away down in the bass, dragging up slowly to an  anguished treble note in a very minor key, and subsiding,  despairingly, about half-way back to the bass. It is a sound that  carries a very long way--though not so far as from the place of  Finn's captivity to the Sussex Downs--and carries misery with it  just as far as ever it can reach. Upon the hearer who has any  bowels of compassion it falls with a weight of physical appeal  which may not be denied. Above all, it is a strange, mysterious,  uncanny cry, and not a sound which can be ignored. It is a sound to  fetch you hurriedly from your bed at midnight; and that though you  had been sunk in dreamless sleep when first it smote its  irresistible way into your consciousness.    Finn was beginning the bass rumble of his sixth howl when the door  of his prison was flung suddenly open, and he saw Matey, armed with  a hurricane lamp and a short, heavy stick. He was still so new to  the ways of Matey's kind of human, that he thought his howls had  brought him release, and, for an instant, he even had a vision of a  deep basin of cold water, a meal, and a sweet, clean bed, which his  innocent fancy told him Matey might have been engaged in preparing  for him. If he had not been so loath to risk touching the walls of  his prison, his powerful tail would have wagged as the door opened  and the clean night air came in to him. As it was, he leaned  forward to express his gratitude for the opening of the door. And  as he moved forward, delicately, Matey's stick descended on his  nose, with all the weight of Matey's arm and Matey's savage anger  behind it. There was no more sensitive or vulnerable spot in the  whole of Finn's anatomy, physically or morally. The blow was  hideously painful, hideously unexpected, hideously demoralizing. It  robbed Finn of sight, and sense, and self-respect, and forced a  bewildered cry from him which was part bark, part howl, part growl,  and part scream of pain. It planted fear and horror in a single  instant in a creature who had lived in the world for fifteen months  with no consciousness of either. The filth of his prison was  forgotten in this new anguish of pain, and fear, and humiliation,  compared with which the kicks and stranglings of the early part of  the night were as nothing at all. In a few seconds of time the  proudest of princes in the dog world was reduced to a shuddering,  cringing object, cowering in one corner of a filthy cupboard.    Matey was not only furiously angry, he was also a good deal afraid;  and that added cruelty to his anger. He had heard a number of  bedroom windows raised as he crossed the walled-in yard; he wanted  no enquiries about the source and reason of the weird, syren-like  howls that had brought him out in his shirt and trousers. It was  his business to see that there were no more howls; and the only  means that occurred to his brutal mind were those he now proceeded  to put into operation. He closed the door of the den behind him,  and he rained down blows upon Finn's shrinking body till his arm  ached, and the dog's cries subsided into a low, continuous whimper,  the very paralysis of shame, anguish, fear, and distress. Then,  when his arm was thoroughly tired, he flung the stick viciously  into Finn's face, went out, and locked the door.    Matey certainly could not be called a clever dog stealer, because  he had no notion of how to preserve that which he stole. Putting  aside their brutality, his methods were incredibly stupid; but  when, five minutes later, he lay listening in his bed, the only  reflection that his stupid mind brought him was that he had  succeeded admirably. No further sound came from the walled-in yard;  and it appeared that there was to be no further risk of neighbours  being disturbed by howls from Finn. Matey was too far away to hear  anything of the low, tremulous, nasal whimpering which trickled out  into the night through the holes in the door of Finn's prison; and,  in any case, there was no fear of that small sound disturbing any  one. So, after his own fashion--which one really hesitates to call  brutal, because brutes rarely, and probably never, indulge in  pointless, unnecessary ferocity--Matey had been successful.    But if Matey had had sense enough to be called a clever dog-stealer,  he would have recognised that, despite his huge bulk and  strength, Finn was one of the gentlest and most docile of created  things, whose silence and tractability a little child could and  would have brought about with the greatest ease, and without so  much as an angry word. And, so, one has to admit that Matey's  cruelty was like nine-tenths of the other cruelty in the world,  alike among the educated and the uneducated, in that it was due to  ignorance and stupidity.    For a long time Finn was conscious of nothing but fear, and pain,  and misery. He really had been very badly handled, and, though he  knew it not, one of his ribs was broken. After an hour or two, he  became "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30560"],[0,"Music: An Art and a Language (#17)"],[1,"modulatory passage between the first  episode and first return, and a poetic Coda which has, for its closing  measures, the chief motive in augmentation (already referred to on p.  45). To show Schumann's partiality for this form the student may be  referred to Nos. 2 and 8 of the _Kreisleriana_ (op. 16) and to Nos. 1,  2 and 3 of the \"Nachtstuecke\" (op. 23). The third of the _Romances_  (op. 28)--a remarkably free example in the grouping of the material  and in the key-relationship--is cited in the Supplement (No. 37). An  excellent example (readily accessible), popular by reason of its  freedom of treatment, as well as for its inherent sparkle and dash, is  the Finale of Weber's Sonata in C major, op. 24--the so-called _Moto  Perpetuo_. The most famous example of this form in classical  literature is undoubtedly the Finale of Beethoven's _Waldstein  Sonata_, op. 53, with its melodious and easily remembered first  subject, _e.g._    [Music]    [Music]    its two episodes in A minor and C minor (which afford most dramatic  contrasts to the lyric quality of the main subject) and its glorious,  long-extended Coda of about three pages.[79]    [Footnote 77: For a complete account of the historical development see  the article on Form in Grove's Dictionary Vol. II and Hadow's _Sonata  Form_, Chapter IX.]    [Footnote 78: There is an early example in the Rondo of Mozart's  Sonata for Pianoforte in B-flat major.]    [Footnote 79: For a complete detailed analysis of the movement see  Prout, _Applied Forms_, pp. 120-121.]    As stated above, the Older Rondo-Form has not become obsolete; indeed,  by reason of its possibilities for emphasis and contrast it has  commended itself to modern composers. Striking examples may be found  in the Finale of Brahms's Pianoforte Sonata in F minor, in the Finale  of Tchaikowsky's Fourth Symphony and, above all, in the Symphonic  Poems of Strauss, _Don Juan_ and _Till Eulenspiegel_, in which the  form is admirably adapted to the dramatic needs of these descriptive  works. Additional examples, which can be readily procured, are the  Slow Movement of the _Sonata Pathetique_, op. 13, Beethoven's  well-known _Andante in F major_--remarkable for its brilliant  Coda--and his Rondo, already cited, _On the Lost Farthing_. (See  Supplement No. 38). Although there is a certain stiffness in this form  these examples afford the student excellent rudimentary practise in  ease of listening.          CHAPTER VIII    THE VARIATION FORM      Monotony, as previously suggested, is more unendurable in music than  in any of the other arts. We should therefore expect to find musicians  inventing new devices to vary their thoughts so that the interest of  the hearer might be continually sustained and refreshed. Thus there  gradually grew up the form known as the Varied Air--a term meaning the  presentation of the same musical material under different aspects. As  far back as we can trace the development of instrumental structure,  there appears this instinct for varying a simple tune by  embellishments of a rhythmical and melodic nature. Examples abound in  the works of the early Italian masters, in the harpsichord pieces of  the English composers Byrd and Bull[80] and in the music of Couperin  and Rameau. But all these Variations, however interesting from a  historical point[81] of view, are very labored and lack any real  poetic growth. They are, moreover, often prolonged to an interminable  length--one example, as late as Handel, consisting of an Air with  sixty-two Variations; prolixity or \"damnable iteration\" being as bad a  blemish in music as in any of the other arts. In the early days of  instrumental composition, about all that composers could do was \"to  put the theme through its paces.\" That is, there was no unfolding of  the poetic possibilities of the melody. The successive variations were  all in the same key; the harmonic basis was practically unchanged and  the treatment consisted of dressing up the theme with stereotyped  embellishment-figures and of systematic rhythmic animation--produced  by the addition of more and more notes to each time unit. A standard  illustration of this type of Variations is the so-called _Harmonious  Blacksmith_ of Handel from his _Suite in E Major_. This piece owes  whatever popularity it may have preserved to the sturdy swing of the  main theme and to the fact that it makes no demand on the attention of  the most untrained listener. In fairness we should state that on the  harpsichord--with its contrasting stops and key-boards--for which the  piece was composed, there is possible more variety of effect than on  the modern pianoforte.    [Footnote 80: We would cite the piece entitled _Les Buffons_ by Bull,  and Byrd's variations to the popular tune the _Carman's Whistle_,  which latter have considerable archaic charm and distinction; for Byrd  was a real genius. These are readily accessible in popular editions.]    [Footnote 81: Consult the comprehensive article on Variations in  Grove's Dictionary, Vol. V.]    Three collateral early forms deserve a passing mention because,  notwithstanding a certain rigidity of structure, they have been used  by the great masters for the expression of sublime thoughts. These are  the Ground Bass (or, as it is sometimes called, the Basso Ostinato),  the Chaconne and the Passacaglia[82] which, in modern literature, is  well represented by the magnificent \"tour de force\" that serves as the  Finale to Brahms's _Fourth Symphony_. By a Ground Bass is meant a  theme, continually repeated, in the lowest voice, each time with  varied upper parts. An excellent example (see Supplement No. 39) is  the Aria \"When I am laid in earth\" from Purcell's Opera _Dido and  Aeneas_. It is evident that the persistent iteration of a striking  phrase in the bass gives an effect of dramatic intensity, as may be  seen in the sublime \"Crucifixion\" of Bach's _Mass in B minor_.[83]  The Chaconne and Passacaglia are old dance forms (examples of the  former being found in Gluck's Ballet Music) and are closely related to  the Ground Bass; since, in the majority of cases, we find the same  procedure in the announcement of the theme and in its subsequent  treatment. Two examples of the Chaconne from standard literature are  the famous one of Bach in D minor for solo violin and Beethoven's  thirty-two Variations in C minor for Pianoforte. The Passacaglia is of  importance as shown by the striking example for organ in C minor by  Bach on the following theme:    [Music]    Whoever has heard this majestic theme, which seems to bear the sorrows  of the world on its shoulders, announced on the deep-sounding pedals  will gain a lasting impression of the grandeur of Bach's style.    [Footnote 82: For the derivation of the term consult the interesting  article in Grove's Dictionary, Vol. IV.]    [Footnote 83: A work before which Schumann said every musician should  prostrate himself in adoration.]    By the time of Haydn, the technical skill of composers had improved  sufficiently so that we find in his works some genuinely interesting  examples of the Variation form, _e.g._, the set on the well-known  Austrian hymn from the _Kaiser Quartet in C major_--in which each of  the five variations has a real individuality--and the _Variations in F  minor for Pianoforte_: remarkable as an early example of the varied  treatment of _two_ themes.    Most of Mozart's Variations are based upon popular themes and, in  general, may be considered as virtuoso pieces to show off the agility  of the performer. We find occasional examples, as in the Clarinet  Quintette and in the Sonata in D major, which are of more intrinsic  worth.    The genius of Beethoven first revealed the full possibilities of the  form. In fact, so remarkable was his work that such creative composers  as Cesar Franck and d'Indy consider the basic principles for our  modern development of music to be found in the Fugue of Bach and the  Varied Air of Beethoven. For, deadly dull as is the Variation form  when treated in a stereotyped manner, by very reason of its freedom  from arbitrary rules it may be a most elastic medium for the  expression of poetic genius. The composer has but to invent a striking  characteristic theme, rich in potential development, and then to let  it develop for as long as he can retain the interest of his hearers.  Likewise for a great orator the simple rule is to state a theme on  which something worth while may be said and then by presenting it in  new lights and with copious illustrations to drive the truth home. The  principal and significant changes which we owe to Beethoven are the  following: complete freedom in variety of key, so that at times (as in  his op. 34) each variation is in a new key; a frequent omission of the  rigid stops at the end of each variation, _e.g._, the Slow movement of  the _Fifth Symphony_ and the third movement of the _Trio_, op. 96, so  that a continuous flow of thought is preserved; the practice, so often  followed in modern literature, of founding variations on a double  theme--of which the Finale of the _Heroic Symphony_ is a striking  example. But the chief advance in Beethoven is the entirely new  conception of what variations should be; not, according to him, mere  mechanical manipulations of the subject matter, but vital products of  the imagination, as varied as the members of a human family having the  same mother. Beethoven's variations, in fact, often seem like a series  of character-pieces, each with its own individuality and yet retaining  an organic relationship to the main thought. His fondness for the form  and his mastery over it is seen by the frequency of its use in the  last Sonatas and String-Quartets. Every composer since Beethoven has  written one or more works in the Variation form; but we can mention  only the most beautiful examples and then pass on to the daring  conceptions of the modern school.
