(79.) _Varied nature of the food of Sheep._--Sheep will take,  sometimes from choice, sometimes from necessity, to food of a directly  opposite nature to what they have been used. \"The mutton,\" says the  Rev. George Low, writing of Orkney, \"is here in general but ordinary,  owing to the sheep feeding much on sea-ware, to procure which these  creatures show a wonderful sagacity, for no sooner has the tide of ebb  begun to run, but they, though at a great distance, immediately betake  themselves full speed, one and all, to the shore, where they continue  till it begins to flow.\" The sheep of Iceland are content during  severe winters to feed, and be preserved, on messes of chopped  fish-bones, being all that the ingenuity of their masters can provide  in the way of a precarious sustenance. During the long continuance of  snow-storms, when the herbage is beyond the reach of their utmost  efforts, sheep are known to devour the wool on each other's backs,  and, in some instances to acquire a relish for this unnatural food,  which adheres to them through life. This, though on first thoughts  hardly credible, is scarcely more wonderful than the partiality which  cows display, when instigated by the depraved appetites created by  pregnancy, for blankets, and any similar domestic articles which may  be exposed to the gratification of their longings.    The Puruk sheep of Ladusk, in the Himalaya mountains, is, as described  by Mr Moorecraft, in the _Transactions of the Asiatic Society_, in  respect to the varied nature of its food, a most remarkable animal.  \"The Puruk sheep, if permitted, thrusts its head into the cooking pot,  picks up crumbs, is eager to drink the remains of a cup of broth, and  examine the hand of its master for barley, flour, or a cleanly picked  bone, which it disdains not to nibble; a leaf of lettuce, a peeling of  turnip, the skin of the apricot, give a luxury; and the industry is  indefatigable with which this animal detects, and appropriates  substances, so minute and uninviting as would be unseen and neglected  by ordinary sheep; perhaps the dog of the cottager is not so  completely domesticated as it is.\" That Mr Moorecraft is correct in  this statement of its omnivorous propensities, there cannot be the  slightest doubt, as any farmer can testify from what he has seen of  lambs reared by children for amusement. The celebrated John Hunter  showed, that a pigeon might be made to live on flesh, and that its  stomach became adapted to the nature of this food: and I have  somewhere read of a sheep, which, after being long on ship-board, and  accustomed, from scarcity of vegetables, to an animal diet, could  never after be prevailed upon to take to grass. Nor need these  circumstances excite surprise, since the food of every living creature  is, for a certain period at the commencement of existence, limited to  such as is purely animal. But to keep to our subject. Those in the  habit of opening the stomachs of sheep, must have remarked the eroded  appearance which the inner coat occasionally presents. This phenomenon  is owing to the action of the gastric juice, which, if competent to  turn at once from the food with which it is mingled to attack the  texture which has secreted it, will also be, during life, capable of  digesting with tolerable ease, such dead animal matter as may be  brought into contact with it.    In regard to vegetable food, they will, when necessary, devour such as  is even of an acrid nature, and calculated to poison any animals but  themselves. Thunberg, while in Southern Africa, frequently noticed  sheep eating, with impunity, the _Mortimia acris_, the _Rhus lucidum_,  and the _Lycium afrum_, which are all of a poisonous nature; and, in  this country, hemlock is known to be quite innocuous to sheep. What is  poison to one animal often constitutes a wholesome food for others,  and that which will, when given in immediate large doses, destroy an  animal, will, when taken in a gradually-increasing allowance, prove  extremely salutary.    (80.) _Influence of the food on the quality of Mutton._--Diet has a  powerful influence on the constituents of the body. A rank succulent  pasture taints the flesh, or renders it insipid and unpleasant, while  a dry aromatic herbage communicates a delightful flavour, and enables  people versed in the pleasures of the table easily to discriminate  between turnip-fed and grass-fed mutton; and again, between the  latter, and that which has spent its existence on the hills. In  Touchwood's Syllabus of Culinary Lectures, appended to the _Cook and  Housewive's Manual_, by Mistress Dods, we are briefly informed, that  \"the black-faced, or short-sheep, are best for the table, though _more  depends on the pasture than the breed_.\" More, in fact, depending on  feeding and management, than on the variety of the animal, though this  of course is not to be neglected. A notion has been advanced in this  country, that artificial pastures are less nutritious than natural  ones, and that the animals which are raised upon them are,  consequently, of a laxer fibre, and the flesh less wholesome, as well  as less savoury. This, I have no doubt, is perfectly correct, as many  _diseases_ may be traced to such improper food, and what is calculated  to produce in some cases actual disease, cannot fail to prove at all  times capable of retarding the advancement of the animal. These soft  succulent pastures appear not to be positively poisonous, but to be  negatively so from their deficiency in saline matter; the rapid growth  of the plant preventing the elimination and absorption, of many of  these ingredients with which the soil abounds. This is proved by the  greater necessity which exists for the use of salt in the food of the  herbivorous animals of hot climates, than in that of such as inhabit  temperate, or cold latitudes; vegetation being in the former more  rapid in its details, and in certain states of the atmosphere hurried  in the extreme, while in the latter the process proceeds with that  leisure which enables the plant to make good the measure of its  constituents, as it increases in size. In many parts of North America  it is well known, that, at certain seasons, the wild animals make  eagerly for the salt _licks_; and, following up this hint, the  settlers easily induce their oxen to keep near their dwellings, by  serving them periodically with salt. When the wild cattle of South  America had greatly increased, it was discovered that they could not  exist unless they had access to streams which had acquired brackish  particles from the soil. _If salt, in places devoid of it, was not  furnished to them by man, they became stunted, unfruitful, and the  herds soon disappeared._ Even in this country, the free use of salt is  found to be highly beneficial to our domestic animals, preventing the  occurrence of many of those diseases which are otherwise sure to  follow the use of food such as is mentioned above, and ensuring that  sound health which is so conducive to the accumulation of fat.    (81.) _Differences in the quality of Mutton._--I shall now enter a  little into the manner in which the _quality_ of the flesh may be  affected, and the methods of judging of the different states or  conditions, in which it may be found under various circumstances;  premising that it requires much experience, to enable a person to  pronounce with confidence, as to the value of the muscular parts, from  the inspection of a living animal:--The flesh of different specimens  of the same animal, varies not so much from breed or descent, as from  age, feeding, and exercise. That of the young is soft and gelatinous,  the fibres being small, weak, and much interspersed with a substance  termed, from its loose appearance, cellular tissue. This tissue  exhibits in the spaces between the muscles (_layers of flesh_) small  masses of delicate fat. The greater bulk of the latter is situated  immediately beneath the skin, and occasions that beautiful rotundity  so much admired in children. As the animal advances in life, the  fibres become firmer, larger, and more approximated, the cellular  tissue disappears to a great extent, the fat shifts from the outward  to the inward parts, allowing the outline of the muscles to be  distinctly seen, but giving at the same time to the figure that portly  symptom of good keeping, so unpleasant to the eye when carried to the  extent of Aldermanic dignity. All these appearances are, however,  varied by exercise, which tends, in a marked degree, to increase the  muscular parts at the expense of the fat--the former becoming, when  employed within proper limits, large, and unyielding to the touch,  while at the same time the colour is heightened from a pale or purple  hue, to the bright vermilion so justly relied upon by housewives, as a  guarantee for the superior qualities of the article. The wild horses  in South America, which form the principal part of Indian diet, are  said by these epicures to be much improved for the table by gentle  labour, and to be quite on a par when thus cared for, with some of our  best beef. This plan is, however, only pursued for the purpose of  rendering the flesh of their horses moderately firm; but where an  opposite effect is desired it is readily, though cruelly, produced by  putting the animal to a lingering death; examples of which practice  are to be met with in the annals of most civilized nations; as in the  German mode of whipping pigs, and the English custom of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3819"],[0,"The Euahlayi Tribe: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia (#17)"],[1," to  the edge of the ring. At this stage men often tried to steal each  other's boys, and great wrestling matches came off. One man would try  to pull up the mudgee, out would rush one of another clan to wrestle  with him. First the boys would wrestle, then the elder men, each  determined his clan should prove victorious at this great Boorah  wrestling.    The skill of the eeramooun, or uninitiated boys, would be tried in sham  fights too. They were given bark shields, and their attackers had bark  boomerangs; great was the applause when the boys ably defended  themselves. Previously they have been tried with boomerang and boodthul  throwing, and other arts of sport and warfare, boys of each tribe  trying to excel those of the others. If a boy comes well out of these  trials the men say he is worthy to be a yelgidyi, or fully initiated  young man.    When the wrestling and sham fights are over, corroborees begin. All  night they are kept up, and sometimes there are day performances too.          CHAPTER IX    THE BOORAH AND OTHER MEETINGS      At last would come the night when everything was ready. Sports and  corroborees would be held as usual, until, at a given signal, the  younger women were ordered into bough sheds which were round the ring.    The old women stayed on singing.    The boys, who are painted red, are beckoned into the middle of the  ring, where their respective Munthdeeguns daub them with white. That  done, each man seizing his charge, hoists him on to his shoulder, and  dances round the ring with him. Then the old women are told to bid the  boys good-bye.    Forward they come, singing each her own brumboorah, for every oldest  woman relation of each of the boys makes a song for him. They  corroboree a few steps behind the men, chanting a farewell, then  corroboree back a few steps, then hasten to join the younger women in  the bough sheds, which are now pulled down on top of them by the men,  that they may see nothing further. Then the Munthdeeguns disappear down  the track into the scrub.    When they are out of sight the women are released, that they may get  ready to travel to where the Durrawunga, or Little Boorah, will be held  in about four days' time, at about ten miles distance.    As the Munthdeeguns passed their totem-marked trees, or images, which  would be those of the boys in their charge--for each guardian was a  relation of the same totem as his charge--they would perform some  magical feat, such as producing gubberahs, charcoal, gypsum, and so on,  uttering as they did so a little chant about that totem.    The boy's eyes are closed all this time and his head bent down.    Boys at a Boorah always remind me of WILHELM MEISLER'S TRAVELS, where,  at the school to which Wilhelm takes Felix, he learns, on inquiry as to  the three attitudes assumed by the pupils, that these gestures  inculcate veneration, which also seems to be the keynote of the  eeramooun's instruction. The Boorah over, he too, 'Stands erect and  bold, yet not selfishly isolated; only in an union with his equals (his  fellow initiates) does he present a front towards the world.'    And only when the fear, the abasement, is gone does the true reverence  come, which makes the most primitive creed a living religion.    As the Munthdeeguns pass the sacred fire they throw in a weapon each.  This done they place their charges in slightly scooped-out places,  already prepared in the inner ring.    Then they bid them, on pain of death, not to look up whatever happens.    Soon a great whirring is heard, telling that Gayandi, the Boorah  spirit, is near.    Yudtha Dulleebah, one of the oldest black men in the district, said at  this stage once two boys did look up.    The wirreenuns saw them, though the boys did not know it and went on  looking. These boys saw the men advance each to the fire where they had  thrown their weapons; chanting in a strange tongue, they corroboreed  round the fire for some time.    Then the wirreenuns snatched up the coals left from the weapons and  rubbed them into their limbs, trampling as they did so on the edge of  the fire, which did not seem to burn them, rubbing and chanting until  the sacred coals were supposed to be absorbed by them, from which they  would derive new powers.    This over, the boys were all ordered to get up, and march round, hands  on thighs and heads abased, while they learnt a Boorah song, giving new  words for common things, which acted as pass-words hereafter for the  initiated. Into a slow chant these words were strung, as the men and  boys passed round the ring, two of the oldest men standing beating time  with painted spears with tufted tops.    The two boys who had transgressed before looked up again, curious as to  their surroundings. Suddenly the men with the spears roared at the boys  to lower their heads.    The boys laughed. Their fates were sealed. Out flashed the sacred  gubberahs of these two old men.    'Dead is he,' they cried, 'who laughs in the Bunbul where yungawee  burns more fiercely than Yirangal, the sun, where near lies the image  of Byamee: Byamee, father of all, whose laws the tribes are now  obeying.' Then the men chanted to the gubberahs and held them between  the fires and the boys, the light of the flames seemed to play on them  and stretch its beams to the boys, who began to tremble. As louder grew  the chant an answer came from the scrub, the voice of Gayandi; shaking  with fear the boys fell to the ground, to all appearance lifeless. Then  the old men went forward, each with a stone knife in hand. Stooping  over the two boys they opened veins in each, out flowed the blood, and  the other men all raised a death cry. The boys were lifeless. The old  wirreenuns, dipping their stone knives in the blood, touched with them  the lips of all present. Then the bodies were put on the edge of the  sacred fire and the other initiates taken a little further into the  scrub. There they were tried in many ways.    With the Boorah spirits whistling and whizzing all round them, spears  were pointed at them. Their skins were scratched with stone knives and  mussel shells. Hideously painted, fiendish-looking creatures suddenly  rushed upon them. Should they show fear and quail at the Little Boorah  they would be returned to their mothers as cowards unfit for  initiation, and sooner or later sympathetic magic would do its work, a  poison-stick or bone would end them. Or if one of the initiates was  considered stupid and generally incapable, having been brought to the  Boorah for that purpose, he was now, after having been made to suffer  all sorts of indignities, such as eating filth and so on, bound to the  earth, strapped down, killed, and his body burnt.    When the trials were over and the old wirreenuns said to the boys who  had not quailed, 'You are brave; you shall be boorahbayyi first and  afterwards yelgidyi, and carry the marks that all may know.'    Then they made on the shoulder of each boy a round hole with a pointed  stone; this hole they licked to feel no splinter of stone remained,  then filled it with powdered charcoal.    After this, leaving the boys there, the men went back to the Bunbul  ring. The bodies of the Boorah victims were cooked. Each man who had  been to five Boorahs ate a piece of this flesh, no others were allowed  even to see this done. Then the bones and what was left of the bodies  were put into the middle of the fire, and all traces of the victims so  destroyed.    The men then sang a song, saying that so must always be served those  who scoffed at sacred things; that the strength they had wasted should  go into other men who would use it better; while the spirits of the  victims should wander about until reincarnated if the Boorah spirit  gave them another chance. Perhaps he would only let them be  reincarnated in animals.    After another dance and chant round the yungawee, the men went and  brought the boys back again. They came with their hands on their  thighs, and their heads abased; each was taken to his allotted place  near the outer edge of the ring. There each Munthdeegun told his boy he  could sleep that night; he would go to sleep the boy he had been, to  wake in the morning a new man; his courage had now been tried, and in  the morning a new name and a sacred stone would be given to him. The  Gayandi would settle their names that night and tell the wirreenuns.    The next morning the boys were awakened by the Munthdeegun chanting and  dancing before them. They stopped in front of the first boy, called him  to rise by a new name; as he did so all the men clapped their thighs  and shouted    'Wah! wah! wah!'    Then an old wirreenun gave him a small white gubberah, which he was  bidden to keep concealed for ever from the uninitiated and the women,  and he must be ready to produce it whenever called upon to do so. The  result of failure would be fatal to him. With the loss of the stone his  life spirit would be weakened, and the strength of the Boorah spirit,  with which he was now endowed, be used against him instead of for him,  as would be the case as long as he kept the stone.    These stones seem somewhat in the way of 'Baetyli' of pagan antiquity,  which were of round form; they were supposed to be animated, by means  of magical incantations, with a portion of the Deity; they were  consulted on occasions of great and pressing emergency as a kind of  divine oracle, and were suspended either round the neck or some other  part of the body.    As each boy received his stone another loud chorus of 'Wah! wah! wah!'  went up from that crowd, making the scrub ring with the sound.    Some of those, of whose tribe it was the custom--it is not invariably  so--now had a front tooth knocked off; this done a wirreenun chanted to  the boy, who had been blindfolded and almost deafened by the whirring  of Gayandi.    One chant was as follows:--      Now you can meet the Boorah spirit,    Now will he harm you not.    He "]]]
