Every second man we met  wanted to run us a mile for 100 pounds a side; and a drunken shearer,  spoiling for a fight, said he had heard we were \"brimming over with  bally science\", and had ridden forty miles to find out.    We didn't wait for the hack race. We folded our tents like the Arab  and stole away. But it remains on the annals of Buckatowndown how a  kangaroo-dog ran second for the Town Plate.          CONCERNING A DOG-FIGHT      Dog-fighting as a sport is not much in vogue now-a-days. To begin with  it is illegal. Not that _that_ matters much, for Sunday drinking is also  illegal. But dog-fighting is one of the cruel sports which the  community has decided to put down with all the force of public opinion.  Nevertheless, a certain amount of it is still carried on near Sydney,  and very neatly and scientifically carried on, too--principally by  gentlemen who live out Botany way and do not care for public opinion.    The grey dawn was just breaking over Botany when we got to the  meeting-place. Away to the East the stars were paling in the faint flush  of coming dawn, and over the sandhills came the boom of breakers. It was  Sunday morning, and all the respectable, non-dog-fighting population of  that odoriferous suburb were sleeping their heavy, Sunday-morning  sleep. Some few people, however, were astir. In the dim light hurried  pedestrians plodded along the heavy road towards the sandhills. Now and  then a van, laden with ten or eleven of \"the talent\", and drawn by a  horse that cost fifteen shillings at auction, rolled softly along in the  same direction. These were dog-fighters who had got \"the office\", and  knew exactly where the match was to take place.    The \"meet\" was on a main road, about half-a-mile from town; here some  two hundred people had assembled, and hung up their horses and vehicles  to the fence without the slightest concealment. They said the police  would not interfere with them--and they did not seem a nice crowd to  interfere with.    One dog was on the ground when we arrived, having come out in a hansom  cab with his trainer. He was a white bull-terrier, weighing about forty  pounds, \"trained to the hour\", with the muscles standing out all over  him. He waited in the cab, licking his trainer's face at intervals to  reassure that individual of his protection and support; the rest of the  time he glowered out of the cab and eyed the public scornfully. He knew  as well as any human being that there was sport afoot, and looked about  eagerly and wickedly to see what he could get his teeth into.    Soon a messenger came running up to know whether they meant to sit in  the cab till the police came; the other dog, he said, had arrived and  all was ready. The trainer and dog got out of the cab; we followed them  through a fence and over a rise--and there, about twenty yards from  the main road, was a neatly-pitched enclosure like a prize-ring, a  thirty-foot-square enclosure formed with stakes and ropes. About a  hundred people were at the ringside, and in the far corner, in the arms  of his trainer, was the other dog--a brindle.    It was wonderful to see the two dogs when they caught sight of each  other. The white dog came up to the ring straining at his leash, nearly  dragging his trainer off his feet in his efforts to get at the enemy. At  intervals he emitted a hoarse roar of challenge and defiance.    The brindled dog never uttered a sound. He fixed his eyes on his  adversary with a look of intense hunger, of absolute yearning for  combat. He never for an instant shifted his unwinking gaze. He seemed  like an animal who saw the hopes of years about to be realised. With  painful earnestness he watched every detail of the other dog's toilet;  and while the white dog was making fierce efforts to get at him, he  stood Napoleonic, grand in his courage, waiting for the fray.    All details were carefully attended to, and all rules strictly  observed. People may think a dog-fight is a go-as-you-please outbreak of  lawlessness, but there are rules and regulations--simple, but effective.  There were two umpires, a referee, a timekeeper, and two seconds for  each dog. The stakes were said to be ten pounds a-side. After some talk,  the dogs were carried to the centre of the ring by their seconds and put  on the ground. Like a flash of lightning they dashed at each other, and  the fight began.    Nearly everyone has seen dogs fight--\"it is their nature to\", as Dr.  Watts put it. But an ordinary worry between (say) a retriever and a  collie, terminating as soon as one or other gets his ear bitten, gives  a very faint idea of a real dog-fight. But bull-terriers are the  gladiators of the canine race. Bred and trained to fight, carefully  exercised and dieted for weeks beforehand, they come to the fray  exulting in their strength and determined to win. Each is trained to  fight for certain holds, a grip of the ear or the back of the neck being  of very slight importance. The foot is a favourite hold, the throat is,  of course, fashionable--if they can get it.    The white and the brindle sparred and wrestled and gripped and threw  each other, fighting grimly, and disdaining to utter a sound. Their  seconds dodged round them unceasingly, giving them encouragement and  advice--\"That's the style, Boxer--fight for his foot\"--\"Draw your foot  back, old man,\" and so on. Now and again one dog got a grip of the  other's foot and chewed savagely, and the spectators danced with  excitement. The moment the dogs let each other go they were snatched up  by their seconds and carried to their corners, and a minute's time was  allowed, in which their mouths were washed out and a cloth rubbed over  their bodies.    Then came the ceremony of \"coming to scratch\". When time was called for  the second round the brindled dog was let loose in his own corner, and  was required by the rules to go across the ring of his own free will and  attack the other dog. If he failed to do this he would lose the fight.  The white dog, meanwhile, was held in his corner waiting the attack.  After the next round it was the white dog's turn to make the attack, and  so on alternately. The animals need not fight a moment longer than they  chose, as either dog could abandon the fight by failing to attack his  enemy.    While their condition lasted they used to dash across the ring at  full run; but, after a while, when the punishment got severe and their  \"fitness\" began to fail, it became a very exciting question whether or  not a dog would \"come to scratch\". The brindled dog's condition was not  so good as the other's. He used to lie on his stomach between the rounds  to rest himself, and several times it looked as if he would not cross  the ring when his turn came. But as soon as time was called he would  start to his feet and limp slowly across glaring steadily at his  adversary; then, as he got nearer, he would quicken his pace, make a  savage rush, and in a moment they would be locked in combat. So they  battled on for fifty-six minutes, till the white dog (who was apparently  having all the best of it), on being called to cross the ring, only went  half-way across and stood there for a minute growling savagely. So he  lost the fight.    No doubt it was a brutal exhibition. But it was not cruel to the animals  in the same sense that pigeon-shooting or hare-hunting is cruel. The  dogs are born fighters, anxious and eager to fight, desiring nothing  better. Whatever limited intelligence they have is all directed to  this one consuming passion. They could stop when they liked, but anyone  looking on could see that they gloried in the combat. Fighting is like  breath to them--they must have it. Nature has implanted in all animals a  fighting instinct for the weeding out of the physically unfit, and these  dogs have an extra share of that fighting instinct.    Of course, now that militarism is going to be abolished, and the  world is going to be so good and teetotal, and only fight in debating  societies, these nasty savage animals will be out of date. We will not  be allowed to keep anything more quarrelsome than a poodle--and a man  of the future, the New Man, whose fighting instincts have not been  quite bred out of him, will, perhaps, be found at grey dawn of a Sunday  morning with a crowd of other unregenerates in some backyard frantically  cheering two of them to mortal combat.          HIS MASTERPIECE      Greenhide Billy was a stockman on a Clarence River cattle-station, and  admittedly the biggest liar in the district. He had been for many years  pioneering in the Northern Territory, the other side of the sun-down--a  regular \"furthest-out man\"--and this assured his reputation among  station-hands who award rank according to amount of experience.    Young men who have always hung around the home districts, doing a job of  shearing here or a turn at horse-breaking there, look with reverence  on Riverine or Macquarie-River shearers who come in with tales of runs  where they have 300,000 acres of freehold land and shear 250,000  sheep; these again pale their ineffectual fires before the glory of the  Northern Territory man who has all-comers on toast, because no one can  contradict him or check his figures. When two of them meet, however,  they are not fools enough to cut down quotations and spoil the market;  they lie in support of each other, and make all other bushmen feel mean  and pitiful and inexperienced.    Sometimes a youngster would timidly ask Greenhide Billy about the  'terra incognita': \"What sort of a place is it, Billy--how big are the  properties? How many acres had you in the place you were on?\"    \"Acres be d----d!\" Billy would scornfully reply; \"hear him talking  about acres! D'ye think we were blanked cockatoo selectors! Out there we  reckon country by the hundred miles. You orter say, 'How many thousand  miles of country?'

[Illustration: Fig. VII.]    Fig. VII. representing a moulding with an outer and inner curve, the  latter undercut. Take the outer line, and this moulding is one constant  in Venice, in architecture traceable to Arabian types, and chiefly to  the early mosques of Cairo. But take the inner line; it is a dripstone  at Salisbury. In that narrow interval between the curves there is, when  we read it rightly, an expression of another and mightier curve,--the  orbed sweep of the earth and sea, between the desert of the Pyramids,  and the green and level fields through which the clear streams of Sarum  wind so slowly.    [Illustration: Fig. VIII.]    And so delicate is the test, that though pure cornices are often found  in the north,--borrowed from classical models,--so surely as we find a  true dripstone moulding in the South, the influence of Northern builders  has been at work; and this will be one of the principal evidences which  I shall use in detecting Lombard influence on Arab work; for the true  Byzantine and Arab mouldings are all open to the sky and light, but the  Lombards brought with them from the North the fear of rain, and in all  the Lombardic Gothic we instantly recognize the shadowy dripstone: _a_,  Fig. VIII., is from a noble fragment at Milan, in the Piazza dei  Mercanti; _b_, from the Broletto of Como. Compare them with _c_ and  _d_; both from Salisbury; _e_ and _f_ from Lisieux, Normandy; _g_ and  _h_ from Wenlock Abbey, Shropshire.    Sec. X. The reader is now master of all that he need know about the  construction of the general wall cornice, fitted either to become a  crown of the wall, or to carry weight above. If, however, the weight  above become considerable, it may be necessary to support the cornice at  intervals with brackets; especially if it be required to project far, as  well as to carry weight; as, for instance, if there be a gallery on top  of the wall. This kind of bracket-cornice, deep or shallow, forms a  separate family, essentially connected with roofs and galleries; for if  there be no superincumbent weight, it is evidently absurd to put  brackets to a plain cornice or dripstone (though this is sometimes done  in carrying out a style); so that, as soon as we see a bracket put to a  cornice, it implies, or should imply, that there is a roof or gallery  above it. Hence this family of cornices I shall consider in connection  with roofing, calling them \"roof cornices,\" while what we have hitherto  examined are proper \"wall cornices.\" The roof cornice and wall cornice  are therefore treated in division D.    We are not, however, as yet nearly ready for our roof. We have only  obtained that which was to be the object of our first division (A); we  have got, that is to say, a general idea of a wall and of the three  essential parts of a wall; and we have next, it will be remembered, to  get an idea of a pier and the essential parts of a pier, which were to  be the subjects of our second division (B).          CHAPTER VII.      THE PIER BASE.      Sec. I. In Sec. III. of Chap. III., it was stated that when a wall had to  sustain an addition of vertical pressure, it was first fitted to sustain  it by some addition to its own thickness; but if the pressure became  very great, by being gathered up into PIERS.    I must first make the reader understand what I mean by a wall's being  gathered up. Take a piece of tolerably thick drawing-paper, or thin  Bristol board, five or six inches square. Set it on its edge on the  table, and put a small octavo book on the edge or top of it, and it will  bend instantly. Tear it into four strips all across, and roll up each  strip tightly. Set these rolls on end on the table, and they will carry  the small octavo perfectly well. Now the thickness or substance of the  paper employed to carry the weight is exactly the same as it was before,  only it is differently arranged, that is to say, \"gathered up.\"[35] If  therefore a wall be gathered up like the Bristol board, it will bear  greater weight than it would if it remained a wall veil. The sticks into  which you gather it are called _Piers_. A pier is a coagulated wall.    Sec. II. Now you cannot quite treat the wall as you did the Bristol board,  and twist it up at once; but let us see how you _can_ treat it. Let A,  Fig. IX., be the plan of a wall which you have made inconveniently and  expensively thick, and which still appears to be slightly too weak for  what it must carry: divide it, as at B, into equal spaces, _a_, _b_,  _a_, _b_, &c. Cut out a thin slice of it at every _a_ on each side, and  put the slices you cut out on at every _b_ on each side, and you will  have the plan at B, with exactly the same quantity of bricks. But your  wall is now so much concentrated, that, if it was only slightly too weak  before, it will be stronger now than it need be; so you may spare some  of your space as well as your bricks by cutting off the corners of the  thicker parts, as suppose _c_, _c_, _c_, _c_, at C: and you have now a  series of square piers connected by a wall veil, which, on less space  and with less materials, will do the work of the wall at A perfectly  well.    [Illustration: Fig. IX.]    Sec. III. I do not say _how much_ may be cut away in the corners _c_,  _c_,--that is a mathematical question with which we need not trouble  ourselves: all that we need know is, that out of every slice we take  from the \"_b_'s\" and put on at the \"_a_'s,\" we may keep a certain  percentage of room and bricks, until, supposing that we do not want the  wall veil for its own sake, this latter is thinned entirely away, like  the girdle of the Lady of Avenel, and finally breaks, and we have  nothing but a row of square piers, D.    Sec. IV. But have we yet arrived at the form which will spare most room,  and use fewest materials. No; and to get farther we must apply the  general principle to our wall, which is equally true in morals and  mathematics, that the strength of materials, or of men, or of minds, is  always most available when it is applied as closely as possible to a  single point.    Let the point to which we wish the strength of our square piers to be  applied, be chosen. Then we shall of course put them directly under it,  and the point will be in their centre. But now some of their materials  are not so near or close to this point as others. Those at the corners  are farther off than the rest.    Now, if every particle of the pier be brought as near as possible to the  centre of it, the form it assumes is the circle.    The circle must be, therefore, the best possible form of plan for a  pier, from the beginning of time to the end of it. A circular pier is  called a pillar or column, and all good architecture adapted to vertical  support is made up of pillars, has always been so, and must ever be so,  as long as the laws of the universe hold.    The final condition is represented at E, in its relation to that at D.  It will be observed that though each circle projects a little beyond the  side of the square out of which it is formed, the space cut off at the  angles is greater than that added at the sides; for, having our  materials in a more concentrated arrangement, we can afford to part with  some of them in this last transformation, as in all the rest.    Sec. V. And now, what have the base and the cornice of the wall been doing  while we have been cutting the veil to pieces and gathering it together?    The base is also cut to pieces, gathered together, and becomes the base  of the column.    The cornice is cut to pieces, gathered together, and becomes the capital  of the column. Do not be alarmed at the new word, it does not mean a new  thing; a capital is only the cornice of a column, and you may, if you  like, call a cornice the capital of a wall.    We have now, therefore, to examine these three concentrated forms of the  base, veil, and cornice: first, the concentrated base, still called the  BASE of the column; then the concentrated veil, called the SHAFT of the  column; then the concentrated cornice, called the CAPITAL of the column.    And first the Base:--    [Illustration: Fig. X.]    Sec. VI. Look back to the main type, Fig. II., page 55, and apply its  profiles in due proportion to the feet of the pillars at E in Fig. IX.  p. 72: If each step in Fig. II. were gathered accurately, the projection  of the entire circular base would be less in proportion to its height  than it is in Fig. II.; but the approximation to the result in Fig. X.  is quite accurate enough for our purposes. (I pray the reader to observe  that I have not made the smallest change, except this necessary  expression of a reduction in diameter, in Fig. II. as it is applied in  Fig. X., only I have not drawn the joints of the stones because these  would confuse the outlines of the bases; and I have not represented the  rounding of the shafts, because it does not bear at present on the  argument.) Now it would hardly be convenient, if we had to pass between  the pillars, to have to squeeze ourselves through one of those angular  gaps or breches de Roland in Fig. X. Our first impulse would be to cut  them open; but we cannot do this, or our piers are unsafe. We have but  one other resource, to fill them up until we have a floor wide enough to  let us pass easily: this we may perhaps obtain at the first ledge, we  are nearly sure to get it at the second, and we may then obtain access  to the raised interval, either by raising the earth over the lower  courses of foundation, or by steps round the entire building.    Fig. XI. is the arrangement of Fig. X. so treated.    [Illustration: Fig. XI.]    Sec. VII. But suppose the pillars are so vast that the lowest chink in  Fig. X. would be quite wide enough to let us pass through it. Is there  then any reason for filling it up? Yes. It will be remembered that in  Chap. IV. Sec. VIII. the chief reason for the wide foundation of the  wall was"]]]
