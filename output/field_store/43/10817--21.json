The Japanese themselves  testified that these two ships never lost their formation, and that  when her sister ironclad was closely pressed the _Chen Yuen_, by her  movements and gun practice, protected the _Ting Yuen_, and, in fact,  while she could not prevent the heavy loss the fleet encountered,  preserved it from annihilation. During the fight this ship was almost  continuously on fire, and was struck by every kind of projectile, from  the thirteen-inch Canet shells to a rifle bullet, four hundred times.  McGiffin himself was so badly wounded, so beaten about by concussions,  so burned, and so bruised by steel splinters, that his health and  eyesight were forever wrecked. But he brought the _Chen Yuen_ safely  into Port Arthur and the remnants of the fleet with her.    On account of his lack of health he resigned from the Chinese service  and returned to America. For two years he lived in New York City,  suffering in body without cessation the most exquisite torture. During  that time his letters to his family show only tremendous courage. On the  splintered, gaping deck of the _Chen Yuen_, with the fires below it,  and the shells bursting upon it, he had shown to his Chinese crew the  courage of the white man who knew he was responsible for them and for  the honor of their country. But far greater and more difficult was the  courage he showed while alone in the dark sick-room, and in the private  wards of the hospitals.    In the letters he dictates from there he still is concerned only lest  those at home shall \"worry\"; he reassures them with falsehoods, jokes  at their fears; of the people he can see from the window of the hospital  tells them foolish stories; for a little boy who has been kind he asks  them to send him his Chinese postage stamps; he plans a trip he will  take with them when he is stronger, knowing he never will be stronger.  The doctors had urged upon him a certain operation, and of it to a  friend he wrote: \"I know that I will have to have a piece about three  inches square cut out of my skull, and this nerve cut off near the  middle of the brain, as well as my eye taken out (for a couple of hours  only, provided it is not mislaid, and can be found). Doctor ------ and  his crowd show a bad memory for failures. As a result of this operation  others have told me--I forget the percentage of deaths, which does not  matter, but--that a large percentage have become insane. And some lost  their sight.\"    While threatened with insanity and complete blindness, and hourly from  his wounds suffering a pain drugs could not master, he dictated for the  _Century Magazine_ the only complete account of the battle of the Yalu.  In a letter to Mr. Richard Watson Gilder he writes: \"...my eyes are  troubling me. I cannot see even what I am writing now, and am getting  the article under difficulties. I yet hope to place it in your hands by  the 21st, still, if my eyes grow worse------\"    \"Still, if my eyes grow worse------\"    The unfinished sentence was grimly prophetic.    Unknown to his attendants at the hospital, among the papers in his  despatch-box he had secreted his service revolver. On the morning of the  11th of February, 1897, he asked for this box, and on some pretext sent  the nurse from the room. When the report of the pistol brought them  running to his bedside, they found the pain-driven body at peace, and  the tired eyes dark forever.    In the article in the _Century_ on the battle of the Yalu, he had said:    \"Chief among those who have died for their country is Admiral Ting Ju  Chang, a gallant soldier and true gentleman. Betrayed by his countrymen,  fighting against odds, almost his last official act was to stipulate  for the lives of his officers and men. His own he scorned to save, well  knowing that his ungrateful country would prove less merciful than his  honorable foe. Bitter, indeed, must have been the reflections of the  old, wounded hero, in that midnight hour, as he drank the poisoned cup  that was to give him rest.\"    And bitter indeed must have been the reflections of the young wounded  American, robbed, by the parsimony of his country, of the right he had  earned to serve it, and who was driven out to give his best years and  his life for a strange people under a strange flag.          GENERAL WILLIAM WALKER,    THE KING OF THE FILIBUSTERS    IT is safe to say that to members of the younger generation the name of  William Walker conveys absolutely nothing. To them, as a name, \"William  Walker\" awakens no pride of race or country. It certainly does not  suggest poetry and adventure. To obtain a place in even this group  of Soldiers of Fortune, William Walker, the most distinguished of all  American Soldiers of Fortune, the one who but for his own countrymen  would have single-handed attained the most far-reaching results, had to  wait his turn behind adventurers of other lands and boy officers of  his own. And yet had this man with the plain name, the name that  to-day means nothing, accomplished what he adventured, he would on this  continent have solved the problem of slavery, have established an empire  in Mexico and in Central America, and, incidentally, have brought us  into war with all of Europe. That is all he would have accomplished.    In the days of gold in San Francisco among the \"Forty-niners\" William  Walker was one of the most famous, most picturesque and popular figures.  Jack Oakhurst, gambler; Colonel Starbottle, duellist; Yuba Bill,  stage-coach driver, were his contemporaries. Bret Harte was one of his  keenest admirers, and in two of his stories, thinly disguised under a  more appealing name, Walker is the hero. When, later, Walker came to New  York City, in his honor Broadway from the Battery to Madison Square was  bedecked with flags and arches. \"It was roses, roses all the way.\" The  house-tops rocked and swayed.    In New Orleans, where in a box at the opera he made his first  appearance, for ten minutes the performance came to a pause, while the  audience stood to salute him.    This happened less than fifty years ago, and there are men who as boys  were out with \"Walker of Nicaragua,\" and who are still active in the  public life of San Francisco and New York.    Walker was born in 1824, in Nashville, Tenn. He was the oldest son of  a Scotch banker, a man of a deeply religious mind, and interested in  a business which certainly is removed, as far as possible, from  the profession of arms. Indeed, few men better than William Walker  illustrate the fact that great generals are born, not trained.  Everything in Walker's birth, family tradition, and education pointed  to his becoming a member of one of the \"learned\" professions. It was  the wish of his father that he should be a minister of the Presbyterian  Church, and as a child he was trained with that end in view. He himself  preferred to study medicine, and after graduating at the University of  Tennessee, at Edinburgh he followed a course of lectures, and for two  years travelled in Europe, visiting many of the great hospitals.    Then having thoroughly equipped himself to practise as a physician,  after a brief return to his native city, and as short a stay in  Philadelphia, he took down his shingle forever, and proceeded to  New Orleans to study law. In two years he was admitted to the bar of  Louisiana. But because clients were few, or because the red tape of the  law chafed his spirit, within a year, as already he had abandoned  the Church and Medicine, he abandoned his law practice and became  an editorial writer on the New Orleans _Crescent_. A year later the  restlessness which had rebelled against the grave professions led him to  the gold fields of California, and San Francisco. There, in 1852, at  the age of only twenty-eight, as editor of the San Francisco _Herald_,  Walker began his real life which so soon was to end in both disaster and  glory.    Up to his twenty-eighth year, except in his restlessness, nothing in his  life foreshadowed what was to follow. Nothing pointed to him as a man  for whom thousands of other men, from every capital of the world, would  give up their lives.    Negatively, by abandoning three separate callings, and in making it  plain that a professional career did not appeal to him, Walker had  thrown a certain sidelight on his character; but actively he never had  given any hint that under the thoughtful brow of the young doctor and  lawyer there was a mind evolving schemes of empire, and an ambition  limited only by the two great oceans.    Walker's first adventure was undoubtedly inspired by and in imitation  of one which at the time of his arrival in San Francisco had just been  brought to a disastrous end. This was the De Boulbon expedition into  Mexico. The Count Gaston Raoulx de Raousset-Boulbon was a young French  nobleman and Soldier of Fortune, a _chasseur d'Afrique_, a duellist,  journalist, dreamer, who came to California to dig gold. Baron  Harden-Hickey, who was born in San Francisco a few years after Boulbon  at the age of thirty was shot in Mexico, also was inspired to dreams of  conquest by this same gentleman adventurer.    Boulbon was a young man of large ideas. In the rapid growth of  California he saw a threat to Mexico and proposed to that government, as  a \"buffer\" state between the two republics, to form a French colony  in the Mexican State of Sonora. Sonora is that part of Mexico which  directly joins on the south with our State of Arizona. The President of  Mexico gave Boulbon permission to attempt this, and in 1852 he landed at  Guaymas in the Gulf of California with two hundred and sixty well-armed  Frenchmen. The ostensible excuse of Boulbon for thus invading foreign  soil was his contract with the President under which his \"emigrants\"  were hired to protect other foreigners working in the \"Re"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3031"],[0,"Wild Animals I Have Known (#17)"],[1," was helping himself to a warm drink.    On my going out she fled into the dark woods, but there by the  shelter-box were two little mice, bloody and still warm, food for the  cub brought by the devoted mother. And in the morning I found the chain  was very bright for a foot or two next the little one's collar.    On walking across the woods to the ruined den, I again found signs of  Vixen. The poor heart-broken mother had come and dug out the bedraggled  bodies of her little ones.    There lay the three little baby foxes all licked smooth now, and by them  were two of our hens fresh killed. The newly heaved earth was printed  all over with telltale signs--signs that told me that here by the side  of her dead she had watched like Rizpah. Here she had brought their  usual meal, the spoil of her nightly hunt. Here she had stretched  herself beside them and vainly offered them their natural drink and  yearned to feed and warm them as of old, but only stiff little bodies  under their soft wool she found, and little cold noses still and  unresponsive.    A deep impress of elbows, breasts, and hocks showed where she had laid  in silent grief and watched them for long and mourned as a wild mother  can mourn for its young. But from that time she came no more to the  ruined den, for now she surely knew that her little ones were dead.  Tip the captive, the weakling of the brood, was now the heir to all her  love. The dogs were loosed to guard the hens. The hired man had orders  to shoot the old fox on sight--so had I but was resolved never to see  her. Chicken-heads, that a fox loves and a dog will not touch, had been  poisoned and scattered through the woods; and the only way to the yard  where Tip was tied, was by climbing the wood-pile after braving all  other dangers.    And yet each night old Vix was there to nurse her baby and bring it  fresh-killed hens and game. Again and again I saw her, although she came  now without awaiting the querulous cry of the captive.    The second night of the captivity I heard the rattle of the chain, and  then made out that the old fox was there, hard at work digging a hole by  the little one's kennel. When it was deep enough to half bury her, she  gathered into it all the slack of the chain, and filled it again with  earth. Then in triumph thinking she had gotten rid of the chain, she  seized little Tip by the neck and turned to dash off up the wood-pile,  but alas! only to have him jerked roughly from her grasp.    Poor little fellow, he whimpered sadly as he crawled into his box. After  half an hour there was a great out cry among the dogs, and by their  straight-away tonguing through the far wood I knew they were chasing  Vix. Away up north they went in the direction of the railway and their  noise faded from hearing. Next morning the hound had not come back.  We soon knew why. Foxes long ago learned what a railroad is; they soon  devised several ways of turning it to account. One way is when hunted to  walk the rails for a long distance just before a train comes. The scent,  always poor on iron, is destroyed by the train and there is always a  chance of hounds being killed by the engine. But another way more sure,  but harder to play, is to lead the hounds straight to a high trestle  just ahead of the train, so that the engine overtakes them on it and  they are surely dashed to destruction.    This trick was skilfully played, and down below we found the mangled  remains of old Ranger and learned that Vix was already wreaking her  revenge.    That same night she returned to the yard before Spot's weary limbs  could bring him back and killed another hen and brought it to Tip, and  stretched her panting length beside him that he might quench his thirst.  For she seemed to think he had no food but what she brought.    It was that hen that betrayed to my uncle the nightly visits.    My own sympathies were all turning to Vix, and I would have no hand in  planning further murders. Next night my uncle himself watched, gun in  hand, for an hour. Then when it became cold and the moon clouded over  he remembered other important business elsewhere, and left Paddy in his  place.    But Paddy was \"onaisy\" as the stillness and anxiety of watching worked  on his nerves. And the loud bang! bang! an hour later left us sure only  that powder had been burned.    In the morning we found Vix had not failed her young one. Again next  night found my uncle on guard for another hen had been taken. Soon  after dark a single shot was heard, but Vix dropped the game she was  bringing and escaped. Another attempt made that night called forth  another gunshot. Yet next day it was seen by the brightness of the chain  that she had come again and vainly tried for hours to cut that hateful  bond.    Such courage and stanch fidelity were bound to win respect, if not  toleration. At any rate, there was no gunner in wait next night, when  all was still. Could it be of any use? Driven off thrice with gunshots,  would she make another try to feed or free her captive young one? Would  she? Hers was a mother's love. There was but one to watch them this  time, the fourth night, when the quavering whine of the little one was  followed by that shadowy form above the wood pile.    But carrying no fowl or food that could be seen. Had the keen huntress  failed at last? Had she no head of game for this her only charge, or had  she learned to trust his captors for his food?    No, far from all this. The wild-wood mother's heart and hate were true.  Her only thought had been to set him free. All means she knew she tried,  and every danger braved to tend him well and help him to be free. But  all had failed.    Like a shadow she came and in a moment was gone, and Tip seized on  something dropped, and crunched and chewed with relish what she brought.  But even as he ate, a knife-like pang shot through and a scream of pain  escaped him. Then there was a momentary struggle and the little fox was  dead.    The mother's love was strong in Vix, but a higher thought was stronger.  She knew right well the poison's power; she knew the poison bait, and  would have taught him had he lived to know and shun it too. But now at  last when she must choose for him a wretched prisoner's life or sudden  death, she quenched the mother in her breast and freed him by the one  remaining door.    It is when the snow is on the ground that we take the census of the  woods, and when the winter came it told me that Vix no longer roamed the  woods of Erindale. Where she went it never told, but only this, that she  was gone.    Gone, perhaps, to some other far-off haunt to leave behind the sad  remembrance of her murdered little ones and mate. Or gone, may be,  deliberately, from the scene of a sorrowful life, as many a wild-wood  mother has gone, by the means that she herself had used to free her  young one, the last of all her brood.          THE PACING MUSTANG    I    JO CALONE threw down his saddle on the dusty ground, turned his horses  loose, and went clanking into the ranchhouse.    \"Nigh about chuck time?\" he asked.    \"Seventeen minutes,\" said the cook glancing at the Waterbury, with the  air of a train starter, though this show of precision had never yet been  justified by events.    \"How's things on the Perico?\" said Jo's pard.    \"Hotter'n hinges,\" said Jo. \"Cattle seem O.K.; lots of calves.\"    \"I seen that bunch o' mustangs that waters at Antelope Springs; couple  o' colts along; one little dark one, a fair dandy; a born pacer. I run  them a mile or two, and he led the bunch, an' never broke his pace.  Cut loose, an' pushed them jest for fun, an' darned if I could make him  break.\"    \"You didn't have no reefreshments along?\" said Scarth, incredulously.    \"That's all right, Scarth. You had to crawl on our last bet, an' you'll  get another chance soon as you're man enough.\"    \"Chuck,\" shouted the cook, and the subject was dropped. Next day the  scene of the roundup was changed, and the mustangs were forgotten.    A year later the same corner of New Mexico was worked over by the  roundup, and again the mustang bunch was seen. The dark colt was now a  black yearling, with thin, clean legs and glossy flanks; and more than  one of the boys saw with his own eyes this oddity--the mustang was a  born pacer. Jo was along, and the idea now struck him that that colt  was worth having. To an Easterner this thought may not seem startling  or original, but in the West, where an unbroken horse is worth $5, and  where an ordinary saddlehorse is worth $15 or $20, the idea of a wild  mustang being desirable property does not occur to the average cowboy,  for mustangs are hard to catch, and when caught are merely wild animal  prisoners, perfectly useless and untamable to the last. Not a few of the  cattle-owners make a point of shooting all mustangs at sight, they are  not only useless cumberers of the feeding-grounds, but commonly lead  away domestic horses, which soon take to wild life and are thenceforth  lost.    Wild Jo Calone knew a 'bronk right down to subsoil.' \"I never seen a  white that wasn't soft, nor a chestnut that wasn't nervous, nor a bay  that wasn't good if broke right, nor a black that wasn't hard as nails,  an' full of the old Harry. All a black bronk wants is claws to be wus'n  Daniel's hull outfit of lions.\"    Since, then, a mustang is worthless vermin, and a black mustang ten  times worse than worthless, Jo's pard \"didn't see no sense in Jo's  wantin' to corral the yearling,\" as he now seemed intent on doing. But  Jo got no chance to try that year.    He was only a cow-puncher on $25 a month, and tied to hours. Like most  of the boys, he always looked forward to having a ranch and an outfit  of his own. His brand, the hogpen, of sinister suggestion, was already  registered at Santa Fe, but of horned stock it was borne by a single old  cow, so as to give him a legal right to put his brand on any maverick  (or unbranded animal) he might"]]]
