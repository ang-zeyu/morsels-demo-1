If the girl is so feeble that she cannot sit erect, as  represented by fig. 50, let her stand or recline on a couch; either is  preferable to the position represented by fig. 51. In furnishing  school-rooms, care should be taken that the desks are not so low as to  compel the pupils to lean forward in examining their books.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    203. Why should the erect attitude be assumed in sitting?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    [Illustration: Fig. 51. An improper position in sitting.]    204. _The muscles, when exhausted, cannot endure continued effort._  When the energies of the muscular system have been expended by severe  and long-continued exercise, or the brain and nervous system  prostrated by protracted mental effort, the muscles are unfitted to  maintain the body erect in standing or sitting for a long time, as the  nervous system, in its exhausted state, cannot supply a sufficient  amount of its peculiar influence to maintain the supporting muscles of  the body and head in a state of contraction. Hence, a child or adult,  when much fatigued, should not be compelled to stand or sit erect in  one posture, but should be permitted to vary the position frequently,  as this rests and recruits both the muscular and the nervous system.    205. _A slight relaxation of the muscles tends to prevent their  exhaustion._ In walking, dancing, and most of the mechanical  employments, there will be less fatigue, and the movements will be  more graceful, when the muscles are slightly relaxed. When riding in  cars or coaches, the system does not suffer so severely from the jar  if there is a slight relaxation of the muscles, as when they are in a  state of rigid contraction.    _Experiments._ Attempt to bow with the muscles of the limbs and trunk  rigid, and there will be a stiff bending of the body only at the  hip-joint. On the other hand, attempt to bow with the muscles  moderately relaxed; the ankle, the knee, and the hip-joint will  slightly bend, accompanied with an easy and graceful curve of the  body.    206. The muscles when relaxed, together with the yielding character of  the cartilage, and the porous structure of the ends of the bones that  form a joint, diffuse or deaden the force of jars, or shocks, in  stepping suddenly down stairs, or in falling from moderate heights.  Hence, in jumping or falling from a carriage, or any height, the shock  to the organs of the system may be obviated in the three following  ways: 1st. Let the muscles be relaxed, not rigid. 2d. Let the limbs be  bent at the ankle, knee, and hips; the head should be thrown slightly  forward, with the trunk a little stooping. 3d. Fall upon the toes, not  the heel.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    204. When are the muscles unfitted to maintain the system erect either  in standing or sitting? What is necessary when this condition of the  system exists? 205. Why should the muscular system be slightly relaxed  in walking, &c.? Give illustrative experiments. 206. What is the  reason that we do not feel the jar in falling from a moderate height?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    _Experiments._ Stand with the trunk and lower limbs firm, and the  muscles rigid; then jump a few inches perpendicularly to the floor,  and fall upon the heels. Again, slightly bend the limbs, jump a few  inches, and fall upon the toes, and the difference in the force of the  shock, to the brain and other organs, will be readily noticed.    207. _The muscles require to be educated, or trained._ The power of  giving different intonations in reading, speaking, singing, the varied  and rapid executions in penmanship, and all mechanical or agricultural  employments, depend, in a measure, upon the education of the muscles.  In the first effort of muscular education, the contractions of the  muscular fibres are irregular and feeble, as may be seen when the  child begins to walk, or in the first efforts of penmanship.    208. _Repetition of muscular action is necessary._ To render the  action of the muscles complete and effective, they must be called into  action repeatedly and at proper intervals. This education must be  continued until not only each muscle, but every fibre of the muscle,  is fully under the control of the will. In this way persons become  skilful in every employment. In training the muscles for effective  action, it is very important that correct movements be adopted at the  commencement. If this is neglected, the motions will be constrained  and improper, while power and skill will be lost.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    How is this shown by experiment? 207. Upon what do the different  intonations of sound or mechanical employments depend? Why are the  first efforts in educating the muscles indifferent or irregular? 208.  Why is repetition of muscular action necessary? Why is it important  that correct movements be adopted in the first efforts of muscular  education?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    _Illustration._ If a boy, while learning to mow, is allowed to swing  his scythe in a stooping position, twisting his body at every sweep of  the scythe, he will never become an easy, efficient mower. Proper  instruction is as necessary in many of the agricultural branches as in  the varied mechanical employments.    [Illustration: Fig. 52. An improper, but not an unusual position, when  writing.]    [Illustration: Fig. 53. A proper position, when writing.]    209. _Good penmanship requires properly trained muscles._ To a  deficient analysis of the movements of the arm, hand, and fingers, on  the part of teachers and pupils in penmanship, together with an  improper position in sitting, is to be ascribed the great want of  success in acquiring this art. The pen should be held loosely, and  when the proper position is attained, the scholar should make an  effort to imitate some definite copy as nearly as possible. The  movements of the fingers, hand, and arm, necessary to accomplish this,  should be made with ease and rapidity, striving, at each effort, to  imitate the copy more nearly.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    How is this illustrated? 209. Why have so many pupils failed in  acquiring good penmanship?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    210. When the arm, hand, and fingers are rigid, the large muscles,  that bend and extend these parts, are called into too intense action.  This requires of the small muscles, that produce the lateral  movements, which are essential to rapidity in writing, an effort which  they cannot make, or can with difficulty accomplish.    _Experiment._ Vigorously extend the fingers by a violent and rigid  contraction of the muscles upon the lower part of the arm, and the  lateral movement which is seen in their separation cannot be made. But  gently extend the fingers, and their oblique movements are made with  freedom.    211. An individual who is acquainted with the laws of health, whose  muscles are well trained, will perform a certain amount of labor with  less fatigue and waste to the system, than one who is ignorant of the  principles of hygiene, and whose muscles are imperfectly trained.  Hence the laboring poor have a deep interest in acquiring a knowledge  of practical physiology, as well as skill in their trade or vocation.  It is emphatically true to those who earn their bread by the \"sweat of  their brow,\" that \"knowledge is power.\"      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    210. What is said of the lateral and oblique movements of the arm,  hand, and fingers in writing? How is this shown by experiment? 211.  Why is the study of physiology and hygiene of utility to the laborer?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=          CHAPTER XII.    THE TEETH.      212. The teeth, in composition, nutrition, and growth, are different  from other bones of the body. They vary in number at different periods  of life, and, unlike other bones, they are exposed to the immediate  action of atmospheric air and foreign substances. The bones of the  system, generally, when fractured, unite; but there is never a  permanent union of a tooth when broken.      ANATOMY OF THE TEETH.    213. The TEETH are attached to the upper and lower jaw-bone, by means  of bony sockets, called _al've-o-lar_ processes. These give great  solidity to the attachment of the teeth, and frequently render their  extraction difficult. The gums, by their fibrous, fleshy structure,  serve to fix the teeth more firmly in the jaw.    _Observation._ When a _permanent_ tooth is extracted, these bony  processes are gradually absorbed, so that in advanced age there  remains only the jaw-bone covered by the lining membrane of the gum.  This accounts for the narrow jaw and falling in of the lips in old  age. Frequently, a piece of the alveolar process comes out with the  tooth when extracted, and the dentist has then the credit of \"breaking  the jaw.\" No great injury results from the removal of the process in  this manner.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    212. What is said of the teeth? In what respect do they differ from  other bones of the body? 213-218. _Give the anatomy of the teeth._  213. What confines the teeth in the jaw-bone? What becomes of the  socket when a tooth is removed? What effect has this absorption upon  the jaw and lips?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    214. The teeth are formed in the interior of the jaws, and within  _dent'al cap'sules_, (membranous pouches,) which are enclosed within  the substance of the bone, and present in their interior a fleshy bud,  or granule, from the surface of which exudes the ivory, or the bony  part of the tooth. In proportion as the tooth is formed, it rises in  the socket, which is developed simultaneously with the tooth, and  passes through the gum, and shows itself without.

Then Walter stooped down and gat his bow into his hand, and stood before  the Maid, while he nocked an arrow.  But the monster made ready his  tackle while Walter was stooping down, and or ever he could loose, his  bow-string twanged, and an arrow flew forth and grazed the Maid's arm  above the elbow, so that the blood ran, and the Dwarf gave forth a harsh  and horrible cry.  Then flew Walter's shaft, and true was it aimed, so  that it smote the monster full on the breast, but fell down from him as  if he were made of stone.  Then the creature set up his horrible cry  again, and loosed withal, and Walter deemed that he had smitten the Maid,  for she fell down in a heap behind him.  Then waxed Walter wood-wroth,  and cast down his bow and drew his sword, and strode forward towards the  bent against the Dwarf.  But he roared out again, and there were words in  his roar, and he said \"Fool! thou shalt go free if thou wilt give up the  Enemy.\"    \"And who,\" said Walter, \"is the Enemy?\"    Yelled the Dwarf: \"She, the pink and white thing lying there; she is not  dead yet; she is but dying for fear of me.  Yea, she hath reason!  I  could have set the shaft in her heart as easily as scratching her arm;  but I need her body alive, that I may wreak me on her.\"    \"What wilt thou do with her?\" said Walter; for now he had heard that the  Maid was not slain he had waxed wary again, and stood watching his  chance.    The Dwarf yelled so at his last word, that no word came from the noise a  while, and then he said: \"What will I with her?  Let me at her, and stand  by and look on, and then shalt thou have a strange tale to carry off with  thee.  For I will let thee go this while.\"    Said Walter: \"But what need to wreak thee?  What hath she done to thee?\"    \"What need! what need!\" roared the Dwarf; \"have I not told thee that she  is the Enemy?  And thou askest of what she hath done! of what!  Fool, she  is the murderer! she hath slain the Lady that was our Lady, and that made  us; she whom all we worshipped and adored.  O impudent fool!\"    Therewith he nocked and loosed another arrow, which would have smitten  Walter in the face, but that he lowered his head in the very nick of  time; then with a great shout he rushed up the bent, and was on the Dwarf  before he could get his sword out, and leaping aloft dealt the creature a  stroke amidmost of the crown; and so mightily be smote, that he drave the  heavy sword right through to the teeth, so that he fell dead straightway.    Walter stood over him a minute, and when be saw that he moved not, he  went slowly down to the stream, whereby the Maid yet lay cowering down  and quivering all over, and covering her face with her hands.  Then he  took her by the wrist and said: \"Up, Maiden, up! and tell me this tale of  the slaying.\"    But she shrunk away from him, and looked at him with wild eyes, and said:  \"What hast thou done with him?  Is he gone?\"    \"He is dead,\" said Walter; \"I have slain him; there lies he with cloven  skull on the bent-side: unless, forsooth, he vanish away like the lion I  slew! or else, perchance, he will come to life again!  And art thou a lie  like to the rest of them? let me hear of this slaying.\"    She rose up, and stood before him trembling, and said: \"O, thou art angry  with me, and thine anger I cannot bear.  Ah, what have I done?  Thou hast  slain one, and I, maybe, the other; and never had we escaped till both  these twain were dead.  Ah! thou dost not know! thou dost not know!  O  me! what shall I do to appease thy wrath!\"    He looked on her, and his heart rose to his mouth at the thought of  sundering from her.  Still he looked on her, and her piteous friendly  face melted all his heart; he threw down his sword, and took her by the  shoulders, and kissed her face over and over, and strained her to him, so  that he felt the sweetness of her bosom.  Then he lifted her up like a  child, and set her down on the green grass, and went down to the water,  and filled his hat therefrom, and came back to her; then he gave her to  drink, and bathed her face and her hands, so that the colour came aback  to the cheeks and lips of her: and she smiled on him and kissed his  hands, and said: \"O now thou art kind to me.\"    \"Yea,\" said he, \"and true it is that if thou hast slain, I have done no  less, and if thou hast lied, even so have I; and if thou hast played the  wanton, as I deem not that thou hast, I full surely have so done.  So now  thou shalt pardon me, and when thy spirit has come back to thee, thou  shalt tell me thy tale in all friendship, and in all loving-kindness will  I hearken the same.\"    Therewith he knelt before her and kissed her feet.  But she said: \"Yea,  yea; what thou willest, that will I do.  But first tell me one thing.  Hast thou buried this horror and hidden him in the earth?\"    He deemed that fear had bewildered her, and that she scarcely yet knew  how things had gone.  But he said: \"Fair sweet friend, I have not done it  as yet; but now will I go and do it, if it seem good to thee.\"    \"Yea,\" she said, \"but first must thou smite off his head, and lie it by  his buttocks when he is in the earth; or evil things will happen else.  This of the burying is no idle matter, I bid thee believe.\"    \"I doubt it not,\" said he; \"surely such malice as was in this one will be  hard to slay.\"  And he picked up his sword, and turned to go to the field  of deed.    She said: \"I must needs go with thee; terror hath so filled my soul, that  I durst not abide here without thee.\"    So they went both together to where the creature lay.  The Maid durst not  look on the dead monster, but Walter noted that he was girt with a big  ungainly sax; so he drew it from the sheath, and there smote off the  hideous head of the fiend with his own weapon.  Then they twain together  laboured the earth, she with Walter's sword, he with the ugly sax, till  they had made a grave deep and wide enough; and therein they thrust the  creature, and covered him up, weapons and all together.          CHAPTER XXIII: OF THE PEACEFUL ENDING OF THAT WILD DAY      Thereafter Walter led the Maid down again, and said to her: \"Now,  sweetling, shall the story be told.\"    \"Nay, friend,\" she said, \"not here.  This place hath been polluted by my  craven fear, and the horror of the vile wretch, of whom no words may tell  his vileness.  Let us hence and onward.  Thou seest I have once more come  to life again.\"    \"But,\" said he, \"thou hast been hurt by the Dwarf's arrow.\"    She laughed, and said: \"Had I never had greater hurt from them than that,  little had been the tale thereof: yet whereas thou lookest dolorous about  it, we will speedily heal it.\"    Therewith she sought about, and found nigh the stream-side certain herbs;  and she spake words over them, and bade Walter lay them on the wound,  which, forsooth, was of the least, and he did so, and bound a strip of  his shirt about her arm; and then would she set forth.  But he said:  \"Thou art all unshod; and but if that be seen to, our journey shall be  stayed by thy foot-soreness: I may make a shift to fashion thee brogues.\"    She said: \"I may well go barefoot.  And in any case, I entreat thee that  we tarry here no longer, but go away hence, if it be but for a mile.\"    And she looked piteously on him, so that he might not gainsay her.    So then they crossed the stream, and set forward, when amidst all these  haps the day was worn to midmorning.  But after they had gone a mile,  they sat them down on a knoll under the shadow of a big thorn-tree,  within sight of the mountains.  Then said Walter: \"Now will I cut thee  the brogues from the skirt of my buff-coat, which shall be well meet for  such work; and meanwhile shalt thou tell me thy tale.\"    \"Thou art kind,\" she said; \"but be kinder yet, and abide my tale till we  have done our day's work.  For we were best to make no long delay here;  because, though thou hast slain the King-dwarf, yet there be others of  his kindred, who swarm in some parts of the wood as the rabbits in a  warren.  Now true it is that they have but little understanding, less, it  may be, than the very brute beasts; and that, as I said afore, unless  they be set on our slot like to hounds, they shall have no inkling of  where to seek us, yet might they happen upon us by mere misadventure.  And  moreover, friend,\" quoth she, blushing, \"I would beg of thee some little  respite; for though I scarce fear thy wrath any more, since thou hast  been so kind to me, yet is there shame in that which I have to tell thee.  Wherefore, since the fairest of the day is before us, let us use it all  we may, and, when thou hast done me my new foot-gear, get us gone forward  again.\"    He kissed her kindly and yea-said her asking: he had already fallen to  work on the leather, and in a while had fashioned her the brogues; so she  tied them to her feet, and arose with a smile and said: \"Now am I hale  and strong again, what with the rest, and what with thy loving-kindness,  and thou shalt see how nimble I shall be to leave this land, for as fair  as it is.  Since forsooth a land of lies it is, and of grief to the  children of Adam.\"    So they went their ways thence, and fared nimbly indeed, and made no stay  till some three hours after noon, when they rested by a thicket-side,  where the strawberries grew plenty; they ate thereof what they would: and  from a great oak hard by Walter shot him first one culver, and then  another, and hung them to his girdle to be for their evening's meal;  sithence they went forward again, and nought befell them to tell of, till  they were come, whenas it lacked scarce an hour of sunset, to the banks  of another river, not right great, but bigger than the last one.  There  the Maid cast herself down and said: \"Friend, no further will thy friend  go this even; nay, to say sooth, she cannot.  So now we will "]]]
