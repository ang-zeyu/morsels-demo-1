And it is not difficult to put  the laazim back into French, because of the well-defined system  of transcription employed.  Even the laws of declension (or what  remained of declension in the old French) are observed.    Unfortunately, the great use made of Rashi's commentaries  necessitated a large number of copies, and frequent copying  produced many mistakes.  Naturally, it was the laazim that  suffered most from the ignorance and carelessness of the copyists  and printers, especially in the countries in which French was not  the current language.  Efforts have been made within the last two  centuries to restore the laazim.  Mendelssohn and his associates  applied themselves to the commentary on the Pentateuch, Lowe, to  the Psalms, Neumann, to the Minor Prophets, Jeitteles and Laudau,  to the whole of the Bible, and the Bondi brothers, Dormitzer,  and, above all, Landau, to the Talmudic commentaries.  But these  authors, not having consulted the manuscripts and knowing the  French language of the middle ages only imperfectly, arrived at  insufficient results.  Even the identifications of Berliner in  his critical edition of the commentary on the Pentateuch are not  always exact and are rarely scientific.    Arsene Darmesteter (1846-1888), one of the elect of French  Judaism and a remarkable scholar in the philology of the Romance  languages, realized that in the commentaries of Rashi \"the  science of philology possesses important material upon which to  draw for the history of the language in an early stage of its  developinent.\" With the aim of utilizing this material, he  visited the libraries of England and Italy, and gathered much  that was important; but his numerous occupations and his  premature death prevented him from finishing and publishing his  work.  In the interests of French philology as well as for a  complete understanding of the text of Rashi, it would be  advantageous to publish the notes that he collected.  In fact,  such a work will appear, but unfortunately not in the proportions  Darmesteter would have given it.  Nevertheless, it will be found  to contain information and unique information, upon the history,  the phonetics, and the orthography of medieval French; for the  first literary works, which go as far back as the eleventh  century, the life of Saint Alexius and the epic of Roland, have  not come down to us in the form in which they were written.  \"What  would the trouveres of Roland and the clerics of Saint Alexius  have said if they had been told that one day the speech of their  warrior songs and their pious homilies would need the aid of the  Ghetto to reach the full light of day, and the living sound of  their words would fall upon the ears of posterity through the  accursed jargon of an outlawed race?\"[57]    In this chapter I have made some general observations upon the  composition and the method of the Biblical and Talmudic  Commentaries of Rashi.  Concerning their common characteristics  there is little to add, except to remark that the explanations  are generally simple, natural, and unforced.  This is especially  true of the Talmudic commentaries.  Rashi in large part owes the  foundations upon which his works are built to his predecessors,  and no higher praise could be accorded him than to say that he  knew the great mass of traditions and the explanations made  before him.    However, Rashi rather frequently gave his own personal  explanation, either because he did not know another, or because  those propounded before him did not seem adequate or satisfying.  In the latter case, he usually put down the rejected explanation  before setting forth his own.  Yet there are cases in which  intelligence and imagination fail to supply knowledge of some  special circumstance; and such lack of knowledge led Rashi into  many errors.  On the whole, however, the commentaries contain  invaluable information, and are of the very highest importance  for Jewish history and literature, because of the citations in  them of certain lost works, or because of hints of certain facts  which otherwise would be unknown.  Modern historians justly  recognize in Rashi one of the most authoritative representatives  of rabbinical tradition, and it is rare for them to consult him  without profit to themselves.                               CHAPTER VI                        THE BIBLICAL COMMENTARIES    \"Thanks to Rashi the Torah has been renewed.  The word of the Lord  in his mouth was truth.  His way was perfect and always the same.  By his commentary he exalted the Torah and fortified it.  All wise  men and all scholars recognize him as master, and acknowledge  that there is no commentary comparable with his.\"  This  enthusiastic verdict of Eliezer ben Nathan[58] has been ratified  by the following generations, which, by a clever play upon words,  accorded him the title of <I>Parshandata,</I> Interpreter of the  Law.[59]  And, verily, during his life Rashi had been an  interpreter of the Law, when he explained the Scriptures to his  disciples and to his other co-religionists; and he prolonged this  beneficent activity in his commentaries, in which one seems to  feel his passionate love of the law of God and his lively desire  to render the understanding of it easy to his people.  Yet it is  true that all scholars did not share in the general admiration of  Rashi, and discordant notes may be heard in the symphony of  enthusiasm.    Of what avail these eulogies and what signify these reservations?    If one reflects that the Bible is at the same time the most  important and the most obscure of the books that antiquity has  bequeathed to us, it seems natural that it should soon have been  translated and commented upon.  The official Aramaic translation,  or Targum, of the Pentateuch is attributed to Onkelos and that of  the Prophets[60] to Jonathan ben Uzziel.  Rashi constantly draws  inspiration from both these works, and possibly also from the  Targumim to the Hagiographa, which are much more recent than the  other two Targumim.  Sometimes he simply refers to them,  sometimes he reproduces them, less frequently he remarks that  they do not agree with the text.    For the establishment of the text Rashi scrupulously follows the  Massorah, the \"Scriptural Statistics,\" the work of scholars who  lived in the period between the seventh and the tenth century,  and who assured the integrity of the Bible by counting the number  of verses in each book and the number of times each word, phrase,  or expression recurs.  The Massorah soon came to have great  authority; and many scholars, such as R. Gershom, for example,  copied it with their own hands in order to have a correct and  carefully made text of the Bible.  The Massorah was Rashi's  constant guide.  From a calculation made, of the number of times  he transgressed its rules, the infractions do not appear to be  numerous, and sometimes they seem to have been involuntary.  As a  consequence, variants from the text of the Bible are extremely  rare in Rashi, and the copyists eliminated them entirely.  In  general at his time the text was definitely established to the  minutest details, and variants, if there were any, were due to  blunders of the copyists.  Rashi, who probably carefully compared  manuscripts, once remarked upon such faulty readings.    It is to the Massoretes that some attribute the accents which  serve to mark at once the punctuation and the accentuation of the  Biblical text.  Rashi naturally conformed to this system of  accentuation, and if he departed from it, it seems he frequently  did so inadvertently.           *       *       *       *       *    But the two great sources upon which Rashi drew for his exegesis  were the Talmudic and the Midrashic literature, with their two  methods of interpreting the Scriptures.  As a knowledge of these  two methods is indispensable to an understanding of Rashi's  exegesis, I will give some pages from the work of a recent French  exegete, L. Wogue, who presents an excellent characterization of  them in his <I>Histoire de la Bible et de l'exegese biblique:</I>       Whatever diversities may exist in the point of view adopted by     the investigators of the Bible, in the aims they pursued, and     in the methods they employed, the methods are necessarily to     be summed up in the two terms, <I>peshat</I> and     <I>derash.</I>  This is a fact which scarcely requires     demonstration.  There are only two ways of understanding or     explaining any text whatsoever, either according to the     natural acceptation of its meaning, or contrary to this     acceptation.  At first glance it seems as though the former     were the only reasonable and legitimate method, and as though     the second lacked either sincerity or common sense, and had no     right to the title of method.  Yet we shall see how it came     about, and how it was bound to come about, that the Derash not     only arose in the Synagogue, but assumed preponderating     importance there.    From very ancient times the Pentateuch and certain chapters of  the Prophets were read or translated in the synagogue every  Saturday.  Accordingly, the interpretation of the Law could not  be slavishly literal.       Destined for the edification of the ignorant masses inclined     to superstition, it perforce permitted itself some freedom in     order to avoid annoying misconceptions.  Sometimes the literal     rendition might suggest gross errors concerning the Divine     Being, sometimes it might appear to be in conflict with     practices consecrated by the oral law or by an old tradition,     and sometimes, finally, it might in itself be grotesque and     unintelligible.  Hence a double tendency in exegesis, each     tendency asserting itself in the synagogue at different epochs     and with varying force....  Two"]]]
