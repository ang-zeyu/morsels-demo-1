He rose rapidly at the Bar, until  he became Chief Baron of Exchequer. He was the founder of the convivial  order of St. Patrick, called \"The Monks of the Screw,\" of which Curran,  who wrote its charter song, was Prior. Avonmore was a man of warm and  benevolent feelings, which he gave vent to in an equal degree in private  life, in the senate, and on the Bench.    Before giving an anecdote of Lord Avonmore it may interest readers,  especially English and Scottish, to quote here the charter song of this  famous Irish convivial club of the eighteenth century.        THE CHARTER SONG OF THE      MONKS OF THE SCREW        When St. Patrick this order establish'd,      He called us the \"Monks of the Screw\"!      Good rules he reveal'd to our Abbot,      To guide us in what we should do.      But first he replenish'd our fountain,      With liquor the best in the sky;      And he swore on the word of a saint      That the fountain should never run dry.        Each year when your octaves approach,      In full chapter convened let me find you,      And when to the convent you come      Leave your favourite temptation behind you;      And be not a glass in your convent,      Unless on a festival found;      And this rule to enforce I ordain it,      Our festival all the year round.        My brethren, be chaste till you're tempted;      While sober be grave and discreet;      And humble your bodies with fasting,      As oft as you've nothing to eat.      Yet, in honour of fasting, one lean face      Among you I'll always require,      If the Abbot should please he may wear it--      If not, let it come to the Prior.    The last two lines hit off the appearance of the Abbot, a Mr. Doyle, and  of the Prior, J. P. Curran. The former was a big burly man with a fat,  jovial face, while Curran was a short and particularly spare man whose  \"lean face\" always attracted attention.    On a Lent Circuit, one of the Assize towns happened to be a place, of  which one of Lord Avonmore's college contemporaries held a living: at  his own request, the Chief Baron's reverend friend preached the Assize  sermon. The time being the month of March the weather was cold, the  judge was chilled, and unhappily the sermon was long, and the preacher  tedious. After the discourse was over, the preacher descended from the  pulpit and approached the judge, smirking and smiling, looking fully  satisfied with his own exertions, and expecting to receive the  compliments and congratulations of his quondam chum. \"Well, my lord,\"  he asked, \"and how did you like the sermon?\"--\"Oh! most wonderfully,\"  replied Avonmore. \"It was like the peace of God--it passed all  understanding; and--like his mercy--I thought it would have endured for  ever.\"           *       *       *       *       *    When Plunket was at the Bar his great friend and rival was C. K. Bushe.  The former was Attorney-General at the same time as the latter was  Solicitor-General, and it caused him much dissatisfaction when Plunket  learned that on a change of Government Solicitor-General Bushe had not  followed his example and resigned office. At the time this occurred both  barristers happened to be engaged in a case at which, when it was  called, Bushe only appeared. On the judge inquiring of Mr. Bushe if he  knew the reason of Mr. Plunket's absence his friend jocosely remarked,  \"I suppose, my lord, he is Cabinet-making.\" This pleasantry, at his  expense, was told to Plunket by a friend, when he arrived in Court, on  which, turning to the judge, the ex-Attorney-General proudly said, \"I  assure your lordship I am not so well qualified for Cabinet-making as my  learned friend. I never was either a _turner_ or a _joiner_.\"    Two eminent Irish astronomers differed in an argument on the parallax of  a lyrae--the one maintaining that it was three seconds, and the other  that it was only two seconds. On being told of this discussion, and  that the astronomers parted without arriving at an agreement, Plunket  quietly remarked: \"It must be a very serious quarrel indeed, when even  the seconds cannot agree.\"    Once applying the common expression to accommodation bills of exchange,  that they were _mere kites_, the judge, an English Chancellor, said \"he  never heard that expression applied before to any but the kites of  boys.\"--\"Oh,\" replied Plunket, \"that's the difference between kites in  England and in Ireland. In England the wind raises the kite, but in  Ireland the kite raises the wind.\"    Everybody (says Phillips) knew how acutely Plunket felt his forced  resignation of the chancellorship, and his being superseded by Lord  Campbell. A violent storm arose on the day of Campbell's expected  arrival, and a friend remarking to Plunket how sick of his promotion the  passage must have made the new Chancellor: \"Yes,\" said the former,  ruefully, \"but it won't make him throw up the seals.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Frankfort Moore, in his _Journalist's Notebook_, relates how Justice  Lawson summed up in the case of a man who was charged with stealing a  pig. The evidence of the theft was quite conclusive, and, in fact, was  not combated; but the prisoner called the priests and neighbours to  attest to his good character. \"Gentlemen of the jury,\" said the judge,  \"I think that the only conclusion you can arrive at is, that the pig was  stolen by the prisoner, and that he is the most amiable man in the  country.\"          CHAPTER FOUR    THE BARRISTERS OF IRELAND           \"'Men that hire out their words and anger'; that are more or       less passionate according as they are paid for it, and allow       their client a quantity of wrath proportionable to the fee       which they receive from him.\"         ADDISON: _The Spectator_.          CHAPTER FOUR    THE BARRISTERS OF IRELAND      The Irish counsel like the occupants of the Bench were, in early times,  eminent for their jolly carousing. Once, about 1687, a heavy argument  coming on before Lord Chancellor Fitton, Mr. Nagle, the solicitor,  retained Sir Toby Butler as counsel, who entered into a bargain that he  would not drink a drop of wine while the case was at hearing. This  bargain reached the ears of the Chancellor, who asked Sir Toby if it was  true that such a compact had been made. The counsel said it was true,  and the bargain had been rigidly kept; but on further inquiry he  admitted that as he had only promised not to _drink_ a _drop_ of wine,  he felt he must have some stimulant. So he got a basin, into which he  poured two bottles of claret, and then got two hot rolls of bread,  sopped them in the claret and ate them. \"I see,\" replied the Chancellor;  \"in truth, Sir Toby, you deserve to be master of the rolls!\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: JOHN P. CURRAN, MASTER OF ROLLS.]    One naturally turns to Curran for a selection of the witty sayings of  the Irish Bar, and abundantly he supplies them, although in these days  many of his jests may be considered as in somewhat doubtful taste.  Phillips tells us he remembered Curran once--in an action for breach of  promise of marriage, in which he was counsel for the defendant, a young  clergyman--thus appealing to the jury: \"Gentlemen, I entreat you not to  ruin this young man by a vindictive verdict; for _though_ he has  talents, and is in the Church, _he may rise_!\"    After his college career Curran went to London to study for the  Bar. His circumstances were often straitened, and at times so much  so that he had to pass the day without dinner. But under such  depressing circumstances his high spirits never forsook him. One  day he was sitting in St. James's Park merrily whistling a tune  when a gentleman passed, who, struck by the youth's melancholy  appearance while, at the same time, he whistled a lively air, asked  how he \"came to be sitting there whistling while other people were  at dinner.\" Curran replied, \"I would have been at dinner too, but a  trifling circumstance--delay in remittances--obliges me to dine on  an Irish tune.\" The result was that Curran was invited to dine with  the stranger, and years afterwards, when he had become famous, he  recalled the incident to his entertainer--Macklin, the celebrated  actor--with the assurance, \"You never acted better in your life.\"    From Phillips again we have Curran's retort upon an Irish judge, who was  quite as remarkable for his good humour and raillery as for his legal  researches. Curran was addressing a jury on one of the State trials in  1803 with his usual animation. The judge, whose political bias, if any  judge can have one, was certainly supposed not to be favourable to the  prisoner, shook his head in doubt or denial of one of the advocate's  arguments. \"I see, gentlemen,\" said Curran, \"I see the motion of his  lordship's head; common observers might imagine that implied a  difference of opinion, but they would be mistaken; it is merely  accidental. Believe me, gentlemen, if you remain here many days, you  will yourselves perceive that when his lordship shakes his head, there's  _nothing in it_!\"    Curran was one day engaged in a case in which he had for a junior a  remarkably tall and slender gentleman, who had been originally intended  to take orders. The judge observing that the case under discussion  involved a question of ecclesiastical law, Curran interposed with: \"I  refer your lordship to a high authority behind me, who was once intended  for the Church, though in my opinion he was fitter for the steeple.\"    He was one day walking with a friend, who, hearing a person say  \"curosity\" for \"curiosity,\" exclaimed: \"How that man"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3003"],[0,"Wild Flowers (#17)"],[1,"airs, inserted on tube of  corolla ; 1 pistil. Stem: About 1 in. long, scaly, often entirely  underground; the 1 to 4 brownish scape-like peduncles, on which  flowers are borne, from 3 to 8 in. high. Leaves: None. Fruit: An  elongated, egg-shaped, 1-celled capsule containing numerous  seeds.  Preferred Habitat - Damp woods and thickets.  Flowering Season - April-June.  Distribution - British Possessions and United States from coast  to coast, southward to Virginia, and Texas.    A curious, beautiful parasite, fastened on the roots of honest  plants from which it draws its nourishment. The ancestors of this  species, having deserted the path of rectitude ages ago to live  by piracy, gradually lost the use of their leaves, upon which  virtuous plants depend as upon a part of their digestive  apparatus; they grew smaller and smaller, shriveled and dried,  until now that the one-flowered broom-rape sucks its food,  rendered already digestible through another's assimilation, no  leaves remain on its brownish scapes. Disuse of any talent in the  vegetable kingdom, as in the spiritual, leads to inevitable loss:  \"Unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath  not, even that he hath shall be taken away.\"      HAIRY RUELLIA    (Ruellia ciliosa)  Acanthus family    Flowers - Pale violet blue, showy, about 2 in. long, solitary or  clustered in the axils or at the end of stem. Calyx of 5  bristle-shaped hairy segments; corolla with very slender tube  expanding above in 5 nearly equal obtuse lobes; stamens 4; pistil  with recurved style. Stem: Hairy, especially above, erect, 1 to 2  1/2 ft. high. Leaves: Opposite, oblong, narrowed at apex, entire,  covered with soft white hairs.  Preferred Habitat - Dry soil.  Flowering Season - June-September.  Distribution - New Jersey southward to the Gulf and westward to  Michigan and Nebraska.    Many charming ruellias from the tropics adorn hothouses and  window gardens in winter; but so far north as the New Jersey pine  barrens, and westward where killing frosts occur, this perennial  proves to be perfectly hardy. In addition to its showy blossoms,  which so successfully invite insects to transfer their pollen,  thereby counteracting the bad effects of close inbreeding, the  plant bears inconspicuous cleistogamous or blind ones also. These  look like arrested buds that never open; but, being fertilized  with their own pollen, ripen abundant seed nevertheless.    One frequently finds holes bitten in these flowers, as in so many  others long of tube or spur. Bumblebees, among the most  intelligent and mischievous of insects, are apt to be the chief  offenders; but wasps are guilty too, and the female carpenter  bee, which ordinarily slits holes to extract nectar, has been  detected in the act of removing circular pieces of the corolla  from this ruellia with which to plug up a thimble-shaped tube in  some decayed tree. Here she deposits an egg on top of a layer of  baby food, consisting of a paste of pollen and nectar, and seals  up the nursery with another bit of leaf or flower, repeating the  process until the long tunnel is filled with eggs and food for  larvae. Then she dies, leaving her entire race apparently  extinct, and living only in embryo for months. This is the bee  which commonly cuts her round plugs from rose leaves.    The SMOOTH RUELLIA (R. strepens), an earlier bloomer than the  preceding, and with a more southerly range, has a shorter,  thicker tube to its handsome blue flower, and lacks the hairs  which guard its relative from crawling pilferers.      BLUETS; INNOCENCE; HOUSTONIA; QUAKER LADIES; QUAKER BONNETS;  VENUS' PRIDE    (Houstonia caerulea)  Madder family    Flowers - Very small, light to purplish blue or white, with  yellow center, and borne at end of each erect slender stem that  rises from 3 to 7 in. high. Corolla funnel-shaped, with 4 oval,  pointed, spreading lobes that equal the slender tube in length;  rarely the corolla has more divisions; 4 stamens inserted on tube  of corolla; 2 stigmas; calyx 4-lobed. Leaves: Opposite, seated on  stem, oblong, tiny; the lower ones spatulate. Fruit: A 2-lobed  pod, broader than long, its upper half free from calyx; seeds  deeply concave. Root stock: Slender, spreading, forming dense  tufts.  Preferred Habitat - Moist meadows, wet rocks and banks.  Flowering Season - April-July, or sparsely through summer.  Distribution - Eastern Canada and United States west to Michigan,  south to Georgia and Alabama.    Millions of these dainty wee flowers, scattered through the grass  of moist meadows and by the wayside, reflect the blue and the  serenity of heaven in their pure, upturned faces. Where the white  variety grows, one might think a light snowfall had powdered the  grass, or a milky way of tiny floral stars had streaked a  terrestrial path. Linnaeus named the flower for Dr. Houston, a  young English physician, botanist, and collector, who died in  South America in 1733, after an exhausting tramp about the Gulf  of Mexico.    To secure cross-fertilization, the object toward which so much  marvelous floral organism is directed, this little plant puts  forth two forms of blossoms - one with the stamens in the lower  portion of the corolla tube, and the stigmas exserted; the other  form with the stigmas below, and the stamens elevated to the  mouth of the corolla. But the two kinds do not grow in the same  patch, seed from either producing after its kind. Many insects  visit these blossoms, but chiefly small bees and butterflies.  Conspicuous among the latter is the common little meadow  fritillary (Brenthis bellona), whose tawny, dark-speckled wings  expand and close in apparent ecstasy as he tastes the tiny drop  of nectar in each dainty enameled cup. Coming to feast with his  tongue dusted from anthers nearest the nectary, he pollenizes the  large stigmas of a short-styled blossom without touching its tall  anthers. But it is evident that he could not be depended on to  fertilize the long-styled form, with its smaller stigma, because  of this ability to insert his slender tongue from the side where  it avoids contact. Flies and beetles enter the blossoms, but  small bees are best adapted as all-round benefactors. This  simple-looking blossom, that measures barely half an inch across,  is clever enough to multiply its lovely species a thousand fold,  while many a larger, and therefore one might suppose a wiser,  flower dwindles toward extinction.    John Burroughs found a single bluet in blossom one January, near  Washington, when the clump of earth on which it grew was frozen  solid. A pot of roots gathered in autumn and placed in a sunny  window has sent up a little colony of star-like flowers  throughout a winter.      WILD, COMMON, or CARD TEASEL; GYPSY COMBS    (Dipsacus sylvestris)  Teasel family    Flowers - Purple or lilac, small, packed in dense, cylindric  heads, 3 to 4 in. long; growing singly on ends of footstalks, the  flowers set among stiffly pointed, slender scales. Calyx  cup-shaped, 4-toothed. Corolla 4-lobed; stamens 4; leaves of  involucre, slender, bristled, curved upward as high as  flower-head or beyond. Stems: 3 to 6 ft. high, stout, branched,  leafy, with numerous short prickles. Leaves: Opposite,  lance-shaped, seated on stem, with bristles along the stout  midrib.  Preferred Habitat - Roadsides and waste places.  Flowering Season - July-September.  Distribution - Maine to Virginia, westward to Ontario and the  Mississippi. Europe and Asia.    Manufacturers find that no invention can equal the natural teasel  head for raising a nap on woolen cloth, because it breaks at any  serious obstruction, whereas a metal substitute, in such a case,  tears the material. Accordingly, the plant is largely cultivated  in the west of England, and quantities that have been imported  from France and Germany may be seen in wagons on the way to the  factories in any of the woolen-trade towns. After the  flower-heads wither, the stems are cut about eight inches long,  stripped of prickles, to provide a handle, and after drying, the  natural tool is ready for use.    Bristling with armor, the teasel is not often attacked by  browsing cattle. Occasionally even the upper leaf surfaces are  dotted over with prickles enough to tear a tender tongue. This is  a curious feature, for prickles usually grow out of veins. In the  receptacle formed where the bases of the upper leaves grow  together, rain and dew are found collected - a certain cure for  warts, country people say. Venus' Cup, Bath, or Basin, and Water  Thistle, are a few of the teasel's folk names earned by its  curious little tank. In it many small insects are drowned, and  these are supposed to contribute nourishment to the plant; for  Mr. Francis Darwin has noted that protoplasmic filaments reach  out into the liquid.    Owing to the stiff spines which radiate from the flower cluster,  the bumblebees, which principally fertilize it, can reach the  florets only with their heads, and not pollenize them by merely  crawling over them as in the true compositae. But by first  maturing its anthers, then when they have shed their pollen,  elevating its stigmas, the teasel prevents self-fertilization.      HAREBELL or HAIRBELL; BLUE BELLS of SCOTLAND; LADY'S THIMBLE    (Campanula rotundifolia)  Bellflower family    Flowers - Bright blue or violet blue, bell-shaped, 1/2 in. long  or over, drooping from hair-like stalks. Calyx of 5-pointed,  narrow, spreading lobes; slender stamens alternate with lobes of  corolla, and borne on summit of calyx tube, which is adherent to  ovary; pistil with 3 stigmas in maturity only. Stem: Very  slender, 6 in. to 3 ft. high, often several from same root;  simple or branching. Leaves: Lower ones nearly round, usually  withered and gone by flowering season; stem leaves narrow,  pointed, seated on stem. Fruit: An egg-shaped, pendent, 3-celled  capsule with short openings near base; seeds very numerous, tiny.  Preferred "]]]
