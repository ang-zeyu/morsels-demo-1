After a little while the peace officers prevailed on them to desist.  They then prepared an effigy, which they carried through the streets  on a rail for some time; then forming an assembly before the State  House, had an oration delivered on the subject and burned the effigy,  while the men of the city dared not open their mouths or say ought to  them. They then went to a place where they had three pieces of cannon,  which they continued firing until daylight. This was a night of  peculiar feeling; reflecting upon the night when my brethren were  driven from their homes in Jackson County, Missouri, by a similar mob,  and also considering that the time might come when I might fall into  the hands of a like band of ruffians, my cry to the Lord was, Save the  man from the hands of these foul monsters. There was such an uproar in  the city next morning, that it took five men to hold the horses while  the passengers got into the stage. This man was one of the first  lecturers on Abolitionism in that country, and it was then very  unpopular.\"    At Plainfield, Heber tarried two days with his cousin, Charles  Spaulding, in the house where his mother was born and reared. From him  he received a legacy of seven dollars, left him by his aunt, Speedy  Spaulding, who had died a short time before. This money enabled him to  pursue his journey. By way of Albany, New York, Palmyra and the hill  Cumorah, he proceeded to Canandaigua, where lived his sister Melvina  (Mrs. James M. Wheeler) and to Byron, the home of his sister Abigail  (Mrs. Jesse Mum). Thence he rode on to Buffalo, the stage arriving  just one hour ahead of the appointed time. His brethren, the Apostles,  were all there awaiting him.    Taking passage on board the steamer \"United States,\" they had gone as  far as Dunkirk when the vessel struck a rock and sprung a leak. She  made for Erie, but reached there with difficulty, being obliged to run  upon a sand-bar to keep from sinking. Hailing a passing boat, the  Apostles left the disabled steamer, and on board the other arrived at  Fairport, from which point they had sailed nearly five months before.  Here they hired wagons and drove on to Kirtland, reaching home on the  25th of September.    While the Apostles were absent upon this mission, the \"accuser of the  brethren\" had been busy sowing discord, with a view to causing  coldness and estrangement between the First Presidency and the Twelve.  Two of the Apostles, Orson Hyde and William E. McLellin, had been  suspended during their absence and called home for trial, and, so  great was the influence brought to bear by misrepresentation upon the  minds of the Presidency, they had been led to mistrust the fidelity of  others.    The charge against Elders Hyde and McLellin was for speaking and  writing disrespectfully of President Rigdon, in his manner of  conducting the Kirtland school. The charge was substantiated, and the  brethren confessed their fault and were restored to fellowship.    The accusations against the Twelve were more serious. It was said that  they had sought to be independent of the presiding quorum of the  Church, and had failed to fulfill their mission, in not preaching, at  the Freedom conference, the gathering to Zion, or the collection of  means for the Kirtland Temple and the purchase of lands in Missouri.  Both charges were proved to be groundless.    At the council, where the Apostles laid their grievances before the  Presidency, and \"all things were reconciled,\" the Prophet Joseph, it  is said, made a covenant with the Twelve that never again would he  entertain a charge against them on one-sided testimony, or pass  judgment upon them even in thought, without first giving them an  opportunity of being heard in their own defense.    If this noble, just, and charitable resolve had always been adhered to  by the Saints of God, in whom, if in any people, such a principle  should find its exponents and exemplars, how many bitter  heart-burnings might have been spared; how many reputations remained  unblasted, enmities unaroused, wounds uninfected! Had the idle gossip,  the malicious slanderer, the toadying, truckling tale-bearer, who  oscillates, pendulum-like, between man and man, seeking occasion  against his brother, making him \"an offender for a word,\" coloring all  he hears, and pouring into oft too willing ears his insidious tale of  derogations and detractions;--had such characters invariably been  required to face those whom they accused and to prove their  assertions, who can say that the cause of Zion, the unity and  purification of God's people, would not have been subserved rather  than injured thereby? Are we not too prone to heed the tale-bearer,  the secret enemy, who, striking unawares with \"the shaft that flies in  darkness,\" perchance seeks to build up his own, upon the ruins of his  brother's reputation; and too slow to remember justice and the law of  God--that in the mouths of two or three witnesses, and these not  enemies of the accused, shall every word be established?    Well might Solomon say, and well may it be believed, that among the  things which \"the Lord doth hate,\" are \"a false witness that speaketh  lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.\"    The men who had caused the trouble between the Presidency and the  Apostles, or those whom Heber held responsible, were Warren Cowdery,  Jared Carter and others, who, using Oliver Cowdery and other  influential Elders near the person of the Prophet, as conduits of  their ill-will, wrought injury to their brethren who were far away,  unable, because absent, to defend themselves.    \"I will here remark,\" says Heber, \"that every individual who used an  influence against the Twelve on their mission, apostatized and went  out of the Church; and this should remain an everlasting warning to  all others. In those days there was a continual itching in certain  individuals to destroy the union existing between the Twelve and the  First Presidency, and the union in the First Presidency, which thing  they did at last effect, which broke up the Church for a time; for  Oliver Cowdery, Warren Cowdery, Jared Carter, Frederick G. Williams,  and six of the Twelve became disaffected, and turned against Joseph  and those of the Twelve who sustained him.\"    As, in the end, good comes of evil, and from the compost-heap springs  forth the flower of fragrance and beauty, so from the unhappy event  related, issued good and glad results. From the time the  reconciliation took place between the Presidency and the Twelve, a  reformation commenced in the Church. \"Those meetings,\" says Heber, \"of  humiliation, repentance, and confessing of sins, were truly the  beginning of good days to us, and they continued through the  endowment.\"          CHAPTER XII.    HEBER'S DESCRIPTION OF THE TEMPLE--ITS DEDICATION--ANGELS  ADMINISTER--THE \"BELOVED DISCIPLE\" JOHN SEEN--THE SOLEMN ASSEMBLY--THE  ELDERS ENDOWED WITH POWER FROM ON HIGH--HEBER'S LONE MISSION.      The Kirtland Temple was dedicated on the 27th of March, 1836. It was  yet in an unfinished state, but for some time had been used for  meetings and councils of the Priesthood. From Heber's pen we have the  following description of the edifice and the ceremonies of its  dedication:    \"This building the Saints commenced in 1833, in poverty, and without  means to do it. In 1834 they completed the walls, and in 1835-6 they  nearly finished it. The cost was between sixty and seventy thousand  dollars. A committee was appointed to gather donations; they traveled  among the churches and collected a considerable amount, but not  sufficient, so that in the end they found themselves between thirteen  and fourteen thousand dollars in debt. This house was 80 x 60 feet,  and 57 feet high to the eaves. It was divided into two stories, each  22 feet high and arched overhead. Ten feet were cut off from the front  by a partition, and used as an entry or outer court, which also  contained the stairs. This left the main room 55 x 65 feet in the  clear, both below and above. In each of these rooms were built two  pulpits, one in each end. Each pulpit consisted of four different  apartments; the fourth standing on a platform raised a suitable height  above the floor; the third stood directly behind and elevated a little  above the fourth; the second in rear of and elevated above the third;  and in like manner the first above the second. Each of these  apartments was just large enough and rightly calculated to seat three  persons, and the breastwork in front of each of these three last  mentioned was constituted of three semicircles joining each other, and  finished in good style. The fourth or lower one, was straight in  front, and had an elegant table leaf attached to it, that could be  raised at pleasure for the convenience of administering the sacrament,  etc. These pulpits were alike in each end of the house. One was for  the use of the Melchisedek or High Priesthood, and the other for the  Aaronic or lesser Priesthood. The first or highest apartment was  occupied by the First Presidency over the whole Church; the second  apartment by the Melchisedek High Priesthood; the third by the  President of the High Priest's Quorum; and the fourth by the President  of the Elders and his two counselors. The highest apartment of the  other pulpit was occupied by the Bishop of the Church and his two  counselors; the next by the President of the Priests and his two  counselors; the third by the President of the Teachers and his two  counselors; and the fourth by the President of the Deacons and his two  counselors.    \"Each of these apartments had curtains hanging from the ceiling over  head down to the top of the pulpit, which could be rolled up or  dropped down at pleasure; and when dropped down would completely  exclude those within the apartment from the sight of all others.

At  length he made his appearance, attended only by his wife. Unmindful of what  had so recently happened, he marched singly up to the governor's house,  and on being refused admittance, though unarmed, attempted to force the  sentinel. The soldier spared him, but the guard was instantly sent for, and  drawn up in front of the house; not that their co-operation was necessary,  but that their appearance might terrify. His ardour now cooled, and he  seemed willing, by submission, to atone for his misconduct. His intrepid  disregard of personal risk, nay of life, could not however, but gain  admiration; though it led us to predict, that this Baneelon, whom  imagination had fondly pictured, like a second Omai, the gaze of a court  and the scrutiny of the curious, would perish untimely, the victim of his  own temerity.    To encourage his present disposition of mind, and to try if feelings of  compassion towards an enemy, could be exerted by an Indian warrior, the  governor ordered him to be taken to the hospital, that he might see the  victim of his ferocity. He complied in sullen silence. When about to enter  the room in which she lay, he appeared to have a momentary struggle with  himself, which ended his resentment. He spoke to her with kindness, and  professed sorrow for what he had done, and promised her future protection.  Barangaroo, who had accompanied him, now took the alarm: and as in shunning  one extreme we are ever likely to rush into another, she thought him  perhaps too courteous and tender. Accordingly she began to revile them both  with great bitterness, threw stones at the girl and attempted to beat her  with a club.    Here terminated this curious history, which I leave to the reader's  speculation. Whether human sacrifices of prisoners be common among them  is a point which all our future inquiry never completely determined. It is  certain that no second instance of this sort was ever witnessed by us.          CHAPTER XII.        Transactions of the Colony in Part of December, 1790.      On the 9th of the month, a sergeant of marines, with three convicts, among  whom was McEntire, the governor's gamekeeper (the person of whom Baneelon  had, on former occasions, shown so much dread and hatred) went out on a  shooting party. Having passed the north arm of Botany Bay, they proceeded  to a hut formed of boughs, which had been lately erected on this peninsula,  for the accommodation of sportsmen who wished to continue by night in the  woods; for, as the kangaroos in the day-time, chiefly keep in the cover, it  is customary on these parties to sleep until near sunset, and watch for the  game during the night, and in the early part of the morning. Accordingly,  having lighted a fire, they lay down, without distrust or suspicion.    About one o'clock, the sergeant was awakened by a rustling noise in the  bushes near him, and supposing it to proceed from a kangaroo, called to his  comrades, who instantly jumped up. On looking about more narrowly, they saw  two natives with spears in their hands, creeping towards them, and three  others a little farther behind. As this naturally created alarm, McEntire  said, \"don't be afraid, I know them,\" and immediately laying down his gun,  stepped forward, and spoke to them in their own language. The Indians,  finding they were discovered, kept slowly retreating, and McEntire  accompanied them about a hundred yards, talking familiarly all the while.    One of them now jumped on a fallen tree and, without giving the least  warning of his intention, launched his spear at McEntire and lodged it in  his left side. The person who committed this wanton act was described as a  young man with a speck or blemish on his left eye That he had been lately  among us was evident from his being newly shaved.    The wounded man immediately drew back and, joining his party, cried, \"I am  a dead man\". While one broke off the end of the spear, the other two set  out with their guns in pursuit of the natives; but their swiftness of foot  soon convinced our people of the impossibility of reaching them. It was now  determined to attempt to carry McEntire home, as his death was apprehended  to be near, and he expressed a longing desire not to be left to expire in  the woods. Being an uncommonly robust muscular man, notwithstanding a great  effusion of blood, he was able, with the assistance of his comrades, to  creep slowly along, and reached Sydney about two o'clock the next morning.  On the wound being examined by the surgeons, it was pronounced mortal.  The poor wretch now began to utter the most dreadful exclamations, and to  accuse himself of the commission of crimes of the deepest dye, accompanied  with such expressions of his despair of God's mercy, as are too terrible to  repeat.    In the course of the day, Colbee, and several more natives came in, and  were taken to the bed where the wounded man lay. Their behaviour indicated  that they had already heard of the accident, as they repeated twice or  thrice the name of the murderer Pimelwi, saying that he lived at Botany  Bay. To gain knowledge of their treatment of similar wounds, one of the  surgeons made signs of extracting the spear, but this they violently  opposed, and said, if it were done, death would instantly follow.    On the 12th, the extraction of the spear was, however, judged practicable,  and was accordingly performed. That part of it which had penetrated the  body measured seven inches and a half long, having on it a wooden barb, and  several smaller ones of stone, fastened on with yellow gum, most of which,  owing to the force necessary in extraction, were torn off and lodged in the  patient. The spear had passed between two ribs, and had wounded the  left lobe of the lungs. He lingered* until the 20th of January, and  then expired. On opening the corpse, it was found that the left lung had  perished from suppuration, its remains adhering to the ribs. Some pieces of  stone, which had dropped from the spear were seen, but no barb of wood.    [*From the aversion uniformly shown by all the natives to this unhappy  man, he had long been suspected by us of having in his excursions, shot  and injured them. To gain information on this head from him, the moment  of contrition was seized. On being questioned with great seriousness, he,  however, declared that he had never fired but once on a native, and then  had not killed, but severely wounded him and this in his own defence.  Notwithstanding this death-bed confession, most people doubted the truth of  the relation, from his general character and other circumstances.]    The governor was at Rose-hill when this accident happened. On the day after  he returned to Sydney, the following order was issued:      Several tribes of the natives still continuing to throw spears at any  man they meet unarmed, by which several have been killed, or dangerously  wounded, the governor, in order to deter the natives from such practices  in future, has ordered out a party to search for the man who wounded  the convict McEntire, in so dangerous a manner on Friday last, though no  offence was offered on his part, in order to make a signal example of that  tribe. At the same time, the governor strictly forbids, under penalty of  the severest punishment, any soldier or other person, not expressly ordered  out for that purpose, ever to fire on any native except in his own defence;  or to molest him in any shape, or to bring away any spears, or other  articles which they may find belonging to those people. The natives will be  made severe examples of whenever any man is wounded by them; but this  will be done in a manner which may satisfy them that it is a punishment  inflicted on them for their own bad conduct, and of which they cannot be  made sensible if they are not treated with kindness while they continue  peaceable and quiet.    A party, consisting of two captains, two subalterns, and forty privates,  with a proper number of non-commissioned officers from the garrison, with  three days provisions, etc. are to be ready to march to-morrow morning at  day-light, in order to bring in six of those natives who reside near the  head of Botany Bay; or, if that should be found impracticable, to put that  number to death.      Just previous to this order being issued, the author of this publication  received a direction to attend the governor at head quarters immediately. I  went, and his excellency informed me that he had pitched upon me to execute  the foregoing command. He added that the two subalterns who were to be  drawn from the marine corps, should be chosen by myself; that the sergeant  and the two convicts who were with McEntire, should attend as guides; that  we were to proceed to the peninsula at the head of Botany Bay; and thence,  or from any part of the north arm of the bay, we were, if practicable, to  bring away two natives as prisoners; and to put to death ten; that we  were to destroy all weapons of war but nothing else; that no hut was to  be burned; that all women and children were to remain uninjured, not being  comprehended within the scope of the order; that our operations were to  be directed either by surprise or open force; that after we had made any  prisoners, all communication, even with those natives with whom we were  in habits of intercourse, was to be avoided, and none of them suffered to  approach us. That we were to cut off and bring in the heads of the slain;  for which purpose hatchets and bags would be furnished. And finally, that  no signal of amity or invitation should be used in order to allure them to  us; or if made on their part, to be answered by us: for that such conduct  would be not only present treachery, but give them reason to distrust every  future mark of peace and friendship on our part.    His excellency was now pleased to enter into the reasons which had induced  him to adopt measures of such severity. He said that "]]]
