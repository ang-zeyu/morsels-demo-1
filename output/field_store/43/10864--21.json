The  weather had turned and frozen so that it had formed a sharp crust and  we were compelled to use the driving method of hunting. One of us  would stand on the runways, in the beds of basins and in low places  on the ridges while the other would follow the trail and drive the  deer through to the hunter. I wish to say right here, that I do not  like this way of hunting deer but little better than I do of hounding  and running deer with dogs. The dog is all right but I want no  dogging of deer for me.    We would get a deer nearly every day. It was now the first of January  and time to get our venison to camp or out to the road where we could  pick them up on the way out to Kane. After we had gathered up the  venison and had gone the rounds of the traps that had not been tended  while hunting, we went to Kane. Here we engaged a team to come in  after the venison and bear and bring in a grub stake to last us until  the middle of March when we would break camp and go home. We both  went back to Kane with the team to assist in getting over some of the  rough places and see that our venison and bear meat was tagged and  shipped all right. Then we came back to camp to put our entire time  in tending to the traps which we did to good advantage. We had found  other good warm springs while hunting, and some that we thought were  lasting springs, had gone dry or had frozen up, so we shifted a good  many of the traps to the other springs.    Then we took it a little easier only going the rounds of the traps as  we considered it necessary and on such days as the weather was  favorable. We waited for February when we knew that the old dog coon  would begin his rounds of calling on his friends.    We managed to pass the time away fairly well as we would get a fox,  mink, marten or something nearly every day so that we busied  ourselves. About the middle of February we had several warm days and  the time had now come for us to get busy and we were out as soon as  it was light. We would follow up all the spring runs until we found  the trail of a coon, then follow it up until it went into a tree.  Sometimes it bothered us which tree to cut down for the coon would go  from one tree to another so that it was hard to tell which was the  tree that was the home of the coon (some call it a den). One day we  chopped down a great large oak, three or four feet in diameter and  nearly sound all the way through and nary a coon to be found. I asked  Bill why he did not say cuss words and he said he thought we had  spent enough wind in chopping the tree down, without wasting any  unnecessarily.    Well, as I said, the coon had been up and down so many trees that we  did not know which one was the most likely one. We went to a large  basswood tree that had only one track going to it and one away from  it but when we pounded on it with the axe, we saw that it was very  hollow. I suggested to Bill that we chop it down. Bill thought there  were no coon in it and I had but little faith myself but I told him  that as he had been wanting a wood job, here was his opportunity and  Bill agreed with me, so we laid off our coats and went to chopping.  The tree was only a shell. We soon had it down and to our surprise,  coon began to run in all directions. Not having had much hopes of  finding any coon in the tree we had not prepared ourselves with clubs  to kill the coon. We used the axe handle as best we could but one  coon got away and went into a hollow stump which we had to cut down.  We got five coon. We then took up the trail of the coon that left the  tree and after following it about a mile it went into a large hemlock  tree that had a hole in it close to the roots. Pounding on it we  discovered that it was hollow.    There had been several coon tracks both out and into the tree. We  circled around some distance from the tree and found no tracks  leading away from the tree farther than a small spring a few rods  away. As it was getting well on towards night we did not fell the  tree but went back to the old basswood where we had left the coons  and took them and went to camp. Bill said that he had a dash-dang  sight rather chop wood than to tote those three coons. I carried two  and told Bill not to complain and I would let him skin all of them  when we got to camp. He said, \"Oh, you are a clever jade, aint you?\"  We skinned the coon that evening but did not stretch the skin until  the next afternoon after we had gone out and cut the hemlock and got  three more.    We kept up this coon hunt as long as we could find any tracks. It was  now getting along into March and we had written home for a team to  come in and take our camp outfit and furs out. As we had not been out  over the road through the woods, the way we came in, we made a trip  out to the main wagon road so that the man who came after us would  have no trouble in following the trail to the camp. We now began to  spring all the deadfalls that we had set for marten, mink and coon  and take up all of the steel traps as we had written to the man to be  there about the fifteenth of the month. I think it was a day or two  later when the team came and our hunt on the Kinzua was ended.    We got some thirty odd deer and either five or six bear and I think  four otter. I do not remember the number of fox, mink, marten and  coon, but we did well for there had been but very little trapping  done in that locality at that time and furbearing animals were quite  plentiful. I have never been back to that camp since. I gave the camp  to a man by the name of Ball.        CHAPTER VIII.    Fred and the Old Trapper.    Yes, Fred, you can go with me to attend my traps, come down early as  I wish to start at 5 o'clock.\" Fred was on hand next morning at the  appointed hour. We leave the road here and go up this stream; this  will take us to several traps and also to camp.    \"Are these woods very large?\"    \"Yes, Fred. It is about fourteen miles either way through them.\"    \"Does any one live in them?\"    \"No one only the lumberman. Well, Fred, here is the first trap.\"    \"I don't see any trap.\"    \"No, but it is there, just in front of that little stone pen; the  bait is in the pen.\"    \"Why don't you take that bush away?\"    \"Oh! that is part of the knack in trapping; see that is just far  enough from the pen to let the animal pass through.\"    \"Oh! I see, and it will step in the trap in going through!\"    \"That is it, exactly.\"    \"Won't the water take the brush away?\"    \"Yes, if it gets too high, but you will see that I have put some  heavy stones on the limbs that are down in the water; you also see  that I turn the water above the trap by throwing up a few stones;  this is done to keep the water so that it just covers the traps. You  see that bunch of leaves that are a little higher than the rest of  the leaves--the pan of the trap is just under those leaves.\"    \"Did that moss grow on the stone pen?\"    \"No, I put it there to make the pen look old; you see a fox can  easily step on that bunch of dry leaves that are on the pan of the  trap from the bank. A fox does not like new things. You see this trap  is set for mink, coon or fox, whichever may happen along.\"    \"What is the trap fastened to?\"    \"See that limb that has moss all grown over it. The trap is stapled  to it.\"    \"Can't a fox or coon drag it away?\"    \"Yes, but not far. See the chain is stapled about the middle of the  limb, and the animal would not go far before it got fast.    \"Fred, you get that rabbit out of the knapsack that we took out of  the snare, and we will put some fresh bait in the pen for this is  getting too stale; mink and coon do not like rotten meat. Cut it into  several pieces so that the animal can not get it all at once. There,  that is all right, and let us hurry on to the next trap. Here it is  and a mink in it and drowned.\"    \"Where is the pen? I do not see it.\"    \"We do not always have a pen. You see that notch in that log where  the water runs over? That is where the trap was set. See this hay  wire that is fastened to the trap chain and which is fastened to that  stone out in the deep water? The mink could not go toward the bank so  it went into the deep water and was drowned.\"    \"Why did you set a double spring trap here?\"    \"Well, Fred, an otter might happen along and that is just the place  to catch it. You see above the log I have fixed to gage the water as  at the other trap. I do this so the water will not wash the covering  from the trap, or get so deep over the trap that the animal will not  spring it when going over it.\" \"I see that you have got those brush  on either side of the trap with just enough space for the animal to  pass through over the trap.\" \"That is correct, you are catching on,  Fred, all right.\"    \"Don't you use bait where you set a trap in this way?\"    \"Not often; sometimes I fasten a fish with a horse-hair with a hook  fast to it so that you can hook it to the lower jaw and fasten it in  the water just above the trap; water keeps it moving and attracts the  animal. We have got this trap set all right and will now move on to  the next. We will take the mink to the next trap before skinning it.\"    \"What is that over yonder on the other side of the creek?\"    \"That is a coon and it is in a trap. Fred, you take my cane and kill  it while I fix up the bait pen, for it has torn things up as bad as a  bear would.\"    \"Why did you not use stones to build this pen?\"    \"Old chunks are just as good and much handier to get, and there was  plenty of moss on the old logs near to cover it with.\"    \"Why do you not use old bushy limbs here?\"    \"You see this trap sets in the mouth of a small spring run; we will  cut some little twigs and stick them up in the ground, in place of  the brush, to make the runway, as we call it. We will now skin the  mink. Rip straight down the hind leg from the heel "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3407"],[0,"The Spell of Egypt (#17)"],[1,"finished. That may be so. But for all that it was one of the  most finished things in Egypt, essentially a thing to inspire within one  the \"perfect calm that is Greek.\" The blighting touch of the Nile, which  has changed the beautiful pale yellow of the stone of the lower part  of the building to a hideous and dreary grey--which made me think of  a steel knife on which liquid has been spilt and allowed to run--has  destroyed the uniformity, the balance, the faultless melody lifted up by  form and color. And so it is with the temple. It is, as it were, cut in  two by the intrusion into it of this hideous, mottled complexion left by  the receded water. Everywhere one sees disease on the walls and columns,  almost blotting out bas-reliefs, giving to their active figures a  morbid, a sickly look. The effect is specially distressing in the open  court that precedes the temple dedicated to the Lady of Philae. In this  court, which is at the southern end of the island, the Nile at certain  seasons is now forced to rise very nearly as high as the capitals of  many of the columns. The consequence of this is that here the disease  seems making rapid strides. One feels it is drawing near to the heart,  and that the poor, doomed invalid may collapse at any moment.    Yes, there is much to make one sad at Philae. But how much of pure  beauty there is left--of beauty that merely protests against any further  outrage!    As there is something epic in the grandeur of the Lotus Hall at Karnak,  so there is something lyrical in the soft charm of the Philae temple.  Certain things or places, certain things in certain places, always  suggest to my mind certain people in whose genius I take delight--who  have won me, and moved me by their art. Whenever I go to Philae, the  name of Shelley comes to me. I scarcely could tell why. I have no  special reason to connect Shelley with Philae. But when I see that  almost airy loveliness of stone, so simply elegant, so, somehow,  spring-like in its pale-colored beauty, its happy, daffodil charm, with  its touch of the Greek--the sensitive hand from Attica stretched out  over Nubia--I always think of Shelley. I think of Shelley the youth who  dived down into the pool so deep that it seemed he was lost for ever to  the sun. I think of Shelley the poet, full of a lyric ecstasy, who was  himself like an embodied         \"Longing for something afar       From the sphere of our sorrow.\"    Lyrical Philae is like a temple of dreams, and of all poets Shelley  might have dreamed the dream and have told it to the world in a song.    For all its solidity, there are a strange lightness and grace in the  temple of Philae; there is an elegance you will not find in the other  temples of Egypt. But it is an elegance quite undefiled by weakness,  by any sentimentality. (Even a building, like a love-lorn maid, can be  sentimental.) Edward FitzGerald once defined taste as the feminine of  genius. Taste prevails in Philae, a certain delicious femininity that  seduces the eyes and the heart of man. Shall we call it the spirit of  Isis?    I have heard a clever critic and antiquarian declare that he is not very  fond of Philae; that he feels a certain \"spuriousness\" in the temple due  to the mingling of Greek with Egyptian influences. He may be right. I  am no antiquarian, and, as a mere lover of beauty, I do not feel this  \"spuriousness.\" I can see neither two quarrelling strengths nor any  weakness caused by division. I suppose I see only the beauty, as I might  see only the beauty of a women bred of a handsome father and mother  of different races, and who, not typical of either, combined in her  features and figure distinguishing merits of both. It is true that there  is a particular pleasure which is roused in us only by the absolutely  typical--the completely thoroughbred person or thing. It may be a  pleasure not caused by beauty, and it may be very keen, nevertheless.  When it is combined with the joy roused in us by all beauty, it is a  very pure emotion of exceptional delight. Philae does not, perhaps, give  this emotion. But it certainly has a lovableness that attaches the heart  in a quite singular degree. The Philae-lover is the most faithful of  lovers. The hold of his mistress upon him, once it has been felt, is  never relaxed. And in his affection for Philae there is, I think, nearly  always a rainbow strain of romance.    When we love anything, we love to be able to say of the object of our  devotion, \"There is nothing like it.\" Now, in all Egypt, and I suppose  in all the world there is nothing just like Philae. There are temples,  yes; but where else is there a bouquet of gracious buildings such as  these gathered in such a holder as this tiny, raft-like isle? And  where else are just such delicate and, as I have said, light and almost  feminine elegance and charm set in the midst of such severe sterility?  Once, beyond Philae, the great Cataract roared down from the wastes of  Nubia into the green fertility of Upper Egypt. It roars no longer. But  still the masses of the rocks, and still the amber and the yellow sands,  and still the iron-colored hills, keep guard round Philae. And still,  despite the vulgar desecration that has turned Shellal into a workmen's  suburb and dowered it with a railway-station, there is a mystery in  Philae, and the sense of isolation that only an island gives. Even now  one can forget in Philae--forget, after a while, and in certain parts of  its buildings, the presence of the grey disease; forget the threatening  of the altruists, who desire to benefit humanity by clearing as much  beauty out of humanity's abiding-place as possible; forget the fact of  the railway, except when the shriek of the engine floats over the water  to one's ears; forget economic problems, and the destruction that their  solving brings upon the silent world of things whose \"use,\" denied,  unrecognized, or laughed at, to man is in their holy beauty, whose  mission lies not upon the broad highways where tramps the hungry body,  but upon the secret, shadowy byways where glides the hungry soul.    Yes, one can forget even now in the hall of the temple of Isis, where  the capricious graces of color, where, like old and delicious music in  the golden strings of a harp, dwells a something--what is it? A murmur,  or a perfume, or a breathing?--of old and vanished years when forsaken  gods were worshipped. And one can forget in the chapel of Hathor, on  whose wall little Horus is born, and in the grey hounds' chapel beside  it. One can forget, for one walks in beauty.    Lovely are the doorways in Philae, enticing are the shallow steps that  lead one onward and upward; gracious the yellow towers that seem to  smile a quiet welcome. And there is one chamber that is simply a place  of magic--the hall of the flowers.    It is this chamber which always makes me think of Philae as a lovely  temple of dreams, this silent, retired chamber, where some fabled  princess might well have been touched to a long, long sleep of  enchantment, and lain for years upon years among the magical  flowers--the lotus, and the palm, and the papyrus.    In my youth it made upon me an indelible impression. Through intervening  years, filled with many new impressions, many wanderings, many visions  of beauty in other lands, that retired, painted chamber had not faded  from my mind--or shall I say from my heart? There had seemed to me  within it something that was ineffable, as in a lyric of Shelley's there  is something that is ineffable, or in certain pictures of Boecklin,  such as \"The Villa by the Sea.\" And when at last, almost afraid and  hesitating, I came into it once more, I found in it again the strange  spell of old enchantment.    It seems as if this chamber had been imagined by a poet, who had set  it in the centre of the temple of his dreams. It is such a spontaneous  chamber that one can scarcely imagine it more than a day and a night in  the building. Yet in detail it is lovely; it is finished and strangely  mighty; it is a lyric in stone, the most poetical chamber, perhaps, in  the whole of Egypt. For Philae I count in Egypt, though really it is in  Nubia.    One who has not seen Philae may perhaps wonder how a tall chamber of  solid stone, containing heavy and soaring columns, can be like a lyric  of Shelley's, can be exquisitely spontaneous, and yet hold a something  of mystery that makes one tread softly in it, and fear to disturb within  it some lovely sleeper of Nubia, some Princess of the Nile. He must  continue to wonder. To describe this chamber calmly, as I might, for  instance, describe the temple of Derr, would be simply to destroy it.  For things ineffable cannot be fully explained, or not be fully felt  by those the twilight of whose dreams is fitted to mingle with their  twilight. They who are meant to love with ardor _se passionnent pour  la passion_. And they who are meant to take and to keep the spirit of a  dream, whether it be hidden in a poem, or held in the cup of a flower,  or enfolded in arms of stone, will surely never miss it, even though  they can hear roaring loudly above its elfin voice the cry of directed  waters rushing down to Upper Egypt.    How can one disentangle from their tapestry web the different threads of  a spell? And even if one could, if one could hold them up, and explain,  \"The cause of the spell is that this comes in contact with this, and  that this, which I show you, blends with, fades into, this,\" how could  it advantage any one? Nothing could be made clearer, nothing be really  explained. The ineffable is, and must ever remain, something remote and  mysterious.    And so one may say many things of this painted chamber of Philae, and  yet never convey, perhaps never really know, the innermost cause of its  charm. In it there is obvious beauty of form, and a seizing beauty  of color, beauty of sunlight and shadow, of antique association. This  turquoise blue"]]]
