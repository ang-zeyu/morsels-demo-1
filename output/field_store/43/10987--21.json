The municipality, knowing that their great leader was penniless, had  gathered a small sum of money and forced him to accept it before he  left. He felt that the other exiles were in as great need of it as he,  and so quietly distributed it among them through friends on the various  ships that were bearing the exiles away. He had thought of the people as  his children for so long a time that he had still to take the care of  them upon himself.    The little family of four felt that it was farewell as they watched the  palaces and churches, towers and pillars of the City of the Lagunes  drop beneath the horizon. The view of Venice from the sea, incomparably  beautiful, must have been unspeakably sad to Manin's eyes.    When they arrived at Marseilles the devoted wife fell ill of cholera,  and, worn out with the long siege, was powerless to resist. She had  written on leaving Venice, \"All is over, all is lost save honor! I am  going to a foreign land, where I shall hear a language not my own. My  beautiful language, I shall never hear it again; never more!\" She died  soon after reaching Marseilles.    Manin took his two children with him to Paris, and gave himself up to  nursing the little girl, who was the victim of a continual nervous  disorder. The daughter and father were united by a bond of love that was  wonderfully strong and spiritual, they seemed to understand each other  always without words. He kept a little note-book record of her illness  as an aid to the physicians, and after his death the book was found  with the touching inscription on the cover, \"Alla mia Santa Martire.\"  Her desire to comfort her father sustained her for some years, she knew  that she had become to him in a spiritual manner the living image of  his unhappy country. She struggled with all the heroism of a remarkable  character to hide her sufferings from him even as he sought to hide from  her the anguish her illness caused him. Daniel and Emilia Manin were  worthy to be father and daughter, both were heroic souls. In 1854 Emilia  died, her last words, \"My darling Venice, I shall never see you again!\"    Manin and his son stayed on in the French capital, the father giving  lessons in Italian for support. He had harbored no resentment against  France for her failure to come to the aid of Venice, he felt that  the French people were near kin to his own. He welcomed all Italians  or sympathizers with Italy, he predicted that eventually the entire  peninsula would be one in freedom. He met Cavour in Paris and talked  long about Venice with him, he was gradually becoming convinced that  Piedmont could and would lead the other states to victory. His study  was hung with portraits of the most dissimilar characters, all one in  interest for his country, Charles Albert opposite to Mazzini, Garibaldi  opposite Gioberti, Montanelli near D'Azeglio. He wrote articles on Italy  for the papers and traveled in England to arouse British interest in  his cause. It was a great day when he saw the Italian tri-color flying  beside the French and English flags to show that Piedmont had joined  the allies in the Crimean war. \"In serving under the tri-colored flag  of Italian redemption,\" he wrote, \"the soldiers who fight in the Crimea  are not the soldiers of the Piedmontese province, but the soldiers of  Italy.\" He understood the boldness of Cavour's great diplomatic stroke  and gave Piedmont the credit she deserved in becoming the first envoy of  a great nation.    While his strength lasted Manin worked in the cause, but finally he  was overcome by physical sufferings. He wrote in June, 1857, to his  friend the Marquis Pallavicino, \"A month's rest in the country has not  calmed the fever of my poor brain. All work, all meditation, is utterly  impossible to me. Not only cannot I think about serious things, but I  am not able to give my mind to the most unimportant matters. This will  explain my silence. I lose patience and hope. My painful and useless  life becomes intolerable. I ardently desire the end. Farewell.\" The  physical weariness with which he had battled all his life was at last  overpowering him. He still believed that his principles would ultimately  conquer, but knew that he should not see Venice freed. September 22,  1857, he died, at the age of fifty-three years.    August 30, 1849, Radetzky and the Austrians had entered Venice, replaced  the Lion banner of St. Mark with the yellow and black flag of Austria,  and had expected to see the pleasure-loving city sink back into its  former quiescent indolence. What they expected did not come to pass.  Instead for seventeen years Venice mourned its lost liberty and lived  only in the thought of that day when it should rise again and finally.  There was no shame in this subjection, no happy compromise. This was  Manin's achievement, he had made his people worthy to be free. That was  the purpose of his heroic struggle, the lesson of his life.    July 5, 1866, the yellow and black flag of Austria fell from the _pili_,  and October 18 of that same year the red, white, and green flag of  united Italy greeted a free Venice. There was one wish in the people's  heart, that only their \"dear father Manin\" might have lived to see that  glorious day.    The remains of Manin, his wife and daughter, lie now close to the Church  of St. Mark, his statue looks down upon the people in the square before  his house even as he so often stood on the Palace balcony to speak to  them in the days of 1849. All through Venice there are reminders of  him, and he has taken his place among the great heroes of that historic  city--himself her greatest hero, her sincerest patriot. The simple  advocate, the great President, the \"dear father\" of the Venetian people.          [Illustration: MAZZINI]          MAZZINI, THE PROPHET      Some men become legendary during their own lives. Their personalities  have a certain detachment from the rest of the world so that common  standards have no value as applied to them. They are poets or seers or  philosophers, and often their mystic quality is of little use to the  great mass of men, and is only to be appreciated by the few. Sometimes  the whole world understands them. Mazzini had become a legend to the  people of Europe long before his death, but a legend that carried the  strongest personal appeal to every republican heart. You have only to  dip into letters of the time to realize how close he came to millions of  thinkers throughout Europe.    It would be interesting to consider the force of popular legend in a  national movement, to weigh sentiment against statesmanship and military  prowess. The land of Dante and of Savonarola would be an especially  fertile field for such inquiry, among no people has the prophet been  held of higher value than with the Italians. To-day we find them turning  to their dramatists and novelists for help in the solution of new social  problems just as Mazzini and the youth of his day looked to Alfieri  for political guidance. There is no doubt that Mazzini believed it was  his destiny to be a poet, and that throughout his whole life he looked  forward to the day when Italy should be united and free, and he could  turn to the work of writing her dramas.    Literary feuds play so little part in Anglo-Saxon history that we find  it difficult to understand the importance of their place in Latin  countries. Italy a century ago was the battle-ground of the Romanticists  and Classicists. The Classicists believed in a certain smug cloistered  virtue, a policy of non-resistance, and the contemplation of past  glories. It was the ambition of the Romanticists \"to give Italians an  original national literature, not one that is as a sound of passing  music to tickle the ear and die, but one that will interpret to them  their aspirations, their ideas, their needs, their social movement.\"  Alfieri had been preaching resistance to Austrian tyranny through his  dramas, the boy Mazzini first looked to him as a political saviour of  Italy. He wrote, \"these literary disputes are bound up with all that  is important in social and civil life,\" and again \"the legislation and  literature of a people always advance on parallel lines.\" \"Young Italy\"  first hoped to win freedom through its literature.    The ill-fated Carbonari rebellion of 1821 sent many Piedmontese patriots  flying through Genoa to Spain. Giuseppe Mazzini, then sixteen years of  age, walking from church one Sunday morning in Genoa in company with  his mother, was stopped by a tall, gaunt-featured, black-eyed man who  held out his hat asking alms for \"the refugees of Italy.\" The scene  made a tremendous impression on the youth's mind, for the first time he  felt that the cause of freedom was not a scholastic subject, but one  demanding the height of sacrifice. He set himself to study the causes of  the failure of past uprisings, and at the same time dedicated himself to  the work of teaching his countrymen how they might succeed.    The French Revolution had failed because it had taught men only a  knowledge of their rights, without any conception of their duties. Men  had not learned the law of self-restraint, and their ideal was the  greatest personal liberty rather than the greatest personal obligation  to their fellow-men. The revolutionists of Europe had a philosophy,  but no religion. The first great discovery that Mazzini made was that  if Italy were ever to be united, his countrymen must be fired with  faith in their own God-given destinies. They must make of their cause  a religion, they must learn, in his words, that Italy \"had a strength  within her, that was arbiter of facts, mightier than destiny itself.\"  At the start he offered his countrymen two arguments for action, the one  that this land of theirs had twice ruled the world, that she who had  given Christianity and the Renaissance to Europe had yet to send"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4361"],[0,"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman — Complete (#17)"],[1," a  preemption to the quarter-section of land at Coloma.  Marshall  returned to the mill, but could not keep out of his wonderful  ditch, and by some means the other men employed there learned his  secret.  They then wanted to gather the gold, and Marshall  threatened to shoot them if they attempted it; but these men had  sense enough to know that if \"placer\"-gold existed at Coloma, it  would also be found farther down-stream, and they gradually  \"prospected\" until they reached Mormon Island, fifteen miles below,  where they discovered one of the richest placers on earth.  These  men revealed the fact to some other Mormons who were employed by  Captain Sutter at a grist-mill he was building still lower down the  American Fork, and six miles above his fort.  All of them struck  for higher wages, to which Sutter yielded, until they asked ten  dollars a day, which he refused, and the two mills on which he had  spent so much money were never built, and fell into decay.      In my opinion, when the Mormons were driven from Nauvoo, Illinois,  in 1844, they cast about for a land where they would not be  disturbed again, and fixed on California.  In the year 1845 a ship,  the Brooklyn, sailed from New York for California, with a colony of  Mormons, of which Sam Brannan was the leader, and we found them  there on our arrival in January, 1847.  When General Kearney, at  Fort Leavenworth, was collecting volunteers early in 1846, for the  Mexican War, he, through the instrumentality of Captain James  Allen, brother to our quartermaster, General Robert Allen, raised  the battalion of Mormons at Kanesville, Iowa, now Council Bluffs,  on the express understanding that it would facilitate their  migration to California.  But when the Mormons reached Salt Lake,  in 1846, they learned that they had been forestalled by the United  States forces in California, and they then determined to settle  down where they were.  Therefore, when this battalion of five  companies of Mormons (raised by Allen, who died on the way, and was  succeeded by Cooke) was discharged at Los Angeles, California, in  the early summer of 1847, most of the men went to their people at  Salt Lake, with all the money received, as pay from the United  States, invested in cattle and breeding-horses; one company  reenlisted for another year, and the remainder sought work in the  country.  As soon as the fame of the gold discovery spread through  California, the Mormons naturally turned to Mormon Island, so that  in July, 1848, we found about three hundred of them there at work.  Sam Brannan was on hand as the high-priest, collecting the tithes.  Clark, of Clark's Point, an early pioneer, was there also, and  nearly all the Mormons who had come out in the Brooklyn, or who had  staid in California after the discharge of their battalion, had  collected there.  I recall the scene as perfectly to-day as though  it were yesterday.  In the midst of a broken country, all parched  and dried by the hot sun of July, sparsely wooded with live-oaks  and straggling pines, lay the valley of the American River, with  its bold mountain-stream coming out of the Snowy Mountains to the  east.  In this valley is a fiat, or gravel-bed, which in high water  is an island, or is overflown, but at the time of our visit was  simply a level gravel-bed of the river.  On its edges men were  digging, and filling buckets with the finer earth and gravel, which  was carried to a machine made like a baby's cradle, open at the  foot, and at the head a plate of sheet-iron or zinc, punctured full  of holes.  On this metallic plate was emptied the earth, and water  was then poured on it from buckets, while one man shook the cradle  with violent rocking by a handle.  On the bottom were nailed cleats  of wood.  With this rude machine four men could earn from forty to  one hundred dollars a day, averaging sixteen dollars, or a gold  ounce, per man per day.  While the' sun blazed down on the heads of  the miners with tropical heat, the water was bitter cold, and all  hands were either standing in the water or had their clothes wet  all the time; yet there were no complaints of rheumatism or cold.  We made our camp on a small knoll, a little below the island, and  from it could overlook the busy scene.  A few bush-huts near by  served as stores, boardinghouses, and for sleeping; but all hands  slept on the ground, with pine-leaves and blankets for bedding.  As  soon as the news spread that the Governor was there, persons came  to see us, and volunteered all kinds of information, illustrating  it by samples of the gold, which was of a uniform kind,  \"scale-gold,\" bright and beautiful.  A large variety, of every  conceivable shape and form, was found in the smaller gulches round  about, but the gold in the river-bed was uniformly \"scale-gold.\"  I  remember that Mr. Clark was in camp, talking to Colonel Mason about  matters and things generally, when he inquired, \"Governor, what  business has Sam Brannan to collect the tithes here?\"  Clark  admitted that Brannan was the head of the Mormon church in  California, and he was simply questioning as to Brannan's right, as  high-priest, to compel the Mormons to pay him the regular tithes.  Colonel Mason answered, \"Brannan has a perfect right to collect the  tax, if you Mormons are fools enough to pay it.\"   \"Then,\" said  Clark, \"I for one won't pay it any longer.\"  Colonel Mason added:  \"This is public land, and the gold is the property of the United  States; all of you here are trespassers, but, as the Government is  benefited by your getting out the gold, I do not intend to  interfere.\"  I understood, afterward, that from that time the  payment of the tithes ceased, but Brannan had already collected  enough money wherewith to hire Sutter's hospital, and to open a  store there, in which he made more money than any merchant in  California, during that summer and fall. The understanding was, that  the money collected by him as tithes was the foundation of his  fortune, which is still very large in San Francisco.  That evening  we all mingled freely with the miners, and witnessed the process of  cleaning up and \"panning\" out, which is the last process for  separating the pure gold from the fine dirt and black sand.    The next day we continued our journey up the valley of the American  Fork, stopping at various camps, where mining was in progress; and  about noon we reached Coloma, the place where gold had been first  discovered.  The hills were higher, and the timber of better  quality.  The river was narrower and bolder, and but few miners  were at work there, by reason of  Marshall's and Sutter's claim to  the site.  There stood the sawmill unfinished, the dam and  tail-race just as they were left when the Mormons ceased work.  Marshall and Wimmer's family of wife and half a dozen children were  there, guarding their supposed treasure; living in a house made of  clapboards.  Here also we were shown many specimens of gold, of a  coarser grain than that found at Mormon Island.  The next day we  crossed the American River to its north side, and visited many  small camps of men, in what were called the \"dry diggings.\"  Little  pools of water stood in the beds of the streams, and these were  used to wash the dirt; and there the gold was in every conceivable  shape and size, some of the specimens weighing several ounces.  Some of these \"diggings\" were extremely rich, but as a whole they  were more precarious in results than at the river.  Sometimes a  lucky fellow would hit on a \"pocket,\" and collect several thousand  dollars in a few days, and then again he would be shifting about  from place to place, \"prospecting,\" and spending all he had made.  Little stores were being opened at every point, where flour, bacon,  etc., were sold; every thing being a dollar a pound, and a meal  usually costing three dollars.  Nobody paid for a bed, for he slept  on the ground, without fear of cold or rain.  We spent nearly a  week in that region, and were quite bewildered by the fabulous  tales of recent discoveries, which at the time were confined to the  several forks of the American and Yuba Rivers.' All this time our  horses had nothing to eat but the sparse grass in that region, and  we were forced to work our way down toward the Sacramento Valley,  or to see our animals perish.  Still we contemplated a visit to the  Yuba and Feather Rivers, from which we had heard of more wonderful  \"diggings;\" but met a courier, who announced the arrival of a ship  at Monterey, with dispatches of great importance from Mazatlan.  We  accordingly turned our horses back to Sutter's Fort.  Crossing the  Sacramento again by swimming our horses, and ferrying their loads  in that solitary canoe, we took our back track as far as the Napa,  and then turned to Benicia, on Carquinez Straits.  We found there a  solitary adobe-house, occupied by Mr. Hastings and his family,  embracing Dr. Semple, the proprietor of the ferry.  This ferry was  a ship's-boat, with a latteen-sail, which could carry across at one  time six or eight horses.    It took us several days to cross over, and during that time we got  well acquainted with the doctor, who was quite a character.  He had  come to California from Illinois, and was brother to Senator  Semple.  He was about seven feet high, and very intelligent.  When  we first reached Monterey, he had a printing-press, which belonged  to the United States, having been captured at the custom-house, and  had been used to print custom-house blanks.  With this Dr. Semple,  as editor, published the Californian, a small sheet of news, once a  week; and it was a curiosity in its line, using two v's for a w,  and other combinations of letters, made necessary by want of type.  After some time he removed to Yerba Buena with his paper, and it  grew up to be the Alta California of today.  Foreseeing, as he  thought, the growth of a great city somewhere on the Bay of San  Francisco, he"]]]
