What this Cause is will be shewed  in the next Book.    To these Experiments may be added the tenth Experiment of the first Part  of this first Book, where the Sun's Light in a dark Room being  trajected through the parallel Superficies of two Prisms tied together  in the form of a Parallelopipede, became totally of one uniform yellow  or red Colour, at its emerging out of the Prisms. Here, in the  production of these Colours, the Confine of Shadow can have nothing to  do. For the Light changes from white to yellow, orange and red  successively, without any alteration of the Confine of Shadow: And at  both edges of the emerging Light where the contrary Confines of Shadow  ought to produce different Effects, the Colour is one and the same,  whether it be white, yellow, orange or red: And in the middle of the  emerging Light, where there is no Confine of Shadow at all, the Colour  is the very same as at the edges, the whole Light at its very first  Emergence being of one uniform Colour, whether white, yellow, orange or  red, and going on thence perpetually without any change of Colour, such  as the Confine of Shadow is vulgarly supposed to work in refracted Light  after its Emergence. Neither can these Colours arise from any new  Modifications of the Light by Refractions, because they change  successively from white to yellow, orange and red, while the Refractions  remain the same, and also because the Refractions are made contrary ways  by parallel Superficies which destroy one another's Effects. They arise  not therefore from any Modifications of Light made by Refractions and  Shadows, but have some other Cause. What that Cause is we shewed above  in this tenth Experiment, and need not here repeat it.    There is yet another material Circumstance of this Experiment. For this  emerging Light being by a third Prism HIK [in _Fig._ 22. _Part_ I.][I]  refracted towards the Paper PT, and there painting the usual Colours of  the Prism, red, yellow, green, blue, violet: If these Colours arose from  the Refractions of that Prism modifying the Light, they would not be in  the Light before its Incidence on that Prism. And yet in that Experiment  we found, that when by turning the two first Prisms about their common  Axis all the Colours were made to vanish but the red; the Light which  makes that red being left alone, appeared of the very same red Colour  before its Incidence on the third Prism. And in general we find by other  Experiments, that when the Rays which differ in Refrangibility are  separated from one another, and any one Sort of them is considered  apart, the Colour of the Light which they compose cannot be changed by  any Refraction or Reflexion whatever, as it ought to be were Colours  nothing else than Modifications of Light caused by Refractions, and  Reflexions, and Shadows. This Unchangeableness of Colour I am now to  describe in the following Proposition.      _PROP._ II. THEOR. II.    _All homogeneal Light has its proper Colour answering to its Degree of  Refrangibility, and that Colour cannot be changed by Reflexions and  Refractions._    In the Experiments of the fourth Proposition of the first Part of this  first Book, when I had separated the heterogeneous Rays from one  another, the Spectrum _pt_ formed by the separated Rays, did in the  Progress from its End _p_, on which the most refrangible Rays fell, unto  its other End _t_, on which the least refrangible Rays fell, appear  tinged with this Series of Colours, violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow,  orange, red, together with all their intermediate Degrees in a continual  Succession perpetually varying. So that there appeared as many Degrees  of Colours, as there were sorts of Rays differing in Refrangibility.    _Exper._ 5. Now, that these Colours could not be changed by Refraction,  I knew by refracting with a Prism sometimes one very little Part of this  Light, sometimes another very little Part, as is described in the  twelfth Experiment of the first Part of this Book. For by this  Refraction the Colour of the Light was never changed in the least. If  any Part of the red Light was refracted, it remained totally of the same  red Colour as before. No orange, no yellow, no green or blue, no other  new Colour was produced by that Refraction. Neither did the Colour any  ways change by repeated Refractions, but continued always the same red  entirely as at first. The like Constancy and Immutability I found also  in the blue, green, and other Colours. So also, if I looked through a  Prism upon any Body illuminated with any part of this homogeneal Light,  as in the fourteenth Experiment of the first Part of this Book is  described; I could not perceive any new Colour generated this way. All  Bodies illuminated with compound Light appear through Prisms confused,  (as was said above) and tinged with various new Colours, but those  illuminated with homogeneal Light appeared through Prisms neither less  distinct, nor otherwise colour'd, than when viewed with the naked Eyes.  Their Colours were not in the least changed by the Refraction of the  interposed Prism. I speak here of a sensible Change of Colour: For the  Light which I here call homogeneal, being not absolutely homogeneal,  there ought to arise some little Change of Colour from its  Heterogeneity. But, if that Heterogeneity was so little as it might be  made by the said Experiments of the fourth Proposition, that Change was  not sensible, and therefore in Experiments, where Sense is Judge, ought  to be accounted none at all.    _Exper._ 6. And as these Colours were not changeable by Refractions, so  neither were they by Reflexions. For all white, grey, red, yellow,  green, blue, violet Bodies, as Paper, Ashes, red Lead, Orpiment, Indico  Bise, Gold, Silver, Copper, Grass, blue Flowers, Violets, Bubbles of  Water tinged with various Colours, Peacock's Feathers, the Tincture of  _Lignum Nephriticum_, and such-like, in red homogeneal Light appeared  totally red, in blue Light totally blue, in green Light totally green,  and so of other Colours. In the homogeneal Light of any Colour they all  appeared totally of that same Colour, with this only Difference, that  some of them reflected that Light more strongly, others more faintly. I  never yet found any Body, which by reflecting homogeneal Light could  sensibly change its Colour.    From all which it is manifest, that if the Sun's Light consisted of but  one sort of Rays, there would be but one Colour in the whole World, nor  would it be possible to produce any new Colour by Reflexions and  Refractions, and by consequence that the variety of Colours depends upon  the Composition of Light.      _DEFINITION._    The homogeneal Light and Rays which appear red, or rather make Objects  appear so, I call Rubrifick or Red-making; those which make Objects  appear yellow, green, blue, and violet, I call Yellow-making,  Green-making, Blue-making, Violet-making, and so of the rest. And if at  any time I speak of Light and Rays as coloured or endued with Colours, I  would be understood to speak not philosophically and properly, but  grossly, and accordingly to such Conceptions as vulgar People in seeing  all these Experiments would be apt to frame. For the Rays to speak  properly are not coloured. In them there is nothing else than a certain  Power and Disposition to stir up a Sensation of this or that Colour.  For as Sound in a Bell or musical String, or other sounding Body, is  nothing but a trembling Motion, and in the Air nothing but that Motion  propagated from the Object, and in the Sensorium 'tis a Sense of that  Motion under the Form of Sound; so Colours in the Object are nothing but  a Disposition to reflect this or that sort of Rays more copiously than  the rest; in the Rays they are nothing but their Dispositions to  propagate this or that Motion into the Sensorium, and in the Sensorium  they are Sensations of those Motions under the Forms of Colours.      _PROP._ III. PROB. I.    _To define the Refrangibility of the several sorts of homogeneal Light  answering to the several Colours._    For determining this Problem I made the following Experiment.[J]    _Exper._ 7. When I had caused the Rectilinear Sides AF, GM, [in _Fig._  4.] of the Spectrum of Colours made by the Prism to be distinctly  defined, as in the fifth Experiment of the first Part of this Book is  described, there were found in it all the homogeneal Colours in the same  Order and Situation one among another as in the Spectrum of simple  Light, described in the fourth Proposition of that Part. For the Circles  of which the Spectrum of compound Light PT is composed, and which in  the middle Parts of the Spectrum interfere, and are intermix'd with one  another, are not intermix'd in their outmost Parts where they touch  those Rectilinear Sides AF and GM. And therefore, in those Rectilinear  Sides when distinctly defined, there is no new Colour generated by  Refraction. I observed also, that if any where between the two outmost  Circles TMF and PGA a Right Line, as [Greek: gd], was cross to the  Spectrum, so as both Ends to fall perpendicularly upon its Rectilinear  Sides, there appeared one and the same Colour, and degree of Colour from  one End of this Line to the other. I delineated therefore in a Paper the  Perimeter of the Spectrum FAP GMT, and in trying the third Experiment of  the first Part of this Book, I held the Paper so that the Spectrum might  fall upon this delineated Figure, and agree with it exactly, whilst an  Assistant, whose Eyes for distinguishing Colours were more critical than  mine, did by Right Lines [Greek: ab, gd, ez,] &c. drawn cross the  Spectrum, note the Confines of the Colours, that is of the red M[Greek:  ab]F, of the orange [Greek: agdb], of the yellow [Greek: gezd], of the  green [Greek: eethz], of the blue [Greek: eikth],"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33527"],[0,"Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises of the Western North Atlantic (#17)"],[1,"ward.  Many probably winter in the Labrador Sea while others move farther  southward and farther offshore.      Stranded Specimens    Like the beaked whales discussed on p. 70 through 83, the northern  bottlenosed whales have no notch in the tail flukes, have two throat  grooves forming a V-shape on the chin, and have only two teeth in the  lower jaw, with those teeth emerged from the gums only in adult males.  These teeth may have sometimes fallen out of older males, but the tooth  sockets should still be visible in the gums.    NOTE: Some specimens--both male and female--will be found to have a  series of vestigial teeth the size of toothpicks in the upper and/or  lower jaws. Similar vestigial teeth, 5-40 in number, sometimes occur in  goosebeaked whales (p. 70). Further when they are prepared for museum  collections, the lower jaws of adult northern bottlenosed whales may be  found to contain a second pair of teeth just behind the first.    Northern bottlenosed whales may be distinguished from the remainder of  the beaked whale family, however, by the extremely robust body, by the  bulbous forehead, which is more extensively developed in larger animals,  particularly males, and by the pronounced dolphinlike beak.    [Illustration: Figure 67.--Northern bottlenosed whales at sea off Nova  Scotia. Note the prominent dorsal fin and the blotches of grayish-white  coloration on the body.

Strijbos, courtesy of Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke  Historie te Leiden._)]          GOOSEBEAKED WHALE (T)    _Ziphius cavirostris_ G. Cuvier 1823    Other Common Names      Ziphius, Cuvier's beaked whale, grampus (St. Vincent) (see also p. 96).      Description    Goosebeaked whales reach a length of 23 feet (7 m). Females are slightly  larger than males of the same age. Calves are probably less than about 6  feet (1.8 m) at birth. The head is small relative to the body length  and, when viewed laterally, is slightly concaved or scooped on the upper  margin. The cleft of the mouth is small, smaller than in any other  species of beaked whales. The beak is indistinct in larger individuals.  There is a distinct indentation on the back behind the head. Two teeth  are found at the tip of the lower jaw of adult males only.    The dorsal fin is relatively tall and distinct, to at least 15 inches  (38.1 cm), smoothly falcate, and located well behind the midpoint of the  back. The blowhole is located far forward on the top of the head. The  blow, which may project slightly forward and slightly off to the left,  is usually low and inconspicuous. Though the first blow after a long  dive may be more distinct, even it is rarely visible even under good  wind conditions for more than a few hundred yards.    Descriptions of the color pattern vary. Individuals may be dark rust  brown, slate gray, or fawn colored on the back and generally lighter on  the belly. Some appear dark in both regions, still others--particularly  youngsters--appear lighter gray or tan on the belly. The body is  frequently covered with white or cream-colored blotches (particularly on  the belly). The tail flukes are dark on the bottom. The head is  frequently paler in color. Old males have a distinct white head and are  frequently extensively scarred.      Natural History Notes    Goosebeaked whales frequently occur in groups of from 10 to as many as  25 individuals. They have been reported to jump clear of the water. They  are presumably deep divers and are known to stay down for more than 30  min. When they begin a deep dive, they often raise their tail flukes  above the surface and dive nearly vertically. Goosebeaked whales feed  primarily on squid.      May Be Confused With    So little is known of the external appearance and behavior of the living  beaked whales at sea that all the species may easily be confused.    Goosebeaked whales are larger than all other beaked whale species with  the exception of the northern bottlenosed whale. Upon close examination  they may be distinguished from the northern bottlenosed whale by the  lighter coloration of the head, reaching an extreme in the white head of  adult males. (See p. 67 and Fig. 75.)      Distribution    As with other species of beaked whales seldom encountered or at least  seldom positively identified at sea, the distribution of goosebeaked  whales is poorly known and must be constructed from records of stranded  specimens. Such records, often involving sick individuals that may have  washed ashore from considerable distances, may give an inaccurate  picture of normal ranges.    In general, stranding reports suggest that goosebeaked whales are  sparsely but widely distributed in nonpolar latitudes. They appear to be  primarily tropical in distribution, though they venture into temperate  areas in summer. They have been reported from Massachusetts and Rhode  Island south to Florida and thence to the islands of the West Indies.  They are frequently stranded along the Florida coast and are not an  uncommon species in the extant whale fishery of the Antillean Islands.  The fact that goosebeaked whales strand more frequently than other  beaked whales may reflect either a greater abundance or a greater  tendency to approach close to shore.    They are probably primarily an offshore species.      Stranded Specimens    To be positively identified, stranded goosebeaked whales in an advanced  state of decomposition may require museum preparation and examination of  the skull and teeth. Fresh specimens may be tentatively identified by  the characters illustrated in the figures.    [Illustration: Figure 71.--Goosebeaked whales have been rarely seen at  sea. In these photos from the eastern tropical Pacific, note the white  head of the animal on the left. Goosebeaked whales are wary of boats and  may dive for 30 min or more. When they surface, their blow, usually very  indistinct, may project forward and slightly to the left. (_Photos by K.  D. Sexton, courtesy of National Marine Fisheries Service._)]    [Illustration: Figure 72.--A beaked whale, probably a goosebeaked whale,  jumps beside a research ship off northwestern Baja California.

Note the prominent  dorsal fin, the lighter coloration of the head, and the depression just  behind the head. (_Photo from U.S. National Museum, courtesy of J. G.  Mead._)]    [Illustration: Figure 74.--A closeup of the dorsal surface of the flukes  of a juvenile goosebeaked whale stranded in the northeastern Gulf of  Mexico.

Note also the mouth  cleft, shorter in this species than in any other beaked whale species,  and the slightly concave appearance to the upper margin of the head. The  beak is usually less developed in large animals. The inset photo shows a  ventral view of the tip of the lower jaw of an adult male from the east  coast of Florida.

Description    In addition to the northern bottlenosed whale (p. 67) and the  goosebeaked whale (p. 70), four other species of beaked whales have been  reported from the western North Atlantic. All four species are known  primarily from stranded specimens and have been rarely encountered at  sea. Therefore statements of range are usually limited to inferences  from locations of strandings, and information on appearance and habits  of the species in the wild is almost totally lacking.    The infrequent encounters with beaked whales at sea may result from such  factors as 1) a low inconspicuous blow, 2) avoidance of ships, and/or 3)  distribution in small groups in offshore areas well outside the normal  boating lanes.    The following descriptions will aid primarily in identifying stranded  specimens. Though subtle differences in ranges, color patterns, and  dorsal fin shapes and positions may be helpful in narrowing the choices  of living animals, the species will continue to be extremely difficult  to distinguish from one another in the brief encounters typical at sea  until"]]]
