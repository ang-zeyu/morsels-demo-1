An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government (#17)"],[1,"which allures its stockholders into a trap, and there,  contrary to its authentic promise, exacts from them twenty, thirty, or  forty per cent. of the interest on their capital.    That is not all. The State is a university of citizens joined together  under a common law by an act of society. This act secures all in the  possession of their property; guarantees to one his field, to another  his vineyard, to a third his rents, and to the bondholder, who might  have bought real estate but who preferred to come to the assistance of  the treasury, his bonds. The State cannot demand, without offering an  equivalent, the sacrifice of an acre of the field or a corner of the  vineyard; still less can it lower rents: why should it have the right  to diminish the interest on bonds? This right could not justly exist,  unless the bondholder could invest his funds elsewhere to equal  advantage; but being confined to the State, where can he find a place to  invest them, since the cause of conversion, that is, the power to borrow  to better advantage, lies in the State? That is why a government, based  on the principle of property, cannot redeem its annuities without the  consent of their holders.    The money deposited with the republic is property which it has no right  to touch while other kinds of property are respected; to force  their redemption is to violate the social contract, and outlaw the  bondholders.    The whole controversy as to the conversion of bonds finally reduces  itself to this:--    QUESTION. Is it just to reduce to misery forty-five thousand families  who derive an income from their bonds of one hundred francs or less?    ANSWER. Is it just to compel seven or eight millions of tax-payers to  pay a tax of five francs, when they should pay only three? It is clear,  in the first place, that the reply is in reality no reply; but, to make  the wrong more apparent, let us change it thus: Is it just to endanger  the lives of one hundred thousand men, when we can save them by  surrendering one hundred heads to the enemy? Reader, decide!    All this is clearly understood by the defenders of the present system.  Yet, nevertheless, sooner or later, the conversion will be effected  and property be violated, because no other course is possible; because  property, regarded as a right, and not being a right, must of right  perish; because the force of events, the laws of conscience, and  physical and mathematical necessity must, in the end, destroy this  illusion of our minds.    To sum up: liberty is an absolute right, because it is to man what  impenetrability is to matter,--a sine qua non of existence; equality  is an absolute right, because without equality there is no society;  security is an absolute right, because in the eyes of every man his own  liberty and life are as precious as another's. These three rights are  absolute; that is, susceptible of neither increase nor diminution;  because in society each associate receives as much as he gives,--liberty  for liberty, equality for equality, security for security, body for  body, soul for soul, in life and in death.    But property, in its derivative sense, and by the definitions of law, is  a right outside of society; for it is clear that, if the wealth of each  was social wealth, the conditions would be equal for all, and it would  be a contradiction to say: PROPERTY IS A MAN'S RIGHT TO DISPOSE AT WILL  OF SOCIAL PROPERTY. Then if we are associated for the sake of liberty,  equality, and security, we are not associated for the sake of property;  then if property is a NATURAL right, this natural right is not SOCIAL,  but ANTI-SOCIAL. Property and society are utterly irreconcilable  institutions. It is as impossible to associate two proprietors as to  join two magnets by their opposite poles. Either society must perish, or  it must destroy property.    If property is a natural, absolute, imprescriptible, and inalienable  right, why, in all ages, has there been so much speculation as to its  origin?--for this is one of its distinguishing characteristics. The  origin of a natural right! Good God! who ever inquired into the origin  of the rights of liberty, security, or equality? They exist by the same  right that we exist; they are born with us, they live and die with us.  With property it is very different, indeed. By law, property can exist  without a proprietor, like a quality without a subject. It exists for  the human being who as yet is not, and for the octogenarian who is no  more. And yet, in spite of these wonderful prerogatives which savor  of the eternal and the infinite, they have never found the origin of  property; the doctors still disagree. On one point only are they in  harmony: namely, that the validity of the right of property depends upon  the authenticity of its origin. But this harmony is their condemnation.  Why have they acknowledged the right before settling the question of  origin?    Certain classes do not relish investigation into the pretended titles to  property, and its fabulous and perhaps scandalous history. They wish to  hold to this proposition: that property is a fact; that it always has  been, and always will be. With that proposition the savant Proudhon [11]  commenced his \"Treatise on the Right of Usufruct,\" regarding the origin  of property as a useless question. Perhaps I would subscribe to this  doctrine, believing it inspired by a commendable love of peace, were  all my fellow-citizens in comfortable circumstances; but, no! I will not  subscribe to it.    The titles on which they pretend to base the right of property are two  in number: OCCUPATION and LABOR. I shall examine them successively,  under all their aspects and in detail; and I remind the reader that,  to whatever authority we appeal, I shall prove beyond a doubt that  property, to be just and possible, must necessarily have equality for  its condition.      % 2.--Occupation, as the Title to Property.    It is remarkable that, at those meetings of the State Council at which  the Code was discussed, no controversy arose as to the origin and  principle of property. All the articles of Vol. II., Book 2, concerning  property and the right of accession, were passed without opposition or  amendment. Bonaparte, who on other questions had given his legists so  much trouble, had nothing to say about property. Be not surprised at it:  in the eyes of that man, the most selfish and wilful person that ever  lived, property was the first of rights, just as submission to authority  was the most holy of duties.    The right of OCCUPATION, or of the FIRST OCCUPANT, is that which results  from the actual, physical, real possession of a thing. I occupy a  piece of land; the presumption is, that I am the proprietor, until  the contrary is proved. We know that originally such a right cannot be  legitimate unless it is reciprocal; the jurists say as much.    Cicero compares the earth to a vast theatre: _Quemadmodum theatrum cum  commune sit, recte tamen dici potest ejus esse eum locum quem quisque  occuparit_.    This passage is all that ancient philosophy has to say about the origin  of property.    The theatre, says Cicero, is common to all; nevertheless, the place that  each one occupies is called HIS OWN; that is, it is a place POSSESSED,  not a place APPROPRIATED. This comparison annihilates property;  moreover, it implies equality. Can I, in a theatre, occupy at the same  time one place in the pit, another in the boxes, and a third in the  gallery? Not unless I have three bodies, like Geryon, or can exist  in different places at the same time, as is related of the magician  Apollonius.    According to Cicero, no one has a right to more than he needs: such  is the true interpretation of his famous axiom--_suum quidque cujusque  sit_, to each one that which belongs to him--an axiom that has been  strangely applied. That which belongs to each is not that which each MAY  possess, but that which each HAS A RIGHT to possess. Now, what have we a  right to possess? That which is required for our labor and consumption;  Cicero's comparison of the earth to a theatre proves it. According to  that, each one may take what place he will, may beautify and adorn it,  if he can; it is allowable: but he must never allow himself to overstep  the limit which separates him from another. The doctrine of Cicero leads  directly to equality; for, occupation being pure toleration, if the  toleration is mutual (and it cannot be otherwise) the possessions are  equal.    Grotius rushes into history; but what kind of reasoning is that which  seeks the origin of a right, said to be natural, elsewhere than in  Nature? This is the method of the ancients: the fact exists, then it  is necessary, then it is just, then its antecedents are just also.  Nevertheless, let us look into it.    \"Originally, all things were common and undivided; they were the  property of all.\" Let us go no farther. Grotius tells us how this  original communism came to an end through ambition and cupidity; how the  age of gold was followed by the age of iron, &c. So that property rested  first on war and conquest, then on treaties and agreements. But either  these treaties and agreements distributed wealth equally, as did the  original communism (the only method of distribution with which the  barbarians were acquainted, and the only form of justice of which they  could conceive; and then the question of origin assumes this form:  how did equality afterwards disappear?)--or else these treaties and  agreements were forced by the strong upon the weak, and in that case  they are null; the tacit consent of posterity does not make them valid,  and we live in a permanent condition of iniquity and fraud.    We never can conceive how the equality of conditions, having once  existed, could afterwards have passed away. What was the cause of such  degeneration?

Surrounding the house are small beds of pretty flowers, and rows of  fresh vegetables. Here resides in peace and tranquility Aunt Matilda  Pugh Daniel, an old Negro slave, aged 96 years. Aunt Matilda was a full  grown buxom gal when the War between the States was raging. She belonged  to United States Senator, James L. Pugh, and was born on his plantation,  near Eufaula. Even though time has dimmed her sight, and slightly  diminished her hearing powers, she is still active of mind and accurate  in her memories. We will let her speak for herself:    \"Yassuh, white folks, I remembers lots of things dat happen in de  slabery times. I works aroun' de house for mistis, who was de daughter  of Gen'l John Linguard Hunter befo' she ma'ied de massa. When I was a  little pig-tailed nigger, I usta play 'roun' wid Massa's chilluns. We  play injuns in de woods, an' buil' dams down on de creek an' swing in de  yard an' sometime we sho do devilish things. We hid red pepper in ole  Black Bob's chewin' bacca, an' you ought to seed de faces he made. It  makes me laugh still yit. Den we tuken a skunk dat us little white an'  black debils kotched an' turn him loose in de slave quarters. You ought  ter seed dem niggers come a flyin' outer dere. Dey come out like a swarm  of wet antses.    \"Atter I grew up I ma'ied Joe Daniel, a house nigger, an' Gen'l Hunter,  de Mistis's pappy 'formed de ceremony. We was ma'ied in de parlor, an' I  wo' a party dress of Miss Sara's. It sho' was purty; made outen white  tarleton wid a pink bow in de front. I had a pink ribbon 'roun' my haid  too, an' Joe, he look proud of me. Atter de weddin' all de niggers on de  plantation gathered about an' we had a soiree in de back yard. Me an'  Joe moved to de quarter den, but I still worked in de house. Mistis  warn't goin' ter let nobody wash dem julep glasses but me, an' warn't  nobody a goin' ter polish dat silber but dis here nigger. Nawsuh.    [Illustration: _Matilda Pugh Daniel, Eufaula, Alabama_]    \"Durin' de war us warn't bothered much, but atter de surrender, some po'  white trash tried to make us take some lan'. Some of 'em come to de  slave quarters, an' talk to us. Dey say 'Niggers, you is jus' as good as  de white fo'ks. You is 'titled to vote in de 'lections an' to have money  same as dey,' but most of us didn't pay no 'tention to 'em.    \"Den Massa James an' Mistis moved to Washington, an' Miss Sara wanted me  to go wid her to be her house maid. She said she'd pay me money fo' it,  but I couldn't leave my ole man, Joe, kaze he had a case of consumption.  Joe died a year later an' lef' me wid fo' little chilluns. Us stayed  'roun' on de plantation an' de new massa paid us good money fo' workin',  but soon de house kotched fire an' burn to de groun', an' I have to move  to Eufaula. I bought dis little house wid de money I saved. I has  kinfolks in Detroit dat sen's me a little money, an' some good peoples  in Eufaula helps me out some so I is in purty good financial shape. I  ain't neber 'sociated wid no trashy niggers an' I ain't neber 'ten' to.  I is goin' to be a proud an' good nigger to de las'.\"          Carrie Davis          *Interview with Carrie Davis*      --_Preston Klein, Lee County, Alabama_    _PLANTATION PUNISHMENT_    Carrie Davis said \"Honey, dere was a lot of cruel things done in slavery  times.\"    She was washing when I arrived at her shanty near Smith's Station,  Alabama. She asked, as so many of the old Negroes do, \"Has you come to  help me?\" I said: \"No, Carrie; I want you to tell me about slavery.\"    She shook her gray head, recalled: \"Dem was good an' bad times, Mistus;  good an' bad. I had a purty good marster; but de marster on de  plantation dat j'ined our'n was mighty mean. He was a bad man, no matter  if de slaves behaved or not.    \"Honey, I 'members dat he had regular days to whup all de slaves wid  strops. De strops had holes in 'em so dat dey raised big blisters. Den  dey took a hand saw, cut de blisters and washed 'em in salt water. Our  Ol' Mistus has put salve on aheap of backs so dey could git deir shirts  off. De shirts'd stick, you see. De slaves would come to our house for  water an' Mistus would see 'em.\"    Asked about her life as a slave, she said: \"I was borned in Harris  County, Georgia, an' was 'bout ten or twelve when freedom come.
