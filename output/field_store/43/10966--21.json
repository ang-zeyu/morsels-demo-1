This result had been anticipated in the  monthly records, which showed a steady increase in the tonnage launched:                                Number of                                Ships      Aggregate     Month.                   Launched.     Tonnage.     January                       11           91,541   February                      16          123,100   March                         21          166,700    The rapidity with which ships are being produced was shown by the  breaking of the world's record on April 20 and in turn the breaking of  this record on May 5. On the former date the 8,800-ton steel steamship  West Lianga was launched at Seattle, Wash., fifty-five working days from  the date the keel was laid. This was then the world's record. But on May  5 at Camden, N. J., the steel freight steamship Tuckahoe, of 5,548 tons,  was launched twenty-seven days after the keel was laid.    Ten days after this extraordinary achievement the Tuckahoe was finished  and furnished and ready for sea--another record feat.    Charles M. Schwab, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bethlehem  Steel Corporation, was on April 16, 1918, appointed Director General of  the Emergency Fleet Corporation to speed up the Government's  shipbuilding program. He was invested with practically unlimited powers  over all construction work in shipyards producing vessels for the  Emergency Fleet Corporation. Charles Piez in consequence ceased to be  General Manager of the Corporation, remaining, however, as Vice  President to supervise administrative details of construction and  placing contracts.    Mr. Schwab, who was the fifth man to be put in charge of the  shipbuilding program, was not desirous of accepting the position when  first approached because he considered his work in producing steel of  first importance in the carrying out of the nation's war program. But  after a conference with President Wilson, Edward N. Hurley, Chairman of  the Shipping Board; Bainbridge Colby, another member of the board, and  Charles Piez, he decided to accept the new position.    Almost the first thing Mr. Schwab did was to move his headquarters to  Philadelphia as the centre of the steel-shipbuilding region, taking with  him all the division chiefs of the Fleet Corporation directly connected  with construction work and about 2,000 employes. The Shipping Board and  Mr. Piez retained their offices in Washington with 1,500 subordinates  and employes. As a further step toward decentralization it was arranged  to move the operating department, including agencies such as the  Interallied Ship Control Committee, headed by P. A. S. Franklin, to New  York City.    The original \"cost-plus\" contract under which the Submarine Boat  Corporation of Newark was to build 160 ships of 5,000 tons for the  Government was canceled by Mr. Schwab as an experiment to determine  whether shipyards operating under lump-sum contracts and accepting all  responsibility for providing materials could make greater speed in  construction than those operating with Government money, such as the Hog  Island yards. The result was to increase the cost of each of the 160  ships from $787,500 to $960,000.    A request for an appropriation of $2,223,835,000 for the 1919 program  was presented by Mr. Hurley and Mr. Schwab to the House Appropriations  Committee on May 8.    Of this total $1,386,100,000 was for construction of ships and  $652,000,000 for the purchasing and requisitioning of plants and  material in connection with the building program.          Third Liberty Loan Oversubscribed    Approximately 17,000,000 Buyers      When the Third Liberty Loan, raised to finance America's war needs,  closed on May 4, 1918, the subscriptions were well over $4,000,000,000,  a billion in excess of the amount called for. The total was announced on  May 17 as $4,170,019,650. Secretary McAdoo stated that he would allot  bonds in full on all subscriptions.    The loan was regarded as the most successful ever floated by any nation,  not so much because of the volume of sales, but because of the wide  distribution of the loan. Approximately 17,000,000 individuals  subscribed, that is, about one person in every six in the United States.  The number of buyers in the Third Loan exceeded those in the Second by  7,000,000 and those in the First by 12,500,000.    The campaign throughout the country was conducted with all the  thoroughness of a great political struggle, with the difference that  there were no contending parties and all forces were marshaled to make  the loan a success. Nor was the campaign merely a display of efficient  organization and vigorous propaganda. It had many features of dramatic  and picturesque interest, not only in the large cities, but in almost  every smaller centre of the nation. A noonday rally of 50,000 men and  women in Wall Street, New York, on the closing day, was typical. An  eyewitness described it thus:        The Police Department Band appeared and the band of the 15th Coast      Artillery from Fort Hamilton. Taking advantage of the occasion,      James Montgomery Flagg now appeared in his studio van on the      southern fringe of the Broad Street crowd. A girl with him played      something on the cornet. It was a good deal like a show on the      Midway at a Western county fair. But this was no faker--one of the      most famous artists in America, throwing in a signed sketch of      whoever bought Liberty bonds. Those near him began pushing and      crowding to take advantage of the offer.        And now, suddenly, a tremendous racket up the street toward      Broadway. Who comes?        Cheer on cheer, now. It is the \"Anzacs.\" Twelve long, rangy fellows,      officers all, six or seven of them with the little brass \"A\" on the      shoulder, which signifies service at Gallipoli and in Flanders. They      are members of the contingent of 500 which arrived here yesterday on      its way to the battlefields of France. They run lightly up the      Sub-Treasury steps and take their stand in a group beside the      soldier band.        And now they all come--all the actors in the drama of the day.      Governor Whitman, bareheaded, solemn-faced; Rabbi Stephen Wise, with      his rugged face and his shock of blue-black hair; Mme.      Schumann-Heink, panting a little with excitement; Auguste Bouilliz,      baritone of the Royal Opera of Brussels, who later is to thrill them      all with his singing of the \"Marseillaise\"; Cecil Arden, in a      shining helmet and draped in the Union Jack, come to sing \"God Save      the King,\" while the sunburned Australian officers stand like      statues at salute; Oscar Straus, and then--        \"Yee-ee-ee-eee.\"        Oh, how they cheered! For the \"Blue Devils\" of France had poured out      of the door of the Sub-Treasury and, with the fitful sun shining      once more and gleaming on their bayonets, were running down the      steps in two lines, past the \"Anzacs,\" past the soldier band, to      draw up in ranks at the bottom.        Lieutenant de Moal speaks. What does he say? Who knows? But he is      widely cheered, just the same, as he gives way to Governor Whitman.        \"There are gatherings like this, though not so large, all over our      land today,\" cries the Governor. \"In every town and city we      Americans are gathered together at this moment to demonstrate that      we are behind our army, behind our navy, behind our President.\"        The cheers that acclaimed his mention of the President drowned his      voice for several moments.        \"Here are the Australians,\" he cries, pointing to the \"Anzac\"      officers. \"They have brought us a message, but we are going to give      them a message, too.\"        As the Governor stepped back to cheers that rocked the street,      Lieutenant de Moal barked a sharp order, and the \"Blue Devils\"      shouldered their guns with fixed bayonets, the six trumpeters      ta-ra-ta-raed, and the soldiers of France moved off up the sidewalk      lane to the side door of the Stock Exchange, where all business was      suspended during the fifteen minutes of their visit on the floor.        Four of the \"Anzacs\" meanwhile were taken from their ranks on the      steps of the building up to the pedestal of the statue of      Washington, which was used as speaker's platform, and Captain Frank      McCallam made a brief address.        \"We haven't many men left,\" he said simply. \"And it is up to you      people to help us out to the best of your ability.\"        More cheers, and then Cecil Arden sang \"God Save the King.\" The      American regular fired a blank volley over the heads of the crowd,      and the kids scrambled for the empty shells.        Following Wise and Straus, Bouilliz, the Belgian baritone, sang the      \"Marseillaise,\" and then, after the soldier band had played \"Where      Do We Go from Here, Boys?\" Mme. Schumann-Heink advanced and sang the      national anthem, following it up with an appeal that was the climax      to the play.    Less exciting but more impressive was the parade on April 26, when  thousands of mothers who had sent their sons to the front marched in a  column of 35,000 men and women in the Liberty Day parade in New York  City. This day had been proclaimed as such by President Wilson for \"the  people of the United States to assemble in their respective communities  and liberally pledge anew their financial support to sustain the  nation's cause, and to hold patriotic demonstrations in every city,  town, and hamlet throughout the land.\"    The challenge of the mothers was inscribed on one of the banners they  carried: \"We give our sons--they give their lives--what do you give?\"    Remarkable as was the appearance of these mothers with the little  service flags over their shoulders, many of them so old that they  marched with difficulty, the spectators who flanked the line of march  along Fifth Avenue from Washington Square to Fifty-ninth"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41481"],[0,"Astounding Stories of Super-Science January 1930 (#17)"],[1,"in the light like a fog before sunshine. A wisp of it left,  like a breath, and then there was nothing.           *       *       *       *       *    I sat on the couch. I had put out the light. Around me the room was  black. My fingers found the small switch at my wrist. I pressed it  across its tiny arc.    The first shock was slight, but infinitely strange. A shuddering,  twitching sensation ran all over me. It made my head reel, swept a wave  of nausea over me, a giddiness, a feeling that I was falling through  darkness. I lay on the couch, bracing myself. The current was whining up  its tiny scale. I could feel it now. A tiny throbbing, communicating  itself to my physical being.    And then in a moment I realized that my body was throbbing. The  vibration of the current was communicating itself to the most minute  cells of my body. An indescribable tiny quivering within me. Strange,  frightening, sickening at first. But the sickness passed, and in a  moment I found it almost pleasant.    I could see nothing. The room was wholly dark. I lay on my side on the  couch, my eyes staring into the blackness around me. I could hear the  humming of the current, and then it seemed to fade. Abruptly I felt a  sense of lightness. My body, lying on the couch, pressed less heavily.    I gripped my arm. I was solid, substantial as before. I touched the  couch. It was the couch which was changing, not I! The couch cover  queerly seemed to melt under my hand!    The sense of my own lightness grew upon me. A lightness, a freedom,  pressed me, as though chains and shackles which all my life had  encompassed me were falling away. A wild, queer freedom.    I wondered where Derek was. Had I arrived in the other realm? Was he  here? I had no idea how much time had passed: a minute or two, perhaps.    Or was I still in Derek's laboratory? The darkness was as solid,  impenetrable as ever. No, not quite dark! I saw something now. A  glowing, misty outline around me. Then I saw that it was not the new,  unknown realm, but still Derek's room. A shadowy, spectral room, and the  light, which dimly illumined it, was from outside.           *       *       *       *       *    I lay puzzling, my own situation forgotten for the moment. The light  came from overhead, in another room of the apartment house. I stared.  Around me now was a dim vista of distance, and vague, blurred, misty  outlines of the apartment building above me. The shadowy world I had  left now lay bare. There was a moment when I thought I could see far  away across a spectral city street. The shadows of the great city were  around me. They glowed, and then were gone.    A hand gripped my arm in a solid grip. Derek's voice sounded.    \"Are you all right?\"    \"Yes,\" I murmured. The couch had faded. I was conscious that I had  floated or drifted down a few inches, to a new level. The level of the  cellar floor beneath the couch. Cellar floor! It was not that now. Yet  there was something solid here, a solid ground, and I was lying upon it,  with Derek sitting beside me.    I murmured again, \"Yes, I'm all right.\"    My groping hand felt the ground. It was soil, with a growth of  vegetation like a grass sward on it. Were we outdoors? It suddenly  seemed so. I could feel soft, warm air on my face and had a sense of  open distance around me. A light was growing, a vague, diffused light,  as though day were swiftly coming upon us.    I felt Derek fumbling at my wrist. \"That's all, Charlie.\"    There was a slight shock. Derek was pulling me up beside him. I found  myself on my feet, with light around me. I stood wavering, gripping  Derek. It was as though I had closed my eyes, and now they were suddenly  open. I was aware of daylight, color, and movement. A world of normality  here, normal to me now because I was part of it. The realm of the  unknown!          CHAPTER IV    _\"Hope, I Came....\"_      I think I was first conscious of a queer calmness which had settled upon  me, as though now I had withdrawn contact with the turmoil of our world!  Something was gone, and in its place came a calmness. But that was a  mere transition. It had passed in a moment. I stood trembling with  eagerness, as I know Derek was trembling.    A radiant effulgence of light was around us, clarifying, growing. There  was ground beneath our feet, and sky overhead. A rational landscape,  strangely familiar. A physical world like my own, but, it seemed, with a  new glory upon it. Nature, calmly serene.    I had thought we were standing in daylight. I saw now it was bright  starlight. An evening, such as the evening we had just left in our own  world. The starlight showed everything clearly. I could see a fair  distance.    We stood at the top of a slight rise. I saw gentle, slightly undulating  country. A brook nearby wound through a grove of trees and lost itself.  Suddenly, with a shock, I realized how familiar this was! We stood  facing what in New York City we call West. The contour of this land was  familiar enough for me to identify it. A mile or so ahead lay a river;  it shimmered in its valley, with cliffs on its further side. Near at  hand the open country was dotted with trees and checkered with round  patches of cultivated fields. And there were occasional habitations,  low, oval houses of green thatch.    The faint flush of a recent sunset lay upon the landscape, mingled with  the starlight. A road--a white ribbon in the starlight--wound over the  countryside toward the river. Animals, strange of aspect, were slowly  dragging carts. There were distant figures working in the fields.    A city lay ahead of us, set along this nearer bank of the river. A city!  It seemed a primitive village. All was primitive, as though here might  be some lost Indian tribe of our early ages. The people were  picturesque, the field workers garbed in vivid colors. The flat little  carts, slow moving, with broad-horned oxen.           *       *       *       *       *    This quiet village, drowsing beside the calm-flowing river, seemed all  very normal. I could fancy that it was just after sundown of a quiet  workday. There was a faint flush of pink upon everything: the glory of  the sun just set. And as though to further my fancy, in the village by  the river, like an angelus, a faint-toned bell was chiming.    We stood for a moment gazing silently. I felt wholly normal. A warm,  pleasant wind fanned my hot face. The sense of lightness was gone. This  was normality to me.    Derek murmured, \"Hope was to meet me here.\"    And then we both saw her. She was coming toward us along the road. A  slight, girlish figure, clothed in queerly vivid garments: a short  jacket of blue cloth with wide-flowing sleeves, knee-length pantaloons  of red, with tassels dangling from them, and a wide red sash about her  waist. Pale golden hair was piled in a coil upon her head....    She was coming toward us along the edge of the road, from the direction  of the city. She was only a few hundred feet from us when we first saw  her, coming swiftly, furtively it seemed. A low pike fence bordered the  road. She seemed to be shielding herself in the shadows beside it.    We stood waiting in the starlight. The nearest figures in the field and  on the road were too far away to notice us. The girl advanced. Her white  arm went up in a gesture, and Derek answered. She left the road,  crossing the field toward us. As she came closer, I saw how very  beautiful she was. A girl of eighteen, perhaps, a fantastic little  figure with her vivid garments. The starlight illumined her white face,  anxious, apprehensive, but eager.    \"Derek!\"    He said, \"Hope, I came....\"    I stood silently watching. Derek's arms went out, and the girl, with a  little cry, came running forward and threw herself into them.          CHAPTER V    _Intrigue_      \"Am I in time, Hope?\"    \"Yes, but the festival is to-night. In an hour or two now. Oh Derek, if  the king holds this festival, the toilers will revolt. They won't stand  it--\"    \"To-night! It mustn't be held to-night! It doesn't give me time, time to  plan.\"    I stood listening to their vehement, half-whispered words. For a moment  or two, absorbed, they ignored me.    \"The king will make his choice to-night, Derek. He has announced it.  Blanca or Sensua for his queen. And if he chooses the Crimson Sensua--\"  She stammered, then she went on:    \"If he does--there will be bloodshed. The toilers are waiting, just to  learn his choice.\"    Derek exclaimed, \"But to-night is too soon! I've got to plan. Hope,  where does Rohbar stand in this?\"    Strange intrigue! I pieced it together now, from their words, and from  what presently they briefly told me. A festival was about to be held, an  orgy of feasting and merrymaking, of music and dancing. And during it,  this young King Leonto was to choose his queen. There were two  possibilities. The Crimson Sensua, a profligate, debauched woman who, as  queen, would further oppress the workers. And Blanca, a white beauty,  risen from the toilers to be a favorite at the Court. Hope was her  handmaiden.    If Blanca were chosen, the toilers would be appeased. She was one of  them. She would lead this king from his profligate ways, would win from  him justice for the workers.    But Derek and Hope both knew that the pure and gentle Blanca would  never be the king's choice. And to-night the toilers would definitely  know it, and the smoldering revolt would burst into flame.           *       *       *       *       *    And there was this Rohbar. Derek said, \"He is the king's henchman,  Charlie.\"    I stood here in the starlight, listening to them. This strange primitive  realm. There were no modern weapons here. We had brought none. The  current used in our transition would have exploded the cartridges of a  revolver. I had a dirk which Hope now gave me, and that was all.    Primitive intrigue. I envisaged this chaotic nation, with its toilers  ignorant as the oppressed"]]]
