And first there  came before him the Duke of Lueneburg, commander of the infantry of the  Landgrave. He was a stout man who carried with difficulty his great  paunch swollen with food. He went up to Ulenspiegel and whispered in  his ear:    \"When you paint my portrait see that you take off half my fat at  least. Else will I order my soldiers to have you hung.\"    The Duke passed on. And next there came a noble lady with a hump on  her back and a bosom as flat as a sword-blade.    \"Sir painter,\" said she, \"unless you remove the hump on my back and  give me a couple of others in the place where they should be, verily  I will have you drawn and quartered as if you were a prisoner.\"    The lady went away, and now there appeared a young maid of honour,  fair, fresh, and comely, only that she lacked three teeth under her  upper lip.    \"Sir painter,\" said she, \"if you do not paint me smiling and showing  through my parted lips a perfect set of teeth, I'll have you chopped  up into small pieces at the hands of my gallant. There he is, look  at him.\"    And she pointed to that Captain of Artillery who a while ago had been  playing dice on the palace steps. And she went her way.    The procession continued, until at last Ulenspiegel was left alone  with the Landgrave.    The Landgrave said to him:    \"My friend, let me warn you that if your painting has the misfortune  to be inaccurate or false to all these various physiognomies by so  much as a single feature, I will have your throat cut as if you were  a chicken.\"    \"If I am to have my head cut off,\" thought Ulenspiegel, \"if I am to be  drawn and quartered, chopped up into small pieces, and finally hung,  I should do better to paint no portrait at all. I must consider what  is best to be done.\"    \"And where is the hall,\" he asked the Landgrave, \"which I am to adorn  with all these likenesses!\"    \"Follow me,\" said the Landgrave. And he brought him to a large room  with great bare walls.    \"This is the hall,\" he said.    \"I should be very grateful,\" said Ulenspiegel, \"if some curtains could  be hung right along the walls, so that my paintings may be protected  from the flies and the dust.\"    \"Certainly,\" said the Landgrave.    When the curtains had been hung as directed, Ulenspiegel asked if  he might have three apprentices to help him with the mixing of his  colours.    This was done, and for thirty days Ulenspiegel and the apprentices  spent the whole of their time feasting and carousing together, with  every extravagance of meat and drink. And the Landgrave looked on at  it all. But at last on the thirty-first day he came and thrust his  nose in at the door of the chamber where Ulenspiegel had begged him  not to enter.    \"Well, Tyl,\" he said, \"and where are the portraits?\"    \"They are not finished,\" answered Ulenspiegel.    \"When shall I be able to see them?\"    \"Not just yet,\" said Ulenspiegel.    On the six-and-thirtieth day the Landgrave again thrust his nose  inside the door.    \"Well, Tyl,\" he inquired, \"how now?\"    \"Ah, Sir Landgrave,\" said Ulenspiegel, \"the portraits are getting on.\"    On the sixtieth day the Landgrave grew very angry, and coming right  into the room:    \"Show me the pictures at once!\" he cried.    \"I will do so,\" answered Ulenspiegel, \"but pray have the kindness  not to draw the curtain until you have summoned hither the lords and  captains and ladies of your court.\"    \"Very well,\" said the Landgrave, and at his command the aforesaid  notabilities appeared. Ulenspiegel took up his stand in front of the  curtain, which was still carefully drawn.    \"My Lord Landgrave,\" he said, \"and you, Madame the Landgravine,  and you my Lord of Lueneburg, and you others, fine ladies and valiant  captains, know that behind this curtain have I portrayed to the best  of my abilities your faces, every one warlike or gentle as the case may  be. It will be quite easy for each one of you to recognize himself. And  that you are anxious to see yourselves is only natural. But I pray  you have patience and suffer me to speak a word or two before the  curtain is drawn. Know this, fair ladies and valiant captains; all you  that are of noble blood shall behold my paintings and rejoice. But  if there be among you any that is of low or humble birth, such an  one will see nothing but a blank wall. So there! And now, have the  goodness to open wide your noble eyes.\"    And so saying, Ulenspiegel drew the curtain.    \"Remember,\" said he again, \"only they of noble birth can see my  pictures, whether they be lords or ladies.\" And again, presently:  \"He of low birth is blind to my pictures But he who clearly sees,  that man is a nobleman without a doubt.\"    At that every one present opened wide his eyes, pretending--you may  be sure--to see, and feigning to recognize the various faces and  pointing themselves out to one another, though in reality they beheld  nothing at all but a bare wall. And for this they were each and all  secretly ashamed.    Suddenly the court jester, who was standing by, jumped three feet in  the air and jaggled his bells.    \"Take me for a villain,\" he cried, \"a most villainous villain, but  I verily will affirm and assert and say with trumpets and fanfares  that there I see a wall, a blank, white wall, and nothing but a wall,  so help me God and his saints!\"    Ulenspiegel said:    \"When fools 'gin talking, time for wise men to be walking.\"    And he was about to leave the palace when the Landgrave stopped him.    \"Fool in your folly,\" said he, \"you make boast that you go through the  world praising what is good and fair and making mock of foolery, and  you have dared to make open game of so many and so high-born ladies,  and of their yet more noble lords, bringing ridicule on the pride  of their nobility! Of a truth I tell you that the day will come when  you will hang for your free speech.\"    \"If the cord is of gold,\" said Ulenspiegel, \"it will break with dread  at my approach.\"    \"Stay,\" said the Landgrave. \"Here is the first bit of your rope,\"  and he gave him fifteen florins.    \"All thanks to you,\" said Ulenspiegel, \"and I promise you that every  tavern on the road shall have a thread of it, a thread of that gold  which makes Croesuses of all those rascally tavern-keepers.\"    And off he went on his donkey, holding his head up high in air,  with the plume in his cap wagging joyously in the breeze.              XXXIV      Now was the season of yellowing leaves, and the winds of autumn  were beginning to blow. Sometimes for an hour or two it seemed that  Katheline was come into her right mind again, and at such times  Claes would say that the merciful spirit of God had come to visit  her. Then it was that she had power to throw a charm upon Nele, by  signs and incantations, so that the girl was able to see whatever was  happening all over the world, in the public squares of the cities,  or on the highways, or in the houses themselves.    To-day Katheline was in one of these moods of right-mindedness, and  she was eating olie-koekje with Claes, Soetkin, and Nele. Claes said:    \"This is the day of His Majesty the Emperor's abdication. Nele,  my dear, do you think you could see as far as Brussels in Brabant?\"    \"If Katheline wishes me to,\" said Nele.    Thereupon Katheline caused her to sit down on a bench, and making  sundry passes with her hands, she muttered her incantations, which  soon sent the girl off into a trance.    Then Katheline said to her:    \"Make your way into the little house which is called the Park House,  and is the favourite residence of the Emperor Charles the Fifth.\"    Whereupon Nele began to speak, in a low voice, as though she were  half suffocated.    \"I am standing in a small room painted green. There is a man in the  room. He is about fifty-four years of age, and he has a bald head and  a protruding chin with a white beard growing upon it. His grey eyes  have a wicked, crafty look, filled with cruelty and false kindness. And  this is the man they call 'His Most Sacred Majesty.' He suffers from  a catarrh and always keeps coughing. Beside him is another, a young  man with an ugly face like that of a hydrocephalous monkey. I saw him  once at Antwerp. He is King Philip. At the present moment he is being  rebuked by His Sacred Majesty for having slept out last night away from  home. Doubtless, says His Majesty, he was at some brothel in company  of a trollop of the town. His hair, it seems, smells of the tavern,  no place, that, for a King to seek his pleasures in, he who may have  his choice of all the sweetest bodies in the world, of skin like  satin fresh from perfumed baths, and of hands of high-born ladies,  very amorous. Such as these, says His Majesty, are more fit for him,  surely, than some half-mad wench that is come, scarcely washed, from  the arms of a drunken soldier. For there is not one among all the  ladies, the most noble, the most beautiful, whether virgin, wife,  or widow, that would resist King Philip! And they would be proud to  give him of their love--not by a greasy glimmer of stinking tallow,  but by the light of scented tapers made of finest wax.    \"The King replies that he will obey His Sacred Majesty in all  things. Whereupon His Sacred Majesty has a fit of coughing and  drinks some draughts of hippocras. After which he addresses his son,  sorrowfully, in these words:    \"'You must know, my son, that very soon I am to give to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3760"],[0,"Sybil, Or, The Two Nations (#17)"],[1,"friend in the House of Lords, and seemed expecting the  strongest expressions of delight and gratitude from her for his unasked  and inconvenient kindness. Lady Marney had struggled against this  tyranny in the earlier days of their union. Innocent, inexperienced Lady  Marney! As if it were possible for a wife to contend against a selfish  husband, at once sharp-witted and blunt-hearted! She had appealed to  him, she had even reproached him; she had wept, once she had knelt.  But Lord Marney looked upon these demonstrations as the disordered  sensibility of a girl unused to the marriage state, and ignorant of the  wise authority of husbands, of which he deemed himself a model. And  so, after a due course of initiation, Lady Marney invisible for days,  plunged in remorseful reveries in the mysteries of her boudoir, and her  lord dining at his club and going to the minor theatres; the countess  was broken in, and became the perfect wife of a perfect husband.    Lord Marney, who was fond of chess, turned out Captain Grouse, and very  gallantly proposed to finish his game with Miss Poinsett, which Miss  Poinsett, who understood Lord Marney as well as he understood chess,  took care speedily to lose, so that his lordship might encounter a  champion worthy of him. Egremont seated by his sister-in-law, and  anxious by kind words to soothe the irritation which he had observed  with pain his brother create, entered into easy talk, and after some  time, said, \"I find you have been good enough to mould my destiny.\"    Lady Marney looked a little surprised, and then said, \"How so?\"    \"You have decided on I hear the most important step of my life.\"    \"Indeed you perplex me.\"    \"Lady Joan Fitz-Warene, your friend--\"    The countess blushed; the name was a clue which she could follow, but  Egremont nevertheless suspected that the idea had never previously  occurred to her. Lady Joan she described as not beautiful; certainly not  beautiful; nobody would consider her beautiful, many would indeed think  her quite the reverse; and yet she had a look, one particular look when  according to Lady Marney, she was more than beautiful. But she was very  clever, very indeed, something quite extraordinary.    \"Accomplished?\"    \"Oh! far beyond that; I have heard even men say that no one knew so  much.\"    \"A regular blue?\"    \"Oh! no; not at all a blue; not that kind of knowledge. But languages  and learned books; Arabic, and Hebrew, and old manuscripts. And then she  has an observatory, and was the first person who discovered the comet.  Dr Buckland swears by her; and she corresponds with Arago.\"    \"And her sister, is she the same?\"    \"Lady Maud: she is very religious. I do not know her so well.\"    \"Is she pretty?\"    \"Some people admire her very much.\"    \"I never was at Mowbray. What sort of a place is it?\"    \"Oh! it is very grand,\" said Lady Marney; \"but like all places in the  manufacturing districts, very disagreeable. You never have a clear sky.  Your toilette table is covered with blacks; the deer in the park seem  as if they had bathed in a lake of Indian ink; and as for the sheep, you  expect to see chimney-sweeps for the shepherds.\"    \"And do you really mean to go on Thursday?\" said Egremont: \"I think we  had better put it off.\"    \"We must go,\" said Lady Marney, with a sort of sigh, and shaking her  head.    \"Let me speak to Marney.\"    \"Oh! no. We must go. I am annoyed about this dear little Poinsett: she  has been to stay with me so very often, and she has only been here  three days. When she comes in again, I wish you would ask her to sing,  Charles.\"    Soon the dear little Poinsett was singing, much gratified by being  invited to the instrument by Mr Egremont, who for a few minutes hung  over her, and then evidently under the influence of her tones, walked up  and down the room, and only speaking to beg that she would continue her  charming performances. Lady Marney was engrossed with her embroidery;  her lord and the captain with their game.    And what was Egremont thinking of? Of Mowbray be you sure. And of Lady  Joan or Lady Maud? Not exactly. Mowbray was the name of the town to  which the strangers he had met with in the Abbey were bound. It was the  only piece of information that he had been able to obtain of them; and  that casually.    When the fair vision of the starlit arch, about to descend to her two  companions, perceived that they were in conversation with a stranger,  she hesitated, and in a moment withdrew. Then the elder of the  travellers, exchanging a glance with his friend, bid good even to  Egremont.    \"Our way perhaps lies the same,\" said Egremont.    \"I should deem not,\" said the stranger, \"nor are we alone.\"    \"And we must be stirring, for we have far to go,\" said he who was  dressed in black.    \"My journey is very brief,\" said Egremont, making a desperate effort to  invite communication; \"and I am on horseback!\"    \"And we on foot,\" said the elder; \"nor shall we stop till we reach  Mowbray;\" and with a slight salute, they left Egremont alone. There  was something in the manner of the elder stranger which repressed the  possibility of Egremont following him. Leaving then the cloister garden  in another direction, he speculated on meeting them outside the abbey.  He passed through the Lady's chapel. The beautiful Religious was not  there. He gained the west front; no one was visible. He took a rapid  survey of each side of the abbey; not a being to be recognized. He  fancied they must have advanced towards the Abbey Farm; yet they might  have proceeded further on in the dale. Perplexed, he lost time. Finally  he proceeded towards the farm, but did not overtake them; reached it,  but learned nothing of them; and arrived at his brother's full of a  strange yet sweet perplexity.          Book 2 Chapter 7        In a commercial country like England, every half century developes some  new and vast source of public wealth, which brings into national notice  a new and powerful class. A couple of centuries ago, a Turkey merchant  was the great creator of wealth; the West Indian Planter followed him.  In the middle of the last century appeared the Nabob. These characters  in their zenith in turn merged in the land, and became English  aristocrats; while the Levant decaying, the West Indies exhausted, and  Hindostan plundered, the breeds died away, and now exist only in our  English comedies from Wycherly and Congreve to Cumberland and Morton.  The expenditure of the revolutionary war produced the Loanmonger,  who succeeded the Nabob; and the application of science to industry  developed the Manufacturer, who in turn aspires to be \"large-acred,\"  and always will, as long as we have a territorial constitution; a better  security for the preponderance of the landed interest than any corn law,  fixed or fluctuating.    Of all these characters, the one that on the whole made the largest  fortunes in the most rapid manner,--and we do not forget the marvels of  the Waterloo loan, or the miracles of Manchester during the continental  blockade--was the Anglo-East Indian about the time that Hastings was  first appointed to the great viceroyalty. It was not unusual for men in  positions so obscure that their names had never reached the public in  this country, and who yet had not been absent from their native land for  a longer period than the siege of Troy, to return with their million.    One of the most fortunate of this class of obscure adventurers was a  certain John Warren. A very few years before the breaking out of the  American war, he was a waiter at a celebrated club in St James's Street:  a quick yet steady young fellow; assiduous, discreet, and very civil.  In this capacity, he pleased a gentleman who was just appointed to the  government of Madras, and who wanted a valet. Warren, though prudent,  was adventurous; and accepted the opening which he believed fortune  offered him. He was prescient. The voyage in those days was an affair  of six months. During this period, Warren still more ingratiated himself  with his master. He wrote a good hand, and his master a very bad one.  He had a natural talent for accounts; a kind of information which was  useful to his employer. He arrived at Madras, no longer a valet, but a  private secretary.    His master went out to make a fortune; but he was indolent, and had  indeed none of the qualities for success, except his great position.  Warren had every quality but that. The basis of the confederacy  therefore was intelligible; it was founded on mutual interests and  cemented by reciprocal assistance. The governor granted monopolies to  the secretary, who apportioned a due share to his sleeping partner.  There appeared one of those dearths not unusual in Hindostan; the  population of the famished province cried out for rice; the stores of  which, diminished by nature, had for months mysteriously disappeared. A  provident administration it seems had invested the public revenue in its  benevolent purchase; the misery was so excessive that even pestilence  was anticipated, when the great forestallers came to the rescue of the  people over whose destinies they presided; and at the same time fed and  pocketed millions.    This was the great stroke of the financial genius of Warren. He was  satisfied. He longed once more to see St James's Street, and to become  a member of the club, where he had once been a waiter. But he was  the spoiled child of fortune, who would not so easily spare him. The  governor died, and had appointed his secretary his sole executor. Not  that his excellency particularly trusted his agent, but he dared not  confide the knowledge of his affairs to any other individual. The estate  was so complicated, that Warren offered the heirs a good round sum  for his quittance, and to take the settlement upon himself. India so  distant, and Chancery so near--the heirs accepted the proposition.  Winding up this estate, Warren avenged the cause "]]]
