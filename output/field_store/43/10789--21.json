Thou  hast treated me as an enemy, driving away my cattle, and by persuading  my daughters to run away from their father; and by carrying home those  sacred paternal images which were worshipped by my forefathers, and have  been honored with the like worship which they paid them by myself. In  short, thou hast done this whilst thou art my kinsman, and my sister's  son, and the husband of my daughters, and was hospitably treated by me,  and didst eat at my table.\" When Laban had said this, Jacob made his  defenseÂ—That he was not the only person in whom God had implanted the  love of his native country, but that he had made it natural to all men;  and that therefore it was but reasonable that, after so long time, he  should go back to it. \"But as to the prey, of whose driving away thou  accusest me, if any other person were the arbitrator, thou wouldst be  found in the wrong; for instead of those thanks I ought to have had from  thee, for both keeping thy cattle, and increasing them, how is it that  thou art unjustly angry at me because I have taken, and have with me, a  small portion of them? But then, as to thy daughters, take notice, that  it is not through any evil practices of mine that they follow me in my  return home, but from that just affection which wives naturally have to  their husbands. They follow therefore not so properly myself as their  own children.\" And thus far of his apology was made, in order to clear  himself of having acted unjustly. To which he added his own complaint  and accusation of Laban; saying, \"While I was thy sister's son, and thou  hadst given me thy daughters in marriage, thou hast worn me out with thy  harsh commands, and detained me twenty years under them. That indeed  which was required in order to my marrying thy daughters, hard as it  was, I own to have been tolerable; but as to those that were put upon me  after those marriages, they were worse, and such indeed as an enemy  would have avoided.\" For certainly Laban had used Jacob very ill; for  when he saw that God was assisting to Jacob in all that he desired, he  promised him, that of the young cattle which should be born, he should  have sometimes what was of a white color, and sometimes what should be  of a black color; but when those that came to Jacob's share proved  numerous, he did not keep his faith with him, but said he would give  them to him the next year, because of his envying him the multitude of  his possessions. He promised him as before, because he thought such an  increase was not to be expected; but when it appeared to be fact, he  deceived him.    11. But then, as to the sacred images, he bid him search for them; and  when Laban accepted of the offer, Rachel, being informed of it, put  those images into that camel's saddle on which she rode, and sat upon  it; and said, that her natural purgation hindered her rising up: so  Laban left off searching any further, not supposing that his daughter in  such circumstances would approach to those images. So he made a league  with Jacob, and bound it by oaths, that he would not bear him any malice  on account of what had happened; and Jacob made the like league, and  promised to love Laban's daughters. And these leagues they confirmed  with oaths also, which the made upon certain as whereon they erected a  pillar, in the form of an altar: whence that hill is called Gilead; and  from thence they call that land the Land of Gilead at this day. Now when  they had feasted, after the making of the league, Laban returned home.              CHAPTER 20. Concerning The Meeting Of Jacob And Esau.    1. Now as Jacob was proceeding on his journey to the land of Canaan,  angels appeared to him, and suggested to him good hope of his future  condition; and that place he named the Camp of God. And being desirous  of knowing what his brother's intentions were to him, he sent  messengers, to give him an exact account of every thing, as being  afraid, on account of the enmities between them. He charged those that  were sent, to say to Esau, \"Jacob had thought it wrong to live together  with him while he was in anger against him, and so had gone out of the  country; and that he now, thinking the length of time of his absence  must have made up their differences, was returning; that he brought with  him his wives, and his children, with what possessions he had gotten;  and delivered himself, with what was most dear to him, into his hands;  and should think it his greatest happiness to partake together with his  brother of what God had bestowed upon him.\" So these messengers told him  this message. Upon which Esau was very glad, and met his brother with  four hundred men. And Jacob, when he heard that he was coming to meet  him with such a number of men, was greatly afraid: however, he committed  his hope of deliverance to God; and considered how, in his present  circumstances, he might preserve himself and those that were with him,  and overcome his enemies if they attacked him injuriously. He therefore  distributed his company into parts; some he sent before the rest, and  the others he ordered to come close behind, that so, if the first were  overpowered when his brother attacked them, they might have those that  followed as a refuge to fly unto. And when he had put his company in  this order, he sent some of them to carry presents to his brother. The  presents were made up of cattle, and a great number of four-footed  beasts, of many kinds, such as would be very acceptable to those that  received them, on account of their rarity. Those who were sent went at  certain intervals of space asunder, that, by following thick, one after  another, they might appear to be more numerous, that Esau might remit of  his anger on account of these presents, if he were still in a passion.  Instructions were also given to those that were sent to speak gently to  him.    2. When Jacob had made these appointments all the day, and night came  on, he moved on with his company; and, as they were gone over a certain  river called Jabboc, Jacob was left behind; and meeting with an angel,  he wrestled with him, the angel beginning the struggle: but he prevailed  over the angel, who used a voice, and spake to him in words, exhorting  him to be pleased with what had happened to him, and not to suppose that  his victory was a small one, but that he had overcome a divine angel,  and to esteem the victory as a sign of great blessings that should come  to him, and that his offspring should never fall, and that no man should  be too hard for his power. He also commanded him to be called Israel,  which in the Hebrew tongue signifies one that struggled with the divine  angel. 37 These promises were made at the prayer of Jacob; for when he  perceived him to be the angel of God, he desired he would signify to him  what should befall him hereafter. And when the angel had said what is  before related, he disappeared; but Jacob was pleased with these things,  and named the place Phanuel, which signifies, the face of God. Now when  he felt pain, by this struggling, upon his broad sinew, he abstained  from eating that sinew himself afterward; and for his sake it is still  not eaten by us.    3. When Jacob understood that his brother was near, he ordered his wives  to go before, each by herself, with the handmaids, that they might see  the actions of the men as they were fighting, if Esau were so disposed.  He then went up to his brother Esau, and bowed down to him, who had no  evil design upon him, but saluted him; and asked him about the company  of the children and of the women; and desired, when he had understood  all he wanted to know about them, that he would go along with him to  their father; but Jacob pretending that the cattle were weary, Esau  returned to Seir, for there was his place of habitation, he having named  the place Roughness, from his own hairy roughness.              CHAPTER 21. Concerning The Violation Of Dina's Chastity.    1. Hereupon Jacob came to the place, till this day called Tents  [Succoth]; from whence he went to Shechem, which is a city of the  Canaanites. Now as the Shechemites were keeping a festival Dina, who was  the only daughter of Jacob, went into the city to see the finery of the  women of that country. But when Shechem, the son of Hamor the king, saw  her, he defiled her by violence; and being greatly in love with her,  desired of his father that he would procure the damsel to him for a  wife. To which desire he condescended, and came to Jacob, desiring him  to give leave that his son Shechem might, according to law, marry Dina.  But Jacob, not knowing how to deny the desire of one of such great  dignity, and yet not thinking it lawful to marry his daughter to a  stranger, entreated him to give him leave to have a consultation about  what he desired him to do. So the king went away, in hopes that Jacob  would grant him this marriage. But Jacob informed his sons of the  defilement of their sister, and of the address of Hamor; and desired  them to give their advice what they should do. Upon thiss, the greatest  part said nothing, not knowing what advice to give. But Simeon and Levi,  the brethren of the damsel by the same mother, agreed between themselves  upon the action following: It being now the time of a festival, when the  Shechemites were employed in ease and feasting, they fell upon the watch  when they were asleep, and, coming into the city, slew all the males 38  as also the king, and his son, with them; but spared the women. And when  they had done this without their father's consent, they brought away  their sister.    2. Now while Jacob was astonished at the greatness of this act, and was  severely blaming his sons for it, God stood by him, and bid him be of  good courage; but to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2849"],[0,"Against Apion (#17)"],[1,"on him a burden of  fooleries and lies; for he writes of places that have no being, and not  knowing the cities he speaks of, he changes their situation; for Idumea  borders upon our country, and is near to Gaza, in which there is no  such city as Dora; although there be, it is true, a city named Dora in  Phoenicia, near Mount Carmel, but it is four days' journey from Idumea.  [12] Now, then, why does this man accuse us, because we have not gods in  common with other nations, if our fathers were so easily prevailed upon  to have Apollo come to them, and thought they saw him walking upon the  earth, and the stars with him? for certainly those who have so many  festivals, wherein they light lamps, must yet, at this rate, have never  seen a candlestick! But still it seems that while Zabidus took his  journey over the country, where were so many ten thousands of people,  nobody met him. He also, it seems, even in a time of war, found the  walls of Jerusalem destitute of guards. I omit the rest. Now the doors  of the holy house were seventy [13] cubits high, and twenty cubits  broad; they were all plated over with gold, and almost of solid gold  itself, and there were no fewer than twenty [14] men required to shut  them every day; nor was it lawful ever to leave them open, though it  seems this lamp-bearer of ours opened them easily, or thought he  opened them, as he thought he had the ass's head in his hand. Whether,  therefore, he returned it to us again, or whether Apion took it, and  brought it into the temple again, that Antiochus might find it, and  afford a handle for a second fable of Apion's, is uncertain.    11. Apion also tells a false story, when he mentions an oath of ours,  as if we \"swore by God, the Maker of the heaven, and earth, and sea,  to bear no good will to any foreigner, and particularly to none of the  Greeks.\" Now this liar ought to have said directly that, \"we would  bear no good-will to any foreigner, and particularly to none of the  Egyptians.\" For then his story about the oath would have squared with  the rest of his original forgeries, in case our forefathers had been  driven away by their kinsmen, the Egyptians, not on account of any  wickedness they had been guilty of, but on account of the calamities  they were under; for as to the Grecians, we were rather remote from them  in place, than different from them in our institutions, insomuch that we  have no enmity with them, nor any jealousy of them. On the contrary, it  hath so happened that many of them have come over to our laws, and some  of them have continued in their observation, although others of them had  not courage enough to persevere, and so departed from them again; nor  did any body ever hear this oath sworn by us: Apion, it seems, was the  only person that heard it, for he indeed was the first composer of it.    12. However, Apion deserves to be admired for his great prudence, as to  what I am going to say, which is this, \"That there is a plain mark among  us, that we neither have just laws, nor worship God as we ought to do,  because we are not governors, but are rather in subjection to Gentiles,  sometimes to one nation, and sometimes to another; and that our city  hath been liable to several calamities, while their city [Alexandria]  hath been of old time an imperial city, and not used to be in subjection  to the Romans.\" But now this man had better leave off this bragging,  for every body but himself would think that Apion said what he hath said  against himself; for there are very few nations that have had the good  fortune to continue many generations in the principality, but still the  mutations in human affairs have put them into subjection under others;  and most nations have been often subdued, and brought into subjection  by others. Now for the Egyptians, perhaps they are the only nation that  have had this extraordinary privilege, to have never served any of  those monarchs who subdued Asia and Europe, and this on account, as they  pretend, that the gods fled into their country, and saved themselves by  being changed into the shapes of wild beasts! Whereas these Egyptians  [15] are the very people that appear to have never, in all the past  ages, had one day of freedom, no, not so much as from their own lords.  For I will not reproach them with relating the manner how the Persians  used them, and this not once only, but many times, when they laid their  cities waste, demolished their temples, and cut the throats of those  animals whom they esteemed to be gods; for it is not reasonable to  imitate the clownish ignorance of Apion, who hath no regard to the  misfortunes of the Athenians, or of the Lacedemonians, the latter of  whom were styled by all men the most courageous, and the former the  most religious of the Grecians. I say nothing of such kings as have been  famous for piety, particularly of one of them, whose name was Cresus,  nor what calamities he met with in his life; I say nothing of the  citadel of Athens, of the temple at Ephesus, of that at Delphi, nor  of ten thousand others which have been burnt down, while nobody cast  reproaches on those that were the sufferers, but on those that were  the actors therein. But now we have met with Apion, an accuser of our  nation, though one that still forgets the miseries of his own people,  the Egyptians; but it is that Sesostris who was once so celebrated a king  of Egypt that hath blinded him. Now we will not brag of our kings, David  and Solomon, though they conquered many nations; accordingly we will let  them alone. However, Apion is ignorant of what every body knows, that  the Egyptians were servants to the Persians, and afterwards to the  Macedonians, when they were lords of Asia, and were no better than  slaves, while we have enjoyed liberty formerly; nay, more than that,  have had the dominion of the cities that lie round about us, and this  nearly for a hundred and twenty years together, until Pompeius Magnus.  And when all the kings every where were conquered by the Romans, our  ancestors were the only people who continued to be esteemed their  confederates and friends, on account of their fidelity to them.[16]    13. \"But,\" says Apion, \"we Jews have not had any wonderful men amongst  us, not any inventors of arts, nor any eminent for wisdom.\" He then  enumerates Socrates, and Zeno, and Cleanthes, and some others of the  same sort; and, after all, he adds himself to them, which is the most  wonderful thing of all that he says, and pronounces Alexandria to be  happy, because it hath such a citizen as he is in it; for he was  the fittest man to be a witness to his own deserts, although he hath  appeared to all others no better than a wicked mountebank, of a  corrupt life and ill discourses; on which account one may justly pity  Alexandria, if it should value itself upon such a citizen as he is.  But as to our own men, we have had those who have been as deserving  of commendation as any other whosoever, and such as have perused our  Antiquities cannot be ignorant of them.    14. As to the other things which he sets down as blameworthy, it may  perhaps be the best way to let them pass without apology, that he may  be allowed to be his own accuser, and the accuser of the rest of the  Egyptians. However, he accuses us for sacrificing animals, and for  abstaining from swine's flesh, and laughs at us for the circumcision  of our privy members. Now as for our slaughter of tame animals for  sacrifices, it is common to us and to all other men; but this Apion,  by making it a crime to sacrifice them, demonstrates himself to be  an Egyptian; for had he been either a Grecian or a Macedonian, [as he  pretends to be,] he had not shown any uneasiness at it; for those people  glory in sacrificing whole hecatombs to the gods, and make use of those  sacrifices for feasting; and yet is not the world thereby rendered  destitute of cattle, as Apion was afraid would come to pass. Yet if all  men had followed the manners of the Egyptians, the world had certainly  been made desolate as to mankind, but had been filled full of the  wildest sort of brute beasts, which, because they suppose them to be  gods, they carefully nourish. However, if any one should ask Apion which  of the Egyptians he thinks to be the most wise and most pious of them  all, he would certainly acknowledge the priests to be so; for the  histories say that two things were originally committed to their care  by their kings' injunctions, the worship of the gods, and the support of  wisdom and philosophy. Accordingly, these priests are all circumcised,  and abstain from swine's flesh; nor does any one of the other Egyptians  assist them in slaying those sacrifices they offer to the gods. Apion  was therefore quite blinded in his mind, when, for the sake of the  Egyptians, he contrived to reproach us, and to accuse such others as not  only make use of that conduct of life which he so much abuses, but have  also taught other men to be circumcised, as says Herodotus; which makes  me think that Apion is hereby justly punished for his casting such  reproaches on the laws of his own country; for he was circumcised  himself of necessity, on account of an ulcer in his privy member; and  when he received no benefit by such circumcision, but his member became  putrid, he died in great torment. Now men of good tempers ought to  observe their own laws concerning religion accurately, and to persevere  therein, but not presently to abuse the laws of other nations, while  this Apion deserted his own laws, and told lies about ours. And this  was the end of Apion's life, and this shall be the conclusion of our  discourse about him.    15. But now, since Apollonius Molo, and Lysimachus, and some others,  write treatises about our lawgiver Moses, and about our laws, which are  neither just nor true, and this partly out of ignorance, but chiefly  out of ill-will to us, while they calumniate Moses as an impostor and"]]]
