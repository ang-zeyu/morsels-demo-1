We wish to be children of the light and not of darkness; that that  day come not upon us unawares. In short we wish, like Timothy of  old, to understand the Scriptures from our very childhood;  considering that they are able to make us wise unto salvation,  through faith in Christ Jesus.    \"Again, we are told that the world is in the enjoyment of the  Millennium, or thousand years of rest, spoken of by John, the  Revelator.    \"Of course then Satan is bound, and does not tempt any man. The  martyrs of Jesus, and those who kept His commandments are raised  from the dead, and are now present on the earth reigning with Jesus  Christ. The nations learn war no more, none are in ignorance, none  in darkness, the knowledge of God covers the earth as the waters do  the seas. The cow and the leopard, the kid and the bear, the wolf  and the lamb, the lion, the serpent and the little child, all dwell  together in peace. For such events the prophets have described in  connection with the Millennium.    \"But the great announcement of all--the most important  communication made to us by Mr. Peck is concerning the time of the  second coming of Jesus Christ. It was now ascertained by him to be  postponed till the great and last day; and that we are to have a  Millennium of _three hundred and sixty-five thousand years_  first, before Christ comes. Only think! '_three hundred and  sixty-five thousand_!' Why, according to this calculation the  world is yet in its infancy; we are early in the morning of  creation. The great day of the existence of the world has only  dawned; a long and glorious race is yet before the generations of  man. What is the age of Adam or Methuselah! What the few fleet  years of the earth's existence, compared to the time yet to come  before its end!    \"O, ye holy prophets and saints of old, had you been in  possession of the knowledge of the astounding facts now announced  by this reverend gentleman, you would never have warned mankind so  repeatedly to be ready for the great day of the Lord, for it was  soon at hand.    \"And had Jesus Christ known this fact, he would never have  warned the world of the danger of that day coming on them unawares.  He and His Apostles would have said: it is yet far--very far off.  The Millennium must first dawn, and then continue three hundred and  sixty-five thousand years; and then, behold, I will come to judge  the world.    \"But, my hearers, please read the prophet Zechariah on this  subject, chapter 14.    \"We were there informed that 'Jesus Christ will come, and all  the saints with him,'--that he will 'set his feet on the Mount of  Olives;' that he will 'deliver the Jews and Jerusalem from their  enemies;' that he will 'destroy those who are in the siege against  that city;' and that he will 'reign as a king over all the earth,  from that time forth; and there shall be one Lord and his name  one.'    \"Now, if he comes and all the saints with him, it cannot be his  first coming. If he comes to fight for the Jews and overthrow their  enemies, it cannot be his first coming. If the Mount of Olives  rends in twain at the same time, and opens so as to form a great  valley in the place thereof, it has no connection with his first  coming.    \"Again, if he comes to reign as a '_King over all the earth  _,' it can have no allusion to the last judgment,--the end of  the earth. Consequently, if Zechariah has told the truth, we are to  expect the coming of Jesus Christ distinct from his first coming;  unconnected with the last judgment at the very commencement of his  reign of a thousand years, which we call the Millennium; but which,  Mr. Peck says, has commenced, entirely independent of any such  event. But what can we expect of a man when he comments upon the  prophecies, while at the same time he contends that none can  understand them until after their fulfillment.    \"Of course, my hearers, he himself acts upon the principle which  he lays down to others; and if he does, he never studies, never  searches the prophecies, acknowledges himself in darkness on all  subjects connected with unfulfilled prophecy; expects to remain so,  and expects his hearers to do the same.    \"O, my beloved friends, have the people of this western country  been led in darkness for so many years by learned and reverend  gentlemen? are they willing to remain in darkness now, when the  veil is withdrawn, and his folly made manifest before all the  people, and this too by his own words, uttered in presence of you  all?    \"If so, follow him, and cleave to him as your teacher. But if  not, we exhort you to hold fast the truth as we have delivered it  to you; come forward this day, and obey the ordinances of God; seek  for the Holy Spirit to guide you into all truth, and continue to  search the Scriptures for more light, and God will bless you  forever. Amen.\"    After this meeting some of the Baptists and others came forward  and were baptized, and joined the Church of the Saints; and the  people in general remained steadfast in the faith, and were unmoved  by the exertions of Messrs. Peck and Dotson.    This filled them with envy, and they soon began to manifest a  lying and abusive spirit to such a degree that all the people could  see and distinguish plainly between the spirits of truth and error.    Mr. Peck soon took leave and retired home, and we continued our  mission.    Hundreds of the people were convinced of the truth, but the  hearts of many were too much set on the world to obey the gospel;  we, therefore, baptized only a few of the people, and organized a  small Society, and about the first of June took leave and returned  home.    Having rested myself a few days, I now commenced again to  cultivate the earth. I plowed about six acres of ground for wheat,  and was busy from day to day in the woods, preparing timber to  fence the same, when the following dream, or night vision, was  given me:    A man came to me and called me with a loud voice: \"Parley,  Parley.\" I answered, \"Here am I.\" Said he, \"Cease splitting rails,  for the Lord has prepared you for a greater work.\" I answered,  \"Whereby shall I know that this message is from the Lord?\" He  replied, \"Follow me, and I will show you.\"    I followed him for some distance along a long path, and at last  came to a place of ancient sepulchres, where many of the Nephites  of old had been buried. One of these opened--the flesh of the man  withered away; he became like a skeleton, and passed down into the  grave. I understood and knew by the spirit, that this signified  that it was the voice of one from the dead which had spoken to me.  I therefore exclaimed, \"It is enough; I know the message is of the  Lord; return unto me, that we may converse together.\" He then came  forth out of the grave, was again clothed upon with a body like a  man, and he talked with me, and told me many things.    I awoke the next morning, and thought of my dream, but I was  necessitated, as I thought, to finish my fence and sow my crop  before I ceased to labor with my hands. I, therefore, continued to  make and haul rails from the woods. I perfected my fence and sowed  my crop, but I never reaped; I never saw the wheat after it was  more than three inches high.

It was now the summer of 1833. Immigration had poured into the  County of Jackson in great numbers; and the Church in that county  now numbered upwards of one thousand souls. These had all purchased  lands and paid for them, and most of them were improving in  buildings and in cultivation. Peace and plenty had crowned their  labors, and the wilderness became a fruitful field, and the  solitary place began to bud and blossom as the rose.    They lived in peace and quiet; no lawsuits with each other or  with the world; few or no debts were contracted; few promises  broken; there were no thieves, robbers, or murderers; few or no  idlers; all seemed to worship God with a ready heart. On Sundays  the people assembled to preach, pray, sing, and receive the  ordinances of God. Other days all seemed busy in the various  pursuits of industry. In short, there has seldom, if ever, been a  happier people upon the earth than the Church of the Saints now  were.    In the latter part of summer and in the autumn, I devoted almost  my entire time in ministering among the churches; holding meetings;  visiting the sick; comforting the afflicted, and giving counsel. A  school of Elders was also organized, over which I was called to  preside. This class, to the number of about sixty, met for  instruction once a week. The place of meeting was in the open air,  under some tall trees, in a retired place in the wilderness, where  we prayed, preached and prophesied, and exercised ourselves in the  gifts of the Holy Spirit. Here great blessings were poured out, and  many great and marvelous things were manifested and taught. The  Lord gave me great wisdom, and enabled me to teach and edify the  Elders, and comfort and encourage them in their preparations for  the great work which lay before us.

(Edna always  maintained that this man had been unusually good to her, although  she so strangely made in court the false accusations of prolonged  sex immorality on his part and reiterated these statements even  to us.  It was not until many months afterward that she  acknowledged the falsity of her accusations, although we knew  from her physician that they were not true.)    The first time Edna was in court was when she was about 14 years  old.  At that time she had been observed by a department store  detective stealing hosiery and a bracelet.  She perceived she was  being shadowed and walked up to the counter and ordered some  children's garments, having them charged and sent to a fictitious  name and address.  The detective thought this a masterpiece of  slyness, this endeavor to throw them off the track.  Since the  family, who really kept an account at this store, appealed to the  manager to have Edna let off as it was an ordinary trick of a  growing girl, the charge was withdrawn.  Detectives who had been  employed from a private agency made a very poor showing on  getting at the real facts.  The husband was doing well in his  business and there never seemed to be any reason to suspect his  wife of being directly or indirectly connected with the  shoplifting.  Earlier there was some intimation that Edna was not  the child of these people, but the persons who suggested this did  not know the true facts and were found to have a grudge against  the mother.  In the meantime the latter had strongly maintained  her relationship.    It was months after this and just before we saw the case when a  detective, who had kept the case in mind, went to the house to  get the goods which Edna maintained had been stolen.  There he  found the ``mother'' and another woman smoking and thought he  detected signs of their being drug habitues.  Later, I myself  felt sure of this point, but we were never able to state to what  drug they were addicted.  Edna frequently stated she had been  accustomed to buying morphine for these women, but her statements  about its appearance and its cost were so at variance with the  facts that though it is likely she had bought something of the  kind, yet no amount of inquiry brought out the definite facts.  The woman's appearance and her remarkable lack of veracity were  both highly suggestive of a drug habit.    In our several interviews with this woman we were amazed by her  strange self-contradictions.  It was not only that she stated  something different from what she had said a week before, but  even at different times on the same day her statements would be  changed.  Concerning her relationship to Edna she gave us the  facts of the girl's birth and laughed off the idea that she was  not the girl's mother.  ``Why, I can remember every moment of my  pregnancy with her.''  It was anomalous that this woman had hired  a righteous man as a lawyer to represent her and the girl.  This  attorney, consulting with me, soon came to the conclusion that  the only interest he would serve in the case was that of the  girl, and then only in the effort to save her from the miserable  influences of her mother.    Edna's school record was most peculiar.  She had been frequently  changed on account of her dishonesty.  In one sectarian school  she was said to steal all sorts of useless things--bits of  string, pieces of pencils, and articles no one else would want.  She also stole a two dollar bill from a grocery store; the  cashier followed her and recovered the money from her person  right there in the school.  Edna always denied that she took  things.  While in another school she had flowers sent to all the  teachers and the florist's bill was presented to her there.  In  still another school she took a pair of shoes from a boy at  recess, wore these and left her old ones in the locker room.  Her  word was everywhere recognized as being most unreliable.    After the case had long been in court and Edna still stoutly  maintained that she was not the child of these parents, but had  complicated her story by adding incidents which were known to be  untrue, such as her ``father's'' immorality with her, that there  had been another adopted child in the family, that even the  dishes the family used were stolen by her, and so on, the woman  came and suddenly blurted out that she herself had been lying all  along and that this was not her child.  She then alleged the  parentage was so and so, but this matter was in turn looked up  and found to be false.  It was adjudged that these people had  absolutely no parental rights, and then work was begun on  constructive measures of redeeming the girl if possible.  It was  not long after this that the nurse came to us who had known the  girl's real mother in New York and who had taken charge of Edna  as an infant before her foster mother had taken her.  It seems  that the mother was an American, that this child was  illegitimate.  A few months after her birth the mother abandoned  her, became dissolute and is said to have since died.    Edna had run away from home on several occasions and slept in  hallways for a night or two at a time.  She had not been sexually  immoral until just previous to our seeing her.  Then while away  from home she had gone with a man to a hotel, and probably had  also been with boys.  These were her first and last experiences  of the sort, but how much these affairs had been on her mind we  obtained some intimation of from herself.    ``My mother took me to S's when I was 8 years old and told me to  take anything I could and I got into the habit of it.  I can't  stop myself.  I take anything I want.  Mother said she would kill  me if I told the truth.  I had to say lots of things that were  not so.  I had to lie and say mother did not beat me, but she had  a horsewhip that was plaited, father burned it.  Then they bought  a little one, but she beat me with a rubber hose and everything.  The first thing I think I stole was jewelry in a store down-town.  The woman I call `auntie' said if I would give her the goods she  would pay me for them.''    ``My mother fixed it up that if she got the goods and got caught  she would get a clerk to make out receipts and get them stamped  paid.  She has not done this yet, but I think she will in this  case.''  (This was a statement at the very first interview with  Edna and no doubt had reference to the fact that the mother could  produce receipted bills for the dress and other articles which  Edna had maintained to the detective she herself had stolen.  Of  course the girl's story of this was untrue; the receipts were  genuine.)    ``One of my sisters is adopted, but my father does not know it.  She ain't real.  It was this way.  When my pa was out west for a  year ma asked me to look in the papers for a baby and I looked  and found an advertisement about one.  Ma said she must not be  redheaded because that ain't like the family.  We went and got  her and ma went to bed for nine days and pretended it was her  baby.  She took a shawl and gave the nurse $25 and made out  adoption papers.  She took me with her.  It was a month old.  She  made me go and tell my aunt I had a little sister.  My aunt said  it looked kind of big for 3 days old, but ma said she had been  keeping it in an incubator.  She had padded herself out before,  and pretended it was her own child.  Pa came home when it was six  months old and he loved the baby just like his own.  I ain't  jealous, but it makes me sick to hear such lies.''    This alleged fact, reiterated to us and testified to in the  court, was in itself a source of the whole case being farther  followed up.  The nurse was found who took care of Edna's  ``mother'' during her confinement and it was found that Edna's  whole story was quite untrue.  It was evidently an elaborate  fabrication representing the facts as they might have been about  Edna herself.  The only part of it that was true was that one of  the younger children had been for a time in an incubator.    ``Since I was 10 years old I have known about that.  I have known  I was not her child.  She said something that sounded queer to me  once when I ran away.  It made me think she was not my mother.    ``Why do I tell lies?  I got started at it when I was small.  She  used to make me tell lies to my father.  I began to steal when I  was about 8 years old.  My little sister has started to take  things already.  She is only 4.  I was trying to break her and  mother said, `Let her alone.'    ``She's had about nine different servants.  She never can keep  any.  She used to make me forge letters.  She made me sign a  girl's name to a receipt for wages which the girl never received.  The girl had no case against her because she had the receipts.  The poor girl lost it.    ``I am going to tell the truth.  There's going to be lots of  things come out.  I am going to tell the judge I lied when I told  him I did not steal the things.  Why did I lie?  Well, she gave  me just one look and I knew what she would do to me when I got  home.  Everything I told you about my father is the truth.  Where  else would I get that disease?  I was never allowed to go out  with boys.''    At another time when we inquired what bothered or worried her  more than anything else we obtained an account of her sex  repressions.  Of course there would always be difficulty in  knowing just how true the details were but probably she gave us  the main factors in her mental life.    ``I used to be out in the streets all the time.  There were  hardly any houses around there then.  I used to hear mother talk  about things.  She would send me out of the room and say it was  not for me to hear.  Then boys lived near me and they asked me to  do bad things.  I first heard about those things from a boy on  the porch.  I was 7 or 8.  I was always thinking about it--what  my mother said at that time, I mean.  She did not"]]]
