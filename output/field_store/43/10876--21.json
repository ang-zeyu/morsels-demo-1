Greatness does not lie in riches or in  brute strength, but a strong will and a good heart. And, my friends, God  sometimes shows us this very clearly; indeed, we Jews of Barnow can tell  how our eyes were opened to this truth. On two different occasions our  community was plunged in great danger and suffering from the oppression  of the Gentiles around us, and on each of these occasions a saviour came  forward from among us, and delivering us from our distresses, turned our  mourning into joy. Who were these saviours of the people? Were they the  strongest or the richest of the congregation?... Listen to me and I will  tell you how it all happened.    \"When you cross the market-place, you see a great big block of wood  sticking out of the ground in front of the Dominican monastery. It is  weather-beaten and decayed, and would have been taken away long ago,  were it not kept as a memorial of a time of terror and despair.    \"You know nothing of those old days, and you may be thankful for it! If  I tell you about that time of misery, it is not that I wish to make your  hearts heavy with grief for what is past and gone, or to fill them with  bitter anger or hate. No; the sorrows of which I speak are over and done  with, and those who suffered from them are dead and buried. It is  written among the sayings of one of our wise and holy men: 'Forgive  those who have trespassed against you, and return good for evil.' What I  am going to tell you is the history of a great and noble deed that was  done by one who lived and suffered during that time of dire distress--a  deed that should make your hearts beat high when you hear of it, for it  is as heroic, good, and great as was ever done on the face of the earth.    \"Its author was a simple Jewish woman, whose heart had been steeled to  heroism by the force of circumstances. Her name was Lea, and she was the  wife of a rich and pious man called Samuel. The family was afterward  given the surname of Beermann when the Austrians came into the country,  and made it the law that our people should have German names as well as  their old ones; for at the time when these events took place we had no  such names. It was more than a hundred years ago, and we were still  living under the rule of the Polish nobles.    \"The single-headed white eagle was indeed a cruel bird of prey! Long  ago, when it was full-plumaged, when its eyes were clear and piercing,  and its talons firm and relentless in their grip, it was a proud and  noble bird that held its own against both West and North, and protected  all who took refuge under its wing most generously. For three hundred  years we lived a free and happy life under the shadow of its wings; but  when the eagle grew old and weak, and the other birds of prey round  about had deprived it of many of its feathers, it became cowardly, sly,  and cruel; and because it did not dare to attack its enemies, it turned  its wrath upon the defenseless Jews. The power of the kings of Poland  became a subject for children to jest about, and then the letters of  freedom we had been given of old were no longer of any avail. The nobles  became our masters. They oppressed us, extorted money from us, and  disposed of our lives and property as it seemed good in their eyes. Oh,  that was a time of unspeakable tribulation!    \"Barnow belonged even then to the noble family of Bortynski, to whom the  good Emperor Joseph afterward gave the title of Graf. Young Joseph  Bortynski had entered into possession of his estate that very year. He  was a quiet, pious, humble-minded man, and had been educated in a  cloister. His ways were different from those of the other young men of  his position in the neighborhood, for he hated wine, cards, and women,  looked after the management of his property, and prayed four hours a  day. He was just and kind in his dealings with his serfs; but we  experienced very little of his kindness and justice, for he was hard and  cruel to us. He once gave Samuel, the leader of the synagogue, his  reason for treating us so badly: 'You crucified my God,' he said.  Whenever he was inclined to act toward us with less harshness, he was  prevented doing so by his private chaplain, a man who had formerly been  his tutor, and who had great influence over him. His name has not come  down to us, but he was always talked of as the 'black priest.'    \"We Jews used to be very careful of our conduct in those days, and even  those of our number who were evil-disposed refrained from deeds of  wickedness. 'You crucified my God,' the Graf had said to Samuel, and had  then added in a threatening tone: 'I give you fair warning, that if I  find any of your people guilty of a crime, I shall burn your town as  your God once did to Sodom and Gomorrah.' Our fears may be better  imagined than described.    \"So the spring of 1773 began. The Easter festival was about to commence,  when it was rumored that the Empress-Queen at Vienna intended to deprive  the Poles of their remaining power, and to govern the land hence-forward  by means of her own officials. But so far as we could see, there was no  sign of this intention being carried out.    \"Samuel, the leader of the synagogue, and his wife Lea, lived in the old  house in the market-place that is still known as the 'yellow house.'  They were both very much respected by the community: the husband,  because of his riches, wisdom, and piety; and the beautiful young wife,  because of her gentleness and beneficence. They were in great trouble  that Easter, for their only child, a little boy of a year and a half  old, had died suddenly a few days before.    \"Late one Sunday evening they were sitting together in silent grief. The  Easter festival was to begin on the following evening, and Lea was very  tired, for she had been busy all day long cleaning and dusting the whole  house from top to bottom. Suddenly they were startled by a loud knocking  at the house-door. Samuel opened the window and looked out. An old  peasant-woman was standing at the door with a bundle on her back. On  seeing the master of the house, she moaned out a piteous entreaty for  admittance. She was too weak, she said, to walk home to her village that  evening, and so she begged Samuel to give her shelter for the night.    \"'This isn't an inn,' answered Samuel, shortly, at the same time  shutting the window.    \"'Poor thing,' said Lea, 'ought we to send her away?'    \"'We're living in dangerous times,' replied Samuel; 'I don't like to  admit a stranger into my house.'    \"'But this poor creature is ill and weak,' said Lea.    \"And as the old woman outside continued to make an appeal to his pity,  Samuel gave way and let her in. The maid-servants were all in bed and  asleep, so Lea took her guest to a garret-room, and, after providing her  with food and wine, wished her good-night, and left her.    \"Next morning the stranger took leave of her hostess very early, and  with many expressions of gratitude. Lea was so busy all day making the  final preparations for the feast, that she had not time to visit the  room that had been occupied by the old woman until late in the  afternoon, when she was making a last round of the house to see that no  leavened bread was anywhere to be found. The room was perfectly neat and  tidy, but she was astonished to find it pervaded by a most disagreeable  smell. She opened the window, but that had no effect. She hunted about  for the cause of the horrible odor. At length, on looking under the bed,  she saw what made her blood run cold and her hair stand on end with  terror. For under the bed there lay the naked corpse of a half-starved  little child, with great wounds in its neck and chest. Lea at once  understood what had happened, and struggled hard against the faintness  that threatened to overpower her. The old woman had brought the corpse  to the house, and had concealed it there, in order that the hideous old  story might be revived that the Jews were in the habit of killing  Christian children before the feast of the Passover; and terrible would  be the vengeance taken by the Christians of the neighborhood. Lea  recognized the full horrors of her position, and remembered the Graf's  warning to her husband. She was nearly overwhelmed with the weight of  her misery. For was it not she, and she alone, who, by inducing her  husband to admit the woman into the house, had brought all the sorrow,  persecution, and death that would surely come upon her home and upon the  whole Jewish community? While she sat there shivering with fever and  anguish, she heard wild cries, shrieks, and the sound of weeping in the  street, and also the clank of swords. 'They are coming,' she muttered,  and at the same moment a thought flashed into her mind, far more strange  and horrible than a woman's brain had ever before conceived, and yet so  noble and self-sacrificing that a woman alone could have entertained it.  'It was my fault,' she said to herself, 'and I alone must bear the  consequences.' She rose to her feet, pressed her lips firmly together,  and after a struggle regained her composure. Then taking up the child's  corpse, she wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid it on her knee.    \"She listened; ... the minutes seemed to drag. Then she heard the young  Graf's voice outside speaking passionately to her husband and another  member of the session in these words: 'The woman heard the death-rattle  distinctly. I will not leave one stone upon another if I find the body.'  She heard the men going through all the rooms in the house. As their  steps approached the one in which she was seated, she rose and went to  the window, below which the roof fell away steeply, and overhung the  paved courtyard of the house.    \"The door was thrown open violently; the Graf entered, accompanied by  the two members of session, and followed by his men-at-arms. Lea sprang  forward to meet them with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3462"],[0,"More Hunting Wasps (#17)"],[1,"her to put an end to my teasing: she would  only have to descend straightway with her game, instead of leaving it  for a moment on her doorstep. But, faithful to the usages of her race,  she behaves as her ancestors behaved before her, even though the ancient  custom happen to be unprofitable. Like the Yellow-winged Sphex, whom I  have teased so often during her cellaring-operations, she is a narrow  conservative, learning nothing and forgetting nothing.    Let us leave her to do her work in peace. The Locust disappears  underground and the egg is laid upon the breast of the paralysed insect.  That is all: one carcase for each cell, no more. The entrance is stopped  at last, first with stones, which will prevent the trickling of the  embankment into the chamber; next with sweepings of dust, under which  every vestige of the subterranean house disappears. It is now done:  the Tachytes will come here no more. Other burrows will occupy her,  distributed at the whim of her vagabond humour.    A cell provisioned before my eyes on the 22nd of August, in one of the  walls in the harmas, contained the finished cocoon a week later. (The  harmas was the piece of enclosed waste land in which the author used to  study his insects in their natural state. Cf. \"The Life of the Fly,\"  by J. Henri Fabre, translated by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos: chapter  1.--Translator's Note.) I have not noted many examples of so rapid a  development. This cocoon recalls, in its shape and texture, that of the  Bembex-wasps. It is hard and mineralized, this is to say, the warp and  woof of silk are hidden by a thick encrustation of sand. This composite  structure seems to me characteristic of the family; at all events I find  it in the three species whose cocoons I know. If the Tachytes are nearly  related to the Spheges in diet, they are far removed from them in the  industry of their larvae. The first are workers in mosaic, encrusting a  network of silk and sand; the second weave pure silk.    Of smaller size and clad in black with trimmings of silvery down on the  edge of the abdominal segments, the Tarsal Tachytes frequents the  ledges of soft limestone in fairly populous colonies. (T. tarsina, LEP.)  (According to M. J. Perez, to whom I submitted the Wasp of which I am  about to speak, this Tachytes might well be a new species, if it is not  Lepelletier's T. tarsina or its equivalent, Panzer's T. unicolor. Any  one wishing to clear up this point will always recognize the quarrelsome  insect by its behaviour. A minute description seems useless to me in the  type of investigation which I am pursuing.--Author's Note.) August and  September are the season of her labours. Her burrows, very close to  one another when an easily-worked vein presents itself, afford an ample  harvest of cocoons once the site is discovered. In a certain gravel-pit  in the neighbourhood, with vertical walls visited by the sun, I have  been able within a short space of time to collect enough to fill the  hollow of my hand completely. They differ from the cocoons of the  preceding species only in their smaller size. The provisions consist of  young Acridians, varying from about a quarter to half an inch in length.  The adult insect does not appear in the assorted bags of game, being  no doubt too tough for the feeble grub. All the carcases consist of  Locust-larvae, whose budding wings leave the back uncovered and put one  in mind of the short skirts of a skimpy jacket. Small so that it may be  tender, the game is numerous so that it may suffice all needs. I  count from two to four carcases to a cell. When the time comes we will  discover the reason for these differences in the rations served.    The Mantis-killing Tachytes wears a red scarf, like her kinswoman,  Panzer's Tachytes. (The Mantis-hunting Tachytes was submitted to  examination by M. J. Perez, who failed to recognize her. This species  may well be new to our fauna. I confine myself to calling her the  Mantis-killing Tachytes and leave to the specialists the task of  adorning her with a Latin name, if it be really the fact that the Wasp  is not yet catalogued. I will be brief in my delineation. To my thinking  the best description is this: mantis-hunter. With this information it  is impossible to mistake the insect, in my district of course. I may add  that it is black, with the first two abdominal segments, the legs and  the tarsi a rusty red. Clad in the same livery and much smaller than the  female, the male is remarkable for his eyes, which are of a beautiful  lemon-yellow when he is alive. The length is nearly half an inch for the  female and a little more than half this for the male.--Author's Note.)  I do not think that she is very widely distributed. I made her  acquaintance in the Serignan woods, where she inhabits, or rather used  to inhabit--for I fear that I have depopulated and even destroyed the  community by my repeated excavations--where she used to inhabit one of  those little mounds of sand which the wind heaps up against the rosemary  clumps. Outside this small community, I never saw her again. Her  history, rich in incident, will be given with all the detail which  it deserves. I will confine myself for the moment to mentioning her  rations, which consist of Mantis-larvae, those of the Praying Mantis  predominating. (Cf. \"The Life of the Grasshopper\": chapters 6 to  9.--Translator's Note.) My lists record from three to sixteen heads for  each cell. Once again we note a great inequality of rations, the reason  for which we must try to discover.    What shall I say of the Black Tachytes (T. nigra, VAN DER LIND) that I  have not already said in telling the story of the Yellow-winged Sphex?  (\"The Hunting Wasps\": chapters 4 to 6.--Translator's Note.) I have there  described her contests with the Sphex, whose burrow she seems to me  to have usurped; I show her dragging along the ruts in the roads a  paralysed Cricket, seized by the hauling-ropes, his antennae; I speak of  her hesitations, which lead me to suspect her for a homeless vagabond,  and finally on her surrender of her game, with which she seems at once  satisfied and embarrassed. Save for the dispute with the Sphex, an  unique event in my records as observer, I have seen all the rest many  a time, but never anything more. The Black Tachytes, though the most  frequent of all in my neighbourhood, remains a riddle to me. I  know nothing of her dwelling, her larvae, her cocoons, her  family-arrangements. All that I can affirm, judging by the invariable  nature of the prey which one sees her dragging along, is that she must  feed her larvae on the same non-adult Cricket that the Yellow-winged  Sphex chooses for hers.    Is she a poacher, a pillager of other's property, or a genuine huntress?  My suspicions are persistent, though I know how chary a man should be of  suspicions. At one time I had my doubts about Panzer's Tachytes, whom  I grudged a prey to which the White-banded Sphex might have laid claim.  To-day I have no such doubts: she is an honest worker and her game is  really the result of her hunting. While waiting for the truth to be  revealed and my suspicions set aside, I will complete the little that I  know of her by noting that the Black Tachytes passes the winter in  the adult form and away from her cell. She hibernates, like the Hairy  Ammophila. In warm, sheltered places, with low, perpendicular, bare  banks, dear to the Wasps, I am certain of finding her at any time during  the winter, however briefly I investigate the earthen surface, riddled  with galleries. I find the Tachytes cowering singly in the hot oven  formed by the end of a tunnel. If the temperature be mild and the sky  clear, she emerges from her retreat in January and February and comes to  the surface of the bank to see whether spring is making progress.  When the shadows fall and the heat decreases, she reenters her  winter-quarters.    The Anathema Tachytes (T. anathema, VAN DER LIND), the giant of her  race, almost as large as the Languedocian Sphex and, like her, decorated  with a red scarf round the base of the abdomen, is rarer than any of  her congeners. I have come upon her only some four or five times, as an  isolated individual and always in circumstances which will tell us  of the nature of her game with a probability that comes very near to  certainty. She hunts underground, like the Scoliae. In September I see  her go down into the soil, which has been loosened by a recent light  shower; the movement of the earth turned over keeps me informed of her  subterranean progress. She is like the Mole, ploughing through a meadow  in pursuit of his White Worm. She comes out farther on, nearly a yard  from the spot at which she went in. This long journey underground has  taken her only a few minutes.    Is this due to extraordinary powers of excavation on her part? By no  means: the Anathema Tachytes is an energetic tunneller, no doubt, but,  after all, is incapable of performing so great a labour in so short  a time. If the underground worker is so swift in her progress, it is  because the track followed has already been covered by another. The  trail is ready prepared. We will describe it, for it is clearly defined  before the intervention of the Wasp.    On the surface of the ground, for a length of two paces at most, runs  a sinuous line, a beading of crumbled soil, roughly the width of my  finger. From this line of ramifications (others) shoot out to left and  right, much shorter and irregularly distributed. One need not be a great  entomological scholar to recognize, at the first glance, in these pads  of raised earth, the trail of a Mole-cricket, the Mole among insects. It  is the Mole-cricket who, seeking for a root to suit her, has excavated  the winding tunnel, with investigation-galleries grafted to either side  of the main road. The passage is free therefore, or at most blocked by a  few landslips, of which the Tachytes will easily"]]]
