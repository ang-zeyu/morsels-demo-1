In short, Harland was not only addicted to drink, but he was given over  to it hand and soul. Yet he was very seldom drunk. He paused at that  excessively polite stage which was the surveyor's line of inebriety. An  eminent bar-keeper pointed him out one day and said:    \"It isn't the boys that get drunk and then get over it, that go to the  devil so fast: it's the fellows that take a little all day long and keep  at it who can't be reformed.\"    So it naturally came about that while Harland Slack was in this  benevolent mood, which usually lasted from ten in the morning till one  in the morning, and which might aptly be described as betwixt Hell and  Earth, he became the common prey of common humanity.        His was not to reason why;      His was but to lend a fi'.      Theirs was but to take and sigh:      \"I'll pay you sometime by and by.\"    He seemed to take it as a compliment that his purse was everybody's  bank, with a daily run on it. It was lucky for him that the enormous  principal left by his economical father could not be touched. But at  last, as it once in a while happens to the repleted, the unqualified  ability to borrow, or rather, in this instance, to steal, led to a pall.  Unlock every safe, unbar every vault, open up every store to pillage,  and the robber, glutted with desire, will disappear. On the same  principle, at the time of our historiette, Harland's friends, even his  bar-room acquaintances, were overtaken by a sentiment of self-reproach  or honor, and there was a general movement to swear off borrowing from  this man who never refused a loan.    On the evening of which we speak Harland sat languidly waiting for a  friend who had an appointment to accompany him to the club. It was  early, scarcely eight, and he aimlessly fingered a loose roll of bills  in his waistcoat pocket, smiled inanely at the man behind the desk, and  then, despairing of entertainment, began to spin a trade-dollar on the  polished table. The cafe was nearly empty, and he was to all purposes  alone. This was a state which he dreaded above all others. Like  Napoleon, in the company of even one he felt an inspiring confidence and  security. When he was with people, he forgot that whiskey was an  insisting necessity: he only thought he drank because he was a good  fellow and \"one of the boys.\"    Harland had never been visited by the uttermost penalty of his  condition. It cannot be said that he never feared that state whose ugly  name we omit when we can, or reduce to its significant initials; as if  that reduced the horror of the fact. But he feared it: he feared it  greatly. The possibility of delirium tremens unmanned him. Then he sweat  drops of apprehension, and with vague, shuffling remorse promised  himself to improve. He possessed all the weakness of Sydney Carton with  none of that martyr's pathetic nobility or ability.    Harland Slack sat alone and began to scowl at the bottle of Apollinaris.  His weak face looked haggard. Perhaps he felt that he had cast the key  of his tomb through the grated door after he had immured himself within.  He glared at the whiskey, and his thoughts cursed it; then he smiled and  took another swallow. Even as he drank his mind wandered back to his  college days when he was unimplicated in high treason against himself.  He could not help remembering, sometimes: he seldom thought of the  future.    The door opened. He tossed the remainder of his glass off, and looked  around, expecting his companion. Then he turned back, disappointed. Then  he looked again.    A stalwart man entered with an air of vitality which is often mistaken  for authority. The vigorous development of his body gave a startling  impression of height and power. He was dressed with elegant negligence.  His dark beard was cut to a point, and he looked like a Parisian artist.  Black eyes from under the brim of a silk hat compelled attention by  reason of an imperious steadiness that indicated the possession of  unusual self-control. The waiters jumped to serve this man. Harland was  annoyed at this obsequiousness which he had never received. He tried to  look haughtily indifferent, but he could not take his eyes from this  person. The stranger returned his glance. He advanced upon the  fashionable inebriate, and paused at his table. Harland Slack arose as  if he were accepting a challenge, and trembled. The two looked at each  other.    \"I declare, old fellow. Is it you? Why, I haven't seen you since Class  Day. You know me, Slack, don't you?\"    The speaker smiled and took off his hat. This action heightened the  impression of power which he had first made. His forehead was literally  the dome of his body. It was as if the Creator had determined on  granting this man an unusual supply of brains, and had then packed them  in until the pressure had distended the frontal lobes. His brow was an  overhanging arch, massive, high, compelling. This was so marked that the  head gave almost a painful impression of superabundant intellectuality.  Harland immediately recognized his classmate from that distinguishing  feature. It was the only recognizable one left.    \"Randolph?\"    \"The same. Do you live in Boston now?\"    \"Oh yes, of course. Sit down--and you?\"    \"I? I am a practising physician, now: that's all. Am just back from  Paris a while ago, and have taken an office. I was telephoned suddenly  to a patient out of town and ran in here for a chop before I went home.\"    The keen eyes of Dr. Alaric Randolph examined his vis-a-vis as he gave  his brief explanation. He ordered his chops, declined an offer to  drink, and noticed with professional intelligence Harland's demand for  some more whiskey and the tremulous way with which it was taken. No  words were necessary to tell this student of human miseries the nature  of Harland Slack's disease.    Randolph was as much changed for the better as his classmate was for the  worse. It was a wonder that they recognized each other at all. Harland  felt the difference, but could not analyze it; while Randolph studied it  more than he felt it. The college student who did not room in \"Beck,\"  and who was not a member of the Hasty Pudding Club, who had no time for  society and theatricals, who was never seen at Carl's, who was suspected  of being a little diffident, had suddenly become the patron; and the  classmate whose father's wealth had given him an unassailable social  rank, yielded with feeble will to his own unspoken instinct of  inferiority.    Harland's face had become weazened since he had left college. His manly  frame had shrunken. On the other hand, Alaric's features had expanded.  His skull had filled out: even his frontal arch was rounded.    \"What have you been doing in Paris, Randolph?\" asked Harland with a  good-natured laugh and a faint attempt at condescension.    Dr. Randolph looked across the table; his eyes twinkled over his  classmate's tone, but he courteously answered:    \"I've been experimenting there for five years. I went the usual round of  hospitals and studied with Pasteur, and have raised scores of colonies  of bacilli. Lately I have busied myself with investigations of too  complex a nature to discuss. And you----\"    \"Oh,--I'm a--a member of the clubs, you know. I'm now engaged in  breeding beagles. That takes lots of time you know. My father died some  years ago, and I--eh--take care of the estate.\"    \"So?\" exclaimed Randolph with a German lengthening of the vowel sound.  Then taking the opportunity while Harland was emptying his glass, he  regarded him thoughtfully.    \"Look here, Slack,\" said the young doctor after a moment's hesitation.  \"What do you say to spending the evening with me? I am lonely and want  to talk over old days. You're done up and not fit to go to the club  to-night.\"    Now Harland, though considerably astonished by the invitation, was also  flattered.    \"But my appointment! I never missed an appointment in my life, you  know,\" wavered Harland unsteadily, while shifting his eyes to the door.    \"Never mind that now. I'll leave word at the desk. Psst--garcon!\"    The Doctor spoke masterfully; the gentleman obeyed him as readily as the  servant. A pencil note, with strict injunctions for delivery solved the  inebriate's sodden difficulty. Slack insisted upon adding that he would  still meet his friend between ten and eleven o'clock. Randolph smiled  indulgently, and they passed out into the cool air arm in arm. Randolph  hailed a coupe and got his friend into it with pardonable alacrity.    Harland was unusually communicative that evening with the man from whom  he would have hardly deigned to accept a cigarette in his college days.  He could not understand the reason for what he considered this sudden  social degradation. He accepted it in a dazed way, for he had been  drinking steadily all day.    The cab stopped before one of the few stone houses less common in Boston  than in New York, whose construction is at once singularly deceptive and  honest. It had a frontage of seventeen feet.    \"A good sized dog-kennel!\" observed Harland Slack, glancing at it  superciliously as he got out.    \"These are my offices,\" answered Dr. Randolph urbanely, paying no  attention to the half-maudlin discourtesy.    Supposing that one of these houses with a frontage of seventeen feet,  has a depth of two hundred feet, and is five stories high? The  dog-kennel assumes an area of nearly half an acre. There may be large  rooms, almost a spacious salon in one of these insignificant homes.  Seemingly unlimited space behind ridiculously narrow stone walls, is one  of the many mysteries of city life.    Harland Slack sank upon the sofa, and languidly watched the Doctor turn  up the gas.    \"You haven't a nip of brandy, have you?

On  the day of trial, when the prisoner was at the bar, the dog was let  loose in the court-house, and, in the midst of some hundreds, he found  him out, though dressed entirely in new clothes, and would have torn  him to pieces had he been allowed; in consequence of which he was  condemned, and at the place of execution he confessed the fact. Surely  so useful, so disinterestedly faithful an animal, should not be so  barbarously treated as I have often seen them, particularly in London.\"    Other cases might be produced, but we shall only present that of the  dog of Montargis, which has become familiar to the public by being made  the subject of a melodrame frequently acted at the present time. The  fame of this English blood-hound has been transmitted by a monument in  basso-relievo, which still remains in the chimney-piece of the grand  hall, at the Castle of Montargis, in France. The sculpture, which  represents a dog fighting with a champion, is explained by the  following narrative: Aubri de Mondidier, a gentleman of family and  fortune, travelling alone through the Forest of Bondy, was murdered,  and buried under a tree. His dog, a bloodhound, would not quit his  master's grave for several days; till at length, compelled by hunger,  he proceeded to the house of an intimate friend of the unfortunate  Aubri, at Paris, and, by his melancholy howling, seemed desirous of  expressing the loss sustained. He repeated his cries, ran to the door,  looked back to see if any one followed him, returned to his master's  friend, pulled him by the sleeve, and, with dumb eloquence, entreated  him to go with him. The singularity of all these actions of the dog,  added to the circumstance of his coming there without his master, whose  faithful companion he had always been, prompted the company to follow  the animal, who conducted them to a tree, where he renewed his howl,  scratching the earth with his feet, and significantly entreating them  to search the particular spot. Accordingly, on digging, the body of the  unhappy Aubri was found. Some time after, the dog accidentally met the  assassin, who is styled, by all the historians that relate this fact,  the Chevalier Macaire; when, instantly seizing him by the throat, he  was with great difficulty compelled to quit his victim. In short,  whenever the dog saw the chevalier, he continued to pursue and attack  him with equal fury.    Such obstinate violence in the animal, confined only to Macaire,  appeared very extraordinary--especially as several instances of  Macaire's envy and hatred to Aubri de Mondidier had been conspicuous.  Additional circumstances created suspicion, and at length the affair  reached the royal ear. The king, Louis VIII., accordingly sent for the  dog, which appeared extremely gentle till he perceived Macaire in the  midst of several noblemen, when he ran fiercely towards him, growling  at and attacking him, as usual. The king, struck with such a  combination of circumstantial evidence against Macaire, determined to  refer the decision to the chance of battle; in other words, he gave  orders for a combat between the chevalier and the dog. The lists were  appointed in the Isle of Notre Dame, then an unenclosed, uninhabited  place, and Macaire was allowed, for his weapon, a great cudgel. An  empty cask was given to the dog as a place of retreat, to enable him to  recover breath. Every thing being prepared, the dog no sooner found  himself at liberty, than he ran round his adversary, avoiding his  blows, and menacing him on every side, till his strength was exhausted;  then springing forward, he seized him by the throat, and threw him on  the ground. Macaire now confessed his guilt in presence of the king and  the whole court. In consequence of this, the chevalier, after a few  days, was convicted upon his own acknowledgment, and beheaded on a  scaffold in the Isle of Notre Dame.    The instances in which persons have been saved from drowning by the  Newfoundland dog, are innumerable. The following anecdote is the more  remarkable, as it does not appear that the affectionate animal was of  that species. A young man belonging to the city of Paris, desirous of  getting rid of his dog, took it along with him to the River Seine. He  hired a boat, and, rowing into the stream, threw the animal in. The  poor creature attempted to climb up the side of the boat, but his  master, whose intention was to drown him, constantly pushed him back  with the oar. In doing this, he fell himself into the water, and would  certainly have been drowned, had not the dog, as soon as he saw his  master struggling in the stream, suffered the boat to float away, and  held him above the water till assistance arrived, and his life was  saved.    Of the alertness of the dog in recovering the lost property of its  master, we shall furnish a striking instance. M. Dumont, a tradesman of  the Rue St. Denis, Paris, offered to lay a wager with a friend that, if  he were to hide a six-livre piece in the dust, his dog would discover  and bring it to him. The wager was accepted, and the piece of money  secreted, after being carefully marked. When they had proceeded some  distance from the spot, M. Dumont signified to his dog that he had lost  something, and ordered him to seek it. Caniche immediately turned back,  while his master and his companion pursued their walk to the Rue St.  Denis.    Meanwhile a traveller, who happened to be just then returning in a  small chaise from Vincennes, perceived the piece of money, which his  horse had kicked from its hiding-place; he alighted, took it up, and  drove to his inn in Rue Pont-aux-Choux, and Caniche had just reached  the spot in search of the lost piece when the stranger picked it up. He  followed the chaise, went into the inn, and stuck close to the  traveller. Having scented out the coin, which he had been ordered to  bring back, in the pocket of the latter, he leaped up incessantly at  and about him. The gentleman, supposing him to be some dog that had  been lost or left behind by his master, regarded his different  movements as marks of fondness; and as the animal was handsome, he  determined to keep him. He gave him a good supper, and, on retiring to  bed, took him with him to his chamber. No sooner had he pulled off his  breeches, than they were seized by the dog; the owner, conceiving he  wanted to play with them, took them away again. The animal began to  bark at the door, which the traveller opened, under the idea that he  wanted to go out. Caniche instantly snatched up the breeches, and away  he flew. The stranger posted after him with his night-cap on, and  nearly _sans culottes_.    Anxiety for the fate of a purse full of double Napoleons, of forty  francs each, which was in one of the pockets, gave redoubled velocity  to his steps. Caniche ran full speed to his master's house, where the  stranger arrived a moment afterwards, breathless and furious. He  accused the dog of robbing him. \"Sir,\" said the master, \"my dog is a  very faithful creature, and if he has run away with your breeches, it  is because you have in them money which does not belong to you.\" The  traveller became still more exasperated. \"Compose yourself, sir,\"  rejoined the other, smiling; \"without doubt there is in your purse a  six-livre piece with such and such marks, which you picked up in the  Boulevard St. Antoine, and which I threw down there with a firm  conviction that my dog would bring it back again. This is the cause of  the robbery which he has committed upon you!\" The stranger's rage now  yielded to astonishment; he delivered the six-livre piece to the owner,  and could not forbear caressing the dog which had given him so much  uneasiness and such an unpleasant chase.    A shepherd on the Grampian Mountains, having left his child at the foot  of the hill, was soon enveloped in mist; and, unable to return to the  precise place, he could not discover the child. In vain he searched for  it in the midst of the mist, not knowing whither he went; and when, at  length, the moon shone clearly, he found himself at his cottage, and  far from the hill. He searched in vain next day, with a band of  shepherds. On returning to his cottage, he found that the dog, on  receiving a piece of cake, had instantly gone off. He renewed the  search for several days, and still the dog had disappeared, during his  absence, taking with it a piece of cake. Struck with this circumstance,  he remained at home one day, and when the dog, as usual, departed with  his piece of cake, he resolved to follow him. The dog led the way to a  cataract at some distance from the spot where the shepherd had left his  child.    The banks of the waterfall almost joined at the top, yet, separated by  an abyss of immense depth, presented that abrupt appearance which so  often astonishes and appals the traveller amidst the Grampian  Mountains. Down one of these rugged and almost perpendicular descents  the dog began, without hesitation, to make his way, and at last  disappeared in a cave, the mouth of which was almost upon a level with  the torrent. The shepherd with difficulty followed; but, on entering  the cave, what were his emotions when he beheld his infant eating, with  much satisfaction, the cake which the dog had just brought him, while  the faithful animal stood by, eyeing his young charge with the utmost  complacence. From the situation in which the child was found, it  appears that he had wandered to the brink of the precipice, and either  fallen or scrambled down till he reached the cave, which the dread of  the torrent had afterwards prevented him from leaving. The dog, by  means of his scent, had traced him to the spot, and"]]]
