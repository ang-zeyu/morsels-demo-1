East Antarctica is colder than West    Antarctica because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has    the most moderate climate; higher temperatures occur in January    along the coast and average slightly below freezing    Terrain: about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren    rock, with average elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters;    mountain ranges up to about 5,000 meters; ice-free coastal areas    include parts of southern Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic    Peninsula area, and parts of Ross Island on McMurdo Sound; glaciers    form ice shelves along about half of the coastline, and floating ice    shelves constitute 11% of the area of the continent    Elevation extremes:    lowest point: Indian Ocean 0 m    highest point: Vinson Massif 5,140 m    Natural resources: none presently exploited;

frequent blizzards form near the foot of the    plateau; cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise    along the coast; volcanism on Deception Island and isolated areas of    West Antarctica; other seismic activity rare and weak    Environment--current issues: in 1998, NASA satellite data showed    that the antarctic ozone hole was the largest on record, covering 27    million square kilometers; researchers in 1997 found that increased    ultraviolet light coming through the hole damages the DNA of    icefish, an antarctic fish lacking hemoglobin; ozone depletion    earlier was shown to harm one-celled antarctic marine plants    Environment--international agreements:    party to: none of the selected agreements    signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements    Geography--note: the coldest, windiest, highest, and driest    continent;

Administration is carried out through consultative member    meetings--the 22nd Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting was in    Norway in May 1998. At the end of 1998, there were 43 treaty member    nations: 27 consultative and 16 acceding. Consultative (voting)    members include the seven nations that claim portions of Antarctica    as national territory (some claims overlap) and 20 nonclaimant    nations. The US and some other nations that have made no claims have    reserved the right to do so. The US does not recognize the claims of    others. The year in parentheses indicates when an acceding nation    was voted to full consultative (voting) status, while no date    indicates the country was an original 1959 treaty signatory.    Claimant nations are--Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New    Zealand, Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant consultative nations    are--Belgium, Brazil (1983), Bulgaria (1978) China (1985), Ecuador    (1990), Finland (1989), Germany (1981), India (1983), Italy (1987),    Japan, South Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989), Poland    (1977), Russia, South Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay    (1985), and the US. Acceding (nonvoting) members, with year of    accession in parentheses, are--Austria (1987), Canada (1988),    Colombia (1988), Cuba (1984), Czech Republic (1993), Denmark (1965),    Greece (1987), Guatemala (1991), Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987),    Papua New Guinea (1981), Romania (1971), Slovakia (1993),    Switzerland (1990), Turkey (1995), and Ukraine (1992). Article    1--area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military activity,    such as weapons testing, is prohibited, but military personnel and    equipment may be used for scientific research or any other peaceful    purpose; Article 2--freedom of scientific investigation and    cooperation shall continue; Article 3--free exchange of information    and personnel in cooperation with the UN and other international    agencies; Article 4--does not recognize, dispute, or establish    territorial claims and no new claims shall be asserted while the    treaty is in force; Article 5 --prohibits nuclear explosions or    disposal of radioactive wastes; Article 6--includes under the treaty    all land and ice shelves south of 60 degrees 00 minutes south;    Article 7--treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial    observation, to any area and may inspect all stations,    installations, and equipment; advance notice of all activities and    of the introduction of military personnel must be given; Article    8--allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their own    states; Article 9--frequent consultative meetings take place among    member nations; Article 10--treaty states will discourage activities    by any country in Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty;    Article 11--disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties    concerned or, ultimately, by the ICJ; Articles 12, 13, 14--deal with    upholding, interpreting, and amending the treaty among involved    nations. Other agreements--some 200 recommendations adopted at treaty    consultative meetings and ratified by governments include --Agreed    Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964);    Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972);    Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources    (1980); a mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988 but was    subsequently rejected; the Protocol on Environmental Protection to    the Antarctic Treaty was signed 4 October 1991 and entered into    force 14 January 1998; this agreement provides for the protection of    the Antarctic environment through five specific annexes on marine    pollution, fauna, and flora, environmental impact assessments, waste    management, and protected areas; it prohibits all activities    relating to mineral resources except scientific research.    Legal system: US law, including certain criminal offenses by or    against US nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under    jurisdiction of other countries. Some US laws directly apply to    Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C.    section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties for the    following activities, unless authorized by regulation of statute:    the taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of    nonindigenous plants and animals; entry into specially protected or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2770"],[0,"Five Little Peppers and How They Grew (#17)"],[1,"   \"Here,\" said Mr. Atkins, stepping up to the Post-office department,  quite smart with its array of boxes and official notices, where Ben had  always lingered, wishing there might be sometime a letter for him--or  some of them. \"You've got a sister Polly, haven't you?\"    \"Yes,\" said Ben, wondering what was coming next.    \"Well, she's got a letter,\" said the postmaster, holding up a nice big  envelope, looking just like those that Ben had so many times wished  for. That magic piece of white paper danced before the boy's eyes for a  minute; then he said, \"It can't be for her, Mr. Atkins; why, she's never  had one.\"    \"Well, she's got one now, sure enough,\" said Mr. Atkins; \"here 'tis,  plain enough,\" and he read what he had no need to study much as it had  already passed examination by his own and his wife's faithful eyes:  \"Miss Polly Pepper, near the Turnpike, Badgertown'--that's her, isn't  it?\" he added, laying it down before Ben's eyes. \"Must be a first time  for everything, you know, my boy!\" and he laughed long over his own  joke; \"so take it and run along home.\" For Ben still stood looking at  it, and not offering to stir.    \"If you say so,\" said the boy, as if Mr. Atkins had given him something  out of his own pocket; \"but I'm afraid 'tisn't for Polly.\" Then  buttoning up the precious letter in his jacket, he spun along home as  never before.    \"Polly! Polly!\" he screamed. \"Where is she, mother?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Mrs. Pepper, coming out of the bedroom. \"Dear me!  is anybody hurt, Ben?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Ben, in a state to believe anything, \"but Polly's  got a letter.\"    \"Polly got a letter!\" cried Mrs. Pepper; \"what do you mean, Ben?\"    \"I don't know,\" repeated the boy, still holding out the precious letter;  \"but Mr. Atkins gave it to me; where is Polly?\"    \"I know where she is,\" said Joel; \"she's up-stairs.\" And he flew out in  a twinkling, and just as soon reappeared with Polly scampering after him  in the wildest excitement.    And then the kitchen was in an uproar as the precious missive was put  into Polly's hand; and they all gathered around her, wondering and  examining, till Ben thought he would go wild with the delay.    \"I wonder where it did come from,\" said Polly, in the greatest anxiety,  examining again the address.    \"Where does the postmark say?\" asked Mrs. Pepper, looking over her  shoulder.    \"It's all rubbed out,\" said Polly, peering at it \"you can't see  anything.\"    \"Do open it,\" said Ben, \"and then you'll find out.\"    \"But p'raps 'tisn't for me,\" said Polly, timidly.    \"Well, Mr. Atkins says 'tis,\" said Ben, impatiently; \"here, I'll open it  for you, Polly.\"    \"No, let her open it for herself, Ben,\" protested his mother.    \"But she won't,\" said Ben; \"do tear it open, Polly.\"    \"No, I'm goin' to get a knife,\" she said.    \"I'll get one,\" cried Joel, running up to the table drawer; \"here's one,  Polly.\"    \"Oh, dear,\" groaned Ben; \"you never'll get it open at this rate!\"    But at last it was cut; and they all holding their breath, gazed  awe-struck, while Polly drew out the mysterious missive.    \"What does it say?\" gasped Mrs. Pepper.    \"Dear Miss Polly,\" began both Ben and Polly in a breath. \"Let Polly  read,\" said Joel, who couldn't hear in the confusion.    \"Well, go on Polly,\" said Ben; \"hurry!\"    \"Dear Miss Polly, I was so sorry I couldn't come on Thursday--\"    \"Oh, it's Jasper! it's Jasper!\" cried all the children in a breath.    \"I told you so!\" cried Ben and Polly, perfectly delighted to find their  friend vindicated fully--\"there! Joey Pepper!\"    \"Well, I don't care,\" cried Joe, nothing daunted, \"he didn't come,  anyway--do go on, Polly.\"    \"I was so sorry I couldn't come--\" began Polly.    \"You read that,\" said Joel.    \"I know it,\" said Polly, \"but it's just lovely; 'on Thursday; but my  father was sick, and I couldn't leave him. If you don't mind I'll come  again--I mean I'll come some other day, if it's just as convenient for  you, for I do so want the baking, and the nice time. I forgot to say  that I had a cold, to,' (here Jasper had evidently had a struggle in his  mind whether there should be two o's or one, and he had at last decided  it, by crossing out one) but my father is willing I should come when I  get well. Give my love to all, and especially remember me respectfully  to your mother. Your friend,    \"JASPER ELYOT KING.\"    \"Oh, lovely! lovely!\" cried Polly, flying around with the letter in her  hand; \"so he is coming!\"    Ben was just as wild as she was, for no one knew but Polly just how the  new friend had stepped into his heart. Phronsie went to sleep happy,  hugging \"Baby.\"    \"And don't you think, Baby, dear,\" she whispered sleepily, and Polly  heard her say as she was tucking her in, \"that Jasper is really comin';  really--and the big, be-you-ti-ful doggie, too!\"          PHRONSIE PAYS A DEBT OF GRATITUDE      \"And now I tell you,\" said Polly, the next day, \"let's make Jasper  something; can't we, ma?\"    \"Oh, do! do!\" cried all the other children, \"let's; but what'll it be,  Polly?\"    \"I don't know about this,\" interrupted Mrs. Pepper; \"I don't see how you  could get anything to him if you could make it.\"    \"Oh, we could, mamsie,\" said Polly, eagerly, running up to her; \"for Ben  knows; and he says we can do it.\"    \"Oh, well, if Ben and you have had your heads together, I suppose it's  all right,\" laughed Mrs. Pepper, \"but I don't see how you can do it.\"    \"Well, we can, mother, truly,\" put in Ben. \"I'll tell you how, and  you'll say it'll be splendid. You see Deacon Blodgett's goin' over to  Hingham, to-morrow; I heard him tell Miss Blodgett so; and he goes right  past the hotel; and we can do it up real nice--and it'll please Jasper  so--do, mammy!\"    \"And it's real dull there, Jasper says,\" put in Polly, persuasively;  \"and just think, mammy, no brothers and sisters!\" And Polly looked  around on the others.    After that there was no need to say anything more; her mother would have  consented to almost any plan then.    \"Well, go on, children,\" she said; \"you may do it; I don't see but what  you can get 'em there well enough; but I'm sure I don't know what you  can make.\"    \"Can't we,\" said Polly--and she knelt down by her mother's side and put  her face in between the sewing in Mrs. Pepper's lap, and the eyes bent  kindly down on her--\"make some little cakes, real cakes I mean? now  don't say no, mammy!\" she said, alarmed, for she saw a \"no\" slowly  coming in the eyes above her, as Mrs. Pepper began to shake her head.    \"But we haven't any white flour, Polly,\" began her mother. \"I know,\"  said Polly; \"but we'll make 'em of brown, it'll do, if you'll give us  some raisins--you know there's some in the bowl, mammy.\"    \"I was saving them for a nest egg,\" said Mrs. Pepper; meaning at some  future time to indulge in another plum-pudding that the children so  loved.    \"Well, do give 'em to us,\" cried Polly; \"do, ma!\"    \"I want 'em for a plum-pudding sometime,\" said Mrs. Pepper.    \"Ow!--\" and Joel with a howl sprung up from the floor where he had been  trying to make a cart for \"Baby\" out of an old box, and joined Mrs.  Pepper and Polly. \"No, don't give 'em away, ma!\" he screamed; \"let's  have our plum-pudding--now, Polly Pepper, you're a-goin' to bake up all  our raisins in nasty little cakes--and--\"    \"Joey!\" commanded Mrs. Pepper, \"hush! what word did you say!\"    \"Well,\" blubbered Joel, wiping his tears away with his grimy little  hand, \"Polly's--a-goin'--to give--\"    \"I should rather you'd never have a plum-pudding than to say such  words,\" said Mrs. Pepper, sternly, taking up her work again. \"And  besides, do you think what Jasper has done for you?\" and her face grew  very white around the lips.    \"Well, he can have plum-puddings,\" said Joel, whimpering, \"forever an'  ever, if he wants them--and--and--\"    \"Well, Joey,\" said Polly, \"there, don't feel bad,\" and she put her arms  around him, and tried to wipe away the tears that still rolled down his  cheeks. \"We won't give 'em if you don't want us to; but Jasper's sick,  and there isn't anything for him to do, and--\" here she whispered slyly  up into his ear, \"don't you remember how you liked folks to send you  things when you had the measles?\"    \"Yes, I know,\" said Joel, beginning to smile through his tears; \"wasn't  it fun, Polly?\"    \"I guess 'twas,\" laughed Polly back again, pleased at the return of  sunshine. \"Well, Jasper'll be just as pleased as you were, 'cause we  love him and want to do somethin' for him, he was so good to Phronsie.\"    \"I will, Polly, I will,\" cried Joel, completely won over; \"do let's make  'em for him; and put 'em in thick; oh! thick as you can;\" and determined  to do nothing by halves, Joel ran generously for the precious howl of  raisins, and after setting it on the table, began to help Polly in all  needful preparations.    Mrs. Pepper smiled away to herself to see happiness restored to the  little group. And soon a pleasant hum and bustle went on around the  baking table, the centre of attraction.    \"Now,\" said Phronsie, coming up to the table and standing on tip-toe to  see Polly measure out the flour, \"I'm a-goin' to bake something for my  sick man, I am.\"    \"Oh, no, Phronsie, you can't,\" began Polly.    \"Hey?\" asked Joel, with a daub of flour on the tip of his chubby nose,  gained by too much peering into Polly's flour-bag. \"What did she say,  Polly?\" watching her shake the clouds of flour in the sieve.    \"She said she was goin' to bake something for Jasper,\" said Polly.  \"There,\" as she whisked in the flour, \"now that's done.\"    \"No, I didn't say Jasper,\" said Phronsie; \"I didn't say Jasper,\" she  repeated, emphatically.    \"Why, what did you say, Pet?\" asked Polly, astonished, while little  Davie repeated, \"What did you say, Phronsie?\"    \"I said my sick man,\" said Phronsie, shaking her yellow head; \"poor sick  man.\"    \"Who does she mean?\" said Polly in despair, stopping a moment her  violent stirring "]]]
