Little variation occurs in structure. In some specimens the second upper  tooth-row is complete; no individuals were found to have the row broadly  interrupted medially.    The series of dark dashes on the dorsal edge of the caudal musculature  is diagnostic of all stages studied. In life, tadpoles from 15 and 20  kilometers west-southwest of San Isidro el General, Costa Rica, had a  tan body, often with an olive-tan tinge; the caudal musculature was  tan; the flecks and dashes were dull red or reddish brown. Tadpoles from  6 kilometers east of Golfito, Costa Rica, had bodies with olive-green  flecks. The caudal musculature was brown with bluish green flecks; the  fins were transparent with reddish brown flecks. The belly was a silvery  golden color. Tadpoles from Bajos de Jorco, Costa Rica, had brown bodies  with bluish green flecks; the tail and fins had reddish brown flecks and  dashes. The iris was a bronze color in specimens from all three  localities, as well as in the young mentioned in the following  paragraph.    Nine recently metamorphosed young were found on vegetation at the edges  of streams in April. These specimens have snout-vent lengths of 13.1 to  15.7 mm. (14.9 mm.) and in life were pale greenish tan or olive-tan  above and white below. The hands, feet, and thighs were pale yellowish  tan.    _Remarks._--The foregoing synonymies indicate that confusion has existed  in the application of various names, to this species, as well as in use  of the names _sordida_ and _gabbi_ to include the species that we  describe and name _Smilisca sila_. Correct allocation of the names  involved was possible only after studying and comparing the type  specimens, for the descriptions given by the various authors are not  sufficiently explicit to determine the nature of many essential  features.    The presence of a rounded snout and a long white throat in males  distinguishes _S. sordida_ from _S. sila_, which has a high truncate  snout and short dark throat in males. The two syntypes of _Hyla sordida_  Peters, 1863, (ZMB 3141) are males having snout-vent lengths of 36.9 and  37.0 mm. The two syntypes of _Hyla gabbi_ Cope, 1876 (USNM 30658-9), are  females having snout-vent lengths of 52.8 and 53.7 mm., respectively.  Also included in the collections made by Gabb is eastern Costa Rica are  two males (USNM 30685-6), which Cope (1876) named and described as _Hyla  nigripes_. These specimens are soft and faded, but are recognizable as  the same as _Hyla sordida_ Peters; the syntypes of _Hyla nigripes_ have  snout-vent lengths of 37.6 and 37.7 mm. We have examined one of the  syntypes of _Hyla salvini_ Boulenger, 1882 (BMNH 1947.2.24.13), a female  having a snout-vent length of 54.6 mm. We are convinced that all of  these type specimens are representatives of one species, the earliest  name for which is _Hyla sordida_ Peters, 1863. The type localities for  three of the named species are in Costa Rica--_H. gabbi_ from Sipurio on  the Caribbean lowlands, _H. nigripes_ from the Caribbean slopes of Pico  Blanco, and _H. salvini_ from Cartago on the Meseta Central. The type  locality of _H. sordida_ was given as \"Veraguas\" by Peters (1863). At  that time Veraguas was often considered to be most of western Panama.  Though we have not seen Panamanian specimens other than the types of _S.  sordida_ and one specimen from the Pacific lowlands of western Panama,  the species probably occurs on the Caribbean slopes of western Panama.  The species has been taken on the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica  within a few kilometers of Panama; collecting on the Caribbean slopes in  the provinces of Bocas del Toro and Veraguas should reveal the presence  of _Smilisca sordida_ there.    _Distribution._--_Smilisca sordida_ is found along the Pacific slopes  and lowlands from Guanacaste, Costa Rica, southeastward to extreme  western Panama, to elevations of about 1200 meters on the Meseta Central  in Costa Rica, and on the Caribbean slopes and lowlands of Costa Rica  and probably adjacent Panama (Fig. 5). One specimen purportedly comes  from \"Rio Grande, Nicaragua.\"        [Illustration: FIG. 5.

ANALYSIS OF MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS      Osteology    In attempting to assay the taxonomic significance of skeletal  differences we are faced with a dearth of data on the skeletons of frogs  in general and hylids in particular. Recent reviews by Brattstrom (1957)  and Hecht (1962, 1963) have been concerned with general salientian  classification and phylogeny, principally at the family level. Savage  and Carvalho (1953), Griffiths (1959), and Baldauf (1959) used  osteological characters in determining the taxonomic status of the  families Pseudidae, Brachycephalidae, and Bufonidae, respectively.  Carvalho (1954) presented osteological evidence for the generic  separation of New World microhylids. Zweifel (1956) and Tihen (1962)  used osteological characters at the levels of the species-group and  species in their respective studies on _Scaphiopus_ and _Bufo_. Little  has been recorded about the skeletons of the hylids. Goin (1961)  mentioned dentigerous elements and cranial co-ossification in his  synopsis of the genera of hylids. Copland (1957) in his review of  the _Hyla_ of Australia, Funkhouser (1957) in her revision of  _Phyllomedusa_, and Zweifel (1958) in his review of _Nyctimystes_ did  not consider skeletal characters.    Some osteological studies on hylids have yielded worthwhile information.  Mittleman and List (1953) used osteological characters in defining the  genus _Limnaoedus_: Starrett (1960) used cranial characters in  combination with jaw musculature in defining the genus _Smilisca_, and  Duellman (1964) used cranial characters in delimiting the _Hyla  bistincta_ group. Brief descriptions of cranial structure were given for  _Phrynohyas_ (Duellman, 1956) and _Ptychohyla_ (Duellman, 1963a);  specific and sexual differences in the skulls of _Hyla chaneque_ and  _Hyla taeniopus_ were pointed out by Duellman (1965). Stokely and List  (1954) described early cranial development in the hylid _Pseudacris  triseriata triseriata_.    Because our knowledge of the skeleton in hylids is so incomplete, we are  not attempting to place _Smilisca_ in the general scheme of hylid  phylogeny on the basis of skeletal characters. Instead, our purposes are  to describe the skeleton and its ontogenetic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37839"],[0,"My Experiences in Manipur and the Naga Hills (#17)"],[1,"advance they did, and with such effect that in  a short time not only was Manipur cleared, but the enemy driven out  of the Kubo valley. Later on, Ghumbeer Singh was recognised as Rajah  of Manipur, and the Kubo valley was included within his territories.    Manipur at this time contained only 2000 inhabitants, the miserable  remnants of a thriving population of at least 400,000, possibly  600,000, that existed before the invasion. Ghumbeer Singh's task was to  encourage exiles to return, and to attempt to rebuild the prosperity  of his little kingdom. He was a wise and strong though severe ruler,  and though he owed his throne greatly to his own efforts, he to the  last retained the deepest feelings of loyalty and gratitude to the  British Government, promptly obeying all its orders and doing his  utmost to impress the same feeling on all his officers.    As is always the case, though we had carried all before us in the  war, we began to display great weakness afterwards. We had an agent,  Colonel Burney, at Ava, and the Burmese who were not disposed to be  at all friendly, constantly tried to impress on him the fact that  all difficulties and disputes would be at an end if we ceded the  Kubo valley to them, that territory belonging to our ally Ghumbeer  Singh of Manipur. Of course the proposal ought to have been rejected  with scorn, and a severe snub given to the Burmese officials. The  advisers of the Government of India, however, being generally officers  brought up in the Secretariat, and with little practical knowledge of  Asiatics, the manly course was not followed. It was not realised that  a display of self-confidence and strength is the best diplomacy with  people like the Burmese, and with a view to winning their good-will  we basely consented to deprive our gallant and loyal ally of part  of his territories. An attempt was made to negotiate with him, but  Major Grant said, \"It is no use bargaining with Ghumbeer Singh,\"  and refused to take any part in it. He was asked what compensation  should be given, and he said 6000 sicca rupees per annum.    When Ghumbeer Singh heard the final decision he quietly accepted  it, saying, \"You gave it me and you can take it away. I accept your  decree.\" The proposed transfer was very distasteful to many of the  inhabitants, including the Sumjok (Thoungdoot) Tsawbwa, [18] but they  were not consulted. The Kubo valley was handed over to the Burmese  on the 9th of January, 1834, and on that day Ghumbeer Singh died in  Manipur of cholera. Perhaps he was happy in the hour of his death,  as he felt the treatment of our Government most severely.                CHAPTER X.        Ghumbeer Singh and our treatment of him--Nur Singh and      attempt on his life--McCulloch--His wisdom and generosity--My      establishment--Settlement of frontier dispute.      Ghumbeer Singh did much for Manipur during his comparatively short  reign. He made all the roads in his territory safe, and subdued the  different hill-tribes who had asserted their independence during  the troubles with Burmah. Imphal, the old capital, had not been  re-occupied, though the sacred spot where the temple of Govindjee  stood was cared for; but a new palace had been built at Langthabal  at a distance of three and a half miles from Imphal where several  fine masonry buildings were erected, and a canal dug for the annual  boat races. Langthabal [19] was deserted in 1844 and the old site  re-occupied, and in my time, the buildings at Langthabal were  picturesque ruins, having been greatly injured by time and the  earthquakes of 1869 and 1880. Ghumbeer Singh left an infant son,  Chandra Kirtee Singh who was two years of age at his father's death  and a distant cousin, Nur Singh, was appointed Regent. Contrary to all  precedent, the Regent was loyal to his charge and governed well and  ably for the infant prince, in spite of constant attempts to overthrow  his government. In 1844, the Queen-Mother wishing to govern herself,  attempted to procure Nur Singh's murder as he was at prayers in the  temple. She failed and fled with her son the young Rajah Chandra  Kirtee Singh to British territory. The Regent then proclaimed himself  Rajah with the consent of all the people. The Manipur Levy had been  maintained up till 1835 when the Government of India withdrew their  connection from it, and ceased to pay the men. Major Grant left  Manipur, and Captain Gordon, who had been adjutant since 1827, was  made Political Agent of Manipur. Captain Pemberton had long since  been on special survey duty.    Captain Gordon died in December 1844. He was much liked and long  remembered by the people whom he had greatly benefited, among other  ways by introducing English vegetables, and fruits. He was succeeded  by Lieutenant (afterwards Colonel) McCulloch.    Rajah Nur Singh died in 1850, and was succeeded by his brother  Debindro, a weak man, quite unfit for the position. In 1850, young  Chandra Kirtee Singh invaded the valley with a body of followers,  Debindro fled, and he mounted the throne without opposition. Up to  this time the Government of India had always acknowledged the de facto  Rajah of Manipur, and revolutions with much accompanying bloodshed  were common. Now, however, McCulloch strongly urged the advisability  of supporting Chandra Kirtee Singh, and he received authority to  \"make a public avowal of the determination of the British Government  to uphold the present Rajah and to resist and punish any parties  attempting hereafter to dispossess him.\" The Court of Directors of  the East India Company, in a despatch dated May 5th, 1852, confirmed  the order of the Government of India and commented thus: \"The position  you have assumed of pledged protector of the Rajah, imposes on you as  a necessary consequence the obligation of attempting to guide him,  by your advice, but if needful of protecting his subjects against  oppression on his part; otherwise our guarantee of his rule may be  the cause of inflicting on them a continuance of reckless tyranny.\"    These words of justice and wisdom were steadily ignored by successive  governments. On no occasion did the Government of India ever seriously  remonstrate with the Rajah, or make a sustained effort to improve  his system of administration. The East India Company's order became  a dead letter, but the resolution to uphold Chandra Kirtee Singh  bore good fruit, and during his long reign of thirty-five years no  successful attempt against his authority was ever made, and he on  his part displayed unswerving fidelity to the British Government.    I have already mentioned the great work that Colonel McCulloch  accomplished with regard to the Kukis. This added to his long  experience, gave him great influence in the State, and when he  retired from the service in 1861, it was amidst the regrets of the  whole people. Able, high-minded, respected, and having accomplished  a task few could even have attempted, he left without honour or  reward from his Government. How many men of inferior capacity,  and quite without his old-fashioned single-minded devotion to duty,  are nowadays covered with stars! When he left he made every effort  to hand over his vast power and influence intact to his successor,  and to smooth his way as much as possible. Had the Government of  India exercised the slightest tact and discretion in the selection of  its agent, he might have carried on the good work so ably commenced,  and brought Manipur by rapid strides into the path of progress. As it  was it would have been difficult to find an officer more unfitted to  succeed Colonel McCulloch than the one selected; he was soon involved  in difficulties, and after a troubled period was ordered by Government  to leave at three days' notice. For a time the agency remained vacant,  but the Rajah applied for another officer, and Colonel McCulloch was  requested by the Government to quit his retirement, and again assume  charge. He did so, and was received with acclamations by Rajah and  people, the whole State turning out to meet him. His first effort was  to restore the confidence forfeited by the late political agent, and  everything went on as smoothly as ever; but, towards the end of 1867,  he finally retired, staying on a few days after his successor's arrival  to post him up in his work. This time it would have been thought that  some judgment would be shown in the selection of an officer for the  post; but the next political agent was eminently unfitted and for  some years before his death in 1876, was on very indifferent terms  with the Durbar.    During the brief period that elapsed between the last event and my  taking charge, two different officers held the post.    My Government establishment consisted of a head clerk, a most excellent  man, Baboo Rusni Lall Coondoo; a native doctor, Lachman Parshad;  native secretary and Manipuri interpreter; Burmese interpreter;  Naga interpreter; Kuki interpreter; and latterly six chuprassies,  i.e., orderlies or lictors. As for private servants we had three Naga  girls, a Mugh cook and assistant, who could turn out a dinner equal to  any of the London clubs for one hundred people at a couple of days'  notice, and under him I had four young Nagas learning their work,  as I was determined to do more for my successors than my predecessors  had done for me, viz., teach and train up a staff of servants so as  to save the necessity of importing the scum of Calcutta. I had an  excellent bearer, Horna, as I have already stated, and under him were  two or three Nagas; washermen, syces, gardeners, water-carriers,  etc., made up the number. All my interpreters, chuprassies, and  servants, I clothed in scarlet livery which made a great impression,  and gradually the air of squalor which prevailed when I arrived began  to disappear. I had charge of a Government Treasury from which I used  to pay myself and the Government establishment. The currency of the  country was "]]]
