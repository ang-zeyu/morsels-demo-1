SURA LXX.-THE STEPS OR ASCENTS [XLVII.]    MECCA.-44 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    A SUITOR sued1 for punishment to light suddenly    On the infidels: none can hinder    God from inflicting it, the master of those ASCENTS,    By which the angels and the spirit ascend to him in a day, whose length is  fifty thousand years.2    Be thou patient therefore with becoming patience;    They forsooth regard that day as distant,    But we see it nigh:    The day when the heavens shall become as molten brass,    And the mountains shall become like flocks of wool:    And friend shall not question of friend,    Though they look at one another. Fain would the wicked redeem himself from  punishment on that day at the price of his children,    Of his spouse and his brother,    And of his kindred who shewed affection for him,    And of all who are on the earth that then it might deliver him.    But no. For the fire,    Dragging by the scalp,    Shall claim him who turned his back and went away,    And amassed and hoarded.    Man truly is by creation hasty;    When evil befalleth him, impatient;    But when good falleth to his lot, tenacious.    Not so the prayerful,    Who are ever constant at their prayers;    And of whose substance there is a due and stated portion    For him who asketh, and for him who is ashamed3 to beg;    And who own the judgment-day a truth,    And who thrill with dread at the chastisement of their Lord-    For there is none safe from the chastisement of their Lord-    And who control their desires,    (Save with their wives or the slaves whom their right hands have won, for  there they shall be blameless;    But whoever indulge their desires beyond this are transgressors);    And who are true to their trusts and their engagements,    And who witness uprightly,    And who keep strictly the hours of prayer:    These shall dwell, laden with honours, amid gardens.    But what hath come to the unbelievers that they run at full stretch around  thee,    On the right hand and on the left, in bands?    Is it that every man of them would fain enter that garden of delights?    Not at all. We have created them, they know of what.    It needs not that I swear by the Lord of the East and of the West4 that we  have power.    To replace them with better than themselves: neither are we to be hindered.    Wherefore let them flounder on and disport them, till they come face to face  with their threatened day,    The day on which they shall flock up out of their graves in haste like men  who rally to a standard:-    Their eyes downcast; disgrace shall cover them. Such their threatened day.      _______________________    1 Lit. asking one asked; probably some unbeliever, with reference to the  opening of Sura lvi., p. 60, or like statements in some previous Sura.    2 The expression is hyperbolical, and, as such, identical with Sura [lxx.]  xxxii. 4.

Suras ii. 23 and iv. 60. While in Suras xxxvi. 56;  xliii. 70; xiii. 23; xl. 8 the proper wives of the faithful are spoken of as  accompanying their husbands into the gardens of bliss.

And they have treated the prophets as impostors, and follow their own lusts;  but everything is unalterably fixed.    A message of prohibition had come to them-    Consummate wisdom-but warners profit them not.    Quit them then.

And we bare him on a vessel made with planks and nails.    Under our eyes it floated on: a recompence to him who had been rejected with  unbelief.    And we left it a sign: but, is there any one who receives the warning?    And how great was my vengeance and my menace!    Easy for warning have we made the Koran-but, is there any one who receives  the warning?    The Adites called the truth a lie: but how great was my vengeance and my  menace;    For we sent against them a roaring wind in a day of continued distress:    It tore men away as though they were uprooted palm stumps.    And how great was my vengeance and my menace!    Easy for warning have we made the Koran-but, is there any one who receives  the warning?    The tribe of Themoud treated the threatenings as lies:    And they said, \"Shall we follow a single man from among ourselves? Then  verily should we be in error and in folly.

Truly the  human eye is nothing more than a window, of no use unless the man looks  out of it.    Some of the experiences of that period seem ludicrous enough in the  retrospect. Only two or three days after my eyes were first opened I was  out with a friend in search of wild-flowers (I was piloting him to a  favorite station for _Viola pubescens_), when I saw a most elegant  little creature, mainly black and white, but with brilliant orange  markings. He was darting hither and thither among the branches of some  low trees, while I stared at him in amazement, calling on my comrade,  who was as ignorant as myself, but less excited, to behold the prodigy.  Half trembling lest the bird should prove to be some straggler from the  tropics, the like of which would not be found in the cabinet before  mentioned, I went thither that very evening. Alas, my silly fears! there  stood the little beauty's exact counterpart, labeled _Setophaga  ruticilla_, the American redstart,--a bird which the manual assured me  was very common in my neighborhood.    But it was not my eyes only that were opened, my ears also were touched.  It was as if all the birds had heretofore been silent, and now, under  some sudden impulse, had broken out in universal concert. What a  glorious chorus it was; and every voice a stranger! For a week or more I  was puzzled by a song which I heard without fail whenever I went into  the woods, but the author of which I could never set eyes on,--a song so  exceptionally loud and shrill, and marked by such a vehement crescendo,  that, even to my new-found ears, it stood out from the general medley a  thing by itself. Many times I struck into the woods in the direction  whence it came, but without getting so much as a flying glimpse of the  musician. Very mysterious, surely! Finally, by accident I believe, I  caught the fellow in the very act of singing, as he stood on a dead  pine-limb; and a few minutes later he was on the ground, walking about  (not hopping) with the primmest possible gait,--a small olive-brown  bird, with an orange crown and a speckled breast. Then I knew him for  the golden-crowned thrush; but it was not for some time after this that  I heard his famous evening song, and it was longer still before I found  his curious roofed nest.    \"Happy those early days,\" those days of childish innocence,--though I  was a man grown,--when every bird seemed newly created, and even the  redstart and the wood wagtail were like rarities from the ends of the  earth. Verily, my case was like unto Adam's, when every fowl of the air  was brought before him for a name.    One evening, on my way back to the city after an afternoon ramble, I  stopped just at dusk in a grove of hemlocks, and soon out of the  tree-top overhead came a song,--a brief strain of about six notes, in a  musical but rather rough voice, and in exquisite accord with the quiet  solemnity of the hour. Again and again the sounds fell on my ear, and as  often I endeavored to obtain a view of the singer; but he was in the  thick of the upper branches, and I looked for him in vain. How delicious  the music was! a perfect lullaby, drowsy and restful; like the  benediction of the wood on the spirit of a tired city-dweller. I blessed  the unknown songster in return; and even now I have a feeling that the  peculiar enjoyment which the song of the black-throated green warbler  never fails to afford me may perhaps be due in some measure to its  association with that twilight hour.    To this same hemlock grove I was in the habit, in those days, of going  now and then to listen to the evening hymn of the veery, or Wilson  thrush. Here, if nowhere else, might be heard music fit to be called  sacred. Nor did it seem a disadvantage, but rather the contrary, when,  as sometimes happened, I was compelled to take my seat in the edge of  the wood, and wait quietly, in the gathering darkness, for vespers to  begin. The veery's mood is not so lofty as the hermit's, nor is his  music to be compared for brilliancy and fullness with that of the wood  thrush; but, more than any other bird-song known to me, the veery's has,  if I may say so, the accent of sanctity. Nothing is here of  self-consciousness; nothing of earthly pride or passion. If we chance to  overhear it and laud the singer, that is our affair. Simple-hearted  worshiper that he is, he has never dreamed of winning praise for himself  by the excellent manner in which he praises his Creator,--an absence of  thrift, which is very becoming in thrushes, though, I suppose, it is  hardly to be looked for in human choirs.    And yet, for all the unstudied ease and simplicity of the veery's  strain, he is a great master of _technique_. In his own artless way he  does what I have never heard any other bird attempt: he gives to his  melody all the force of harmony. How this unique and curious effect,  this vocal double-stopping, as a violinist might term it, is produced,  is not certainly known; but it would seem that it must be by an  _arpeggio_, struck with such consummate quickness and precision that the  ear is unable to follow it, and is conscious of nothing but the  resultant chord. At any rate, the thing itself is indisputable, and has  often been commented on.    Moreover, this is only half the veery's technical proficiency. Once in a  while, at least, he will favor you with a delightful feat of  ventriloquism; beginning to sing in single voice, as usual, and anon,  without any noticeable increase in the loudness of the tones, diffusing  the music throughout the wood, as if there were a bird in every tree,  all singing together in the strictest time. I am not sure that all  members of the species possess this power, and I have never seen the  performance alluded to in print; but I have heard it when the illusion  was complete, and the effect most beautiful.    Music so devout and unostentatious as the veery's does not appeal to the  hurried or the preoccupied. If you would enjoy it you must bring an ear  to hear. I have sometimes pleased myself with imagining a resemblance  between it and the poetry of George Herbert,--both uncared for by the  world, but both, on that very account, prized all the more dearly by the  few in every generation whose spirits are in tune with theirs.    This bird is one of a group of small thrushes called the _Hylocichlae_,  of which group we have five representatives in the Atlantic States: the  wood thrush; the Wilson, or tawny thrush; the hermit; the olive-backed,  or Swainson; and the gray-cheeked, or Alice's thrush. To the unpracticed  eye the five all look alike. All of them, too, have the same glorious  voice, so that the young student is pretty sure to find it a matter of  some difficulty to tell them apart. Yet there are differences of  coloration which may be trusted as constant, and to which, after a  while, the eye becomes habituated; and, at the same time, each species  has a song and call-notes peculiar to itself. One cannot help wishing,  indeed, that he might hear the five singing by turns in the same wood.  Then he could fix the distinguishing peculiarities of the different  songs in his mind so as never to confuse them again. But this is more  than can be hoped for; the listener must be content with hearing two,  or at the most three, of the species singing together, and trust his  memory to make the necessary comparison.    The song of the wood thrush is perhaps the most easily set apart from  the rest, because of its greater compass of voice and bravery of  execution. The Wilson's song, as you hear it by itself, seems so  perfectly characteristic that you fancy you can never mistake any other  for it; and yet, if you are in northern New England only a week  afterwards, you may possibly hear a Swainson (especially if he happens  to be one of the best singers of his species, and, more especially  still, if he happens to be at just the right distance away), who you  will say, at first thought, is surely a Wilson. The difficulty of  distinguishing the voices is naturally greatest in the spring, when they  have not been heard for eight or nine months. Here, as elsewhere, the  student must be willing to learn the same lesson over and over, letting  patience have her perfect work. That the five songs are really  distinguishable is well illustrated by the fact (which I have before  mentioned), that the presence of the Alice thrush in New England during  the breeding season was announced as probable by myself, simply on the  strength of a song which I had heard in the White Mountains, and which,  as I believed, must be his, notwithstanding I was entirely unacquainted  with it, and though all our books affirmed that the Alice thrush was not  a summer resident of any part of the United States.    It is worth remarking, also, in this connection, that the _Hylocichlae_  differ more decidedly in their notes of alarm than in their songs. The  wood thrush's call is extremely sharp and brusque, and is usually fired  off in a little volley; that of the Wilson is a sort of whine, or snarl,  in distressing contrast with his song; the hermit's is a quick, _sotto  voce_, sometimes almost inaudible _chuck_; the Swainson's is a mellow  whistle; while that of the Alice is something between the Swainson's and  the Wilson's,--not so gentle and refined as the former, nor so  outrageously vulgar as the latter.    In what is here said about discriminating species it must be understood  that I am not speaking of such identification as will answer a strictly  scientific purpose. For that the bird must be shot. To the maiden                      \"whose light blue eyes      Are tender over drowning flies,\"    this decree will no doubt sound cruel. Men who pass laws of that sort  may call themselves ornithologists, if they will; for her part she calls  them butchers. We"]]]
