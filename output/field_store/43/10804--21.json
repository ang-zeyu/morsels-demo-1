[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2898"],[0,"Pioneers of the Old South: A Chronicle of English Colonial Beginnings (#17)"],[1," civil war there arose on the part of some in England a  project to revive and restore the old Virginia Company by procuring from  Charles, now deep in troubles of his own, a renewal of the old letters  patent and the transference of the direct government of the colony into  the hands of a reorganized and vast corporation. Virginia, which a score  of years before had defended the Company, now protested vigorously, and,  with regard to the long view of things, it may be thought wisely. The  project died a natural death. The petition sent from Virginia shows  plainly enough the pen of Berkeley. There are a multitude of reasons  why Virginia should not pass from King to Company, among which these  are worthy of note: \"We may not admit of so unnatural a distance as a  Company will interpose between his sacred majesty and us his subjects  from whose immediate protection we have received so many royal favours  and gracious blessings. For, by such admissions, we shall degenerate  from the condition of our birth, being naturalized under a monarchical  government and not a popular and tumultuary government depending  upon the greatest number of votes of persons of several humours and  dispositions.\"    When this paper reached England, it came to a country at civil war. The  Long Parliament was in session. Stafford had been beheaded, the Star  Chamber swept away, the Grand Remonstrance presented. On Edgehill  bloomed flowers that would soon be trampled by Rupert's cavalry. In  Virginia the Assembly took notice of these \"unkind differences now  in England,\" and provided by tithing for the Governor's pension and  allowance, which were for the present suspended and endangered by the  troubles at home. That the forces banded against the Lord's anointed  would prove victorious must at this time have appeared preposterously  unlikely to the fiery Governor and the ultra-loyal Virginia whom he led.  The Puritans and Independents in Virginia--estimated a little earlier  at \"a thousand strong\" and now, for all the acts against them, probably  stronger yet--were to be found chiefly in the parishes of Isle of Wight  and Nansemond, but had representatives from the Falls to the Eastern  Shore. What these Virginians thought of the \"unkind differences\" does  not appear in the record, but probably there was thought enough and  secret hopes.    In 1644, the year of Marston Moor, Virginia, too, saw battle and sudden  and bloody death. That Opechancanough who had succeeded Powhatan was  now one hundred years old, hardly able to walk or to see, dwelling  harmlessly in a village upon the upper Pamunkey. All the Indians were  broken and dispersed; serious danger was not to be thought of. Then,  of a sudden, the flame leaped again. There fell from the blue sky a  massacre directed against the outlying plantations. Three hundred men,  women, and children were killed by the Indians. With fury the white men  attacked in return. They sent bodies of horse into the untouched western  forests. They chased and slew without mercy. In 1646 Opechancanough,  brought a prisoner to Jamestown, ended his long tale of years by a shot  from one of his keepers. The Indians were beaten, and, lacking such  another leader, made no more organized and general attacks. But for long  years a kind of border warfare still went on.    Even Maryland, tolerant and just as was the Calvert policy, did not  altogether escape Indian troubles. She had to contend with no such able  chief as Opechancanough, and she suffered no sweeping massacres. But  after the first idyllic year or so there set in a small, constant  friction. So fast did the Maryland colonists arrive that soon there was  pressure of population beyond those first purchased bounds. The more  thoughtful among the Indians may well have taken alarm lest their  villages and hunting-grounds might not endure these inroads. Ere long  the English in Maryland were placing \"centinells\" over fields where men  worked, and providing penalties for those who sold the savages firearms.  But at no time did young Maryland suffer the Indian woes that had vexed  young Virginia.    Nor did Maryland escape the clash of interests which beset the  beginnings of representative assemblies in all proprietary provinces.  The second, like the first, Lord Baltimore, was a believer in kings and  aristocracies, in a natural division of human society into masters and  men. His effort was to plant intact in Maryland a feudal order. He would  be Palatine, the King his suzerain. In Maryland the great planters, in  effect his barons, should live upon estates, manorial in size and with  manorial rights. The laboring men--the impecunious adventurers whom  these greater adventurers brought out--would form a tenantry, the  Lord Proprietary's men's men. It is true that, according to charter,  provision was made for an Assembly. Here were to sit \"freemen of the  province,\" that is to say, all white males who were not in the position  of indentured servants. But with the Proprietary, and not with the  Assembly, would rest primarily the lawmaking power. The Lord Proprietary  would propose legislation, and the freemen of the country would debate,  in a measure advise, represent, act as consultants, and finally confirm.  Baltimore was prepared to be a benevolent lord, wise, fatherly.    In 1635 met the first Assembly, Leonard Calvert and his Council  sitting with the burgesses, and this gathering of freemen proceeded to  inaugurate legislation. There was passed a string of enactments which  presumably dealt with immediate wants at St. Mary's, and which, the  Assembly recognized, must have the Lord Proprietary's assent. A copy was  therefore sent by the first ship to leave. So long were the voyages and  so slow the procedure in England that it was 1637 before Baltimore's  veto upon the Assembly's laws reached Maryland. It would seem that  he did not disapprove so much of the laws themselves as of the bold  initiative of the Assembly, for he at once sent over twelve bills of  his own drafting. Leonard Calvert was instructed to bring all freemen  together in Assembly and present for their acceptance the substituted  legislation.    Early in 1638 this Maryland Assembly met. The Governor put before it for  adoption the Proprietary's laws. The vote was taken. Governor and some  others were for, the remainder of the Assembly unanimously against, the  proposed legislation. There followed a year or two of struggle over this  question, but in the end the Proprietary in effect acknowledged defeat.  The colonists, through their Assembly, might thereafter propose laws  to meet their exigencies, and Governor Calvert, acting for his brother,  should approve or veto according to need.    When civil war between King and Parliament broke out in England,  sentiment in Maryland as in Virginia inclined toward the King. But  that Puritan, Non-conformist, and republican element that was in  both colonies might be expected to gain if, at home in England, the  Parliamentary party gained. A Royal Governor or a Lord Proprietary's  Governor might alike be perplexed by the political turmoil in the mother  country. Leonard Calvert felt the need of first-hand consultation with  his brother. Leaving Giles Brent in his place, he sailed for England,  talked there with Baltimore himself, perplexed and filled with  foreboding, and returned to Maryland not greatly wiser than when he  went.    Maryland was soon convulsed by disorders which in many ways reflected  the unsettled conditions in England. A London ship, commanded by Richard  Ingle, a Puritan and a staunch upholder of the cause of Parliament,  arrived before St. Mary's, where he gave great offense by his blatant  remarks about the King and Rupert, \"that Prince Rogue.\" Though he was  promptly arrested on the charge of treason, he managed to escape and  soon left the loyal colony far astern.    In the meantime Leonard Calvert had come back to Maryland, where he  found confusion and a growing heat and faction and side-taking of a  bitter sort. To add to the turmoil, William Claiborne, among whose  dominant traits was an inability to recognize defeat, was making  attempts upon Kent Island. Calvert was not long at St. Mary's ere Ingle  sailed in again with letters-of-marque from the Long Parliament. Ingle  and his men landed and quickly found out the Protestant moiety of  the colonists. There followed an actual insurrection, the Marylanders  joining with Ingle and much aided by Claiborne, who now retook Kent  Island. The insurgents then captured St. Mary's and forced the  Governor to flee to Virginia. For two years Ingle ruled and plundered,  sequestrating goods of the Proprietary's adherents, and deporting in  irons Jesuit priests. At the end of this time Calvert reappeared, and  behind him a troop gathered in Virginia. Now it was Ingle's turn to  flee. Regaining his ship, he made sail for England, and Maryland settled  down again to the ancient order. The Governor then reduced Kent Island.  Claiborne, again defeated, retired to Virginia, whence he sailed for  England.    In 1647 Leonard Calvert died. Until the Proprietary's will should be  known, Thomas Greene acted as Governor. Over in England, Lord Baltimore  stood at the parting of the ways. The King's cause had a hopeless look.  Roundhead and Parliament were making way in a mighty tide. Baltimore was  marked for a royalist and a Catholic. If the tide rose farther, he might  lose Maryland. A sagacious mind, he proceeded to do all that he could,  short of denying his every belief, to placate his enemies. He appointed  as Governor of Maryland William Stone, a Puritan, and into the Council,  numbering five members, he put three Puritans. On the other hand the  interests of his Maryland Catholics must not be endangered. He required  of the new Governor not to molest any person \"professing to believe  in Jesus Christ, and in particular any Roman Catholic.\" In this way he  thought that, right "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2900"],[0,"The Age of Invention: A Chronicle of Mechanical Conquest (#17)"],[1,"the pluck and persistence to remain steadfast to his great design,  through twelve long years of toil and privation, until his countrymen  accepted his work and found it well done.    Morse was happy in his birth and early training. He was born in 1791, at  Charlestown, Massachusetts. His father was a Congregational minister and  a scholar of high standing, who, by careful management, was able to send  his three sons to Yale College. Thither went young Samuel (or Finley, as  he was called by his family) at the age of fourteen and came under the  influence of Benjamin Silliman, Professor of Chemistry, and of Jeremiah  Day, Professor of Natural Philosophy, afterwards President of Yale  College, whose teaching gave him impulses which in later years led  to the invention of the telegraph. \"Mr. Day's lectures are very  interesting,\" the young student wrote home in 1809; \"they are upon  electricity; he has given us some very fine experiments, the whole  class taking hold of hands form the circuit of communication and we all  receive the shock apparently at the same moment.\" Electricity, however,  was only an alluring study. It afforded no means of livelihood, and  Morse had gifts as an artist; in fact, he earned a part of his college  expenses painting miniatures at five dollars apiece. He decided,  therefore, that art should be his vocation.    A letter written years afterwards by Joseph M. Dulles of Philadelphia,  who was at New Haven preparing for Yale when Morse was in his senior  year, is worth reading here:    \"I first became acquainted with him at New Haven, when about to graduate  with the class of 1810, and had such an association as a boy preparing  for college might have with a senior who was just finishing his course.  Having come to New Haven under the care of Rev. Jedidiah Morse, the  venerable father of the three Morses, all distinguished men, I  was commended to the protection of Finley, as he was then commonly  designated, and therefore saw him frequently during the brief period we  were together. The father I regard as the gravest man I ever knew. He  was a fine exemplar of the gentler type of the Puritan, courteous in  manner, but stern in conduct and in aspect. He was a man of conflict,  and a leader in the theological contests in New England in the early  part of this century. Finley, on the contrary, bore the expression of  gentleness entirely. In person rather above the ordinary height, well  formed, graceful in demeanor, with a complexion, if I remember right,  slightly ruddy, features duly proportioned, and often lightened with a  genial and expressive smile. He was, altogether, a handsome young  man, with manners unusually bland. It is needless to add that with  intelligence, high culture, and general information, and with a strong  bent to the fine arts, Mr. Morse was in 1810 an attractive young man.  During the last year of his college life he occupied his leisure  hours, with a view to his self-support, in taking the likenesses of  his fellow-students on ivory, and no doubt with success, as he obtained  afterward a very respectable rank as a portrait-painter. Many pieces of  his skill were afterward executed in Charleston, South Carolina.\"*         * Prime, \"The Life of Samuel F. B. Morse, LL.D.\", p. 26.      That Morse was destined to be a painter seemed certain, and when, soon  after graduating from Yale, he made the acquaintance of Washington  Allston, an American artist of high standing, any doubts that may have  existed in his mind as to his vocation were set at rest. Allston was  then living in Boston, but was planning to return to England, where  his name was well known, and it was arranged that young Morse should  accompany him as his pupil. So in 1811 Morse went to England with  Allston and returned to America four years later an accredited portrait  painter, having studied not only under Allston but under the famous  master, Benjamin West, and having met on intimate terms some of the  great Englishmen of the time. He opened a studio in Boston, but as  sitters were few, he made a trip through New England, taking commissions  for portraits, and also visited Charleston, South Carolina, where some  of his paintings may be seen today.    At Concord, New Hampshire, Morse met Miss Lucretia Walker, a beautiful  and cultivated young woman, and they were married in 1818. Morse then  settled in New York. His reputation as a painter increased steadily,  though he gained little money, and in 1825 he was in Washington painting  a portrait of the Marquis La Fayette, for the city of New York, when he  heard from his father the bitter news of his wife's death in New Haven,  then a journey of seven days from Washington. Leaving the portrait of La  Fayette unfinished, the heartbroken artist made his way home.    Two years afterwards Morse was again obsessed with the marvels of  electricity, as he had been in college. The occasion this time was a  series of lectures on that subject given by James Freeman Dana before  the New York Athenaeum in the chapel of Columbia College. Morse attended  these lectures and formed with Dana an intimate acquaintance. Dana was  in the habit of going to Morse's studio, where the two men would talk  earnestly for long hours. But Morse was still devoted to his art;  besides, he had himself and three children to support, and painting was  his only source of income.    Back to Europe went Morse in 1829 to pursue his profession and perfect  himself in it by three years' further study. Then came the crisis.  Homeward bound on the ship Sully in the autumn of 1832, Morse fell into  conversation with some scientific men who were on board. One of the  passengers asked this question: \"Is the velocity of electricity reduced  by the length of its conducting wire?\" To which his neighbor replied  that electricity passes instantly over any known length of wire and  referred to Franklin's experiments with several miles of wire, in which  no appreciable time elapsed between a touch at one end and a spark at  the other.    Here was a fact already well known. Morse must have known it himself.  But the tremendous significance of that fact had never before occurred  to him nor, so far as he knew, to any man. A recording telegraph! Why  not? Intelligence delivered at one end of a wire instantly recorded at  the other end, no matter how long the wire! It might reach across the  continent or even round the earth. The idea set his mind on fire.    Home again in November, 1832, Morse found himself on the horns of a  dilemma. To give up his profession meant that he would have no income;  on the other hand, how could he continue wholeheartedly painting  pictures while consumed with the idea of the telegraph? The idea would  not down; yet he must live; and there were his three motherless children  in New Haven. He would have to go on painting as well as he could and  develop his telegraph in what time he could spare. His brothers, Richard  and Sidney, were both living in New York and they did what they could  for him, giving him a room in a building they had erected at Nassau and  Beekman Streets. Morse's lot at this time was made all the harder by  hopes raised and dashed to earth again. Congress had voted money for  mural paintings for the rotunda of the Capitol. The artists were to be  selected by a committee of which John Quincy Adams was chairman. Morse  expected a commission for a part of the work, for his standing at that  time was second to that of no American artist, save Allston, and Allston  he knew had declined to paint any of the pictures and had spoken in his  favor. Adams, however, as chairman of the committee was of the opinion  that the pictures should be done by foreign artists, there being no  Americans available, he thought, of sufficiently high standing to  execute the work with fitting distinction. This opinion, publicly  expressed, infuriated James Fenimore Cooper, Morse's friend, and Cooper  wrote an attack on Adams in the New York Evening Post, but without  signing it. Supposing Morse to be the author of this article, Adams  summarily struck his name from the list of artists who were to be  employed.    How very poor Morse was about this time is indicated by a story  afterwards told by General Strother of Virginia, who was one of his  pupils:    I engaged to become Morse's pupil and subsequently went to New York  and found him in a room in University Place. He had three or four other  pupils and I soon found that our professor had very little patronage.    I paid my fifty dollars for one-quarter's instruction. Morse was a  faithful teacher and took as much interest in our progress as--more  indeed than--we did ourselves. But he was very poor. I remember that,  when my second quarter's pay was due, my remittance did not come as  expected, and one day the professor came in and said, courteously: \"Well  Strother, my boy, how are we off for money?\"    \"Why professor,\" I answered, \"I am sorry to say that I have been  disappointed, but I expect a remittance next week.\"    \"Next week,\" he repeated sadly, \"I shall be dead by that time.\"    \"Dead, sir?\"    \"Yes, dead by starvation.\"    I was distressed and astonished. I said hurriedly:    \"Would ten dollars be of any service?\"    \"Ten dollars would save my life. That is all it would do.\"    I paid the money, all that I had, and we dined together. It was a modest  meal, but good, and after he had finished, he said:    \"This is my first meal for twenty-four hours. Strother, don't be an  artist. It means beggary. Your life depends upon people who know nothing  of your art and care nothing for you. A house dog lives better, and the  very sensitiveness that stimulates an artist to work keeps him alive to  suffering.\"*         * Prime, p. 424.      In 1835 Morse received an appointment to the teaching staff of New York  University and moved his workshop to a room in the University building  in Washington Square. \"There,\" says his"]]]
