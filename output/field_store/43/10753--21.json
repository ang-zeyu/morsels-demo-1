The report of Ibn Abd Alkohm, as to what was to be found in each of  these three pyramids, or rather of what, according to him, was put into  them originally by King Saurid, runs as follows: 'In the Western  pyramid, thirty treasuries filled with store of riches and utensils, and  with signatures made of precious stones, and with instruments of iron  and vessels of earth, and with arms which rust not, and with glass which  might be bended and yet not broken, and with strange spells, and with  several kinds of _alakakirs_ (magical precious stones) single and  double, and with deadly poisons, and with other things besides. He made  also in the East' (the Great Pyramid) 'divers celestial spheres and  stars, and what they severally operate in their aspects, and the  perfumes which are to be used to them, and the books which treat of  these matters. He put also into the coloured pyramid the commentaries of  the priests in chests of black marble, and with every priest a book, in  which the wonders of his profession and of his actions and of his nature  were written, and what was done in his time, and what is and what shall  be from the beginning of time to the end of it.' The rest of this  worthy's report relates to certain treasurers placed within these three  pyramids to guard their contents, and (like all or most of what I have  already quoted) was a work of imagination. Ibn Abd Alkohm, in fact, was  a romancist of the first water.    Perhaps the strongest argument against the theory that the pyramids were  intended as strongholds for the concealment of treasure, resides in the  fact that, search being made, no treasure has been discovered. When the  workmen employed by Caliph Al Mamoun, after encountering manifold  difficulties, at length broke their way into the great ascending passage  leading to the so-called King's Chamber, they found 'a right noble  apartment, thirty-four feet long, seventeen broad, and nineteen high, of  polished red granite throughout, walls, floor, and ceiling, in blocks  squared and true, and put together with such exquisite skill that the  joints are barely discernible to the closest inspection. But where is  the treasure--the silver and the gold, the jewels, medicines, and  arms?--These fanatics look wildly around them, but can see nothing, not  a single _dirhem_ anywhere. They trim their torches, and carry them  again and again to every part of that red-walled, flinty hall, but  without any better success. Nought but pure polished red granite, in  mighty slabs, looks upon them from every side. The room is clean,  garnished too, as it were, and, according to the ideas of its founders,  complete and perfectly ready for its visitors so long expected, so long  delayed. But the gross minds who occupy it now, find it all barren, and  declare that there is nothing whatever for them in the whole extent of  the apartment from one end to another; nothing except an empty stone  chest without a lid.'    It is, however, to be noted that we have no means of learning what had  happened between the time when the pyramid was built and when Caliph Al  Mamoun's workmen broke their way into the King's Chamber. The place  may, after all, have contained treasures of some kind; nor, indeed, is  it incompatible with other theories of the pyramid to suppose that it  was used as a safe receptacle for treasures. It is certain, however,  that this cannot have been the special purpose for which the pyramids  were designed. We should find in such a purpose no explanation whatever  of any of the most stringent difficulties encountered in dealing with  other theories. There could be no reason why strangers from the East  should be at special pains to instruct an Egyptian monarch how to hide  and guard his treasures. Nor, if the Great Pyramid had been intended to  receive the treasures of Cheops, would Chephren have built another for  his own treasures, which must have included those gathered by Cheops.  But, apart from this, how inconceivably vast must a treasure-hoard be  supposed to be, the safe guarding of which would have repaid the  enormous cost of the great Pyramid in labour and material! And then, why  should a mere treasure-house have the characteristics of an astronomical  observatory? Manifestly, if the pyramids were used at all to receive  treasures, it can only have been as an entirely subordinate though  perhaps convenient means of utilising these gigantic structures.    Having thus gone through all the suggested purposes of the pyramids save  two or three which clearly do not possess any claim to serious  consideration, and having found none which appear to give any sufficient  account of the history and principal features of these buildings, we  must either abandon the inquiry or seek for some explanation quite  different from any yet suggested. Let us consider what are the principal  points of which the true theory of the pyramids should give an account.    In the first place, the history of the pyramids shows that the erection  of the first great pyramid was in all probability either suggested to  Cheops by wise men who visited Egypt from the East, or else some  important information conveyed to him by such visitors caused him to  conceive the idea of building the pyramid. In either case we may  suppose, as the history indeed suggests, that these learned men, whoever  they may have been, remained in Egypt to superintend the erection of the  structure. It may be that the architectural work was not under their  supervision; in fact, it seems altogether unlikely that shepherd-rulers  would have much to teach the Egyptians in the matter of architecture.  But the astronomical peculiarities which form so significant a feature  of the Great Pyramid were probably provided for entirely under the  instructions of the shepherd chiefs who had exerted so strange an  influence upon the mind of King Cheops.    Next, it seems clear that self-interest must have been the predominant  reason in the mind of the Egyptian king for undertaking this stupendous  work. It is true that his change of religion implies that some higher  cause influenced him. But a ruler who could inflict such grievous  burdens on his people in carrying out his purpose that for ages  afterwards his name was held in utter detestation, cannot have been  solely or even chiefly influenced by religious motives. It affords an  ample explanation of the behaviour of Cheops, in closing the temples and  forsaking the religion of his country, to suppose that the advantages  which he hoped to secure by building the pyramid depended in some way on  his adopting this course. The visitors from the East may have refused to  give their assistance on any other terms, or may have assured him that  the expected benefit could not be obtained if the pyramid were erected  by idolaters. It is certain, in any case, that they were opposed to  idolatry; and we have thus some means of inferring who they were and  whence they came. We know that one particular branch of one particular  race in the East was characterised by a most marked hatred of idolatry  in all its forms. Terah and his family, or, probably, a sect or division  of the Chaldaean people, went forth from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into  the land of Canaan--and the reason why they went forth we learn from a  book of considerable historical interest (the book of Judith) to have  been because 'they would not worship the gods of their fathers who were  in the land of the Chaldaeans.' The Bible record shows that members of  this branch of the Chaldaean people visited Egypt from time to time. They  were shepherds, too, which accords well with the account of Herodotus  above quoted. We can well understand that persons of this family would  have resisted all endeavours to secure their acquiescence in any scheme  associated with idolatrous rites. Neither promises nor threats would  have had much influence on them. It was a distinguished member of the  family, the patriarch Abraham, who said: 'I have lift up mine hand unto  the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, that I  will not take from a thread even to a shoe-latchet, and that I will not  take anything that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram  rich.' Vain would all the promises and all the threats of Cheops have  been to men of this spirit. Such men might help him in his plans,  suggested, as the history shows, by teachings of their own, but it must  be on their own conditions, and those conditions would most certainly  include the utter rejection of idolatrous worship by the king in whose  behalf they worked, as well as by all who shared in their labours. It  seems probable that they convinced both Cheops and Chephren, that unless  these kings gave up idolatry, the purpose, whatever it was, which the  pyramid was erected to promote, would not be fulfilled. The mere fact  that the Great Pyramid was built either directly at the suggestion of  these visitors, or because they had persuaded Cheops of the truth of  some important doctrine, shows that they must have gained great  influence over his mind. Rather we may say that he must have been so  convinced of their knowledge and power as to have accepted with  unquestioning confidence all that they told him respecting the  particular subject over which they seemed to possess so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26598"],[0,"Seasoning of Wood (#17)"],[1,"woodenware, boxes shelving, drawers,  etc., etc. Also in the manufacture of toys, culinary woodenware, and  backing for veneer. It is in great demand throughout the vehicle and  implement trade, and also makes a fair grade of wood pulp. In fact the  tulip tree is one of the most useful of woods throughout the  woodworking industry of this country. Occurs from New England to  Missouri and southward to Florida.                                 TUPELO (See Gum)                                      WAAHOO    =105. Waahoo= (_Evonymus atropurpureus_). (Burning Bush, Spindle Tree).  A small-sized tree. Wood white, tinged with orange; heavy, hard,  tough, and close-grained, works well and stands well. Used principally  for arrows and spindles. Widely distributed. Usually a shrub six to  ten feet high, becoming a tree only in southern Arkansas and Oklahoma.                                      WALNUT    =106. Black Walnut= (_Juglans nigra_) (Walnut). A large, beautiful, and  quickly-growing tree, about 60 feet and upwards in height. Wood heavy,  hard, strong, of coarse texture, very durable in contact with the  soil. The narrow sapwood whitish, the heartwood dark, rich, chocolate  brown, sometimes almost black; aged trees of fine quality bring fancy  prices. The wood shrinks moderately in seasoning, works well and  stands well, and takes a fine polish. It is quite handsome, and has  been for a long time the favorite wood for cabinet and furniture  making. It is used for gun-stocks, fixtures, interior decoration,  veneer, panelling, stair newells, and all classes of work demanding a  high priced grade of wood. Black walnut is a large tree with stout  trunk, of rapid growth, and was formerly quite abundant throughout  the Alleghany region. Occurs from New England to Texas, and from  Michigan to Florida. Not common.                           WHITE WALNUT (See Butternut)                     WHITE WOOD (See Tulip and also Basswood)                                   WHITE WILLOW    =107. White Willow= (_Salix alba_ var. _vitellina_) (Willow, Yellow  Willow, Blue Willow). The wood is very soft, light, flexible, and  fairly strong, is fairly durable in contact with the soil, works well  and stands well when seasoned. Medium-sized tree, characterized by a  short, thick trunk, and a large, rather irregular crown composed of  many branches. The size of the tree at maturity varies with the  locality. In the region where it occurs naturally, a height of 70 to  80 feet, and a diameter of three to four feet are often attained. When  planted in the Middle West, a height of from 50 to 60 feet, and a  diameter of one and one-half to two feet are all that may be expected.  When closely planted on moist soil, the tree forms a tall, slender  stem, well cleared branches. Is widely naturalized in the United  States. It is used in cooperage, for woodenware, for cricket and  baseball bats, for basket work, etc. Charcoal made from the wood is  used in the manufacture of gunpowder. It has been generally used for  fence posts on the Northwestern plains, because of scarcity of better  material. Well seasoned posts will last from four to seven years.  Widely distributed throughout the United States.    =108. Black Willow= (_Salix nigra_). Small-sized tree. Heartwood light  reddish brown, sapwood nearly white. Wood soft, light, not strong,  close-grained, and very flexible. Used in basket making, etc. Ranges  from New York to Rocky Mountains and southward to Mexico.    =109. Shining Willow= (_Salix lucida_). A small-sized tree. Wood in its  quality and uses similiar to the preceding. Ranges from Newfoundland  to Rocky Mountains and southward to Pennsylvania and Nebraska.    =110. Perch Willow= (_Salix amygdaloides_) (Almond-leaf Willow). Small  to medium-sized tree. Heartwood light brown, sapwood lighter color.  Wood light, soft, flexible, not strong, close-grained. Uses similiar  to the preceding.

A small-sized  tree. Common along the banks of streams, and ranges from Nova Scotia  to Manitoba, and south to Delaware; west to Indiana and northwestern  Missouri.    =114. Crack Willow= (_Salix fragilis_). A medium to large-sized tree.  Wood is very soft, light, very flexible and fairly strong, is fairly  durable in contact with the soil, works well and stands well. Used  principally for basket making, hoops, etc., and to produce charcoal  for gunpowder. Very common, and widely distributed in the United  States.    =115. Weeping Willow= (_Salix babylonica_). Medium- to large-sized tree.  Wood similiar to _Salix nigra_, but not so valuable. Mostly an  ornamental tree. Originally came from China. Widely planted in the  United States.                                    YELLOW WOOD    =116. Yellow Wood= (_Cladrastis lutea_) (Virgilia). A small to  medium-sized tree.

Found principally on the limestone cliffs of Kentucky,  Tennessee, and North Carolina.                                        SECTION IV                GRAIN, COLOR, ODOR, WEIGHT, AND FIGURE IN WOOD                             DIFFERENT GRAINS OF WOOD    The terms \"fine-grained,\" \"coarse-grained,\" \"straight-grained,\" and  \"cross-grained\" are frequently applied in the trade. In common usage,  wood is coarse-grained if its annual rings are wide; fine-grained if  they are narrow. In the finer wood industries a fine-grained wood is  capable of high polish, while a coarse-grained wood is not, so that in  this latter case the distinction depends chiefly on hardness, and in  the former on an accidental case of slow or rapid growth. Generally if  the direction of the wood fibres is parallel to the axis of the stem  or limb in which they occur, the wood is straight-grained; but in many  cases the course of the fibres is spiral or twisted around the tree  (as shown in Fig. 15), and sometimes commonly in the butts of gum and  cypress, the fibres of several layers are oblique in one direction,  and those of the next series of layers are oblique in the opposite  direction. (As shown in Fig. 16 the wood is cross or twisted grain.)  Wavy-grain in a tangential plane as seen on the radial section is  illustrated in Fig. 17, which represents an extreme case observed in  beech. This same form also occurs on the radial plane, causing the  tangential section to appear wavy or in transverse folds.    When wavy grain is fine (_i.e._, the folds or ridges small but  numerous) it gives rise to the \"curly\" structure frequently seen in  maple. Ordinarily, neither wavy, spiral, nor alternate grain is  visible on the cross-section; its existence often escapes the eye even  on smooth, longitudinal faces in the sawed material, so that the only  guide to their discovery lies in splitting the wood in two, in the two  normal plains.        [Illustration: Fig. 15. Spiral Grain. Season checks, after      removal of bark, indicate the direction of the fibres or      grain of the wood.]        [Illustration: Fig. 16. Alternating Spiral Grain in Cypress.      Side and end view of same piece. When the bark was at _o_,      the grain of this piece was straight. From that time, each      year it grew more oblique in one direction, reaching a climax      at _a_, and then turned back in the opposite direction. These      alternations were repeated periodically, the bark sharing in      these changes.]    Generally the surface of the wood under the bark, and therefore also  that of any layer in the interior, is not uniform and smooth, but is  channelled and pitted by numerous depressions, which differ greatly in  size and form. Usually, any one depression or elevation is restricted  to one or few annual layers (_i.e._, seen only in one or few rings)  and is then lost, being compensated (the surface at the particular  spot evened up) by growth. In some woods, however, any depression or  elevation once attained grows from year to year and reaches a maximum  size, which is maintained for many years, sometimes throughout life.  In maple, where this tendency to preserve any particular contour is  very great, the depressions and elevations are usually small  (commonly less than one-eighth inch) but very numerous.    On tangent boards of such wood, the sections, pits, and prominences  appear as circlets, and give rise to the beautiful \"bird's eye\" or  \"landscape\" structure. Similiar structures in the burls of black ash,  maple, etc., are frequently due to the presence of dormant buds, which  cause the surface of all the layers through which they pass to be  covered by small conical elevations, whose cross-sections on the sawed  board appear as irregular circlets or islets, each with a dark speck,  the section of the pith or \"trace\" of the dormant bud in the center.        [Illustration: Fig. 17. Wavy Grain in Beech (_after      Nordlinger_).]    In the wood of many broad-leaved trees the wood fibres are much longer  when full grown than when they are first formed in the cambium or  growing zone. This causes the tips of each fibre to crowd in between  the fibres above and below, and leads to an irregular interlacement of  these fibres, which adds to the toughness, but reduces the  cleavability of the wood. At the juncture of the limb and stem the  fibres on the upper and lower sides of the limb behave differently.  On the lower side they run from the stem into the limb, forming an  uninterrupted"]]]
