There will then be just one perspective in which one of the  new pennies looks circular and the other straight. This will be, by  definition, the place where the original penny was in perspective space.    The above is, of course, only a first rough sketch of the way in which  our definition is to be reached. It neglects the size of the penny, and  it assumes that we can remove the penny without being disturbed by any  simultaneous changes in the positions of other things. But it is plain  that such niceties cannot affect the principle, and can only introduce  complications in its application.    Having now defined the perspective which is the place where a given  thing is, we can understand what is meant by saying that the  perspectives in which a thing looks large are nearer to the thing than  those in which it looks small: they are, in fact, nearer to the  perspective which is the place where the thing is.    We can now also explain the correlation between a private space and  parts of perspective space. If there is an aspect of a given thing in a  certain private space, then we correlate the place where this aspect is  in the private space with the place where the thing is in perspective  space.    We may define \"here\" as the place, in perspective space, which is  occupied by our private world. Thus we can now understand what is meant  by speaking of a thing as near to or far from \"here.\" A thing is near to  \"here\" if the place where it is is near to my private world. We can also  understand what is meant by saying that our private world is inside our  head; for our private world is a place in perspective space, and may be  part of the place where our head is.    It will be observed that _two_ places in perspective space are  associated with every aspect of a thing: namely, the place where the  thing is, and the place which is the perspective of which the aspect in  question forms part. Every aspect of a thing is a member of two  different classes of aspects, namely: (1) the various aspects of the  thing, of which at most one appears in any given perspective; (2) the  perspective of which the given aspect is a member, _i.e._ that in which  the thing has the given aspect. The physicist naturally classifies  aspects in the first way, the psychologist in the second. The two places  associated with a single aspect correspond to the two ways of  classifying it. We may distinguish the two places as that _at_ which,  and that _from_ which, the aspect appears. The \"place at which\" is the  place of the thing to which the aspect belongs; the \"place from which\"  is the place of the perspective to which the aspect belongs.    Let us now endeavour to state the fact that the aspect which a thing  presents at a given place is affected by the intervening medium. The  aspects of a thing in different perspectives are to be conceived as  spreading outwards from the place where the thing is, and undergoing  various changes as they get further away from this place. The laws  according to which they change cannot be stated if we only take account  of the aspects that are near the thing, but require that we should also  take account of the things that are at the places from which these  aspects appear. This empirical fact can, therefore, be interpreted in  terms of our construction.    We have now constructed a largely hypothetical picture of the world,  which contains and places the experienced facts, including those derived  from testimony. The world we have constructed can, with a certain amount  of trouble, be used to interpret the crude facts of sense, the facts of  physics, and the facts of physiology. It is therefore a world which  _may_ be actual. It fits the facts, and there is no empirical evidence  against it; it also is free from logical impossibilities. But have we  any good reason to suppose that it is real? This brings us back to our  original problem, as to the grounds for believing in the existence of  anything outside my private world. What we have derived from our  hypothetical construction is that there are no grounds _against_ the  truth of this belief, but we have not derived any positive grounds in  its favour. We will resume this inquiry by taking up again the question  of testimony and the evidence for the existence of other minds.    It must be conceded to begin with that the argument in favour of the  existence of other people's minds cannot be conclusive. A phantasm of  our dreams will appear to have a mind--a mind to be annoying, as a rule.  It will give unexpected answers, refuse to conform to our desires, and  show all those other signs of intelligence to which we are accustomed in  the acquaintances of our waking hours. And yet, when we are awake, we do  not believe that the phantasm was, like the appearances of people in  waking life, representative of a private world to which we have no  direct access. If we are to believe this of the people we meet when we  are awake, it must be on some ground short of demonstration, since it is  obviously possible that what we call waking life may be only an  unusually persistent and recurrent nightmare. It may be that our  imagination brings forth all that other people seem to say to us, all  that we read in books, all the daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly  journals that distract our thoughts, all the advertisements of soap and  all the speeches of politicians. This _may_ be true, since it cannot be  shown to be false, yet no one can really believe it. Is there any  _logical_ ground for regarding this possibility as improbable? Or is  there nothing beyond habit and prejudice?    The minds of other people are among our data, in the very wide sense in  which we used the word at first. That is to say, when we first begin to  reflect, we find ourselves already believing in them, not because of any  argument, but because the belief is natural to us. It is, however, a  psychologically derivative belief, since it results from observation of  people's bodies; and along with other such beliefs, it does not belong  to the hardest of hard data, but becomes, under the influence of  philosophic reflection, just sufficiently questionable to make us desire  some argument connecting it with the facts of sense.    The obvious argument is, of course, derived from analogy. Other people's  bodies behave as ours do when we have certain thoughts and feelings;  hence, by analogy, it is natural to suppose that such behaviour is  connected with thoughts and feelings like our own. Someone says, \"Look  out!\" and we find we are on the point of being killed by a motor-car; we  therefore attribute the words we heard to the person in question having  seen the motor-car first, in which case there are existing things of  which we are not directly conscious. But this whole scene, with our  inference, may occur in a dream, in which case the inference is  generally considered to be mistaken. Is there anything to make the  argument from analogy more cogent when we are (as we think) awake?    The analogy in waking life is only to be preferred to that in dreams on  the ground of its greater extent and consistency. If a man were to dream  every night about a set of people whom he never met by day, who had  consistent characters and grew older with the lapse of years, he might,  like the man in Calderon's play, find it difficult to decide which was  the dream-world and which was the so-called \"real\" world. It is only the  failure of our dreams to form a consistent whole either with each other  or with waking life that makes us condemn them. Certain uniformities are  observed in waking life, while dreams seem quite erratic. The natural  hypothesis would be that demons and the spirits of the dead visit us  while we sleep; but the modern mind, as a rule, refuses to entertain  this view, though it is hard to see what could be said against it. On  the other hand, the mystic, in moments of illumination, seems to awaken  from a sleep which has filled all his mundane life: the whole world of  sense becomes phantasmal, and he sees, with the clarity and  convincingness that belongs to our morning realisation after dreams, a  world utterly different from that of our daily cares and troubles. Who  shall condemn him? Who shall justify him? Or who shall justify the  seeming solidity of the common objects among which we suppose ourselves  to live?    The hypothesis that other people have minds must, I think, be allowed to  be not susceptible of any very strong support from the analogical  argument. At the same time, it is a hypothesis which systematises a vast  body of facts and never leads to any consequences which there is reason  to think false. There is therefore nothing to be said against its truth,  and good reason to use it as a working hypothesis. When once it is  admitted, it enables us to extend our knowledge of the sensible world by  testimony, and thus leads to the system of private worlds which we  assumed in our hypothetical construction. In actual fact, whatever we  may try to think as philosophers, we cannot help believing in the minds  of other people, so that the question whether our belief is justified  has a merely speculative interest. And if it is justified, then there is  no further difficulty of principle in that vast extension of our  knowledge, beyond our own private data, which we find in science and  common sense.    This somewhat meagre conclusion must not be regarded as the whole  outcome of our long discussion. The problem of the connection of sense  with objective reality has commonly been dealt with from a standpoint  which did not carry initial doubt so far as we have carried it; most  writers, consciously or unconsciously, have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37122"],[0,"Hunting in Many Lands: The Book of the Boone and Crockett Club (#17)"],[1,"canoe in summer--that is  to say, you avoid the rough country by traveling on the rivers, which  are usually covered with thick ice, or over the same portages that are  used in summer. It was necessary for either Penrose, Keller or myself to  lead the way with our snowshoes, while the others took care of the  dog-sleds behind. The dogs followed accurately in the trail beaten out  by our snowshoes for them.    The country on this side of the lake, unlike that of the west, is very  rough, rocky and rugged, and especially so near the lake shore. It is  quite thickly timbered. As one advances into the interior, however, this  aspect changes, so that the country near the height of land is more  open, and there are long stretches of nearly level country traversed by  rocky, moss-covered and roughly parallel ridges. There is more or less  timber on these ridges, and in the so-called muskegs between them. This  is the country which the caribou seem to prefer.    After about two weeks' hard traveling, we reached the country which had  been recommended to us and came upon great abundance of caribou sign. In  fact, there were millions of tracks, but, curiously enough, no caribou  were to be seen. We afterward found that they had been driven out by a  lot of wolves, which probably had followed them down from the north.  While this explanation was interesting, it was not productive of any  great amount of satisfaction to the party, for we had been counting  definitely upon fresh meat, and so had our dogs. At least, after doing  the terrific work necessary to make this journey, it is fair to presume  that they had counted upon being fed, and not being left to starve  miserably while tied to a tree.    To add to our hardships, our Indian tepee, made of canvas, began to  smoke so excessively as to cause us the greatest discomfort, and we all  thought we had pneumonia; but afterward concluded it was nothing but  irritation of the lungs, due to breathing pine smoke a good many hours  each day. In fact, it was almost unbearable. An Indian tepee of this  kind, properly made by a squaw, is beyond doubt the most comfortable of  all hunting tents in any respectable climate; but in a climate of 40  degrees below zero it is an abomination. We used frequently to crawl  into our sheep-skin sleeping bags, wrap several blankets around the bags  and put the fire out, merely to get relief from the annoyance of the  smoke. In the morning the steam which arose from our bodies, and from  the meal which we might be cooking, got mixed up with the smoke, so that  it was impossible to distinguish each other when four feet apart. In  fact, we were sometimes inclined to think that the dogs on the outside  were better off than ourselves, though the appearance they presented in  the morning was not such as to cause us to wish to change places with  them. They were each tied by a short chain to the pine trees about the  camp, and after a night of low temperature there were to be seen in the  morning only twelve white mounds of snow; not that any snow had fallen  during the night, or that the dogs had crawled underneath that already  on the ground. Their white appearance was simply due to the dense  coating of frost which had been produced from the condensation caused by  the heat of their bodies. It must not be forgotten, however, that they  are as hardy and as well able to withstand this rigorous climate as the  wolves, from which many of them are directly descended. All of the  so-called \"huskies\" are of this type.    Altogether things were not very pleasant about this time. Our Christmas  Day rations consisted of one small roll each with a little coffee for  breakfast, and in the evening each man was given a small piece of  rabbit.    The rabbits in this country were unfortunately not as abundant as they  were on the opposite side of the lake, where the Indian boy one day went  out with one of our rifles to visit his rabbit snares and to shoot  rabbits for the dogs. Before long we heard him shoot four times. He came  back to camp with eight rabbits, which had certainly been killed with  the rifle, none of them having been snared.    Those of us who were able to hunt at all hunted with the greatest  perseverance, but with little success, until finally some one brought in  the report that caribou had been seen, and in a very few days the  country again contained numbers of them.    One morning, shortly after the first caribou had been seen, Keller, who  had been quite sick, was unable longer to tolerate the smoke of the  tepee, and took a little walk with his rifle close around our camp. He  soon came upon the fresh trail of a bunch of caribou. He had followed it  only a few hundred yards when he saw one of the caribou lying down. He  is a dead shot, the best I have ever known in my life. He carefully  steadied himself, raised his .45-90 Winchester, aimed at the caribou  lying down and fired. When he went up to look at it, to his amazement,  he came across another dead caribou, between the spot where he had fired  and the one at which he had aimed. It had been shot straight through the  temples. On going further, he found the other caribou shot exactly where  he had aimed at it, some twenty yards distant from the first one. The  only possible way in which he could explain this remarkable occurrence  is that the caribou which had been shot through the head, and which he  had not seen, had risen out of its bed just as he was in the act of  firing and interposed his head directly in the line of fire. The fact  of having fresh meat in camp, of course, brought great joy to us all,  and especially to the semi-starved dogs. As in the case of killing the  first moose, it seemed to have the effect of changing our luck, for we  afterward killed a number of caribou, although we were not successful in  getting good heads.    These caribou are totally different from the moose in the kind of food  they live upon and in their general habits. They prefer a different sort  of a country, the two rarely being found together. They spend much of  their time in the muskegs, which seem to be characteristic of all of  that region of the country; but these muskegs are not open, like those  on the west side of the lake, being more or less covered with a growth  of stubby jack pine, from which usually hangs an abundance of long gray  moss. The caribou feed upon this moss, while the moose, on the other  hand, are fond of the tender sprouts of the red and gray willow. The  caribou, however, are often found on the rocky ridges, where they find  good feed on the moss growing upon the rocks. Indeed, they seem to have  no settled place of abode, like moose, being probably one of the most  restless animals on the face of the earth. They seem to be always on  the move. Unlike the moose, they are very inquisitive, in this respect  being more like the antelope than any other animal. They are found  singly, or in twos or threes, or in small bunches of ten to twenty, but  often in great herds of a hundred or perhaps a thousand. They spend a  great deal of their time on the lakes in the winter, where they play  with each other like kittens. They are wonderfully quick in their  actions. They are also very sure of their footing, and we saw a number  of places in the snow where they had slid down quite steep rocks for  some distance, probably by putting their four feet close together. Great  herds often come down from the region on the western shore of Hudson Bay  and return the following summer.    Very few people have any idea of the immense numbers of caribou which  are found in the great tract of country to the west of Hudson Bay. By  many who are familiar with this country they are believed to be as  numerous as the buffaloes ever were in the early days. When more or less  scarce, as they were during the greater portion of our hunt, they afford  excellent hunting; but I should imagine that when they are very  numerous there would be little sport in killing them, for as a rule they  are not at all shy or difficult to approach. In general it may be said  that the caribou of this region, known as the woodland caribou, live in  the wooded districts during the summer and autumn, but in the winter  time go to the higher land. Wind and cold seem to have no terror for  them, and I doubt very much whether there is an animal in the world,  with the exception perhaps of the musk-ox or the polar bear, that is so  well fitted by nature to withstand the intense cold of the region in  which they live. When one sees a caribou's track for the first time, he  is amazed at its size, and its difference from the long, narrow,  sharp-toed track of the moose, and naturally comes to the conclusion  that the animal must be much larger than it really is. As a matter of  fact, they are not much larger than the black-tailed deer, and  considerably smaller than the elk of the Rocky Mountains. Until he has  seen them, one is likely to imagine that the caribou is an ungainly,  misshapen animal. This is a great mistake. Not only are they as a rule  well proportioned, but they are extremely graceful. Their curious horns  give them, of course, rather an odd appearance. The meat we found to be  delicious, and rather better than moose meat.    After having remained as long as we desired in this country, and as long  as we could stand the infernal smoke of the tepee, and after having  secured a good supply of meat for our return journey, we loaded our  toboggans and retraced our steps without especial incident to the mouth  of the Bad Throat River. From there we took a sleigh to Selkirk, driving  over the lake on the ice, and arriving at Selkirk the latter part of  January or the 1st of February.    To those who may contemplate taking a similar trip to the Canadian woods  in winter, I would say that it will prove a very interesting and  never-to-be-forgotten experience, and that the hardships of such a trip  are not"]]]
