Not so long ago a writer, Dr. J. N. Lane, in the BRITISH  MEDICAL JOURNAL gave some interesting, information with respect to  coffee and brain work. As the result of his own experience he  recommended \"a cup of strong coffee, without cream or sugar, preceded  and followed by a glass of hot water every morning before breakfast.  The various secretions are thus stimulated, the nerve force aroused, no  matter how the duties of the preceding day and night may have drawn  upon the system. Another cup at four in the afternoon is sufficient to  sustain the energies for many hours.\" It is only fair to add, however,  that the JOURNAL went on to remark that in this way some 50 grains of  caffeine would be taken each week, and that very little more might  develop injurious symptoms, so that the power of doing an illimitable  amount of work would be obtained under somewhat risky conditions.    One of its most remarkable effects is that of relieving the feeling of  fatigue or exhaustion, whether this be produced by brain work or bodily  labour. It enables the system also to bear up under an empty stomach  and when the supply of food is shortened. In this way it is of signal  value to the soldier in the field. Professor E.A. Parkes, all admitted  authority on these matters, bears testimony to the fact that in  military service it invigorates the system and is almost equally  useful against both cold and heat--against cold by reason of its  warmth, and against heat by its action on the skin. It appears, also,  to do sway with the need for sleep, probably from its arousing the  mental faculties, and the effect of a strong cup of coffee in inducing  wakefulness is well known. Coffee has, moreover, a distinct action on  the heart, and tends to strengthen it. The Germans are great believers  in its virtues, and Vogel, one of the principal authorities on diseases  of children, recommends it for them, mixed with cream, both as a food  and as a tonic.    In addition to the foregoing, coffee is also employed by reason of its  important medicinal virtues. In malarious countries a cup of hot strong  coffee, in the early morning, is regarded as a preventive against fever  and ague. It is a valuable agent in many cases of heart disease,  particularly when associated with dropsy. In Bright's disease of the  kidneys, where dropsy is present, it is likewise given with benefit.  Strong coffee is also a well-known remedy in asthma, both in relieving  the actual attack and in acting as a restorative after it is over. It  frequently gives great relief in many forms of nervous headache,  particularly in that variety known as migraine, in which the pain is  generally limited to one side of the head. And, lastly, coffee is a  valuable remedy in opium poisoning, where there is such a tendency to a  fatal coma.    From the foregoing it must be evident that coffee occupies a very high  position as a beverage. All that concerns its preparation, therefore,  is of undoubted interest. In the first place, to obtain coffee in  perfection it is indispensable that the beans be roasted at home, and  not only should the roasting be done in the house, but the operation  ought really to be performed immediately before the coffee is made, and  the reasons thereof I shall give in speaking of the process of  roasting. Many people do not care sufficiently about the  perfection of coffee to go to this trouble, and are content with having  their roasted coffee beans sent to them daily from their grocer. The  leading establishments roast their coffee beans daily, and from them  the latter may be obtained and ground in the mill at home. This, of  course, though not giving the real thing, is an immense improvement on  the hallowed tradition, so dear to some, of purchasing their weekly  supply of,,round coffee at a time and keeping it in a tin or vessel for  use as required. But, as I said before, if perfection is aimed at, the  roasting must be done at home.    In the selection of the green beans care should be taxiway to see that  they are nearly all of the same size, for if some are small and others  large, when it comes to roasting it will be found that the small ones  are done to a cinder, while the larger beans are hardly touched. The  beans, too, should be perfectly dry; if moist, they should be dried in  a dish by the fire or in the oven before going into the roaster. On the  coffee plantations the drying of the bean is considered a most  important matter when preparing them for export.    In the process of roasting, a volatile oil which gives to coffee its  unique fragrance is developed. It is somewhat curious that no amount of  boiling could educe this from the raw bean. This oil is exceedingly  volatile, and begins to disperse and evaporate the very moment it is  born. Hence, to obtain the perfection of coffee, no time should be lost  in grinding and making it directly it is roasted. When the fragrant  vapour of the roasted bean is first given off, it is soon followed by a  peculiar noise, caused by the splitting and crackling of the external  silvery greenish covering of the raw beans. At this time, or very  shortly afterwards, the latter are of a yellowish hue, but before long  they change into that desirable lightish brown colour, when the  peculiar volatile coffee oils are at their best.    The best mill for grinding the coffee, and one which may be  obtained from any ironmonger, is that which can be screwed on the edge  of the kitchen table or dresser. It has a little contrivance to  regulate the size of the grains. and care must be taken not to grind  the coffee too fine; it should be in minute crumbs rather than in  powder.    As I have already said, the perfection of coffee is only to be obtained  under three conditions. These are, first, that the beans should be  roasted at home; that they should be ground without much delay; and,  thirdly, made into coffee as soon as possible. Many people are,  however, unable to carry out the first of these three requirements. The  next best substitute is to have the roasted coffee beans sent daily to  them by their grocer. This is a practice which might be followed more  frequently with a great deal of advantage, for all are able, at least,  to possess a mill and grind their own coffee at home.    The making of the coffee is quite as important as the preceding, and  the number of different models of coffee-makers is almost perplexing.  But of them all, the one which is simplest, and perhaps most effective,  is the ordinary CAFETIERS, or French coffee-pot. This has the advantage  of costing only a few shillings, and is readily obtainable from any  ironmonger. It consists of an upper compartment in which the coffee is  made, and a lower part--the coffee-pot itself--into which the coffee  descends. These two portions are quite separate, although the upper  fits on the lower. The floor--on which the coffee is placed--of the  upper part is perforated by a number of minute holes There is also a  movable strainer about an inch in depth, which fits on top of the upper  part; and a presser, consisting of a long rod with a circular plate at  its end, which for convenience passes through the centre of the  strainer, and rests on the perforated floor of the upper part.    There are one or two points to be borne in mind in the making of  coffee. As a rule English-speaking people do not allow enough coffee to  each cup. The almost universal fault of coffee, made elsewhere than on  the Continent, is its want of strength and flavour. With regard to the  admixture of chicory, this is largely a question of taste, and the  palate must be consulted in the matter. The great majority of people,  however, cannot do without it, and it is quite (when genuine) a  harmless addition. Madame Lebour-Fawssett recommends the following  proportions: For making CAFE NOIR, or coffee after meals, there should  be six teaspoonsful of coffee, heaped up, and a very small teaspoonful  of chicory, or none at all, for one pint of water. The chicory must be  left out altogether, and another teaspoonful of coffee substituted for  those who object to chicory with their CAFE NOIR. For morning coffee or  cafe au lait there should be ten or twelve teaspoonsful of coffee, with  a sixth part of chicory, for each pint of water. As Madame Lebour-Fawssett  remarks, CAFE AU LAIT is never complete without chicory, but  care should be taken not to overdo it, since too much chicory renders  the coffee quite undrinkable. Of course, if you do not require as much  as a pint of coffee, the quantities may be reduced, still observing the  same proportions. Before pouring out the coffee, the cup should first  be half filled with hot milk, and then the coffee added.    Now, having seen what proportions of coffee and chicory are to be  employed for CAFE NOIR and CAFE AU LAIT respectively, it will be better  to describe the actual making of the coffee, since the CAFETIERE will  then be more easily understood. We will suppose its upper part is  fitted into its place on the top of the lower portion, and that the  strainer and presser have been removed for the time being. Enough  boiling water should first of all be poured in to fill both the  upper and lower compartments, allowed to stand for a couple of minutes,  and then poured away. This brings everything to a proper heat for  receiving the coffee.    Next put the amount of coffee necessary upon the perforated floor of  the upper part. The coffee should then be well pressed down with the  presser, and the latter instrument next laid aside. After this the  strainer should be replaced on top of the upper compartment, and the  required amount of boiling water, a little at a time, poured in through  it (the strainer).

It is but a dogma of  unauthorized and erring churches, at once unscriptural, unreasonable,  and revolting to one who loves mercy and honors justice. True, the  scriptures speak of everlasting burnings, eternal damnation, and the  vengeance of eternal fire,[160] as characteristics of the judgment  provided for the wicked; yet in no instance is there justification for  the inference that the individual sinner will have to suffer the wrath  of offended justice forever and ever. The punishment in any case is  sufficiently severe without the added and supreme horror of unending  continuation. Justice must have her due; but when \"the uttermost  farthing\" is paid, the prison doors shall open and the captive be  free. But the prison remains, and the law prescribing punishment for  offences will not be repealed.      [160] Matt. xviii, 8; xxv, 41, 46; II Thess. i, 9; Mark iii, 29;    Jude 7.    =18.= So general were the ill-effects of the commonly-accepted  doctrine, unscriptural and untrue though it was, regarding the endless  torment awaiting every sinner, that even before the Church had been  formally organized in the present dispensation, God gave a revelation  through the Prophet Joseph Smith, touching this matter, in which we  read:--\"And surely every man must repent or suffer; for I, God, am  endless: wherefore I revoke not the judgments which I shall pass, but  woes shall go forth, weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth, yea to  those who are found on my left hand; nevertheless it is not written  that there shall be no end to this torment, but it is written endless  torment. Again it is written eternal damnation ... for behold, I am  endless, and the punishment which is given from my hand, is endless  punishment, for Endless is my name; wherefore, eternal punishment is  God's punishment. Endless punishment is God's punishment.[161]\"      [161] Revelation given March, 1830; Doc. and Cov. xix, 4-12.    =19. Satan.=--We have had occasion to refer frequently to the author  of evil among men. This is Satan,[162] the adversary or opponent of  the Lord, the chief of all evil spirits, called also the Devil,[163]  Beelzebub,[164] or the Prince of Devils, Perdition,[165] and  Belial.[166] The figurative appellations Dragon and Serpent are  applied to Satan, when reference is made to his fall.[167] We learn  from the revealed word[168] that Satan was once an angel of light; he  was then known as Lucifer, a Son of the Morning, but his uncontrolled  ambition prompted him to aspire to the glory and power of the Father,  to secure which he made the unjust proposition to redeem the human  family by compulsion; failing in this purpose, he headed an open  rebellion against the Father and the Son, drawing a third of the hosts  of heaven into his impious league.[169] These rebellious spirits were  expelled from heaven, and have since followed the impulses of their  wicked natures by seeking to lead human souls to their own condition  of darkness. They are the Devil and his angels. The right of free  agency, maintained and vindicated by the fateful strife in heaven,  prevents the possibility of compulsion being employed in this fiendish  work of degradation; but the powers of these malignant spirits to  tempt and persuade are used to their utmost limits. Satan tempted Eve  to transgress the law of God;[170] it was he who imparted the secret  of murder to the fratricide, Cain.[171]      [162] Job i, 6-22; ii, 1-7; Zech. iii, 1-2.      [163] Matt. iv, 5, 8, 11; I Peter v, 8.      [164] Matt. xii, 24.      [165] Doc. and Cov. lxxvi, 26.      [166] II Cor. vi, 15.      [167] Rev. xii, 9; xx, 2.      [168] Doc. and Cov. lxxvi, 25-27.      [169] Doc. and Cov. xxix, 36-37; see also Pearl of Great Price:    Moses iv, 3-7; Abraham iii, 27-28; \"Jesus the Christ,\" pp. 8, 9.      [170] Genesis iii, 4-5, and Pearl of Great Price: Moses iv, 6-11.      [171] Pearl of Great Price: Moses v, 29-33.    =20.= Satan exerts a mastery over the spirits that have been corrupted  by his practices; he is the foremost of the angels who were thrust  down, and the instigator of the ruin of those who fall in this life;  he seeks to molest and hinder mankind in good efforts, by tempting to  sin; it may be by imposing sickness,[172] or possibly death. Yet in  all these malignant doings, he can go no farther than the  transgressions of the victim may enable him, or the wisdom of God may  permit him to go, and he may at any time be checked by the superior  power. Indeed, even the operations of his utmost malice may be turned  to the accomplishment of Divine purposes. The scriptures prove to us  that the days of Satan's power are already numbered,[173] his doom has  been pronounced, and in the Lord's own time he will be completely  overcome. He is to be bound during the millennial reign,[174] and  after that thousand years of blessed peace, he will be loosed for a  little season; then his defeat will be made complete, and his power  over the children of God will be entirely destroyed.      [172] Luke xiii, 16; Job i.      [173] John xii, 31; xvi, 11.      [174] Rev. xx, 1-10.      THE FALL.    =21. Our First Parents in Eden.=[175]--The crowning scene of the great  drama of creation was the forming of man in the image of his spiritual  Father, God.[176] For the reception of the first man, the Creator had  specially prepared a choice region of earth, and had embellished it  with natural beauties calculated to gladden the heart of its royal  possessor. \"The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden,[177] and  there he put the man whom he had formed.\"[178] Soon after man's advent  upon the earth the Lord created for him a companion or help-meet,  declaring that it was not good that man should be alone,[179] Thus,  male and female, Adam and his wife Eve, were placed in the Garden.  They had been given dominion \"over the fish of the sea, and over the  fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the  earth.\"[180] With this great power were associated certain special  commands, the first of which in point of importance was that they \"be  fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth, and subdue it;\" then,  that they refrain from eating or even touching the fruit of a certain  tree, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which grew in the midst  of the Garden, though of all other fruits they were permitted to  freely partake. The words of God concerning this command and its  penalty are:--\"And I, the Lord God, commanded the man, saying, of  every tree in the garden thou mayest freely eat, but of the tree of  the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; nevertheless  thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee, but  remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou  shalt surely die.\"[181]      [175] Read Genesis, chapters ii and iii; Pearl of Great Price:    Moses iii, iv: Abraham v, 7-21.      [176] Genesis i, 26; Pearl of Great Price: Moses ii, 27.      [177] See Note 3.      [178] Genesis ii, 8-9.      [179] Genesis ii, 18; Pearl of Great Price: Moses iii, 18, 21-24.      [180] Genesis i, 28; Pearl of Great Price: Moses ii, 28; Abraham    iv, 28.      [181] Pearl of Great Price: Moses iii, 16-17; see also Genesis ii,    16-17.    =22. The Temptation= to disobey this command soon came. Satan  presented himself before Eve in the Garden, and, speaking by the mouth  of the serpent, questioned her about the commands which God had given  respecting the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Eve answered that  they were forbidden even to touch the fruit of that tree, under  penalty of death. Satan then sought to beguile the woman,  contradicting the Lord's statement, and declaring that death would not  follow a violation of the Divine injunction; but that, on the other  hand, by doing that which the Lord had forbidden, she and her husband  would become like unto the gods, knowing good and evil for themselves.  The woman was captivated by these representations; and, being eager to  possess the advantages pictured by Satan, she disobeyed the command of  the Lord, and partook of the fruit forbidden. She feared not evil,  for she knew it not. Then, telling Adam what she had done, she urged  him to do likewise.    =23.= Adam found himself in a position that impelled him to disobey  one of the requirements of God. He and his wife had been commanded to  multiply and replenish the earth. Adam was still immortal; Eve had  come under the penalty of mortality; and in such dissimilar  conditions, the two could not remain together, and therefore could not  fulfill the Divine requirement. On the other hand, Adam would be  disobeying another command by yielding to his wife's request. He  deliberately and wisely decided to stand by the first and greater  commandment; and, therefore, with a full comprehension of the nature  of his act, he also partook of the fruit that grew on the Tree of  Knowledge. The fact that Adam acted understandingly in this matter is  affirmed by the scriptures. Paul, in writing to Timothy, explained  that \"Adam was not deceived; but the woman, being deceived, was in the  transgression.\"[182] The prophet Lehi, in expounding the scriptures to  his sons, declared \"Adam fell that man might be, and men are that they  might have joy.\"[183]      [182] I Timothy ii, 14. See Note 8.      [183] II Nephi ii, 25.    =24. The Tree of Life.=--There was another tree of special virtues in  Eden; its fruit insured life to all who ate of it. While Adam and Eve  lived in innocent immortality, this tree had not been forbidden them;  the celestial fruit indeed was fitting food for their sinless state.  Now that they had transgressed, however, now that the Divine decree  had issued, fixing death as their lot, it was not proper that the  fruit of the Tree of Life should be longer within their reach. They  were, therefore, expelled from the Garden, and cherubim with a flaming  sword guarded the way,"]]]
