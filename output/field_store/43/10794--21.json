He did       this simply by measuring from the half-moon's straight edge the       distance at which their peaks caught the rising or setting sun. The       above simple diagram shows that as this distance is to the diameter       of the moon, so is the height of the sun-tipped mountain to the       aforesaid distance.    Wherever Galileo turned his telescope new stars appeared. The Milky Way,  which had so puzzled the ancients, was found to be composed of stars.  Stars that appeared single to the eye were some of them found to be  double; and at intervals were found hazy nebulous wisps, some of which  seemed to be star clusters, while others seemed only a fleecy cloud.    [Illustration: FIG. 43.--Some clusters and nebulae.]    [Illustration: FIG. 44.--Jupiter's satellites, showing the stages of  their discovery.]    Now we come to his most brilliant, at least his most sensational,  discovery. Examining Jupiter minutely on January 7, 1610, he noticed  three little stars near it, which he noted down as fixing its then  position. On the following night Jupiter had moved to the other side of  the three stars. This was natural enough, but was it moving the right  way? On examination it appeared not. Was it possible the tables were  wrong? The next evening was cloudy, and he had to curb his feverish  impatience. On the 10th there were only two, and those on the other  side. On the 11th two again, but one bigger than the other. On the 12th  the three re-appeared, and on the 13th there were four. No more  appeared.    Jupiter then had moons like the earth, four of them in fact, and they  revolved round him in periods which were soon determined.         The reason why they were not all visible at first, and why their       visibility so rapidly changes, is because they revolve round him       almost in the plane of our vision, so that sometimes they are in       front and sometimes behind him, while again at other times they       plunge into his shadow and are thus eclipsed from the light of the       sun which enables us to see them. A large modern telescope will       show the moons when in front of Jupiter, but small telescopes will       only show them when clear of the disk and shadow. Often all four       can be thus seen, but three or two is a very common amount of       visibility. Quite a small telescope, such as a ship's telescope, if       held steadily, suffices to show the satellites of Jupiter, and very       interesting objects they are. They are of habitable size, and may       be important worlds for all we know to the contrary.    The news of the discovery soon spread and excited the greatest interest  and astonishment. Many of course refused to believe it. Some there were  who having been shown them refused to believe their eyes, and asserted  that although the telescope acted well enough for terrestrial objects,  it was altogether false and illusory when applied to the heavens. Others  took the safer ground of refusing to look through the glass. One of  these who would not look at the satellites happened to die soon  afterwards. \"I hope,\" says Galileo, \"that he saw them on his way to  heaven.\"    The way in which Kepler received the news is characteristic, though by  adding four to the supposed number of planets it might have seemed to  upset his notions about the five regular solids.         He says,[9] \"I was sitting idle at home thinking of you, most       excellent Galileo, and your letters, when the news was brought me       of the discovery of four planets by the help of the double       eye-glass. Wachenfels stopped his carriage at my door to tell me,       when such a fit of wonder seized me at a report which seemed so       very absurd, and I was thrown into such agitation at seeing an old       dispute between us decided in this way, that between his joy, my       colouring, and the laughter of us both, confounded as we were by       such a novelty, we were hardly capable, he of speaking, or I of       listening....         \"On our separating, I immediately fell to thinking how there could       be any addition to the number of planets without overturning my       _Mysterium Cosmographicon_, published thirteen years ago, according       to which Euclid's five regular solids do not allow more than six       planets round the sun.         \"But I am so far from disbelieving the existence of the four       circumjovial planets that I long for a telescope to anticipate you       if possible in discovering two round Mars (as the proportion seems       to me to require) six or eight round Saturn, and one each round       Mercury and Venus.\"    [Illustration: FIG. 45.--Eclipses of Jupiter's satellites. The diagram  shows the first (_i.e._ the nearest) moon in Jupiter's shadow, the  second as passing between earth and Jupiter, and appearing to transit  his disk, the third as on the verge of entering his shadow, and the  fourth quite plainly and separately visible.]    As an illustration of the opposite school, I will take the following  extract from Francesco Sizzi, a Florentine astronomer, who argues  against the discovery thus:--         \"There are seven windows in the head, two nostrils, two eyes, two       ears, and a mouth; so in the heavens there are two favourable       stars, two unpropitious, two luminaries, and Mercury alone       undecided and indifferent. From which and many other similar       phenomena of nature, such as the seven metals, &c., which it were       tedious to enumerate, we gather that the number of planets is       necessarily seven.         \"Moreover, the satellites are invisible to the naked eye, and       therefore can have no influence on the earth, and therefore would       be useless, and therefore do not exist.         \"Besides, the Jews and other ancient nations as well as modern       Europeans have adopted the division of the week into seven days,       and have named them from the seven planets: now if we increase the       number of the planets this whole system falls to the ground.\"    To these arguments Galileo replied that whatever their force might be as  a reason for believing beforehand that no more than seven planets would  be discovered, they hardly seemed of sufficient weight to destroy the  new ones when actually seen.    Writing to Kepler at this time, Galileo ejaculates:         \"Oh, my dear Kepler, how I wish that we could have one hearty laugh       together! Here, at Padua, is the principal professor of philosophy       whom I have repeatedly and urgently requested to look at the moon       and planets through my glass, which he pertinaciously refuses to       do. Why are you not here? What shouts of laughter we should have at       this glorious folly! And to hear the professor of philosophy at       Pisa labouring before the grand duke with logical arguments, as if       with magical incantations, to charm the new planets out of the       sky.\"    A young German _protege_ of Kepler, Martin Horkey, was travelling in  Italy, and meeting Galileo at Bologna was favoured with a view through  his telescope. But supposing that Kepler must necessarily be jealous of  such great discoveries, and thinking to please him, he writes, \"I cannot  tell what to think about these observations. They are stupendous, they  are wonderful, but whether they are true or false I cannot tell.\" He  concludes, \"I will never concede his four new planets to that Italian  from Padua though I die for it.\" So he published a pamphlet asserting  that reflected rays and optical illusions were the sole cause of the  appearance, and that the only use of the imaginary planets was to  gratify Galileo's thirst for gold and notoriety.    When after this performance he paid a visit to his old instructor  Kepler, he got a reception which astonished him. However, he pleaded so  hard to be forgiven that Kepler restored him to partial favour, on this  condition, that he was to look again at the satellites, and this time to  see them and own that they were there.    By degrees the enemies of Galileo were compelled to confess to the truth  of the discovery, and the next step was to outdo him. Scheiner counted  five, Rheiter nine, and others went as high as twelve. Some of these  were imaginary, some were fixed stars, and four satellites only are  known to this day.[10]    Here, close to the summit of his greatness, we must leave him for a  time. A few steps more and he will be on the brow of the hill; a short  piece of table-land, and then the descent begins.          LECTURE V    GALILEO AND THE INQUISITION      One sinister event occurred while Galileo was at Padua, some time before  the era we have now arrived at, before the invention of the  telescope--two years indeed after he had first gone to Padua; an event  not directly concerning Galileo, but which I must mention because it  must have shadowed his life both at the time and long afterwards. It was  the execution of Giordano Bruno for heresy. This eminent philosopher had  travelled largely, had lived some time in England, had acquired new and  heterodox views on a variety of subjects, and did not hesitate to  propound them even after he had returned to Italy.    The Copernican doctrine of the motion of the earth was one of his  obnoxious heresies. Being persecuted to some extent by the Church, Bruno  took refuge in Venice--a free republic almost independent of the  Papacy--where he felt himself safe. Galileo was at Padua hard by: the  University of Padua was under the government of the Senate of Venice:  the two men must in all probability have met.    Well, the Inquisition at Rome sent messengers to Venice with a demand  for the extradition of Bruno--they wanted him at Rome to try him for  heresy.    In a moment of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28617"],[0,"Astounding Stories of Super-Science February 1930 (#17)"],[1," appearance  rarely seen except in very young boys.    \"I want what you picked up,\" went on the stranger.    \"It isn't yours!\" Northwood flashed back. Ah! that effluvium of hatred  which seemed to weave a tangible net around him!    \"Nor is it yours. Give it to me!\"    \"You're insolent, aren't you?\"    \"If you don't give it to me, you will be sorry.\" The man did not raise  his voice in anger, yet the words whipped Northwood with almost physical  violence. \"If he knew that I saw everything that happened in there--that  I am talking to you at this moment--he would tremble with fear.\"    \"But you can't intimidate me.\"    \"No?\" For a long moment, the cold blue eyes held his contemptuously.  \"No? I can't frighten you--you worm of the Black Age?\"    Before Northwood's horrified sight, he vanished; vanished as though he  had turned suddenly to air and floated away.           *       *       *       *       *    The street was not crowded at that time, and there was no pressing group  of bodies to hide the splendid creature. Northwood gawked stupidly,  mouth half open, eyes searching wildly everywhere. The man was gone. He  had simply disappeared, in this sane, electric-lighted street.    Suddenly, close to Northwood's ear, grated a derisive laugh. \"I can't  frighten you?\" From nowhere came that singularly young-old voice.    As Northwood jerked his head around to meet blank space, a blow struck  the corner of his mouth. He felt the warm blood run over his chin.    \"I could take that wallet from you, worm, but you may keep it, and see  me later. But remember this--the thing inside never will be yours.\"    The words fell from empty air.    For several minutes, Northwood waited at the spot, expecting another  demonstration of the abnormal, but nothing else occurred. At last,  trembling violently, he wiped the thick moisture from his forehead and  dabbed at the blood which he still felt on his chin.    But when he looked at his handkerchief, he muttered:    \"Well, I'll be jiggered!\"    The handkerchief bore not the slightest trace of blood.           *       *       *       *       *    Under the light in his bedroom, Northwood examined the wallet. It was  made of alligator skin, clasped with a gold signet that bore the initial  M. The first pocket was empty; the second yielded an object that sent a  warm flush to his face.    It was the photograph of a gloriously beautiful girl, so seductively  lovely that the picture seemed almost to be alive. The short, curved  upper lip, the full, delicately voluptuous lower, parted slightly in a  smile that seemed to linger in every exquisite line of her face. She  looked as though she had just spoken passionately, and the spirit of her  words had inspired her sweet flesh and eyes.    Northwood turned his head abruptly and groaned, \"Good Heavens!\"    He had no right to palpitate over the picture of an unknown beauty. Only  a month ago, he had become engaged to a young woman whose mind was as  brilliant as her face was plain. Always he had vowed that he would never  marry a pretty girl, for he detested his own masculine beauty sincerely.    He tried to grasp a mental picture of Mary Burns, who had never stirred  in him the emotion that this smiling picture invoked. But, gazing at the  picture, he could not remember how his fiancee looked.    Suddenly the picture fell from his fingers and dropped to the floor on  its face, revealing an inscription on the back. In a bold, masculine  hand, he read: \"Your future wife.\"    \"Some lucky fellow is headed for a life of bliss,\" was his jealous  thought.    He frowned at the beautiful face. What was this girl to that hideous  hunchback? Why did the handsome stranger warn him, \"_The thing inside  never will be yours_?\"    Again he turned eagerly to the wallet.    In the last flap he found something that gave him another surprise: a  plain white card on which a name and address were written by the same  hand that had penned the inscription on the picture.      Emil Mundson, Ph. D.,    44-1/2 Indian Court    Emil Mundson, the electrical wizard and distinguished scientific writer,  friend of the professor of science at the university where Northwood was  an assistant professor; Emil Mundson, whom, a week ago, Northwood had  yearned mightily to meet.    Now Northwood knew why the hunchback's intelligent, ugly face was  familiar to him. He had seen it pictured as often as enterprising news  photographers could steal a likeness from the over-sensitive scientist,  who would never sit for a formal portrait.           *       *       *       *       *    Even before Northwood had graduated from the university where he now  taught, he had been avidly interested in Emil Mundson's fantastic  articles in scientific journals. Only a week ago, Professor Michael had  come to him with the current issue of New Science, shouting excitedly:    \"Did you read this, John, this article by Emil Mundson?\" His shaking,  gnarled old fingers tapped the open magazine.    Northwood seized the magazine and looked avidly at the title of the  article, \"Creatures of the Light.\"    \"No, I haven't read it,\" he admitted. \"My magazine hasn't come yet.\"    \"Run through it now briefly, will you? And note with especial care the  passages I have marked. In fact, you needn't bother with anything else  just now. Read this--and this--and this.\" He pointed out penciled  paragraphs.    Northwood read:        Man always has been, always will be a creature of the light. He      is forever reaching for some future point of perfected evolution      which, even when his most remote ancestor was a fish creature      composed of a few cells, was the guiding power that brought him      up from the first stinking sea and caused him to create gods in      his own image.        It is this yearning for perfection which sets man apart from all      other life, which made him _man_ even in the rudimentary stages      of his development. He was man when he wallowed in the slime of      the new world and yearned for the air above. He will still be      man when he has evolved into that glorious creature of the      future whose body is deathless and whose mind rules the      universe.    Professor Michael, looking over Northwood's shoulder, interrupted the  reading:    \"_Man always has been man_,\" he droned emphatically. \"That's not  original with friend Mundson, of course; yet it is a theory that has not  received sufficient investigation.\" He indicated another marked  paragraph. \"Read this thoughtfully, John. It's the crux of Mundson's  thought.\"    Northwood continued:        Since the human body is chemical and electrical, increased      knowledge of its powers and limitations will enable us to work      with Nature in her sublime but infinitely slow processes of      human evolution. We need not wait another fifty thousand years      to be godlike creatures. Perhaps even now we may be standing at      the beginning of the splendid bridge that will take us to that      state of perfected evolution when we shall be Creatures who have      reached the Light.    Northwood looked questioningly at the professor. \"Queer, fantastic  thing, isn't it?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Professor Michael smoothed his thin, gray hair with his dried-out hand.  \"Fantastic?\" His intellectual eyes behind the thick glasses sought the  ceiling. \"Who can say? Haven't you ever wondered why all parents expect  their children to be nearer perfection than themselves, and why is it a  natural impulse for them to be willing to sacrifice themselves to better  their offspring?\" He paused and moistened his pale, wrinkled lips.  \"Instinct, Northwood. We Creatures of the Light know that our race shall  reach that point in evolution when, as perfect creatures, we shall rule  all matter and live forever.\" He punctuated the last words with blows  on the table.    Northwood laughed dryly. \"How many thousands of years are you looking  forward, Professor?\"    The professor made an obscure noise that sounded like a smothered sniff.  \"You and I shall never agree on the point that mental advancement may  wipe out physical limitations in the human race, perhaps in a few  hundred years. It seems as though your profound admiration for Dr.  Mundson would win you over to this pet theory.\"    \"But what sane man can believe that even perfectly developed beings,  through mental control, could overcome Nature's fixed laws?\"    \"We don't know! We don't know!\" The professor slapped the magazine with  an emphatic hand. \"Emil Mundson hasn't written this article for nothing.  He's paving the way for some announcement that will startle the  scientific world. I know him. In the same manner he gave out veiled  hints of his various brilliant discoveries and inventions long before he  offered them to the world.\"    \"But Dr. Mundson is an electrical wizard. He would not be delving  seriously into the mysteries of evolution, would he?\"    \"Why not?\" The professor's wizened face screwed up wisely. \"A year ago,  when he was back from one of those mysterious long excursions he takes  in that weirdly different aircraft of his, about which he is so  secretive, he told me that he was conducting experiments to prove his  belief that the human brain generates electric current, and that the  electrical impulses in the brain set up radioactive waves that some day,  among other miracles, will make thought communication possible. Perfect  man, he says, will perform mental feats which will give him complete  mental domination over the physical.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Northwood finished reading and turned thoughtfully to the window. His  profile in repose had the straight-nosed, full-lipped perfection of a  Greek coin. Old, wizened Professor Michael, gazing at him covertly,  smothered a sigh.    \"I wish you knew Dr. Mundson,\" he said. \"He, the ugliest man in the  world, delights in physical perfection. He would revel in your splendid"]]]
