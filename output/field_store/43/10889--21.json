[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35409"],[0,"Beauty: Illustrated Chiefly (#17)"],[1,"the stem constitutes a very beautiful form, because we  immediately perceive that it is the consequence of the weakness and  delicacy of the flower.\"    From the circumstances now described, it results that all the parts of  plants present the most surprising variety. They vary their direction  every moment, as Burke observes, and they change under the eye by a  deviation continually carrying on, but for whose beginning or end you will  find it difficult to ascertain a point.    Variety is therefore the third characteristic of this second kind of  beauty; and in the indiscriminating views of Burke, he made two similar  conditions, viz: \"Thirdly, to have a variety in the direction of the  parts; but, fourthly, to have those parts not angular, but melted as it  were into each other;\" thus applying these to beauty generally, to which  they are not applicable, but in a confused and imperfect way.    It is scarcely necessary to observe that variety, as a character of  beauty, owes its effect to the need of changing impressions, in order to  enliven our sensibility, which does not fail to become inactive under the  long-continued impression of the same stimulant.    It is connected with this variety that unequal numbers are preferred, as  we see in the number of flowers and of their petals, in that of leaves  grouped together, and in the indentations of these leaves.    From all this springs the fourth and last characteristic of this second  species of beauty, namely, contrast. This strikes us when we at once look  at the rigid stem and bending boughs, and all the variety which the latter  display.    It will be observed, that, of all the characteristics of beauty, none tend  to render our perceptions so vivid as variety and contrast.    I conclude this section with a few remarks on the errors which Alison has  committed on this subject.    \"In the rose,\" says that writer, \"and the white lily, and in the tribe of  flowering shrubs, the same bending form assumed by the stem is felt as a  defect; and instead of impressing us with the idea of delicacy, leads us  to believe the operation of some force to twist it into this  direction.\"--This, however, is no defect arising from the bending form not  being abstractly more beautiful, but from its being contrary to the nature  of the stem of flowering shrubs to bend, from its being, as he himself  observes, the result of some force to twist it.    He asserts, however, that in plants, angular forms are beautiful, when  they are expressive of fineness, of tenderness, of delicacy, or such  affecting qualities; and he thinks that this may perhaps appear from the  consideration of the following instances:--    \"The myrtle, for instance, is generally reckoned a beautiful form, yet the  growth of its stem is perpendicular, the junction of its branches form  regular and similar angles, and their direction is in straight or angular  lines. The known delicacy, however, and tenderness of the vegetable, at  least in this climate, prevail over the general expression of the form,  and give it the same beauty which we generally find in forms of a contrary  kind.\"--The mistake here committed is in supposing the beauty of the  myrtle to depend on its angularity, instead of its being evergreen,  fragrant, and suggesting pleasures of association.    \"How much more beautiful,\" he says, \"is the rose-tree when its buds begin  to blow, than afterward, when its flowers are full and in their greatest  perfection! yet, in this first situation, its form has much less winding  surface, and is much more composed of straight lines and of angles, than  afterward when the weight of the flower weighs down the feeble branches,  and describes the easiest and most varied curves.\"--But he answers himself  by adding: \"The circumstance of its youth, a circumstance in all cases so  affecting, the delicacy of its blossom, so well expressed by the care  which Nature has taken in surrounding the opening bud with leaves, prevail  so much upon our imagination, that we behold the form itself with more  delight in this situation than afterward, when it assumes the more general  form of delicacy.\"    \"There are few things in the vegetable world,\" he says, \"more beautiful  than the knotted and angular stem of the balsam, merely from its singular  transparency, which it is impossible to look at without a strong  impression of the fineness and delicacy of the vegetable.\"--But it is its  transparency, not its angularity, that is beautiful.    The beauty of color is not less conspicuous than that of form in this  class of beings.      SECTION III.    ELEMENTS OF BEAUTY IN THINKING BEINGS.    I have next to show that, in thinking beings, while the characters of  inanimate, and those of living beauty, are still more or less continued,  new characteristics are also added to them.    I. In animals, accordingly, the bones bear a close analogy to the wood of  plants. They generally assume the same rounded form; but, as thinking  beings are necessarily moving ones, their bones are hollow to combine  lightness with strength, and they are separated by joints to permit  flexion and extension.    II. As animals, like plants, grow and reproduce, a portion of their  general organization, their vascular system, which serves the purpose of  growth and reproduction, consists, like plants, of trunks, branches, &c.;  and the surface of their bodies, the skin, is formed by a tissue of these  vessels. Accordingly, both the vessels themselves, and the tissue which  they form, present the delicacy, the bending, the variety, and the  contrast, which are the characters of the preceding species of beauty.    The undulating and serpentine lines which art seeks always to design in  its most beautiful productions, exist in greater number at the surface of  the human body than at that of any other animal. Wherever, as Hogarth  observes, \"for the sake of the necessary motion of the parts, with proper  strength and agility, the insertions of the muscles are too hard and  sudden, their swellings too bold, or the hollows between them too deep,  for their outlines to be beautiful; nature softens these hardnesses, and  plumps up these vacancies with a proper supply of fat, and covers the  whole with the soft, smooth, springy, and, in delicate life, almost  transparent skin, which, conforming itself to the external shape of all  the parts beneath, expresses to the eye the idea of its contents with the  utmost delicacy of beauty and grace.\"    It is principally in the features of the face, as has often been observed,  and on the surface of the torso and of the members of a beautiful woman,  that these delicate, bending, varied, and contrasted lines are multiplied:  by their union, they mark the outlines of different parts, as in the  region of the neck, of the bosom, at the shoulders, on the surface of the  abdomen, on the sides, and principally in the gradual transitions from the  head to the neck, and from the loins to the inferior extremities.    These lines vary under different circumstances; much enbonpoint producing  round lines, and leanness or old age producing straight ones.    Woman and man stand pre-eminent among animals as to this kind of beauty;  and to them succeed the swifter animals, as the horse, the stag, &c.    The animals, on the contrary, of which the surface presents right lines  and square forms, are correspondingly deprived of beauty; as the toad, the  hog, and all the animals which seem to us ugly.    In all animals, also, the beauty of color, even when slightly varied,  becomes extremely interesting.--In human beauty, considerable variety is  produced by the different shades of the skin.    Such, indeed, is the variety resulting from all this, that some degree  even of intricacy is produced. The undulating lines which cross in every  direction, and the tortuous paths of the eye, are the means of an  agreeable complication.    Hence Burke, following Hogarth, says: \"Observe that part of a beautiful  woman where she is perhaps the most beautiful, about the neck and breasts:  the smoothness, the softness, the easy and insensible swell, the variety  of the surface, which is never for the smallest space the same, the  deceitful maze, through which the unsteady eye slides giddily, without  knowing where to fix, or whither it is carried. Is not this a  demonstration of that change of surface, continual, and yet hardly  perceptible at any point, which forms one of the great constituents of  beauty?    The hair affords an excellent instance of this agreeable complication.  Soft curls agitated by the wind have been the theme of every poet. And  yet, says Hogarth, \"to show how excess ought to be avoided in intricacy,  as well as in every other principle, the very same head of hair, wisped  and matted together, would make the most disagreeable figure; because the  eye would be perplexed, and at a fault, and unable to trace such a  confused number of uncomposed and entangled lines.\"    III. But animals have a higher system of organs and functions which  peculiarly distinguishes them, and which presents new and peculiar  characteristics of beauty. This consists of the organs by which they  receive impressions from, and react upon the objects around them--the  first organs which Nature presents having altogether external relations,  and the first, consequently, in which we look for fitness for any purpose.    The importance of fitness to the beauty of such objects is learned  imperceptibly. Lines and forms, though the most elegant, fail to please  us, if ill distributed in this respect: and objects, to a great extent  destitute of the other characters of natural beauty, become beautiful when  regarded in relation to fitness. Thus would this sense appear to be so  powerful, as in some measure to regulate our other perceptions of beauty.    It is fitness which leads us to admire in one animal, what would displease  us if found in another. \"The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35413"],[0,"A Review of the Middle American Tree Frogs of the Genus Ptychohyla (#17)"],[1,"8, 4 figures in                    text.
