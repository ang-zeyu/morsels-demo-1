So, then, they launched their grievous shafts upon one  another, and the cry of both armies as they shouted reached to starry  heaven; and they met together with a great battle-cry.    (ll. 687-712) Then Zeus no longer held back his might; but straight his  heart was filled with fury and he showed forth all his strength. From  Heaven and from Olympus he came forthwith, hurling his lightning: the  bolts flew thick and fast from his strong hand together with thunder  and lightning, whirling an awesome flame. The life-giving earth crashed  around in burning, and the vast wood crackled loud with fire all about.  All the land seethed, and Ocean's streams and the unfruitful sea. The  hot vapour lapped round the earthborn Titans: flame unspeakable rose  to the bright upper air: the flashing glare of the thunder-stone and  lightning blinded their eyes for all that there were strong. Astounding  heat seized Chaos: and to see with eyes and to hear the sound with ears  it seemed even as if Earth and wide Heaven above came together; for such  a mighty crash would have arisen if Earth were being hurled to ruin, and  Heaven from on high were hurling her down; so great a crash was there  while the gods were meeting together in strife. Also the winds brought  rumbling earthquake and duststorm, thunder and lightning and the  lurid thunderbolt, which are the shafts of great Zeus, and carried the  clangour and the warcry into the midst of the two hosts. An horrible  uproar of terrible strife arose: mighty deeds were shown and the  battle inclined. But until then, they kept at one another and fought  continually in cruel war.    (ll. 713-735) And amongst the foremost Cottus and Briareos and Gyes  insatiate for war raised fierce fighting: three hundred rocks, one upon  another, they launched from their strong hands and overshadowed the  Titans with their missiles, and buried them beneath the wide-pathed  earth, and bound them in bitter chains when they had conquered them by  their strength for all their great spirit, as far beneath the earth to  Tartarus. For a brazen anvil falling down from heaven nine nights and  days would reach the earth upon the tenth: and again, a brazen anvil  falling from earth nine nights and days would reach Tartarus upon the  tenth. Round it runs a fence of bronze, and night spreads in triple  line all about it like a neck-circlet, while above grow the roots of the  earth and unfruitful sea. There by the counsel of Zeus who drives the  clouds the Titan gods are hidden under misty gloom, in a dank place  where are the ends of the huge earth. And they may not go out; for  Poseidon fixed gates of bronze upon it, and a wall runs all round it  on every side. There Gyes and Cottus and great-souled Obriareus live,  trusty warders of Zeus who holds the aegis.    (ll. 736-744) And there, all in their order, are the sources and ends  of gloomy earth and misty Tartarus and the unfruitful sea and starry  heaven, loathsome and dank, which even the gods abhor.    It is a great gulf, and if once a man were within the gates, he would  not reach the floor until a whole year had reached its end, but cruel  blast upon blast would carry him this way and that. And this marvel is  awful even to the deathless gods.    (ll. 744-757) There stands the awful home of murky Night wrapped in  dark clouds. In front of it the son of Iapetus [1622] stands immovably  upholding the wide heaven upon his head and unwearying hands, where  Night and Day draw near and greet one another as they pass the great  threshold of bronze: and while the one is about to go down into the  house, the other comes out at the door.    And the house never holds them both within; but always one is without  the house passing over the earth, while the other stays at home  and waits until the time for her journeying come; and the one holds  all-seeing light for them on earth, but the other holds in her arms  Sleep the brother of Death, even evil Night, wrapped in a vaporous  cloud.    (ll. 758-766) And there the children of dark Night have their dwellings,  Sleep and Death, awful gods. The glowing Sun never looks upon them with  his beams, neither as he goes up into heaven, nor as he comes down from  heaven. And the former of them roams peacefully over the earth and the  sea's broad back and is kindly to men; but the other has a heart of  iron, and his spirit within him is pitiless as bronze: whomsoever of  men he has once seized he holds fast: and he is hateful even to the  deathless gods.    (ll. 767-774) There, in front, stand the echoing halls of the god of  the lower-world, strong Hades, and of awful Persephone. A fearful hound  guards the house in front, pitiless, and he has a cruel trick. On those  who go in he fawns with his tail and both his ears, but suffers them not  to go out back again, but keeps watch and devours whomsoever he catches  going out of the gates of strong Hades and awful Persephone.    (ll. 775-806) And there dwells the goddess loathed by the deathless  gods, terrible Styx, eldest daughter of back-flowing [1623] Ocean. She  lives apart from the gods in her glorious house vaulted over with great  rocks and propped up to heaven all round with silver pillars. Rarely  does the daughter of Thaumas, swift-footed Iris, come to her with a  message over the sea's wide back.    But when strife and quarrel arise among the deathless gods, and when any  of them who live in the house of Olympus lies, then Zeus sends Iris  to bring in a golden jug the great oath of the gods from far away, the  famous cold water which trickles down from a high and beetling rock. Far  under the wide-pathed earth a branch of Oceanus flows through the dark  night out of the holy stream, and a tenth part of his water is allotted  to her. With nine silver-swirling streams he winds about the earth and  the sea's wide back, and then falls into the main [1624]; but the tenth  flows out from a rock, a sore trouble to the gods. For whoever of the  deathless gods that hold the peaks of snowy Olympus pours a libation of  her water is forsworn, lies breathless until a full year is completed,  and never comes near to taste ambrosia and nectar, but lies spiritless  and voiceless on a strewn bed: and a heavy trance overshadows him. But  when he has spent a long year in his sickness, another penance and an  harder follows after the first. For nine years he is cut off from the  eternal gods and never joins their councils of their feasts, nine full  years. But in the tenth year he comes again to join the assemblies of  the deathless gods who live in the house of Olympus. Such an oath, then,  did the gods appoint the eternal and primaeval water of Styx to be: and  it spouts through a rugged place.    (ll. 807-819) And there, all in their order, are the sources and ends  of the dark earth and misty Tartarus and the unfruitful sea and starry  heaven, loathsome and dank, which even the gods abhor.    And there are shining gates and an immoveable threshold of bronze having  unending roots and it is grown of itself [1625]. And beyond, away from  all the gods, live the Titans, beyond gloomy Chaos. But the glorious  allies of loud-crashing Zeus have their dwelling upon Ocean's  foundations, even Cottus and Gyes; but Briareos, being goodly, the  deep-roaring Earth-Shaker made his son-in-law, giving him Cymopolea his  daughter to wed.    (ll. 820-868) But when Zeus had driven the Titans from heaven, huge  Earth bare her youngest child Typhoeus of the love of Tartarus, by the  aid of golden Aphrodite. Strength was with his hands in all that he did  and the feet of the strong god were untiring. From his shoulders grew  an hundred heads of a snake, a fearful dragon, with dark, flickering  tongues, and from under the brows of his eyes in his marvellous heads  flashed fire, and fire burned from his heads as he glared. And there  were voices in all his dreadful heads which uttered every kind of  sound unspeakable; for at one time they made sounds such that the gods  understood, but at another, the noise of a bull bellowing aloud in proud  ungovernable fury; and at another, the sound of a lion, relentless of  heart; and at another, sounds like whelps, wonderful to hear; and again,  at another, he would hiss, so that the high mountains re-echoed. And  truly a thing past help would have happened on that day, and he would  have come to reign over mortals and immortals, had not the father of men  and gods been quick to perceive it. But he thundered hard and mightily:  and the earth around resounded terribly and the wide heaven above, and  the sea and Ocean's streams and the nether parts of the earth. Great  Olympus reeled beneath the divine feet of the king as he arose and  earth groaned thereat. And through the two of them heat took hold on the  dark-blue sea, through the thunder and lightning, and through the fire  from the monster, and the scorching winds and blazing thunderbolt. The  whole earth seethed, and sky and sea: and the long waves raged along the  beaches round and about, at the rush of the deathless gods: and there  arose an endless shaking. Hades trembled where he rules over the dead  below, and the Titans under Tartarus who live with Cronos, because of  the unending clamour and the fearful strife. So when Zeus had raised  up his might and seized his arms, thunder and lightning and lurid  thunderbolt, he leaped from Olympus and struck him, and burned all the  marvellous heads of the monster about him. But when Zeus had conquered  him and lashed him with strokes, Typhoeus was hurled down, a maimed  wreck, so that the huge earth groaned. And flame shot forth from the  thunder-stricken lord in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34804"],[0,"Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religion as Illustrated (#17)"],[1,"chools, but they were opened only to the  children of the Incas and of the nobility. This is a genuine theocratic  trait. Garcilasso tells us naively that his ancestor the Inca Roca  (1200--1249) in founding public schools had no idea of allowing _the  people_ \"to get information, grow proud, and disturb the state.\"[54] The  instruction, which was given by the _amautas_ (sages), turned on the  history or traditions of the country, on the laws, and on religion. We  have said that writing was unknown. There were only the mnemonic Quipos,  pictures on linen representing great events, and some rudimentary  attempts at hieroglyphics which the Incas do not seem to have  encouraged. Indeed, there is reason to believe that the hieroglyphics  found graven on the rocks of Yonan are anterior to the Inca  supremacy;[55] and it is said that a certain _amauta_ who had attempted  to introduce a hieroglyphic alphabet, was burned to death for impiety at  the order of the Inca.[56]    The most remarkable results of the rule of the Incas are seen in the  material well-being which they secured to their people. All the  historians speak of the really extraordinary perfection to which  Peruvian agriculture had been carried, though the use of iron was quite  unknown. The solar religion fits perfectly with the habits of an  agricultural people, and the Incas thought it became them, as children  of the Sun, to encourage the cultivation of the soil. They ordered the  execution of great public works, such as supporting walls to prevent the  sloping ground from being washed away; irrigation canals, some of which  measured five hundred miles, and which were preserved with scrupulous  care; magazines of guano, the fertilizing virtues of which were known in  Peru long before they were learned in Europe.[57] The Spaniards are far  from having maintained Peruvian agriculture at the level it had reached  under the Incas. Splendid roads stretched from Cuzco towards the four  quarters of heaven; and Humboldt still traced some of them, paved with  black porphyry, or in other cases cemented or rather macadamized, and  often launched over ravines and pierced through hills with remarkable  boldness.[58] The Incas had established reservoirs of drinking water for  the public use from place to place along these roads, and likewise  pavilions for their own accommodation when they were traversing their  realms, on which occasions they never travelled more than three or four  leagues a day. Bridges were thrown across the rivers, sometimes built of  stone, but more often constructed on the method, so frequently  described, that consists in uniting the opposing banks by two parallel  ropes, along which a great basket is slung.[59] A system of royal  courier posts measured the great roads as in Mexico. There were many  important cities in Peru, and, according to a contemporary estimate  cited by Prescott, the capital, Cuzco, even without including its  suburbs, must have embraced at least two hundred thousand  inhabitants.[60] Architecture was in a developed stage. We shall have to  speak of the temples presently. The Inca's palaces--and there was at  least one in every city of any importance--were of imposing dimensions,  and a high degree of comfort and luxury was displayed within them. Gold  glittered on the walls and beneath the roofs which were generally  thatched with straw. They were provided with inner courts, spacious  halls, sculptures in abundance, but inferior, it would seem, to those of  Central America, and baths in which hot or cold water could be turned on  at will.[61] In a word, when we remember from how many resources the  Peruvians were still cut off by their ignorance and isolation, we cannot  but admit that a genuine civilization is opening before our eyes, the  defects of which must not blind us to its splendour. And since this  civilization was in great part due (we shall see the force of the  qualification presently) to the continuous efforts of the Incas, our  next task must be to ascend to the mythic origin of that family, which  we borrow from the narrative of their descendant, Garcilasso de la  Vega.[62]    Properly speaking, this narrative is the local myth of the Lake  Titicaca and of Cuzco, transformed into an imperial myth.    Before the Incas, we are told, men lived in the most absolute savagery.  They were addicted to cannibalism and offered human victims to gods who  were gross like themselves. At last the Sun took pity on them, and sent  them two of his children, Manco Capac and Mama Ogllo (or Oullo, Ocollo,  Oolle, &c.), to establish the worship of the Sun and alleviate their  lot. The two emissaries, son and daughter of the Sun and Moon, rose one  day from the depths of the Lake Titicaca. They had been told that a  golden splinter which they bore with them would pierce the earth at the  spot in which they were to establish themselves, and the augury was  fulfilled on the site of Cuzco, the name of which signifies _navel._[63]  Observe that, in classical antiquity, Babylon, Athens, Delphi, Paphos,  Jerusalem, and so forth, each passed for the navel of the earth. Manco  Capac and Mama Ogllo, then, established the worship of the Sun. They  taught the savage inhabitants of the place agriculture and the principal  trades, the art of building cities, roads and aqueducts. Mama Ogllo  taught the women to spin and weave. They appointed a number of overseers  to take care that every one did his duty; and when they had thus  regulated everything in Cuzco, they re-ascended to heaven. But they left  a son and daughter to continue their work. Like their parents, the  brother and sister became husband and wife, and from them descends the  sovereign family of the Incas, that is to say, the Lord-rulers, or  Master-rulers.    Such is the legend, from which the first deduction must be that the Inca  family has nothing in common with the other denizens of earth. It is  super-imposed, as it were, on humanity. It is because of this difference  of origin that the laws which restrain the rest of mankind are not  always applicable to the Incas. For example, they marry their sisters,  as Manco Capac did, and as the Sun does, for the Moon is at once his  wife and his sister. It is thus that they are enabled to preserve the  divine character of their unique family.    For ourselves, we can entertain no doubt that this is a cosmic myth.  Mama Ogllo, or \"the mother egg,\" and Manco Capac, or \"the mighty man,\"  are two creators. The myth indicates that there existed an ancient solar  priesthood on one of the islands or on the shores of the Lake of  Titicaca (at an early date the focus of a certain civilization), and  that this priestly family became at a given period the ruling power at  Cuzco. It was thence that it radiated over the small states which  surrounded Cuzco, embracing them one after another under its prestige  and its power, until it had become the redoubtable dynasty that we know  it. Manco Capac and Mama Ogllo, the creator and the cosmic egg, have  become the Sun and Moon, represented by their Inca high-priest and his  wife. There is no practice towards which a more wide-spread tendency  exists in America than that of conferring the name of a deity on his  chief priest. And if Garcilasso fixes the appearance of Manco Capac at  about 1000 A.D., it is simply because the historical recollections of  his family mounted no higher, and that about that time it began to rise  out of its obscurity. It had the advantage of numbering in its royal  line both successful warriors and, what is more, consummate  politicians, instances of whose ability we have already seen and shall  see again.    The point at which the legend preserved by Garcilasso is clearly at  fault, is in its claim for the Incas as the first and only civilizers of  Peru. We shall presently meet with other Peruvian myths of civilization  which do not stand in the least connection with Manco Capac and the  Incas. The kingdom of Quito, which the Inca Huayna Capac had recently  conquered when the Spaniards arrived, though not on the same level as  Peru proper, was far removed from the savage state, while as yet a  stranger to the influence of the Incas. The country of the Muyscas, the  present New Granada or land of Bogota, though standing in no connection  with Peru, was the theatre of another sacerdotal and solar religion _sui  generis_, which, though very little known, is highly interesting. The  valley of the Rimac, or Lima, and the coast lands in general, were  likewise centres of a pre-Inca civilization. The Chimus especially,  themselves dwellers on the coast, were possessed of an original  civilization differing from that of the Incas. They were the last to be  conquered. To sum up, everything leads us to suppose that various  centres of social development had long existed, up and down the whole  region, but that, under the presiding genius of the priesthood of Manco  Capac, the civilization of Cuzco had gradually acquired the  preponderance, till it consecutively eclipsed and absorbed all the  others.    Garcilasso labours hard to impress us with the belief that the  sovereigns of his family maintained an unbroken age of gold, by dint of  their wisdom and virtues. But we know, both from himself and from other  sources, that as a matter of fact the Incas' sky was not always  cloudless. They had numbered both bad and incapable rulers in their  line. More than once they had had to suppress terrible insurrections,  and their palaces had witnessed more than one tragedy.\"[64] But after  making all allowances, we must admit that they succeeded in governing  well, and more especially in maintaining intact their own religious and  political prestige.    Now this very cleverness, this conscious and often extremely deliberate  and astutely calculated policy, compels us to ask how far the Incas  themselves were sincere in their pretension to be descended from the  Sun, and their faith"]]]
