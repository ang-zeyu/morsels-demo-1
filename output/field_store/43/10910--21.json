Arriving at the rookeries somewhat later than the Adelies, they do not  lay their eggs until the beginning of December. Practically no nest is  made, a mere hollow being worked in the ground, in which the bird sits.  Frequently several hollows are made before the hen finally settles where  she will lay. The two eggs, which are brownish olive thickly and darkly  mottled with brown, are incubated for four weeks, after which the chicks  are hatched.    From the moment of their first appearance from the egg these chicks  exhibit the most extraordinary precocity. Covered with pale slaty-grey  down, they look anything but the pugnacious little animals they turn out  to be. Their one idea, besides feeding, seems to be to fight one  another, and they may be seen to roll about the nest, locked together,  fighting with beak and claw. They are fed from the ground, and may be  seen picking about among the stones like the little domestic chickens,  which they very much resemble. After a time invariably one of the chicks  disappears, and as dead youngsters are not to be found, they are  probably eaten by neighbours who have caught them wandering; in fact,  Mr. Ferrar, of Captain Scott's first expedition, actually saw a Skua  pick up a wandering chick of its own species and fly off with it,  followed by a screaming flock of its neighbours, who sought to rob it of  its prey.    In order to find out how many eggs a Skua would lay, I marked some  nests, and took the eggs as they were laid. In each case a second egg  was laid, but when this was taken no more appeared. In two nests I  removed the first egg as soon as it was laid, but left the second, which  was then sat upon by the parent, who was content with it, or unable to  lay a third.    When any of us approached their nests the old birds would fly round in  wide circles, making wild \"stoops\" at our heads each time they passed  over us, in the evident attempt to frighten us away. Occasionally they  would actually knock our heads with a wing, and nothing seeming to scare  them off, they would swoop past us time after time in a most  disconcerting manner. In order to keep them at a distance without having  to keep a constant look-out, when I was in the neighbourhood of their  nest, I used to walk about holding a ski-stick or the handle of my  ice-axe straight above me, and they would swoop at the top of this  instead of my head, which was infinitely preferable. One day when a high  wind was blowing on top of Cape Adare, I had my ice-axe knocked clean  out of my hand by one of the Skuas flying straight into the handle, the  heavy blow seeming to affect the bird but slightly.    There was a \"skuary\" on the screes, close to a thickly populated part of  the rookery, but the majority of these birds made their nests right at  the top of Cape Adare, from which point of vantage they surveyed the  entire rookery, and a very sharp look-out they kept too, for no sooner  did we start to flense a seal than a flock of them descended to gobble  at the lumps of blubber as we threw them on the ground. In this  occupation they exhibited the greatest jealousy, and when there was a  hundred times as much blubber on the ground as all the skuas possibly  could have eaten, they continually tried to drive each other away. When  fighting they rarely stayed on the ground, but leapt at one another into  the air, and one of the illustrations shows two Skuas in the act of  doing this. Their great spread of wing is well shown in this photograph.  (Fig. 71.)    When penguins' eggs were plentiful in the rookery the Skuas flew very  low over the ground, and as they passed over each colony of nests the  sitting birds would crouch low upon them, a very necessary precaution,  as I have described already in these pages the unerring way in which the  Skuas picked up the penguins' eggs when they were left uncovered. Broken  and empty shells strewed the ground in the vicinity of the Skuas' nests,  and it is probable that in a large rookery, such as that at Cape Adare,  thousands of eggs are destroyed by them annually.    The instinct of the thief is most strongly marked in the Skua tribe, and  I am afraid that the mere love of thieving alone actuates them on many  occasions. For instance, when I was skinning a seal one day near Cape  Evans I left a pair of field-glasses lying on a coat close by, and on  looking round saw a Skua in the act of making off with them, holding  them by the strap in his beak. A sudden yell caused the offender to drop  the glasses, fortunately when they were but a yard from the ground.  Again, when the crew of an Antarctic ship were engaged in blasting the  sea-ice which imprisoned it, a Skua flew off with one of the detonators  which had been left on the ice. I think the detonator contained  dynamite, but at any rate I am told that there was a stampede on the  part of the men to get away from under the bird as it flew overhead!    When, with two companions, I visited a skuary at the back of the penguin  rookery at Cape Royds, the Skuas circled over us in a way I have  described above, but instead of swooping at our heads, some of them  repeatedly dropped their guano on to us as they passed over, timing the  process with such surprising accuracy that I was hit once, and Commander  Campbell no less than three times. The following year when at Cape  Adare, I expected the same treatment from the Skuas there, but curiously  enough, these never did it. That one skuary should have adopted such  tactics and another not, is a very curious thing, but it may possibly be  that the Cape Royds Skuas discovered the trick during the stay of Sir  Ernest Shackleton's expedition, who had spent a year there quite  recently, and of the _Discovery_ expedition which spent two years at Hut  Point, but a few miles distant, whereas the only men who ever inhabited  Cape Adare wintered there some fifteen years before. But this is mere  speculation.      [Illustration: Fig. 71. \"Leapt at one another into the Air\" (Page 129)]      [Illustration: Fig. 72. A Skua by its Chick (Page 131)]    When one of the parent Skuas is on the ground near its nest, on the  approach of anyone it throws its head back, opens its wings, and loudly  proclaims its whereabouts with its raucous cawing notes. When hovering  over food, and at other times when not alarmed or angry, the sounds made  by a Skua are very like those of the common Herring Gull, and not  altogether unmusical at times, especially when making the little shrill  piping note, by which I have often thought that gulls so nearly imitate  the squeaking of a block in its sheaf.    When the penguin chicks are hatched, the Skuas prey upon these in a most  cruel manner, and should a chick wander away from the protecting old  birds, a Skua is almost certain to pounce upon and kill it. This it does  by pecking its eyes out, after which, with powerful strokes of its beak,  it gets to work on its back and quickly devours the kidneys.    The dead bodies of hundreds of chicks are seen strewn about the rookery,  and especially in the neighbourhood of the Skuas' nests, as very often  they carry them there. All these dead chicks are seen to have two holes  picked through their backs, one on each side, corresponding to the  position of each kidney.    Besides the penguins' eggs and young, there is another fruitful source  of food for the Skuas to be found along the Antarctic coasts at the  early part of the year, and that is during the time when the seals are  bringing forth their young upon the sea-ice. The Skuas attend upon them  then, and devour the after-births. In the second volume of the  _Discovery_ reports Dr. Wilson mentions that large numbers of Skuas were  noticed at Granite Harbour, and I have no doubt that they had  congregated there for this purpose, as when passing the spot on a spring  journey along the sea-ice in 1912, we saw many hundreds of Weddell seals  with their young. So many were there, that as we lay in our  sleeping-bags during the night, the bleating of the little calves near  our tents conveyed to our half-awakened senses the impression that we  were in the midst of lambing fields at home!                       *       *       *       *       *    The soft parts are coloured as follows:    _Bill_, black.    _Iris_, dark brown.    _Legs_, _toes_, and _webbs_, black, excepting a patch of bright blue  just above the tibio-metatarsal joint, in young fledglings.

Here we neither found our commander  nor any of the other ships of the fleet. We waited in this port for  two months and four days, and, seeing that there was no arrival, I and  my consort determined to explore the coast. We sailed onwards for 260  leagues until we reached a harbour where we agreed to build a fort. We  did so, and left twenty-four Christian men in it who were on board my  consort, being part of the crew of the _Capitana_ that was lost. We  were in that harbour five months, building the fort, and loading our  ships with brazil-wood. For we were not able to advance further, because  we had not full crews, and I wanted many necessaries. Having done all  this, we agreed to return to Portugal, which bore between north-east and  north. We left the twenty-four men in the fort, with provisions for six  months, twelve bombards, and many other arms. We had made friends with  all the natives round, of whom I have made no mention in this voyage,  not because we did not see and have intercourse with an infinite number  of tribes: for we went inland with thirty men, for a distance of 40  leagues, and saw so many things that I refrain from recounting them,  reserving them for my FOUR VOYAGES. This land is 18 deg. to the south of the  equinoctial line, and beyond the meridian of Lisbon 37 deg. further to the  west, according to what was shown by our instruments. All this being done,  we took leave of the Christians and of that land, and began our navigation  to the north-north-east, with the object of shaping a course for this  city of Lisbon. After seventy-seven days of many hardships and dangers  we entered this port on the 18th of June 1504. God be praised. Here we  were very well received, more so than anyone would believe. For all the  city had given us up, all the other ships of the fleet having been lost,  owing to the pride and folly of our commander.[132] May God reward him  for his pride!    At present I may be found in Lisbon, not knowing what the King may wish  to do with me, but I greatly desire rest.    The bearer of this is Benvenuto di Domenico Benvenuti, who will tell  your Magnificence of my condition, and of some things which I have left  out to avoid prolixity, for he has seen and heard, God knows, how much  of them. I have condensed the letter as much as possible, and to this  end have omitted many natural things, for which your Magnificence will  pardon me. I beseech you to include me in the number of your servants,  and I commend you to Ser Antonio Vespucci my brother, and to all my  house. I conclude praying God that He will prolong your life, and that  He will favour the state of that exalted Republic and the honour of  your Magnificence.

After his departure, I spoke with Amerigo Vespucci, the bearer of this  letter, who is going to the Court on matters relating to navigation.  He always showed a desire to please me, and is a very respectable man.  Fortune has been adverse to him, as to many others. His labours have  not been so profitable to him as he might have expected. He leaves me  with the desire to do me service, if it should be in his power. I am  unable here to point out in what way he could be useful to me, because  I do not know what may be required at Court; but he goes with the  determination of doing all he can for me. You will see in what way he  can be employed. Think the matter over, as he will do everything, and  speak, and put things in train; but let all be done secretly, so as not  to arouse suspicion of him. I have told him all I can about my affairs,  and of the payments that have been made to me and are due. This letter  is also for the Adelantado, for he can see in what way use can be made  of it, and will apprise you of it, etc., etc.    Dated in Seville, the 5th of February (1505).

They  live, for the most part, very miserably on fish, and go naked. Thence  they went back with some of these Indians, and went along the coast of  the said land for 600 leagues, where they met an Indian canoe, which is  carved out of one piece of wood. It had a sail, and went to the mainland  with eighty men, with many bows, and targets of a very light but strong  wood. They went to the mainland to take Indians who live there, who do  not serve them as slaves, but are eaten by them like deer, rabbits, and  other animals. Our people took these Indians. Their bows are made of  ebony and their arrows have corals made of the nerves of snakes. Having  taken this canoe, they returned to the said island, where there came  against them a great number of Indians, with bows and arrows in their  hands. They defeated these natives and explored the island, which they  found very sterile. At noon they came to a plain, which was so covered  with serpents and snakes and dragons, that it was marvellous. They kept  one, as it seemed to them to be a very wonderful thing. This dragon was  larger than a _cachalote_.[137]    The island is intersected by a mountain, one part to the north the other  to the south. The north side is inhabited by these Indians, the other  side by those poisonous animals. They say that none of these serpents  ever pass to the inhabited part, and in the whole of that side there  are no serpents, nor any similar animals. Having seen this, the said  ships departed, and took away seven Indians of that land, good sailors,  and coasted along the coast to a place called Alseshij, and thence for  400 leagues to the westward, when they came to a land where they found  many houses, out of which came many Indians to receive them and do them  honour, and they say that one of these had previously predicted that  certain ships of a great king, to them unknown, would come from the  east and make them all slaves, and that all the strangers were gifted  with life eternal, and that their persons would be adorned with various  dresses. They say that when their king saw our ships he said: \"Behold,  here are the ships that I told you of ten years ago.\" This king came  with a breast-plate of massive gold on his breast and a chain of gold,  and a mask of gold with four golden bells of a mark each at his feet;  and with him came twenty Indians, all with gold masks on their faces,  beating golden kettle-drums, each weighing thirty marks. When they  saw the islanders with the Spaniards they began to be disdainful, and  to fight fiercely with our people with poisoned arrows. They numbered  5,000, and 140 of our men had landed. They fell to and cut to pieces  nearly 700 natives, one of ours being killed by an arrow. They came to  the houses, and took those masks and bells, and arms of the said king,  and 800 marks of gold. They set fire to the houses, and were there  ninety-six days, because the three ships that remained were sunk and went  to the bottom. Seeing this, they took out the provisions and stores,  and fortified themselves on shore with a very good tower. Every day  they fought with the Indians. At night they were within their enclosure,  and in the day they went out in order, and as much as they marched, so  much they acquired. But they did not dare to go out of their quarters.  One day they went to a lake, and began to wash the earth with certain  _vernicali_,[138] each one in half an hour getting six, seven, or eight  _castellanos_ of gold. They were told by some of the Indian prisoners  that they need not tire themselves with washing, for that from there to  a very high mountain the distance was half a league, and that in a plain  near there was a river, where it is not necessary to wash much, for each  man in a day can gather ten marks of gold with little trouble. At length,  as lost men, without hope of returning home, they repaired the ships and  boats that were run up on the beach, eventually determining to return to  Spain. During the time of ninety-six days that they were there several  died from sickness, and there were forty-four survivors who were saved  with the help of God. They left ten men in the tower, supplied with  provisions and stores for a year, who were attacked three times by  Indians with their canoes, but were always victorious, and have come  safely here to the Court. I have seen all that gold and various things  that they have brought back; another kind of pepper, but larger than  ours, and nuts like nutmegs. They have also brought seventy pearls, all  good green ones, and some of ten and twelve carats, "]]]
