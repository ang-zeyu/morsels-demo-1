But Sir William Jones deciding  against him, he acquiesced, confirmed the political rights of West  Jersey by a separate grant, and withdrew any authority Andros claimed  over East Jersey. The trouble, however, did not end here. Both the  Jerseys were long afflicted by domineering attempts from New York.    Penn and his fellow trustees now prepared a constitution, or  \"Concessions and Agreements,\" as they called it, for West Jersey, the  first Quaker political constitution embodying their advanced ideas,  establishing religious liberty, universal suffrage, and voting by  ballot, and abolishing imprisonment for debt. It foreshadowed some of  the ideas subsequently included in the Pennsylvania constitution. All  these experiences were an excellent school for William Penn. He learned  the importance in starting a colony of having a carefully and maturely  considered system of government. In his preparations some years  afterwards for establishing Pennsylvania he avoided much of the bungling  of the West Jersey enterprise.    A better organized attempt was now made to establish a foothold in West  Jersey farther up the river than Fenwick's colony at Salem. In 1677 the  ship Kent took out some 230 rather well-to-do Quakers, about as fine a  company of broadbrims, it is said, as ever entered the Delaware. Some  were from Yorkshire and London, largely creditors of Byllinge, who  were taking land to satisfy their debts. They all went up the river to  Raccoon Creek on the Jersey side, about fifteen miles below the present  site of Philadelphia, and lived at first among the Swedes, who had  been in that part of Jersey for some years and who took care of the new  arrivals in their barns and sheds. These Quaker immigrants, however,  soon began to take care of themselves, and the weather during the winter  proving mild, they explored farther up the river in a small boat. They  bought from the Indians the land along the river shore from Oldman's  Creek all the way up to Trenton and made their first settlements on the  river about eighteen miles above the site of Philadelphia, at a  place they at first called New Beverly, then Bridlington, and finally  Burlington.    They may have chosen this spot partly because there had been an old  Dutch settlement of a few families there. It had long been a crossing of  the Delaware for the few persons who passed by land from New York or New  England to Maryland and Virginia. One of the Dutchmen, Peter Yegon, kept  a ferry and a house for entertaining travelers. George Fox, who crossed  there in 1671, describes the place as having been plundered by the  Indians and deserted. He and his party swam their horses across the  river and got some of the Indians to help them with canoes.    Other Quaker immigrants followed, going to Salem as well as to  Burlington, and a stretch of some fifty miles of the river shore became  strongly Quaker. There are not many American towns now to be found with  more of the old-time picturesqueness and more relics of the past than  Salem and Burlington.    Settlements were also started on the river opposite the site afterwards  occupied by Philadelphia, at Newton on the creek still called by that  name; and another a little above on Cooper's Creek, known as Cooper's  Ferry until 1794. Since then it has become the flourishing town of  Camden, full of shipbuilding and manufacturing, but for long after the  Revolution it was merely a small village on the Jersey shore opposite  Philadelphia, sometimes used as a hunting ground and a place of resort  for duelers and dancing parties from Philadelphia.    The Newton settlers were Quakers of the English middle class, weavers,  tanners, carpenters, bricklayers, chandlers, blacksmiths, coopers,  bakers, haberdashers, hatters, and linen drapers, most of them possessed  of property in England and bringing good supplies with them. Like all  the rest of the New Jersey settlers they were in no sense adventurers,  gold seekers, cavaliers, or desperadoes. They were well-to-do middle  class English tradespeople who would never have thought of leaving  England if they had not lost faith in the stability of civil and  religious liberty and the security of their property under the Stuart  Kings. With them came servants, as they were called; that is, persons of  no property, who agreed to work for a certain time in payment of their  passage, to escape from England. All, indeed, were escaping from England  before their estates melted away in fines and confiscations or their  health or lives ended in the damp, foul air of the crowded prisons. Many  of those who came had been in jail and had decided that they would not  risk imprisonment a second time. Indeed, the proportion of West Jersey  immigrants who had actually been in prison for holding or attending  Quaker meetings or refusing to pay tithes for the support of the  established church was large. For example, William Bates, a carpenter,  while in jail for his religion, made arrangements with his friends  to escape to West Jersey as soon as he should be released, and his  descendants are now scattered over the United States. Robert Turner, a  man of means, who settled finally in Philadelphia but also owned much  land near Newton in West Jersey, had been imprisoned in England in 1660,  again in 1662, again in 1665, and some of his property had been taken,  again imprisoned in 1669 and more property taken; and many others had  the same experience. Details such as these make us realize the situation  from which the Quakers sought to escape. So widespread was the Quaker  movement in England and so severe the punishment imposed in order to  suppress it that fifteen thousand families are said to have been ruined  by the fines, confiscations, and imprisonments.    Not a few Jersey Quakers were from Ireland, whither they had fled  because there the laws against them were less rigorously administered.  The Newton settlers were joined by Quakers from Long Island, where,  under the English law as administered by the New York governors, they  had also been fined and imprisoned, though with less severity than at  home, for nonconformity to the Church of England. On arriving, the West  Jersey settlers suffered some hardships during the year that must elapse  before a crop could be raised and a log cabin or house built. During  that period they usually lived, in the Indian manner, in wigwams of  poles covered with bark, or in caves protected with logs in the steep  banks of the creeks. Many of them lived in the villages of the Indians.  The Indians supplied them all with corn and venison, and without this  Indian help, they would have run serious risk of starving, for they were  not accustomed to hunting. They had also to thank the Indians for having  in past ages removed so much of the heavy forest growth from the wide  strip of land along the river that it was easy to start cultivation.    These Quaker settlers made a point of dealing very justly with the  Indians and the two races lived side by side for several generations.  There is an instance recorded of the Indians attending with much  solemnity the funeral of a prominent Quaker woman, Esther Spicer, for  whom they had acquired great respect. The funeral was held at night,  and the Indians in canoes, the white men in boats, passed down Cooper's  Creek and along the river to Newton Creek where the graveyard was,  lighting the darkness with innumerable torches, a strange scene to think  of now as having been once enacted in front of the bustling cities of  Camden and Philadelphia. Some of the young settlers took Indian wives,  and that strain of native blood is said to show itself in the features  of several families to this day.    Many letters of these settlers have been preserved, all expressing the  greatest enthusiasm for the new country, for the splendid river better  than the Thames, the good climate, and their improved health, the  immense relief to be away from the constant dread of fines and  punishment, the chance to rise in the world, with large rewards for  industry. They note the immense quantities of game, the Indians bringing  in fat bucks every day, the venison better than in England, the streams  full of fish, the abundance of wild fruits, cranberries, hurtleberries,  the rapid increase of cattle, and the good soil. A few details  concerning some of the interesting characters among these early colonial  Quakers have been rescued from oblivion. There is, for instance, the  pleasing picture of a young man and his sister, convinced Quakers,  coming out together and pioneering in their log cabin until each found a  partner for life. There was John Haddon, from whom Haddonfield is named,  who bought a large tract of land but remained in England, while his  daughter Elizabeth came out alone to look after it. A strong, decisive  character she was, and women of that sort have always been encouraged in  independent action by the Quakers. She proved to be an excellent manager  of an estate. The romance of her marriage to a young Quaker preacher,  Estaugh, has been celebrated in Mrs. Maria Child's novel \"The Youthful  Emigrant.\" The pair became leading citizens devoted to good works and to  Quaker liberalism for many a year in Haddonfield.    It was the ship Shields of Hull, bringing Quaker immigrants to  Burlington, of which the story is told that in beating up the river  she tacked close to the rather high bank with deep water frontage where  Philadelphia was afterwards established; and some of the passengers  remarked that it was a fine site for a town. The Shields, it is said,  was the first ship to sail up as far as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3050"],[0,"Notes of a War Correspondent (#17)"],[1,"  the Tugela River.    Six hours before, at Frere Station, the station-master had awakened us to  say that Ladysmith would be relieved at any moment.  This had but just  come over the wire.  It was \"official.\"  Indeed, he added, with local  pride, that the village band was still awake and in readiness to  celebrate the imminent event.  He found, I fear, an unsympathetic  audience.  The train was carrying philanthropic gentlemen in charge of  stores of champagne and marmalade for the besieged city.  They did not  want it to be relieved until they were there to substitute _pate de foie  gras_ for horseflesh.  And there were officers, too, who wanted a \"look  in,\" and who had been kept waiting at Cape Town for commissions,  gladdening the guests of the Mount Nelson Hotel the while with their new  khaki and gaiters, and there were Tommies who wanted \"Relief of  Ladysmith\" on the claps of their medals, as they had seen \"Relief of  Lucknow\" on the medals of the Chelsea pensioners.  And there was a  correspondent who had journeyed 15,000 miles to see Ladysmith relieved,  and who was apparently going to miss that sight, after five weeks of  travel, by a margin of five hours.    We all growled \"That's good,\" as we had done for the last two weeks every  time we had heard it was relieved, but our tone was not enthusiastic.  And when the captain of the Natal Carbineers said, \"I am afraid the good  news is too premature,\" we all said, hopefully, we were afraid it was.    We had seen nothing yet that was like real war.  That night at  Pietermaritzburg the officers at the hotel were in mess-jackets, the  officers' wives in dinner-gowns.  It was like Shepheard's Hotel, at the  top of the season.  But only six hours after that dinner, as we looked  out of the car-windows, we saw galloping across the high grass, like men  who had lost their way, and silhouetted black against the red sunrise,  countless horsemen scouting ahead of our train, and guarding it against  the fate of the armored one lying wrecked at Chieveley.  The darkness was  still heavy on the land and the only lights were the red eyes of the  armored train creeping in advance of ours, and the red sun, which showed  our silent escort appearing suddenly against the sky-line on a ridge, or  galloping toward us through the dew to order us, with a wave of the hand,  to greater speed.  One hour after sunrise the train drew up at Colenso,  and from only a mile away we heard the heavy thud of the naval guns, the  hammering of the Boer \"pom-poms,\" and the Maxims and Colt automatics  spanking the air.  We smiled at each other guiltily.  We were on time.  It was most evident that Ladysmith had not been relieved.    This was the twelfth day of a battle that Buller's column was waging  against the Boers and their mountain ranges, or \"disarranges,\" as some  one described them, without having gained more than three miles of  hostile territory.  He had tried to force his way through them six times,  and had been repulsed six times.  And now he was to try it again.    No map, nor photograph, nor written description can give an idea of the  country which lay between Buller and his goal.  It was an eruption of  high hills, linked together at every point without order or sequence.  In  most countries mountains and hills follow some natural law.  The  Cordilleras can be traced from the Amazon River to Guatemala City; they  make the water-shed of two continents; the Great Divide forms the  backbone of the States, but these Natal hills have no lineal descent.  They are illegitimate children of no line, abandoned broadcast over the  country, with no family likeness and no home.  They stand alone, or  shoulder to shoulder, or at right angles, or at a tangent, or join hands  across a valley.  They never appear the same; some run to a sharp point,  some stretch out, forming a table-land, others are gigantic ant-hills,  others perfect and accurately modelled ramparts.  In a ride of half a  mile, every hill completely loses its original aspect and character.    They hide each other, or disguise each other.  Each can be enfiladed by  the other, and not one gives up the secret of its strategic value until  its crest has been carried by the bayonet.  To add to this confusion, the  river Tugela has selected the hills around Ladysmith as occupying the  country through which it will endeavor to throw off its pursuers.  It  darts through them as though striving to escape, it doubles on its  tracks, it sinks out of sight between them, and in the open plain rises  to the dignity of water-falls.  It runs uphill, and remains motionless on  an incline, and on the level ground twists and turns so frequently that  when one says he has crossed the Tugela, he means he has crossed it once  at a drift, once at the wrecked railroad bridge, and once over a pontoon.  And then he is not sure that he is not still on the same side from which  he started.    Some of these hills are green, but the greater part are a yellow or dark  red, against which at two hundred yards a man in khaki is  indistinguishable from the rocks around him.  Indeed, the khaki is the  English soldier's sole protection.  It saves him in spite of himself, for  he apparently cannot learn to advance under cover, and a sky-line is the  one place where he selects to stand erect and stretch his weary limbs.  I  have come to within a hundred yards of a hill before I saw that scattered  among its red and yellow bowlders was the better part of a regiment as  closely packed together as the crowd on the bleaching boards at a  base-ball match.    Into this maze and confusion of nature's fortifications Buller's column  has been twisting and turning, marching and countermarching, capturing  one position after another, to find it was enfiladed from many hills, and  abandoning it, only to retake it a week later.  The greater part of the  column has abandoned its tents and is bivouacking in the open.  It is a  wonderful and impressive sight.  At the first view, an army in being,  when it is spread out as it is in the Tugela basin back of the hills,  seems a hopelessly and irrevocably entangled mob.    An army in the field is not regiments of armed men, marching with a gun  on shoulder, or crouching behind trenches.  That is the least, even if it  seems the most, important part of it.  Before one reaches the firing-line  he must pass villages of men, camps of men, bivouacs of men, who are  feeding, mending, repairing, and burying the men at the \"front.\"  It is  these latter that make the mob of gypsies, which is apparently without  head or order or organization.  They stretched across the great basin of  the Tugela, like the children of Israel, their camp-fires rising to the  sky at night like the reflection of great search-lights; by day they  swarmed across the plain, like hundreds of moving circus-vans in every  direction, with as little obvious intention as herds of buffalo.  But  each had his appointed work, and each was utterly indifferent to the  battle going forward a mile away.  Hundreds of teams, of sixteen oxen  each, crawled like great black water-snakes across the drifts, the Kaffir  drivers, naked and black, lashing them with whips as long as lariats,  shrieking, beseeching, and howling, and falling upon the oxen's horns to  drag them into place.    Mules from Spain and Texas, loaded with ammunition, kicked and plunged,  more oxen drew more soberly the great naval guns, which lurched as though  in a heavy sea, throwing the blue-jackets who hung upon the drag-ropes  from one high side of the trail to the other.  Across the plain, and  making toward the trail, wagons loaded with fodder, with rations, with  camp equipment, with tents and cooking-stoves, crowded each other as  closely as cable-cars on Broadway.  Scattered among them were fixed lines  of tethered horses, rows of dog-tents, camps of Kaffirs, hospital  stations with the Red Cross waving from the nearest and highest tree.  Dripping water-carts with as many spigots as the regiment had companies,  howitzer guns guided by as many ropes as a May-pole, crowded past these  to the trail, or gave way to the ambulances filled with men half dressed  and bound in the zinc-blue bandages that made the color detestable  forever after.  Troops of the irregular horse gallop through this  multitude, with a jangling of spurs and sling-belts; and Tommies, in  close order, fight their way among the oxen, or help pull them to one  side as the stretchers pass, each with its burden, each with its blue  bandage stained a dark brownish crimson.  It is only when the figure on  the stretcher lies under a blanket that the tumult and push and  sweltering mass comes to a quick pause, while the dead man's comrade  stands at attention, and the officer raises his fingers to his helmet.  Then the mass surges on again, with cracking of whips and shouts and  imprecations, while the yellow dust rises in thick clouds and buries the  picture in a glaring fog.  This moving, struggling mass, that fights for  the right of way along the road, is within easy distance of the shells.  Those from their own guns pass over them with a shrill crescendo, those  from the enemy burst among them at rare intervals, or sink impotently in  the soft soil.  And a dozen Tommies rush to dig them out as keepsakes.  Up at the front, brown and yellow regiments are lying crouched behind  brown and yellow rocks and stones.  As far as you can see, the hills are  sown with them.  With a glass you distinguish them against the sky-line  of every hill, for over three miles away.  Sometimes the men rise and  fire, and there is a feverish flutter of musketry; sometimes they lie  motionless for hours while the guns make the ways straight.    Any one who has seen Epsom Downs on a Derby day, with its thousands of  vans and tents and lines of horses and moving mobs, can form some idea of  what it is like.  But while at the Derby all is interest and excitement,"]]]
