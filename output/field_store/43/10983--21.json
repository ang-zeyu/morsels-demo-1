First there was  the kind, sympathetic friendliness of his hosts; and then the strong  suggestion they had given him that their food would agree with him.  Then there was very happy and interesting talk during the whole time  that they were at table and afterward. Mr.. Booth ate a hearty  dinner and, true to the words of his host and hostess, not one  single thing disagreed with him. And yet at that dinner, although  care had been taken to have it wholesome, there were served things  that under other conditions would have disagreed.    While we should aim always to eat wholesome food, it is really not  so much the food which makes the trouble as the attitude we take  toward it and the way we test it.    All the contractions which are made by our fussing about food  interfere with our circulation; the interference with our  circulation makes us liable to take cold, and it is safe to say that  more than half the colds that women have are caused principally by  wrong eating. Somewhat akin to grandmother's looking for her  spectacles when all the time they are pushed to the top of her head  is the way women fuss about their eating and then wonder why it is  that they cannot seem to stand drafts.    There is no doubt but that our food should be thoroughly masticated  before it goes into our stomachs. There is no doubt but that the  first process of digestion should be in our mouths. The relish which  we get for our food by masticating it properly is greater and also  helps toward digesting it truly. All this cannot be over-emphasized  if it is taken in the right way. But there is an extreme which  perhaps has not been thought of and for which happily I have an  example that will illustrate what I want to prove. I know a woman  who was, so to speak, daft on the subject of health. She attended to  all points of health with such minute detail that she seemed to have  lost all idea of why we should be healthy. One of her ways of  over-emphasizing the road to health was a very careful mastication  of her food. She chewed and chewed and chewed and chewed, and the  result was that she so strained her stomach with her chewing that  she brought on severe indigestion, simply as a result of an  overactive effort toward digestion. This was certainly a case of  \"vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself, and falls on the other.\"  And it was not unique.    The over-emphasis of \"What shall I eat? How much shall I eat? How  often shall I eat? When shall I eat? How shall I eat?\"--all extreme  attention to these questions is just as liable to bring chronic  indigestion as a reckless neglect of them altogether is liable to  upset a good, strong stomach and keep it upset. The woman who chewed  herself into indigestion fussed herself into it, too, by constantly  talking about what was not healthful to eat. Her breakfast, which  she took alone, was for a time the dryest-looking meal I ever saw.  It was enough to take away any one's healthy relish just to look at  it, if he was not forewarned.    Now our relish is one of our most blessed gifts. When we relish our  food our stomachs can digest it wholesomely. When we do not our  stomachs will not produce the secretions necessary to the most  wholesome digestion. Constant fussing about our food takes away our  relish. A gluttonous dwelling upon our food takes away our relish.  Relish is a delicate gift, and as we respect it truly, as we do not  degrade it to selfish ends nor kill it with selfish fastidiousness,  it grows upon us and is in its place like any other fine perception,  and is as greatly useful to the health of our bodies as our keener  and deeper perceptions are useful to the health of our minds.    Then there is the question of being sure that our stomachs are well  rested before we give them any work to do, and being sure that we  are quiet enough after eating to give our stomachs the best  opportunity to begin their work. Here again one extreme is just as  harmful as the other. I knew a woman who had what might be called  the fixed idea of health, who always used to sit bolt upright in a  high-backed chair for half an hour after dinner, and refuse to speak  or to be spoken to in order that \"digestion might start in  properly.\" If I had been her stomach I should have said: \"Madam,  when you have got through giving me your especial attention I will  begin my work--which, by the way, is not your work but mine!\" And,  virtually, that is what her stomach did say. Sitting bolt upright  and consciously waiting for your food to begin digestion is an  over-attention to what is none of your business, which contracts  your brain, contracts your stomach and stops its work.    Our business is only to fulfill the conditions rightly. The French  workmen do that when they sit quietly after a meal talking of their  various interests. Any one can fulfill the conditions properly by  keeping a little quiet, having some pleasant chat, reading a bright  story or taking life easy in any quiet way for half an hour. Or, if  work must begin directly after eating, begin it quietly. But this  feeling that it is our business to attend to the working functions  of our stomachs is officious and harmful. We must fulfill the  conditions and then forget our stomachs. If our stomachs remind us  of themselves by some misbehavior we must seek for the cause and  remedy it, but we should not on any account feel that the cause is  necessarily in the food we have eaten. It may be, and probably often  is, entirely back of that. A quick, sharp resistance to something  that is said will often cause indigestion. In that case we must stop  resisting and not blame the food. A dog was once made to swallow a  little bullet with his food and then an X-ray was thrown on to his  stomach in order that the process of digestion might be watched by  means of the bullet. When the dog was made angry the bullet stopped,  which meant that the digestion stopped; when the dog was  over-excited in any way digestion stopped. When he was calmed down  it went on again.    There are many reasons why we should learn to meet life without  useless resistance, and the health of our stomachs is not the least.    It would surprise most people if they could know how much  unnecessary strain they put on their stomachs by eating too much. A  nervous invalid had a very large appetite. She was helped twice,  sometimes three times, to meat and vegetables at dinner. She thought  that what she deemed her very healthy appetite was a great blessing  to her, and often remarked upon it, as also upon her idea that so  much good, nourishing food must be helping to make her well. And yet  she wondered why she did not gain faster.    Now the truth of the matter was that this invalid had a nervous  appetite. Not only did she not need one third of the food she ate,  but indeed the other two thirds was doing her positive harm. The tax  which she put upon her stomach to digest so much food drained her  nerves every day, and of course robbed her brain, so that she ate  and ate and wept and wept with nervous depression. When it was  suggested to her by a friend who understood nerves that she would  get better very much faster if she would eat very much less she made  a rule to take only one helping of anything, no matter how much she  might feel that she wanted another. Very soon she began to gain  enough to see for herself that she had been keeping herself ill with  overeating, and it was not many days before she did not want a  second helping.    Nervous appetites are not uncommon even among women who consider  themselves pretty well. Probably there are not five in a hundred  among all the well-fed men and women in this country who would not  be more healthy if they ate less.    Then there are food notions to be looked out for and out of which  any one can relax by giving a little intelligent attention to the  task.    \"I do not like eggs. I am tired of them.\" \"Dear, dear me! I ate so  much ice cream that it made me ill, and it has made me ill to think  of it ever since.\"    Relax, drop the contraction, pretend you had never tasted ice cream  before, and try to eat a little--not for the sake of the ice cream,  but for the sake of getting that knot out of your stomach.    \"But,\" you will say, \"can every one eat everything?\"    \"Yes,\" the answer is, \"everything that is really good, wholesome  food is all right for anybody to eat.\"    But you say: \"Won't you allow for difference of tastes?\"    And the answer to that is: \"Of course we can like some foods more  than others, but there is a radical difference between unprejudiced  preferences and prejudiced dislikes.\"    Our stomachs are all right if we will but fulfill their most simple  conditions and then leave them alone. If we treat them right they  will tell us what is good for them and what is not good for them,  and if we will only pay attention, obey them as a matter of course  without comment and then forget them, there need be no more fuss  about food and very much less nervous irritability.          CHAPTER XVII    _Take Care of Your Stomach_      WE all know that we have a great deal to do. Some of us have to work  all day to earn our bread and butter and then work a good part of  the night to make our clothes. Some of us have to stand all day  behind a counter. Some of us have to sit all day and sew for others,  and all night to sew for ourselves and our children. Most of us have  to do work that is necessary or work that is self-imposed. Many of  us feel busy without really being busy at all. But how many of us  realize that while we are doing work outside, our bodies themselves  have good, steady work to do inside.    Our lungs have to take oxygen from the air and give it to our blood;  our blood has to carry it all through our bodies and take away the  waste by means of the steady pumping of our hearts. Our stomachs  must digest the food put"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4341"],[0,"Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (#17)"],[1,"other, and only  prevented from so doing by the intervention of some authority.    Hobbes took that position; and while some of his eighteenth-century  followers endeavoured to prove that at no epoch of its existence--not  even in its most primitive condition--mankind lived in a state of  perpetual warfare; that men have been sociable even in \"the state of  nature,\" and that want of knowledge, rather than the natural bad  inclinations of man, brought humanity to all the horrors of its early  historical life,--his idea was, on the contrary, that the so-called  \"state of nature\" was nothing but a permanent fight between individuals,  accidentally huddled together by the mere caprice of their bestial  existence. True, that science has made some progress since Hobbes's  time, and that we have safer ground to stand upon than the speculations  of Hobbes or Rousseau. But the Hobbesian philosophy has plenty of  admirers still; and we have had of late quite a school of writers who,  taking possession of Darwin's terminology rather than of his leading  ideas, made of it an argument in favour of Hobbes's views upon primitive  man, and even succeeded in giving them a scientific appearance. Huxley,  as is known, took the lead of that school, and in a paper written in  1888 he represented primitive men as a sort of tigers or lions, deprived  of all ethical conceptions, fighting out the struggle for existence to  its bitter end, and living a life of \"continual free fight\"; to quote  his own words--\"beyond the limited and, temporary relations of the  family, the Hobbesian war of each against all was the normal state of  existence.\"(1)    It has been remarked more than once that the chief error of Hobbes, and  the eighteenth-century philosophers as well, was to imagine that mankind  began its life in the shape of small straggling families, something like  the \"limited and temporary\" families of the bigger carnivores, while in  reality it is now positively known that such was not the case. Of  course, we have no direct evidence as to the modes of life of the first  man-like beings. We are not yet settled even as to the time of their  first appearance, geologists being inclined at present to see their  traces in the pliocene, or even the miocene, deposits of the Tertiary  period. But we have the indirect method which permits us to throw some  light even upon that remote antiquity. A most careful investigation into  the social institutions of the lowest races has been carried on during  the last forty years, and it has revealed among the present institutions  of primitive folk some traces of still older institutions which have  long disappeared, but nevertheless left unmistakable traces of their  previous existence. A whole science devoted to the embryology of human  institutions has thus developed in the hands of Bachofen, MacLennan,  Morgan, Edwin Tylor, Maine, Post, Kovalevsky, Lubbock, and many others.  And that science has established beyond any doubt that mankind did not  begin its life in the shape of small isolated families.    Far from being a primitive form of organization, the family is a very  late product of human evolution. As far as we can go back in the  palaeo-ethnology of mankind, we find men living in societies--in tribes  similar to those of the highest mammals; and an extremely slow and long  evolution was required to bring these societies to the gentile, or clan  organization, which, in its turn, had to undergo another, also very long  evolution, before the first germs of family, polygamous or monogamous,  could appear. Societies, bands, or tribes--not families--were thus the  primitive form of organization of mankind and its earliest ancestors.  That is what ethnology has come to after its painstaking researches. And  in so doing it simply came to what might have been foreseen by the  zoologist. None of the higher mammals, save a few carnivores and a few  undoubtedly-decaying species of apes (orang-outans and gorillas), live  in small families, isolatedly straggling in the woods. All others live  in societies. And Darwin so well understood that isolately-living apes  never could have developed into man-like beings, that he was inclined to  consider man as descended from some comparatively weak but social  species, like the chimpanzee, rather than from some stronger but  unsociable species, like the gorilla.(2) Zoology and palaeo-ethnology  are thus agreed in considering that the band, not the family, was the  earliest form of social life. The first human societies simply were a  further development of those societies which constitute the very essence  of life of the higher animals.(3)    If we now go over to positive evidence, we see that the earliest traces  of man, dating from the glacial or the early post-glacial period, afford  unmistakable proofs of man having lived even then in societies. Isolated  finds of stone implements, even from the old stone age, are very rare;  on the contrary, wherever one flint implement is discovered others are  sure to be found, in most cases in very large quantities. At a time when  men were dwelling in caves, or under occasionally protruding rocks, in  company with mammals now extinct, and hardly succeeded in making the  roughest sorts of flint hatchets, they already knew the advantages of  life in societies. In the valleys of the tributaries of the Dordogne,  the surface of the rocks is in some places entirely covered with caves  which were inhabited by palaeolithic men.(4) Sometimes the  cave-dwellings are superposed in storeys, and they certainly recall much  more the nesting colonies of swallows than the dens of carnivores. As to  the flint implements discovered in those caves, to use Lubbock's words,  \"one may say without exaggeration that they are numberless.\" The same is  true of other palaeolithic stations. It also appears from Lartet's  investigations that the inhabitants of the Aurignac region in the south  of France partook of tribal meals at the burial of their dead. So that  men lived in societies, and had germs of a tribal worship, even at that  extremely remote epoch.    The same is still better proved as regards the later part of the stone  age. Traces of neolithic man have been found in numberless quantities,  so that we can reconstitute his manner of life to a great extent. When  the ice-cap (which must have spread from the Polar regions as far south  as middle France, middle Germany, and middle Russia, and covered Canada  as well as a good deal of what is now the United States) began to melt  away, the surfaces freed from ice were covered, first, with swamps and  marshes, and later on with numberless lakes.(5) Lakes filled all  depressions of the valleys before their waters dug out those permanent  channels which, during a subsequent epoch, became our rivers. And  wherever we explore, in Europe, Asia, or America, the shores of the  literally numberless lakes of that period, whose proper name would be  the Lacustrine period, we find traces of neolithic man. They are so  numerous that we can only wonder at the relative density of population  at that time. The \"stations\" of neolithic man closely follow each other  on the terraces which now mark the shores of the old lakes. And at each  of those stations stone implements appear in such numbers, that no doubt  is possible as to the length of time during which they were inhabited by  rather numerous tribes. Whole workshops of flint implements, testifying  of the numbers of workers who used to come together, have been  discovered by the archaeologists.    Traces of a more advanced period, already characterized by the use of  some pottery, are found in the shell-heaps of Denmark. They appear, as  is well known, in the shape of heaps from five to ten feet thick, from  100 to 200 feet wide, and 1,000 feet or more in length, and they are so  common along some parts of the sea-coast that for a long time they were  considered as natural growths. And yet they \"contain nothing but what  has been in some way or other subservient to the use of man,\" and they  are so densely stuffed with products of human industry that, during a  two days' stay at Milgaard, Lubbock dug out no less than 191 pieces of  stone-implements and four fragments of pottery.(6) The very size and  extension of the shell heaps prove that for generations and generations  the coasts of Denmark were inhabited by hundreds of small tribes which  certainly lived as peacefully together as the Fuegian tribes, which also  accumulate like shellheaps, are living in our own times.    As to the lake-dwellings of Switzerland, which represent a still further  advance in civilization, they yield still better evidence of life and  work in societies. It is known that even during the stone age the shores  of the Swiss lakes were dotted with a succession of villages, each of  which consisted of several huts, and was built upon a platform supported  by numberless pillars in the lake. No less than twenty-four, mostly  stone age villages, were discovered along the shores of Lake Leman,  thirty-two in the Lake of Constance, forty-six in the Lake of Neuchatel,  and so on; and each of them testifies to the immense amount of labour  which was spent in common by the tribe, not by the family. It has even  been asserted that the life of the lake-dwellers must have been  remarkably free of warfare. And so it probably was, especially if we  refer to the life of those primitive folk who live until the present  time in similar villages built upon pillars on the sea coasts.    It is thus seen, even from the above rapid hints, that our knowledge of  primitive man is not so scanty after all, and that, so far as it goes,  it is rather opposed than favourable to the Hobbesian speculations.  Moreover, it may be supplemented, to a great extent, by the direct  observation of such primitive tribes as now stand on the same level of  civilization as the inhabitants of Europe stood in"]]]
