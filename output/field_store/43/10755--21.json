This driv'ling and sniv'ling, and chiming in Parts,  This wining and pining, and breaking of Hearts;  All pensive and silent in Corners to sit,  Are pretty fine Pastimes for those that want Wit:  When this Passion and Fashion doth so far abuse 'em,  It were good the State should for Pendulums use 'em;  For if Reason it seize on, and make it give o'er,  No Labour can save, or reliev't any more.          _A_ SONG. _Set by Mr._ Henry Purcell.      [Music]    A Thousand several ways I try'd,    To hide my Passion from your view;  Conscious that I should be deny'd,    Because I cannot Merit you:  Absence, the last and worst of all,    Did so encrease my wretched Pain,  That I return'd, rather to fall    By the swift Fate, by the swift Fate of your Disdain.          _A_ SONG.      [Music]    To the Grove, gentle Love, let us be going,  Where the kind Spring and Wind all Day are Woing;  He with soft sighing Blasts strives to o'er-take her,  She would not tho' she flies, have him forsake her,  But in circling Rings returning,  And in purling Whispers Mourning;  She swells and pants, as if she'd say,  Fain I would, but dare not stay.          _A_ SONG.    _Set by Mr._ FISHBURN.      [Music]    Tell me no more of Flames in Love,    That common dull pretence,  Fools in Romances use to move    Soft Hearts of little Sense:  No, _Strephon_, I'm not such a Slave,    Love's banish'd Power to own;  Since Interest and Convenience have    So long usurp'd his Throne.    No burning Hope or cold Despair,    Dull Groves or purling Streams,  Sighing and talking to the Air    In Love's fantastick Dreams,  Can move my Pity or my Hate,    But Satyrist I'll prove,  And all ridiculous create    That shall pretend to Love.    Love was a Monarch once, 'tis true,    And God-like rul'd alone,  And tho' his Subjects were but few,    Their Hearts were all his own;  But since the Slaves revolted are,    And turn'd into a State,  Their Int'rest is their only Care,    And Love grows out of Date.          _A_ SONG.    _Set by Mr._ FISHBURN.      [Music]    Wealth breeds Care, Love, Hope and Fear;  What does Love our Business hear?  While _Bacchus_ merry does appear,    Fight on and fear no sinking,  Charge it briskly to the Brim,  'Till the flying Top-sails swim,  We owe the great Discovery to him    Of this new World of Drinking.    Grave Cabals that States refine,  Mingle their Debates with Wine;  _Ceres_ and the God o'th' Wine;    Makes every great Commander.  Let sober Sots Small-beer subdue,  The Wise and valiant Wine does woe;  The _Stagyrite_ had the honour to    Be drunk with _Alexander_.    Stand to your Arms, and now Advance  A Health to the _English_ King of _France_;  On to the next a _bon Speranze_,    By _Bacchus_ and _Apollo_.  Thus in State I lead the Van,  Fall in your Place by your right-hand Man,  Beat Drum! now March! Dub a dub, ran dan,    He's a _Whig_ that will not follow.          _A_ SONG. _Set by Mr._ Fishburn.      [Music]    Tho' Fortune and Love may be Deities still,    To those they Oblige by their Pow'r;  For my Part, they ever have us'd me so ill,    They cannot expect I'll adore:  Hereafter a Temple to Friendship I'll raise,  And dedicate there all the rest of my Days,    To the Goddess accepted my Vows,    _To the Goddess accepted my Vows_.    Thou perfectest Image of all things Divine,    Bright Center of endless Desires,  May the Glory be yours, and the Services mine,    When I light at your Altars the Fires.  I offer a Heart has Devotion so pure,  It would for your Service all Torments endure,    Might you but have all things you wish,    _Might you_, &c.    But yet the Goddess of Fools to despise,    I find I'm too much in her Power;  She makes me go where 'tis in vain to be wise,    In absence of her I adore:  If Love then undoes me before I get back,  I still with resignment receive the Attack,    Or languish away in Despair,    _Or languish_, &c.          _A_ SONG.    _Set by Mr._ Henry Purcell.      [Music]    He himself courts his own Ruin,    That with too great Passion sues 'em:  When Men Whine too much in Wooing,    Women with like Coquets use 'em:  Some by this way of addressing    Have the Sex so far transported,  That they'll fool away the Blessing    For the Pride of being Courted.    Jilt and smile when we adore 'em,    While some Blockhead buys the Favour;  Presents have more Power o'er 'em    Than all our soft Love and Labour,  Thus, like Zealots, with screw'd Faces,    We our fooling make the greater,  While we cant long winded Graces,    Others they fall to the Creature.          _A_ SONG. _Set by Mr._ DAMASENE.      [Music]    Cease lovely _Strephon_, cease to charm;    Useless, alas! is all this Art;  It's needless you should strongly arm,    To take a too, too willing Heart:  I hid my weakness all I could,    And chid my pratling tell-tale Eyes,  For fear the easie Conquest should    Take from the value of the Prize.    But oh! th' unruly Passion grew    So fast, it could not be conceal'd,  And soon, alas! I found to you    I must without Conditions yield,  Tho' you have thus surpriz'd my Heart,    Yet use it kindly, for you know,  It's not a gallant Victor's part    To insult o'er a vanquish'd Foe.          _A_ SONG.    _Set by Mr._ DAMASENE.      [Music]    You happy Youths, whose Hearts are free    From Love's Imperial Chain,  Henceforth be warn'd and taught by me,    And taught by me to avoid inchanting Pain,  Fatal the Wolves to trembling Flocks,    Sharp Winds to Blossoms prove:  To careless Seamen, hidden Rocks;    To human quiet Love.    Fly the Fair-Sex, if Bliss you prize,    The Snake's beneath the Flow'r:  Whoever gaz'd on Beauties Eyes,    That tasted Quiet more?  The Kind with restless Jealousie,    The Cruel fill with Care;  With baser Falshood those betray,    These kill us with Despair.          _A_ SONG. _Set by Dr._ STAGGINS.      [Music]    When first _Amyntas_ charm'd my Heart,    The heedless Sheep began to stray;  The Wolves soon stole the greatest part,    And all will now be made a Prey:  Ah! let not Love your Thoughts possess,  'Tis fatal to a Shepherdess;    The dangerous Passion you must shun,    Or else like me, be quite undone.          A SONG.    _Set by Mr._ RICHARD CROONE.      [Music]    How happy and free is the resolute Swain,    That denies to submit to the Yoak of the Fair;  Free from Excesses of Pleasure and Pain,    Neither dazl'd with Hope, nor deprest with Despair.  He's safe from Disturbance, and calmly enjoys  All the Pleasures of Love, without Clamour and Noise.    Poor Shepherds in vain their Affections reveal,    To a Nymph that is peevish, proud sullen and coy;  Vainly do Virgins their Passions conceal,    For they boil in their Grief, 'till themselves they destroy,  And thus the poor Darling lies under a Curse:  To be check'd in the Womb, or o'erlaid by the Nurse.          _A_ SONG.    _Sung by Mrs._ Cross _in the_ Mock-Astrologer, _Set by Mr._ RAMONDON.      [Music]    Why so pale and wan fond Lover?    Prithee, prithee, Prithee why so pale:  Will, when looking well can't move her,    Looking Ill, looking ill prevail?  Why so dull and mute young Sinner?    Prithee, prithee why so mute;  Will, when speaking well can't win her,    Saying nothing, nothing do't?  Quit, quit for shame, this will not move,    This cannot, cannot, cannot, cannot take her;  If of her self she will not love,    Nothing can, nothing can make her,    The Devil, the Devil, the Devil, the Devil take her.          _A_ SONG _occasioned by a Lady's wearing a Patch upon a becoming place  on her Face. Set by Mr._ John Weldon.      [Music]    That little Patch upon your Face    Wou'd seem a Foil on one less Fair,  Wou'd seem a Foil, wou'd seem a Foil,    Wou'd seem a Foil on one less Fair:  On you it hides a charming Grace,    And you in Pity, you in Pity,    You in Pity plac'd it there;  On you it hides a Charming Grace,    And you in Pity, you in Pity,    In Pity plac'd it there.  _And you in Pity, Pity,_    _And you in Pity plac'd it there._          _A_ SONG.    _Set and Sung by Mr._ LEVERIDGE _at the_ THEATER.      [Music]    _Iris_ beware when _Strephon_ pursues you,    'Tis but to boast a Conquest won:  All his Designs are aim'd to undo you,    Break off the Love he has begun:  When he's Addressing, and prays for the Blessing,    Which none but his _Iris_ can give alone;  O then beware, 'tis all to undo you,    'Tis but to boast a Conquest won:  She that's believing, while he is deceiving,    Like many already, will be undone;  _Iris_ beware when _Strephon_ pursues you,    'Tis but to boast a Conquest won.          _A_ SONG.    _Set by Mr._ RAMONDON, _Sung at the_ Theatre.      [Music]    How charming _Phillis_ is, how Fair,    How charming _Phillis_ is, how Fair,    O that she were as willing,  To ease my wounded Heart of Care,    And make her Eyes less killing;  To ease my wounded Heart of Care,    And make her Eyes less killing;  To ease my wounded Heart of Care,    And make her Eyes less killing;  To ease my wounded Heart of Care,    And make her Eyes less killing.    I Sigh, I Sigh, I Languish now,    And Love will not let me rest;  I drive about the Park and Bow,    Where-e'er I meet my Dearest.          _A_ SONG.    _Set by Mr._ ANTHONY YOUNG.      [Music]    Cease whining _Damon_ to Complain,    Of thy Unhappy Fate;  That _Sylvia_ should thy Love disdain,    Which lasting was and great.    For Love so constant flames so bright,    More unsuccessful prove:  Than cold neglect and sudden slight,    To gain the Nymph you love.    Then only you'll obtain the Prize,    When you her Coyness use;  If you pursue the Fair, she flies,    But if you fly, pursues.    Had _Phoebus_ not pursu'd so fast    The seeming cruel she;  The God a Virgin had embrac'd,    And not a lifeless Tree.      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2681"],[0,"Ten Years Later (#17)"],[1," our master?'\"    These words were so applicable to De Guiche that he turned pale, and,  overcome by a sudden agitation, was barely able to stretch out one hand  mechanically towards Raoul, as he covered his eyes and face with the  other.    \"But,\" continued Raoul, not interrupted by this movement of his friend,  \"Heaven be praised, the French, who are pronounced to be thoughtless  and indiscreet, reckless, even, are capable of bringing a calm and sound  judgment to bear on matters of such high importance. I added even  more, for I said, 'Learn, my lord, that we gentlemen of France devote  ourselves to our sovereigns by sacrificing them our affections, as well  as our fortunes and our lives; and whenever it may chance to happen that  the tempter suggests one of those vile thoughts that set the heart on  fire, we extinguish the flame, even if it has to be done by shedding our  blood for the purpose. Thus it is that the honor of three is saved:  our country's, our master's, and our own. It is thus that we act, your  Grace; it is thus that every man of honor ought to act.' In this  manner, my dear Guiche,\" continued Bragelonne, \"I addressed the Duke  of Buckingham; and he admitted I was right, and resigned himself  unresistingly to my arguments.\"    De Guiche, who had hitherto sat leaning forward while Raoul was  speaking, drew himself up, his eyes glancing proudly; he seized Raoul's  hand, his face, which had been as cold as ice, seemed on fire. \"And you  spoke magnificently,\" he said, in a half-choked voice; \"you are indeed a  friend, Raoul. But now, I entreat you, leave me to myself.\"    \"Do you wish it?\"    \"Yes; I need repose. Many things have agitated me to-day, both in mind  and body; when you return to-morrow I shall no longer be the same man.\"    \"I leave you, then,\" said Raoul, as he withdrew. The count advanced a  step towards his friend, and pressed him warmly in his arms. But in this  friendly pressure Raoul could detect the nervous agitation of a great  internal conflict.    The night was clear, starlit, and splendid; the tempest had passed away,  and the sweet influences of the evening had restored life, peace and  security everywhere. A few fleecy clouds were floating in the heavens,  and indicated from their appearance a continuance of beautiful weather,  tempered by a gentle breeze from the east. Upon the large square in  front of the hotel, the shadows of the tents, intersected by the golden  moonbeams, formed as it were a huge mosaic of jet and yellow flagstones.  Soon, however, the entire town was wrapped in slumber; a feeble light  still glimmered in Madame's apartment, which looked out upon the square,  and the soft rays from the expiring lamp seemed to be the image of the  calm sleep of a young girl, hardly yet sensible of life's anxieties, and  in whom the flame of existence sinks placidly as sleep steals over the  body.    Bragelonne quitted the tent with the slow and measured step of a man  curious to observe, but anxious not to be seen. Sheltered behind the  thick curtains of his own tent, embracing with a glance the whole  square, he noticed that, after a few moments' pause, the curtains of De  Guiche's tent were agitated, and then drawn partially aside. Behind them  he could perceive the shadow of De Guiche, his eyes, glittering in the  obscurity, fastened ardently upon the princess's sitting apartment,  which was partially lighted by the lamp in the inner room. The soft  light which illumined the windows was the count's star. The fervent  aspirations of his nature could be read in his eyes. Raoul, concealed  in the shadow, divined the many passionate thoughts that established,  between the tent of the young ambassador and the balcony of the  princess, a mysterious and magical bond of sympathy--a bond created by  thoughts imprinted with so much strength and persistence of will,  that they must have caused happy and loving dreams to alight upon the  perfumed couch, which the count, with the eyes of his soul, devoured so  eagerly.    But De Guiche and Raoul were not the only watchers. The window of one  of the houses looking on the square was opened too, the casement of the  house where Buckingham resided. By the aid of the rays of light which  issued from this latter, the profile of the duke could be distinctly  seen, as he indolently reclined upon the carved balcony with its velvet  hangings; he also was breathing in the direction of the princess's  apartment his prayers and the wild visions of his love.    Raoul could not resist smiling, as thinking of Madame, he said to  himself, \"Hers is, indeed, a heart well besieged;\" and then added,  compassionately, as he thought of Monsieur, \"and he is a husband well  threatened too; it is a good thing for him that he is a prince of such  high rank, that he has an army to safeguard for him that which is his  own.\" Bragelonne watched for some time the conduct of the two lovers,  listened to the loud and uncivil slumbers of Manicamp, who snored as  imperiously as though he was wearing his blue and gold, instead of his  violet suit.    Then he turned towards the night breeze which bore towards him, he  seemed to think, the distant song of the nightingale; and, after having  laid in a due provision of melancholy, another nocturnal malady, he  retired to rest thinking, with regard to his own love affair, that  perhaps four or even a larger number of eyes, quite as ardent as those  of De Guiche and Buckingham, were coveting his own idol in the  chateau at Blois. \"And Mademoiselle de Montalais is by no means a very  conscientious garrison,\" said he to himself, sighing aloud.        Chapter XII. From Le Havre to Paris.    The next day the _fetes_ took place, accompanied by all the pomp and  animation that the resources of the town and the cheerful disposition of  men's minds could supply. During the last few hours spent in Le Havre,  every preparation for the departure had been made. After Madame had  taken leave of the English fleet, and, once again, had saluted the  country in saluting its flags, she entered her carriage, surrounded by a  brilliant escort. De Guiche had hoped that the Duke of Buckingham  would accompany the admiral to England; but Buckingham succeeded in  demonstrating to the queen that there would be great impropriety in  allowing Madame to proceed to Paris, almost unprotected. As soon as it  had been settled that Buckingham was to accompany Madame, the young  duke selected a corps of gentlemen and officers to form part of his own  suite, so that it was almost an army that now set out towards Paris,  scattering gold, and exciting the liveliest demonstrations as they  passed through the different towns and villages on the route. The  weather was very fine. France is a beautiful country, especially along  the route by which the procession passed. Spring cast its flowers and  its perfumed foliage on their path. Normandy, with its vast variety of  vegetation, its blue skies and silver rivers, displayed itself in all  the loveliness of a paradise to the new sister of the king. _Fetes_ and  brilliant displays received them everywhere along the line of march.  De Guiche and Buckingham forgot everything; De Guiche in his anxiety to  prevent any fresh attempts on the part of the duke, and Buckingham, in  his desire to awaken in the heart of the princess a softer remembrance  of the country to which the recollection of many happy days belonged.  But, alas! the poor duke could perceive that the image of that country  so cherished by himself became, from day to day, more and more effaced  in Madame's mind, in exact proportion as her affection for France became  more deeply engraved on her heart. In fact, it was not difficult to  perceive that his most devoted attention awakened no acknowledgement,  and that the grace with which he rode one of his most fiery horses was  thrown away, for it was only casually and by the merest accident that  the princess's eyes were turned towards him. In vain did he try,  in order to fix upon himself one of those looks, which were thrown  carelessly around, or bestowed elsewhere, to produce in the animal he  rode its greatest display of strength, speed, temper and address; in  vain did he, by exciting his horse almost to madness, spur him, at the  risk of dashing himself in pieces against the trees, or of rolling in  the ditches, over the gates and barriers which they passed, or down the  steep declivities of the hills. Madame, whose attention had been aroused  by the noise, turned her head for a moment to observe the cause of it,  and then, slightly smiling, again entered into conversation with her  faithful guardians, Raoul and De Guiche, who were quietly riding at her  carriage doors. Buckingham felt himself a prey to all the tortures of  jealousy; an unknown, unheard of anguish glided through his veins, and  laid siege to his heart; and then, as if to show that he knew the  folly of his conduct, and that he wished to correct, by the humblest  submission, his flights of absurdity, he mastered his horse, and  compelled him, reeking with sweat and flecked with foam, to champ  his bit close beside the carriage, amidst the crowd of courtiers.  Occasionally he obtained a word from Madame as a recompense, and yet her  speech seemed almost a reproach.    \"That is well, my lord,\" she said, \"now you are reasonable.\"    Or from Raoul, \"Your Grace is killing your horse.\"    Buckingham listened patiently to Raoul's remarks, for he instinctively  felt, without having had any proof that such was the case, that Raoul  checked the display of De Guiche's feelings, and that, had it not  been for Raoul, some mad act or proceeding, either of the count, or  of Buckingham himself, would have brought about an open rupture, or a  disturbance--perhaps even exile itself. From the moment of that excited  conversation the two young men had held in front of the tents at Le  Havre, when Raoul made the duke perceive the impropriety of"]]]
