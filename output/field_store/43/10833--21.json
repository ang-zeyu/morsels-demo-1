Ripahau had but a Prayer Book  with him, and it was hard to teach a class from one book. But he  remembered that a few more books had been brought from Rotorua by the  party with whom he travelled. These he procured, and among them there  was a much-damaged copy of the Gospel of St. Luke. This bore the name of  Ngakuku, and was in fact the very copy upon which little Tarore was  sleeping when she was murdered in the night! In order to study in quiet,  Tamihana and his cousin Te Whiwhi took Ripahau to the island and made  him teach them there. The two cousins had Tarore's gospel for their  lesson book. \"We learnt,\" they said, \"every day, every night. We sat at  night in the hut, all round the fire in the middle. Whiwhi had part of  the book, and I part. Sometimes we went to sleep upon the book, then  woke up and read again. After we had been there six months, we could  read a little, very slowly.\"    But they had learned something even better than the art of reading. They  had learned--and learned with the spirit--the subject-matter of the  book. They now took Ripahau with them to some villages on the mainland  to teach the people about the book: \"These people believed, and they all  wanted the book. I told them I could not give them any part of it, but I  told Ripahau to write for them on paper, Our Father, &c. He wrote it for  them all, and they learnt it. Before, Ripahau had not believed, but now  his heart began to grow. We talked to him, and he believed.\"    The result of this marvellous conversion was the visit of the two  cousins to the Bay of Islands. They asked for a white teacher to come  and live among them. The call was an urgent one, and Henry Williams  volunteered to go himself. But his brethren and converts, fearing the  removal of his great influence, voted against the proposal, and there  was no other volunteer. The chiefs retired to their cabin in utter  despair: \"Oh! dark, very dark, our hearts were.\" A fortnight they stayed  in their cabin, when a sailor announced that the missionary's boat was  approaching. Henry Williams called out from it, \"Friends, do not be  angry with me any more; here is your missionary.\" It was the slight and  consumptive Hadfield. This young recruit had not been able to understand  the language of the visitors, but after they had gone he asked the  purport of their errand. \"I will go with them,\" he exclaimed; \"as well  die there as here.\" The older men were loth to let him make the venture,  but he would not be kept back. It was at length resolved that Henry  Williams should accompany him to the south, and help him to settle among  the Ngatitoas. \"We were all very happy that day,\" wrote Tamihana; \"our  hearts cried, we were very happy!\"    This southward journey of Williams and Hadfield, which began on October  21st, 1839, was like that to the Thames six years before, in that it  inaugurated a great step forward in the work of the mission, and led the  missionaries into regions which they had only dimly known before. Yet  its fateful significance, both for New Zealand and for the individual  travellers, could hardly be even guessed at the time by the two men  themselves. To the one it was to bring life; to the other, troubles  almost worse than death.    After ten days' voyage down the eastern coast, the schooner which  conveyed Henry Williams, Hadfield, and their Maori retinue rounded Cape  Palliser; but, meeting there the full force of the west wind through the  straits, was unable to make direct for Kapiti, and took shelter in a  harbour which opened out on their starboard bow. \"Very different from  what is represented in the map of Captain Cook,\" remarked Williams, thus  showing how little had hitherto been known about this magnificent inlet  of Port Nicholson. But once inside its capacious recesses, he found that  others had just discovered its value before him. Two Wesleyan  missionaries had been there during the year, and had left a native  teacher behind them; while a still more important visitor had arrived  even more lately in the person of Colonel Wakefield, advance agent for  the New Zealand Company, whose emigrant ships were every day expected.    Much to Williams' displeasure he learned that Wakefield was claiming  possession of the shores of the harbour--thus leaving to the Maori  inhabitants no place of their own for the future. This information came  from one of his old Paihia boys, Reihana, who had secured a passage with  the Wesleyan expedition, and was now engaged in teaching his own fellow  tribesmen. Reihana complained that he with others had opposed the sale  of their lands, but that the Europeans would take no account of their  rights, and insisted on having the whole.    Henry Williams was not opposed to colonisation if rightly undertaken,  but his blood began to boil at this story; nor did he feel happier when  he found that a savage quarrel had arisen between two parties of Maoris  over some of the land in question, and that during the last fortnight  many men had been killed. No protest could be made at the moment, as  Wakefield had left for the north; but, finding Reihana anxious to leave  a place where his property was thus in jeopardy, Williams bought of him  the land for a mission station. The Society at Home, however, decided  not to form a station in the place, and the section (which comprised  about 60 acres of what is now the heart of Wellington) remained in  Williams' hands. The Maoris would never allow it to be pegged out by  the Company's surveyors until Henry Williams himself, on his next visit,  presented all but one acre to the Company in consideration of their  undertaking to make reserves for the benefit of the natives. The one  acre he afterwards sold, and devoted the proceeds to the endowment of a  church at Pakaraka. This is the real history of a transaction which, by  frequent misrepresentation, has brought undeserved obloquy upon a  generous man.    After distributing Prayer Books amongst the _pas_ around the harbour,  the travellers made another attempt to continue their voyage. Again they  were blown back to the Port, and eventually decided to walk to their  destination overland, leaving the schooner to follow when the wind  should change. Hadfield was extremely unwell, but pluckily resolved to  follow his chief, and together they set off on the morning of Nov. 14  over the steep hills upon which the suburbs of Wellington now stand.    Four days of hard walking brought them to Waikanae. At many places on  the road the people came out to give them welcome, for the name of  Wiremu was familiar to all. At every place, too, he was urged to tell  them about religion, and at the _pa_ of Waikanae the people \"kept me in  conversation till I could talk no more.\"    Next day a ceremonious visit was paid to Rauparaha in his island  fortress: \"The old man told me that now he had seen my eyes and heard my  words, he would lay aside his evil ways and turn to the Book.\" How far  this change was sincere may be doubted; it seems to have been partly  caused by his fear of Col. Wakefield's ship, which was mistaken for a  man-of-war. At any rate the old warrior gave a warm welcome to the young  missionary, Hadfield, and insisted that he should live at Otaki under  his protection.    A meeting of a different character was that between Williams and his old  scholar, Ripahau. This man had married a daughter of Rangitaake, or  Wiremu Kingi, head chief of Waikanae, and had become a person of great  influence in the tribe. \"He has taught many to read,\" writes Williams,  \"and has instructed numbers, as far as he is able, in the truths of the  Gospel; so that many tribes, for some distance around, call themselves  Believers, keep the Lord's Day, assemble for worship, and use the  Liturgy of the Church of England. The schools also are numerous.\" A  fortnight later, just as he was about to leave the district, Williams  baptised this remarkable young teacher by the appropriate name of  Joseph, for of him too it might be said:        But he had sent a man before them,      Even Joseph, who was sold to be a bond-servant,    That he might inform his princes after his will      And teach his senators wisdom.    Unfortunately the princes, or chiefs, had not all learned wisdom. There  had been a war between Rauparaha's people and those of Waikanae over the  distribution of the goods given by Wakefield for the land at Port  Nicholson. When Williams arrived at Waikanae the traces of carnage lay  all around. Again, therefore, he was called to be a peace-maker. He  spent a week on a mission to Otaki, and returned to Waikanae with 300  armed and feathered warriors at his heels. But these men had put into  his hands full power to treat with the enemy. After much debate, Ripahau  was similarly commissioned by the other side; peace was soon concluded;  a war-dance gave relief to the excited feelings of the tribesmen; a  service occupied the evening; and the day was concluded with a quiet  meeting, in which the few native teachers of the district were prepared  to receive the Holy Communion, which was to be administered for the  first time in those regions on the Sunday morning which was now  approaching.    Early on that day the Maoris came round the missionaries' tent and began  their Matins worship. Ripahau had taught them hymns, and to these they  had themselves fitted \"very agreeable\" tunes. At 8 o'clock a great  service was held, with a congregation of 1,200 people. Then followed the  Holy Eucharist. School and evening service and conversation with anxious  enquirers at the tent door kept the missionary busy till late at night.    Three days later Henry Williams bade farewell to Hadfield, and started  off alone on a journey such as had never yet been attempted by a white  man in New Zealand. His schooner had not yet arrived, and he had  determined to travel overland to the Whanganui"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31425"],[0,"Report of the Decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the (#17)"],[1,"of the respective  parties are concerned, is in every respect substantially the same as  if it had in open violation of law entertained jurisdiction over the  judgment of the State court upon a writ of error, and revised and  reversed its judgment upon the ground that its opinion upon the  question of law was erroneous. It would ill become this court to  sanction such an attempt to evade the law, or to exercise an appellate  power in this circuitous way, which it is forbidden to exercise in the  direct and regular and invariable forms of judicial proceedings.    Upon the whole, therefore, it is the judgment of this court, that it  appears by the record before us that the plaintiff in error is not a  citizen of Missouri, in the sense in which that word is used in the  Constitution; and that the Circuit Court of the United States, for  that reason, had no jurisdiction in the case, and could give no  judgment in it. Its judgment for the defendant must, consequently, be  reversed, and a mandate issued, directing the suit to be dismissed for  want of jurisdiction.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Justice WAYNE.    Concurring as I do entirely in the opinion of the court, as it has  been written and read by the Chief Justice--without any qualification  of its reasoning or its conclusions--I shall neither read nor file an  opinion of my own in this case, which I prepared when I supposed it  might be necessary and proper for me to do so.    The opinion of the court meets fully and decides every point which was  made in the argument of the case by the counsel on either side of it.  Nothing belonging to the case has been left undecided, nor has any  point been discussed and decided which was not called for by the  record, or which was not necessary for the judicial disposition of it,  in the way that it has been done, by more than a majority of the  court.    In doing this, the court neither sought nor made the case. It was  brought to us in the course of that administration of the laws which  Congress has enacted, for the review of cases from the Circuit Courts  by the Supreme Court.    In our action upon it, we have only discharged our duty as a distinct  and efficient department of the Government, as the framers of the  Constitution meant the judiciary to be, and as the States of the Union  and the people of those States intended it should be, when they  ratified the Constitution of the United States.    The case involves private rights of value, and constitutional  principles of the highest importance, about which there had become  such a difference of opinion, that the peace and harmony of the  country required the settlement of them by judicial decision.    It would certainly be a subject of regret, that the conclusions of the  court have not been assented to by all of its members, if I did not  know from its history and my own experience how rarely it has happened  that the judges have been unanimous upon constitutional questions of  moment, and if our decision in this case had not been made by as large  a majority of them as has been usually had on constitutional questions  of importance.    Two of the judges, Mr. Justices McLean and Curtis, dissent from the  opinion of the court. A third, Mr. Justice Nelson, gives a separate  opinion upon a single point in the case, with which I concur, assuming  that the Circuit Court had jurisdiction; but he abstains altogether  from expressing any opinion upon the eighth section of the act of  1820, known commonly as the Missouri Compromise law, and six of us  declare that it was unconstitutional.    But it has been assumed, that this court has acted extra-judicially in  giving an opinion upon the eighth section of the act of 1820, because,  as it has decided that the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction of the  case, this court had no jurisdiction to examine the case upon its  merits.    But the error of such an assertion has arisen in part from a  misapprehension of what has been heretofore decided by the Supreme  Court, in cases of a like kind with that before us; in part, from a  misapplication to the Circuit Courts of the United States, of the  rules of pleading concerning pleas to the jurisdiction which prevail  in common-law courts; and from its having been forgotten that this  case was not brought to this court by appeal or writ of error from a  State court, but by a writ of error to the Circuit Court of the United  States.    The cases cited by the Chief Justice to show that this court has now  only done what it has repeatedly done before in other cases, without  any question of its correctness, speak for themselves. The differences  between the rules concerning pleas to the jurisdiction in the courts  of the United States and common-law courts have been stated and  sustained by reasoning and adjudged cases; and it has been shown that  writs of error to a State court and to the Circuit Courts of the  United States are to be determined by different laws and principles.  In the first, it is our duty ascertain if this court has jurisdiction,  under the twenty-fifth section of the judiciary act, to review the  case _from the State court_; and if it shall be found that it has not,  the case is at end, so far as this court is concerned; for our power  to review the case upon its merits has been made, by the twenty-fifth  section, to depend upon its having jurisdiction; when it has not, this  court cannot criticise, controvert, or give any opinion upon the  merits of a case from a State court.    But in a case brought to this court, by appeal or by writ of error  from _a Circuit Court of the United States_, we begin a review of it,  _not by inquiring if this court has jurisdiction_, but if that court  has it. If the case has been decided by that court upon its merits,  but the record shows it to be deficient in those averments which by  the law of the United States must be made by the plaintiff in the  action, to give the court jurisdiction of his case, we send it back to  the court from which it was brought, with directions to be dismissed,  though it has been decided there upon its merits.    So, in a case containing the averments by the plaintiff which are  necessary to give the Circuit Court jurisdiction, if the defendant  shall file his plea in abatement denying the truth of them, and the  plaintiff shall demur to it, and the court should _erroneously sustain  the plaintiff's demurrer, or declare the plea to be insufficient, and  by doing so require the defendant to answer over by a plea to the  merits, and shall decide the case upon such pleading_, this court has  the same authority to inquire into the jurisdiction of that court to  do so, and to correct its error in that regard, that it had in the  other case to correct its error, in trying a case in which the  plaintiff had not made those averments which were necessary to give  the court jurisdiction. In both cases the record is resorted to, to  determine the point of jurisdiction; but, as the power of review of  cases from a Federal court, by this court, is not limited by the law  to a part of the case, this court may correct an error upon the  merits; and there is the same reason for correcting an erroneous  judgment of the Circuit Court, where the want of jurisdiction appears  from any part of the record, that there is for declaring a want of  jurisdiction for a want of necessary averments. Any attempt to control  the court from doing so by the technical common-law rules of pleading  in cases of jurisdiction, when a defendant has been denied his plea to  it, would tend to enlarge the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, by  limiting this court's review of its judgments in that particular. But  I will not argue a point already so fully discussed. I have every  confidence in the opinion of the court upon the point of jurisdiction,  and do not allow myself to doubt that the error of a contrary  conclusion will be fully understood by all who shall read the argument  of the Chief Justice.    I have already said that the opinion of the court has my unqualified  assent.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Justice NELSON.    I shall proceed to state the grounds upon which I have arrived at the  conclusion, that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.  The suit was brought in the court below by the plaintiff, for the  purpose of asserting his freedom, and that of Harriet, his wife, and  two children.    The defendant plead, in abatement to the suit, that the cause of  action, if any, accrued to the plaintiff out of the jurisdiction of  the court, and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the courts of  the State of Missouri; for, that the said plaintiff is not a citizen  of the State of Missouri, as alleged in the declaration, because he is  a negro of African descent; his ancestors were of pure African blood,  and were brought into this country and sold as negro slaves.    To this plea the plaintiff demurred, and the defendant joined in  demurrer. The court below sustained the demurrer, holding that the  plea was insufficient in law to abate the suit.    The defendant then plead over in bar of the action:    1. The general issue. 2. That the plaintiff was a negro slave, the  lawful property of the defendant. And 3. That Harriet, the wife of  said plaintiff, and the two children, were the lawful slaves of the  said defendant. Issue was taken upon these pleas, and the cause went  down to trial before the court and jury, and an agreed state of facts  was presented, upon which the trial proceeded, and resulted in a  verdict for the defendant, under the instructions of the court.    The facts agreed upon were substantially as follows:    That in the year 1834, the plaintiff, Scott, was a negro slave of Dr.  Emerson, who was a surgeon in the army of the United States; and in  that year he took the plaintiff from the State of Missouri to the  military post at Rock Island, in the"]]]
