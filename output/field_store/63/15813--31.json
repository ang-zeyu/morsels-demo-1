And while there is here and there one in England who resembles a      leader of labor who is a pacifist, the determination of the British      seamen to go through with the war to the finish is scarcely more      than a reflection of the rank-and-file spirit that is to be found      throughout the whole of British labor.      NO PARLEYS WITH ENEMY LABOR    The American delegates met the representatives of labor in London and in  Paris. In England they found the sentiment almost unanimous in approval  of their decision to favor no conferences with German labor  representatives until a victory had been achieved. In France, however,  they encountered a group that favored contact with the German and  Austrian Socialists. On May 6 there was a conference in Paris between  the American labor delegates and the members of the Confederation  Generale de Travail, the great French revolutionary labor organization.  M. Jouhaux, General Secretary of the confederation, made the proposed  international conference practically the sole note of his speech.  France, he asserted, had no hatred for the German workers themselves,  and he pointed out that if the conference took place it could have only  one of two results. Either the workers in the enemy countries would  refuse to join in the efforts of the workers of the allied countries for  the liberation of the world's peoples, in which case the war must  continue, or they would accept the allied view of what was right and  would act with the allied peoples for the good of humanity.    The American reply was in these definite words:    \"We don't hate the German workers any more than you do, but to give them  our hand now would be looked upon by them only as a sign of weakness.\"    After reminding the congress of the hypocritical professions of the  German Socialist Party before the war, the delegation declared itself in  entire agreement with Samuel Gompers that American labor men would  refuse to meet the German delegates under any circumstances so long as  Germany was ruled by an Imperialistic Government. This declaration left  Albert Thomas, former Cabinet officer and leader of the group,  practically without a word to say. M. Thomas urged the same arguments  as Jouhaux, but all the satisfaction the French labor men got was a  promise from James Wilson, President of the American delegation, to  report the matter to the American workers when he returned home.    Chairman Wilson reaffirmed at a luncheon given at the Foreign Office May  10 that American labor would not discuss the war with representatives of  German labor until victory was won, because German labor, which was  permitting the war, must do something itself in its own country toward  ending the conflict justly before it could debate with labor  representatives of the allied countries on what ought to be.    The luncheon was given by Stephen Pichon, Foreign Minister, on behalf of  the French Government. With the exception of Premier Clemenceau, all the  members of the Cabinet were present as well as other men notable in  French public life. Ambassador Sharp was also in attendance.    The mission visited the fighting front and returned to London May 11 to  hold mass meetings at English industrial centres. The members were  received by the King and dined by the London Chamber of Commerce May  15.          Progress of the War    Recording Campaigns on All Fronts and Collateral Events From April 18,  1918, Up to and Including May 17, 1918      UNITED STATES    The campaign for the Third Liberty Loan of $3,000,000,000 ended on May  4. The total subscription was $4,170,019,650, as announced by the  Treasury Department on May 17.    On April 20 President Wilson issued a proclamation extending to women  enemy aliens the restrictions imposed on men.    The Overman bill, giving the President power to consolidate and  co-ordinate executive bureaus and agencies as a war emergency measure,  was passed by the Senate on April 28 and by the House on May 14.    The War Trade Board announced on May 3 that a general commercial  agreement with Norway had been signed. On May 12 it announced that in  order to conserve materials and labor and to add tonnage to the fleet  carrying men and munitions to Europe, arrangements had been made to have  Great Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium pass upon the advisability of  releasing proposed exports before granting licenses to shippers. On May  14 an agreement was reached between the United States and the allied  nations providing that all imports to the United States should be  forbidden unless sanctioned by the War Trade Board.    A conference report on the Sedition bill, giving the Government broad  new powers to punish disloyal acts and utterances, was adopted by the  Senate on May 4, and by the House of Representatives on May 7, and sent  to the President for his signature.    As a result of charges of graft, inefficiency, and pro-German tendencies  directed against the military aircraft administration by Gutzon Borglum,  President Wilson, on May 15, asked Charles Evans Hughes to aid Attorney  General Gregory in making a thorough investigation. Mr. Hughes accepted  the invitation. The President also wrote a letter to Senator Martin  denouncing the Chamberlain resolution for an investigation of the  conduct of the war by the Committee on Military Affairs of the Senate,  and on the same day the Senate Committee on Audit and Expenses, to which  the resolution had been referred, ordered a favorable report on it,  modifying it so as to provide for a limited inquiry.      SUBMARINE BLOCKADE    The American steamship Lake Moor was reported sunk on April 11.    Forty-four Americans were killed when the Old Dominion liner Tyler was  sunk off the French coast on May 2.    The British liner Oronsa was sunk on April 28. All on board except three  members of the crew were saved. The British sloop Cowslip was torpedoed  on April 25. Five officers and one man were missing.    The British Admiralty announced on April 24 the cessation of the weekly  return of shipping losses and the substitution of a monthly report.    In a statement made in the Chamber of Deputies on May 11, Georges  Leygues, the French Minister of Marine, declared that the total of  allied tonnage sunk by German submarines in five months was 1,648,622,  less than half the amount alleged by Germany to have been destroyed. He  announced that the number of submarines sunk by the Allies was greater  than Germany's output.

For an instant I thought it  might have been rehearsed. I saw Blanca as a slim, gentle girl in white,  with a white head-dress. A dancer who could symbolize purity, now in the  grip of red passion.    An instant, and then horror struck us. And I could feel it surge over  the audience. A gasp of horror. The frightened girl in white tried to  escape. The musicians wavered and broke. I stared, stricken, with  freezing blood. Upon the stage the knife went swiftly up; it came down;  then up again. The red Sensua stood gloating. The knife she waved aloft  was truly dripping crimson now.    With a choked, gasping scream the white girl of the toilers crumpled and  fell.... She lay motionless, at the feet of the crimson murderess.          CHAPTER VIII    _\"Why, This Is Treason!\"_      There was a gasp. The audience sat frozen. On the stage, with no one  lifting a hand to stop her, the crimson murderess made a leap and  vanished. A moment, and then the spell broke. A girl in the audience  screamed. Some one moved to stand up and overturned a seat with a crash.    The amphitheater under the canopy broke into a pandemonium. Screams and  shouts, crashing of seats, screaming, frightened people struggling to  get out of the darkness. The torches on the stage were dropped and  extinguished. The darkness leaped upon us.    Derek and I were gripping Hope. We were struck by a bench flung backward  from in front. People were rushing at us. We were swept along in the  panic of the crowd.    I heard Derek shout, \"We must keep together!\"    We fought, but we were swept backward. We found ourselves outside the  canopy. Torchlight was here. It glimmered on the pool of water. People  were everywhere rushing past us, some one way, some another. Aimless,  with the shock of terror upon them. Under the canopy they were still  screaming.    I was momentarily separated from Derek and Hope. I very nearly stumbled  into the pool. A girl was here, crouched on the stone bank. Her wet  crimson veils clung to her white body. Her long, wet hair lay on her. I  stumbled against her. She raised her face. Eyes, wide with terror. Mute,  painted red lips....    I heard Derek calling again, \"Charlie!\" I shoved my way back to him. The  crowd was thinning out around us. Girls were climbing from the pool,  rushing off in terror, to mingle with the milling throng. Among the  crowd now, down by the edge of the bay, I saw the sinister figures of  men come running. The toilers, miraculously appearing everywhere! I saw,  across the pool, a terrified girl crouching. A huge man in a black cloak  came leaping. The colored lights in the trees glittered on his upraised  knife blade as it descended. The girl fell with a shuddering scream. The  murderer turned and whirled away into the crowd.    \"Charlie!\"    I was back with Derek and Hope. Hope stood trembling, with her hand  pressed against her mouth. Derek gripped me.    \"That cloak, get it off!\" He ripped his crimson cloak from him and  tossed it away. He jerked mine off. \"Too dangerous! That's the crimson  badge of death to-night.\"    We stood revealed in the clothes of our own world. My business suit, in  which that day I had worked in Wall Street. Derek in his swagger  uniform. He stood drawn to his full height, a powerful figure. The wires  of our mechanism showed at his wrists. They dangled at the back of his  neck, mounting to that strangely fashioned electrode clamped to his  head. Strange, awe-inspiring figure of a man!    We were momentarily alone under the colored lights of the trees. Hope  murmured, \"But they will see us--see you....\"    Derek's face was grim, but at her words he laughed harshly. \"See us!  What matter?\" He swung on me. \"It forces our hand; we've got to come out  in the open now! This murder--this king! My God, what a fool to let  himself get into such a condition as this! His people--this chaos--what  a fool!\"    He had drawn his dirk. I realized that I was holding mine. Near us the  body of a crimson noble was lying under a tree. A sword was there on the  ground. Derek sprang for it, waved it aloft.    I think that no more than a minute or two had passed since the murder.  Down by the water the boats were hastily loading and leaving the dock.  One of them overturned. There were screams everywhere. Red forms lay  inert upon the ground where they had been trampled, or stabbed. But the  prowling figures of the toilers now seemed to have vanished.    Derek gestured. \"Look at the palace! The garden!\"    Beyond the canopy I could see the dim gardens surrounding the palace. I  glimpsed the high fence, and the gateway in front. A mob of toilers was  there. The guard at the gate had fled. The mob was surging through. Men  and women in the vivid garments of the fields, armed with sticks and  clubs and stones and the implements of agriculture. They milled at the  gate; rushed through; scattered over the garden. Their shouts floated  back to us in a blended murmur.    We were standing only a dozen feet from the edge of the pavilion. No one  seemed yet to have noticed us. A few straggling lights had come on under  the canopy. I could see the dead lying there in the wreckage of  overturned seats.    Derek said, \"We can't help it--it's done. Look at them! They're  attacking the palace!\"    This mob springing miraculously into existence! I realized that the  toilers had planned that if Sensua were chosen they would attack the  festival. The murder of Blanca had come as big a surprise to them as to  us....    \"Come on! Can you get into the palace, Hope? The king must have gotten  back there. Get your wits, girl!\" Derek stood gripping her, shaking her.    \"Yea, there's an underground passage. He probably went that way.\"    From the palace gardens the shouts of the mob sounded louder now. And  from within the building there was an alarm bell tumultuously clanging.    Hope gasped, \"This way.\"    She led us back into the pavilion. We clambered over its broken seats,  past its grewsome huddled figures. Some were still moving.... We went to  a small door under the platform. A dim room was here, deserted now.  Against the wall was a large wardrobe closet; stage costumes were  hanging in it. The closet was fully twenty feet deep. We pushed our way  through the hanging garments. Hope fumbled at the blank board wall in  the rear. Her groping fingers found a secret panel. A door swung aside  and a rush of dank cool air came at us. The dark outlines of a tunnel  stretched ahead.    \"In, Charlie!\"    I crouched and stepped through the door. Hope closed it behind us. The  tunnel passage was black, but soon we began to see its vague outlines.  Derek, sword in hand, led us. I clutched my dirk. We went perhaps five  hundred feet. Down at first, then up again. I figured we were under the  palace gardens now, as the tunnel was winding to the left. There were  occasional small lights.    Derek whispered to Hope, \"The toilers don't know of this?\"    \"No.\"    \"Where does it bring us out?\" I whispered.    \"Into the lower floor of the castle. The king must have gone this way.  There might be a guard, Derek. What will you do?\"    He laughed. \"I can handle this mob. Disperse it! You'll see! And handle  the king.\" He laughed again grimly. \"There is no Blanca to choose now.\"    The tunnel went round a sharp angle and began steeply ascending. Derek  stopped.    \"How much further, Hope?\"    \"Not far,\" she whispered.    We crept forward. The tunnel was more like a small corridor now. Beyond  Derek's crouching figure, in the dimness I could see a doorway. Derek  turned and gestured to us to keep back. A palace guard was standing  there. His pike went up.    \"Who are you?\"    \"A friend.\"    But the man lunged with his pike. Derek leaped aside. His sword flashed;  the flat of it struck the fellow in the face. Derek, with incredible  swiftness, was upon him. They went down together and before the man  could shout, Derek had struck him on the head with the sword hilt. The  guard lay motionless. Derek climbed up as we ran forward to join him.    I noticed now, for the first time, that in his left hand Derek held a  small metal cylinder. A weapon, strange to me, which he had brought with  him. He had not mentioned it. He had produced it, when menaced by this  guard. Then he evidently decided not to use it.    He shoved it back in his pocket. He whirled on us, panting. \"Hurry!  Close that door!\"    We closed the door of the tunnel.    \"Charlie, help me move him!\"    We dragged the prostrate figure of the unconscious guard aside into a  shadow of the wall. We were in a lower room of the palace. It seemed  momentarily unoccupied. Overhead we could hear the footsteps of running  people. A confusion in the palace, and outside in the garden the shouts  of the menacing throng of toilers. And above it all, the wild clanging  of the alarm bell from the palace tower.    Derek said swiftly, \"Get us to the king!\"    Hope led us through the castle corridors, and up a flight of steps to  the main floor. The rooms here were thronged with terrified  people--crimson nobles in their bedraggled finery of the festival. In  all the chaos no one seemed to notice us.    We mounted another staircase. We found a vacant room; through its  windows we looked a moment, gazing into the garden. It was jammed with a  menacing mob, which milled about, leaderless, waving crude weapons,  shouting imprecations at the palace. At the foot of the main steps the  throng stood packed, but none dared to mount. A group of the palace  guards stood on the platform over the moat.    Derek turned away impatiently. \"Let's get to the king.\"    We mounted to the upper story. The castle occupants stared at Derek and  me as we passed them. A group of girls at the head of the staircase fled  before us.    \"The king,\" Derek demanded, \"Which is his apartment? Hurry, Hope, we've  no time now!\"    We found the frightened king seated on a couch with his counsellors"]]]
