The captain guessed he read in his face  \"well now, if I was to run this here Yankee right slap  on a rock and bilge her, the King would make a man of me  forever.\" So, says he to the first leftenant, reeve a  rope thro' that are block at the tip eend of the fore  yard, and clap a runnin nuse in it. The leftenant did it  as quick as wink, and came back, and says he, I guess  it's done. Now says the captain, look here, pilot, here's  a rope you hant seed yet, I'll jist explain the use of  it to you in case you want the loan of it. If this here  frigate, manned with our free and enlightened citizens,  gets aground, I'll give you a ride on the slack of that  are rope, right up to that yard by the neck, by Gum.  Well, it rub'd all the writin out of his face, as quick  as spittin on a slate takes a sum out, you may depend.  Now, they should rig up a crane over the street door of  the State house at Halifax, and when any of the pilots  at either eend of the buildin, run 'em on the breakers  on purpose, string em up like an onsafe dog. A sign of  that are kind, with \"a house of public entertainment,\"  painted under it, would do the business in less than no  time. If it would'nt keep the hawks out of the poultry  yard, it's a pity--it would scare them out of a year's  growth, that's a fact--if they used it once, I guess they  would'nt have occasion for it agin in a hurry--it would  be like the Aloe tree, and that bears fruit only once in  a hundred years. If you want to know how to act any time,  squire, never go to books, leave them to galls and school  boys; but go right off and cypher it out of natur, that's  a sure guide, it will never deceive you, you may depend.  For instance, \"what's that to me,\" is a phrase so common  that it shows it's a natural one, when people have no  particular interest in a thing. Well, when a feller gets  so warm on either side as never to use that phrase at  all, watch him, that's all! keep your eye on him, or  he'll walk right into you afore you know where you be.  If a man runs to me and says, \"your fence is down,\" thank  you, says I, that's kind--if he comes agin and says, \"I  guess some stray cattle have broke into your short sarce  garden,\" I thank him again; says I, come now, this is  neighborly; but when he keeps etarnally tellin me this  thing of one sarvant, and that thing of another sarvant,  hints that my friends ant true, that my neighbors are  inclined to take advantage of me, and that suspicious  folks are seen about my place, I say to myself, what on  airth makes this critter take such a wonderful interest  in my affairs? I don't like to hear such tales--he's  arter somethin as sure as the world, if he war'nt he'd  say, \"What's that to me.\" I never believe much what I  hear said by a man's VIOLENT FRIEND, or VIOLENT ENEMY,  I want to hear what a disinterested man has to say--now,  as a disinterested man, I say if the members of the House  of Assembly, instead of raisin up ghosts and hobgoblins  to frighten folks with, and to shew what swordsmen they  be, a cuttin and a thrustin at phantoms that only exist  in their own brains, would turn to, heart and hand, and  develope the resources of this fine country, facilitate  the means of transport--promote its internal improvement,  and entourage its foreign trade, they would make it the  richest and greatest, as it now is one of the happiest  sections of all America--I hope I may be skinned if they  would'nt--they would I swan.          No. XIX    The Clockmaker Quilts a Blue Nose.    The descendants of Eve have profited little by her example.  The curiosity of the fair sex is still insatiable, and,  as it is often ill directed, it frequently terminates in  error. In the country this feminine propensity is  troublesome to a traveller, and he who would avoid  importunities, would do well to announce at once, on his  arrival at a Cumberland Inn, his name and his business,  the place of his abode and the length of his visit. Our  beautiful hostess, Mrs. Pugwash, as she took her seat at  the breakfast table this morning, exhibited the example  that suggested these reflections. She was struck with  horror at our conversation, the latter part only of which  she heard, and of course misapplied and misunderstood.  She was run down by the President, said I, and has been  laid up for some time. Gulard's people have stripped her,  in consequence of her making water so fast. Stripped  whom? said Mrs. Pugwash, as she suddenly dropped the  teapot from her hand; stripped whom,--for heaven's sake  tell me who it is? The Lady Ogle, said I. Lady Ogle, said  she, how horrid! Two of her ribs were so broken as to  require to be replaced with new ones. Two new ribs, said  she, well I never heer'd the beat of that in all my born  days; poor critter, how she must have suffered. On  examining her below the waist they found--Examining her  still lower, said she (all the pride of her sex revolting  at the idea of such an indecent exhibition,) you don't  pretend to say they stripped her below the waist; what  did the Admiral say? Did he stand by and see her handled  in that way? The Admiral, madam, said I, did not trouble  his head about it. They found her extremely unsound there,  and much worm eaten. Worm eaten, she continued, how awful!  it must have been them nasty jiggers, that got in there;  they tell me they are dreadful thick in the West Indies;  Joe Crow had them in his feet, and lost two of his toes.  Worm eaten, dear, dear!! but still that aint so bad as  having them great he fellows strip one. I promise you if  them Gulards had undertaken to strip me, I'd a taught  them different guess manners; I'd a died first before  I'd a submitted to it. I always heerd tell the English  quality ladies were awful bold, but I never heerd the  like o' that.    What on airth are you drivin at? said Mr. Slick. I never  seed you so much out in your latitude afore, marm, I vow.  We were talking of reparin a vessel, not strippin' a  woman, what under the sun could have put that are crotchet  into your head? She looked mortified and humbled at the  result of her own absurd curiosity, and soon quitted the  room. I thought I should have snorted right out two or  three times, said the Clockmaker; I had to pucker up my  mouth like the upper eend of a silk puss, to keep from  yawhawin in her face, to hear the critter let her clapper  run that fashion. She is not the first hand that has  caught a lobster, by puttin in her oar afore her turn,  I guess. She'll mind her stops next hitch, I reckon.  This was our last breakfast at Amherst.    An early frost that smote the potatoe fields, and changed  the beautiful green color of the Indian corn into shades  of light yellow, and dark brown, reminded me of the  presence of autumn--of the season of short days and bad  roads, I determined to proceed at once to Parrsboro, and  thence by the Windsor and Kentville route to Annapolis,  Yarmouth, and Shelburne, and to return by the shore road,  through Liverpool and Lunenburg to Halifax. I therefore  took leave, (though not without much reluctance) of the  Clockmaker, whose intention had been to go to Fort  Lawrence. Well, said he, I vow I am sorry to part company  along with you; a considerable long journey like ourn,  is like sitting up late with the galls, a body knows its  getting on pretty well towards mornin, and yet feels loth  to go to bed, for its just the time folks grow sociable.    I got a scheme in my head, said he, that I think will  answer both on us; I got debts due to me in all them are  places for Clocks sold by the concarn, now suppose you  leave your horse on these mashes this fall, he'll get as  fat as a fool, he wont be able to see out of his eyes in  a month, and I'll put \"Old Clay,\" (I call him Clay arter  our senator, who is a prime bit of stuff) into a Yankee  waggon I have here, and drive you all round the coast.  This was too good an offer to be declined. A run at  grass for my horse, an easy and comfortable waggon, and  a guide so original and amusing as Mr. Slick, were either  of them enough to induce my acquiescence.    As soon as we had taken our seats in the waggon, he  observed, we shall progress real handsum now; that are  horse goes etarnal fast, he near about set my axle on  fire twice. He's a spanker you may depend. I had him  when he was a two year old, all legs and tail, like a  devil's darnin needle, and had him broke on purpose by  father's old nigger, January Snow. He knows English real  well, and can do near about any thing but speak it. He  helped me once to ginn a Blue Nose a proper handsum  quiltin. He must have stood a poor chance indeed, said  I, a horse kickin, and a man striking him at the same  time. Oh! not arter that pattern at all, said he, Lord  if \"Old Clay\" had a kicked him, he'd a smashed him like  that are sarcer you broke at Pugnose's inn, into ten  hundred thousand million flinders. Oh! no, if I did'nt  fix his flint for him in fair play it's a pity. I'll tell  you how it was. I was up to Truro, at Ezra Whitter's Inn.  There was an arbitration there atween Deacon Text and  Deacon Faithful. Well, there was a nation sight of folks  there, for they said it was a biter bit, and they came  to witness the sport, and to see which critter would get  the earmark.    Well, I'd been doin a little business there among the  folks, and had jist sot off for the river, mounted on  \"Old Clay,\" arter takin a glass of Ezra's most particular  handsum Jamaiky, and was trottin off pretty slick, when  who should I run agin but Tim Bradley. He is a dreadful  ugly cross grained critter, as you een amost ever seed,  when he is about half shaved. Well, I stopped short, and  says, I, Mr. Bradley, I hope you beant hurt; I'm proper  sorry I run agin you, you cant feel uglier than I do  about it, I do assure you.

It might be said that his belief is a relation to a different object,  namely 'that Desdemona loves Cassio'; but it is almost as difficult to  suppose that there is such an object as this, when Desdemona does not  love Cassio, as it was to suppose that there is 'Desdemona's love for  Cassio'. Hence it will be better to seek for a theory of belief which  does not make it consist in a relation of the mind to a single object.    It is common to think of relations as though they always held between  two terms, but in fact this is not always the case. Some relations  demand three terms, some four, and so on. Take, for instance, the  relation 'between'. So long as only two terms come in, the relation  'between' is impossible: three terms are the smallest number that render  it possible. York is between London and Edinburgh; but if London and  Edinburgh were the only places in the world, there could be nothing  which was between one place and another. Similarly _jealousy_ requires  three people: there can be no such relation that does not involve three  at least. Such a proposition as 'A wishes B to promote C's marriage with  D' involves a relation of four terms; that is to say, A and B and C and  D all come in, and the relation involved cannot be expressed otherwise  than in a form involving all four. Instances might be multiplied  indefinitely, but enough has been said to show that there are relations  which require more than two terms before they can occur.    The relation involved in _judging_ or _believing_ must, if falsehood is  to be duly allowed for, be taken to be a relation between several terms,  not between two. When Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio, he  must not have before his mind a single object, 'Desdemona's love for  Cassio', or 'that Desdemona loves Cassio ', for that would require that  there should be objective falsehoods, which subsist independently of  any minds; and this, though not logically refutable, is a theory to be  avoided if possible. Thus it is easier to account for falsehood if  we take judgement to be a relation in which the mind and the various  objects concerned all occur severally; that is to say, Desdemona and  loving and Cassio must all be terms in the relation which subsists when  Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio. This relation, therefore,  is a relation of four terms, since Othello also is one of the terms of  the relation. When we say that it is a relation of four terms, we do not  mean that Othello has a certain relation to Desdemona, and has the same  relation to loving and also to Cassio. This may be true of some other  relation than believing; but believing, plainly, is not a relation which  Othello has to _each_ of the three terms concerned, but to _all_ of  them together: there is only one example of the relation of believing  involved, but this one example knits together four terms. Thus the  actual occurrence, at the moment when Othello is entertaining his  belief, is that the relation called 'believing' is knitting together  into one complex whole the four terms Othello, Desdemona, loving, and  Cassio. What is called belief or judgement is nothing but this relation  of believing or judging, which relates a mind to several things other  than itself. An _act_ of belief or of judgement is the occurrence  between certain terms at some particular time, of the relation of  believing or judging.    We are now in a position to understand what it is that distinguishes a  true judgement from a false one. For this purpose we will adopt certain  definitions. In every act of judgement there is a mind which judges, and  there are terms concerning which it judges. We will call the mind the  _subject_ in the judgement, and the remaining terms the _objects_. Thus,  when Othello judges that Desdemona loves Cassio, Othello is the subject,  while the objects are Desdemona and loving and Cassio. The subject and  the objects together are called the _constituents_ of the judgement.  It will be observed that the relation of judging has what is called a  'sense' or 'direction'. We may say, metaphorically, that it puts its  objects in a certain _order_, which we may indicate by means of the  order of the words in the sentence. (In an inflected language, the same  thing will be indicated by inflections, e.g. by the difference between  nominative and accusative.) Othello's judgement that Cassio loves  Desdemona differs from his judgement that Desdemona loves Cassio, in  spite of the fact that it consists of the same constituents, because the  relation of judging places the constituents in a different order in the  two cases. Similarly, if Cassio judges that Desdemona loves Othello,  the constituents of the judgement are still the same, but their order is  different. This property of having a 'sense' or 'direction' is one which  the relation of judging shares with all other relations. The 'sense'  of relations is the ultimate source of order and series and a host of  mathematical concepts; but we need not concern ourselves further with  this aspect.    We spoke of the relation called 'judging' or 'believing' as knitting  together into one complex whole the subject and the objects. In this  respect, judging is exactly like every other relation. Whenever a  relation holds between two or more terms, it unites the terms into a  complex whole. If Othello loves Desdemona, there is such a complex whole  as 'Othello's love for Desdemona'. The terms united by the relation may  be themselves complex, or may be simple, but the whole which results  from their being united must be complex. Wherever there is a relation  which relates certain terms, there is a complex object formed of the  union of those terms; and conversely, wherever there is a complex  object, there is a relation which relates its constituents. When an act  of believing occurs, there is a complex, in which 'believing' is the  uniting relation, and subject and objects are arranged in a certain  order by the 'sense' of the relation of believing. Among the objects,  as we saw in considering 'Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio',  one must be a relation--in this instance, the relation 'loving'. But  this relation, as it occurs in the act of believing, is not the relation  which creates the unity of the complex whole consisting of the subject  and the objects. The relation 'loving', as it occurs in the act of  believing, is one of the objects--it is a brick in the structure, not  the cement. The cement is the relation 'believing'. When the belief is  _true_, there is another complex unity, in which the relation which was  one of the objects of the belief relates the other objects. Thus, e.g.,  if Othello believes _truly_ that Desdemona loves Cassio, then there is  a complex unity, 'Desdemona's love for Cassio', which is composed  exclusively of the _objects_ of the belief, in the same order as they  had in the belief, with the relation which was one of the objects  occurring now as the cement that binds together the other objects of the  belief. On the other hand, when a belief is _false_, there is no such  complex unity composed only of the objects of the belief. If Othello  believes _falsely_ that Desdemona loves Cassio, then there is no such  complex unity as 'Desdemona's love for Cassio'.    Thus a belief is _true_ when it _corresponds_ to a certain associated  complex, and _false_ when it does not. Assuming, for the sake of  definiteness, that the objects of the belief are two terms and a  relation, the terms being put in a certain order by the 'sense' of  the believing, then if the two terms in that order are united by the  relation into a complex, the belief is true; if not, it is false. This  constitutes the definition of truth and falsehood that we were in search  of. Judging or believing is a certain complex unity of which a mind is  a constituent; if the remaining constituents, taken in the order which  they have in the belief, form a complex unity, then the belief is true;  if not, it is false.    Thus although truth and falsehood are properties of beliefs, yet they  are in a sense extrinsic properties, for the condition of the truth of  a belief is something not involving beliefs, or (in general) any mind  at all, but only the _objects_ of the belief. A mind, which believes,  believes truly when there is a _corresponding_ complex not involving the  mind, but only its objects. This correspondence ensures truth, and its  absence entails falsehood. Hence we account simultaneously for the two  facts that beliefs (a) depend on minds for their _existence_, (b) do not  depend on minds for their _truth_.    We may restate our theory as follows: If we take such a belief as  'Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio', we will call Desdemona  and Cassio the _object-terms_, and loving the _object-relation_. If  there is a complex unity 'Desdemona's love for Cassio', consisting of  the object-terms related by the object-relation in the same order as  they have in the belief, then this complex unity is called the _fact  corresponding to the belief_. Thus a belief is true when there is a  corresponding fact, and is false when there is no corresponding fact.    It will be seen that minds do not _create_ truth or falsehood. They  create beliefs, but when once the beliefs are created, the mind cannot  make them true or false, except in the special case where they concern  future things which are within the power of the person believing, such  as catching trains. What makes a belief true is a _fact_, and this fact  does not (except in exceptional cases) in any way involve the mind of  the person who has the belief.    Having now decided what we _mean_ by truth and falsehood, we have next  to consider what ways there are of knowing whether this or that belief  is true or false. This consideration will occupy the next chapter.        CHAPTER XIII. KNOWLEDGE, ERROR, AND PROBABLE OPINION"]]]
