With Abronia umbellata one of the cotyledons is quite rudimentary, as may  be seen (c') in Fig. 61. In this specimen it consisted of a little green  flap, 1/84th inch in length, destitute of a petiole and covered with glands  like those on the fully developed cotyledon (c). At first it stood opposite  to the larger cotyledon; but as the petiole of the latter increased in  length and grew in the same line with the hypocotyl (h), the rudiment  appeared in older seedlings as if seated some way down the hypocotyl. With  Abronia arenaria there is a similar rudiment, which in one    * In Pachira aquatica, as described by Mr. R. I. Lynch ('Journal Linn. Soc.  Bot.' vol. xvii. 1878, p. 147), one of the hypogean cotyledons is of  immense size; the other is small and soon falls off; the pair do not always  stand opposite. In another and very different water-plant, 'Trapa natans',  one of the cotyledons, filled with farinaceous matter, is much larger than  the other, which is scarcely visible, as is stated by Aug. de Candolle,  'Physiologie Veg.' tom. ii. p. 834, 1832.  [page 96]    specimen was only 1/100th and in another 1/60th inch in length; it  ultimately appeared as if seated halfway down the hypocotyl. In both these  species the hypocotyl is so much enlarged, especially at a very early age,  that it might almost be called a corm. The lower end forms a heel or  projection, the use of which will hereafter be described.     In Cyclamen Persicum the hypocotyl, even whilst still within the seed, is  enlarged into a regular corm,* and only a single cotyledon is at first  developed (see former Fig. 57). With Ranunculus ficaria two cotyledons are  never produced, and here one of the secondary radicles is developed at an  early age into a so-called bulb.** Again, certain species of Chaerophyllum  and Corydalis produce only a single cotyledon;*** in the former the  hypocotyl, and in the latter the radicle is enlarged, according to Irmisch,  into a bulb.    In the several foregoing cases one of the cotyledons is delayed in its  development, or reduced in size, or rendered rudimentary, or quite aborted;  but in other cases both cotyledons are represented by mere rudiments. With  Opuntia basilaris this is not the case, for both cotyledons are thick and  large, and the hypocotyl shows at first no signs of enlargement; but  afterwards, when the cotyledons have withered and disarticulated  themselves, it becomes thickened, and from its tapering form, together with  its smooth, tough, brown skin, appears, when ultimately drawn down to some  depth into the soil, like a root. On the other    * Dr. H. Gressner, 'Bot. Zeitung,' 1874, p. 824.    ** Irmisch, 'Beitr√§ge zur Morphologie der Pflanzen,' 1854, pp. 11, 12;  'Bot. Zeitung,' 1874, p. 805.    *** Delpino, 'Rivista Botanica,' 1877, p. 21. It is evident from Vaucher's  account ('Hist. Phys. des Plantes d'Europe,' tom. i. 1841, p. 149) of the  germination of the seeds of several species of Corydalis, that the bulb or  tubercule begins to be formed at an extremely early age.  [page 97]    hand, with several other Cacteae, the hypocotyl is from the first much  enlarged, and both cotyledons are almost or quite rudimentary. Thus with  Cereus Landbeckii two little triangular projections, representing the  cotyledons, are narrower than the hypocotyl, which is pear-shaped, with the  point downwards. In Rhipsalis cassytha the cotyledons are represented by  mere points on the enlarged hypocotyl. In Echinocactus viridescens the  hypocotyl is globular, with two little prominences on its summit. In  Pilocereus Houlletii the hypocotyl, much swollen in the upper part, is  merely notched on the summit; and each side of the notch evidently  represents a cotyledon. Stapelia sarpedon, a member of the very distinct  family of the Asclepiadeae, is fleshy like a cactus; and here again the  upper part of the flattened hypocotyl is much thickened and bears two  minute cotyledons, which, measured internally, were only .15 inch in  length, and in breadth not equal to one-fourth of the diameter of the  hypocotyl in its narrow axis; yet these minute cotyledons are probably not  quite useless, for when the hypocotyl breaks through the ground in the form  of an arch, they are closed or pressed against one another, and thus  protect the plumule. They afterwards open.    From the several cases now given, which refer to widely distinct plants, we  may infer that there is some close connection between the reduced size of  one or both cotyledons and the formation, by the enlargement of the  hypocotyl or of the radicle, of a so-called bulb. But it may be asked, did  the cotyledons first tend to abort, or did a bulb first begin to be formed?  As all dicotyledons naturally produce two well-developed cotyledons, whilst  the thickness of the hypocotyl and of the radicle differs much in different  plants, it seems probable that these latter organs first became from  [page 98]  some cause thickened--in several instances apparently in correlation with  the fleshy nature of the mature plant--so as to contain a store of  nutriment sufficient for the seedling, and then that one or both  cotyledons, from being superfluous, decreased in size. It is not surprising  that one cotyledon alone should sometimes have been thus affected, for with  certain plants, for instance the cabbage, the cotyledons are at first of  unequal size, owing apparently to the manner in which they are packed  within the seed. It does not, however, follow from the above connection,  that whenever a bulb is formed at an early age, one or both cotyledons will  necessarily become superfluous, and consequently more or less rudimentary.  Finally, these cases offer a good illustration of the principle of  compensation or balancement of growth, or, as Goethe expresses it, \"in  order to spend on one side, Nature is forced to economise on the other  side.\"    Circumnutation and other movements of Hypocotyls and Epicotyls, whilst  still arched and buried beneath the ground, and whilst breaking through  it.--According to the position in which a seed may chance to have been  buried, the arched hypocotyl or epicotyl will begin to protrude in a  horizontal, a more or less inclined, or in a vertical plane. Except when  already standing vertically upwards, both legs of the arch are acted on  from the earliest period by apogeotropism. Consequently they both bend  upwards until the arch becomes vertical. During the whole of this process,  even before the arch has broken through the ground, it is continually  trying to circumnutate to a slight extent; as it likewise does if it  happens at first to stand vertically up,--all which cases have been  observed and described, more or less fully, in the last chapter. After the  arch has grown to some  [page 99]  height upwards the basal part ceases to circumnutate, whilst the upper part  continues to do so.    That an arched hypocotyl or epicotyl, with the two legs fixed in the  ground, should be able to circumnutate, seemed to us, until we had read  Prof. Wiesner's observations, an inexplicable fact. He has shown* in the  case of certain seedlings, whose tips are bent downwards (or which nutate),  that whilst the posterior side of the upper or dependent portion grows  quickest, the anterior and opposite side of the basal portion of the same  internode grows quickest; these two portions being separated by an  indifferent zone, where the growth is equal on all sides. There may be even  more than one indifferent zone in the same internode; and the opposite  sides of the parts above and below each such zone grow quickest. This  peculiar manner of growth is called by Wiesner \"undulatory nutation.\"  Circumnutation depends on one side of an organ growing quickest (probably  preceded by increased turgescence), and then another side, generally almost  the opposite one, growing quickest. Now if we look at an arch like this  [upside down U] and suppose the whole of one side--we will say the whole  convex side of both legs--to increase in length, this would not cause the  arch to bend to either side. But if the outer side or surface of the left  leg were to increase in length the arch would be pushed over to the right,  and this would be aided by the inner side of the right leg increasing in  length. If afterwards the process were reversed, the arch would be pushed  over to the opposite or left side, and so on alternately,--that is, it  would circumnutate. As an arched hypo-    * 'Die undulirende Nutation der Internodien,' Akad. der Wissench. (Vienna),  Jan. 17th, 1878. Also published separately, see p. 32.  [page 100]    cotyl, with the two legs fixed in the ground, certainly circumnutates, and  as it consists of a single internode, we may conclude that it grows in the  manner described by Wiesner. It may be added, that the crown of the arch  does not grow, or grows very slowly, for it does not increase much in  breadth, whilst the arch itself increases greatly in height.    The circumnutating movements of arched hypocotyls and epicotyls can hardly  fail to aid them in breaking through the ground, if this be damp and soft;  though no doubt their emergence depends mainly on the force exerted by  their longitudinal growth. Although the arch circumnutates only to a slight  extent and probably with little force, yet it is able to move the soil near  the surface, though it may not be able to do so at a moderate depth. A pot  with seeds of Solanum palinacanthum, the tall arched hypocotyls of which  had emerged and were growing rather slowly, was covered with fine  argillaceous sand kept damp, and this at first closely surrounded the bases  of the arches; but soon a narrow open crack was formed round each of them,  which could be accounted for only by their having pushed away the sand on  all sides; for no such cracks surrounded some little sticks and pins which  had been driven into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5632"],[0,"Five Little Peppers Midway (#20)"],[1,"noticed,\" said Mrs. Chatterton indifferently.  \"Hortense always arranges my hair better without lace. If you can't  find what I ask you, Marian,\" raising her voice to a higher key, \"you  needn't trouble to read at all.\"    Fortunately the description of the gown worn by Lady Hartly Cavendish  at a London high tea, stood out in bold relief, as Mrs. Whitney's eyes  nervously ran over the columns again, and she seized upon it.    But in just two moments she was interrupted. \"Send that girl back  again, Marian,\" cried Mrs. Chatterton. \"I had just got her trained so  that she suits me. It tires me to death to hear you.\"    \"I do not know whether Polly can come now,\" said Mrs. Whitney gently;  \"she\"--    \"Do not know whether Polly can come!\" repeated Mrs. Chatterton sharply,  and leaning forward in her chair. \"Didn't I say I wanted her?\"    \"You did.\" Marian's tone did not lose a note of its ordinary  gentleness. \"But I shall ask her if she is willing to do it as a favor,  Mrs. Chatterton; you quite understand that, of course?\" She, too,  leaned forward in her chair, and gazed into the cold, hard face.    \"Just like your father,\" cried Mrs. Chatterton, settling herself  irascibly back in the chair-depths again. \"There is no hope that  affairs in this house will mend. I wash my hands of you.\"    \"I am so glad that you consider me like my father,\" said Mrs. Whitney  gleefully as a child. \"We surely are united on this question.\"    \"May I read some more?\" cried Polly, coming in softly, and trying to  calm the impetuous rush of delight as her eyes met Mrs. Whitney's.    \"Yes; I am waiting for you,\" said Mrs. Chatterton. \"Begin where you  left off.\"    Mrs. Whitney bit her pretty lips and slipped out of her chair, just  pausing a moment to lay her hand on the young shoulder as she passed,  and a world of comfort fell upon Polly, shut in once more to her dreary  task.    \"How perfectly splendid that I didn't go to Silvia Home's luncheon  party now!\" cried Polly's heart over and over between the lines. \"If I  had, I should have missed dear Auntie's home-coming, and Dicky's.\" She  glanced up with luminous eyes as she whirled the sheet. Mrs.  Chatterton, astonishing as it may seem, was actually smiling.    \"It's some comfort to hear you read,\" she observed with a sigh of  enjoyment, \"because you enjoy it yourself. I wouldn't give a fig for  anybody to try to do it.\"    Polly felt like a guilty little thing to take this quietly, and she  eased her conscience by being more glad that she was in that very room  doing that very task. And so the moments sped on.    Outside, Dick was holding high revel as every one revolved around him,  the hero of the coasting accident, till the boy ran considerable danger  from all the attention he was receiving. But one glance and a smile  from Mrs. Whitney brought him back to himself.    \"Don't talk any more about it,\" he cried a trifle impatiently. \"I was a  muff to stick on, when I knew we were going over. Mamma, won't you stop  them?\"    And she did.    \"Do you know, Dicky and I have a secret to tell all of you good  people.\" The color flew into her soft cheek, and her eyes beamed.    \"Really, Marian,\" said her father, whose hand had scarcely ceased  patting Dick's brown head since the boy's home-coming, \"you've grown  young in Badgertown. I never saw you look so well as you do to-day.\"    Mrs. Whitney laughed and tossed him a gay little smile, that carried  him back to the days when Marian King stood before him looking just so.    \"Now listen, father, and all you good people, to my secret--Dicky's and  mine; we are allowed to tell it now. Papa Whitney sailed in the Servia,  and he ought to be in to-day!\"    A shout of joy greeted her announcement. Polly, off in her prison,  could hear the merry sounds, and her happy heart echoed them. The  misery of the past week, when she had been bearing an unatoned fault,  seemed to drop away from her as she listened, and to say, \"Life holds  sunshine yet.\"    Then a hush dropped upon the gay uproar. She did not know that Dicky  was proclaiming \"Yes, and he is never, never going back again. That is,  unless he takes mamma and me, you know.\"    Mrs. Chatterton turned suddenly upon the young figure.    \"Do go!\" She tossed an imperative command with her jeweled fingers.  \"You have ceased to be amusing since your interest is all in the other  room with that boy.\"    Polly dashed the newspaper to the floor, and rushing impulsively across  the room, threw herself, with no thought for the consequences, on her  knees at Mrs. Chatterton's chair.    \"Oh--oh!\" she cried, the color flying up to the brown waves on her  temples, \"don't send me off; then I shall know you never will forgive  me.\"    \"Get up, do!\" exclaimed Mrs. Chatterton, in disgust; \"you are crushing  my gown, and besides I hate scenes.\"    But Polly held resolutely to the chair-arm, and never took her brown  eyes from the cold face.    \"I must say, Polly Pepper,\" cried Mrs. Chatterton with rising anger,  \"you are the most disagreeable girl that I ever had the misfortune to  meet. I, for one, will not put up with your constant ebullitions of  temper. Go out of this room!\"    Polly rose slowly and drew herself up with something so new in face and  manner that the old lady instinctively put up her eyeglass and gazed  curiously through it, as one would look at a strange animal.    \"Humph!\" she said slowly at last, \"well, what do you want to say? Speak  out, and then go.\"    \"Nothing,\" said Polly in a low voice, but quite distinctly, \"only I  shall not trouble you again, Mrs. Chatterton.\" And as the last words  were spoken, she was out of the room.    \"Pretty doings these!\" Mr. King, by a dexterous movement, succeeded in  slipping back of the portiere folds into the little writing-room, as  Polly rushed out through the other doorway into the hall. \"A fortunate  thing it was that I left Dick, to see what had become of Polly. Now,  Cousin Eunice, you move from my house!\" and descending the stairs, he  called determinedly, \"Polly, Polly, child!\"    Polly, off in her own room now, heard him, and for the first time in  her life, wished she need not answer.    \"Polly--Polly!\" the determined call rang down the passage, causing her  to run fast with a \"Yes, Grandpapa, I'm coming.\"    \"Now, I should just like to inquire,\" began Mr. King, taking her by her  two young shoulders and looking down into the flushed face, \"what she  has been saying to you.\" \"Oh, Grandpapa!\" down went Polly's brown head,  \"don't make me tell. Please don't, Grandpapa.\"    \"I shall!\" declared Mr. King; \"every blessed word. Now begin!\"    \"She--she wanted me to go out of the room,\" said Polly, in a reluctant  gasp.    \"Indeed!\" snorted Mr. King. \"Well, she will soon go out of that room.  Indeed, I might say, out of the house.\"    \"Oh, Grandpapa!\" exclaimed Polly, in great distress, and raising the  brown eyes--he was dismayed to find them filling with tears--\"don't,  don't send her away! It is all my fault; indeed it is, Grandpapa!\"    \"Your fault,\" cried Mr. King irately; \"you must not say such things,  child; that's silly; you don't know the woman.\"    \"Grandpapa,\" cried Polly, holding back the storm of tears to get the  words out, \"I never told you--I couldn't--but I said perfectly dreadful  words to her a week ago. Oh, Grandpapa! I did, truly.\"    \"That's right,\" said the old gentleman in a pleased tone. \"What were  they, pray tell? Let us know.\"    \"Oh, Grandpapa, don't!\" begged Polly, with a shiver; \"I want to forget  them.\"    \"If you would only follow them up with more,\" said Mr. King  meditatively; \"when it comes to tears, she must march, you know.\"    \"I won't cry,\" said Polly, swallowing the lump in her throat, \"if you  will only let her stay.\"    She turned to him such a distressed and white face that Mr. King stood  perplexedly looking down at her, having nothing to say.    \"I'm tired of her,\" at last he said; \"we are all tired of her; she has  about worn us out.\"    \"Grandpapa,\" cried Polly, seeing her advantage in his hesitation, \"if  you will only let her stay, I will never beg you for anything again.\"    \"Well, then she goes,\" cried Mr. King shortly. \"Goodness me, Polly, if  you are going to stop asking favors, Cousin Eunice marches instanter!\"    \"Oh! I'll beg and tease for ever so many things,\" cried Polly  radiantly, her color coming back. \"Will you let her stay,  Grandpapa--will you?\" She clasped his arm tightly and would not let him  go.    \"Well,\" said Mr. King slowly, \"I'll think about it, Polly.\"    \"Will you?\" cried Polly. \"Dear Grandpapa, please say yes.\"    Mr. King drew a long breath. \"Yes,\" he said at last.          XIII    A PIECE OF NEWS      \"Collect the whole bunch of Peppers and send them into my writing-room,  Marian.\" Old Mr. King mounting the stairs, turned to see that his  command was heard.    \"You want Mother Pepper too, I presume?\" said Mrs. Whitney, pausing at  the foot.    \"Mother Pepper? No, indeed; the last person in the world I wish to  see,\" cried her father irritably. \"The bunch of Pepper children, I  want, and at once; see that they all report to me directly.\" With that  he redoubled his efforts and was soon at the top of the long oaken  steps.    Polly and Ben closely followed by Joel, David and Phronsie soon rushed  over the same ascending thoroughfare, and presented themselves, flushed  and panting, at the writing-room door.    \"Come in,\" called Mr. King from within.    \"Here we are, sir,\" said Ben, spokesman by virtue of being the eldest.    \"Yes, yes,\" said Mr. King nervously, and turning away from some papers  he was fumbling to occupy the waiting moments. \"Well, do sit down, all  of you. I sent for you to have a talk about something that you--that  you--well, do sit down.\"    So all the Peppers deposited themselves in various resting-places; all  but Joel. He immediately marched up to the old gentleman's chair.    \"If it's good news,\" he said abruptly, \"please let us have"]]]
