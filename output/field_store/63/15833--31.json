In the  stern discharge of his duty he made some bitter enemies, among them  Henry M. Naglee, who, in the newspapers of the day, endeavored to  damage his fair name.  But, knowing him intimately, I am certain  that he is entitled to all praise for having so controlled the  affairs of the country that, when his successor arrived, all things  were so disposed that a civil form of government was an easy matter  of adjustment.  Colonel Mason was relieved by General Riley some  time in April, and left California in the steamer of the 1st May for  Washington and St. Louis, where he died of cholera in the summer of  1850, and his body is buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery. His widow  afterward married Major (since General) Don Carlos Buell, and is now  living in Kentucky.    In overhauling the hold of the steamer California, as she lay at  anchor in Monterey Bay, a considerable amount of coal was found  under some heavy duplicate machinery.  With this, and such wood as  had been gathered, she was able to renew her voyage.  The usual  signal was made, and we all went on board.  About the 1st of March  we entered the Heads, and anchored off San Francisco, near the  United States line-of-battle-ship Ohio, Commodore T. Catesby Jones.  As was the universal custom of the day, the crew of the California  deserted her; and she lay for months unable to make a trip back to  Panama, as was expected of her.  As soon as we reached San  Francisco, the first thing was to secure an office and a house to  live in.  The weather was rainy and stormy, and snow even lay on  the hills back of the Mission.  Captain Folsom, the quartermaster,  agreed to surrender for our office the old adobe custom house, on  the upper corner of the plaza, as soon as he could remove his  papers and effects down to one of his warehouses on the beach; and  he also rented for us as quarters the old Hudson Bay Company house  on Montgomery Street, which had been used by Howard & Mellua as a  store, and at that very time they were moving their goods into a  larger brick building just completed for them.  As these changes  would take some time, General Smith and Colonel Ogden, with their  wives, accepted the hospitality offered by Commodore Jones on board  the Ohio.  I opened the office at the custom house, and Gibbs,  Fitzgerald, and some others of us, slept in the loft of the Hudson  Bay Company house until the lower part was cleared of Howard's  store, after which General Smith and the ladies moved in.  There we  had a general mess, and the efforts at house-keeping were simply  ludicrous.  One servant after another, whom General Smith had  brought from New Orleans, with a solemn promise to stand by him for  one whole year, deserted without a word of notice or explanation,  and in a few days none remained but little Isaac.  The ladies had  no maid or attendants; and the general, commanding all the mighty  forces of the United States on the Pacific coast, had to scratch to  get one good meal a day for his family!  He was a gentleman of fine  social qualities, genial and gentle, and joked at every thing.  Poor Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Ogden did not bear it so philosophically.  Gibbs, Fitzgerald, and I, could cruise around and find a meal,  which cost three dollars, at some of the many restaurants which had  sprung up out of red-wood boards and cotton lining; but the general  and ladies could not go out, for ladies were rara aves at that day  in California.  Isaac was cook, chamber-maid, and everything,  thoughtless of himself, and struggling, out of the slimmest means,  to compound a breakfast for a large and hungry family.  Breakfast  would be announced any time between ten and twelve, and dinner  according to circumstances.  Many a time have I seen General Smith,  with a can of preserved meat in his hands, going toward the house,  take off his hat on meeting a negro, and, on being asked the reason  of his politeness, he would answer that they were the only real  gentlemen in California.  I confess that the fidelity of Colonel  Mason's boy \"Aaron,\" and of General Smith's boy \"Isaac,\" at a time  when every white man laughed at promises as something made to be  broken, has given me a kindly feeling of respect for the negroes,  and makes me hope that they will find an honorable \"status\" in the  jumble of affairs in which we now live.    That was a dull hard winter in San Francisco; the rains were heavy,  and the mud fearful.  I have seen mules stumble in the street, and  drown in the liquid mud!  Montgomery Street had been filled up with  brush and clay, and I always dreaded to ride on horseback along it,  because the mud was so deep that a horse's legs would become  entangled in the bushes below, and the rider was likely to be  thrown and drowned in the mud.  The only sidewalks were made of  stepping-stones of empty boxes, and here and there a few planks  with barrel-staves nailed on.  All the town lay along Montgomery  Street, from Sacramento to Jackson, and about the plaza.  Gambling  was the chief occupation of the people.  While they were waiting  for the cessation of the rainy season, and for the beginning of  spring, all sorts of houses were being put up, but of the most  flimsy kind, and all were stores, restaurants, or gambling  -saloons.  Any room twenty by sixty feet would rent for a thousand  dollars a month.  I had, as my pay, seventy dollars a month, and no  one would even try to hire a servant under three hundred dollars.  Had it not been for the fifteen hundred dollars I had made in the  store at Coloma, I could not have lived through the winter.  About  the 1st of April arrived the steamer Oregon; but her captain  (Pearson) knew what was the state of affairs on shore, and ran his  steamer alongside the line-of-battle-ship Ohio at Saucelito, and  obtained the privilege of leaving his crew on board as \"prisoners\"  until he was ready to return to sea.  Then, discharging his  passengers and getting coal out of some of the ships which had  arrived, he retook his crew out of limbo and carried the first  regular mail back to Panama early in April.  In regular order  arrived the third steamer, the Panama; and, as the vessels were  arriving with coal, The California was enabled to hire a crew and  get off.  From that time forward these three ships constituted the  regular line of mail-steamers, which has been kept up ever since.  By the steamer Oregon arrived out Major R. P. Hammond, J. M.  Williams, James Blair, and others; also the gentlemen who, with  Major Ogden, were to compose a joint commission to select the sites  for the permanent forts and navyyard of California.  This  commission was composed of Majors Ogden, Smith, and Leadbetter, of,  the army, and Captains Goldsborough, Van Brunt, and Blunt, of the  navy.  These officers, after a most careful study of the whole  subject, selected Mare Island for the navy-yard, and \"Benicia\" for  the storehouses and arsenals of the army.  The Pacific Mail  Steamship Company also selected Benicia as their depot.  Thus was  again revived the old struggle for supremacy of these  two points  as the site of the future city of the Pacific.  Meantime, however,  San Francisco had secured the name.  About six hundred ships were  anchored there without crews, and could not get away; and there the  city was, and had to be.    Nevertheless, General Smith, being disinterested and unprejudiced,  decided on Benicia as the point where the city ought to be, and  where the army headquarters should be.  By the Oregon there arrived  at San Francisco a man who deserves mention here--Baron  Steinberger.  He had been a great cattle-dealer in the United  States, and boasted that he had helped to break the United States  Bank, by being indebted to it five million dollars! At all events,  he was a splendid looking fellow, and brought with him from  Washington a letter to General Smith and another for Commodore  Jones, to the effect that he was a man of enlarged experience in  beef; that the authorities in Washington knew that there existed in  California large herds of cattle, which were only valuable for  their hides and tallow; that it was of great importance to the  Government that this beef should be cured and salted so as to be of  use to the army and navy, obviating the necessity of shipping  salt-beef around Cape Horn.  I know he had such a letter from the  Secretary of War, Marcy, to General Smith, for it passed into my  custody, and I happened to be in Commodore Jones's cabin when the  baron presented the one for him from the Secretary of the Navy.  The baron was anxious to pitch in at once, and said that all he  needed to start with were salt and barrels.  After some inquiries  of his purser, the commodore promised to let him have the barrels  with their salt, as fast as they were emptied by the crew.  Then  the baron explained that he could get a nice lot of cattle from Don  Timoteo Murphy, at the Mission of San Rafael, on the north aide of  the bay, but he could not get a boat and crew to handle them.  Under the authority from the Secretary of the Navy, the commodore  then promised him the use of a boat and crew, until he (the baron)  could find and purchase a suitable one for himself.  Then the baron  opened the first regular butcher-shop in San Francisco, on the  wharf about the foot of Broadway or Pacific Street, where we could  buy at twenty-five or fifty cents a pound the best roasts, steaks,  and cuts of beef, which had cost him nothing, for he never paid  anybody if he could help it, and he soon cleaned poor Don Timoteo  out.  At first, every boat of his, in coming down from the San  Rafael, touched at the Ohio, and left the best beefsteaks and  roasts for the commodore, but soon the baron had enough money to  dispense with the borrowed boat, and set up for himself, and from  this small beginning, step by step, he rose in a few months to be  one of the richest and most influential men in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4362"],[0,"Personal Memoirs of P. H. Sheridan, General, United States Army — Complete (#20)"],[1,"northern Mississippi, with which at this time we were scantily  furnished; so as soon as possible I compiled for the use of myself  and my regimental commanders an information map of the surrounding  country.  This map exhibited such details as country roads, streams,  farmhouses, fields, woods, and swamps, and such other topographical  features as would be useful.  I must confess that my crude sketch did  not evidence much artistic merit, but it was an improvement on what  we already possessed in the way of details to guide the command, and  this was what I most needed; for it was of the first importance that  in our exposed condition we should be equipped with a thorough  knowledge of the section in which we were operating, so as to be  prepared to encounter an enemy already indicating recovery from the  disorganizing effects of his recent retreat.    In the immediate vicinity of Booneville the country was covered with  heavy forests, with here and there clearings or intervening fields  that had been devoted to the cultivation of cotton and corn.  The  ground was of a low character, typical of northeastern Mississippi,  and abounded in small creeks that went almost totally dry even in  short periods of drought, but became flooded with muddy water under  the outpouring of rain peculiar to a semi-tropical climate.  In such  a region there were many chances of our being surprised, especially  by an enemy who knew the country well, and whose ranks were filled  with local guides; and great precautions as well as the fullest  information were necessary to prevent disaster.  I therefore  endeavored to familiarize all with our surroundings, but scarcely had  matters begun to shape themselves as I desired when our annihilation  was attempted by a large force of Confederate cavalry.    On the morning of July 1, 1862, a cavalry command of between five and  six thousand-men, under the Confederate General James R. Chalmers,  advanced on two roads converging near Booneville.  The head of the  enemy's column on the Blackland and Booneville road came in contact  with my pickets three miles and a half west of Booneville.  These  pickets, under Lieutenant Leonidas S. Scranton, of the Second  Michigan Cavalry, fell back slowly, taking advantage of every tree or  other cover to fire from till they arrived at the point where the  converging roads joined.  At this junction there was a strong  position in the protecting timber, and here Scranton made a firm  stand, being reinforced presently by the few men he had out as  pickets on the road to his left, a second company I had sent him from  camp, and subsequently by three companies more, all now commanded by  Captain Campbell.  This force was dismounted and formed in line, and  soon developed that the enemy was present in large numbers.  Up to  this time Chalmers had shown only the heads of his columns, and we  had doubts as to his purpose, but now that our resistance forced him  to deploy two regiments on the right and left of the road, it became  apparent that he meant business, and that there was no time to lose  in preparing to repel his attack.    Full information of the situation was immediately sent me, and I  directed Campbell to hold fast, if possible, till I could support  him, but if compelled to retire he was authorized to do so slowly,  taking advantage of every means that fell in his way to prolong the  fighting.  Before this I had stationed one battalion of the Second  Iowa in Booneville, but Colonel Edward Hatch, commanding that  regiment, was now directed to leave one company for the protection of  our camp a little to the north of the station, and take the balance  of the Second Iowa, with the battalion in Booneville except two sabre  companies, and form the whole in rear of Captain Campbell, to protect  his flanks and support him by a charge should the enemy break his  dismounted line.    While these preparations were being made, the Confederates attempted  to drive Campbell from his position by a direct attack through an  open field.  In this they failed, however, for our men, reserving  their fire until the enemy came within about thirty yards, then  opened on him with such a shower of bullets from our Colt's rifles  that it soon became too hot for him, and he was repulsed with  considerable loss.  Foiled in this move, Chalmers hesitated to attack  again in front, but began overlapping both flanks of Campbell's line  by force of numbers, compelling Campbell to retire toward a strong  position I had selected in his rear for a line on which to make our  main resistance.  As soon as the enemy saw this withdrawing he again  charged in front, but was again as gallantly repelled as in the first  assault, although the encounter was for a short time so desperate as  to have the character of a hand-to-hand conflict, several groups of  friend and foe using on each other the butts of their guns.  At this  juncture the timely arrival of Colonel Hatch with the Second Iowa  gave a breathing-spell to Campbell, and made the Confederates so  chary of further direct attacks that he was enabled to retire; and at  the same time I found opportunity to make disposition of the  reinforcement to the best advantage possible, placing the Second Iowa  on the left of the new line and strengthening Campbell on its right  with all the men available.    In view of his numbers, the enemy soon regained confidence in his  ability to overcome us, and in a little while again began his  flanking movements, his right passing around my left flank some  distance, and approaching our camp and transportation, which I had  forbidden to be moved out to the rear.  Fearing that he would envelop  us and capture the camp and transportation, I determined to take the  offensive.  Remembering a circuitous wood road that I had become  familiar with while making the map heretofore mentioned, I concluded  that the most effective plan would be to pass a small column around  the enemy's left, by way of this road, and strike his rear by a  mounted charge simultaneously with an advance of our main line on his  front.  I knew that the attack in rear would be a most hazardous  undertaking, but in the face of such odds as the enemy had the  condition of affairs was most critical, and could be relieved, only  by a bold and radical change in our tactics; so I at once selected  four sabre companies, two from the Second Michigan and two from the  Second Iowa, and placing Captain Alger, of the former regiment, in  command of them, I informed him that I expected of them the quick and  desperate work that is usually imposed on a forlorn hope.    To carry out the purpose now in view, I instructed Captain Alger to  follow the wood road as it led around the left of the enemy's  advancing forces, to a point where 'it joined the Blackland road,  about three miles from Booneville, and directed him, upon reaching  the Blackland road, to turn up it immediately, and charge the rear of  the enemy's line.  Under no circumstances was he to deploy the  battalion, but charge in column right through whatever he came upon,  and report to me in front of Booneville, if at all possible for him  to get there.  If he failed to break through the enemy's line, he was  to go ahead as far as he could, and then if any of his men were left,  and he was able to retreat, he was to do so by the same route he had  taken on his way out.  To conduct him on this perilous service I sent  along a thin, sallow, tawny-haired Mississippian named Beene, whom I  had employed as a guide and scout a few days before, on account of  his intimate knowledge of the roads, from the public thoroughfares  down to the insignificant by-paths of the neighboring swamps.  With  such guidance I felt sure that the column would get to the desired  point without delay, for there was no danger of its being lost or  misled by taking any of the many by-roads which traversed the dense  forests through which it would be obliged to pass.  I also informed  Alger that I should take the reserve and join the main line in front  of Booneville for the purpose of making an advance of my whole force,  and that as a signal he must have his men cheer loudly when he struck  the enemy's rear, in order that my attack might be simultaneous with  his.    I gave him one hour to go around and come back through the enemy, and  when he started I moved to the front with the balance of the reserve,  to put everything I had into the fight.  This meant an inestimable  advantage to the enemy in case of our defeat, but our own safety  demanded the hazard.  All along our attenuated line the fighting was  now sharp, and the enemy's firing indicated such numerical strength  that fear of disaster to Alger increased my anxiety terribly as the  time set for his cheering arrived and no sound of it was heard.    Relying, however, on the fact that Beene's knowledge of the roads  would prevent his being led astray, and confident of Alger's  determination to accomplish the purpose for which he set out, as soon  as the hour was up I ordered my whole line forward.  Fortunately,  just as this moment a locomotive and two cars loaded with grain for  my horses ran into Booneville from Corinth.  I say fortunately,  because it was well known throughout the command that in the morning,  when I first discovered the large numbers of the enemy, I had called  for assistance; and my troops, now thinking that reinforcements had  arrived by rail from Rienzi, where a division of infantry was  encamped, and inspirated by this belief, advanced with renewed  confidence and wild cheering.  Meantime I had the engineer of the  locomotive blow his whistle loudly, so that the enemy might also  learn that a train had come; and from the fact that in a few moments  he began to give way before our small force, I thought that this  strategem had some effect.  Soon his men broke, and ran in the utmost  disorder over the country in every direction."]]]
