As a first measure he  needed money, and saw no chance of obtaining it save by marrying  Isabella of Portugal, who would bring him a dowry of 1,000,000 golden  crowns. For this purpose he must free himself from the engagement of the  treaty of Windsor, by which he was betrothed to Mary of England. So he  acted as Wolsey was acting. He professed a great desire to carry out his  engagement as a means of getting rid of it, and sent ambassadors to ask  that Mary and her dowry should be given up to him, with a further loan  of 200,000 ducats.    The two embassies had crossed on the way, and Henry received Charles's  communication as an answer to his demands. In this way it served  Wolsey's purpose admirably, for it showed clearly enough that the  interests of Henry and Charles were not the same. Charles was bent upon  pursuing his own advantage, and was still willing to use Henry as a  useful ally; but Henry saw nothing to be gained from the alliance, and  the time had come when some tangible gain was to be secured from all his  expenditure. Hitherto he had been personally on Charles's side, but in  his conferences with the imperial envoys in the month of June he made it  clear that his patience was exhausted. Henceforth he accepted Wolsey's  views of peace with France. If Charles was striving to make what he  could out of the captivity of the French king, then England might as  well join in the scramble. The misfortune of France was England's  opportunity. If Charles was not willing to share his gains with Henry,  then Henry must pick up what he could for himself. It was an unwelcome  conclusion for Charles, who hoped to bring the pressure of irresistible  necessity to bear on his captive. If England also joined in the bidding  its competition would run down his price.    Moreover, this resolution of Henry made a great change in his domestic  relations. Queen Katharine was devoted to her nephew's interests, and  had exercised considerable influence over her husband. They talked  together about politics, and Henry liked to move amidst acquiescent  admiration. All that was now at an end, as Katharine could not change  her sympathies, and had not the tact to disguise her disapprobation.  From this time forward Henry did not treat her with the affection and  familiarity which had been his wont, and when he made up his mind he did  not scruple to emphasise his decision by his acts. He had not been a  faithful husband, but hitherto his infidelity had not been a cause of  domestic discord. He had an illegitimate son, Henry Fitzroy, by  Elizabeth Blunt, one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting; and on 15th June  he created this boy of six years old Duke of Richmond. This he did with  a display of pomp and ceremony which must have been very offensive to  the Queen; nor was the offence diminished when, a month afterwards, the  boy was created Lord High Admiral of England. Such an act was, to say  the least, a taunt to Katharine that she had borne no son; it was a  public proclamation of the king's disappointment and discontent with his  matrimonial lot. The luckless Katharine could make no complaint, and was  forced to submit to the king's will; but we cannot doubt that she put  down to Wolsey what was not his due, and that Wolsey had to bear the  hatred of her friends for the king's change of policy, and all that  flowed from it.    However, Wolsey's course was now clearly to dissolve the imperial  alliance without causing a breach. For this purpose he used Charles's  desire for his Portuguese marriage. He offered to release Charles from  his engagement to Mary on condition that the treaty was annulled, that  he paid his debts to Henry, and concluded a peace with France to  England's satisfaction. Charles refused to take any step so decided, and  the negotiations proceeded. But Wolsey's attention was not so much  directed to Charles as to France, where Louise, the king's mother, was  desperately striving to procure her son's release. In their dealings  with France there was a keen rivalry between England and the Emperor,  which should succeed in making terms soonest. In this competition Wolsey  had one advantage; he had already learned the stubbornness of the  national spirit of France, and its willingness to submit to anything  rather than territorial loss. So, while Charles haggled for provinces,  Wolsey demanded money. He told the French envoys that in order to make  peace, without having won laurels to justify it, Henry could not take  less than 2,000,000 crowns, and he would hear of no abatement. There was  much discussion of all the old claims of England for compensation from  France, but Wolsey knew the necessity of the moment, and carried all his  points.    When the terms were agreed upon there was another discussion about the  security to be given. Francis was a prisoner in Spain, and though his  mother was regent, a doubt might be thrown upon her capacity to ratify  such an important treaty. Wolsey would admit no doubts in the matter. He  knew that peace with France would not be popular, but he was determined  that his master should see its advantage in the substantial form of  ready money with good security for its payment. Besides ratification by  the regent he demanded the personal security of several French nobles,  of towns and local estates. At length he was satisfied. The treaty was  signed on 30th August, and was published on 6th September. Henry was to  receive 2,000,000 crowns in annual instalments of 50,000; the treaty  included Scotland as an ally of France, and it was stipulated that the  Duke of Albany was not to return. Scotland, left unprotected, was bound  to follow France, and in January 1526 peace was signed with Scotland to  the satisfaction of both countries.    Wolsey could congratulate himself on the result of his work. Again he  had won for England a strong position, by setting her in the forefront  of the opposition to the overweening power of the empire. Again had  England's action done much to restore the equilibrium of Europe. This  had been achieved solely by Wolsey's diplomacy. Charles V. had received  a blow which he could neither parry nor resent. The French treaty with  England deprived Charles of the means of exercising irresistible  pressure upon Francis, and encouraged the Italian States to form an  alliance against the Emperor. Francis, weary of his long captivity,  signed the treaty of Madrid, and obtained his freedom in February 1526.  But he previously protested against it as extorted by violence, and  refused to surrender an inch of French territory notwithstanding his  promises. Charles gained little by his victory at Pavia. His hands were  again full, as the Turks invaded Hungary, and Francis joined the Italian  League against him. He still had every motive to keep on good terms with  England, and Wolsey had no desire to precipitate a breach.    So Wolsey's policy for the future was one of caution and reserve. The  king withdrew more and more from public affairs, and spent his time in  hunting. His relations with Katharine became day by day more irksome,  and he tried to forget his domestic life by leading a life of pleasure.  Wolsey strove to hold the balance between Charles and Francis without  unduly inclining to either side. Both wished to be on good terms with  England, for neither was free from anxiety. The sons of Francis were  hostages in Spain, and Charles was hampered by the opposition of the  Italian League. Of this League Henry VIII. was a member, but he declined  to give it any active support. The Italians, as usual, were divided, and  Clement VII. was not the man to direct their distracted councils  successfully. In September 1526 a small force of Spaniards, aided by a  party amongst the Roman barons, surprised Rome, sacked the papal palace,  and filled Clement with terror. Charles V. disavowed any share in this  attack, and excused himself before Henry's remonstrances. But as Clement  did not entirely amend his ways, the experiment was repeated on a larger  scale. In May 1527 the imperial troops under the Duke of Bourbon and the  German general George Frundsberg captured and plundered Rome, and took  the Pope prisoner. This unwonted deed filled Europe with horror. It  seemed as if the Emperor had joined the enemies of the Church.    During this period Wolsey had been cautiously drawing nearer to France.  At first he only contemplated strengthening the ties which bound the two  countries together; but in the beginning of 1527 he was willing to form  a close alliance with France, which must lead to a breach with the  Emperor. French commissioners came to London, and a proposal was made  that Francis should marry Mary, then a child of ten, though he was  betrothed to the Emperor's sister Eleanor. Wolsey's demands were high: a  perpetual peace between the two countries, a perpetual pension of 50,000  crowns to the English king, a tribute of salt, and the surrender of  Boulogne and Ardres. In the course of the discussion the son of Francis,  the Duke of Orleans, was substituted for the father as Mary's husband;  on all other points Wolsey had his will, and never did he show himself a  more consummate master of diplomacy. The treaty was signed on 30th  April. The debts of Charles were transferred to Francis, and Wolsey  could show that he had made a substantial gain.    Doubtless Wolsey intended that this peace with France should form the  basis of a universal peace, which he never ceased to pursue. The success  of Charles V. in Italy, and subsequent events at home, rapidly dispelled  his hopes. Already the selfwill of Henry VIII. had driven him to  consent to measures which were against his judgment; the same selfwill,  turned to domestic and personal affairs, was already threatening to  involve Wolsey in a matter whose far-reaching effects no man could  foresee.           CHAPTER VIII   WOLSEY'S DOMESTIC POLICY      We have been following"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5396"],[0,"The Crisis — Complete (#20)"],[1,"Eugenie nearly dropped a curtsey. Belle Cluyme  was so impressed that she forgot for a whole hour to be spiteful. But  Puss Russell kissed her on both cheeks, and asked her if she really  wasn't nervous.    \"Nervous!\" exclaimed Jinny, \"why?\"    Miss Russell glanced significantly towards the doorway. But she said  nothing to her hostess, for fear of marring an otherwise happy occasion.  She retired with Jack Brim made to a corner, where she recited:--         \"Oh young Lochinvar is come out of the East;       Of millions of Yankees I love him the least.\"    \"What a joke if he should come!\" cried Jack.    Miss Russell gasped.    Just as Mr. Clarence Colfax, resplendent in new evening clothes just  arrived from New York, was pressing his claim for the first dance with  his cousin in opposition to numerous other claims, the chatter of the  guests died away. Virginia turned her head, and for an instant the  pearls trembled on her neck. There was a young man cordially and  unconcernedly shaking hands with her father and Captain Lige. Her memory  of that moment is, strangely, not of his face (she did not deign to  look at that), but of the muscle of his shoulder half revealed as he  stretched forth his arm.    Young Mr. Colfax bent over to her ear.    \"Virginia,\" he whispered earnestly, almost fiercely, \"Virginia, who  invited him here?\"    \"I did,\" said Virginia, calmly, \"of course. Who invites any one here?\"    \"But!\" cried Clarence, \"do you know who he is?\"    \"Yes,\" she answered, \"I know. And is that any reason why he should not  come here as a guest? Would you bar any gentleman from your house on  account of his convictions?\"    Ah, Virginia, who had thought to hear that argument from your lips? What  would frank Captain Lige say of the consistency of women, if he heard  you now? And how give an account of yourself to Anne Brinsmade? What  contrariness has set you so intense against your own argument?    Before one can answer this, before Mr. Clarence can recover from his  astonishment and remind her of her vehement words on the subject at  Bellegarde, Mr. Stephen is making thither with the air of one who  conquers. Again the natural contrariness of women. What bare-faced  impudence! Has he no shame that he should hold his head so high?  She feels her color mounting, even as her resentment rises at his  self-possession, and yet she would have despised him had he shown  self-consciousness in gait or manner in the sight of her assembled  guests. Nearly as tall as the Colonel himself, he is plainly seen, and  Miss Puss in her corner does not have to stand on tiptoe. Mr. Carvel  does the honors of the introduction.    But a daughter of the Carvels was not to fail before such a paltry  situation as this. Shall it be confessed that curiosity stepped into the  breach? As she gave him her hand she was wondering how he would act.    As a matter of fact he acted detestably. He said nothing whatever, but  stood regarding her with a clear eye and a face by far too severe.  The thought that he was meditating on the incident of the auction sale  crossed through her mind, and made her blood simmer. How dared he behave  so! The occasion called for a little small talk. An evil spirit took  possession of Virginia. She turned.    \"Mr. Brice, do you know my cousin, Mr. Colfax?\" she said.    Mr. Brice bowed. \"I know Mr. Colfax by sight,\" he replied.    Then Mr. Colfax made a stiff bow. To this new phase his sense of humor  did not rise. Mr. Brice was a Yankee and no gentleman, inasmuch as he  had overbid a lady for Hester.    \"Have you come here to live, Mr. Brice?\" he asked.    The Colonel eyed his nephew sharply. But Stephen smiled.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"if I can presently make enough to keep me alive.\" Then  turning to Virginia, he said, \"Will you dance, Miss Carvel?\"    The effrontery of this demand quite drew the breath from the impatient  young gentlemen who had been waiting their turn. Several of them spoke  up in remonstrance. And for the moment (let one confess it who knows),  Virginia was almost tempted to lay her arm in his. Then she made a bow  that would have been quite as effective the length of the room.    \"Thank you, Mr. Brice,\" she said, \"but I am engaged to Mr. Colfax.\"    Abstractedly he watched her glide away in her cousin's arms. Stephen had  a way of being preoccupied at such times. When he grew older he  would walk the length of Olive Street, look into face after face  of acquaintances, not a quiver of recognition in his eyes. But most  probably the next week he would win a brilliant case in the Supreme  Court. And so now, indifferent to the amusement of some about him, he  stood staring after Virginia and Clarence. Where had he seen Colfax's  face before he came West? Ah, he knew. Many, many years before he  had stood with his father in the mellow light of the long gallery at  Hollingdean, Kent, before a portrait of the Stuarts' time. The face was  that of one of Lord Northwell's ancestors, a sporting nobleman of the  time of the second Charles. It was a head which compelled one to pause  before it. Strangely enough,--it was the head likewise of Clarence  Colfax.    The image of it Stephen had carried undimmed in the eye of his memory.  White-haired Northwell's story, also. It was not a story that Mr. Brice  had expected his small son to grasp. As a matter of fact Stephen had not  grasped it then--but years afterward. It was not a pleasant story,--and  yet there was much of credit in it to the young rake its subject,--of  dash and courage and princely generosity beside the profligacy and  incontinence.    The face had impressed him, with its story. He had often dreamed of it,  and of the lace collar over the dull-gold velvet that became it so well.  And here it was at last, in a city west of the Mississippi River. Here  were the same delicately chiselled features, with their pallor, and  satiety engraved there at one and twenty. Here was the same lazy scorn  in the eyes, and the look which sleeplessness gives to the lids: the  hair, straight and fine and black; the wilful indulgence--not of one  life, but of generations--about the mouth; the pointed chin. And yet it  was a fact to dare anything, and to do anything.    One thing more ere we have done with that which no man may explain. Had  he dreamed, too, of the girl? Of Virginia? Stephen might not tell, but  thrice had the Colonel spoken to him before he answered.    \"You must meet some of these young ladies, sir.\"    It was little wonder that Puss Russell thought him dull on that first  occasion. Out of whom condescension is to flow is a matter of which  Heaven takes no cognizance. To use her own words, Puss thought him  \"stuck up,\" when he should have been grateful. We know that Stephen  was not stuck up, and later Miss Russell learned that likewise. Very  naturally she took preoccupation for indifference. It is a matter worth  recording, however, that she did not tease him, because she did not  dare. He did not ask her to dance, which was rude. So she passed him  back to Mr. Carvel, who introduced him to Miss Renault and Miss Saint  Cyr, and other young ladies of the best French families. And finally,  drifting hither and thither with his eyes on Virginia, in an evil moment  he was presented to Mrs. Colfax. Perhaps it has been guessed that Mrs.  Colfax was a very great lady indeed, albeit the daughter of an overseer.  She bore Addison Colfax's name, spent his fortune, and retained her good  looks. On this particular occasion she was enjoying herself quite as  much as any young girl in the room, and, while resting from a waltz, was  regaling a number of gentlemen with a humorous account of a scandal at  the Virginia Spring's.    None but a great lady could have meted out the punishment administered  to poor Stephen. None but a great lady could have concerned it. And he,  who had never been snubbed before, fell headlong into her trap. How  was the boy to know that there was no heart in the smile with which she  greeted him? It was all over in an instant. She continued to talk about  Virginia Springs, \"Oh, Mr. Brice, of course you have been there. Of  course you know the Edmunds. No? You haven't been there? You don't know  the Edmunds? I thought every body had been there. Charles, you look  as if you were just dying to waltz. Let's have a turn before the music  stops.\"    And so she whirled away, leaving Stephen forlorn, a little too angry to  be amused just then. In that state he spied a gentleman coming towards  him--a gentleman the sight of whom he soon came to associate with all  that is good and kindly in this world, Mr. Brinsmade. And now he put his  hand on Stephen's shoulder. Whether he had seen the incident just past,  who can tell?    \"My son,\" said he, \"I am delighted to see you here. Now that we are such  near neighbors, we must be nearer friends. You must know my wife, and my  son Jack, and my daughter Anne.\"    Mrs. Brinsmade was a pleasant little body, but plainly not a fit mate  for her husband. Jack gave Stephen a warm grasp of the hand, and  an amused look. As for Anne, she was more like her father; she was  Stephen's friend from that hour.    \"I have seen you quite often, going in at your gate, Mr. Brice. And  I have seen your mother, too. I like her,\" said Anne. \"She has such a  wonderful face.\" And the girl raised her truthful blue eyes to his.    \"My mother would be delighted to know you,\" he ventured, not knowing  what else to say. It was an effort for him to reflect upon their new  situation as poor tenants to a wealthy family.    \"Oh, do you think so?\" cried Anne. \"I shall call on her to-morrow, with  mother. Do you know, Mr. Brice,\" she continued, \"do you know that your  mother is just the person I should go to if I were in trouble, whether I  knew her or not?\"    \"I have found her a good person in trouble,\" said Stephen, simply. He  might have said the same of Anne.    Anne was enchanted. She had thought him cold, but"]]]
