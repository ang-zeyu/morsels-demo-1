He ruled only fourteen years but when he died the Christian world  of western Europe had officially recognised the bishops of Rome, the  Popes, as the head of the entire church.    This power, however, did not extend to the east. In Constantinople the  Emperors continued the old custom which had recognised the successors of  Augustus and Tiberius both as head of the government and as High Priest  of the Established Religion. In the year 1453 the eastern Roman Empire  was conquered by the Turks. Constantinople was taken, and Constantine  Paleologue, the last Roman Emperor, was killed on the steps of the  Church of the Holy Sophia.    A few years before, Zoe, the daughter of his brother Thomas, had married  Ivan III of Russia. In this way did the grand-dukes of Moscow fall heir  to the traditions of Constantinople. The double-eagle of old Byzantium  (reminiscent of the days when Rome had been divided into an eastern and  a western part) became the coat of arms of modern Russia. The Tsar who  had been merely the first of the Russian nobles, assumed the aloofness  and the dignity of a Roman emperor before whom all subjects, both high  and low, were inconsiderable slaves.    The court was refashioned after the oriental pattern which the eastern  Emperors had imported from Asia and from Egypt and which (so they  flattered themselves) resembled the court of Alexander the Great. This  strange inheritance which the dying Byzantine Empire bequeathed to an  unsuspecting world continued to live with great vigour for six more  centuries, amidst the vast plains of Russia. The last man to wear  the crown with the double eagle of Constantinople, Tsar Nicholas, was  murdered only the other day, so to speak. His body was thrown into a  well. His son and his daughters were all killed. All his ancient rights  and prerogatives were abolished, and the church was reduced to the  position which it had held in Rome before the days of Constantine.    The eastern church however fared very differently, as we shall see  in the next chapter when the whole Christian world is going to be  threatened with destruction by the rival creed of an Arab camel-driver.          MOHAMMED    AHMED, THE CAMEL-DRIVER, WHO BECAME THE PROPHET OF THE ARABIAN DESERT  AND WHOSE FOLLOWERS ALMOST CONQUERED THE ENTIRE KNOWN WORLD FOR THE  GREATER GLORY OF ALLAH, THE ONLY TRUE GOD      SINCE the days of Carthage and Hannibal we have said nothing of the  Semitic people. You will remember how they filled all the chapters  devoted to the story of the Ancient World. The Babylonians, the  Assyrians, the Phoenicians, the Jews, the Arameans, the Chaldeans, all  of them Semites, had been the rulers of western Asia for thirty or forty  centuries. They had been conquered by the Indo-European Persians who had  come from the east and by the Indo-European Greeks who had come from the  west. A hundred years after the death of Alexander the Great, Carthage,  a colony of Semitic Phoenicians, had fought the Indo-European Romans  for the mastery of the Mediterranean. Carthage had been defeated and  destroyed and for eight hundred years the Romans had been masters of the  world. In the seventh century, however, another Semitic tribe appeared  upon the scene and challenged the power of the west. They were the  Arabs, peaceful shepherds who had roamed through the desert since the  beginning of time without showing any signs of imperial ambitions.    Then they listened to Mohammed, mounted their horses and in less than  a century they had pushed to the heart of Europe and proclaimed the  glories of Allah, \"the only God,\" and Mohammed, \"the prophet of the only  God,\" to the frightened peasants of France.    The story of Ahmed, the son of Abdallah and Aminah (usually known as  Mohammed, or \"he who will be praised,\"); reads like a chapter in the  \"Thousand and One Nights.\" He was a camel-driver, born in Mecca.  He seems to have been an epileptic and he suffered from spells of  unconsciousness when he dreamed strange dreams and heard the voice of  the angel Gabriel, whose words were afterwards written down in a book  called the Koran. His work as a caravan leader carried him all over  Arabia and he was constantly falling in with Jewish merchants and with  Christian traders, and he came to see that the worship of a single God  was a very excellent thing. His own people, the Arabs, still revered  queer stones and trunks of trees as their ancestors had done, tens of  thousands of years before. In Mecca, their holy city, stood a little  square building, the Kaaba, full of idols and strange odds and ends of  Hoo-doo worship.    Mohammed decided to be the Moses of the Arab people. He could not well  be a prophet and a camel-driver at the same time. So he made himself  independent by marrying his employer, the rich widow Chadija. Then he  told his neighbours in Mecca that he was the long-expected prophet sent  by Allah to save the world. The neighbours laughed most heartily and  when Mohammed continued to annoy them with his speeches they decided to  kill him. They regarded him as a lunatic and a public bore who deserved  no mercy. Mohammed heard of the plot and in the dark of night he fled to  Medina together with Abu Bekr, his trusted pupil. This happened in the  year 622. It is the most important date in Mohammedan history and is  known as the Hegira--the year of the Great Flight.    In Medina, Mohammed, who was a stranger, found it easier to proclaim  himself a prophet than in his home city, where every one had known him  as a simple camel-driver. Soon he was surrounded by an increasing number  of followers, or Moslems, who accepted the Islam, \"the submission to the  will of God,\" which Mohammed praised as the highest of all virtues.  For seven years he preached to the people of Medina. Then he believed  himself strong enough to begin a campaign against his former neighbours  who had dared to sneer at him and his Holy Mission in his old  camel-driving days. At the head of an army of Medinese he marched across  the desert. His followers took Mecca without great difficulty, and  having slaughtered a number of the inhabitants, they found it quite easy  to convince the others that Mohammed was really a great prophet.    From that time on until the year of his death, Mohammed was fortunate in  everything he undertook.    There are two reasons for the success of Islam. In the first place,  the creed which Mohammed taught to his followers was very simple. The  disciples were told that they must love Allah, the Ruler of the World,  the Merciful and Compassionate. They must honour and obey their parents.  They were warned against dishonesty in dealing with their neighbours  and were admonished to be humble and charitable, to the poor and to the  sick. Finally they were ordered to abstain from strong drink and to be  very frugal in what they ate. That was all. There were no priests, who  acted as shepherds of their flocks and asked that they be supported at  the common expense. The Mohammedan churches or mosques were merely large  stone halls without benches or pictures, where the faithful could gather  (if they felt so inclined) to read and discuss chapters from the Koran,  the Holy Book. But the average Mohammedan carried his religion with him  and never felt himself hemmed in by the restrictions and regulations  of an established church. Five times a day he turned his face towards  Mecca, the Holy City, and said a simple prayer. For the rest of the time  he let Allah rule the world as he saw fit and accepted whatever fate  brought him with patient resignation.    Of course such an attitude towards life did not encourage the Faithful  to go forth and invent electrical machinery or bother about railroads  and steamship lines. But it gave every Mohammedan a certain amount of  contentment. It bade him be at peace with himself and with the world in  which he lived and that was a very good thing.    The second reason which explains the success of the Moslems in their  warfare upon the Christians, had to do with the conduct of those  Mohammedan soldiers who went forth to do battle for the true faith.  The Prophet promised that those who fell, facing the enemy, would go  directly to Heaven. This made sudden death in the field preferable to  a long but dreary existence upon this earth. It gave the Mohammedans an  enormous advantage over the Crusaders who were in constant dread of a  dark hereafter, and who stuck to the good things of this world as long  as they possibly could. Incidentally it explains why even to-day Moslem  soldiers will charge into the fire of European machine guns quite  indifferent to the fate that awaits them and why they are such dangerous  and persistent enemies.    Having put his religious house in order, Mohammed now began to enjoy  his power as the undisputed ruler of a large number of Arab tribes. But  success has been the undoing of a large number of men who were great in  the days of adversity. He tried to gain the good will of the rich people  by a number of regulations which could appeal to those of wealth.  He allowed the Faithful to have four wives. As one wife was a costly  investment in those olden days when brides were bought directly from  the parents, four wives became a positive luxury except to those who  possessed camels and dromedaries and date orchards beyond the dreams of  avarice. A religion which at first had been meant for the hardy hunters  of the high skied desert was gradually transformed to suit the needs  of the smug merchants who lived in the bazaars of the cities. It was a  regrettable change from the original program and it did very little good  to the cause of Mohammedanism. As for the prophet himself, he went on  preaching the truth of Allah and proclaiming new rules of conduct until  he died, quite suddenly, of a fever on June the seventh of the year 632."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/766"],[0,"David Copperfield (#20)"],[1,"re, finding I was not pursued, I went to bed, as it was  time, and lay quaking, for a couple of hours.    Next morning Mr. Sharp came back. Mr. Sharp was the first master, and  superior to Mr. Mell. Mr. Mell took his meals with the boys, but  Mr. Sharp dined and supped at Mr. Creakle's table. He was a limp,  delicate-looking gentleman, I thought, with a good deal of nose, and a  way of carrying his head on one side, as if it were a little too heavy  for him. His hair was very smooth and wavy; but I was informed by the  very first boy who came back that it was a wig (a second-hand one HE  said), and that Mr. Sharp went out every Saturday afternoon to get it  curled.    It was no other than Tommy Traddles who gave me this piece of  intelligence. He was the first boy who returned. He introduced himself  by informing me that I should find his name on the right-hand corner of  the gate, over the top-bolt; upon that I said, 'Traddles?' to which he  replied, 'The same,' and then he asked me for a full account of myself  and family.    It was a happy circumstance for me that Traddles came back first. He  enjoyed my placard so much, that he saved me from the embarrassment of  either disclosure or concealment, by presenting me to every other boy  who came back, great or small, immediately on his arrival, in this form  of introduction, 'Look here! Here's a game!' Happily, too, the greater  part of the boys came back low-spirited, and were not so boisterous at  my expense as I had expected. Some of them certainly did dance about me  like wild Indians, and the greater part could not resist the temptation  of pretending that I was a dog, and patting and soothing me, lest I  should bite, and saying, 'Lie down, sir!' and calling me Towzer. This  was naturally confusing, among so many strangers, and cost me some  tears, but on the whole it was much better than I had anticipated.    I was not considered as being formally received into the school,  however, until J. Steerforth arrived. Before this boy, who was  reputed to be a great scholar, and was very good-looking, and at least  half-a-dozen years my senior, I was carried as before a magistrate. He  inquired, under a shed in the playground, into the particulars of my  punishment, and was pleased to express his opinion that it was 'a jolly  shame'; for which I became bound to him ever afterwards.    'What money have you got, Copperfield?' he said, walking aside with  me when he had disposed of my affair in these terms. I told him seven  shillings.    'You had better give it to me to take care of,' he said. 'At least, you  can if you like. You needn't if you don't like.'    I hastened to comply with his friendly suggestion, and opening  Peggotty's purse, turned it upside down into his hand.    'Do you want to spend anything now?' he asked me.    'No thank you,' I replied.    'You can, if you like, you know,' said Steerforth. 'Say the word.'    'No, thank you, sir,' I repeated.    'Perhaps you'd like to spend a couple of shillings or so, in a bottle of  currant wine by and by, up in the bedroom?' said Steerforth. 'You belong  to my bedroom, I find.'    It certainly had not occurred to me before, but I said, Yes, I should  like that.    'Very good,' said Steerforth. 'You'll be glad to spend another shilling  or so, in almond cakes, I dare say?'    I said, Yes, I should like that, too.    'And another shilling or so in biscuits, and another in fruit, eh?' said  Steerforth. 'I say, young Copperfield, you're going it!'    I smiled because he smiled, but I was a little troubled in my mind, too.    'Well!' said Steerforth. 'We must make it stretch as far as we can;  that's all. I'll do the best in my power for you. I can go out when I  like, and I'll smuggle the prog in.' With these words he put the money  in his pocket, and kindly told me not to make myself uneasy; he would  take care it should be all right. He was as good as his word, if that  were all right which I had a secret misgiving was nearly all wrong--for  I feared it was a waste of my mother's two half-crowns--though I had  preserved the piece of paper they were wrapped in: which was a precious  saving. When we went upstairs to bed, he produced the whole seven  shillings' worth, and laid it out on my bed in the moonlight, saying:    'There you are, young Copperfield, and a royal spread you've got.'    I couldn't think of doing the honours of the feast, at my time of life,  while he was by; my hand shook at the very thought of it. I begged him  to do me the favour of presiding; and my request being seconded by the  other boys who were in that room, he acceded to it, and sat upon my  pillow, handing round the viands--with perfect fairness, I must say--and  dispensing the currant wine in a little glass without a foot, which was  his own property. As to me, I sat on his left hand, and the rest were  grouped about us, on the nearest beds and on the floor.    How well I recollect our sitting there, talking in whispers; or their  talking, and my respectfully listening, I ought rather to say; the  moonlight falling a little way into the room, through the window,  painting a pale window on the floor, and the greater part of us in  shadow, except when Steerforth dipped a match into a phosphorus-box,  when he wanted to look for anything on the board, and shed a blue glare  over us that was gone directly! A certain mysterious feeling, consequent  on the darkness, the secrecy of the revel, and the whisper in which  everything was said, steals over me again, and I listen to all they tell  me with a vague feeling of solemnity and awe, which makes me glad that  they are all so near, and frightens me (though I feign to laugh) when  Traddles pretends to see a ghost in the corner.    I heard all kinds of things about the school and all belonging to it.  I heard that Mr. Creakle had not preferred his claim to being a Tartar  without reason; that he was the sternest and most severe of masters;  that he laid about him, right and left, every day of his life, charging  in among the boys like a trooper, and slashing away, unmercifully. That  he knew nothing himself, but the art of slashing, being more ignorant  (J. Steerforth said) than the lowest boy in the school; that he had  been, a good many years ago, a small hop-dealer in the Borough, and had  taken to the schooling business after being bankrupt in hops, and making  away with Mrs. Creakle's money. With a good deal more of that sort,  which I wondered how they knew.    I heard that the man with the wooden leg, whose name was Tungay, was an  obstinate barbarian who had formerly assisted in the hop business, but  had come into the scholastic line with Mr. Creakle, in consequence,  as was supposed among the boys, of his having broken his leg in Mr.  Creakle's service, and having done a deal of dishonest work for him,  and knowing his secrets. I heard that with the single exception of Mr.  Creakle, Tungay considered the whole establishment, masters and boys,  as his natural enemies, and that the only delight of his life was to be  sour and malicious. I heard that Mr. Creakle had a son, who had not been  Tungay's friend, and who, assisting in the school, had once held some  remonstrance with his father on an occasion when its discipline was very  cruelly exercised, and was supposed, besides, to have protested against  his father's usage of his mother. I heard that Mr. Creakle had turned  him out of doors, in consequence; and that Mrs. and Miss Creakle had  been in a sad way, ever since.    But the greatest wonder that I heard of Mr. Creakle was, there being one  boy in the school on whom he never ventured to lay a hand, and that  boy being J. Steerforth. Steerforth himself confirmed this when it was  stated, and said that he should like to begin to see him do it. On being  asked by a mild boy (not me) how he would proceed if he did begin to see  him do it, he dipped a match into his phosphorus-box on purpose to shed  a glare over his reply, and said he would commence by knocking him down  with a blow on the forehead from the seven-and-sixpenny ink-bottle  that was always on the mantelpiece. We sat in the dark for some time,  breathless.    I heard that Mr. Sharp and Mr. Mell were both supposed to be wretchedly  paid; and that when there was hot and cold meat for dinner at Mr.  Creakle's table, Mr. Sharp was always expected to say he preferred cold;  which was again corroborated by J. Steerforth, the only parlour-boarder.  I heard that Mr. Sharp's wig didn't fit him; and that he needn't be so  'bounceable'--somebody else said 'bumptious'--about it, because his own  red hair was very plainly to be seen behind.    I heard that one boy, who was a coal-merchant's son, came as a set-off  against the coal-bill, and was called, on that account, 'Exchange or  Barter'--a name selected from the arithmetic book as expressing this  arrangement. I heard that the table beer was a robbery of parents, and  the pudding an imposition. I heard that Miss Creakle was regarded by the  school in general as being in love with Steerforth; and I am sure, as I  sat in the dark, thinking of his nice voice, and his fine face, and his  easy manner, and his curling hair, I thought it very likely. I heard  that Mr. Mell was not a bad sort of fellow, but hadn't a sixpence to  bless himself with; and that there was no doubt that old Mrs. Mell, his  mother, was as poor as job. I thought of my breakfast then, and what had  sounded like 'My Charley!' but I was, I am glad to remember, as mute as  a mouse about it.    The hearing of all this, and a good deal more, outlasted the banquet  some time. The greater part of the guests had gone to bed as soon as the  eating and drinking were over; and we, who had remained whispering and  listening half-undressed, at last betook ourselves to bed, too.    'Good night, young Copperfield,' said Steerforth. 'I'll take care of  you.' 'You're very kind,' I gratefully returned. 'I am very"]]]
