A house, a woman,  some girls, a dog, a cat, and a stork were on it and afloat.    At once, old man Ryer, still stiff from his long, cold bath, hobbled  out, and Pete ran before him. Yes, it was mother, the children and all  the animals! For the first time in his life, the mean old sinner felt  his heart thumping, in grateful emotion, under his woolen jacket, with  its two gold buttons. Something like real religion had finally oozed out  from under his crusted soul.    A whole convoy of boys, fishermen, farmers, and a fat vrouw or two,  volunteered to go out and tow the runaway farm to the village wharf.  They succeeded in grappling the float and held it fast by ropes tied to  a horse post.    That night all were happy. The farm was made fast by another rope put  round the town pump. Then the villagers all went to bed. They were happy  in having rescued a runaway farm, and they expected a good \"loon\"  (reward) from the rich old Ryer, who, in the barroom, had talked big  about his wealth.    As for the Van Boompjes, in order to save a landlord's bill for beds,  they slept in their house, on board the farm, amid the lowing of their  cattle that called out, in their own way, for more fodder; while the  people in the village wondered at roosters crowing out on the water, and  evidently the barn-yard birds were frightened.    And so they were; for, before midnight, when all other creatures were  asleep, and not even a mouse was stirring on land, whether hard fast, or  floating, the west wind rose mightily and blew to a terrific gale.    In a moment, the tow lines, that held the vagrant farm to the village  pump and horse post, snapped. The Van Boompjes estate left the wharf and  was driven, at a furious rate, across the Zuyder Zee. For several hours,  like a ship under full sail, it was pushed westward by the wind. Yet so  soundly did all sleep, man and wife, children and hens, that none  awakened during this strange voyage. Even the roosters, after their  first concert, held in their voices.    Suddenly, and as straight as if steered by a skilled pilot, the Van  Boompjes farm, now an accomplished traveller, after its many adventures,  shot into its old place. This took place with such violence, that Ryer  Van Boompjes and his wife were both thrown out of bed. The cows were  knocked over in the stable. The dog barked, supposing some one had  kicked him. One old rooster, jostled off his perch, set up a tremendous  crowing, that brought some of the early risers out to rub their eyes and  see what was going on.    \"Hemel en aard, bliksem en regen\" (Heaven and earth, lightning and  rain), they cried, \"the old farm is back in its place.\"    In fact, the Van Boompjes real estate was snugly fitted once more to the  mainland, and again in the niche it had left. It had struck so hard,  that a ridge of raised sod, five inches high, marked the place of  junction. At least twenty fishes and wriggling eels were smashed in the  collision.    From that day forth the conscience of Van Boompjes returned, and he  actually became an honest man. He sawed off, from time to time, portions  of his big farm, and returned them home, with money paid as interest, to  the owners. He found out all the mynheers, whose bits of land had  drifted off. He sent a tidy sum of gold to the village in North Holland,  where his farm had been moored, for a few hours. With a good conscience,  he went to church and worshipped. His action, at each of the two  collections, which Dutch folks always take up on Sundays, was noticed  and praised as a sure and public sign of the old sinner's true  repentance. When the deacons, with their white gloves on, poked under  his nose their black velvet bags, hung at the end of fishing poles, ten  feet long, this man, who had been for years a skinflint, dropped in a  silver coin each time.    On the farm, all the animals, from duck to stork, and from dog to ox,  now led happier lives. In the family, all declared that the behavior of  the farm and the wind of the Zuyder Zee had combined to make a new man  and a delightful father of old Van Boompjes. He lived long and happily  and died greatly lamented.          SANTA KLAAS AND BLACK PETE      Who is Santa Klaas? How did he get his name? Where does he live? Did you  ever see him?    These are questions, often asked of the storyteller, by little folks.    Before Santa Klaas came into the Netherlands, that is, to Belgium and  Holland, he was called by many names, in the different countries in  which he lived, and where he visited. Some people say he was born in  Myra, many hundred years ago before the Dutch had a dyke or a windmill,  or waffles, or wooden shoes. Others tell us how, in time of famine, the  good saint found the bodies of three little boys, pickled in a tub, at a  market for sale, and to be eaten up. They had been salted down to keep  till sold. The kind gentleman and saint, whose name was Nicholas,  restored these three children to life. It is said that once he lost his  temper, and struck with his fist a gentleman named Arius; but the  story-teller does not believe this, for he thinks it is a fib, made up  long afterward. How could a saint lose his temper so?    Another story they tell of this same Nicholas was this. There were three  lovely maidens, whose father had lost all his money. They wanted  husbands very badly, but had no money to buy fine clothes to get married  in. He took pity on both their future husbands and themselves. So he  came to the window, and left three bags of gold, one after the other.  Thus these three real girls all got real husbands, just as the novels  tell us of the imaginary ones. They lived happily ever afterward, and  never scolded their husbands.    By and by, men who were goldsmiths, bankers or pawnbrokers, made a sign  of these three bags of gold, in the shape of balls. Now they hang them  over their shop doors, two above one. This means \"two to one, you will  never get it again\"--when you put your ring, furs, or clothes, or watch,  or spoons, in pawn.    It is ridiculous how many stories they do tell of this good man,  Nicholas, who was said to be what they call a bishop, or inspector, who  goes around seeing that things are done properly in the churches. It was  because the Reverend Mr. Nicholas had to travel about a good deal, that  the sailors and travellers built temples and churches in his honor. To  travel, one must have a ship on the sea and a horse on the land, or a  reindeer up in the cold north; though now, it is said, he comes to  Holland in a steamship, and uses an automobile.    On Santa Klaas eve, each of the Dutch children sets out in the chimney  his wooden shoe. Into it, he puts a whisp of hay, to feed the  traveller's horse. When St. Nicholas first came to Holland, he arrived  in a sailing ship from Spain and rode on a horse. Now he arrives in a  big steamer, made of steel. Perhaps he will come in the future by  aeroplane. To fill all the shoes and stockings, the good saint must have  an animal to ride. Now the fast white horse, named Sleipnir, was ready  for him, and on Sleipnir's back he made his journeys.    How was Santa Klaas dressed?    His clothes were those of a bishop. He wore a red coat and his cap,  higher than a turban and called a mitre, was split along two sides and  pointed at the top. In his hands, he held a crozier, which was a staff  borrowed from shepherds, who tended sheep; and with the crozier he  helped the lambs over rough places; but the crozier of Santa Klaas was  tipped with gold. He had white hair and rosy cheeks. For an old man, he  was very active, but his heart and feelings never got to be one day  older than a boy's, for these began when mother love was born and  father's care was first in the world, but it never grows old.    When Santa Klaas travelled up north to Norway and into the icy cold  regions, where there were sleighs and reindeer, he changed his clothes.  Instead of his red robe, he wears a jacket, much shorter and trimmed  with ermine, white as snow. Taking off his mitre, he wears a cap of fur  also, and has laid aside his crozier. In the snow, wheels are no good,  and runners are the best for swift travel. So, instead of his white  horse and a wagon, he drives in a sleigh, drawn by two stags with large  horns. In every country, he puts into the children's stockings hung up,  or shoes set in the fireplace, something which they like. In Greenland,  for example, he gives the little folks seal blubber, and fish hooks. So  his presents are not the same in every country. However, for naughty  boys and girls everywhere, instead of filling shoes and stockings, he  may leave a switch, or pass them by empty.    When Santa Klaas travels, he always brings back good things. Now when he  first came to New Netherland in America, what did he find to take back  to Holland?    Well, it was here, on our continent, that he found corn, potatoes,  pumpkins, maple sugar, and something to put in pipes to smoke; besides  strange birds and animals, such as turkeys and raccoons, in addition to  many new flowers. What may be called a weed, like the mullein, for  example, is considered very pretty in Europe, where they did not have  such things. There it is called the American Velvet Plant, or the King's  Candlestick.    But, better than all, Santa Klaas found a negro boy, Pete, who became  one of the most faithful of his helpers. At Utrecht, in Holland, the  students of the University give, every year, a pageant representing  Santa Klaas on his white horse, with Black Pete, who is always on hand  and very busy. Black Pete's father brought peanuts from Africa to  America, and sometimes Santa Klaas drops a bagful of these, as a great  curiosity, into the shoes of the Dutch young folks.    Santa Klaas was kept very busy visiting the homes and the public schools  in New Netherland; for in these schools all the children, girls as well  as boys,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7882"],[0,"The Life of Kit Carson: Hunter, Trapper, Guide, Indian Agent and Colonel U.S.A. (#20)"],[1,"felt by us; and  mingled with the enthusiasm and excitement that we all felt at the  prospect of an undertaking which had never before been accomplished was  a certain impression of danger, sufficient to give a serious character  to our conversation. The momentary view which had been had of the lake  the day before, its great extent and rugged islands, dimly seen  amidst the dark waters in the obscurity of the sudden storm, were well  calculated to heighten the idea of undefined danger with which the lake  was generally associated.\"    \"September 8.--A calm, clear day, with a sunrise temperature of 41  degrees. In view of our present enterprise, a part of the equipment of  the boat had been made to consist of three airtight bags, about three  feet long, and capable each of containing five gallons. These had been  filled with water the night before, and were now placed in the boat,  with our blankets and instruments, consisting of a sextant, telescope,  spyglass, thermometer, and barometer.    \"In the course of the morning we discovered that two of the cylinders  leaked so much as to require one man constantly at the bellows, to keep  them sufficiently full of air to support the boat. Although we had made  a very early start, we loitered so much on the way--stopping every now  and then, and floating silently along, to get a shot at a goose or a  duck--that it was late in the day when he reached the outlet. The river  here divided into several branches, filled with fluvials, and so very  shallow that it was with difficulty we could get the boat along, being  obliged to get out and wade. We encamped on a low point among rushes and  young willows, where there was a quantity of driftwood, which served for  our fires. The evening was mild and clear; we made a pleasant bed of  the young willows; and geese and ducks enough had been killed for an  abundant supper at night, and for breakfast next morning. The stillness  of the night was enlivened by millions of waterfowl.    \"September. 9.--The day was clear and calm; the thermometer at  sunrise at 49 degrees. As is usual with the trappers on the eve of any  enterprise, our people had made dreams, and theirs happened to be a bad  one--one which always preceded evil--and consequently they looked very  gloomy this morning; but we hurried through our breakfast, in order to  make an early start, and have all the day before us for our adventure.  The channel in a short distance became so shallow that our navigation  was at an end, being merely a sheet of soft mud, with a few inches of  water, and sometimes none at all, forming the low water shore of the  lake. All this place was absolutely covered with flocks of screaming  plover. We took off our clothes, and, getting overboard, commenced  dragging the boat--making, by this operation, a very curious trail, and  a very disagreeable smell in stirring up the mud, as we sank above the  knee at every step. The water here was still fresh, with only an insipid  and disagreeable taste, probably derived from the bed of fetid mud.  After proceeding in this way about a mile, we came to a small black  ridge on the bottom, beyond which the water became suddenly salt,  beginning gradually to deepen, and the bottom was sandy and firm. It was  a remarkable division, separating the fresh water of the rivers from the  briny water of the lake, which was entirely saturated with common salt.  Pushing our little vessel across the narrow boundary, we sprang on  board, and at length were afloat on the waters of the unknown sea.    \"We did not steer for the mountainous islands, but directed our course  towards a lower one, which it had been decided we should first visit,  the summit of which was formed like the crater at the upper end of Bear  River Valley. So long as we could touch the bottom with our paddles,  we were very gay; but gradually, as the water deepened, we became more  still in our frail bateau of gum cloth distended with air, and with  pasted seams. Although the day was very calm, there was a considerable  swell on the lake; and there were white patches of foam on the surface,  which were slowly moving to the southward, indicating the set of  a current in that direction, and recalling the recollection of the  whirlpool stories. The water continued to deepen as we advanced; the  lake becoming almost transparently clear, of an extremely beautiful  bright green color; and the spray which was thrown into the boat and  over our clothes, was directly converted into a crust of common salt,  which covered also our hands and arms. 'Captain,' said Carson, who for  sometime had been looking suspiciously at some whitening appearances  outside the nearest islands, 'what are those yonder?--won't you just  take a look with the glass?' We ceased paddling for a moment, and found  them to be the caps of the waves that were beginning to break under the  force of a strong breeze that was coming up the lake. The form of the  boat seemed to be an admirable one, and it rode on the waves like  a water bird; but, at the same time, it was extremely slow in its  progress. When we were a little more than half way across the reach,  two of the divisions between the cylinders gave way, and it required the  constant use of the bellows to keep in a sufficient quantity of air. For  a long time we scarcely seemed to approach our island, but gradually  we worked across the rougher sea of the open channel, into the smoother  water under the lee of the island, and began to discover that what we  took for a long row of pelicans, ranged on the beach, were only low  cliffs whitened with salt by the spray of the waves; and about noon we  reached the shore, the transparency of the water enabling us to see the  bottom at a considerable depth.    \"The cliffs and masses of rock along the shore were whitened by an  incrustation of salt where the waves dashed up against them; and the  evaporating water, which had been left in holes and hollows on the  surface of the rocks, was covered with a crust of salt about one eighth  of an inch in thickness.    \"Carrying with us the barometer and other instruments, in the afternoon  we ascended to the highest point of the island--a bare, rocky peak, 800  feet above the lake. Standing on the summit, we enjoyed an extended view  of the lake, inclosed in a basin of rugged mountains, which sometimes  left marshy flats and extensive bottoms between them and the shore,  and in other places came directly down into the water with bold and  precipitous bluffs.    \"As we looked over the vast expanse of water spread out beneath us, and  strained our eyes along the silent shores over which hung so much doubt  and uncertainty, and which were so full of interest to us, I could  hardly repress the almost irresistible desire to continue our  exploration; but the lengthening snow on the mountains was a plain  indication of the advancing season, and our frail linen boat appeared so  insecure that I was unwilling to trust our lives to the uncertainties of  the lake. I therefore unwillingly resolved to terminate our survey here,  and remain satisfied for the present with what we had been able to  add to the unknown geography of the region. We felt pleasure also in  remembering that we were the first who, in the traditionary annals of  the country, had visited the islands, and broken, with the cheerful  sound of human voices, the long solitude of the place.    \"I accidentally left on the summit the brass cover to the object end of  my spyglass and as it will probably remain there undisturbed by Indians,  it will furnish matter of speculation to some future traveller. In our  excursions about the island, we did not meet with any kind of animal: a  magpie, and another larger bird, probably attracted by the smoke of our  fire, paid us a visit from the shore, and were the only living things  seen during our stay. The rock constituting the cliffs along the shore  where we were encamped, is a talcous rock, or steatite, with brown spar.    \"At sunset, the temperature was 70 degrees. We had arrived just in time  to obtain a meridian altitude of the sun, and other observations were  obtained this evening, which placed our camp in latitude 41 degrees 10'  42\" and longitude 112 degrees 21' 05\" from Greenwich. From a discussion  of the barometrical observations made during our stay on the shores of  the lake, we have adopted 4,200 feet for its elevation above the Gulf of  Mexico. In the first disappointment we felt from the dissipation of our  dream of the fertile islands, I called this Disappointment Island.    \"Out of the driftwood, we made ourselves pleasant little lodges, open to  the water, and, after having kindled large fires to excite the wonder of  any straggling savage on the lake shores, lay down, for the first time  in a long journey, in perfect security; no one thinking about his arms.  The evening was extremely bright and pleasant; but the wind rose during  the night, and the waves began to break heavily on the shore, making  our island tremble. I had not expected in our inland journey to hear  the roar of an ocean surf; and the strangeness of our situation, and the  excitement we felt in the associated interests of the place, made  this one of the most interesting nights I remember during our long  expedition.    \"In the morning, the surf was breaking heavily on the shore, and we were  up early. The lake was dark and agitated, and we hurried through our  scanty breakfast, and embarked--having first filled one of the buckets  with water from which it was intended to make salt. The sun had risen  by the time we were ready to start; and it was blowing a strong gale of  wind, almost directly off the shore, and raising a considerable sea, in  which our boat strained very much. It roughened as we got away from  the island, and it required all the efforts of the men to make any head  against the wind and sea; the gale rising with the sun; and there was"]]]
