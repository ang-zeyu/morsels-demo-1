They leave  their nest, situated at the top of a bough, in profound darkness; they  go down the denuded pole till they come to the nearest branch that has  not yet been gnawed, a branch which becomes lower and lower by degrees  as the consumers finish stripping the upper storeys; they climb up this  untouched branch and spread over the green needles.    When they have had their suppers and begin to feel the keen night air,  the next thing is to return to the shelter of the house. Measured in a  straight line, the distance is not great, hardly an arm's length; but  it cannot be covered in this way on foot. The caterpillars have to  climb down from one crossing to the next, from the needle to the twig,  from the twig to the branch, from the branch to the bough and from the  bough, by a no less angular path, to go back home. It is useless to  rely upon sight as a guide on this long and erratic journey. The  Processionary, it is true, has five ocular specks on either side of his  head, but they are so infinitesimal, so difficult to make out through  the magnifying-glass, that we cannot attribute to them any great power  of vision. Besides, what good would those short-sighted lenses be in  the absence of light, in black darkness?    It is equally useless to think of the sense of smell. Has the  Processional any olfactory powers or has he not? I do not know. Without  giving a positive answer to the question, I can at least declare that  his sense of smell is exceedingly dull and in no way suited to help him  find his way. This is proved, in my experiments, by a number of hungry  caterpillars that, after a long fast, pass close beside a pine-branch  without betraying any eagerness of showing a sign of stopping. It is  the sense of touch that tells them where they are. So long as their  lips do not chance to light upon the pasture-land, not one of them  settles there, though he be ravenous. They do not hasten to food which  they have scented from afar; they stop at a branch which they encounter  on their way.    Apart from sight and smell, what remains to guide them in returning to  the nest? The ribbon spun on the road. In the Cretan labyrinth, Theseus  would have been lost but for the clue of thread with which Ariadne  supplied him. The spreading maze of the pine-needles is, especially at  night, as inextricable a labyrinth as that constructed for Minos. The  Processionary finds his way through it, without the possibility of a  mistake, by the aid of his bit of silk. At the time for going home,  each easily recovers either his own thread or one or other of the  neighbouring threads, spread fanwise by the diverging herd; one by one  the scattered tribe line up on the common ribbon, which started from  the nest; and the sated caravan finds its way back to the manor with  absolute certainty.    Longer expeditions are made in the daytime, even in winter, if the  weather be fine. Our caterpillars then come down from the tree, venture  on the ground, march in procession for a distance of thirty yards or  so. The object of these sallies is not to look for food, for the native  pine-tree is far from being exhausted: the shorn branches hardly count  amid the vast leafage. Moreover, the caterpillars observe complete  abstinence till nightfall. The trippers have no other object than a  constitutional, a pilgrimage to the outskirts to see what these are  like, possibly an inspection of the locality where, later on, they mean  to bury themselves in the sand for their metamorphosis.    It goes without saying that, in these greater evolutions, the guiding  cord is not neglected. It is now more necessary than ever. All  contribute to it from the produce of their spinnerets, as is the  invariable rule whenever there is a progression. Not one takes a step  forward without fixing to the path the thread from his lips.    If the series forming the procession be at all long, the ribbon is  dilated sufficiently to make it easy to find; nevertheless, on the  homeward journey, it is not picked up without some hesitation. For  observe that the caterpillars when on the march never turn completely;  to wheel round on their tight-rope is a method utterly unknown to them.  In order therefore to regain the road already covered, they have to  describe a zigzag whose windings and extent are determined by the  leader's fancy. Hence come gropings and roamings which are sometimes  prolonged to the point of causing the herd to spend the night out of  doors. It is not a serious matter. They collect into a motionless  cluster. To-morrow the search will start afresh and will sooner or  later be successful. Oftener still the winding curve meets the  guide-thread at the first attempt. As soon as the first caterpillar has  the rail between his legs, all hesitation ceases; and the band makes  for the nest with hurried steps.    The use of this silk-tapestried roadway is evident from a second point  of view. To protect himself against the severity of the winter which he  has to face when working, the Pine Caterpillar weaves himself a shelter  in which he spends his bad hours, his days of enforced idleness. Alone,  with none but the meagre resources of his silk-glands, he would find  difficulty in protecting himself on the top of a branch buffeted by the  winds. A substantial dwelling, proof against snow, gales and icy fogs,  requires the cooperation of a large number. Out of the individual's  piled-up atoms, the community obtains a spacious and durable  establishment.    The enterprise takes a long time to complete. Every evening, when the  weather permits, the building has to be strengthened and enlarged. It  is indispensable, therefore, that the corporation of workers should not  be dissolved while the stormy season continues and the insects are  still in the caterpillar stage. But, without special arrangements, each  nocturnal expedition at grazing-time would be a cause of separation. At  that moment of appetite for food there is a return to individualism.  The caterpillars become more or less scattered, settling singly on the  branches around; each browses his pine-needle separately. How are they  to find one another afterwards and become a community again?    The several threads left on the road make this easy. With that guide,  every caterpillar, however far he may be, comes back to his companions  without ever missing the way. They come hurrying from a host of twigs,  from here, from there, from above, from below; and soon the scattered  legion reforms into a group. The silk thread is something more than a  road-making expedient: it is the social bond, the system that keeps the  members of the brotherhood indissolubly united.    At the head of every procession, long or short, goes a first  caterpillar whom I will call the leader of the march or file, though  the word leader, which I use for the want of a better, is a little out  of place here. Nothing, in fact, distinguishes this caterpillar from  the others: it just depends upon the order in which they happen to line  up; and mere chance brings him to the front. Among the Processionaries,  every captain is an officer of fortune. The actual leader leads;  presently he will be a subaltern, if the line should break up in  consequence of some accident and be formed anew in a different order.    His temporary functions give him an attitude of his own. While the  others follow passively in a close file, he, the captain, tosses  himself about and with an abrupt movement flings the front of his body  hither and thither. As he marches ahead he seems to be seeking his way.  Does he in point of fact explore the country? Does he choose the most  practicable places? Or are his hesitations merely the result of the  absence of a guiding thread on ground that has not yet been covered?  His subordinates follow very placidly, reassured by the cord which they  hold between their legs; he, deprived of that support, is uneasy.    Why cannot I read what passes under his black, shiny skull, so like a  drop of tar to look at? To judge by actions, there is here a modicum of  discernment which is able, after experimenting, to recognize excessive  roughnesses, over-slippery surfaces, dusty places that offer no  resistance and, above all, the threads left by other excursionists.  This is all or nearly all that my long acquaintance with the  Processionaries has taught me as to their mentality. Poor brains,  indeed; poor creatures, whose commonwealth has its safety hanging upon  a thread!    The processions vary greatly in length. The finest that I have seen  manoeuvring on the ground measured twelve or thirteen yards and  numbered about three hundred caterpillars, drawn up with absolute  precision in a wavy line. But, if there were only two in a row the  order would still be perfect: the second touches and follows the first.    By February I have processions of all lengths in the greenhouse. What  tricks can I play upon them? I see only two: to do away with the  leader; and to cut the thread.    The suppression of the leader of the file produces nothing striking. If  the thing is done without creating a disturbance, the procession does  not alter its ways at all. The second caterpillar, promoted to captain,  knows the duties of his rank off-hand: he selects and leads, or rather  he hesitates and gropes.    The breaking of the silk ribbon is not very important either. I remove  a caterpillar from the middle of the file. With my scissors, so as not  to cause a commotion in the ranks, I cut the piece of ribbon on which  he stood and clear away every thread of it. As a result of this breach,  the procession acquires two marching leaders, each independent of the  other. It may be that the one in the rear joins the file ahead of him,  from which he is separated by but a slender interval; in that case,  things return to their original condition.

Turtles were kept in the cold room for periods of 100 minutes  (hatchlings and juveniles) and 200 minutes (adults). The entire  experiment, including the time in which the turtles were allowed to  warm after they were taken from the cold room, covered a period of  nearly six hours (375 minutes) during which the turtles were under  constant observation. Individual body temperatures were taken  continuously in this period (39 for each juvenile and 24 for each  adult) in the order that the turtles were numbered; gaps between  records of the body temperature of a given individual therefore  represent the time required to record temperatures for the rest of the  turtles in the group. The rates of rise and fall of temperature for  each of the nine turtles considered are shown as a graph in Figure 23.  Rate of temperature change was inversely proportional to bulk;  hatchlings, for example, cooled and warmed a little more than twice as  rapidly as did adults. Rate of temperature change was intermediate in  juveniles but was more nearly like that of adults in the warming phase  and closer to that of hatchlings in the cooling phase (Table 5).    Considering that hatchling no. 2 was smaller than no. 1, the rate of  change in its temperature did not seem to be significantly altered by  starvation. The adult males showed a tendency to change temperature  faster than adult females even though both males were larger than any  of the females. The slight difference in rate of temperature change  between the sexes (Fig. 23) may have been fortuitous.    One hatchling (No. 1), when its temperature dropped below one degree,  fully extended all four limbs and the body was elevated and only the  anterior edge of the plastron was in contact with the confining glass  dish. Raising the body from an uncomfortably cold or hot substrate is  a well known phenomenon in many lizards and in crocodilians, but to my  knowledge has not been reported for turtles.

Changes in temperature of the body of         four juvenal (nos. 1 to 4) and five adult individuals of         _T. o. ornata_ (nos. 5 to 9) exposed to a constant air         temperature of zero degrees Centigrade for periods of 100 and         200 minutes, respectively. The vertical arrows indicate when         the turtles were removed to an air temperature of 27 degrees.         Sizes and weights of the turtles used are given in the text.         Turtle number nine, a female, was killed by means of chloroform         before experiment began. Rate of change in temperature in         specimens was inversely proportional to size. All turtles         survived the experiment.]    Hibernating turtles and those experimentally chilled were usually  comatose but were almost never completely incapacitated even at  temperatures at or near zero degrees. Experimental pinching, probing,  and pulling revealed that muscles operating the neck, the limbs, and  the lobes of the plastron could be controlled by the turtle at low  temperatures; hissing, resulting from rapid expulsion of air through  the mouth and nostrils (when the head and limbs are drawn in  reflexively) occurred at all body temperatures but was sometimes  barely audible in the coldest turtles. Of all living turtles observed,  only two (hatchlings 1 and 2 in coldroom experiment) were completely  immobile at low temperatures, failing to respond even to pinpricks at  body temperatures of 0.8 and 1.7 degrees, respectively, although other  turtles, under the same experimental conditions, consistently gave at  least some response to the same stimulation.    Turtles chilled experimentally continued to move about voluntarily,  albeit sluggishly, at temperatures much lower (2.5A deg. for each of four  adults; 10.0A deg. and 6.2A deg. for two juveniles) than those at which  locomotion was resumed in the warming phase (13A deg. for the adults, 21.7A deg.  and 20.1A deg. for the juveniles). Hatchlings chilled so rapidly that it  was difficult to ascertain accurately the temperature at which  inactivity was induced. Juveniles became active gradually, moving  slowly about when the body temperature reached approximately 20  degrees but not attempting more strenuous activities such as climbing  the walls of enclosures, until body temperatures of 22 to 25 degrees  were attained. Adults, on the other hand, exhibited \"normal\" activity  as soon as they became voluntarily active.    The ability of ornate box turtles to move about when the body  temperature is near the lethal minimum probably enables those caught  in the open by a sudden drop in environmental temperature to find  cover that keeps them from freezing to death. Prolonged chilling, on  the other hand, seems to create a physiologically different situation;  the temperature at which activity is resumed is higher and subject to  less variation.    Juveniles were more rapidly affected by environmental temperatures,  were subject to different thresholds, and were inactive over a wider  range than were the adults. Indeed, the _rate_ of chilling, rather  than absolute body temperature alone, might in large measure influence  the reactions of turtles to environmental temperatures. If this be so,  smaller turtles, having a narrower thermal range of normal activity,  must lose at least some of the advantages gained by their ability to  warm up more rapidly.    Hatchlings and juveniles at the Damm Farm were always active on days  when at least some adults were also active. Fitch (1956b:466) found  that, in northeastern Kansas, species of small reptiles and amphibians  are active earlier in the season than larger species and that the  young of certain species become active earlier than adults. Fitch  stated, \"... small size confers a distinct advantage in permitting  rapid rise in body temperature by contact with warmed soil, rock or  air, until the threshold of activity is attained\"; he pointed out also  that young animals, if able to emerge earlier than adults, would  benefit from a longer growing season. Hatchlings and juveniles of _T.  ornata_ would benefit greatly from an extra period of activity of say,  one or two weeks in spring and a similar period in autumn, especially  if food were plentiful. The extra growth realized from such a \"bonus\"  period of feeding would significantly increase the chance of the  individual turtle to survive in the following season of growth and  activity.    Ornate box turtles are active within a narrower range of temperatures  than are aquatic turtles in nearby ponds and streams of the same  region. Observations by William R. Brecheisen and myself on winter  activity of aquatic turtles indicate that, in Anderson County, Kansas,  the commoner species (_Chelydra serpentina_, _Chrysemys picta_, and  _Pseudemys scripta_) are more or less active throughout the year;  although they usually do not eat in winter, they are able to swim  about slowly and in some instances (_P. scripta_) even to carry on  sexual activity at body temperatures only one or two degrees above  freezing. But, ornate box turtles hibernating in the ground a few  yards away are incapable of purposeful movement at such low body  temperatures.          HIBERNATION      In northeastern Kansas ornate box turtles are dormant from late  October to mid-April--approximately five and one half months of the  year. Individuals may be intermittently active for short periods at  the beginning and end of the season, however. Once a permanent  hibernaculum is selected dormancy continues until spring; unseasonably  warm weather between mid-November and March does not stimulate  temporary emergence. There is little movement during dormancy except  for the deepening or horizontal extension of the hibernaculum.    Woodbury and Hardy (1948:171) found desert tortoises (_Gopherus  agassizi_) in dormancy from mid-October to mid-April in southwestern  Utah; some tortoises became temporarily active on warm days in winter.  Cahn (1937:102) was able to compare hibernation in several individuals  each of _T. ornata_ and _T. carolina_, kept under the same conditions  in Illinois. Individuals of _T. ornata_ burrowed into the ground in  October, two weeks before those of _T. carolina_ did, and continued to  burrow to a maximum depth of 22A1/2 inches. Some individuals of _T.  carolina_ spent the entire winter in the mud bottom of a puddle and  became semiactive on warm winter days. Other individuals of _T.  carolina_ burrowed nearly as deeply as did _T. ornata_. Individuals of  _T. ornata_ emerged from hibernation one or two weeks later in the  spring than did those of _T. carolina_. There are some indications  that populations of _T. carolina_ in eastern"]]]
