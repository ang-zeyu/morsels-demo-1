The  carpenter's shop, cooper's bench, and armourer's forge had each its place,  as well as a rope-walk, close to which our rigging was refitted, and the  sails were repaired. After working-hours the shore party roamed about the  woods with guns, or at low water picked up shell fish,[65] by which they  usually procured a fresh meal twice, but always once, a week. Meanwhile the  ship was kept carefully clean and in order. The officers not immediately  employed in active duty made excursions with their guns; and although the  immediate vicinity of our tents was pretty well thinned of game, yet a walk  of a few miles was always rewarded by ample sport. When opportunities  offered, some of the men were permitted to amuse themselves on shore with  their guns, for which many had provided themselves with powder and shot.  Every Sunday, after divine service, which was performed as regularly as  possible under our circumstances, such of the ship's company as desired  {83} permission to land obtained it. On one occasion, however, we had  nearly suffered for this indulgence, which was conducive to the men's  health, and seldom abused: for one of them having made a fire at a little  distance from the tents, the flames spread, and the exertions of all hands,  for three hours, only just prevented it from communicating to the tents. On  another occasion, two men set out on a shooting excursion, intending to  cross the river Sedger, against doing which there had been no particular  orders, as such a proceeding was scarcely contemplated. Having reached the  bank near its mouth, and searched for a fordable place unsuccessfully, they  launched a log of wood, and sitting astride, without providing themselves  with a pole or paddle, pushed off from the shore, supposing it would go  across; but, on reaching the middle of the stream, it was soon carried, by  the current, out of the river, into the bay. One man, Gilly, seeing that  the log was still floating away with the ebb tide, plunged in, and just  reached the shore south of the river, in a very exhausted state; the other,  Rix, unable to swim, kept his place, and was carried out to sea on a voyage  that might have been fatal, had he not been seen from the ship, and saved  by a boat.    Before leaving Port Famine we hauled one of our boats ashore, and left her  (as we thought) securely hidden among the trees.    Being now ready to sail, and only waiting for wind, the officers of both  ships, twenty-seven in number, dined together on shore.           *       *       *       *       *      {84}    CHAPTER VI.

While detained by northerly winds, the carpenter and a party of people were  employed in the woods selecting and cutting down trees to be ready for our  next visit. After felling thirteen trees, from twenty-four to thirty-six  inches in diameter, eight were found to be rotten at the heart; but by  afterwards taking the precaution of boring the trees with an augur, while  standing, much trouble was saved, and fifteen sound sticks of considerable  diameter were cut down. We found one tree, an evergreen beech, too large  for any of our saws: it measured twenty-one feet in girth at the base, and  from the height of six feet to twenty it was seventeen feet in  circumference; above this height, three large arms (each from thirty to  forty inches in diameter), branched off from the trunk. It is, perhaps, the  very tree described by Byron in his account of this place. We only once saw  it equalled in size, and that was by a prostrate trunk, very much decayed.    In this interval of fine weather and northerly wind, we had the thermometer  as high as 58deg, and the barometer ranging between 29.80 and 30.00; but  for two days before the wind shifted, the alteration was predicted by a  gradual descent of the mercurial column, and a considerable increase of  cold. On the 7th May, as there was some appearance of a change, we got  under weigh; but were hardly outside the port, when a northerly wind again  set in, and prevented our going farther than {85} Freshwater Bay, where we  passed the night. At last, on the 8th, accompanied by the Beagle, we  proceeded on our course with a strong south-westerly breeze, which carried  us quickly up to Cape Negro, when it blew so hard that I anchored off  Laredo Bay. At this anchorage we certainly felt the air much colder and  sharper than at Port Famine, arising from our being in a more exposed  situation, and from the approach of winter, as well as from the severe  south-west gale which was blowing.    After the gale had abated, we proceeded with fair weather and a light  breeze to the Second Narrow, when the wind fell; but the tide being in our  favour, we passed rapidly through. On a hill near us we observed three or  four Patagonian Indians standing together, and their horses feeding close  to them. A fire was soon kindled, to attract our notice, to which signal we  replied by showing our colours; and had we not already communicated with  these people, we should certainly have thought them giants, for they  \"loomed very large\" as they stood on the summit of the hill. This optical  deception must doubtless have been caused by mirage: the haze has always  been observed to be very great during fine weather and a hot day arising  from rapid evaporation of the moisture so abundantly deposited, on the  surface of the ground, in all parts of the Strait.    As soon as the Patagonians found they were noticed, they mounted and rode  along the shore abreast of us, being joined by other parties, until the  whole number could not have been less than forty. Several foals and dogs  were with them. Having anchored in Gregory Bay, where I intended remaining  for two days to communicate with them, I sent up a rocket, burnt a  blue-light, and despatched Lieutenant Cooke on shore to ask for a large  supply of guanaco meat, for which we would pay in knives and beads. The  boat returned on board immediately, bringing off four natives, three men  and 'Maria.' This rather remarkable woman must have been, judging by her  appearance, about forty years old: she is said to have been born at  Assuncion, in Paraguay, but I think the place of her birth was nearer  Buenos Ayres. She spoke broken, but {86} intelligible, Spanish, and stated  herself to be sister of Bysante, the cacique of a tribe near the Santa Cruz  River, who is an important personage, on account of his size (which Maria  described to be immense), and his riches. In speaking of him, she said he  was _very_ rich; he had many mantles, and also many hides (\"_muy_ rico,  tiene muchas mantas y tambien muchos cueros\"). One of Maria's companions, a  brother of Bysante, was the tallest and largest man of this tribe; and  though he only measured six feet in height, his body was large enough for a  much taller man. He was in great affliction: his daughter had died only two  days before our arrival; but, notwithstanding his sad story, which soon  found him friends, it was not long before he became quite intoxicated, and  began to sing and roar on the subject of his misfortunes, with a sound more  like the bellowing of a bull than the voice of a human being. Upon applying  to Maria, who was not quite so tipsy as her brother, to prevent him from  making such hideous noises, she laughed and said, \"Oh, never mind, he's  drunk; poor fellow, his daughter is dead\" (Es boracho, povrecito, murio su  hija); and then, assuming a serious tone, she looked towards the sky, and  muttered in her own language a sort of prayer or invocation to their chief  demon, or ruling spirit, whom Pigafetta, the companion and historian of  Magalhaens, called _Setebos_, which Admiral Burney supposes to have been  the original of one of Shakspeare's names in the \"Tempest\"--     \"------------ his art is of such power    He would controul my dam's god Setebos.[66]\"    Maria's dress was similar to that of other females of the tribe; but she  wore ear-rings, made of medals stamped with a figure of the Virgin Mary,  which, with the brass-pin that secured her mantle across her breast, were  given to her by one Lewis, who had passed by in an American sealing-vessel,  and who, we understood from her, had made them \"Christians.\" The Jesuit  Falkner, who lived among them for many years, has written a long and,  apparently, a very authentic account {87} of the inhabitants of the  countries south of the River Plata, and he describes those who inhabit the  borders of the Strait and sea-coast to be, \"Yacana-cunnees, which signifies  foot-people, for they have no horses in their country; to the north they  border on the Sehuau-cunnees, to the west on the Key-yus, or Key-yuhues,  from whom they are divided by a ridge of mountains; to the east they are  bounded by the ocean; and to the south by the islands of Tierra del Fuego,  or the South Sea. These Indians live near the sea on both sides of the  Strait, and often make war with one another. They make use of light floats,  like those of Chiloe, in order to pass the Straits, and are sometimes  attacked by the Huilliches and other Tehuelhets, who carry them away for  slaves, as they have nothing to lose but their liberty and their lives.  They subsist chiefly on fish, which they catch either by diving, or  striking them with their darts. They are very nimble afoot, and catch  guanacoes and ostriches with their bowls. Their stature is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38967"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 4 (of 6) (#20)"],[1,"d, we are not to consider the grace that animates his cherubs and  other delicate figures, as meriting the name of expression, or if that term  apply only to the passions, as very abundantly supplying its place. It is,  in truth, on account of this rare exhibition of grace, that every thing is  pardoned, and that in him defects themselves appear meritorious.      Footnote 26: He might have pleaded the example of the ancients,       who in their draped statues, observed similar proportions,       in order to avoid falling into vulgarity. The length of the       fingers was rather subject of praise, as is noticed by the       commentators on Catullus. (See his 44th Ode.) A long neck in       virgins is inculcated by Malvasia, as a precept of the art,       (tom. i. p. 303); and the Can. Lazzarini drew his Madonnas       according to this rule. These observations are all intended       to be applied with that judgment, which, in every art, is       not presumed to be taught, but understood.    He would seem to have been slow in his conceptions, being accustomed to  form the whole piece in idea, before he once handled his pencil; but was  then rapid in his execution. Strokes of his pencil may sometimes be traced  so very daring and decided, that Albano pronounces them divine, and  declares, that to his experience in design, he was indebted for that  unequalled skill, which he always united to great diligence and high  finish. His works, indeed, are not all equally well and powerfully  coloured, nor produce the same degree of effect; though there are several  which are conducted with so much feeling and enthusiasm as to have been  ascribed to Coreggio himself. Such is the picture of Love, engaged in  fabricating his bow, while at his feet appear two cherubs, one laughing and  the other weeping; a piece, of which a number of duplicates, besides that  contained in the imperial gallery, are enumerated, so great a favourite was  it either with the artist or some other person. In regard to this  production, I agree with Vasari, whose authority is further confirmed by  Father Affo and other judges, whom I have consulted upon the subject;  although it is true that this Cupid, together with the Ganymede, and the  Leda, which are mentioned in the same context, (p. 302), have been  positively assigned by Boschini to Coreggio, an opinion that continues to  be countenanced by many other persons.    His minor paintings, his portraits, his youthful heads, and holy figures,  are not very rare, and some are found multiplied in different places. One  that has been the most frequently repeated in collections, is a picture of  the Virgin and Infant with S. Giovanni; while the figures of St. Catherine  and Zaccarias, or some similar aged head, are to be seen very near them. It  was formerly met with in the Farnese gallery, at Parma, and is still to be  seen, sometimes the same, and sometimes varied, in the royal gallery, at  Florence; in the Capitoline; in those of the princes Corsini, Borghesi, and  Albani, at Rome. In Parma, also, it is in possession of the Abate  Mazza,[27] and is found in other places; insomuch, that it is difficult to  suppose that they could all have been repeated by Parmigianino, however old  in appearance. He produced few copious compositions, such as the Preaching  of Christ to the Crowd, which is contained in a chamber of the royal  palace, at Colorno, forming a real jewel of that beautiful and pleasant  villa. His altar-pieces are not numerous, of which, however, none is more  highly estimated than his St. Margarita, at Bologna. It is rich in figures,  which the Caracci were never weary of studying; while Guido, in a sort of  transport of admiration, preferred it even to the St. Cecilia of Raffaello.  His fresco, which he began at the Steccata, is a singular production;  besides the figure of Moses, exhibited in chiaroscuro, he painted Adam and  Eve, with several Virtues, without, however, completing the undertaking for  which he had been remunerated. The history of the affair is rather long,  and is to be found in Father Affo, where it is divested of many idle tales,  with which it had been confounded. I shall merely state, that the artist  was thrown into prison for having abandoned his task, and afterwards led a  fugitive life in Casale, where he shortly died, in his thirty-seventh year,  exactly at the same age as his predecessor Raffaello. He was lamented as  one of the first luminaries, not only of the art of painting, but of  engraving; though of this last I must say nothing, in order not to deviate  from the plan I have laid down.      Footnote 27: It is mentioned and compared with that of the       Borghesi, (in both the virgin is seen on one side) by P.       Affo, in a letter edited by the Advocate Bramieri, in the       notes to the _Elogio d'Ireneo Affo_, composed by P. D.       Pompilio Pozzetti; a very excellent scholar, (no less than       his annotator,) and deserving to stand high in the       estimation of all learned Italians.    Parma was in some degree consoled for the loss of Francesco, by Girolamo di  Michele Mazzuola, his pupil and his cousin. They had been intimate from the  year 1520, and apparently had contracted their friendship some years before  Francesco set out for Rome, which was continued unabated after his return.  Most probably, however, it at length experienced an interruption, owing to  which Francesco named two strangers his heirs, omitting his cousin. This  last is not known beyond Parma and its confines, though he was deserving of  more extensive fame, in particular for his strong impasto, and his  knowledge of colouring, in which he has few equals. There is reason to  suppose, that some of the works ascribed to Francesco, more especially such  as displayed warmer and stronger tints, were either executed or repeated by  this artist. Not having been in Rome, Girolamo was more attached to the  school of Coreggio, than Francesco, and in his style composed his picture  of the Marriage of St. Catherine, for the church of the Carmine; a piece  that proves how well he could exhibit that great master's character. He was  excellent in perspective, and in the Supper of our Lord, painted for the  refectory of S. Giovanni, he represented a colonnade so beautiful, and well  adapted to produce illusion, as to compete with the best specimens from the  hand of Pozzo. He could, moreover, boast ease and harmony, with a fine  chiaroscuro; while in his larger compositions in fresco, he was inventive,  varied, and animated. No single artist, among his fellow citizens, had the  merit of decorating the churches of Parma with an equal number of oil  paintings; no one produced more in fresco for the cathedral and for the  Steccata; to say nothing of his labours at S. Benedetto, in Mantua, and  elsewhere. It is from this rage for accomplishing too much, that we find so  many of his pieces that are calculated to surprise us at first sight,  diminish in merit upon an examination of their particular parts. Not a few  defects are observable amidst all his beauties; the design in his naked  figures is extremely careless; his grace is carried to a degree of  affectation, and his more spirited attitudes are violent. But these faults  are not wholly attributable to him, inasmuch as he occasionally painted the  same work in conjunction with other artists. This occurred in his large  picture of the Multiplication of Loaves placed at S. Benedetto, in Mantua,  in which, from documents discovered by the Ab. Mari, Girolamo would appear  to have been assisted in his labours; there are in it groups of figures,  whose beauty would confer credit upon any artist; while, on the other hand,  there are faults and imbecilities that must have proceeded from some other  pencil. It is true that he has admitted the same in other of his works, and  there they are wholly to be ascribed to his haste. We likewise find mention  of an Alessandro Mazzuola, son of Girolamo, who painted in the cathedral,  in 1571; but he is a weak imitator of the family style; the usual fate of  pictoric families, when arrived at the third generation.    Such was the state of the art in Parma about the middle of the sixteenth  century, at which period the Farnese family acquired dominion there, and  greatly contributed to promote the interest of that school. Coreggio's  disciples had already produced pupils in their turn; and though it be  difficult to ascertain from what school each artist proceeded, it is easy  to conjecture, from their respective tastes, that they were all inclined to  pursue the career of the two most illustrious masters of the school of  Parma; yet Mazzuola was, perhaps, more followed than Coreggio. It is too  favourite an opinion, both with dilettanti and artists, that the new style  must invariably be the most beautiful; permitting fashion even to corrupt  the arts. Parmigianino, perhaps, educated no other pupil besides his  cousin; Daniel da Parma had studied also under Coreggio; and Batista  Fornari, after acquiring little more than a knowledge of design from  Francesco, turned his attention to sculpture, producing, among other fine  statues, for the Duke Ottavio Farnese, the Neptune, which is now placed in  the royal gardens. The name of Jacopo Bertoia, (often written by mistake  Giacinto) has been added by some to this list. He was a good deal employed  by the court at Parma and Caprarola; and not very long ago, some of his  small paintings were transferred from the palace of the royal garden into  the academy. The subjects are fabulous, and both in the figures of his  nymphs, and in every thing else, the grace of Francesco is very  perceptible. Yet the memorials discovered by P. Affo, do not permit us to  name Parmigianino as his master. He was still young in 1573, and Lomazzo,  in his \"Tempio,\" calls him the pupil of Ercole Procaccini. He produced many  small pictures for private ornament, which were at one time "]]]
