Certain partitions were torn down, and new ones  were built. The Indian wife of his chief runner made curtains for the  windows, and he confiscated a small phonograph that should have gone on  to Lac la Biche. He had no doubts, and he counted the days as they  passed.    Down on the Gray Loon Pierrot and Nepeese were busy at many things, so  busy that at times Pierrot's fears of the factor at Lac Bain were  almost forgotten, and they slipped out of the Willow's mind entirely.  It was the Red Moon, and both thrilled with the anticipation and  excitement of the winter hunt. Nepeese carefully dipped a hundred traps  in boiling caribou fat mixed with beaver grease, while Pierrot made  fresh deadfalls ready for setting on his trails. When he was gone more  than a day from the cabin, she was always with him.    But at the cabin there was much to do, for Pierrot, like all his  Northern brotherhood, did not begin to prepare until the keen tang of  autumn was in the air. There were snowshoes to be rewebbed with new  babiche; there was wood to be cut in readiness for the winter storms.  The cabin had to be banked, a new harness made, skinning knives  sharpened and winter moccasins to be manufactured--a hundred and one  affairs to be attended to, even to the repairing of the meat rack at  the back of the cabin, where, from the beginning of cold weather until  the end, would hang the haunches of deer, caribou, and moose for the  family larder and, when fish were scarce, the dogs' rations.    In the bustle of all these preparations Nepeese was compelled to give  less attention to Baree than she had during the preceding weeks. They  did not play so much; they no longer swam, for with the mornings there  was deep frost on the ground, and the water was turning icy cold. They  no longer wandered deep in the forest after flowers and berries. For  hours at a time Baree would now lie at the Willow's feet, watching her  slender fingers as they weaved swiftly in and out with her snowshoe  babiche. And now and then Nepeese would pause to lean over and put her  hand on his head, and talk to him for a moment--sometimes in her soft  Cree, sometimes in English or her father's French.    It was the Willow's voice which Baree had learned to understand, and  the movement of her lips, her gestures, the poise of her body, the  changing moods which brought shadow or sunlight into her face. He knew  what it meant when she smiled. He would shake himself, and often jump  about her in sympathetic rejoicing, when she laughed. Her happiness was  such a part of him that a stern word from her was worse than a blow.  Twice Pierrot had struck him, and twice Baree had leaped back and faced  him with bared fangs and an angry snarl, the crest along his back  standing up like a brush. Had one of the other dogs done this, Pierrot  would have half-killed him. It would have been mutiny, and the man must  be master. But Baree was always safe. A touch of the Willow's hand, a  word from her lips, and the crest slowly settled and the snarl went out  of his throat.    Pierrot was not at all displeased.    \"Dieu. I will never go so far as to try and whip that out of him,\" he  told himself. \"He is a barbarian--a wild beast--and her slave. For her  he would kill!\"    So it turned out, through Pierrot himself--and without telling his  reason for it--that Baree did not become a sledge dog. He was allowed  his freedom, and was never tied, like the others. Nepeese was glad, but  did not guess the thought that was in Pierrot's mind. To himself  Pierrot chuckled. She would never know why he kept Baree always  suspicious of him, even to the point of hating him.    It required considerable skill and cunning on his part. With himself he  reasoned:    \"If I make him hate me, he will hate all men. Mey-oo! That is good.\"    So he looked into the future--for Nepeese.    Now the tonic-filled days and cold, frosty nights of the Red Moon  brought about the big change in Baree. It was inevitable. Pierrot knew  that it would come, and the first night that Baree settled back on his  haunches and howled up at the Red Moon, Pierrot prepared Nepeese for it.    \"He is a wild dog, ma Nepeese,\" he said to her. \"He is half wolf, and  the Call will come to him strong. He will go into the forests. He will  disappear at times. But we must not fasten him. He will come back. Ka,  he will come back!\" And he rubbed his hands in the moonglow until his  knuckles cracked.    The Call came to Baree like a thief entering slowly and cautiously into  a forbidden place. He did not understand it at first. It made him  nervous and uneasy, so restless that Nepeese frequently heard him whine  softly in his sleep. He was waiting for something. What was it? Pierrot  knew, and smiled in his inscrutable way.    And then it came. It was night, a glorious night filled with moon and  stars, under which the earth was whitening with a film of frost, when  they heard the first hunt call of the wolves. Now and then during the  summer there had come the lone wolf howl, but this was the tonguing of  the pack; and as it floated through the vast silence and mystery of the  night, a song of savagery that had come with each Red Moon down through  unending ages, Pierrot knew that at last had come that for which Baree  had been waiting.    In an instant Baree had sensed it. His muscles grew taut as pieces of  stretched rope as he stood up in the moonlight, facing the direction  from which floated the mystery and thrill of the sound. They could hear  him whining softly; and Pierrot, bending down so that he caught the  light of the night properly, could see him trembling.    \"It is Mee-Koo!\" he said in a whisper to Nepeese.    That was it, the call of the blood that was running swift in Baree's  veins--not alone the call of his species, but the call of Kazan and  Gray Wolf and of his forbears for generations unnumbered. It was the  voice of his people. So Pierrot had whispered, and he was right. In the  golden night the Willow was waiting, for it was she who had gambled  most, and it was she who must lose or win. She uttered no sound,  replied not to the low voice of Pierrot, but held her breath and  watched Baree as he slowly faded away, step by step, into the shadows.  In a few moments more he was gone. It was then that she stood straight,  and flung back her head, with eyes that glowed in rivalry with the  stars.    \"Baree!\" she called. \"Baree! Baree! Baree!\"    He must have been near the edge of the forest, for she had drawn a  slow, waiting breath or two before he was and he whined up into her  face. Nepeese put her hands to his head.    \"You are right, mon pere,\" she said. \"He will go to the wolves, but he  will come back. He will never leave me for long.\" With one hand still  on Baree's head, she pointed with the other into the pitlike blackness  of the forest. \"Go to them, Baree!\" she whispered. \"But you must come  back. You must. Cheamao!\"    With Pierrot she went into the cabin; the door closed silence. In it he  could hear the soft night sounds: the clinking of the chains to which  the dogs were fastened, the restless movement of their bodies, the  throbbing whir of a pair of wings, the breath of the night itself. For  to him this night, even in its stillness, seemed alive. Again he went  into it, and close to the forest once more he stopped to listen. The  wind had turned, and on it rode the wailing, blood-thrilling cry of the  pack. Far off to the west a lone wolf turned his muzzle to the sky and  answered that gathering call of his clan. And then out of the east came  a voice, so far beyond the cabin that it was like an echo dying away in  the vastness of the night.    A choking note gathered in Baree's throat. He threw up his head.  Straight above him was the Red Moon, inviting him to the thrill and  mystery of the open world.    The sound grew in his throat, and slowly it rose in volume until his  answer was rising to the stars. In their cabin Pierrot and the Willow  heard it. Pierrot shrugged his shoulders.    \"He is gone,\" he said.    \"Oui, he is gone, mon pere\" replied Nepeese, peering through the window.        CHAPTER 18    No longer, as in the days of old, did the darkness of the forests hold  a fear for Baree. This night his hunt cry had risen to the stars and  the moon, and in that cry he had, for the first time, sent forth his  defiance of night and space, his warning to all the wild, and his  acceptance of the Brotherhood. In that cry, and the answers that came  back to him, he sensed a new power--the final triumph of nature in  telling him that the forests and the creatures they held were no longer  to be feared, but that all things feared him. Off there, beyond the  pale of the cabin and the influence of Nepeese, were all the things  that the wolf blood in him found now most desirable: companionship of  his kind, the lure of adventure, the red, sweet blood of the chase--and  matehood. This last, after all, was the dominant mystery that was  urging him, and yet least of all did he understand it.    He ran straight into the darkness to the north and west, slinking low  under the bushes, his tail drooping, his ears aslant--the wolf as the  wolf runs on the night trail. The pack had swung due north, and was  traveling faster than he, so that at the end of half an hour he could  no longer hear it. But the lone wolf howl to the west was nearer, and  three times Baree gave answer to it.    At the end of an hour he heard the pack again, swinging southward.  Pierrot would easily have understood. Their quarry had found safety  beyond water, or in a lake, and the muhekuns were on a fresh trail. By  this time not more than a quarter of a mile of the forest separated  Baree from the lone wolf, but the lone wolf was also an old wolf, and  with the directness and precision of long experience, he swerved in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47519"],[0,"President Heber C. Kimball's Journal (#20)"],[1,"me. We got to the house of my old friend, Adolphus Huit, the first day  of February. I never saw a person more pleased than his wife was to see  me; she said that she had been calling on the Lord that He would send  me there.    On Sunday morning we went to the Christian chapel. After the meeting  was through, an appointment was given out for me to preach on Monday  evening. The church leaders said they were willing that I should  preach, because the people were in such a cold state that I could not  have any effect upon them.    When the time came, I went and found the house crowded. My text was  from the 2nd Epistle of John, 9th, 10th and 11th verses. When I was  almost through, two of the ministers came into the pulpit. I gave them  permission to speak, when one Baptist arose and found fault with me  because I had preached from the Bible.    When he had sat down, I answered him, and then three others followed  his example, and I answered each in turn. They were confounded, and the  discussion tended to open the eyes of the people.    I afterwards baptized Mrs. Huit, and many others believed. I only  preached once and then returned to Victor.    On the 10th, I started for New York, and reached Albany on the 12th.  Mr. Wheeler, my brother-in-law, stayed with me all night at the hotel  and paid my bill. He thought me unwise to go any farther, but the next  day I took coach for New York.    I went up on the east side of the river, crossed the Catskill  Mountains, and took three days to get to Jersey City, traveling part of  the way by sleigh. When I arrived at Jersey City, I had not one penny  left, and could not cross the river without paying twenty-five cents. I  informed the person in charge of the boat that I was out of money, and  a gentleman who overheard me gave me twenty-five cents. I crossed the  river into New York at nine o'clock at night, went to the Western Hotel  and pawned my trunk to pay for lodging. I had only eaten one meal a day  while traveling to New York, for want of money to buy more, but I did  not suffer from hunger.    The next morning, I went in search of some of the Saints, and soon  found Brothers Parley P. and Orson Pratt and Brigham Young, who were  glad to see me. I went to meeting with them and found one hundred and  fifty Saints assembled. It was a great pleasure to meet with them. They  were very kind to me, and soon provided me with money to redeem my  trunk.    I found a letter in New York from my wife, which had lain in the office  for a long time, and I was thankful to hear that she and our children  were better.    Soon after I arrived in New York, Orson Pratt and I were called upon  to visit a sick woman, who was unable to turn herself in bed without  assistance. We anointed her with oil in the name of the Lord, and she  was made whole. She did not belong to the Church, nor did her husband,  but in two days afterwards she and her husband were baptized, and  fourteen others.    I was detained in New York about four weeks, being unable to obtain  passage on a packet ship, as the owners of vessels found it more  profitable to carry freight than passengers. Brothers Woodruff,  Taylor, Clark, Mulliner, White and Turley had already gone to England,  and Brother George A. Smith, on account of sickness, had gone to  Philadelphia.    We were not idle, however, while we remained. We had calls to preach on  every hand. I attended a meeting almost every night and was generally  kept up talking till midnight or past.    As a result of our labors, many new members were added to the Church  and fresh zeal was infused into the old ones. The Saints were very kind  to us, and provided liberally for our wants, and when we were ready to  sail they supplied us with money to pay our passage, and many tempting  delicacies as well as more substantial food to serve us on the voyage,  besides clothing and bedding.    In company with Elders Brigham Young, Orson Pratt, George A. Smith,  Parley P. Pratt and R. Hedlock, I took passage for England on the ship  _Patrick Henry_, on the 7th of March, 1840. A large number of the  Saints came down to the wharf to bid us farewell. When we got into the  small boat to go to the ship the Saints on shore sang \"The Gallant Ship  is Under Way,\" in which song we joined until the sound of our voices  was lost in the distance. I may also add that previous to starting we  held a conference with the Saints in New York, at which, by unanimous  vote of those present, a \"letter of recommendation\" was given me,  signed, in behalf of the Saints, by the presiding Elder of the Branch  and clerk of the conference, testifying of my \"wisdom, understanding,  meekness and humility,\" and recommending me \"as an upright, honest,  candid man, and a faithful minister of the gospel.\"        CHAPTER XVII.    INCIDENTS OF ELDER KIMBALL'S MISSION, AS GLEANED FROM HIS LETTERS--SOME  OF HIS PROPHECIES FULFILLED--ELDER HYDE'S ACCOUNT OF THE CONTEST  WITH EVIL SPIRITS--GREAT SUCCESS OF THE WORK THROUGHOUT ENGLAND--A  TESTIMONIAL--SUMMARY OF LABORS--RETURN TO NAUVOO.    Elder Kimball's journal containing an account of his mission after  leaving New York having been lost, it has been necessary to refer to  letters written to his family for further particulars.    After a very stormy passage, he and his brethren arrived in Liverpool  on the 6th of the April, 1840, where they met Elders Taylor and  Fielding. Three days later he went by train to Preston. On reaching  Penwortham, three miles from Preston he learned that the Saints had  been anxiously expecting him for months. He found many friends standing  by the railway watching for him. It was a happy meeting. There was  great rejoicing among the Saints, and no little excitement and disgust  among their enemies, who had declared that he and his associate Elders  should never come to that land again. Many ministers were very much  exercised over their presence and were in favor of petitioning the  heads of government to interfere with their proselyting. They had cause  to fear, as the labors of the Elders had already resulted in breaking  up many churches.    On the 14th of April, the Elders met to organize, when Elder Willard  Richards was ordained to the Apostleship and Brigham Young chosen  President. The following day a general conference was held, at which  one thousand seven hundred and twenty members of the Church were  represented, exclusive of a large number scatted about in different  parts of the land, whose standing was not known.    On the 18th, he accompanied Elder Willard Richards to the little branch  at Walkerford, where, it will be remembered, Elder Kimball was first  invited to come and preach by the Rev. Mr. Richards, whose daughter he  had previously baptized. This daughter in the meantime had been married  to Elder Willard Richards. And right here it may be as well to remark,  in illustration of Elder Kimball's prophetic character, that this  marriage was in fulfillment of a prediction which he made immediately  after baptizing Miss Jeannette Richards. On meeting Elder Richards,  he exclaimed, \"Willard, I have baptized your wife to day!\" A similar  prediction was made by him about the marriage of Elder Joseph Fielding,  and as literally fulfilled.    Since Elder Kimball's first visit to Walkerford, the few Saints there  had suffered a great deal of persecution, still most of them had  remained firm in the faith. It would appear, however, that Mr. John  Richards had got to feel rather sore over the change in his prospects  since having his church members converted to \"Mormonism,\" for on seeing  Elder Kimball again at his house in company with Elder Richards, he  ordered him to leave. Brother Kimball, in writing of this, says: \"I  went out and pursued my journey. I could hear the old lady and Sister  Richards crying when I got into the road. I felt to weep for them. She  is a mother indeed, who has fed me and given me money and administered  to my wants, and will not lose her reward.\"    Elder Kimball makes frequent mention of the love which the Saints  manifested for him. While staying at the house of Brother Thomas Smith,  in Clitheroe, he one morning overheard one of the daughters of the  house say to her mother, \"I want you should make Brother Kimball as  comfortable as possible, and I will work in the factory as hard as I  can.\"    His sympathy was frequently aroused by meeting with Saints who had  been in comfortable circumstances when he knew them on his former  mission, but who, through being thrown out of employment, were reduced  to want, and would weep at not being able to set food before him as  they had formerly done. In visiting Eccleston and Dauber's Lane and  the surrounding region, he was received with a perfect ovation by  the Saints, and they everywhere urged him to tarry with them. At a  village called Chatburn, where he and Elder Fielding went to preach,  no house could be found large enough for the people to convene in who  turned out to hear them, and they held a meeting in a large barn, with  most excellent results. Of this place and its people, he wrote: \"Some  who had left the Church wished they had been faithful; and some did  return by humble repentance and being re-baptized. There appears to be  something peculiar in the people of this place; others had tried in  vain to enlist them in their folds, but on hearing the first preaching  of the fullness of the gospel they were overwhelmed in tears of  repentance and more than twenty were immediately baptized, which number  was afterwards increased to about ninety, who have generally kept the  faith. We have never received anything like an insult all the times we  visited the village, and we feel bound to bless them.\"    On visiting Southport, a celebrated bathing place, and a great resort  for rich people in search of health, he says, \"There I beheld halt and  blind, deaf and maimed and leprous.
