In  the salt water it attains a greater size, changes its color in  accordance with the length of time it has been there, but on returning  again to the stream it soon assumes its original plan of coloring.    Head, about one-fourth of the whole length from the snout to the base  of the caudal fin, varying much with age and size. Generally the  greatest depth is about one fourth of the length of the fish, but this  also varies very much with the character of the waters it inhabits. In  rapid running streams the fish are always slimmer than in more  sluggish ones. I have known them 20 inches or more in length, when  confined in large reservoirs, to become so heavy that they would weigh  one pound to every two inches in length. The lateral line, or rainbow  varies, in intensity of color, but always showing in varying shades of  red, pink, and sometimes blue of a metallic luster. The vertical black  blotches seen on the sides are the marks of immature fish.    The snout of the rainbow is considerably more rounding than that of  the salmon, and the head larger in proportion. The eye also is much  larger and fuller. The shape and position of the fins are almost  identical with those of the salmon, but a little larger in proportion  to the size of the fish. The tail, however, varies considerably, being  more rounded, and showing only a slight indentation in the center.      THE GOLDEN TROUT    (Salmo irideus agua bonita)    If there is any variety of the rainbow trout found on the Coast that  is entitled to a sub-specific name it is the golden trout of Mt.  Whitney. They were originally found in only a short portion of two  little streams fed by the snows of Mt. Whitney, and vary but little  from each other. In one stream they have been given the name of =Salmo  irideus agua bonita=, and in the other that of =Salmo irideus  rooseveltii=, after ex-president Roosevelt. They are of a beautiful  color with scarlet markings at the base of the fins and with a lateral  stripe of bright scarlet blending into a rich orange. One peculiarity  of these fish is that the par marks or vertical blotches on the sides  of other young fish still show on the adults of these. This form of  the rainbow has changed its color through the process of natural  selection, caused no doubt, by the color of the rocks in the shallow  streams it inhabits. Below on these same streams where the rocks are  of a darker color the fish assume the natural color of the rainbow.    The writer is possibly the first white man to ever catch one of the  golden trout. They were taken in 1865 with a small piece of the flank of  a deer skin slipped over the hook, with the hair clipped to about half  an inch in length. No sooner was this improvised fly cast upon the water  than it was eagerly seized by one of these beautiful fish. When it was  landed the color astonished me, and knowing that it was a trout, I  thought it must be a diseased one and threw it back. Making another cast  I secured another one as promptly as the first, and it being the same  objectionable color and of the same size--about eight inches--I  concluded that it was the same fish and this time threw it on the bank.  As fast as my deer skin fly would strike the water it would be eagerly  seized by one of these game little fellows and all of the same size and  color. I was puzzled and called to my companion, who was cooking our  supper but a few yards away, to \"come and see what was the matter with  these fish.\" Professing some scientific knowledge, he cut one of them  open, examined the meat and the intestines and finally pronounced it in  a healthy condition, finishing with:    \"The coffee is boiling and the bacon is fried; hurry up, and as soon  as you get a mess I'll fry them and take all chances.\"    I soon had a mess for supper and while he was frying them I caught  enough for breakfast, for the game little fellows would race for the  fly as fast as it struck the water. We ate them with a relish, for we  had had nothing but bacon, venison and frying-pan bread for a month.  As we found ourselves alive in the morning we increased the  prescription to a good alapathic dose for breakfast.    The golden trout are small, rarely reaching a length of more than  fifteen inches. The back is olive, sides and belly light orange or  golden yellow with a scarlet stripe along the center of the belly and  at the base of the pectoral, ventral and anal fins, which are of  themselves more or less of a golden color. Tail, olive, grading into  orange on the lower part. Few spots in front of the dorsal fin but  abundant behind it.    While the rainbow trout of the Coast have been given several  sub-specific names, such as =masoni= for the Coast streams of Oregon  and Washington, =shasta= and =stonei= for those of the upper  Sacramento basin, and =gilberti= for those of Kern river, there seems  to be so very little reason for this distinction beyond the usual  variations of color in all trout, spots and size with the changing  conditions of water and feed, that I shall make no mention of the very  slight variations upon which the ichthyologist has based the claim to  a sub-specific nomenclature.      THE STEELHEAD TROUT    (Salmo rivularis)    The history of the so-called steelhead trout and the efforts to class  these sea-run fishes as a species separate from the rainbow and the  cutthroat, is interesting, if not amusing. No one questioned that they  were other than the sea-run of the rainbow or the cutthroat, according  to the locality, until Dr. Richardson, mistaking a young blue-back  salmon for a so-called steelhead gave it the scientific name of =Salmo  gairdneri=, and the description of this young salmon was recognized as  that of the steelhead for years, and under this name it appears in  the statutes of California, with a separate season for its protection.  In other words the =Salmo gairdneri= of the laws of California is a  young blue-back salmon and not a sea-run trout of any kind. Recently  Dr. Ayers to correct the mistake, examined a fish taken from the  Sacramento river and said to be a steelhead, gave it the name of  =Salmo rivularis=, and this now stands as the scientific name of the  so-called steelhead. Dr. Jordan, in an article recently published in  the Pacific Monthly, says: \"There has been much discussion as to  whether the steelhead is a species really distinct from the rainbow  trout, and on this subject the writer (Jordan) has at different times  held different opinions.\"    If one authority bases his reasons for a belief in a specific  difference between the rainbow and the steelhead on the fact that he  did find a difference between a blue-back salmon and a rainbow, and  another authority finds so little difference that he holds different  opinions at different times, can there be any wonder that the  practical angler, who catches these sea-run fish at the mouths of our  rivers in every stage of transition, or gradation, if you please, from  the typical rainbow to the Simon pure steelhead, refuses to believe  that there is a specific difference?    Then again, Messrs. Jordan and Evermann in bulletin 47 of the United  States National Museum, \"The Fishes of North and Middle America,\" say:  \"In the lower course of the Columbia they (the steelhead) are entirely  distinct from the cutthroat or clarki series, and no one would  question the validity of the two species. In the lower Snake river and  other waters east of the Cascade range, the two forms or species are  indistinguishable, being either undifferentiated or else inextricably  mixed.\"    From this it would seem clear that the steelhead of the Columbia,  where the cutthroat abounds, are cutthroats that have gone to the sea,  grown larger in the larger body of water--a natural condition of all  fishes--and changed in color and appearance. That while they are yet  in the lower Columbia and only recently from the salt water, they  still maintain a sufficient difference to be easily distinguished from  the cutthroat; but by the time that they have reached the \"Snake river  and other waters east of the Cascade range,\" their long residence in  the fresh water has again restored them to their former appearance.  The same changes are found with the rainbow and the steelhead of  farther south. All trout are anadromous to greater or less extent,  unless actually landlocked or living in streams so distant from the  sea that they would be compelled to pass through long stretches of  warm and sluggish water to reach it. The small trout of the coast  streams are compelled to go to the ocean quite early in the season by  the falling of the water to such an extent that in many cases the  streams go dry before the beginning of the winter rains, and in the  larger body of water they rapidly increase in size. The steelhead of  the Columbia river always retains the cutthroat sing-manual, to  greater or less extent, while the steelhead of the lower coast has no  red on the jaw. The claim that the smaller head of the steelhead is a  distinguishing mark, fails in effect, for it is an undisputable fact  that the older and larger the trout the smaller becomes the relative  size of the head. The other claim that the larger scales of the  rainbow is a distinguishing feature from the steelhead is not founded  on facts. For while the scales of the rainbow counted along the  lateral line vary from as low as 120 in the coast streams, they run as  high as 150 in the same streams, as high as 160 in the McCloud and 185  in the Kern. The average being 135 in the smaller coast streams, 150  in the Sacramento basin, and 170 in the Kern. The steelhead's scales  run from 130 to 155. An average of 145; or exactly an average of those  of the coast streams and the Sacramento. Were it possible for the Kern  river trout to enter the ocean no doubt we would find steelhead  running as high as 185 to the section.

I held it in my hand when scarcely dead. Nothing could  exceed the beauty of the eye; the bright orange of the iris,  surrounded by the deep glossy black of the moustaches and streak  above, receives additional brilliancy from the contrast, and struck me  as a masterpiece of colour and neatness.' These specimens were  observed in the month of December. Towards the end of April the  Bearded Tit begins building its nest. This is composed externally of  the dead leaves of reeds and sedges, and lined with the feathery tops  of reed. It is generally placed in a tuft of coarse grass or rushes  near the ground on the margin of the dikes, in the fen; sometimes  among the reeds that are broken down, but never suspended between the  stems. Two nests, described by Yarrell, were composed entirely of  dried bents, the finer ones forming the lining; and others, increasing  in substance, made up the exterior. The eggs were from seven to eight  in number, rather smaller than those of the Great Tit, and less  pointed, white, and sparingly marked with pale red lines or scratches.  The same author observes that 'it is very abundant in Holland; and  numbers are brought alive from that country to the London markets for  sale; the birds being attractive in confinement from the beauty of the  plumage, their graceful form and general sprightliness.' I have seen  it stated that the moustaches, from which the bird takes its name, are  movable, and that their play gives a peculiar animation to the  expression of the bird's face, but I have never had an opportunity of  verifying this remark. They have been increasing in the Norfolk Broads  of late years.        FAMILY SITTIDA      THE NUTHATCH     SITTA CASIA        Upper plumage bluish grey; a black streak across the eye;      cheeks and throat white; under plumage dull orange red; outer      tail-feathers black, with a white spot near the end, tipped      with grey, the two central ones grey; beak bluish black, the      lower mandible white at the base; feet light brown. Length six      inches. Eggs white, spotted with two shades of purplish red.    Standing, one winter's day, by the side of a pond, near a row of tall  elms, and watching some boys sliding, I heard the few short twittering  notes of a Nuthatch overhead, and it at once occurred to me how I  should describe the note in such a way that it should be infallibly  recognized. It is precisely like the sound made by a pebble thrown so  as to bound along ice. This is the winter note. On fine sunny days in  February it begins to add to its simple call a more musical sound,  approaching a whistle. Further on in the season, the twitter is heard  no more, and is exchanged altogether for a not unmelodious whistle,  several times repeated, rarely protracted into a bubbling sound, such  as it might be supposed to make if it were rattling a pea in its  throat. On these occasions it is usually perched in the branches of a  tree, and may be distinguished by its bluish grey back, dull red  breast, and short tail. The Nuthatch is not an accomplished musician,  and claims, therefore, to be pointed out by other characteristics.  This is no difficult task to undertake; for no British bird is more  decidedly marked in its habits. In the first place, it has strong  clasping claws, which admirably adapt it for climbing; and though it  does not possess the rigid tail of the Woodpeckers to aid it in this  operation, it has a short tail which never comes in the way. In most  counties of England where old timber is (except the extreme western  and northern, where it is rare) any one walking through a woodland  district and keeping a sharp look-out may observe a bluish bird,  somewhat larger than a Sparrow, creeping by starts up the trunk of any  rough barked tree. It is so intent on its occupation--that of  searching for insects in the crevices of the bark--that it takes no  notice of the observer, but pursues its course after a method of its  own, but according to no rule that we can detect. Now it disappears on  one side of the trunk and then shows itself a few inches higher on the  other; now it is lost to sight for a longer interval--one would think  it was hiding, or had taken its departure--but no, there it is again,  creeping, back downwards, along a horizontal branch; arrived at the  extremity it utters a double twitter, perhaps, and flies either to a  new tree or to another branch of the same. This time it creeps from  the extremity of a branch towards the hole of the tree, equally at  ease whatever may chance to be its position, and no more affected by  gravity than a fly. Arrived at the main stem it keeps on its course,  still advancing by starts, and accompanying every movement, as,  indeed, it has been doing all along, by an almost imperceptible  twinkling of its wings, something like that which has gained for the  Hedge Sparrow the sobriquet of 'Shuffle-wing'. That no other bird but  the Nuthatch has the power of creeping down a tree I cannot say, for I  once observed a Tree-creeper descend for a few inches but no other  British bird does habitually hunt after this method; by this habit  consequently it may be discriminated. Equally comfortable in all  positions, if it has any choice, or desires to rest, it clings to the  upright trunk of a tree, head downwards.    The Nuthatch is singular, too, in its mode of nidification. The only  nest which I have thoroughly examined was built in the hollow of an  apple-tree, and was composed entirely of scraps of birch-bark. The  _Naturalist_ contains a description of one made of beech-bark, though  probably here, too, _birch_ is meant; others are described as being  made of dry leaves and moss: but, whatever the materials may be, the  nest itself is invariably placed in the hole of a tree. There are good  reasons for believing that in case of necessity the bird enlarges the  cavity to make its dwelling sufficiently commodious, chips of wood  having been sometimes found in the vicinity; but what makes the  Nuthatch singular among British birds is, that it not only enacts the  carpenter when occasion arises, but adds the vocation of plasterer.    In the case above alluded to I do not know that its powers were called  out in either of these capacities. As a plasterer it had no occasion  to work, for the opening to the hole was so small that it required to  be cut away in order to admit a boy's hand, but many instances are  recorded when it selected a hole with a large orifice which is  contracted by lining it with a thick coat of mud and gravel. This  parapet, constructed either to keep out bulky intruders or to keep in  the young birds, if injured or destroyed will be found restored after  a short lapse of time; and so devoted a mother is the hen bird that  she will suffer herself to be taken rather than desert her brood. I  have rarely noticed a Nuthatch on the ground during winter, but in  spring and summer it adds to its diet terrestrial insects and worms  and is said also to be partial to red currants--not a singular taste.  But the fruit which has an especial charm for the Nuthatch is that  from which it derives its name.[8] Its keen eye detects the ripening  filbert in the garden or orchard before the hazels in the wood are  beginning to turn brown, and it then despises less dainty food. One by  one the clusters are pecked open and their contents purloined,  carried, perhaps, to some convenient storehouse for future  banquetings. At any rate the owner of filbert trees where these birds  abound has need to keep a daily watch, or his share in the produce  will prove exceedingly small. I have seen trees bearing a fine crop of  husks but nearly all empty. The proprietor had suffered them to remain  till they were ripe, the Nuthatches had taken a different view of the  case and preferred them unripe rather than not at all. But what, it  may be asked, can a bird little larger than a Sparrow find to do with  a filbert, or even a hazel-nut? Here we have a fresh distinctive  feature in the biography of the Nuthatch. The bird carries off its  prey in its beak, and when in want of a meal wedges the nut in the  crevice of some rough-barked tree, such as an oak, an elm, or a  walnut. This done, he takes his stand, head downwards, above the nut,  throws back his head to gather force for a blow, and then brings it  violently forwards many times in rapid succession, aided, too, by the  weight of his body and a clapping of the wings in exact time with each  stroke. By dint of repeated blows thus dealt by his strong beak, even  the hard shell of a filbert at last gives way; a small hole is the  result, which is soon enlarged, and the kernel becomes the  hardly-earned prize. Any one who will take the trouble to examine the  trunks of old oaks and elms will be sure to find shells still  remaining wedged into the bark, and if during a ramble in the woods in  autumn or winter, or even in early spring, he should happen to hear a  smart tapping, let him follow the direction of the sound, and he will  stand a fair chance of discovering the clever little nutcracker at  work. If in the course of his operations the bird happens to dislodge  a nut, so nimble is he that before it reaches the ground he will have  caught it in his beak. Acorns and the nuts of yew-berries, and  probably other hard seeds, are similarly treated by the Nuthatch;  cherrystones, I suspect, are beyond his powers, yielding only to the  massive beak of the Hawfinch. The Nuthatch may easily be induced to  visit gardens by wedging hazel or Spanish nuts into the bark of trees;  a walnut fastened on by a pin is equally effectual. But no more  enticing bait can be set than a lump of fat meat, which should be tied  tightly by a string to the horizontal branch of an apple-tree or any  other tree, a good view of which can be commanded from the house.
