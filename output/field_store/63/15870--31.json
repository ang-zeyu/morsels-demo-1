And for this very purpose are these plates preserved,      which contain these records--that the promises of the Lord might      be fulfilled, which he made to his people; and that the Lamanites      might come to the knowledge of their fathers, and that they might      know the promises of the Lord, and that they may believe the      gospel, and rely upon the merits of Jesus Christ, and be glorified      through faith in his name, and that through their repentance they      might be saved. Amen.\"    The Prophet informs us that after receiving this revelation, the Urim  and Thummim and also the plates were taken from him, but in a few days  they were returned to him, whereupon he again inquired of the Lord and  received the following very important revelation: [12]        Now, behold, I say unto you, that because you delivered up those      writings, which you had power given unto you to translate by the      means of the Urim and Thummim, into the hands of a wicked man, you      have lost them. And you also lost your gift at the same time, and      your mind became darkened. Nevertheless, it is now restored unto      you again; therefore see that you are faithful and continue on unto      the finishing of the remainder of the work of translation as you      have begun. Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength      and means provided to enable you to translate; but be diligent      unto the end. Pray always, that you may come off conqueror; yea,      that you may conquer Satan, and that you may escape the hands of      the servants of Satan that do uphold his work. Behold, they have      sought to destroy you; yea, even the man in whom you have trusted      has sought to destroy you. And for this cause I said that he is a      wicked man, for, he has sought to take away the things wherewith      you have been entrusted; and he has also sought to destroy your      gift. And because you have delivered the writings into his hands,      behold, wicked men have taken them from you. Therefore, you have      delivered them up, yea, that which was sacred, unto wickedness.      And, behold, Satan hath put into their hearts to alter the words      which you have caused to be written, or which you have translated,      which have gone out of your hands. And behold, I say unto you, that      because they have altered the words, they read contrary from that      which you translated and caused to be written; and, on this wise,      the devil has sought to lay a cunning plan, that he may destroy      this work; for he hath put it into their hearts to do this, that by      lying they may say they have caught you in the words which you have      pretended to translate.        Verily, I say unto you, that I will not suffer that Satan shall      accomplish his evil design in this thing. For behold, he has put it      into their hearts to get thee to tempt the Lord they God, in asking      to translate it over again. And then, behold, they say and think in      their hearts--We will see if God has given him power to translate;      if so, he will also give him power again; and if God giveth him      power again, or if he translates again, or, in other words, if he      bringeth forth the same words, behold, we have the same with us,      and we have altered them; therefore they will not agree, and we      will say that he has lied in his words, and that he has no gift,      and that he has no power; therefore we will destroy him, and also      the work; and we will do this that we may not be ashamed in the      end, and that we may get glory of the world.        Verily, verily, I say unto you, that Satan has great hold upon      their hearts, he stirreth them up to iniquity against that which      is good; and their hearts are corrupt, and full of wickedness and      abominations; and they love darkness rather than light, because      their deeds are evil; therefore they will not ask of me. Satan      stirreth them up, that he may lead their souls to destruction.      And thus he has laid a cunning plan, thinking to destroy the work      of God; but I will require this at their hands, and it shall turn      to their shame and condemnation in the day of judgment. Yea, he      stirreth up their hearts to anger against this work. Yea, he saith      unto them: Deceive, and lie in wait to catch, that ye may destroy;      behold, this is no harm; and thus he flattereth them, and telleth      them that it is no sin to lie that they may catch a man in a lie,      that they may destroy him. And thus he flattereth them, and leadeth      them along until he draggeth their souls down to hell; and thus he      causeth them to catch themselves in their own snare. And thus he      goeth up and down, to and fro in the earth, seeking to destroy the      souls of men.        Verily, verily, I say unto you, woe be unto him that lieth to      deceive because he supposeth that another lieth to deceive, for      such are not exempt from the justice of God.        Now, behold, they have altered these words, because Satan saith      unto them: He hath deceived you--and thus he flattereth them away      to do iniquity, to get thee to tempt the Lord thy God.        Behold, I say unto you, that you shall not translate again those      words which have gone forth out of your hands; for, behold, they      shall not accomplish their evil designs in lying against those      words. For, behold, if you should bring forth the same words they      will say that you have lied that you have pretended to translate,      but that you have contradicted yourself. And, behold, they will      publish this, and Satan will harden the hearts of the people to      stir them up to anger against you, that they will not believe my      words. Thus Satan thinketh to overpower your testimony in this      generation, that the work may not come forth in this generation.      But behold, here is wisdom, and because I show unto you wisdom, and      give you commandments concerning these things, what you shall do,      show it not unto the world until you have accomplished the work of      translation.        Marvel not that I said unto you: here is wisdom, show it not unto      the world--for I said, show it not unto the world, that you may be      preserved. Behold, I do not say that you shall not show it unto the      righteous; but as you cannot always judge the righteous, or as you      cannot always tell the wicked from the righteous, therefore I say      unto you, hold your peace until I shall see fit to make all things      known unto the world concerning the matter.        And now, verily I say unto you, that an account of those things      that you have written, which have gone out of your hands, is      engraven upon the plates of Nephi; yea, and you remember it was      said in those writings that a more particular account was given of      these things upon the plates of Nephi.        And now, because the account which is engraven upon the plates      of Nephi is more particular concerning the things which, in my      wisdom, I would bring to the knowledge of the people in this      account therefore, you shall translate the engravings which are on      the plates of Nephi, down even till you come to the reign of King      Benjamin, or until you come to that which you have translated,      which you have retained; and behold, you shall publish it as the      record of Nephi; and thus I will confound those who have altered my      words. I will not suffer that they shall destroy my work; yea, I      will show unto them that my wisdom is greater than the cunning of      the devil.        Behold, they have only got a part, or an abridgment of the account      of Nephi. Behold, there are many things engraven upon the plates      of Nephi which do throw greater views upon my gospel; therefore,      it is wisdom in me that you should translate this first part of      the engravings of Nephi, and send forth in this work. And, behold,      all the remainder of this work does contain all those parts of my      gospel which my holy prophets, yea, and also my disciples, desired      in their prayers should come forth unto this people. And I said      unto them, that it should be granted unto them according to their      faith in their prayers; yea, and this was their faith--that my      gospel, which I gave unto them that they might preach in their      days, might come unto their brethren the Lamanites, and also all      that had become Lamanites because of their dissensions.        Now, this is not all--their faith in their prayers was that this      gospel should be made known also, if it were possible that other      nations should possess this land; and thus they did leave a      blessing upon this land in their prayers, that whosoever should      believe in this gospel in this land might have eternal life; yea,      that it might be free unto all of whatsoever nation, kindred,      tongue, or people they may be.        And now, behold, according to their faith in their prayers will I      bring this part of my gospel to the knowledge of my people Behold,      I do not bring it to destroy that which they have received, but to      build it up.        And for this cause have I said: if this generation harden not their      hearts, I will establish my church among them. Now I do not say      this to destroy my church, but I say this to build up my church;      therefore, whosoever belongeth to my church need not fear, for such      shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. But it is they who do not      fear me, neither keep my commandments but build up churches unto      themselves to get gain, yea, and all those"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4732"],[0,"Prolegomena to the History of Israel (#20)"],[1,"no more oblations; it is an abominable  incense to me.\"  Deuteronomy xxxiii. 10: \"The Levites shall put incense  (i.e.,the fat of thank-offerings) before thee, and whole  burnt-offerings upon thine altar.\" The name LBNT (frankincense)  first occurs in Jeremiah (vi. 20, xvii. 26, xli. 5); elsewhere only  in the Priestly Code (nine times), in Isaiah xl.-lxvi. (three  times), in Chronicles and Nehemiah (three times), and in Canticles  (three times). Compare Zephaniah iii. 10; 1Kings ix. 25.  ************************************    In enumerations where the prophets exhaust everything pertaining to  sacred gifts and liturgic performances, in which, for the sake  of lengthening the catalogue, they do not shrink from repetitions even,  there is not any mention of incense-offerings, neither in Amos  (iv. 4 seq., v. 21 seq.) nor in Isaiah (i. 11 seq.) nor in Micah  (vi. 6 seq.).  Shall we suppose that they all of them forget this  subject by mere accident, or that they conspired to ignore it?  If it had really existed, and been of so great consequence, surely  one of them at least would not have failed to speak of it.  The Jehovistic section of the Hexateuch is equally silent, so also  the historical books, except Chronicles, and so the rest of the prophets,  down to Jeremiah, who (vi.20) selects incense as the example of a rare  and far-fetched offering: \"To what purpose cometh there to me incense  from Sheba, and the precious cane from a far country?\"  Thenceforward it is mentioned in Ezekiel, in Isaiah (xl.-lxvi.),  in Nehemiah, and in Chronicles; the references are continuous.  The  introduction of incense is a natural result of increased luxury;  one is tempted to conjecture that its use must have first crept  into the Jehovah worship as an innovation from a more  luxuriously-developed foreign cultus.  But the importance which it  has attained in the ritual legislation of the Pentateuch is  manifest above all from this, that it has led to the invention of a  peculiar new and highly sacred piece of furniture, namely, the  golden altar in the inner tabernacle, which is unknown to history,  and which is foreign even to the kernel of the Priestly Code  itself.    We expect to find the altar of incense in Exodus xxv.-xxix., but  find it instead as an appendix at the beginning of Exodus xxx.  Why  not until now? why thus separated from the other furnishings of  the inner sanctuary? and not only so, but even after the  ordinances relating to the adornment of the priests, and the  inauguration of the divine service?  The reason why the author of  chaps. xxv.-xxix. is thus silent about the altar of incense in  the passage in which the furniture of the tabernacle, consisting of  ark, table, and candlestick, is described, is, that he does not  know of it.  There is no other possibility; for he cannot have  forgotten it. /1/    ***************************************  1. There is a peculiar perversity in meeting the objection by  alleging other singularities in the ordinance as for example, that  the vessels of the tabernacle are appointed (chap. xxv.) before  the tabernacle itself (chap. xxvi.).  This last is no  eccentricity; the order in commanding is first the end, and then  the means; but in obeying, the order is reversed.  In like manner,  it is not at all surprising if subsidiary implements, such as  benches for slaughtering. or basins for washing, which have no  importance for the cultus, properly so called, should be either  passed over altogether, or merely brought in as an appendix.  The  case is not at all parallel with the omission of the most important  utensil of the sanctuary from the very passage to which it  necessarily belongs.  *****************************************    And the phenomenon is repeated; the altar of incense occurs only  in certain portions of the Priestly Code, and is absent from  others where it could not possibly have been omitted, had it been  known.  The rite of the most solemn atoning sacrifice takes place  in Leviticus iv. indeed on the golden altar, but in Exodus xxix.,  Leviticus viii., ix., without its use.  A still more striking  circumstance is, that in passages where the holiest incense-offering  itself is spoken of, no trace can be discovered of the corresponding  altar.  This is particularly the case in Leviticus xvi.  To burn incense  in the sanctuary, Aaron takes a censer, fills it with coals from the  altar of burnt-offering (ver. 12, 18-20), and lays the incense  upon them in the adytum.   Similarly in Leviticus x., Numbers xvi.,  xvii., incense is offered on censers, of which each priest  possesses one.  The coals are taken from the altar of  burnt-offering (Numbers xvii. 11; [A.V. xvi. 46]), which is plated  with the censers of the Korahite Levites (xvii. 3, 4; [A.V.  xvi. 38, 39]); whoever takes fire from any other source, incurs  the penalty of death (Leviticus x. 1 seq.).  The altar of incense is  everywhere unknown here; the altar of burnt-offering is the only  altar, and, moreover, is always called simply 'the altar', as for  example, even in Exodus xxvii., where it would have been specially  necessary to add the qualifying expression.  Only in certain  later portions of the Priestly Code does the name altar of  burnt-offering occur, viz, in those passages which do recognise the  altar of incense.  In this connection the command of Exodus xxvii.  as compared with the execution in Exodus xxxviii. is  characteristic.    The golden altar in the sanctuary is originally simply the  golden table; the variation of the expression has led to a  doubling of the thing.  Ezekiel does not distinguish between the  table and the altar in the temple, but uses either expression  indifferently.  For he says (xii.21 seq. ): \"Before the adytum  stood what looked like an altar of wood, three cubits in height,  two cubits in length and breadth, and it had projecting corners,  and its frame and its walls were of wood; this is the table which  is before the Lord.\" In like manner he designates the service of  the priests in the inner sanctuary as table-service (xliv.16);  table is the name, altar the function. /1/    ****************************************  1. Malachi, on the other hand, designates the so-called altar  of burnt-offering as a table.  ****************************************    In 1Kings vii. 48, it is true that the golden altar and the golden  table are mentioned together.  It seems strange, however, that in  this case the concluding summary mentions one piece of furniture  more-- and that piece one of so great importance--than the preceding  detailed description; for in the latter only the preparation of the  golden altar is spoken of, and nothing is said of the golden table  (vi. 20-22).  As matters stand, nothing is less improbable than that  some later transcriber should have interpolated the golden table  in vii. 48, regarding it, in accordance with the Pentateuch, as  distinct from the golden altar, and therefore considering its  absence as an omission.   From other considerations also, it is  clear that the text of the whole chapter is in many ways corrupt  and interpolated.    It is not to be wondered at if in the post-exilian temple there  existed both a golden altar and a golden table.  We learn from  1Maccabees i. 21 seq., iv. 49, that both were carried off by  Antiochus Epiphanes, and renewed at the Feast of the Dedication.  But it causes no small surprise to find that at the destruction  of Jerusalem the Romans found and carried off table and candlestick  only.  What can have become, in the meantime, of the golden altar  of incense?  And it is further worth remarking that in the LXX the  passage Exodus xxxvii.25-29 is absent; that is to say, the altar  of incense is indeed commanded, but there is no word of its  execution.  In these circumstances, finally, the vacillating  statement as to its position in Exodus xxx. 6, and the supposed  mistake of the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, are important  and intelligible.  Compare also 2Maccabees ii.5, where only the table,  but not the altar, is hidden by Jeremiah.    So much for the offering of incense and its altar.  We may in  like manner venture to regard it as a kind of refinement, though  rather a refinement of idea, that the flesh of the sacrifice in the  Priestly Code is no longer boiled, but consigned to the altar  flames in its raw condition.  Such was not the ancient custom, as  is seen, not only  from the case of Gideon already cited (Judges  vi.), but also from the procedure at Shiloh, described in 1Samuel  ii., where the sons of Eli will not wait until the flesh of the  sacrifice has been boiled, and the altar pieces burnt, but demand  their share raw for roasting.  The meal which the Deity shares  with men is prepared in the same way as for men.  This naive  conception gave way before advancing culture, and that at a  comparatively early date.  It is possible that another cause may  also have co-operated towards this result.  The old method of  preparing flesh in general use among the people, at a later period  also, was by boiling.  The word B#L (to seethe in water) occurs  with extreme frequency; CLH (to roast), on the other hand, only  in Exodus xii. 8, and Isaiah xliv. 16, 19.  All sacrificial flesh  (B#LH) was boiled, and there was no other kind. /1/    ***********************************************  1. Accordingly one must understand (#H also of boiling (Judges vi. 19).  Compare the boiling-houses of the temple still found in Ezekiel  xlvi. 20-24.  In I Sam. i. 9 pronounce _beshela_ instead of _beshilo_,  and delete W)XRY #TH.  **********************************************    But among persons of the upper class roasting must also have come  into use at an early period.  \"Give flesh to roast for the priest;  for he will not take sodden flesh of thee, but raw,\" says the  servant of the sons of Eli in 1Samuel ii. 15.  The fact that in the  interval the custom of boiling had"]]]
