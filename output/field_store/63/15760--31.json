[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3689"],[0,"Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 1 (#20)"],[1,"Hermann Scholtz, Chamber  virtuoso in Dresden.--The addressee, who was an intimate friend  of Wagner's (see \"Wagner's Letters to Uhlig, Fischer, Heine\"--  London: H. Grevel & Co., 1890), gained for himself a lasting name  by his pianoforte score of Lohengrin. He died January, 1853.]    The perusal of your most kind and judicious article in Brendel's  Musical Gazette on the \"Goethe Foundation\" [By Liszt, 1850. See  \"Gesammelte Schriften,\" vol. v.] confirms me in the belief that I  could not fail to be understood by you in full intelligence of  the cause. Allow me then, my dear Mr. Uhlig, to thank you very  cordially for this new proof of your obligingness and of your  sympathy--in French, as this language becomes more and more  familiar and easy to me, whereas I am obliged to make an effort  to patch up more or less unskillfully my very halting German  syntax.    The very lucid explanation that you have made of my pamphlet, as  well as the lines with which you have prefaced and followed it,  have given me a real satisfaction, and one which I did not expect  to receive through that paper, which, if I am not mistaken, had  hitherto shown itself somewhat hostile to me personally, and to  the ideas which they do me the small honor to imagine I possess.  This impression has been still further increased in me by reading  Mr. Brendel's following article on R. Wagner, which seems to me a  rather arranged transition between the former point of view of  the Leipzig school or pupils and the real point of view of  things. The quotation Brendel makes of Stahr's article on the  fifth performance of \"Lohengrin\" at Weymar, evidently indicates a  conversion more thought than expressed on the part of the former,  and at the performance of \"Siegfried\" I am persuaded that Leipzig  will not be at all behindhand, as at \"Lohengrin.\"    I do not know whether Mr. Wolf (the designer) has had the  pleasure of meeting you yet at Dresden; I had commissioned him to  make my excuses to you for the delay in sending the manuscript of  Wiland. Unfortunately it is impossible for me to think of  returning to Weymar before the end of July, and the manuscript is  locked up among other papers which I could not put into strange  hands. Believe me that I am really vexed at these delays, the  cause of which is so sad for me.    If by chance you should repass by Cologne and Minden, it would be  very nice if you could stay a day at Buckeburg (Eilsen), where I  am obliged to stay till the 15th of July. I have not much  pleasure to offer you, but in return we can talk there at our  ease of the St. Graal...    My pamphlet \"Lohengrin and Tannhauser\" will appear in French at  Brockhaus' towards the end of July. It will have at least the  same circulation as the \"Goethe Foundation,\" and I will send you  by right one of the first copies.    Kind regards to Wagner, about whom I have written a great deal  lately without writing to him; and believe me yours very  sincerely,    F. Liszt    Eilsen (Buckeburg), June 25th, 1851.        76. To Rosalie Spohr in Brunswick    [niece of Louis Spohr, and an incomparable harpist,--\"The most  ideal representative of her beautiful instrument,\" according to  Bulow; after her marriage with Count Sauerma she retired from  public life and now lives in Berlin.]    After your amiable authorization to do so, Mademoiselle, I have  had your concert announced at Eilsen for Tuesday next, July 8th,  and you may rest assured that the best society of Buckeburg and  of the Badegaste [visitors who go for the baths] will be present.    The price of the tickets has been fixed for 1 florin, which is  the maximum customary in this country. With regard to the  programme, I await your reply, in which I shall be glad if you  will tell me the four or five pieces you will choose, amongst  which will be, I hope, Parish Alvars' Fantaisie on motives from  \"Oberon\" and the \"Danse des Fees.\"    A distinguished amateur, Monsieur Lindemann of Hanover, has  promised me to play one or two violoncello solos, and the rest of  the programme will be easily made.    As to your route, you had better take the Schnellzug [express]  next Monday, which starts about 11 in the morning from Brunswick,  and brings you to Buckeburg in less than three hours. From here  it will only take you thirty-five minutes to get to Eilsen. The  most simple plan for you would be not to write to me beforehand  even, but to improvise your programme according to your fancy  here. Only let me beg you not to arrive later than Monday  evening, so that the public may be free from anxiety, and to set  my responsibility perfectly at rest in a corner of your harp-  case.    May I beg you, Mademoiselle, to remember me affectionately to  your father? and be assured of the pleasure it will be to see  you, hear you, and admire you anew, to your sincere and devoted  servant,    F. Liszt    Eilsen, July 3rd, 1851    I beg you once more not to be later than next Monday, July 7th,  in coming to Eilsen.        77. To Rosalie Spohr    I am deeply sensible of your charming lines, Mademoiselle, the  impression of which is the completion for me of the harmonious  vibrations of your beautiful talent,--vibrations which are still  resounding in the woods and in your auditors at Eilsen. While  expressing to you my sincere thanks I should reproach myself were  I to forget the piquant and substantial present that your father  has sent me, and I beg you to tell him that we have done all  honor to the savory product of Brunswick industry. The Buckeburg  industry having a certain reputation in petto in the matter of  chocolate, the Princess, who sends her best regards to you and  your family, wishes me to send you a sample, which you will  receive by tomorrow's post. The chocolate, in its quality of a  sedative tonic, will, moreover, not come amiss in the intervals  of your study.    May I beg you, Mademoiselle, to give my affectionate compliments  to your parents as well as to the clever drawing-historiographer  [The younger sister of the addressee, Ida Spohr, at that time  sixteen years old, who was a most gifted creature, both in  poetry, painting, and music. She died young, at the age of  twenty-four] whom you know? and receive once more the best wishes  of yours most truly,    F. Liszt    Eilsen, July 22nd, 1851        78. To Breitkopf and Hartel    Allow me, my dear Mr. Hartel, to make known to you, as a kind of  curiosity, a very long piece I composed last winter on the  chorale \"Ad Nos\" from the \"Prophete.\" If by chance you should  think well to publish this long Prelude, followed by an equally  long Fugue, I could not be otherwise than much obliged to you;  and I shall take advantage of the circumstance to acquit myself,  in all reverence and friendship, of a dedication to Meyerbeer,  which it has long been my intention to do; and it was only for  want of finding among my works something which would suit him in  some respect, that I have been obliged to defer it till now. I  should be delighted therefore if you would help me to fill up  this gap in the recognition I owe to Meyerbeer; but I dare not  press you too much for fear you may think that my Fugue has more  advantage in remaining unknown to the public in so far that it is  in manuscript, than if it had to submit to the same fate after  having been published by your care.    In accordance with your obliging promise, I waited from week to  week for the preface that Mr. Wagner has added to his three opera  poems. I should be glad to know how soon you expect to bring them  out, and beg you to be so good as to send me immediately three  copies.    Believe me, my dear Mr. Hartel,    Yours affectionately and most truly,    F. Liszt    Weymar, December 1st, 1851    P.S.--Would it perhaps do to bring out my Fugue on the \"Prophete\"  as No. 4 of my \"Illustrations du Prophete\"? That was at least my  first intention. [It was published in that form by Breitkopf and  Hartel.] In the same parcel you will find the piano score of the  \"Prophete,\" which I am very much obliged to you for having lent  me.        79. To Louis Kohler in Konigsberg    [An important piano teacher and writer on music, and composer of  valuable instructive works (1820-86).]    Dear Sir,    The friendly kindness with which you have spoken of a couple of  my latest compositions lays me under an obligation of warm  thanks, which I must no longer delay having the pleasure of  expressing to you. I should be very glad if you find anything  that suits you in my next impending piano publication (the new,  entirely revised edition of my Studies, the \"Harmonies Poetiques  et Religieuses,\" and the two years of \"Annees de Pelerinage,  Suite de Compositions,\" etc.). In any case I shall venture to  send this work, with the request that you will accept it as a  token of my gratitude for the favorable opinion which you  entertain of my artistic efforts.    At this moment I have to compliment you also very much on your  arrangement of the Hungarian \"Volkslieder\" [Folk Songs]. For  several years past I have been occupied with a similar work, and  next winter I think of publishing the result of my national  studies in a pretty big volume of \"Hungarian Rhapsodies.\" Your  transcriptions have interested me much through the correct  perception of the melodies, and their elegant though simple  style.    Senff [The well-known Leipzig music publisher.] showed me also in  manuscript a book of Russian melodies, that seemed to me most  successful. When will it come out?    If by any chance you have a spare copy of your new work, the  exact title of which I do not remember, but it is somewhat as  follows, \"Opern am Clavier\" [Operas at the Piano] or \"Opern fur  Clavierspieler\" [Operas for Pianoforte Players] (or, in French,  \"Repertoire d'Opera pour les Pianistes\"), I should be much  obliged if you would let me have one.    Accept, dear sir, my best respects, and believe me    Yours truly,    F.

He was cautiously transferred to a Compressorium,[24]  an apparatus by which the approach of two thin plates of glass can be  regulated by the action of a spring and a screw; and just enough  pressure was employed to keep him from changing his place, although he  was able to move his tiny limbs. Thus arranged, he was placed under a  power of two hundred and forty linear, and illuminated by an achromatic  condenser,[25] to make the fine structure of his gizzard as plain as  possible. It was then seen that this curious organ contains several  prominences or teeth, and is composed of muscular fibres, radiating in  every direction. From the front of the gizzard proceed two rods, which  meet in a point, and are supposed to represent the maxillae or jaws of  insects, while between them is a tube or channel, through which the food  is passed. The mouth is _suctorial_, and the two horny rods, with their  central piece or pieces, are protrusile. They were frequently brought as  far as the outer lips (if we may so call the margins of the mouth), but  we did not witness an actual protrusion, except when the lips  accompanied them, and formed a small round pouting orifice. The skin of  the animal was tough and somewhat loose, and wrinkled during the  contractions its proprietor made. The interior of the body exhibited an  immense multitude of globular particles of various sizes in constant  motion, but not moving in any vessels, or performing a distinct  circulation.    [24] The best forms of this instrument are made by Messrs. R. & J. Beck,  the glass plates being held in their places by flat-headed screws, and  not by cement. This plan was devised by the author, and makes it easy to  renew the glasses when broken.    [25] The achromatic condenser is a frame capable of supporting an  object-glass, lower than that employed for vision, through which the  light passes to the object in quantities and directions determined by  stops of various shapes. The appearances mentioned can be seen without  it, though not so well.    My specimens had no visible eyes, and these organs are, according to  Pritchard's book, \"variable and fugacious.\" The same authority remarks,  \"In most vital phenomena they very closely accord with the rotatoria;  thus like these they can be revived after being put into hot water at  113 deg. to 118 deg., but are destroyed by immersion in boiling water. They may  be gradually heated to 216 deg., 252 deg., and even 261 deg. It is also by their  capability of resuscitation after being dried that they are able to  sustain their vitality in such localities as the roofs of houses, where  at one time they are subjected to great heat and excessive drought, and  at another are immersed in water.\"    When vital processes are not stopped by excess of temperature, as is the  case with the higher animals, the power of resisting heat without  destruction depends upon the condition of the albumen. Soluble albumen,  or, as it should be called, _Albuminate of Soda_ (for a small quantity  of that alkali is present and chemically united with it), after having  been _thoroughly dried_, may be heated without loss of its solubility;  although if the same temperature was applied before it was dry, that  solubility would be destroyed, and it would no longer be a fit  constituent of a living creature. As Dr. Carpenter observes, this fact  is of much interest in explaining the tenacity of life in the  Tardigrada.    The movements of the water-bears, although slow, evince a decided  purpose and ability to make all parts work together for one common  object; and as might be expected from this fact, and also from the  repetition of distinct, although not articulated limbs, they are  provided with a nervous apparatus of considerable development, in the  shape of a chain of a ganglia and a brain, with connecting filaments.  From these and other circumstances naturalists consider the Tardigrada  to belong to the great family of _Spiders_, of which they are,  physiologically speaking, _poor relations_. Siebold says \"they form the  transition from the Arachnoidae to the Annelides.\"[26] Like the spiders  they cast their skin; and, although I was not fortunate enough to  witness this operation--called in the language of the learned _ecdysis_,  which means putting its clothes off--I found an empty hide, which,  making allowance for the comparative size of the creatures, looked tough  and strong as that of a rhinoceros, and showed that the stripping  process extended to the tips of the claws. The 'Micrographic Dictionary'  states that the Tardigrada lay but few eggs at a time, and these are  \"usually deposited during the ecdysis, the exuviae serving as a  protection to them during the process of hatching.\" Thus Mrs. Water-Bear  makes a nursery out of her old skin, a device as ingenious as  unexpected. The water-bears are said to be hermaphrodites, but this is  improbable.    [26] 'Anatomy of the Invertebrata,' Burnett's trans., p. 364.    The _Plumatella repens_, described in a former chapter, was kept in a  glass trough, to which some fresh water was added every few days, taken  from a glass jar that had been standing many weeks with growing  anacharis in it. One day a singular creature made its appearance in the  trough; when magnified sixty diameters it resembled an oval bladder,  with a sort of proboscis attached to it. At one part it was  longitudinally constricted, and evidently possessed some branched and  complicated internal vessel. The surface was ciliated, and the neck or  proboscis acted as a rudder, and enabled the creature to execute rapid  turns. It swam up and down, and round about, sometimes rotating on its  axis, at others keeping the same side uppermost, but did not exhibit the  faintest sign of intelligence in its movements, except an occasional  finger-like bend of the proboscis, upon which the cilia seemed thicker  than upon the body. It was big enough to be observed as a moving white  speck by the naked eye, when the vessel containing it was held to catch  the light slantingly; but a power of one hundred and five was  conveniently employed to enable its structure to be discerned. Under  this power, when the animal was resting or moving slowly, a mouth was  perceived on the left side of the proboscis, which was usually, though  not always, curved to the right. The mouth was a round or oval orifice,  and when illuminated by the parabola, its lips or margin looked  thickened, and of a pale blue, and ciliated, while the rest of the body  assumed a pinkish pearly tint.    Below the mouth came a funnel-shaped tube or oesophagus, having some  folds or plaits on its sides, and terminating in a broad digestive tube,  distinct from the nucleus, and ramifying like a tree. The constriction  before mentioned, which was always seen in certain positions, although  it varied _very considerably_ in depth and width, drew up the integument  towards the main trunk of the digestive tube, and thus the animal had a  distinct ventral and dorsal side. The branches of the tube stopped  somewhat abruptly just before reaching the surface, and were often  observed to end in small round vacuoles or vesicles.    [Illustration: Trachelius ovum (slightly flattened).]    At the bottom of the bladder, opposite the mouth, in some specimens were  large round cavities or cells, filled with smaller cells, or partially  transparent granules. These varied in number from one to two or three,  and were replaced in other specimens by masses that did not present the  same regular form or rounded outline. In one instance an amorphous  structure of this kind gradually divided itself, and seemed in the  course of forming two cells, but the end of the process was  unfortunately not seen. The annexed drawing will readily enable the  animal to be recognised. It shows the mouth very plainly, and a current  of small particles moving towards it. The oesophagus terminates in a  digestive tube, like the trunk of a tree, from which numerous branches  spring. This arrangement is probably analogous to that of the  phlebenterous mollusks described by Quatrefages, in which the  ramifications of the stomach answer the purpose of arteries, and convey  the nutrient fluid to various parts of the body. It is also likely that  they minister to the function of respiration.    The cilia on the surface, which are arranged in parallel lines, are best  observed when the animal is slightly flattened in a live-box; but this  process produces a considerable derangement in the relative position of  the internal parts, and they can only be well seen when it is immersed  in plenty of water, and is polite enough to stand still, and submit his  digestive economy to a steady gaze. The only way to succeed in this  undertaking is to have a large stock of patience as well as a convenient  cell or trough. The table must be kept steady, and the prisoner watched  from time to time, and at last he will be found ready for display.    Pritchard says this animal, whose name is _Trachelius ovum_, is an  inhabitant of stagnant bog water, and has been found encysted. My  specimens could not be called plentiful, but for several weeks I could  generally find two or three, by filling a four-ounce vial from the glass  jar, and examining its contents with a pocket-lens. If none were  present, another dip was made, and usually with success.    One evening I caught a good specimen by means of the dipping-tube, and  cautiously let it out, accompanied by a drop of water, on the glass  floor of the live-box. A glance with the pocket-lens showed all was  right, and the cover was very gently put on, but it had scarcely touched  the creature when it became crumpled up and in confusion. On one or two  former occasions I had been unfortunate enough to give my captives a  squeeze too much, with the usual result of a rupture of their"]]]
