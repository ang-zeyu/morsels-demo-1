Still, the work has been done,  and, link by link, the chain has been constructed that unites the horse  of to-day with the horse of very many yesterdays.    The very first links in this chain are the remains of the bronze age  and those found among the ruins of the ancient Swiss lake dwellings; but  earlier still than these are the bones of horses found abundantly in  northern Europe, Asia, and America. The individual bones and teeth of  some of these horses are scarcely distinguishable from those of to-day,  a fact noted in the name, _Equus fraternus_, applied to one species; and  when teeth alone are found, it is at times practically impossible to say  whether they belong to a fossil horse or to a modern animal. But when  enough scattered bones are gathered to make a fairly complete skeleton,  it becomes evident that the fossil horse had a proportionately larger  head and smaller feet than his existing relative, and that he was a  little more like an ass or zebra, for the latter, spite of his gay coat,  is a near relative of the lowly ass. Moreover, primitive man made  sketches of the primitive horse, just as he did of the mammoth, and  these indicate that the horse of those days was something like an  overgrown Shetland pony, low and heavily built, large-headed and  rough-coated. For the old cave-dwellers of Europe were intimately  acquainted with the prehistoric horses, using them for food, as they  did almost every animal that fell beneath their flint arrows and stone  axes. And if one may judge from the abundance of bones, the horses must  have roamed about in bands, just as the horses escaped from civilization  roam, or have roamed, over the pampas of South America and the prairies  of the West.    The horse was just as abundant in North America in Pleistocene time as  in Europe; but there is no evidence to show that it was contemporary  with early man in North America, and, even were this the case, it is  generally believed that long before the discovery of America the horse  had disappeared. And yet, so plentiful and so fresh are his remains, and  so much like those of the mustang, that the late Professor Cope was wont  to say that it almost seemed as if the horse _might_ have lingered in  Texas until the coming of the white man. And Sir William Flower wrote:  \"There is a possibility of the animal having still existed, in a wild  state, in some parts of the continent remote from that which was first  visited by the Spaniards, where they were certainly unknown. It has  been suggested that the horses which were found by Cabot in La Plata in  1530 cannot have been introduced.\"    Still we have not the least little bit of positive proof that such was  the case, and although the site of many an ancient Indian village has  been carefully explored, no bones of the horse have come to light, or if  they have been found, bones of the ox or sheep were also present to tell  that the village was occupied long after the advent of the whites. It is  also a curious fact that within historic times there have been no wild  horses, in the true sense of the word, unless indeed those found on the  steppes north of the Sea of Azof be wild, and this is very doubtful. But  long before the dawn of history the horse was domesticated in Europe,  and Caesar found the Germans, and even the old Britons, using war  chariots drawn by horses--for the first use man seems to have made of  the horse was to aid him in killing off his fellow-man, and not until  comparatively modern times was the animal employed in the peaceful arts  of agriculture. The immediate predecessors of these horses were  considerably smaller, being about the size and build of a pony, but  they were very much like a horse in structure, save that the teeth were  shorter. As they lived during Pliocene times, they have been named  \"Pliohippus.\"    Going back into the past a step farther, though a pretty long step if we  reckon by years, we come upon a number of animals very much like horses,  save for certain cranial peculiarities and the fact that they had three  toes on each foot, while the horse, as every one knows, has but one toe.  Now, if we glance at the skeleton of a horse, we will see on either side  of the canon-bone, in the same situation as the upper part of the little  toes of the Hippotherium, as these three-toed horses are called, a long  slender bone, termed by veterinarians the splint bone; and it requires  no anatomical training to see that the bones in the two animals are the  same. The horse lacks the lower part of his side toes, that is all, just  as man will very probably some day lack the last bones of his little  toe. We find an approach to this condition in some of the Hippotheres  even, known as Protohippus, in which the side toes are quite small,  foreshadowing the time when they shall have disappeared entirely. It may  also be noted here that the splint bones of the horses of the bronze age  are a little longer than those of existing horses, and that they are  never united with the large central toe, while nowadays there is  something of a tendency for the three bones to fuse into one, although  part of this tendency the writer believes to be due to inflammation set  up by the strain of the pulling and hauling the animal is now called  upon to do. Some of these three-toed Hippotheres are not in the direct  line of ancestry of the horse, but are side branches on the family tree,  having become so highly specialized in certain directions that no  further progress horseward was possible.    Backward still, and the bones we find in the Miocene strata of the West,  belonging to those ancestors of the horse to which the name of  Mesohippus has been given because they are midway in time and structure  between the horse of the past and present, tell us that then all horses  were small and that all had three toes on a foot, while the fore feet  bore even the suggestion of a fourth toe. From this to our Eocene  Hyracothere with four toes is only another long-time step. We may go  even beyond this in time and structure, and carry back the line of the  horse to animals which only remotely resembled him and had five good  toes to a foot; but while these contained the possibility of a horse,  they made no show of it.    [Illustration: Fig. 34.--The Development of the Horse.]    Increase in size and decrease in number of the toes were not the only  changes that were required to transform the progeny of the Hyracothere  into a horse. These are the most evident; but the increased complexity  in the structure of the teeth was quite as important. The teeth of  gnawing animals have often been compared to a chisel which is made of a  steel plate with soft iron backing, and the teeth of a horse, or of  other grass-eating animals, are simply an elaboration of this idea. The  hard enamel, which represents the steel, is set in soft dentine, which  represents the iron, and in use the dentine wears away the faster of the  two, so that the enamel stands up in ridges, each tooth becoming, as it  is correctly termed, \"a grinder.\" In a horse the plates of enamel form  curved, complex, irregular patterns; but as we go back in time, the  patterns become less and less elaborate, until in the Hyracothere,  standing at the foot of the family tree, the teeth are very simple in  structure. Moreover, his teeth were of limited growth, while those of  the horse grow for a considerable time, thus compensating for the wear  to which they are subjected.    We have, then, this direct evidence as to the genealogy of the horse,  that between the little Eocene Hyracothere and the modern horse we can  place a series of animals by which we can pass by gradual stages from  one to the other, and that as we come upward there is an increase in  stature, in the complexity of the teeth, and in the size of the brain.  At the same time, the number of toes decreases, which tells that the  animals were developing more and more speed; for it is a rule that the  fewer the toes the faster the animal: the fastest of birds, the ostrich,  has but two toes, and one of these is mostly ornamental; and the fastest  of mammals, the horse, has but one.    All breeders of fancy stock, particularly of pigeons and poultry,  recognize the tendency of animals to revert to the forms whence they  were derived and reproduce some character of a distant ancestor; to  \"throw back,\" as the breeders term it. If now, instead of reproducing a  trait or feature possessed by some ancestor a score, a hundred, or  perhaps a thousand years ago, there should reappear a characteristic of  some ancestor that flourished 100,000 years back, we should have a  seeming abnormality, but really a case of reversion; and the more we  become acquainted with the structure of extinct animals and the  development of those now living, the better able are we to explain these  apparent abnormalities.    Bearing in mind that the two splint bones of the horse correspond to the  upper portions of the side toes of the Hippotherium and Mesohippus, it  is easy to see that if for any reason these should develop into toes,  they would make the foot of a modern horse appear like that of his  distant ancestor. While such a thing rarely happens, yet now and then  nature apparently does attempt to reproduce a horse's foot after the  ancient pattern, for occasionally we meet with a horse having, instead  of the single toe with which the average horse is satisfied, one or  possibly two extra toes. Sometimes the toe is extra in every sense of  the word, being a mere duplication of the central toe; but sometimes it  is an actual development of one of the splint bones. No less a personage  than Julius Caesar possessed one of these polydactyl horses, and the  reporters of the _Daily Roman_ and the _Tiberian Gazette_ doubtless  wrote it up in good journalistic Latin, for we find the horse"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3803"],[0,"File No. 113 (#20)"],[1," What had taken place  during the nine days that he had been cut off from all intercourse with  his friends? No news of them had reached him. He had heard no more of  what was going on in the outside world, than if his secret cell had been  a grave.    He slowly walked along the streets, with his eyes cast down dreading to  meet some familiar face. He, who had always been so haughty, would now  be pointed at with the finger of scorn. He would be greeted with cold  looks and averted faces. Men would refuse to shake hands with him. He  would be shunned by honest people, who have no patience with a thief.    Still, if he could count on only one true friend! Yes: he was sure of  one. But what friend would believe him when his father, who should have  been the last to suspect him, had refused to believe him?    In the midst of his sufferings, when he felt almost overwhelmed by the  sense of his wretched, lonely condition, he thought of Gypsy.    He had never loved the poor girl: indeed, at times he almost hated her;  but now he felt a longing to see her. He wished to be with her, because  he knew that she loved him, and that nothing would make her believe him  guilty; because he knew that a woman remains true and firm in her faith,  and is always faithful in the hour of adversity, although she sometimes  fails in prosperity.    On entering the Rue Chaptal, Prosper saw his own door, but hesitated to  enter it.    He suffered from the timidity which an honest man always feels when he  knows he is viewed with suspicion.    He dreaded meeting anyone whom he knew; yet he could not remain in the  street. He entered.    When the porter saw him, he uttered an exclamation of glad surprise, and  said:    \"Ah, here you are at last, monsieur. I told everyone you would come out  as white as snow; and, when I read in the papers that you were arrested  for robbery, I said, 'My third-floor lodger a thief! Never would I  believe such a thing, never!'\"    The congratulations of this ignorant man were sincere, and offered from  pure kindness of heart; but they impressed Prosper painfully, and he cut  them short by abruptly asking:    \"Madame of course has left: can you tell me where she has gone?\"    \"Dear me, no, monsieur. The day of your arrest, she sent for a hack, got  into it with her trunks, and disappeared; and no one has seen or heard  of her since.\"    This was another blow to the unhappy cashier.    \"And where are my servants?\"    \"Gone, monsieur; your father paid and discharged them.\"    \"I suppose you have my keys?\"    \"No, monsieur; when your father left here this morning at eight o'clock,  he told me that a friend of his would take charge of your rooms until  you should return. Of course you know who he is--a stout gentleman with  red whiskers.\"    Prosper was stupefied. What could be the meaning of one of his father's  friends being in his rooms? He did not, however, betray any surprise,  but quietly said:    \"Yes: I know who it is.\"    He quickly ran up the stairs, and knocked at his door.    It was opened by his father's friend.    He had been accurately described by the porter. A fat man, with a red  face, sensual lips, brilliant eyes, and of rather coarse manners, stood  bowing to Prosper, who had never seen him before.    \"Delighted to make your acquaintance, monsieur,\" said he to Prosper.    He seemed to be perfectly at home. On the table lay a book, which he had  taken from the bookcase; and he appeared ready to do the honors of the  house.    \"I must say, monsieur,\" began Prosper.    \"That you are surprised to find me here? So I suppose. Your father  intended introducing me to you; but he was compelled to return to  Beaucaire this morning; and let me add that he departed thoroughly  convinced, as I myself am, that you never took a cent from M. Fauvel.\"    At this unexpected good news, Prosper's face lit up with pleasure.    \"Here is a letter from your father, which I hope will serve as an  introduction between us.\"    Prosper opened the letter; and as he read his eyes grew brighter, and a  slight color returned to his pale face.    When he had finished, he held out his hand to the large gentleman, and  said:    \"My father, monsieur, tells me you are his best friend; he advises me to  have absolute confidence in you, and follow your counsel.\"    \"Exactly. This morning your father said to me, 'Verduret'--that is my  name--'Verduret, my son is in great trouble, he must be helped out.' I  replied, 'I am ready,' and here I am to help you. Now the ice is broken,  is it not? Then let us go to work at once. What do you intend to do?\"    This question revived Prosper's slumbering rage. His eyes flashed.    \"What do I intend to do?\" he said, angrily: \"what should I do but seek  the villain who has ruined me?\"    \"So I supposed; but have you any hopes of success?\"    \"None; yet I shall succeed, because, when a man devotes his whole life  to the accomplishment of an object, he is certain to achieve it.\"    \"Well said, M. Prosper; and, to be frank, I fully expected that this  would be your purpose. I have therefore already begun to think and  act for you. I have a plan. In the first place, you will sell this  furniture, and disappear from the neighborhood.\"    \"Disappear!\" cried Prosper, indignantly, \"disappear! Why, monsieur?  Do you not see that such a step would be a confession of guilt, would  authorize the world to say that I am hiding so as to enjoy undisturbed  the stolen fortune?\"    \"Well, what then?\" said the man with the red whiskers; \"did you not say  just now the sacrifice of your life is made? The skilful swimmer thrown  into the river by malefactors is careful not to rise to the surface  immediately: on the contrary, he plunges beneath, and remains there as  long as his breath holds out. He comes up again at a great distance, and  lands out of sight; then, when he is supposed to be dead, lost forever  to the sight of man, he rises up and has his vengeance. You have an  enemy? Some petty imprudence will betray him. But, while he sees you  standing by on the watch, he will be on his guard.\"    It was with a sort of amazed submission that Prosper listened to this  man, who, though a friend of his father, was an utter stranger to  himself.    He submitted unconsciously to the ascendency of a nature so much more  energetic and forcible than his own. In his helpless condition he was  grateful for friendly assistance, and said:    \"I will follow your advice, monsieur.\"    \"I was sure you would, my dear friend. Let us reflect upon the course  you should pursue. And remember that you will need every cent of the  proceeds of the sale. Have you any ready money? no, but you must have  some. Knowing that you would need it at once, I brought an upholsterer  here; and he will give twelve thousand francs for everything excepting  the pictures.\"    The cashier could not refrain from shrugging his shoulders, which M.  Verduret observed.    \"Well,\" said he, \"it is rather hard, I admit, but it is a necessity. Now  listen: you are the invalid, and I am the doctor charged to cure you;  if I cut to the quick, you will have to endure it. It is the only way to  save you.\"    \"Cut away then, monsieur,\" answered Prosper.    \"Well, we will hurry, for time passes. You have a friend, M. de Lagors?\"    \"Raoul? Yes, monsieur, he is an intimate friend.\"    \"Now tell me, who is this fellow?\"    The term \"fellow\" seemed to offend Prosper.    \"M. de Lagors, monsieur,\" he said, haughtily, \"is M. Fauvel's nephew; he  is a wealthy young man, handsome, intelligent, cultivated, and the best  friend I have.\"    \"Hum!\" said M. Verduret, \"I shall be delighted to make the acquaintance  of one adorned by so many charming qualities. I must let you know that I  wrote him a note in your name asking him to come here, and he sent word  that he would be here directly.\"    \"What! do you suppose--\"    \"Oh, I suppose nothing! Only I must see this young man. Also, I have  arranged and will submit to you a little plan of conversation--\"    A ring at the front door interrupted M. Verduret.    \"Sacrebleu! adieu to my plan; here he is! Where can I hide so as to hear  and see?\"    \"There, in my bedroom; leave the door open and the curtain down.\"    A second ring was heard.    \"Now remember, Prosper,\" said M. Verduret in a warning tone, \"not  one word to this man about your plans, or about me. Pretend to be  discouraged, helpless, and undecided what to do.\"    And he disappeared behind the curtain, as Prosper ran to open the door.    Prosper's portrait of M. de Lagors had not been an exaggerated one.  So handsome a face and manly a figure could belong only to a noble  character.    Although Raoul said that he was twenty-four, he appeared to be not more  than twenty. He had a superb figure, well knit and supple; a beautiful  white brow, shaded by soft chestnut curly hair, soft blue eyes which  beamed with frankness.    His first impulse was to throw himself into Prosper's arms.    \"My poor, dear friend!\" he said, \"my poor Prosper!\"    But beneath these affectionate demonstrations there was a certain  constraint, which, if it escaped the cashier, was noticed by M.  Verduret.    \"Your letter, my dear Prosper,\" said Raoul, \"made me almost ill, I was  so frightened by it. I asked myself if you could have lost your mind.  Then I left everything, to fly to your assistance; and here I am.\"    Prosper did not seem to hear him; he was pre-occupied about the letter  which he had not written. What were its contents? Who was this stranger  whose assistance he had accepted?    \"You must not feel discouraged,\" continued M. de Lagors: \"you are young  enough to commence life anew. Your friends are still left to you. I have  come to say to you, Rely upon me; I am rich, half of my fortune is at  your disposal.\"    This generous offer, made at a moment like this with such frank  simplicity, deeply touched Prosper.    \"Thanks, Raoul,\" he said with emotion, \"thank you!
