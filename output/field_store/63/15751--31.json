They followed a descent much  steeper than that on the eastern side, and at the distance of three  quarters of a mile reached a handsome, bold creek of cold, clear water  running to the westward. They stopped to taste for the first time the  waters of the Columbia, and, after a few minutes, followed the road  across steep hills and low hollows, till they reached a spring on the  side of a mountain. Here they found a sufficient quantity of dry willow  brush for fuel, and therefore halted for the night, and, having killed  nothing in the course of the day, supped on their last piece of pork,  and trusted to fortune for some other food to mix with a little flour  and parched meal, which was all that now remained of their provisions.\"    In the early morn of August 13, Lewis hastened impatiently forward  without food, and after a few hours of travel saw three Indians; but  they fled. A little later he surprised three women, and succeeded in  reaching two, who covered their heads and awaited in silence their  expected death. Showing them that he was a white man, and giving them  trinkets, they were reassured and recalled their comrade, when he  painted their cheeks with vermilion, a Shoshone custom emblematic of  peace.    The women pointed out the direction of camp, and Lewis, marching on,  soon saw a band of sixty well-mounted Indian warriors riding full speed  toward him and his two companions. With perfect composure and undaunted  courage Lewis laid down his rifle, and alone marched forward to parley  with this horde of unknown savages, relying on the integrity and  uprightness of his mission. Received with the greatest cordiality, Lewis  at once smoked a pipe of peace with them, and after giving them some  blue beads and vermilion went to their camp.    On arrival he was inducted into a council lodge and seated on a robe,  when a fire was kindled. \"The chief then produced his pipe and tobacco,  the warriors pulled off their moccasins, and our party were requested to  take off their own. This being done, the chief lighted his pipe at the  fire within the magic circle, and then retreating from it, began a  speech several minutes long, at the end of which he pointed the stem  toward the four cardinal points of the heavens, beginning with the east  and concluding with the north.\"    By this time the day was well spent, and no food of any kind had passed  the lips of Lewis and his men since the previous day. On learning this  the chief told him that they only had cakes made of sun-dried service-  and choke-berries, which served as a hearty meal to the hungry men.  Later an Indian gave Lewis a piece of antelope and a bit of salmon,  which satisfied him that he was now on the waters of the Columbia.    The next day they had an experience of the Indian mode of hunting, which  is thus described: \"The chief game of the Shoshonees is the antelope,  which, when pursued, retreats to the open plains, where the horses have  full room for the chase. But such is its extraordinary fleetness and  wind, that a single horse has no chance of outrunning it or tiring it  down, and the hunters are therefore obliged to resort to stratagem.  About twenty Indians, mounted on fine horses and armed with bows and  arrows, left camp. In a short time they descried a herd of antelopes;  they immediately separated into little squads of two or three, and  formed a scattered circle round the herd for five or six miles, keeping  at a wary distance, so as not to alarm them till they were perfectly  enclosed, and usually selecting some commanding eminence as a stand.  Having gained their positions, a small party rode toward the herd, and  with wonderful dexterity the huntsman preserved his seat, and the horse  his footing, as he ran at full speed over the hills and down the steep  ravines and along the borders of the precipices. They were soon  outstripped by the antelopes, which, on gaining the other extremity of  the circle, were driven back and pursued by the fresh hunters. They  turned and flew, rather than ran, in another direction; but there, too,  they found new enemies. In this way they were alternately pursued  backward and forward, till at length, notwithstanding the skill of the  hunters, they all escaped; and the party, after running for two hours,  returned without having caught anything, and their horses foaming with  sweat. This chase, the greater part of which was seen from the camp,  formed a beautiful scene; but to the hunters is exceedingly laborious,  and so unproductive, even when they are able to worry the animal down  and shoot him, that forty or fifty hunters will sometimes be engaged for  half a day without obtaining more than two or three antelopes.\"    Captain Lewis succeeded with great difficulty in persuading the band of  Shoshones to pass over the divide in order to assist in bringing his  impedimenta across. The presence of a Shoshone woman, the monstrosity of  a man entirely black, favorable barter for their horses were urged; in  short he played on their avarice, curiosity, tribal pride, and by  questioning their courage succeeded in stimulating them to make the  journey.    It transpired that Cameahwait, the Shoshone chief, was the brother of  Sacajawea, and one of the Shoshone women, now in camp, had been for some  time prisoner with her in the hands of the Minnetarees. The meeting of  these Indians after long separation disclosed such emotion as proved  their tender feelings and genuine interest in each other.    [Illustration: Castle Rock, on the Columbia River.]    A long and tedious council was held, with the usual smoke and speeches.  Lewis set forth in lively terms the strength of the government, the  advantages of trade, and the importance of hastening the day of  fire-arms and supplies by facilitating the journey. Meanwhile they were  amused, as the Indian must be, by the queer negro, the sagacious and  well-trained dog, the rifles, the air-gun, clothing, canoes, etc. All  game brought in was divided; the Indians feasted on hulled corn, and  presents were liberally distributed.    The good-will of the Shoshones was finally secured, and four horses  purchased by barter; so that Lewis was to send Clark ahead to  reconnoitre the route along the Columbia, and build canoes if possible,  which the Indians declared to be impracticable, as timber was wanting,  and the river and mountains impassable. They said that for seven days  the route lay over steep, rocky mountains, with no game and only roots  for food; then for ten days an arid sandy desert, where men and horses  would perish for want of food and water. On inquiry, Clark learned that  Nez Perces came from the west by a very bad road towards the north,  where they suffered excessively from hunger and travel. Believing that  difficulties surmountable to Indians with women and children could not  be formidable, Clark pushed on with a guide, but soon found that the  Indian accounts had not been exaggerated, as he fell in with the points  of four mountains, which were rocky, and so high that it seemed almost  impossible to cross them with horses. The road lay over sharp fragments  of broken rock which had fallen from the mountains and were strewed in  heaps for miles together.    Occasionally he met small parties of Indians, who, in wretched plight  themselves, yet acted most generously, giving him, as he says, willingly  what little they possessed, which was usually a few dried berries and a  bit of salmon, never enough to entirely appease the hunger of his  famished men. Clark says:    \"Our men, who are used to hardships, but have been accustomed to have  the first wants of nature regularly supplied, feel very sensibly their  wretched situation; their strength is wasting away; they begin to  express an apprehension of being without food in a country perfectly  destitute of any means of supporting life, except a few fish.\"    Clark's explorations showed that it was impossible to follow the river,  to which he gave the name of Lewis, as he was the first white man to  visit its waters, either by canoe or along its banks on horses. The  mountains were one barren surface of broken masses of rock which crowded  into the river, where the stream presented either continuous rapids or  series of shoals.    Meanwhile, Lewis moved his necessary baggage to the Shoshone village,  previously caching his surplus baggage and sinking his canoes for  safety. As a rule the Indians were most friendly, but during a hunting  expedition a young brave snatched up his rifle and made off with it.  Drewyer pursued him ten miles, and overtaking the women of the party,  watched his opportunity, and seeing the Indian off his guard, galloped  up to him and seized his rifle. The Indian struggled for some time, but  finding Drewyer getting too strong for him, had the presence of mind to  open the pan and let the priming fall out; he then let go his hold, and  giving his horse the whip, escaped at full speed, leaving the women at  the mercy of the conqueror.    Considerable time was spent in making needful preparations for crossing  the mountains and in negotiating for horses, of which they obtained  twenty-nine--young, vigorous animals, though in poor flesh and with sore  backs.    This necessary delay gave Lewis ample opportunity to observe the habits  and modes of life of the Shoshones, which are especially interesting as  the record of an Indian tribe before it had come in contact with the  white men. The Shoshones, or Snakes, who here number four hundred souls,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36124"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 4, No. 1, August, 1851 (#20)"],[1,"iting.    By this time he would very willingly have treated the company to a  song, so complete had been the change which punch and new prospects  had effected; but Mr. Shanks besought him to be quiet, hinting that  the neighbor, though as deaf as a post and blind as a mole, would  think him as the celebrated sow of the psalmist. Thereupon John  Ayliffe went forth and got his horse out of the stable, mounted upon  his back, and rode lolling at a sauntering pace through the end of  the town in which Mr. Shanks's house was situated. When he got more  into the country he began to trot, then let the horse fall into a walk  again, and then he beat him for going slow. Thus alternately  galloping, walking, and trotting, he rode on till he was two or three  hundred yards past the gates of what was called the Court, where the  family of Sir Philip Hastings now lived. It was rather a dark part of  the road, and there was something white in the hedge--some linen put  out to dry, or a milestone. John Ayliffe was going at a quick pace at  that moment, and the horse suddenly shied at this white  apparition--not only shied, but started, wheeled round, and ran back.  John Ayliffe kept his seat, notwithstanding his tipsiness, but he  struck the furious horse over the head, and pulled the rein violently.  The animal plunged--reared--the young man gave the rein a furious tug,  and over went the horse upon the road, with his driver under him.      CHAPTER XXXVI.    There was a man lay upon the road in the darkness of the night for  some five or six minutes, and a horse galloped away snorting, with a  broken bridle hanging at his head, on the way towards the park of Sir  Philip Hastings. Had any carriage come along, the man who was lying  there must have been run over; for the night was exceedingly dark, and  the road narrow. All was still and silent, however. No one was seen  moving--not a sound was heard except the distant clack of a water-mill  which lay further down the valley. There was a candle in a cottage  window at about a hundred yards' distance, which shot a dim and feeble  ray athwart the road, but shed no light on the spot where the man lay.  At the end of about six minutes, a sort of convulsive movement showed  that life was not yet extinct in his frame--a sort of heave of the  chest, and a sudden twitch of the arm; and a minute or two after, John  Ayliffe raised himself on his elbow, and put his hand to his head.    \"Curse the brute,\" he said, in a wandering sort of way, \"I wonder,  Shanks, you don't--damn it, where am I?--what's the matter? My side  and leg are cursed sore, and my head all running round.\"    He remained in the same position for a moment or two more, and then  got upon his feet; but the instant he did so he fell to the ground  again with a deep groan, exclaiming, \"By ----, my leg's broken, and I  believe my ribs too. How the devil shall I get out of this scrape?  Here I may lie and die, without any body ever coming near me. That is  old Jenny Best's cottage, I believe. I wonder if I could make the old  canting wretch hear,\" and he raised his voice to shout, but the pain  was too great. His ribs were indeed broken, and pressing upon his  lungs, and all that he could do was to lie still and groan.    About a quarter of an hour after, however, a stout, middle-aged  man--rather, perhaps, in the decline of life--came by, carrying a  hand-basket, plodding at a slow and weary pace as if he had had a long  walk.    \"Who's that? Is any one there?\" said a feeble voice, as he approached;  and he ran up, exclaiming, \"Gracious me, what is the matter? Are you  hurt, sir? What has happened?\"    \"Is that you, Best?\" said the feeble voice of John Ayliffe, \"my horse  has reared and fallen over with me. My leg is broken, and the bone  poking through, and my ribs are broken too, I think.\"    \"Stay a minute, Sir John,\" said the good countryman, \"and I'll get  help, and we'll carry you up to the Hall.\"    \"No, no,\" answered John Ayliffe, who had now had time for thought,  \"get a mattress, or a door, or something, and carry me into your  cottage. If your son is at home, he and you can carry me. Don't send  for strangers.\"    \"I dare say he is at home, sir,\" replied the man. \"He's a good lad,  sir, and comes home as soon as his work's done. I will go and see. I  won't be a minute.\"    He was as good as his word, and in less than a minute returned with  his son, bringing a lantern and a straw mattress.    Not without inflicting great pain, and drawing forth many a heavy  groan, the old man and the young one placed John Ayliffe on the  paliasse, and carried him into the cottage, where he was laid upon  young Best's bed in the back room. Good Jenny Best, as John Ayliffe  had called her--an excellent creature as ever lived--was all kindness  and attention, although to say truth the suffering man had not shown  any great kindness to her and hers in his days of prosperity. She was  eager to send off her son immediately for the surgeon, and did so in  the end; but to the surprise of the whole of the little cottage party,  it was not without a great deal of reluctance and hesitation that John  Ayliffe suffered this to be done. They showed him, however, that he  must die or lose his limb if surgical assistance was not immediately  procured, and he ultimately consented, but told the young man  repeatedly not to mention his name even to the surgeon on any account,  but simply to say that a gentleman had been thrown by his horse, and  brought into the cottage with his thigh broken. He cautioned father  and mother too not to mention the accident to any one till he was well  again, alluding vaguely to reasons that he had for wishing to conceal  it.    \"But, Sir John,\" replied Best himself, \"your horse will go home,  depend upon it, and your servants will not know where you are, and  there will be a fuss about you all over the country.\"    \"Well, then, let them make a fuss,\" said John Ayliffe, impatiently. \"I  don't care--I will not have it mentioned.\"    All this seemed very strange to the good man and his wife, but they  could only open their eyes and stare, without venturing farther to  oppose the wishes of their guest.    It seemed a very long time before the surgeon made his appearance, but  at length the sound of a horse's feet coming fast, could be  distinguished, and two minutes after the surgeon was in the room. He  was a very good man, though not the most skilful of his profession,  and he was really shocked and confounded when he saw the state of Sir  John Hastings, as he called him. Wanting confidence in himself, he  would fain have sent off immediately for farther assistance, but John  Ayliffe would not hear of such a thing, and the good man went to work  to set the broken limb as best he might, and relieve the anguish of  the sufferer. So severe, however, were the injuries which had been  received, that notwithstanding a strong constitution, as yet but  little impaired by debauchery, the patient was given over by the  surgeon in his own mind from the first. He remained with him, watching  him all night, which passed nearly without sleep on the part of John  Ayliffe; and in the course of the long waking hours he took an  opportunity of enjoining secrecy upon the surgeon as to the accident  which had happened to him, and the place where he was lying. Not less  surprised was the worthy man than the cottager and his wife had been  at the young gentleman's exceeding anxiety for concealment, and as his  licentious habits were no secret in the country round, they all  naturally concluded that the misfortune which had overtaken him had  occurred in the course of some adventure more dangerous and  disgraceful than usual.    Towards morning John Ayliffe fell into a sort of semi-sleep, restless  and perturbed, speaking often without reason having guidance of his  words, and uttering many things which, though disjointed and often  indistinct, showed the good man who had watched by him that the mind  was as much affected as the body. He woke confused and wandering about  eight o'clock, but speedily returned to consciousness of his  situation, and insisted, notwithstanding the pain he was suffering,  upon examining the money which was in his pockets to see that it was  all right. Vain precaution! He was never destined to need it more.    Shortly after the surgeon left him, but returned at night again to  watch by his bedside. The bodily symptoms which he now perceived would  have led him to believe that a cure was possible, but there was a deep  depression of mind, a heavy irritable sombreness, from the result of  which the surgeon augured much evil. He saw that there was some  terrible weight upon the young man's heart, but whether it was fear or  remorse or disappointment he could not tell, and more than once he  repeated to himself, \"He wants a priest as much as a physician.\"    Again the surgeon would often argue with himself in regard to the  propriety of telling him the very dangerous state in which he was. \"He  may at any time become delirious,\" he said, \"and lose all power of  making those dispositions and arrangements which, I dare say, have  never been thought of in the time of health and prosperity. Then,  again, his house and all that it contains is left entirely in the  hands of servants--a bad set too, as ever existed, who are just as  likely to plunder and destroy as not; but on the other hand, if I tell  him it may only increase his dejection and cut off all hope of  recovery. Really I do not know what to do. Perhaps it would be better  to wait awhile, and if I should see more unfavorable symptoms and no  chance left, it will then be time enough to tell him his true  situation and prepare his mind for the result.\"    Another restless, feverish night passed, another troubled sleep  towards morning, and then John Ayliffe woke with a start, exclaiming,  \"You did not tell them I was here--lying here unable to stir,"]]]
