History (Mosheim), book i, cent, ii,  part ii, ch. iii.    11. Acts ii: 41. Acts viii: 12, 35--40.    12. Mosheim, vol. i, book i, part ii, ch. iv.    13. That exorcism was not annexed to baptism till some time in the  third century, and after the admission of the Platonic philosophy  into the church, may almost be demonstrated. The ceremonies used at  baptism in the second century are described by Justin Martyr in his  second apology, and by Tertullian in his book _de Corono Militis._ But  neither makes mention of exorcism. This is a cogent argument to prove  that it was admitted by Christians after the times of these fathers,  and of course in the third century. Egypt perhaps first received  it,--Murdock's Mosheim, vol. i, p. 190. (Note.)    14. Mosheim, vol. i, book i, part ii, ch. iv.    15. According to Schlegel, the so-called apostolic constitution (b.  viii. ch. xxxii) enjoined a three years' course of preparation; yet  with allowance of some exceptions.    16. That is, in the evening preceding the day on which Messiah is  supposed to have arisen from the dead, and the evening preceding the  seventh Sunday after Easter, the anniversary of Pentecost, when the  Holy Ghost was poured out upon the Apostles in a remarkable manner.  (Acts ii.)    17. Mosheim, vol. i, book ii, part ii, ch. iv.    18. Cyprian's Epistles, letter 76.    19. Eusebius Eccl. Hist., b. vi, ch. 43.    20. In writing to the saints of Rome, Paul says: \"Know ye not, that so  many of us as were baptized into Christ were baptized into his death?  Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death; that like as  Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so  we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted  together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness  of his resurrection\" (Rom. vi: 3--5.) In writing to the saints of  Colosse, the same apostle reminds them that they had been \"Buried with  him [Christ] in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through  the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the dead\"  (Col. ii: 12). In these passages the terms \"buried\" and \"planted\"  are in plain allusion to the manner in which the saints had received  the ordinance of baptism, which could not have been by sprinkling or  pouring, as there is no burial or planting in the likeness of Christ's  death, or being raised in the likeness of his resurrection in that; but  in immersion there is.--\"The Gospel\" (Roberts), page 185.    21. Milner's Church Hist., vol. i, pp. 429, 430.    22. Such is the opinion of Milner--Church Hist., vol. i, p. 430.    23. \"The Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread;  and when he had given thanks, he brake it and said, Take, eat: this is  my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After  the same manner he took the cup, when he had supped, saying: This cup  is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it,  in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this  cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he come.\" (I Cor. xi: 23--26.)    24. Mosheim's Eccl. Hist., bk. i, cent. iii, part ii, ch. iv.    25. Protestants combating the Catholic idea of the real presence of the  flesh and blood in the Eucharist--transubstantiation--have endeavored  to prove that this doctrine was not of earlier origin than the eighth  century. In this, however, the evidence is against them. Ignatius,  bishop of Antioch, writing early in the second century, says of certain  supposed heretics: \"They do not admit of Eucharist and oblations,  because they do not believe the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Savior  Jesus Christ, who suffered for our sins.\" (Epistle of Ignatius to  the Smyrneans.) So Justin Martyr, also writing in the first half of  the second century: \"We do not receive them (the bread and wine) as  ordinary food or ordinary drink; but as by the word of God Jesus Christ  our Savior was made flesh, and took upon him both flesh and blood for  our salvation, so also the food which was blessed by the prayer of the  word which proceeded from him, and from which our flesh and blood,  by transmutation, receive nourishment, is, we are taught, both the  flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh.\" (Justin's Apology to  Emperor Antoninus.) After Justin's time the testimony of the fathers is  abundant. There can be no doubt as to the antiquity of the idea of the  real presence of the body and blood of Jesus in the Eucharist; but that  proves--as we said of infant baptism--not that the doctrine is true,  but that soon after the apostles had passed away, the simplicity of the  gospel was corrupted or else entirely departed from.    26. As evidence of the superstition which was connected with the  Eucharist, note the following. \"If any one through negligence, shall  destroy the Eucharist, _i. e.,_ the sacrifice; let him do penance one  year. * * * * If he lets it fall on the ground, carelessly, he must  sing fifty Psalms. Whoever neglects to take care of the sacrifice, so  that worms get into it, or it lose its color, or taste, must do penance  thirty or twenty days; and the sacrifice must be burned in the fire.  Whoever turns up the cup at the close of the solemnity of the mass must  do penance forty days. If a drop from the cup should fall on the altar,  the minister must suck up the drop and do penance three days; and the  linen cloth which the drop touched must be washed three times, over  the cup, and the water in which it is washed be cast into the fire.\"  Decisions of Pope Gregory III.--Harduin's Concilia.    27. Luke xxii. Matt. xxvi.    28. The wickedness of the Christian world in the dark ages and during  the progress of the \"Reformation\" was such that the author of the  \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" in closing his famous sixteenth  chapter which deals with the persecution of the Christians during  the first three centuries of our era, can say, and his arraignment  cannot be successfully contradicted: \"We conclude this chapter by a  melancholy truth which obtrudes itself on the reluctant mind; that  even admitting without hesitation or inquiry, all that history has  recorded, or devotion has feigned, on the subject of martyrdom, it  must still be acknowledged, that the Christians, in course of their  intestine dissensions, have inflicted far greater severities on each  other, than they had experienced from the zeal of infidels. During the  ages of ignorance which followed the subversion of the Roman Empire  in the west, the bishops of the imperial city extended their dominion  over the laity as well as the clergy of the Latin church. The fabric of  superstition which they had erected, and which might long have defied  the feeble efforts of reason, was at length assaulted by a crowd of  daring fanatics, who from the twelfth to the sixteenth century assumed  the popular character of reformers. The church of Rome defended by  violence the empire which she had acquired by fraud; a system of peace  and benevolence was soon disgraced by proscriptions, war, massacres  and the institution of the holy office (the Inquisition). And as the  reformers were animated by the love of civil as well as of religious  freedom, the Catholic princes connected their own interest with that of  the clergy, and enforced by fire and the sword the terrors of spiritual  censurers. In the Netherlands alone more than one hundred thousand of  the subjects of Charles V. are said to have suffered by the hand of the  executioner; and this extraordinary number is attested by Grotius (See  Grotius Annal. de Rebus Belgiers). * * * If we are obliged to submit  our belief to the authority of Grotius, it must be allowed, that the  number of Protestants who were executed in a single province and a  single reign, far exceed that of the primitive martyrs in the space of  three centuries, and of the Roman Empire.\" \"Decline and Fall,\" vol. i,  ch. xvi.        CHAPTER VI.    THE TESTIMONY OF PROPHECY TO THE APOSTASY.    \"What is prophecy but history reversed?\" Nothing. Prophecy is a record  of things before they transpire. History is a record of them after  they have occurred; and of the two prophecy is more to be trusted for  its accuracy than history: for the reason that it has for its source  the unerring inspiration of Almighty God; while history--except in the  case of inspired historians--is colored by the favor or prejudice of  the writer, depends for its exactness upon the point of view from which  he looks upon the events; and is likely to be marred in a thousand  ways by the influences surrounding him--party considerations, national  interest or prejudice; supposed influence upon present conditions and  future prospects--all these things may interfere with history; but  prophecy is free from such influences. Historians are self-constituted,  or appointed by men; but prophets are chosen of God. Selected by divine  wisdom, and illuminated by that spirit which shows things that are to  come, [1] prophets have revealed to them so much of the future as God  would have men to know, and the inspired writers record it for the  enlightenment or warning of mankind, without the coloring or distortion  so liable to mar the work of the historian. Thus Moses recorded what  the history of Israel would be on condition of their obedience to God;  and what it would be if they were disobedient. Israel was disobedient,  and historians have exhausted their art in attempts to tell of their  disobedience and suffering; but neither in vividness nor accuracy do  the the histories compare with the prophecy.

[3] So with well nigh all of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46237"],[0,"The Romance of Book-Collecting (#20)"],[1," is, at any rate, much less reason, one would think, in  paying L246 for a lace flounce wherewith to minister to the vanity of  some middle-aged dame than there is for incurring a fractional  obligation for classic works, which will outlast us by many a day, even  though they may have the fortune to be uncut and in parts as issued.  And besides, O shade of Mr. Burgess! did you not ignore in your lifetime  the rule that it were best to let well alone, and were not the  consequences terrible in the extreme?[#]      [#] The library of the late Mr. Frederick Burgess was sold by Messrs.  Sotheby on May 31 and three subsequent days, 1894.  It consisted almost  entirely of then 'Fashionable' books, illustrated by Cruikshank and  other talented artists.  Parts had been bound up, original cloth covers  removed, and expensive bindings substituted, not merely in a few  instances, but as a general rule.  The collection, though an excellent  one of its kind, was disposed of at an enormous sacrifice.      Whether any regulations are really necessary for the proper preservation  of books old or new let the bibliophiles determine; but so long as they  exist it is folly to ignore them.  Nay, further, to be as far upon the  safe side as possible, we must prefer to buy our books with due regard  to those rules and orders which our progenitors have in their wisdom  drawn up, selecting the very best copies we can afford to pay or obtain  credit for, and even going to the length of investing in 'parts' which  shall not shame us, or cause us loss when the inevitable hour of parting  arrives.    The cardinal rule of the game is triple-headed, and it is this: Buy the  best you can, spend what you find convenient without stint, and, above  all, keep to the track you have mapped out for yourself and have so far  followed.  Then will it be well with you now and hereafter in all things  bookish.  Act the contrary throughout, and every stiver you spend will  swell the total of your confusion; drop by drop the clepsydra of your  fortunes will run out to your bane.    But the rules which hem in the book-buyer, and direct his course, are  not solely confined to technical points and details such as those  mentioned.  On the contrary, they are equally stringent in many other  respects, and in particular as to the description of book to buy, its  condition, and so on; for it is taken for granted that no man, or at  least no bookman worthy the name, would purchase a bad or inferior  edition when he could get a better, or a volume that was imperfect or  had been shamefully used by a succession of careless owners.  Between  the quality of one edition and another there is often an immense  difference, as all the world knows, or ought to know.  That edition of  '\"Paradise Lost,\" a Poem in twelve books, the author John Milton,  Printed for the Proprietors and sold by all the Booksellers,' no date,  but about 1780, is one of the very worst that any misguided man ever  picked up from a street stall.  The mistakes, not merely in punctuation,  but in spelling, are too gross and scandalous for mention; entire lines  are not infrequently missing, and whole sentences often perverted.  Contrast this with any copy of the first edition, no matter which  title-page may have heralded it into the world, and we have a different  book entirely.  The rule says that, though an ordinary copy of the first  edition may be three thousand times as valuable in money as this gutter  abortion, you must nevertheless not be attracted by the latter because  it is cheap--no, not even though you should think it good enough for  everyday use.    Naturally enough there are free-lances among book-men, people who are a  law unto themselves, and insist upon doing precisely as they like, but  it will be noticed that they very rarely fly in the face of any rule in  important cases.  Your free-lance has the courage of the Seven Champions  of Christendom when face to face with Stackhouse's 'History of the  Bible,' but let him, for example, come across 'Tamerlaine, and other  Poems, By a Bostonian;' not Herne Shepherd's London reprint, but the  original tract which Calvin F. S. Thomas printed at Boston in 1827.  Let  us suppose also that it is in its original tea-tinted paper covers, just  as Edgar Allen Poe sent it forth into the world.  What would our  free-lance do?  Have it rebound in defiance of the rule? Hardly, for if  he did he would reduce the importance of his exceptionally fortunate  find, and therefore its value, to such a considerable extent that even  he would hesitate long before committing himself to an act that could  never be recalled.  Moreover, he would have direct evidence with regard  to a copy of this very Pamphlet before his eyes, for a collector once  really did pick one up for a few pence.  In the first place, let it be  stated that only three copies of 'Tamerlaine' can now be traced.  One is  in the British Museum, which acquired it from the late Mr. Henry Stevens  for one shilling.  A second was found on a stall in America for the  equivalent of something less, and it is this latter copy which furnishes  the evidence referred to.  The fortunate finder sent it to Messrs. C. F.  Libbie and Co., the auctioneers of Boston, who sold it by auction in  1893 for the equivalent of L370 to the agents of Mr. George F. Maxwell,  of New York, who had the pamphlet rebound in magnificent style by Lortic  Fils, at a cost of several hundred dollars. Moreover, the covers were  bound in, and the edges left untrimmed.  No expense was spared;  everything was done in proper order according to rule of thumb.  Yet in  April, 1895, when Mr. Maxwell's valuable library was sold by the same  auctioneers, this copy of 'Tamerlaine,' vastly improved as one might  think, dropped to L290, showing a clear loss of L80, irrespective  altogether of the amount paid for binding, auctioneers' commission, and  so on.    It may, of course, be said that it is a common thing for the same book  to bring different amounts at different times, even when the sales take  place within a few months of each other.  A bookseller, dissatisfied  with the amount bid for some scarce work he has put on the market, will  frequently buy it in and offer it again later on with satisfactory  results.    But 'Tamerlaine' is an altogether exceptional piece, and, moreover,  where were the gentlemen who respectively bid L360 and L365 on the  occasion when Mr. Maxwell secured it for a slightly larger sum?  Wherever they were, they seem to have been fully alive to the fact that  'Tamerlaine' was not as it was when Poe sent it out for review ever so  many years ago.  'Ah, broken is the golden bowl,' and it is to be feared  by that talented binder, Lortic Fils.  If ever I find 'Tamerlaine,' I  shall keep every binder at arm's length, and not be tempted to paint the  lily--no, not even though Derome himself should rise from the dead and  offer to array it gratuitously in morocco, tooled to a heavenly pattern,  and powdered all over with the fleurs-de-lys of imperial France.  In  this spirit let us reproduce the title-page of 'Tamerlaine,' as a  Frontispiece to this Romance, so that we shall know it on the instant if  the gods should only guide our feet to where a fourth copy lies hidden  away.  Then let us remember the rule to let well alone, and be thankful,  for it is a rule of gold, the first and foremost of them all.    Never to outrage sentiment, always to identify one's self with the  author as far as possible, is to respect both the living and the dead,  and to make life comparatively easy, even though its path be strewn with  flints and cobble-stones.  May the person who has the maximum of respect  for the private life and character of one of the greatest of modern  poets eventually acquire the shabby copy of 'The Eve of St. Agnes' which  the luckless half-immortal thrust into his pocket as the _Don Juan_ was  sent to the bottom of the Gulf of Genoa.  It will come with a train of  associations that will on the instant forbid the elimination of a single  stain, or the slightest repair of its sea-swept cover.    The book-hunter who has the feelings and aspirations of an ancient race  properly diffused through his system would almost give his head for a  relic such as this, for his passion is not to be stifled.  He likes to  think that the books he reads and handles have a pedigree, that they  come to him laden with the fears and aspirations of the past, that they  are ghost-haunted, and that they who wrote them, though dead, yet speak,  not as man to man, but as soul to soul.                                       *CHAPTER IX.*                           *THE GLAMOUR OF BINDINGS.*      There being in very truth no new thing under the sun, it would be  egotistical in the highest degree, and absurd, to assert positively that  the argument about to be advanced is at all novel, though it may  certainly appear strange.  It is, however, original so far as I am  concerned, for I have not seen it hinted at before by anyone, much less  carried to a conclusion. Whether there be any warrant for it or no is a  point for others, who have a greater capacity for distinguishing reason  in probabilities than I can lay claim to, to determine for themselves.    It is admitted by all writers who have studied the subject of  bookbinding from its historical aspect, that, as the monks of the Middle  Ages were the sole producers of books, so also they were the only  binders, and that the record of their achievements dates from about 520  A.D., when Dagaeus, the Irish monk, practised his art, to the invention  of printing from movable types by Gutenberg and Fust nearly a thousand  years later. Not merely in England, but all over Europe, the monks were  practically the sole custodians of knowledge during the earlier part of  this period; they alone produced books, they alone bound them, they  alone could read them.  There were, no doubt, laymen who could "]]]
