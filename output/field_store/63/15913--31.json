Pentaur listened to the youth with folded arms, now looking at him  enquiringly, now adding approbation. Then taking up the thread of the  discourse when it was ended, he began himself to speak.    Like obedient falcons at the call of the falconer, thoughts rushed down  into his mind, and the divine passion awakened in his breast glowed and  shone through his inspired language that soared every moment on freer  and stronger wings. Melting into pathos, exulting in rapture, he praised  the splendor of nature; and the words flowed from his lips like a limpid  crystal-clear stream as he glorified the eternal order of things, and  the incomprehensible wisdom and care of the Creator--the One, who is one  alone, and great and without equal.    \"So incomparable,\" he said in conclusion, \"is the home which God has  given us. All that He--the One--has created is penetrated with His own  essence, and bears witness to His Goodness. He who knows how to find Him  sees Him everywhere, and lives at every instant in the enjoyment of His  glory. Seek Him, and when ye have found Him fall down and sing praises  before Him. But praise the Highest, not only in gratitude for the  splendor of that which he has created, but for having given us the  capacity for delight in his work. Ascend the mountain peaks and look on  the distant country, worship when the sunset glows with rubies, and the  dawn with roses, go out in the nighttime, and look at the stars as they  travel in eternal, unerring, immeasurable, and endless circles on silver  barks through the blue vault of heaven, stand by the cradle of the  child, by the buds of the flowers, and see how the mother bends over  the one, and the bright dew-drops fall on the other. But would you know  where the stream of divine goodness is most freely poured out, where the  grace of the Creator bestows the richest gifts, and where His holiest  altars are prepared? In your own heart; so long as it is pure and full  of love. In such a heart, nature is reflected as in a magic mirror, on  whose surface the Beautiful shines in three-fold beauty. There the eye  can reach far away over stream, and meadow, and hill, and take in the  whole circle of the earth; there the morning and evening-red shine,  not like roses and rubies, but like the very cheeks of the Goddess of  Beauty; there the stars circle on, not in silence, but with the mighty  voices of the pure eternal harmonies of heaven; there the child smiles  like an infant-god, and the bud unfolds to magic flowers; finally,  there thankfulness grows broader and devotion grows deeper, and we throw  ourselves into the arms of a God, who--as I imagine his glory--is a  God to whom the sublime nine great Gods pray as miserable and helpless  suppliants.\"    The tomtom which announced the end of the hour interrupted him.    Pentaur ceased speaking with a deep sigh, and for a minute not a scholar  moved.    At last the poet laid the papyrus roll out of his hand, wiped the sweat  from his hot brow, and walked slowly towards the gate of the court,  which led into the sacred grove of the temple. He had hardly crossed the  threshold when he felt a hand laid upon his shoulder.    He looked round. Behind him stood Ameni. \"You fascinated your hearers,  my friend,\" said the high-priest, coldly; \"it is a pity that only the  Harp was wanting.\"    Ameni's words fell on the agitated spirit of the poet like ice on the  breast of a man in fever. He knew this tone in his master's voice, for  thus he was accustomed to reprove bad scholars and erring priests; but  to him he had never yet so spoken.    \"It certainly would seem,\" continued the high-priest, bitterly, \"as if  in your intoxication you had forgotten what it becomes the teacher to  utter in the lecture-hall. Only a few weeks since you swore on my hands  to guard the mysteries, and this day you have offered the great secret  of the Unnameable one, the most sacred possession of the initiated, like  some cheap ware in the open market.\"    \"Thou cuttest with knives,\" said Pentaur.    \"May they prove sharp, and extirpate the undeveloped canker, the rank  weed from your soul,\" cried the high-priest. \"You are young, too young;  not like the tender fruit-tree that lets itself be trained aright, and  brought to perfection, but like the green fruit on the ground, which  will turn to poison for the children who pick it up--yea even though it  fall from a sacred tree. Gagabu and I received you among us, against  the opinion of the majority of the initiated. We gainsaid all those  who doubted your ripeness because of your youth; and you swore to me,  gratefully and enthusiastically, to guard the mysteries and the law.  To-day for the first time I set you on the battle-field of life beyond  the peaceful shelter of the schools. And how have you defended the  standard that it was incumbent on you to uphold and maintain?\"    \"I did that which seemed to me to be right and true,\" answered Pentaur  deeply moved.    \"Right is the same for you as for us--what the law prescribes; and what  is truth?\"    \"None has lifted her veil,\" said Pentaur, \"but my soul is the offspring  of the soul-filled body of the All; a portion of the infallible spirit  of the Divinity stirs in my breast, and if it shows itself potent in  me--\"    \"How easily we may mistake the flattering voice of self-love for that of  the Divinity!\"    \"Cannot the Divinity which works and speaks in me--as in thee--as in  each of us--recognize himself and his own voice?\"    \"If the crowd were to hear you,\" Ameni interrupted him, \"each would set  himself on his little throne, would proclaim the voice of the god within  him as his guide, tear the law to shreds, and let the fragments fly to  the desert on the east wind.\"    \"I am one of the elect whom thou thyself hast taught to seek and to  find the One. The light which I gaze on and am blest, would strike the  crowd--I do not deny it--with blindness--\"    \"And nevertheless you blind our disciples with the dangerous glare-\"    \"I am educating them for future sages.\"    \"And that with the hot overflow of a heart intoxicated with love!\"    \"Ameni!\"    \"I stand before you, uninvited, as your teacher, who reproves you out of  the law, which always and everywhere is wiser than the individual, whose  defender the king--among his highest titles--boasts of being, and to  which the sage bows as much as the common man whom we bring up to blind  belief--I stand before you as your father, who has loved you from a  child, and expected from none of his disciples more than from you; and  who will therefore neither lose you nor abandon the hope he has set upon  you--    \"Make ready to leave our quiet house early tomorrow morning. You have  forfeited your office of teacher. You shall now go into the school of  life, and make yourself fit for the honored rank of the initiated which,  by my error, was bestowed on you too soon. You must leave your scholars  without any leave-taking, however hard it may appear to you. After the  star of Sothis       [The holy star of Isis, Sirius or the dog star, whose course in the     time of the Pharaohs coincided with the exact Solar year, and served     at a very early date as a foundation for the reckoning of time among     the Egyptians.]    has risen come for your instructions. You must in these next months try  to lead the priesthood in the temple of Hatasu, and in that post to win  back my confidence which you have thrown away. No remonstrance; to-night  you will receive my blessing, and our authority--you must greet the  rising sun from the terrace of the new scene of your labors. May the  Unnameable stamp the law upon your soul!\"    Ameni returned to his room.    He walked restlessly to and fro.    On a little table lay a mirror; he looked into the clear metal pane,  and laid it back in its place again, as if he had seen some strange and  displeasing countenance.    The events of the last few hours had moved him deeply, and shaken his  confidence in his unerring judgment of men and things.    The priests on the other bank of the Nile were Bent-Anat's counsellors,  and he had heard the princess spoken of as a devout and gifted maiden.  Her incautious breach of the sacred institutions had seemed to him  to offer a welcome opportunity for humiliating--a member of the royal  family.    Now he told himself that he had undervalued this young creature that he  had behaved clumsily, perhaps foolishly, to her; for he did not for a  moment conceal from himself that her sudden change of demeanor resulted  much more from the warm flow of her sympathy, or perhaps of her,  affection, than from any recognition of her guilt, and he could not  utilize her transgression with safety to himself, unless she felt  herself guilty.    Nor was he of so great a nature as to be wholly free from vanity, and  his vanity had been deeply wounded by the haughty resistance of the  princess.    When he commanded Pentaur to meet the princess with words of reproof, he  had hoped to awaken his ambition through the proud sense of power over  the mighty ones of the earth.    And now?    How had his gifted admirer, the most hopeful of all his disciples, stood  the test.    The one ideal of his life, the unlimited dominion of the priestly idea  over the minds of men, and of the priesthood over the king himself, had  hitherto remained unintelligible to this singular young man.    He must learn to understand it.    \"Here, as the least among a hundred who are his superiors, all the  powers of resistance of his soaring soul have been roused,\" said Ameni  to himself. \"In the temple of Hatasu he will have to rule over the  inferior orders of slaughterers of victims and incense-burners; and,  by requiring obedience, will learn to estimate the necessity of it. The  rebel, to whom a throne devolves, becomes a tyrant!\"    \"Pentuar's poet soul,\" so he continued to reflect \"has quickly yielded  itself a prisoner "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5460"],[0,"An Egyptian Princess — Complete (#20)"],[1,"art in error. Though not mine, Nitetis is a king's daughter  and will know how to win the love of her husband.\"    \"Were she the daughter of a god, she could not save thee from Cambyses'  wrath, if he discovers the treachery; lying is to a Persian the worst  of crimes, to be deceived the greatest disgrace; thou hast deceived the  highest and proudest of the nation, and what can one inexperienced girl  avail, when hundreds of women, deeply versed in intrigue and artifice,  are striving for the favor of their lord?\"    \"Hatred and revenge are good masters in the art of rhetoric,\" said  Amasis in a cutting tone. \"And think'st thou then, oh, foolish son,  that I should have undertaken such a dangerous game without due  consideration? Phanes may tell the Persians what he likes, he can never  prove his point. I, the father, Ladice the mother must know best whether  Nitetis is our child or not. We call her so, who dare aver the contrary?  If it please Phanes to betray our land to any other enemy beside the  Persians, let him; I fear nothing! Thou wouldst have me ruin a man who  has been my friend, to whom I owe much gratitude, who has served me long  and faithfully; and this without offence from his side. Rather will I  shelter him from thy revenge, knowing as I do the impure source from  which it springs.\"    \"My father!\"    \"Thou desirest the ruin of this man, because he hindered thee from  taking forcible possession of the granddaughter of Rhodopis, and because  thine own incapacity moved me to place him in thy room as commander  of the troops. Ah! thou growest pale! Verily, I owe Phanes thanks for  confiding to me your vile intentions, and so enabling me to bind my  friends and supporters, to whom Rhodopis is precious, more firmly to my  throne.\"    \"And is it thus thou speakest of these strangers, my father? dost thou  thus forget the ancient glory of Egypt? Despise me, if thou wilt; I know  thou lovest me not; but say not that to be great we need the help of  strangers! Look back on our history! Were we not greatest when our gates  were closed to the stranger, when we depended on ourselves and our own  strength, and lived according to the ancient laws of our ancestors  and our gods? Those days beheld the most distant lands subjugated by  Rameses, and heard Egypt celebrated in the whole world as its first and  greatest nation. What are we now? The king himself calls beggars and  foreigners the supporters of his throne, and devises a petty stratagem  to secure the friendship of a power over whom we were victorious before  the Nile was infested by these strangers. Egypt was then a mighty Queen  in glorious apparel; she is now a painted woman decked out in tinsel!\"       [Rameses the Great, son of Sethos, reigned over Egypt 1394-1328 B.     C. He was called Sesostris by the Greeks; see Lepsius (Chron. d.     Aegypter, p. 538.) on the manner in which this confusion of names     arose. Egypt attained the zenith of her power under this king,     whose army, according to Diodorus (I. 53-58). consisted of 600,000     foot and 24,000 horsemen, 27,000 chariots and 400 ships of war.     With these hosts he subdued many of the Asiatic and African nations,     carving his name and likeness, as trophies of victory, on the rocks     of the conquered countries. Herodotus speaks of having seen two of     these inscriptions himself (II. 102-106.) and two are still to be     found not far from Bairut.  His conquests brought vast sums of     tribute into Egypt. Tacitus annal. II. 60. and these enabled him to     erect magnificent buildings in the whole length of his land from     Nubia to Tanis, but more especially in Thebes, the city in which he     resided. One of the obelisks erected by Rameses at Heliopolis is     now standing in the Place de la Concorde at Paris, and has been     lately translated by E. Chabas. On the walls of the yet remaining     palaces and temples, built under this mighty king, we find, even to     this day, thousands of pictures representing himself, his armed     hosts, the many nations subdued by the power of his arms, and the     divinities to whose favor he believed these victories were owing.     Among the latter Ammon and Bast seem to have received his especial     veneration, and, on the other hand, we read in these inscriptions     that the gods were very willing to grant the wishes of their     favorite. A poetical description of the wars he waged with the     Cheta is to be found in long lines of hieroglyphics on the south     wall of the hall of columns of Rameses II. at Karnal, also at Luxor     and in the Sallier Papyrus, and an epic poem referring to his mighty     deeds in no less than six different places.]    \"Have a care what thou sayest!\" shouted Amasis stamping on the floor.  \"Egypt was never so great, so flourishing as now! Rameses carried our  arms into distant lands and earned blood; through my labors the products  of our industry have been carried to all parts of the world and instead  of blood, have brought us treasure and blessing. Rameses caused the  blood and sweat of his subjects to flow in streams for the honor of his  own great name; under my rule their blood flows rarely, and the sweat  of their brow only in works of usefulness. Every citizen can now end his  days in prosperity and comfort. Ten thousand populous cities rise on the  shores of the Nile, not a foot of the soil lies untilled, every child  enjoys the protection of law and justice, and every ill-doer shuns the  watchful eye of the authorities.    \"In case of attack from without, have we not, as defenders of those  god-given bulwarks, our cataracts, our sea and our deserts, the finest  army that ever bore arms? Thirty thousand Hellenes beside our entire  Egyptian military caste? such is the present condition of Egypt! Rameses  purchased the bright tinsel of empty fame with the blood and tears of  his people. To me they are indebted for the pure gold of a peaceful  welfare as citizens--to me and to my predecessors, the Saitic kings!\"       [The science of fortification was very fairly understood by the     ancient Egyptians. Walled and battlemented forts are to be seen     depicted on their monuments. We have already endeavored to show     (see our work on Egypt. I. 78 and following) that, on the northeast,     Egypt defended from Asiatic invasion by a line of forts extending     from Pelusium to the Red Sea.]    \"And yet I tell thee,\" cried the prince, \"that a worm is gnawing at the  root of Egypt's greatness and her life. This struggle for riches and  splendor corrupts the hearts of the people, foreign luxury has given a  deadly blow to the simple manners of our citizens, and many an Egyptian  has been taught by the Greeks to scoff at the gods of his fathers. Every  day brings news of bloody strife between the Greek mercenaries and our  native soldiery, between our own people and the strangers. The shepherd  and his flock are at variance; the wheels of the state machinery are  grinding one another and thus the state itself, into total ruin. This  once, father, though never again, I must speak out clearly what is  weighing on my heart. While engaged in contending with the priests, thou  hast seen with calmness the young might of Persia roll on from the East,  consuming the nations on its way, and, like a devouring monster, growing  more and more formidable from every fresh prey. Thine aid was not, as  thou hadst intended, given to the Lydians and Babylonians against the  enemy, but to the Greeks in the building of temples to their false gods.  At last resistance seemed hopeless; a whole hemisphere with its rulers  lay in submission at the feet of Persia; but even then the gods  willed Egypt a chance of deliverance. Cambyses desired thy daughter in  marriage. Thou, however, too weak to sacrifice thine own flesh and blood  for the good of all, hast substituted another maiden, not thine own  child, as an offering to the mighty monarch; and at the same time, in  thy soft-heartedness, wilt spare the life of a stranger in whose hand he  the fortunes of this realm, and who will assuredly work its ruin; unless  indeed, worn out by internal dissension, it perish even sooner from its  own weakness!\"    Thus far Amasis had listened to these revilings of all he held dearest  in silence, though pale, and trembling with rage; but now he broke forth  in a voice, the trumpet-like sound of which pealed through the wide  hall: \"Know'st thou not then, thou boasting and revengeful son of evil,  thou future destroyer of this ancient and glorious kingdom, know'st  thou not whose life must be the sacrifice, were not my children, and the  dynasty which I have founded, dearer to me than the welfare of the whole  realm? Thou, Psamtik, thou art the man, branded by the gods, feared by  men--the man to whose heart love and friendship are strangers, whose  face is never seen to smile, nor his soul known to feel compassion!  It is not, however, through thine own sin that thy nature is thus  unblessed, that all thine undertakings end unhappily. Give heed, for now  I am forced to relate what I had hoped long to keep secret from thine  ears. After dethroning my predecessor, I forced him to give me his  sister Tentcheta in marriage. She loved me; a year after marriage there  was promise of a child. During the night preceding thy birth I fell  asleep at the bedside of my wife. I dreamed that she was lying on the  shores of the Nile, and complained to me of pain in the breast. Bending  down, I beheld a cypress-tree springing from her heart. It grew larger  and larger, black and spreading, twined its roots around thy mother and  strangled her. A cold shiver seized me, and I was on the point of flying  from the spot, when a fierce hurricane came from the East, struck the  tree and overthrew it, so that its spreading branches were cast into the  Nile. Then the waters ceased to flow; they congealed, and, in place  of the river, a gigantic mummy"]]]
