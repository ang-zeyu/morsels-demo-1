Accordingly Meek, Reese, Ebarts, and Nelson, volunteered to  accompany him. This party set out, first in the direction of Wind  River; but not discovering any signs of the lost Booshway in that  quarter, crossed over to the Sweetwater, and kept along down to the  North Fork of the Platte, and thence to the Black Hills, where they  found a beautiful country full of game; but not the hoped-for train,  with supplies. After waiting for a short time at the Black Hills,  Frapp's party returned to the North Fork of the Platte, and were  rejoiced to meet at last, the long absent partner, with his pack train.  Urged by Frapp, Fitzpatrick hastened forward, and came into camp on  Powder River after winter had set in.    Fitzpatrick had a tale to tell the other partners, in explanation of his  unexpected delay. When he had started for St. Louis in the month of  March previous, he had hoped to have met the old partners, Capt.  Sublette and Jedediah Smith, and to have obtained the necessary supplies  from them, to furnish the Summer rendezvous with plenty. But these  gentlemen, when he fell in with them, used certain arguments which  induced him to turn back, and accompany them to Santa Fe, where they  promised to furnish him goods, as he desired, and to procure for him an  escort at that place. The journey had proven tedious, and unfortunate.  They had several times been attacked by Indians, and Smith had been  killed. While they were camped on a small tributary of the Simmaron  River, Smith had gone a short distance from camp to procure water, and  while at the stream was surprised by an ambush, and murdered on the  spot, his murderers escaping unpunished. Sublette, now left alone in the  business, finally furnished him; and he had at last made his way back to  his Rocky Mountain camp.    But Fitzpatrick's content at being once more with his company was  poisoned by the disagreeable proximity of a rival company. If he had  annoyed Mr. Ogden of the Hudson's Bay Company, in the previous autumn,  Major Vanderburg and Mr. Dripps, of the American Company, in their turn  annoyed him. This company had been on their heels, from the Platte  River, and now were camped in the same neighborhood, using the Rocky  Mountain Company as pilots to show them the country. As this was just  what it was not for their interest to do, the Rocky Mountain Company  raised camp, and fairly ran away from them; crossing the mountains to  the Forks of the Snake River, where they wintered among the Nez Perces  and Flathead Indians.    Some time during this winter, Meek and Legarde, who had escaped from the  Pawnees, made another expedition together; traveling three hundred miles  on snowshoes, to the Bitter Root River, to look for a party of free  trappers, whose beaver the company wished to secure. They were absent  two months and a half, on this errand, and were entirely successful,  passing a Blackfoot village in the night, but having no adventures worth  recounting.          CHAPTER VI.      1832. In the following spring, the Rocky Mountain Fur Company commenced  its march, first up Lewis' Fork, then on to Salt River, thence to Gray's  River, and thence to Bear River. They fell in with the North American  Fur Company on the latter river, with a large lot of goods, but no  beaver. The American Company's resident partners were ignorant of the  country, and were greatly at a loss where to look for the good trapping  grounds. These gentlemen, Vanderburg and Dripps, were therefore inclined  to keep an eye on the movements of the Rocky Mountain Company, whose  leaders were acquainted with the whole region lying along the mountains,  from the head-waters of the Colorado to the northern branches of the  Missouri. On the other hand, the Rocky Mountain Company were anxious to  \"shake the dust from off their feet,\" which was trodden by the American  Company, and to avoid the evils of competition in an Indian country. But  they found the effort quite useless; the rival company had a habit of  turning up in the most unexpected places, and taking advantage of the  hard-earned experience of the Rocky Mountain Company's leaders. They  tampered with the trappers, and ferreted out the secret of their next  rendezvous; they followed on their trail, making them pilots to the  trapping grounds; they sold goods to the Indians, and what was worse, to  the hired trappers. In this way grew up that fierce conflict of  interests, which made it \"as much as his life was worth\" for a trapper  to suffer himself to be inveigled into the service of a rival company,  which about this time or a little later, was at its highest, and which  finally ruined the fur-trade for the American companies in the Rocky  Mountains.    Finding their rivals in possession of the ground, Bridger and Milton  Sublette resolved to spend but a few days in that country. But so far as  Sublette was concerned, circumstances ordered differently. A Rockway  Chief, named Gray, and seven of his people, had accompanied the camp  from Ogden's Hole, in the capacity of trappers. But during the sojourn  on Bear River, there was a quarrel in camp on account of some indignity,  real or fancied, which had been offered to the chief's daughter, and in  the affray Gray stabbed Sublette so severely that it was thought he must  die.    It thus fell out that Sublette had to be left behind; and Meek who was  his favorite, was left to take care of him while he lived, and bury him  if he died; which trouble Sublette saved him, however, by getting well.  But they had forty lonesome days to themselves after the camps had moved  off,--one on the heels of the other, to the great vexation of Bridger.  Time passed slowly in Sublette's lodge, while waiting for his wound to  heal. Day passed after day, so entirely like each other that the  monotony alone seemed sufficient to invite death to an easy conquest.  But the mountain-man's blood, like the Indians, is strong and pure, and  his flesh heals readily, therefore, since death would not have him, the  wounded man was forced to accept of life in just this monotonous form.  To him Joe Meek was everything,--hands, feet, physician, guard, caterer,  hunter, cook, companion, friend. What long talks they had, when Sublette  grew better: what stories they told; what little glimpses of a secret  chamber in their hearts, and a better than the every-day spirit, in  their bosoms, was revealed,--as men will reveal such things in the  isolation of sea-voyages, or the solitary presence of majestic Nature.    To the veteran mountaineer there must have been something soothing in  the care and friendship of the youth of twenty-two, with his daring  disposition, his frankness, his cheerful humor, and his good looks;--for  our Joe was growing to be a maturely handsome man--tall,  broad-shouldered, straight, with plenty of flesh, and none too much of  it; a Southerner's olive complexion; frank, dark eyes, and a classical  nose and chin. What though in the matter of dress he was ignorant of the  latest styles?--grace imparts elegance even to the trapper's beaver-skin  cap and blanket capote.    At the end of forty days, as many as it took to drown a world, Sublette  found himself well enough to ride; and the two set out on their search  for camp. But now other adventures awaited them. On a fork of Green  River, they came suddenly upon a band of Snake Indians feeding their  horses. As soon as the Snakes discovered the white men, they set up a  yell, and made an instinctive rush for their horses. Now was the  critical moment. One word passed between the travelers, and they made a  dash past the savages, right into the village, and never slacked rein  until they threw themselves from their horses at the door of the  Medicine lodge. This is a large and fancifully decorated lodge, which  stands in the centre of a village, and like the churches of Christians,  is sacred. Once inside of this, the strangers were safe for the present;  their blood could not be shed there.    The warriors of the village soon followed Sublette and Meek into their  strange house of refuge. In half an hour it was filled. Not a word was  addressed to the strangers; nor by them to the Indians, who talked  among themselves with a solemn eagerness, while they smoked the  medicine pipe, as inspiration in their councils. Great was the  excitement in the minds of the listeners, who understood the Snake  tongue, as the question of their life or death was gravely discussed;  yet in their countenances appeared only the utmost serenity. To show  fear, is to whet an Indian's appetite for blood: coolness confounds and  awes him when anything will.    If Sublette had longed for excitement, while an invalid in his lonely  lodge on Bear River, he longed equally now for that blissful seclusion.  Listening for, and hearing one's death-warrant from a band of  blood-thirsty savages, could only prove with bitter sharpness how sweet  was life, even the most uneventful. For hours the council continued, and  the majority favored the death-sentence. But one old chief, called the  good _Gotia_, argued long for an acquittal: he did not see the necessity  of murdering two harmless travelers of the white race. Nothing availed,  however, and just at sunset their doom was fixed.    The only hope of escape was, that, favored by darkness, they might elude  the vigilance of their jailers; and night, although so near, seemed ages  away, even at sundown. Death being decreed, the warriors left the lodge  one by one to attend to the preparation of the preliminary ceremonies.  Gotia, the good, was the last to depart. As he left the Medicine lodge  he made signs to the captives to remain quiet until he should return;  pointing upwards to signify that there was a chance of life; and  downwards to show that possibly they must die.

T. Swainson, jun. in the island of Cuba; nor am I aware of  its having by any other means reached our cabinets, excepting a distinct  variety which occurred in Mrs. Angus's, and is now (together with a young  one of the same) in Mr. Dubois's collection. This has, in addition to the  green bands on the spire, a row of bead-like cinereous spots at the base of  the first and second spiral whorl; and others of a longitudinal square form  on those whorls nearest the tip, which, with the inner lip, is slightly  tinged with pink. The form of the shell also is shorter; but the general  contour, and particularly the crenated mouth, common to both, clearly  proves it can be considered only as a distinct variety. The specimen we  have figured agrees with all those sent at the same time, in having not the  slightest appearance of spots, though in a perfect state of preservation.  The little notches on the margin of the lip are always placed at the  commencement of each of the green lines; the base of the column is  straight, and slightly truncated before it joins the outer lip.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 59    [Illustration]    PSITTACUS Barrabandii.    _Red-collared Parakeet._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 1.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _P. viridis, sincipite gulaque flavis; torque coccineo circa medium      cervicem extendente; rostro rubro; alis spuriis caerulescentibus._        Green, fore-part of the head and throat yellow; round the middle of the      neck in front an orange-red collar; bill red; spurious wings blueish.           *       *       *       *       *    The vast and little known region of New Holland has afforded us some of the  most beautiful birds of this superb family, and among which the species  now, as we believe, for the first time published, will stand conspicuous.  It is from a fine skin in the possession of Mr. Leadbeater, and is named in  honour of the late M. Barraband, the first ornithological painter that  France or any other country has produced.    The tail is very long, measuring eight inches three quarters; the total  length of the bird being near fifteen inches. The green which predominates  over the plumage is bright and changeable, having a blueish tinge on the  hind head, which is much darker and stronger on the outer margins of the  quills and middle of the tail-feathers: the back and scapulars are tinged  with an olive-brown; the spurious quills and their protecting covers are  greenish-blue, appearing in some lights entirely of the latter colour; the  inner margin of the quills and tail, as well as their entire under surface,  deep brownish-black; but the tips of the tail-feathers beneath are much  paler; the two middle feathers five inches longer than the outermost, and  extending near two inches beyond any of the others; their extremities  instead of being pointed are rather widened and rounded. Bill red; ears and  space between the eye and bill green; fore-part of the head, chin, and half  the neck, a clear orange-yellow, which is terminated by a narrow collar of  a beautiful orange-red; the remaining under plumage pale-green; inner  wing-covers darker. Legs black. The fourth, fifth and sixth quills notched  at their tips.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 60    [Illustration]    THYREUS Abbottii.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.

It appertains to the Linnaean genus _Sphinx_,  which can be viewed (from the immense diversity and great number of the  species) only as a family containing many and striking natural genera: in  modern arrangement it is most nearly allied to the _Sesiae_ of Fabricius,  from which, as it strikingly differs in the formation of the palpi and  antennae, I have separated it.    I have named this insect to commemorate the exertions of Mr. Abbott, well  known as having furnished the materials for that beautiful work the  Lepidopterous Insects of Georgia, edited by Sir James Edward Smith. And  from the unpublished drawings of this zealous collector, the larva and pupa  have been figured. Mr. Abbott writes that it is a rare species in Georgia,  and feeds on the grape. The female differs not in colour from the male,  which is here represented.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 61    [Illustration]    TAMYRIS Nurscia.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 33.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _T. alis nigris, anticis supra fascia centrali rufescente, infra      punctis duobus ad basim albidis; posticis infra caesiis, cinereis, basi      nigris linea obsoleta albida; margine nigro._        Wings black; anterior above with a central reddish band, and two white      basal dots beneath; posterior beneath grey and cinereous; base black      with an obsolete white line; margin black.           *       *       *       *       *    The marginal fringe of the lower wings in this species has a few white dots  between the nerves, and the upper surface is sprinkled or powdered in the  middle with blueish-green atoms; on the under surface of the anterior wings  the lower part of the band is orange, the upper bright rufous; and within  the black margin of the posterior wings is a large blueish spot, and two or  three whitish dots on the sides of the thorax. It seems nearest allied to  _Hesp. Celsus_ of Fabricius, which is only slightly described from Mr.  Jones's unpublished drawings.           *       *       *       *       *    TAMYRIS Laonome._--lower figure._           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _T. alis utrinque similibus, concoloribus fuscis, margine communi      aurantiacis; capite anoque rubris._        Wings in both sexes alike, uniform brown, with a common margin of      orange; head and tail red.           *       *       *       *       *    The under surface of this insect (a female) perfectly resembles the upper:  it will approach near to _Hesp.

For both these interesting insects, not to be found in Fabricius, I am  indebted to the liberality of my friend Professor Klug, Director of the  Royal Museum at Berlin: no note accompanied them, I therefore conclude they  are undescribed, and probably inhabiting South America.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 62    [Illustration]    PSITTACUS discolor.    _Red-shouldered Parakeet._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 1.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _P. viridis; fronte, mento, tegminibus inferioribus, macula cervicali,      lateribus et scapularibus coccineis; humeris puniceis; vertice,      tegminibus exterioribus remigibusque violaceis; rectricibus fulvo      marginatis._        P.

Dr. Shaw was the first  who described it in White's Voyage to New South Wales, where it is badly  represented. It has been since figured by Le Vaillant, probably from a  female or imperfect specimen, as the tail is represented by far too short,  and the colours not quite agreeing with that in my collection.    Total length eleven inches. The upper plumage bright green, tinged with  blue on the sides of the neck, lighter and yellowish beneath; the crown of  the head sapphire or violet-blue, with a crimson belt in front, and a large  patch of the same round the chin; paler spots of this colour are also in  front of the neck, breast, flanks, and under tail-covers; the under  wing-covers are deep crimson, as well as the inner shafts of some of the  lesser covers outside; the shoulders dark blood-colour; the outer  wing-covers deep-blue on the margin of the wings, gradually changing to a  vivid blue, which blends with the green. Quills black glossed with violet,  margined externally and internally with yellow. Tail near five inches long,  the middle feathers dark rufous tipped with blueish; the rest more or less  rufous at the base, and shining blue beyond.
