You have all along been allowed the  full scope of sense, imagination, and reason. Whatever, therefore, you  could before apprehend, either immediately or mediately by your senses,  or by ratiocination from your senses; whatever you could perceive,  imagine, or understand, remains still with you. If, therefore, the notion  you have of the creation by other Principles be intelligible, you have it  still upon mine; if it be not intelligible, I conceive it to be no notion  at all; and so there is no loss of it. And indeed it seems to me very  plain that the supposition of Matter, that is a thing perfectly unknown  and inconceivable, cannot serve to make us conceive anything. And, I hope  it need not be proved to you that if the existence of Matter doth not  make the creation conceivable, the creation's being without it  inconceivable can be no objection against its non-existence.    HYL.  I confess, Philonous, you have almost satisfied me in this point  of the creation.    PHIL.  I would fain know why you are not quite satisfied. You tell me  indeed of a repugnancy between the Mosaic history and Immaterialism: but  you know not where it lies. Is this reasonable, Hylas? Can you expect I  should solve a difficulty without knowing what it is? But, to pass by all  that, would not a man think you were assured there is no repugnancy  between the received notions of Materialists and the inspired writings?    HYL.  And so I am.    PHIL.  Ought the historical part of Scripture to be understood in a  plain obvious sense, or in a sense which is metaphysical and out of the  way?    HYL.  In the plain sense, doubtless.    PHIL.  When Moses speaks of herbs, earth, water, &c. as having been  created by God; think you not the sensible things commonly signified by  those words are suggested to every unphilosophical reader?    HYL.  I cannot help thinking so.    PHIL.  And are not all ideas, or things perceived by sense, to be denied  a real existence by the doctrine of the Materialist?    HYL.  This I have already acknowledged.    PHIL.  The creation, therefore, according to them, was not the  creation of things sensible, which have only a relative being, but of  certain unknown natures, which have an absolute being, wherein creation  might terminate?    HYL.  True.    PHIL.  Is it not therefore evident the assertors of Matter destroy the  plain obvious sense of Moses, with which their notions are utterly  inconsistent; and instead of it obtrude on us I know not what; something  equally unintelligible to themselves and me?    HYL.  I cannot contradict you.    PHIL.  Moses tells us of a creation. A creation of what? of unknown  quiddities, of occasions, or SUBSTRATUM? No, certainly; but of things  obvious to the senses. You must first reconcile this with your notions,  if you expect I should be reconciled to them.    HYL.  I see you can assault me with my own weapons.    PHIL.  Then as to ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE; was there ever known a more  jejune notion than that? Something it is so abstracted and unintelligible  that you have frankly owned you could not conceive it, much less explain  anything by it. But allowing Matter to exist, and the notion of absolute  existence to be clear as light; yet, was this ever known to make the  creation more credible? Nay, hath it not furnished the atheists and  infidels of all ages with the most plausible arguments against a  creation? That a corporeal substance, which hath an absolute existence  without the minds of spirits, should be produced out of nothing, by the  mere will of a Spirit, hath been looked upon as a thing so contrary to  all reason, so impossible and absurd! that not only the most celebrated  among the ancients, but even divers modern and Christian philosophers  have thought Matter co-eternal with the Deity. Lay these things together,  and then judge you whether Materialism disposes men to believe the  creation of things.    HYL.  I own, Philonous, I think it does not. This of the CREATION is  the last objection I can think of; and I must needs own it hath been  sufficiently answered as well as the rest. Nothing now remains to be  overcome but a sort of unaccountable backwardness that I find in myself  towards your notions.    PHIL.  When a man is swayed, he knows not why, to one side of the  question, can this, think you, be anything else but the effect of  prejudice, which never fails to attend old and rooted notions? And  indeed in this respect I cannot deny the belief of Matter to have very  much the advantage over the contrary opinion, with men of a learned  education.    HYL.  I confess it seems to be as you say.    PHIL.  As a balance, therefore, to this weight of prejudice, let us  throw into the scale the great advantages that arise from the belief of  Immaterialism, both in regard to religion and human learning. The being  of a God, and incorruptibility of the soul, those great articles of  religion, are they not proved with the clearest and most immediate  evidence? When I say the being of a God, I do not mean an obscure general  Cause of things, whereof we have no conception, but God, in the strict  and proper sense of the word. A Being whose spirituality, omnipresence,  providence, omniscience, infinite power and goodness, are as conspicuous  as the existence of sensible things, of which (notwithstanding the  fallacious pretences and affected scruples of Sceptics) there is no more  reason to doubt than of our own being.--Then, with relation to human  sciences. In Natural Philosophy, what intricacies, what obscurities, what  contradictions hath the belief of Matter led men into! To say nothing of  the numberless disputes about its extent, continuity, homogeneity,  gravity, divisibility, &c.--do they not pretend to explain all things by  bodies operating on bodies, according to the laws of motion? and yet, are  they able to comprehend how one body should move another? Nay, admitting  there was no difficulty in reconciling the notion of an inert being with  a cause, or in conceiving how an accident might pass from one body to  another; yet, by all their strained thoughts and extravagant  suppositions, have they been able to reach the MECHANICAL production of  any one animal or vegetable body? Can they account, by the laws of  motion, for sounds, tastes, smells, or colours; or for the regular course  of things? Have they accounted, by physical principles, for the aptitude  and contrivance even of the most inconsiderable parts of the universe?  But, laying aside Matter and corporeal, causes, and admitting only the  efficiency of an All-perfect Mind, are not all the effects of nature easy  and intelligible? If the PHENOMENA are nothing else but IDEAS; God is  a SPIRIT, but Matter an unintelligent, unperceiving being. If they  demonstrate an unlimited power in their cause; God is active and  omnipotent, but Matter an inert mass. If the order, regularity, and  usefulness of them can never be sufficiently admired; God is  infinitely wise and provident, but Matter destitute of all contrivance  and design. These surely are great advantages in PHYSICS. Not to  mention that the apprehension of a distant Deity naturally disposes men  to a negligence in their moral actions; which they would be more cautious  of, in case they thought Him immediately present, and acting on their  minds, without the interposition of Matter, or unthinking second  causes.--Then in METAPHYSICS: what difficulties concerning entity in  abstract, substantial forms, hylarchic principles, plastic natures,  substance and accident, principle of individuation, possibility of  Matter's thinking, origin of ideas, the manner how two independent  substances so widely different as SPIRIT AND MATTER, should mutually  operate on each other? what difficulties, I say, and endless  disquisitions, concerning these and innumerable other the like points, do  we escape, by supposing only Spirits and ideas?--Even the MATHEMATICS  themselves, if we take away the absolute existence of extended things,  become much more clear and easy; the most shocking paradoxes and  intricate speculations in those sciences depending on the infinite  divisibility of finite extension; which depends on that supposition--But  what need is there to insist on the particular sciences? Is not that  opposition to all science whatsoever, that frenzy of the ancient and  modern Sceptics, built on the same foundation? Or can you produce so much  as one argument against the reality of corporeal things, or in behalf of  that avowed utter ignorance of their natures, which doth not suppose  their reality to consist in an external absolute existence? Upon this  supposition, indeed, the objections from the change of colours in a  pigeon's neck, or the appearance of the broken oar in the water, must be  allowed to have weight. But these and the like objections vanish, if we  do not maintain the being of absolute external originals, but place the  reality of things in ideas, fleeting indeed, and changeable;--however,  not changed at random, but according to the fixed order of nature. For,  herein consists that constancy and truth of things which secures all the  concerns of life, and distinguishes that which is real from the  IRREGULAR VISIONS of the fancy.    HYL.  I agree to all you have now said, and must own that nothing can  incline me to embrace your opinion more than the advantages I see it is  attended with. I am by nature lazy; and this would be a mighty abridgment  in knowledge. What doubts, what hypotheses, what labyrinths of amusement,  what fields of disputation, what an ocean of false learning, may be  avoided by that single notion of IMMATERIALISM!    PHIL.  After all, is there anything farther remaining to be done? You  may remember you promised to embrace that opinion which upon examination  should appear most agreeable to Common Sense and remote from Scepticism.  This, by your own confession, is that which denies Matter, or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4731"],[0,"Seven Little Australians (#20)"],[1," had emptied it  and looked lovingly at the blue roses depicted upon it.  \"And to think  last time l ate off one I--\"    \"Was a little bride with the veil pushed back from your face,\" the old  lady said, \"and everyone watching you cut the cake.  Only two have broken  since--oh yes, Hannah, the girl who came after Emily, chipped off the  handle of the sugar-basin and broke a bit out of the slop-bowl.\"    \"Where did Father stand?\" Meg asked.  She was peopling the room with  wedding guests; the ham and the chops, the toast and eggs and dishes  of fruit, had turned to a great white towered cake with silver  leaves.    \"Just up there where Pip is sitting,\" Mrs. Hassal said, \"and he  was helping Esther with the cake, because she was cutting it  with his sword.  Such a hole you made in the table-cloth, Esther, my  very best damask one with the convolvulus leaves, but, of course,  I've darned it--dear, dear!\"    Baby had upset her coffee all over herself and her plate and Bunty,  who was next door.    She burst into tears of weariness and nervousness at the new people,  and slipped off her chair under the table.  Meg picked her up.    \"May I put her to bed?\" she said; \"she is about worn out.\"    \"Me, too,\" Nellie said, laying down her half-eaten scone and pushing  back her chair.  \"Oh, I am so tired!\"    \"So'm I.\"  Bunty finished up everything on his plate in choking  haste and stood up.  \"And that horrid coffee's running into my  boots.\"    So just as the sun began to smile and chase away the sky's heavy  tears, they all went to bed again to make up for the broken night,  and it was: six o'clock and tea-time before any of them opened their  eyes again.          CHAPTER XVI    Yarrahappini      Yarrahappini in the sunshine, the kind of sunshine that pushes the  thermometer's silver thread up to 100 deg.!    Right away in the distance on three sides was a blue hill line and  blue soft trees.    And up near the house the trees were green and beautiful, and the  flowers a blaze of colour.    But all the stretching plain between was brown. Brown burnt grass  with occasional patches of dull green, criss-crossed here and there  with fences; that ran up the little hills that in places broke the  plain's straight line, and disappeared in the dips where rank grass  and bracken flourished.  The head station consisted of quite a little  community of cottages on the top of a hill.  Years ago, when Esther  was no bigger than her own little General, there had been only a rough,  red weather-board place on the hill-top, and a bark but or two for  outhouses.    And Mr. Hassal had been in the saddle from morning to night, and  worked harder than any two of his own stockmen, and Mrs. Hassal had  laid aside her girlish accomplishments, her fancy work, her guitar,  her water-colours, and had scrubbed and cooked and washed as many a  settler's wife has done before, until the anxiously watched wool  market had brought them better days.    Then a big stone cottage reared itself slowly right in front of the  little old place with its bottle-bordered garden plot, where nothing  more aristocratic than pig's face and scarlet geranium had ever grown.  A beautiful cottage it was, with its plenitude of lofty rooms, its  many windows, and its deep veranda.  The little home was kitchen  and bedrooms for the two women servants now, and was joined to the  big place by a covered way.    A hundred yards away there was a two-roomed cottage that was occupied  by the son of an English baronet, who, for the consideration of  seventy pounds a year and rations kept the Yarrahappini business  books and gave out the stores.    Farther still, two bark humpies stood, back to back.  Tettawonga,  a bent old black fellow, lived in one, and did little else than  smoke and give his opinion on the weather every morning.    Twenty years ago he had helped to make a steady foundation for  the red cottage that had arrived ready built on a bullock-dray.    Fifteen years ago he had killed with his tomahawk one of two  bushrangers who were trying to pick up Yarrahappini in the  absence of his master, and he had carried little trembling  Mrs. Hassal and tiny Esther to place of safety, and gone back  and dealt the other one a blow on the head that stunned him  till assistance came.    So, of course, he had earned his right to the cottage and the  daily rations and the pipe that never stirred from his lips.    Two of the station hands lived in the other cottage when they  were not out in distant parts of the run.    Close to the house was a long weather-board building with a heavy,  padlocked door.    \"Oh, let's go in,\" Nell said, attracted by the size of the  padlock; \"it looks like a treasure-house in a book--mayn't we  go in, please, little grandma?\"    They were exploring all the buildings--the six children in a body,  Mrs. Hassal, whom they all called \"little grandma,\" much to her  pleasure, and Esther with the boy.    \"You must go and ask Mr. Gillet,\" the old lady said; \"he keeps  the keys of the stores.  See, over in that cottage near the tank,  and speak nicely, children, please.\"    \"Such a gentleman,\" she said in a low tone to Esther, \"so clever,  so polished, if only he did not drink so.\"    Meg and Judy went, with Baby hurrying after them as fast as her  short legs would allow.    \"Come in,\" a voice said, when they knocked.  Meg hesitated  nervously, and a man opened the door.  Such a great, gaunt man,  with restless, unhappy eyes, a brown, wide brow, and neatly  trimmed beard.    Judy stated that Mrs. Hassal had sent them for the keys, if he had  no objection.    He asked them to come in and sit down while he looked for them.    Meg was surprised at the room, as her blue eyes plainly showed, for  she had only heard him spoken of as the store-keeper.  There were  bookshelves, on which she saw Shakespeare and Browning and Shelley  and Rossetti and Tennyson, William Morris, and many others she had  never seen before.  There were neatly framed photographs and engravings  of English and Continental scenery on the walls.  There was a little  chased silver vase on a bracket, and some of the flowers from the  passion vines in it.  The table with the remains of breakfast on  it was as nice on a small scale as the one she had just left in  the big cottage.    He came back froth the inner room with the keys.  \"I was afraid I  had mislaid then,\" he said; \"the middle one opens the padlock,  Miss Woolcot; the brass fat one is for the two bins, and the  long steel one for the cupboard.\"    \"Thank you so much.  I'm afraid we disturbed you in the middle of your  breakfast,\" Meg said, standing up and blushing because she thought he  had noticed her surprise at the bookshelves.    He disclaimed the trouble, and held the door open for them with  a bow that had something courtly in it, at least so Meg thought,  puzzling how it came to be associated with salt beef by the  hundredweight and bins of flour.  He watched them go over the  grass--at least he watched Meg in her cool, summer muslin and  pale-blue belt, Meg in her shady chip hat, with the shining fluffy  plait hanging to her waist.    Judy's long black legs and crumpled cambric had no element of the  picturesque in them.    Mrs. Hassal unfastened the padlock of the store-room.  Such a  chorus of \"ohs!\" and \"ahs!\" there was from the children!      Baby had never seen so much sugar together in her life before; she  looked as if she would have liked to have been let loose in the  great bin for an hour or two.    And the currants!  There was a big wooden box brim full--about  forty pounds, Mrs. Hassal thought when questioned.    Bunty whipped up a handful and pocketed them when everyone was  looking at the mountain of candles.    \"Home-made! my DEAR, why, yes, of course,\" the old lady said.  \"Why, I wouldn't dream of using a bought candle, any more than  I would use bought soap.\"    She showed them the great bars of yellow, clean-smelling stuff,  with finer, paler-coloured for toilet purposes.    Hams and sides of bacon hung thickly from the rafters.  \"Those are  mutton hams,\" she said, pointing to one division.  \"I keep those  for the stockmen.\"    Pip wanted to know if the stores were meant to serve them all their  lives, there seemed enough of them: he was astonished to hear that  every six months they were replenished.    \"Twenty to thirty men, counting the boundary riders and stockmen  at different parts of the place; and double that number at shearing  or drafting times, not to mention daily sundowners--it's like feeding  an army, my dears,\" she said;  \"and then, you see, I had to make  preparations for all of you--Bunty especially.\"    Her little grey eyes twinkled merrily as she looked at that small  youth.    \"You can have them back,\" Bunty said, half sulkily.  He produced  half a dozen currants from his pocket.  \"I shouldn't think you'd  mind, with such a lot;  we only have a bottleful at home.\"    On which the old lady patted his head, unlocked a tin, and filled  his hands with figs and dates.    \"And have you to cook every day, for all those men?\" Meg said,  wondering what oven could be found large enough.    \"Dear, no!\" the old lady answered.  \"Dear, dear, no; each man  does everything for himself in his own hut; they don't even get  bread, only rations of flour to make damper for themselves.  Then  we give them a fixed, quantity of meat, tea, sugar, tobacco,  candles, soap, and one or two other things.\"    \"Where do you keep the wool and things?\" said Pip, who had a soul  above home-made soap and metal dips for candles; \"I can't see any  shed or anything.\"    Mrs. Hassal told him they were a mile away, down by the creek,  where the sheep were washed and sheared at the proper season.  But  the heat was too much to make even Pip want to go just then, so they  attached themselves to Mr. Hassal, leaving little grandma with  Esther, the General, and Baby, and went over to the brick stables  near.
