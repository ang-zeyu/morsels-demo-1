While I was there  I heard the most unfavorable reports with regard to the health of my  eldest son Henry. Prison life at Trenton had broken him down in body  as well as in spirit, and he had been ill, some of the time seriously,  nearly all the time since he went to Unadilla. The fact that he was  entirely innocent of the offence for which he was imprisoned, preyed  upon his mind, and with the worst results. As these stories reached me  from week to week, I became anxious and even alarmed about him, and at  last I left my lucrative business in Augusta and went to New York. I  could not well go to Unadilla to visit Henry without seeing his mother,  whom I had no desire to see; so I sent for him to come to me in the  city if was able to do so. I knew that if medicine or medical attendance  would benefit him, I should be able to help him.    In a few days he came to me in a most deplorable physical condition. He  was a mere wreck of his former self. Almost immediately he began to talk  about the attempt to abduct the boy from Oxford; how innocent he was in  the matter, and how terribly he had suffered merely because he happened  to be with me when I rashly endeavored to kidnap the lad. All this went  through me like a sharp sword. It seemed as if I was the cause, not only  of great unhappiness to myself, but of pain and misery to all who were  associated or brought in contact with me. For this poor boy, who had  endured and suffered so much on my account, I could not do enough. My  means and time must now be devoted to his recovery, if recovery, was  possible.    He was weak, but was still able to walk about, and he enjoyed riding  very much. I kept him with me in the city a week or two, taking daily  rides to the Park and into the country, and when he felt like going out  in the evening I made him go to some place of amusement with me. I had  no other business, and meant to have none, but to take care of Henry,  and I devoted myself wholly to his comfort and happiness. In a few days  he had much improved in health and spirits, so much so, that I meditated  making a long tour with him to the South, hoping that the journey there  and back again would fully restore him.    Fortunately, my recent Maine business had put me in possession of  abundant funds, and when I had matured my scheme, and saw that Henry  was in tolerable condition to travel, I proposed the trip to him, and he  joyfully assented to my plan. I wanted to get him far away, for awhile,  from a part of the country which was associated in his mind, more than  in mine, with so much misery, and he seemed quite as eager to go. Change  of air and scene I knew would do wonders for him bodily, and would build  him up again.    We made our preparations and started for the South, going first to  Baltimore and then on through the Southern States by railroad to New  Orleans. It was late in the fall of 1860, just before the rebellion,  when the south was seceding or talking secession, and was already  preparing for war. Henry's physical condition compelled us to rest  frequently on the way, and we stopped sometimes for two or three days  at a time, at nearly every large town or city on the entire route.  Everywhere there was a great deal of excitement; meetings were held  nearly every night secession was at fever heat, and there was an  unbounded expression and manifestation of ill-feeling against the north  and against northern men. Nevertheless, I was never in any part of  the Union where I was treated with so much courtesy, consideration and  genuine kindness as I was there and then. I was going south, simply to  benefit the invalid who accompanied me; everybody seemed to know it;  and everybody expressed the tenderest sympathy for my son. Wherever we  stopped, it seemed as if the people at the hotels, from the landlord  to the lowest servant, could not do enough for us. At Atlanta, Augusta,  Mobile, and other places, where we made our stay long enough to get a  little acquainted, my son and myself were daily taken out to ride, and  were shown everything of interest that was to be seen. Henry did not  enjoy this journey more than I did--to me as well as to him, the trip  was one prolonged pleasure, and by the time we reached New Orleans  nearly a month after we left New York, my son had so recuperated that I  had every hope of his speedy and full restoration.    It was the beginnings of winter when we reached New Orleans; but during  the whole month of December while we remained in that city, winter,  if indeed it was winter, which we could hardly believe, was only a  prolongation of the last beautiful autumn days we had left at the north.  Now Orleans was then at the very height of prosperity; business  was brisk, money was plenty, the ships of all nations and countless  steamboats from St. Louis, Cincinnati, Louisville and all points up the  Mississippi and Ohio rivers lay at the levee. The levee itself, from  end to end, for miles along the river front, was one mass of merchandise  which had come to the city, or was awaiting shipment. I had never seen a  livelier city. Indescribably gay, too, was New Orleans that winter. The  city was full of strangers; the hotels were thronged; there were balls  every night; the theatres were crowded, and everybody seemed bent  on having a good time. With all the rest, there was an extraordinary  military furor, and militia companies and regiments paraded the streets  every day, while secession meetings were held in various halls, or in  the public squares, nearly ever night.    From the St. Charles hotel where we stopped, St. Charles street seemed  ablaze and alive all night, and densely thronged all day. Sunday brought  no rest, for Sunday, so far as military parades, amusement and general  gaiety were concerned, was the liveliest day in the week; and Sunday  night the theatres were sure to present their best performances and to  draw their largest audiences. And so, from morning till night, and  from night till morning again, all was whirl, stir, bustle, business,  enjoyment, and excitement. To me, unaccustomed as I was to such scenes,  New York even seemed tame and dull, and slow in comparison with New  Orleans.    This is a picture of the Crescent City as it presented itself to me and  to my son in the early part of the winter before the war. No one knew  or even dreamed of the terrible times that were to come. No one believed  that war was probable, or even possible; it was well enough, perhaps,  to prepare for it; but secession was to be an accomplished fact, and  the North and all the world would quietly acknowledge it. This was the  general sentiment in the city; though secession, and what would, or what  might come of it, was the general topic of talk in the hotels, in the  restaurants, at the theatres, in the streets, everywhere. Now and then  some southerner with whom I had become acquainted would try to draw me  out to ascertain my sentiments on the subject, but I always laughed, and  said good naturedly:    \"My dear sir, I didn't come down here to talk about secession, but to  see if the southern climate would benefit my sick son.\"    The fact was that I minded my own business, and minded it so well that  while I was in New Orleans I managed to find a few patients and sold  recipes and medicines enough to pay the entire expenses of our journey  thus far, from the North.    Almost every day my son and I drove somewhere up to Carrolton, down to  the battle-ground, or on the shell road to Lake Ponchartrain. It was a  month of genuine enjoyment to us both; of profit to me pecuniarily; and  of the best possible benefit to Henry's health.    Early in January we took passage on one of the finest of the Mississippi  steamboats for St. Louis. The boat was crowded, and among the passengers  were a good many merchants, Northern men long resident in New Orleans,  who thought they saw trouble coming, and accordingly had closed up their  business in the Crescent City, and were now going North to stay there.  We had on board, too, the usual complement of gamblers and amateur or  professional poker-players, who kept the forward saloon near the bar,  and known in the river vernacular as the \"Texas\" of the boat, lively all  day long and well into the night, or rather the next morning. It was ten  or eleven days before we reached St. Louis. Nothing notable occurred  on the trip; but day after day, as we proceeded northward, and left  the soft, sunny south behind us, with the daily increasing coldness and  wintry weather, Henry seemed to decline by degrees, and gradually to  lose nearly all that he had gained since we left New York. When we  reached St. Louis he was seriously sick. I was very sorry we had come  away so soon in the season, and proposed that we should return and stay  in the south till spring; but Henry would not consent. There was nothing  to be done, then, but to hurry on to the east, and when we arrived in  New York Henry would not go home to his mother in Unadilla, but insisted  upon accompanying me to Boston. I was willing enough that he should go  with me, for then I could have him under my exclusive care; but when we  arrived in Boston he was so overcome by the excitement of travel, and  was so feeble from fatigue as well as disease, that instead of having  him go with me to Augusta, as I intended, by the advice of a friend I  took him into the country where he could be nursed, be quiet, and be  well taken care of till spring. I left him in good hands, promising  to come and see him as soon as I could, and then went back to my old  business in Augusta.    It required a little time to knot the new end of that business to the  end where I had broken off three months before; but I was soon in full  practice again and was once more making and saving money. I had no  matrimonial affair in hand, no temptation in fact, and none but strictly  professional engagements to fulfil."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4675"],[0,"The Sea-Witch; Or, The African Quadroon: A Story of the Slave Coast (#20)"],[1,"to place a few necessary articles  of clothing in a small package, and confine it to the back of his neck,  while he should divest himself of all garments, slip quietly into the  water on the seaward side of the ship, where none of the sentries were  immediately placed, the object being to guard the access to the shore  more especially. Once in the water he had only to strike out quietly for  the shore, trusting the dullness of the sentries and the favoring  darkness of the night to enable him to reach the land unobserved.    He had the most to fear from the sentry placed on the top-gallant  forecastle of the ship, as that post was so near to his line of passage.  He would have to swim around the bows far enough out to clear the land  tackle, and when he got on an even line with the ship's bows, this  sentry, if he happened to be on the lookout at the moment, could hardly  fail to see him on the surface of the water. To obviate this difficulty,  Leonard Hust, who was a sort of privileged person on board, being the  captain's confidential servant and man of all work, undertook to engage  the sentry's attention by sonic device, for a few moments, just at the  opportune period, while the prisoner should get fairly clear of the  ship.    \"See here, Bill,\" said Leonard Hust, carelessly, as he emerged from the  fore hatch; \"look ye, old boy, I have had such a dream, hang me if I can  sleep a wink.\"    \"What's that to me?\" growled the sentry, morosely, and not much more  than half awake.    \"Why, if you knew what it was I dreamed, you would think it was  something to you,\" continued the other, with assumed mystery and  seriousness.    \"Look ye, Leonard Hust,\" said the marine, \"do you know you arc talking  to a sentry on duty, and that it's clearly against the rules of the ship  to do so?\"    \"Why, as to the matter of that, I don't see hut that you are as much to  blame as I am,\" continued the other; \"but who is there to peach on  either of us?\"    \"That's true,\" added the marine, bringing the butt of his musket lightly  to the deck; \"but for all that, Leonard, it's dangerous business, for  you see if--hallo! what's that?\"    \"Nothing; nothing but me drawing this cork,\" said the other, quickly  producing a small bottle of brandy from his pocket, and urging the  marine to drink.    The temptation was too great, and the sleepy and tired sentinel drank a  heavy draught of the liquor, smacking his lips, and forgetting the sound  he had just heard, and which Leonard Hust very well knew was caused by  the prisoner's descent a little too quickly into the water, alongside  the ship.    \"Now, Bill, what do you think I did dream?\" continued the captain's man.    \"Bother it, how can I tell?\" answered the marine. \"Let it out if it's  worth telling.\"    \"Why, do you see, Bill, I kept tossing and turning uncomfortable-like  for an hour or so, until finally I thought I saw you, with your face as  black as the ace of spades, and your body dangling by the neck from the  main yard-arm of the ship, a dead man!\"    \"Well, that's comfortable at any rate,\" said the marine, \"and you  needn't trouble yourself in future, Leonard Hust, to repeat your dreams  to me, especially if they are personal.\"    \"Never mind, man, it was all a dream, no truth in it, you know. Come,  old boy, take another drink for companionship, and then good night to  you, and I'll turn in.\"    The marine greedily drained the rest of the bottle, and with swimming  eyes thanked Leonard for his kindness, bade him good night, and with an  unsteady step resumed his musket and his walk upon the forecastle. In  the meantime, Charles Bramble, who was an expert swimmer, had got out of  gunshot and even sight of the ship, or rather where his head could not  be discovered from the ship's deck, and was nearing the shore very fast.  He had secured, as he proposed, sufficient clothing upon the back of his  neck, and in an oil cloth covering, so as to keep it dry, to equip  himself quite comfortably on landing, and in these garments he was soon  dressed again, and making his way through the town to the mission house,  where he knew Helen Huntington and her mother to be, and where he knew,  also, that he could find at last temporary lodgings.    He had no longer any fear that his brother would resume the charge  concerning him before the court--bad as he knew him to be, he did not  believe that he would do this, though he doubted not that he would have  managed to have kept him in confinement, and perhaps to have carried him  thus to England, partly from revengeful feelings towards him, and partly  to keep him out of the presence of her whom he so tenderly loved. But,  lest his brother should be betrayed by his feelings into any extremity  of action concerning him, he resolved at once to write him a note,  declaring that their relationship was known, and that should any further  persecution be offered, the same should at once be made public to the  oppressor's disgrace.    With this purpose, he hardly awaited the breaking of day before he  possessed himself of writing materials, and wrote and despatched the  following to his brother:      \"CAPTAIN ROBERT BRAMBLE,--About the same time you receive this note, you  will also be made aware, doubtless, of my escape from durance vile in  your ship. The purpose of my sending yon this is not to ask any favors  at the hand of one who was never actuated towards me even in childhood  by a brother's regard, but whose sole desire and purpose have been to  oppress and injure one related to him by the nearest ties of  relationship. My object is rather to let you know that any further  attempt to arraign me before the court will lead at once to a public  declaration of the fact that your are my brother, a relationship which  necessity alone will compel me to publish to the people of Sierra Leone.      CHARLES BRAMBLE,      \"Alias CAPTAIN WILL RATLIN.\"      Charles Bramble felt that he was safe from further immediate oppression  on his brother's part, and that it was only necessary for him to keep  quietly within doors until some chance for shipping from the port should  occur, to enable him to disentangle himself from the singular web of  circumstances which chance had woven so net-like about him. In spite of  the sad accomplishments of the realization of his condition as it  regarded his brother, and the partial danger of his present position,  yet there was a lightness to his heart, a buoyancy in his breast, which  he had not known for nearly a score of years, for he now felt that all  shame of birth was removed from him, that he was respectably and even  highly born, and that in point of blood was even the equal, full equal  of that fair and lovely girl he regarded so devotedly.    Of course there was no disguise between Charles Bramble and Helen, and  her mother, as to the charge brought against him. They knew very well  that he had been engaged in the evil trade of the coast, but they knew  also that he had conducted his part of the business upon the most humane  principles which the traffic would admit, and that he was not a  principal, but an agent in the business, sailing his ship as rich owners  had directed, and also that besides the fact of his having utterly  renounced the trade altogether since he became acquainted with Helen  Huntington, his heart and feelings had never been engaged in its  necessary requirements. Realizing these facts, we say, neither Helen nor  her mother regarded Captain Ratlin (the only character in which they yet  knew him) to be actually and seriously culpable as to at charge of  inhumanity.    The gratification which Helen evinced on meeting him the next morning  after his escape from the ship, was too honest, too unmistakable in its  import not to raise up fresh hopes in his heart, that, in spite of his  seeming disgrace, his confinement as a prisoner, his trial as an outlaw,  and his fallen fortunes generally, still there was one heart that beat  purely and tenderly with at least a sister's affection for him, and even  Mrs. Huntington, who had not for one moment suspected the true state of  her daughter's sentiments towards the young commander, did not hesitate  to salute him tenderly, and assure him of her gratification at his  release from bondage. She was a generous hearted woman, frank and  honorable in her sentiments, and she secretly rejoiced that they had,  herself and daughter unitedly, been able to exert a refining influence  over so chivalric and noble a character, as she fully realized Captain  Ratlin to be at heart, and in all his inward promptings.    Charles Bramble still hesitated as to revealing his relationship to  Captain Robert Bramble, from real feelings of delicacy, even to Mrs.  Huntington, whom he felt he could trust, partly because he had reason to  know that the mother had favored the suit of his brother whom Helen had  rejected in India, and partly because at present of his own equivocal  situation. But to Helen herself he felt that he might, indeed that he  must reveal the important truth, and that very evening as they sat  together in one of the spacious apartments of the mission house, he took  her hand within his own, and asked her if he might confide in her as he  would have done with a dear sister.    \"You know, Captain Ratlin, that I feel so much indebted to you, in so  many ways, that any little service I am capable of doing for you would  be but a grateful pleasure,\" was the instant and frank reply of the  beautiful girl, while a heightened glow mantled her cheek.    \"Then, Helen, listen to me, and if I am too excited in speaking of a  subject so immensely important to me, I trust you will forgive me.  Already I have given you a rough outline of my story, rough and uncouth  indeed, since I could give it no commencement. You will remember that  previous to the fall I got on ship-board, while a boy in the 'Sea Lion,'  I could recall no event. It was all a blank to me, and my "]]]
