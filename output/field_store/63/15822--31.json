Well, I'm going home now to tell dad, and then I'm going to start  out. Yesterday, you said it was, you saw Happy Harry? Well, I'll get  right after him,\" and leaving a somewhat surprised, but very much  delighted, colored man behind him, Tom mounted his motor-cycle and  started for home at a fast pace.          CHAPTER XXII.    THE STRANGE MANSION      \"Dad, I've got a clue!\" exclaimed Tom, hurrying into the house late  that afternoon, following a quick trip from where he had met  Eradicate with his sawmill. \"A good clue, and I'm going to start  early in the morning to run it down.\"    \"Wait a minute, now, Tom,\" cautioned his father slowly. \"You know  what happens when you get excited. Nothing good was ever done in a  hurry.\"    \"Well, I can't help being excited, dad. I think I'm on the trail of  those scoundrels. I almost wish I could start to-night.\"    \"Suppose you tell me all about it,\" and Mr. Swift laid aside a  scientific book he was reading.    Whereupon Tom told of his meeting with the colored man, and what  Eradicate had said about the tramp.    \"But he may not be the same Happy Harry you are looking for,\"  interposed Mr. Swift. \"Tramps who don't like to work, and who have a  jolly disposition, also those who ask for money and have designs  tattooed on their hands, are very common.\"    \"Oh, but I'm sure this is the same one,\" declared Tom. \"He wants to  stay in this neighborhood until he locates his confederates. That's  why he's hanging around. Now I have an idea that the deserted  mansion, where Eradicate used to work, and which once housed General  Harkness and his family, is the rendezvous of this gang of thieves.\"    \"You are taking a great deal for granted, Tom.\"    \"I don't think so, dad. I've got to assume something, and maybe I'm  wrong, but I don't think so. At any rate, I'm going to try, if  you'll let me.\"    \"What do you mean to do?\"    \"I want to go to that deserted mansion and see what I can find. If I  locate the thieves, well--\"    \"You may run into danger.\"    \"Then you admit I may be on the right track, dad?\"    \"Not at all,\" and Mr. Swift smiled at the quick manner in which Tom  turned the tables on him. \"I admit there may be a band of tramps in  that house. Very likely there is--almost any deserted place would be  attractive to them. But they may not be the ones you seek. In fact,  I hardly see how they can be. The men who stole my model and patent  papers are wealthy. They would not be very likely to stay in  deserted houses.\"    \"Perhaps some of the scoundrels whom they hired might, and through  them I can get on the track of the principals.\"    \"Well, there is something in that,\" admitted Mr. Swift.    \"Then may I go, dad?\"    \"I suppose so. We must leave nothing untried to get back the stolen  model and papers. But I don't want you to run any risks. If you  would only take some one with you. There's your chum, Ned Newton.  Perhaps he would go.\"    \"No, I'd rather work it alone, dad. I'll be careful. Besides, Ned  could not get away from the bank. I may have to be gone a week, and  he has no motor-cycle. I can manage all right.\"    Tom was off bright and early. He had carefully laid his plans, and  had decided that he would not go direct to Pineford, which was the  nearest village to the old Harkness mansion.    \"If those fellows are in hiding they will probably keep watch on who  comes to the village,\" thought Tom. \"The arrival of some one on a  motor-cycle will be sure to be reported to them, and they may skip  out. I've got to come up from another direction, so I think I'll  circle around, and reach the mansion from the stretch of woods on  the north.\"    He had inquired from Eradicate as to the lay of the land, and had a  good general idea of it. He knew there was a patch of woodland on  one side of the mansion, while the other sides were open.    \"I may not be able to ride through the woods,\" mused Tom, \"but I'll  take my machine as close as I can, and walk the rest of the way.  Once I discover whether or not the gang is in the place, I'll know  what to do.\"    To follow out the plan he had laid down for himself meant that Tom  must take a roundabout way. It would necessitate being a whole day  on the road, before he would be near the head of Lake Carlopa, where  the Harkness house was located. The lake was a large one, and Tom  had never been to the upper end.    When he was within a few miles of Pineford, Tom took a road that  branched off and went around it. Stopping at night in a lonely  farmhouse, he pushed on the next morning, hoping to get to the woods  that night. But a puncture to one of the tires delayed him, and  after that was repaired he discovered something wrong with his  batteries. He had to go five miles out of his way to get new cells,  and it was dusk when he came to the stretch of woods which he knew  lay between him and the old mansion.    \"I don't fancy starting in there at night,\" said Tom to himself.  \"Guess I'd better stay somewhere around here until morning, and then  venture in. But the question is where to stay?\"    The country was deserted, and for a mile or more he had seen no  houses. He kept on for some distance farther, the dusk falling  rapidly, and when he was about to turn back to retrace his way to  the last farmhouse he had passed, he saw a slab shanty at the side  of the road.    \"That's better than nothing, provided they'll take me in for the  night,\" murmured Tom. \"I'm going to ask, anyhow.\"    He found the shanty to be inhabited by an old man who made a living  burning charcoal. The place was not very attractive, but Tom did not  mind that, and finding the charcoal-burner a kindly old fellow, soon  made a bargain with him to remain all night.    Tom slept soundly, in spite of his strange surroundings, and after a  simple breakfast in the morning inquired of the old man the best way  of penetrating the forest.    \"You'd best strike right along the old wood road,\" said the  charcoal-burner. \"That leads right to the lake, and I think will  take you where you want to go. The old mansion is not far from the  lake shore.\"    \"Near the lake, eh?\" mused Tom as he started off, after thanking the  old fellow. \"Now I wonder if I'd better try to get to it from the  water or the land side?\"    He found it impossible to ride fast on the old wood road, and when he  judged he was so close to the lake that the noise of his motor-cycle  might be heard, he shut off the power, and walked along, pushing  it. It was hard traveling, and he felt weary, but he kept on, and  about noon was rewarded by a sight of something glittering through the  trees.    \"That's the lake!\" Tom exclaimed, half aloud. \"I'm almost there.\"    A little later, having hidden his motor-cycle in a clump of bushes,  he made his way through the underbrush and stood on the shore of  Lake Carlopa. Cautiously Tom looked about him. It was getting well  on in the afternoon, and the sun was striking across the broad sheet  of water. Tom glanced up along the shore. Something amid a clump of  trees caught his eyes. It was the chimney of a house. The young  inventor walked a little distance along the lake shore. Suddenly he  saw, looming up in the forest, a large building. It needed but a  glance to show that it was falling into ruins, and had no signs of  life about it. Nor, for that matter, was there any life in the  forest around him, or on the lake that stretched out before him.    \"I wonder if that can be the place?\" whispered Tom, for, somehow,  the silence of the place was getting on his nerves. \"It must be it,\"  he went on. \"It's just as Rad described it.\"    He stood looking at it, the sun striking full on the mysterious  mansion, hidden there amid the trees. Suddenly, as Tom looked, he  heard the \"put-put\" of a motor-boat. He turned to one side, and saw,  putting out from a little dock that he had not noticed before, a  small craft. It contained one man, and no sooner had the young  inventor caught a glimpse of him than he cried out:    \"That's the man who jumped over our fence and escaped!\"    Then, before the occupant of the boat could catch sight of him, Tom  turned and fled back into the bushes, out of view.          CHAPTER XXIII.    TOM IS PURSUED      Tom was so excited that he hardly knew what to do. His first thought  was to keep out of sight of the man in the boat, for the young  inventor did not want the criminals to suspect that he was on their  trail. To that end he ran back until he knew he could not be seen  from the lake. There he paused and peered through the bushes. He  caught a glimpse of the man in the motor-boat. The craft was making  fast time across the water.    \"He didn't see me,\" murmured Tom. \"Lucky I saw him first. Now what  had I better do?\"    It was a hard question to answer. If he only had some one with whom  to consult he would have felt better, but he knew he had to rely on  himself. Tom was a resourceful lad, and he had often before been  obliged to depend on his wits. But this time very much was at stake,  and a false move might ruin everything.    \"This is certainly the house,\" went on Tom, \"and that man in the  boat is one of the fellows who helped rob me. Now the next thing to  do is to find out if the others of the gang are in the old mansion,  and, if they are, to see if dad's model and papers are there. Then  the next thing to do will be to get our things away, and I fancy  I'll have no easy job.\"    Well might Tom think this, for the men with whom he had to deal were  desperate characters, who had already dared much to accomplish their  ends, and who would do more before they would suffer defeat. Still,  they under-estimated the pluck of the lad who was pitted against  them.    \"I might as well proceed on a certain plan, and have some system  about this affair,\" reasoned the lad. \"Dad is a great believer in  system, so I'll lay out a plan and see how nearly I can follow it.  Let's see--what"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324"],[0,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus (#20)"],[1,"se, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated  with the blood of your remaining friends.\"    \"Abhorred monster! fiend that thou art! the tortures of hell are too  mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! you reproach me with  your creation; come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so  negligently bestowed.\"    My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the  feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.    He easily eluded me, and said--    \"Be calm! I entreat you to hear me, before you give vent to your hatred  on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to  increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of  anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made  me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine; my joints  more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to  thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my  natural lord and king, if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which  thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other, and  trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and  affection, is most due. Remember, that I am thy creature; I ought to be  thy Adam; but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy  for no misdeed. Every where I see bliss, from which I alone am  irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend.  Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.\"    \"Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you and  me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in  which one must fall.\"    \"How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable  eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion? Believe  me, Frankenstein: I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and  humanity: but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my creator, abhor  me; what hope can I gather from your fellow-creatures, who owe me  nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and dreary  glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the caves of  ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one  which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder  to me than your fellow-beings. If the multitude of mankind knew of my  existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my  destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep no  terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my  wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver them  from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not  only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up  in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be moved, and do not  disdain me. Listen to my tale: when you have heard that, abandon or  commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve. But hear me. The  guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their  own defence before they are condemned. Listen to me, Frankenstein. You  accuse me of murder; and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience,  destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the eternal justice of man! Yet I  ask you not to spare me: listen to me; and then, if you can, and if you  will, destroy the work of your hands.\"    \"Why do you call to my remembrance,\" I rejoined, \"circumstances, of  which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and  author? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light!  Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you! You have  made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power to  consider whether I am just to you, or not. Begone! relieve me from the  sight of your detested form.\"    \"Thus I relieve thee, my creator,\" he said, and placed his hated hands  before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; \"thus I take from  thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me, and grant  me thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this  from you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of  this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon  the mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to  hide itself behind yon snowy precipices, and illuminate another world,  you will have heard my story, and can decide. On you it rests, whether I  quit for ever the neighbourhood of man, and lead a harmless life, or  become the scourge of your fellow-creatures, and the author of your own  speedy ruin.\"    As he said this, he led the way across the ice: I followed. My heart was  full, and I did not answer him; but, as I proceeded, I weighed the  various arguments that he had used, and determined at least to listen to  his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my  resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my  brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.  For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards  his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I  complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with his  demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock.  The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend: we entered the  hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart, and  depressed spirits. But I consented to listen; and, seating myself by the  fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.          CHAPTER XI.      \"It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of  my being: all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.  A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,  and smelt, at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I  learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By  degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I  was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me, and troubled  me; but hardly had I felt this, when, by opening my eyes, as I now  suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked, and, I believe,  descended; but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.  Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch  or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no  obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light became  more and more oppressive to me; and, the heat wearying me as I walked, I  sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the forest near  Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my  fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused me  from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found  hanging on the trees, or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst at the  brook; and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.    \"It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half-frightened, as it  were instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted  your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some  clothes; but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of  night. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could  distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat  down and wept.    \"Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens, and gave me a sensation of  pleasure. I started up, and beheld a radiant form rise from among the  trees.[2] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly, but it  enlightened my path; and I again went out in search of berries. I was  still cold, when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which  I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct ideas  occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger, and  thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rung in my ears, and on all  sides various scents saluted me: the only object that I could  distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with  pleasure.    [Footnote 2: The moon.]    \"Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had  greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each  other. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with  drink, and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted  when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my  ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had  often intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe, with  greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me, and to perceive the  boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I  tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds, but was unable.  Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the  uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into  silence again.    \"The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened  form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My sensations  had, by this time, become distinct, and my mind received every day  additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light, and to  perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from  the herb, and, by degrees, one herb from another. I found that the  sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and  thrush were sweet and enticing.    \"One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been  left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the  warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live  embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange,"]]]
