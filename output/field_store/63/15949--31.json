They chat with their polite guides, many of whom are gallant captains,  and go one after another up the little flight of steps which leads to  the room of the officer of the day.    He passes them, if he pleases, up the crooked stairways, and when they  have climbed three of these, they enter a sort of garret-room, oblong,  and plastered white, and about as large as an ordinary town-house  parlor.    Four doors open into it--that by which we have entered, two from the  left, where the witnesses wait, and one at the end, near the left far  corner, which is the outlet from the cells.    A railing, close up to the stairway door, gives a little space in the  foreground for witnesses; two tables, transverse to this rail, are for  the commission and the press, the first-named being to the right;  between these are a raised platform and pivot arm-chair for the witness;  below are the sworn phonographers and the counsel for the accused, and  then another rail like that separating the crowd from the court, holds  behind it the accused and their guards.    These are they who are living not by years nor by weeks, but by breaths.  They are motley enough, for the most part, sitting upon a long bench  with their backs against the wall,--ill-shaved, haggard, anxious, and  the dungeon door at their left opens now and then to show behind it a  moving bayonet. There are women within the court proper, edging upon the  reporters, introduced there by a fussy usher, and through four windows  filters the imperfect daylight, making all things distinguishable, yet  shadowy. The _coup d'oeil_ of this small and crowded scene is lively as  a popular funeral.    There is the witness with raised hand, pointing toward heaven, and  looking at Judge Holt. The gilt stars, bars, and orange-colored sashes  of the commission; the women's brilliant silks and bonnets; the crowding  spectators, with their brains in their eyes; the blue coats of the  guards; the working scribes; and last of all the line of culprits, whose  suspected guilt has made them worthy of all illustration.    Between the angle of the wall and the studded door, under the heavy bar  of dressed stone which marks above the thickness of the gaol, sits all  alone a woman's figure, clothed in solemn black. Her shadowy skirt hides  her feet, so that we cannot see whether they are riveted; her sleeves of  sable sweep down to her wrist, and dark gloves cover the plumpness of  her hand, while a palm-leaf fan nods to and fro to assist the obscurity  of her vail of crape, descending from her widow's bonnet.      A solitary woman, beginning the line of coarse indicted men, shrinking  beneath the scornful eyes of her sex, and the as bold survey of men more  pitiful, may well excite, despite her guilt, a moment of sympathy.    Let men remember that she is the mother of a son who has fled to save  his forfeit life by deserting her to shame, and perhaps, to death. Let  women, who will not mention her in mercy, learn from her end, in all  succeeding wars, to make patriotism of their household duties and not  incite to blood.    Mrs. Surratt is a graduate of that seminary which spits in soldiers  faces, denounces brave generals upon the rostrum, and cries out for an  interminable scaffold when all the bells are ringing peace.    How far her wicked love influenced her to participation in the murder  rests in her own breast, and up to this time she has not differed from  mothers at large--to twist her own bow-string rather than build his  gibbet.    Beneath her shadowy bonnet, over her fan-tip, we see two large, sad  eyes, rising and falling, and now and then when the fan sways to and  fro, the hair just turning gray with trouble, and the round face growing  wan and seamed with terrible reflection, are seen a moment crouching  low, as if she would wish to grovel upon the floor and bury her forehead  in her hands.    Yet, sometimes, across Mrs. Surratt's face a stealthiness creeps--a sort  of furtive, feline flashing of the eye, like that of one which means to  leap sideways. At these times her face seems to grow hard and colorless,  as if that tiger expression which Pradier caught upon the face of  Brinvilliers and fastened into a masque, had been repeated here. Not to  grow mawkish while we must be kind, let us not forget that this woman is  an old plotter. If she did not devise the assassination, she was privy  to it long. She was an agent of contraband mails--a bold, crafty,  assured rebel--perhaps a spy--and in the event of her condemnation, let  those who would plead for her spend half their pity upon that victim  whose heart was like a woman's, and whose hand was merciful as a  mother's.    Before the door sits an officer, uncovered, who does not seem to labor  under any particular fear, chiefly because the captives are ironed to  immovability, and he stares and smiles alternately, as if he were  somewhat amiable and extremely bored.    Next to the officer is a shabby-looking boy, whose seat is by the right  jamb of the jail door. Of all boys just old enough to feel their oats,  this boy is the most commonplace. His parents would be likely to have no  sanguine hopes of his reaching the presidency; for his head indicates  latent dementia, and a slice or two from it would recommend him, without  exanimation, to the school for the feeble-minded. Better dressed, and  washed, and shaved, he might make a tolerable adornment to a hotel door,  or even reach the dignity of a bar-keeper or an usher at a theatre. But  that this fellow should occupy a leaf in history and be confounded with  a tragedy entering into the literature of the world, reverses manifest  destiny, and leaves neither phrenology nor physiognomy a place to stand  upon.    Come up! Gall, Spurzheim, and Lavater, and remark his sallow face,  attenuated by base excesses! Do you know any forehead so broad which  means so little? the oyster could teach this man philosophy! His chin is  sharp, his eyes are blank blue, his short black hair curls over his  ears, and his beard is of a prickly black, with a moustache which does  not help his general contemptibleness. A dirty grayish shirt without a  linen collar, is seen between the lapels of the greasy and dusty cloth  coat, sloping at the shoulders; and under his worn brown trowsers, the  manacle of iron makes an ugly garter to his carpet clipper.    This is David Harold, who shared the wild night-ride of Booth, and  barely escaped that outlaw's death in the burning barn.    He stoops to the rail of the dock, now and then, to chat with his  attorney, and a sort of blank anxiety which he wears, as his head turns  here and there, shifts to a frolicking smile. But a woman of unusual  attractions enters the court, and Harold is much more interested in her  than in his acquittal.    Great Caesar's dust, which stopped a knot-hole, has in this play boy an  inverse parallel. He was at best hostler to a murderer, and failed in  that. His chief concern at present is to have somebody to talk to; and  he thinks upon the whole, that if an assassination is productive of so  little fun, he will have nothing to do with another one.    That Harold has slipped into history gives us as much surprise as that  he has yet to suffer death gives us almost contempt for the scaffold.  But if the scaffold must wait for only wise men to get upon it, it must  rot. Your wise man does no murder in the first place, and if so, in the  second, he dodges the penalty. In this world, Harold, idiotcy is oftener  punished than guilt.    That Booth should have used Harold is very naturally accounted for.  Actors live only to be admired; vanity rises to its climax in them.  Booth preferred this sparrow to sing him peans rather than live by an  eagle and be screamed at now and then.    At the right hand side of Harold sits a soldier in blue, who is  evidently thinking about a game of quoits with his comrades in the jail  yard; he wonders why lawyers are so very dry, and is surprised to find a  trial for murder as tedious as a thanksgiving sermon.    But on the soldier's other hand is a figure which makes the center and  cynosure of this thrilling scene. Taller by a whole head than either his  companions or the sentries, Payne, the assassin, sits erect, and flings  his barbarian eye to and fro, radiating the tremendous energy of his  colossal physique.    He is the only man worthy to have murdered Mr. Seward. When against the  delicate organization, the fine, subtle, nervous mind of the Secretary  of State, this giant, knife in hand, precipitated himself, two forms of  civilization met as distinctly as when the savage Gauls invaded the  Roman senate.    Lawlessness and intelligence, the savage and the statesman, body and  mind, fought together upon Mr. Seward's bed.    The mystery attending Payne's home and parentage still exists to make  him more incomprehensible. Out of the vague, dim _ultima thule_, like  those Asiatic hordes which came from nowhere and shivered civilization,  Payne suddenly appeared and fought his way to the _sanctum sanctorum_ of  law. I think his part in the assassination more remarkable than Booth's,  The latter's crime was shrewdly plotted, as by one measuring  intelligence with the whole government. But Payne did not think--he only  struck!    With this man's face before me as I write, I am reminded of some Maori  chief waging war from the lust of blood or the pride of local dominion.  His complexion is bloodless, yet so healthy that a passing observer  would afterward speak of it as ruddy. His face is broad, with a  character nose, sensual lips, and very high cheek bones; the cranium is  full and the brow speaking, while the head runs back to an abnormal apex  at the tip of the cerebellum. His straight, lusterless black hair, duly  parted, is at the summit so disturbed that tufts of it rise up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6630"],[0,"Curiosities of the Sky (#20)"],[1,", because it seemed to  him that an inadmissible quantity of energy was demanded to account  for such action. But no calculation like that which he made is final,  since all calculations depend upon the validity of the data; and no  authority is unshakable in science, because no man can possess  omniscience. It was Lord Kelvin who, but a few years before the thing  was actually accomplished, declared that aerial navigation was an  impracticable dream, and demonstrated its impracticability by  calculation. However the connection may be brought about, it is as  certain as evidence can make it that solar outbursts are coincident  with terrestial magnetic disturbances, and coincident in such a way as  to make the inference of a causal connection irresistible. The sun is  only a little more than a hundred times its own diameter away from the  earth. Why, then, with the subtle connection between them afforded by  the ether which conveys to us the blinding solar light and the  life-sustaining solar heat, should it be so difficult to believe that  the sun's enormous electric energies find a way to us also? No doubt  the impulse coming from the sun acts upon the earth after the manner  of a touch upon a trigger, releasing energies which are already stored  up in our planet.    But besides the evidence afforded by such occurrences as have been  related of an intimate connection between solar outbreaks and  terrestial magnetic flurries, attended by magnificent auroral  displays, there is another line of proof pointing in the same  direction. Thus, it is known that the sun-spot period, as remarked in  a preceding chapter, coincides in a most remarkable manner with the  periodic fluctuations in the magnetic state of the earth. This  coincidence runs into the most astonishing details. For instance, when  the sun-spot period shortens, the auroral period shortens to precisely  the same extent; as the short sun-spot periods usually bring the most  intense outbreaks of solar activity, so the corresponding short  auroral periods are attended by the most violent magnetic storms; a  secular period of about two hundred and twenty-two years affecting  sun-spots is said to have its auroral duplicate; a shorter period of  fifty-five and a half years, which some observers believe that they  have discovered appears also to be common to the two phenomena; and  yet another ``superposed'' period of about thirty-five years, which  some investigators aver exists, affects sun-spots and aurora alike. In  short, the coincidences are so numerous and significant that one would  have to throw the doctrine of probability to the winds in order to be  able to reject the conclusion to which they so plainly lead.    But still the question recurs: How is the influence transmitted? Here  Arrhenius comes once more with his hypothesis of negative corpuscles,  or ions, driven away from the sun by light-pressure -- a hypothesis  which seems to explain so many things -- and offers it also as an  explanation of the way in which the sun creates the Aurora. He would  give the Aurora the same lineage with the Zodiacal Light. To  understand the application of this theory we must first recall the  fact that the earth is a great magnet having its two opposite poles of  magnetism, one near the Arctic and the other near the Antarctic  Circle. Like all magnets, the earth is surrounded with ``lines of  force,'' which, after the manner of the curved rays we saw in the  photograph of a solar eclipse, start from a pole, rising at first  nearly vertically, then bend gradually over, passing high above the  equator, and finally descending in converging sheaves to the opposite  pole. Now the axis of the earth is so placed in space that it lies at  nearly a right angle to the direction of the sun, and as the streams  of negatively charged particles come pouring on from the sun (see the  last preceding chapter), they arrive in the greatest numbers over the  earth's equatorial regions. There they encounter the lines of magnetic  force at the place where the latter have their greatest elevation  above the earth, and where their direction is horizontal to the  earth's surface. Obeying a law which has been demonstrated in the  laboratory, the particles then follow the lines of force toward the  poles. While they are above the equatorial regions they do not become  luminescent, because at the great elevation that they there occupy  there is virtually no atmosphere; but as they pass on toward the north  and the south they begin to descend with the lines of force, curving  down to meet at the poles; and, encountering a part of the atmosphere  comparable in density with what remains in an exhausted Crookes tube,  they produce a glow of cathode rays. This glow is conceived to  represent the Aurora, which may consequently be likened to a gigantic  exhibition of vacuum-tube lights. Anybody who recalls his student days  in the college laboratory and who has witnessed a display of Northern  Lights will at once recognize the resemblance between them in colors,  forms, and behavior. This resemblance had often been noted before  Arrhenius elaborated his hypothesis.    Without intending to treat his interesting theory as more than a  possibly correct explanation of the phenomena of the Aurora, we may  call attention to some apparently confirmatory facts. One of the most  striking of these relates to a seasonal variation in the average  number of aurorae. It has been observed that there are more in March  and September than at any other time of the year, and fewer in June  and December; moreover (and this is a delicate test as applied to the  theory), they are slightly rarer in June than in December. Now all  these facts seem to find a ready explanation in the hypothesis of  Arrhenius, thus: (1) The particles issuing from the sun are supposed  to come principally from the regions whose excitement is indicated by  the presence of sun-spots (which accords with Hale's observation that  sun-spots are columns of ionized vapors), and these regions have a  definite location on either side of the solar equator, seldom  approaching it nearer than within 5 deg. or 10 deg. north or south, and never  extending much beyond 35 deg. toward either pole; (2) The equator of the  sun is inclined about 7 deg. to the plane of the earth's orbit, from which  it results that twice in a year -- viz., in June and December -- the  earth is directly over the solar equator, and twice a year -- viz., in  March and September -- when it is farthest north or south of the solar  equator, it is over the inner edge of the sun-spot belts. Since the  corpuscles must be supposed to be propelled radially from the sun, few  will reach the earth when the latter is over the solar equator in June  and December, but when it is over, or nearly over, the spot belts, in  March and September, it will be in the line of fire of the more active  parts of the solar surface, and relatively rich streams of particles  will reach it. This, as will be seen from what has been said above, is  in strict accord with the observed variations in the frequency of  aurorae. Even the fact that somewhat fewer aurorae are seen in June than  in December also finds its explanation in the known fact that the  earth is about three million miles nearer the sun in the winter than  in the summer, and the number of particles reaching it will vary, like  the intensity of light, inversely as the square of the distance. These  coincidences are certainly very striking, and they have a cumulative  force. If we accept the theory, it would appear that we ought to  congratulate ourselves that the inclination of the sun's equator is so  slight, for as things stand the earth is never directly over the most  active regions of the sun-spots, and consequently never suffers from  the maximum bombardment of charged particles of which the sun is  capable. Incessant auroral displays, with their undulating draperies,  flitting colors, and marching columns might not be objectionable from  the point of view of picturesqueness, but one magnetic storm of  extreme intensity following closely upon the heels of another, for  months on end, crazing the magnetic needle and continually putting the  telegraph and cable lines out of commission, to say nothing of their  effect upon ``wireless telegraphy'', would hardly add to the charms of  terrestrial existence.    One or two other curious points in connection with Arrhenius'  hypothesis may be mentioned. First, the number of aurorae, according to  his explanation, ought to be greatest in the daytime, when the face of  the earth on the sunward side is directly exposed to the atomic  bombardment. Of course visual observation can give us no information  about this, since the light of the Aurora is never sufficiently  intense to be visible in the presence of daylight, but the records of  the magnetic observatories can be, and have been, appealed to for  information, and they indicate that the facts actually accord with the  theory. Behind the veil of sunlight in the middle of the afternoon,  there is good reason to believe, auroral exhibitions often take place  which would eclipse in magnificence those seen at night if we could  behold them. Observation shows, too, that aurorae are more frequent  before than after midnight, which is just what we should expect if  they originate in the way that Arrhenius supposes. Second, the theory  offers an explanation of the alleged fact that the formation of clouds  in the upper air is more frequent in years when aurorae are most  abundant, because clouds are the result of the condensation of  moisture upon floating particles in the atmosphere (in an absolutely  dustless atmosphere there would be no clouds), and it has been proved  that negative ions like those supposed to come from the sun play a  master part in the phenomena of cloud formation.    Yet another singular fact, almost mystical in its suggestions,"]]]
