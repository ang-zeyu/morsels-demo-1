I know      he is making me look far too pretty in it, although he      persists in saying he can't do me justice.  He is going to      send it to some great exhibition when finished, but he says      he will make a little water-color copy for me.        He comes every day to paint and we talk a great deal and he      reads me lovely things out of his books.  I don't understand      them all, but I try to, and he explains them so nicely and is      so patient with my stupidity.  And he says any one with my      eyes and hair and coloring does not need to be clever.  He      says I have the sweetest, merriest laugh in the world.  But I      will not write down all the compliments he has paid me.  I      dare say he does not mean them at all.        In the evening we stroll among the spruces or sit on the      bench under the acacia tree.  Sometimes we don't talk at all,      but I never find the time long.  Indeed, the minutes just      seem to fly--and then the moon will come up, round and red,      over the harbor and Mr. Osborne will sigh and say he supposes      it is time for him to go.                                                            July 24.        I am so happy.  I am frightened at my happiness.  Oh, I      didn't think life could ever be so beautiful for me as it is!        Paul loves me!  He told me so to-night as we walked by the      harbor and watched the sunset, and he asked me to be his      wife.  I have cared for him ever since I met him, but I am      afraid I am not clever and well-educated enough for a wife      for Paul.  Because, of course, I'm only an ignorant little      country girl and have lived all my life on a farm.  Why, my      hands are quite rough yet from the work I've done.  But Paul      just laughed when I said so, and took my hands and kissed      them.  Then he looked into my eyes and laughed again, because      I couldn't hide from him how much I loved him.        We are to be married next spring and Paul says he will take      me to Europe.  That will be very nice, but nothing matters so      long as I am with him.        Paul's people are very wealthy and his mother and sisters are      very fashionable.  I am frightened of them, but I did not      tell Paul so because I think it would hurt him and oh, I      wouldn't do that for the world.        There is nothing I wouldn't suffer if it would do him any      good.  I never thought any one could feel so.  I used to      think if I loved anybody I would want him to do everything      for me and wait on me as if I were a princess.  But that is      not the way at all.  Love makes you very humble and you want      to do everything yourself for the one you love.                                                          August 10.        Paul went home to-day.  Oh, it is so terrible!  I don't know      how I can bear to live even for a little while without him.      But this is silly of me, because I know he has to go and he      will write often and come to me often.  But, still, it is so      lonesome.  I didn't cry when he left me because I wanted him      to remember me smiling in the way he liked best, but I have      been crying ever since and I can't stop, no matter how hard I      try.  We have had such a beautiful fortnight.  Every day      seemed dearer and happier than the last, and now it is ended      and I feel as if it could never be the same again.  Oh, I am      very foolish--but I love him so dearly and if I were to lose      his love I know I would die.                                                          August 17.        I think my heart is dead.  But no, it can't be, for it aches      too much.        Paul's mother came here to see me to-day.  She was not angry      or disagreeable.  I wouldn't have been so frightened of her      if she had been.  As it was, I felt that I couldn't say a      word.  She is very beautiful and stately and wonderful, with      a low, cold voice and proud, dark eyes.  Her face is like      Paul's but without the loveableness of his.        She talked to me for a long time and she said terrible      things--terrible, because I knew they were all true.  I      seemed to see everything through her eyes.  She said that      Paul was infatuated with my youth and beauty but that it      would not last and what else had I to give him?  She said Paul      must marry a woman of his own class, who could do honor to      his fame and position.  She said that he was very talented      and had a great career before him, but that if he married me      it would ruin his life.        I saw it all, just as she explained it out, and I told her at      last that I would not marry Paul, and she might tell him so.      But she smiled and said I must tell him myself, because he      would not believe any one else.  I could have begged her to      spare me that, but I knew it would be of no use.  I do not      think she has any pity or mercy for any one.  Besides, what      she said was quite true.        When she thanked me for being so REASONABLE I told her I was      not doing it to please her, but for Paul's sake, because I      would not spoil his life, and that I would always hate her.      She smiled again and went away.        Oh, how can I bear it?  I did not know any one could suffer      like this!                                                          August 18.        I have done it.  I wrote to Paul to-day.  I knew I must tell      him by letter, because I could never make him believe it face      to face.  I was afraid I could not even do it by letter.  I      suppose a clever woman easily could, but I am so stupid.      I wrote a great many letters and tore them up, because I felt      sure they wouldn't convince Paul.  At last I got one that I      thought would do.  I knew I must make it seem as if I were      very frivolous and heartless, or he would never believe.  I      spelled some words wrong and put in some mistakes of grammar      on purpose.  I told him I had just been flirting with him,      and that I had another fellow at home I liked better.  I said      FELLOW because I knew it would disgust him.  I said that it      was only because he was rich that I was tempted to marry him.        I thought my heart would break while I was writing      those dreadful falsehoods.  But it was for his sake, because      I must not spoil his life.  His mother told me I would be a      millstone around his neck.  I love Paul so much that I would      do anything rather than be that.  It would be easy to die for      him, but I don't see how I can go on living.  I think my      letter will convince Paul.    I suppose it convinced Paul, because there was no further entry  in the little brown book.  When we had finished it the tears were  running down both our faces.    \"Oh, poor, dear Miss Emily,\" sobbed Diana.  \"I'm so sorry I ever  thought her funny and meddlesome.\"    \"She was good and strong and brave,\" I said.  \"I could never have  been as unselfish as she was.\"    I thought of Whittier's lines,        \"The outward, wayward life we see      The hidden springs we may not know.\"    At the back of the little brown book we found a faded water-color  sketch of a young girl--such a slim, pretty little thing, with  big blue eyes and lovely, long, rippling golden hair.  Paul  Osborne's name was written in faded ink across the corner.    We put everything back in the box.  Then we sat for a long time  by my window in silence and thought of many things, until the  rainy twilight came down and blotted out the world.        IX. SARA'S WAY    The warm June sunshine was coming down through the trees, white  with the virginal bloom of apple-blossoms, and through the  shining panes, making a tremulous mosaic upon Mrs. Eben Andrews'  spotless kitchen floor.  Through the open door, a wind, fragrant  from long wanderings over orchards and clover meadows, drifted  in, and, from the window, Mrs. Eben and her guest could look down  over a long, misty valley sloping to a sparkling sea.    Mrs. Jonas Andrews was spending the afternoon with her  sister-in-law.  She was a big, sonsy woman, with full-blown peony  cheeks and large, dreamy, brown eyes.  When she had been a slim,  pink-and-white girl those eyes had been very romantic.  Now they  were so out of keeping with the rest of her appearance as to be  ludicrous.    Mrs. Eben, sitting at the other end of the small tea-table that  was drawn up against the window, was a thin little woman, with a  very sharp nose and light, faded blue eyes.  She looked like a  woman whose opinions were always very decided and warranted to  wear.    \"How does Sara like teaching at Newbridge?\" asked Mrs. Jonas,  helping herself a second time to Mrs. Eben's matchless black  fruit cake, and thereby bestowing a subtle compliment which Mrs.  Eben did not fail to appreciate.    \"Well, I guess she likes it pretty well--better than down at  White Sands, anyway,\" answered Mrs. Eben.  \"Yes, I may say it  suits her.  Of course it's a long walk there and back.  I think  it would have been wiser for her to keep on boarding at  Morrison's, as she did all winter, but Sara is bound to be home  all she can.  And I must say the walk seems to agree with her.\"    \"I was down to see Jonas' aunt at Newbridge last night,\" said  Mrs. Jonas, \"and she said she'd heard that Sara had made up her  mind to take Lige Baxter at last, and that they were to be  married in the fall.  She asked me if it was true.  I said I  didn't know, but I hoped to mercy it was.  Now, is it, Louisa?\"    \"Not a word of it,\" said Mrs. Eben sorrowfully.  \"Sara hasn't any  more notion of taking Lige than ever she had.  I'm sure it's not  MY fault.  I've talked and argued till I'm tired.  I declare to  you, Amelia, I am terribly disappointed.  I'd set my heart on  Sara's marrying Lige--and now to think she won't!\"    \"She is a very foolish girl,\" said Mrs. Jonas, judicially.  \"If  Lige Baxter "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5341"],[0,"Kilmeny of the Orchard (#20)"],[1,"  \"No, it will not be difficult at all. I have one argument that will  convince you speedily--and that is Kilmeny Gordon herself. But we will  not discuss the matter of my wisdom or lack of it just now. What I want  to know is this--what do you think of the case as I have stated it to  you?\"    David frowned thoughtfully.    \"I hardly know what to think. It is very curious and unusual, but it  is not totally unprecedented. There have been cases on record where  pre-natal influences have produced a like result. I cannot just now  remember whether any were ever cured. Well, I'll see if anything can be  done for this girl. I cannot express any further opinion until I have  examined her.\"    The next morning Eric took David up to the Gordon homestead. As they  approached the old orchard a strain of music came floating through  the resinous morning arcades of the spruce wood--a wild, sorrowful,  appealing cry, full of indescribable pathos, yet marvelously sweet.    \"What is that?\" exclaimed David, starting.    \"That is Kilmeny playing on her violin,\" answered Eric. \"She has great  talent in that respect and improvises wonderful melodies.\"    When they reached the orchard Kilmeny rose from the old bench to meet  them, her lovely luminous eyes distended, her face flushed with the  excitement of mingled hope and fear.    \"Oh, ye gods!\" muttered David helplessly.    He could not hide his amazement and Eric smiled to see it. The latter  had not failed to perceive that his friend had until now considered him  as little better than a lunatic.    \"Kilmeny, this is my friend, Dr. Baker,\" he said.    Kilmeny held out her hand with a smile. Her beauty, as she stood there  in the fresh morning sunshine beside a clump of her sister lilies,  was something to take away a man's breath. David, who was by no means  lacking in confidence and generally had a ready tongue where women were  concerned, found himself as mute and awkward as a school boy, as he  bowed over her hand.    But Kilmeny was charmingly at ease. There was not a trace of  embarrassment in her manner, though there was a pretty shyness. Eric  smiled as he recalled HIS first meeting with her. He suddenly realized  how far Kilmeny had come since then and how much she had developed.    With a little gesture of invitation Kilmeny led the way through the  orchard to the wild cherry lane, and the two men followed.    \"Eric, she is simply unutterable!\" said David in an undertone. \"Last  night, to tell you the truth, I had a rather poor opinion of your  sanity. But now I am consumed with a fierce envy. She is the loveliest  creature I ever saw.\"    Eric introduced David to the Gordons and then hurried away to his  school. On his way down the Gordon lane he met Neil and was half  startled by the glare of hatred in the Italian boy's eyes. Pity  succeeded the momentary alarm. Neil's face had grown thin and haggard;  his eyes were sunken and feverishly bright; he looked years older than  on the day when Eric had first seen him in the brook hollow.    Prompted by sudden compassionate impulse Eric stopped and held out his  hand.    \"Neil, can't we be friends?\" he said. \"I am sorry if I have been the  cause of inflicting pain on you.\"    \"Friends! Never!\" said Neil passionately. \"You have taken Kilmeny from  me. I shall hate you always. And I'll be even with you yet.\"    He strode fiercely up the lane, and Eric, with a shrug of his shoulders,  went on his way, dismissing the meeting from his mind.    The day seemed interminably long to him. David had not returned when  he went home to dinner; but when he went to his room in the evening he  found his friend there, staring out of the window.    \"Well,\" he said, impatiently, as David wheeled around but still kept  silence, \"What have you to say to me? Don't keep me in suspense any  longer, David. I have endured all I can. To-day has seemed like a  thousand years. Have you discovered what is the matter with Kilmeny?\"    \"There is nothing the matter with her,\" answered David slowly, flinging  himself into a chair by the window.    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Just exactly what I say. Her vocal organs are all perfect. As far as  they are concerned, there is absolutely no reason why she should not  speak.\"    \"Then why can't she speak? Do you think--do you think--\"    \"I think that I cannot express my conclusion in any better words than  Janet Gordon used when she said that Kilmeny cannot speak because  her mother wouldn't. That is all there is to it. The trouble is  psychological, not physical. Medical skill is helpless before it. There  are greater men than I in my profession; but it is my honest belief,  Eric, that if you were to consult them they would tell you just what I  have told you, neither more nor less.\"    \"Then there is no hope,\" said Eric in a tone of despair. \"You can do  nothing for her?\"    David took from the back of his chair a crochet antimacassar with a lion  rampant in the center and spread it over his knee.    \"I can do nothing for her,\" he said, scowling at that work of art. \"I  do not believe any living man can do anything for her. But I do not  say--exactly--that there is no hope.\"    \"Come, David, I am in no mood for guessing riddles. Speak plainly, man,  and don't torment me.\"    David frowned dubiously and poked his finger through the hole which  represented the eye of the king of beasts.    \"I don't know that I can make it plain to you. It isn't very plain  to myself. And it is only a vague theory of mine, of course. I cannot  substantiate it by any facts. In short, Eric, I think it is possible  that Kilmeny may speak sometime--if she ever wants it badly enough.\"    \"Wants to! Why, man, she wants to as badly as it is possible for any one  to want anything. She loves me with all her heart and she won't marry  me because she can't speak. Don't you suppose that a girl under such  circumstances would 'want' to speak as much as any one could?\"    \"Yes, but I do not mean that sort of wanting, no matter how strong the  wish may be. What I do mean is--a sudden, vehement, passionate inrush of  desire, physical, psychical, mental, all in one, mighty enough to rend  asunder the invisible fetters that hold her speech in bondage. If any  occasion should arise to evoke such a desire I believe that Kilmeny  would speak--and having once spoken would thenceforth be normal in that  respect--ay, if she spoke but the one word.\"    \"All this sounds like great nonsense to me,\" said Eric restlessly. \"I  suppose you have an idea what you are talking about, but I haven't. And,  in any case, it practically means that there is no hope for her--or me.  Even if your theory is correct it is not likely such an occasion as you  speak of will ever arise. And Kilmeny will never marry me.\"    \"Don't give up so easily, old fellow. There HAVE been cases on record  where women have changed their minds.\"    \"Not women like Kilmeny,\" said Eric miserably. \"I tell you she has all  her mother's unfaltering will and tenacity of purpose, although she  is free from any taint of pride or selfishness. I thank you for your  sympathy and interest, David. You have done all you could--but, heavens,  what it would have meant to me if you could have helped her!\"    With a groan Eric flung himself on a chair and buried his face in his  hands. It was a moment which held for him all the bitterness of death.  He had thought that he was prepared for disappointment; he had not known  how strong his hope had really been until that hope was utterly taken  from him.    David, with a sigh, returned the crochet antimacassar carefully to its  place on the chair back.    \"Eric, last night, to be honest, I thought that, if I found I could not  help this girl, it would be the best thing that could happen, as far  as you were concerned. But since I have seen her--well, I would give my  right hand if I could do anything for her. She is the wife for you, if  we could make her speak; yes, and by the memory of your mother\"--David  brought his fist down on the window sill with a force that shook the  casement,--\"she is the wife for you, speech or no speech, if we could  only convince her of it.\"    \"She cannot be convinced of that. No, David, I have lost her. Did you  tell her what you have told me?\"    \"I told her I could not help her. I did not say anything to her of my  theory--that would have done no good.\"    \"How did she take it?\"    \"Very bravely and quietly--'like a winsome lady'. But the look in her  eyes--Eric, I felt as if I had murdered something. She bade me good-bye  with a pitiful smile and went upstairs. I did not see her again,  although I stayed to dinner as her uncle's request. Those old  Gordons are a queer pair. I liked them, though. They are strong and  staunch--good friends, bitter enemies. They were sorry that I could not  help Kilmeny, but I saw plainly that old Thomas Gordon thought that I  had been meddling with predestination in attempting it.\"    Eric smiled mechanically.    \"I must go up and see Kilmeny. You'll excuse me, won't you, David? My  books are there--help yourself.\"    But when Eric reached the Gordon house he saw only old Janet, who told  him that Kilmeny was in her room and refused to see him.    \"She thought you would come up, and she left this with me to give you,  Master.\"    Janet handed him a little note. It was very brief and blotted with  tears.    \"Do not come any more, Eric,\" it ran. \"I must not see you, because it  would only make it harder for us both. You must go away and forget me.  You will be thankful for this some day. I shall always love and pray for  you.\"                                                          \"KILMENY.\"    \"I MUST see her,\" said Eric desperately. \"Aunt Janet, be my friend. Tell  her she must see me for a little while at least.\"    Janet shook her head but went upstairs. She soon returned.    \"She says she cannot come down. You know she means it, Master, and it  is of no use to coax her. And I must say"]]]
