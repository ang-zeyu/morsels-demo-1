At this point Hunston could not repress a shudder.    And why? He thought of what must necessarily follow.    His fevered fancy flew ahead, and he saw himself in the dock, faced by  the stony-faced judge, and put through the torture of cross-examination  which laid bare the innermost recesses of his black heart in spite of  himself.    He saw further on yet.    He shut his eyes as he went on and heard the tramp of the twelve jurors  re-entering the court in the midst of a profound and awesome silence.    He heard the solemn formula; he heard the hollow voice of the foreman  give the verdict--    \"Guilty!\"    All that he heard and saw in his mind's eye, in that brief but  unpleasant hustling he had to go through at the hands of the ungenerous  and indefatigable officer Daniel Pike.    And Hunston now, being half cowed by his captor, was being driven  through the streets like a lamb to the slaughter, when a sudden and  startling incident changed the whole spirit of the scene, even in the  twinkling of an eye.    A musket, grasped in a strong hand by the barrel, was swung over their  heads, and down it came with an awful crack upon poor Pike's head.    Down he dropped like a bullock under the butcher's pole-axe.    And Hunston was free.    For a few seconds he could not realise his release, so sudden and  unexpected it had been.    \"Come along,\" said a voice in his ear; \"away with you, or we shall get  into trouble here.\"    This aroused him.    He recognised the voice of Tomaso the brigand, and it brought him to  his presence of mind.    Off he started at a good brisk run in the direction that his preserver  had taken.    And soon was out of danger.    But Tomaso was not so fortunate.    Following Hunston at a more leisurely pace, he had not gone many yards,  when a firm grip was placed upon his shoulder.    \"Halt!\" said a voice.    The brigand turned hastily, and found himself in the firm clutch of the  detective.    \"I have caught you at last, villain!\" exclaimed Pike the detective, as  he twisted his hand into the collar of the garment Tomaso wore instead  of a shirt.    Then, before the astonished brigand had time either to remonstrate or  resist, the Englishman exhibited to him that particular form of  wrestling known as the \"cross buttock,\" and stretched him at full  length on the ground.    Another moment and a pair of real Bow Street handcuffs snapped on  Tomaso's wrists.    \"Neatly done; don't you think so?\" said Pike.    Tomaso's answer was a tremendous Greek oath.    \"You're swearing, I believe. Now that is a bad habit at all times, and  very foolish just now, because you see it don't hurt me, inasmuch as I  don't understand it,\" said Pike, who, after a brief, stern survey of  his captive, added--    \"If you cursed me in English, though, I don't know but what I might be  tempted to punch your ugly head.\"    Tomaso remained silent, and Pike, after pausing some seconds, helped  him to his feet.    \"Now you are all right, and will come back quietly with me. But how do  the bracelets fit? I've got another pair in my pocket.\"    \"You had better release me,\" observed Tomaso.    \"Now that is very ridiculous, my friend. Why should I take the trouble  of capturing you, if I let you run again directly?\"    \"It will be much to your disadvantage to imprison me, Signor  Englishman. An injured Greek is always avenged in some way.\"    \"Just so; however, I'll risk that\"    Pike's coolness added to the rage of the brigand, whose passion fairly  boiled over.    \"May all the infernal gods my forefathers worshipped--may the fiend I--\"    \"Serve,\" suggested Pike.    \"The fiend I would willingly serve, or sell my soul to, for vengeance,  visit you with his direst displeasure, and may all the plagues of Egypt  blight you!\"    \"Thank ye, that's a very pleasant speech; something like what I used to  hear at the theatre. But, old friend, you made one little blunder.\"    \"You will see if I have blundered.\"    \"One little blunder, when you spoke of selling your soul. Lor' bless  you, Old Scratch isn't such a fool as to buy nowadays, whatever he may  have done years ago.\"    Another angry exclamation from Tomaso.    \"You see, the old gentleman has gained some experience as a trader, and  he knows well enough that if he waits a little time, he'll get you all  free-gratis for nothing at all.\"    \"You are a devil, Englishman.\"    \"And you are not exactly an angel. However, if I am a devil, you may  consider you are regularly sold to me. So now come along; keep your  hands under your cloak, and no one will notice the little decorations  on your wrists.\"    \"You are a devil, Signor Englishman; but you will die for this.\"    \"Pshaw! I've collared scores of desperate villains, and they all said  something of the same kind, yet here I am.\"    \"You will die,\" repeated Tomaso.    \"Some clay, of course; but we have a proverb in England; would you like  to hear it?\"    Tomaso tossed his head with lofty indifference.    \"The proverb,\" continued Pike, \"is that 'Threatened men live long.'\"    He then took Tomaso by the arm, and led him on.    \"But stop,\" said he, \"those pistols in your girdle are very heavy. I'll  carry them for you, and the knife as well.\"          CHAPTER XVII.    THE DECOY--A THROW OF THE DICE--THE EXECUTION.      Before Pike and his captive had gone far on their return journey,  Harkaway and Harvey, with two or three of the gendarmes, and a minute  after Jefferson, came up.    \"You have caught him then. Hurrah!\" said Dick Harvey.    \"But this is not Hunston,\" said Harkaway.    \"No, sir; he managed to get clean away. But we'll have him yet.\"    An old goatherd, who had scrambled down near to the place where the  captor and prisoner stood, might have been seen to indulge in a  contemptuous smile.    We say might, because the fact is that all were so much elated at the  capture of Tomaso that the very presence of the old stranger had  hitherto remained unnoticed.    Nor did he seem to court attention, but remained behind a bush, in a  spot, however, where he could hear all that passed.    \"Well, we must take this fellow back to the town, and hand him over to  the authorities,\" said Harvey.    \"And then hunt down Master Hunston,\" remarked old Jack. \"I wish we knew  where to look for him.\"    \"He took this direction,\" remarked Pike.    \"True.\"    \"And, therefore, it is in this direction that we must look for him.\"    \"Right again,\" remarked Dick Harvey.    \"But as he is associated with some desperate fellows, it would be as  well to place this gentleman in the hands of the authorities before we  seek him. It is not good to go into action with prisoners on our  hands.\"    As all agreed on this point, they walked back with the prisoner, and  had the pleasure of seeing him put into a cell from which, apparently,  there was no way of escape, even the fire-place having been bricked up  since the attempt of Mathias to gain freedom that way. By the time that  was done it was too late to think of starting that day, so our friends  retired to hold a council of war.    Pike, however, took no part in the consultation.    That astute detective had formed in his own mind a resolution that, if  it were possible, he would capture Hunston single-handed, thus covering  himself with glory, and at the same time keeping the Harkaways and  Harvey out of danger.    Pike knew that it was a difficult thing to keep them out of danger, and  that if they heard any thing about the brigands, they would be the very  ones to lead an attack.    Pike walked up and down, smoking and reflecting on the difficulties  which surrounded his task.    He had not thoroughly matured his plans when the sun went down and the  moon rose.    Few people were abroad.    The audacity the brigands had recently displayed had convinced most  people that they were safer indoors than out.    As Pike walked up and down the quiet street, he noticed an old man  crouched up in a corner, wrapped in a tattered cloak, and apparently  intending to pass the night there.    \"Hilloa, my friend, what are you? Are you one of the brigands?\"    Pike uttered the words in a jocular manner, but the old man felt deeply  offended.    \"Sir Englishman, you insult me.\"    \"I apologise. I had no intention of doing so.\"    \"A brigand! Signor, I am here--houseless and penniless in my old age  through those accursed villains! May Sathanas fly away with their  souls.\"    \"Well, old man, perchance you will be avenged before long.\"    \"It is what I pray for. They burnt my hut, cut down my two fine olive  trees, and drove off my little flock of goats.\"    The old man covered his face, and appeared to sob violently.    \"When was this?\" asked Pike.    \"Scarce three hours since.\"    \"Was there with them a foreigner--one of my country?\"    \"I know not what country they were of, but besides the Greeks, there  were two men who seemed leaders; one was called Signor Toro, the other  was named Hunston.\"    \"How many were there in all?\"    \"Three Greeks besides the two foreigners.\"    \"Do you know any thing of the haunts of these brigands, friend  goatherd?\"    \"Aye, well. But till now I have never dreamt of betraying them, for  they never before molested me.\"    \"Lead me to their den.\"    \"You, signer? Why, they are at least five in number, and you are but--\"    \"But an Englishman! that makes all the difference, friend goatherd, so  pray lead on. Here, take a drink from my flask first.\"    The old man accepted the proffered drink, and then said--    \"Well, signor, it is a desperate and dangerous undertaking; but I know  you English can do almost any thing, so I will show you the way. And if  it comes to a fight, I shall be at your elbow, signor.\"    \"True.\"    Without mentioning his intentions, or saying a word to any of his  friends, the detective passed his arm through that of the goatherd and  walked away.

BEARS AND DACOITS A TALE OF THE GHAUTS        CHAPTER I      A merry party were sitting in the veranda of one of the largest and  handsomest bungalows of Poonah. It belonged to Colonel Hastings, colonel  of a native regiment stationed there, and at present, in virtue of  seniority, commanding a brigade. Tiffin was on, and three or four  officers and four ladies had taken their seats in the comfortable cane  lounging chairs which form the invariable furniture of the veranda of  a well ordered bungalow. Permission had been duly asked, and granted  by Mrs. Hastings, and the cheroots had just begun to draw, when Miss  Hastings, a niece of the colonel, who had only arrived the previous week  from England, said: \"Uncle, I am quite disappointed. Mrs. Lyons showed  me the bear she has got tied up in their compound, and it is the most  wretched little thing, not bigger than Rover, papa's retriever, and it's  full grown. I thought bears were great fierce creatures, and this poor  little thing seemed so restless and unhappy that I thought it quite a  shame not to let it go.\"    Colonel Hastings smiled rather grimly.    \"And yet, small and insignificant as that bear is, my dear, it is a  question whether he is not as dangerous an animal to meddle with as a  man eating tiger.\"    \"What, that wretched little bear, uncle?\"    \"Yes, that wretched little bear. Any experienced sportsman will tell you  that hunting those little bears is as dangerous a sport as tiger hunting  on foot, to say nothing of tiger hunting from an elephant's back, in  which there is scarcely any danger whatever. I can speak feelingly about  it, for my career was pretty nearly brought to an end by a bear, just  after I entered the army, some thirty years ago, at a spot within a few  miles from here. I have got the scars on my shoulder and arm still.\"    \"Oh, do tell me all about it,\" Miss Hastings said; and the request being  seconded by the rest of the party, none of whom, with the exception  of Mrs. Hastings, had ever heard the story before--for the colonel was  somewhat chary of relating this special experience--he waited till they  had all drawn up their chairs as close as possible, and then giving two  or three vigorous puffs at his cheroot, began as follows:    \"Thirty years ago, in 1855, things were not so settled in the Deccan as  they are now. There was no idea of insurrection on a large scale, but we  were going through one of those outbreaks of Dacoity which have several  times proved so troublesome. Bands of marauders kept the country in  confusion, pouring down on a village, now carrying off three or four  of the Bombay money lenders, who were then, as now, the curse of the  country; sometimes making an onslaught upon a body of traders; and  occasionally venturing to attack small detachments of troops or isolated  parties of police. They were not very formidable, but they were very  troublesome, and most difficult to catch, for the peasantry regarded  them as patriots, and aided and shielded them in every way. The  headquarters of these gangs of Dacoits were the Ghauts. In the thick  bush and deep valleys and gorges there they could always take refuge,  while sometimes the more daring chiefs converted these detached peaks  and masses of rock, numbers of which you can see as you come up the  Ghaut by railway, into almost impregnable fortresses. Many of these  masses of rock rise as sheer up from the hillside as walls of masonry,  and look at a short distance like ruined castles. Some are absolutely  inaccessible; others can only be scaled by experienced climbers;  and, although possible for the natives with their bare feet, are  impracticable to European troops. Many of these rock fortresses were at  various times the headquarters of famous Dacoit leaders, and unless the  summits happened to be commanded from some higher ground within gunshot  range they were all but impregnable, except by starvation. When driven  to bay, these fellows would fight well.    \"Well, about the time I joined, the Dacoits were unusually troublesome;  the police had a hard time of it, and almost lived in the saddle, and  the cavalry were constantly called up to help them, while detachments of  infantry from the station were under canvas at several places along the  top of the Ghauts to cut the bands off from their strongholds, and to  aid, if necessary, in turning them out of their rock fortresses. The  natives in the valleys at the foot of the Ghauts, who have always been  a semi-independent race, ready to rob whenever they saw a chance,  were great friends with the Dacoits and supplied them with provisions  whenever the hunt on the Deccan was too hot to make raids in that  direction.    \"This is a long introduction, you will say, and does not seem to have  much to do with bears; but it is really necessary, as you will see. I  had joined about six months when three companies of the regiment were  ordered to relieve a wing of the 15th, who had been under canvas at a  village some four miles to the north of the point where the line crosses  the top of the Ghauts. There were three white officers, and little  enough to do, except when a party was sent off to assist the police.  We had one or two brushes with the Dacoits, but I was not out on either  occasion. However, there was plenty of shooting, and a good many pigs  about, so we had very good fun. Of course, as a raw hand, I was very hot  for it, and as the others had both passed the enthusiastic age, except  for pig sticking and big game, I could always get away. I was supposed  not to go far from camp, because in the first place, I might be wanted;  and, in the second, because of the Dacoits; and Norworthy, who was in  command, used to impress upon me that I ought not to go beyond the sound  of a bugle. Of course we both knew that if I intended to get any sport  I must go further afoot than this; but I merely used to say 'All  right, sir, I will keep an ear to the camp,' and he on his part never  considered it necessary to ask where the game which appeared on the  table came from. But in point of fact, I never went very far, and  my servant always had instructions which way to send for me if I was  wanted; while, as to the Dacoits, I did not believe in their having the  impudence to come in broad daylight within a mile or two of our camp. I  did not often go down the face of the Ghauts. The shooting was good, and  there were plenty of bears in those days, but it needed a long day for  such an expedition, and in view of the Dacoits who might be scattered  about, was not the sort of thing to be undertaken except with a strong  party. Norworthy had not given any precise orders about it, but I must  admit that he said one day:    \"'Of course you won't be fool enough to think of going down the  Ghauts, Hastings?' But I did not look at that as equivalent to a direct  order--whatever I should do now,\" the colonel put in, on seeing a  furtive smile on the faces of his male listeners.    \"However, I never meant to go down, though I used to stand on the edge  and look longingly down into the bush and fancy I saw bears moving about  in scores. But I don't think I should have gone into their country if  they had not come into mine. One day the fellow who always carried my  spare gun or flask, and who was a sort of shikaree in a small way, told  me he had heard that a farmer whose house stood near the edge of the  Ghauts, some two miles away, had been seriously annoyed by his fruit and  corn being stolen by bears.    \"'I'll go and have a look at the place tomorrow,' I said; 'there is no  parade, and I can start early. You may as well tell the mess cook to put  up a basket with some tiffin and a bottle of claret, and get a boy to  carry it over.'    \"'The bears not come in day,' Rahman said.    \"'Of course not,' I replied; 'still I may like to find out which way  they come. Just do as you are told.'    \"The next morning, at seven o'clock, I was at the farmer's spoken of,  and there was no mistake as to the bears. A patch of Indian corn had  been ruined by them, and two dogs had been killed. The native was in a  terrible state of rage and alarm. He said that on moonlight nights he  had seen eight of them, and they came and sniffed around the door of the  cottage.    \"'Why don't you fire through the window at them?' I asked scornfully,  for I had seen a score of tame bears in captivity, and, like you, Mary,  was inclined to despise them, though there was far less excuse for me;  for I had heard stories which should have convinced me that, small as  he is, the Indian bear is not a beast to be attacked with impunity. Upon  walking to the edge of the Ghauts there was no difficulty in discovering  the route by which the bears came up to the farm. For a mile to the  right and left the ground fell away as if cut with a knife, leaving a  precipice of over a hundred feet sheer down; but close by where I was  standing was the head of a water course, which in time had gradually  worn a sort of cleft in the wall, up or down which it was not difficult  to make one's way. Further down this little gorge widened out and became  a deep ravine, and further still a wide valley, where it opened upon the  flats far below us. About half a mile down, where the ravine was deepest  and "]]]
