Indeed, Kropotkin instances the old volunteers  in Great Britain as an example of a movement  on Anarchist lines.[52] Even if a predatory army were  not formed from within, it might easily come from a  neighboring nation, or from races on the borderland  of civilization. So long as the love of power exists,  I do not see how it can be prevented from finding an  outlet in oppression except by means of the organized  force of the community.      [50] On this subject there is an excellent discussion in the  before-mentioned work of Monsieur Naquet.    [51] ``As to the third--the chief--objection, which maintains  the necessity of a government for punishing those who break the  law of society, there is so much to say about it that it hardly can  be touched incidentally. The more we study the question, the  more we are brought to the conclusion that society itself is  responsible for the anti-social deeds perpetrated in its midst, and  that no punishment, no prisons, and no hangmen can diminish  the numbers of such deeds; nothing short of a reorganization of  society itself. Three-quarters of all the acts which are brought  every year before our courts have their origin, either directly or  indirectly, in the present disorganized state of society with  regard to the production and distribution of wealth--not in the  perversity of human nature. As to the relatively few anti-social  deeds which result from anti-social inclinations of separate  individuals, it is not by prisons, nor even by resorting to the  hangmen, that we can diminish their numbers. By our prisons,  we merely multiply them and render them worse. By our detectives,  our `price of blood,' our executions, and our jails, we  spread in society such a terrible flow of basest passions and  habits, that he who should realize the effects of these institutions  to their full extent, would be frightened by what society is  doing under the pretext of maintaining morality. We must  search for other remedies, and the remedies have been indicated  long since.'' Kropotkin, ``Anarchist Communism,'' pp. 31-32.    [52] ``Anarchist Communism,'' p. 27.      The conclusion, which appears to be forced upon  us, is that the Anarchist ideal of a community in  which no acts are forbidden by law is not, at any  rate for the present, compatible with the stability of  such a world as the Anarchists desire. In order to  obtain and preserve a world resembling as closely  as possible that at which they aim, it will still be  necessary that some acts should be forbidden by  law. We may put the chief of these under three  heads:    1. Theft.    2. Crimes of violence.    3. The creation of organizations intended to subvert  the Anarchist regime by force.    We will briefly recapitulate what has been said  already as to the necessity of these prohibitions.    1. Theft.--It is true that in an Anarchist world  there will be no destitution, and therefore no thefts  motivated by starvation. But such thefts are at present  by no means the most considerable or the most  harmful. The system of rationing, which is to be  applied to luxuries, will leave many men with fewer  luxuries than they might desire. It will give  opportunities for peculation by those who are in control  of the public stores, and it will leave the possibility of  appropriating such valuable objects of art as would  naturally be preserved in public museums. It may  be contended that such forms of theft would be prevented  by public opinion. But public opinion is not  greatly operative upon an individual unless it is the  opinion of his own group. A group of men combined  for purposes of theft might readily defy the public  opinion of the majority unless that public opinion  made itself effective by the use of force against them.  Probably, in fact, such force would be applied  through popular indignation, but in that case we  should revive the evils of the criminal law with the  added evils of uncertainty, haste and passion, which  are inseparable from the practice of lynching. If,  as we have suggested, it were found necessary to provide  an economic stimulus to work by allowing fewer  luxuries to idlers, this would afford a new motive for  theft on their part and a new necessity for some form  of criminal law.    2. Crimes of Violence.--Cruelty to children,  crimes of jealousy, rape, and so forth, are almost  certain to occur in any society to some extent. The  prevention of such acts is essential to the existence  of freedom for the weak. If nothing were done to  hinder them, it is to be feared that the customs of a  society would gradually become rougher, and that  acts which are now rare would cease to be so. If  Anarchists are right in maintaining that the existence  of such an economic system as they desire would  prevent the commission of crimes of this kind, the  laws forbidding them would no longer come into  operation, and would do no harm to liberty. If, on  the other hand, the impulse to such actions persisted,  it would be necessary that steps should be taken to  restrain men from indulging it.    3. The third class of difficulties is much the most  serious and involves much the most drastic interference  with liberty. I do not see how a private army  could be tolerated within an Anarchist community,  and I do not see how it could be prevented except by  a general prohibition of carrying arms. If there  were no such prohibition, rival parties would organize  rival forces, and civil war would result. Yet, if there  is such a prohibition, it cannot well be carried out  without a very considerable interference with individual  liberty. No doubt, after a time, the idea of  using violence to achieve a political object might die  down, as the practice of duelling has done. But such  changes of habit and outlook are facilitated by legal  prohibition, and would hardly come about without  it. I shall not speak yet of the international aspect  of this same problem, for I propose to deal with that  in the next chapter, but it is clear that the same  considerations apply with even greater force to the  relations between nations.    If we admit, however reluctantly, that a criminal  law is necessary and that the force of the community  must be brought to bear to prevent certain kinds of  actions, a further question arises: How is crime to be  treated? What is the greatest measure of humanity  and respect for freedom that is compatible with the  recognition of such a thing as crime? The first thing  to recognize is that the whole conception of guilt or  sin should be utterly swept away. At present, the  criminal is visited with the displeasure of the community:  the sole method applied to prevent the occurrence  of crime is the infliction of pain upon the  criminal. Everything possible is done to break his  spirit and destroy his self-respect. Even those  pleasures which would be most likely to have a civilizing  effect are forbidden to him, merely on the ground  that they are pleasures, while much of the suffering  inflicted is of a kind which can only brutalize and  degrade still further. I am not speaking, of course,  of those few penal institutions which have made a  serious study of reforming the criminal. Such  institutions, especially in America, have been proved  capable of achieving the most remarkable results, but  they remain everywhere exceptional. The broad rule  is still that the criminal is made to feel the displeasure  of society. He must emerge from such a treatment  either defiant and hostile, or submissive and cringing,  with a broken spirit and a loss of self-respect.  Neither of these results is anything but evil. Nor  can any good result be achieved by a method of treatment  which embodies reprobation.    When a man is suffering from an infectious disease  he is a danger to the community, and it is necessary  to restrict his liberty of movement. But no one  associates any idea of guilt with such a situation.  On the contrary, he is an object of commiseration to  his friends. Such steps as science recommends are  taken to cure him of his disease, and he submits as  a rule without reluctance to the curtailment of liberty  involved meanwhile. The same method in spirit ought  to be shown in the treatment of what is called  ``crime.'' It is supposed, of course, that the criminal  is actuated by calculations of self-interest, and  that the fear of punishment, by supplying a contrary  motive of self-interest affords the best deterrent,       The dog, to gain some private end,            Went mad and bit the man.    This is the popular view of crime; yet no dog goes  mad from choice, and probably the same is true of the  great majority of criminals, certainly in the case  of crimes of passion. Even in cases where self-interest  is the motive, the important thing is to prevent  the crime, not to make the criminal suffer. Any  suffering which may be entailed by the process of  prevention ought to be regarded as regrettable, like the  pain involved in a surgical operation. The man who  commits a crime from an impulse to violence ought  to be subjected to a scientific psychological treatment,  designed to elicit more beneficial impulses. The  man who commits a crime from calculations of self-  interest ought to be made to feel that self-interest  itself, when it is fully understood, can be better served  by a life which is useful to the community than by one  which is harmful. For this purpose it is chiefly necessary  to widen his outlook and increase the scope of his  desires. At present, when a man suffers from insufficient  love for his fellow-creatures, the method of  curing him which is commonly adopted seems scarcely  designed to succeed, being, indeed,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6927"],[0,"The White Feather (#20)"],[1,"n,\" said Sheen.    \"But, bless me! you'd have made babies of them. What was the instructor  doing? Couldn't he see that you were good?\"    \"I didn't get a chance of showing what I could do.\" He explained the  difficulties of the situation.    Mr Bevan nodded his head thoughtfully.    \"So naturally,\" concluded Sheen, \"the thing has put me out a bit. It's  beastly having nothing to work for. I'm at a loose end. Up till now,  I've always had the thought of the House Competition to keep me going.  But now--well, you see how it is. It's like running to catch a train,  and then finding suddenly that you've got plenty of time. There doesn't  seem any point in going on running.\"    \"Why not Aldershot, sir? said Mr Bevan.    \"What!\" cried Sheen.    The absolute novelty of the idea, and the gorgeous possibilities of it,  made him tingle from head to foot. Aldershot! Why hadn't he thought of  it before! The House Competition suddenly lost its importance in his  eyes. It was a trivial affair, after all, compared with Aldershot, that  Mecca of the public-school boxer.    Then the glow began to fade. Doubts crept in. He might have learned a  good deal from Joe Bevan, but had he learned enough to be able to hold  his own with the best boxers of all the public schools in the country?  And if he had the skill to win, had he the heart? Joe Bevan had said  that he would not disgrace himself again, and he felt that the chances  were against his doing so, but there was the terrible possibility. He  had stood up to Francis and the others, and he had taken their blows  without flinching; but in these encounters there was always at the back  of his mind the comforting feeling that there was a limit to the amount  of punishment he would receive. If Francis happened to drive him into a  corner where he could neither attack, nor defend himself against  attack, he did not use his advantage to the full. He indicated rather  than used it. A couple of blows, and he moved out into the open again.  But in the Public Schools Competition at Aldershot there would be no  quarter. There would be nothing but deadly earnest. If he allowed  himself to be manoeuvred into an awkward position, only his own skill,  or the call of time, could extricate him from it.    In a word, at the \"Blue Boar\" he sparred. At Aldershot he would have to  fight. Was he capable of fighting?    Then there was another difficulty. How was he to get himself appointed  as the Wrykyn light-weight representative? Now that Drummond was unable  to box, Stanning would go down, as the winner of the School  Competition. These things were worked by an automatic process. Sheen  felt that he could beat Stanning, but he had no means of publishing  this fact to the school. He could not challenge him to a trial of  skill. That sort of thing was not done.    He explained this to Joe Bevan.    \"Well, it's a pity,\" said Joe regretfully. \"It's a pity.\"    At this moment Jack Bruce appeared.    \"What's a pity, Joe?\" he asked.    \"Joe wants me to go to Aldershot as a light-weight,\" explained Sheen,  \"and I was just saying that I couldn't, because of Stanning.\"    \"What about Stanning?\"    \"He won the School Competition, you see, so they're bound to send him  down.\"    \"Half a minute,\" said Jack Bruce. \"I never thought of Aldershot for you  before. It's a jolly good idea. I believe you'd have a chance. And it's  all right about Stanning. He's not going down. Haven't you heard?\"    \"I don't hear anything. Why isn't he going down?\"    \"He's knocked up one of his wrists. So he says.\"    \"How do you mean--so he says?\" asked Sheen.    \"I believe he funks it.\"    \"Why? What makes you think that?\"    \"Oh, I don't know. It's only my opinion. Still, it's a little queer.  Stanning says he crocked his left wrist in the final of the House  Competition.\"    \"Well, what's wrong with that? Why shouldn't he have done so?\"    Sheen objected strongly to Stanning, but he had the elements of justice  in him, and he was not going to condemn him on insufficient evidence,  particularly of a crime of which he himself had been guilty.    \"Of course he may have done,\" said Bruce. \"But it's a bit fishy that he  should have been playing fives all right two days running just after  the competition.\"    \"He might have crocked himself then.\"    \"Then why didn't he say so?\"    A question which Sheen found himself unable to answer.    \"Then there's nothing to prevent you fighting, sir,\" said Joe Bevan,  who had been listening attentively to the conversation.    \"Do you really think I've got a chance?\"    \"I do, sir.\"    \"Of course you have,\" said Jack Bruce. \"You're quite as good as  Drummond was, last time I saw him box.\"    \"Then I'll have a shot at it,\" said Sheen.    \"Good for you, sir,\" cried Joe Bevan.    \"Though it'll be a bit of a job getting leave,\" said Sheen. \"How would  you start about it, Bruce?\"    \"You'd better ask Spence. He's the man to go to.\"    \"That's all right. I'm rather a pal of Spence's.\"    \"Ask him tonight after prep.,\" suggested Bruce.    \"And then you can come here regular,\" said Joe Bevan, \"and we'll train  you till you're that fit you could eat bricks, and you'll make babies  of them up at Aldershot.\"          XIX    PAVING THE WAY      Bruce had been perfectly correct in his suspicions. Stanning's wrist  was no more sprained than his ankle. The advisability of manufacturing  an injury had come home to him very vividly on the Saturday morning  following the Ripton match, when he had read the brief report of that  painful episode in that week's number of the _Field_ in the school  library. In the list of the Ripton team appeared the name R. Peteiro.  He had heard a great deal about the dusky Riptonian when Drummond had  beaten him in the Feather-Weights the year before. Drummond had  returned from Aldershot on that occasion cheerful, but in an extremely  battered condition. His appearance as he limped about the field on  Sports Day had been heroic, and, in addition, a fine advertisement for  the punishing powers of the Ripton champion. It is true that at least  one of his injuries had been the work of a Pauline whom he had met in  the opening bout; but the great majority were presents from Ripton, and  Drummond had described the dusky one, in no uncertain terms, as a holy  terror.    These things had sunk into Stanning's mind. It had been generally  understood at Wrykyn that Peteiro had left school at Christmas. When  Stanning, through his study of the _Field_, discovered that the  redoubtable boxer had been one of the team against which he had played  at Ripton, and realised that, owing to Drummond's illness, it would  fall to him, if he won the House Competition, to meet this man of wrath  at Aldershot, he resolved on the instant that the most persuasive of  wild horses should not draw him to that military centre on the day of  the Public Schools Competition. The difficulty was that he particularly  wished to win the House Cup. Then it occurred to him that he could  combine the two things--win the competition and get injured while doing  so.    Accordingly, two days after the House Boxing he was observed to issue  from Appleby's with his left arm slung in a first fifteen scarf. He was  too astute to injure his right wrist. What happens to one's left wrist  at school is one's own private business. When one injures one's right  arm, and so incapacitates oneself for form work, the authorities begin  to make awkward investigations.    Mr Spence, who looked after the school's efforts to win medals at  Aldershot, was the most disappointed person in the place. He was an  enthusiastic boxer--he had represented Cambridge in the Middle-Weights  in his day--and with no small trouble had succeeded in making boxing a  going concern at Wrykyn. Years of failure had ended, the Easter before,  in a huge triumph, when O'Hara, of Dexter's and Drummond had won silver  medals, and Moriarty, of Dexter's, a bronze. If only somebody could win  a medal this year, the tradition would be established, and would not  soon die out. Unfortunately, there was not a great deal of boxing  talent in the school just now. The rule that the winner at his weight  in the House Competitions should represent the school at Aldershot only  applied if the winner were fairly proficient. Mr Spence exercised his  discretion. It was no use sending down novices to be massacred. This  year Drummond and Stanning were the only Wrykinians up to Aldershot  form. Drummond would have been almost a certainty for a silver medal,  and Stanning would probably have been a runner-up. And here they were,  both injured; Wrykyn would not have a single representative at the  Queen's Avenue Gymnasium. It would be a set-back to the cult of boxing  at the school.    Mr Spence was pondering over this unfortunate state of things when  Sheen was shown in.    \"Can I speak to you for a minute, sir?\" said Sheen.    \"Certainly, Sheen. Take one of those cig--I mean, sit down. What is  it?\"    Sheen had decided how to open the interview before knocking at the  door. He came to the point at once.    \"Do you think I could go down to Aldershot, sir?\" he asked.    Mr Spence looked surprised.    \"Go down? You mean--? Do you want to watch the competition? Really, I  don't know if the headmaster--\"    \"I mean, can I box?\"    Mr Spence's look of surprise became more marked.    \"Box?\" he said. \"But surely--I didn't know you were a boxer, Sheen.\"    \"I've only taken it up lately.\"    \"But you didn't enter for the House Competitions, did you? What weight  are you?\"    \"Just under ten stone.\"    \"A light-weight. Why, Linton boxed for your house in the Light-Weights  surely?\"    \"Yes sir. They wouldn't let me go in.\"    \"You hurt yourself?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Then why wouldn't they let you go in?\"    \"Drummond thought Linton was better. He didn't know I boxed.\"    \"But--this is very curious. I don't understand it at all. You see, if  you were not up to House form, you would hardly--At"]]]
