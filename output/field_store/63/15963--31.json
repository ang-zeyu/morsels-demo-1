[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6932"],[0,"Pictures Every Child Should Know (#20)"],[1," Holbein designed a table, on which he pictured an  allegory of \"St. Nobody.\" This was very likely such work as our  cartoonists do to-day, but being the work of Holbein, it had great  artistic value. Besides that, he painted a schoolmaster's sign to be  hung outside the door.    As an illustrator, Holbein made the acquaintance of several authors  about that time and started on the high road to fame. He was a man of  very little conscience or fine feeling, and there could hardly be a  greater contrast than that between the clean sweet life of Duerer and  the brawling, unfeeling one that Hans Holbein led.    Duerer married, had no children, but tenderly loved and cared for his  wife, taking her with him upon his journeys and making her happy.    Holbein married and beat his wife; had several children and took care  of none of them. His wife grew to look old and worn while he remained  a gay looking sport, quite tired of one whom he had had on his hands  for ten years. He wandered everywhere and left his family to shift for  itself. One writer in speaking of the two men says:    \"Duerer would never have deserted his wife whom he took with him even  on his journey to the Netherlands; and he was bound by the same  tenderness to his native town. However much he rejoiced to receive a  visit from Bellini at Venice, or when at Antwerp, the artists  instituted, a torch-light procession in his honour, nothing could have  moved him to leave Nuremberg.\" Duerer loved his home; Holbein hated  his.    Holbein had a cold, light-blue eye; Duerer a soft and tender  glance. While Duerer lived he was the mainstay of his family--father  and brothers. Holbein's father died in misery and his brother's life  was disastrous, Hans doing nothing to serve them and looking on at  their sufferings indifferently.    There is a court document in existence which tells the particulars of  Hans Holbein's arrest for getting into a brawl with a lot of  goldsmiths' apprentices during a night of carousal. The court warned  him that he would be more severely punished if he did not cease his  lawless life and he was made to promise not to \"jostle, pinch, nor  beat his lawful spouse.\" When he died he made no provision in his will  for his family. There is a picture of his wife, Elizabeth Schmidt, to  be seen in his \"Madonna\" at Solothurn Holbein used her for the  model. She then was young and blooming and the model for the child was  his own baby; at that time he found them useful.    His life of folly can hardly be excused by impulsiveness or emotion,  for his pictures show little of either. He was best at portrait  painting. At that time guilds and town councils wanted the portraits  of their members preserved in some way, and it was the habit of  painters like Holbein to form picturesque groups and give to such  dramatic groupings the features of townsmen. Rembrandt did this much  later than Holbein, when he painted the \"Night Watch,\" or as it is  more properly called, \"The Sortie.\"    Probably Holbein's first important work was to make title pages for  the second edition of Martin Luther's translation of the New  Testament. This MS. was made about the time that Holbein's work began  to be of interest to the public, and so the commission was given to  him.    After a time this artist went to England with letters of introduction  to Sir Thomas More, Chancellor to King Henry VIII. Sir Thomas treated  him very kindly and set him to work making portraits of his own  family. During the time he was living at More's home in Chelsea, the  King himself, used frequently to visit there, and on one occasion he  saw the brilliant portraits of the More family and inquired about the  artist. Sir Thomas offered the King any of the pictures he liked, but  Henry VIII. asked to see the artist. When brought before him,  Holbein's fortune seemed to be made for the King asked him to go to  court and paint for him, remarking that \"now he had the artist he did  not care about the pictures.\"    Holbein seems to have been a favourite with Henry and many anecdotes  are told of his life at Whitehall, where he went to live. Once while  Holbein was engaged upon a portrait, a nobleman insisted upon entering  his studio, after the artist had told him that he was painting the  portrait of a lady, by order of the King. The nobleman insisted upon  seeing it, but Holbein seized him and threw him down the Stairs; then  he rushed to the King and told what had happened. He had no sooner  finished than the nobleman appeared and told his story. The King  blamed the nobleman for his rudeness.    \"You have not to do with Holbein,\" he said, \"but with me. I tell you,  of seven peasants I can make seven lords, but of seven lords I cannot  make one Holbein. Begone! and remember that if you ever attempt to  avenge yourself, I shall look upon any injury offered to the painter  as done to myself.\"    It was Holbein who, visiting a brother artist and finding a picture on  the easel, painted a fly upon it. When the artist returned he tried to  brush the fly off, then set about looking for the one who had deceived  him.    His portrait painting was so superb that he received many commissions.    Meantime, Sir Thomas More had fallen into disfavour with the King and  was to lose his head, but it is written that the artist's portraits  \"betray nothing of this tragedy.\" He was as ready to climb to fame by  the favour of his generous patron's enemies as he had been to accept  the offices of Sir Thomas More. He painted the portraits of several of  the wives of Henry VIII., and it may be said that there was a good  deal of that monarch's temperament to be found in Holbein  himself. Take him all in all, Hans was as detestable as a man as he  was excellent as a painter.    In his adopted home in Lucerne, Holbein had painted frescoes, both on  the inside and the outside of a citizen's house, and this house stood  until 1824, when it was torn down to make way for street improvements,  but several artists hastily copied the frescoes so that they are not  entirely lost.    Before he left Germany for England, Holbein had been commissioned to  decorate the town hall in Basel, and a certain amount of money was  voted for the work, but after he had finished three walls, he decided  that the money was only enough to pay him for what he had already  done. The councillors agreed with him, but as money was a little  \"close\" in Basel at that time, they felt unable to give him more, and  so voted to \"let the back wall alone, till further notice.\"    He painted one Madonna whom he surrounded with the entire family of  Burgomaster Meyer, including even the burgomaster's first wife, who  was dead. This work is called the \"Meyer Madonna.\"    It is said that after Holbein's return to Basel he, with others, was  persecuted for his \"religious principles,\" but if this were true, his  persecutors went to considerable pains for nothing, because Holbein  was never known to have any sort of principles, religious or  otherwise. He was neither a Protestant, nor a Catholic but a painter,  a man without convictions and without thought. He did not care for  family, country, friends, politics, religion, nor for anything else,  so far as any one knows.    When he was asked why he had not partaken of the Sacrament, he  answered that he wanted to understand the matter better before he did  so. Thus he escaped punishment, and when matters were explained to  him, he did whatever seemed safest and most convenient under the  circumstances.    On his return to England, he settled among the colony of German and  Netherland merchants, who were in the habit of meeting at a place  called \"The Steelyard,\" as their home and warehouses were grouped in  that locality, with a guild hall and a wineshop they alone patronised.    While associated with his compatriots Holbein made portraits of many  of them, and these are magnificent works of art. He painted them  separately or in groups; in their offices and in their guild hall, as  the case might be. The men whom he thus painted were: Gorg Gisze, Hans  of Antwerp, Derich Berck, Geryck Tybis, Ambrose Fallen, and many  others. He designed the arch which the guild erected upon the occasion  of Anne Boleyn's coronation, and he painted Henry's next Queen, Jane  Seymour.    Holbein painted many portraits of Henry VIII. and probably all those  dated after 1537 were either copies or founded upon the portrait which  Holbein made and which was destroyed with Whitehall.    While he painted for Henry, Holbein received a sort of retainer's fee  of thirty pounds a year, but he may have received sums for outside  commissions which he undertook. On one occasion, when he took a  journey to Upper Burgundy to paint a portrait of the Duchess whom  Henry contemplated making his next wife, the King gave him ten pounds  out of his own purse. We have no record of vast sums such as Raphael  received.    Henry did not succeed in making the Duchess his wife, so Holbein was  sent to paint another--Anne of Cleves--that Henry might see what he  thought of her before he undertook to make her his queen. Holbein did  a disastrous deed, for he made Anne a very acceptable looking woman,  (the portrait hangs in the Louvre) and Henry negotiated for her on the  strength of that portrait. Later, when he saw her, he was utterly  disgusted and disappointed.    Holbein, notwithstanding this trick, was employed to paint the next  wife of Henry, and doubtless he also made the miniature of Catherine  Howard which is in Windsor Castle. Holbein finally died of the plague  and no one knows where he was buried. His wife died later, and it was  left for his son, Philip, who was said to be \"a good well-behaved  lad,\" to bring honours to the family. He was apprenticed in Paris,  and, settling later in Augsburg, he founded a branch of the Holbein  family on which the Emperor Matthias conferred a patent of nobility,  making them the Holbeins of Holbeinsberg.

[6]    [6] \"I'ay commencÃ© Ã  appeller quelques enfans auec vne petite clochette.  La premiere fois i'en auois six, puis douze, puis quinze, puis vingt et  davantage; ie leur fais dire le Pater, Aue, et Credo, etc. ... Nous  finissons par le Pater Noster, que i'ay composÃ© quasi en rimes en leur  langue, que ie leur fais chanter: et pour derniere conclusion, ie leur  fais donner chacun vne escuellÃ©e de pois, qu'ils mangent de bon  appetit,\" etc.--Le Jeune, Relation, 1633, 23.    It was the end of May, when the priests one morning heard the sound of  cannon from the fort, and were gladdened by the tidings that Samuel de  Champlain had arrived to resume command at Quebec, bringing with him  four more Jesuits,--BrÃ©beuf, Masse, Daniel, and Davost. [7] BrÃ©beuf,  from the first, turned his eyes towards the distant land of the  Hurons,--a field of labor full of peril, but rich in hope and promise.  Le Jeune's duties as Superior restrained him from wanderings so remote.  His apostleship must be limited, for a time, to the vagabond hordes of  Algonquins, who roamed the forests of the lower St. Lawrence, and of  whose language he had been so sedulous a student. His difficulties had  of late been increased by the absence of Pierre, who had run off as Lent  drew near, standing in dread of that season of fasting. Masse brought  tidings of him from Tadoussac, whither he had gone, and where a party of  English had given him liquor, destroying the last trace of Le Jeune's  late exhortations. \"God forgive those,\" writes the Father, \"who  introduced heresy into this country! If this savage, corrupted as he is  by these miserable heretics, had any wit, he would be a great hindrance  to the spread of the Faith. It is plain that he was given us, not for  the good of his soul, but only that we might extract from him the  principles of his language.\" [8]    [7] See \"Pioneers of France.\"  [8] Relation, 1633, 29.    Pierre had two brothers. One, well known as a hunter, was named  Mestigoit; the other was the most noted \"medicine-man,\" or, as the  Jesuits called him, sorcerer, in the tribe of the Montagnais. Like the  rest of their people, they were accustomed to set out for their winter  hunt in the autumn, after the close of their eel-fishery. Le Jeune,  despite the experience of De NouÃ«, had long had a mind to accompany one  of these roving bands, partly in the hope, that, in some hour of  distress, he might touch their hearts, or, by a timely drop of baptismal  water, dismiss some dying child to paradise, but chiefly with the object  of mastering their language. Pierre had rejoined his brothers; and, as  the hunting season drew near, they all begged the missionary to make one  of their party,--not, as he thought, out of any love for him, but solely  with a view to the provisions with which they doubted not he would be  well supplied. Le Jeune, distrustful of the sorcerer, demurred, but at  length resolved to go.          CHAPTER IV.  1633, 1634.    LE JEUNE AND THE HUNTERS.    Le Jeune joins the Indians â¢ The First Encampment â¢ The Apostate â¢  Forest Life in Winter â¢ The Indian Hut â¢ The Sorcerer â¢ His Persecution  of the Priest â¢ Evil Company â¢ Magic â¢ Incantations â¢ Christmas â¢  Starvation â¢ Hopes of Conversion â¢ Backsliding â¢ Peril and Escape of Le  Jeune â¢ His Return    On a morning in the latter part of October, Le Jeune embarked with the  Indians, twenty in all, men, women, and children. No other Frenchman was  of the party. Champlain bade him an anxious farewell, and commended him  to the care of his red associates, who had taken charge of his store of  biscuit, flour, corn, prunes, and turnips, to which, in an evil hour,  his friends had persuaded him to add a small keg of wine. The canoes  glided along the wooded shore of the Island of Orleans, and the party  landed, towards evening, on the small island immediately below. Le Jeune  was delighted with the spot, and the wild beauties of the autumnal  sunset.    His reflections, however, were soon interrupted. While the squaws were  setting up their bark lodges, and Mestigoit was shooting wild-fowl for  supper, Pierre returned to the canoes, tapped the keg of wine, and soon  fell into the mud, helplessly drunk. Revived by the immersion, he next  appeared at the camp, foaming at the mouth, threw down the lodges,  overset the kettle, and chased the shrieking squaws into the woods. His  brother Mestigoit rekindled the fire, and slung the kettle anew; when  Pierre, who meanwhile had been raving like a madman along the shore,  reeled in a fury to the spot to repeat his former exploit. Mestigoit  anticipated him, snatched the kettle from the fire, and threw the  scalding contents in his face. \"He was never so well washed before in  his life,\" says Le Jeune; \"he lost all the skin of his face and breast.  Would to God his heart had changed also!\" [1] He roared in his frenzy  for a hatchet to kill the missionary, who therefore thought it prudent  to spend the night in the neighboring woods. Here he stretched himself  on the earth, while a charitable squaw covered him with a sheet of  birch-bark. \"Though my bed,\" he writes, \"had not been made up since the  creation of the world, it was not hard enough to prevent me from  sleeping.\"    [1] \"Iamais il ne fut si bien lauÃ©, il changea de peau en la face et en  tout l'estomach: pleust Ã  Dieu que son ame eust changÃ© aussi bien que  son corps!\"--Relation, 1634, 59.    Such was his initiation into Indian winter life. Passing over numerous  adventures by water and land, we find the party, on the twelfth of  November, leaving their canoes on an island, and wading ashore at low  tide over the flats to the southern bank of the St. Lawrence. As two  other bands had joined them, their number was increased to forty-five  persons. Now, leaving the river behind, they entered those savage  highlands whence issue the springs of the St. John,--a wilderness of  rugged mountain-ranges, clad in dense, continuous forests, with no human  tenant but this troop of miserable rovers, and here and there some  kindred band, as miserable as they. Winter had set in, and already dead  Nature was sheeted in funereal white. Lakes and ponds were frozen,  rivulets sealed up, torrents encased with stalactites of ice; the black  rocks and the black trunks of the pine-trees were beplastered with snow,  and its heavy masses crushed the dull green boughs into the drifts  beneath. The forest was silent as the grave.    Through this desolation the long file of Indians made its way, all on  snow-shoes, each man, woman, and child bending under a heavy load, or  dragging a sledge, narrow, but of prodigious length. They carried their  whole wealth with them, on their backs or on their sledges,--kettles,  axes, bales of meat, if such they had, and huge rolls of birch-bark for  covering their wigwams. The Jesuit was loaded like the rest. The dogs  alone floundered through the drifts unburdened. There was neither path  nor level ground. Descending, climbing, stooping beneath half-fallen  trees, clambering over piles of prostrate trunks, struggling through  matted cedar-swamps, threading chill ravines, and crossing streams no  longer visible, they toiled on till the day began to decline, then  stopped to encamp. [2] Burdens were thrown down, and sledges unladen.  The squaws, with knives and hatchets, cut long poles of birch and spruce  saplings; while the men, with snow-shoes for shovels, cleared a round or  square space in the snow, which formed an upright wall three or four  feet high, inclosing the area of the wigwam. On one side, a passage was  cut for an entrance, and the poles were planted around the top of the  wall of snow, sloping and converging. On these poles were spread the  sheets of birch-bark; a bear-skin was hung in the passage-way for a  door; the bare ground within and the surrounding snow were covered with  spruce boughs; and the work was done.    [2] \"S'il arriuoit quelque dÃ©gel, Ã´ Dieu quelle peine! Il me sembloit  que ie marchois sur vn chemin de verre qui se cassoit Ã  tous coups soubs  mes pieds: la neige congelÃ©e venant Ã  s'amollir, tomboit et s'enfonÃ§oit  par esquarres ou grandes pieces, et nous en auions bien souuent iusques  aux genoux, quelquefois iusqu'Ã  la ceinture  Que s'il y auoit de la  peine Ã  tomber, il y en auoit encor plus Ã  se retirer: car nos raquettes  se chargeoient de neiges et se rendoient si pesantes, que quand vous  veniez Ã  les retirer il vous sembloit qu'on vous tiroit les iambes pour  vous dÃ©membrer. I'en ay veu qui glissoient tellement soubs des souches  enseuelies soubs la neige, qu'ils ne pouuoient tirer ny iambes ny  raquettes sans secours: or figurez vous maintenant vne personne chargÃ©e  comme vn mulet, et iugez si la vie des Sauuages est douce.\"--Relation,  1634, 67.    This usually occupied about three hours, during which Le Jeune, spent  with travel, and weakened by precarious and unaccustomed fare, had the  choice of shivering in idleness, or taking part in a labor which  fatigued, without warming, his exhausted frame. The sorcerer's wife was  in far worse case. Though in the extremity of a mortal sickness, they  left her lying in the snow till the wigwam was made,--without a word, on  her part, of remonstrance or complaint. Le Jeune, to the great ire of  her husband, sometimes spent the interval in trying to convert her; but  she proved intractable, and soon died unbaptized.    Thus lodged, they remained so long as game could be found within a  circuit of ten or twelve miles, and then, subsistence failing, removed  to another spot. Early in the winter, they hunted the beaver and the  Canada porcupine; and, later, in the season of deep snows, chased the  moose and the caribou.    Put aside the bear-skin,"]]]
