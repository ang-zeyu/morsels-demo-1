He tried to turn back, but it was too late, and down he went.    Some heavy bushes broke his fall somewhat, but he continued to go down and  down, until with a dull thud he landed on a mass of soft dirt. He was  unharmed and soon arose to his feet, to gaze around in fresh dismay.    He had landed in an opening or cave, and presently went down into it still  further. Then, as he picked himself up, he heard a sudden low growl, that  filled him with fear. He strained his eyes and made out a small animal,  which proved to be the cub of an ocelot.    He followed its course to a litter of leaves and straining his glance in  that direction made out two other cubs.    They were too small to be dangerous. Plum had told him that there were  very few ocelots in that vicinity and these rather cowardly, unless  attacked or enraged.    Jack looked hurriedly around. The parent ocelot was not in evidence. The  baby cub he had stumbled over, however, was making a great outcry, and our  hero decided he would not linger any longer than was necessary.    He got under the hole he had fallen through. It was not accessible by  climbing, for the walls of the cave were perfectly perpendicular and came  nowhere near the central aperture.    Jack reached up and caught at the dangling end of the broken vine. It  sustained one hard pull, but, as he set his full weight, it tore up roots  and all, bringing down a shower of dirt and gravel.    About eight feet over his head the youth made out an exposed root of the  tree. It ran out of the solid dirt a few inches, looped, and was again  solidly imbedded.    If he could reach this, he could grasp higher pieces of roots that showed  plainly, and easily draw himself to _terra firma_.    Our hero went back to the extreme end of the cave. The young cubs set up  outcries of affright as he passed near them, but he paid no attention to  them.    He braced for a run and a jump to reach the piece of root that was the  bottom rung of a natural ladder to liberty.    Poised on one foot, Jack stood motionless in some dismay. The entrance to  the cave was suddenly darkened. A great heavy body dropped through. The  mother ocelot landed on four feet on the cave floor with a terrific growl.    She ran first to her crying cubs, nosed them affectionately, and then  turned with low, ominous growlings.    Jack saw the beast's eyes fix themselves upon him. They glowed with fire  and fury. Its collar ruffled and its white teeth showed.    Jack had not so much as a stick to defend himself with. He had loaned his  hunting knife to a friend when they first started and his pistol had been  dropped in the woods.    In his pocket was a small pocket knife. He was groping for this when the  ocelot, that had for a minute or two stood perfectly motionless, made a  forward movement.    It was not a spring or a glide, but a rush. Jack knew why they called this  species the Honey Eater. Its paws were enormous and armed with long curved  sharp pointed claws.    He was hedged in. The beast, still advancing, reared on its hind feet.    Its forepaws were extended and whipping the air. Jack knew that one  contact would tear the bark from the toughest tree. He mechanically seized  the first object his groping fingers met in his coat pocket.    It was one of two condiment bottles that he had brought from the last  camp. This was the one containing pepper.    In a desperate sort of a way Jack discovered this. He tore off the top of  the bottle.    It was all that he could do to stay the course of the determined animal.    As the ocelot thrust out one formidable paw to tear its victim into its  clasp, Jack flung the contents of the pepper bottle squarely into its  eyes.          Chapter XXV    In the Quicksands        Jack ducked down and dodged the ocelot, and got past the animal. He could  do this now, for the whole contents of the pepper bottle had gone squarely  into the eyes of the beast.    The effect was indescribable. The animal gave a frightful roar, dropped to  the floor, and, rolling over and over, tore frantically with its paws at  its blinded, smarting eyes.    The cubs, excited and frightened by the uproar, joined in the chorus. They  waddled around, getting in our hero's way, and by their cries arousing the  mother from her own distress.    She got upright, and seemed to spot Jack. Her advance, however, was clumsy  and at fault, and the youth had time to get out of her way.    A second and a third rush she made at him. The last time one paw struck  Jack's coat sleeve and ripped it from place.    \"This is getting serious,\" murmured the lad. \"Each time she comes swifter  and surer. I must get out of here, now or never.\"    Jack drove the cubs to their litter, and poked them with his foot. They  set up a frantic uproar. This was just what he wanted. The mother flew  towards her offspring.    The moment that she did so, Jack glided to the opposite wall of the cave.    He made a sharp run for the opening overhead, calculated poise and  distance nicely, and landed with success.    He grabbed the rounding root. It held like iron, but his feet were  dangling, and as he swayed there the big ocelot brushed by them on the  hunt for the intruder.    Jack held firmly to the root and swung up his other hand. He caught at a  higher tree root. Now he had a double hold.    He knew that the ocelot might come after him even up there, and lost no  time in climbing from root to root. At last his head projected through the  mesh of verdure into clear daylight. Jack lifted himself to solid ground  and leaned against the tree trunk, out of breath and perspiring.    \"That was action,\" he panted. \"Will the beast come after me? No--but  something else may. Oh, the mischief!\"    The roars and growlings down in the cave seemed to have attracted outside  attention. Jack turned sharply, at the sound of crackling branches and  rustling leaves at a densely-verdured spot near at hand.    There burst through the greenery a new enemy. This was an ocelot larger  than the one he had just escaped from.    \"That is the head of the family, sure,\" thought Jack. \"It's a race, now.\"    The new feature in the incident came straight for our hero, with bristling  muzzle and fiery eyes. Jack started down the edge of the ravine.    It crumbled so that he could not make very rapid progress. To turn aside  into the jungle meant to fight his way through thick, thorny bushes. To  leap down into the dry water-course was even worse. There, as he knew, the  spongy, shifting sand bottom would prevent even the progress of a decent  walk.    Jack glanced back over his shoulder. The big ocelot, more sure-footed than  himself, was following him up resolutely.    Jack took the first tree he came to. It was a dead one. There were lower  branches within reach, and he swung himself up to its first crotch  readily. The ocelot did not pause. It started up the tree without delay.  Jack armed himself with a piece of a thick limb. Reaching down, as the  beast got about four feet away, he delivered a smart whack directly across  its snout.    The animal issued a terrific snort. Its eyes blazed madly. A second blow  with the club brought the blood, but it kept on climbing.    Jack knew that it would be folly to tempt to battle at any closer  quarters. He stood on a dead limb about twenty feet from the ground.    The limb was as thick as his arm, and over thirty feet long. It ran clear  across the ravine, and a discovery of this fact gave Jack an idea.    He planned to go out to the far end of the limb, swing from its extremity  and drop to the ground, landing on the ether bank of the cut.    The ocelot could not get hold or balance to venture as far out on the limb  as the lad dared to go. Jack calculated that the time it lost in getting  down to the ground again, would enable him to meantime put a considerable  distance between himself and the enemy.    The lad sat astride the dead tree branch and began to walk himself outward  from the main trunk of the tree.    The ocelot reached the crotch, surveyed Jack with a savage growl, and  carefully planting its feet, started out after him.    Its progress was slow. Jack hitched himself along more rapidly. The branch  began to creak. Our hero doubted if it would sustain their double weight.  However, he trusted to the wary instinct of the ocelot, which kept coming  right forward. Jack was about eight feet from the end of the branch when  it gave a very ominous crack. In fact, he saw the white splinters show  where it joined the tree.    He swung both feet to one side of the limb, held on only by his fingers,  and planned to get to its end hand over hand.    Snap! Jack hurried progress, but it was no use. He saw the ocelot crouch  and hug the limb. It gave way at its base. Jack let go. He landed directly  on the smooth, sandy bottom of that portion of the ravine.    He struck the ground upright, squarely with both feet. Glancing quickly at  the tree, he saw that the branch had whipped right down against the trunk.    The limb had not entirely broken loose, but swayed from several sustaining  wood filaments. The ocelot, still hugging the limb, was clawing  frantically at the main trunk of the tree to get a new hold there to keep  from a tumble.    \"It won't do to stop, I see that,\" murmured Jack. \"Ugh! what kind of a  mushy mess have I got into?\"    Jack looked down at his feet. They had sunk into the sand and were covered  to the ankles. With the greatest difficulty he pulled out one foot.    The instant he put it down again in a new spot, however, it sank afresh.  He released the other. This threw his weight on a single foot, which went  down half way to the knee.    It was not ten feet to the bank of the ravine. Jack lost all interest in  the ocelot as he thrilled at a startling discovery.    \"Quicksand!\" he breathed hastily. \"There is not a moment to lose!\"    Our hero tugged to get the sunken foot free. He succeeded. Then,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7849"],[0,"The Trial (#20)"],[1,"  start developing a long time beforehand, there must have been warning  signs of it, why didn't you write to me?  You know I'd do anything for  you, to some extent I am still your guardian, and until today that's  something I was proud of.  I'll still help you, of course I will, only  now, now that the trial is already underway, it makes it very difficult.  But whatever; the best thing now is for you to take a short holiday  staying with us in the country.  You've lost weight, I can see that now.  The country life will give you strength, that will be good, there's  bound to be a lot of hard work ahead of you.  But besides that it'll be  a way of getting you away from the court, to some extent.  Here they've  got every means of showing the powers at their disposal and they're  automatically bound to use them against you; in the country they'll  either have to delegate authority to different bodies or just have to  try and bother you by letter, telegram or telephone.  And that's bound  to weaken the effect, it won't release you from them but it'll give you  room to breathe.\"  \"You could forbid me to leave,\" said K., who had been  drawn slightly into his uncle's way of thinking by what he had been  saying.  \"I didn't think you would do it,\" said his uncle thoughtfully,  \"you won't suffer too much loss of power by moving away.\"  K. grasped  his uncle under the arm to prevent him stopping still and said, \"I  thought you'd think all this is less important than I do, and now you're  taking it so hard.\"  \"Josef,\" called his uncle trying to disentangle  himself from him so that he could stop walking, but K. did not let go,  \"you've completely changed, you used to be so astute, are you losing it  now?  Do you want to lose the trial?  Do you realise what that would  mean?  That would mean you would be simply destroyed.  And that everyone  you know would be pulled down with you or at the very least humiliated,  disgraced right down to the ground.  Josef, pull yourself together.  The  way you're so indifferent about it, it's driving me mad.  Looking at you  I can almost believe that old saying: 'Having a trial like that means  losing a trial like that'.\"  \"My dear Uncle,\" said K., \"it won't do any  good to get excited, it's no good for you to do it and it'd be no good  for me to do it.  The case won't be won by getting excited, and please  admit that my practical experience counts for something, just as I have  always and still do respect your experience, even when it surprises me.  You say that the family will also be affected by this trial; I really  can't see how, but that's beside the point and I'm quite willing to  follow your instructions in all of this.  Only, I don't see any  advantage in staying in the country, not even for you, as that would  indicate flight and a sense of guilt.  And besides, although I am more  subject to persecution if I stay in the city I can also press the matter  forward better here.\"  \"You're right,\" said his uncle in a tone that  seemed to indicate they were finally coming closer to each other, \"I  just made the suggestion because, as I saw it, if you stay in the city  the case will be put in danger by your indifference to it, and I thought  it was better if I did the work for you.  But will you push things  forward yourself with all your strength, if so, that will naturally be  far better.\"  \"We're agreed then,\" said K.  \"And do you have any  suggestions for what I should do next?\"  \"Well, naturally I'll have to  think about it,\" said his uncle, \"you must bear in mind that I've been  living in the country for twenty years now, almost without a break, you  lose your ability to deal with matters like this.  But I do have some  important connections with several people who, I expect, know their way  around these things better than I do, and to contact them is a matter of  course.  Out there in the country I've been getting out of condition,  I'm sure you're already aware of that.  It's only at times like this  that you notice it yourself.  And this affair of yours came largely  unexpected, although, oddly enough, I had expected something of the sort  after I'd read Erna's letter, and today when I saw your face I knew it  with almost total certainty.  But all that is by the by, the important  thing now is, we have no time to lose.\"  Even while he was still  speaking, K.'s uncle had stood on tiptoe to summon a taxi and now he  pulled K. into the car behind himself as he called out an address to the  driver.  \"We're going now to see Dr. Huld, the lawyer,\" he said, \"we  were at school together.  I'm sure you know the name, don't you?  No?  Well that is odd.  He's got a very good reputation as a defence  barrister and for working with the poor.  But I esteem him especially as  someone you can trust.\"  \"It's alright with me, whatever you do,\" said  K., although he was made uneasy by the rushed and urgent way his uncle  was dealing with the matter.  It was not very encouraging, as the  accused, be to taken to a lawyer for poor people.  \"I didn't know,\" he  said, \"that you could take on a lawyer in matters like this.\"  \"Well of  course you can,\" said his uncle, \"that goes without saying.  Why  wouldn't you take on a lawyer?  And now, so that I'm properly instructed  in this matter, tell me what's been happening so far.\"  K. instantly  began telling his uncle about what had been happening, holding nothing  back - being completely open with him was the only way that K. could  protest at his uncle's belief that the trial was a great disgrace.  He  mentioned Miss Buerstner's name just once and in passing, but that did  nothing to diminish his openness about the trial as Miss Buerstner had no  connection with it.  As he spoke, he looked out the window and saw how,  just then, they were getting closer to the suburb where the court  offices were.  He drew this to his uncle's attention, but he did not  find the coincidence especially remarkable.  The taxi stopped in front  of a dark building.  K.'s uncle knocked at the very first door at ground  level; while they waited he smiled, showing his big teeth, and  whispered, \"Eight o'clock; not the usual sort of time to be visiting a  lawyer, but Huld won't mind it from me.\"  Two large, black eyes appeared  in the spy-hatch in the door, they stared at the two visitors for a  while and then disappeared; the door, however, did not open.  K. and his  uncle confirmed to each other the fact that they had seen the two eyes.  \"A new maid, afraid of strangers,\" said K.'s uncle, and knocked again.  The eyes appeared once more.  This time they seemed almost sad, but the  open gas flame that burned with a hiss close above their heads gave off  little light and that may have merely created an illusion.  \"Open the  door,\" called K.'s uncle, raising his fist against it, \"we are friends  of Dr. Huld, the lawyer!\"  \"Dr. Huld is ill,\" whispered someone behind  them.  In a doorway at the far end of a narrow passage stood a man in  his dressing gown, giving them this information in an extremely quiet  voice.  K.'s uncle, who had already been made very angry by the long  wait, turned abruptly round and retorted, \"Ill?  You say he's ill?\" and  strode towards the gentleman in a way that seemed almost threatening, as  if he were the illness himself.  \"They've opened the door for you, now,\"  said the gentleman, pointing at the door of the lawyer.  He pulled his  dressing gown together and disappeared.  The door had indeed been  opened, a young girl - K. recognised the dark, slightly bulging eyes -  stood in the hallway in a long white apron, holding a candle in her  hand.  \"Next time, open up sooner!\" said K.'s uncle instead of a  greeting, while the girl made a slight curtsey. \"Come along, Josef,\" he  then said to K. who was slowly moving over towards the girl. \"Dr. Huld  is unwell,\" said the girl as K.'s uncle, without stopping, rushed  towards one of the doors.  K. continued to look at the girl in amazement  as she turned round to block the way into the living room, she had a  round face like a puppy's, not only the pale cheeks and the chin were  round but the temples and the hairline were too.  \"Josef!\" called his  uncle once more, and he asked the girl, \"It's trouble with his heart, is  it?\"  \"I think it is, sir,\" said the girl, who by now had found time to  go ahead with the candle and open the door into the room. In one corner  of the room, where the light of the candle did not reach, a face with a  long beard looked up from the bed.  \"Leni, who's this coming in?\" asked  the lawyer, unable to recognise his guests because he was dazzled by the  candle.  \"It's your old friend, Albert,\" said K.'s uncle.  \"Oh, Albert,\"  said the lawyer, falling back onto his pillow as if this visit meant he  would not need to keep up appearances.  \"Is it really as bad as that?\"  asked K.'s uncle, sitting on the edge of the bed.  \"I don't believe it  is.  It's a recurrence of your heart trouble and it'll pass over like  the other times.\"  \"Maybe,\" said the lawyer quietly, \"but it's just as  much trouble as it's ever been.  I can hardly breathe, I can't sleep at  all and I'm getting weaker by the day.\"  \"I see,\" said K.'s uncle,  pressing his panama hat firmly against his knee with his big hand.  \"That is bad news.  But are you getting the right sort of care?  And  it's so depressing in here, it's so dark.  It's a long time since I was  last here, but it seemed to me friendlier then.  Even your young lady  here doesn't seem to have much life in her, unless she's just  pretending.\"  The maid was still standing by the door with the candle;  as far as could be made out, she was watching K. more than she was  watching his uncle even while the latter was still speaking about her.  K. leant against a chair that he had pushed near to the girl.  \"When  you're as ill as I am,\" said the lawyer, \"you need to have peace.  I  don't find it depressing.\"  After a short pause he added, \"and Leni  looks after"]]]
