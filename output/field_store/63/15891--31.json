The woman and child ran out to see what all  this meant, and behold! all the gossips of the town were standing around  the public fountain. What could have happened? Oh, a most ridiculous and  extraordinary thing! The children of the richest men in the town, whom  their parents had planned to surprise with the most beautiful presents  had found only switches in their shoes!    Then the old woman and the child thinking of all the riches in their  chimney were filled with fear. But suddenly they saw the priest appear,  his countenance full of astonishment. Just above the bench placed near  the door of the church, in the very spot where, the night before, a  child in a white garment and with bare feet, in spite of the cold, had  rested his lovely head, the priest had found a circlet of gold imbedded  in the old stones.    Then, they all crossed themselves devoutly, perceiving that this  beautiful sleeping child with the carpenter's tools had been Jesus of  Nazareth himself, who had come back for one hour just as he had been  when he used to work in the home of his parents; and reverently they  bowed before this miracle, which the good God had done to reward the  faith and the love of a little child.          XVI. CHRISTMAS IN THE ALLEY*    * From \"Kristy's Queer Christmas,\" Houghton, Mifflin & Co., 1904.    OLIVE THORNE MILLER    \"I declare for 't, to-morrow is Christmas Day an' I clean forgot all  about it,\" said old Ann, the washerwoman, pausing in her work and  holding the flatiron suspended in the air.    \"Much good it'll do us,\" growled a discontented voice from the coarse  bed in the corner.    \"We haven't much extra, to be sure,\" answered Ann cheerfully, bringing  the iron down onto the shirt-bosom before her, \"but at least we've  enough to eat, and a good fire, and that's more'n some have, not a  thousand miles from here either.\"    \"We might have plenty more,\" said the fretful voice, \"if you didn't  think so much more of strangers than you do of your own folk's comfort,  keeping a houseful of beggars, as if you was a lady!\"    \"Now, John,\" replied Ann, taking another iron from the fire, \"you're  not half so bad as you pretend. You wouldn't have me turn them poor  creatures into the streets to freeze, now, would you?\"    \"It's none of our business to pay rent for them,\" grumbled John. \"Every  one for himself, I say, these hard times. If they can't pay you'd ought  to send 'em off; there's plenty as can.\"    \"They'd pay quick enough if they could get work,\" said Ann. \"They're  good honest fellows, every one, and paid me regular as long as they had  a cent. But when hundreds are out o' work in the city, what can they  do?\"    \"That's none o' your business, you can turn 'em out!\" growled John.    \"And leave the poor children to freeze as well as starve?\" said Ann.  \"Who'd ever take 'em in without money, I'd like to know? No, John,\"  bringing her iron down as though she meant it, \"I'm glad I'm well enough  to wash and iron, and pay my rent, and so long as I can do that, and  keep the hunger away from you and the child, I'll never turn the poor  souls out, leastways, not in this freezing winter weather.\"    \"An' here's Christmas,\" the old man went on whiningly, \"an' not a penny  to spend, an' I needin' another blanket so bad, with my rhumatiz, an'  haven't had a drop of tea for I don't know how long!\"    \"I know it,\" said Ann, never mentioning that she too had been without  tea, and not only that, but with small allowance of food of any kind,  \"and I'm desperate sorry I can't get a bit of something for Katey. The  child never missed a little something in her stocking before.\"    \"Yes,\" John struck in, \"much you care for your flesh an' blood. The  child ha'n't had a thing this winter.\"    \"That's true enough,\" said Ann, with a sigh, \"an' it's the hardest thing  of all that I've had to keep her out o' school when she was doing so  beautiful.\"    \"An' her feet all on the ground,\" growled John.    \"I know her shoes is bad,\" said Ann, hanging the shirt up on a line that  stretched across the room, and was already nearly full of freshly ironed  clothes, \"but they're better than the Parker children's.\"    \"What's that to us?\" almost shouted the weak old man, shaking his fist  at her in his rage.    \"Well, keep your temper, old man,\" said Ann. \"I'm sorry it goes so hard  with you, but as long as I can stand on my feet, I sha'n't turn anybody  out to freeze, that's certain.\"    \"How much'll you get for them?\" said the miserable old man, after a few  moments' silence, indicating by his hand the clean clothes on the line.    \"Two dollars,\" said Ann, \"and half of it must go to help make up next  month's rent. I've got a good bit to make up yet, and only a week to do  it in, and I sha'n't have another cent till day after to-morrow.\"    \"Well, I wish you'd manage to buy me a little tea,\" whined the old man;  \"seems as if that would go right to the spot, and warm up my old bones a  bit.\"    \"I'll try,\" said Ann, revolving in her mind how she could save a few  pennies from her indispensable purchases to get tea and sugar, for  without sugar he would not touch it.    Wearied with his unusual exertion, the old man now dropped off to sleep,  and Ann went softly about, folding and piling the clothes into a big  basket already half full. When they were all packed in, and nicely  covered with a piece of clean muslin, she took an old shawl and hood  from a nail in the corner, put them on, blew out the candle, for it must  not burn one moment unnecessarily, and, taking up her basket, went out  into the cold winter night, softly closing the door behind her.    The house was on an alley, but as soon as she turned the corner she was  in the bright streets, glittering with lamps and gay people. The shop  windows were brilliant with Christmas displays, and thousands of warmly  dressed buyers were lingering before them, laughing and chatting, and  selecting their purchases. Surely it seemed as if there could be no want  here.    As quickly as her burden would let her, the old washerwoman passed  through the crowd into a broad street and rang the basement bell of a  large, showy house.    \"Oh, it's the washerwoman!\" said a flashy-looking servant who answered  the bell; \"set the basket right m here. Mrs. Keithe can't look them over  to-night. There's company in the parlour--Miss Carry's Christmas party.\"    \"Ask her to please pay me--at least a part,\" said old Ann hastily. \"I  don't see how I can do without the money. I counted on it.\"    \"I'll ask her,\" said the pert young woman, turning to go upstairs; \"but  it's no use.\"    Returning in a moment, she delivered the message. \"She has no change  to-night; you're to come in the morning.\"    \"Dear me!\" thought Ann, as she plodded back through the streets, \"it'll  be even worse than I expected, for there's not a morsel to eat in  the house, and not a penny to buy one with. Well--well--the Lord will  provide, the Good Book says, but it's mighty dark days, and it's hard to  believe.\"    Entering the house, Ann sat down silently before the expiring fire. She  was tired, her bones ached, and she was faint for want of food.    Wearily she rested her head on her hands, and tried to think of some way  to get a few cents. She had nothing she could sell or pawn, everything  she could do without had gone before, in similar emergencies. After  sitting there some time, and revolving plan after plan, only to find  them all impossible, she was forced to conclude that they must go  supperless to bed.    Her husband grumbled, and Katey--who came in from a neighbour's--cried  with hunger, and after they were asleep old Ann crept into bed to keep  warm, more disheartened than she had been all winter.    If we could only see a little way ahead! All this time--the darkest the  house on the alley had seen--help was on the way to them. A kind-hearted  city missionary, visiting one of the unfortunate families living in  the upper rooms of old Ann's house, had learned from them of the  noble charity of the humble old washerwoman. It was more than princely  charity, for she not only denied herself nearly every comfort, but she  endured the reproaches of her husband, and the tears of her child.    Telling the story to a party of his friends this Christmas Eve, their  hearts were troubled, and they at once emptied their purses into his  hands for her. And the gift was at that very moment in the pocket of the  missionary, waiting for morning to make her Christmas happy. Christmas  morning broke clear and cold. Ann was up early, as usual, made her fire,  with the last of her coal, cleared up her two rooms, and, leaving her  husband and Katey in bed, was about starting out to try and get  her money to provide a breakfast for them. At the door she met the  missionary.    \"Good-morning, Ann,\" said he. \"I wish you a Merry Christmas.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" said Ann cheerfully; \"the same to yourself.\"    \"Have you been to breakfast already?\" asked the missionary.    \"No, sir,\" said Ann. \"I was just going out for it.\"    \"I haven't either,\" said he, \"but I couldn't bear to wait until I had  eaten breakfast before I brought you your Christmas present--I suspect  you haven't had any yet.\"    Ann smiled. \"Indeed, sir, I haven't had one since I can remember.\"    \"Well, I have one for you. Come in, and I'll tell you about it.\"    Too much amazed for words, Ann led him into the room. The missionary  opened his purse, and handed her a roll of bills.    \"Why--what!\" she gasped, taking it mechanically.    \"Some friends of mine heard of your generous treatment of the poor  families upstairs,\" he went on, \"and they send you this, with their  respects and best wishes for Christmas. Do just what you please with  it--it is wholly yours. No thanks,\" he went on, as she struggled to  speak. \"It's not from me. Just enjoy it--that's all. It has done them  more good to give than it can you "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],[0,"Dave Dawson at Singapore (#20)"],[1,"I right or  wrong, and what do those navigation gadgets back there tell you, huh?\"    Freddy Farmer, in the act of bending over the plane's navigation  instruments, lifted a hand for Dave not to bother him. Almost  immediately he jerked up his head, though, pressed his fingertips to  the built-in headphones of the helmet he wore, and stared straight  ahead like a man suddenly sent into a trance. Dave opened his mouth  to speak, but thought better of it. Obviously the English youth was  getting something over the radio. And it was also obvious that he  wasn't going to say anything about it until he had heard it all. And so  instead of speaking, Dave bent down and began fiddling with the radio  panel fitted to his own instrument panel. However, before he could  shove in the radio-jack and tune the set Freddy Farmer was pounding him  on the shoulder with one clenched fist, and yelling words in his ears.    \"That was an SOS call to Singapore Base, Dave!\" Freddy yelled. \"It's  a courier plane coming up from Australia. It's run into some kind of  trouble. I couldn't tell what, because the message is all garbled up.  But the operator says they are going down, and need help. I got their  position signals just before they faded out. I figure that the spot is  not over fifty miles to our east, Dave!\"    \"That's tough!\" Dawson said and gave his pal a questioning look. \"But  what can we do about it, Freddy? This isn't a flyingboat. We couldn't  sit down on the water and rescue them, even if we did find them.\"    \"I know, I know!\" Freddy said and gave a little shake of his head.  \"But, Dave.... But, Dave, it's possible that we're the only ones who  got their signals. They were mighty weak. I almost missed them, myself.  We could at least find the plane, and radio Singapore for them, and  then get away before any R.A.F. Catalinas showed up.\"    Dave nodded slowly, but screwed up his face in a grimace of doubt and  hesitation as he did so. True it was only fifty miles off their course.  But that meant fifty miles off, and fifty miles back on again. A total  of one hundred air miles. And they would be playing things close enough  with the gas and oil supply, as it was. And, too....    \"It's a British courier plane, and needs help, Dave!\" Freddy Farmer's  voice cut into his thoughts. \"Blast it, we just can't let the lads  down, Dave! We'd never be able to look each other in the face again, if  we did.\"    Dave was forced to grin in spite of the seriousness of the situation.  Good old Freddy Farmer. He was running true to form. His own neck was  very, very far from being safe, and maybe he wouldn't even have a neck  by this time tomorrow. Yet he wasn't giving that little item a single  thought. Somebody else's life was in jeopardy, and that's all that  concerned him at the moment. Help the other fellow, and then give a  thought to himself ... maybe.    \"Okay, okay!\" Dave finally shouted and heeled the plane around on  wingtip. \"Did I say, no? Can't a guy argue, huh? But if we find out  that they just thought they were being forced down then you're getting  out and walking home, my little man. So here we go. And let's see you  give those cat's eyes of yours a really good workout this time!\"    A little over an hour later Dave dug knuckles into his tired, aching  eyes, and once more looked down over the side of the Bristol Taurus  powered Fairey Albacore, of the Singapore Fighter Command, at the  seemingly endless expanse of the South China Sea. The burning rays  of the brass ball, that was the sun hanging in the sky above, beat  downward to turn the rolling swells into one great sheet of shimmering  blue-green glass. To spot anything down there was like trying to spot a  fly walking across the face of the sun, itself.    \"Any luck, pal?\" he called back over his shoulder to Freddy Farmer in  the gunner's pit.    \"No! And I think I'm going blind!\" the English youth groaned. \"That  courier plane must have crashed in and sunk like a rock at once. This  is the exact spot where they reported going down, but I swear there's  nothing down there but water.\"    \"And you're only looking at the _top_ of it!\" Dave grunted. \"I wonder  if we should chance calling Singapore Base, and....\"    Dave cut himself off short and jerked his head around to the east.  Perhaps it was just his imagination playing him tricks, but he could  have sworn that he'd caught a strange flash of light out the corner of  his eye that was more than just the rays of the burning sun bouncing  up off the water. For a full minute, though, he peered intently at a  point on the shimmering blue surface a good fifteen miles off his right  wings. Then as he made a grimace of disappointment, and was about to  turn his head front, he spotted it again. It was the sun's reflection  on something that rose up out of the water and promptly fell back out  of sight again.    \"Hey, Eagle Eyes!\" he called to Freddy Farmer and pointed a finger.  \"Take a look over there and down. Do you see what I see? And, if so,  what in heck is it?\"    It was several seconds before the English youth spoke, but when he did  his voice trembled with excitement.    \"That's the wing of a wrecked plane, Dave!\" he cried. \"Most of it's  submerged ... maybe it's still attached to the plane ... but the swells  are making it poke up out of water. It.... Dave! It has the R.A.F.  bullseye on it. Must be the courier plane we've been hunting. Get us  over there fast, Dave!\"    The last was quite unnecessary. Dawson had already heeled the Albacore  around on wingtip and was tearing full out in the direction of the  strange looking object. And then, when they were still a few miles  short of the spot, something else happened. Something that caused both  youths to let out a simultaneous cry of wild excitement. The bow of a  dull painted blue-green submarine came poking up through to the surface  of the water not over a hundred yards from the bobbing wing.    In the matter of a few seconds the top half of the undersea craft was  above water, and riding on an even keel. And once again Dave and Freddy  saw the conning tower hatch open up, and squat little figures pop out  and go scampering forward to the bow gun. It was the sight of that  little bit of action that helped Freddy Farmer to find his tongue.    \"That's the same boat as yesterday, Dave!\" he cried. \"Or an identical  sister ship, anyway. Look out for the beggars. For heaven's sake don't  let them shoot us down two days in a row. Better not get too close to  the blighters.\"    Dave didn't say anything. The eyes he held fixed on the submarine were  brittle with anger, and memory caused a lump of cold rage to swell up  bigger and bigger inside of him. However, he made no effort to climb  for altitude. As a matter of fact, he reached out his free hand and  deliberately throttled the Bristol Taurus down to a whisper. Freddy  reached forward and rapped him sharply on the shoulder.    \"You in your right mind, Dave?\" he cried. \"What in the world's the  idea? You're making us a perfect target for them. Have you gone balmy?\"    \"Not yet!\" Dave barked and nosed the Albacore down into a long flat  glide. \"Shake up the old brains, pal. They don't see us, and can't.  We're right in the sun to them. No! They're breaking out that bow gun  for another purpose. And I've got a pretty good idea what it is, too.\"    \"What?\" Freddy demanded.    Dave nodded his head forward and down.    \"To get rid of that plane wreckage that's bobbing around,\" he said.  \"Ask me and I'll tell you that the wreckage is all that's left of the  courier plane that sent out that SOS. Remember our little unpleasant  experience yesterday?\"    \"I'm jolly well not likely to forget it!\" the English youth growled.  \"What about it?\"    \"I could be wrong, but I've got a hunch I'm not,\" Dave said with a deep  scowl. \"I mean it this way. This spot isn't far from where we spotted  that strange sub yesterday throwing light signals at us. Well, we went  down for a better look, and what happened? We got clipped before we  had time to take a deep breath. Well, what happens to one guy can  happen to somebody else. No law against it. See?\"    \"So far,\" Freddy grunted.    \"Well, it's simple,\" Dave continued. \"The courier plane was spotted by  the sub. The sub, thinking it was Serrangi's R.A.F. boy friend, started  flashing signals. Well, the courier plane boys went down to see what it  was all about ... just like we did. And they caught just what we  did ... only worse and more of it ... when the sub commander realized  his mistake. The courier plane had time just to send the word to  Singapore Base it was going down, and give its position, before it  crashed in. Well, the sub heard those signals and after ducking away,  came back to remove all traces of their dirty work. And.... And that's  what they're doing right now!\"    Dave shouted the last as the two bow guns aboard the submarine belched  out flame and smoke and hurled a couple of shells at the bobbing wing  at almost blank range. At practically the same instant there were two  white splashes of water not a yard from the bobbing wing. And then a  great column of frothy foam and billowing smoke towered upward into the  air. And for a brief instant the sun drenched blue water seemed to  split apart and spew up a mess of tangled water-logged wreckage. Just  a split second look at the shattered wreckage was all that the boys  were allowed before froth and boiling foam sucked the mess down out of  sight forever. But that split second was long enough for them both to  see that the wreckage had once been an R.A.F. long range Consolidated  Catalina flyingboat. The type that is used all over the world by the  British for courier plane work.    \"That was the courier plane, right enough!\" Freddy Farmer said in a  choked voice. \"Blast their dirty souls. They shot the poor devils down  in cold blood, like they tried to do to us. And, now ... and now,  they....\"    The"]]]
