[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6782"],[0,"The Robbers (#20)"],[1,"? The count? Is it not so? The count gave it  you?    DANIEL. The count? Jesu Maria! The count has not given me anything.    FRANCIS (grasping him tight). I will throttle you till you are black in  the face, you hoary-headed liar! Nothing? Why, then, are you so often  closeted together? He, and you, and Amelia? And what are you always  whispering about? Out with it! What secrets, eh? What secrets has he  confided to you?    DANIEL. I call the Almighty to witness that he has not confided any  secrets to me.    FRANCIS. Do you mean to deny it? What schemes have you been hatching  to get rid of me? Am I to be smothered in my sleep? or is my throat to  be cut in shaving? or am I to be poisoned in wine or chocolate? Eh?  Out with it, out with it! Or am I to have my quietus administered in my  soup? Out with it! I know it all!    DANIEL. May heaven so help me in the hour of need as I now tell you the  truth, and nothing but the pure, unvarnished truth!    FRANCIS. Well, this time I will forgive you. But the money! he most  certainly put money into your purse? And he pressed your hand more  warmly than is customary? something in the manner of an old  acquaintance?    DANIEL. Never, indeed, Sir.    FRANCIS. He told you, for instance, that he had known you before? that  you ought to know him? that the scales would some day fall from your  eyes? that--what? Do you mean to say that he never spoke thus to you?    DANIEL. Not a word of the kind.    FRANCIS. That certain circumstances restrained him--that one must  sometimes wear a mask in order to get at one's enemies--that he would be  revenged, most terribly revenged?    DANIEL. Not a syllable of all this.    FRANCIS. What? Nothing at all? Recollect yourself. That he knew the  old count well--most intimately--that he loved him--loved him  exceedingly--loved him like a son!    DANIEL. Something of that sort I remember to have heard him say.    FRANCIS (turning pale). Did he say so? did he really? How? let me  hear! He said he was my brother?    DANIEL (astonished). What, my master? He did not say that. But as  Lady Amelia was conducting him through the gallery--I was just dusting  the picture frames--he suddenly stood still before the portrait of my  late master, and seemed thunderstruck. Lady Amelia pointed it out, and  said, \"An excellent man!\" \"Yes, a most excellent man!\" he replied,  wiping a tear from his eye.    FRANCIS. Hark, Daniel! You know I have ever been a kind master to you;  I have given you food and raiment, and have spared you labor in  consideration of your advanced age.    DANIEL. For which may heaven reward you! and I, on my part, have  always served you faithfully.    FRANCIS. That is just what I was going to say. You have never in all  your life contradicted me; for you know much too well that you owe me  obedience in all things, whatever I may require of you.    DANIEL. In all things with all my heart, so it be not against God and  my conscience.    FRANCIS. Stuff! nonsense! Are you not ashamed of yourself? An old  man, and believe that Christmas tale! Go, Daniel! that was a stupid  remark. You know that I am your master. It is on me that God and  conscience will be avenged, if, indeed, there be a God and a conscience.    DANIEL (clasping his hands together). Merciful Heaven!    FRANCIS. By your obedience! Do you understand that word? By your  obedience, I command you. With to-morrow's dawn the count must no  longer be found among the living.    DANIEL. Merciful Heaven! and wherefore?    FRANCIS. By your blind obedience! I shall rely upon you implicitly.    DANIEL. On me? May the Blessed Virgin have mercy on me! On me? What  evil, then, have I, an old man, done!    FRANCIS. There is no time now for reflection; your fate is in my hands.  Would you rather pine away the remainder of your days in the deepest of  my dungeons, where hunger shall compel you to gnaw your own bones, and  burning thirst make you suck your own blood? Or would you rather eat  your bread in peace, and have rest in your old age?    DANIEL. What, my lord! Peace and rest in my old age? And I a  murderer?    FRANCIS. Answer my question!    DANIEL. My gray hairs! my gray hairs!    FRANCIS. Yes or no!    DANIEL. No! God have mercy upon me!    FRANCIS (in the act of going). Very well! you shall have need of it.  (DANIEL detains him and falls on his knees before him.)    DANIEL. Mercy, master! mercy!    FRANCIS. Yes or no!    DANIEL. Most gracious master! I am this day seventy-one years of age!  and have honored my father and my mother, and, to the best of my  knowledge, have never in the whole course of my life defrauded any one  to the value of a farthing,--and I have adhered to my creed truly and  honestly, and have served in your house four-and-forty years, and am now  calmly awaiting a quiet, happy end. Oh, master! master! (violently  clasping his knees) and would you deprive me of my only solace in death,  that the gnawing worm of an evil conscience may cheat me of my last  prayer? that I may go to my long home an abomination in the sight of God  and man? No, no! my dearest, best, most excellent, most gracious  master! you do not ask that of an old man turned threescore and ten!    FRANCIS. Yes or no! What is the use of all this palaver?    DANIEL. I will serve you from this day forward more diligently than  ever; I will wear out my old bones in your service like a common  day-laborer; I will rise earlier and lie down later. Oh, and I will  remember you in my prayers night and morning; and God will not reject  the prayer of an old man.    FRANCIS. Obedience is better than sacrifice. Did you ever hear of the  hangman standing upon ceremony when he was told to execute a sentence?    DANIEL. That is very true? but to murder an innocent man--one--    FRANCIS. Am I responsible to you? Is the axe to question the hangman  why he strikes this way and not that? But see how forbearing I am. I  offer you a reward for performing what you owe me in virtue of your  allegiance.    DANIEL. But, when I swore allegiance to you, I at least hoped that I  should be allowed to remain a Christian.    FRANCIS. No contradiction! Look you! I give you the whole day to  think about it! Ponder well on it. Happiness or misery. Do you hear--  do you understand? The extreme of happiness or the extreme of misery!  I can do wonders in the way of torture.    DANIEL (after some reflection). I'll do it; I will do it to-morrow.                              [Exit.]    FRANCIS. The temptation is strong, and I should think he was not born  to die a martyr to his faith. Have with you, sir count! According to  all ordinary calculations, you will sup to-morrow with old Beelzebub.  In these matters all depends upon one's view of a thing; and he is a  fool who takes any view that is contrary to his own interest. A father  quaffs perhaps a bottle of wine more than ordinary--he is in a certain  mood--the result is a human being, the last thing that was thought of in  the affair. Well, I, too, am in a certain mood,--and the result is that  a human being perishes; and surely there is more of reason and purpose  in this than there was in his production. If the birth of a man is the  result of an animal paroxysm, who should take it into his head to attach  any importance to the negation of his birth? A curse upon the folly of  our nurses and teachers, who fill our imaginations with frightful tales,  and impress fearful images of punishment upon the plastic brain of  childhood, so that involuntary shudders shake the limbs of the man with  icy fear, arrest his boldest resolutions, and chain his awakening reason  in the fetters of superstitious darkness. Murder! What a hell full of  furies hovers around that word. Yet 'tis no more than if nature forgets  to bring forth one man more or the doctor makes a mistake--and thus the  whole phantasmagoria vanishes. It was something, and it is nothing.  Does not this amount to exactly the same thing as though it had been  nothing, and came to nothing; and about nothing it is hardly worth while  to waste a word. Man is made of filth, and for a time wades in filth,  and produces filth, and sinks back into filth, till at last he fouls the  boots of his own posterity.*       *[\"To what base uses we may return, Horatio! why, may not     imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till we find it     stopping a bunghole?\"--HAMLET, Act v, Sc. 1.]    That is the burden of the song--the filthy cycle of human fate; and with  that--a pleasant journey to you, sir brother! Conscience, that  splenetic, gouty moralist, may drive shrivelled old drones out of  brothels, and torture usurers on their deathbeds--with me it shall never  more have audience.                              [Exit.]                   SCENE III.--Another Room in the Castle.       CHARLES VON MOOR enters from one side, DANIEL from the other.    CHARLES (hastily). Where is Lady Amelia?    DANIEL. Honored sir! permit an old man to ask you a favor.    CHARLES. It is granted. What is it you ask?    DANIEL. Not much, and yet all--but little, and yet a great deal.  Suffer me to kiss your hand!    CHARLES. That I cannot permit, good old man (embraces him), from one  whom I should like to call my father.    DANIEL. Your hand, your hand! I beseech you.    CHARLES. That must not be.    DANIEL. It must! (He takes hold of it, surveys it quickly, and falls  down before him.) Dear, dearest Charles!    CHARLES (startled; he composes himself, and says in a distant tone).  What mean you, my friend? I don't understand you.    DANIEL. Yes, you may deny it, you may dissemble as much as you please?  'Tis very well! very well. For all that you are my dearest, my  excellent young master. Good Heaven! that I, poor old man, should live  to have the joy--what a stupid blockhead was I that I did not at a  glance--oh, gracious powers! And you are really come back, and the dear  old master is underground, and here you are again!

The confederates  rushed forward through the gap thus opened by the sacrifice of their  comrade, broke and cut down their enemy's ranks, and soon became the  masters of the field. \"Dear and faithful confederates, I will open you a  passage.
