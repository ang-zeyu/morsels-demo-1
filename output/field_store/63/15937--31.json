How  does he pay his way?\"    \"An American credit card,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"is just as good in  Europe as American gold used to be, and on precisely the same  condition, namely, that it be exchanged into the currency of the  country you are traveling in. An American in Berlin takes his credit  card to the local office of the international council, and receives in  exchange for the whole or part of it a German credit card, the amount  being charged against the United States in favor of Germany on the  international account.\"      \"Perhaps Mr. West would like to dine at the Elephant to-day,\" said  Edith, as we left the table.    \"That is the name we give to the general dining-house in our ward,\"  explained her father. \"Not only is our cooking done at the public  kitchens, as I told you last night, but the service and quality of the  meals are much more satisfactory if taken at the dining-house. The two  minor meals of the day are usually taken at home, as not worth the  trouble of going out; but it is general to go out to dine. We have not  done so since you have been with us, from a notion that it would be  better to wait till you had become a little more familiar with our  ways. What do you think? Shall we take dinner at the dining-house  to-day?\"    I said that I should be very much pleased to do so.    Not long after, Edith came to me, smiling, and said:    \"Last night, as I was thinking what I could do to make you feel at home  until you came to be a little more used to us and our ways, an idea  occurred to me. What would you say if I were to introduce you to some  very nice people of your own times, whom I am sure you used to be well  acquainted with?\"    I replied, rather vaguely, that it would certainly be very agreeable,  but I did not see how she was going to manage it.    \"Come with me,\" was her smiling reply, \"and see if I am not as good as  my word.\"    My susceptibility to surprise had been pretty well exhausted by the  numerous shocks it had received, but it was with some wonderment that I  followed her into a room which I had not before entered. It was a  small, cosy apartment, walled with cases filled with books.    \"Here are your friends,\" said Edith, indicating one of the cases, and  as my eye glanced over the names on the backs of the volumes,  Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Shelley, Tennyson, Defoe, Dickens,  Thackeray, Hugo, Hawthorne, Irving, and a score of other great writers  of my time and all time, I understood her meaning. She had indeed made  good her promise in a sense compared with which its literal fulfillment  would have been a disappointment. She had introduced me to a circle of  friends whom the century that had elapsed since last I communed with  them had aged as little as it had myself. Their spirit was as high,  their wit as keen, their laughter and their tears as contagious, as  when their speech had whiled away the hours of a former century. Lonely  I was not and could not be more, with this goodly companionship,  however wide the gulf of years that gaped between me and my old life.    \"You are glad I brought you here,\" exclaimed Edith, radiant, as she  read in my face the success of her experiment. \"It was a good idea, was  it not, Mr. West? How stupid in me not to think of it before! I will  leave you now with your old friends, for I know there will be no  company for you like them just now; but remember you must not let old  friends make you quite forget new ones!\" and with that smiling caution  she left me.    Attracted by the most familiar of the names before me, I laid my hand  on a volume of Dickens, and sat down to read. He had been my prime  favorite among the bookwriters of the century,--I mean the nineteenth  century,--and a week had rarely passed in my old life during which I  had not taken up some volume of his works to while away an idle hour.  Any volume with which I had been familiar would have produced an  extraordinary impression, read under my present circumstances, but my  exceptional familiarity with Dickens, and his consequent power to call  up the associations of my former life, gave to his writings an effect  no others could have had, to intensify, by force of contrast, my  appreciation of the strangeness of my present environment. However new  and astonishing one's surroundings, the tendency is to become a part of  them so soon that almost from the first the power to see them  objectively and fully measure their strangeness, is lost. That power,  already dulled in my case, the pages of Dickens restored by carrying me  back through their associations to the standpoint of my former life.    With a clearness which I had not been able before to attain, I saw now  the past and present, like contrasting pictures, side by side.    The genius of the great novelist of the nineteenth century, like that  of Homer, might indeed defy time; but the setting of his pathetic  tales, the misery of the poor, the wrongs of power, the pitiless  cruelty of the system of society, had passed away as utterly as Circe  and the sirens, Charybdis and Cyclops.    During the hour or two that I sat there with Dickens open before me, I  did not actually read more than a couple of pages. Every paragraph,  every phrase, brought up some new aspect of the world-transformation  which had taken place, and led my thoughts on long and widely ramifying  excursions. As meditating thus in Dr. Leete's library I gradually  attained a more clear and coherent idea of the prodigious spectacle  which I had been so strangely enabled to view, I was filled with a  deepening wonder at the seeming capriciousness of the fate that had  given to one who so little deserved it, or seemed in any way set apart  for it, the power alone among his contemporaries to stand upon the  earth in this latter day. I had neither foreseen the new world nor  toiled for it, as many about me had done regardless of the scorn of  fools or the misconstruction of the good. Surely it would have been  more in accordance with the fitness of things had one of those  prophetic and strenuous souls been enabled to see the travail of his  soul and be satisfied; he, for example, a thousand times rather than I,  who, having beheld in a vision the world I looked on, sang of it in  words that again and again, during these last wondrous days, had rung  in my mind:      For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,    Saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be    Till the war-drum throbbed no longer, and the battle-flags were furled.    In the Parliament of man, the federation of the world.      Then the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,    And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.    For I doubt not through the ages one increasing purpose runs,    And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns.      What though, in his old age, he momentarily lost faith in his own  prediction, as prophets in their hours of depression and doubt  generally do; the words had remained eternal testimony to the seership  of a poet's heart, the insight that is given to faith.    I was still in the library when some hours later Dr. Leete sought me  there. \"Edith told me of her idea,\" he said, \"and I thought it an  excellent one. I had a little curiosity what writer you would first  turn to. Ah, Dickens! You admired him, then! That is where we moderns  agree with you. Judged by our standards, he overtops all the writers of  his age, not because his literary genius was highest, but because his  great heart beat for the poor, because he made the cause of the victims  of society his own, and devoted his pen to exposing its cruelties and  shams. No man of his time did so much as he to turn men's minds to the  wrong and wretchedness of the old order of things, and open their eyes  to the necessity of the great change that was coming, although he  himself did not clearly foresee it.\"        Chapter 14    A heavy rainstorm came up during the day, and I had concluded that the  condition of the streets would be such that my hosts would have to give  up the idea of going out to dinner, although the dining-hall I had  understood to be quite near. I was much surprised when at the dinner  hour the ladies appeared prepared to go out, but without either rubbers  or umbrellas.    The mystery was explained when we found ourselves on the street, for a  continuous waterproof covering had been let down so as to inclose the  sidewalk and turn it into a well lighted and perfectly dry corridor,  which was filled with a stream of ladies and gentlemen dressed for  dinner. At the comers the entire open space was similarly roofed in.  Edith Leete, with whom I walked, seemed much interested in learning  what appeared to be entirely new to her, that in the stormy weather the  streets of the Boston of my day had been impassable, except to persons  protected by umbrellas, boots, and heavy clothing. \"Were sidewalk  coverings not used at all?\" she asked. They were used, I explained, but  in a scattered and utterly unsystematic way, being private enterprises.  She said to me that at the present time all the streets were provided  against inclement weather in the manner I saw, the apparatus being  rolled out of the way when it was unnecessary. She intimated that it  would be considered an extraordinary imbecility to permit the weather  to have any effect on the social movements of the people.    Dr. Leete, who was walking ahead, overhearing something of our talk,  turned to say that the difference between the age of individualism and  that of concert was well characterized by the fact that, in the  nineteenth century, when it rained, the people of Boston put up three  hundred thousand umbrellas over as many heads, and in the twentieth  century they put up one umbrella over all the heads.    As we walked on, Edith said, \"The private umbrella is father's favorite  figure to illustrate the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6260"],[0,"Donovan Pasha, and Some People of Egypt — Complete (#20)"],[1,". Also, the Khedive told the  Mouffetish that if any harm came to Dicky there would come harm to him.  The Khedive loved to play one man off against another, and the death  of Sadik or the death of Dicky would have given him no pain, if either  seemed necessary. For the moment, however, he loved them both after his  fashion; for Sadik lied to him, and squeezed the land dry, and flailed  it with kourbashes for gold for his august master and himself; and Dicky  told him the truth about everything--which gave the Khedive knowledge of  how he really stood all round.    Dicky told the great spendthrift the truth about himself; but he did not  tell the truth when he said he was going to England on a visit to his  kith and kin. Seized by the most irresistible curiosity of his life,  moved by desire for knowledge, that a certain plan in his mind might be  successfully advanced he went south and east, not west and north.    For four months Egypt knew him not. For four months the Khedive was  never told the truth save by European financiers, when truths were  obvious facts; for four long months never saw a fearless or an honest  eye in his own household. Not that it mattered in one sense; but Ismail  was a man of ideas, a sportsman of a sort, an Iniquity with points; a  man who chose the broad way because it was easier, not because he was  remorseless. At the start he meant well by his people, but he meant  better by himself; and not being able to satisfy both sides of the  equation, he satisfied one at the expense of the other and of that x  quantity otherwise known as Europe. Now Europe was heckling him; the  settling of accounts was near. Commissioners had been sent to find where  were the ninety millions he had borrowed. Only Ismail and Sadik the  Mouffetish, once slave and foster-brother, could reply. The Khedive  could not long stave off the evil day when he must \"pay the debt of the  lobster,\" and Sadik give account of his stewardship. Meanwhile, his mind  turned to the resourceful little Englishman with the face of a girl and  the tongue of an honest man.    But the day Dicky had set for his return had come and gone, and Dicky  himself had not appeared. With a grim sort of satisfaction, harmonious  with his irritation, Ismail went forth with his retinue to the Dosah,  the gruesome celebration of the Prophet's birthday, following on the  return of the pilgrimage from Mecca. At noon he entered his splendid  tent at one side of a square made of splendid tents, and looked out  listlessly, yet sourly, upon the vast crowds assembled--upon the lines  of banners, the red and green pennons embroidered with phrases from the  Koran. His half-shut, stormy eyes fell upon the tent of the chief of  the dervishes, and he scarcely checked a sneer, for the ceremony to be  performed appealed to nothing in him save a barbaric instinct, and this  barbaric instinct had been veneered by French civilisation and pierced  by the criticism of one honest man. His look fell upon the long pathway  whereon, for three hundred yards, matting had been spread. It was a  field of the cloth of blood; for on this cloth dervishes returned from  Mecca, mad with fanaticism and hashish, would lie packed like herrings,  while the Sheikh of the Dosah rode his horse over their bodies, a  pavement of human flesh and bone.    As the Khedive looked, his lip curled a little, for he recalled  what Dicky Donovan had said about it; how he had pleaded against it,  describing loathsome wounds and pilgrims done to death. Dicky had ended  his brief homily by saying: \"And isn't that a pretty dish to set  before a king!\" to Ismail's amusement; for he was no good Mussulman, no  Mussulman at all, in fact, save in occasional violent prejudices got of  inheritance and association.    To-day, however, Ismail was in a bad humour with Dicky and with the  world. He had that very morning flogged a soldier senseless with his  own hand; he had handed over his favourite Circassian slave to a  ruffian Bey, who would drown her or sell her within a month; and he had  dishonoured his own note of hand for fifty thousand pounds to a great  merchant who had served him not wisely but too well. He was not taking  his troubles quietly, and woe be to the man or woman who crossed him  this day! Tiberius was an hungered for a victim to his temper. His  entourage knew it well, and many a man trembled that day for his place,  or his head, or his home. Even Sadik the Mouffetish--Sadik, who had  four hundred women slaves dressed in purple and fine linen--Sadik, whose  kitchen alone cost him sixty thousand pounds a year, the price of whose  cigarette ash-trays was equal to the salary of an English consul--even  Sadik, foster-brother, panderer, the Barabbas of his master, was silent  and watchful to-day.    And Sadik, silent and watchful and fearful, was also a dangerous man.  As Sadik's look wandered over the packed crowds, his faded eyes scarce  realising the bright-coloured garments of the men, the crimson silk  tents and banners and pennons, the gorgeous canopies and trappings and  plumes of the approaching dervishes, led by the Amir-el-Haj or Prince  of the Pilgrims, returned from Mecca, he wondered what lamb for the  sacrifice might be provided to soothe the mind of his master. He looked  at the matting in the long lane before them, and he knew that the bodies  which would lie here presently, yielding to the hoofs of the Sheikh's  horse, were not sufficient to appease the rabid spirit tearing at  the Khedive's soul. He himself had been flouted by one ugly look this  morning, and one from Ismail was enough.    It did his own soul good now to see the dervish fanatics foaming at the  mouth, their eyes rolling, as they crushed glass in their mouths and ate  it, as they swallowed fire, as they tore live serpents to pieces with  their teeth and devoured them, as they thrust daggers and spikes of  steel through their cheeks, and gashed their breasts with knives and  swords. He watched the effect of it on the Khedive; but Ismail had seen  all this before, and he took it in the stride. This was not sufficient.    Sadik racked his brain to think who in the palace or in official life  might be made the scapegoat, upon whom the dark spirit in the heart  of the Khedive might be turned. His mean, colourless eyes wandered  inquiringly over the crowd, as the mad dervishes, half-naked, some with  masses of dishevelled hair, some with no hair at all, bleached, haggard,  moaning and shrieking, threw themselves to the ground on the matting,  while attendants pulled off their slippers and placed them under their  heads, which lay face downwards. At last Sadik's eyes were arrested by a  group of ten dervishes, among them one short in stature and very slight,  whose gestures were not so excited as those of his fellows. He also saw  that one or two of the dervishes watched the slight man covertly.    Five of the little group suddenly threw themselves upon the matting,  adding their bodies to the highway of bones and flesh. Then another and  another did the same, leaving three who, with the little man, made  a fanatical chorus. Now the three near the little man began to cut  themselves with steel and knives, and one set fire to his jibbeh and  began to chew the flames. Yet the faces of all three were turned towards  the little man, who did no more than shriek and gesticulate and sway his  body wildly up and down. He was tanned and ragged and bearded and  thin, and there was a weird brilliance in his eyes, which watched his  companions closely.    So fierce and frenzied were the actions of those with him, that the  attention of the Khedive was drawn; and Sadik, looking at his master,  saw that his eyes also were intently fixed on the little man. At that  instant the little man himself caught the eye of the Khedive, and Ismail  involuntarily dropped a hand upon his sword, for some gesture of this  dervish, some familiar turn of his body, startled him. Where had he  seen the gesture before? Who was this pilgrim who did not cut and wound  himself like his companions? Suddenly the three mad dervishes waved  their hands towards the matting and shrieked something into his ear.  The little man's eyes shot a look at the Khedive. Ismail's ferret eye  fastened on him, and a quick fear as of assassination crossed his face  as the small dervish ran forward with the other three to the lane of  human flesh, where there was still a gap to be filled, and the cry rose  up that the Sheikh of the Dosah had left his tent and was about to begin  his direful ride.    Sadik the Mouffetish saw the Khedive's face, and suddenly said in his  ear: \"Shall my slave seize him, Highness whom God preserve?\"    The Khedive did not reply, for at that moment he recognised the dervish;  and now he understood that Dicky Donovan had made the pilgrimage to  Mecca with the Mahmal caravan; that an infidel had desecrated the holy  city; and that his Englishman had lied to him. His first impulse was to  have Dicky seized and cast to the crowd, to be torn to pieces. Dicky's  eyes met his without wavering--a desperate yet resolute look--and Ismail  knew that the little man would sell his life dearly, if he had but half  a chance. He also saw in Dicky's eyes the old honesty, the fearless  straightforwardness--and an appeal too, not humble, but still eager and  downright. Ismail's fury was great, for the blue devils had him by  the heels that day; but on the instant he saw the eyes of Sadik the  Mouffetish, and their cunning, cruelty, and soulless depravity, their  present search for a victim to his master's bad temper, acted at once on  Ismail's sense of humour. He saw that Sadik half suspected something, he  saw that Dicky's three companions suspected, and his mind was made up on  the instant--things should take their course--he would not interfere.  He looked Dicky squarely in the face, and Dicky knew that the Khedive's  glance said as plainly as words:    \"Fool"]]]
