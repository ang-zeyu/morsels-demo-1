We are a rich Nation; we can afford to pay for security and  prosperity without having to sacrifice our liberties into the  bargain.    In the first century of our republic we were short of capital,  short of workers and short of industrial production; but we were  rich in free land, free timber and free mineral wealth.  The federal  government rightly assumed the duty of promoting business and  relieving depression by giving subsidies of land and other  resources.    Thus, from our earliest days we have had a tradition of substantial  government help to our system of private enterprise.  But today the  government no longer has vast tracts of rich land to give away and  we have discovered, too, that we must spend large sums of money to  conserve our land from further erosion and our forests from further  depletion.  The situation is also very different from the old days,  because now we have plenty of capital, banks and insurance  companies loaded with idle money; plenty of industrial productive  capacity and many millions of workers looking for jobs.  It is  following tradition as well as necessity, if government strives to  put idle money and idle men to work, to increase our public wealth  and to build up the health and strength of the people--and to help  our system of private enterprise to function.    It is going to cost something to get out of this recession this way  but the profit of getting out of it will pay for the cost several  times over.  Lost working time is lost money.  Every day that a  workman is unemployed, or a machine is unused, or a business  organization is marking time, it is a loss to the nation.  Because  of idle men and idle machines this Nation lost one hundred billion  dollars between 1929 and the Spring of 1933, in less than four  years.  This year you, the people of this country, are making about  twelve billion dollars less than last year.    If you think back to the experiences of the early years of this  administration you will remember the doubts and fears expressed  about the rising expenses of government.  But to the surprise of the  doubters, as we proceeded to carry on the program which included  Public Works and Work Relief, the country grew richer instead of  poorer.    It is worthwhile to remember that the annual national people's  income was thirty billion dollars more last year in 1937 than it  was in 1932.  It is true that the national debt increased sixteen  billion dollars, but remember that in that increase must be  included several billion dollars worth of assets which eventually  will reduce that debt and that many billion dollars of permanent  public improvements--schools, roads, bridges, tunnels, public  buildings, parks and a host of other things--meet your eye in every  one of the thirty-one hundred counties in the United States.    No doubt you will be told that the government spending program of  the past five years did not cause the increase in our national  income.  They will tell you that business revived because of private  spending and investment.  That is true in part, for the government  spent only a small part of the total.  But that government spending  acted as a trigger to set off private activity.  That is why the  total addition to our national production and national income has  been so much greater than the contribution of the government  itself.    In pursuance of that thought I said to the Congress today:    \"I want to make it clear that we do not believe that we can get an  adequate rise in national income merely by investing, and lending  or spending public funds.  It is essential in our economy that  private funds must be put to work and all of us recognize that such  funds are entitled to a fair profit.\"    As national income rises, \"let us not forget that government  expenditures will go down and government tax receipts will go up.\"    The government contribution of land that we once made to business  was the land of all the people.  And the government contribution of  money which we now make to business ultimately comes out of the  labor of all the people.  It is, therefore, only sound morality, as  well as a sound distribution of buying power, that the benefits of  the prosperity coming from this use of the money of all the people  ought to be distributed among all the people--at the bottom as well  as at the top.  Consequently, I am again expressing my hope that the  Congress will enact at this session a wage and hour bill putting a  floor under industrial wages and a limit on working hours--to  ensure a better distribution of our prosperity, a better  distribution of available work, and a sounder distribution of  buying power.    You may get all kinds of impressions in regard to the total cost of  this new program, or in regard to the amount that will be added to  the net national debt.    It is a big program.  Last autumn in a sincere effort to bring  government expenditures and government income into closer balance,  the Budget I worked out called for sharp decreases in government  spending.    In the light of present conditions those estimates were far too  low.  This new program adds two billion and sixty-two million  dollars to direct treasury expenditures and another nine hundred  and fifty million dollars to government loans--the latter sum,  because they are loans, will come back to the treasury in the  future.    The net effect on the debt of the government is this--between now  and July 1, 1939--fifteen months away--the treasury will have to  raise less than a billion and a half dollars of new money.    Such an addition to the net debt of the United States need not give  concern to any citizen, for it will return to the people of the  United States many times over in increased buying power and  eventually in much greater government tax receipts because of the  increase in the citizen income.    What I said to the Congress in the close of my message I repeat to  you.    \"Let us unanimously recognize the fact that the federal debt,  whether it be twenty-five billions or forty billions, can only be  paid if the nation obtains a vastly increased citizen income.  I  repeat that if this citizen income can be raised to eighty billion  dollars a year the national government and the overwhelming  majority of state and local governments will be definitely 'out of  the red.'  The higher the national income goes the faster will we be  able to reduce the total of federal and state and local debts.  Viewed from every angle, today's purchasing power--the citizens'  income of today--is not at this time sufficient to drive the  economic system of America at higher speed.  Responsibility of  government requires us at this time to supplement the normal  processes and in so supplementing them to make sure that the  addition is adequate.  We must start again on a long steady upward  incline in national income.    \". . .  And in that process, which I believe is ready to start, let  us avoid the pitfalls of the past--the overproduction, the  overspeculation, and indeed all the extremes which we did not  succeed in avoiding in 1929.  In all of this, government cannot and  should not act alone.  Business must help.  And I am sure business  will help.    \"We need more than the materials of recovery.  We need a united  national will.    \"We need to recognize nationally that the demands of no group,  however just, can be satisfied unless that group is prepared to  share in finding a way to produce the income from which they and  all other groups can be paid. . . .  You, as the Congress, I, as the  President, must by virtue of our offices, seek the national good by  preserving the balance between all groups and all sections.    \"We have at our disposal the national resources, the money, the  skill of hand and head to raise our economic level--our citizens'  income.  Our capacity is limited only by our ability to work  together.  What is needed is the will.    \"The time has come to bring that will into action with every  driving force at our command.  And I am determined to do my share.    \". . .  Certain positive requirements seem to me to accompany the  will--if we have that will.    \"There is placed on all of us the duty of self-restraint. . . .  That is the discipline of a democracy.  Every patriotic citizen must  say to himself or herself, that immoderate statement, appeals to  prejudice, the creation of unkindness, are offenses not against an  individual or individuals, but offenses against the whole  population of the United States. . . .    \"Self-restraint implies restraint by articulate public opinion,  trained to distinguish fact from falsehood, trained to believe that  bitterness is never a useful instrument in public affairs.  There  can be no dictatorship by an individual or by a group in this  Nation, save through division fostered by hate.  Such division there  must never be.\"    And finally I should like to say a personal word to you.    I never forget that I live in a house owned by all the American  people and that I have been given their trust.    I try always to remember that their deepest problems are human.  I  constantly talk with those who come to tell me their own points of  view; with those who manage the great industries and financial  institutions of the country; with those who represent the farmer  and the worker; and often with average citizens without high  position who come to this house.  And constantly I seek to look  beyond the doors of the White House, beyond the officialdom of the  national capital, into the hopes and fears of men and women in  their homes.  I have travelled the country over many times.  My  friends, my enemies, my daily mail bring to me reports of what you  are thinking and hoping.  I want to be sure that neither battles nor  burdens of office shall ever blind me to an intimate knowledge of  the way the American people want to live and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5770"],[0,"The Rover Boys in the Jungle; Or, Stirring Adventures in Africa (#20)"],[1,"black as night, while from a distance came the low  rumble of thunder.  There was a wind rushing high up in the air,  but as yet this had not come down any further than the treetops.  The birds of the jungle took up the alarm and filled the forest  with their discordant cries, and even the monkeys, which were now  numerous, sit up a jabber which would have been highly trying to  the nerves of a nervous person.    \"Yes, we catch um,\" said Cujo, in reply to Dick's question.  \"Me  look for safe place too stay.\"    \"You think the storm will be a heavy one?\" asked Randolph Rover  anxiously.    \"Werry heavy, massah; werry heavy,\" returned Cujo.  \"Come wid me,  all ob you,\"  and he set off on a run.    All followed as quickly as they could, and soon found themselves  under a high mass of rocks overlooking the Kassai River.  They had  hardly gained the shelter when the storm burst over their heads in  all of its wild fury.    \"My, but this beats anything that I ever saw before!\" cried Sam,  as the wind began to rush by them with ever-increasing velocity.    \"Him blow big by-me-by,\" said Cujo with a sober face.  \"Him big  storm, dis.\"    \"The air was full of a moanin' sound,\" to use Aleck's way of  expressing it.  It came from a great distance and caused the  monkeys and birds to set up more of a noise than ever.  The trees  were now swaying violently, and presently from a distance came a  crack like that of a big pistol.    \"Was that a tree went down?\" asked Randolph Rover, and Cujo  nodded.  \"It is a good thing, then, that we got out of the  forest.\"    \"Big woods werry dangerous in heap storm like dis,\" answered the  African.  \"Tree come down, maybe kill um. Hark! now um comin'!\"    He crouched down between two of the largest rocks and instinctively  the others followed suit.  The \"moanin\" increased until, with a  roar and a rush, a regular tropical hurricane was upon them.  The blackness of the atmosphere was filled with flying tree  branches and scattered vines, while the birds, large and small,  swept past like chips on a swiftly flowing river, powerless to  save themselves in those fierce gusts.    \"Keep down, for your lives!\" shouted Randolph Rover; but the roar  of the elements drowned out his voice completely.  However, nobody  thought of rising, and the tree limbs and vines passed harmlessly  over their heads.    The first rush of wind over, the rain began, to fall, at first in  drops as big as a quarter-dollar and then in a deluge which  speedily converted the hollows among the rocks into deep pools and  soaked everybody to his very skin.  Soon the water was up to their  knees and pouring down into the river like a regular cataract.    \"This is a soaker and no mistake,\" said Sam, during a brief lull  in the downpour.  \"Why, I never saw so much water come down in my  life.\"    \"It's a hurricane,\" answered Randolph Rover, \"It may keep on--\"    He got no further, for at that instant a blinding flash of  lightning caused everybody to jump in alarm.  Then came an  ear-splitting crack of thunder and up the river they saw a  magnificent baobab tree, which had reared its stately head over a  hundred feet high from the ground, come crashing down, split in  twain as by a Titan's ax.  The blackened stump was left standing,  and soon--this burst into flames, to blaze away until another  downpour of rain put out the conflagration.    \"My, but that dun been awful!\" murmured Aleck with a shiver.  \"Ise  glad we didn't take no shelter under dat tree.\"    \"Amen,\" said Tom.  He had been on the point of making some joke  about the storm, but now the fun was knocked completely out of  him.    It rained for the rest of the day and all of the night, and for  once all hands felt thoroughly, miserable.  Several times they  essayed to start a fire, by which to dry themselves and make  something hot to drink, but each time the rain put out the blaze.  What they had to eat was not only cold, but more or less  water-soaked, and it was not until the next noon that they managed to  cook a meal.    When at last the sun did come out, however, it shone, so Sam put  it, \"with a vengeance.\"  There was not a cloud left, and the  direct rays of the great orb of day caused a rapid evaporation of  the rain, so that the ground seemed to be covered with a sort of  mist.  On every side could be seen the effects of the hurricane-broken  trees, washed-out places along the river, and dead birds  and small animals, including countless monkeys.  The monkeys made  the boys' hearts ache, especially one big female, that was found  tightly clasping two little baby monkeys to her breast.    The storm had swollen the river to such an extent that they were  forced to leave the beaten track Cujo had been pursuing and take  to another trail which reached out to the southward.  Here they  passed a small village occupied entirely by negroes, and Cujo  learned from them that King Susko had passed that way but five  days before.  He had had no cattle with him, the majority of his  followers having taken another route.  It was thought by some of  the natives that King Susko was bound for a mountain known as the  Hakiwaupi--or Ghost-of-Gold.    \"The Ghost-of-Gold!\" repeated Dick.  \"Can that be the mountain  father was searching for when he came to Africa?\"    Inquiries from Cujo elicited the information that the mountain  mentioned was located about one hundred miles away, in the center  of an immense plain.  It was said to be full of gold, but likewise  haunted by the ghost of a departed warrior known to the natives as  Gnu-ho-mumoli--Man-of-the-Gnu-eye.    \"I reckon that ghost story, was started, by somebody who wanted,  to keep the wealth of che mountain to himself,\" observed Tom.  \"I  don't believe in ghosts, do you, Cujo?\"    The tall African shrugged his ebony shoulders, \"Maybe no ghost--but  if dare is, no want to see 'um,\" he said laconically.  Nevertheless he did not object to leading them in the direction of  the supposedly haunted mountain.    So far the natives had been more or less friendly, but now those  that were met said but little to Cujo, while scowls at the whites  were frequent.  It was learned that the college party from the  East was in the vicinity.    \"Perhaps they did something to offend the natives,\" observed  Randolph Rover.  \"As you can see, they are simple and childlike in  their ways, and as quickly offended on one hand as they are  pleased on the other.  All of you must be careful in your  treatment of them, otherwise we may get into serious trouble.\"          CHAPTER XXIII    DICK MEETS AN OLD ENEMY      One afternoon Dick found himself alone near the edge of a tiny  lake situated on the southern border of the jungle through which  the party had passed.  The others had gone up the lake shore,  leaving him to see what he could catch for supper.    He had just hooked a magnificent fish of a reddish-brown color,  when, on looking up, he espied an elderly man gazing at him  intently from a knoll of water-grass a short distance away.    \"Richard Rover, is it--ahem--possible?\" came slowly from the  man's thin lips.  \"Surely I must be dreaming!\"    \"Josiah Crabtree!\" ejaculated Dick, so surprised that he let the  fish fall into the water again.  \"How on earth did you get out  here?\"    \"I presume I might--er--ask that same question,\" returned the  former teacher of Putnam Hall.  \"Did you follow me to Africa?\"    \"Do you imagine I would be fool enough to do that, Mr. Crabtree?  No, the Stanhopes and I were content to let you go--so long as  you minded your own business in the future.\"    \"Do not grow saucy, boy; I will not stand it.\"    \"I am not saucy, as you see fit to term it, Josiah Crabtree.  You  know as well as I do that you ought to be in prison this minute  for plotting the abduction of Dora.\"    \"I know nothing of the kind, and will not waste words on you.  But  if you did not follow me why are you here?\"    \"I am here on business, and not ashamed to own it.\"    \"Indeed.  And you--did you come in search of your missing  father?\"    \"I did.\"    \"You once said he was missing.  It is a long journey for one so  young.\"    \"It's a queer place for you to come to.\"    \"I am with an exploring party from Yale College.  We are studying  the fauna and flora of central Africa--at least, they are doing  so under my guidance.\"    \"They must be learning a heap--under you.\"    \"Do you mean to say I am not capable of teaching them!\" cried  Josiah Crabtree, wrathfully.    \"Well, if I was in their place I would want somebody else besides  the man who was discharged by Captain Putnam and who failed to get  the appointment he wanted at Columbia College because he could not  stand the examination.\"    \"Boy!  Boy!  You know nothing of my ability!\" fumed Crabtree,  coming closer and shaking, his fist in Dick's face.    \"Well, I know something of your lack of ability.\"    \"You are doing your best to insult me!\"    \"Such an old fraud as you cannot be insulted, Josiah Crabtree.  I  read your real character the first time I met you, and you have  never done anything since which has caused me to alter my opinion  of you.  You have a small smattering of learning and you can put  on a very wise look when occasion requires.  But that is all there  is to it, except that behind it all you are a thorough-paced  scoundrel and only lack a certain courage to do some daring bit of  rascality.\"    This statement of plain truths fairly set Josiah Crabtree to  boiling with rage.  He shook his fist in Dick's face again.  \"Don't  dare to talk that way, Rover; don't dare--or--I'll--I'll--\"    \"What will you do?\"    \"Never mind; I'll show you when the proper time comes.\"    \"I told you once before that I was not afraid of you--and I am  not afraid of you now.\"    \"You did not come to Africa alone, did you?\"    \"To be sure I did not.  I have a large party with me.\"    \"In this vicinity?\"    \"Yes, within calling distance.  I tell you that--and it's the  truth--so that you won't "]]]
