But his fortune was overwhelmed in the shipwreck of the year  twenty, and the labours of thirty years were blasted in a single day. Of  the use or abuse of the South Sea scheme, of the guilt or innocence of  my grandfather and his brother directors, I am neither a competent nor  a disinterested judge. Yet the equity of modern times must condemn the  violent and arbitrary proceedings, which would have disgraced the cause  of justice, and rendered injustice still more odious. No sooner had  the nation awakened from its golden dream, than a popular, and even a  Parliamentary clamour, demanded its victims; but it was acknowledged on  all sides, that the directors, however guilty, could not be touched by  any known laws of the land. The intemperate notions of Lord Molesworth  were not literally acted on; but a bill of pains and penalties was  introduced--a retro-active statute, to punish the offences which did not  exist at the time they were committed. The Legislature restrained the  persons of the directors, imposed an exorbitant security for their  appearance, and marked their character with a previous note of ignominy.  They were compelled to deliver, upon oath, the strict value of their  estates, and were disabled from making any transfer or alienation of any  part of their property. Against a bill of pains and penalties, it is  the common right of every subject to be heard by his counsel at the bar.  They prayed to be heard. Their prayer was refused, and their oppressors,  who required no evidence, would listen to no defence. It had been at  first proposed, that one eighth of their respective estates should be  allowed for the future support of the directors; but it was speciously  urged, that in the various shades of opulence and guilt, such a  proportion would be too light for many, and for some might possibly  be too heavy. The character and conduct of each man were separately  weighed; but, instead of the calm solemnity of a judicial inquiry, the  fortune and honour of thirty-three Englishmen were made the topics of  hasty conversation, the sport of a lawless majority; and the basest  member of the committee, by a malicious word, or a silent vote, might  indulge his general spleen or personal animosity. Injury was aggravated  by insult, and insult was embittered by pleasantry. Allowances of 20  pounds or 1 shilling were facetiously moved. A vague report that a  director had formerly been concerned in another project, by which some  unknown persons had lost their money, was admitted as a proof of his  actual guilt. One man was ruined because he had dropped a foolish  speech, that his horses should feed upon gold; another, because he was  grown so proud, that one day, at the Treasury, he had refused a civil  answer to persons much above him. All were condemned, absent and  unheard, in arbitrary fines and forfeitures, which swept away the  greatest part of their substance. Such bold oppression can scarcely  be shielded by the omnipotence of Parliament. My grandfather could not  expect to be treated with more lenity than his companions. His Tory  principles and connexions rendered him obnoxious to the ruling powers.  His name was reported in a suspicious secret. His well-known abilities  could not plead the excuse of ignorance or error. In the first  proceedings against the South Sea directors, Mr. Gibbon was one of the  first taken into custody, and in the final sentence the measure of  his fine proclaimed him eminently guilty. The total estimate, which he  delivered on oath to the House of Commons, amounted to 106,543 pounds  5 shillings 6 pence, exclusive of antecedent settlements. Two different  allowances of 15,000 pounds and of 10,000 pounds were moved for Mr.  Gibbon; but, on the question being put, it was carried without a  division for the smaller sum. On these ruins, with the skill and credit  of which Parliament had not been able to despoil him, my grandfather,  at a mature age, erected the edifice of a new fortune. The labours of  sixteen years were amply rewarded; and I have reason to believe that the  second structure was not much inferior to the first.\"    The next consideration of the Legislature, after the punishment of the  directors, was to restore public credit. The scheme of Walpole had been  found insufficient, and had fallen into disrepute. A computation was  made of the whole capital stock of the South Sea Company at the end of  the year 1720. It was found to amount to thirty-seven millions eight  hundred thousand pounds, of which the stock allotted to all the  proprietors only amounted to twenty-four millions five hundred thousand  pounds. The remainder of thirteen millions three hundred thousand pounds  belonged to the Company in their corporate capacity, and was the profit  they had made by the national delusion. Upwards of eight millions of  this were taken from the Company, and divided among the proprietors and  subscribers generally, making a dividend of about 33 pounds 6 shillings  8 pence per cent. This was a great relief. It was further ordered, that  such persons as had borrowed money from the South Sea Company upon stock  actually transferred and pledged at the time of borrowing to or for the  use of the Company, should be free from all demands, upon payment of ten  per cent. of the sums so borrowed. They had lent about eleven millions  in this manner, at a time when prices were unnaturally raised; and they  now received back one million one hundred thousand, when prices had sunk  to their ordinary level.    But it was a long time before public credit was thoroughly restored.  Enterprise, like Icarus, had soared too high, and melted the wax of  her wings; like Icarus, she had fallen into a sea, and learned, while  floundering in its waves, that her proper element was the solid ground.  She has never since attempted so high a flight.    In times of great commercial prosperity there has been a tendency to  over-speculation on several occasions since then. The success of  one project generally produces others of a similar kind. Popular  imitativeness will always, in a trading nation, seize hold of such  successes, and drag a community too anxious for profits into an abyss  from which extrication is difficult. Bubble companies, of a kind similar  to those engendered by the South Sea project, lived their little day  in the famous year of the panic, 1825. On that occasion, as in 1720,  knavery gathered a rich harvest from cupidity, but both suffered when  the day of reckoning came. The schemes of the year 1836 threatened, at  one time, results as disastrous; but they were happily averted before  it was too late. The South Sea project thus remains, and, it is to be  hoped, always will remain, the greatest example in British history, of  the infatuation of the people for commercial gambling. From the bitter  experience of that period, posterity may learn how dangerous it is to  let speculation riot unrestrained, and to hope for enormous profits from  inadequate causes. Degrading as were the circumstances, there is wisdom  to be gained from the lesson which they teach.          THE TULIPOMANIA.         Quis furor o cives!--Lucan.    The tulip,--so named, it is said, from a Turkish word, signifying a  turban,--was introduced into western Europe about the middle of the  sixteenth century. Conrad Gesner, who claims the merit of having brought  it into repute,--little dreaming of the extraordinary commotion it was  to make in the world,--says that he first saw it in the year 1559, in a  garden at Augsburg, belonging to the learned Counsellor Herwart, a man  very famous in his day for his collection of rare exotics. The bulbs  were sent to this gentleman by a friend at Constantinople, where the  flower had long been a favourite. In the course of ten or eleven  years after this period, tulips were much sought after by the wealthy,  especially in Holland and Germany. Rich people at Amsterdam sent for the  bulbs direct to Constantinople, and paid the most extravagant prices  for them. The first roots planted in England were brought from Vienna  in 1600. Until the year 1634 the tulip annually increased in reputation,  until it was deemed a proof of bad taste in any man of fortune to be  without a collection of them. Many learned men, including Pompeius de  Angelis and the celebrated Lipsius of Leyden, the author of the  treatise \"De Constantia,\" were passionately fond of tulips. The rage for  possessing them soon caught the middle classes of society, and merchants  and shopkeepers, even of moderate means, began to vie with each other  in the rarity of these flowers and the preposterous prices they paid for  them. A trader at Harlaem was known to pay one-half of his fortune for a  single root--not with the design of selling it again at a profit, but to  keep in his own conservatory for the admiration of his acquaintance.    One would suppose that there must have been some great virtue in this  flower to have made it so valuable in the eyes of so prudent a people  as the Dutch; but it has neither the beauty nor the perfume of the  rose--hardly the beauty of the \"sweet, sweet-pea;\" neither is it as  enduring as either. Cowley, it is true, is loud in its praise. He says--         \"The tulip next appeared, all over gay,       But wanton, full of pride, and full of play;       The world can't show a dye but here has place;       Nay, by new mixtures, she can change her face;       Purple and gold are both beneath her care--       The richest needlework she loves to wear;       Her only study is to please the eye,       And to outshine the rest in finery.\"    This, though not very poetical, is the description of a poet. Beckmann,  in his History of Inventions, paints it with more fidelity, and in prose  more pleasing than Cowley's poetry. He says, \"There are few plants which  acquire, through accident, weakness, or disease, so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6382"],[0,"Bat Wing (#20)"],[1,"grew troubled. \"It is another of those mysteries  which seem to be part of Colonel Menendez's normal existence.\"    \"And is this dislike mutual?\"    \"That I cannot say, since I have never met Mr. Camber.\"    \"And Madame de Staemer, does she share it?\"    \"Fully, I think. But don't ask me what it means, because I don't know.\"    She dismissed the subject with a light gesture and poured me out a  second cup of coffee.    \"I am going to leave you now,\" she said. \"I have to justify my existence  in my own eyes.\"    \"Must you really go?\"    \"I must really.\"    \"Then tell me something before you go.\"    She gathered up the bunches of roses and looked down at me with a  wistful expression.    \"Yes, what is it?\"    \"Did you detect those mysterious footsteps again last night?\"    The look of wistfulness changed to another which I hated to see in her  eyes, an expression of repressed fear.    \"No,\" she replied in a very low voice, \"but why do you ask the  question?\"    Doubt of her had been far enough from my mind, but that something in the  tone of my voice had put her on her guard I could see.    \"I am naturally curious,\" I replied, gravely.    \"No,\" she repeated, \"I have not heard the sound for some time now.  Perhaps, after all, my fears were imaginary.\"    There was a constraint in her manner which was all too obvious, and  when presently, laden with the spoil of the rose garden, she gave me a  parting smile and hurried into the house, I sat there very still for a  while, and something of the brightness had faded from the coming, nor  did life seem so glad a business as I had thought it quite recently.          CHAPTER XIII    AT THE GUEST HOUSE        I presented myself at the Guest House at half-past eleven. My mental  state was troubled and indescribably complex. Perhaps my own uneasy,  thoughts were responsible for the idea, but it seemed to me that the  atmosphere of Cray's Folly had changed yet again. Never before had  I experienced a sense of foreboding like that which had possessed me  throughout the hours of this bright summer's morning.    Colonel Menendez had appeared about nine o'clock. He exhibiting no  traces of illness that were perceptible to me. But this subtle change  which I had detected, or thought I had detected, was more marked in  Madame Staemer than in any one. In her strange, still eyes I had read  what I can only describe as a stricken look. It had none of the heroic  resignation and acceptance of the inevitable which had so startled me in  the face of the Colonel on the previous day. There was a bitterness in  it, as of one who has made a great but unwilling sacrifice, and again I  had found myself questing that faint but fugitive memory, conjured up by  the eyes of Madame de Staemer.    Never had the shadow lain so darkly upon the house as it lay this  morning with the sun blazing gladly out of a serene sky. The birds, the  flowers, and Mother Earth herself bespoke the joy of summer. But beneath  the roof of Cray's Folly dwelt a spirit of unrest, of apprehension. I  thought of that queer lull which comes before a tropical storm, and I  thought I read a knowledge of pending evil even in the glances of the  servants.    I had spoken to Harley of this fear. He had smiled and nodded grimly,  saying:    \"Evidently, Knox, you have forgotten that to-night is the night of the  full moon.\"    It was in no easy state of mind, then, that I opened the gate and walked  up to the porch of the Guest House. That the solution of the grand  mystery of Cray's Folly would automatically resolve these lesser  mysteries I felt assured, and I was supported by the idea that a clue  might lie here.    The house, which from the roadway had an air of neglect, proved on close  inspection to be well tended, but of an unprosperous aspect. The brass  knocker, door knob, and letter box were brilliantly polished, whilst  the windows and the window curtains were spotlessly clean. But the place  cried aloud for the service of the decorator, and it did not need the  deductive powers of a Paul Harley to determine that Mr. Colin Camber was  in straitened circumstances.    In response to my ringing the door was presently opened by Ah Tsong. His  yellow face exhibited no trace of emotion whatever. He merely opened the  door and stood there looking at me.    \"Is Mr. Camber at home?\" I enquired.    \"Master no got,\" crooned Ah Tsong.    He proceeded quietly to close the door again.    \"One moment,\" I said, \"one moment. I wish, at any rate, to leave my  card.\"    Ah Tsong allowed the door to remain open, but:    \"No usee palaber so fashion,\" he said. \"No feller comee here. Sabby?\"    \"I savvy, right enough,\" said I, \"but all the same you have got to take  my card in to Mr. Camber.\"    I handed him a card as I spoke, and suddenly addressing him in \"pidgin,\"  of which, fortunately, I had a smattering:    \"Belong very quick, Ah Tsong,\" I said, sharply, \"or plenty big trouble,  savvy?\"    \"Sabby, sabby,\" he muttered, nodding his head; and leaving me standing  in the porch he retired along the sparsely carpeted hall.    This hall was very gloomily lighted, but I could see several pieces of  massive old furniture and a number of bookcases, all looking incredibly  untidy.    Rather less than a minute elapsed, I suppose, when from some place at  the farther end of the hallway Mr. Camber appeared in person. He wore a  threadbare dressing gown, the silken collar and cuffs of which were very  badly frayed. His hair was dishevelled and palpably he had not shaved  this morning.    He was smoking a corncob pipe, and he slowly approached, glancing from  the card which he held in his hand in my direction, and then back again  at the card, with a curious sort of hesitancy. In spite of his untidy  appearance I could not fail to mark the dignity of his bearing, and the  almost arrogant angle at which he held his head.    \"Mr--er--Malcolm Knox?\" he began, fixing his large eyes upon me with a  look in which I could detect no sign of recognition. \"I am advised that  you desire to see me?\"    \"That is so, Mr. Camber,\" I replied, cheerily. \"I fear I have  interrupted your work, but as no other opportunity may occur of renewing  an acquaintance which for my part I found extremely pleasant--\"    \"Of renewing an acquaintance, you say, Mr. Knox?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Quite.\" He looked me up and down critically. \"To be sure, we have met  before, I understand?\"    \"We met yesterday, Mr. Camber, you may recall. Having chanced to come  across a contribution of yours of the _Occult Review_, I have availed  myself of your invitation to drop in for a chat.\"    His expression changed immediately and the sombre eyes lighted up.    \"Ah, of course,\" he cried, \"you are a student of the transcendental.  Forgive my seeming rudeness, Mr. Knox, but indeed my memory is of the  poorest. Pray come in, sir; your visit is very welcome.\"    He held the door wide open, and inclined his head in a gesture of  curious old-world courtesy which was strange in so young a man. And  congratulating myself upon the happy thought which had enabled me to win  such instant favour, I presently found myself in a study which I despair  of describing.    In some respects it resembled the lumber room of an antiquary, whilst  in many particulars it corresponded to the interior of one of those  second-hand bookshops which abound in the neighbourhood of Charing Cross  Road. The shelves with which it was lined literally bulged with books,  and there were books on the floor, books on the mantelpiece, and books,  some open and some shut, some handsomely bound, and some having the  covers torn off, upon every table and nearly every chair in the place.    Volume seven of Burton's monumental \"Thousand Nights and a Night\" lay  upon a littered desk before which I presumed Mr. Camber had been seated  at the time of my arrival. Some wet vessel, probably a cup of tea or  coffee, had at some time been set down upon the page at which this  volume was open, for it was marked with a dark brown ring. A volume of  Fraser's \"Golden Bough\" had been used as an ash tray, apparently, since  the binding was burned in several places where cigarettes had been laid  upon it.    In this interesting, indeed unique apartment, East met West, unabashed  by Kipling's dictum. Roman tear-vases and Egyptian tomb-offerings stood  upon the same shelf as empty Bass bottles; and a hideous wooden idol  from the South Sea Islands leered on eternally, unmoved by the  presence upon his distorted head of a soft felt hat made, I believe, in  Philadelphia.    Strange implements from early British barrows found themselves in the  company of _Thugee_ daggers There were carved mammals' tusks and snake  emblems from Yucatan; against a Chinese ivory model of the Temple of Ten  Thousand Buddhas rested a Coptic crucifix made from a twig of the Holy  Rose Tree. Across an ancient Spanish coffer was thrown a Persian rug  into which had been woven the monogram of Shah-Jehan and a text from  the Koran. It was easy to see that Mr. Colin Camber's studies must have  imposed a severe strain upon his purse.    \"Sit down, Mr. Knox, sit down,\" he said, sweeping a vellum-bound volume  of Eliphas Levi from a chair, and pushing the chair forward. \"The visit  of a fellow-student is a rare pleasure for me. And you find me, sir,\" he  seated himself in a curious, carved chair which stood before the desk,  \"you find me engaged upon enquiries, the result of which will constitute  chapter forty-two of my present book. Pray glance at the contents of  this little box.\"    He placed in my hands a small box of dark wood, evidently of great age.  It contained what looked like a number of shrivelled beans.    Having glanced at it curiously I returned it to him, shaking my head  blankly.    \"You are puzzled?\" he said, with a kind of boyish triumph, which lighted  up his face, which rejuvenated him and gave me a glimpse of another man.  \"These, sir,\" he touched the"]]]
