With your wages, you ought to live like a  prize-fighter, or the mayor of Mowbray at least.\"    \"Wages!\" said the man, \"I wish you may get 'em. Those villains, Shuffle  and Screw, have sarved me with another bate ticket: and a pretty figure  too.\"    \"Oh! the carnal monsters!\" exclaimed the widow. \"If their day don't  come, the bloody-minded knaves!\"    \"And for small cops, too! Small cops be hanged! Am I the man to send up  a bad-bottomed cop, Widow Carey?\"    \"You sent up for snicks! I have known you man and boy John Hill these  twenty summers, and never heard a word against you till you got into  Shuffle and Screw's mill. Oh! they are a bad yarn, John.\"    \"They do us all, widow. They pretends to give the same wages as the  rest, and works it out in fines. You can't come, and you can't go, but  there's a fine; you're never paid wages, but there's a bate ticket. I've  heard they keep their whole establishment on factory fines.\"    \"Soul alive, but those Shuffle and Screw are rotten, snickey, bad  yarns,\" said Mistress Carey. \"Now ma'am, if you please; fi'pence  ha'penny; no, ma'am, we've no weal left. Weal, indeed! you look very  like a soul as feeds on weal,\" continued Mrs Carey in an under tone as  her declining customer moved away. \"Well, it gets late,\" said the widow,  \"and if you like to take this scrag end home to your wife neighbour  Hill, we can talk of the rest next Saturday. And what's your will, sir?\"  said the widow with a stern expression to a youth who now stopped at her  stall.    He was about sixteen, with a lithe figure, and a handsome, faded,  impudent face. His long, loose, white trousers gave him height; he had  no waistcoat, but a pink silk handkerchief was twisted carelessly round  his neck, and fastened with a very large pin, which, whatever were  its materials, had unquestionably a very gorgeous appearance. A loose  frock-coat of a coarse white cloth, and fastened by one button round his  waist, completed his habiliments, with the addition of the covering to  his head, a high-crowned dark-brown hat, which relieved his complexion,  and heightened the effect of his mischievous blue eye.    \"Well, you need not be so fierce, Mother Carey,\" said the youth with an  affected air of deprecation.    \"Don't mother me,\" said the jolly widow with a kindling eye; \"go to your  own mother, who is dying in a back cellar without a winder, while you've  got lodgings in a two pair.\"    \"Dying; she's only drunk,\" said the youth.    \"And if she is only drunk,\" rejoined Mrs Carey in a passion, \"what makes  her drink but toil; working from five o'clock in the morning to seven  o'clock at night, and for the like of such as you.\"    \"That's a good one,\" said the youth; \"I should like to know what my  mother ever did for me, but give me treacle and laudanum when I was a  babby to stop my tongue and fill my stomach; by the token of which,  as my gal says, she stunted the growth of the prettiest figure in all  Mowbray.\" And here the youth drew himself up, and thrust his hands in  the side pockets of his pea-jacket.    \"Well, I never,\" said Mrs Carey. \"No; I never heard a thing like that!\"    \"What, not when you cut up the jackass and sold it for veal cutlets,  mother.\"    \"Hold your tongue, Mr Imperence,\" said the widow. \"It's very well known  you're no Christian, and who'll believe what you say?\"    \"It's very well known that I'm a man what pays his way,\" said the boy,  \"and don't keep a huckster's stall to sell carrion by star-light; but  live in a two pair, if you please, and has a wife and family, or as  good.\"    \"O! you aggravating imp!\" exclaimed the widow in despair, unable to  wreak her vengeance on one who kept in a secure position, and whose  movements were as nimble as his words.    \"Why, Madam Carey, what has Dandy Mick done to thee?\" said a  good-humoured voice, it came from one of two factory girls who were  passing her stall and stopped. They were gaily dressed, a light  handkerchief tied under the chin, their hair scrupulously arranged; they  wore coral neck-laces and earrings of gold.    \"Ah! is it you, my child,\" said the widow, who was a good-hearted  creature. \"The dandy has been giving me some of his imperence.\"    \"But I meant nothing, dame,\" said Mick. \"It was a joke,--only a joke.\"    \"Well, let it pass,\" said Mrs Carey. \"And where have you been this long  time, my child; and who's your friend?\" she added in a lower tone.    \"Well, I have left Mr Trafford's mill,\" said the girl.    \"That's a bad job,\" said Mrs Carey; \"for those Traffords are kind to  their people. It's a great thing for a young person to be in their  mill.\"    \"So it is,\" said the girl, \"but then it was so dull. I can't stand a  country life, Mrs Carey. I must have company.\"    \"Well, I do love a bit of gossip myself,\" said Mrs Carey, with great  frankness.    \"And then I'm no scholar,\" said the girl, \"and never could take to  learning. And those Traffords had so many schools.\"    \"Learning is better than house and land,\" said Mrs Carey; \"though I'm  no scholar myself; but then, in my time, things was different. But young  persons--\"    \"Yes,\" said Mick; \"I don't think I could get through the day, if it  wurno' for our Institute.\"    \"And what's that?\" asked Mrs Carey with a sneer.    \"The Shoddy-Court Literary and Scientific, to be sure,\" said Mick; \"we  have got fifty members, and take in three London papers; one 'Northern  Star' and two 'Moral Worlds.'\"    \"And where are you now, child?\" continued the widow to the girl.    \"I am at Wiggins and Webster's,\" said the girl; \"and this is my partner.  We keep house together; we have a very nice room in Arbour Court, No.  7, high up; it's very airy. If you will take a dish of tea with us  to-morrow, we expect some friends.\"    \"I take it kindly,\" said Mrs Carey; \"and so you keep house together! All  the children keep house in these days. Times is changed indeed!\"    \"And we shall be happy to see you, Mick; and Julia, if you are not  engaged;\" continued the girl; and she looked at her friend, a pretty  demure girl, who immediately said, but in a somewhat faultering tone,  \"Oh! that we shall.\"    \"And what are you going to do now, Caroline?\" said Mick.    \"Well, we had no thoughts; but I said to Harriet, as it is a fine night,  let us walk about as long as we can and then to-morrow we will lie in  bed till afternoon.\"    \"That's all well eno' in winter time with plenty of baccy,\" said Mick,  \"but at this season of the year I must have life. The moment I came out  I bathed in the river, and then went home and dressed,\" he added in a  satisfied tone; \"and now I am going to the Temple. I'll tell you what,  Julia has been pricked to-day with a shuttle, 'tis not much, but she  can't go out; I'll stand treat, and take you and your friend to the  Temple.\"    \"Well, that's delight,\" said Caroline. \"There's no one does the handsome  thing like you, Dandy Mick, and I always say so. Oh! I love the Temple!  'Tis so genteel! I was speaking of it to Harriet last night; she  never was there. I proposed to go with her--but two girls alone,--you  understand me. One does not like to be seen in these places, as if one  kept no company.\"    \"Very true,\" said Mick; \"and now we'll be off. Good night, widow.\"    \"You'll remember us to-morrow evening,\" said Caroline. \"To-morrow  evening! The Temple!\" murmured Mrs Carey to herself. \"I think the world  is turned upside downwards in these parts. A brat like Mick Radley to  live in a two pair, with a wife and family, or as good as he says;  and this girl asks me to take a dish of tea with her and keeps house!  Fathers and mothers goes for nothing,\" continued Mrs Carey, as she took  a very long pinch of snuff and deeply mused. \"'tis the children gets the  wages,\" she added after a profound pause, \"and there it is.\"          Book 2 Chapter 10        In the meantime Gerard and Stephen stopped before a tall, thin, stuccoed  house, ballustraded and friezed, very much lighted both within and  without, and, from the sounds that issued from it, and the persons who  retired and entered, evidently a locality of great resort and bustle. A  sign, bearing the title of the Cat and Fiddle, indicated that it was a  place of public entertainment, and kept by one who owned the legal name  of John Trottman, though that was but a vulgar appellation, lost in his  well-earned and far-famed title of Chaffing Jack.    The companions entered the spacious premises; and making their way to  the crowded bar, Stephen, with a glance serious but which indicated  intimacy, caught the eye of a comely lady, who presided over the  mysteries, and said in a low voice, \"Is he here?\"    \"In the Temple, Mr Morley, asking for you and your friend more than  once. I think you had better go up. I know he wishes to see you.\"    Stephen whispered to Gerard and after a moment's pause, he asked  the fair president for a couple of tickets for each of which he paid  threepence; a sum however, according to the printed declaration of  the voucher, convertible into potential liquid refreshments, no great  compensation to a very strict member of the Temperance Society of  Mowbray.    A handsome staircase with bright brass bannisters led them to an ample  landing-place, on which opened a door, now closed and by which sate a  boy who collected the tickets of those who would enter it. The portal  was of considerable dimensions and of architectural pretension; it was  painted of a bright green colour, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3761"],[0,"This Country of Ours (#20)"],[1,"were painted bright red, about their necks they  wore chains of white beads, and on their heads the down of white  birds.    It was a weird scene, and the flickering firelight added to its  strangeness.  Silent and still as statues the warriors stood.  Then  as John Smith was led before the chief they raised a wild shout.  As that died away to silence one of the Powhatan's squaws rose and  brought a basin of water to Smith.  In this he washed his hands,  and then another squaw brought him a bunch of feathers instead of  a towel, with which to dry them.    After this the Indians feasted their prisoner with savage splendour.  Then a long consultation took place.  What was said Smith knew not.  He only knew that his life hung in the balance.  The end of the  consultation he felt sure meant life or death for him.    At length the long talk came to an end.  Two great stones were placed  before the chief.  Then as many as could lay hands on Smith seized  him, and dragging him to the stones, they threw him on the ground,  and laid his head upon them.  Fiercely then they brandished their  clubs and Smith knew that his last hour had come, and that the  Indians were about to beat out his brains.    But the raised clubs never fell, for with a cry Pocahontas, the  chief's young daughter, sprang through the circle of warriors.  She  stood beside the prisoner pleading for his life.  But the Indians  were in no mood to listen to prayers for mercy.  So seeing that all  her entreaties were in vain she threw herself upon her knees beside  Smith, put her arms about his neck, and laid her head upon his,  crying out that if they would beat out his brains they should beat  hers out too.    Of all his many children the Powhatan loved this little daughter  best.  He could deny her nothing.  So Smith's life was saved.  He  should live, said the Powhatan, to make hatchets for him, and bells  and beads for his little daughter.    Having thus been saved, Smith was looked upon as one of the tribe.  Two days later he was admitted as such with fearsome ceremony.    Having painted and decorated himself as frightfully as he could,  the Powhatan caused Smith to be taken to a large wigwam in the  forest.  The wigwam was divided in two by a curtain and in one half  a huge fire burned.  Smith was placed upon a mat in front of the  fire and left alone.  He did not understand in the least what was  going on, and marvelled greatly what this new ceremony might mean.  But he had not sat long before the fire when he heard doleful  sounds coming from the other side of the curtain.  Then from behind  it appeared the Powhatan with a hundred others as hideously painted  as himself, and told Smith that now that they were brothers he  might go back to his fort.    So with twelve guides Smith set out.  Yet in spite of all their  feasting and ceremonies Smith scarcely believed in the friendship  of the Indians, and no one was more surprised than himself when he  at length reached Jamestown in safety.    *This chief's name was Wahunsunakok, the name of the tribe Powhatan  and the English called the chief the Powhatan.    __________            Chapter 14 - More Adventures of Captain John Smith          Smith had been away from the settlement nearly a month, and he  returned to find the colony in confusion and misery.  Many had died,  and those who remained were quarrelling among themselves.  Indeed  some were on the point of deserting and sneaking off to England in  the one little ship they had.  They were not in the least pleased  to see Smith return, and they resolved once more to get rid of  him.  So they accused him of causing the death of the two men who  had gone with him, and condemned him to death.  Thus Smith had only  escaped from the hands of the Indians to be murdered by his own  people.    The order went forth.  He was to be hanged next day.    But suddenly all was changed, for a man looking out to sea saw a  white sail. \"Ship ahoy!\" he shouted, \"ship ahoy!\"    At the joyful sound the, men forgot their bickerings, and hurrying  to the shore welcomed the new arrival.  It was Captain Newport with  his long promised help.  He soon put a stop to the hanging business,  and also set poor Captain Wingfield free.  For he had been kept  prisoner ever since he had been deposed.    Newport had brought food for the colony, but he had also brought  many new settlers.  Unfortunately, too, one day the storehouse was  set on fire, and much of the grain was destroyed.  So that in spite  of the new supplies the colony would soon again have been in the  old starving condition had it not been for Pocahontas.  She was  resolved that her beloved white chief should want for nothing,  and now every four or five days she came to the fort laden with  provisions.  Smith also took Captain Newport to visit the Powhatan,  and great barter was made of blue beads and tinsel ornaments for  grain and foodstuffs.    After a time Captain Newport sailed home again, taking the deposed  President Wingfield with him.  He took home also great tales of the  savage Emperor's might and splendour.  And King James was so impressed  with what he heard that he made up his mind that the Powhatan  should be crowned.  So in autumn Captain Newport returned again to  Jamestown, bringing with him more settlers, among them two women.  He also brought a crown and other presents to the Powhatan from  King James, together with a command for his coronation.  So Smith  made a journey to the Powhatan's village and begged him to come to  Jamestown to receive his presents.  But the Powhatan refused to go  for he was suspicious and stood upon his dignity.    \"If your King has sent me presents,\" he said, \"I also am a king,  and this is my land.  Eight days will I wait here to receive them.  Your Father Newport must come to me, not I to him.\"    So with this answer Smith went back, and seeing nothing else for  it Captain Newport set out for the Powhatan's village with the  presents.  He did not in the least want to go, but the King had  commanded that the Powhatan was to be crowned.  And the King had  to be obeyed.  He arrived safely at Weronocomoco, and the next day  was appointed for the coronation.    First the presents were brought out and set in order.  There was a  great four-poster bed with hangings and curtains of damask, a basin  and ewer and other costly novelties such as never before had been  seen in these lands.    After the gifts had been presented the Englishmen tried to place a  fine red cloak on the Powhatan's shoulders.  But he would not have  it.  He resisted all their attempts until at last one of the other  chiefs persuaded him that it would not hurt him, so at last he  submitted.    Next the crown was produced.  The Powhatan had never seen a crown,  and had no idea of its use, nor could he be made to understand that  he must kneel to have it put on.    \"A foul trouble there was,\" says one of the settlers who writes  about it.  No persuasions or explanations were of any avail.  The  Englishmen knelt down in front of him to show him what he must do.  They explained, they persuaded, until they were worn out.  It was  all in vain.  The Powhatan remained as stolid as a mule.  Kneel he  would not.    So at length, seeing nothing else for it, three of them took the  crown in their hands, and the others pressed with all their weight  upon the Powhatan's shoulders so that they forced him to stoop  a little, and thus, amid howls of laughter, the crown was hastily  thrust on his head.  As soon as it was done the soldiers fired a  volley in honour of the occasion.  At the sound the newly-crowned  monarch started up in terror, casting aside the men who held him.  But when he saw that no one was killed, and that those around him  were laughing, he soon recovered from his fright.  And thanking  them gravely for their presents he pompously handed his old shoes  and his raccoon cloak to Captain Newport as a present for King  James.  Thus this strangest of all coronations came to an end.    This senseless ceremony did no good, but rather harm.  The Powhatan  had resisted being crowned with all his might, but afterwards he was  much puffed up about it, and began to think much more of himself,  and much less of the white people.    Among others, Smith thought it was nothing but a piece of tomfoolery  and likely to bring trouble ere long.    For some months now he had been President, and as President he  wrote to the London Company, \"For the coronation of Powhatan,\" he  said, \"by whose advice you sent him such presents I know not, but  this give me leave to tell you, I fear they will be the confusion  of us all, ere we hear from you again.\"    Smith told the Company other plain truths.  They had been sending  out all sorts of idle fine gentlemen who had never done a day's  work in their lives.  They could not fell a tree, and when they  tried the axe blistered their tender fingers.  Some of them worked  indeed cheerfully enough, but it took ten of them to do as much work  as one good workman.  Others were simply stirrers up of mischief.  One  of these Smith now sent back to England \"lest the company should  cut his throat.\" And Smith begged the Company to keep those sort of  people at home in the future, and send him carpenters and gardeners,  blacksmiths and masons, and people who could do something.    Captain Newport now sailed home, and Smith was left to govern the  colony and find food for the many hungry mouths.  He went as usual  to trade with the Indians.  But he found them no longer willing to  barter their corn for a little copper or a handful of beads.  They  now wanted swords and guns.  The Powhatan too grew weary of seeing  the Pale-faces squatting on the land of which he was crowned king.  He forgot his vows of friendship With Smith.  All he wanted was to  see the Palefaces leave his country.  And the best way to get rid  of them was to starve them.    But although the Powhatan had"]]]
