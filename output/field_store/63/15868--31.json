[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47192"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 2 (#20)"],[1," On the 12th, I went to a place near Lake Erie, and spent the day in  fishing, and visiting the brethren.    _Sunday, 13_.--Was sick, and unable to attend meeting.    _Monday, 14_.--I purchased some hay and oats, and got them home.    _Tuesday, 15_.--Hauled a load of hay; and on Wednesday plowed and sowed  oats for Brother Frederick G. Williams,    [Sidenote: Deliverance of Zion Considered.]    _Thursday, April 17_.--I attended a meeting agreeable to appointment,  at which time the important subjects of the deliverance of Zion and  to building of the Lord's House in Kirtland were discussed by Elder  Rigdon. After the lecture, I requested the brethren and sisters to  contribute all the money they could for the deliverance of Zion; and  received twenty-nine dollars and sixty-eight cents.    [Sidenote: An Assault Thwarted by the Spirit.]    _April 18_.--In company with Elders Sidney Rigdon, Oliver Cowdery  and Zebedee Coltrin, I left Kirtland for New Portage, to attend a  conference; dined at W. W. Williams', in Newburg, and continuing our  journey, after dark, we were hailed by a man who desired to ride. We  were checked by the Spirit, and refused. He professed to be sick,  but in a few minutes was joined by two others, who followed us hard,  cursing and swearing; but we were successful in escaping their hands,  through the providence of the Lord, and stayed that night at a tavern,  where we were treated with civility.    [Sidenote: An Occasion of Prayer and Blessing.]    _April 19_.--Continuing our journey, dined at Brother Joseph  Bosworth's, in Copley, Medina County. Brother Bosworth was strong in  the faith, and if faithful may do much good. We arrived the same day  at Brother Jonathan Taylor's, in Norton, where we were received with  kindness. We soon retired to the wilderness, where we united in prayer  and supplication for the blessings of the Lord to be given unto His  Church. We {51} called upon the Father in the name of Jesus, to go with  the brethren who were going to the land of Zion; and that I might have  strength, and wisdom, and understanding sufficient to lead the people  of the Lord, and to gather and establish the Saints upon the land of  their inheritances, and organize them according to the will of Heaven,  that they may be no more cast down forever, We then united in the  laying on of hands.    Elders Rigdon, Cowdery and Coltrin laid their hands on my head, and  conferred upon me all the blessings necessary to qualify for me stand  before the Lord, in my calling, and return again in peace and triumph,  to enjoy the society of my brethren.    Those present then laid their hands upon the head of Elder Rigdon, and  confirmed upon him the blessings of wisdom and knowledge to preside  over the Church in my absence, also to have the Spirit to assist Elder  Cowdery in conducting the _Star_, in arranging the Book of Covenants;  and pronounced the blessings of old age and peace upon him, till Zion  is built up, and Kirtland established, till all his enemies are under  his feet, and he receive a crown of eternal life in the kingdom of God  with us.    Previous to blessing Elder Rigdon, we laid hands on Elder Oliver  Cowdery, and confirmed upon him the blessings of wisdom and  understanding sufficient for his station that he be qualified to assist  Elder Rigdon in arranging the Church Book of Covenants, which is soon  to be published, and have intelligence in all things to do the work of  printing.    After blessing Elder Rigdon, we laid our hands upon Brother Zebedee  Coltrin, and confirmed the blessings of wisdom to preach the Gospel,  even till it spreads to the islands of the seas, and to be spared to  see three score years and ten, and see Zion built up, and Kirtland  established forever, and even at last to receive a crown of life. Our  hearts rejoiced, and we were comforted with the Holy Spirit.    {52} _Sunday, April 20_.--Elder Rigdon entertained a large congregation  of Saints with an interesting discourse upon the Fullness of Times.    _April 21_.--I attended conference, and had a glorious time. Some few  volunteered to go to Zion, and others donated sixty-six dollars and  thirty-seven cents for the benefit of the scattered brethren in Zion.  The following is an extract from the minutes of the conference:        _Minutes of Conference_.        Norton, Medina County, Ohio, April 21, 1834.        This day a conference of Elders assembled at the dwelling house of      Brother Carpenter. President Joseph Smith, Jun., read the second      chapter of Joel's prophecy, prayed, and addressed the conference as      follows:        \"It is very difficult for us to communicate to the churches all      that God has revealed to us, in consequence of tradition; for we      are differently situated from any other people that ever existed      upon this earth; consequently those former revelations cannot be      suited to our conditions; they were given to other people, who      were before us; but in the last days, God was to call a remnant,      in which was to be deliverance, as well as in Jerusalem and Zion.      Now if God should give no more revelations, where will we find Zion      and this remnant? The time is near when desolation is to cover      the earth, and then God will have a place of deliverance in His      remnant, and in Zion.\"        The President then gave a relation of obtaining and translating      the Book of Mormon, the revelation of the Priesthood of Aaron, the      organization of the Church in 1830, the revelation of the High      Priesthood, and the gift of the Holy Ghost poured out upon the      Church; and said:        \"Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is      our religion? We have none; for without Zion, and a place of      deliverance, we must fall; because the time is near when the sun      will be darkened, and the moon turn to blood, and the stars fall      from heaven, and the earth reel to and fro. Then, if this is the      case, and if we are not sanctified and gathered to the places God      has appointed, with all our former professions and our great love      for the Bible, we must fall; we cannot stand; we cannot be saved;      for God will gather out His Saints from the Gentiles, and then      comes desolation and destruction, and none can escape except the      pure in heart who are gathered.\"        Elder Rigdon addressed the conference, and said:        \"On two points hang all the revelations that have ever been given,      {53} and these are the two advents of the Messiah. The first is      past, and the second is now just before us; and consequently those      who desire a part in this era which the angels desired to look      into, have to be assembled with the Saints; for if they are not      gathered, they must wail because of His coming. There is no part of      His creation which will not feel a shock at this grand display of      His power, for the ancient Saints will reign with Christ a thousand      years. The gathered Saints will dwell under that reign, and these      who are not gathered may expect to endure His wrath that length of      time; for the rest of the dead are not to live till the thousand      years are ended.        \"It is vain for men of this generation to think of laying up and      providing inheritances for their children, except they lay it up      in the place where deliverance is appointed by the voice of God;      for these are the days of vengeance, as were the days of Jeremiah;      because, before his eyes were closed in death, the Jews were led      captive, and the land possessed by another people. And so in this      day; while the father is laying up gold for his son, the destroyer      may lay him lifeless at his feet, and where then is all his      treasure? Therefore if we, the islands of the sea, and all the ends      of the earth, desire an inheritance for ourselves and our children,      and themselves and their children, it must be obtained where God      has appointed the places of deliverance.\"        Elder Rigdon adverted to the former covenants to Abraham, Isaac,      and Jacob, and others of the ancients, which were to be realized      in the last days; and spoke at some length upon the deliverance of      Zion, the endowment of the Elders with power from on high according      to former promises, and the spreading of the word of the Lord to      the four winds. He first referred to the situation of the brethren      in Missouri, and urged the importance of those who could, giving      heed to the revelations by going up to their assistance; and those      who could not go, to help those who are going with means for their      expenses.        Elder Cowdery gave a brief relation of the mobbing in Missouri, and      called for a contribution.        Elders Ambrose Palmer and Salmon Warner followed on the same      subject.        Brother Joseph Bosworth spoke on the deliverance of Zion, and said      he had no property, but if necessary for her deliverance he would      sell his clothes at auction, if he might have left him as good a      garment as the Savior had in the manger.        Others also spoke on the deliverance of Zion.        President Joseph Smith, Jun., prophesied.        \"If Zion is not delivered, the time is near when all of this      Church, wherever they may be found, will be persecuted and      destroyed in like manner.\"        {54} Elder Rigdon gave an account of the endowment of the ancient      apostles, and laid before the conference the dimensions of the      House to be built in Kirtland, and rehearsed the promise to the      Elders in the last days, which they were to realize after the House      of the Lord was built.        Brother Bosworth then related a few items of a vision, as a      testimony of those things contained in the revelation read by Elder      Rigdon, and his remarks thereon.        President Smith explained the revelation concerning"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4723"],[0,"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (#20)"],[1,"se;  and the opposites of those erroneous tenets at the same time appear to be  most fruitful Principles, from whence do flow innumerable consequences  highly advantageous to true philosophy, as well as to religion.  Particularly Matter, or the absolute existence of corporeal objects, has  been shown to be that wherein the most avowed and pernicious enemies of  all knowledge, whether human or divine, have ever placed their chief  strength and confidence. And surely, if by distinguishing the real  existence of unthinking things from their being perceived, and allowing  them a subsistance of their own out of the minds of spirits, no one thing  is explained in nature, but on the contrary a great many inexplicable  difficulties arise; if the supposition of Matter is barely precarious, as  not being grounded on so much as one single reason; if its consequences  cannot endure the light of examination and free inquiry, but screen  themselves under the dark and general pretence of \"infinites being  incomprehensible\"; if withal the removal of this Matter be not attended  with the least evil consequence; if it be not even missed in the world,  but everything as well, nay much easier conceived without it; if, lastly,  both Sceptics and Atheists are for ever silenced upon supposing only  spirits and ideas, and this scheme of things is perfectly agreeable both  to Reason and Religion: methinks we may expect it should be admitted and  firmly embraced, though it were proposed only as an hypothesis, and the  existence of Matter had been allowed possible, which yet I think we have  evidently demonstrated that it is not.    134. True it is that, in consequence of the foregoing principles, several  disputes and speculations which are esteemed no mean parts of learning,  are rejected as useless. But, how great a prejudice soever against our  notions this may give to those who have already been deeply engaged, and  make large advances in studies of that nature, yet by others we hope it  will not be thought any just ground of dislike to the principles and  tenets herein laid down, that they abridge the labour of study, and make  human sciences far more clear, compendious and attainable than they were  before.    135. Having despatched what we intended to say concerning the knowledge  of IDEAS, the method we proposed leads us in the next place to treat of  SPIRITS--with regard to which, perhaps, human knowledge is not so  deficient as is vulgarly imagined. The great reason that is assigned for  our being thought ignorant of the nature of spirits is our not having an  idea of it. But, surely it ought not to be looked on as a defect in a  human understanding that it does not perceive the idea of spirit, if it  is manifestly impossible there should be any such idea. And this if I  mistake not has been demonstrated in section 27; to which I shall here  add that a spirit has been shown to be the only substance or support  wherein unthinking beings or ideas can exist; but that this substance  which supports or perceives ideas should itself be an idea or like an  idea is evidently absurd.    136. OBJECTION.--ANSWER.--It will perhaps be said that we want a sense  (as some have imagined) proper to know substances withal, which,  if we had, we might know our own soul as we do a triangle. To this  I answer, that, in case we had a new sense bestowed upon us, we  could only receive thereby some new sensations or ideas of sense.  But I believe nobody will say that what he means by the terms soul  and substance is only some particular sort of idea or sensation.  We may therefore infer that, all things duly considered, it is  not more reasonable to think our faculties defective, in that they do not  furnish us with an idea of spirit or active thinking substance, than it  would be if we should blame them for not being able to comprehend a round  square.    137. From the opinion that spirits are to be known after the manner of an  idea or sensation have risen many absurd and heterodox tenets, and much  scepticism about the nature of the soul. It is even probable that this  opinion may have produced a doubt in some whether they had any soul at  all distinct from their body since upon inquiry they could not find they  had an idea of it. That an idea which is inactive, and the existence  whereof consists in being perceived, should be the image or likeness of  an agent subsisting by itself, seems to need no other refutation than  barely attending to what is meant by those words. But, perhaps you will  say that though an idea cannot resemble a spirit in its thinking, acting,  or subsisting by itself, yet it may in some other respects; and it is not  necessary that an idea or image be in all respects like the original.    138. I answer, if it does not in those mentioned, it is impossible it  should represent it in any other thing. Do but leave out the power of  willing, thinking, and perceiving ideas, and there remains nothing else  wherein the idea can be like a spirit. For, by the word spirit we mean  only that which thinks, wills, and perceives; this, and this alone,  constitutes the signification of the term. If therefore it is impossible  that any degree of those powers should be represented in an idea, it is  evident there can be no idea of a spirit.    139. But it will be objected that, if there is no idea signified by the  terms soul, spirit, and substance, they are wholly insignificant, or have  no meaning in them. I answer, those words do mean or signify a real  thing, which is neither an idea nor like an idea, but that which  perceives ideas, and wills, and reasons about them. What I am myself,  that which I denote by the term I, is the same with what is meant by soul  or spiritual substance. If it be said that this is only quarreling at a  word, and that, since the immediately significations of other names are  by common consent called ideas, no reason can be assigned why that which  is signified by the name spirit or soul may not partake in the same  appellation. I answer, all the unthinking objects of the mind agree in  that they are entirely passive, and their existence consists only in  being perceived; whereas a soul or spirit is an active being, whose  existence consists, not in being perceived, but in perceiving ideas and  thinking. It is therefore necessary, in order to prevent equivocation and  confounding natures perfectly disagreeing and unlike, that we distinguish  between spirit and idea. See sect. 27.    140. OUR IDEA OF SPIRIT.--In a large sense, indeed, we may be said  to have an idea or rather a notion of spirit; that is, we understand  the meaning of the word, otherwise we could not affirm or deny  anything of it. Moreover, as we conceive the ideas that are in the  minds of other spirits by means of our own, which we suppose to be  resemblances of them; so we know other spirits by means of our own  soul--which in that sense is the image or idea of them; it having  a like respect to other spirits that blueness or heat by me perceived  has to those ideas perceived by another.    141. THE NATURAL IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL IS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE  OF THE FOREGOING DOCTRINE.--It must not be supposed that they who  assert the natural immortality of the soul are of opinion that it  is absolutely incapable of annihilation even by the infinite power  of the Creator who first gave it being, but only that it is not  liable to be broken or dissolved by the ordinary laws of nature  or motion. They indeed who hold the soul of man to be only a thin  vital flame, or system of animal spirits, make it perishing and  corruptible as the body; since there is nothing more easily dissipated  than such a being, which it is naturally impossible should survive  the ruin of the tabernacle wherein it is enclosed. And this notion  has been greedily embraced and cherished by the worst part of mankind,  as the most effectual antidote against all impressions of virtue  and religion. But it has been made evident that bodies, of what frame or  texture soever, are barely passive ideas in the mind, which is more  distant and heterogeneous from them than light is from darkness. We have  shown that the soul is indivisible, incorporeal, unextended, and it is  consequently incorruptible. Nothing can be plainer than that the motions,  changes, decays, and dissolutions which we hourly see befall natural  bodies (and which is what we mean by the course of nature) cannot  possibly affect an active, simple, uncompounded substance; such a being  therefore is indissoluble by the force of nature; that is to say, \"the  soul of man is naturally immortal.\"    142. After what has been said, it is, I suppose, plain that our souls are  not to be known in the same manner as senseless, inactive objects, or by  way of idea. Spirits and ideas are things so wholly different, that when  we say \"they exist,\" \"they are known,\" or the like, these words must not  be thought to signify anything common to both natures. There is nothing  alike or common in them: and to expect that by any multiplication or  enlargement of our faculties we may be enabled to know a spirit as we do  a triangle, seems as absurd as if we should hope to see a sound. This is  inculcated because I imagine it may be of moment towards clearing several  important questions, and preventing some very dangerous errors concerning  the nature of the soul. We may not, I think, strictly be said to have an  idea of an active being, or of an action, although we may be said to have  a notion of them. I have some knowledge or notion of my mind, and its  acts about ideas, inasmuch as I know or understand what is meant by these  words. What I know, that I have some notion of. I will not say that the  terms idea and notion may not be used convertibly, if the world will have  it so; but yet it conduceth to clearness and propriety that we  distinguish things very different by different names. It is also to be  remarked that,"]]]
