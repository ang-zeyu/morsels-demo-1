[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7423"],[0,"Mike (#20)"],[1,"his,\" resumed Bob. \"I don't  propose to kiss you or anything; but, on the other hand, don't let's  go to the other extreme. I'm not saying that it isn't a bit of a brick  just missing my cap like this, but it would have been just as bad for  you if you'd been the one dropped. It's the fortune of war. I don't  want you to go about feeling that you've blighted my life, and so on,  and dashing up side-streets to avoid me because you think the sight of  you will be painful. As it isn't me, I'm jolly glad it's you; and I  shall cadge a seat in the pavilion from you when you're playing for  England at the Oval. Congratulate you.\"    It was the custom at Wrykyn, when you congratulated a man on getting  colours, to shake his hand. They shook hands.    \"Thanks, awfully, Bob,\" said Mike. And after that there seemed to be  nothing much to talk about. So Mike edged out of the room, and tore  across to Wain's.    He was sorry for Bob, but he would not have been human (which he  certainly was) if the triumph of having won through at last into the  first eleven had not dwarfed commiseration. It had been his one  ambition, and now he had achieved it.    The annoying part of the thing was that he had nobody to talk to about  it. Until the news was official he could not mention it to the common  herd. It wouldn't do. The only possible confidant was Wyatt. And Wyatt  was at Bisley, shooting with the School Eight for the Ashburton. For  bull's-eyes as well as cats came within Wyatt's range as a marksman.  Cricket took up too much of his time for him to be captain of the  Eight and the man chosen to shoot for the Spencer, as he would  otherwise almost certainly have been; but even though short of  practice he was well up in the team.    Until he returned, Mike could tell nobody. And by the time he returned  the notice would probably be up in the Senior Block with the other  cricket notices.    In this fermenting state Mike went into the house.    The list of the team to play for Wain's _v_. Seymour's on the  following Monday was on the board. As he passed it, a few words  scrawled in pencil at the bottom caught his eye.       \"All the above will turn out for house-fielding at 6.30 to-morrow     morning.--W. F.-S.\"    \"Oh, dash it,\" said Mike, \"what rot! Why on earth can't he leave us  alone!\"    For getting up an hour before his customary time for rising was not  among Mike's favourite pastimes. Still, orders were orders, he felt.  It would have to be done.          CHAPTER XIX    MIKE GOES TO SLEEP AGAIN      Mike was a stout supporter of the view that sleep in large quantities  is good for one. He belonged to the school of thought which holds that  a man becomes plain and pasty if deprived of his full spell in bed. He  aimed at the peach-bloom complexion.    To be routed out of bed a clear hour before the proper time, even on a  summer morning, was not, therefore, a prospect that appealed to him.    When he woke it seemed even less attractive than it had done when  he went to sleep. He had banged his head on the pillow six times  over-night, and this silent alarm proved effective, as it always  does. Reaching out a hand for his watch, he found that it was five  minutes past six.    This was to the good. He could manage another quarter of an hour  between the sheets. It would only take him ten minutes to wash and get  into his flannels.    He took his quarter of an hour, and a little more. He woke from a sort  of doze to find that it was twenty-five past.    Man's inability to get out of bed in the morning is a curious thing.  One may reason with oneself clearly and forcibly without the slightest  effect. One knows that delay means inconvenience. Perhaps it may spoil  one's whole day. And one also knows that a single resolute heave will  do the trick. But logic is of no use. One simply lies there.    Mike thought he would take another minute.    And during that minute there floated into his mind the question, Who  _was_ Firby-Smith? That was the point. Who _was_ he, after all?    This started quite a new train of thought. Previously Mike had firmly  intended to get up--some time. Now he began to waver.    The more he considered the Gazeka's insignificance and futility and  his own magnificence, the more outrageous did it seem that he should  be dragged out of bed to please Firby-Smith's vapid mind. Here was he,  about to receive his first eleven colours on this very day probably,  being ordered about, inconvenienced--in short, put upon by a worm who  had only just scraped into the third.    Was this right, he asked himself. Was this proper?    And the hands of the watch moved round to twenty to.    What was the matter with his fielding? _It_ was all right. Make  the rest of the team fag about, yes. But not a chap who, dash it all,  had got his first _for_ fielding!    It was with almost a feeling of self-righteousness that Mike turned  over on his side and went to sleep again.    And outside in the cricket-field, the massive mind of the Gazeka was  filled with rage, as it was gradually borne in upon him that this was  not a question of mere lateness--which, he felt, would be bad enough,  for when he said six-thirty he meant six-thirty--but of actual  desertion. It was time, he said to himself, that the foot of Authority  was set firmly down, and the strong right hand of Justice allowed to  put in some energetic work. His comments on the team's fielding that  morning were bitter and sarcastic. His eyes gleamed behind their  pince-nez.    The painful interview took place after breakfast. The head of the  house despatched his fag in search of Mike, and waited. He paced up  and down the room like a hungry lion, adjusting his pince-nez (a  thing, by the way, which lions seldom do) and behaving in other  respects like a monarch of the desert. One would have felt, looking at  him, that Mike, in coming to his den, was doing a deed which would  make the achievement of Daniel seem in comparison like the tentative  effort of some timid novice.    And certainly Mike was not without qualms as he knocked at the door,  and went in in response to the hoarse roar from the other side of it.    Firby-Smith straightened his tie, and glared.    \"Young Jackson,\" he said, \"look here, I want to know what it all  means, and jolly quick. You weren't at house-fielding this morning.  Didn't you see the notice?\"    Mike admitted that he had seen the notice.    \"Then you frightful kid, what do you mean by it? What?\"    Mike hesitated. Awfully embarrassing, this. His real reason for not  turning up to house-fielding was that he considered himself above such  things, and Firby-Smith a toothy weed. Could he give this excuse? He  had not his Book of Etiquette by him at the moment, but he rather  fancied not. There was no arguing against the fact that the head of  the house _was_ a toothy weed; but he felt a firm conviction that  it would not be politic to say so.    Happy thought: over-slept himself.    He mentioned this.    \"Over-slept yourself! You must jolly well not over-sleep yourself.  What do you mean by over-sleeping yourself?\"    Very trying this sort of thing.    \"What time did you wake up?\"    \"Six,\" said Mike.    It was not according to his complicated, yet intelligible code of  morality to tell lies to save himself. When others were concerned he  could suppress the true and suggest the false with a face of brass.    \"Six!\"    \"Five past.\"    \"Why didn't you get up then?\"    \"I went to sleep again.\"    \"Oh, you went to sleep again, did you? Well, just listen to me. I've  had my eye on you for some time, and I've seen it coming on. You've  got swelled head, young man. That's what you've got. Frightful swelled  head. You think the place belongs to you.\"    \"I don't,\" said Mike indignantly.    \"Yes, you do,\" said the Gazeka shrilly. \"You think the whole frightful  place belongs to you. You go siding about as if you'd bought it. Just  because you've got your second, you think you can do what you like;  turn up or not, as you please. It doesn't matter whether I'm only in  the third and you're in the first. That's got nothing to do with it.  The point is that you're one of the house team, and I'm captain of it,  so you've jolly well got to turn out for fielding with the others when  I think it necessary. See?\"    Mike said nothing.    \"Do--you--see, you frightful kid?\"    [Illustration: \"DO--YOU--SEE, YOU FRIGHTFUL KID?\"]    Mike remained stonily silent. The rather large grain of truth in what  Firby-Smith had said had gone home, as the unpleasant truth about  ourselves is apt to do; and his feelings were hurt. He was determined  not to give in and say that he saw even if the head of the house  invoked all the majesty of the prefects' room to help him, as he had  nearly done once before. He set his teeth, and stared at a photograph  on the wall.    Firby-Smith's manner became ominously calm. He produced a  swagger-stick from a corner.    \"Do you see?\" he asked again.    Mike's jaw set more tightly.    What one really wants here is a row of stars.           *       *       *       *       *    Mike was still full of his injuries when Wyatt came back. Wyatt was  worn out, but cheerful. The school had finished sixth for the  Ashburton, which was an improvement of eight places on their last  year's form, and he himself had scored thirty at the two hundred and  twenty-seven at the five hundred totals, which had put him in a very  good humour with the world.    \"Me ancient skill has not deserted me,\" he said, \"That's the cats. The  man who can wing a cat by moonlight can put a bullet where he likes on  a target. I didn't hit the bull every time, but that was to give the  other fellows a chance. My fatal modesty has always been a hindrance  to me in life, and I suppose it always will be. Well, well! And what  of the old homestead? Anything happened since I went away?

Has the lost will been discovered, or is there a  mortgage on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7425"],[0,"The Louisa Alcott Reader: a Supplementary Reader for the Fourth Year of School (#20)"],[1,"remarks were breathed into Johnny's willing ear about  a fortnight after the acquaintance began; and he hastened to promise,  adding soberly, a minute after,--    \"Mother says she's afraid it will be too much for me to go around and  up steps, and see new things; for I get tired so easy, and then the  pain comes on. But I don't care how I ache if I can only see the  pictures--and you.\"    \"Won't you ever be any better? Nanna thinks you might.\"    \"So does mother, if we had money to go away in the country, and eat nice  things; and have doctors. But we can't; so it's no use worrying.\" And  Johnny gave a great sigh.    \"I wish papa was rich, then he would give you money. He works hard to  make enough to go back to Italy, so I cannot ask him; but perhaps I can  sell _my_ pictures also, and get a little. Papa's friends often offer me  sweets for kisses; I will have money instead, and that will help. Yes, I  shall do it.\" And Fay clapped her hands decidedly.    \"Don't you mind about it. I'm going to learn to mend shoes. Mr. Pegget  says he'll teach me. That doesn't need legs, and he gets enough to live  on very well.\"    \"It isn't pretty work. Nanna can teach you to braid straw as she did at  home; that is easy and nice, and the baskets sell very well, she says. I  shall speak to her about it, and you can try to-morrow when you come.\"    \"I will. Do you really think I _can_ come, then?\" And Johnny stood up to  try his legs; for he dreaded the long walk, as it seemed to him.    \"I will go at once and ask papa.\"    Away flew Fay, and soon came back with a glad \"Yes!\" that sent Johnny  hobbling in to tell his mother, and beg her to mend the elbows of his  only jacket; for, suddenly, his old clothes looked so shabby he feared  to show himself to the neighbors he so longed to see.    \"Hurrah! I'm really going to-morrow. And you, too, mammy dear,\" cried  the boy, waving his crutch so vigorously that he slipped and fell.    \"Never mind; I'm used to it. Pull me up, and I'll rest while we talk  about it,\" he said cheerily, as his mother helped him to the bed, where  he forgot his pain in thinking of the delights in store for him.    Next day, the flag was flying from the wall, and Fay early at the  hole, but no Johnny came; and when Nanna went to see what kept him, she  returned with the sad news that the poor boy was suffering much, and  would not be able to stir for some days.    \"Let me go and see him,\" begged Fay, imploringly.    \"Cara mia, it is no place for you. So dark, so damp, so poor, it is  enough to break the heart,\" said Nanna, decidedly.    \"If papa was here, he would let me go. I shall not play; I shall sit  here and make some plans for my poor boy.\"    Nanna left her indignant little mistress, and went to cook a nice bowl  of soup for Johnny; while Fay concocted a fine plan, and, what was more  remarkable, carried it out.    For a week it rained, for a week Johnny lay in pain, and for a week Fay  worked quietly at her little easel in the corner of the studio, while  her father put the last touches to his fine picture, too busy to take  much notice of the child. On Saturday the sun shone, Johnny was better,  and the great picture was done. So were the small ones; for as her  father sat resting after his work, Fay went to him, with a tired but  happy face, and, putting several drawings into his hand, told her  cherished plan.    \"Papa, you said you would pay me a dollar for every good copy I made of  the cast you gave me. I tried very hard, and here are three. I want some  money very, very much. Could you pay for these?\"    \"They are excellent,\" said the artist, after carefully looking at them.  \"You _have_ tried, my good child, and here are your well-earned dollars.  What do you want them for?\"    \"To help my boy. I want him to come in here and see the pictures, and  let Nanna teach him to plait baskets; and he can rest, and you will  like him, and he might get well if he had some money, and I have three  quarters the friends gave me instead of bonbons. Would that be enough to  send poor Giovanni into the country and have doctors?\"    No wonder Fay's papa was bewildered by this queer jumble, because, being  absorbed in his work, he had never heard half the child had told him,  and had forgotten all about Johnny. Now he listened with half an ear,  studying the effect of sunshine upon his picture meantime, while Fay  told him the little story, and begged to know how much money it would  take to make Johnny's back well.    \"Bless your sweet soul, my darling, it would need more than I can spare  or you earn in a year. By and by, when I am at leisure, we will see what  can be done,\" answered papa, smoking comfortably, as he lay on the sofa  in the large studio at the top of the house.    \"You say that about a great many things, papa. 'By and by' won't be long  enough to do all you promise then. I like _now_ much better, and poor  Giovanni needs the country more than you need cigars or I new frocks,\"  said Fay, stroking her father's tired forehead and looking at him with  an imploring face.    \"My dear, I cannot give up my cigar, for in this soothing smoke I find  inspiration, and though you are a little angel, you must be clothed; so  wait a bit, and we will attend to the boy--later.\" He was going to say  \"by and by\" again, but paused just in time, with a laugh.    \"Then _I_ shall take him to the country all myself. I cannot wait for  this hateful 'by and by.' I know how I shall do it, and at once. Now,  now!\" cried Fay, losing patience; and with an indignant glance at the  lazy papa, who seemed going to sleep, she dashed out of the room, down  many stairs, through the kitchen, startling Nanna and scattering the  salad as if a whirlwind had gone by, and never paused for breath till  she stood before the garden wall with a little hatchet in her hand.    \"This shall be the country for him till I get enough money to send him  away. I will show what _I_ can do. He pulled out two bricks. _I_ will  beat down the wall, and he _shall_ come in at once,\" panted Fay; and  she gave a great blow at the bricks, bent on having her will without  delay,--for she was an impetuous little creature, full of love and pity  for the poor boy pining for the fresh air and sunshine, of which she had  so much.    Bang, bang, went the little hatchet, and down came one brick after  another, till the hole was large enough for Fay to thrust her head  through; and being breathless by that time, she paused to rest and take  a look at Johnny's court.    Meanwhile Nanna, having collected her lettuce leaves and her wits, went  to see what the child was about; and finding her at work like a little  fury, the old woman hurried up to tell \"the Signor,\" Fay's papa, that  his little daughter was about to destroy the garden and bury herself  under the ruins of the wall. This report, delivered with groans and  wringing of the hands, roused the artist and sent him to the rescue,  as he well knew that his angel was a very energetic one, and capable of  great destruction.    When he arrived, he beheld a cloud of dust, a pile of bricks among the  lilies, and the feet of his child sticking out of a large hole in the  wall, while her head and shoulders were on the other side. Much amused,  yet fearful that the stone coping might come down on her, he pulled  her back with the assurance that he would listen and help her now  immediately, if there was such need of haste.    But he grew sober when he saw Fay's face; for it was bathed in tears,  her hands were bleeding, and dust covered her from head to foot.    \"My darling, what afflicts you? Tell papa, and he will do anything you  wish.\"    \"No, you will forget, you will say 'Wait;' and now that I have seen  it all, I cannot stop till I get him out of that dreadful place. Look,  look, and see if it is not sad to live there all in pain and darkness,  and so poor.\"    As she spoke, Fay urged her father toward the hole; and to please her he  looked, seeing the dull court, the noisy street beyond, and close by  the low room, where Johnny's mother worked all day, while the poor boy's  pale face was dimly seen as he lay on his bed waiting for deliverance.    \"Well, well, it _is_ a pitiful case; and easily mended, since Fay is so  eager about it. Hope the lad is all she says, and nothing catching about  his illness. Nanna can tell me.\"    Then he drew back his head, and leading Fay to the seat, took her on his  knee, all flushed, dirty, and tearful as she was, soothing her by saying  tenderly,--    \"Now let me hear all about it, and be sure I'll not forget. What shall I  do to please you, dear, before you pull down the house about my ears?\"    Then Fay told her tale all over again; and being no longer busy, her  father found it very touching, with the dear, grimy little face looking  into his, and the wounded hands clasped beseechingly as she pleaded for  poor Johnny.    \"God bless your tender heart, child; you shall have him in here  to-morrow, and we will see what can be done for those pathetic legs of  his. But listen, Fay, I have an easier way to do it than yours, and a  grand surprise for the boy. Time is short, but it can be done; and to  show you that I am in earnest, I will go this instant and begin the  work. Come and wash your face while I get on my boots, and then we will  go together.\"    At these words Fay threw her arms about papa's neck and gave him many  grateful kisses, stopping in the midst to ask,--    \"Truly, _now_?\"    \"See if it is not so.\" And putting her down, papa went off with great  strides, while she ran laughing after him, all her doubts set at rest by  this agreeable energy on his part.    If Johnny had not been asleep in the back room, he would have seen  strange and pleasant sights that afternoon and evening; for something  went on in the court that delighted his mother, amused the artist, and  made Fay the happiest child in Boston. No one was to tell till the next  day,"]]]
