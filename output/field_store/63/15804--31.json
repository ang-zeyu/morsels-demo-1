The  outward history begins again in 1502, with a wild journey  through central Italy, which he makes as the chief engineer of  Caesar Borgia.  The biographer, putting together the stray jottings  of his manuscripts, may follow him through every day of it, up  the strange tower of Siena, elastic like a bent bow, down to the  seashore at Piombino, each place appearing as fitfully as in a  fever dream.    One other great work was left for him to do, a work all trace of  which soon vanished, The Battle of the Standard, in which he had  Michelangelo for his rival.  The citizens of Florence, desiring to  decorate the walls of the great council-chamber, had offered the  work for competition, and any subject might be chosen from the  Florentine wars of the fifteenth century.  Michelangelo chose for  his cartoon an incident of the war with Pisa, in which the  Florentine soldiers, bathing in the Arno, are surprised by the  sound of trumpets, and run to arms.  His design has reached us  only in an old engraving, which helps us less perhaps than our  remembrance of the background of his Holy Family in the Uffizii  to imagine in what superhuman form, [127] such as might have  beguiled the heart of an earlier world, those figures ascended out  of the water.  Leonardo chose an incident from the battle of  Anghiari, in which two parties of soldiers fight for a standard.  Like Michelangelo's, his cartoon is lost, and has come to us only  in sketches, and in a fragment of Rubens.  Through the accounts  given we may discern some lust of terrible things in it, so that  even the horses tore each other with their teeth.  And yet one  fragment of it, in a drawing of his at Florence, is far different--a  waving field of lovely armour, the chased edgings running like  lines of sunlight from side to side.  Michelangelo was twenty-  seven years old; Leonardo more than fifty; and Raphael, then  nineteen years of age, visiting Florence for the first time, came  and watched them as they worked.    We catch a glimpse of Leonardo again, at Rome in 1514,  surrounded by his mirrors and vials and furnaces, making strange  toys that seemed alive of wax and quicksilver.  The hesitation  which had haunted him all through life, and made him like one  under a spell, was upon him now with double force.  No one had  ever carried political indifferentism farther; it had always been  his philosophy to \"fly before the storm\"; he is for the Sforzas, or  against them, as the tide of their fortune turns.  Yet now, in the  political society of Rome, he came [128] to be suspected of secret  French sympathies.  It paralysed him to find himself among  enemies; and he turned wholly to France, which had long courted  him.    France was about to become an Italy more Italian than Italy itself.  Francis the First, like Lewis the Twelfth before him, was  attracted by the finesse of Leonardo's work; La Gioconda was  already in his cabinet, and he offered Leonardo the little Château  de Clou, with its vineyards and meadows, in the pleasant valley  of the Masse, just outside the walls of the town of Amboise,  where, especially in the hunting season, the court then frequently  resided.  A Monsieur Lyonard, peinteur du Roy pour Amboyse--  so the letter of Francis the First is headed.  It opens a prospect,  one of the most interesting in the history of art, where, in a  peculiarly blent atmosphere, Italian art dies away as a French  exotic.    Two questions remain, after much busy antiquarianism,  concerning Leonardo's death--the question of the exact form of  his religion, and the question whether Francis the First was  present at the time.  They are of about equally little importance in  the estimate of Leonardo's genius.  The directions in his will  concerning the thirty masses and the great candles for the church  of Saint Florentin are things of course, their real purpose being  immediate and practical; and on no theory of religion could these  hurried offices be of much consequence.  We forget them in  speculating [129] how one who had been always so desirous of  beauty, but desired it always in such precise and definite forms,  as hands or flowers or hair, looked forward now into the vague  land, and experienced the last curiosity.    1869.

Macmillan's 1910 Library edition  erroneously uses a space followed only by a period.

THE SCHOOL OF GIORGIONE    [130] IT is the mistake of much popular criticism to regard  poetry, music, and painting--all the various products of art--as but  translations into different languages of one and the same fixed  quantity of imaginative thought, supplemented by certain  technical qualities of colour, in painting; of sound, in music; of  rhythmical words, in poetry.  In this way, the sensuous element in  art, and with it almost everything in art that is essentially artistic,  is made a matter of indifference; and a clear apprehension of the  opposite principle--that the sensuous material of each art brings  with it a special phase or quality of beauty, untranslatable into the  forms of any other, an order of impressions distinct in kind--is the  beginning of all true aesthetic criticism.  For, as art addresses not  pure sense, still less the pure intellect, but the \"imaginative  reason\" through the senses, there are differences of kind in  aesthetic beauty, corresponding to the differences in kind of the  gifts of sense themselves. Each art, therefore, having its own  peculiar and untranslatable sensuous charm, has its own [131]  special mode of reaching the imagination, its own special  responsibilities to its material.  One of the functions of aesthetic  criticism is to define these limitations; to estimate the degree in  which a given work of art fulfils its responsibilities to its special  material; to note in a picture that true pictorial charm, which is  neither a mere poetical thought or sentiment, on the one hand, nor  a mere result of communicable technical skill in colour or design,  on the other; to define in a poem that true poetical quality, which  is neither descriptive nor meditative merely, but comes of an  inventive handling of rhythmical language, the element of song in  the singing; to note in music the musical charm, that essential  music, which presents no words, no matter of sentiment or  thought, separable from the special form in which it is conveyed  to us.    To such a philosophy of the variations of the beautiful, Lessing's  analysis of the spheres of sculpture and poetry, in the Laocoon,  was an important contribution.  But a true appreciation of these  things is possible only in the light of a whole system of such art-  casuistries.  Now painting is the art in the criticism of which this  truth most needs enforcing, for it is in popular judgments on  pictures that the false generalisation of all art into forms of poetry  is most prevalent.  To suppose that all is mere technical  acquirement in delineation or touch, working through [132] and  addressing itself to the intelligence, on the one side, or a merely  poetical, or what may be called literary interest, addressed also to  the pure intelligence, on the other:--this is the way of most  spectators, and of many critics, who have never caught sight all  the time of that true pictorial quality which lies between, unique  pledge, as it is, of the possession of the pictorial gift, that  inventive or creative handling of pure line and colour, which, as  almost always in Dutch painting, as often also in the works of  Titian or Veronese, is quite independent of anything definitely  poetical in the subject it accompanies.  It is the drawing--the  design projected from that peculiar pictorial temperament or  constitution, in which, while it may possibly be ignorant of true  anatomical proportions, all things whatever, all poetry, all ideas  however abstract or obscure, float up as visible scene or image: it  is the colouring--that weaving of light, as of just perceptible gold  threads, through the dress, the flesh, the atmosphere, in Titian's  Lace-girl, that staining of the whole fabric of the thing with a  new, delightful physical quality.  This drawing, then--the  arabesque traced in the air by Tintoret's flying figures, by  Titian's forest branches; this colouring--the magic conditions of  light and hue in the atmosphere of Titian's Lace-girl, or Rubens's  Descent from the Cross:--these essential pictorial qualities must  first of all delight the sense, delight it as [133] directly and  sensuously as a fragment of Venetian glass; and through this  delight alone become the vehicle of whatever poetry or science  may lie beyond them in the intention of the composer.  In its  primary aspect, a great picture has no more definite message for  us than an accidental play of sunlight and shadow for a few  moments on the wall or floor: is itself, in truth, a space of such  fallen light, caught as the colours are in an Eastern carpet, but  refined upon, and dealt with more subtly and exquisitely than by  nature itself.  And this primary and essential condition fulfilled,  we may trace the coming of poetry into painting, by fine  gradations upwards; from Japanese fan-painting, for instance,  where we get, first, only abstract colour; then, just a little  interfused sense of the poetry of flowers; then, sometimes,  perfect flower-painting; and so, onwards, until in Titian we have,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4065"],[0,"Side-Lights on Astronomy and Kindred Fields of Popular Science (#20)"],[1,". Crossley presented his instrument to the Lick Observatory, it was  feared that little of importance could be done with it. But as often  happens in human affairs outside the field of astronomy, when ingenious  and able men devote their attention to the careful study of a problem,  it was found that new results could be reached. Thus it was that,  before a great while, what was supposed to be an inferior instrument  proved not only to have qualities not before suspected, but to be the  means of making an important addition to the methods of astronomical  investigation.    In order that our knowledge of the position of a star may be complete,  we must know its distance. This can be measured only through the star's  parallax--that is to say, the slight change in its direction produced  by the swing of our earth around its orbit. But so vast is the distance  in question that this change is immeasurably small, except for,  perhaps, a few hundred stars, and even for these few its measurement  almost baffles the skill of the most expert astronomer. Progress in  this direction is therefore very slow, and there are probably not yet a  hundred stars of which the parallax has been ascertained with any  approach to certainty. Dr. Chase is now completing an important work of  this kind at the Yale Observatory.    To the most refined telescopic observations, as well as to the naked  eye, the stars seem all alike, except that they differ greatly in  brightness, and somewhat in color. But when their light is analyzed by  the spectroscope, it is found that scarcely any two are exactly alike.  An important part of the work of the astro-physical observatories,  especially that of Harvard, consists in photographing the spectra of  thousands of stars, and studying the peculiarities thus brought out. At  Harvard a large portion of this work is done as part of the work of the  Henry Draper Memorial, established by his widow in memory of the  eminent investigator of New York, who died twenty years ago.    By a comparison of the spectra of stars Sir William Huggins has  developed the idea that these bodies, like human beings, have a life  history. They are nebulae in infancy, while the progress to old age is  marked by a constant increase in the density of their substance. Their  temperature also changes in a way analogous to the vigor of the human  being. During a certain time the star continually grows hotter and  hotter. But an end to this must come, and it cools off in old age. What  the age of a star may be is hard even to guess. It is many millions of  years, perhaps hundreds, possibly even thousands, of millions.    Some attempt at giving the magnitude is included in every considerable  list of stars. The work of determining the magnitudes with the greatest  precision is so laborious that it must go on rather slowly. It is being  pursued on a large scale at the Harvard Observatory, as well as in that  of Potsdam, Germany.    We come now to the question of changes in the appearance of bright  stars. It seems pretty certain that more than one per cent of these  bodies fluctuate to a greater or less extent in their light.  Observations of these fluctuations, in the case of at least the  brighter stars, may be carried on without any instrument more expensive  than a good opera-glass--in fact, in the case of stars visible to the  naked eye, with no instrument at all.    As a general rule, the light of these stars goes through its changes in  a regular period, which is sometimes as short as a few hours, but  generally several days, frequently a large fraction of a year or even  eighteen months. Observations of these stars are made to determine the  length of the period and the law of variation of the brightness. Any  person with a good eye and skill in making estimates can make the  observations if he will devote sufficient pains to training himself;  but they require a degree of care and assiduity which is not to be  expected of any one but an enthusiast on the subject. One of the most  successful observers of the present time is Mr. W. A. Roberts, a  resident of South Africa, whom the Boer war did not prevent from  keeping up a watch of the southern sky, which has resulted in greatly  increasing our knowledge of variable stars. There are also quite a  number of astronomers in Europe and America who make this particular  study their specialty.    During the past fifteen years the art of measuring the speed with which  a star is approaching us or receding from us has been brought to a  wonderful degree of perfection. The instrument with which this was  first done was the spectroscope; it is now replaced with another of the  same general kind, called the spectrograph. The latter differs from the  other only in that the spectrum of the star is photographed, and the  observer makes his measures on the negative. This method was first  extensively applied at the Potsdam Observatory in Germany, and has  lately become one of the specialties of the Lick Observatory, where  Professor Campbell has brought it to its present degree of perfection.  The Yerkes Observatory is also beginning work in the same line, where  Professor Frost is already rivalling the Lick Observatory in the  precision of his measures.    Let us now go back to our own little colony and see what is being done  to advance our knowledge of the solar system. This consists of planets,  on one of which we dwell, moons revolving around them, comets, and  meteoric bodies. The principal national observatories keep up a more or  less orderly system of observations of the positions of the planets and  their satellites in order to determine the laws of their motion. As in  the case of the stars, it is necessary to continue these observations  through long periods of time in order that everything possible to learn  may be discovered.    Our own moon is one of the enigmas of the mathematical astronomer.  Observations show that she is deviating from her predicted place, and  that this deviation continues to increase. True, it is not very great  when measured by an ordinary standard. The time at which the moon's  shadow passed a given point near Norfolk during the total eclipse of  May 29, 1900, was only about seven seconds different from the time  given in the Astronomical Ephemeris. The path of the shadow along the  earth was not out of place by more than one or two miles But, small  though these deviations are, they show that something is wrong, and no  one has as yet found out what it is. Worse yet, the deviation is  increasing rapidly. The observers of the total eclipse in August, 1905,  were surprised to find that it began twenty seconds before the  predicted time. The mathematical problems involved in correcting this  error are of such complexity that it is only now and then that a  mathematician turns up anywhere in the world who is both able and bold  enough to attack them.    There now seems little doubt that Jupiter is a miniature sun, only not  hot enough at its surface to shine by its own light The point in which  it most resembles the sun is that its equatorial regions rotate in less  time than do the regions near the poles. This shows that what we see is  not a solid body. But none of the careful observers have yet succeeded  in determining the law of this difference of rotation.    Twelve years ago a suspicion which had long been entertained that the  earth's axis of rotation varied a little from time to time was verified  by Chandler. The result of this is a slight change in the latitude of  all places on the earth's surface, which admits of being determined by  precise observations. The National Geodetic Association has established  four observatories on the same parallel of latitude--one at  Gaithersburg, Maryland, another on the Pacific coast, a third in Japan,  and a fourth in Italy--to study these variations by continuous  observations from night to night. This work is now going forward on a  well-devised plan.    A fact which will appeal to our readers on this side of the Atlantic is  the success of American astronomers. Sixty years ago it could not be  said that there was a well-known observatory on the American continent.  The cultivation of astronomy was confined to a professor here and  there, who seldom had anything better than a little telescope with  which he showed the heavenly bodies to his students. But during the  past thirty years all this has been changed. The total quantity of  published research is still less among us than on the continent of  Europe, but the number of men who have reached the highest success  among us may be judged by one fact. The Royal Astronomical Society of  England awards an annual medal to the English or foreign astronomer  deemed most worthy of it. The number of these medals awarded to  Americans within twenty-five years is about equal to the number awarded  to the astronomers of all other nations foreign to the English. That  this preponderance is not growing less is shown by the award of medals  to Americans in three consecutive years--1904, 1905, and 1906. The  recipients were Hale, Boss, and Campbell. Of the fifty foreign  associates chosen by this society for their eminence in astronomical  research, no less than eighteen--more than one-third--are Americans.          VII    LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE      So far as we can judge from what we see on our globe, the production of  life is one of the greatest and most incessant purposes of nature. Life  is absent only in regions of perpetual frost, where it never has an  opportunity to begin; in places where the temperature is near the  boiling-point, which is found to be destructive to it; and beneath the  earth's surface, where none of the changes essential to it can come  about. Within the limits imposed by these prohibitory conditions--that  is to say, within the range of temperature at which water retains its  liquid state, and in regions where the sun's rays can"]]]
