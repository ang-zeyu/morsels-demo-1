'How do you guess these things?' observed Baker with some bitterness.    'Well, you are a crew,' said Norris. 'Getting out for twenty-one and  forty-eight! I see Gethryn got nine for thirty in the second innings.  He seems to have been on the spot. I suppose the wicket suited him.'    'If you can call it a wicket. Next time you specially select a pitch  for the House to play on, I wish you'd hunt up something with some  slight pretensions to decency.'    'Why, what was wrong with the pitch? It was a bit worn, that was all.'    'If,' said Baker, 'you call having holes three inches deep just where  every ball pitches being a bit worn, I suppose it was. Anyhow, it would  have been almost as well, don't you think, if you'd stopped and played  for the House, instead of going off to your rotten village match? You  were sick enough when Gethryn went off in the M.C.C. match.'    'Oh, curse,' said Norris.    For he had been hoping against hope that the parallel nature of the two  incidents would be less apparent to other people than it was to  himself.    And so it came about that Leicester's passed successfully through the  first two rounds and soared into the dizzy heights of the semi-final.          [15]    _VERSUS_ CHARCHESTER (AT CHARCHESTER)      From the fact that he had left his team so basely in the lurch on the  day of an important match, a casual observer might have imagined that  Norris did not really care very much whether his House won the cup or  not. But this was not the case. In reality the success of Jephson's was  a very important matter to him. A sudden whim had induced him to accept  his uncle's invitation, but now that that acceptance had had such  disastrous results, he felt inclined to hire a sturdy menial by the  hour to kick him till he felt better. To a person in such a frame of  mind there are three methods of consolation. He can commit suicide, he  can take to drink, or he can occupy his mind with other matters, and  cure himself by fixing his attention steadily on some object, and  devoting his whole energies to the acquisition of the same.    Norris chose the last method. On the Saturday week following his  performance for Little Bindlebury, the Beckford Eleven was due to  journey to Charchester, to play the return match against that school on  their opponents' ground, and Norris resolved that that match should be  won. For the next week the team practised assiduously, those members of  it who were not playing in House matches spending every afternoon at  the nets. The treatment was not without its effect. The team had been a  good one before. Now every one of the eleven seemed to be at the very  summit of his powers. New and hitherto unsuspected strokes began to be  developed, leg glances which recalled the Hove and Ranjitsinhji, late  cuts of Palairetical brilliance. In short, all Nature may be said to  have smiled, and by the end of the week Norris was beginning to be  almost cheerful once more. And then, on the Monday before the match,  Samuel Wilberforce Gosling came to school with his right arm in a  sling. Norris met him at the School gates, rubbed his eyes to see  whether it was not after all some horrid optical illusion, and finally,  when the stern truth came home to him, almost swooned with anguish.    'What? How? Why?' he enquired lucidly.    The injured Samuel smiled feebly.    'I'm fearfully sorry, Norris,' he said.    'Don't say you can't play on Saturday,' moaned Norris.    'Frightfully sorry. I know it's a bit of a sickener. But I don't see  how I can, really. The doctor says I shan't be able to play for a  couple of weeks.'    Now that the blow had definitely fallen, Norris was sufficiently  himself again to be able to enquire into the matter.    'How on earth did you do it? How did it happen?'    Gosling looked guiltier than ever.    'It was on Saturday evening,' he said. 'We were ragging about at home a  bit, you know, and my young sister wanted me to send her down a few  balls. Somebody had given her a composition bean and a bat, and she's  been awfully keen on the game ever since she got them.'    'I think it's simply sickening the way girls want to do everything we  do,' said Norris disgustedly.    Gosling spoke for the defence.    'Well, she's only thirteen. You can't blame the kid. Seemed to me a  jolly healthy symptom. Laudable ambition and that sort of thing.'    'Well?'    'Well, I sent down one or two. She played 'em like a book. Bit inclined  to pull. All girls are. So I put in a long hop on the off, and she let  go at it like Jessop. She's got a rattling stroke in mid-on's  direction. Well, the bean came whizzing back rather wide on the right.  I doubled across to bring off a beefy c-and-b, and the bally thing took  me right on the tips of the fingers. Those composition balls hurt like  blazes, I can tell you. Smashed my second finger simply into hash, and  I couldn't grip a ball now to save my life. Much less bowl. I'm awfully  sorry. It's a shocking nuisance.'    Norris agreed with him. It was more than a nuisance. It was a  staggerer. Now that Gethryn no longer figured for the First Eleven,  Gosling was the School's one hope. Baynes was good on his wicket, but  the wickets he liked were the sea-of-mud variety, and this summer fine  weather had set in early and continued. Lorimer was also useful, but  not to be mentioned in the same breath as the great Samuel. The former  was good, the latter would be good in a year or so. His proper sphere  of action was the tail. If the first pair of bowlers could dismiss five  good batsmen, Lorimer's fast, straight deliveries usually accounted for  the rest. But there had to be somebody to pave the way for him. He was  essentially a change bowler. It is hardly to be wondered at that Norris  very soon began to think wistfully of the Bishop, who was just now  doing such great things with the ball, wasting his sweetness on the  desert air of the House matches. Would it be consistent with his  dignity to invite him back into the team? It was a nice point. With  some persons there might be a risk. But Gethryn, as he knew perfectly  well, was not the sort of fellow to rub in the undeniable fact that the  School team could not get along without him. He had half decided to ask  him to play against Charchester, when Gosling suggested the very same  thing.    'Why don't you have Gethryn in again?' he said. 'You've stood him out  against the O.B.s and the Masters. Surely that's enough. Especially as  he's miles the best bowler in the School.'    'Bar yourself.'    'Not a bit. He can give me points. You take my tip and put him in  again.'    'Think he'd play if I put him down? Because, you know, I'm dashed if  I'm going to do any grovelling and that sort of thing.'    'Certain to, I should think. Anyhow, it's worth trying.'    Pringle, on being consulted, gave the same opinion, and Norris was  convinced. The list went up that afternoon, and for the first time  since the M.C.C. match Gethryn's name appeared in its usual place.    'Norris is learning wisdom in his old age,' said Marriott to the  Bishop, as they walked over to the House that evening.    Leicester's were in the middle of their semi-final, and looked like  winning it.    'I was just wondering what to do about it,' said Gethryn. 'What would  you do? Play, do you think?'    'Play! My dear man, what else did you propose to do? You weren't  thinking of refusing?'    'I was.'    'But, man! That's rank treason. If you're put down to play for the  School you must play. There's no question about it. If Norris knocked  you down with one hand and put you up on the board with the other,  you'd have to play all the same. You mustn't have any feelings where  the School is concerned. Nobody's ever refused to play in a first  match. It's one of the things you can't do. Norris hasn't given you  much of a time lately, I admit. Still, you must lump that. Excuse  sermon. I hope it's done you good.'    'Very well. I'll play. It's rather rot, though.'    'No, it's all right, really. It's only that you've got into a groove.  You're so used to doing the heavy martyr, that the sudden change has  knocked you out rather. Come and have an ice before the shop shuts.'    So Gethryn came once more into the team, and travelled down to  Charchester with the others. And at this point a painful alternative  faces me. I have to choose between truth and inclination. I should like  to say that the Bishop eclipsed himself, and broke all previous records  in the Charchester match. By the rules of the dramatic, nothing else is  possible. But truth, though it crush me, and truth compels me to admit  that his performance was in reality distinctly mediocre. One of his  weak points as a bowler was that he was at sea when opposed to a  left-hander. Many bowlers have this failing. Some strange power seems  to compel them to bowl solely on the leg side, and nothing but long  hops and full pitches. It was so in the case of Gethryn. Charchester  won the toss, and batted first on a perfect wicket. The first pair of  batsmen were the captain, a great bat, who had scored seventy-three not  out against Beckford in the previous match, and a left-handed fiend.  Baynes's leg-breaks were useless on a wicket which, from the hardness  of it, might have been constructed of asphalt, and the rubbish the  Bishop rolled up to the left-handed artiste was painful to witness. At  four o'clock--the match had started at half-past eleven--the  Charchester captain reached his century, and was almost immediately  stumped off Baynes. The Bishop bowled the next man first ball, the one  bright spot in his afternoon's performance. Then came another long  stand, against which the Beckford bowling raged in vain. At five  o'clock, Charchester by that time having made two hundred and forty-one  for two wickets, the left-hander ran into three figures, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6986"],[0,"Hygienic Physiology : with Special Reference to the Use of Alcoholic Drinks and (#20)"],[1,"hers.--  _Wonders of the Human Body_.] called the pericardium (_peri_,  about; and _kardia_, the heart). This secretes a lubricating fluid,  and is smooth as satin.    THE MOVEMENTS OF THE HEART consist of an alternate contraction and  expansion. The former is called the _sys'-to-le_, and the latter the  _di-as'-to-le_. During the diastole, the blood flows into the heart,  to be expelled by the systole. The alternation of these movements  constitutes the beating of the heart which we hear so distinctly between  the fifth and sixth ribs. [Footnote: Two sounds are heard if we put our  ear over the heart,--the first and longer as the blood is leading the  organ, the second as it falls into the pockets of the two arteries, and  the valves then striking together cause it. The first sound is mainly the  noise made by the muscular tissue. During the first, the two ventricles  contract; during the second the two auricles do so. The hand may feel the  heart striking the ribs as it contracts,--a feeling called the impulse,  or, if quicker and stronger than usual, palpitation. This is not always a  sign of disease, but in hypochondriacs is often an effect of the mind on  the nerves of the heart.--MAPOTHER]    FIG. 38.    [Illustration: _Chambers of the Heart_ A, _right ventricle;_ B,  _left ventricle,_ C, _right auricle,_ D, _left auricle,_ E,  _tricuspid valve,_ F, _bicuspid valve;_ G, _semilunar valves,_ H,  _valve of the aorta;_ I, _inferior vena cava,_ K, _superior vena  cava,_ L, L, _pulmonary veins._]    THE AURICLES AND VENTRICLES--The heart is divided into four chambers. In  an adult, each holds about a wineglassful. The upper ones, from appendages  on the outside resembling the ears of a dog, are called _auricles  (aures_, ears). are termed _ventricles_. The auricle and ventricle  on each side communicate with each other, but the right and left halves of  the heart are entirely distinct, and perform different offices. The left  side propels the red blood; and the right, the dark. The auricles are  merely reservoirs to receive the blood (the left auricle, as it filters in  bright and pure from the lungs; the right, as it returns dark and foul  from the tour of the body), and to furnish it to the ventricles as they  need. Their work being so light, their walls are comparatively thin and  weak. On the other hand, the ventricles force the blood (the left, to all  parts of the body; the right, to the lungs), and are, therefore, made very  strong. As the left ventricle drives the blood so much farther than the  right, it is correspondingly thicker and stronger.    NEED OF VALVES IN THE HEART.--As the auricles do not need to contract with  much force simply to empty their contents into the ventricles below them,  there is no demand for any special contrivance to prevent the blood from  setting back the wrong way. Indeed, it would naturally run down into the  ventricle, which is at that moment open to receive it. But, when the  strong ventricles contract, especially the left one, which must drive the  blood to the extremities, some arrangement is necessary to prevent it from  returning into the auricle. Besides, when they expand, the \"suction power\"  would tend to draw back again from the arteries all the blood just forced  out. This difficulty is obviated by means of little doors, or valves,  which will not let it go the wrong way. [Footnote: The heart of an ox or a  sheep may be used to show the chambers and valves. The aorta should be cut  as far as possible from the heart, and then by pumping in water the  perfection of these valves will be finely exhibited. Cutting the heart  across near the middle will show the greater thickness of the left  ventricle.]    THE TRICUSPID AND BICUSPID VALVES.--At the opening into the right  ventricle, is a valve consisting of three folds or flaps of membrane,  whence it is called the _tricuspid_ valve (_tri_, three; and  _cuspides_, points), and in the left ventricle, one containing two  flaps, and named the _bicuspid_ valve. These hang so loosely as to  oppose no resistance to the passage of the blood into the ventricles; but,  if any attempts to go the other way, it gets between the flaps and the  walls of the heart, and, driving them outward, closes the orifice.    FIG. 39.    [Illustration: _Diagram showing the peculiar Fibrous Structure of the  Heart and the Shape of the Valves._ A, _tricuspid valve,_ B,  _bicuspid valve;_ C, _semilunar valves of the aorta;_ D,  _semilunar valves of the pulmonary artery._]    THESE FLAPS ARE STRENGTHENED like sails by slender cords, which prevent  their being pressed back through the opening. If the cords were attached  directly to the walls of the heart, they would be loosened in the systole,  and so become useless when most needed. They are, therefore, fastened to  little muscular pillars projecting from the sides of the ventricle; when  that contracts, the pillars contract also, and thus the cords are held  tight.    THE SEMILUNAR VALVES.--In the passages outward from the ventricles, are  valves, called from their peculiar half-moon shape _semilunar_ valves  (_semi_, half; _Luna_, Moon). Each consists of three little  pocket-shaped folds of membrane, with their openings in the direction  which the blood is to take. When it sets back, they fill, and, swelling  out, close the passage (Fig. 40).    THE ARTERIES [Footnote: _Aer,_ air; and _tereo,_ I contain--so  named because after death they contain air only, and hence the ancients  supposed them to be air tubes leading through the body.] are the tube-like  canals which convey the blood _from_ the heart. They carry the red  blood (see note, p. 119). They are composed of an elastic tissue, which  yields at every throb of the heart, and then slowly contracting again,  keeps up the motion of the blood until the next systole. The elasticity of  the arteries acts like the air chamber of a fire engine, which converts  the intermittent jerks of the brakes or pump into the steady stream of the  hose nozzle.    The arteries sometimes communicate by means of branches or by meshes of  loops, so that if the blood be blocked in one, it can pass round through  another, and so get by the obstacle. [Footnote: This occurs especially  about the joints, where it serves to maintain the circulation during the  bending of a limb, or when the main artery is obstructed by disease or  injury, or has been tied by the surgeon. In the last case, the small  adjacent arteries gradually enlarge, and form what is called a collateral  circulation.] When an artery penetrates a muscle, it is often protected by  a sheath or by fibrous rings, which prevent its being pulled out of place  or compressed by the play of the muscles.    The arteries are generally located as far as possible beneath the surface,  out of harm's way, and hence are found closely hugging the bones or  creeping through safe passages provided for them. They are generally  nearly straight, and take the shortest routes to the parts which they are  to supply with blood.    THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM starts from the left ventricle by a single trunk--the  _aorta_--which, after giving off branches to the head, sweeps back of  the chest with a bold curve--the _arch of the aorta_ (_c_, Fig.  34)--and thence runs downward (_f_), dividing and subdividing, like a  tree, into numberless branches, which, at last, penetrate every nook and  corner of the body.    THE PULSE.--At the wrist (_k_, radial artery) and on the temple  (temporal artery) we can feel the expansion of the artery by each little  wave of blood set in motion by the contraction of the heart. In health,  there are about seventy-two [Footnote: This number varies much with age,  sex, and individuals. Napoleon's pulse is said to have been only forty,  while it is not infrequent to find a healthy pulse at one hundred or over.  In general, the pulse is quicker in children and in old people than in the  middle-aged; in short persons than in tall; in women than in men. Shame  makes the heart send more blood to the blushing cheek, and fear almost  stops it. The will can not check the heart. There is said, however, to  have been a notable exception to this in the case of one Colonel Townsend,  of Dublin, who, after having succeeded several times in stopping the  pulsation, at last lost his life in the act.] pulsations per minute. They  increase with excitement or inflammation, weaken with loss of vigor, and  are modified by nearly every disease. The physician, therefore, finds the  pulse a good index of the state of the system and the character of the  disorder. (See p. 314.)    THE VEINS are the tube-like canals which convey the blood _to_ the  heart. [Footnote: There is one exception to the general course of the  veins. The _portal_ vein carries the blood from the digestive organs  to the liver, where it is acted upon, thence poured into the ascending  vena cava, and goes back to the heart.] They carry the dark or venous  blood (note, p. 119). As they do not receive the direct impulse of the  heart, their walls are made much thinner and less elastic than those of  the arteries. At first small, they increase in size and diminish in number  as they gradually pour into one another, like tiny rills collecting to  form two rivers, the vena cava ascending and the vena cava descending  (_l, m_, Fig. 34), which empty into the right auricle.    Some of the veins creep along under the skin, where they can be seen, as  in the back of the hand; while others accompany the arteries, some of  which have two or more of these companions.    VALVES similar in construction to those already described (the semilunar  valves of the heart, page 114) are placed at convenient intervals, in  order to guide the blood in its course, and prevent its setting backward.  [Footnote: Too much standing, or tight elastics, often cause the veins in  the leg to swell, so that the valves can not work; the veins then become  _varicose_, or permanently enlarged,"]]]
