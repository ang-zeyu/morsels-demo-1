The burglar impression not only left her entirely, but left her with  the habit of dropping all contractions before she went to sleep, and  her nerves are stronger and more normal in consequence.    The two girls had each a very sensitive, nervous temperament, and  the contrast in their behavior was simply a matter of intelligence.    This same nerve specialist received a patient once who was  positively blatant in her complaint of a nervous shock. \"Doctor, I  have had a horrible nervous shock. It was horrible. I do not see how  I can ever get over it.\"    Then she told it and brought the horrors out in weird, over-vivid  colors. It was horrible, but she was increasing the horrors by the  way in which she dwelt on it.    Finally, when she paused long enough to give the doctor an  opportunity to speak, he said, very quietly: \"Madam, will you kindly  say to me, as gently as you can, 'I have had a severe nervous  shock.'\" She looked at him without a gleam of understanding and  repeated the words quietly: \"I have had a severe nervous shock.\"    In spite of herself she felt the contrast in her own brain. The  habitual blatancy was slightly checked. The doctor then tried to  impress upon her the fact that she was constantly increasing the  strain of the shock by the way she spoke of it and the way she  thought of it, and that she was really keeping herself ill.    Gradually, as she learned to relax the nervous tension caused by the  shock, a true intelligence about it all dawned upon her; the  over-vivid colors faded, and she got well. She was surprised herself  at the rapidity with which she got well, but she seemed to  understand the process and to be moderately grateful for it.    If she had had a more sensitive temperament she would have  appreciated it all the more keenly; but if she had had a more  sensitive temperament she would not have been blatant about her  shock.          CHAPTER XXI    _Contrariness_      I KNOW a woman who says that if she wants to get her father's  consent to anything, she not only appears not to care whether he  consents or not, but pretends that her wishes are exactly opposite  to what they really are. She says it never fails; the decision has  always been made in opposition to her expressed desires, and  according to her real wishes. In other words, she has learned how to  manage her father.    This example is not unique. Many of us see friends managing other  friends in that same way. The only thing which can interfere with  such astute management is the difficulty that a man may have in  concealing his own will in order to accomplish what he desires.  Wilfulness is such an impulsive quantity that it will rush ahead in  spite of us and spoil everything when we feel that there is danger  of our not getting our own way. Or, if we have succeeded in getting  our own way by what might be called the \"contrary method,\" we may be  led into an expression of satisfaction which will throw light on the  falseness of our previous attitude and destroy the confidence of the  friend whom we were tactfully influencing.    To work the \"contrary method\" to perfection requires a careful  control up to the finish and beyond it. In order never to be found  out, we have to be so consistent in our behavior that we gradually  get trained into nothing but a common every-day hypocrite, and the  process which goes on behind hypocrisy must necessarily be a process  of decay. Beside that, the keenest hypocrite that ever lived can  only deceive others up to a certain limit.    But what is one to do when a friend can only be reached by the  \"contrary method\"? What is one to do when if, for instance, you want  a friend to read a book, you know that the way to prevent his  reading it is to mention your desire? If you want a friend to see a  play and in a forgetful mood mention the fact that you feel sure the  play would delight him, you know as soon as the words are out of  your mouth you have put the chance of his seeing the play entirely  out of the question? What is one to do when something needs mending  in the house, and you know that to mention the need to the man of  the house would be to delay the repair just so much longer? How are  our contrary-minded friends to be met if we cannot pretend we do not  want what we do want in order to get their cooperation and consent?    No one could deliberately plan to be a hypocrite understanding what  a hypocrite really is. A hypocrite is a sham--a sham has nothing  solid to stand on. No one really respects a sham, and the most  intelligent, the most tactful hypocrite that ever lived is nothing  but a sham,--_false_ and a sham!    Beside, no one can manage another by the process of sham and  hypocrisy without sooner or later being found out, and when he is  found out, all his power is gone.    The trouble with the contrary-minded is they have an established  habit of resistance. Sometimes the habit is entirely inherited, and  has never been seen or acknowledged. Sometimes it has an inherited  foundation, with a cultivated superstructure.    Either way it is a problem for those who have to deal with  it,--until they understand. The \"contrary method\" does not solve the  problem; it is only a makeshift; it never does any real work, or  accomplishes any real end. It is not even lastingly intelligent.    The first necessity in dealing truly with these people is _not to be  afraid o f their resistances._ The second necessity, which is so  near the first that the two really belong side by side, is _never to  meet their resistances with resistances o f our own._    If we combat another man's resistance, it only increases his  tension. No matter how wrong he may be, and how right we are,  meeting resistance with resistance only breeds trouble. Two minds  can act and react upon one another in that way until they come to a  lock which not only makes lasting enemies of those who should have  been and could be always friends, but the contention locks up strain  in each man's brain which can never be removed without pain, and a  new awakening to the common sense of human intercourse.    If we want a friend to read a book, to go a journey, or to do  something which is more important for his own good than either, and  we know that to suggest our desire would be to rouse his resistance,  the only way is to catch him in the best mood we can, say what we  have to say, give our own preference, and at the same time feel and  express a willingness to be refused. Every man is a free agent, and  we have no right not to respect his freedom, even if he uses that  freedom to stand in his own light or in ours. If he is standing in  our light and refuses to move, we can move out of his shadow, even  though we may have to give up our most cherished desire in order to  do so.    If he is standing in his own light, and refuses to move, we can  suggest or advise and do whatever in us lies to make the common  sense of our opinion clear; but if he still persists in standing in  his own light, it is his business, not ours.    It requires the cultivation of a strong will to put a request before  a friend which we know will be resisted, and to yield to that  resistance so that it meets no antagonism in us. But when it is  done, and done thoroughly, consistently, and intelligently, the  other man's resistance reacts back upon himself, and he finds  himself out as he never could in any other way. Having found himself  out, unless his mulishness is almost past sanity, he begins to  reject his habit of resistance of his own accord.    In dealing with the contrary minded, the \"contrary method\" works so  long as it is not discovered; and the danger of its being discovered  is always imminent. The upright, direct method is according to the  honorable laws of human intercourse, and brings always better  results in the end, even though there may be some immediate failures  in the process.    To adjust ourselves rightly to another nature and go with it to a  good end, along the lines of least resistance, is of course the best  means of a real acquaintance, but to allow ourselves to manage a  fellow-being is an indignity to the man and worse than an indignity  to the mind who is willing to do the managing.    Our humanity is in our freedom. Our freedom is in our humanity. When  one, man tries to manage another, he is putting that other in the  attitude of a beast. The man who is allowing himself to be managed  is classing himself with the beasts.    Although this is a fact so evident on the base of it that it needs  neither explanation nor enlargement, there is hardly a day passes  that some one does not say to some one, \"You cannot manage me in  that way,\" and the answer should be, \"Why should you want to be  managed in any way; and why should I want to insult you by trying to  manage you at all?\"    The girl and her father might have been intelligent friends by this  time, if the practice of the \"contrary method\" had not tainted the  girl with habitual hypocrisy, and cultivated in the father the  warped mind which results from the habit of resistance, and blind  weakness which comes from the false idea that he is always having  his own way.    If we want an open brain and a good, freely working nervous system,  we must respect our own freedom and the freedom of other  people,--for only as individuals stand alone can they really  influence one another to any good end.    It is curious to see how the men of habitual resistance pride  themselves on being in bondage to no one, not knowing that the fear  of such bondage is what makes them resist, and the fear of being  influenced by another is one of the most painful forms of bondage in  which a man can be.    The men who are slaves to this fear do not stop"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4341"],[0,"Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (#20)"],[1,"dispute arose about the use of this narrow space\"  throughout the long winter. \"Scolding, or even unkind words, are  considered as a misdemeanour, if not produced under the legal form of  process, namely, the nith-song.\"(27) Close cohabitation and close  interdependence are sufficient for maintaining century after century  that deep respect for the interests of the community which is  characteristic of Eskimo life. Even in the larger communities of  Eskimos, \"public opinion formed the real judgment-seat, the general  punishment consisting in the offenders being shamed in the eyes of the  people.\"(28)    Eskimo life is based upon communism. What is obtained by hunting and  fishing belongs to the clan. But in several tribes, especially in the  West, under the influence of the Danes, private property penetrates into  their institutions. However, they have an original means for obviating  the inconveniences arising from a personal accumulation of wealth which  would soon destroy their tribal unity. When a man has grown rich, he  convokes the folk of his clan to a great festival, and, after much  eating, distributes among them all his fortune. On the Yukon river, Dall  saw an Aleonte family distributing in this way ten guns, ten full fur  dresses, 200 strings of beads, numerous blankets, ten wolf furs, 200  beavers, and 500 zibelines. After that they took off their festival  dresses, gave them away, and, putting on old ragged furs, addressed a  few words to their kinsfolk, saying that though they are now poorer than  any one of them, they have won their friendship.(29) Like distributions  of wealth appear to be a regular habit with the Eskimos, and to take  place at a certain season, after an exhibition of all that has been  obtained during the year.(30) In my opinion these distributions reveal a  very old institution, contemporaneous with the first apparition of  personal wealth; they must have been a means for re-establishing  equality among the members of the clan, after it had been disturbed by  the enrichment of the few. The periodical redistribution of land and the  periodical abandonment of all debts which took place in historical times  with so many different races (Semites, Aryans, etc.), must have been a  survival of that old custom. And the habit of either burying with the  dead, or destroying upon his grave, all that belonged to him  personally--a habit which we find among all primitive races--must have  had the same origin. In fact, while everything that belongs personally  to the dead is burnt or broken upon his grave, nothing is destroyed of  what belonged to him in common with the tribe, such as boats, or the  communal implements of fishing. The destruction bears upon personal  property alone. At a later epoch this habit becomes a religious  ceremony. It receives a mystical interpretation, and is imposed by  religion, when public opinion alone proves incapable of enforcing its  general observance. And, finally, it is substituted by either burning  simple models of the dead man's property (as in China), or by simply  carrying his property to the grave and taking it back to his house after  the burial ceremony is over--a habit which still prevails with the  Europeans as regards swords, crosses, and other marks of public  distinction.(31)    The high standard of the tribal morality of the Eskimos has often been  mentioned in general literature. Nevertheless the following remarks upon  the manners of the Aleoutes--nearly akin to the Eskimos--will better  illustrate savage morality as a whole. They were written, after a ten  years' stay among the Aleoutes, by a most remarkable man--the Russian  missionary, Veniaminoff. I sum them up, mostly in his own words:--    Endurability (he wrote) is their chief feature. It is simply colossal.  Not only do they bathe every morning in the frozen sea, and stand naked  on the beach, inhaling the icy wind, but their endurability, even when  at hard work on insufficient food, surpasses all that can be imagined.  During a protracted scarcity of food, the Aleoute cares first for his  children; he gives them all he has, and himself fasts. They are not  inclined to stealing; that was remarked even by the first Russian  immigrants. Not that they never steal; every Aleoute would confess  having sometime stolen something, but it is always a trifle; the whole  is so childish. The attachment of the parents to their children is  touching, though it is never expressed in words or pettings. The Aleoute  is with difficulty moved to make a promise, but once he has made it he  will keep it whatever may happen. (An Aleoute made Veniaminoff a gift of  dried fish, but it was forgotten on the beach in the hurry of the  departure. He took it home. The next occasion to send it to the  missionary was in January; and in November and December there was a  great scarcity of food in the Aleoute encampment. But the fish was never  touched by the starving people, and in January it was sent to its  destination.) Their code of morality is both varied and severe. It is  considered shameful to be afraid of unavoidable death; to ask pardon  from an enemy; to die without ever having killed an enemy; to be  convicted of stealing; to capsize a boat in the harbour; to be afraid of  going to sea in stormy weather; to be the first in a party on a long  journey to become an invalid in case of scarcity of food; to show  greediness when spoil is divided, in which case every one gives his own  part to the greedy man to shame him; to divulge a public secret to his  wife; being two persons on a hunting expedition, not to offer the best  game to the partner; to boast of his own deeds, especially of invented  ones; to scold any one in scorn. Also to beg; to pet his wife in other  people's presence, and to dance with her to bargain personally: selling  must always be made through a third person, who settles the price. For a  woman it is a shame not to know sewing, dancing and all kinds of woman's  work; to pet her husband and children, or even to speak to her husband  in the presence of a stranger.(32)    Such is Aleoute morality, which might also be further illustrated by  their tales and legends. Let me also add that when Veniaminoff wrote (in  1840) one murder only had been committed since the last century in a  population of 60,000 people, and that among 1,800 Aleoutes not one  single common law offence had been known for forty years. This will not  seem strange if we remark that scolding, scorning, and the use of rough  words are absolutely unknown in Aleoute life. Even their children never  fight, and never abuse each other in words. All they may say is, \"Your  mother does not know sewing,\" or \"Your father is blind of one eye.\"(33)    Many features of savage life remain, however, a puzzle to Europeans. The  high development of tribal solidarity and the good feelings with which  primitive folk are animated towards each other, could be illustrated by  any amount of reliable testimony. And yet it is not the less certain  that those same savages practise infanticide; that in some cases they  abandon their old people, and that they blindly obey the rules of  blood-revenge. We must then explain the coexistence of facts which, to  the European mind, seem so contradictory at the first sight. I have just  mentioned how the Aleoute father starves for days and weeks, and gives  everything eatable to his child; and how the Bushman mother becomes a  slave to follow her child; and I might fill pages with illustrations of  the really tender relations existing among the savages and their  children. Travellers continually mention them incidentally. Here you  read about the fond love of a mother; there you see a father wildly  running through the forest and carrying upon his shoulders his child  bitten by a snake; or a missionary tells you the despair of the parents  at the loss of a child whom he had saved, a few years before, from being  immolated at its birth, you learn that the \"savage\" mothers usually  nurse their children till the age of four, and that, in the New  Hebrides, on the loss of a specially beloved child, its mother, or aunt,  will kill herself to take care of it in the other world.(34) And so on.    Like facts are met with by the score; so that, when we see that these  same loving parents practise infanticide, we are bound to recognize that  the habit (whatever its ulterior transformations may be) took its origin  under the sheer pressure of necessity, as an obligation towards the  tribe, and a means for rearing the already growing children. The  savages, as a rule, do not \"multiply without stint,\" as some English  writers put it. On the contrary, they take all kinds of measures for  diminishing the birth-rate. A whole series of restrictions, which  Europeans certainly would find extravagant, are imposed to that effect,  and they are strictly obeyed. But notwithstanding that, primitive folk  cannot rear all their children. However, it has been remarked that as  soon as they succeed in increasing their regular means of subsistence,  they at once begin to abandon the practice of infanticide. On the whole,  the parents obey that obligation reluctantly, and as soon as they can  afford it they resort to all kinds of compromises to save the lives of  their new-born. As has been so well pointed out by my friend Elie  Reclus,(35) they invent the lucky and unlucky days of births, and spare  the children born on the lucky days; they try to postpone the sentence  for a few hours, and then say that if the baby has lived one day it must  live all its natural life.(36) They hear the cries of the little ones  coming from the forest, and maintain that, if heard, they forbode a  misfortune for the tribe; and as they have no baby-farming nor creches  for getting rid of the children, every one of them recoils before the  necessity of performing the cruel sentence; they prefer to expose the  baby in the wood rather than"]]]
