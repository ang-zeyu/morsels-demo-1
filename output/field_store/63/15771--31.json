The rock of Malta, on which so many  fortifications have been erected, is, in a maritime point of view,  an object of great importance infinitely greater, inasmuch as it  implicates the honor of France. What would the world say, if we  were to allow a solemn treaty, signed with us, to be violated! It  would doubt our energy. For my part, my resolution is fixed. I had  rather see you in possession of the Heights of Montmartre, than in  possession of Malta.\"    \"If you doubt my desire to preserve peace, listen, and judge how  far I am sincere. Though yet very young, I have attained a power,  a renown to which it would be difficult to add. Do you imagine that  I am solicitous to risk this power, this renown, in a desperate  struggle? If I have a war with Austria. I shall contrive to find  the way to Vienna. If I have a war with you, I will take from you  every ally upon the Continent. You will blockade us; but I will  blockade you in my turn. You will make the Continent a prison for  us; but I will make the seas a prison for you. However, to conclude the  war, there must be more direct efficiency. There must be assembled  150,000 men, and an immense flotilla. We must try to cross the  Strait, and perhaps I shall bury in the depths of the sea my fortune,  my glory, my life. It is an awful temerity, my lord, the invasion  of England.\" Here, to the amazement of Lord Whitworth, Napoleon  enumerated frankly and powerfully all the perils of the enterprise:  the enormous preparations it would be necessary to make of ships,  men, and munitions of war-the difficulty of eluding the English  fleet. \"The chance that we shall perish,\" said he, \"is vastly  greater than the chance that we shall succeed . Yet this temerity,  my lord, awful as it is, I am determined to hazard, if you force  me to it. I will risk my army and my life. With me that great  enterprise will have chances which it can not have with any other.  See now if I ought, prosperous, powerful, and peaceful as I now am,  to risk power, prosperity, and peace in such an enterprise. Judge,  if when I say I am desirous of peace, if I am not sincere. It is  better for you; it is better for me to keep within the limits of  treaties. You must evacuate Malta. You must not harbor my assassins  in England. Let me be abused, if you please, by the English journals,  but not by those miserable emigrants, who dishonor the protection  you grant them, and whom the Alien Act permits you to expel from  the country. Act cordially with me, and I promise you, on my part,  an entire cordiality. See what power we should exercise over the  world, if we could bring our two nations together. You have a navy,  which, with the incessant efforts of ten years, in the employment  of all resources, I should not be able to equal. But I have 500,000  men ready to march, under my command, whithersoever I choose to  lead them. If you are masters of the seas, I am master of the land.  Let us then think of uniting, rather than of going to war, and we  shall rule at pleasure the destinies of the world France and England  united, can do every thing for the interests of humanity.\"    England, however, still refused, upon one pretense and another, to  yield Malta; and both parties were growing more and more exasperated,  and were gradually preparing for the renewal of hostilities.  Napoleon, at times, gave very free utterance to his indignation.  \"Malta,\" said he, \"gives the dominion of the Mediterranean. Nobody  will believe that I consent to surrender the Mediterranean to the  English, unless I fear their power. I thus loose the most important  sea in the world, and the respect of Europe. I will fight to the  last, for the possession of the Mediterranean; and if I once get  to Dover, it is all over with those tyrants of the seas. Besides,  as we must fight, sooner or later, with a people to whom the greatness  of France is intolerable, the sooner the better. I am young. The  English are in the wrong; more so than they will ever be again. I  had rather settle the matter at once. They shall not have Malta.\"    Still Napoleon assented to the proposal for negotiating with the  English for the cession of some other island in the Mediterranean.  \"Let them obtain a port to put into,\" said he. \"To that I have no  objection. But I am determined that they shall not have two Gibraltars  in that sea, one at the entrance, and one in the middle.\" To this  proposition, however, England refused assent.    Napoleon then proposed that the Island of Malta should be placed in  the hands of the Emperor of Russia; leaving it with him in trust,  till the discussions between France and England were decided. It  had so happened that the emperor had just offered his mediation,  if that could be available, to prevent a war. This the English  government also declined, upon the plea that it did not think that  Russia would be willing to accept the office thus imposed upon her.  The English embassador now received instructions to demand that  France should cede to England, Malta for ten years; and that England,  by way of compensation, would recognize the Italian republic. The  embassador was ordered to apply for his passports, if these conditions  were not accepted within seven days. To this proposition France  would not accede. The English minister demanded his passports, and  left France. Immediately the English fleet commenced its attack  upon French merchant-ships, wherever they could be found. And the  world was again deluged in war.    France has recorded her past history and her present condition, in  the regal palaces she has reared. Upon these monumental walls are  inscribed, in letters more legible than the hieroglyphics of Egypt,  and as ineffaceable, the long and dreary story of kingly vice,  voluptuousness and pride, and of popular servility and oppression.  The unthinking tourist saunters through these magnificent saloons,  upon which have been lavished the wealth of princes and the toil  of ages, and admires their gorgeous grandeur. In marbled floors  and gilded ceilings and damask tapestry, and all the appliances of  boundless luxury and opulence, he sees but the triumphs of art, and  bewildered by the dazzling spectacle, forgets the burning outrage  upon human rights which it proclaims. Half-entranced, he wanders  through uncounted acres of groves and lawns, and parterres of  flowers, embellished with lakes, fountains, cascades, and the most  voluptuous statuary, where kings and queens have reveled, and he  reflects not upon the millions who have toiled, from dewy morn till  the shades of night, through long and joyless years, eating black  bread, clothed in coarse raiment--the man, the woman, the ox,  companions in toil, companions in thought--to minister to this  indulgence. But the palaces of France proclaim, in trumpet tones,  the shame of France. They say to her kings. Behold the undeniable  monuments of your pride, your insatiate extortion, your measureless  extravagance and luxury. They say to the people, Behold the proofs  of the outrages which your fathers, for countless ages, have endured.  They lived in mud hovels that their licentious kings might riot  haughtily in the apartments, canopied with gold, of Versailles, the  Tuileries, and St. Cloud--the Palaces of France. The mind of the  political economist lingers painfully upon them. They are gorgeous  as specimens of art. They are sacred as memorials of the past.  Vandalism alone would raze them to their foundations. Still, the  judgment says, It would be better for the political regeneration  of France, if, like the Bastile, their very foundations were plowed  up, and sown with salt. For they are a perpetual provocative to  every thinking man. They excite unceasingly democratic rage against  aristocratic arrogance. Thousands of noble women, as they traverse  those gorgeous halls, feel those fires of indignation glowing in  their souls, which glowed in the bosom of Madame Roland. Thousands  of young men, with compressed lip and moistened eye, lean against  those marble pillars, lost in thought, and almost excuse even the  demoniac and blood-thirsty mercilessness of Danton, Marat, and  Robespierre. These palaces are a perpetual stimulus and provocative  to governmental aggression. There they stand, in all their  gorgeousness, empty, swept, and garnished. They are resplendently  beautiful. They are supplied with every convenience, every luxury.  King and Emperor dwelt there. Why should not the President ? Hence  the palace becomes the home of the Republican President. The expenses  of the palace, the retinue of the palace, the court etiquette of  the palace become the requisitions of good taste. In America, the  head of the government, in his convenient and appropriate mansion,  receives a salary of twenty-five thousand dollars a year. In  France, the President of the Republic receives four hundred thousand  dollars a year, and yet, even with that vast sum, can not keep up  an establishment at all in accordance with the dwellings of grandeur  which invite his occupancy, and which unceasingly and irresistibly  stimulate to regal pomp and to regal extravagance. The palaces of  France have a vast influence upon the present politics of France.  There is an unceasing conflict between those marble walls of  monarchical splendor, and the principles of republican simplicity.  This contest will not soon terminate, and its result no one can  foresee. Never have I felt my indignation more thoroughly aroused  than when wandering hour after hour through the voluptuous sumptuousness  of Versailles. The triumphs of taste and art are admirable, beyond  the power of the pen to describe. But the moral of exeerable  oppression is deeply inscribed upon all. In a brief description of  the Palaces of France. I shall present them in the order in which  I chanced to visit them.    1.

We'll get right over the hut where the captives are, if possible,  and then descend. I'll manage the ship, and one of you can work the  electric rifle if they attack us. We'll make a dash, get Mr. and  Mrs. Illingway from the hut, and make a quick get-away.\"    It sounded good, and they were impatient to put it into operation.  That afternoon Tom and his friends went carefully over every inch of  their craft, to repair it and have it in perfect working order. Guns  were cleaned, and plenty of ammunition laid out. Then, shortly after  one o'clock in the morning the ship was sent up, and with the  searchlight ready to be turned on instantly, and with his electric  rifle near at hand, Tom Swift guided his craft on to the attack.  Soon they could see the glow of dying fires in the dwarfs' village,  but no sound came from the sleeping hordes of red imps.          CHAPTER XXIII    THE RESCUE      \"Can you make out the hut, Tom?\" asked Ned, as he stood at his  chum's side in the steering tower, and gazed downward on the silent  village.    \"Not very clearly. Suppose you take a look through the night-glasses.  Maybe you'll have better luck.\"    Ned peered long and earnestly.    \"No, I can't see a thing.\" he said. \"It all looks to be a confused  jumble of huts. I can't tell one from the other. We'll have to go  lower.\"    \"I don't want to do that,\" objected Tom. \"If this attack succeeds at  all, it will have to be sharp and quick. If we go down where they  can spot us, and work our way up to the hut where the captives are,  we'll run the chance of an attack that may put us out of business.\"    \"Yes, we ought to get right over the hut, and then make a sudden  swoop down,\" admitted Ned, \"but if we can't see it--\"    \"I have it!\" cried Tom suddenly. \"Tomba! That African can see in the  dark like a cat. Why, just before we started I dropped a wrench, and  I didn't have any matches handy to look for it. I was groping around  in the dark trying to get my hands on it, and you know it was pretty  black in the jungle. Well, along come Tomba. And he spotted it at  once and picked it up. We'll call him here and get him to point out  the hut. He can tell me how to steer.\"    \"Good!\" cried Ned, and the black was soon standing in the pilot  house. He comprehended what was wanted of him, and peered down,  seeking to penetrate the darkness.    \"Shall I go down a little lower?\" asked Tom.    For a moment Tomba did not answer. Then he uttered an exclamation of  pleasure.    \"Me see hut!\" he said, clutching Tom's arm. \"Down dere!\" He pointed,  but neither Tom nor Ned could see it. However, as Tomba was now  giving directions, telling Tom when to go to the left or the right,  as the wind currents deflected they were certain of soon reaching  the place where Mr. and Mrs. Illingway were concealed, if they were  still alive.    The Black Hawk was moving slowly, and was not under as good control  as if she had been making ninety miles an hour. As it was desired to  proceed as quietly as possible, the craft was being used as a  dirigible balloon, and the propellers were whirled around by means  of a small motor, worked by a storage battery. While not much power  was obtained this way, there was the advantage of silence, which was  very necessary. Slowly the Black Hawk sailed on through the night.  In silence the adventurers waited for the moment of action. They had  their weapons in readiness. Mr. Durban was to work the electric  rifle, as all Tom's attention would be needed at the machinery. As  soon as the craft had made a landing he was to leap out, carrying a  revolver in either hand, and, followed by Tomba, would endeavor to  gain entrance to the hut, break through the flimsy grass-woven  curtain over the doorway, and get Mr. and Mrs. Illingway out. Ned,  Mr. Damon and the other two men would stand by to fire on the red  pygmies as soon as they commenced the attack, which they would  undoubtedly do as soon as the guards of the captives raised the  alarm.    The airship was in darkness, for it would have been dangerous to  show a light. Some wakeful dwarf might see the moving illumination  in the sky, and raise a cry.    \"Mos' dere,\" announced Tomba at length. And then, for the first  time, Ned and Tom had a glimpse of the hut. It stood away from the  others, and was easy to pick out in daylight, but even the darkness  offered no handicap to Tomba. \"Right over him now,\" he suddenly  called, as he leaned out of the pilot house window, and looked down.  \"Right over place. Oh, Tomba glad when he see Missy an' Massy!\"    \"Yes, I hope you do see them,\" murmured Tom, as he pulled the lever  which would pump the gas from the inflated bag, and compress it into  tanks, until it was needed again to make the ship rise. Slowly the  Black Hawk sank down.    \"Get ready!\" called Tom in a low voice.    It was a tense moment. Every one of the adventurers felt it, and all  but Tom grasped their weapons with tighter grips. They were ready to  spring out as soon as a landing was made. Tom managed the machinery  in the dark, for he knew every wheel, gear and lever, and could have  put his hand on any one with his eyes shut. The two loaded revolvers  were on a shelf in front of him. The side door of the pilot house  was ajar, to allow him quick egress.    Tomba, armed with a big club he had picked up in the jungle, was  ready to follow. The black was eager for the fray to begin, though  how he and the others would fare amid the savages was hard to say.    Still not a sound broke the quiet. It was very dark, for nearly all  the camp fires, over which the nightly feast had been prepared, were  out. The hut could be dimly made out, however.    Suddenly there was a slight tremor through the ship. She seemed to  shiver, and bound upward a little.    \"We've landed!\" whispered Tom. \"Now for it! Come on, Tomba!\"    The big black glided after the lad like a shadow. With his two  weapons held in readiness our hero went out on deck. The others,  with cocked rifles, stood ready for the attack to open. It had been  decided that as soon as the first alarm was given by the dwarfs,  which would probably be when Tom broke into the hut, the firing  would begin.    \"Open!\" called Tom to Tomba, and the big black dashed his club  through the grass curtain over the doorway of the hut. He fairly  leaped inside, with a cry of battle on his lips.    \"Mr. Illingway! Mrs. Illingway!\" called Tom, \"We've come to save  you. Hurry out. The airship is just outside!\"    He fired one shot through the roof of the hut, so that the flash  would reveal to him whether or not the two missionaries were in the  place. He saw two forms rise up in front of him, and knew that they  were the white captives he had observed daring the former attack.    \"Oh, what is it?\" he heard the woman ask.    \"A rescue! Thank the dear Lord!\" answered her husband fervently.  \"Oh, whoever you are, God bless you!\"    \"Come quickly!\" cried Tom, \"we haven't a moment to lose!\"    He was speaking to absolute blackness now, for it was darker  immediately following the revolver flash than before. But he felt a  man's hand thrust about his arm, and he knew it was Mr. Illingway.    \"Take your wife's hand, and follow me,\" ordered Tom. \"Come, Tomba!  Are there any of the red pygmies in here?\"    He had not seen any at the weapon's flash, but his question was  answered a moment later, for there arose from within and without the  hut a chorus of wild yells. At the same time Tom felt small arms  grasp him about the legs.    \"Come on!\" he yelled. \"They're awake and after us!\"    The din outside increased. Tom heard the rifles of his friends  crack. He saw, through the torn door curtain, the flashes of fire.  Then came a blue glare, and Tom knew that Mr. Durban was using the  electric weapon.    By these intermittent gleams Tom managed to see sufficiently to  thrust Mr. and Mrs. Illingway ahead of him. Tomba was at their side.  The yells inside the hut were almost deafening. All the red dwarfs  left to guard the captives had awakened, and they could see well  enough to attack Tom. Fortunately they had no weapons, but they  fairly threw themselves upon the sturdy lad, trying to pull him  down.    \"Go on! Go on!\" he yelled to the captives, fairly pushing them  along. Then, knowing they were out of the way, he turned and fired  his two revolvers as fast as he could pull the triggers, into the  very faces of the red imps who were seeking to drag him down. Again  and again he fired, until he had emptied both cylinders of his  weapons.    He felt the grasps of the fiendish little men relax one by one. Tom  finally dragged himself loose, and staggered out of the hut. The  captives and Tomba were right in front of him. At the airship, which  loomed up in the flashes from the guns and electric rifle, Tom's  friends were giving battle. About them swarmed the hordes of  savages, with more of the imps pouring in every moment.    \"Get aboard!\" cried Tom to the missionaries. \"Get on the airship,  and we'll move out of this!\"    He felt a stinging pain in his neck, where an arrow struck him. He  tore the arrow out, and rushed forward. Fairly pushing Mr. and Mrs.  Illingway up on deck before him, Tom followed. Tomba was capering  about his master and mistress, and he swung his big club savagely.  He had not been idle, and many a red imp had gone down under his  blows.    \"Rescued! Rescued!\" murmured Mr. Illingway, as Tom hastened to the  pilot house to start the motor.          CHAPTER XXIV    TWO OTHER CAPTIVES      But the rescue was not yet accomplished. Those on the airship were  still in danger, and grave peril, for all about them were the red  savages, shouting, howling, yelling and capering about, as they were  now thoroughly aroused, and realized that their captives had been  taken away from them. They determined to get them back, and were  rallying desperately to battle."]]]
