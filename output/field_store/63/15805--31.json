Molly drew the cloak closer round her,  and shivered.    \"Cold, dear?\"    \"No.\"    \"You shivered.\"    \"It was nothing. Yes, it was,\" she went on quickly; \"it was. Father,  will you promise me something?\"    \"Of course. What?\"    \"Don't ever be angry with me like that again, will you? I couldn't  bear it. Really, I couldn't. I know it's stupid of me, but it hurt.  You don't know how it hurt.\"    \"But, my dear--\"    \"Oh, I know it's stupid. But--\"    \"But, my darling, it wasn't so. I was angry, but it wasn't with  you.\"    \"With--? Were you angry with Mr. Pitt?\"    McEachern saw that he had traveled too far. He had intended that  Jimmy's existence should be forgotten for the time being. He had  other things to discuss. But it was too late now. He must go  forward.    \"I didn't like to see you out here alone with Mr. Pitt, dear,\" he  said. \"I was afraid--\"    He saw that he must go still further forward. It was more than,  awkward. He wished to hint at the undesirability of an entanglement  with Jimmy without admitting the possibility of it. Not being a man,  of nimble brain, he found this somewhat beyond his powers.    \"I don't like him,\" he said, briefly. \"He's crooked.\"    Molly's eyes opened wide. The color had gone from her face.    \"Crooked, father?\"    McEachern perceived that he had traveled very much too far, almost  to disaster. He longed to denounce Jimmy, but he was gagged. If  Molly were to ask the question, that Jimmy had asked in the  bedroom--that fatal, unanswerable question! The price was too great to pay.    He spoke cautiously, vaguely, feeling his way.    \"I couldn't explain to you, my dear. You wouldn't understand. You  must remember, my dear, that out in New York I was in a position to  know a great many queer characters--crooks, Molly. I was working  among them.\"    \"But, father, that night at our house you didn't know Mr. Pitt. He  had to tell you his name.\"    \"I didn't know him--then,\" said her father slowly, \"but--but--\" he  paused--\"but I made inquiries,\" he concluded with a rush, \"and found  out things.\"    He permitted himself a long, silent breath of relief. He saw his way  now.    \"Inquiries?\" said Molly. \"Why?\"    \"Why?\"    \"Why did you suspect him?\"    A moment earlier, the question might have confused McEachern, but  not now. He was equal to it. He took it in his stride.    \"It's hard to say, my dear. A man who has had as much to do with  crooks as I have recognizes them when he sees them.\"    \"Did you think Mr. Pitt looked--looked like that?\" Her voice was  very small. There was a drawn, pinched expression on her face. She  was paler than ever.    He could not divine her thoughts. He could not know what his words  had done; how they had shown her in a flash what Jimmy was to her,  and lighted her mind like a flame, revealing the secret hidden  there. She knew now. The feeling of comradeship, the instinctive  trust, the sense of dependence--they no longer perplexed her; they  were signs which she could read.    And he was crooked!    McEachern proceeded. Belief made him buoyant.    \"I did, my dear. I can read them like a book. I've met scores of his  sort. Broadway is full of them. Good clothes and a pleasant manner  don't make a man honest. I've run up against a mighty high-toned  bunch of crooks in my day. It's a long time since I gave up thinking  that it was only the ones with the low foreheads and the thick ears  that needed watching. It's the innocent Willies who look as if all  they could do was to lead the cotillon. This man Pitt's one of them.  I'm not guessing, mind you. I know. I know his line, and all about  him. I'm watching him. He's here on some game. How did he get here?  Why, he scraped acquaintance with Lord Dreever in a London  restaurant. It's the commonest trick on the list. If I hadn't  happened to be here when he came, I suppose he'd have made his haul  by now. Why, he came all prepared for it! Have you seen an ugly,  grinning, red-headed scoundrel hanging about the place? His valet.  So he says. Valet! Do you know who that is? That's one of the most  notorious yegg-men on the other side. There isn't a policeman in New  York who doesn't know Spike Mullins. Even if I knew nothing of this  Pitt, that would be enough. What's an innocent man going round the  country with Spike Mullins for, unless they are standing in together  at some game? That's who Mr. Pitt is, my dear, and that's why maybe  I seemed a little put out when I came upon you and him out here  alone together. See as little of him as you can. In a large party  like this, it won't be difficult to avoid him.\"    Molly sat staring out across the garden. At first, every word had  been a stab. Several times, she had been on the point of crying out  that she could bear it no longer. But, gradually, a numbness  succeeded the pain. She found herself listening apathetically.    McEachern talked on. He left the subject of Jimmy, comfortably  conscious that, even if there had ever existed in Molly's heart any  budding feeling of the kind he had suspected, it must now be dead.  He steered the conversation away until it ran easily among  commonplaces. He talked of New York, of the preparations for the  theatricals. Molly answered composedly. She was still pale, and a  certain listlessness in her manner might have been noticed by a more  observant man than Mr. McEachern. Beyond this, there was nothing to  show that her heart had been born and killed but a few minutes  before. Women have the Red Indian instinct; and Molly had grown to  womanhood in those few minutes.    Presently, Lord Dreever's name came up. It caused a momentary pause,  and McEachern took advantage of it. It was the cue for which he had  been waiting. He hesitated for a moment, for the conversation was  about to enter upon a difficult phase, and he was not quite sure of  himself. Then, he took the plunge.    \"I have just been talking to Sir Thomas, my dear,\" he said. He tried  to speak casually, and, as a natural result, infused so much meaning  into his voice that Molly looked at him in surprise. McEachern  coughed confusedly. Diplomacy, he concluded, was not his forte. He  abandoned it in favor of directness. \"He was telling me that you had  refused Lord Dreever this evening.\"    \"Yes. I did,\" said Molly. \"How did Sir Thomas know?\"    \"Lord Dreever told him.\"    Molly raised her eyebrows.    \"I shouldn't have thought it was the sort of thing he would talk  about,\" she said.    \"Sir Thomas is his uncle.\"    \"Of course, so he is,\" said Molly, dryly. \"I forgot. That would  account for it, wouldn't it?\"    Mr. McEachern looked at her with some concern. There was a hard ring  in her voice which he did not altogether like. His greatest admirer  had never called him an intuitive man, and he was quite at a loss to  see what was wrong. As a schemer, he was perhaps a little naive. He  had taken it for granted that Molly was ignorant of the maneuvers  which had been going on, and which had culminated that afternoon in  a stammering proposal of marriage from Lord Dreever in the rose-garden.  This, however, was not the case. The woman incapable of  seeing through the machinations of two men of the mental caliber of  Sir Thomas Blunt and Mr. McEachern has yet to be born. For some  considerable time, Molly had been alive to the well-meant plottings  of that worthy pair, and had derived little pleasure from the fact.  It may be that woman loves to be pursued; but she does not love to  be pursued by a crowd.    Mr. McEachern cleared his throat, and began again.    \"You shouldn't decide a question like that too hastily, my dear.\"    \"I didn't--not too hastily for Lord Dreever, at any rate, poor  dear.\"    \"It was in your power,\" said Mr. McEachern portentously, \"to make a  man happy--\"    \"I did,\" said Molly, bitterly. \"You should have seen his face light  up. He could hardly believe it was true for a moment, and then it  came home to him, and I thought he would have fallen on my neck. He  did his very best to look heart-broken--out of politeness--but it  was no good. He whistled most of the way back to the house--all  flat, but very cheerfully.\"    \"My dear! What do you mean?\"    Molly had made the discovery earlier in their conversation that her  father had moods whose existence she had not expected. It was his  turn now to make a similar discovery regarding herself.    \"I mean nothing, father,\" she said. \"I'm just telling you what  happened. He came to me looking like a dog that's going to be  washed--\"    \"Why, of course, he was nervous, my dear.\"    \"Of course. He couldn't know that I was going to refuse him.\"    She was breathing quickly. He started to speak, but she went on,  looking straight before her. Her face was very white in the moon-light.    \"He took me into the rose-garden. Was that Sir Thomas's idea? There  couldn't have been a better setting, I'm sure. The roses looked  lovely. Presently, I heard him gulp, and I was so sorry for him! I  would have refused him then, and put him out of his misery, only I  couldn't very well till he had proposed, could I? So, I turned my  back, and sniffed at a rose. And, then, he shut his eyes--I couldn't  see him, but I know he shut his eyes--and began to say his lesson.\"    \"Molly!\"    She laughed, hysterically.    \"He did. He said his lesson. He gabbled it. When he had got as far  as, 'Well, don't you know, what I mean is, that's what I wanted to  say, you know,' I turned round and soothed him. I said I didn't love  him. He said, 'No, no, of course not.' I said he had paid me a great  compliment. He said, 'Not at all,' looking very anxious, poor  darling, as if even then he was afraid of what might come next. But  I reassured him, and he cheered up, and we walked back to the house  together, as happy as could be.\"    McEachern put his hand round her shoulders. She winced, but let it  stay. He attempted gruff conciliation.    \"My dear, you've been "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40780"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: King AEthelbert - King George III, 600 A.D. - 1776 (#20)"],[1,"pass into the king's hands.

The gates called Aldersgate and Cripplegate were in charge of  guards.  2. If a small ship came to Billingsgate, one halfpenny was paid as  toll; if a larger ship with sails, one penny was paid.    1) If a hulk or merchantman arrives and lies there, four pence is  paid as toll.    2) From a ship with a cargo of planks, one plank is given as -toll.    3) On three days of the week toll for cloth [is paid] on Sunday and  Tuesday and Thursday.    4) A merchant who came to the bridge with a boat containing fish paid  one halfpenny as toll, and for a larger ship one penny.\"    5) - 8) Foreigners with wine or blubber fish or other goods and their  tolls. (Foreigners were allowed to buy wool, melted sheep fat [tallow],  and three live pigs for their ships.)  \"3. If the town reeve or the village reeve or any other official  accuses anyone of having withheld toll, and the man replies that he has  kept back no toll which it was his legal duty to pay, he shall swear to  this with six others and shall be quit of the charge.    1) If he declares that he has paid toll, he shall produce the -man to  whom he paid it, and shall be quit of the charge.    2) If, however, he cannot produce the man to whom he paid it, he  shall pay the actual toll and as much again and five pounds to the King.    3) If he vouches the taxgatherer to warranty [asserting] that he paid  toll to him, and the latter denies it, he shall clear himself by the  ordeal and by no other means of proof.  4.

No base coin or coin defective in quality or weight, foreign or  English, may be used by a foreigner or an Englishman. (In 956, a person  found guilty of illicit coining was punished by loss of a hand.)                    Judicial Procedure            There were courts for different geographical communities:  shires, hundreds, and vills. The arrangement of the whole kingdom into  shires was completed by 975 after being united under King Edgar.            A shire was a large area of land, headed by an earl. A shire  reeve or \"sheriff\" represented the royal interests in the shires and in  the shire courts. This officer came to be selected by the king and earl  of the shire to be a judicial and financial deputy of the earl and to  execute the law. The office of sheriff, which was not hereditary, was  also responsible for the administration of royal lands and royal  accounts. The sheriff summoned the freemen holding land in the shire,  four men selected by each community or township, and all public  officers to meet twice a year at their \"shiremotes\". Actually only the  great lords - the bishops, earls, and thegns - attended. The shire  court was primarily concerned with issues of the larger landholders.  Here the freemen interpreted the customary law of the locality. The  earl declared the secular law and the bishop declared the spiritual  law. They also declared the sentence of the judges. The earl usually  took a third of the profits, such as fines and forfeits, of the shire  court, and the bishop took a share. In time, the earls each came to  supervise several shires and the sheriff became head of the shire and  assumed the earl's duties there, such as heading the shire fyrd. The  shire court also heard cases which had been refused justice at the  hundredmote and cases of keeping the peace of the shire.            The hundred was a division of the shire, having come to refer  to a geographical area rather than a number of households. The monthly  hundredmote could be attended by any freeman holding land (or a lord's  steward), but was usually attended only by reeve, thegns, parish  priest, and four representatives selected by each agrarian community or  village - usually villeins. Here transfers of land were witnessed.    The sheriff, or a reeve in his place, presided over minor local  criminal and peace and order issues. When the jurisdiction was in the  hands of a sheriff, it was called the sheriff's tourn. All residents  were expected to attend this court. When the jurisdiction was in  private hands, it was called a leet court. Leet jurisdiction derived  from sac and soke jurisdiction. Sac and soc jurisdiction was possession  of legal powers of execution and profits of justice held by a noble or  institution over inhabitants and tenants of the estate, exercised  through a private court.    The sheriff usually held each hundred court, which heard civil cases.  The suitors to these courts were the same as those of the shire courts.  They were the judges who declared the law and ordered the form of  proof, such as compurgatory oath and ordeal. They were customarily  thegns, often twelve in number. They, as well as the king and the earl,  received part of the profits of justice. Summary procedure was followed  when a criminal was caught in the act or seized after a hue and cry.  Every freeman over age twelve had to be in a hundred and had to follow  the hue and cry.            In 997, King Ethelred in a law code ordered the sheriff and  twelve leading magnates of each shire to swear to accuse no innocent  man, nor conceal any guilty one. This was the germ of the later assize,  and later still the jury.            The integrity of the judicial system was protected by certain  penalties: for swearing a false oath, bot as determined by a cleric who  has heard his confession, or, if he has not confessed, denial of burial  in consecrated ground. Also a perjurer lost his oath-worthiness.  Swearing a false oath or perjury was also punishable by loss of one's  hand or half one's wergeld. A lord denying justice, as by upholding an  evildoing thegn of his, had to pay 120s. to the king for his  disobedience. Furthermore, if a lord protected a theow of his who had  stolen, he had to forfeit the theow and pay his wer, for the first  offense, and he was liable for all he property, for subsequent  offenses. There was a bot for anyone harboring a convicted offender. If  anyone failed to attend the gemot thrice after being summoned, he was  to pay the king a fine for his disobedience. If he did not pay this  fine or do right, the chief men of the burh were to ride to him, and  take all his property to put into surety. If he did not know of a  person who would be his surety, he was to be imprisoned. Failing that,  he was to be killed. But if he escaped, anyone who harbored him,  knowing him to be a fugitive, would be liable pay his wer. Anyone who  avenged a thief without wounding anyone, had to pay the king 120s. as  wite for the assault.            \"And if anyone is so rich or belongs to so powerful a kindred,  that he cannot be restrained from crime or from protecting and  harboring criminals, he shall be led out of his native district with  his wife and children, and all his goods, to any part of the kingdom  which the King chooses, be he noble or commoner, whoever he may be -  with the provision that he shall never return to his native district.  And henceforth, let him never be encountered by anyone in that  district; otherwise he shall be treated as a thief caught in the act.\"            Courts controlled by lords of large private estates had various  kinds of jurisdiction recognized by the King: sac and soke [possession  of legal powers of execution and profits of justice held by a noble or  institution over inhabitants and tenants of the estate, exercised  through a private court], toll [right to collect a payment on the sale  of cattle and property] and team [right to hold a court to determine  the honesty of a man accused of illegal possession of cattle],  infangenetheof [the authority to judge and to hang and take the  chattels of a thief caught on the property], and utfangenetheof [the  authority to judge, punish, and take the chattels of a thief dwelling  out of his liberty, and committing theft without the same, if he were  caught within the lord's property]."]]]
