So come prepared for  _anything_. I am now going back onto voice, for the record.    \"Kinnison to the commanding officers of all fleets, sub-fleets, and  task-forces of the Galactic Patrol. Information. Subject, tactical  problem; defense of the Hill against a postulated Black Fleet of  unknown size, strength, and composition; of unknown nationality or  origin; coming from an unknown direction in space at an unknown time.    \"Kinnison to Admiral Clayton. Orders. Take over. I am relinquishing  command of the _Boise_ and the _Chicago_.\"    \"Clayton to Port Admiral Kinnison. Orders received. Taking over. I  am at the _Chicago's_ main starboard lock. I have instructed Ensign  Masterson, the commanding officer of this gig, to wait; that he is to  take you down to the Hill.\"    \"WHAT? Of all the damned....\" This was a thought, and unrecorded.    \"Sorry, Rod--I'm sorry as hell, and I'd like no end to have you along.\"  This, too, was a thought. \"But that's the way it is. Ordinary Admirals  ride the ether with their fleets. Port Admirals stay aground. I report  to you, and you run things--in broad--by remote control.\"    \"I see.\" Kinnison then Lensed a fuming thought at Samms. \"Alex  _couldn't_ do this to me--and wouldn't--and knows damn well that I'd  burn him to a crisp if he had the guts to try it. So it's _your_  doing--what in hell's the big idea?\"    \"Who's being heroic now, Rod?\" Samms asked, quietly. \"Use _your_ brain.  And then come down here, where you belong.\"    And Kinnison, after a long moment of rebellious thought and with as  much grace as he could muster, came down. Down not only to the Patrol's  familiar offices, but down into the deepest crypts beneath them. He was  glum enough, and bitter, at first: but he found much to do. Grand Fleet  Headquarters--_his_ headquarters--was being organized, and the best  efforts of the best minds and of the best technologists of three worlds  were being devoted to the task of strengthening the already extremely  strong defenses of THE HILL. And in a very short time the plates of  GFHQ showed that Admiral Clayton and Lieutenant-Admiral Schweikert were  doing a very nice job.    All of the really heavy stuff was of Earth, the Mother Planet, and  was already in place; as were the less numerous and much lighter  contingents of Mars, of Venus, and of Jove. And the fleets of the  outlying solar systems--cutters, scouts, and a few light cruisers--were  neither maintaining fleet formation nor laying course for Sol. Instead,  each individual vessel was blasting at maximum for the position in  space in which it would form one unit of a formation englobing at a  distance of light-years the entire Solarian System, and each of those  hurtling hundreds of ships was literally combing all circumambient  space with its furiously-driven detector beams.    \"Nice.\" Kinnison turned to Samms, now beside him at the master plate.  \"Couldn't have done any better myself.\"    \"After you get it made, what are you going to do with it in case  nothing happens?\" Samms was still somewhat skeptical. \"How long can you  make a drill last?\"    \"Until all the ensigns have long gray whiskers if I have to, but don't  worry--if we have time to get the preliminary globe made I'll be the  surprisedest man in the system.\"    And Kinnison was not surprised; before full englobement was  accomplished, a loud-speaker gave tongue.    \"Flagship _Chicago_ to Grand Fleet Headquarters!\" it blatted, sharply.  \"The Black Fleet has been detected. RA twelve hours, declination plus  twenty degrees, distance about thirty light-years....\"    Kinnison started to say something; then, by main force, shut himself  up. He wanted intensely to take over, to tell the boys out there  exactly what to do, but he couldn't. He was now a Big Shot--damn the  luck! He could be and must be responsible for broad policy and for  general strategy, but, once those vitally important decisions had been  made, the actual work would have to be done by others. He didn't like  it--but there it was. Those flashing thoughts took only an instant of  time.    \"... which is such extreme range that no estimate of strength or  composition can be made at present. We will keep you informed.\"    \"Acknowledge,\" he ordered Randolph; who, wearing now the five silver  bars of major, was his Chief Communications Officer. \"No instructions.\"    He turned to his plate. Clayton hadn't had to be told to pull in his  light stuff; it was all pelting hell-for-leather for Sol and Tellus.  Three general plans of battle had been mapped out by Staff. Each  had its advantages--and its disadvantages. Operation Acorn--long  distance--would be fought at, say, twelve light-years. It would keep  everything, particularly the big stuff, away from the Hill, and would  make automatics useless ... _unless_ some got past, or _unless_ the  automatics were coming in on a sneak course, or _unless_ several other  things--in any one of which cases _what_ a God-awful shellacking the  Hill would take!    He grinned wryly at Samms, who had been following his thought, and  quoted: \"A vast hemisphere of lambent violet flame, through which  neither material substance nor destructive ray can pass.\"    \"Well, that dedicatory statement, while perhaps a bit florid, was  strictly true at the time--before the days of allotropic iron and of  polycyclic drills. Now I'll quote one: 'Nothing is permanent except  change'.\"    \"Uh-huh,\" and Kinnison returned to his thinking. Operation Adack.  Middle distance. Uh-uh. He didn't like it any better now than he had  before, even though some of the Big Brains of Staff thought it the  ideal solution. A compromise. All of the disadvantages of both of the  others, and none of the advantages of either. It _still_ stunk, and  unless the Black fleet had an utterly fantastic composition Operation  Adack was out.    And Virgil Samms, quietly smoking a cigarette, smiled inwardly. Rod  the Rock could scarcely be expected to be in favor of any sort of  compromise.    That left Operation Affick. Close up. It had three tremendous  advantages. First, the Hill's own offensive weapons--as long as they  lasted. Second, the new Rodebush-Bergenholm fields. Third, no sneak  attack could be made without detection and interception. It had  one tremendous disadvantage; some stuff, and probably a lot of it,  would get through. Automatics, robots, guided missiles equipped with  super-speed drives, with polycyclic drills, and with atomic war-heads  strong enough to shake the whole world.    But with those new fields, shaking the world wouldn't be enough; in  order to get deep enough to reach Virgil Samms they would damn near  have to destroy the world. Could _anybody_ build a bomb that powerful?  He didn't think so. Earth technology was supreme throughout all known  space; of Earth technologists the North Americans were, and always had  been, tops. Grant that the Black Fleet was, basically, North American.  Grant further that they had a man as good as Adlington--or that they  could spy-ray Adlington's brain and laboratories and shops--a tall  order. Adlington himself was several months away from a world-wrecker,  unless he could put one a hundred miles down before detonation, which  simply was not feasible. He turned to Samms.    \"It'll be Affick, Virge, unless they've got a composition that is  radically different from anything I ever saw put into space.\"    \"So? I can't say that I am very much surprised.\"    The calm statement and the equally calm reply were beautifully  characteristic of the two men. Kinnison had not asked, nor had Samms  offered, advice. Kinnison, after weighing the facts, made his decision.  Samms, calmly certain that the decision was the best that could be made  upon the data available, accepted it without question or criticism.    \"We've still got a minute or two,\" Kinnison remarked. \"Don't quite know  what to make of their line of approach. Coma Berenices. I don't know  of anything at all out that way, do you? They could have detoured,  though.\"    \"No, I don't.\" Samms frowned in thought. \"Probably a detour.\"    \"Check.\" Kinnison turned to Randolph. \"Tell them to report whatever  they know; we can't wait any ...\"    As he was speaking the report came in.    The Black Fleet was of more or less normal make-up; considerably larger  than the North American contingent, but decidedly inferior to the  Patrol's present Grand Fleet. Either three or four capital ships ...    \"And we've got six!\" Kinnison said, exultantly. \"Our own two, Asia's  _Himalaya_, Africa's _Johannesburg_, South America's _Bolivar_, and  Europe's _Europa_.\"    ... Battle cruisers and heavy cruisers, about in the usual proportions;  but an unusually high ratio of scouts and light cruisers. There  were either two or three large ships which could not be classified  definitely at that distance; long-range observers were going out to  study them.    \"Tell Clayton,\" Kinnison instructed Randolph, \"that it is to be  Operation Affick, and for him to fly at it.\"    \"Report continued,\" the speaker came to life again. \"There are three  capital ships, apparently of approximately the _Chicago_ class, but  tear-drop-shaped instead of spherical ...\"    \"Ouch!\" Kinnison flashed a thought at Samms. \"I don't like that. They  can both fight and run.\"    \"... The battle cruisers are also tear-drops. The small vessels are  torpedo-shaped. There are three of the large ships, which we are  still not able to classify definitely. They are spherical in shape,  and very large, but do not seem to be either armed or screened, and  are apparently carriers--possibly of automatics.

It has been commonly regarded as simply a slow chemical  change, but its general similarity to other fermentative processes  is so great that we can have little hesitation in attributing it  to micro-organisms, and doubtless to some forms of plants allied  to bacteria. There is no reason for doubting that bacteria existed  in the geological ages with essentially the same powers as they  now possess, and to some forms of bacteria which grow in the  absence of oxygen can we probably attribute the slow change which  has produced coal. Here, then, is another great source of wealth  in Nature for which we are dependent upon bacteria. While, of  course, water and pressure were very essential factors in the  deposition of coal, it was a peculiar kind of fermentation  occurring in the vegetation that brought about the chemical  changes in it which resulted in its transformation into coal. The  vegetation of the carboniferous age was dependent upon the  nitrogen fixed by the bacteria, and to these organisms also do we  owe the fact that this vegetation was stored for us in the rocks.            CHAPTER V.    PARASITIC BACTERIA AND THEIR RELATION TO DISEASE.      Perhaps the most universally known fact in regard to bacteria is  that they are the cause of disease. It is this fact that has made  them objects of such wide interest. This is the side of the  subject that first attracted attention, has been most studied, and  in regard to which there has been the greatest accumulation of  evidence. So persistently has the relation of bacteria to disease  been discussed and emphasized that the majority of readers are  hardly able to disassociate the two. To most people the very word  bacteria is almost equivalent to disease, and the thought of  swallowing microbes in drinking water or milk is decidedly  repugnant and alarming. In the public mind it is only necessary to  demonstrate that an article holds bacteria to throw it under  condemnation.    We have already seen that bacteria are to be regarded as agents  for good, and that from their fundamental relation to plant life  they must be looked upon as our friends rather than as our  enemies. It is true that there is another side to the story which  relates to the parasitic species. These parasitic forms may do us  direct or indirect injury. But the species of bacteria which are  capable of doing us any injury, the pathogenic bacteria, are  really very few compared to the great host of species which are  harmless. A small number of species, perhaps a score or two, are  pathogenic, while a much larger number, amounting to hundreds and  perhaps thousands of species, are perfectly harmless. This latter  class do no injury even though swallowed by man in thousands. They  are not parasitic, and are unable to grow in the body of man.  Their presence is entirely consistent with the most perfect  health, and, indeed, there are some reasons for believing that  they are sometimes directly beneficial to health. It is entirely  unjust to condemn all bacteria because a few chance to produce  mischief. Bacteria in general are agents for good rather than ill.    There are, however, some species which cause mankind much trouble  by interfering in one way or another with the normal processes of  life. These pathogenic bacteria, or disease germs, do not all act  alike, but bring about injury to man in a number of different  ways. We may recognise two different classes among them, which,  however, we shall see are connected by intermediate types. These  two classes are, first, the pathogenic bacteria, which are not  strictly parasitic but live free in Nature; and, second, those  which live as true parasites in the bodies of man or other  animals. To understand the real relation of these two classes, we  must first notice the method by which bacteria in general produce  disease.    METHOD BY WHICH BACTERIA PRODUCE DISEASE.    Since it was first clearly recognised that certain species of  bacteria have the power of producing disease, the question as to  how they do so has ever been a prominent one Even if they do grow  in the body, why should their presence give rise to the symptoms  characterizing disease? Various answers to this question have been  given in the past It has been suggested that in their growth they  consume the food of the body and thus exhaust it, that they  produce an oxidation of the body tissues, or that they produce a  reduction of these tissues, or that they mechanically interfere  with the circulation None of these suggestions have proved of much  value Another view was early advanced, and has stood the test of  time. This claim is that the bacteria while growing in the body  produce poisons, and these poisons then have a direct action on  the body We have already noticed that bacteria during their growth  in any medium produce a large number of biproducts of  decomposition. We noticed also that among these biproducts there  are some which have a poisonous nature; so poisonous are they that  when inoculated into the body of an animal they may produce  poisoning and death. We have only to suppose that the pathogenic  bacteria, when growing as parasites in man, produce such poisons,  and we have at once an explanation of the method by which they  give rise to disease.    This explanation of germ disease is more than simple theory. It  has been in many cases clearly demonstrated. It has been found  that the bacteria which cause diphtheria, tetanus, typhoid,  tuberculosis, and many other diseases, produce, even when growing  in common culture media, poisons which are of a very violent  nature. These poisons when inoculated into the bodies of animals  give rise to much the same symptoms as the bacteria do themselves  when growing as parasites in the animals. The chief difference in  the results from inoculating an animal with the poison and with  the living bacteria is in the rapidity of the action. When the  poison is injected the poisoning symptoms are almost immediately  seen, but when the living bacteria are inoculated the effect is  only seen after several days or longer, not, in short, until the  inoculated bacteria have had time enough to grow in the body and  produce the poison in quantity. It has not by any means been shown  that all pathogenic germs produce their effect in this way, but it  has been proved to be the real method in quite a number of cases,  and is extremely probable in others. While some bacteria perhaps  produce results by a different method, we must recognise the  production of poisons as at all events the common direct cause of  the symptoms of disease. This explanation will enable us more  clearly to understand the relation of different bacteria to  disease.    PATHOGENIC GERMS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY PARASITIC    Recognising that bacteria may produce poisons, we readily see that  it is not always necessary that they should be parasites in order  to produce trouble. In their ordinary growth in Nature such  bacteria will produce no trouble The poisons will be produced in  decaying material but will seldom be taken into the human body.  These poisons, produced in the first stages of putrefaction, are  oxidized by further stages of decomposition into harmless  products. But should it happen that some of these bacteria  obtained a chance to grow vigorously for a while in organic  products that are subsequently swallowed as man's food, it is  plain that evil results might follow. If such food is swallowed by  man after the bacteria have produced their poisonous bodies, it  will tend to produce an immediate poisoning of his system. The  effect may be sudden and severe if considerable quantity of the  poisonous material is swallowed, or slight but protracted if small  quantities are repeatedly consumed in food. Such instances are not  uncommon. Well-known examples are cases of ice-cream poisoning,  poisoning from eating cheese or from drinking milk, or in not a  few instances from eating fish or meats within which bacteria have  had opportunity for growth. In all these cases the poison is  swallowed in quantity sufficient to give rise quickly to severe  symptoms, sometimes resulting fatally, and at other times passing  off as soon as the body succeeds in throwing off the poisons. In  other cases still, however, the amount of poison swallowed may be  very slight, too slight to produce much effect unless the same be  consumed repeatedly. All such trouble may be attributed to  fermented or partly decayed food. It is difficult to distinguish  such instances from others produced in a slightly different way,  as follows:    It may happen that the bacteria which grow in food products  continue to grow in the food even after it is swallowed and has  passed into the stomach or intestines. This appears particularly  true of milk bacteria. Under these conditions the bacteria are not  in any proper sense parasitic, since they are simply living in and  feeding upon the same food which they consume outside the body,  and are not feeding upon the tissues of man. The poisons which  they produce will continue to be developed as long as the bacteria  continue to grow, whether in a milk pail or a human stomach. If  now the poisons are absorbed by the body, they may produce a mild  or severe disease which will be more or less lasting, continuing  perhaps as long as the same food and the same bacteria are  supplied to the individual. The most important disease of this  class appears to be the dreaded cholera infantum, so common among  infants who feed upon cow's milk in warm weather. It is easy to  understand the nature of this disease when we remember the great  number of bacteria in milk, especially in hot weather, and when we  remember that the delicate organism of the infant will be thrown  at once into disorder by slight amounts of poison which would have  no"]]]
