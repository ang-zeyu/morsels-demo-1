Industry is concentrated mainly in the      populous Flemish area in the north, although the government is encouraging      reinvestment in the southern region of Walloon. With few natural resources      Belgium must import essential raw materials, making its economy closely      dependent on the state of world markets. Over 70% of trade is with other EC      countries. During the period 1988-90, Belgium's economic performance was      marked by 4% average growth, moderate inflation, and a substantial external      surplus. Growth fell to 1.4% in 1991.  GDP:      purchasing power equivalent - $171.8 billion, per capita $17,300; real      growth rate 1.4% (1991 est.)

The  Incubator never worries, you know.\"    King John Dough had brought for Ozma's birthday present a lovely  gingerbread crown, with rows of small pearls around it and a fine big  pearl in each of its five points.  After this had been received by  Dorothy with proper thanks and placed on the table with the other  presents, the visitors from Hiland and Loland were escorted to their  rooms by the High Chamberlain.    They had no sooner departed than the band before the palace began to  play again, announcing more arrivals, and as these were doubtless from  foreign parts the High Chamberlain hurried back to receive them in his  most official manner.          22.  Important Arrivals      First entered a band of Ryls from the Happy Valley, all merry little  sprites like fairy elves.  A dozen crooked Knooks followed from the  great Forest of Burzee.  They had long whiskers and pointed caps and  curling toes, yet were no taller than Button-Bright's shoulder.  With  this group came a man so easy to recognize and so important and dearly  beloved throughout the known world, that all present rose to their feet  and bowed their heads in respectful homage, even before the High  Chamberlain knelt to announce his name.    \"The most Mighty and Loyal Friend of Children, His Supreme  Highness--Santa Claus!\"  said the Chamberlain, in an awed voice.    \"Well, well, well!  Glad to see you--glad to meet you all!\" cried Santa  Claus, briskly, as he trotted up the long room.    He was round as an apple, with a fresh rosy face, laughing eyes, and a  bushy beard as white as snow.  A red cloak trimmed with beautiful  ermine hung from his shoulders and upon his back was a basket filled  with pretty presents for the Princess Ozma.    \"Hello, Dorothy; still having adventures?\" he asked in his jolly way,  as he took the girl's hand in both his own.    \"How did you know my name, Santa?\" she replied, feeling more shy in the  presence of this immortal saint than she ever had before in her young  life.    \"Why, don't I see you every Christmas Eve, when you're asleep?\" he  rejoined, pinching her blushing cheek.    \"Oh, do you?\"    \"And here's Button-Bright, I declare!\" cried Santa Claus, holding up  the boy to kiss him.  \"What a long way from home you are; dear me!\"    \"Do you know Button-Bright, too?\" questioned Dorothy, eagerly.    \"Indeed I do.  I've visited his home several Christmas Eves.\"    \"And do you know his father?\" asked the girl.    \"Certainly, my dear.  Who else do you suppose brings him his Christmas  neckties and stockings?\" with a sly wink at the Wizard.    \"Then where does he live?  We're just crazy to know, 'cause  Button-Bright's lost,\" she said.    Santa laughed and laid his finger aside of his nose as if thinking what  to reply.  He leaned over and whispered something in the Wizard's ear,  at which the Wizard smiled and nodded as if he understood.    Now Santa Claus spied Polychrome, and trotted over to where she stood.    \"Seems to me the Rainbow's Daughter is farther from home than any of  you,\" he observed, looking at the pretty maiden admiringly.  \"I'll have  to tell your father where you are, Polly, and send him to get you.\"    \"Please do, dear Santa Claus,\" implored the little maid, beseechingly.    \"But just now we must all have a jolly good time at Ozma's party,\" said  the old gentleman, turning to put his presents on the table with the  others already there.  \"It isn't often I find time to leave my castle,  as you know; but Ozma invited me and I just couldn't help coming to  celebrate the happy occasion.\"    \"I'm so glad!\" exclaimed Dorothy.    \"These are my Ryls,\" pointing to the little sprites squatting around  him.  \"Their business is to paint the colors of the flowers when they  bud and bloom; but I brought the merry fellows along to see Oz, and  they've left their paint-pots behind them.  Also I brought these  crooked Knooks, whom I love.  My dears, the Knooks are much nicer than  they look, for their duty is to water and care for the young trees of  the forest, and they do their work faithfully and well.  It's hard  work, though, and it makes my Knooks crooked and gnarled, like the  trees themselves; but their hearts are big and kind, as are the hearts  of all who do good in our beautiful world.\"    \"I've read of the Ryls and Knooks,\" said Dorothy, looking upon these  little workers with interest.    Santa Claus turned to talk with the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, and  he also said a kind word to the shaggy man, and afterward went away to  ride the Saw-Horse around the Emerald City.  \"For,\" said he, \"I must  see all the grand sights while I am here and have the chance, and Ozma  has promised to let me ride the Saw-Horse because I'm getting fat and  short of breath.\"    \"Where are your reindeer?\" asked Polychrome.    \"I left them at home, for it is too warm for them in this sunny  country,\" he answered.  \"They're used to winter weather when they  travel.\"    In a flash he was gone, and the Ryls and Knooks with him; but they  could all hear the golden hoofs of the Saw-Horse ringing on the marble  pavement outside, as he pranced away with his noble rider.    Presently the band played again, and the High Chamberlain announced:    \"Her Gracious Majesty, the Queen of Merryland.\"    They looked earnestly to discover whom this queen might be, and saw  advancing up the room an exquisite wax doll dressed in dainty fluffs  and ruffles and spangled gown.  She was almost as big as Button-Bright,  and her cheeks and mouth and eyebrow were prettily painted in delicate  colors.  Her blue eyes stared a bit, being of glass, yet the expression  upon her Majesty's face was quite pleasant and decidedly winning.  With  the Queen of Merryland were four wooden soldiers, two stalking ahead of  her with much dignity and two following behind, like a royal bodyguard.  The soldiers were painted in bright colors and carried wooden guns, and  after them came a fat little man who attracted attention at once,  although he seemed modest and retiring.  For he was made of candy, and  carried a tin sugar-sifter filled with powdered sugar, with which he  dusted himself frequently so that he wouldn't stick to things if he  touched them.  The High Chamberlain had called him \"The Candy Man of  Merryland,\" and Dorothy saw that one of his thumbs looked as if it had  been bitten off by some one who was fond of candy and couldn't resist  the temptation.    The wax doll Queen spoke prettily to Dorothy and the others, and sent  her loving greetings to Ozma before she retired to the rooms prepared  for her.  She had brought a birthday present wrapped in tissue paper  and tied with pink and blue ribbons, and one of the wooden soldiers  placed it on the table with the other gifts.  But the Candy Man did not  go to his room, because he said he preferred to stay and talk with the  Scarecrow and Tik-tok and the Wizard and Tin Woodman, whom he declared  the queerest people he had ever met.  Button-Bright was glad the Candy  Man stayed in the Throne Room, because the boy thought this guest  smelled deliciously of wintergreen and maple sugar.    The Braided Man now entered the room, having been fortunate enough to  receive an invitation to the Princess Ozma's party.  He was from a cave  halfway between the Invisible Valley and the Country of the Gargoyles,  and his hair and whiskers were so long that he was obliged to plait  them into many braids that hung to his feet, and every braid was tied  with a bow of colored ribbon.    \"I've brought Princess Ozma a box of flutters for her birthday,\" said  the Braided Man, earnestly; \"and I hope she will like them, for they  are the finest quality I have ever made.\"    \"I'm sure she will be greatly pleased,\" said Dorothy, who remembered  the Braided Man well; and the Wizard introduced the guest to the rest  of the company and made him sit down in a chair and keep quiet, for, if  allowed, he would talk continually about his flutters.    The band then played a welcome to another set of guests, and into the  Throne-Room swept the handsome and stately Queen of Ev.  Beside her was  young King Evardo, and following them came the entire royal family of  five Princesses and four Princes of Ev.  The Kingdom of Ev lay just  across the Deadly Desert to the North of Oz, and once Ozma and her  people had rescued the Queen of Ev and her ten children from the Nome  King, who had enslaved them.  Dorothy had been present on this  adventure, so she greeted the royal family cordially; and all the  visitors were delighted to meet the little Kansas girl again.  They  knew Tik-tok and Billina, too, and the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman, as  well as the Lion and Tiger; so there was a joyful reunion, as you may  imagine, and it was fully an hour before the Queen and her train  retired to their rooms.  Perhaps they would not have gone then had not  the band begun to play to announce new arrivals; but before they left  the great Throne-Room King Evardo added to Ozma's birthday presents a  diadem of diamonds set in radium.    The next comer proved to be King Renard of Foxville; or King Dox, as he  preferred to be called.  He was magnificently dressed in a new feather  costume and wore white kid mittens over his paws and a flower in his  button-hole and had his hair parted in the middle.    "]]]
