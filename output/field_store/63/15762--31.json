But when Davy looked forth he concluded that discretion was  the better part of valor, for the angry Indians had closed upon his  fellows who followed, and were clubbing them, knocking them down and  kicking them; so that of the whole party taken prisoners near Fort  Stanwix, Davy Ogden was the only one who reached Fort Niagara without  serious harm. Turning back upon the parade ground he flatly refused to  go out again, whereupon the officer of the guard was called, who  questioned him, took pity on him, and sheltered him in his own quarters  for three days.    Now, if this were a mere story, we would expect, right here, a happy  turn in Davy's fortunes. As matter of fact, the most dismal days in  Davy's life were just to begin. He had hoped that the worst would be  detention at the fort, and a speedy shipment down the lake to Montreal,  for exchange. But after some days he was summoned to Guy Johnson's  house, where were many Indians, and here he was handed over to a squaw  to be her son, in place of one she had lost in the war. David was  powerless; and after what, many years later, he described as a powwow  had been held over him, he was led away by the squaw and her husband. A  British soldier, named Hank Haff, added to his grief by telling him that  he was adopted by the Indians and would have to live with them forever;  and, as he was led off across the plain, away from his friends and even  from communication with the British, who were at least of his own blood,  it was small consolation to know that his adopted father's name was  Skun-nun-do, that the hideous old hag, his mother, was Gunna-go-let,  that there was a daughter in the wigwam named Au-lee-zer-quot,  or that his own name was henceforth to be Chee-chee-le-coo, or  \"Chipping-bird\"--a good deal, I submit, for a soldier of the Revolution  to bear, even if he were only a boy.[25]    David lived with this fine family for over two years, being virtually  their slave, and always under circumstances which made escape  impossible. He dressed in Indian fashion, and learned their language,  their yells and signal whoops. During the first months of his adoption,  their wigwam was about four miles from the fort--presumably east or  southeast of it; and one of David's first duties was to go with  Gunna-go-let out on to the treeless plain overlooking Lake Ontario,  where the old squaw had found a prize in the shape of a horse which had  died of starvation. David helped her cut up the carcass and \"tote\" it  home--and he was glad to eat of the soup which she made of it. They were  always hungry. Skun-nun-do being a warrior, the burden of providing for  the family fell upon Gunna-go-let. Her principal recourse was to cut  faggots in the woods and carry them to the fort. Many a time did she and  Davy Ogden carry their loads of firewood on their backs up to the fort,  glad to receive in exchange cast-off meat, stale bread or rum. So much  of this work did Davy do during the two years that he was kept with  these Indians that his back became sore, then calloused.    When he had lived with Gunna-go-let three months, she packed up and  moved her wigwam to the carrying-place, now Lewiston. Here there was  cleared land, and some 200 huts or wigwams were pitched, while the  Indians planted, hoed and gathered a crop of corn. Davy was kept hard at  work in the field, or in carrying brooms, baskets and other things to  the fort for sale.    When he had been at the carrying-place about a year and a half, he saw a  large party of captives brought in from the settlements. Among them was  a young woman who had been at Fort Stanwix when Ogden was on duty there.  As she sat in the camp, Davy being present, she began to observe him  carefully. Although our hero was dressed as an Indian--Indian gaiters, a  short frock belted at the waist, and with his hair cut close to the  scalp over the whole head except a long tuft on the crown--yet this poor  girl saw his real condition and soon learned who he was. There was no  chance for confidences. What little they said had to be spoken freely,  without feeling, as if casually between strangers indifferent to each  other. She told David that she was gathering cowslip greens in a field,  when an Indian rushed upon her and carried her away. What she endured  while being brought to the Niagara I leave to the imagination. Davy saw  her carried away by her captors across the river into Canada; and thus  vanishes Hannah Armstrong, for I find no mention of her except in this  reminiscence of her drawn from Ogden's own lips.    About this time David was taken to the fort, old Gunna-go-let having  heard that the British would give her a present for the lad. Davy  trudged the nine miles from their hut to the fort with a good heart, for  to him the news meant a chance of exchange. At Guy Johnson's house he  and his mother sat expectant on the steps. Presently out came Capt.  Powell, who had married Jane Moore--who had herself been brought to the  fort a captive from Cherry Valley. This fine couple, from whom the lad  had some right to expect kindness, paraded up and down the \"stoop\" or  verandah of the house for a while, the wife hanging on her captain's arm  and both ignoring the boy. At length they paused, and Capt. Powell said:    \"You are one of the squaw boys? Do you want to quit the Indians?\"    \"Yes,\" said Davy, heart in mouth.    \"What for?\" quizzed the captain.    \"To be exchanged--to get back home, to my own country.\"    \"Well,\" said Powell, \"if you really want to get free from the Indians  come up and enlist in Butler's Rangers. Then we can ransom you from this  old squaw--will you do it?\"    \"No, I won't!\" blazed Davy, fiercely.    Capt. Powell turned on his heel. \"Go back with the Indians again and be  damned!\" and with that he vanished into the house; and we have no means  of knowing whether Jane, his wife, had by this time become so \"Tory\"  that she made no protest; but it is pleasanter to think of her as  remembering her own captivity, and, still loyal at heart, as interceding  for the boy.[26] But that was the end of it for this time, and back  Davy went, with an angry squaw, to continue his ignoble servitude until  the next spring. Then word spread all through the region that the  prisoners must be brought into Fort Niagara, and this time Davy was not  disappointed, for with many others he was hurried on board the schooner  Seneca and carried to Oswego. Obviously the news of the preparations for  a peace had reached Niagara. Although the Treaty of Paris was not signed  until September 3d of that year (1783), yet the preliminary articles had  been agreed upon in January. The order from the British Ministry to  cease hostilities reached Sir Guy Carleton about the 1st of April, and a  week or so would suffice for its transmission to Niagara. Captives who  had been detained and claimed by the Indians continued to be brought in  during that summer, but we hear no more of returning war parties  arriving with new prisoners. The War of the Revolution was over, even at  remote Niagara, although for one pretext and another--and for some good  reasons--the British held on to Fort Niagara and kept up its garrison  for thirteen years more.    With the sailing of the Seneca the connection of Davy Ogden with Fort  Niagara ended; but no one who has followed his fortunes thus far can  wish to drop him, as it were, in the middle of Lake Ontario. That is  where Davy came near going, for a gale came up which not only made him  and the throng of others who were fastened below decks desperately sick,  but came near wrecking the schooner. She was compelled to put in at  Buck's Island, and after some days reached Oswego, then strongly  garrisoned. Here Davy stayed, still a prisoner, but living with the  British Indians, through the winter. In the spring, with a companion  named Danforth, who stole a loaf of bread for their sustenance, he made  his escape. He ran through the woods, twenty-four miles in four hours;  swam the Oswego River, and on reaching the far side, and fearing  pursuit, did not stop to dress, but ran on naked through the woods until  he and his companion hoped they had distanced their pursuers. A party  had been sent after them from the fort, but on reaching the point where  the boys had plunged into the river, gave up the chase. Ogden and  Danforth pressed on, around Oneida Lake--having an adventure with a bear  by the way, and another with rattlesnakes--and finally, following old  trails, reached Fort Herkimer, having finished their loaf of bread and  run seventy miles on the last day of their flight. Here Davy was among  friends. The officers promptly clothed him, gave him passports, and in a  few days he found his parents at Warrensburg, in Schoharie County.    When the War of 1812 broke out, David took his gun again. He fought at  the Battle of Queenston, where forty men in his own company were killed  or wounded. Two bullets passed through his clothes, but he was unharmed.  We can imagine the interest with which he viewed the Lewiston plateau  where he had lived with Gunna-go-let more than thirty years before.  After the war he returned East, and in 1840 was living in the town of  Franklin, Delaware Co., being then seventy-six years old. The story of  his adventures was gathered from his own lips, but I do not think it has  ever been told before as a part of the history of the Niagara frontier.

The most  notable record of this has been quoted by Scudder in connection with a  swarm that invaded the Bermuda Islands, in 1874, on the first day of  October. It was described in these words:    \"Early in the morning several persons living on the north side of the  main island perceived, as they thought, a cloud coming over from the  northwest, which drew nearer and nearer to the shore, on reaching  which it divided into two parts, one of which went eastward and the  other westward, gradually falling upon the land. They were not long in  ascertaining that what they had taken for a cloud was an immense  concourse of small yellow butterflies, which flitted about all the  open grassy patches in a lazy manner, as if fatigued after their long  voyage over the deep. Fishermen out near the reefs, some few miles to  the north of the islands very early that morning, stated that numbers  of these insects fell upon their boats, literally covering them.\"    As is the case with so many of the related yellow butterflies there is  an albino variety of this species. It has been given the variety name  _alba_ although it is really a pale yellow rather than a true albino  form.       =The Dainty Sulphur=    _Nathalis iole_    While the Little Sulphur butterfly seems about as delicate a creature  as one could ask to see, it loses that distinction when it is compared  with the still smaller Dainty Sulphur. The latter expands scarcely an  inch when its wings are stretched apart, and its slender body and  antennae help to give the suggestion of extreme delicacy. There is  more marking of black upon the sulphur-yellow wings than is the case  with the larger form, the upper portion of the front wings showing  only a broad yellow band upon a background of darker color. The under  wings are nearly all yellow.      _Synopsis of the Yellows_    _Brimstone_ or _Cloudless Sulphur_ (_Callidryas eubule_ or  _Catopsilia eubule_). Expanse 2 1/2 inches. Upper surface of male  clear, light, sulphur yellow. Female with a brown spot in front of  middle of each front wing and a narrow brown margin on all the wings.  Under surface deeper yellow with sparsely scattered brownish dots.    _Red-barred Sulphur_ (_Callidryas philea_ or _Catopsilia philea_).  Expanse 3 inches. Easily known by the reddish orange bars on the  sulphur-yellow wings.    _Large Orange Sulphur_ (_Callidryas agarithe_ or _Catopsilia  agarithe_). Expanse 2 1/2 inches. Distinguished at once by its uniform  orange-yellow color.    _Dog's-head Butterfly_ (_Zerene caesonia_, _Colias caesonia_ or  _Meganostoma caesonia_). Expanse 2 1/4 inches. Upper surface yellow  with black inner and outer borders on front wings and black outer  border on hind wings. The black and yellow of each front wing so  combined as to make a distinct dog's head with black eye.    _Clouded Sulphur_ (_Eurymus philodice_ or _Colias philodice_). Expanse  2 inches. Upper surface sulphur yellow with blackish borders, the  yellow brighter in the male than in the female. Male with line between  yellow and black distinct, a black spot just in front of the middle of  each front wing and an orange spot near the middle of each hind wing.  Under surface of male deeper yellow, with spots as on the upper  surface but without black margin, and with a row of sub-marginal  brownish dots on each wing. Female with upper surface more generally  suffused between marginal mark and the yellow part with more or less  duskiness both above and below. Spots on each wing much as in male. In  the white form of the female (_pallidice_) the yellow is replaced by  white.    _Pink-edged Sulphur_ (_Eurymus interior_). At once distinguishable  from _philodice_ by the narrow pink edge of all the wings, showing  both from above and from below, slightly smaller as a rule.    _Orange Sulphur_ (_Eurymus eurytheme_ or _Colias eurytheme_). Expanse  2 1/4 inches. Much like Clouded Sulphur in markings except that  prevailing color-tone is orange yellow.    _Black-bordered Sulphur_ (_Eurema nicippe_, _Xanthidia nicippe_ or  _Terias nicippe_). Expanse 2 inches. Upper surface of wings bright  orange with a small black dash in front of the middle of each front  wing and a broad black border on all the wings. In the females the  borders are interrupted at the rear. Under surface slightly brownish  yellow, minutely striated and clouded when exposed when the butterfly  alights.    _Little Sulphur_ (_Eurema euterpe_, _Eurema lisa_, _Xanthidia lisa_ or  _Terias lisa_). Expanse 1 inch. Easily known by its small size and  delicate structure. Upper surface of wings yellow with distinct black  borders. Under surface yellow with indistinct spots.    _Dainty Sulphur_ (_Nathalis iole_). Expanse 1 inch. Easily known by  its small size and narrow yellow wings with black bars across the  outer angles and black bands across the back border of the front wings  and the front border of the hind wings.          THE NYMPHS    FAMILY _Nymphalidae_      A large proportion of our most familiar butterflies belongs to this  family. The Fritillaries, the Angle-wings, the Sovereigns, and the  Emperors are tribes in which practically all the species are of medium  or large size. The Crescent-spots include a few which are rather  small.    The combinations of characters by which the Nymph family is  distinguished are these: Front legs dwarfed into lappets; scaly  antennae; veins of fore wings not swollen at base; wings of normal  shape, not much longer than wide. Larvae cylindrical, but varying  greatly in form, color, and skin coverings. Chrysalids angular in  most species, in others rounded.    The stories of the lives of the many members of this family vary  considerably, as one would expect from their variety and numbers. We  may take, however, the life of the familiar Antiopa or Mourning Cloak  as typical of the group. Briefly summarized, its story may thus be  told:    During sunny days in spring one may often see a beautiful purple-back  butterfly, having a cream-colored border along the outer margin of its  wings, flying leisurely about, in the vicinity of woods and in the  open fields. This insect is called the Antiopa or Mourning Cloak; it  is represented natural size in plate opposite page 145. It has passed  the winter in this adult condition, having found shelter in some  retreat where it is not directly exposed to the storm and stress of  the weather.    When the leaves of the elm, willow, and poplar trees are nearly  expanded, these butterflies deposit their eggs upon the twigs. These  eggs are laid in clusters encircling the twigs, there being twenty or  more in each cluster. In the act of oviposition, the butterfly keeps  her wings spread out, moving the body and abdomen about as the placing  of the eggs necessitates.    About two weeks after the clusters of eggs are thus laid upon the  twigs of the food plant, they hatch into small blackish caterpillars,  each emerging from the egg shell through a small hole that it eats out  of the upper surface. They thus enter upon the second stage in their  life-history--the larva or caterpillar stage. As soon as hatched, they  crawl to the nearest leaf upon which they range themselves side by  side, with their heads toward the margin of the leaf. They feed in  this position, nibbling at the green surface of the leaf-blade and  leaving the network of veins untouched.

(Reduced)]         [Illustration:                                 _See pages 97-115_         SOME OF THE TRIBE OF YELLOWS         upper surfaces at left; under surfaces at right           (1) The Black-bordered Yellow--male;         (2) the Clouded Sulphur--male;         (3) the Orange Sulphur--female;         (4) the Dog's-head--male]    These caterpillars continue to feed in this manner for about a week,  remaining side by side when feeding, and marching in processions from  one leaf to another as the food supply is exhausted. Wherever they go,  each spins a silken thread on the surface traversed, so that the  combination of all the threads makes a sort of carpet that serves as a  foothold for the caterpillars. At the end of the week they moult or  cast their skins, a process in which the skin of each larva splits  open along the back, and the larva crawls out covered with a new skin  that had been formed beneath the old one. This new skin stretches  somewhat after the caterpillar emerges, so that the insect is able to  increase considerably in size. At the period of moulting, the  caterpillars remain quiet for a short time, but they soon become  active again and begin feeding with increased voracity.       [Illustration: Eggs of Mourning-Cloak, laid in a cluster on a       twig. (From Holland).]    During the next three weeks, this moulting process is repeated three  times, the caterpillars becoming larger each time, and leaving their  cast skins upon the denuded twigs. They soon scatter more or less over  neighboring leaves, but remain in closely associated colonies. As they  increase in size, they eat more and more of the leaf substance; when  half grown, they devour all but the midrib and the side veins; but  when they get larger, only the midribs are left.    The carpet web that they form becomes more conspicuous as the  caterpillars become full grown. They then leave the tree or shrub on  which they have been feeding, and scatter about, seeking some  sheltered situation. Having found this--perhaps beneath a stump"]]]
