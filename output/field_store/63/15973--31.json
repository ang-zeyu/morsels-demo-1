Bertie looked at them  with an air of disgust.    \"This will be worse for the hands than rowing for twelve hours in a  heavy boat.\"    \"I dare say it will,\" Harry agreed; \"but it has got to be done, and the  sooner we set about it the better.\"    \"I shall take off my flannel shirt,\" Bertie said.    \"You had better not, senor,\" Dias said, as he saw what the lad was  about to do. \"There are many insects here that will sting you, and the  bites of some of them swell up and turn into sores. Now, senor, I will  take this tree. The next is not quite so large, will you take that? I  will help you when I am finished with my own. Your brother and Jose can  work by turns at the other.\"    It was hard work, for the trees were over two feet across near the  foot. Dias had felled his before the others had cut half-way through,  and he then lent his aid to Harry, who was streaming with perspiration.    \"You are not accustomed to it, senor. You will manage better when you  have had two or three months' practice at the work.\"    \"I did not bargain for this, Harry,\" Bertie said as he rested for the  twentieth time from his work. \"Jaguars and alligators, Indians and  bandits, and hard climbing I was prepared for, but I certainly never  expected that we should have to turn ourselves into wood-cutters.\"    \"It is hard work, Bertie, but it is useless to grumble, and, as Dias  says, we shall become accustomed to it in two or three months.\"    \"Two or three months!\" Bertie repeated with a groan; \"my hands are  regularly blistered already, and my arms and back ache dreadfully.\"    \"Well, fire away! Why, Jose has done twice as much as you have, and he  has hardly turned a hair. I don't suppose that he has had much more  practice than you have had, and he is nothing like so strong.\"    \"Oh, I dare say! if he has never cut, his ancestors have, and I suppose  it is hereditary. Anyhow, I have been doing my best. Well, here goes!\"    Harry laughed at his brother's theory for explaining why Jose had done  more work than he had. He was himself by no means sorry that Dias had  come to his assistance, and that his tree was nearly ready to fall.  Jose climbed it with the end of a long rope, which he secured to an  upper bough. Dias then took the other end of the rope, crossed the  torrent by the tree he had felled, and when Jose had come down and  Harry had given a few more cuts with the axe, he was able to guide the  tree in its fall almost directly across the stream. Then he took  Bertie's tree in hand. In ten minutes this was lying beside the others.  It took three hours' more work to cut off the branches and to lay the  trees side by side, which was done with the aid of one of the mules.  The smaller logs were packed in between them to make a level road, and  when this was done the workers went back to the little camp. The sun  was already setting, and Donna Maria had the cooking-pots simmering  over the fire.    \"That has been a hard day's work,\" Harry said, when he and his brother  threw themselves down on the grass near the fire.    \"Hard is no name for it, Harry. I have never been sentenced to work on  a tread-mill, but I would cheerfully chance it for a month rather than  do another day's work like this. The palms of my hands feel as if they  had been handling a red-hot iron, my arms and shoulders ache as if I  had been on a rack. I seem to be in pain from the tips of my toes to  the top of my head.\"    Harry laughed.    \"It is only what every settler who builds himself a hut in the  backwoods must feel, Bert. It is the work of every wood-cutter and  charcoal-burner; it is a good deal like the work of every miner. You  have been brought up too soft, my boy.\"    \"Soft be hanged!\" the lad said indignantly; \"it is the first time I  have heard that the life of an apprentice on board a ship was a soft  one. I have no doubt you feel just as bad as I do.\"    \"But you don't hear me grumbling, Bert; that is all the difference. I  expect that, of the two, I am rather the worse, for my bones and  muscles are more set than yours, and it is some years now since I  pulled at either a rope or an oar.\"    Bertie was silent for a minute or two, and then said rather  apologetically:    \"Well, Harry, perhaps I need not have grumbled so much, but you see it  is a pretty rough beginning when one is not accustomed to it. We ought  to have had a short job to begin with, and got into it gradually,  instead of having six hours on end; and I expect that the backwoods  settler you were talking about does not work for very long when he  first begins. If he did he would be a fool, for he certainly would not  be fit for work for a week if he kept on till he had nearly broken his  back and taken the whole skin off his hands by working all day the  first time he tried it.\"    \"There is something in that, Bertie; and as we are in no extraordinary  hurry I do think we might have been satisfied with felling the trees  to-day, and cutting off the branches and getting them into place  to-morrow. Still, as Dias seemed to make nothing of it, I did not like  to knock off at the very start.\"    \"The meal is ready, senor,\" Maria said, \"and I think we had better eat  it at once, for the sky looks as if we were going to have rain.\"    \"And thunder too,\" Dias said. \"You had better begin; Jose and I will  picket the mules and hobble the llamas. If they were to make off, we  should have a lot of trouble in the morning.\"    The aspect of the sky had indeed changed. Masses of cloud hung on the  tops of the hills, and scud was flying overhead.    Maria placed one of the cooking-pots and two tin plates, knives, and  forks beside Harry and his brother, with two flat cakes of ground maize.    \"Sit down and have your food at once,\" Harry said to her. \"The rain  will be down in bucketfuls before many minutes.\"    They were soon joined by Dias and Jose, the latter bringing up a large  can of water from the stream. They had just finished when large drops  of rain began to patter on the ground.    \"Never mind the things,\" Harry said as he leapt to his feet. \"Crawl  under shelter at once; it is no use getting a wetting.\"    All at once made for the tents; and they were but just in time, for the  rain began to fall in torrents, and a peal of thunder crashed out  overhead as they got under the canvas.    \"This is our first experience of this sort of thing,\" Harry said, as he  and his brother lit their pipes half-sitting and half-reclining on  their beds. \"I rather wondered why Dias put the tents on this little  bit of rising ground, which did not look so soft or tempting as the  level; but I see now that he acted very wisely, for we should have been  flooded in no time if we had been lower down. As it is, I am by no  means sure that we shan't have the water in. Another time we will take  the precaution to make trenches round the tents when we pitch them.  However, we have got a waterproof sheet underneath the beds, so I  expect it will be all right.\"    \"I hope so. Anyhow, we had better see that the edges are turned up all  round, so that the water cannot run over them. By Jove! it does come  down. We can hardly hear each other speak.\"    Suddenly the entrance to the tent was thrust aside.    \"Here is a candle, senors.\"    It was thrown in, and Dias ran back into his own tent, which was but a  few yards away, before Harry could remonstrate at his coming out.    \"The candle will be useful, anyhow,\" Bertie said. \"It is almost  pitch-dark now. What with the sun going down and the clouds overhead,  it has turned from day into night in the past five minutes.\"    Striking a match he lit the candle, and stuck it in between his shoes,  which he took off for the purpose.    \"That is more cheerful, Harry.\"    \"Hullo! what is that?\"    A deep sound, which was certainly not thunder, rose from the woods. It  was answered again and again from different directions.    \"They must be either pumas or jaguars, which are always called here  lions and tigers, and I have no doubt Dias will know by the roar which  it is. I should not mind if it were daylight, for it is not pleasant to  know that there are at least half a dozen of these beasts in the  neighbourhood. We may as well drop the cartridges into our rifles and  pistols. I believe neither of these beasts often attacks men, but they  might certainly attack our mules.\"    The storm continued, and each clap of thunder was succeeded by roars,  snarls, and hissing, and with strange cries and shrieks. During a  momentary lull Harry shouted:    \"Is there any fear of these beasts attacking us or the mules, Dias?\"    \"No, senor, they are too frightened by the thunder and lightning to  think of doing so.\"    \"What are all those cries we hear?\"    \"Those are monkeys, senor. They are frightened both by the storm and by  the roaring of the lions and tigers.\"    \"Which is the bigger, Harry, the puma or the jaguar?\"    \"I believe the jaguar is the bigger, but the puma is the more  formidable and fiercer. The latter belongs to the same family as the  lion, and the former to that of the leopards. The jaguar is more  heavily built than the leopard, and stronger, with shorter legs, but it  is spotted just as the leopard is. The puma is in build like the lion,  but has no mane. Both prey on animals of all kinds. The natives say  they catch turtles, turn them over on their backs as a man would do,  and tear the shells apart. They will also eat fish; but they are both  scourges to the Indians and white planters, as they will kill sheep,  horses, and cattle. Of course, if they are attacked by men and wounded,  they will fight desperately, as most wild creatures will; but if man  does not molest them, they are quite content to leave him alone, unless  he chances to pass under a tree among the branches of which they are  lying in wait for prey. Both of them can climb trees.\"    \"Well, I thought I should have slept like a log, Harry,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/708"],[0,"The Princess and the Goblin (#20)"],[1,"Irene was passing.  It was a platform of  rock raised a few feet from the floor and covered with sheepskins, upon  which lay two horrible figures asleep, at once recognized by Curdie as  the king and queen of the goblins.  He lowered his torch instantly lest  the light should awake them.  As he did so it flashed upon his pickaxe,  lying by the side of the queen, whose hand lay close by the handle of  it.    'Stop one moment,' he whispered.  'Hold my torch, and don't let the  light on their faces.'    Irene shuddered when she saw the frightful creatures, whom she had  passed without observing them, but she did as he requested, and turning  her back, held the torch low in front of her.  Curdie drew his pickaxe  carefully away, and as he did so spied one of her feet, projecting from  under the skins.  The great clumsy granite shoe, exposed thus to his  hand, was a temptation not to be resisted.  He laid hold of it, and,  with cautious efforts, drew it off.  The moment he succeeded, he saw to  his astonishment that what he had sung in ignorance, to annoy the  queen, was actually true: she had six horrible toes.  Overjoyed at his  success, and seeing by the huge bump in the sheepskins where the other  foot was, he proceeded to lift them gently, for, if he could only  succeed in carrying away the other shoe as well, he would be no more  afraid of the goblins than of so many flies.  But as he pulled at the  second shoe the queen gave a growl and sat up in bed.  The same instant  the king awoke also and sat up beside her.    'Run, Irene!' cried Curdie, for though he was not now in the least  afraid for himself, he was for the princess.    Irene looked once round, saw the fearful creatures awake, and like the  wise princess she was, dashed the torch on the ground and extinguished  it, crying out:    'Here, Curdie, take my hand.'    He darted to her side, forgetting neither the queen's shoe nor his  pickaxe, and caught hold of her hand, as she sped fearlessly where her  thread guided her.  They heard the queen give a great bellow; but they  had a good start, for it would be some time before they could get  torches lighted to pursue them.  Just as they thought they saw a gleam  behind them, the thread brought them to a very narrow opening, through  which Irene crept easily, and Curdie with difficulty.    'Now,'said Curdie; 'I think we shall be safe.'    'Of course we shall,' returned Irene.  'Why do you think so?'asked  Curdie.    'Because my grandmother is taking care of us.'    'That's all nonsense,' said Curdie.  'I don't know what you mean.'    'Then if you don't know what I mean, what right have you to call it  nonsense?' asked the princess, a little offended.    'I beg your pardon, Irene,' said Curdie; 'I did not mean to vex you.'    'Of course not,' returned the princess.  'But why do you think we shall  be safe?'    'Because the king and queen are far too stout to get through that hole.'    'There might be ways round,' said the princess.    'To be sure there might: we are not out of it yet,' acknowledged Curdie.    'But what do you mean by the king and queen?' asked the princess. 'I  should never call such creatures as those a king and a queen.'    'Their own people do, though,' answered Curdie.    The princess asked more questions, and Curdie, as they walked leisurely  along, gave her a full account, not only of the character and habits of  the goblins, so far as he knew them, but of his own adventures with  them, beginning from the very night after that in which he had met her  and Lootie upon the mountain.  When he had finished, he begged Irene to  tell him how it was that she had come to his rescue.  So Irene too had  to tell a long story, which she did in rather a roundabout manner,  interrupted by many questions concerning things she had not explained.  But her tale, as he did not believe more than half of it, left  everything as unaccountable to him as before, and he was nearly as much  perplexed as to what he must think of the princess.  He could not  believe that she was deliberately telling stories, and the only  conclusion he could come to was that Lootie had been playing the child  tricks, inventing no end of lies to frighten her for her own purposes.    'But how ever did Lootie come to let you go into the mountains  alone?'he asked.    'Lootie knows nothing about it.  I left her fast asleep--at least I  think so.  I hope my grandmother won't let her get into trouble, for it  wasn't her fault at all, as my grandmother very well knows.'    'But how did you find your way to me?' persisted Curdie.    'I told you already,' answered Irene; 'by keeping my finger upon my  grandmother's thread, as I am doing now.'    'You don't mean you've got the thread there?'    'Of course I do.  I have told you so ten times already.  I have  hardly--except when I was removing the stones--taken my finger off it.  There!' she added, guiding Curdie's hand to the thread, 'you feel it  yourself--don't you?'    'I feel nothing at all,' replied Curdie. 'Then what can be the matter  with your finger?  I feel it perfectly.  To be sure it is very thin,  and in the sunlight looks just like the thread of a spider, though  there are many of them twisted together to make it--but for all that I  can't think why you shouldn't feel it as well as I do.'    Curdie was too polite to say he did not believe there was any thread  there at all.  What he did say was:    'Well, I can make nothing of it.'    'I can, though, and you must be glad of that, for it will do for both  of us.'    'We're not out yet,' said Curdie.    'We soon shall be,' returned Irene confidently.  And now the thread  went downwards, and led Irene's hand to a hole in the floor of the  cavern, whence came a sound of running water which they had been  hearing for some time.    'It goes into the ground now, Curdie,' she said, stopping.    He had been listening to another sound, which his practised ear had  caught long ago, and which also had been growing louder.  It was the  noise the goblin-miners made at their work, and they seemed to be at no  great distance now.  Irene heard it the moment she stopped.    'What is that noise?' she asked.  'Do you know, Curdie?'    'Yes.  It is the goblins digging and burrowing,' he answered.    'And you don't know what they do it for?'    'No; I haven't the least idea.  Would you like to see them?' he asked,  wishing to have another try after their secret.    'If my thread took me there, I shouldn't much mind; but I don't want to  see them, and I can't leave my thread.  It leads me down into the hole,  and we had better go at once.'    'Very well.  Shall I go in first?' said Curdie.    'No; better not.  You can't feel the thread,' she answered, stepping  down through a narrow break in the floor of the cavern. 'Oh!' she  cried, 'I am in the water.  It is running strong--but it is not deep,  and there is just room to walk.  Make haste, Curdie.'    He tried, but the hole was too small for him to get in.    'Go on a little bit he said, shouldering his pickaxe.  In a few moments  he had cleared a larger opening and followed her.  They went on, down  and down with the running water, Curdie getting more and more afraid it  was leading them to some terrible gulf in the heart of the mountain.  In one or two places he had to break away the rock to make room before  even Irene could get through--at least without hurting herself.  But at  length they spied a glimmer of light, and in a minute more they were  almost blinded by the full sunlight, into which they emerged.  It was  some little time before the princess could see well enough to discover  that they stood in her own garden, close by the seat on which she and  her king-papa had sat that afternoon.  They had come out by the channel  of the little stream.  She danced and clapped her hands with delight.    'Now, Curdie!' she cried, 'won't you believe what I told you about my  grandmother and her thread?'    For she had felt all the time that Curdie was not believing what she  told him.    'There!--don't you see it shining on before us?' she added.    'I don't see anything,' persisted Curdie.    'Then you must believe without seeing,' said the princess; 'for you  can't deny it has brought us out of the mountain.'    'I can't deny we are out of the mountain, and I should be very  ungrateful indeed to deny that you had brought me out of it.'    'I couldn't have done it but for the thread,' persisted Irene.    'That's the part I don't understand.'    'Well, come along, and Lootie will get you something to eat.  I am sure  you must want it very much.'    'Indeed I do.  But my father and mother will be so anxious about me, I  must make haste--first up the mountain to tell my mother, and then down  into the mine again to let my father know.'    'Very well, Curdie; but you can't get out without coming this way, and  I will take you through the house, for that is nearest.'    They met no one by the way, for, indeed, as before, the people were  here and there and everywhere searching for the princess.  When they  got in Irene found that the thread, as she had half expected, went up  the old staircase, and a new thought struck her.  She turned to Curdie  and said:    'My grandmother wants me.  Do come up with me and see her.  Then you  will know that I have been telling you the truth.  Do come--to please  me, Curdie.  I can't bear you should think what I say is not true.'    'I never doubted you believed what you said,' returned Curdie.  'I only  thought you had some fancy in your head that was not correct.' 'But do  come, dear Curdie.'    The little miner could not withstand this appeal, and though he felt  shy in what seemed to him a huge grand house, he yielded, and followed  her up the stair.
