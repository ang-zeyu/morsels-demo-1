Won't you tell him? please don't make me do it,\" she  pleaded tremblingly, and hanging back.    \"My daughter, you _must_,\" he replied, so sternly that she dared not  make any further resistance, but quietly submitted to be led into her  grandfather's presence.    He was still in the drawing-room, walking about in a disturbed and  angry manner, and now and then casting a suspicious glance upon Arthur,  who sat pale and trembling in a corner, looking the picture of guilt  and misery; for he had heard Chloe deliver his brother's message, and  feared that exposure awaited him.    Walter had stolen away to cry over Jim's punishment, and wish that he  had had the courage to tell the truth at first; but saying to himself  that it was too late now, his father wouldn't believe him, and he would  make it up to Jim somehow, even if it took all his pocket-money for a  month.    None of the other members of the family had left the room, and all wore  an anxious, expectant look, as Mr. Dinsmore entered, leading Elsie by  the hand.    \"I have brought you another witness, sir,\" he said, \"for it seems Elsie  was present when the mischief was done.\"    \"Ah!\" exclaimed the old gentlemen; \"then I may hope to get at the  truth. Elsie, who broke my watch?\"    \"It was not Jim, grandpa, indeed, _indeed_, it was not; but oh!  _please_ don't make me say who it was,\" replied the little girl,  beseechingly.    \"Elsie!\" exclaimed her father, in a tone of stern reproof.    \"O papa! how can I?\" she sobbed, trembling and clinging to his hand as  she caught a threatening look from Arthur.    \"Come, come, child, you must tell us all you know about it,\" said her  grandfather, \"or else I can't let Jim off.\"    Mr. Dinsmore was looking down at his little girl, and, following the  direction of her glance, perceived the cause of her terror. \"Don't be  afraid to speak out and tell all you know, daughter, for I will protect  you,\" he said, pressing the little trembling hand in his, and at the  same time giving Arthur a meaning look.    \"Yes, yes, speak out, child; speak out at once; no one shall hurt you  for telling the truth,\" exclaimed her grandfather, impatiently.    \"I will, grandpa,\" she said, trembling and weeping; \"but please don't  be very angry with Arthur; if you will forgive him this time, I think  he will never meddle any more; and I am quite sure he did not mean to  break it.\"    \"So it _was you_, after all, you young rascal! I knew it from the  first!\" cried the old gentleman, striding across the room, seizing the  boy by the shoulder and shaking him roughly.    \"But go on, Elsie, let us have the whole story,\" he added, turning to  her again, but still keeping his hold upon Arthur. \"You young dog!\" he  added, when she had finished. \"Yes, I'll forgive you when you've had a  good, sound flogging, and a week's solitary confinement on bread and  water, but not before.\"    So saying, he was about to lead him from the room, when Elsie suddenly  sprang forward, and with clasped hands, and flushed, eager face, she  pleaded earnestly, beseechingly, \"O grandpa! don't whip him, don't  punish him! He will never be so naughty again. Will you, Arthur? Let  _me pay_ for the watch, grandpa, and don't punish him. I would so like  to do it.\"    \"It isn't the moneyed value of the watch I care for, child,\" replied  the old gentleman, contemptuously; \"and besides, where would you get so  much money?\"    \"I am rich, grandpa, am I not? Didn't my mamma leave me a great deal of  money?\" asked the little girl, casting down her eyes and blushing  painfully.    \"No, Elsie,\" said her father, very gently, as he took her hand and led  her back to the side of his chair again, \"you have nothing but what I  choose to give you, until you come of age, which will not be for a  great many years yet.\"    \"But you _will_ give me the money to pay for the watch papa, _won't_  you?\" she asked, pleadingly.    \"No, I certainly shall not, for I think Arthur should be left to suffer  the penalty of his own misdeeds,\" he replied in a very decided tone;  \"and, besides,\" he added, \"your grandfather has already told you that  it is not the pecuniary loss he cares for.\"    \"No; but I will teach this young rascal to let my property alone,\" said  the elder gentleman with almost fierce determination, as he tightened  his grasp upon the boy's arm and dragged him from the room.    Arthur cast a look of hatred and defiance at Elsie as he went out, that  made her grow pale with fear and tremble so that she could scarcely  stand.    Her father saw both the look and its effect, and drawing the little  trembler closer to him, he put his arm around her, and stroking her  hair, said in a low, soothing tone: \"Don't be frightened, daughter; I  will protect you.\"    She answered him with a grateful look and a long sigh of relief, and he  was just about to take her on his knee when visitors were announced,  and, changing his mind, he dismissed her to her room, and she saw no  more of him that evening.    \"Oh! if they only _hadn't_ come just now,\" thought the sorely  disappointed child, as she went out with slow, reluctant steps. \"I'm  sure they wouldn't, if they had only known. I'm sure, quite sure papa  was going to take me on his knee, and they prevented him. Oh! will be  ever think of doing it again! Dear, dear papa, if you could only know  how I long to sit there!\" But Mrs. Dinsmore, who had hastily retired on  the exit of Arthur and his father from the drawing-room, was now  sailing majestically down the hall, on her return thither; and Elsie,  catching sight of her, and being naturally anxious to avoid a meeting  just then, at once quickened her pace very considerably, almost running  up the stairs to her own room, where she found old Aunt Phoebe, Jim's  mother, waiting to speak with her.    The poor old creature was overflowing with gratitude, and her fervent  outpouring of thanks and blessings almost made Elsie forget her  disappointment for the time.    Then Jim came to the door, asking to see Miss Elsie, and poured out his  thanks amid many sobs and tears; for the poor fellow had been terribly  frightened--indeed, so astounded by the unexpected charge, that he had  not had a word to say in his own defence, beyond an earnest and  reiterated assertion of his entire innocence; to which, however, his  angry master had paid no attention.    But at length Phoebe remembered that she had some baking to do, and  calling on Jim to come right along and split up some dry wood to heat  her oven, she went down to the kitchen followed by her son, and Elsie  was left alone with her nurse.    Chloe sat silently knitting, and the little girl, with her head leaning  upon her hand and her eyes fixed thoughtfully upon the floor, was  rehearsing again and again in her own mind all that had just passed  between her papa and herself; dwelling with lingering delight upon  everything approaching to a caress, every kind word, every soothing  tone of his voice; and then picturing to herself all that he might have  done and said if those unwelcome visitors had not come in and put an  end to the interview; and half hoping that he would send for her when  they had gone, she watched the clock and listened intently for every  sound.    But her bedtime came and she dared not stay up any longer; for his  orders had been peremptory that she should always retire precisely at  that hour, unless she had his express permission to remain up longer.    She lay awake for some time, thinking of his unwonted kindness, and  indulging fond hopes for the future, then fell asleep to dream that she  was on her father's knee, and felt his arms folded lovingly about her,  and his kisses warm upon her cheek.    Her heart beat quickly as she entered the breakfast-room the next  morning.    The family were just taking their places at the table, and her  half-eager, half-timid \"Good morning, papa,\" was answered by a grave,  absent \"Good morning, Elsie,\" and turning to his father and entering  into a conversation with him on some business matter, he took no  further notice of his little daughter, excepting to see that her plate  was well supplied with such articles of food as he allowed her to eat.    Elsie was sadly disappointed, and lingered about the room in the vain  hope of obtaining a smile or caress; but presently her father went out,  saying to the elder Mr. Dinsmore that he was going to ride over to Ion,  and would probably not return before night; then, with a sigh, the  little girl went back to her own room to prepare her morning lessons.    Elsie was now happily free from Arthur's persecutions for a time; for  even after his release, he was too much afraid of his brother openly to  offer her any very serious annoyance, though he plotted revenge in  secret; yet the little girl's situation was far from comfortable, and  her patience often severely tried, for Mrs. Dinsmore was excessively  angry with her on Arthur's account, and whenever her father was not  present, treated her in the most unkind manner; and from the same cause  the rest of the family, with the exception of her grandpa and Aunt  Adelaide, were unusually cold and distant; while her father, although  careful to see that all her wants were attended to, seldom took any  further notice of her; unless to reprove her for some childish fault  which, however trifling, never escaped his eye.    \"You seem,\" said Adelaide to him one day, as he sent Elsie from the  room for some very slight fault, \"to expect that child to be a great  deal more perfect than any grown person I ever saw, and to understand  all about the rules of etiquette.\"    \"If you please, Adelaide,\" said he haughtily, \"I should like to be  allowed to manage my own child as I see proper, without any  interference from others.\"    \"Excuse me,\" replied his sister; \"I had no intention of interfering;  but really, Horace, I do think you have no idea how eagle-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6462"],[0,"An Introduction to the mortuary customs of the North American Indians (#20)"],[1," suffered  to remain, visited and protected by the friends and relations, until  the flesh becomes putrid, so as easily to part from the bones; then  undertakers, who make it their business, carefully strip the flesh  from the bones, wash and cleanse them, and when dry and purified by  the air, having provided a curiously-wrought chest or coffin,  fabricated of bones and splints, they place all the bones therein,  which is deposited in the bone-house, a building erected for that  purpose in every town; and when this house is full a general solemn  funeral takes place; when the nearest kindred or friends of the  deceased, on a day appointed, repair to the bone-house, take up the  respective coffins, and, following one another in order of seniority,  the nearest relations and connections attending their respective  corps, and the multitude following after them, all as one family, with  united voice of alternate allelujah and lamentation, slowly proceeding  on to the place of general interment, when they place the coffins in  order, forming a pyramid; [Footnote: Some ingenious men whom I have  conversed with have given it as their opinion that all those pyramidal  artificial hills, usually called Indian mounds, were raised on this  occasion, and are generally sepulchres. However, I am of different  opinion.] and, lastly, cover all over with earth, which raises a  conical hill or mount; when they return to town in order of solemn  procession, concluding the day with a festival, which is called the  feast of the dead.\"    Morgan [Footnote: League of the Iroquois 1851, p. 171] also alludes to  this mode of burial:    \"The body of the deceased was exposed upon a hark scaffolding erected  upon poles or secured upon the limbs of trees, where it was left to  waste to a skeleton. After this had been effected by the process of  decomposition in the open air, the bones were removed either to the  former house of the deceased, or to a small bark-house by its side,  prepared for their reception. In this manner the skeletons of the  whole family were preserved from generation to generation by the  filial or parental affection of the living After the lapse of a number  of years, or in a season of public insecurity, or on the eve of  abandoning a settlement, it was customary to collect these skeletons  from the whole community around and consign them to a common resting  place.    \"To this custom, which is not confined to the Iroquois, is doubtless  to be ascribed the barrows and bone-mounds which have been found in  such numbers in various parts of the country. On opening these mounds  the skeletons are usually found arranged in horizontal layers, a  conical pyramid, those in each layer radiating from a common center.  In other cases they are found placed promiscuously.\"    D. G. Brinton [Footnote: Myths of the New World, 1868. p. 256.]  likewise gives an account of the interment of collected bones:    \"East of the Mississippi nearly every nation was accustomed at stated  periods--usually once in eight or ten years--to collect and clean the  osseous remains of those of its number who had died in the intervening  time, and inter them in one common sepulcher, lined with choice furs,  and marked with a mound of wood, stone, or earth. Such is the origin  of those immense tumuli filled with the mortal remains of nations and  generations, which the antiquary, with irreverent curiosity, so  frequently chances upon in all portions of our territory. Throughout  Central America the same usage obtained in various localities, as  early writers and existing monuments abundantly testify. Instead of  interring the bones, were they those of some distinguished chieftain,  they were deposited in the temples or the council-houses, usually in  small chests of canes or splints. Such were the charnel-houses which  the historians of De Soto's expedition so often mention, and these are  the 'arks' Adair and other authors who have sought to trace the  descent of the Indians from the Jews have likened to that which the  ancient Israelites bore with them in their migrations.    \"A widow among the Tahkalis was obliged to carry the bones of her  deceased husband wherever she went for four years, preserving them in  such a casket, handsomely decorated with feathers (Rich. Arc. Exp, p.  260). The Caribs of the mainland adopted the custom for all, without  exception. About a year after death the bones were cleaned, bleached,  painted, wrapped in odorous balsams, placed in a wicker basket, and  kept suspended from the door of their dwelling (Gumilla Hist. del  Orinoco I., pp. 199, 202, 204). When the quantity of these heirlooms  became burdensome they were removed to some inaccessible cavern and  stowed away with reverential care.\"    George Catlin [Footnote: Hist. N. A. Indians, 1844, I, p. 90.]  describes what he calls the \"Golgothas\" of the Mandans:    \"There are several of these golgothas, or circles of twenty or thirty  feet in diameter, and in the center of each ring or circle is a little  mound of three feet high, on which uniformly rest two buffalo skulls  (a male and female), and in the center of the little mound is erected  'a medicine pole,' of about twenty feet high, supporting many curious  articles of mystery and superstition, which they suppose have the  power of guarding and protecting this sacred arrangement.    \"Here, then, to this strange place do these people again resort to  evince their further affections for the dead, not in groans and  lamentations, however, for several years have cured the anguish, but  fond affection and endearments are here renewed, and conversations are  here held and cherished with the dead. Each one of these skulls is  placed upon a bunch of wild sage, which has been pulled and placed  under it. The wife knows, by some mark or resemblance, the skull of  her husband or her child which lies in this group, and there seldom  passes a day that she does not visit it with a dish of the best-cooked  food that her wigwam affords, which she sets before the skull at  night, and returns for the dish in the morning. As soon as it is  discovered that the sage on which the skull rests is beginning to  decay, the woman cuts a fresh bunch and places the skull carefully  upon it, removing that which was under it.    \"Independent of the above-named duties, which draw the women to this  spot, they visit it from inclination, and linger upon it to hold  converse and company with the dead. There is scarcely an hour in a  pleasant day but more or less of these women may be seen sitting or  lying by the skull of their child or husband, talking to it in the  most pleasant and endearing language that they can use (as they were  wont to do in former days), and seemingly getting an answer back.\"    From these accounts it may be seen that the peculiar customs which  have been described by the authors cited were not confined to any  special tribe or area of country, although they do not appear to have  prevailed among the Indians of the northwest coast, so far as known.        SUPERTERRENE AND AERIAL BURIAL IN CANOES.      The next mode of burial to be remarked is that of deposit in canoes,  either supported on posts, on the ground, or swung from trees, and is  common only to the tribes inhabiting the northwest coast. From a  number of examples, the following, relating to the Clallams and  furnished by the Rev. M. Eells, missionary to the Skokomish Agency,  Washington Territory, is selected:    \"The deceased was a woman about thirty or thirty-five years of age,  dead of consumption. She died in the morning, and in the afternoon I  went to the house to attend the funeral. She had then been placed in a  Hudson's Bay Company's box for a coffin, which was about 3 1/2 feet  long, 1 3/4 wide, and 1 1/2 high. She was very poor when she died,  owing to her disease, or she could not have been put in this box. A  fire was burning near by, where a large number of her things had been  consumed, and the rest were in three boxes near the coffin. Her mother  sang the mourning song, sometimes with others, and often saying. 'My  daughter, my daughter, why did you die?' and similar words. The burial  did not take place until the next day, and I was invited to go. It was  an aerial burial, in a canoe. The canoe was about 25 feet long. The  posts, of old Indian hewed boards, were about a foot wide. Holes were  cut in these, in which boards were placed, on which the canoe rested.  One thing I noticed while this was done which was new to me, but the  significance of which I did not learn. As fast as the holes were cut  in the posts green leaves were gathered and placed over the holes  until the posts were put in the ground. The coffin-box and the three  others containing her things were placed in the canoe and a roof of  boards made over the central part, which was entirely covered with  white cloth. The head part and the foot part of her bedstead were then  nailed on to the posts, which front the water, and a dress nailed on  each of these. After pronouncing the benediction, all left the hill  and went to the beach except her father, mother, and brother, who  remained ten or fifteen minutes, pounding on the canoe and mourning.  They then came down and made a present to those persons who were  there--a gun to me, a blanket to each of two or three others, and a  dollar and a half to each of the rest, there being about fifteen  persons present. Three or four of them then made short speeches, and  we came home.    \"The reason why she was buried thus is said to be because she is a  prominent woman in the tribe. In about nine months it is expected that  there will be a '_pot-latch_' or distribution of money near this  place, and as each tribe shall come they will send a delegation of two  or three men, who will carry a present and leave it at the grave; soon  after that shall be done she will be buried in the ground. Shortly  after her death both her father and mother "]]]
