This for completeness in the outlines of the history of  Israel given in the historical books of the Bible, plus the Apocrypha.  Also because of the importance of this too much neglected historical  period, without a knowledge of which very much of the New Testament may  not be understood. 'The New Testament,' says Prof. J. V. Bartlett, in  the \"Bible Treasure,\" \"takes much for granted. Hence, in reading the  Gospels, one is often forced to ask: What is the exact point of so and  so? We want, in fact, to become as one of Christ's fellow-countrymen;  and this means steeping our thought in the story of the long years  which lie between the times of Ezra and those of Jesus the Christ. They  must cease to be to us 'ages of silence,' if we are to see just what is  meant by 'the tradition of the elders,' or to feel the full force of  much that is found in the Sermon on the Mount. The whole period of more  than four centuries falls into four epochs--the Persian, the Greek, the  Maccabean and the Roman.\" (Bible Treasury, p. 189.)    2. _Historical Summary of Interval Between Old and New Testament:_ The  following notes are abridged from Oxford Bible Helps, Summary of this  Historical Period (p. 15), which summary itself is taken chiefly from  Josephus' Antiquities and the Books of the Maccabees.    3. _The Persian Period--537-330 B. C.:_ \"Ezra and Nehemiah left a  settled form of government in Palestine, the center of which was  Jerusalem. Here was established a council of elders and priests, who  formed an ecclesiastical court, interpreting the law, and enforcing  its observance. These were called the \"Great Synagogue.\" They were to  the new settlement after the captivity what the 'elders that overlived  Joshua' (Josh. xxiv: 31) were to the Israelites who came out of Egypt.  It was the Jewish theory that the law was given in a two-fold form,  viz., the written and the oral; the former consisting of brief official  enactments, the latter of more copious details. With the former code,  immutably formalized by God, they said the latter was orally taught to  Moses on Mount Sinai by the same Divine Author, as the authoritative  interpretation thereof, with the command to commit the one to writing,  but to transmit the other only by word of mouth. This oral law was  repeated by Moses to Joshua, who handed it on to the elders who  succeeded him, and they to the prophets, who, in their turn, passed  it from one to another till it reached Jeremiah, who, through the  medium of Baruch, conveyed it to Ezra, and he to the Great Synagogue,  whom Nehemiah also supplied with a library of all the sacred books he  could collect (II Mac. ii: 13). This body of elders lasted about 150  years, when it expired in its last survivor, the High Priest Simon the  Just (B. C. 291). * * * * Ezra and Nehemiah also set up synagogues in  country towns, as places of worship on the Sabbath, and schools of  instruction and for theological discussion during the week. Attached  to each was a body of 'rulers,' who were both civil magistrates and  ecclesiastical presbyters. During all this time [two hundred years]  Palestine was subject to Persia, and formed only part of a province  under the Satrap of Syria, these elders administering the government  with the high priest as their responsible head.\"    4. _Greek Period--330-167 B. C.:_ \"After the victories of Alexander  the Great over Persia, he took possession of Syria, allowing the Jews  to retain self-government and their own religion; and when he built  Alexandria, he invited thither many Jews, giving them equal rights with  the rest of his subjects. On Alexander's death at an early age, his  empire was divided amongst his four generals, and Syria was allotted  to Egypt under Ptolemy Lagos, who transplanted many more Jews to the  new colony at Alexandria (B. C. 320), and gave them many privileges,  so that they built a temple [at Jerusalem], and restored the ritual of  Solomon's time, until Alexandria became the center and metropolis of  those Jews who had migrated to Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy, and who  are called in the Acts of the Apostles \"Grecians\" ( Hellenists). They  were more lax in morals, liberal in views, and less exclusive than the  \"Hebrews\" of Jerusalem. They used the Greek language, and eventually  (B. C. 285) accepted as their scripture the Septuagint translation,  instead of the Hebrew original. It was at this period that Simon the  Just was high priest at Jerusalem, and by his wise administration  strengthened their position, and brought them peace and prosperity.\"    5. _The Maccabees--B. C. 198:_ \"After a series of contests Palestine  was taken from Egypt by Antiochus the Great, annexed to Syria, and  divided into five provinces, viz., Judea, Samaria, Galilee (W. of  Jordan), Peraea, and Trachonitis (E. of Jordan). From this time, owing  to its position between the two great powers Egypt and Syria, this  country became a frequent prey to both, until Antiochus Epiphanes  took Jerusalem (B. C. 170), foully polluted the temple, and compelled  the Jews to sacrifice to idols. He erected the statue of Jupiter on  the altar of burnt-offering, committed all books of scripture to  the flames, and prohibited the worship of God. The high priests,  corrupted by Greek licentiousness, prepared the way for declension,  and encouraged the adoption of foreign customs. But the attempt to  finally stamp out Judaism produced a recoil. It culminated in the  attempt of Antiochus to force the Jews publicly to eat the flesh of  swine sacrificed on God's altar to the honor of Jupiter. One aged  scribe refused, was followed by a mother and her seven sons, who all  suffered martyrdom with the extremes of torture. This was followed by  Mattathias, a priest of the Asmoaean family, who killed both a renegade  Jew, when about to offer idolatrous sacrifice, and the royal officer  who presided. Aided by his five sons, he rallied the faithful round  him, threw down the heathen altars, fled to the mountains and raised  the standard of liberty, on which were inscribed M. K. B. I., the  initials of their Hebrew war-cry, Mi-Kamoka Baelim, Ihovah, 'Who is  like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods?\" (Exodus xv: 11), from which  the insurgents got the name of 'Maccabees,' whence the eldest son  and successor of Mattathias is known in history as Judas Maccabaeus.  Under him they were victorious. Antiochus died of a loathsome disease,  stricken by God. The Maccabees recovered Jerusalem, purified the  temple, and restored its worship, holding for eight days (in December,  B. C. 165) the first \"Feast of Dedication,\" which continued to be  annually observed to our Lord's time (John x: 22.)\"    6. _The Roman Period:_ \"The Maccabean family continued to hold the  main sway over the people, who retained their local customs, but were  obliged to make terms with the Romans, under whose protection they  retained considerable freedom. Although the Israelites were scattered  over many countries, Jerusalem was still their religious and political  center, and in its temple alone were sacrifices offered, and to it  flowed the poll-tax of half a shekel from Jews all over the world.  The Roman government acknowledged and confirmed their independent  local administration, as a peculiar _\"imperium in imperio,\"_ by  the following decrees: (B. C. 47.) Julius Caesar (for services in  Alexandrine war) gave to Hyrcanus and his heirs all rights accorded to  high priests by law or courtesy; all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6052"],[0,"The Minds and Manners of Wild Animals: A Book of Personal Observations (#20)"],[1,"the cleverest thing I ever saw him do.  _Even those who saw it said they would not have believed it had  they not seen it themselves!_ Both my nephews, (Major Penny and  Mr. E. C. Penny), his wife and my sister (Mrs. Penny) were in the  room, and can testify to the correctness of the above record.    (2) \"Another clever thing John did, although I suspect this was  due more to instinct that to downright cleverness. A piece of  filet beefsteak had just come from the butcher. Inasmuch as  occasionally I gave him a small mouthful of raw beef, a small  piece of the coarser part of the steak was cut off, and I gave it  to him. He tasted it, then gravely handed it back to me. Then he  took my hand and put it on the finer part of the meat. From that I  cut off a tiny piece, gave it to him, and he ate it. When my  nephew came home he wouldn't believe it, so I tried it again, with  the same result, except that then he did not even attempt to eat  the coarser meat.\"    * * * * *    Concerning Miss Cunningham's wonderful story, I wish to state that  I believe all of it,--because there is no reason to do otherwise!  It sets a new mark in gorilla lore, and it lifts a curtain from an  animal mind that previously was unknown, and very generally  misunderstood.    To the Doubting Thomases who will doubt some portions of Miss  Cunningham's story, let me cite, by way of caution, the following  history:    When Du Chaillu discovered the gorilla, and came to America and  England with his specimens to tell about it, he said that when a  big gorilla is attacked and made angry it beats its breast,  repeatedly, with its clenched fists. The wiseacres of that day  solemnly shook their heads and said: \"Oh, no! That can not be  true. No ape ever did that. He is romancing!\" But now we know that  this breast-beating and chest-clapping habit is to a gorilla a  common-place performance, even in captivity.    Sometimes there are more things in heaven and earth than are  dreamt of in all our philosophy.          XI    THE MIND OF THE ELEPHANT      It was in the jungles of the Animallai Hills of southern India  that I first became impressed by the mental capacity of the Indian  elephant. I saw many wild herds. I saw elephants at work, and at  one period I lived in a timber camp, consisting of working  elephants and mahouts. I saw a shrewd young elephant-driver  soundly flogged for stealing an elephant, farming it out to a  native timber contractor for four days, and then elaborately  pretending that the animal had been \"lost.\" Later on I saw  elephant performances in the \"Greatest Show on Earth\" and  elsewhere, and for eighteen years I have been chief mourner over  the idiosyncrasies of Gunda and Alice. If I do not now know  something about elephants, then my own case of animal intelligence  is indeed hopeless.    To me it seems that the only thing necessary to establish the  elephant as an animal of remarkable intellect and power of  original reasoning is to set forth the unadorned facts that lie  ready to hand.    Cuvier recorded the opinion that in sagacity the elephant in no  way excels the dog and some other species of carnivora. Sir  Emerson Tennent, even after some study of the elephant, was  disposed to award the palm for intelligence to the dog, but only  \"from the higher degree of development consequent on his more  intimate domestication and association with man.\" In the mind of  G. P. Sanderson we fear that familiarity with the elephant bred a  measure of contempt; and this seems very strange. He says:    \"Its reasoning faculties are undoubtedly far below those of the  dog, and possibly of other animals; and in matters beyond its  daily experience it evinces no special discernment.\"    To me it seems that all three of those opinions are off the  target. The dog is not a wild, untrammeled animal; and neither  dogs, cats nor savage men evince any special discernment \"beyond  the range of their daily experience.\" Moreover, there are some  millions of tame men of whom the same may be said with entire  safety.    Very often the question is asked: \"Is the African elephant equal  in intelligence and training capacity to the Indian species?\"    To this we must answer: Not proven. We do not know. The African  species never has been tried out on the same long and wide basis  as the Indian. Many individual African elephants, very  intelligent, have been trained, successfully, and have given good  accounts of themselves. For my own part I am absolutely sure that  when taken in hand at the same age, and trained on the same basis  as the Indian species, the African elephant will be found mentally  quite the equal of the Indian, and just as available for work or  performances.    No negro tribe really likes to handle elephants and train them.  The Indian native loves elephants, and enjoys training them and  working with them. It is these two conditions that have left the  African elephant far behind the procession. The African elephant  belongs to the great Undeveloped Continent. He has been, and he  still is, mercilessly pursued and slaughtered for his tusks. All  the existing species of African elephants are going down and out  before the ivory hunters. We fear that they will all be dead one  hundred years from this time, or even less. A century hence, when  the last _africanus_ has gone to join the mammoth and the  mastodon, his well protected wild congener in India still will be  devouring his four hundred pounds of green fodder per day, and the  tame ones will be performing to amuse the swarming human millions  of this overcrowded world.    In the minds of our elephant keepers, familiarity with elephants  has bred just the reverse of contempt. Both Thuman and Richards  are quite sure that elephants are the wisest of all wild animals.    Despite the very great amount of trouble made for Keeper Thuman by  Gunda, the Indian, and Kartoum, the African, Thuman grows  enthusiastic over the shrewdness of their \"cussedness.\" He is  particularly impressed by their skill in opening chain shackles,  and unfastening the catches and locks of doors and gates. And  really, Kartoum's ingenuity in finding out how to open latches and  bolts is almost inexhaustible, as well as marvelous.    Keeper Richards declares that our late African pygmy elephant,  Congo, was the wisest animal he ever has known. I have elsewhere  referred to his ability in shutting his outside door. Richards  taught him to accept coins from visitors, deposit them in a box,  then pull a cord to ring a bell, one pull for each coin  represented. The keeper devised four different systems of intimate  signals by which he could tell Congo to stop at the right point,  and all these were so slight that no one ever detected them. One  was by a voice-given cue, another by a hand motion, and a third  was by an inclination of the body.    Keeper Richards relates that Congo would go out in his yard,  collect a trunkful of peanuts from visitors, bring them inside and  secretly cache them in a corner behind his feed box. Then he would  go out for more graft peanuts, bring them in, hide them and  proceed to eat the first lot. There are millions of men who do not  know what it is to conserve something that can be eaten.    In this discussion of the intellectual powers and moral qualities  of the elephant I will confine myself to my own observations on  _Elephas indicus_, except where otherwise stated. A point to  which we ask special attention is that in endeavoring to estimate  the mental capacity of the elephant, we will base no general  conclusions upon _any particularly intelligent individual_,  as all mankind is tempted to do in discussions of the intelligence  of the dog, the cat, the horse, parrot and ape. On the contrary,  it is our desire to reveal the mental capacity of _every  elephant living_, tame or wild, except the few individuals with  abnormal or diseased minds. It is not to be shown how successfully  _an_ elephant has been taught by man, but how _all_  elephants in captivity have been taught, and the mental capacity  of _every_ elephant.    Under the head of intellectual qualities we have first to consider  the elephant's    POWERS OF INDEPENDENT OBSERVATIONS, AND REASONING FROM CAUSE TO  EFFECT    While many wonderful stories are related of the elephant's  sagacity and independent powers of reasoning, it must be admitted  that a greater number of more wonderful anecdotes are told on  equally good authority of dogs. But the circumstances in the case  are wholly to the advantage of the universal dog, and against the  rarely seen elephant. While the former roams at will through his  master's premises, through town and country, mingling freely with  all kinds of men and domestic animals, with unlimited time to lay  plans and execute them, the elephant in captivity is chained to a  stake, with no liberty of action whatever aside from begging with  his trunk, eating and drinking. His only amusement is in swaying  his body, swinging one foot, switching his tail, and (in a  zoological park) looking for something that he can open or  destroy. Such a ponderous beast cannot be allowed to roam at large  among human beings, and the working elephant never leaves his  stake and chain except under the guidance of his mahout. There is  no means of estimating the wonderful powers of reasoning that  captive elephants might develop if they could only enjoy the  freedom accorded to all dogs except the blood-hound, bull-dog and  a few others.    In the jungles of India the writer frequently has seen wild  elephants reconnoitre dangerous ground by means of a scout or spy;  communicate intelligence by signs; retreat in orderly silence from  a lurking danger, and systematically march, in single file, like  the jungle tribes of men.    Once having approached to within fifty yards of the stragglers of  a herd of about thirty wild elephants, which was scattered over  about four acres of very open forest"]]]
