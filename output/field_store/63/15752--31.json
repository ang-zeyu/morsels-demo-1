Biographers of Wycliffe have referred to this tract and  quoted passages in evidence of the Wycliffite heresies; but they  appear to have failed altogether of perceiving its larger scope, or  understanding its political bearing and significance. There can hardly  be a doubt, as Mr. Forshall suggests, that it was drawn up to  influence the famous parliament which met in the eighteenth year of  Richard the Second, and which was a scene of unusual excitement on the  subject of religion from the sudden clash of the old Papal party with  the new and increasing band of patriotic reformers. Wycliffe had then  been dead, and his opinions gradually on the increase, for more than  ten years. The author of the Remonstrance was his friend John Purvey,  who assisted him in the first English version of the Bible, shared  with him the duties of his parish, and attended his death-bed. He was  the most active of the reformers, the most formidable to the  ecclesiastical authorities. Another old MS. from the Cottonian  collection in the British Museum, is the _Chronicle of Battel Abbey,  from 1066 to 1176, now first translated, with Notes, and an Abstract  of the subsequent History of the Establishment_, by Mark Antony Lower.  This is extremely curious, and contains, besides the important  histories of the controversies between the ecclesiastical authorities  and Henry the Second, some very striking exhibitions of manners.           *       *       *       *       *    The vitality of SCOTT'S popularity is shown by the fact that the  Edinburgh publishers of his _Life_ and _Works_ printed and sold the  following quantities of them during the period from 1st January, 1848,  to 26th March, 1851, viz.: Novels (exclusive of the Abbotsford  edition), 4,760 sets; Poetical Works, 4,360; Prose Writings, 850;  Life, 2,610; Tales of a Grandfather (independently of those included  in the complete sets of the Prose Works), 2,990; and Selections,  4,420. It may serve as a \"curiosity of literature\" to give a summary  of the printing of the Writings and Life since June, 1829, when they  came under the management of the late proprietor, Mr. Cadell: Waverley  Novels, 78,270 sets; Poetical Works, 41,340; Prose Works, 8,260; Life,  26,860; Tales of a Grandfather (independently of those included in the  complete sets of the Prose Works), 22,190; Selections, 7,550. The  popularity to which the \"People's Edition\" has attained appears from  the fact that the following numbers, originally published in weekly  sheets, have been printed: Novels, 7,115,197; Poetry, 674,955; Prose,  269,406; Life, 459,291; total sheets, 8,518,849.    The whole copyrights, stocks, &c., of Scott's works, as possessed for  many years by Cadell, have now been transferred to the hands of  Messrs. Adam and Charles Black. The copyrights and stock have been  acquired by the present purchasers for L27,000, or L10,000 less than  Mr. Cadell paid for copyrights alone.           *       *       *       *       *    ELIZABETH BARRET BROWNING has published a new poem, _Casa Guidi  Windows_, which gives a vivid picture of the tumult and heroism of  Italian struggles for independence, as seen from the poet's windows,  at Florence, with the fervid commentary of her hopes and aspirations.           *       *       *       *       *    A novel by MRS. CAROLINE LEE HENTZ, published by Mr. Hart, of  Philadelphia, has been dramatized by Mr. Henry Paul Howard, for the  Haymarket Theatre in London, and brought out in a very splendid style,  with J. W. Wallack in the leading character.           *       *       *       *       *    COLONEL CUNNINGHAM, a son-in-law of Viscount Hardinge, has just  published in London \"Glimpses of the Great Western Republic in the  year 1850.\"           *       *       *       *       *    We shall look with much interest for the result of the new scheme for  the encouragement of life assurance, economy, &c., among literary men  and artists in England. To bring this project into general notice, and  to form the commencement of the necessary funds, Sir Edward Bulwer  Lytton, one of its originators, has written and presented to his  associates in the cause, a new comedy in five acts, under the  significant title, _Not So Bad as we Seem_. It was to be produced on  the sixteenth ult., under the management of Mr. Charles Dickens, in a  theatre constructed for the purpose, and performed by Robert Bell,  Wilkie Collins, Dudley Costello, Peter Cunningham, Charles Dickens,  Augustus Egg, A.R.A., John Forster, R. H. Horne, Douglass Jerrold,  Charles Knight, Mark Lemon, J. Westland Marston, Frank Stone, and  others. The tickets were twenty-five dollars each, and the Queen and  Prince Albert were to be present. The comedy is hereafter to be  performed in public; and the promoters of the scheme are sanguine of  its success. Mr. Maclise has offered to paint a picture (the subject  to be connected with the performance of the comedy), and to place it  at the disposal of the guild, for the augmentation of its funds. The  prospects are encouraging.           *       *       *       *       *    The REV. C. G. FINNEY, so well known in the Presbyterian churches of  this country, has passed some time in London, and an edition of his  _Lectures on Systematic Theology_ has just been published there, with  a preface by the Rev. Dr. Redford, of Worcester, who confesses, that  \"when a student he would gladly have bartered half the books in his  library to have gained a single perusal of these Lectures; and he  cannot refrain from expressing the belief, that no young student of  theology will ever regret their purchase or perusal.\" The book makes  an octavo of 1016 pages.           *       *       *       *       *    \"TALVI,\" the wife of Professor ROBINSON, will leave New-York in a few  days, we understand, to pass some time in her native country. She will  be absent a year and a half, and will reside chiefly in Berlin. We  have recently given an account of the life and writings of this very  eminent and admirable woman, in the _International_, and are among the  troops of friends who wish her all happiness in the fatherland, and a  safe return to the land of her adoption. We presume the public duties  of Dr. Robinson will prevent him from being absent more than a few  weeks.           *       *       *       *       *    ALBERT SMITH has dramatised a tale from Washington Irving's \"Alhambra\"  for the Princess's Theatre--making a burlesque comedy.           *       *       *       *       *    MRS. SOUTHWORTH must be classed among our most industrious writers.  The Appletons have just published a new novel by her, entitled _The  Mother-in-Law_, and she has two others in press--one of which is  appearing from week to week in the _National Era_.           *       *       *       *       *    DR. SPRING, whose religious writings appear to be as popular in Great  Britain as in this country, and every where to be regarded as among  the classics of practical religious literature, has issued a second  edition of his two octavos entitled _First Things_. In style, temper,  and all the best qualities of such works, the discourses embraced in  this work are deserving of eminent praise. (M. W. Dodd.)           *       *       *       *       *    Of HENRY MARTIN, whom the religious world regards with a reverent  affection like that it gives to Cowper and Heber, the hitherto  unpublished _Letters and Journals_ have just appeared, and they seem  to us even more interesting than the so well-known Memoirs of his Life  published soon after he died. (M. W. Dodd.)           *       *       *       *       *    MRS. SIGOURNEY has published a volume entitled _Letters to my Pupils,  with Narrative and Biographical Sketches_. It embraces reminiscences  of her experience as a teacher, and we have read none of her prose  compositions that are more suggestive or more pleasing. (Robert Carter  & Brothers.)           *       *       *       *       *    A _Life of Algernon Sydney_, by G. Van Santvoord (a new author), has  been published by Charles Scribner. To describe the history and  writings of this noble republican was a task worthy of an American  scholar. Mr. Van Santvoord has performed it excellently well.           *       *       *       *       *    BAYARD TAYLOR and R. H. STODDARD have new volumes of poems in the  press of Ticknor, Reed & Fields, of Boston, and that house has never  published original volumes of greater merit, or that will be more  popular.           *       *       *       *       *    THE POEMS OF WILLIAM P. MULCHINOCK, in one volume, lately published by  Mr. Strong, Nassau-street, appear to have been received with singular  favor by the critics. Mr. Mulchinock has remarkable fluency, and a  genial spirit. His book contains specimens of a great variety of  styles, and some pieces of much merit.           *       *       *       *       *    TICKNOR & CO. have published a novelette entitled _The Solitary_, by  Santaine, the author of \"Picciola.\" It is of the Robinson Crusoe sort  of books--better than any other imitation of Defoe.           *       *       *       *       *    The _Pocket Companion, for Machinists, Mechanics, and Engineers_, by  OLIVER BYRNE, is a remarkable specimen of perspicuous condensation. In  a beautiful pocket-book it embraces for the classes for whom it is  designed the pith of two or three ordinary octavos.           *       *       *       *       *    Among the new volumes of poems is one of Dramatic and Miscellaneous  Pieces, by CHARLES JAMES CANNON, published by Edward Dunigan. Mr.  Cannon is a writer of much cultivation, and, in his dramatic poems,  especially, there are passages of much force and elegance.           *       *       *       *       *    MR. JOHN E. WARREN, whose pleasant letters from the south of Europe  were a chief attraction of some of the early numbers of the  _International_, has in the press of Putnam, to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3623"],[0,"The Golden Bough: A Study of Magic and Religion (#20)"],[1,",  superior to man, behind the visible screen of nature. Obviously the  conception of personal agents is more complex than a simple  recognition of the similarity or contiguity of ideas; and a theory  which assumes that the course of nature is determined by conscious  agents is more abstruse and recondite, and requires for its  apprehension a far higher degree of intelligence and reflection,  than the view that things succeed each other simply by reason of  their contiguity or resemblance. The very beasts associate the ideas  of things that are like each other or that have been found together  in their experience; and they could hardly survive for a day if they  ceased to do so. But who attributes to the animals a belief that the  phenomena of nature are worked by a multitude of invisible animals  or by one enormous and prodigiously strong animal behind the scenes?  It is probably no injustice to the brutes to assume that the honour  of devising a theory of this latter sort must be reserved for human  reason. Thus, if magic be deduced immediately from elementary  processes of reasoning, and be, in fact, an error into which the  mind falls almost spontaneously, while religion rests on conceptions  which the merely animal intelligence can hardly be supposed to have  yet attained to, it becomes probable that magic arose before  religion in the evolution of our race, and that man essayed to bend  nature to his wishes by the sheer force of spells and enchantments  before he strove to coax and mollify a coy, capricious, or irascible  deity by the soft insinuation of prayer and sacrifice.    The conclusion which we have thus reached deductively from a  consideration of the fundamental ideas of magic and religion is  confirmed inductively by the observation that among the aborigines  of Australia, the rudest savages as to whom we possess accurate  information, magic is universally practised, whereas religion in the  sense of a propitiation or conciliation of the higher powers seems  to be nearly unknown. Roughly speaking, all men in Australia are  magicians, but not one is a priest; everybody fancies he can  influence his fellows or the course of nature by sympathetic magic,  but nobody dreams of propitiating gods by prayer and sacrifice.    But if in the most backward state of human society now known to us  we find magic thus conspicuously present and religion conspicuously  absent, may we not reasonably conjecture that the civilised races of  the world have also at some period of their history passed through a  similar intellectual phase, that they attempted to force the great  powers of nature to do their pleasure before they thought of  courting their favour by offerings and prayer--in short that, just  as on the material side of human culture there has everywhere been  an Age of Stone, so on the intellectual side there has everywhere  been an Age of Magic? There are reasons for answering this question  in the affirmative. When we survey the existing races of mankind  from Greenland to Tierra del Fuego, or from Scotland to Singapore,  we observe that they are distinguished one from the other by a great  variety of religions, and that these distinctions are not, so to  speak, merely coterminous with the broad distinctions of race, but  descend into the minuter subdivisions of states and commonwealths,  nay, that they honeycomb the town, the village, and even the family,  so that the surface of society all over the world is cracked and  seamed, sapped and mined with rents and fissures and yawning  crevasses opened up by the disintegrating influence of religious  dissension. Yet when we have penetrated through these differences,  which affect mainly the intelligent and thoughtful part of the  community, we shall find underlying them all a solid stratum of  intellectual agreement among the dull, the weak, the ignorant, and  the superstitious, who constitute, unfortunately, the vast majority  of mankind. One of the great achievements of the nineteenth century  was to run shafts down into this low mental stratum in many parts of  the world, and thus to discover its substantial identity everywhere.  It is beneath our feet--and not very far beneath them--here in  Europe at the present day, and it crops up on the surface in the  heart of the Australian wilderness and wherever the advent of a  higher civilisation has not crushed it under ground. This universal  faith, this truly Catholic creed, is a belief in the efficacy of  magic. While religious systems differ not only in different  countries, but in the same country in different ages, the system of  sympathetic magic remains everywhere and at all times substantially  alike in its principles and practice. Among the ignorant and  superstitious classes of modern Europe it is very much what it was  thousands of years ago in Egypt and India, and what it now is among  the lowest savages surviving in the remotest corners of the world.  If the test of truth lay in a show of hands or a counting of heads,  the system of magic might appeal, with far more reason than the  Catholic Church, to the proud motto, \"_Quod semper, quod ubique,  quod ab omnibus,_\" as the sure and certain credential of its own  infallibility.    It is not our business here to consider what bearing the permanent  existence of such a solid layer of savagery beneath the surface of  society, and unaffected by the superficial changes of religion and  culture, has upon the future of humanity. The dispassionate  observer, whose studies have led him to plumb its depths, can hardly  regard it otherwise than as a standing menace to civilisation. We  seem to move on a thin crust which may at any moment be rent by the  subterranean forces slumbering below. From time to time a hollow  murmur underground or a sudden spirt of flame into the air tells of  what is going on beneath our feet. Now and then the polite world is  startled by a paragraph in a newspaper which tells how in Scotland  an image has been found stuck full of pins for the purpose of  killing an obnoxious laird or minister, how a woman has been slowly  roasted to death as a witch in Ireland, or how a girl has been  murdered and chopped up in Russia to make those candles of human  tallow by whose light thieves hope to pursue their midnight trade  unseen. But whether the influences that make for further progress,  or those that threaten to undo what has already been accomplished,  will ultimately prevail; whether the impulsive energy of the  minority or the dead weight of the majority of mankind will prove  the stronger force to carry us up to higher heights or to sink us  into lower depths, are questions rather for the sage, the moralist,  and the statesman, whose eagle vision scans the future, than for the  humble student of the present and the past. Here we are only  concerned to ask how far the uniformity, the universality, and the  permanence of a belief in magic, compared with the endless variety  and the shifting character of religious creeds, raises a presumption  that the former represents a ruder and earlier phase of the human  mind, through which all the races of mankind have passed or are  passing on their way to religion and science.    If an Age of Religion has thus everywhere, as I venture to surmise,  been preceded by an Age of Magic, it is natural that we should  enquire what causes have led mankind, or rather a portion of them,  to abandon magic as a principle of faith and practice and to betake  themselves to religion instead. When we reflect upon the multitude,  the variety, and the complexity of the facts to be explained, and  the scantiness of our information regarding them, we shall be ready  to acknowledge that a full and satisfactory solution of so profound  a problem is hardly to be hoped for, and that the most we can do in  the present state of our knowledge is to hazard a more or less  plausible conjecture. With all due diffidence, then, I would suggest  that a tardy recognition of the inherent falsehood and barrenness of  magic set the more thoughtful part of mankind to cast about for a  truer theory of nature and a more fruitful method of turning her  resources to account. The shrewder intelligences must in time have  come to perceive that magical ceremonies and incantations did not  really effect the results which they were designed to produce, and  which the majority of their simpler fellows still believed that they  did actually produce. This great discovery of the inefficacy of  magic must have wrought a radical though probably slow revolution in  the minds of those who had the sagacity to make it. The discovery  amounted to this, that men for the first time recognised their  inability to manipulate at pleasure certain natural forces which  hitherto they had believed to be completely within their control. It  was a confession of human ignorance and weakness. Man saw that he  had taken for causes what were no causes, and that all his efforts  to work by means of these imaginary causes had been vain. His  painful toil had been wasted, his curious ingenuity had been  squandered to no purpose. He had been pulling at strings to which  nothing was attached; he had been marching, as he thought, straight  to the goal, while in reality he had only been treading in a narrow  circle. Not that the effects which he had striven so hard to produce  did not continue to manifest themselves. They were still produced,  but not by him. The rain still fell on the thirsty ground: the sun  still pursued his daily, and the moon her nightly journey across the  sky: the silent procession of the seasons still moved in light and  shadow, in cloud and sunshine across the earth: men were still born  to labour and sorrow, and still, after a brief sojourn here, were  gathered to their fathers in the long home hereafter. All things  indeed went on as before, yet all seemed different to him from whose  eyes the old scales had fallen. For he could no"]]]
