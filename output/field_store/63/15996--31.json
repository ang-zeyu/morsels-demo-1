The story-teller turned away in silence, but his wife stopped him.    \"Accept his offer,\" said she. \"This is the third time, and who knows  what luck you may have? You'll surely win now.\"    They played again, and the story-teller lost. No sooner had he done so,  than to his sorrow and surprise, his wife went and sat down near the  ugly old beggar.    \"Is that the way you're leaving me?\" said the story-teller.    \"Sure I was won,\" said she. \"You would not cheat the poor man, would  you?\"    \"Have you any more to stake?\" asked the old man.    \"You know very well I have not,\" replied the story-teller.    \"I'll stake the whole now, wife and all, against your own self,\" said  the old man.    Again they played, and again the story-teller lost.    \"Well! here I am, and what do you want with me?\"    \"I'll soon let you know,\" said the old man, and he took from his pocket  a long cord and a wand.    \"Now,\" said he to the story-teller, \"what kind of animal would you  rather be, a deer, a fox, or a hare? You have your choice now, but you  may not have it later.\"    To make a long story short, the story-teller made his choice of a hare;  the old man threw the cord round him, struck him with the wand, and lo!  a long-eared, frisking hare was skipping and jumping on the green.    But it wasn't for long; who but his wife called the hounds, and set  them on him. The hare fled, the dogs followed. Round the field ran a  high wall, so that run as he might, he couldn't get out, and mightily  diverted were beggar and lady to see him twist and double.    In vain did he take refuge with his wife, she kicked him back again to  the hounds, until at length the beggar stopped the hounds, and with a  stroke of the wand, panting and breathless, the story-teller stood  before them again.    \"And how did you like the sport?\" said the beggar.    \"It might be sport to others,\" replied the story-teller looking at his  wife, \"for my part I could well put up with the loss of it.\"    \"Would it be asking too much,\" he went on to the beggar, \"to know who  you are at all, or where you come from, or why you take a pleasure in  plaguing a poor old man like me?\"    \"Oh!\" replied the stranger, \"I'm an odd kind of good-for-little fellow,  one day poor, another day rich, but if you wish to know more about me  or my habits, come with me and perhaps I may show you more than you  would make out if you went alone.\"    \"I'm not my own master to go or stay,\" said the story-teller, with a  sigh.    The stranger put one hand into his wallet and drew out of it before  their eyes a well-looking middle-aged man, to whom he spoke as follows:    \"By all you heard and saw since I put you into my wallet, take charge  of this lady and of the carriage and horses, and have them ready for me  whenever I want them.\"    Scarcely had he said these words when all vanished, and the  story-teller found himself at the Foxes' Ford, near the castle of Red  Hugh O'Donnell. He could see all but none could see him.    O'Donnell was in his hall, and heaviness of flesh and weariness of  spirit were upon him.    \"Go out,\" said he to his doorkeeper, \"and see who or what may be  coming.\"    The doorkeeper went, and what he saw was a lank, grey beggarman; half  his sword bared behind his haunch, his two shoes full of cold  road-a-wayish water sousing about him, the tips of his two ears out  through his old hat, his two shoulders out through his scant tattered  cloak, and in his hand a green wand of holly.    \"Save you, O'Donnell,\" said the lank grey beggarman.    \"And you likewise,\" said O'Donnell. \"Whence come you, and what is your  craft?\"      \"I come from the outmost stream of earth,    From the glens where the white swans glide,    A night in Islay, a night in Man,    A night on the cold hillside.\"    \"It's the great traveller you are,\" said O'Donnell.    \"Maybe you've learnt something on the road.\"    \"I am a juggler,\" said the lank grey beggarman, \"and for five pieces of  silver you shall see a trick of mine.\"    \"You shall have them,\" said O'Donnell; and the lank grey beggarman took  three small straws and placed them in his hand.    \"The middle one,\" said he, \"I'll blow away; the other two I'll leave.\"    \"Thou canst not do it,\" said one and all.    But the lank grey beggarman put a finger on either outside straw and,  whiff, away he blew the middle one.    \"'Tis a good trick,\" said O'Donnell; and he paid him his five pieces of  silver.    \"For half the money,\" said one of the chief's lads, \"I'll do the same  trick.\"    \"Take him at his word, O'Donnell.\"    The lad put the three straws on his hand, and a finger on either  outside straw and he blew; and what happened but that the fist was  blown away with the straw.    \"Thou art sore, and thou wilt be sorer,\" said O'Donnell.    \"Six more pieces, O'Donnell, and I'll do another trick for thee,\" said  the lank grey beggarman.    \"Six shalt thou have.\"    \"Seest thou my two ears! One I'll move but not t'other.\"    \"'Tis easy to see them, they're big enough, but thou canst never move  one ear and not the two together.\"    The lank grey beggarman put his hand to his ear, and he gave it a pull.    O'Donnell laughed and paid him the six pieces.    \"Call that a trick,\" said the fistless lad, \"any one can do that,\" and  so saying, he put up his hand, pulled his ear, and what happened was  that he pulled away ear and head.    \"Sore thou art; and sorer thou'lt be,\" said O'Donnell.    \"Well, O'Donnell,\" said the lank grey beggarman, \"strange are the  tricks I've shown thee, but I'll show thee a stranger one yet for the  same money.\"    \"Thou hast my word for it,\" said O'Donnell.    With that the lank grey beggarman took a bag from under his armpit, and  from out the bag a ball of silk, and he unwound the ball and he flung  it slantwise up into the clear blue heavens, and it became a ladder;  then he took a hare and placed it upon the thread, and up it ran; again  he took out a red-eared hound, and it swiftly ran up after the hare.    \"Now,\" said the lank grey beggarman; \"has any one a mind to run after  the dog and on the course?\"    \"I will,\" said a lad of O'Donnell's.    \"Up with you then,\" said the juggler; \"but I warn you if you let my  hare be killed I'll cut off your head when you come down.\"    The lad ran up the thread and all three soon disappeared. After looking  up for a long time, the lank grey beggarman said: \"I'm afraid the hound  is eating the hare, and that our friend has fallen asleep.\"    Saying this he began to wind the thread, and down came the lad fast  asleep; and down came the red-eared hound and in his mouth the last  morsel of the hare.    He struck the lad a stroke with the edge of his sword, and so cast his  head off. As for the hound, if he used it no worse, he used it no  better.    \"It's little I'm pleased, and sore I'm angered,\" said O'Donnell, \"that  a hound and a lad should be killed at my court.\"    \"Five pieces of silver twice over for each of them,\" said the juggler,  \"and their heads shall be on them as before.\"    \"Thou shalt get that,\" said O'Donnell.    Five pieces, and again five were paid him, and lo! the lad had his head  and the hound his. And though they lived to the uttermost end of time,  the hound would never touch a hare again, and the lad took good care to  keep his eyes open.    Scarcely had the lank grey beggarman done this when he vanished from  out their sight, and no one present could say if he had flown through  the air or if the earth had swallowed him up.      He moved as wave tumbling o'er wave    As whirlwind following whirlwind,    As a furious wintry blast,    So swiftly, sprucely, cheerily,    Right proudly,    And no stop made    Until he came    To the court of Leinster's King,    He gave a cheery light leap    O'er top of turret,    Of court and city    Of Leinster's King.    Heavy was the flesh and weary the spirit of Leinster's king. 'Twas the  hour he was wont to hear a story, but send he might right and left, not  a jot of tidings about the story-teller could he get.    \"Go to the door,\" said he to his doorkeeper, \"and see if a soul is in  sight who may tell me something about my story-teller.\"    The doorkeeper went, and what he saw was a lank grey beggarman, half  his sword bared behind his haunch, his two old shoes full of cold  road-a-wayish water sousing about him, the tips of his two ears out  through his old hat, his two shoulders out through his scant tattered  cloak, and in his hand a three-stringed harp.    \"What canst thou do?\" said the doorkeeper.    \"I can play,\" said the lank grey beggarman.    \"Never fear,\" added he to the story-teller, \"thou shalt see all, and  not a man shall see thee.\"    When the king heard a harper was outside, he bade him in.    \"It is I that have the best harpers in the five-fifths of Ireland,\"  said he, and he signed them to play. They did so, and if they played,  the lank grey beggarman listened.    \"Heardst thou ever the like?\" said the king.    \"Did you ever, O king, hear a cat purring over a bowl of broth, or the  buzzing of beetles in the twilight, or a shrill tongued old woman  scolding your head off?\"    \"That I have often,\" said the king.    \"More melodious to me,\" said the lank grey beggarman, \"were the worst  of these sounds than the sweetest harping of thy harpers.\"    When the harpers heard this, they drew their swords and rushed at him,  but instead of striking him, their blows fell on each other, and soon  not a man but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7896"],[0,"The Eight Strokes of the Clock (#20)"],[1,"tentively:    \"So you think that there is some connection between the murder and the  plot which we were trying to frustrate?\"    \"Certainly,\" said she, astonished at the question.    \"Then, as that plot was hatched by a husband against his wife or by a wife  against her husband, you admit that Madame d'Ormeval ...?\"    \"Oh, no, impossible!\" she said. \"To begin with, Madame d'Ormeval did not  leave her rooms ... and then I shall never believe that pretty woman  capable.... No, no, of course there was something else....\"    \"What else?\"    \"I don't know.... You may have misunderstood what the brother and sister  were saying to each other.... You see, the murder has been committed under  quite different conditions ... at another hour and another place....\"    \"And therefore,\" concluded Renine, \"the two cases are not in any way  related?\"    \"Oh,\" she said, \"there's no making it out! It's all so strange!\"    Renine became a little satirical:    \"My pupil is doing me no credit to-day,\" he said. \"Why, here is a perfectly  simple story, unfolded before your eyes. You have seen it reeled off like  a scene in the cinema; and it all remains as obscure to you as though you  were hearing of an affair that happened in a cave a hundred miles away!\"    Hortense was confounded:    \"What are you saying? Do you mean that you have understood it? What clues  have you to go by?\"    Renine looked at his watch:    \"I have not understood everything,\" he said. \"The murder itself, the mere  brutal murder, yes. But the essential thing, that is to say, the psychology  of the crime: I've no clue to that. Only, it is twelve o'clock. The brother  and sister, seeing no one come to the appointment at the Trois Mathildes,  will go down to the beach. Don't you think that we shall learn something  then of the accomplice whom I accuse them of having and of the connection  between the two cases?\"    They reached the esplanade in front of the Hauville chalets, with the  capstans by which the fishermen haul up their boats to the beach. A number  of inquisitive persons were standing outside the door of one of the  chalets. Two coastguards, posted at the door, prevented them from entering.    The mayor shouldered his way eagerly through the crowd. He was back from  the post-office, where he had been telephoning to Le Havre, to the office  of the procurator-general, and had been told that the public prosecutor  and an examining-magistrate would come on to Etretat in the course of the  afternoon.    \"That leaves us plenty of time for lunch,\" said Renine. \"The tragedy will  not be enacted before two or three o'clock. And I have an idea that it will  be sensational.\"    They hurried nevertheless. Hortense, overwrought by fatigue and her desire  to know what was happening, continually questioned Renine, who replied  evasively, with his eyes turned to the esplanade, which they could see  through the windows of the coffee-room.    \"Are you watching for those two?\" asked Hortense.    \"Yes, the brother and sister.\"    \"Are you sure that they will venture?...\"    \"Look out! Here they come!\"    He went out quickly.    Where the main street opened on the sea-front, a lady and gentleman were  advancing with hesitating steps, as though unfamiliar with the place. The  brother was a puny little man, with a sallow complexion. He was wearing a  motoring-cap. The sister too was short, but rather stout, and was wrapped  in a large cloak. She struck them as a woman of a certain age, but still  good-looking under the thin veil that covered her face.    They saw the groups of bystanders and drew nearer. Their gait betrayed  uneasiness and hesitation.    The sister asked a question of a seaman. At the first words of his answer,  which no doubt conveyed the news of d'Ormeval's death, she uttered a cry  and tried to force her way through the crowd. The brother, learning in his  turn what had happened, made great play with his elbows and shouted to the  coast-guards:    \"I'm a friend of d'Ormeval's!... Here's my card! Frederic Astaing.... My  sister, Germaine Astaing, knows Madame d'Ormeval intimately!... They were  expecting us.... We had an appointment!...\"    They were allowed to pass. Renine, who had slipped behind them, followed  them in without a word, accompanied by Hortense.    The d'Ormevals had four bedrooms and a sitting-room on the second floor.  The sister rushed into one of the rooms and threw herself on her knees  beside the bed on which the corpse lay stretched. Therese d'Ormeval was in  the sitting-room and was sobbing in the midst of a small company of silent  persons. The brother sat down beside her, eagerly seized her hands and  said, in a trembling voice:    \"My poor friend!... My poor friend!...\"    Renine and Hortense gazed at the pair of them: and Hortense whispered:    \"And she's supposed to have killed him for that? Impossible!\"    \"Nevertheless,\" observed Renine, \"they are acquaintances; and we know that  Astaing and his sister were also acquainted with a third person who was  their accomplice. So that....\"    \"It's impossible!\" Hortense repeated.    And, in spite of all presumption, she felt so much attracted by Therese  that, when Frederic Astaing stood up, she proceeded straightway to sit down  beside her and consoled her in a gentle voice. The unhappy woman's tears  distressed her profoundly.    Renine, on the other hand, applied himself from the outset to watching  the brother and sister, as though this were the only thing that mattered,  and did not take his eyes off Frederic Astaing, who, with an air of  indifference, began to make a minute inspection of the premises, examining  the sitting-room, going into all the bedrooms, mingling with the various  groups of persons present and asking questions about the manner in which  the murder had been committed. Twice his sister came up and spoke to him.  Then he went back to Madame d'Ormeval and again sat down beside her, full  of earnest sympathy. Lastly, in the lobby, he had a long conversation with  his sister, after which they parted, like people who have come to a perfect  understanding. Frederic then left. These manoeuvers had lasted quite thirty  or forty minutes.    It was at this moment that the motor-car containing the  examining-magistrate and the public prosecutor pulled up outside the  chalets. Renine, who did not expect them until later, said to Hortense:    \"We must be quick. On no account leave Madame d'Ormeval.\"    Word was sent up to the persons whose evidence might be of any service  that they were to go to the beach, where the magistrate was beginning a  preliminary investigation. He would call on Madame d'Ormeval afterwards.  Accordingly, all who were present left the chalet. No one remained behind  except the two guards and Germaine Astaing.    Germaine knelt down for the last time beside the dead man and, bending low,  with her face in her hands, prayed for a long time. Then she rose and was  opening the door on the landing, when Renine came forward:    \"I should like a few words with you, madame.\"    She seemed surprised and replied:    \"What is it, monsieur? I am listening.\"    \"Not here.\"    \"Where then, monsieur?\"    \"Next door, in the sitting-room.\"    \"No,\" she said, sharply.    \"Why not? Though you did not even shake hands with her, I presume that  Madame d'Ormeval is your friend?\"    He gave her no time to reflect, drew her into the next room, closed the  door and, at once pouncing upon Madame d'Ormeval, who was trying to go out  and return to her own room, said:    \"No, madame, listen, I implore you. Madame Astaing's presence need not  drive you away. We have very serious matters to discuss, without losing a  minute.\"    The two women, standing face to face, were looking at each other with the  same expression of implacable hatred, in which might be read the same  confusion of spirit and the same restrained anger. Hortense, who believed  them to be friends and who might, up to a certain point, have believed them  to be accomplices, foresaw with terror the hostile encounter which she felt  to be inevitable. She compelled Madame d'Ormeval to resume her seat, while  Renine took up his position in the middle of the room and spoke in resolute  tones:    \"Chance, which has placed me in possession of part of the truth, will  enable me to save you both, if you are willing to assist me with a frank  explanation that will give me the particulars which I still need. Each of  you knows the danger in which she stands, because each of you is conscious  in her heart of the evil for which she is responsible. But you are  carried away by hatred; and it is for me to see clearly and to act. The  examining-magistrate will be here in half-an-hour. By that time, you must  have come to an agreement.\"    They both started, as though offended by such a word.    \"Yes, an agreement,\" he repeated, in a more imperious tone. \"Whether you  like it or not, you will come to an agreement. You are not the only ones to  be considered. There are your two little daughters, Madame d'Ormeval. Since  circumstances have set me in their path, I am intervening in their defence  and for their safety. A blunder, a word too much; and they are ruined. That  must not happen.\"    At the mention of her children, Madame d'Ormeval broke down and sobbed.  Germaine Astaing shrugged her shoulders and made a movement towards the  door. Renine once more blocked the way:    \"Where are you going?\"    \"I have been summoned by the examining-magistrate.\"    \"No, you have not.\"    \"Yes, I have. Just as all those have been who have any evidence to give.\"    \"You were not on the spot. You know nothing of what happened. Nobody knows  anything of the murder.\"    \"I know who committed it.\"    \"That's impossible.\"    \"It was Therese d'Ormeval.\"    The accusation was hurled forth in an outburst of rage and with a fiercely  threatening gesture.    \"You wretched creature!\" exclaimed madame d'Ormeval, rushing at her. \"Go!  Leave the room!"]]]
