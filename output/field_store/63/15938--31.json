Malaish, it is the  decree of fate, and I have no anger. I come to ask thee to save my life,  and then to give me work.\"    \"How shall I save thy life?\"    \"By reconciling the Effendina to my living, and then by giving me  service, where I shall be near to thee; where I can share with thee,  though it be as the ant beside the beaver, the work of salvation in  Egypt. I am rich since my brother was--\" He paused; no covert look was  in his eyes, no sign of knowledge, nothing but meditation and sorrowful  frankness--\"since Foorgat passed away in peace, praise be to God! He lay  on his bed in the morning, when one came to wake him, like a sleeping  child, no sign of the struggle of death upon him.\"    A gasping sound came from the chair where Hylda sat; but he took no  notice. He appeared to be unconscious of David's pain-drawn face, as  he sat with hands upon his knees, his head bent forward listening, as  though lost to the world.    \"So did Foorgat, my brother, die while yet in the fulness of his  manhood, life beating high in his veins, with years before him to  waste. He was a pleasure-lover, alas! he laid up no treasure of work  accomplished; and so it was meet that he should die as he lived, in a  moment of ease. And already he is forgotten. It is the custom here.  He might have died by diamond-dust, and men would have set down their  coffee-cups in surprise, and then would have forgotten; or he might have  been struck down by the hand of an assassin, and, unless it was in the  Palace, none would have paused to note it. And so the sands sweep over  his steps upon the shore of time.\"    After the first exclamation of horror, Hylda had sat rigid, listening  as though under a spell. Through her veil she gazed at Nahoum with a  cramping pain at her heart, for he seemed ever on the verge of the truth  she dreaded; and when he spoke the truth, as though unconsciously, she  felt she must cry out and rush from the room. He recalled to her the  scene in the little tapestried room as vividly as though it was there  before her eyes, and it had for the moment all the effect of a hideous  nightmare. At last, however, she met David's eyes, and they guided her,  for in them was a steady strength and force which gave her confidence.  At first he also had been overcome inwardly, but his nerves were cool,  his head was clear, and he listened to Nahoum, thinking out his course  meanwhile.    He owed this man much. He had taken his place, and by so doing had  placed his life in danger. He had killed the brother upon the same  day that he had dispossessed the favourite of office; and the debt was  heavy. In office Nahoum had done after his kind, after the custom of  the place and the people; and yet, as it would seem, the man had had  stirrings within him towards a higher path. He, at any rate, had not  amassed riches out of his position, and so much could not be said of  any other servant of the Prince Pasha. Much he had heard of Nahoum's  powerful will, hidden under a genial exterior, and behind his friendly,  smiling blue eyes. He had heard also of cruelty--of banishment, and of  enemies removed from his path suddenly, never to be seen again; but,  on the whole, men spoke with more admiration of him than of any other  public servant, Armenian Christian in a Mahommedan country though he  was. That very day Kaid had said that if Nahoum had been less eager to  control the State, he might still have held his place. Besides, the man  was a Christian--of a mystic, half-legendary, obscure Christianity; yet  having in his mind the old faith, its essence and its meaning, perhaps.  Might not this Oriental mind, with that faith, be a power to redeem  the land? It was a wonderful dream, in which he found the way, as he  thought, to atone somewhat to this man for a dark injury done.    When Nahoum stopped speaking David said: \"But if I would have it, if it  were well that it should be, I doubt I have the power to make it so.\"    \"Saadat-el-bdsha, Kaid believes in thee to-day; he will not believe  to-morrow if thou dost remain without initiative. Action, however  startling, will be proof of fitness. His Highness shakes a long spear.  Those who ride with him must do battle with the same valour. Excellency,  I have now great riches--since Death smote Foorgat Bey in the  forehead\"--still his eyes conveyed no meaning, though Hylda shrank  back--\"and I would use them for the good thou wouldst do here. Money  will be needed, and sufficient will not be at thy hand-not till new  ledgers be opened, new balances struck.\"    He turned to Hylda quietly, and with a continued air of innocence said:  \"Shall it not be so-madame? Thou, I doubt not, are of his kin. It would  seem so, though I ask pardon if it be not so--wilt thou not urge his  Excellency to restore me to Kaid's favour? I know little of the English,  though I know them humane and honest; but my brother, Foorgat Bey, he  was much among them, lived much in England, was a friend to many great  English. Indeed, on the evening that he died I saw him in the gallery of  the banquet-room with an English lady--can one be mistaken in an English  face? Perhaps he cared for her; perhaps that was why he smiled as he lay  upon his bed, never to move again. Madame, perhaps in England thou mayst  have known my brother. If that is so, I ask thee to speak for me to his  Excellency. My life is in danger, and I am too young to go as my brother  went. I do not wish to die in middle age, as my brother died.\"    He had gone too far. In David's mind there was no suspicion that Nahoum  knew the truth. The suggestion in his words had seemed natural; but,  from the first, a sharp suspicion was in the mind of Hylda, and his last  words had convinced her that if Nahoum did not surely know the truth,  he suspected it all too well. Her instinct had pierced far; and as she  realised his suspicions, perhaps his certainty, and heard his words of  covert insult, which, as she saw, David did not appreciate, anger and  determination grew in her. Yet she felt that caution must mark her  words, and that nothing but danger lay in resentment. She felt the  everlasting indignity behind the quiet, youthful eyes, the determined  power of the man; but she saw also that, for the present, the course  Nahoum suggested was the only course to take. And David must not even  feel the suspicion in her own mind, that Nahoum knew or suspected the  truth. If David thought that Nahoum knew, the end of all would come at  once. It was clear, however, that Nahoum meant to be silent, or he would  have taken another course of action. Danger lay in every direction, but,  to her mind, the least danger lay in following Nahoum's wish.    She slowly raised her veil, showing a face very still now, with eyes as  steady as David's. David started at her action, he thought it rash; but  the courage of it pleased him, too.    \"You are not mistaken,\" she said slowly in French; \"your brother was  known to me. I had met him in England. It will be a relief to all his  friends to know that he passed away peacefully.\" She looked him in the  eyes determinedly. \"Monsieur Claridge is not my kinsman, but he is my  fellow-countryman. If you mean well by monsieur, your knowledge and your  riches should help him on his way. But your past is no guarantee of good  faith, as you will acknowledge.\"    He looked her in the eyes with a far meaning. \"But I am giving  guarantees of good faith now,\" he said softly. \"Will you--not?\"    She understood. It was clear that he meant peace, for the moment at  least.    \"If I had influence I would advise him to reconcile you to Prince Kaid,\"  she said quietly, then turned to David with an appeal in her eyes.    David stood up. \"I will do what I can,\" he said. \"If thee means as well  by Egypt as I mean by thee, all may be well for all.\"    \"Saadat! Saadat!\" said Nahoum, with show of assumed feeling, and made  salutation. Then to Hylda, making lower salutation still, he said: \"Thou  hast lifted from my neck the yoke. Thou hast saved me from the shadow  and the dust. I am thy slave.\" His eyes were like a child's, wide and  confiding.    He turned towards the door, and was about to open it, when there came  a knocking, and he stepped back. Hylda drew down her veil. David opened  the door cautiously and admitted Mizraim the Chief Eunuch. Mizraim's  eyes searched the room, and found Nahoum.    \"Pasha,\" he said to Nahoum, \"may thy bones never return to dust, nor the  light of thine eyes darken! There is danger.\"    Nahoum nodded, but did not speak.    \"Shall I speak, then?\" He paused and made low salutation to David,  saying, \"Excellency, I am thine ox to be slain.\"    \"Speak, son of the flowering oak,\" said Nahoum, with a sneer in his  voice. \"What blessing dost thou bring?\"    \"The Effendina has sent for thee.\"    Nahoum's eyes flashed. \"By thee, lion of Abdin?\" The lean, ghastly being  smiled. \"He has sent a company of soldiers and Achmet Pasha.\"    \"Achmet! Is it so? They are here, Mizraim, watcher of the morning?\"    \"They are at thy palace--I am here, light of Egypt.\"    \"How knewest thou I was here?\"    Mizraim salaamed. \"A watch was set upon thee this morning early. The  watcher was of my slaves. He brought the word to me that thou wast here  now. A watcher also was set upon thee, Excellency\"--he turned to David.  \"He also was of my slaves. Word was delivered to his Highness that  thou\"--he turned to Nahoum again--\"wast in thy palace, and Achmet Pasha  went thither. He found thee not. Now the city is full of watchers, and  Achmet goes from bazaar to bazaar, from house to house which thou was  wont to frequent--and thou art here.\"    \"What wouldst thou have me do, Mizraim?\"    \"Thou art here; is it the house of a friend or a foe?\" Nahoum did  not answer. His eyes were fixed in thought upon the floor, but he was  smiling. He seemed without fear.    \"But if this be the house of a friend, is he safe here?\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6312"],[0,"Representative Men: Seven Lectures (#20)"],[1,"League, which converted every house into a fort,  Montaigne kept his gates open, and his house without defense. All  parties freely came and went, his courage and honor being universally  esteemed. The neighboring lords and gentry brought jewels and papers  to him for safekeeping. Gibbon reckons, in these bigoted times, but  two men of liberality in France,--Henry IV. and Montaigne.    Montaigne is the frankest and honestest of all writers. His French  freedom runs into grossness; but he has anticipated all censures by  the bounty of his own confessions. In his times, books were written  to one sex only, and almost all were written in Latin; so that, in a  humorist, a certain nakedness of statement was permitted, which our  manners, of a literature addressed equally to both sexes, do not allow.  But, though a biblical plainness, coupled with a most uncanonical  levity, may shut his pages to many sensitive readers, yet the offence  is superficial. He parades it: he makes the most of it; nobody can  think or say worse of him than he does. He pretends to most of the  vices; and, if there be any virtue in him, he says, it got in by  stealth. There is no man, in his opinion, who has not deserved hanging  five or six times; and he pretends no exception in his own behalf.  \"Five or six as ridiculous stories,\" too, he says, \"can be told of me,  as of any man living.\" But, with all this really superfluous frankness,  the opinion of an invincible probity grows into every reader's mind.    \"When I the most strictly and religiously confess myself, I find that  the best virtue I have has in it some tincture of vice; and I am afraid  that Plato, in his purest virtue (I, who am as sincere and perfect a  lover of virtue of that stamp as any other whatever), if he had  listened, and laid his ear close to himself, would have heard some  jarring sound of human mixture; but faint and remote, and only to be  perceived by himself.\"    Here is an impatience and fastidiousness at color or pretense of any  kind. He has been in courts so long as to have conceived a furious  disgust at appearances; he will indulge himself with a little cursing  and swearing; he will talk with sailors and gypsies, use flash and  street ballads; he has stayed indoors till he is deadly sick; he will  to the open air, though it rain bullets. He has seen too much of  gentlemen of the long robe, until he wishes for cannibals; and is so  nervous, by factitious life, that he thinks, the more barbarous man  is, the better he is. He likes his saddle. You may read theology, and  grammar, and metaphysics elsewhere. Whatever you get here, shall smack  of the earth and of real life, sweet, or smart, or stinging. He makes  no hesitation to entertain you with the records of his disease; and  his journey to Italy is quite full of that matter. He took and kept  this position of equilibrium. Over his name, he drew an emblematic  pair of scales, and wrote, _Que sais-je?_ under it. As I look at  his effigy opposite the title-page, I seem to hear him say, \"You may  play old Poz, if you will; you may rail and exaggerate,--I stand here  for truth, and will not, for all the states, and churches, and revenues,  and personal reputations of Europe, overstate the dry fact, as I see  it; I will rather mumble and prose about what I certainly know,--my  house and barns; my father, my wife, and my tenants; my old lean bald  pate; my knives and forks; what meats I eat, and what drinks I prefer;  and a hundred straws just as ridiculous,--than I will write, with a  fine crow-quill, a fine romance. I like gray days, and autumn and  winter weather. I am gray and autumnal myself, and think an undress,  and old shoes that do not pinch my feet, and old friends who do not  constrain me, and plain topics where I do not need to strain myself  and pump my brains, the most suitable. Our condition as men is risky  and ticklish enough. One cannot be sure of himself and his fortune an  hour, but he may be whisked off into some pitiable or ridiculous plight.  Why should I vapor and play the philosopher, instead of ballasting,  the best I can, this dancing balloon? So, at least, I live within  compass, keep myself ready for action, and can shoot the gulf, at last,  with decency. If there be anything farcical in such a life, the blame  is not mine; let it lie at fate's and nature's door.\"    The Essays, therefore, are an entertaining soliloquy on every random  topic that comes into his head; treating everything without ceremony,  yet with masculine sense. There have been men with deeper insight;  but, one would say, never a man with such abundance of thoughts; he  is never dull, never insincere, and has the genius to make the reader  care for all that he cares for.    The sincerity and marrow of the man reaches to his sentences. I know  not anywhere the book that seems less written. It is the language of  conversation transferred to a book. Cut these words, and they would  bleed; they are vascular and alive. One has the same pleasure in it  that we have in listening to the necessary speech of men about their  work, when any unusual circumstance give momentary importance to the  dialogue. For blacksmiths and teamsters do not trip in their speech;  it is a shower of bullets. It is Cambridge men who correct themselves,  and begin again at every half-sentence, and, moreover, will pun, and  refine too much, and swerve from the matter to the expression. Montaigne  talks with shrewdness, knows the world, and books, and himself, and  uses the positive degree; never shrieks, or protests, or prays; no  weakness, no convulsion, no superlative; does not wish to jump out of  his skin, or play any antics, or annihilate space or time; but is stout  and solid; tastes every moment of the day; likes pain, because it makes  him feel himself, and realize things; as we pinch ourselves to know  that we are awake. He keeps the plain; he rarely mounts or sinks; likes  to feel solid ground, and the stones underneath. His writing has no  enthusiasms, no aspiration; contented, self-respecting, and keeping  the middle of the road. There is but one exception,--in his love for  Socrates. In speaking of him, for once his cheek flushes, and his style  rises to passion.    Montaigne died of a quinsy, at the age of sixty, in 1592. When he came  to die, he caused the mass to be celebrated in his chamber. At the age  of thirty-three, he had been married. \"But,\" he says, \"might I have  had my own will, I would not have married Wisdom herself, if she would  have had me; but 'tis to much purpose to evade it, the common custom  and use of life will have it so. Most of my actions are guided by  example, not choice.\" In the hour of death he gave the same weight to  custom. _Que sais-je?_ What do I know.    This book of Montaigne the world has endorsed, by translating it into  all tongues, and printing seventy-five editions of it in Europe; and  that, too, a circulation somewhat chosen, namely, among courtiers,  soldiers, princes, men of the world, and men of wit and generosity.    Shall we say that Montaigne has spoken wisely, and given the right and  permanent expression of the human mind, on the conduct of life?    We are natural believers. Truth, or the connection between cause and  effect, alone interests us. We are persuaded that a thread runs through  all things; all worlds are strung on it, as beads; and men, and events,  and life, come to us, only because of that thread; they pass and repass,  only that we may know the direction and continuity of that line. A  book or statement which goes to show that there is no line, but random  and chaos, a calamity out of nothing, a prosperity and no account of  it, a hero born from a fool, a fool from a hero,--dispirits us. Seen  or unseen, we believe the tie exists. Talent makes counterfeit ties;  genius finds the real ones. We hearken to the man of science, because  we anticipate the sequence in natural phenomena which he uncovers. We  love whatever affirms, connects, preserves; and dislike what scatters  or pulls down. One man appears whose nature is to all men's eyes  conserving and constructive; his presence supposes a well-ordered  society, agriculture, trade, large institutions, and empire. If these  did not exist, they would begin to exist through his endeavors.  Therefore, he cheers and comforts men, who feel all this in him very  readily. The nonconformist and the rebel say all manner of unanswerable  things against the existing republic, but discover to our sense no  plan of house or state of their own. Therefore, though the town, and  state, and way of living, which our counselor contemplated, might be  a very modest or musty prosperity, yet men rightly go for him, and  reject the reformer, so long as he comes only with axe and crowbar.    But though we are natural conservers and causationists, and reject a  sour, dumpish unbelief, the skeptical class, which Montaigne represents,  have reason, and every man, at some time, belongs to it. Every superior  mind will pass through this domain of equilibration,--I should rather  say, will know how to avail himself of the checks and balances in  nature, as a natural weapon against the exaggeration and formalism of  bigots and blockheads.    Skepticism is the attitude assumed by the student in relation to the  particulars which society adores, but which he sees to be reverent  only in their tendency and spirit. The ground occupied by the skeptic  is the vestibule of the temple. Society does not like to have any  breath of question blown on the existing order. But the interrogation  of custom at all points is an inevitable stage in the growth of every  superior mind, and is the evidence of its perception of the flowing  power which remains itself in all changes.    The superior mind will find itself equally at odds with the evils of  society, and with the projects that are offered to relieve them. The  wise skeptic is a bad citizen;"]]]
