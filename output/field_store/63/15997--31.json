Footsteps entered, traversed the entry, and  began to mount the stairs. How I detested the folly of not pursuing the  man when he withdrew, and bolting after him the outer door! Might he not  conceive this omission to be a proof that my angel had deserted me, and  be thereby fortified in guilt?    Every step on the stairs, which brought him nearer to my chamber, added  vigor to my desperation. The evil with which I was menaced was to be at  any rate eluded. How little did I preconceive the conduct which, in an  exigence like this, I should be prone to adopt. You will suppose that  deliberation and despair would have suggested the same course of action,  and that I should have, unhesitatingly, resorted to the best means of  personal defence within my power. A penknife lay open upon my table. I  remembered that it was there, and seized it. For what purpose you will  scarcely inquire. It will be immediately supposed that I meant it for my  last refuge, and that if all other means should fail, I should plunge it  into the heart of my ravisher.    I have lost all faith in the stedfastness of human resolves. It was thus  that in periods of calm I had determined to act. No cowardice had been  held by me in greater abhorrence than that which prompted an injured  female to destroy, not her injurer ere the injury was perpetrated, but  herself when it was without remedy. Yet now this penknife appeared to  me of no other use than to baffle my assailant, and prevent the crime  by destroying myself. To deliberate at such a time was impossible; but  among the tumultuous suggestions of the moment, I do not recollect that  it once occurred to me to use it as an instrument of direct defence. The  steps had now reached the second floor. Every footfall accelerated the  completion, without augmenting, the certainty of evil. The consciousness  that the door was fast, now that nothing but that was interposed between  me and danger, was a source of some consolation. I cast my eye towards  the window. This, likewise, was a new suggestion. If the door should  give way, it was my sudden resolution to throw myself from the window.  Its height from the ground, which was covered beneath by a brick  pavement, would insure my destruction; but I thought not of that.    When opposite to my door the footsteps ceased. Was he listening whether  my fears were allayed, and my caution were asleep? Did he hope to take  me by surprize? Yet, if so, why did he allow so many noisy signals to  betray his approach? Presently the steps were again heard to approach  the door. An hand was laid upon the lock, and the latch pulled back. Did  he imagine it possible that I should fail to secure the door? A slight  effort was made to push it open, as if all bolts being withdrawn, a  slight effort only was required.    I no sooner perceived this, than I moved swiftly towards the window.  Carwin's frame might be said to be all muscle. His strength and activity  had appeared, in various instances, to be prodigious. A slight exertion  of his force would demolish the door. Would not that exertion be made?  Too surely it would; but, at the same moment that this obstacle should  yield, and he should enter the apartment, my determination was formed to  leap from the window. My senses were still bound to this object. I gazed  at the door in momentary expectation that the assault would be made. The  pause continued. The person without was irresolute and motionless.    Suddenly, it occurred to me that Carwin might conceive me to have fled.  That I had not betaken myself to flight was, indeed, the least probable  of all conclusions. In this persuasion he must have been confirmed on  finding the lower door unfastened, and the chamber door locked. Was  it not wise to foster this persuasion? Should I maintain deep silence,  this, in addition to other circumstances, might encourage the belief,  and he would once more depart. Every new reflection added plausibility  to this reasoning. It was presently more strongly enforced, when I  noticed footsteps withdrawing from the door. The blood once more flowed  back to my heart, and a dawn of exultation began to rise: but my joy was  short lived. Instead of descending the stairs, he passed to the door of  the opposite chamber, opened it, and having entered, shut it after him  with a violence that shook the house.    How was I to interpret this circumstance? For what end could he have  entered this chamber? Did the violence with which he closed the door  testify the depth of his vexation? This room was usually occupied by  Pleyel. Was Carwin aware of his absence on this night? Could he be  suspected of a design so sordid as pillage? If this were his view there  were no means in my power to frustrate it. It behoved me to seize the  first opportunity to escape; but if my escape were supposed by my  enemy to have been already effected, no asylum was more secure than the  present. How could my passage from the house be accomplished without  noises that might incite him to pursue me?    Utterly at a loss to account for his going into Pleyel's chamber, I  waited in instant expectation of hearing him come forth. All, however,  was profoundly still. I listened in vain for a considerable period, to  catch the sound of the door when it should again be opened. There was  no other avenue by which he could escape, but a door which led into the  girl's chamber. Would any evil from this quarter befall the girl?    Hence arose a new train of apprehensions. They merely added to the  turbulence and agony of my reflections. Whatever evil impended over her,  I had no power to avert it. Seclusion and silence were the only means of  saving myself from the perils of this fatal night. What solemn vows did  I put up, that if I should once more behold the light of day, I would  never trust myself again within the threshold of this dwelling!    Minute lingered after minute, but no token was given that Carwin had  returned to the passage. What, I again asked, could detain him in this  room? Was it possible that he had returned, and glided, unperceived,  away? I was speedily aware of the difficulty that attended an enterprize  like this; and yet, as if by that means I were capable of gaining any  information on that head, I cast anxious looks from the window.    The object that first attracted my attention was an human figure  standing on the edge of the bank. Perhaps my penetration was assisted  by my hopes. Be that as it will, the figure of Carwin was clearly  distinguishable. From the obscurity of my station, it was impossible  that I should be discerned by him, and yet he scarcely suffered me to  catch a glimpse of him. He turned and went down the steep, which, in  this part, was not difficult to be scaled.    My conjecture then had been right. Carwin has softly opened the door,  descended the stairs, and issued forth. That I should not have overheard  his steps, was only less incredible than that my eyes had deceived me.  But what was now to be done? The house was at length delivered from this  detested inmate. By one avenue might he again re-enter. Was it not wise  to bar the lower door? Perhaps he had gone out by the kitchen door. For  this end, he must have passed through Judith's chamber. These entrances  being closed and bolted, as great security was gained as was compatible  with my lonely condition.    The propriety of these measures was too manifest not to make me struggle  successfully with my fears. Yet I opened my own door with the utmost  caution, and descended as if I were afraid that Carwin had been still  immured in Pleyel's chamber. The outer door was a-jar. I shut, with  trembling eagerness, and drew every bolt that appended to it. I then  passed with light and less cautious steps through the parlour, but was  surprized to discover that the kitchen door was secure. I was compelled  to acquiesce in the first conjecture that Carwin had escaped through the  entry.    My heart was now somewhat eased of the load of apprehension. I returned  once more to my chamber, the door of which I was careful to lock. It was  no time to think of repose. The moon-light began already to fade before  the light of the day. The approach of morning was betokened by the usual  signals. I mused upon the events of this night, and determined to take  up my abode henceforth at my brother's. Whether I should inform him  of what had happened was a question which seemed to demand some  consideration. My safety unquestionably required that I should abandon  my present habitation.    As my thoughts began to flow with fewer impediments, the image of  Pleyel, and the dubiousness of his condition, again recurred to me. I  again ran over the possible causes of his absence on the preceding day.  My mind was attuned to melancholy. I dwelt, with an obstinacy for which  I could not account, on the idea of his death. I painted to myself his  struggles with the billows, and his last appearance. I imagined myself  a midnight wanderer on the shore, and to have stumbled on his corpse,  which the tide had cast up. These dreary images affected me even to  tears. I endeavoured not to restrain them. They imparted a relief which  I had not anticipated. The more copiously they flowed, the more did  my general sensations appear to subside into calm, and a certain  restlessness give way to repose.    Perhaps, relieved by this effusion, the slumber so much wanted might  have stolen on my senses, had there been no new cause of alarm.        Chapter XI      I was aroused from this stupor by sounds that evidently arose in the  next chamber. Was it possible that I had been mistaken in the figure  which I had seen on the bank? or had Carwin, by some inscrutable means,  penetrated once more into this chamber? The opposite door opened;  footsteps came forth, and the person, advancing to mine, knocked.

There will be grand rejoicings to-night, on the  return of the prisoners. All will be dancing and jollity; plays will be  performed; the villages will re-echo with the report of fire-arms and the  clamor of drums; and the whole population will hold a feast of bullocks.    20.--Anchored at Cape Palmas. The natives here were alarmed at the return  of the three ships; and many of them carried away their moveables into the  woods. News of the destruction of the towns below had reached them several  days since. They have a simple, but very effective system of expresses.  When information of great interest is to be conveyed from tribe to tribe,  one of their swiftest runners is despatched, who makes what speed he can,  and, when tired, entrusts his message to another. Thus it is speeded on,  without a moment's delay. Should the runner encounter a river in his  course, he shouts his news across; it is caught up on the other side, and  immediately sent forward. In this manner, intelligence finds its way along  the coast with marvellous celerity.    23.--We sailed two days ago. Yesterday, there came off from the shore,  some six or eight miles, a couple of canoes, paddled by six men each, who  exerted themselves to the utmost to overtake us. They had nothing to sell;  and their only object seemed to be, to obtain the particulars of the fight  and conflagration at Little Berebee, a hundred and fifty miles below.    25.--Anchored at Monrovia, and landed Governor Roberts, who, with Dr.  Johnson, had been a passenger from Cape Palmas.    28.--Sailed for Porto Praya, with the intention of visiting Madeira,  before returning to the coast.

Our ship rides gently at her anchor. The Loo rock rises fifty feet  perpendicular from the water, at so short a distance, that we can hear the  drum beat tattoo in the small, inaccessible castle, on its summit. This  rock is the outpost of the city of Funchal. The city stretches along the  narrow strip of level ground, near the shore, with vine-clad hills rising  steeply behind. On the slopes of these eminences are many large houses,  surrounded with splendid gardens, and occupied by wealthy inhabitants,  chiefly Englishmen, who have retired upon their fortunes, or are still  engaged in business. On a height to the left, stands a castle of  considerable size, in good repair. High up among the hills, in bold  relief, is seen the church of Our Lady of the Mount, with its white walls  and two towers. The hills are rugged, steep, and furrowed with deep  ravines, along which, after the heavy rains of winter, the mountain  torrents dash headlong to the sea.    My remarks on Madeira will be thrown together without the regularity of a  daily journal; for our visit to the island proves so delightful, that it  seems better worth the while to enjoy, than to describe it.    The annual races are well attended. During their continuance, throngs of  passengers, on foot, on horseback, and in palanquins, are continually  proceeding to the course, a little more than a mile and a half from town.  The road thither constantly ascends, until you find yourself several  hundred feet above the sea, with an extensive prospect beneath and around.  A tolerable space for the track is here afforded by an oblong plain,  seven-eighths of a mile in length. Near the judges' stand was a large  collection of persons of all classes, ladies, dandies, peasants, and  jockeys. Here, too, were booths for the sale of eatables and drinkables,  and a band of music to enliven the scene.    These musicians saw fit to honor us in a very particular manner. They had  all agreed to ship on board our vessel; and, with a view to please their  new masters, when three or four of our officers rode into the course, they  played \"Hail Columbia.\" We took off our caps in acknowledgment, and  thought it all very fine. Directly afterwards, two other officers rode in,  and were likewise saluted with \"Hail Columbia!\" Anon, two or three of us  dismounted and strolled about among the people, thinking nothing of the  band, until we were reminded of their proximity by the old tune again. In  short, every motion on our part, however innocent and unpretending, caused  the hills of Madeira to resound with the echoes of our national air.  Finding that our position assumed a cast of the ridiculous, we gave the  leader to understand, that, if the tune were played again, the band's  first experience of maritime life should be a flogging at the gangway. The  hint was sufficient; not only did we hear no more of \"Hail Columbia,\" but  none of the musicians ever came near the ship.    With few exceptions the running was wretched. One or two of the  match-races (which were ten in number, all single heats, of a mile each)  were well contested. The first was run by two ponies; a fat black one with  a chubby boy on his back, and a red, which, as well as his rider, was in  better racing condition. The black was beaten out of sight. The second  race was by two other ponies, one of which took the lead, and evidently  had the heels of his antagonist. Suddenly, however, he bolted, and leaped  the wall, leaving the track to be trotted over by the slower colt. Two  grey horses succeeded, and made pretty running; but their riders, instead  of attending to business, joined hands, and rode a quarter of a mile in  this amiable attitude. Rather than antagonists, one would have taken them  for twin brethren, like two other famous horsemen, Castor and Pollux. To  the ladies this mode of racing appeared delightful; but the remarks of our  party, consisting of several English and American officers and gentlemen,  were anything but complimentary. The last quarter of this heat was well  run, one of the horses winning apparently by a neck. The judge, however, a  Portuguese, decided that it was a dead heat.    At one extremity of the course, the hill rises abruptly; and here were  hundreds of persons of both sexes, in an excellent position to see the  running, and to impart a pretty effect to the scene. A large number of  peasantry were present, dressed in their peculiar costume, and taking  great interest in the whole matter. Both men and women wear a little blue  cap lined with scarlet, so small that one wonders how it sticks on the  head. In shape it is like an inverted funnel, running up to a sharp point.  The women have short, full dresses, with capes of a dark blue, trimmed  with a lighter blue, or of scarlet with blue trimming. These colors form a  sectional distinction; the girls of the north side of the island wearing  the scarlet capes, and those of the south side, the blue. In the intervals  of the races, ladies and gentlemen cantered round the course, and some of  them raced with their friends. Three Scottish ladies, with more youth than  beauty, and dressed in their plaids, made themselves conspicuous by their  bold riding, and quite carried off the palm of horsemanship from their  cavaliers.    A sketch of Madeira would be incomplete indeed, without some mention of  its wines. Three years ago, when it was more a matter of personal  interest, I visited this island, and gained considerable information on  the subject. Madeira then produced about thirty thousand pipes annually,  one third of which was consumed on the island, one-third distilled into  brandy, and the remainder exported. About one-third of the exportation  went to the United States, and the balance to other parts of the world.  The best wines are principally sent to our own country--that is to say,  the best exported--for very little of the first-rate wine goes out of the  island. The process of adulteration is as thoroughly understood and  practised here, as anywhere else. The wine sent to the United States is a  kind that has been heated, to give it an artificial age. The mode of  operation is simply to pour the wine into large vats, and submit it for  several days to a heat of about 110º. After this ordeal, the wine is not  much improved by keeping.    There are other modes of adulteration, into the mysteries of which I was  not admitted. One fact, communicated to me by an eminent wine-merchant,  may shake the faith of our connoisseurs as to the genuineness of their  favorite beverage. It is, that, from a single pipe of \"mother wine,\" ten  pipes are manufactured by the help of inferior wine. This \"mother wine\" is  that which has been selected for its excellence, and is seldom exported  pure. The wines, when fresh from the vintage, are as various in their  flavor as our cider. It is by taste and _smell_ that the various kinds  are selected, after which the poorer wines are distilled into brandy, and  the better are put in cases, and placed in store to ripen. The liquor is  from time to time racked off, and otherwise managed until ready for  exportation. It is _invariably_ \"treated\" with brandy. French brandy was  formerly used, which being now prohibited, that of the island is  substituted, although of an inferior quality.    Besides the \"Madeira wine,\" so famous among convivialists, there are  others of higher price and superior estimation. There is the \"Sercial,\"  distinguished by a kind of Poppy taste. There is the Malmsey, or \"Ladies'  wine,\" and the \"Vina Tinta,\" or Madeira Claret, as it is sometimes called.  The latter is made of the black grapes, in a peculiar manner.
