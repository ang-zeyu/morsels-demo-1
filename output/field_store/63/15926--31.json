Would you I die, to silent grief a prey?  Then count me even now as dead and cold;    Would you I tell my woes in some new way?  Then shall my tale by Love itself be told.  The unison of opposites to prove,    Of the soft wax and diamond hard am I;  But still, obedient to the laws of love,    Here, hard or soft, I offer you my breast,    Whate'er you grave or stamp thereon shall rest      Indelible for all eternity.    With an \"Ah me!\" that seemed to be drawn from the inmost recesses of his  heart, the Knight of the Grove brought his lay to an end, and shortly  afterwards exclaimed in a melancholy and piteous voice, \"O fairest and  most ungrateful woman on earth! What! can it be, most serene Casildea de  Vandalia, that thou wilt suffer this thy captive knight to waste away and  perish in ceaseless wanderings and rude and arduous toils? It is not  enough that I have compelled all the knights of Navarre, all the Leonese,  all the Tartesians, all the Castilians, and finally all the knights of La  Mancha, to confess thee the most beautiful in the world?\"    \"Not so,\" said Don Quixote at this, \"for I am of La Mancha, and I have  never confessed anything of the sort, nor could I nor should I confess a  thing so much to the prejudice of my lady's beauty; thou seest how this  knight is raving, Sancho. But let us listen, perhaps he will tell us more  about himself.\"    \"That he will,\" returned Sancho, \"for he seems in a mood to bewail  himself for a month at a stretch.\"    But this was not the case, for the Knight of the Grove, hearing voices  near him, instead of continuing his lamentation, stood up and exclaimed  in a distinct but courteous tone, \"Who goes there? What are you? Do you  belong to the number of the happy or of the miserable?\"    \"Of the miserable,\" answered Don Quixote.    \"Then come to me,\" said he of the Grove, \"and rest assured that it is to  woe itself and affliction itself you come.\"    Don Quixote, finding himself answered in such a soft and courteous  manner, went over to him, and so did Sancho.    The doleful knight took Don Quixote by the arm, saying, \"Sit down here,  sir knight; for, that you are one, and of those that profess  knight-errantry, it is to me a sufficient proof to have found you in this  place, where solitude and night, the natural couch and proper retreat of  knights-errant, keep you company.\" To which Don made answer, \"A knight I  am of the profession you mention, and though sorrows, misfortunes, and  calamities have made my heart their abode, the compassion I feel for the  misfortunes of others has not been thereby banished from it. From what  you have just now sung I gather that yours spring from love, I mean from  the love you bear that fair ingrate you named in your lament.\"    In the meantime, they had seated themselves together on the hard ground  peaceably and sociably, just as if, as soon as day broke, they were not  going to break one another's heads.    \"Are you, sir knight, in love perchance?\" asked he of the Grove of Don  Quixote.    \"By mischance I am,\" replied Don Quixote; \"though the ills arising from  well-bestowed affections should be esteemed favours rather than  misfortunes.\"    \"That is true,\" returned he of the Grove, \"if scorn did not unsettle our  reason and understanding, for if it be excessive it looks like revenge.\"    \"I was never scorned by my lady,\" said Don Quixote.    \"Certainly not,\" said Sancho, who stood close by, \"for my lady is as a  lamb, and softer than a roll of butter.\"    \"Is this your squire?\" asked he of the Grove.    \"He is,\" said Don Quixote.    \"I never yet saw a squire,\" said he of the Grove, \"who ventured to speak  when his master was speaking; at least, there is mine, who is as big as  his father, and it cannot be proved that he has ever opened his lips when  I am speaking.\"    \"By my faith then,\" said Sancho, \"I have spoken, and am fit to speak, in  the presence of one as much, or even--but never mind--it only makes it  worse to stir it.\"    The squire of the Grove took Sancho by the arm, saying to him, \"Let us  two go where we can talk in squire style as much as we please, and leave  these gentlemen our masters to fight it out over the story of their  loves; and, depend upon it, daybreak will find them at it without having  made an end of it.\"    \"So be it by all means,\" said Sancho; \"and I will tell your worship who I  am, that you may see whether I am to be reckoned among the number of the  most talkative squires.\"    With this the two squires withdrew to one side, and between them there  passed a conversation as droll as that which passed between their masters  was serious.          CHAPTER XIII.    IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE KNIGHT OF THE GROVE, TOGETHER  WITH THE SENSIBLE, ORIGINAL, AND TRANQUIL COLLOQUY THAT PASSED BETWEEN  THE TWO SQUIRES      The knights and the squires made two parties, these telling the story of  their lives, the others the story of their loves; but the history relates  first of all the conversation of the servants, and afterwards takes up  that of the masters; and it says that, withdrawing a little from the  others, he of the Grove said to Sancho, \"A hard life it is we lead and  live, senor, we that are squires to knights-errant; verily, we eat our  bread in the sweat of our faces, which is one of the curses God laid on  our first parents.\"    \"It may be said, too,\" added Sancho, \"that we eat it in the chill of our  bodies; for who gets more heat and cold than the miserable squires of  knight-errantry? Even so it would not be so bad if we had something to  eat, for woes are lighter if there's bread; but sometimes we go a day or  two without breaking our fast, except with the wind that blows.\"    \"All that,\" said he of the Grove, \"may be endured and put up with when we  have hopes of reward; for, unless the knight-errant he serves is  excessively unlucky, after a few turns the squire will at least find  himself rewarded with a fine government of some island or some fair  county.\"    \"I,\" said Sancho, \"have already told my master that I shall be content  with the government of some island, and he is so noble and generous that  he has promised it to me ever so many times.\"    \"I,\" said he of the Grove, \"shall be satisfied with a canonry for my  services, and my master has already assigned me one.\"    \"Your master,\" said Sancho, \"no doubt is a knight in the Church line, and  can bestow rewards of that sort on his good squire; but mine is only a  layman; though I remember some clever, but, to my mind, designing people,  strove to persuade him to try and become an archbishop. He, however,  would not be anything but an emperor; but I was trembling all the time  lest he should take a fancy to go into the Church, not finding myself fit  to hold office in it; for I may tell you, though I seem a man, I am no  better than a beast for the Church.\"    \"Well, then, you are wrong there,\" said he of the Grove; \"for those  island governments are not all satisfactory; some are awkward, some are  poor, some are dull, and, in short, the highest and choicest brings with  it a heavy burden of cares and troubles which the unhappy wight to whose  lot it has fallen bears upon his shoulders. Far better would it be for us  who have adopted this accursed service to go back to our own houses, and  there employ ourselves in pleasanter occupations--in hunting or fishing,  for instance; for what squire in the world is there so poor as not to  have a hack and a couple of greyhounds and a fishingrod to amuse himself  with in his own village?\"    \"I am not in want of any of those things,\" said Sancho; \"to be sure I  have no hack, but I have an ass that is worth my master's horse twice  over; God send me a bad Easter, and that the next one I am to see, if I  would swap, even if I got four bushels of barley to boot. You will laugh  at the value I put on my Dapple--for dapple is the colour of my beast. As  to greyhounds, I can't want for them, for there are enough and to spare  in my town; and, moreover, there is more pleasure in sport when it is at  other people's expense.\"    \"In truth and earnest, sir squire,\" said he of the Grove, \"I have made up  my mind and determined to have done with these drunken vagaries of these  knights, and go back to my village, and bring up my children; for I have  three, like three Oriental pearls.\"    \"I have two,\" said Sancho, \"that might be presented before the Pope  himself, especially a girl whom I am breeding up for a countess, please  God, though in spite of her mother.\"    \"And how old is this lady that is being bred up for a countess?\" asked he  of the Grove.    \"Fifteen, a couple of years more or less,\" answered Sancho; \"but she is  as tall as a lance, and as fresh as an April morning, and as strong as a  porter.\"    \"Those are gifts to fit her to be not only a countess but a nymph of the  greenwood,\" said he of the Grove; \"whoreson strumpet! what pith the rogue  must have!\"    To which Sancho made answer, somewhat sulkily, \"She's no strumpet, nor  was her mother, nor will either of them be, please God, while I live;  speak more civilly; for one bred up among knights-errant, who are  courtesy itself, your words don't seem to me to be very becoming.\"    \"O how little you know about compliments, sir squire,\" returned he of the  Grove. \"What! don't you know that when a horseman delivers a good lance  thrust at the bull in the plaza, or when anyone does anything very well,  the people are wont to say, 'Ha, whoreson rip! how well he has done it!'  and that what seems to be abuse in the expression is high praise? Disown  sons and daughters, senor, who don't do what deserves that compliments of  this sort should be paid to their parents.\"    \"I do disown them,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/597"],[0,"The Story of Burnt Njal: The Great Icelandic Tribune, Jurist, and Counsellor (#20)"],[1,"greatest honour to thee, ere this Thing comes to an end.  As for  us, we will all back thee with counsel and force.\"    Gunnar thanked him and rode home.    Otkell rides to the Thing, and his brothers with him and  Skamkell.        51. OF GUNNAR    Gunnar rode to the Thing and all the sons of Sigfus; Njal and his  sons too, they all went with Gunnar; and it was said that no band  was so well knit and hardy as theirs.    Gunnar went one day to the booth of the Dalemen; Hrut was by the  booth and Hauskuld, and they greeted Gunnar well.  Now Gunnar  tells them the whole story of the suit up to that time.    \"What counsel gives Njal?\" asks Hrut.    \"He bade me seek you brothers,\" says Gunnar, \"and said he was  sure that he and you would look at the matter in the same light.\"    \"He wishes then,\" says Hrut, \"that I should say what I think  for kinship's sake; and so it shall be.  Thou shalt challenge  Gizur the White to combat on the island, if they do not leave the  whole award to thee; but Kolskegg shall challenge Geir the  Priest.  As for Otkell and his crew, men must be got ready to  fall on them; and now we have such great strength all of us  together, that thou mayst carry out whatever thou wilt.\"    Gunnar went home to his booth and told Njal.    \"Just what I looked for,\" said Njal.    Wolf Aurpriest got wind of this plan, and told Gizur, and Gizur  said to Otkell, \"Who gave thee that counsel that thou shouldst  summon Gunnar?\"    \"Skamkell told me that was the counsel of both Geir the Priest  and thyself.\"    \"But where is that scoundrel?\" says Gizur, \"who has thus lied.\"    \"He lies sick up at our booth,\" says Otkell.    \"May he never rise from his bed,\" says Gizur.  \"Now we must all  go to see Gunnar, and offer him the right to make his own award;  but I know not whether he will take that now.\"    Many men spoke ill of Skamkell, and he lay sick all through the  Thing.    Gizur and his friends went to Gunnar's booth; their coming was  known, and Gunnar was told as he sat in his booth, and then they  all went out and stood in array.    Gizur the White came first, and after a while he spoke and said,  \"This is our offer -- that thou, Gunnar, makest thine own award  in this suit.\"    \"Then,\" says Gunnar, \"it was no doubt far from thy counsel that I  was summoned.\"    \"I gave no such counsel,\" says Gizur, \"neither I nor Geir.\"    \"Then thou must clear thyself of this charge by fitting proof.\"    \"What proof dost thou ask?\" says Gizur.    \"That thou takest an oath,\" says Gunnar.    \"That I will do,\" says Gizur, \"if thou wilt take the award into  thine own hands.\"    \"That was the offer I made a while ago,\" says Gunnar; \"but now,  methinks, I have a greater matter to pass judgment on.\"    \"It will not be right to refuse to make thine own award,\" said  Njal; \"for the greater the matter, the greater the honour in  making it.\"    \"Well,\" said Gunnar, \"I will do this to please my friends, and  utter my award; but I give Otkell this bit of advice, never to  give me cause for quarrel hereafter.\"    Then Hrut and Hauskuld were sent for, and they came thither, and  then Gizur the White and Gier the Priest took their oaths; but  Gunnar made his award, and spoke with no man about it, and  afterwards he uttered it as follows:    \"This is my award,\" he says; \"first, I lay it down that the  storehouse must be paid for, and the food that was therein; but  for the thrall, I will pay thee no fine, for that thou hiddest  his faults; but I award him back to thee; for as the saying is,  `Birds of a feather flock most together.'  Then, on the other  hand, I see that thou hast summoned me in scorn and mockery, and  for that I award to myself no less a sum than what the house that  was burnt and the stores in it were worth; but if ye think it  better that we be not set at one again, then I will let you have  your choice of that, but if so I have already made up my mind  what I shall do, and then I will fulfil my purpose.\"    \"What we ask,\" said Gizur, \"is that thou shouldst not be hard on  Otkell, but we beg this of thee, on the other hand, that thou  wouldst be his friend.\"    \"That shall never be,\" said Gunnar, \"so long as I live; but he  shall have Skamkell's friendship; on that he has long leant.\"    \"Well,\" answers Gizur, \"we will close with thee in this matter,  though thou alone layest down the terms.\"    Then all this atonement was made and hands were shaken on it, and  Gunnar said to Otkell, \"It were wiser to go away to thy kinsfolk;  but if thou wilt be here in this country, mind that thou givest  me no cause of quarrel.\"    \"That is wholesome counsel,\" said Gizur; \"and so he shall do.\"    So Gunnar had the greatest honour from that suit, and afterwards  men rode home from the Thing.    Now Gunnar sits in his house at home, and so things are quiet for  a while.        52. OF RUNOLF, THE SON OF WOLF AURPRIEST    There was a man named Runolf, the son of Wolf Aurpriest, he kept  house at the Dale, east of Markfleet.  He was Otkell's guest once  when he rode from the Thing.  Otkell gave him an ox, all black,  without a spot of white, nine winters old.  Runolf thanked him  for the gift, and bade him come and see him at home whenever he  chose to go; and this bidding stood over for some while, so that  he had not paid the visit.  Runolf often sent men to him and put  him in mind that he ought to come; and he always said he would  come, but never went.    Now Otkell had two horses, dun coloured, with a black stripe down  the back; they were the best steeds to ride in all the country  round, and so fond of each other that whenever one went before  the other ran after him.    There was an Easterling staying with Otkell, whose name was  Audulf; he had set his heart on Signy, Otkell's daughter.  Audulf  was a tall man in growth, and strong.        53. HOW OTKELL RODE OVER GUNNAR    It happened next spring that Otkell said that they would ride  east to the Dale, to pay Runolf a visit, and all showed  themselves well pleased at that.  Skamkell and his two brothers,  and Audulf and three men more, went along with Otkell.  Otkell  rode one of the dun horses, but the other ran loose by his side.  They shaped their course east towards Markfleet; and now Otkell  gallops ahead, and now the horses race against each other, and  they break away from the path up towards the Fleetlithe.    Now, Otkell goes faster than he wished, and it happened that  Gunnar had gone away from home out of his house all alone; and he  had a corn-sieve in one hand, but in the other a hand-axe.  He  goes down to his seed field and sows his corn there, and had laid  his cloak of fine stuff and his axe down by his side, and so he  sows the corn a while.    Now, it must be told how Otkell rides faster than he would.  He  had spurs on his feet, and so he gallops down over the ploughed  field, and neither of them sees the other; and just as Gunnar  stands upright, Otkell rides down upon him and drives one of the  spurs into Gunnar's ear, and gives him a great gash, and it  bleeds at once much.    Just then Otkell's companions rode up.    \"Ye may see, all of you,\" says Gunnar, \"that thou hast drawn my  blood, and it is unworthy to go on so.  First thou hast summoned  me, but now thou treadest me under foot, and ridest over me.\"    Skamkell said, \"Well it was no worse, master, but thou wast not  one whit less wroth at the Thing, when thou tookest the selfdoom  and clutchedst thy bill.\"    Gunnar said, \"When we two next meet thou shalt see the bill.\"  After that they part thus, and Skamkell shouted out and said, \"Ye  ride hard, lads!\"    Gunnar went home, and said never a word to any one about what had  happened, and no one thought that this wound could have come by  man's doing.    It happened, though, one day, that he told it to his brother  Kolskegg, and Kolskegg said, \"This thou shalt tell to more men,  so that it may not be said that thou layest blame on dead men;  for it will be gainsaid if witnesses do not know beforehand what  has passed between you.\"    Then Gunnar told it to his neighbours, and there was little talk  about it at first.    Otkell comes east to the Dale, and they get a hearty welcome  there, and sit there a week.    Skamkell told Runolf all about their meeting with Gunnar, and how  it had gone off; and one man happened to ask how Gunnar behaved.    \"Why,\" said Skamkell, \"if it were a low-born man it would have  been said that he had wept.\"    \"Such things are ill spoken,\" says Runolf, \"and when ye two next  meet, thou wilt have to own that there is no voice of weeping in  his frame of mind; and it will be well if better men have not to  pay for thy spite.  Now it seems to me best when ye wish to go  home that I should go with you, for Gunnar will do me no harm.\"    \"I will not have that,\" says Otkell; \"but I will ride across the  Fleet lower down.\"    Runolf gave Otkell good gifts, and said they should not see one  another again.    Otkell bade him then to bear his sons in mind if things turned  out so.        54. THE FIGHT AT RANGRIVER    Now we must take up the story, and say that Gunnar was out of  doors at Lithend, and sees his shepherd galloping up to the yard.  The shepherd rode straight into the \"town\"; and Gunnar said, \"Why  ridest thou so hard?\"    \"I would be faithful to thee,\" said the man; \"I saw men riding  down along Markfleet, eight of them together, and four of them  were in coloured clothes.\"    Gunnar said, \"That must be Otkell.\"    The lad said, \"I have often heard many temper-trying words of  Skamkell's; for Skamkell spoke away there east at Dale, and said  that thou sheddest tears when they rode over thee; but I tell it  thee because I cannot bear to listen to such speeches of  worthless men.\"    \"We must not be word-sick,\" says Gunnar, \"but from this day forth  thou shall do no other work than what thou choosest for thyself.\"    \"Shall I say aught of this to Kolskegg thy brother?\" asked the  shepherd.    \"Go thou and sleep,"]]]
