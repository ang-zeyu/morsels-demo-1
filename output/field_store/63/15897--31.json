These considerations often led many  thinkers, ancient and modern, to the pessimistic view of life.  What  is the use of your exertion, they would say, in accumulating wealth,  which is doomed to melt away in the twinkling of an eye?  What is the  use of your striving after power, which is more short-lived than a  bubble?  What is the use of your endeavour in the reformation of  society, which does not endure any longer than the castle in the air?   How do kings differ from beggars in the eye of Transience?  How do  the rich differ from the poor, how the beautiful from the ugly, bow  the young from the old, how the good from the evil, how the lucky  from the unlucky, how the wise from the unwise, in the court of  Death?  Vain is ambition.  Vain is fame.  Vain is pleasure.  Vain are  struggles and efforts.  All is in vain.  An ancient Hindu  thinker[FN#144] says:    \"O saint, what is the use of the enjoyment of pleasures in this  offensive, pithless body--a mere mass of bones, skins, sinews,  marrow, and flesh?  What is the use of the enjoyment of pleasures in  this body, which is assailed by lust, hatred, greed, delusion, fear,  anguish, jealousy, separation from what is loved, union with what is  not loved, hunger, old age, death, illness, grief, and other evils?  In such a world as this, what is the use of the enjoyment of  pleasures, if he who has fed on them is to return to this world again  and again?  In this world I am like a frog in a dry well.\"      [FN#144]  Maitrayana Upanisad.      It is this consideration on the transitoriness of life that led some  Taoist in China to prefer death to life, as expressed in Chwang Tsz  (Su-shi):[FN#145]    \"When Kwang-zze went to Khu, he saw an empty skull, bleached indeed,  but still retaining its shape.  Tapping it with his horse-switch, he  asked it saying: 'Did you, sir, in your greed of life, fail in the  lessons of reason and come to this?  Or did you do so, in the service  of a perishing state, by the punishment of an axe?  Or was it through  your evil conduct, reflecting disgrace on your parents and on your  wife and children?  Or was it through your hard endurances of cold  and hunger?  Or was it that you had completed your term of life?'    \"Having given expression to these questions, he took up the skull and  made a pillow of it, and went to sleep.  At midnight the skull  appeared to him in a dream, and said: 'What you said to me was after  the fashion of an orator.  All your words were about the  entanglements of men in their lifetime.  There are none of those  things after death.  Would you like to hear me, sir, tell you about  death?'  'I should,' said Kwang-zze, and the skull resumed: 'In death  there are not (the distinctions of) ruler above minister below.  There are none of the phenomena of the four seasons.  Tranquil and at  ease, our years are those of heaven and earth.  No king in his court  has greater enjoyment than we have.'  Kwang-zze did not believe it,  and said: 'If I could get the Ruler of our Destiny to restore your  body to life with its bones and flesh and skin, and to give you back  your father and mother, your wife and children, and all your village  acquaintances, would you wish me to do so?'  The skull stared fixedly  at him, and knitted its brows and said: 'How should I cast away the  enjoyment of my royal court, and undertake again the toils of life  among mankind?'\"      [FN#145] 'Chwang Tsz,' vol. vi., p. 23.        7. Hinayanism and its Doctrine.    The doctrine of Transience was the first entrance gate of Hinayanism.   Transience never fails to deprive us of what is dear and near to us.   It disappoints us in our expectation and hope.  It brings out grief,  fear, anguish, and lamentation.  It spreads terror and destruction  among families, communities, nations, mankind.  It threatens with  perdition the whole earth, the whole universe.  Therefore it follows  that life is full of disappointment, sufferings, and miseries, and  that man is like 'a frog in a dry well.'  This is the doctrine called  by the Hinayanists the Holy Truth of Suffering.    Again, when Transcience once gets hold of our imagination, we can  easily foresee ruins and disasters in the very midst of prosperity  and happiness, and also old age and ugliness in the prime and youth  of beauty.  It gives rise quite naturally to the thought that body is  a bag full of pus and blood, a mere heap of rotten flesh and broken  pieces of bone, a decaying corpse inhabited by innumerable maggots.  This is the doctrine called by the Hinayanists the Holy Truth of  Impurity.[FN#146]      [FN#146]  Mahasaptipatthana Suttanta, 7, runs as follows: \"And,  moreover, bhikkhu, a brother, just as if he had been a body abandoned  in the charnel-field, dead for one, two, or three days, swollen,  turning black and blue, and decomposed, apply that perception to this  very body (of his own), reflecting: 'This body, too, is even so  constituted, is of such a nature, has not got beyond that (fate).'\"      And, again, Transience holds its tyrannical sway not only over the  material but over the spiritual world.  At its touch Atman, or soul,  is brought to nothing.  By its call Devas, or celestial beings, are  made to succumb to death.  It follows, therefore, that to believe in  Atman, eternal and unchanging, would be a whim of the ignorant.  This  is the doctrine called by the Hinayanists the Holy Truth of No-atman.    If, as said, there could be nothing free from Transience, Constancy  should be a gross mistake of the ignorant; if even gods have to die,  Eternity should be no more than a stupid dream of the vulgar; if all  phenomena be flowing and changing, there could be no constant noumena  underlying them.  It therefore follows that all things in the  universe are empty and unreal.  This is the doctrine called by the  Hinayanists the Holy Truth of Unreality.  Thus Hinayana Buddhism,  starting from the doctrine of Transience, arrived at the pessimistic  view of life in its extreme form.        8. Change as seen by Zen.    Zen, like Hinayanism, does not deny the doctrine of Transience, but  it has come to a view diametrically opposite to that of the Hindus.  Transience for Zen simply means change.  It is a form in which life  manifests itself.  Where there is life there is change or Transience.   Where there is more change there is more vital activity.  Suppose an  absolutely changeless body: it must be absolutely lifeless.  An  eternally changeless life is equivalent to an eternally changeless  death.  Why do we value the morning glory, which fades in a few  hours, more than an artificial glass flower, which endures hundreds  of years?  Why do we prefer an animal life, which passes away in a  few scores of years, to a vegetable life, which can exist thousands  of years?  Why do we prize changing organism more than inorganic  matter, unchanging and constant?  If there be no change in the bright  hues of a flower, it is as worthless as a stone.  If there be no  change in the song of a bird, it is as valueless as a whistling wind.   If there be no change in trees and grass, they are utterly  unsuitable to be planted in a garden.  Now, then, what is the use of  our life, if it stand still?  As the water of a running stream is  always fresh and wholesome because it does not stop for a moment, so  life is ever fresh and new because it does not stand still, but  rapidly moves on from parents to children, from children to  grandchildren, from grandchildren to great-grandchildren, and flows  on through generation after generation, renewing itself ceaselessly.    We can never deny the existence of old age and death--nay, death is  of capital importance for a continuation of life, because death  carries away all the decaying organism in the way of life.  But for  it life would be choked up with organic rubbish.  The only way of  life's pushing itself onward or its renewing itself is its producing  of the young and getting rid of the old.  If there be no old age nor  death, life is not life, but death.        9. Life and Change.    Transformation and change are the essential features of life; life is  not transformation nor change itself, as Bergson seems to assume.  It  is something which comes under our observation through transformation  and change.  There are, among Buddhists as well as Christians, not a  few who covet constancy and fixity of life, being allured by such  smooth names as eternal life, everlasting joy, permanent peace, and  what not.  They have forgotten that their souls can never rest  content with things monotonous.  If there be everlasting joy for  their souls, it must be presented to them through incessant change.  So also if there be eternal life granted for their souls, it must be  given through ceaseless alteration.  What is the difference between  eternal life, fixed and constant, and eternal death?  What is the  difference between everlasting bliss, changeless and monotonous, and  everlasting suffering?  If constancy, instead of change, govern life,  then hope or pleasure is absolutely impossible.  Fortunately,  however, life is not constant.  It changes and becomes.  Pleasure  arises through change itself.  Mere change of food or clothes is  often pleasing to us, while the appearance of the same thing twice or  thrice, however pleasing it may be, causes us little pleasure.  It  will become disgusting and tire us down, if it be presented  repeatedly from time to time.    An important element in the pleasure we derive from social meetings,  from travels, from sight-seeings, etc., is nothing but change.  Even  intellectual pleasure consists mainly of change.  A dead, unchanging  abstract truth, 2 and 2 make 4, excites no interest; while a  changeable, concrete truth, such as the Darwinian theory of  evolution, excites"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/518"],[0,"The Enchanted Island of Yew (#20)"],[1,"man in  the Enchanted Island.    All this had happened in a single night.  The morning after his  master's murder the page announced himself lord of the castle; and,  seeing his enormous size, none dared deny his right to rule.  On  account of his bushy hair, which was fiery red in color, and the bushy  red beard that covered his face when he became older, people came to  call him the Red One.  And after his evil deeds and quarrelsome temper  had made him infamous throughout the island, people began to call him  the Red Rogue of Dawna.    He had gathered around him a number of savage barbarians, as wicked and  quarrelsome as himself, and so none dared to interfere with him, or  even to meet him, if it were possible to avoid it.    This same Red Rogue it was who had drawn the good Baron Merd into a  quarrel and afterward slain the old knight and his followers, destroyed  his castle, and carried his little daughter Seseley and her girl  friends, Berna and Helda, into captivity, shutting them up in his own  gloomy castle.    The Red Rogue thought he had done a very clever thing, and had no fear  of the consequences until one of his men came running up to the castle  to announce that Prince Marvel and his companions were approaching to  rescue the Lady Seseley.    \"How many of them are there?\" demanded the Red Rogue.    \"There are eight, altogether,\" answered the man, \"but two of them are  girls.\"    \"And they expect to force me to give up my captives?\" asked the Red  One, laughing with a noise like the roar of a waterfall.  \"Why, I shall  make prisoners of every one of them!\"    The man looked at his master fearfully, and replied:    \"This Prince Marvel is very famous, and all people speak of his bravery  and power.  It was he who conquered King Terribus of Spor, and that  mighty ruler is now his friend, and is one of the eight who approach.\"    The Red Rogue stopped laughing, for the fame of Spor's terrible king  had long ago reached him.  And he reflected that any one who could  conquer the army of giants and dwarfs and Gray Men that served Terribus  must surely be one to be regarded seriously.  Moreover--and this was a  secret--the Red Rogue had never been able to gain the strength to  correspond with his gigantic size, but had ever remained as weak as  when he was a puny boy.  So he was accustomed to rely on his cunning  and on the terror his very presence usually excited to triumph over his  enemies.  And he began to be afraid of this prince.    \"You say two of the party are girls?\" he asked.    \"Yes,\" said the man, \"but also among them are King Terribus himself,  and the renowned Wul-Takim, formerly king of thieves, who was conquered  by the prince, although accounted a hard fighter, and is now his  devoted servant.  And there are two old men who are just alike and have  a very fierce look about them.  They are said to come from the hidden  Kingdom of Twi.\"    By this time the Red Rogue was thoroughly frightened, but he did not  yet despair of defeating his enemies.  He knew better than to attempt  to oppose Prince Marvel by force, but he still hoped to conquer him by  trickery and deceit.    Among the wonderful things that the Red Rogue's former master, the wise  scholar and magician, had made were two large enchanted mirrors, which  were set on each side of the great hallway of the castle.  Heavy  curtains were drawn over the surfaces of these mirrors, because they  both possessed a dreadful magical power.  For whenever any one looked  into one of them his reflection was instantly caught and imprisoned in  the mirror, and his body at the same time became invisible to all  earthly eyes, only the mirror retaining his form.    While considering a way to prevent the prince from freeing the Lady  Seseley, the Red Rogue happened to think of these mirrors, which had  never yet been used.  So he went stealthily into the great hall and  drew aside the covering from one of the mirrors.  He did not dare look  into the mirror himself, but hurried away to another room, and then  sent a page up a back stairway to summon the Lady Seseley and her two  maids into his presence.    The girls at once obeyed, for they greatly feared the Red Rogue; and of  course they descended the front stairway and walked through the great  hall.  At once the large mirror that had been exposed to view caught  the eye of Seseley, and she paused to regard her reflection in the  glass.  Her two companions did likewise, and instantly all three girls  became invisible, while the mirror held their reflections fast in its  magic surface.    The Red Rogue was watching them through a crack in the door, and seeing  the girls disappear he gave a joyful laugh and exclaimed:    \"Now let Prince Marvel find them if he can!\"    The three girls began to wander aimlessly through the castle; for not  only were they invisible to others, but also to themselves and to one  another, and they knew not what to do nor which way to turn.        24.  The Enchanted Mirrors    Presently Prince Marvel and his party arrived and paused before the  doors of the castle, where the Red Rogue stood bowing to them with mock  politeness and with an evil grin showing on his red face.    \"I come to demand the release of the Lady Seseley and her companions!\"  Prince Marvel announced, in a bold voice.  \"And I also intend to call  you to account for the murder of Baron Merd.\"    \"You must be at the wrong castle,\" answered the Red One, \"for I have  murdered no baron, nor have I any Lady Seseley as prisoner.\"    \"Are you not the Red Rogue of Dawna?\" demanded the prince.    \"Men call me by that name,\" acknowledged the other.    \"Then you are deceiving me,\" said the prince.    \"No, indeed!\" answered the Red Rogue, mockingly.  \"I wouldn't deceive  any one for the world.  But, if you don't believe me, you are welcome  to search my castle.\"    \"That I shall do,\" returned the prince, sternly, \"whether I have your  permission or not,\" and he began to dismount.  But Nerle restrained  him, saying:    \"Master, I beg you will allow me to search the castle.  For this Red  Rogue is playing some trick upon us, I am sure, and if anything  happened to you there would be no one to protect the little High Ki and  our other friends.\"    \"But suppose something should happen to you?\" inquired the prince,  anxiously.    \"In that case,\" said Nerle, \"you can avenge me.\"    The advice was so reasonable, under the circumstances, that the prince  decided to act upon it.    \"Very well,\" said he, \"go and search the castle, and I will remain with  our friends.  But if anything happens to you, I shall call the Red  Rogue to account.\"    So Nerle entered the castle, passing by the huge form of its owner, who  only nodded to the boy and grinned with delight.    The esquire found himself in the great hall and began to look around  him, but without seeing any one.  Then he advanced a few steps and, to  his surprise, discovered a large mirror, in which were reflected the  faces and forms of three girls, as well as his own.    \"Why, here they are!\" he attempted to say; but he could not hear his  own voice.  He glanced down at himself but could see nothing at  all--for his body had become invisible.  His reflection was still in  the glass, and he knew that his body existed the same as before; but  although he yet saw plainly the hall and all that it contained, he  could see neither himself nor any other person of flesh.    After waiting a considerable time for his esquire to reappear Prince  Marvel became impatient.    \"What have you done with Nerle?\" he asked of the Red Rogue.    \"Nothing,\" was the reply.  \"I have been here, plainly within your  sight, every moment.\"    \"Let me go and find him!\" exclaimed King Terribus, and rushed into the  castle before the prince could reply.  But Terribus also encountered  the enchanted mirror, and the prince waited in vain for his return.    Then Wul-Takim volunteered to go in search of the others, and drew his  big, sharp sword before entering the hall.  But an hour passed by and  he did not return.    The Red Rogue was overjoyed at the success of his stratagem, and could  scarce refrain from laughing outright at the prince's anxiety.    Marvel was really perplexed.  He knew some treachery was afoot, but  could not imagine what it was.  And when the pretty High Ki declared  their intention of entering the castle, he used every endeavor to  dissuade them.  But the twin girls would not be denied, so great was  their curiosity.  So the prince said:    \"Well, we will all go together, so that the Ki and I may be able to  protect you.\"    The Red Rogue gladly granted them admittance, and they passed him and  entered the great hall.    The place appeared to them to be completely empty, so they walked along  and came opposite the mirror.  Here all stopped at once, and the twin  High Ki uttered exclamations of surprise, and the twin Ki shouted,  \"Great Kika-koo!\"    For there in the glass were the reflections of the three girls and  Nerle and King Terribus and Wul-Takim.  And there were also the  reflections of the twin High Ki and the twin Ki. Only Prince Marvel's  reflection was missing, and this was because of his fairy origin.  For  the glass could reflect and hold only the forms of mortals.    But the prince saw the reflections of all the others, and then made the  discovery that the forms of the Ki and the High Ki had become  invisible.  No one except himself appeared to be standing in the great  hall of the Red Rogue's castle!  Yet grouped within the glass were the  likenesses of all his friends, as well as those of Lady Seseley and her  companions; and all were staring back at him earnestly, as if imploring  him to save them.    The mystery was now explained, and Prince Marvel rushed from the hall  to find the treacherous Red Rogue.  But that clever trickster had  hidden himself in an upper room, and for the present was safely  concealed.    For a time Prince Marvel could not"]]]
