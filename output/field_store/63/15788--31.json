The persons thus educated supplied for them the place of annals, books of  laws, or written precedents.    Both Taylor and Dieffenbach incline to the opinion of older authors  respecting these twin islands, namely, that at the period when these  immigrants from the north arrived there, they were inhabited by another  dark race of a different descent. Against this hypothesis, however, there  is to be urged that not the slightest vestige of any such race can be  produced, in addition to which there is but one language spoken throughout  the extent of the islands, with dialects few in number and hardly  differing from each other. In none of the many Maori legends is any  mention made, either express or implied, of any such circumstance, which  one would think would hardly have been passed over in silence, had the  islands at the first landing of the emigrants from Hawaiki been inhabited  by another race. The great disparity in physical frame between  individuals, recalling now the Malay, now the Chinese type, and even the  African and Jewish as well, is much more probably explained by the  intermixture of the New Zealanders with the inhabitants of the various  island groups, which they visited at the period of their migration.    The Maories are on the whole a handsome race of men, well-built and  powerful, generally not less in stature than the Europeans, whom they  resemble somewhat in their complexion, which gives the idea rather of  being embrowned than naturally brown, by their thin, weak hair, sometimes  black, sometimes of a chesnut brown, and whom they closely approach in  their features. Indeed full-blood Maories sometimes have such a European  aspect, that even the numberless tattoo marks upon their faces do not  destroy the impression, but have rather the appearance of those \"painted  faces\" we are accustomed to see in actors, when they wish to give their  countenances a more effective cast upon the boards.    The custom of tattooing, or \"Moko,\" is one of those most characteristic of  this remarkable people, and is worth being described in detail, inasmuch  as it has been almost entirely discontinued since the diffusion of  Christianity, for, according to the sentiments of the missionaries, every  native, henceforth, who submits to this operation is held to have  renounced Christianity, and to have openly dubbed himself a heathen. It  has been suggested as the most probable explanation of the rapid spread of  this painful practice, that the \"Moko\" imparts to the countenance a  sterner expression in presence of the enemy, and that the Maori women  attach more importance to the caresses of a tattooed man than of one whose  visage is unmarked. Possibly tattooing was a symbol of puberty in both  sexes, and a token of their being of marriageable age.    At first they contented themselves with marking the face with certain  straight lines, called by the natives Moko-Kuri, which was the stage it  had attained when Cook visited these islands. The present complicated  system of tattooing was first introduced by one of the tribes of the east  coast by a certain Mataora, and the first man whose face was thus tattooed  was named Onetunga.    Usually this painful operation is performed by a priest (_Tohunga_), who  paints, or rather sketches out, one of the many different models with  black colouring matter upon the face of the person to be tattooed, having  first obtained his opinion, by showing him his visage reflected in a  tub-full of water for lack of a mirror. As soon as the latter has  signified his assent to the design selected, the further process is begun.    The instruments used were the following:--    The \"Uhi,\" a small piece of wood, one extremity of which is armed with a  small piece of sharp-edged bone, set in a vertical direction. This  needle-like tool, which was formerly made either of human bones or of  those of the albatross, has been since supplanted by proper steel  instruments.    The \"Ta\" or \"Tuki,\" a stalk of fern, which is pressed upon the Uhi in  order that it might enter the skin, and bring out the desired pattern.    The necessary colouring stuff (_Ngarahu_) is made from the soot of the  wood, when burnt, of the Kauri fir (_Dammara Australis_), which is  collected in the leaves of the Ti-reed (_Cordyline Australis_), and is  prepared with an infusion of the bark of the Hinau (_Elaeocarpus Hinau_),  in the form of small cones.    Immediately before the tattooing begins, the colouring matter thus  prepared is moistened with the juice of the fruit of Tupa-kihi (_Coriaria  Sarmentosa_). The complete \"Moko\" comprises the face, the hips, and the  upper surface of the thigh as far as the knee. Every separate tattooing  has its appropriate name and its special position. Dieffenbach counts 17,  and Richmond Taylor 19 of these, distinguishable by their several  markings.    The operation is of so severe a nature, that very frequently it cannot be  completed without endangering the life of the individual. Only one  instance is on record, in which a native sat out the whole formidable  process at one sitting, and he died just as the last line was finished.  Usually the first tattooing took place at the 18th year, and was continued  at various intervals. During the process, the patient lies on the ground  with his head reposing on the bosom of the _Tohunga_, who holds the \"Uhi\"  in his left hand, and the \"Ta\" or \"Tuki\" in his right, which he strikes  upon the former with a rapid constant motion. As soon as an incision is  made, the blood is wiped off with a piece of fine flax, and the colouring  matter rubbed in. While this is going on the priests and the friends  standing by keep up a continual chant, in order to cheer the patient and  stimulate his courage.    After the operation the face swells, and for some time presents a  downright hideous appearance, and instances have occurred in which it has  been permanently distorted. Usually, however, the wounds heal after ten or  twelve days, when the incised lines made by the \"Uhi\" present a  bluish-black appearance.    With the women the operation is much more simple, being confined to one  or two vertical or horizontal lines upon the lip and chin. This tattooing  occasionally, however, takes place twice, in order to bring out a black  colour, as the New Zealanders consider a black lip as the very ideal of  beauty. It also figures as such in the songs chanted by the Tohunga on  such occasions, of which the following stanzas may be presented as a  specimen:--        Be ready, my daughter, to have thyself marked,      To tattoo thy chin!      That, when thou crossest the threshold of a strange house,      They may not say, \"Whence cometh this ugly woman?\"        Be ready, my daughter, to have thyself marked,      To tattoo thy chin!      That thou mayst have a comely aspect,      That when thou art bidden to a feast,      They may not ask, \"Whence cometh this _red-lipped_ woman?\"        To make thyself beautiful      Come and be tattooed!      That when thou dost enter the circle of dancers,      They may not ask, \"Whence cometh this woman with the ugly lips?\"    The Tohunga is usually well remunerated, and frequently in the course of  his chant makes allusion to the amount of reward he expects, and indeed  sometimes stimulates the generosity of his patient by singing amongst  other ditties, something like        \"The man who is paid well      Tattoos beautifully!      The man who receives nothing      Does not tattoo well!\"    The marks, when completely brought out, are so manifold and various that  hardly any two New Zealanders are to be found who are tattooed entirely  alike. Accordingly these markings serve neither to indicate variety of  tribe, nor difference of rank. A slave, if he possess the means, may have  his face tattooed with the same ornaments as his master. However it  appears, as we were informed by Colonel Browne, that on the occasion of  the chiefs ratifying the treaty with the English, they superscribed the  various documents with the lines upon their faces, like so much heraldic  blazonry, instead of writing their names.    Another remarkable custom of the Maori consists in the right of the priest  to declare certain persons and things _taboo_, that is, consecrated and  inviolable. This custom, which is nothing else than a religious ordinance  instituted for political purposes, is frequently most beneficial in its  consequences. So great and universal was the respect paid to the law of  _taboo_, that even hostile tribes were in the habit during war of leaving  unharmed all persons and things thus protected. A plot of ground planted  with esculents, a fruit tree, a sick person, a \"lady in the straw,\"--all  these were so many objects declared holy and inviolate.    Formerly polygamy was tolerably frequent among the Maori, although  instances were by no means rare in which a man had but one wife to whom he  continued faithful. At present this custom, incompatible with the  Christian notion of the family tie, is confined to those few chiefs who  are still heathens.    Usually the young men and girls marry very young. English travellers state  they have seen a mother only 11 years of age! Usually the first wife of a  young chief is much older than himself, but, on the other hand, instances  were frequent of old men marrying young girls. The daughters of men of  very high rank frequently remained unmarried.    The mortality among infants under a year old is very great. At present not  more than three children are reckoned to each family, and the number of  barren marriages is much greater than those that prove fruitful.    Infanticide is at present as rare as in Europe. In former times,  especially during the wars of the interior, it was by no means unusual for  a mother to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38480"],[0,"Scientific American, Vol. XXXIX.—No. 24.

(52) S. W. C. asks: Has carbon for telephone purposes ever been made  by subjecting the black deposited by a flame to a heavy pressure? A.  Yes. Edison's carbons are made in this manner.    (53) \"Hardware\" asks: 1. Where is best to take hot air in a room, at  register near ceiling or in floor? A. At or near the floor. 2. Where  is best place to have ventilation, near floor or near ceiling? A.  If connected with a flue having a good draught it should be near the  floor.    (54) R. W. J. asks: What causes the cracking noise in the pipes of a  steam heating apparatus, when a fire has been started to warm up the  building? Is it the water in the pipes made by condensed steam, or is  it the expansion of the pipes from being heated? A. The noise is due  to both causes in some degree, but principally to the water, which  produces violent blows.    (55) C. N. A. asks how to temper steel tools for working on stone or  similar work. There is some preparation which is put in water which  accomplishes the purpose when the steel is heated and plunged in. A.  Heat the tools to a cherry red, and plunge in clean, moderately cool  water. A little common salt is sometimes added to the water.    (56) G. B. asks: 1. Is the height to which water is raised by a  hydraulic ram measured from the ram itself or from the spring from  which the supply comes? A. From the ram. 2. Can a hydraulic ram be  constructed to discharge 1,000 gallons of water per minute? A. Yes.    (57) L. D. writes that benzine will answer much better to exterminate  roaches, moths, etc., than anything else. It will not hurt furniture  in the least, will evaporate, and can be easily applied.          MINERALS, ETC.--Specimens have been received from the following  correspondents, and examined, with the results stated:      M. B. W.--No. 1 is a silicious clay--it might be useful in the  manufacture of some grades of pottery, etc. No. 2 is a ferruginous  shale--contains about 80 per cent. of silica and 10 per cent. of  alumina, besides lime, magnesia, iron oxide, and water.--W. S.--It is  fibrous talc--talc of good quality is in considerable demand for paper  making and other purposes.--W. G. H.--The sand contains no precious  metal--the glittering particles are mica.--S. F.--The specimen you  send consists of a mass of the long hairs which have been attached  to the seeds of the \"milkweed\" (_asclepias_), or, as it is sometimes  called, from the silky nature of these appendages, \"silkweed.\" We  believe that this material is put to no other economic use at present  than that of a filling for cushions and pillows. The beauty of this  silk like down long ago attracted attention, and many unsuccessful  attempts have been made to put it to some practical use in the arts;  but, as you have probably noticed, the hairs are both brittle and  weak, and an examination with a lens will show that it wants the  roughness and angularity necessary to fit it for being spun like other  fibers. It has, however, been mixed with cotton and woven into fabrics  having a silky luster and capable of taking brilliant dyes, but the  manufacture has never been prosecuted. The plants, though widely  distributed over the United States, and quite common, are nevertheless  not abundant enough in a wild state to afford much of a supply, and we  believe no experiments have been made in cultivating them.           *       *       *       *       *    Any numbers of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT referred to in these  columns may be had at this office.
