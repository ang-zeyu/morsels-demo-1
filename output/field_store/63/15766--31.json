Marco studied the Chinese language, and it was not  very long before he could speak it.    When he was about twenty-one Kublai Khan sent him on very important  business to a distant part of China. He did the work well and from  that time was often employed as an envoy of the Chinese monarch. His  travels were sometimes in lands never before visited by Europeans  and he had many strange adventures among the almost unknown tribes  of Asia. Step by step he was promoted. For several years he was  governor of a great Chinese city.    Finally he and his father and uncle desired to return to Venice.  They had all served Kublai Khan faithfully and he had appreciated  it and given them rich rewards; but he did not wish to let them  go.    While the matter was being talked over an embassy arrived in Peking  from the king of Persia. This monarch desired to marry the daughter  of Kublai Khan, the Princess Cocachin, and he had sent to ask her  father for her hand. Consent was given, and Kublai Khan fitted out  a fleet of fourteen ships to carry the wedding party to Persia.    The Princess Cocachin was a great friend of Marco Polo, and urged  her father to allow him to go with the party. Finally Kublai Khan  gave his consent. Marco's father and uncle were also allowed to  go, and the three Venetians left China.    [Illustration: VENETIAN SHIPS]    The fleet with the wedding party on board sailed southward on the  China Sea. It was a long and perilous voyage. Stops were made at  Borneo, Sumatra, Ceylon and other places, until the ships entered the  Persian Gulf and the princess was safely landed. After they reached  the capital of Persia the party, including the three Venetians, was  entertained by the Persians for weeks in a magnificent manner and  costly presents were given to all.    At last the Venetians left their friends, went to the Black Sea  and took ship for Venice.    They had been away so long and were so much changed in appearance  that none of their relations and old friends knew them when they  arrived in Venice. As they were dressed in Tatar costume and sometimes  spoke the Chinese language to one another, they found it hard to  convince people that they were members of the Polo family.    At length, on order to show that they were the men that they declared  themselves to be, they gave a dinner to all their relations and old  friends. When the guests arrived they were greeted by the travelers,  arrayed in gorgeous Chinese robes of crimson satin. After the first  course they appeared in crimson damask; after the second, they  changed their costumes to crimson velvet; while at the end of the  dinner they appeared in the usual garb of wealthy Venetians.    \"Now, my friends,\" said Marco, \"I will show you something that  will please you.\" He then brought into the room the rough Tatar  coats which he and his father and uncle had worn when they reached  Venice. Cutting open the seams, he took from inside the lining  packets filled with rubies, emeralds and diamonds. It was the finest  collection of jewels ever seen in Venice.    The guests were now persuaded that their hosts were indeed what  they claimed to be.    II    Eight hundred years before Marco Polo's birth, some of the people  of North Italy had fled before the Attila to the muddy islands of  the Adriatic and founded Venice upon them. Since then the little  settlement had become the most wealthy and powerful city of Europe.  Venice was the queen of the Adriatic and her merchants were princes.  They had vessels to bring the costly wares of the East to their  wharves; they had warships to protect their rich cargoes from the  pirates of the Mediterranean; they carried on wars. At the time  when Marco Polo returned from Cathay they were at war with Gen'o-a.    The two cities were fighting for the trade of the world. In a great  naval battle the Venetians were completely defeated. Marco Polo  was in the battle and with many of his countrymen was captured  by the enemy. For a year he was confined in a Genoese prison. One  of his fellow-prisoners was a skillful penman and Marco dictated  to him an account of his experiences in China, Japan, and other  Eastern countries. This account was carefully written out. Copies  of the manuscript exist to this day. One of these is in a library  in Paris. It was carried into France in the year 1307. Another  copy is preserved in the city of Berne. It is said that the book  was translated into many languages, so that people in all parts  of Europe learned about Marco's adventures.    About a hundred and seventy-five years after the book was written,  the famous Genoese, Christopher Columbus, planned his voyage across  the Atlantic. It is believed that he had read Marco's description  of Java, Sumatra and other East India Islands, which he thought he  had reached when he discovered Hai'ti and Cuba. So Marco Polo may  have suggested to Columbus the voyage which led to the discovery  of America.          EDWARD THE BLACK PRINCE    LIVED FROM 1330-1376    I    One of the most famous warriors of the Middle Ages was Edward the  Black Prince. He was so called because he wore black armor in battle.    The Black Prince was the son of Edward III who reigned over England  from 1327 to 1377. He won his fame as a soldier in the wars which  his father carried on against France.    You remember that the early kings of England, from the time of  William the Conqueror, had possessions in France. Henry II, William's  grandson, was the duke of Normandy and lord of Brittany and other  provinces, and when he married Eleanor of Aquitaine she brought  him that province also.    Henry's son John lost all the French possessions of the English  crown except a part of Aquitaine, and Edward III inherited this.  So when Philip of Valois (_val-wah'_) became king of France, about  a year after Edward had become king of England, Edward had to do  homage to Philip.    To be king of England and yet to do homage to the king of France--to  bend the knee before Philip and kiss his foot--was something Edward  did not like. He thought it was quite beneath his dignity, as his  ancestor Rollo had thought when told that he must kiss the foot  of King Charles.    So Edward tried to persuade the nobles of France that he himself  ought by right to be the king of France instead of being only a  vassal. Philip of Valois was only a cousin of the late French King  Charles IV. Edward was the son of his sister. But there was a curious  old law in France, called the Salic Law, which forbade that daughters  should inherit lands. This law barred the claim of Edward, because  his claim came through his mother. Still he determined to win the  French throne by force of arms.    A chance came to quarrel with Philip. Another of Philip's vassals  rebelled against him, and Edward helped the rebel. He hoped by  doing so to weaken Philip and more easily overpower him.    Philip at once declared that Edward's possessions in France were  forfeited.    Then Edward raised an army of thirty thousand men, and with it invaded  France.    The Black Prince was now only about sixteen years of age, but he  had already shown himself brave in battle, and his father put him  in command of one of the divisions of the army.    Thousands of French troops led by King Philip were hurried from  Paris to meet the advance of the English; and on the 26th of August,  1346, the two armies fought a hard battle at the village of Crecy.    During the battle the division of the English army commanded by  the Black Prince had to bear the attack of the whole French force.  The prince fought so bravely and managed his men so well that King  Edward, who was overlooking the field of battle from a windmill  on the top of a hill, sent him words of praise for his gallant  work.    Again and again the prince's men drove back the French in splendid  style. But at last they seemed about to give way before a very  fierce charge, and the earl of Warwick hastened to Edward to advise  him to send the prince aid.    \"Is my son dead or unhorsed or so wounded that he cannot help himself?\"  asked the king.    \"No, Sire,\" was the reply; \"but he is hard pressed.\"    \"Return to your post, and come not to me again for aid so long as  my son lives,\" said the king. \"Let the boy prove himself a true  knight and win his spurs.\"    [Illustration: THE BLACK PRINCE AT THE DEAD BODY OF THE KING OF  BOHEMIA]    The earl went to the prince and told him what his father had said.  \"I will prove myself a true knight,\" exclaimed the prince. \"My  father is right. I need no aid. My men will hold their post as long  as they have strength to stand.\"    Then he rode where the battle was still furiously raging, and encouraged  his men. The king of France led his force a number of times against  the prince's line, but could not break it and was at last compelled  to retire.    The battle now went steadily against the French, although they  far outnumbered the English. Finally, forty thousand of Philip's  soldiers lay dead upon the field and nearly all the remainder of  his army was captured. Philip gave up the struggle and fled.    Among those who fought on the side of the French at Crecy was the  blind king of Bohemia, who always wore three white feathers in  his helmet. When the battle was at its height the blind king had  his followers lead him into the thick of the fight, and he dealt  heavy blows upon his unseen foes until he fell mortally wounded.  The three white feathers were taken from his helmet by the Black  Prince, who ever after wore them himself.    As soon as he could King Edward rode over the field to meet his  son. \"Prince,\" he said, as he greeted him, \"you are the conqueror  of the French.\" Turning to the soldiers, who had gathered around  him, the king shouted, \"Cheer, cheer for the Black Prince! Cheer  for the hero of Crecy!\"    What"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3726"],[0,"The Decameron, Volume I (#20)"],[1,"invitation, and was so much comforted  by its warmth that he seemed to have passed from death to life. The lady  provided him with a suit of clothes, which had been worn by her husband  shortly before his death, and which, when he had them on, looked as if they  had been made for him. So he recovered heart, and, while he awaited the  lady's commands, gave thanks to God and St. Julian for delivering him from a  woful night and conducting him, as it seemed, to comfortable quarters.    The lady meanwhile took a little rest, after which she had a roaring fire  put in one of her large rooms, whither presently she came, and asked her  maid how the good man did. The maid replied:--\"Madam, he has put on the  clothes, in which he shews to advantage, having a handsome person, and  seeming to be a worthy man, and well-bred.\" \"Go, call him then,\" said the  lady, \"tell him to come hither to the fire, and we will sup; for I know that  he has not supped.\" Rinaldo, on entering the room and seeing the lady, took  her to be of no small consequence. He therefore made her a low bow, and did  his utmost to thank her worthily for the service she had rendered him. His  words pleased her no less than his person, which accorded with what the maid  had said: so she made him heartily welcome, installed him at his ease by her  side before the fire, and questioned him of the adventure which had brought  him thither. Rinaldo detailed all the circumstances, of which the lady had  heard somewhat when Rinaldo's servant made his appearance at the castle. She  therefore gave entire credence to what he said, and told him what she knew  about his servant, and how he might easily find him on the morrow. She then  bade set the table, which done, Rinaldo and she washed their hands and sate  down together to sup. Tall he was and comely of form and feature, debonair  and gracious of mien and manner, and in his lusty prime. The lady had eyed  him again and again to her no small satisfaction, and, her wantonness being  already kindled for the Marquis, who was to have come to lie with her, she  had let Rinaldo take the vacant place in her mind. So when supper was done,  and they were risen from the table, she conferred with her maid, whether,  after the cruel trick played upon her by the Marquis, it were not well to  take the good gift which Fortune had sent her. The maid knowing the bent of  her mistress's desire, left no word unsaid that might encourage her to  follow it. Wherefore the lady, turning towards Rinaldo, who was standing  where she had left him by the fire, began thus:--\"So! Rinaldo, why still so  pensive? Will nothing console you for the loss of a horse and a few clothes?  Take heart, put a blithe face on it, you are at home; nay more, let me tell  you that, seeing you in those clothes which my late husband used to wear,  and taking you for him, I have felt, not once or twice, but perhaps a  hundred times this evening, a longing to throw my arms round you and kiss  you; and, in faith, I had so done, but that I feared it might displease  you.\" Rinaldo, hearing these words, and marking the flame which shot from  the lady's eyes, and being no laggard, came forward with open arms, and  confronted her and said:--\"Madam, I am not unmindful that I must ever  acknowledge that to you I owe my life, in regard of the peril whence you  rescued me. If then there be any way in which I may pleasure you, churlish  indeed were I not to devise it. So you may even embrace and kiss me to your  heart's content, and I will embrace and kiss you with the best of good  wills.\" There needed no further parley. The lady, all aflame with amorous  desire, forthwith threw herself into his arms, and straining him to her  bosom with a thousand passionate embraces, gave and received a thousand  kisses before they sought her chamber. There with all speed they went to  bed, nor did day surprise them until again and again and in full measure  they had satisfied their desire. With the first streaks of dawn they rose,  for the lady was minded that none should surmise aught of the affair. So,  having meanly habited Rinaldo, and replenished his purse, she enjoined him  to keep the secret, shewed him the way to the castle, where he was to find  his servant, and let him out by the same postern by which he had entered.  When it was broad day the gates were opened, and Rinaldo, passing himself  off as a traveller from distant parts, entered the castle, and found his  servant. Having put on the spare suit which was in his valise, he was about  to mount the servant's horse, when, as if by miracle, there were brought  into the castle the three gentlemen of the road who had robbed him the  evening before, having been taken a little while after for another offence.  Upon their confession Rinaldo's horse was restored to him, as were also his  clothes and money; so that he lost nothing except a pair of garters, of  which the robbers knew not where they had bestowed them. Wherefore Rinaldo,  giving thanks to God and St. Julian, mounted his horse, and returned home  safe and sound, and on the morrow the three robbers kicked heels in the  wind.      NOVEL III.    --  Three young men squander their substance and are reduced to poverty. Their  nephew, returning home a desperate man, falls in with an abbot, in whom he  discovers the daughter of the King of England. She marries him, and he  retrieves the losses and reestablishes the fortune of his uncles.  --    The ladies marvelled to hear the adventures of Rinaldo d'Asti, praised his  devotion, and gave thanks to God and St. Julian for the succour lent him in  his extreme need. Nor, though the verdict was hardly outspoken, was the lady  deemed unwise to take the boon which God had sent her. So they tittered and  talked of her night of delight, while Pampinea, being seated by Filostrato,  and surmising that her turn would, as it did, come next, was lost in  meditation on what she was to say. Roused from her reverie by the word of  the queen, she put on a cheerful courage, and thus began:--    Noble ladies, discourse as we may of Fortune's handiwork, much still remains  to be said if we but scan events aright, nor need we marvel thereat, if we  but duly consider that all matters, which we foolishly call our own, are in  her hands and therefore subject, at her inscrutable will, to every variety  of chance and change without any order therein by us discernible. Which is  indeed signally manifest everywhere and all day long; yet, as 'tis our  queen's will that we speak thereof, perhaps 'twill not be unprofitable to  you, if, notwithstanding it has been the theme of some of the foregoing  stories, I add to them another, which, I believe, should give you pleasure.    There was formerly in our city a knight, by name Messer Tedaldo, of the  Lamberti, according to some, or, as others say, of the Agolanti family,  perhaps for no better reason than that the occupation of his sons was  similar to that which always was and is the occupation of the Agolanti.  However, without professing to determine which of the two houses he belonged  to, I say, that he was in his day a very wealthy knight, and had three sons,  the eldest being by name Lamberto, the second Tedaldo, and the third  Agolante. Fine, spirited young men were they all, though the eldest was not  yet eighteen years old when their father, Messer Tedaldo, died very rich,  leaving to them as his lawful heirs the whole of his property both movable  and immovable. Finding themselves thus possessed of great wealth, both in  money and in lands and chattels, they fell to spending without stint or  restraint, indulging their every desire, maintaining a great establishment,  and a large and well-filled stable, besides dogs and hawks, keeping ever  open house, scattering largesses, jousting, and, not content with these and  the like pastimes proper to their condition, indulging every appetite  natural to their youth. They had not long followed this course of life  before the cash left them by their father was exhausted; and, their rents  not sufficing to defray their expenditure, they began to sell and pledge  their property, and disposing of it by degrees, one item to-day and another  to-morrow, they hardly perceived that they were approaching the verge of  ruin, until poverty opened the eyes which wealth had fast sealed. So one day  Lamberto called his brothers to him, reminded them of the position of wealth  and dignity which had been theirs and their father's before them, and shewed  them the poverty to which their extravagance had reduced them, and adjured  them most earnestly that, before their destitution was yet further manifest,  they should all three sell what little remained to them and depart thence;  which accordingly they did. Without leave-taking, or any ceremony, they  quitted Florence; nor did they rest until they had arrived in England and  established themselves in a small house in London, where, by living with  extreme parsimony and lending at exorbitant usances, they prospered so well  that in the course of a few years they amassed a fortune; and so, one by  one, they returned to Florence, purchased not a few of their former estates  besides many others, and married. The management of their affairs in  England, where they continued their business of usurers, they left to a  young nephew, Alessandro by name, while, heedless alike of the teaching of  experience and of marital and parental duty, they all three launched out at  Florence into more extravagant expenditure than before, and contracted debts  on all hands and to large amounts. This expenditure they were enabled for  some years to support by the remittances made by Alessandro, who, to his  great profit, had lent money to the barons on the security of their castles  and rents.    While the three brothers thus continued to spend freely, and, when short of  money, to borrow it, never doubting of help from England, it so happened  that,"]]]
