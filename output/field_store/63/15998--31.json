[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7947"],[0,"The Diary of a U-boat Commander (#20)"],[1,". The coast appeared to bear no  resemblance to the chart whatsoever.    The cliffs stand up to a height of several hundred metres, with  occasional clefts where a stream runs down. There are no trees, houses,  animals, or any signs of life, except sea birds, of which there are  myriads. The Engineer declares he saw a reindeer, but five other people  on deck failed to see any signs of the beast.    After hours of nosing about, during which my heart was in my mouth, as  I quite expected to fetch up on a pinnacle rock, items which are  officially described in the Handbook as being \"very numerous,\" we  rounded a bluff and got into a place which seems to answer the  description of S. Landholm. At any rate, it is a snug anchorage, and  here I intend to remain for a few days, and hope for my store-ship to  turn up.    I've posted a daylight look-out on top of the bluff; it would be very  awkward to be caught unawares in this place, which is only about 150  metres wide in places.    I'm taking advantage of the rest to give the crew some exercises and  execute various minor repairs to the Diesels.           *       *       *       *       *    Yesterday we fought what must be one of the most remarkable single-ship  actions of the war.    At 9 a.m. the look-out on the cliffs reported smoke to the northward.    I got the anchor up and made ready to push off, but still kept the  look-out ashore. At 9.30 he reported a destroyer in sight, which seemed  serious if she chose to look into my particular nook.    At any rate, I thought, I wouldn't be caught like a rat, so I got my  look-out on board--a matter of ten minutes--and then proceeded out,  trimmed down and ready for diving.    When I drew clear of the entrance I saw the enemy distant about a  thousand metres. I at once recognized her as being one of the oldest  type of Russian torpedo boats afloat. When I established this fact, a  devil entered into my mind, and did a most foolhardy act.    I decided that I would not retreat beneath the sea, but that I would  fight her as one service ship to another.    When I make up my mind, I do so in no uncertain manner--indecision is  abhorrent to me--and I sharply ordered, \"Gun's Crew--Action.\"    I can still see the comical look of wonderment which passed over my  First Lieutenant's face, but he knows me, and did not hesitate an  instant. We drilled like a battleship, and in sixty-five seconds--I  timed it as a matter of interest--from my order we fired the first  shot. It fell short.    Extraordinary to relate, the torpedo boat, without firing a gun, put  her helm hard over, and started to steam away at her full speed, which  I suppose was about seventeen knots.    I actually began to chase her--a submarine chasing a torpedo boat! It  was ludicrous.    With broad smiles on their faces, my good gun's crew rapidly fired the  gun, and we had the satisfaction of striking her once, near her after  funnel, but it did no vital damage, as a few minutes afterwards she  drew out of range! What a pack of incompetent cowards!    They never fired a shot at us. I suppose half of them were drunk or  else in a state of semi-mutiny, for one hears strange tales of affairs  in Russia these days.    The whole incident was quite humorous, but I realized that I had hardly  been wise, as without doubt the English will hear of this, and these  trawlers of theirs will turn up, and I'm certainly not going to try any  heroics with John Bull, who is as tough a fighter as we are.    Meanwhile, what of the supply ship, for I'm supposed to meet her here,  and it's already twenty-four hours since yesterday's epoch-making  battle and I expect the English any moment.           *       *       *       *       *    My doubts were removed for me since I received special orders at noon  by high-power wireless from Nordreich, and on decoding them found that,  for some reason or other, we are ordered to proceed to Muckle Flugga  Cape, and thence down the coast of Shetlands to the Fair Island  Channel, where we are directed to cruise till further orders. Special  warning is included as to encountering friendly submarines.    It appears to me that a special concentration of U-boats is being  ordered round about the Orkneys, and that some big scheme is on hand.    We are now steering south-westerly to make Muckle Flugga, which I hope  to do in four days' time if the weather holds.    These Northern waters have proved very barren of shipping in the last  few weeks, and this fact, coupled with the approaching winter weather,  which must be fiendish in these latitudes, makes me quite ready to  exchange the Archangel billet for the work round the Orkneys and  Shetlands, though this is damnable enough in the winter, in all  conscience.    There is only one fly in the ointment, and that is that this premature  return to North Sea waters might conceivably mean a visit to Zeebrugge,  though this class are not likely to be sent there.    Though it is many weeks since I left Zoe, I have not been able to  forget her. I continually wonder what she is doing, and often when I am  not on my guard she wanders into my thoughts.    Whilst I am up here, it does not matter much, except that it causes me  unhappiness, but if I found myself at Bruges it would be very hard.  However, I don't suppose I shall ever see her again.           *       *       *       *       *    Sighted Muckle Flugga this morning, and shaped course for Fair Island.           *       *       *       *       *    Oh! what a hell I have passed through. I can hardly realize that I am  alive, but I am, though whether I shall be to-morrow morning is  doubtful--it all depends on the weather, and who would willingly stake  their life on North Sea weather at this time of the year?    Curses on the man who sent us to the Fair Island Channel. Where the  devil is our Intelligence Service? If we make Flanders I have a story  to tell that will open their eyes, blind bats that they are,  luxuriating in the comfort of their fat staff jobs ashore.    The Fair Island Channel is an English death-trap; it stinks with death.  By cursed luck we arrived there just as the English were trying one of  their new devices, and it is the devil. Exactly what the system is, I  don't quite know, and I hope never again to have to investigate it.    For forty-seven, hours we have been hunted like a rat, and now, with  the pressure hull leaking in three places, and the boat half full of  chlorine, we are struggling back on the surface, practically incapable  of diving at least for more than ten minutes at a time. Even on the  surface, with all the fans working, one must wear a gas mask to  penetrate the fore compartment. Oh! these English, what devils they  are!    Here is what happened:    Fair Island was away on our port beam when we sighted a large English  trawler, which I suspected of being a patrol. To be on the safe side, I  dived and proceeded at twenty metres for about an hour.    At 5 p.m. (approximately) I came up to periscope depth to have a look  round, but quickly dived again as I discovered a trawler, steering on  the same course as myself, about a thousand metres astern of me. This  was the more disconcerting, as in the short time at my disposal it  seemed to me that she was remarkably similar to the craft I had seen in  the afternoon, and yet this hardly seemed likely, as I did not think  she could have sighted me then.    On diving, I altered course ninety degrees, and proceeded for half an  hour at full speed, then altered another ninety degrees, in the same  direction as the previous alteration, and diving to thirty metres I  proceeded at dead slow. By midnight I had been diving so much that I  decided to get a charge on the batteries before dawn; I also wanted to  be up at 1 a.m. to make my position report.    I surfaced after a good look round through the right periscope, which,  as usual, revealed nothing. I had hardly got on the bridge, when a  flash of flame stabbed the night on the starboard beam and a shell  moaned just overhead.    I crash-dived at once, but could not get under before the enemy fired a  second shot at us, which fortunately missed us. As we dived I ordered  the helm hard a starboard, to counteract the expected depth-charge  attack. We must have been a hundred and fifty metres from the first  charge and a little below it, five others followed in rapid succession,  but were further away, and we suffered no damage beyond a couple of  broken lights. The situation was now extremely unpleasant. I did not  dare venture to the surface, and thus missed my 1 a.m. signal from  Headquarters. I wanted a charge badly, and so proceeded at the lowest  possible speed. At regular intervals our enemy dropped one depth-charge  somewhere astern of us, but these reports always seemed the same  distance away.    At dawn I very cautiously came up to periscope depth, and had a look.  To my consternation I discovered our relentless pursuer about 1,500  metres away on the port quarter. In some extraordinary manner he had  tracked us during the night.    I dived and altered course through ninety degrees to south.    At 9 a.m. a tremendous explosion shook the boat from stem to stern,  smashing several lights, and giving her a big inclination up by the  bow.    As I was only at twenty metres I feared the boat would break surface,  and our enemy was evidently very nearly right over us. I at once  ordered hard to dive, and went down to the great depth of ninety-five  metres.    A series of shattering explosions somewhere above us showed that we  were marked down, and we were only saved from destruction by our great  depth, the English charges being set apparently to about thirty metres.    At noon the situation was critical in the extreme. My battery density  was down to 1,150, the few lamps that I had burning were glowing with a  faint, dull red appearance, which eloquently told of the falling  voltage and the dying struggles of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7959"],[0,"The Reign of Tiberius, Out of the First Six Annals of Tacitus; (#20)"],[1,"allies, who, esteeming  the rivers of their country sacred, had to them dedicated Priests, and  altars, and groves; nay, the Tiber himself, when bereft of his auxiliary  streams, would flow with diminished grandeur.\" Now, whether it were  that the prayers of the colonies, or the difficulty of the work, or the  influence of superstition prevailed, it is certain the opinion of Piso  was followed; namely, that nothing should be altered,    To Poppeus Sabinus was continued his province of Mesia; and to it was  added that of Achaia and Macedon. This too was part of the politics of  Tiberius, to prolong governments, and maintain the same men in the same  armies, or civil employments, for the most part, to the end of  their lives; with what view, is not agreed. Some think \"that from an  impatience of returning cares, he was for making whatever he once liked  perpetual.\" Others, \"that from the malignity of his invidious nature, he  regretted the preferring of many.\" There are some who believe, \"that  as he had a crafty penetrating spirit, so he had an understanding ever  irresolute and perplexed.\" So much is certain, that he never courted any  eminent virtue, yet hated vice; from the best men he dreaded danger  to himself, and disgrace to the public from the worst. This hesitation  mastered him so much at last that he committed foreign governments to  some, whom he meant never to suffer to leave Rome.    Concerning the management of consular elections, either then or  afterwards under Tiberius, I can affirm scarce anything: such is the  variance about it, not only amongst historians, but even in his own  speeches. Sometimes, not naming the candidates, he described them by  their family, by their life and manners, and by the number of their  campaigns; so as it might be apparent whom he meant. Again, avoiding  even to describe them, he exhorted the candidates not to disturb the  election by their intrigues, and promised himself to take care of  their interests. But chiefly he used to declare, \"that to him none had  signified their pretensions, but such whose names he had delivered to  the Consuls; others too were at liberty to offer the like pretensions,  if they trusted to the favour of the Senate or their own merits.\"  Specious words! but entirely empty, or full of fraud; and by how  much they were covered with the greater guise of liberty, by so much  threatening a more hasty and devouring bondage.          BOOK II    A.D. 16-19.      The commotions in the East happened not ungratefully to Tiberius, since  then he had a colour for separating Germanicus from his old and faithful  legions; for setting him over strange provinces, and exposing him at  once to casual perils and the efforts of fraud. But he, the more ardent  he found the affections of the soldiers, and the greater the hatred of  his uncle, so much the more intent upon a decisive victory, weighed  with himself all the methods of that war, with all the disasters and  successes which had befallen him in it to this his third year. He  remembered \"that the Germans were ever routed in a fair battle, and upon  equal ground; that woods and bogs, short summers, and early winters,  were their chief resources; that his own men suffered not so much from  their wounds, as from tedious marches, and the loss of their arms. The  Gauls were weary of furnishing horses; long and cumbersome was his train  of baggage, easily surprised, and with difficulty defended; but, if we  entered the country by sea, the invasion would be easy, and the enemy  unapprised. Besides, the war would be earlier begun; the legions and  provisions would be carried together; and the cavalry brought with  safety, through the mouths and channels of the rivers, into the heart of  Germany.\"    On that method therefore he fixed: whilst Publius Vitellius and Publius  Cantius were sent to collect the tribute of the Gauls; Silius, Anteius,  and Caecina had the direction of building the fleet. A thousand vessels  were thought sufficient, and with despatch finished: some were short,  sharp at both ends, and wide in the middle, the easier to endure the  agitations of the waves; some had flat bottoms, that without damage  they might bear to run aground; several had helms at each end, that by  suddenly turning the oars only they might work either way. Many were  arched over, for carrying the engines of war. They were fitted for  holding horses and provisions, to fly with sails, to run with oars, and  the spirit and alacrity of the soldiers heightened the show and terror  of the fleet. They were to meet at the Isle of Batavia, which was chosen  for its easy landing, for its convenience to receive the forces, and  thence to transport them to the war. For the Rhine, flowing in one  continual channel, or only broken by small islands, is, at the extremity  of Batavia, divided as it were into two rivers; one running still  through Germany, and retaining the same name and violent current, till  it mixes with the ocean; the other, washing the Gallic shore, with a  broader and more gentle stream, is by the inhabitants called by another  name, the Wahal, which it soon after changes for that of the river  Meuse, by whose immense mouth it is discharged into the same ocean.    While the fleet sailed, Germanicus commanded Silius, his lieutenant,  with a flying band, to invade the Cattans; and he himself, upon hearing  that the fort upon the river Luppia [Footnote: Lippe.] was besieged, led  six legions thither: but the sudden rains prevented Silius from doing  more than taking some small plunder, with the wife and daughter of  Arpus, Prince of the Cattans; nor did the besiegers stay to fight  Germanicus, but upon the report of his approach stole off and dispersed.  As they had, however, thrown down the common tomb lately raised over  the Varian legions, and the old altar erected to Drusus, he restored the  altar; and performed in person with the legions the funeral ceremony of  running courses to the honour of his father. To replace the tomb was  not thought fit; but all the space between Fort Aliso and the Rhine, he  fortified with a new barrier.    The fleet was now arrived, the provisions were sent forward; ships were  assigned to the legions and the allies; and he entered the canal cut  by Drusus, and called by his name. Here he invoked his father \"to be  propitious to his son attempting the same enterprises; to inspire him  with the same counsels, and animate him by his example.\" Hence he  sailed fortunately through the lakes and the ocean to the river Amisia,  [Footnote: Ems.] and at the town of Amisia the fleet was left upon the  left shore; and it was a fault that it sailed no higher, for he landed  the army on the right shore, so that in making bridges many days were  consumed. The horse and the legions passed over without danger, as it  was yet ebb; but the returning tide disordered the rear, especially the  Batavians, while they played with the waves, and showed their dexterity  in swimming; and some were drowned. Whilst Germanicus was encamping, he  was told of the revolt of the Angrivarians behind him, and thither he  despatched a body of horse and light foot, under Stertinius, who with  fire and slaughter took vengeance on the perfidious revolters.    Between the Romans and the Cheruscans flowed the river Visurgis,  [Footnote: Weser.] and on the banks of it stood Arminius, with the other  chiefs: he inquired whether Germanicus was come; and being answered that  he was there, he prayed leave to speak with his brother. This brother  of his was in the army, his name Flavius; one remarkable for his lasting  faith towards the Romans, and for the loss of an eye in the war under  Tiberius. This request was granted: Flavius stepped forward, and was  saluted by Arminius, who, having removed his own attendance, desired  that our archers ranged upon the opposite banks might retire. When  they were withdrawn, \"How came you,\" says he to his brother, \"by that  deformity in your face?\" The brother having informed him where, and  in what fight, was next asked, \"what reward he had received?\" Flavius  answered, \"Increase of pay, the chain, the crown, and other military  gifts;\" all which Arminius treated with derision, as the vile wages of  servitude.    Here began a warm contest: Flavius pleaded \"the grandeur of the Roman  Empire, the power of the Emperor, the Roman clemency to submitting  nations, the heavy yoke of the vanquished; and that neither the wife nor  son of Arminius was used like a captive.\" Arminius to all this opposed  \"the natural rights of their country, their ancient liberty, the  domestic Gods of Germany; he urged the prayers of their common mother  joined to his own, that he would not prefer the character of a deserter,  that of a betrayer of his family, his countrymen, and kindred, to the  glory of being their commander.\" By degrees they fell into reproaches;  nor would the interposition of the river have restrained them from  blows, had not Stertinius hasted to lay hold on Flavius, full of rage,  and calling for his arms and his horse. On the opposite side was seen  Arminius, swelling with ferocity and threats, and denouncing battle.  For, of what he said, much was said in Latin, having as the General of  his countrymen served in the Roman armies.    Next day, the German army stood embattled beyond the Visurgis.  Germanicus, who thought it became not a General to endanger the legions,  till for their passage and security he had placed bridges and guards,  made the horse ford over. They were led by Stertinius, and Aemilius,  Lieutenant-Colonel of a legion; and these two officers crossed the  river in distant places, to divide the foe. Cariovalda, Captain of the  Batavians, passed it where most rapid, and was by the Cheruscans, who  feigned flight, drawn into a plain surrounded with woods, whence they  rushed out upon him and assaulted him on every side; overthrew those who  resisted, and"]]]
