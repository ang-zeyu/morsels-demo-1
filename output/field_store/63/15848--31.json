On the southern coast of Asia Minor, some towns still sustained the  rank they had attained one or two centuries before. The capital of Caria  was Halicarnassus, a very strong town, defended by two citadels,[385]  and celebrated for one of the finest works of Greek art, the  _Mausoleum_. In spite of the extraordinary fertility of the country, the  Carians were accustomed, like the people of Crete, to engage as  mercenaries in the Greek armies.[386] On their territory stood the  Ionian town of Miletus, with its four ports.[387] The Milesians alone  had civilised the shores of the Black Sea by the foundation of about  eighty colonies.[388]    In turn independent, or placed under foreign dominion, Lycia, a province  comprised between Caria and Cilicia, possessed some rich commercial  towns. One especially, renowned for its ancient oracle of Apollo, no  less celebrated than that of Delphi, was remarkable for its spacious  port;[389] this was Patara, which was large enough to contain the whole  fleet of Antiochus, burnt by Fabius in 565.[390] Xanthus, the largest  town of the province, to which place ships ascended, only lost its  importance after having been pillaged by Brutus.[391] Its riches had at  an earlier period drawn upon it the same fate from the Persians.[392]  Under the Roman dominion, Lycia beheld its population decline gradually;  and of the seventy towns which it had possessed, no more than thirty-six  remained in the eighth century of Rome.[393]    More to the east, the coasts of Cilicia were less favoured; subjugated  in turn by the Macedonians, Egyptians, and Syrians, they had become  receptacles of pirates, who were encouraged by the kings of Egypt in  their hostility to the Seleucidae.[394] From the heights of the mountains  which cross a part of the province, robbers descended to plunder the  fertile plains situated on the eastern side (_Cilicia Campestris_).[395]  Still, the part watered by the Cydnus and the Pyramus was more  prosperous, owing to the manufacture of coarse linen and to the export  of saffron. There stood ancient Tarsus, formerly the residence of a  satrap, the commerce of which had sprung up along with that of  Tyre;[396] and Soli, on which Alexander levied an imposition of a  hundred talents as a punishment for its fidelity to the Persians,[397]  and which, by its maritime position, excited the envy of the  Rhodians.[398] These towns and other ports entered, after the battle of  Ipsus, into the great commercial movement of which the provinces of  Syria became the seat.      [Sidenote: Syria.]    XV. By the foundation of the empire of the Seleucidae, Greek civilisation  was carried into the interior of Asia, where the immobility of Eastern  society was succeeded by the activity of Western life. Greek letters and  arts flourished from the Sea of Phoenicia to the banks of the  Euphrates. Numerous towns were built in Syria and Assyria, with all the  richness and elegance of the edifices of Greece;[399] some were almost  in ruins in the time of Pliny.[400] Seleucia, founded by Seleucus  Nicator, at the mouth of the Orontes, and which received, with five  other towns built by the same monarch, the name of the head of the  Graeco-Syrian dynasty, became a greatly frequented port. Antioch, built  on the same river, rivalled the finest towns of Egypt and Greece by the  number of its edifices, the extent of its places, and the beauty of its  temples and statues.[401] Its walls, built by the architect Xenaeos,  passed for a wonder, and in the Middle Ages their ruins excited the  admiration of travellers.[402] Antioch consisted of four quarters,  having each its own enclosure;[403] and the common enclosure which  surrounded them all appears to have embraced an extent of six leagues in  circumference. Not far from the town was the delightful abode of Daphne,  where the wood, consecrated to Apollo and Diana, was an object of public  veneration, and the place where sumptuous festivals were  celebrated.[404] Apamea was renowned for its pastures. Seleucus had  formed there a stud of 30,000 mares, 300 stallions, and 500  elephants.[405] The Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis (now _Baalbek_) was  the most colossal work of architecture that had ever existed.[406]    The power of the empire of the Seleucidae went on increasing until the  time when the Romans seized upon it. Extending from the Mediterranean to  the Oxus and Caucasus, this empire was composed of nearly all the  provinces of the ancient kingdom of the Persians, and included peoples  of different origins.[407] Media was fertile, and its capital, Ecbatana,  which Polybius represents as excelling in riches and the incredible  luxury of its palaces the other cities of Asia, had not yet been  despoiled by Antiochus III.;[408] Babylonia, once the seat of a powerful  empire, and Phoenicia, long the most commercial country in the world,  made part of Syria, and touched upon the frontiers of the Parthians.  Caravans, following a route which has remained the same during many  centuries, placed Syria in communication with Arabia,[409] whence came  ebony, ivory, perfumes, resins, and spices; the Syrian ports were the  intermediate marts for the merchants who proceeded as far as India,  where Seleucus I. went to conclude a treaty with Sandrocottus. The  merchandise of this country ascended the Euphrates as far as Thapsacus,  and thence it was exported to all the provinces.[410] Communications so  distant and multiplied explain the prosperity of the empire of the  Seleucidae. Babylonia competed with Phrygia in embroidered tissues;  purple and the tissues of Tyre, the glass, goldsmiths' work, and dyes of  Sidon, were exported far. Commerce had penetrated to the extremities of  Asia. Silk stuffs were sent from the frontiers of China to Caspiae Portae,  and thence conveyed by caravans at once towards the Tyrian Sea,  Mesopotamia, and Pontus.[411] Subsequently, the invasion of the  Parthians, by intercepting the routes, prevented the Greeks from  penetrating into the heart of Asia. Hence Seleucus Nicator formed the  project of opening a way of direct communication between Greece and  Bactriana, by constructing a canal from the Black Sea to the Caspian  Sea.[412] Mines of precious metals were rather rare in Syria; but there  was abundance of gold and silver, introduced by the Phoenicians, or  imported from Arabia or Central Asia. We may judge of the abundance of  money possessed by Seleucia, on the Tigris, by the amount of the  contribution which was extorted from it by Antiochus III. (a thousand  talents).[413] The sums which the Syrian monarchs engaged to pay to the  Romans were immense.[414] The soil gave produce equal in importance with  that of industry.[415] Susiana, one of the provinces of Persia which had  fallen under the dominion of the Seleucidae, had so great a reputation  for its corn, that Egypt alone could compete with it.[416] Coele-Syria  was, like the north of Mesopotamia, in repute for its cattle.[417]  Palestine furnished abundance of wheat, oil, and wine. The condition of  Syria was still so prosperous in the seventh century of Rome, that the  philosopher Posidonius represents its inhabitants as indulging in  continual festivals, and dividing their time between the labours of the  field, banquets, and the exercises of the gymnasium.[418] The festivals  of Antiochus IV., in the town of Daphne,[419] give a notion of the  extravagance displayed by the grandees of that country.    The military forces assembled at different epochs by the kings of Syria  enable us to estimate the population of their empire. In 537, at the  battle of Raphia, Antiochus had under his command 68,000 men;[420] in  564, at Magnesia, 62,000 infantry, and more than 12,000 horsemen.[421]  These armies, it is true, comprised auxiliaries of different nations.  The Jews of the district of Carmel alone could raise 40,000 men.[422]    The fleet was no less imposing. Phoenicia counted numerous ports and  well-stored arsenals; such were Aradus (_Ruad_), Berytus (_Beyrout_),  Tyre (_Sour_). This latter town raised itself gradually from its  decline. It was the same with Sidon (_Saide_), which Antiochus III., in  his war with Ptolemy, did not venture to attack on account of its  soldiers, its stores, and its population.[423] Moreover, the greater  part of the Phoenician towns enjoyed, under the Seleucidae, a certain  autonomy favourable to their industry. In Syria, Seleucia, which  Antiochus the Great recovered from the Egyptians, had become the first  port in the kingdom on the Mediterranean.[424] Laodicea carried on an  active commerce with Alexandria.[425] Masters of the coasts of Cilicia  and Pamphylia, the kings of Syria obtained from them great quantities of  timber for ship-building, which was floated down the rivers from the  mountains.[426] Thus uniting their vessels with those of the  Phoenicians, the Seleucidae launched upon the Mediterranean  considerable armies.[427]    Distant commerce also employed numerous merchant vessels; the  Mediterranean, like the Euphrates, was furrowed by barques which brought  or carried merchandise of every description. Vessels sailing on the  Erythraean Sea were in communication, by means of canals, with the shores  of the Mediterranean. The great trade of Phoenicia with Spain and the  West had ceased, but the navigation of the Euphrates and the Tigris  replaced it for the transport of products, whether foreign or  fabricated in Syria itself, and sent into Asia Minor, Greece, or Egypt.  The empire of the Seleucidae offered the spectacle of the ancient  civilisation and luxury of Nineveh and Babylon, transformed by the  genius of Greece.      [Sidenote: Egypt.]    XVI. Egypt, which Herodotus calls a present from the Nile, did not equal  in surface a quarter of the empire of the Seleucidae, but it formed a  power much more compact. Its civilisation reached back more than three  thousand years."]]]
