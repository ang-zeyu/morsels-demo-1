Let _can_ and _must_ be used in place of _may_; and _could_, _would_, and  _should_, in place of _might_.    Require the pupils to tell how each tense is formed, and to note all  changes for agreement in number and person.    A majority of modern writers use the _indicative_ forms instead of the  _subjunctive_, in all of the tenses, unless it may be the _present_. The  _subjunctive_ forms of the verb _to be_ are retained in the present and the  past tense. Let the pupils understand that the mode and tense forms do not  always correspond with the actual meaning. _The ship sails next week. I may  go to-morrow_. The verbs _sails_ and _may go_ are _present_ in form but  _future_ in meaning. _If it rains by noon, he may not come_. The verb  _rains_ is _indicative_ in form but _subjunctive_ in meaning.    The plural forms, _You saw, You were_, etc., are used in the _singular_  also.          LESSON 93.    CONJUGATION OF THE VERB--SIMPLE FORM.

The dip of the green slates continues the same; but by degrees the  direction of their strata becomes parallel to the general direction of  the primitive rocks of the chain of the coast. At Piedras Azules these  slates, mingled with hornblende, cover in concordant stratification a  blackish-blue slate, very fissile, and traversed by small veins of  quartz. The green slates include some strata of grunstein, and even  contain balls of that substance. I nowhere saw the green slates  alternate with the black slates of the ravine of Piedras Azules: at  the line of junction these two slates appear rather to pass one into  the other, the green slates becoming of a pearl-grey in proportion as  they lose their hornblende.    Farther south, towards Parapara and Ortiz, the slates disappear. They  are concealed under a trap-formation more varied in its aspect. The  soil becomes more fertile; the rocky masses alternate with strata of  clay, which appear to be produced by the decomposition of the  grunsteins, the amygdaloids, and the phonolites.    The grunstein, which farther north was less granulous, and passed into  serpentine, here assumes a very different character. It contains balls  of mandelstein, or amygdaloid, eight or ten inches in diameter. These  balls, sometimes a little flattened, are divided into concentric  layers: this is the effect of decomposition. Their nucleus is almost  as hard as basalt, and they are intermingled with little cavities,  owing to bubbles of gas, filled with green earth, and crystals of  pyroxene and mesotype. Their basis is greyish blue, rather soft, and  showing small white spots which, by the regular form they present, I  should conceive to be decomposed feldspar. M. von Buch examined with a  powerful lens the species we brought. He discovered that each crystal  of pyroxene, enveloped in the earthy mass, is separated from it by  fissures parallel to the sides of the crystal. These fissures seem to  be the effect of a contraction which the mass or basis of the  mandelstein has undergone. I sometimes saw these balls of mandelstein  arranged in strata, and separated from each other by beds of grunstein  of ten or fourteen inches thick; sometimes (and this situation is most  common) the balls of mandelstein, two or three feet in diameter, are  found in heaps, and form little mounts with rounded summits, like  spheroidal basalt. The clay which separates these amygdaloid  concretions arises from the decomposition of their crust. They acquire  by the contact of the air a very thin coating of yellow ochre.    South-west of the village of Parapara rises the little Cerro de  Flores, which is discerned from afar in the steppes. Almost at its  foot, and in the midst of the mandelstein tract we have just been  describing, a porphyritic phonolite, a mass of compact feldspar of a  greenish grey, or mountain-green, containing long crystals of vitreous  feldspar, appears exposed. It is the real porphyrschiefer of Werner;  and it would be difficult to distinguish, in a collection of stones,  the phonolite of Parapara from that of Bilin, in Bohemia. It does not,  however, here form rocks in grotesque shapes, but little hills covered  with tabular blocks, large plates extremely sonorous, translucid on  the edges, and wounding the hands when broken.    Such are the successions of rocks, which I described on the spot as I  progressively found them, from the lake of Tacarigua to the entrance  of the steppes. Few places in Europe display a geological arrangement  so well worthy of being studied. We saw there in succession six  formations: namely, mica-slate-gneiss, green transition-slate, black  transition-limestone, serpentine and grunstein, amygdaloid (with  pyroxene), and phonolite.    I must observe, in the first place, that the substance just described  under the name of grunstein, in every respect resembles that which  forms layers in the mica-slate of Cabo Blanco, and veins near Caracas.  It differs only by containing neither quartz, garnets, nor pyrites.  The close relations we observed near the Cerro de Chacao, between the  grunstein and the serpentine, cannot surprise these geologists who  have studied the mountains of Franconia and Silesia. Near Zobtenberg*  (* Between Tampadel and Silsterwiz.) a serpentine rock alternates also  with gabbro. In the district of Glatz the fissures of the gabbro are  filled with a steatite of a greenish white colour, and the rock which  was long thought to belong to the grunsteins* is a close mixture of  feldspar and diallage. (* In the mountains of Bareuth, in Franconia,  so abundant in grunstein and serpentine, these formations are not  connected together. The serpentine there belongs rather to the  schistose hornblende (hornblendschiefer), as in the island of Cuba.  Near Guanaxuato, in Mexico, I saw it alternating with syenite. These  phenomena of serpentine rocks forming layers in eurite (weisstein), in  schistose hornblende, in gabbro, and in syenite, are so much the more  remarkable, as the great mass of garnetiferous serpentines, which are  found in the mountains of gneiss and mica-slate, form little distinct  mounts, masses not covered by other formations. It is not the same in  the mixtures of serpentine and granulated limestone.)    The grunsteins of Tucutunemo, which we consider as constituting the  same formation as the serpentine rock, contain veins of malachite and  copper-pyrites. These same metalliferous combinations are found also  in Franconia, in the grunsteins of the mountains of Steben and  Lichtenberg. With respect to the green slates of Malpaso, which have  all the characters of transition-slates, they are identical with those  which M. von Buch has so well described, near Schonau, in Silesia.  They contain beds of grunstein, like the slates of the mountains of  Steben just mentioned.* (* On advancing into the adit for draining the  Friedrich-Wilhelmstollen mine, which I caused to be begun in 1794,  near Steben, and which is yet only 340 toises long, there have  successively been found, in the transition-slate subordinate strata of  pure and porphyritic grunstein, strata, of Lydian stone and ampelite  (alaunschiefer), and strata of fine-grained grunstein. All these  strata characterise the transition-slates.) The black limestone of the  Morros de San Juan is also a transition-limestone. It forms perhaps a  subordinate stratum in the slates of Malpaso. This situation would be  analogous to what is observed in several parts of Switzerland.* (* For  Instance, at the Glyshorn, at the Col de Balme, etc.) The slaty zone,  the centre of which is the ravine of Piedras Azules, appears divided  into two formations. On some points we think we observe one passing  into the other.    The grunsteins, which begin again to the south of these slates, appear  to me to differ little from those found north of the ravine of Piedras  Azules. I did not see there any pyroxene; but on the very spot I  recognized a number of crystals in the amygdaloid, which appears so  strongly linked to the grunstein that they alternate several times.    The geologist may consider his task as fulfilled when he has traced  with accuracy the positions of the diverse strata; and has pointed out  the analogies traceable between these positions and what has been  observed in other countries. But how can he avoid being tempted to go  back to the origin of so many different substances, and to inquire how  far the dominion of fire has extended in the mountains that bound the  great basin of the steppes? In researches on the position of rocks we  have generally to complain of not sufficiently perceiving the  connection between the masses, which we believe to be superimposed on  one another. Here the difficulty seems to arise from the too intimate  and too numerous relations observed in rocks that are thought not to  belong to the same family.    The phonolite (or leucostine compacte of Cordier) is pretty generally  regarded by all who have at once examined burning and extinguished  volcanoes, as a flow of lithoid lava. I found no real basalt or  dolerite; but the presence of pyroxene in the amygdaloid of Parapara  leaves little doubt of the igneous origin of those spheroidal masses,  fissured, and full of cavities. Balls of this amygdaloid are enclosed  in the grunstein; and this grunstein alternates on one side with a  green slate, on the other with the serpentine of Tucutunemo. Here,  then, is a connexion sufficiently close established between the  phonolites and the green slates, between the pyroxenic amygdaloids and  the serpentines containing copper-ores, between volcanic substances  and others that are included under the vague name of transition-traps.  All these masses are destitute of quartz like the real  trap-porphyries, or volcanic trachytes. This phenomenon is the more  remarkable, as the grunsteins which are called primitive almost always  contain quartz in Europe. The most general dip of the slates of  Piedras Azules, of the grunsteins of Parapara, and of the pyroxenic  amygdaloids embedded in strata of grunstein, does not follow the slope  of the ground from north to south, but is pretty regular towards the  north. The strata incline towards the chain of the coast, as  substances which had not been in fusion might be supposed to do. Can  we admit that so many alternating rocks, imbedded one in the other,  have a common origin? The nature of the phonolites, which are lithoid  lavas with a feldspar basis, and the nature of the green slates  intermixed with hornblende, oppose this opinion. In this state of  things we may choose between two solutions of the problem in question.  In one of these solutions the phonolite of the Cerro de Flores is to  be regarded as the sole volcanic production of the tract; and we are  forced to unite the pyroxenic amygdaloids with the rest of the  grunsteins, in one single formation, that"]]]
