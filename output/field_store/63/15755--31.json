Those buds that sink usually fall in such  a way that their proximal, flattened end comes in contact with the  bottom or some suspended object, to which it adheres. Sometimes,  however, owing to irregularity of outline in the distal end, the  proximal end is uppermost. In this case it is the distal end that  adheres. Whichever end is uppermost, it is in the uppermost end, or as  it may now be called, the upper surface, that the osculum is formed.  Water is drawn into the young sponge through the pores and, finding no  outlet, accumulates under the external membrane, the subdermal cavity  being at this stage even larger than it is in the adult sponge.  Immediately after adhesion the young sponge flattens itself out. This  process apparently presses together the water in the subdermal cavity  and causes a large part of it to accumulate at one point, which is  usually situated near the centre of the upper surface. A transparent  conical projection formed of the external membrane arises at this point,  and at the tip of the cone a white spot appears. What is the exact cause  of this spot I have not yet been able to ascertain, but it marks the  point at which the imprisoned water breaks through the expanded  membrane, thus forming the first osculum. Before the aperture is formed,  it is already possible to distinguish on the surface of the parenchyma  numerous channels radiating from the point at which the osculum will be  formed to the periphery of the young sponge. These channels as a rule  persist in the adult organism and result from the fact that the inhalent  apertures are situated at the periphery, being absent from both the  proximal and the distal ends of the bud. In the case of floating buds  the course of development is the same, except that the osculum, as in  the case of development from the gemmule in other species (see Zykoff,  Biol. Centrbl. xii, p. 713, 1892), is usually formed before adhesion  takes place.    The sponge of _S. proliferens_ is usually too small to afford shelter to  other animals, and I have not found in it any of those commonly  associated with _S. carteri_ and _S. alba_.    Owing to its small size _S. proliferens_ is more easily kept alive in an  aquarium than most species, and its production of buds can be studied in  captivity. In captivity a curious phenomenon is manifested, viz. the  production of extra oscula, often in large numbers. This is due either  to a feebleness in the currents of the sponge which makes it difficult  to get rid of waste substances or to the fact that the canals get  blocked. The effluent water collects in patches under the external  membrane instead of making its way out of the existing oscula, and new  oscula are formed over these patches in much the same way as the first  osculum is formed in the bud.      3.

Surface smooth and undulating or with  irregular or conical projections; sponge hard but brittle; colour white  or whitish; oscula of moderate or large size, never very conspicuous;  radiating furrows absent or very short; external membrane adhering to  the substance of the sponge.    _Skeleton_ forming a moderately dense network of slender radiating and  transverse fibres feebly held together; little spongin present; the  meshes much smaller than in _S. lacustris_ or _S. proliferens_.    _Spicules._ Skeleton-spicules smooth, sharply pointed, slender, feebly  curved. Gemmule-spicules (fig. 8, p. 71) slender, cylindrical, blunt or  abruptly pointed at the ends, feebly curved, bearing relatively long  backwardly directed spines, which are usually more numerous at the ends  than near the middle of the shaft. Flesh-spicules very numerous in the  parenchyma and especially the external membrane, as a rule considerably  more slender and more sharply pointed than the gemmule-spicules, covered  with straight spines which are often longer at the middle of the shaft  than at the ends.    _Gemmules_ usually of large size, with a moderately thick granular  layer; spicules never very numerous, often lying horizontally on the  external surface of the gemmule as well as tangentially in the granular  layer; no foraminal tubule; a foraminal cup sometimes present.      3_a_.

(7)       xx, p. 523 (1907).    This variety is distinguished from the typical form by the total absence  of flesh-spicules. The gemmule-spicules are also more numerous and cross  one another more regularly.      3_b_. Var. bengalensis*, _Annandale_. (Plate I, figs. 1-3.)         _Spongilla lacustris_ var. _bengalensis_, Annandale, J.       Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 1906, p. 56.         _Spongilla alba_ var. _marina_, _id._, Rec. Ind. Mus. i, p.       389 (1907).    The sponge is either devoid of branches or produces irregular,  compressed, and often digitate processes, sometimes of considerable  length and delicacy. Flesh-spicules are usually present throughout the  sponge, but are sometimes absent from one part of a specimen and present  in others. Some of the gemmules are often much smaller than the others.  Perhaps this form should be regarded as a phase rather than a true  variety (see p. 18).    All forms of _S. alba_ can be distinguished from all forms of _S.  lacustris_ by the much closer network of the skeleton and by the  consequent hardness of the sponge; also by the complete absence of green  corpuscles.    TYPES. The types of the species and of the var. _cerebellata_ are in the  British Museum, with fragments of the former in the Indian Museum; that  of var. _bengalensis_ is in the Indian Museum, with a co-type in London.    GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.--India And Egypt. _Localities_:--BOMBAY  PRESIDENCY, island of Bombay (_Carter_); Igatpuri, W. Ghats  (_Annandale_): BENGAL, Calcutta; Port Canning, Ganges delta (var.  _bengalensis_) (_Annandale_); Garia, Salt Lakes, nr. Calcutta (var.  _bengalensis_) (_B. L. Chaudhuri_); Chilka Lake, Orissa (var.  _bengalensis_) (_Gopal Chunder Chatterjee_): MADRAS PRESIDENCY, Rambha,  Ganjam district (_Annandale_): NIZAM'S TERRITORY, Aurangabad  (_Bowerbank_, var. _cerebellata_). The var. _cerebellata_ has also been  taken near Cairo.    BIOLOGY.--The typical form of the species is usually found growing on  rocks or bricks at the edges of ponds, while the variety _bengalensis_  abounds on grass-roots in pools and swamps of brackish water in the  Ganges delta and has been found on mussel-shells (_Modiola jenkinsi_,  Preston) in practically salt water in the Chilka Lake. Carter procured  the typical form at Bombay on stones which were only covered for six  months in the year, and \"temporarily on floating objects.\" In Calcutta  this form flourishes in the cold weather on artificial stonework in the  \"tanks\" together with _S. carteri_, _S. fragilis_, _Ephydatia meyeni_,  and _Trochospongilla latouchiana_.    The variety _bengalensis_ is best known to me as it occurs in certain  ponds of brackish water at Port Canning on the Mutlah River, which  connects the Salt Lakes near Calcutta with the sea. It appears in these  ponds in great luxuriance every year at the beginning of the cold  weather and often coats the whole edge for a space of several hundred  feet, growing in irregular masses which are more or less fused together  on the roots and stems of a species of grass that flourishes in such  situations. Apparently the tendency for the sponges to form branches is  much more marked in some years than in others (see Pl. I, figs. 1-3).  The gemmules germinate towards the end of the \"rains,\" and large masses  of sponge are not formed much before December. At this season, however,  the level of the water in the ponds sinks considerably and many of the  sponges become dry. If high winds occur, the dry sponges are broken up  and often carried for considerable distances over the flat surrounding  country. In January the gemmules floating on the surface of the ponds  form a regular scum. _S. alba_ var. _bengalensis_ is the only sponge  that occurs in these ponds at Port Canning, but _S. lacustris_, subsp.  _reticulata_, is occasionally found with it on brickwork in the ditches  that drain off the water from the neighbouring fields into the Mutlah  estuary. The latter sponge, however, perishes as these ditches dry up,  at an earlier period than that at which _S. alba_ reaches its maximum  development.    The larvae of _Sisyra indica_ are commonly found in the oscula of the  typical form of _S. alba_ as well as in those of _S. lacustris_ subsp.  _reticulata_, and _S. carteri_; but the compact structure of the sponge  renders it a less suitable residence for other _incolae_ than _S.  carteri_.    In the variety _bengalensis_, as it grows in the ponds at Port Canning,  a large number of arthropods, molluscs and other small animals take  shelter.

She had merely seen her doing what almost every lady did a hundred  times in the year in those day--preparing some simples in the still-room;  and gradually as she found that gentle hints proved unsuccessful, she  resumed her natural dignity of demeanor. That again gave way to a chilling  silence, and then to a somewhat irritable imperiousness, and rising from  her chair, she begged her visitor to excuse her, alledging that she had  business of importance to transact which would occupy her during the whole  day.    Not one of all the variation of conduct--not one sign, however slight, of  impatience, doubt, or anger--escaped the keen eye that was fixed upon her.  Mrs. Hazleton, under the influence of conscience, did not exactly betray  the dark secrets of her own heart, but she raised into importance, an act  in itself the most trifling, which would have passed without any notice had  she not been anxious to conceal it.    As soon as her visitor, taking a hint that could not be mistaken, had  quitted the room and the house, with an air of pique and ill-humor, Mrs.  Hazleton returned to the still-room and recommenced her operations there;  but she found her hand shaking and her whole frame agitated.    \"Am I a fool,\" she asked herself, \"to be thus moved by an empty gossip like  that? I must conquer this, or I shall be unfit for my task.\"    She sat down at a table, leaned her head upon her hand, gazed forth out of  the little window, forced her mind away from the present, thought of birds  and flowers, and pictures and statues, and of the two sunshiny worlds of  art and nature--of every thing in short but the dark, dark cares of her own  passions. It was a trick she had learned to play with herself--one of those  pieces of internal policy by which she had contrived so often and so long,  to rule and master with despotic sway the frequent rebellions of the body  against the tyranny of the mind.    She had not sat there two minutes, however, ere there was a tap at the  door, and she started with a quick and jarring thrill, as if that knock had  been a summons of fate. The next instant she looked quickly around,  however, and was satisfied that whoever entered could find no cause for  suspicion. She was there seated quietly at the table. The vial was out of  sight, the fatal powder hidden in the palm of her hand, and she said aloud,  \"Come in.\"    The butler entered, bowing profoundly and saying, \"The carriage is at the  door, madam, and Wilson has just come back from the house of Mr. Shanks,  but he could not find him.\"    The man hesitated a little as if he wished to add something more, and Mrs.  Hazleton replied in a somewhat sharp tone, \"I told you when I sent it away  just now that I would tell you when I was ready. I shall not be so for half  an hour; but let it wait, and do not admit any one. Mr. Shanks must be  found, and informed that I want to see him early to-morrow, as I shall go  to London on the following day.\"    \"I am sorry to say, madam,\" replied the butler, \"that if the talk of the  town is true, he will not be able to come. They say he has been apprehended  on a charge of perjury and forgery in regard to that business of Sir Philip  Hastings, and has been sent off to the county jail.\"    Mrs. Hazleton looked certainly a little aghast, and merely saying \"Indeed!\"  she waved her hand for the man to withdraw.    She then sat silent and motionless for at least five minutes. What passed  within her I cannot tell; but when she rose, though pale as marble, she was  firm, calm, and self-possessed as ever. She turned the key in the lock; she  drew a curtain which covered the lower half of the window, farther across,  so that no eye from without, except the eye of God, could see what she was  doing there within. She then drew forth the vial from its nook, opened out  the small packet of powder, and poured part of it into a glass. She seemed  as if she were going to pour the whole, but she paused in doing so, and  folded up the rest again, saying, \"That must be fully enough; I will keep  the rest; it may be serviceable, and I can get no more.\"    She gazed down upon the ground near her feet with a look of cold, stern,  but awful resolution, as if there had been an open grave before her; and  then she placed the packet in her glove, poured a little distilled water  into the glass, shook it, and held the mixture up to the light. The powder  had in great part dissolved, but not entirely, and she added a small  quantity more of the distilled water, and poured the whole into the vial,  which was already about one-third full of a dark colored liquid.    \"Now I will go,\" she said, concealing the bottle. But when she reached the  door, and had her hand upon the lock, she paused and remained in very deep  thought for an instant, with her brow slightly contracted and her lip  quivering. Heaven knows what she thought of then,--whether it was doubt, or  fear, or pity, or remorse--but she said in a low tone, \"Down, fool! it  shall be done,\" and she passed out of the room.    She paused suddenly in the little passage which led to the still-room, by a  pair of double doors, into the principal part of the house, perceiving with  some degree of consternation that she had been unconsciously carrying the  vial with its dark colored contents in her hand, exposed to the view of all  observers. Her eye ran round the passage with a quick and eager glance; but  there was no one in sight, and she felt reassured. Even at that moment she  could smile at her own heedlessness, and she did smile as she placed the  bottle in her pocket, saying to herself, \"How foolish! I must not suffer  such fits of absence to come upon me, or I shall spoil all.\"    She then walked quietly to her dressing-room, arranged her dress for the  little journey before her, and descended again to the hall, where the  servants were waiting for her coming. After she had entered the carriage,  however, she again fell into a fit of deep thought, closed her eyes, and  remained as if half asleep for nearly an hour. Perhaps it would be too much  to scrutinize the state or changes of her feelings during that long,  painful lapse of thought. That there was a struggle--a terrible  struggle--can hardly be doubted--that opportunity was given her for  repentance, for desistance, between the purpose and the deed, we know; and  there can be little doubt that the small, still voice--which is ever the  voice of God--spoke to her from the spirit-depth within, and warned her to  forbear. But she was of an unconquerable nature; nothing could turn her;  nothing could overpower her, when she had once resolved on any act. There  was no persuasion had effect; no remonstrance was powerful. Reason,  conscience, habit itself, were but dust in the balance in the face of one  of her determinations.    She roused herself suddenly from her fit of moody abstraction, when the  carriage was still more than a mile from the house of Sir Philip Hastings.  She looked at the watch which hung by her side, and gazed at the sky; and  then she said to herself, \"That woman's impertinent intrusion was  intolerable. However, I shall get there an hour before the twenty-four  hours have passed, and doubtless she will have kept her word and refrained  from speaking till she has seen me; but I am afraid I shall find her woke  up from her mid-day doze, and that may make the matter somewhat difficult.  Difficult! why I have seen jugglers do tricks a thousand times to which  this is a mere trifle. My sleight of hand will not fail me, I think;\" and  then she set her mind to work to plan out every step of her proceedings.    All was clearly and definitely arranged by the time she arrived at the door  of Sir Philip Hastings' house. Her face was cleared of every cloud, her  whole demeanor under perfect control. She was the Mrs. Hazleton, the calm,  dignified, graceful Mrs. Hazleton, which the world knew; and when she  descended from the carriage with a slow but easy step, and spoke to the  coachman about one of the springs which had creaked and made a noise on the  way, not one of Sir Philip Hastings' servants could have believed that her  mind was occupied with any thing more grave than the idle frivolous  thoughts of an every-day society.           *       *       *       *       *    The shrewdest and most successful of politicians has given us the secret of  his policy in the words, Follow the public so closely that you shall seem  to lead it.    FOOTNOTES:    [9] Continued from page 201          MUSIC.    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE    BY H. W. PARKER.          The singing spheres      Entranced the very time they measured out;      And memory drew me back to one sweet year,      When, born anew to thought and love, the earth      Was new, and music--fancy's dancing light      Till then--became a dazzling revelation.      'Twas in a city, midway from the hymns      Of Trenton and Niagra. 'Twas an eve      When a whole nation sighed, as hour by hour,      The news electric ran that he was dying,      The Palo Alto hero. Then and there,      I hear the orchestra that once had winged      The festal hours when first the hero stood,      A nation's chief. To me, the hall, the crowd,      Were not; I watched a window-square of sky      Deepen from tender blue to night profound;      And, as it deepened, heard the voice of Time,      All Time, all joy and sorrow, madness, woe,      And saw a thousand forms of light and gloom,      From music born. Distorted faces glared;      Long lines of star-browed angels circled down,      And ages dead were summoned back to earth.      The horn rang out the joy of happy souls;      The viol screamed and laughed in scorn, and groans      Rose dread and deep from under gulfs of night.      The past, the future life of self, of all.      Before me crowded, wailed, entreated, warned,      Battled, triumphed,"]]]
