If in  reasons, comparisons, and arguments, I transplant any into my soile,  or confound them with mine owne, I purposely conceale the author,  thereby to bridle the rashnesse of these hastie censures that are so  headlong cast upon all manner of compositions, namely young writings  of men yet living; and in vulgare that admit all the world to talke  of them, and which seemeth to convince the conception and publike  designe alike. I will have them to give Plutarch a barb [Footnote:  Thrust, taunt] upon mine own lips, and vex themselves in wronging  Seneca in mee. My weaknesse must be hidden under such great credits.  I will love him that shal trace or unfeather me; I meane through  clearenesse of judgement, and by the onely distinction of the force  and beautie of my discourses. For my selfe, who for want of memorie  am ever to seeke how to trie and refine them by the knowledge of  their country, knowe perfectly, by measuring mine owne strength,  that my soyle is no way capable of some over-pretious flowers that  therein I find set, and that all the fruits of my increase could not  make it amends. This am I bound to answer for if I hinder my selfe,  if there be either vanitie or fault in my discourses that I perceive  not or am not able to discerne if they be showed me. For many faults  do often escape our eyes; but the infirmitie of judgement consisteth  in not being able to perceive them when another discovereth them  unto us. Knowledge and truth may be in us without judgement, and we  may have judgment without them: yea, the acknowledgement of  ignorance is one of the best and surest testimonies of judgement  that I can finde. I have no other sergeant of band to marshall my  rapsodies than fortune. And looke how my humours or conceites  present themselves, so I shuffle them up. Sometimes they prease out  thicke and three fold, and other times they come out languishing one  by one. I will have my naturall and ordinarie pace scene as loose  and as shuffling as it is. As I am, so I goe on plodding. And  besides, these are matters that a man may not be ignorant of, and  rashly and casually to speake of them. I would wish to have a more  perfect understanding of things, but I will not purchase it so deare  as it cost. My intention is to passe the remainder of my life  quietly and not laboriously, in rest and not in care. There is  nothing I will trouble or vex myselfe about, no not for science it  selfe, what esteeme soever it be of. I doe not search and tosse over  books but for an honester recreation to please, and pastime to  delight my selfe: or if I studie, I only endevour to find out the  knowledge that teacheth or handleth the knowledge of my selfe, and  which may instruct me how to die well and how to live well.         Has meus ad metas sudet oportet equus.       [Footnote: Propeet. 1. iv. El. i. 70]         My horse must sweating runne,       That this goale may be wonne.    If in reading I fortune to meet with any difficult points, I fret  not my selfe about them, but after I have given them a charge or  two, I leave them as I found them. Should I earnestly plod upon  them, I should loose both time and my selfe, for I have a skipping  wit. What I see not at the first view, I shall lesse see it if I  opinionate my selfe upon it. I doe nothing without blithnesse; and  an over obstinate continuation and plodding contention doth dazle,  dul, and wearie the same: my sight is thereby confounded and  diminished. I must therefore withdraw it, and at fittes goe to  it againe. Even as to judge well of the lustre of scarlet we are  taught to cast our eyes over it, in running over by divers glances,  sodaine glimpses and reiterated reprisings. [Footnote: Repeated  observations.] If one booke seeme tedious unto me I take another,  which I follow not with any earnestnesse, except it be at such  houres as I am idle, or that I am weary with doing nothing. I am  not greatly affected to new books, because ancient Authors are, in  my judgement, more full and pithy: nor am I much addicted to Greeke  books, forasmuch as my understanding cannot well rid [Footnote:  Accomplish.] his worke with a childish and apprentise intelligence.  Amongst moderne bookes meerly pleasant, I esteeme Bocace his  Decameron, Rabelais, and the kisses of John the second (if they  may be placed under this title), worth the paines-taking to reade  them.  As for Amadis and such like trash of writings, they had  never the credit so much as to allure my youth to delight in them.  This I will say more, either boldly or rashly, that this old and  heavie-pased minde of mine will no more be pleased with Aristotle,  or tickled with good Ovid: his facility and quaint inventions,  which heretofore have so ravished me, they can now a days scarcely  entertaine me. I speake my minde freely of all things, yea, of such  as peradventure exceed my sufficiencie, and that no way I hold to  be of my jurisdiction. What my conceit is of them is told also to  manifest the proportion of my insight, and not the measure of things.  If at any time I finde my selfe distasted of Platoes Axiochus, as of  a forceles worke, due regard had to such an Author, my judgement doth  nothing beleeve it selfe: It is not so fond-hardy, or selfe-conceited,  as it durst dare to oppose it selfe against the authority of so  many other famous ancient judgements, which he reputeth his regents  and masters, and with whom hee had rather erre. He chafeth with,  and condemneth himselfe, either to rely on the superficiall sense,  being unable to pierce into the centre, or to view the thing by some  false lustre. He is pleased only to warrant himselfe from trouble  and unrulinesse: As for weaknesse, he acknowledgeth and ingeniously  avoweth the same. He thinks to give a just interpretation to the  apparences which his conception presents unto him, but they are  shallow and imperfect. Most of AEsopes fables have divers senses,  and severall interpretations: Those which Mythologize them, chuse  some kinde of colour well suting with the fable; but for the most  part, it is no other than the first and superficiall glosse: There  are others more quicke, more sinnowie, more essentiall, and more  internall, into which they could never penetrate; and thus thinke  I with them. But to follow my course, I have ever deemed that in  Poesie, Virgil, Lucretius, Catullus, and Horace, doe doubtles by  far hold the first ranke: and especially Virgil in his Georgiks,  which I esteeme to be the most accomplished peece of worke of  Poesie: In comparison of which one may easily discerne, that there  are some passages in the AEneidos to which the Author (had he  lived) would no doubt have given some review or correction: The  fifth booke whereof is (in my mind) the most absolutely perfect. I  also love Lucan, and willingly read him, not so much for his stile,  as for his owne worth and truth of his opinion and judgement. As  for good Terence, I allow the quaintnesse and grace of his Latine  tongue, and judge him wonderfull conceited and apt, lively to  represent the motions and passions of the minde, and the condition  of our manners: our actions make me often remember him. I can never  reade him so often but still I discover some new grace and beautie  in him. Those that lived about Virgil's time, complained that some  would compare Lucretius unto him. I am of opinion that verily it is  an unequall comparison; yet can I hardly assure my selfe in this  opinion whensoever I finde my selfe entangled in some notable  passage of Lucretius. If they were moved at this comparison, what  would they say now of the fond, hardy and barbarous stupiditie of  those which now adayes compare Ariosto unto him? Nay, what  would Ariosto say of it himselfe?         O seclum insipiens et infacetutn.       [Footnote: Catul. Epig, xl. 8.]         O age that hath no wit,       And small conceit in it.    I thinke our ancestors had also more reason to cry out against those  that blushed not to equall Plautus unto Terence (who makes more show  to be a Gentleman) than Lucretius unto Virgil. This one thing doth  greatly advantage the estimation and preferring of Terence, that the  father of the Roman eloquence, of men of his quality doth so often  make mention of him; and the censure [Footnote: Opinion.] which the  chiefe Judge of the Roman Poets giveth of his companion. It hath  often come unto my minde, how such as in our dayes give themselves  to composing of comedies (as the Italians who are very happy in  them) employ three or foure arguments of Terence and Plautus to make  up one of theirs. In one onely comedy they will huddle up five or  six of Bocaces tales. That which makes them so to charge themselves  with matter, is the distrust they have of their owne sufficiency,  and that they are not able to undergoe so heavie a burthen with  their owne strength. They are forced to finde a body on which they  may rely and leane themselves: and wanting matter of their owne  wherewith to please us, they will have the story or tale to busie  and ammuse us: where as in my Authors it is cleane contrary: The  elegancies, the perfections and ornaments of his manner of speech,  make us neglect and lose the longing for his subject. His  quaintnesse and grace doe still retaine us to him. He is every where  pleasantly conceited, [Footnote: Full of pleasant notions.]         Liquidus puroque simillimus amni       [Footnote: Hor. 1. ii. Epist. II. 120.]         So clearely-neate, so neately-cleare,       As he a fine-pure River were,    and doth so replenish our minde with his graces that we forget those  of the fable. The same consideration drawes me somewhat further. I  perceive that good and ancient Poets have shunned the affectation  and enquest, not only of fantasticall, new fangled, Spagniolized,  and Petrarchisticall elevations, but also of more sweet and sparing  inventions, which are the ornament of all the Poeticall workes of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5669"],[0,"Considerations on Representative Government (#20)"],[1,"been, in  respect to intellectual endowments, much on a par with democracies;  that is, they have manifested such qualities in any considerable  degree only during the temporary ascendancy which great and popular  talents, united with a distinguished position, have given to some one  man. Themistocles and Pericles, Washington and Jefferson, were not  more completely exceptions in their several democracies, and were  assuredly much more splendid exceptions, than the Chathams and Peels  of the representative aristocracy of Great Britain, or even the Sullys  and Colberts of the aristocratic monarchy of France. A great minister,  in the aristocratic governments of modern Europe, is almost as rare a  phenomenon as a great king.    The comparison, therefore, as to the intellectual attributes of a  government has to be made between a representative democracy and a  bureaucracy; all other governments may be left out of the account. And  here it must be acknowledged that a bureaucratic government has, in  some important respects, greatly the advantage. It accumulates  experience, acquires well-tried and well-considered traditional  maxims, and makes provision for appropriate practical knowledge in  those who have the actual conduct of affairs. But it is not equally  favorable to individual energy of mind. The disease which afflicts  bureaucratic governments, and which they usually die of, is routine.  They perish by the immutability of their maxims, and, still more, by  the universal law that whatever becomes a routine loses its vital  principle, and, having no longer a mind acting within it, goes on  revolving mechanically, though the work it is intended to do remains  undone. A bureaucracy always tends to become a pedantocracy. When the  bureaucracy is the real government, the spirit of the corps (as with  the Jesuits) bears down the individuality of its more distinguished  members. In the profession of government, as in other professions, the  sole idea of the majority is to do what they have been taught; and it  requires a popular government to enable the conceptions of the man of  original genius among them to prevail over the obstructive spirit of  trained mediocrity. Only in a popular government (setting apart the  accident of a highly intelligent despot) could Sir Rowland Hill have  been victorious over the Post-office. A popular government installed  him _in_ the Post-office, and made the body, in spite of itself, obey  the impulse given by the man who united special knowledge with  individual vigor and originality. That the Roman aristocracy escaped  this characteristic disease of a bureaucracy was evidently owing to  its popular element. All special offices, both those which gave a seat  in the Senate and those which were sought by senators, were conferred  by popular election. The Russian government is a characteristic  exemplification of both the good and bad side of bureaucracy: its  fixed maxims, directed with Roman perseverance to the same  unflinchingly-pursued ends from age to age; the remarkable skill with  which those ends are generally pursued; the frightful internal  corruption, and the permanent organized hostility to improvements from  without, which even the autocratic power of a vigorous-minded emperor  is seldom or never sufficient to overcome; the patient obstructiveness  of the body being in the long run more than a match for the fitful  energy of one man. The Chinese government, a bureaucracy of Mandarins,  is, as far as known to us, another apparent example of the same  qualities and defects.    In all human affairs, conflicting influences are required to keep one  another alive and efficient even for their own proper uses; and the  exclusive pursuit of one good object, apart from some other which  should accompany it, ends not in excess of one and defect of the  other, but in the decay and loss even of that which has been  exclusively cared for. Government by trained officials can not do for  a country the things which can be done by a free government, but it  might be supposed capable of doing some things which free government  of itself can not do. We find, however, that an outside element of  freedom is necessary to enable it to do effectually or permanently  even its own business. And so, also, freedom can not produce its best  effects, and often breaks down altogether, unless means can be found  of combining it with trained and skilled administration. There could  not be a moment's hesitation between representative government, among  a people in any degree ripe for it, and the most perfect imaginable  bureaucracy. But it is, at the same time, one of the most important  ends of political institutions, to attain as many of the qualities of  the one as are consistent with the other; to secure, as far as they  can be made compatible, the great advantage of the conduct of affairs  by skilled persons, bred to it as an intellectual profession, along  with that of a general control vested in, and seriously exercised by,  bodies representative of the entire people. Much would be done towards  this end by recognizing the line of separation, discussed in the  preceding chapter, between the work of government properly so called,  which can only be well performed after special cultivation, and that  of selecting, watching, and, when needful, controlling the governors,  which in this case, as in all others, properly devolves, not on those  who do the work, but on those for whose benefit it ought to be done.  No progress at all can be made towards obtaining a skilled democracy,  unless the democracy are willing that the work which requires skill  should be done by those who possess it. A democracy has enough to do  in providing itself with an amount of mental competency sufficient for  its own proper work, that of superintendence and check.    How to obtain and secure this amount is one of the questions to taken  into consideration in judging of the proper constitution of a  representative body. In proportion as its composition fails to secure  this amount, the assembly will encroach, by special acts, on the  province of the executive; it will expel a good, or elevate and uphold  a bad ministry; it will connive at, or overlook in them, abuses of  trust, will be deluded by their false pretenses, or will withhold  support from those who endeavour to fulfill their trust  conscientiously; it will countenance or impose a selfish, a capricious  and impulsive, a short-sighted, ignorant, and prejudiced general  policy, foreign and domestic; it will abrogate good laws, or enact bad  ones; let in new evils, or cling with perverse obstinacy to old; it  will even, perhaps, under misleading impulses, momentary or permanent,  emanating from itself or from its constituents, tolerate or connive at  proceedings which set law aside altogether, in cases where equal  justice would not be agreeable to popular feeling. Such are among the  dangers of representative government, arising from a constitution of  the representation which does not secure an adequate amount of  intelligence and knowledge in the representative assembly.    We next proceed to the evils arising from the prevalence of modes of  action in the representative body, dictated by sinister interests (to  employ the useful phrase introduced by Bentham), that is, interests  conflicting more or less with the general good of the community.    It is universally admitted that, of the evils incident to monarchical  and aristocratic governments, a large proportion arise from this  cause. The interest of the monarch, or the interest of the  aristocracy, either collective or that of its individual members, is  promoted, or they themselves think that it will be promoted, by  conduct opposed to that which the general interest of the community  requires. The interest, for example, of the government is to tax  heavily; that of the community is to be as little taxed as the  necessary expenses of good government permit. The interest of the king  and of the governing aristocracy is to possess and exercise unlimited  power over the people; to enforce, on their part, complete conformity  to the will and preferences of the rulers. The interest of the people  is to have as little control exercised over them in any respect as is  consistent with attaining the legitimate ends of government. The  interest, or apparent and supposed interest of the king or  aristocracy, is to permit no censure of themselves, at least in any  form which they may consider either to threaten their power or  seriously to interfere with their free agency. The interest of the  people is that there should be full liberty of censure on every public  officer, and on every public act or measure. The interest of a ruling  class, whether in an aristocracy or an aristocratic monarchy, is to  assume to themselves an endless variety of unjust privileges,  sometimes benefiting their pockets at the expense of the people,  sometimes merely tending to exalt them above others, or, what is the  same thing in different words, to degrade others below themselves. If  the people are disaffected, which under such a government they are  very likely to be, it is the interest of the king or aristocracy to  keep them at a low level of intelligence and education, foment  dissensions among them, and even prevent them from being too well off,  lest they should \"wax fat, and kick,\" agreeably to the maxim of  Cardinal Richelieu in his celebrated \"Testament Politique.\" All these  things are for the interest of a king or aristocracy, in a purely  selfish point of view, unless a sufficiently strong counter-interest  is created by the fear of provoking resistance. All these evils have  been, and many of them still are, produced by the sinister interests  of kings and aristocracies, where their power is sufficient to raise  them above the opinion of the rest of the community; nor is it  rational to expect, as a consequence of such"]]]
