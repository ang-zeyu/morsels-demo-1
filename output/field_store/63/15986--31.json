[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7452"],[0,"Autobiography of a Yogi (#20)"],[1,"I send you and your fellow disciple Jitendra this  morning to the near-by city of Brindaban. You must not take a  single rupee; you must not beg, either for food or money; you must  not reveal your predicament to anyone; you must not go without your  meals; and you must not be stranded in Brindaban. If you return  to my bungalow here before twelve o'clock tonight, without having  broken any rule of the test, I shall be the most astonished man in  Agra!\"    \"I accept the challenge.\" No hesitation was in my words or in  my heart. Grateful memories flashed of the Instant Beneficence:  my healing of deadly cholera through appeal to Lahiri Mahasaya's  picture; the playful gift of the two kites on the Lahore roof with  Uma; the opportune amulet amidst my discouragement; the decisive  message through the unknown Benares SADHU outside the compound of  the pundit's home; the vision of Divine Mother and Her majestic  words of love; Her swift heed through Master Mahasaya to my trifling  embarrassments; the last-minute guidance which materialized my  high school diploma; and the ultimate boon, my living Master from  the mist of lifelong dreams.  Never could I admit my \"philosophy\"  unequal to any tussle on the world's harsh proving ground!    \"Your willingness does you credit. I'll escort you to the train  at once.\" Ananta turned to the openmouthed Jitendra. \"You must go  along as a witness and, very likely, a fellow victim!\"    A half hour later Jitendra and I were in possession of one-way  tickets for our impromptu trip. We submitted, in a secluded corner  of the station, to a search of our persons. Ananta was quickly  satisfied that we were carrying no hidden hoard; our simple DHOTIS  {FN11-3} concealed nothing more than was necessary.    As faith invaded the serious realms of finance, my friend spoke  protestingly. \"Ananta, give me one or two rupees as a safeguard.  Then I can telegraph you in case of misfortune.\"    \"Jitendra!\" My ejaculation was sharply reproachful. \"I will not  proceed with the test if you take any money as final security.\"    \"There is something reassuring about the clink of coins.\" Jitendra  said no more as I regarded him sternly.    \"Mukunda, I am not heartless.\" A hint of humility had crept into  Ananta's voice. It may be that his conscience was smiting him;  perhaps for sending two insolvent boys to a strange city; perhaps  for his own religious skepticism. \"If by any chance or grace you  pass successfully through the Brindaban ordeal, I shall ask you to  initiate me as your disciple.\"    This promise had a certain irregularity, in keeping with the  unconventional occasion. The eldest brother in an Indian family  seldom bows before his juniors; he receives respect and obedience  second only to a father. But no time remained for my comment; our  train was at point of departure.    Jitendra maintained a lugubrious silence as our train covered the  miles. Finally he bestirred himself; leaning over, he pinched me  painfully at an awkward spot.    \"I see no sign that God is going to supply our next meal!\"    \"Be quiet, doubting Thomas; the Lord is working with us.\"    \"Can you also arrange that He hurry? Already I am famished merely  at the prospect before us. I left Benares to view the Taj's mausoleum,  not to enter my own!\"    \"Cheer up, Jitendra! Are we not to have our first glimpse of the  sacred wonders of Brindaban? {FN11-4} I am in deep joy at thought  of treading the ground hallowed by feet of Lord Krishna.\"    The door of our compartment opened; two men seated themselves. The  next train stop would be the last.    \"Young lads, do you have friends in Brindaban?\" The stranger opposite  me was taking a surprising interest.    \"None of your business!\" Rudely I averted my gaze.    \"You are probably flying away from your families under the enchantment  of the Stealer of Hearts. {FN11-5} I am of devotional temperament  myself. I will make it my positive duty to see that you receive  food, and shelter from this overpowering heat.\"    \"No, sir, let us alone. You are very kind; but you are mistaken in  judging us to be truants from home.\"    No further conversation ensued; the train came to a halt. As Jitendra  and I descended to the platform, our chance companions linked arms  with us and summoned a horse cab.    We alit before a stately hermitage, set amidst the evergreen trees  of well-kept grounds. Our benefactors were evidently known here; a  smiling lad led us without comment to a parlor. We were soon joined  by an elderly woman of dignified bearing.    \"Gauri Ma, the princes could not come.\" One of the men addressed  the ashram hostess. \"At the last moment their plans went awry; they  send deep regrets. But we have brought two other guests. As soon  as we met on the train, I felt drawn to them as devotees of Lord  Krishna.\"    [Illustration: (Left to Right) Jitendra Mazumdar, my companion  on the \"penniless test\" at Brindaban; Lalit-da, my cousin; Swami  Kebelananda (\"Shastri Mahasaya\"), my saintly Sanskrit tutor; myself,  as a high school youth--see friends.jpg]    [Illustration: Ananda Moyi Ma, the Bengali \"Joy-Permeated Mother.\"--see  amoyima.jpg]    [Illustration: One of the caves occupied by Babaji in the Drongiri  Mountains near Ranikhet in the Himalayas. A grandson of Lahiri  Mahasaya, Ananda Mohan Lahiri (second from right, in white), and  three other devotees are visiting the sacred spot.--see cave.jpg]    \"Good-by, young friends.\" Our two acquaintances walked to the door.  \"We shall meet again, if God be willing.\"    \"You are welcome here.\" Gauri Ma smiled in motherly fashion on her  two unexpected charges. \"You could not have come on a better day.  I was expecting two royal patrons of this hermitage. What a shame  if my cooking had found none to appreciate it!\"    These appetizing words had disastrous effect on Jitendra: he burst  into tears. The \"prospect\" he had feared in Brindaban was turning  out as royal entertainment; his sudden mental adjustment proved  too much for him. Our hostess looked at him with curiosity, but  without remark; perhaps she was familiar with adolescent quirks.    Lunch was announced; Gauri Ma led the way to a dining patio, spicy  with savory odors. She vanished into an adjoining kitchen.    I had been premeditating this moment. Selecting the appropriate  spot on Jitendra's anatomy, I administered a pinch as resounding  as the one he had given me on the train.    \"Doubting Thomas, the Lord works-in a hurry, too!\"    The hostess reentered with a PUNKHA. She steadily fanned us in the  Oriental fashion as we squatted on ornate blanket-seats. Ashram  disciples passed to and fro with some thirty courses. Rather than  \"meal,\" the description can only be \"sumptuous repast.\" Since  arriving on this planet, Jitendra and I had never before tasted  such delicacies.    \"Dishes fit for princes indeed, Honored Mother! What your royal  patrons could have found more urgent than attending this banquet,  I cannot imagine! You have given us a memory for a lifetime!\"    Silenced as we were by Ananta's requirement, we could not explain  to the gracious lady that our thanks held a double significance.  Our sincerity at least was patent. We departed with her blessing  and an attractive invitation to revisit the hermitage.    The heat outdoors was merciless. My friend and I made for the  shelter of a lordly cadamba tree at the ashram gate. Sharp words  followed; once again Jitendra was beset with misgivings.    \"A fine mess you have got me into! Our luncheon was only accidental  good fortune! How can we see the sights of this city, without a  single pice between us? And how on earth are you going to take me  back to Ananta's?\"    \"You forget God quickly, now that your stomach is filled.\" My words,  not bitter, were accusatory. How short is human memory for divine  favors! No man lives who has not seen certain of his prayers granted.    \"I am not likely to forget my folly in venturing out with a madcap  like you!\"    \"Be quiet, Jitendra! The same Lord who fed us will show us Brindaban,  and return us to Agra.\"    A slight young man of pleasing countenance approached at rapid  pace.  Halting under our tree, he bowed before me.    \"Dear friend, you and your companion must be strangers here. Permit  me to be your host and guide.\"    It is scarcely possible for an Indian to pale, but Jitendra's face  was suddenly sickly. I politely declined the offer.    \"You are surely not banishing me?\" The stranger's alarm would have  been comic in any other circumstances.    \"Why not?\"    \"You are my guru.\" His eyes sought mine trustfully. \"During my  midday devotions, the blessed Lord Krishna appeared in a vision.  He showed me two forsaken figures under this very tree. One face  was yours, my master! Often have I seen it in meditation! What joy  if you accept my humble services!\"    \"I too am glad you have found me. Neither God nor man has forsaken  us!\" Though I was motionless, smiling at the eager face before me,  an inward obeisance cast me at the Divine Feet.    \"Dear friends, will you not honor my home for a visit?\"    \"You are kind; but the plan is unfeasible. Already we are guests  of my brother in Agra.\"    \"At least give me memories of touring Brindaban with you.\"    I gladly consented. The young man, who said his name was Pratap  Chatterji, hailed a horse carriage. We visited Madanamohana Temple  and other Krishna shrines. Night descended while we were at our  temple devotions.    \"Excuse me while I get SANDESH.\" {FN11-6} Pratap entered a shop  near the railroad station. Jitendra and I sauntered along the  wide street, crowded now in the comparative coolness. Our friend  was absent for some time, but finally returned with gifts of many  sweetmeats.    \"Please allow me to gain this religious merit.\" Pratap smiled  pleadingly as he held out a bundle of rupee notes and two tickets,  just purchased, to Agra.    The reverence of my acceptance was for the Invisible Hand.

And when I went out on Fifth Avenue there seemed to be  flowers everywhere. I headed for the Park, and there was the grass all  green, and the trees coming out, and a sort of something in the  air--why, say, if there hadn't have been a big policeman keeping an eye  on me, I'd have flung myself down and bitten chunks out of the turf.    And as soon as I got to Geisenheimer's they played that 'Michigan'  thing.    Why, Charlie from Squeedunk's 'entrance' couldn't have been better  worked up if he'd been a star in a Broadway show. The stage was just  waiting for him.    But somebody's always taking the joy out of life. I ought to have  remembered that the most metropolitan thing in the metropolis is a  rustic who's putting in a week there. We weren't thinking on the same  plane, Charlie and me. The way I had been feeling all day, what I  wanted to talk about was last season's crops. The subject he fancied  was this season's chorus-girls. Our souls didn't touch by a mile and a  half.    'This is the life!' he said.    There's always a point when that sort of man says that.    'I suppose you come here quite a lot?' he said.    'Pretty often.'    I didn't tell him that I came there every night, and that I came  because I was paid for it. If you're a professional dancer at  Geisenheimer's, you aren't supposed to advertise the fact. The  management thinks that if you did it might send the public away  thinking too hard when they saw you win the Great Contest for the  Love-r-ly Silver Cup which they offer later in the evening. Say, that  Love-r-ly Cup's a joke. I win it on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,  and Mabel Francis wins it on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. It's  all perfectly fair and square, of course. It's purely a matter of merit  who wins the Love-r-ly Cup. Anybody could win it. Only somehow they  don't. And the coincidence of the fact that Mabel and I always do has  kind of got on the management's nerves, and they don't like us to tell  people we're employed there. They prefer us to blush unseen.    'It's a great place,' said Mr Ferris, 'and New York's a great place.  I'd like to live in New York.'    'The loss is ours. Why don't you?'    'Some city! But dad's dead now, and I've got the drugstore, you know.'    He spoke as if I ought to remember reading about it in the papers.    'And I'm making good with it, what's more. I've got push and ideas.  Say, I got married since I saw you last.'    'You did, did you?' I said. 'Then what are you doing, may I ask,  dancing on Broadway like a gay bachelor? I suppose you have left your  wife at Hicks' Corners, singing \"Where is my wandering boy tonight\"?'    'Not Hicks' Corners. Ashley, Maine. That's where I live. My wife comes  from Rodney.... Pardon me, I'm afraid I stepped on your foot.'    'My fault,' I said; 'I lost step. Well, I wonder you aren't ashamed  even to think of your wife, when you've left her all alone out there  while you come whooping it up in New York. Haven't you got any  conscience?'    'But I haven't left her. She's here.'    'In New York?'    'In this restaurant. That's her up there.'    I looked up at the balcony. There was a face hanging over the red plush  rail. It looked to me as if it had some hidden sorrow. I'd noticed it  before, when we were dancing around, and I had wondered what the  trouble was. Now I began to see.    'Why aren't you dancing with her and giving her a good time, then?' I  said.    'Oh, she's having a good time.'    'She doesn't look it. She looks as if she would like to be down here,  treading the measure.'    'She doesn't dance much.'    'Don't you have dances at Ashley?'    'It's different at home. She dances well enough for Ashley, but--well,  this isn't Ashley.'    'I see. But you're not like that?'    He gave a kind of smirk.    'Oh, I've been in New York before.'    I could have bitten him, the sawn-off little rube! It made me mad. He  was ashamed to dance in public with his wife--didn't think her good  enough for him. So he had dumped her in a chair, given her a lemonade,  and told her to be good, and then gone off to have a good time. They  could have had me arrested for what I was thinking just then.    The band began to play something else.    'This is the life!' said Mr Ferris. 'Let's do it again.'    'Let somebody else do it,' I said. 'I'm tired. I'll introduce you to  some friends of mine.'    So I took him off, and whisked him on to some girls I knew at one of  the tables.    'Shake hands with my friend Mr Ferris,' I said. 'He wants to show you  the latest steps. He does most of them on your feet.'    I could have betted on Charlie, the Debonair Pride of Ashley. Guess  what he said? He said, 'This is the life!'    And I left him, and went up to the balcony.    She was leaning with her elbows on the red plush, looking down on the  dancing-floor. They had just started another tune, and hubby was moving  around with one of the girls I'd introduced him to. She didn't have to  prove to me that she came from the country. I knew it. She was a little  bit of a thing, old-fashioned looking. She was dressed in grey, with  white muslin collar and cuffs, and her hair done simple. She had a  black hat.    I kind of hovered for awhile. It isn't the best thing I do, being shy;  as a general thing I'm more or less there with the nerve; but somehow I  sort of hesitated to charge in.    Then I braced up, and made for the vacant chair.    'I'll sit here, if you don't mind,' I said.    She turned in a startled way. I could see she was wondering who I was,  and what right I had there, but wasn't certain whether it might not be  city etiquette for strangers to come and dump themselves down and start  chatting. 'I've just been dancing with your husband,' I said, to ease  things along.    'I saw you.'    She fixed me with a pair of big brown eyes. I took one look at them,  and then I had to tell myself that it might be pleasant, and a relief  to my feelings, to take something solid and heavy and drop it over the  rail on to hubby, but the management wouldn't like it. That was how I  felt about him just then. The poor kid was doing everything with those  eyes except crying. She looked like a dog that's been kicked.    She looked away, and fiddled with the string of the electric light.  There was a hatpin lying on the table. She picked it up, and began to  dig at the red plush.    'Ah, come on sis,' I said; 'tell me all about it.'    'I don't know what you mean.'    'You can't fool me. Tell me your troubles.'    'I don't know you.'    'You don't have to know a person to tell her your troubles. I sometimes  tell mine to the cat that camps out on the wall opposite my room. What  did you want to leave the country for, with summer coming on?'    She didn't answer, but I could see it coming, so I sat still and  waited. And presently she seemed to make up her mind that, even if it  was no business of mine, it would be a relief to talk about it.    'We're on our honeymoon. Charlie wanted to come to New York. I didn't  want to, but he was set on it. He's been here before.'    'So he told me.'    'He's wild about New York.'    'But you're not.'    'I hate it.'    'Why?'    She dug away at the red plush with the hatpin, picking out little bits  and dropping them over the edge. I could see she was bracing herself to  put me wise to the whole trouble. There's a time comes when things  aren't going right, and you've had all you can stand, when you have got  to tell somebody about it, no matter who it is.    'I hate New York,' she said getting it out at last with a rush. 'I'm  scared of it. It--it isn't fair Charlie bringing me here. I didn't want  to come. I knew what would happen. I felt it all along.'    'What do you think will happen, then?'    She must have picked away at least an inch of the red plush before she  answered. It's lucky Jimmy, the balcony waiter, didn't see her; it  would have broken his heart; he's as proud of that red plush as if he  had paid for it himself.    'When I first went to live at Rodney,' she said, 'two years ago--we  moved there from Illinois--there was a man there named Tyson--Jack  Tyson. He lived all alone and didn't seem to want to know anyone. I  couldn't understand it till somebody told me all about him. I can  understand it now. Jack Tyson married a Rodney girl, and they came to  New York for their honeymoon, just like us. And when they got there I  guess she got to comparing him with the fellows she saw, and comparing  the city with Rodney, and when she got home she just couldn't settle  down.'    'Well?'    'After they had been back in Rodney for a little while she ran away.  Back to the city, I guess.'    'I suppose he got a divorce?'    'No, he didn't. He still thinks she may come back to him.'    'He still thinks she will come back?' I said. 'After she has been away  three years!'    'Yes. He keeps her things just the same as she left them when she went  away, everything just the same.'    'But isn't he angry with her for what she did? If I was a man and a  girl treated me that way, I'd be apt to murder her if she tried to show  up again.'    'He wouldn't. Nor would I, if--if anything like that happened to me;  I'd wait and wait, and go on hoping all the time. And I'd go down to  the station to meet the train every afternoon, just like Jack Tyson.'    Something splashed on the tablecloth. It made me jump.    'For goodness' sake,' I said, 'what's your trouble? Brace up. I know  it's a sad story, but it's not your funeral.'    'It is. It is. The same thing's going to happen to me.'    'Take a hold on yourself. Don't cry like that.'    'I can't help it. Oh! I knew it would happen. It's happening right now.  Look--look at him.'    I glanced over the rail, and I saw what she meant. There was her  Charlie, dancing about all over the floor as if he had just discovered  that he hadn't lived till then. I saw him say something to the girl he"]]]
