The Ichneumon  is about the size of the domestic cat and of a dark silver grey colour.  The Egyptian Ichneumon much resembles the cat in its habits and manners  and is so deadly a foe to reptiles and vermin, that it is domesticated  with a view to their destruction. It is remarkably quick in its  movements, darting with unerring aim at the head of the reptile it  attacks. It displays also the cat's patience in watching for its prey.  It has a great liking for crocodile's eggs and with remarkable instinct  unearths them from the banks of rivers where they have been deposited.      Dormant Instinct.    Though perfectly tame in captivity, the natural instincts of the  ichneumon are only dormant, as the following illustration will show. M.  d'Obsonville says, in his \"Essay on the Nature of Various Animals\", \"I  had an ichneumon very young, which I brought up. I fed it at first with  milk, and afterwards with baked meat, mixed with rice. It soon became  even tamer than a cat; for it came when called, and followed me, though  at liberty, into the country. One day I brought to him a small water  serpent alive, being desirous to know how far his instinct would carry  him, against a being with which he was hitherto totally unacquainted.  His first emotion seemed to be astonishment, mixed with anger: for his  hair became erect; but in an instant after, he slipped behind the  reptile, and, with remarkable swiftness and agility, leaped upon its  head, seized it, and crushed it between his teeth. This essay, and new  aliment, seemed to have awakened in him his innate and destructive  voracity, which, till then, had given way to the gentleness he had  acquired from his education. I had about my house several curious kinds  of fowls, among which he had been brought up, and which, till then, he  had suffered to go and come unmolested and unregarded; but, a few days  after, when he found himself alone, he strangled them every one, eat a  little, and, as it appeared, drank the blood of two.\"      The Aard Wolf.    The Aard Wolf of South Africa, is the sole genus and species of the  ProtelidA| family. It much resembles the hyA|na in appearance and habit,  and feeds on carrion and white ants.      The HyA|na.    The HyA|na, though long treated as a member of the dog family, is now  separately classified as the HyA|nidA|, a family of one genus and three  species, all of which are found in Africa. The HyA|na is also found in  Egypt, Arabia, Persia and other parts of Asia. He has immensely  powerful teeth with which he can crush the bones of his victims,  apparently eating bones and flesh with impunity. He is nocturnal in his  habits, living in caves and hollows in the day time and prowling about  at night in search of prey. Speaking of the Barbary hyA|na Bruce  says:--\"He seems to be stupid or senseless in the day, or at the  appearance of strong light, unless when pursued by hunters. I have  locked up a goat, a kid, and a lamb, with him all day when he was  fasting, and found them in the evening alive and unhurt.\" The principle  varieties are the striped HyA|na, and the spotted HyA|na. Bruce speaking  of the former says, \"he is brutish, indolent, slovenly and impudent and  seems to possess much the manners of the wolf. His courage appears to  proceed from an insatiable appetite, and has nothing of the brave or  generous in it, and he dies oftener flying than fighting.\" The cry of  the hyA|na, sometimes called a laugh, begins with a moan and ends with a  demoniacal shriek which has been variously described by travellers but  which all agree in calling hideous and disgusting. In size he resembles  a large mastiff, but the formation of his neck and jaws give him a power  far beyond that of other animals of his size. Whatever fear he may have  of man, he has none of other animals and will even face the lion. Bruce  speaks of his special liking for the flesh of the dog and of the dog's  reluctance to face him. \"My greyhounds, accustomed to fasten upon the  wild boar, would not venture to engage with him. On the contrary, there  was not a journey I made that he did not kill several of my greyhounds,  and once or twice robbed me of my whole stock: he would seek and seize  them in the servants' tents where they were tied, and endeavour to carry  them away before the very people that were guarding them.\" His coat is  covered with long coarse hairs of a dirty grey colour, which form a mane  the length of his back, his sides being striped or spotted, according to  the species. The hyA|na for all his repulsiveness serves a useful  purpose, as a scavenger, devouring all the offal which comes in its way,  including the dead of his own species which no other animal will touch.  The hyA|na can be tamed and taught to follow its master and to hunt other  animals.      The Striped HyA|na.    Bruce tells the following story of the impudence of the striped hyA|na.  \"One night in Maitsha, being very intent on observation, I heard  something pass behind me towards the bed, but upon looking round could  perceive nothing. Having finished what I was then about, I went out of  my tent, resolving directly to return, which I immediately did, when I  perceived large blue eyes glaring at me in the dark. I called upon my  servant with a light; and there was the hyA|na standing nigh the head of  the bed, with two or three large bunches of candles in his mouth. To  have fired at him, I was in danger of breaking my quadrant or other  furniture; and he seemed, by keeping the candles steadily in his mouth,  to wish for no other prey at that time. As his mouth was full, and he  had no claws to tear with, I was not afraid of him, but with a pike  struck him as near the heart as I could judge. It was not till then he  showed any sign. of fierceness; but, upon feeling his wound, he let drop  the candles, and endeavoured to run up the shaft of the spear to arrive  at me; so that, in self-defence, I was obliged to draw out a pistol from  my girdle and shoot him, and nearly at the same time my servant cleft  his skull with a battle-axe. In a word, the hyA|na was the plague of our  lives, the terror of our night-walks, the destruction of our mules and  asses, which above all others are his favourite food.\"      The Spotted HyA|na.    The spotted hyA|na belongs to South Africa and seems to possess more  daring than his cousin of Abyssinia, and to show a greater preference  for human food. According to Mr. Stepstone, the Mambookies build their  houses in the form of a beehive from eighteen to twenty feet in  diameter, placing a raised platform at the back and leaving the  front-area for the accommodation of the calves at night. Thus the  animals are nearest to the door, notwithstanding which the hyA|na will  \"pass by the calves and take the children from under the mother's  kaross; and this in such a gentle and cautious manner, that the poor  parent is unconscious of her loss, until the cries of her little  innocent have reached her from without, when it has been a close  prisoner in the jaws of the monster.\" Many years ago, when animals were  kept at the Tower of London, the den of a spotted hyA|na required some  repair. \"The carpenter,\" says Mrs. Bowdich, \"nailed a thick oaken plank  upon the floor, about seven feet long, putting at least a dozen nails  into it, each longer than his middle finger. At one end of this piece of  wood there was a small projection, and not having a proper chisel with  him by which he might remove it, the man returned to his shop to fetch  one. While he was absent some persons came to see the animals, and the  hyA|na was let down by the keeper into the part of the den in which the  carpenter had been at work. Directly the beast saw the projecting piece  of wood he seized it with his teeth, tore the plank up, and drew out  every nail with the utmost ease; which action will give a good idea of  the muscular strength of this creature.\"      A Narrow Escape.    Sparrman tells an amusing story of the daring and the fright of a hyA|na,  as follows: \"One night, at a feast near the Cape, a trumpeter who had  made himself drunk with liquor was carried out of doors and laid on the  grass, in order that the air might both cool and sober him. The scent of  the man soon attracted a spotted hyA|na, which threw him on his back, and  carried him away towards Table Mountain. The hyA|na doubtless supposed  that the senseless drunkard was a _corpse_, and consequently a fair  prize. In the meantime the musician awoke, and was at once sufficiently  sensible to know the danger of his situation, and to sound the alarm  with his trumpet, which he fortunately carried at his side. The hyA|na,  as it may be imagined, was greatly frightened in its turn, and  immediately ran away, leaving the trumpeter, it is to be hoped, 'a wiser  man' for his extraordinary ride. It is remarkable that the soldier was  not seriously injured by the hyA|na, for the teeth of the animal were  fortunately fastened in the coat and not in the flesh of the man.\"      Animals of the Dog Kind.    Animals of the dog kind, are neither so numerous, nor, in general, so  ferocious as those of the panther or cat kind. The principal species are  the wolf, the jackal, the fox, and the dog. This class may be  principally distinguished by their claws, which have no sheath like  those of the cat kind, but are placed at the point of each toe, without  the capability of being stretched forward or drawn back. The nose, as  well as the jaw, of all the dog kind, is longer than in the cat; the  body in proportion more strongly made, and covered with hair instead of  fur. They also far exceed the other kind in the sense of smell, the  olfactory nerves being diffused upon a very extensive membrane within  the skull,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3796"],[0,"Rilla of Ingleside (#20)"],[1,"em!    \"I finished my sixth pair of socks today. With the first three I got  Susan to set the heel for me. Then I thought that was a bit of  shirking, so I learned to do it myself. I hate it--but I have done so  many things I hate since 4th of August that one more or less doesn't  matter. I just think of Jem joking about the mud on Salisbury Plain and  I go at them.\"        CHAPTER XI    DARK AND BRIGHT    At Christmas the college boys and girls came home and for a little  while Ingleside was gay again. But all were not there--for the first  time one was missing from the circle round the Christmas table. Jem, of  the steady lips and fearless eyes, was far away, and Rilla felt that  the sight of his vacant chair was more than she could endure. Susan had  taken a stubborn freak and insisted on setting out Jem's place for him  as usual, with the twisted little napkin ring he had always had since a  boy, and the odd, high Green Gables goblet that Aunt Marilla had once  given him and from which he always insisted on drinking.    \"That blessed boy shall have his place, Mrs. Dr. dear,\" said Susan  firmly, \"and do not you feel over it, for you may be sure he is here in  spirit and next Christmas he will be here in the body. Wait you till  the Big Push comes in the spring and the war will be over in a jiffy.\"    They tried to think so, but a shadow stalked in the background of their  determined merrymaking. Walter, too, was quiet and dull, all through  the holidays. He showed Rilla a cruel, anonymous letter he had received  at Redmond--a letter far more conspicuous for malice than for patriotic  indignation.    \"Nevertheless, all it says is true, Rilla.\"    Rilla had caught it from him and thrown it into the fire.    \"There isn't one word of truth in it,\" she declared hotly. \"Walter,  you've got morbid--as Miss Oliver says she gets when she broods too  long over one thing.\"    \"I can't get away from it at Redmond, Rilla. The whole college is  aflame over the war. A perfectly fit fellow, of military age, who  doesn't join up is looked upon as a shirker and treated accordingly.  Dr. Milne, the English professor, who has always made a special pet of  me, has two sons in khaki; and I can feel the change in his manner  towards me.\"    \"It's not fair--you're not fit.\"    \"Physically I am. Sound as a bell. The unfitness is in the soul and  it's a taint and a disgrace. There, don't cry, Rilla. I'm not going if  that's what you're afraid of. The Piper's music rings in my ears day  and night--but I cannot follow.\"    \"You would break mother's heart and mine if you did,\" sobbed Rilla.  \"Oh, Walter, one is enough for any family.\"    The holidays were an unhappy time for her. Still, having Nan and Di and  Walter and Shirley home helped in the enduring of things. A letter and  book came for her from Kenneth Ford, too; some sentences in the letter  made her cheeks burn and her heart beat--until the last paragraph,  which sent an icy chill over everything.    \"My ankle is about as good as new. I'll be fit to join up in a couple  of months more, Rilla-my-Rilla. It will be some feeling to get into  khaki all right. Little Ken will be able to look the whole world in the  face then and owe not any man. It's been rotten lately, since I've been  able to walk without limping. People who don't know look at me as much  as to say 'Slacker!' Well, they won't have the chance to look it much  longer.\"    \"I hate this war,\" said Rilla bitterly, as she gazed out into the maple  grove that was a chill glory of pink and gold in the winter sunset.    \"Nineteen-fourteen has gone,\" said Dr. Blythe on New Year's Day. \"Its  sun, which rose fairly, has set in blood. What will nineteen-fifteen  bring?\"    \"Victory!\" said Susan, for once laconic.    \"Do you really believe we'll win the war, Susan?\" said Miss Oliver  drearily. She had come over from Lowbridge to spend the day and see  Walter and the girls before they went back to Redmond. She was in a  rather blue and cynical mood and inclined to look on the dark side.    \"'Believe' we'll win the war!\" exclaimed Susan. \"No, Miss Oliver, dear,  I do not believe--I know. That does not worry me. What does worry me is  the trouble and expense of it all. But then you cannot make omelets  without breaking eggs, so we must just trust in God and make big guns.\"    \"Sometimes I think the big guns are better to trust in than God,\" said  Miss Oliver defiantly.    \"No, no, dear, you do not. The Germans had the big guns at the Marne,  had they not? But Providence settled them. Do not ever forget that.  Just hold on to that when you feel inclined to doubt. Clutch hold of  the sides of your chair and sit tight and keep saying, 'Big guns are  good but the Almighty is better, and He is on our side, no matter what  the Kaiser says about it.' I would have gone crazy many a day lately,  Miss Oliver, dear, if I had not sat tight and repeated that to myself.  My cousin Sophia is, like you, somewhat inclined to despond. 'Oh, dear  me, what will we do if the Germans ever get here,' she wailed to me  yesterday. 'Bury them,' said I, just as off-hand as that. 'There is  plenty of room for the graves.' Cousin Sophia said that I was flippant  but I was not flippant, Miss Oliver, dear, only calm and confident in  the British navy and our Canadian boys. I am like old Mr. William  Pollock of the Harbour Head. He is very old and has been ill for a long  time, and one night last week he was so low that his daughter-in-law  whispered to some one that she thought he was dead. 'Darn it, I ain't,'  he called right out--only, Miss Oliver, dear, he did not use so mild a  word as 'darn'--'darn it, I ain't, and I don't mean to die until the  Kaiser is well licked.' Now, that, Miss Oliver, dear,\" concluded Susan,  \"is the kind of spirit I admire.\"    \"I admire it but I can't emulate it,\" sighed Gertrude. \"Before this, I  have always been able to escape from the hard things of life for a  little while by going into dreamland, and coming back like a giant  refreshed. But I can't escape from this.\"    \"Nor I,\" said Mrs. Blythe. \"I hate going to bed now. All my life I've  liked going to bed, to have a gay, mad, splendid half-hour of imagining  things before sleeping. Now I imagine them still. But such different  things.\"    \"I am rather glad when the time comes to go to bed,\" said Miss Oliver.  \"I like the darkness because I can be myself in it--I needn't smile or  talk bravely. But sometimes my imagination gets out of hand, too, and I  see what you do--terrible things--terrible years to come.\"    \"I am very thankful that I never had any imagination to speak of,\" said  Susan. \"I have been spared that. I see by this paper that the Crown  Prince is killed again. Do you suppose there is any hope of his staying  dead this time? And I also see that Woodrow Wilson is going to write  another note. I wonder,\" concluded Susan, with the bitter irony she had  of late begun to use when referring to the poor President, \"if that  man's schoolmaster is alive.\"    In January Jims was five months old and Rilla celebrated the  anniversary by shortening him.    \"He weighs fourteen pounds,\" she announced jubilantly. \"Just exactly  what he should weigh at five months, according to Morgan.\"    There was no longer any doubt in anybody's mind that Jims was getting  positively pretty. His little cheeks were round and firm and faintly  pink, his eyes were big and bright, his tiny paws had dimples at the  root of every finger. He had even begun to grow hair, much to Rilla's  unspoken relief. There was a pale golden fuzz all over his head that  was distinctly visible in some lights. He was a good infant, generally  sleeping and digesting as Morgan decreed. Occasionally he smiled but he  had never laughed, in spite of all efforts to make him. This worried  Rilla also, because Morgan said that babies usually laughed aloud from  the third to the fifth month. Jims was five months and had no notion of  laughing. Why hadn't he? Wasn't he normal?    One night Rilla came home late from a recruiting meeting at the Glen  where she had been giving patriotic recitations. Rilla had never been  willing to recite in public before. She was afraid of her tendency to  lisp, which had a habit of reviving if she were doing anything that  made her nervous. When she had first been asked to recite at the Upper  Glen meeting she had refused. Then she began to worry over her refusal.  Was it cowardly? What would Jem think if he knew? After two days of  worry Rilla phoned to the president of the Patriotic Society that she  would recite. She did, and lisped several times, and lay awake most of  the night in an agony of wounded vanity. Then two nights after she  recited again at Harbour Head. She had been at Lowbridge and  over-harbour since then and had become resigned to an occasional lisp.  Nobody except herself seemed to mind it. And she was so earnest and  appealing and shining-eyed! More than one recruit joined up because  Rilla's eyes seemed to look right at him when she passionately demanded  how could men die better than fighting for the ashes of their fathers  and the temples of their gods, or assured her audience with thrilling  intensity that one crowded hour of glorious life was worth an age  without a name. Even stolid Miller Douglas was so fired one night that  it took Mary Vance a good hour to talk him back to sense. Mary Vance  said bitterly that if Rilla Blythe felt as bad as she had pretended to  feel over Jem's going to the front she wouldn't be urging other girls'  brothers and friends to go.    On this particular night Rilla was tired and cold and very thankful to  creep into her warm nest and cuddle down between her blankets, though  as usual with a sorrowful wonder how Jem and Jerry were faring. She was  just getting warm and drowsy when Jims suddenly began to cry--and kept  on crying.    Rilla curled herself up in her bed and determined she would let him  cry. She had Morgan"]]]
