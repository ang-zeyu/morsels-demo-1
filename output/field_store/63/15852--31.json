With  Victor Emmanuel King of Northern and Southern Italy, the rest is simple.  Then Italy can afford to wait its opportunity for driving the Austrians  from Venezia, and becoming, for the first time since the days of the  Romans, a united kingdom. When I hoist my banner in Sicily, it will be  as a soldier of Victor Emmanuel, King of Italy.\"    Frank was pleased to hear this. His father, though an advanced liberal  in matters connected with Italy, was a strong conservative at home; and  Frank had naturally imbibed his ideas, which were that the people of a  constitutional monarchy, like that under which he lived, were in every  respect freer and better governed than under any republic, still more so  than they could be under a republic constituted according to the  theories of Mazzini or those of the authors of the first and second  French revolutions.    \"By the way, you must have found it a terrible responsibility carrying  so much money with you.\"    \"I did not carry it, general. The bills were, with the letter to you,  sent by post to the care of the Countess of Mongolfiere, who was a  friend of Signora Forli.\"    \"That was hazardous, too,\" the general said, shaking his head. \"To trust  ten thousand pounds to the post was a terrible risk.\"    \"It was the best way that we could think of, general. The courier who  was with my father when he was killed came over to see my mother at her  request, as she wished to hear every detail about my father's last days.  He professed a great fear of returning to Italy, as, having given  evidence against the brigands, he would be a marked man.\"    \"There is no doubt that is so,\" Garibaldi put in. \"His life would not  have been worth a day's purchase. These scoundrels have their agents in  every town, men who keep them informed as to persons travelling, whom it  would be worth while to capture, and of any movements of the carabinieri  in their direction.\"    \"My mother, therefore, took him into her service,\" Frank went on; \"but  two days before I started, she discovered that he had been acting as a  spy, had been opening her desk, examining her letters, and listening at  the door. She and Signora Forli had no doubt whatever that he had made  himself acquainted with the contents of your letter, and believed that I  was going to carry this money to you.\"    \"The villains!\" Garibaldi exclaimed, bringing his clenched hand down  upon the table: \"it is just what they would do. I know that many of my  friends enjoyed your father's hospitality; and no doubt it would be a  marked house, and the secret police of Francisco would keep an eye over  what was being done there, and would, if possible, get one of their  agents into it. This man, who had no doubt acted as a spy over your  father when he was in Italy, would be naturally chosen for the work; and  his story and pretence of fear served admirably to get him installed  there. If he had learned that you were about to start to bring me ten  thousand pounds, and perhaps papers of importance, it would have been  nothing short of a miracle had you arrived safely with them.\"    \"That was what Signora Forli and my mother thought, sir. They were  afraid to send the letter directed to me at the hotel where I was to  stop, as the man would doubtless telegraph to agents out at Genoa, and  they would get possession of it; so instead of doing so, they enclosed  it in a letter to the countess. I posted it myself, and there was  therefore no chance of the letter being lost, except by pure accident.\"    \"But if the spy did not know that you had sent the letter off by post,  it would render your journey no less hazardous than if you had taken it  with you.\"    \"My mother and the Signora were both convinced that an attempt would be  made to search me and my baggage on the way, but they did not think that  they would try to take my life; for after what had happened to my  grandfather and father, there would be no question that my murder was  the work of Neapolitan agents, and a storm of indignation would thus be  caused.\"    Garibaldi nodded. \"No doubt they were right, and if the scoundrels could  have got possession of what you carried without injury to you they would  have done so. But they would have stuck at nothing in order to carry out  their object; and had you caught them while they were engaged in  searching your clothes or baggage, they would not have hesitated to use  their knives. I cannot now understand how you have come through without  their having meddled with you. It might have been done when you were  asleep in an hotel, or they might have drugged you in a railway  carriage, or in your cabin on board the steamer coming here. The secret  police of Naples is the only well-organised department in the kingdom.  They have agents in London, Paris, and other cities, and from the moment  you left your mother's house you must have been watched. Are you sure  that, although you may not know it, you have not been searched?\"    \"I am quite sure, sir. We were so certain I should be watched that I  made no attempt to get off secretly, but started by the train I had  intended to travel by. I did not stop a night at an hotel all the way,  and made a point of getting into railway carriages that contained other  passengers. It happened, however, that at Vienne the last of those with  me alighted. It was one o'clock in the morning when we left the station,  and I felt sure that if an attempt was made, it would be before we  stopped, especially as a man looked into the carriage just before we  were starting, and then went away. I had a loaded pistol in each pocket  and a rug over me, and I sat in the corner pretending to be asleep. An  hour later a man came and looked in; another joined him. The door was  partly opened, and an arm with an extended pistol pointed at me, but I  felt perfectly sure that he had no intention of firing unless I woke.    \"Half a minute later his comrade entered the carriage. He had an open  knife in one hand, and a cloth in the other; but as he came in I shot  him; he fell back through the carriage door. Whether in doing so he  knocked his comrade down or not, I cannot say; but, at any rate, I saw  no more of him. The man whom I shot had dropped what he held in his hand  on to the floor. It was as I had expected--a handkerchief, soaked with  chloroform. It was seven when I arrived at Marseilles. Fortunately, a  steamer left at twelve. When I went on board I made the acquaintance of  three young men, who were, I guessed, on the same errand as myself;  their names were Rubini, Sarto, and Maffio. We soon became very  friendly, and I found that my conjectures were correct. This being so, I  told them what had happened; and as there was no one besides myself in  my cabin, Rubini most kindly laid a mattress across the door and slept  there. As I had not had a wink of sleep the night before, and only dozed  a little the one before that, I should have had great difficulty in  keeping awake. In the course of the night some one did attempt to open  the door; but he was unable to do so on account of the mattress placed  there, and we heard no more of him. I asked these gentlemen to come to  the Hotel Europa at eleven, for I was really afraid to come along the  road here by myself. They drove with me to the house of the countess,  and then here, so that I was well guarded.\"    \"I know them all well,\" Garibaldi said. \"Rubini is a lieutenant in the  Genoese company of my cacciatori; the others are in his company. You  have done well indeed, my friend; it needed courage to start on such a  journey, knowing that Francisco's police were on your track. You have a  right to feel proud that your vigilance and quickness defeated their  attempt. It is well that you met Rubini and his friends; for as the  spies would know directly you entered the palazzo of the countess that  you had gone there for some special purpose, probably to obtain  documents sent to her, I doubt whether you would have been able to come  safely alone, even if the road had been fairly well thronged.\"    \"I should not have gone to the countess's unless I had an escort,  general. My intention was to come to you in the first place, and ask  that three of your officers might accompany me to get the letter; but,  of course, after having found friends who would act as my escort, there  was no occasion to do so. I suppose there is no fear of my being further  annoyed?\"    \"I should think not,\" Garibaldi said; \"now they know that your mission  has been carried out, you will cease to be of interest to them. But at  the same time, it would be well to be cautious. If the fellow you shot  was the leader of those charged to prevent the supplies and letter  coming to me, we may consider that there is an end of the affair. His  death will give a step to some one, and they will owe you no ill will.  If, however, the other man was the chief of the party, he would  doubtless owe you a grudge. He is sure to be blamed for having been thus  baffled by a lad; whereas had he succeeded, he would have received the  approval of his superiors. I think, therefore, if I were you, I should  abstain from going out after nightfall, unless with a companion, or if  you do so, keep in the great thoroughfares and avoid quiet streets. That  habit of carrying a loaded pistol in your pocket has proved a valuable  one, and I should advise you to continue it so long as you are here. If  you see Rubini, tell him that I thank him for the aid he and his friends  rendered you. He and the others have all been instructed not to come  here until they receive a communication that the time for action has  arrived. My followers send me their addresses as soon as they reach  Genoa, so that I can summon them when they "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4558"],[0,"Barry Lyndon (#20)"],[1," shame. Letters were written back from Berlin to  say that such a family existed in the kingdom, but that the person  representing himself to belong to it must be an impostor, for  every officer of the name was at his regiment and his post. It was  Galgenstein's death-warrant, and he was hanged as a spy in Strasburg.     'Turn him into the cart with the rest,' said he, as soon as I awoke  from my trance.          CHAPTER VI. THE CRIMP WAGGON--MILITARY EPISODES    The covered waggon to which I was ordered to march was standing, as I  have said, in the courtyard of the farm, with another dismal vehicle  of the same kind hard by it. Each was pretty well filled with a crew of  men, whom the atrocious crimp who had seized upon me, had enlisted under  the banners of the glorious Frederick; and I could see by the lanterns  of the sentinels, as they thrust me into the straw, a dozen dark figures  huddled together in the horrible moving prison where I was now to be  confined. A scream and a curse from my opposite neighbour showed me that  he was most likely wounded, as I myself was; and, during the whole of  the wretched night, the moans and sobs of the poor fellows in similar  captivity kept up a continual painful chorus, which effectually  prevented my getting any relief from my ills in sleep. At midnight  (as far as I could judge) the horses were put to the waggons, and the  creaking lumbering machines were put in motion. A couple of soldiers,  strongly armed, sat on the outer bench of the cart, and their grim faces  peered in with their lanterns every now and then through the canvas  curtains, that they might count the number of their prisoners. The  brutes were half-drunk, and were singing love and war songs, such as 'O  Gretchen mein Taubchen, mein Herzenstrompet, Mein Kanon, mein Heerpauk  und meine Musket,' 'Prinz Eugen der edle Ritter.' and the like; their  wild whoops and jodels making doleful discord with the groans of us  captives within the waggons. Many a time afterwards have I heard these  ditties sung on the march, or in the barrack-room, or round the fires as  we lay out at night.    I was not near so unhappy, in spite of all, as I had been on my first  enlisting in Ireland. At least, thought I, if I am degraded to be a  private soldier there will be no one of my acquaintance who will witness  my shame; and that is the point which I have always cared for most.  There will be no one to say, 'There is young Redmond Barry, the  descendant or the Barrys, the fashionable young blood of Dublin,  pipeclaying his belt and carrying his brown Bess.' Indeed, but for  that opinion of the world, with which it is necessary that every man of  spirit should keep upon equal terms, I, for my part, would have always  been contented with the humblest portion. Now here, to all intents  and purposes, one was as far removed from the world as in the wilds  of Siberia, or in Robinson Crusoe's Island. And I reasoned with myself  thus:--'Now you are caught, there is no use in repining: make the best  of your situation, and get all the pleasure you can out of it. There  are a thousand opportunities of plunder, &c., offered to the soldier in  war-time, out of which he can get both pleasure and profit: make use of  these, and be happy. Besides, you are extraordinarily brave, handsome,  and clever: and who knows but you may procure advancement in your new  service?'    In this philosophical way I looked at my misfortunes, determining not  to be cast down by them; and bore woes and my broken head with perfect  magnanimity. The latter was, for the moment, an evil against which it  required no small powers of endurance to contend; for the jolts of the  waggon were dreadful, and every shake caused a throb in my brain which I  thought would have split my skull. As the morning dawned, I saw that the  man next me, a gaunt yellow-haired creature, in black, had a cushion of  straw under his head.    'Are you wounded, comrade?' said I.    'Praised be the Lord,' said he, 'I am sore hurt in spirit and body,  and bruised in many members; wounded, however, am I not. And you, poor  youth?'    'I am wounded in the head,' said I, 'and I want your pillow: give  it me--I've a clasp-knife in my pocket!' and with this I gave him a  terrible look, meaning to say (and mean it I did, for look you, A LA  GUERRE C'EST A LA GUERRE, and I am none of your milksops) that, unless  he yielded me the accommodation, I would give him a taste of my steel.    'I would give it thee without any threat, friend,' said the  yellow-haired man meekly, and handed me over his little sack of straw.    He then leaned himself back as comfortably as he could against the  cart, and began repeating, 'Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott,' by which I  concluded that I had got into the company of a parson. With the jolts of  the waggon, and accidents of the journey, various more exclamations and  movements of the passengers showed what a motley company we were. Every  now and then a countryman would burst into tears; a French voice would  be heard to say, 'O mon Dieu!--mon Dieu!' a couple more of the same  nation were jabbering oaths and chattering incessantly; and a certain  allusion to his own and everybody else's eyes, which came from a  stalwart figure at the far corner, told me that there was certainly an  Englishman in our crew.    But I was spared soon the tedium and discomforts of the journey. In  spite of the clergyman's cushion, my head, which was throbbing with  pain, was brought abruptly in contact with the side of the waggon; it  began to bleed afresh: I became almost light-headed. I only recollect  having a draught of water here and there; once stopping at a fortified  town, where an officer counted us:--all the rest of the journey was  passed in a drowsy stupor, from which, when I awoke, I found myself  lying in a hospital bed, with a nun in a white hood watching over me.    'They are in sad spiritual darkness,' said a voice from the bed next to  me, when the nun had finished her kind offices and retired: 'they are  in the night of error, and yet there is the light of faith in those poor  creatures.'    It was my comrade of the crimp waggon, his huge broad face looming out  from under a white nightcap, and ensconced in the bed beside.    'What! you there, Herr Pastor?' said I.    'Only a candidate, sir,' answered the white nightcap. 'But, praised be  Heaven! you have come to. You have had a wild time of it. You have been  talking in the English language (with which I am acquainted) of Ireland,  and a young lady, and Mick, and of another young lady, and of a house on  fire, and of the British Grenadiers, concerning whom you sung us parts  of a ballad, and of a number of other matters appertaining, no doubt, to  your personal history.'    'It has been a very strange one,' said I; 'and, perhaps, there is no man  in the world, of my birth, whose misfortunes can at all be compared to  mine.'    I do not object to own that I am disposed to brag of my birth and  other acquirements; for I have always found that if a man does not give  himself a good word, his friends will not do it for him.    'Well,' said my fellow-patient, 'I have no doubt yours is a strange  tale, and shall be glad to hear it anon; but at present you must not  be permitted to speak much, for your fever has been long, and your  exhaustion great.'    'Where are we?' I asked; and the candidate informed me that we were in  the bishopric and town of Fulda, at present occupied by Prince Henry's  troops. There had been a skirmish with an out-party of French near the  town, in which a shot entering the waggon, the poor candidate had been  wounded.    As the reader knows already my history, I will not take the trouble  to repeat it here, or to give the additions with which I favoured  my comrade in misfortune. But I confess that I told him ours was the  greatest family and finest palace in Ireland, that we were enormously  wealthy, related to all the peerage descended from the ancient kings,  &c.; and, to my surprise, in the course of our conversation, I found  that my interlocutor knew a great deal more about Ireland than I did.  When, for instance, I spoke of my descent,--    'From which race of kings?' said he.    'Oh!' said I (for my memory for dates was never very accurate), 'from  the old ancient kings of all.'    'What! can you trace your origin to the sons Japhet?' said he.    ''Faith, I can,' answered I, 'and farther too,--Nebuchadnezzar, if you  like.'    'I see,' said the candidate, smiling, 'that you look upon those legends  with incredulity. These Partholans and Nemedians, of whom your writers  fondly make mention, cannot be authentically vouched for in history. Nor  do I believe that we have any more foundation for the tales concerning  them, than for the legends relative to Joseph of Arimathea and King  Bruce which prevailed two centuries back in the sister island.    And then he began a discourse about the Phoenicians, the Scyths or  Goths, the Tuath de Danans, Tacitus, and King MacNeil; which was, to say  the truth, the very first news I had heard of those personages. As for  English, he spoke it as well as I, and had seven more languages, he  said, equally at his command; for, on my quoting the only Latin line  that I knew, that out of the poet Homer, which says,--       'As in praesenti perfectum fumat in avi,'    he began to speak to me in the Roman tongue; on which I was fain to tell  him that we pronounced it in a different way in Ireland, and so got off  the conversation.    My honest friend's history was a curious one, and it may be told here in  order to show of what motley materials our levies were composed:--    'I am,' said he, 'a Saxon by birth, my father being pastor of the  village of Pfannkuchen, where I imbibed the first rudiments of  knowledge. At sixteen (I am now twenty-three), having mastered the Greek  and Latin tongues, with the French, English, Arabic, and Hebrew; and  having"]]]
