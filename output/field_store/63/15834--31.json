It is especially  the sight of those hotch-potch philosophers, who call themselves  \"realists,\" or \"positivists,\" which is calculated to implant a  dangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those  philosophers, at the best, are themselves but scholars and specialists,  that is very evident! All of them are persons who have been vanquished  and BROUGHT BACK AGAIN under the dominion of science, who at one time  or another claimed more from themselves, without having a right to the  \"more\" and its responsibility--and who now, creditably, rancorously, and  vindictively, represent in word and deed, DISBELIEF in the master-task  and supremacy of philosophy After all, how could it be otherwise?  Science flourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visible  on its countenance, while that to which the entire modern philosophy has  gradually sunk, the remnant of philosophy of the present day, excites  distrust and displeasure, if not scorn and pity Philosophy reduced to  a \"theory of knowledge,\" no more in fact than a diffident science of  epochs and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even  gets beyond the threshold, and rigorously DENIES itself the right  to enter--that is philosophy in its last throes, an end, an agony,  something that awakens pity. How could such a philosophy--RULE!    205. The dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are, in  fact, so manifold nowadays, that one might doubt whether this fruit  could still come to maturity. The extent and towering structure of the  sciences have increased enormously, and therewith also the probability  that the philosopher will grow tired even as a learner, or will attach  himself somewhere and \"specialize\" so that he will no longer attain to  his elevation, that is to say, to his superspection, his circumspection,  and his DESPECTION. Or he gets aloft too late, when the best of his  maturity and strength is past, or when he is impaired, coarsened, and  deteriorated, so that his view, his general estimate of things, is no  longer of much importance. It is perhaps just the refinement of his  intellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on the  way, he dreads the temptation to become a dilettante, a millepede, a  milleantenna, he knows too well that as a discerner, one who has lost  his self-respect no longer commands, no longer LEADS, unless he should  aspire to become a great play-actor, a philosophical Cagliostro and  spiritual rat-catcher--in short, a misleader. This is in the last  instance a question of taste, if it has not really been a question of  conscience. To double once more the philosopher's difficulties, there is  also the fact that he demands from himself a verdict, a Yea or Nay, not  concerning science, but concerning life and the worth of life--he learns  unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain  this verdict, and he has to seek his way to the right and the belief  only through the most extensive (perhaps disturbing and destroying)  experiences, often hesitating, doubting, and dumbfounded. In fact, the  philosopher has long been mistaken and confused by the multitude, either  with the scientific man and ideal scholar, or with the religiously  elevated, desensualized, desecularized visionary and God-intoxicated  man; and even yet when one hears anybody praised, because he lives  \"wisely,\" or \"as a philosopher,\" it hardly means anything more than  \"prudently and apart.\" Wisdom: that seems to the populace to be a kind  of flight, a means and artifice for withdrawing successfully from a  bad game; but the GENUINE philosopher--does it not seem so to US,  my friends?--lives \"unphilosophically\" and \"unwisely,\" above all,  IMPRUDENTLY, and feels the obligation and burden of a hundred attempts  and temptations of life--he risks HIMSELF constantly, he plays THIS bad  game.    206. In relation to the genius, that is to say, a being who either  ENGENDERS or PRODUCES--both words understood in their fullest sense--the  man of learning, the scientific average man, has always something of  the old maid about him; for, like her, he is not conversant with the two  principal functions of man. To both, of course, to the scholar and  to the old maid, one concedes respectability, as if by way of  indemnification--in these cases one emphasizes the respectability--and  yet, in the compulsion of this concession, one has the same admixture  of vexation. Let us examine more closely: what is the scientific man?  Firstly, a commonplace type of man, with commonplace virtues: that is  to say, a non-ruling, non-authoritative, and non-self-sufficient type  of man; he possesses industry, patient adaptableness to rank and file,  equability and moderation in capacity and requirement; he has the  instinct for people like himself, and for that which they require--for  instance: the portion of independence and green meadow without which  there is no rest from labour, the claim to honour and consideration  (which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability),  the sunshine of a good name, the perpetual ratification of his value and  usefulness, with which the inward DISTRUST which lies at the bottom of  the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals, has again and  again to be overcome. The learned man, as is appropriate, has also  maladies and faults of an ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy, and  has a lynx-eye for the weak points in those natures to whose elevations  he cannot attain. He is confiding, yet only as one who lets himself go,  but does not FLOW; and precisely before the man of the great current he  stands all the colder and more reserved--his eye is then like a smooth  and irresponsive lake, which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy.  The worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable results  from the instinct of mediocrity of his type, from the Jesuitism of  mediocrity, which labours instinctively for the destruction of  the exceptional man, and endeavours to break--or still better, to  relax--every bent bow To relax, of course, with consideration, and  naturally with an indulgent hand--to RELAX with confiding sympathy  that is the real art of Jesuitism, which has always understood how to  introduce itself as the religion of sympathy.    207. However gratefully one may welcome the OBJECTIVE spirit--and  who has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confounded  IPSISIMOSITY!--in the end, however, one must learn caution even with  regard to one's gratitude, and put a stop to the exaggeration with  which the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently been  celebrated, as if it were the goal in itself, as if it were salvation  and glorification--as is especially accustomed to happen in the  pessimist school, which has also in its turn good reasons for paying the  highest honours to \"disinterested knowledge\" The objective man, who no  longer curses and scolds like the pessimist, the IDEAL man of learning  in whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousand  complete and partial failures, is assuredly one of the most costly  instruments that exist, but his place is in the hand of one who is more  powerful He is only an instrument, we may say, he is a MIRROR--he is no  \"purpose in himself\" The objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed  to prostration before everything that wants to be known, with such  desires only as knowing or \"reflecting\" implies--he waits until  something comes, and then expands himself sensitively, so that even the  light footsteps and gliding-past of spiritual beings may not be lost on  his surface and film Whatever \"personality\" he still possesses seems to  him accidental, arbitrary, or still oftener, disturbing, so much has he  come to regard himself as the passage and reflection of outside forms  and events He calls up the recollection of \"himself\" with an effort,  and not infrequently wrongly, he readily confounds himself with other  persons, he makes mistakes with regard to his own needs, and here only  is he unrefined and negligent Perhaps he is troubled about the health,  or the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend, or the lack  of companions and society--indeed, he sets himself to reflect on his  suffering, but in vain! His thoughts already rove away to the MORE  GENERAL case, and tomorrow he knows as little as he knew yesterday how  to help himself He does not now take himself seriously and devote time  to himself he is serene, NOT from lack of trouble, but from lack  of capacity for grasping and dealing with HIS trouble The habitual  complaisance with respect to all objects and experiences, the radiant  and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that  comes his way, his habit of inconsiderate good-nature, of dangerous  indifference as to Yea and Nay: alas! there are enough of cases in which  he has to atone for these virtues of his!--and as man generally, he  becomes far too easily the CAPUT MORTUUM of such virtues. Should one  wish love or hatred from him--I mean love and hatred as God, woman, and  animal understand them--he will do what he can, and furnish what he can.  But one must not be surprised if it should not be much--if he should  show himself just at this point to be false, fragile, questionable, and  deteriorated. His love is constrained, his hatred is artificial, and  rather UN TOUR DE FORCE, a slight ostentation and exaggeration. He is  only genuine so far as he can be objective; only in his serene totality  is he still \"nature\" and \"natural.\" His mirroring and eternally  self-polishing soul no longer knows how to affirm, no longer how to  deny; he does not command; neither does he destroy. \"JE NE MEPRISE  PRESQUE RIEN\"--he says, with Leibniz: let us not overlook nor undervalue  the PRESQUE! Neither is he a model man; he does not go in advance of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4367"],[0,"Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Complete (#20)"],[1,"quarters in Tacubaya. The  engagement did not last many minutes, but the killed and wounded were  numerous for the number of troops engaged.    During the night of the 11th batteries were established which could play  upon the fortifications of Chapultepec.  The bombardment commenced early  on the morning of the 12th, but there was no further engagement during  this day than that of the artillery.  General Scott assigned the capture  of Chapultepec to General Pillow, but did not leave the details to his  judgment. Two assaulting columns, two hundred and fifty men each,  composed of volunteers for the occasion, were formed.  They were  commanded by Captains McKinzie and Casey respectively.  The assault was  successful, but bloody.    In later years, if not at the time, the battles of Molino del Rey and  Chapultepec have seemed to me to have been wholly unnecessary.  When the  assaults upon the garitas of San Cosme and Belen were determined upon,  the road running east to the former gate could have been reached easily,  without an engagement, by moving along south of the Mills until west of  them sufficiently far to be out of range, thence north to the road above  mentioned; or, if desirable to keep the two attacking columns nearer  together, the troops could have been turned east so as to come on the  aqueduct road out of range of the guns from Chapultepec.  In like  manner, the troops designated to act against Belen could have kept east  of Chapultepec, out of range, and come on to the aqueduct, also out of  range of Chapultepec. Molino del Rey and Chapultepec would both have  been necessarily evacuated if this course had been pursued, for they  would have been turned.    General Quitman, a volunteer from the State of Mississippi, who stood  well with the army both as a soldier and as a man, commanded the column  acting against Belen.  General Worth commanded the column against San  Cosme.  When Chapultepec fell the advance commenced along the two  aqueduct roads.  I was on the road to San Cosme, and witnessed most that  took place on that route.  When opposition was encountered our troops  sheltered themselves by keeping under the arches supporting the  aqueduct, advancing an arch at a time.  We encountered no serious  obstruction until within gun-shot of the point where the road we were on  intersects that running east to the city, the point where the aqueduct  turns at a right angle.  I have described the defences of this position  before.  There were but three commissioned officers besides myself, that  I can now call to mind, with the advance when the above position was  reached. One of these officers was a Lieutenant Semmes, of the Marine  Corps.  I think Captain Gore, and Lieutenant Judah, of the 4th infantry,  were the others.  Our progress was stopped for the time by the single  piece of artillery at the angle of the roads and the infantry occupying  the house-tops back from it.    West of the road from where we were, stood a house occupying the  south-west angle made by the San Cosme road and the road we were moving  upon. A stone wall ran from the house along each of these roads for a  considerable distance and thence back until it joined, enclosing quite a  yard about the house.  I watched my opportunity and skipped across the  road and behind the south wall.  Proceeding cautiously to the west  corner of the enclosure, I peeped around and seeing nobody, continued,  still cautiously, until the road running east and west was reached.  I  then returned to the troops, and called for volunteers.  All that were  close to me, or that heard me, about a dozen, offered their services.  Commanding them to carry their arms at a trail, I watched our  opportunity and got them across the road and under cover of the wall  beyond, before the enemy had a shot at us. Our men under cover of the  arches kept a close watch on the intrenchments that crossed our path and  the house-tops beyond, and whenever a head showed itself above the  parapets they would fire at it.  Our crossing was thus made practicable  without loss.    When we reached a safe position I instructed my little command again to  carry their arms at a trail, not to fire at the enemy until they were  ordered, and to move very cautiously following me until the San Cosme  road was reached; we would then be on the flank of the men serving the  gun on the road, and with no obstruction between us and them.  When we  reached the south-west corner of the enclosure before described, I saw  some United States troops pushing north through a shallow ditch near by,  who had come up since my reconnaissance.  This was the company of  Captain Horace Brooks, of the artillery, acting as infantry.  I  explained to Brooks briefly what I had discovered and what I was about  to do.  He said, as I knew the ground and he did not, I might go on and  he would follow.  As soon as we got on the road leading to the city the  troops serving the gun on the parapet retreated, and those on the  house-tops near by followed; our men went after them in such close  pursuit--the troops we had left under the arches joining--that a second  line across the road, about half-way between the first and the garita,  was carried. No reinforcements had yet come up except Brooks's company,  and the position we had taken was too advanced to be held by so small a  force.  It was given up, but retaken later in the day, with some loss.    Worth's command gradually advanced to the front now open to it.  Later  in the day in reconnoitring I found a church off to the south of the  road, which looked to me as if the belfry would command the ground back  of the garita San Cosme.  I got an officer of the voltigeurs, with a  mountain howitzer and men to work it, to go with me.  The road being in  possession of the enemy, we had to take the field to the south to reach  the church.  This took us over several ditches breast deep in water and  grown up with water plants.  These ditches, however, were not over eight  or ten feet in width.  The howitzer was taken to pieces and carried by  the men to its destination.  When I knocked for admission a priest came  to the door who, while extremely polite, declined to admit us.  With the  little Spanish then at my command, I explained to him that he might save  property by opening the door, and he certainly would save himself from  becoming a prisoner, for a time at least; and besides, I intended to go  in whether he consented or not.  He began to see his duty in the same  light that I did, and opened the door, though he did not look as if it  gave him special pleasure to do so.  The gun was carried to the belfry  and put together.  We were not more than two or three hundred yards from  San Cosme.  The shots from our little gun dropped in upon the enemy and  created great confusion.  Why they did not send out a small party and  capture us, I do not know.  We had no infantry or other defences besides  our one gun.    The effect of this gun upon the troops about the gate of the city was so  marked that General Worth saw it from his position. (*3) He was so  pleased that he sent a staff officer, Lieutenant Pemberton--later  Lieutenant-General commanding the defences of Vicksburg--to bring me to  him.  He expressed his gratification at the services the howitzer in the  church steeple was doing, saying that every shot was effective, and  ordered a captain of voltigeurs to report to me with another howitzer to  be placed along with the one already rendering so much service.  I could  not tell the General that there was not room enough in the steeple for  another gun, because he probably would have looked upon such a statement  as a contradiction from a second lieutenant.  I took the captain with  me, but did not use his gun.    The night of the 13th of September was spent by the troops under General  Worth in the houses near San Cosme, and in line confronting the general  line of the enemy across to Belen.  The troops that I was with were in  the houses north of the road leading into the city, and were engaged  during the night in cutting passage-ways from one house to another  towards the town.  During the night Santa Anna, with his army--except  the deserters--left the city.  He liberated all the convicts confined in  the town, hoping, no doubt, that they would inflict upon us some injury  before daylight; but several hours after Santa Anna was out of the way,  the city authorities sent a delegation to General Scott to ask--if not  demand--an armistice, respecting church property, the rights of citizens  and the supremacy of the city government in the management of municipal  affairs.  General Scott declined to trammel himself with conditions, but  gave assurances that those who chose to remain within our lines would be  protected so long as they behaved themselves properly.    General Quitman had advanced along his line very successfully on the  13th, so that at night his command occupied nearly the same position at  Belen that Worth's troops did about San Cosme. After the interview above  related between General Scott and the city council, orders were issued  for the cautious entry of both columns in the morning.  The troops under  Worth were to stop at the Alameda, a park near the west end of the city.  Quitman was to go directly to the Plaza, and take possession of the  Palace--a mass of buildings on the east side in which Congress has its  sessions, the national courts are held, the public offices are all  located, the President resides, and much room is left for museums,  receptions, etc.  This is the building generally designated as the  \"Halls of the Montezumas.\"        CHAPTER XII.
