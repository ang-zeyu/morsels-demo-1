I will pray the burgomaster to give you letters  of introduction to the Prince, saying you are a young Englishman  ready and desirous of doing all that lies in your power for the  cause; that you speak the language as a native, and will be ready  to carry his messages wheresoever he may require them to be sent;  that you can be relied upon to be absolutely faithful, and have  entered the cause in no light spirit or desire for personal credit  or honour, but as one who has suffered great wrong in the loss of  near relatives at the hands of the Spaniards, and is wishful only  of giving such services as he can to the cause.    \"It may be that coming with such recommendation the Prince will  see some way in which he can turn your services to account. And now  leave me, my boy. I am wearied with all this talking; and although  I deem that it is not my duty to withstand your wishes, it is no  slight trial to see my only son embark in so terrible and perilous  an adventure as this. But the cause I regard as a sacred one, and  it seems to me that I have no right to keep you from entering upon  it, as your mind lies that way.\"    Ned left the room greatly impressed with his father's words. He was  glad indeed that the permission he had asked for had been granted,  and that he was free to devote himself to the cause so dear to  most Englishmen, and doubly so to him from his relations with the  country. Sailing backwards and forwards to the various ports in  the Netherlands, and able to hold intercourse with all he met, he  had for years been listening to tales of atrocity and horror, until  he had come to regard the Spaniards as human monsters, and to long  with all his heart and strength to be able to join the oppressed  people against their tyrants.    Now he had got permission to do so. But he felt more than he had  done before the serious nature of the step which he was taking; and  although he did not for a moment regret the choice he had made, he  was conscious of its importance and of the solemn nature of the  duties he took upon himself in thus engaging in the struggle between  the Netherlands and Spain. He passed the room where his mother was  sitting, went over and kissed her, and then taking his cap passed  out into the street and mounted the ramparts, where he could think  undisturbed. His father's words had not shaken his determination,  although they had depressed his enthusiasm; but as he paced up and  down, with the fresh air from the sea blowing upon his cheek, the  feeling of youth and strength soon sent the blood dancing through  his veins again. His cheeks flushed, and his eyes brightened.    \"There is honour and glory in the struggle,\" he said. \"Did not the  people, old and young, pour out to the Crusades to wrest Jerusalem  from the hands of the infidels? This is a more glorious task. It is  to save God's followers from destruction; to succour the oppressed;  to fight for women and children as well as for men. It is a holier  and nobler object than that for which the Crusaders fought. They  died in hundreds of thousands by heat, by famine, thirst, and the  swords of the enemy. Few of those who fought ever returned home  to reap glory for their deeds; but there was honour for those who  fell. And in the same spirit in which even women and children left  their homes, and went in crowds to die for the Holy Sepulchre, so  will I venture my life for religion and freedom here.\"    An hour later he returned home; he could see that his mother had  been crying.    \"Mother,\" he said, \"I trust you will not grieve over this. I have  been thinking how the women of the early days sent their husbands  and sons and lovers to fight for the Holy Sepulchre. I think that  this cause is an even greater and more noble one; and feel sure  that though you may be anxious, you will not grudge me to do my  best for our religion and country people.\"    \"Truly I think it is a holy cause, my boy; and after what your  father has said, I would not if I could say nay. I can only pray  that heaven will bless and keep you, and one day restore you to  me. But you will not be always fighting, Ned. There is no saying  how long the struggle may last; and if I let you go, it is with  the promise that at one-and-twenty at the latest you will return  to us, and take your place again as your father's right hand and  mine.\"    \"I promise you, mother, that then, or if at any time before that  you write and say to me come home, I will come.\"    \"I am content with that,\" his mother said.    That afternoon Ned told Peters what had been decided, and the  following morning the latter had a long talk with Captain Martin,  who directed him to apply to the other owners of the ship to appoint  him an able first mate, and also to choose one of their clerks in  whom they had confidence to sail in the vessel as supercargo.    \"The doctors tell me, Peters, that in two or three months I may be  able to return home and to get about on crutches; but they advise  me that it will be at least another four months before I can strap  on a wooden leg and trust my weight to it. When I can do that, I  shall see how I can get about. You heard from Ned last night that  he is going to enter as a sort of volunteer under the Prince of  Orange?\"    \"Yes, he told me, Captain Martin. He is a lad of spirit; and if I  were fifteen years younger I would go with him.\"    \"He is young for such work yet,\" Captain Martin said doubtfully.    \"He is a strong youth, Captain Martin, and can do a man's work. His  training at sea has made him steady and cool; and I warrant me, if  he gets into danger, he will get out again if there is a chance.  I only hope, Captain Martin, that the brush we have had with the  Spaniards will not be our last, and that we too may be in the way  of striking a blow at the Spaniards.\"    \"I hope that we may, Peters,\" Captain Martin said earnestly. \"My  mind is as much bent upon it as is Ned's; and I will tell you what  must at present be known only to yourself, that I have made up my  mind that if I recover, and can take command of the Good Venture  again, I will buy up the other shares, so that I can do what I like  with her without accounting to any man. I need not do so much on  board as I used to do, but will get you a good second mate, and will  myself only direct. Then we will, as at present, trade between London  and the Netherlands; but if, as is likely enough, the Spaniards  and Hollanders come to blows at sea, or the prince needs ships to  carry troops to beleaguered towns, then for a time we will quit  trading and will join with the Good Venture, and strike a blow at  sea.\"    \"That is good hearing, Captain Martin,\" Peters said, rubbing his  hands. \"I warrant me you will not find one of the crew backward  at that work, and for my part I should like nothing better than to  tackle a Spaniard who does not carry more than two or three times  our own strength. The last fellow was a good deal too big for us,  but I believe if we had stuck to him we should have beaten him in  the end, big as he was.\"    \"Perhaps we might, Peters; but the ship was not mine to risk then,  and we had cargo on board. If, in the future, we meet a Spaniard  when the ship is mine to venture, and our hold is clear, the Good  Venture shall not show him her stern I warrant you, unless he be  big enough to eat us.\"    On the following day the Good Venture set sail for England, and the  burgomaster having received a message from Captain Martin, praying  him to call upon him, paid him a visit. Captain Martin unfolded his  son's plans to him, and prayed him to furnish him with a letter to  the prince recommending him as one who might be trusted, and who  was willing to risk his life upon any enterprise with which he  might intrust him. This the burgomaster at once consented to do.    \"Younger lads than he,\" he said, \"have fought stoutly on the walls  of some of our towns against the Spaniards; and since such is his  wish, I doubt not he will be able to do good service. All Holland  has heard how your ship beat off the Don Pedro; and the fact that  the lad is your son, and took part in the fight, will at once  commend him to the prince. All Englishmen are gladly received; not  only because they come to fight as volunteers on our side, but as  a pledge that the heart of England is with us, and that sooner or  later she will join us in our struggle against Spain. And doubtless,  as you say, the fact that the lad is by his mother's side one of  us, and that he can converse in both our language and yours with  equal ease, is greatly in his favour. Tomorrow I will furnish him  with letters to the prince, and also to two or three gentlemen of  my acquaintances, who are in the prince's councils.\"    When the burgomaster had left, Captain Martin called Ned in.    \"Now, you are going as a volunteer, Ned, and for a time, at any  rate, there must be no question of pay; you are giving your services  and not selling them. In the first place you must procure proper  attire, in which to present yourself to the prince; you must also  purchase a helmet, breast and back pieces, with sword and pistols.  As for money, I shall give you a purse with sufficient for your  present needs, and a letter which you can present to any of the  merchants in the seaports with whom we have trade, authorizing you  to draw upon me, and praying them to honour your drafts. Do not  stint yourself of money, and do not be extravagant. Your needs  will be small, and when serving in a garrison or in the field you  will, of course, draw rations like others. I need not give you a  list of the merchants in the various towns, since you already know  them, and have been with me at many of their places of business.    \"In regard to your actions, I say to you do not court danger, but  do not avoid it. The cause is a good one,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6955"],[0,"The Prince and Betty (#20)"],[1,"face thawed into a bleak smile.    \"And yet,\" continued Smith, \"I gather that P. Maloney, on the other  hand, actually wishes to hurry on its decease. Strange!\"    A man in a serge suit, who had been lurking behind Betty, bobbed into  the open.    \"Where's this fellow Maloney? P. Maloney. That's the man we want to  see. I've been working for this paper without a break, except when I  had the grip, for four years, and now up comes this Maloney fellow, if  you please, and tells me in so many words that the paper's got no use  for me.\"    \"These are life's tragedies,\" sighed Smith.    \"What does he mean by it? That's what I want to know. And that's what  these gentlemen want to know. See here--\"    \"I am addressing--\" said Smith.    \"Asher's my name. B. Henderson Asher. I write 'Moments of Mirth.'\"    A look almost of excitement came into Smith's face, such a look as a  visitor to a foreign land might wear when confronted with some great  national monument. He stood up and shook Mr. Asher reverently by the  hand.    \"Gentlemen,\" he said, reseating himself, \"this is a painful case. The  circumstances, as you will admit when you have heard all, are peculiar.  You have asked me where Mr. Renshaw is. I don't know.\"    \"You don't know!\" exclaimed Mr. Asher.    \"Nobody knows. With luck you may find a black cat in a coal cellar on a  moonless night, but not Mr. Renshaw. Shortly after I joined this  journal, he started out on a vacation, by his doctor's orders, and left  no address. No letters were to be forwarded. He was to enjoy complete  rest. Who can say where he is now? Possibly racing down some rugged  slope in the Rockies with two grizzlies and a wildcat in earnest  pursuit. Possibly in the midst of Florida Everglades, making a noise  like a piece of meat in order to snare alligators. Who can tell?\"    Silent consternation prevailed among his audience.    \"Then, do you mean to say,\" demanded Mr. Asher, \"that this fellow  Maloney's the boss here, and that what he says goes?\"    Smith bowed.    \"Exactly. A man of intensely masterful character, he will brook no  opposition. I am powerless to sway him. Suggestions from myself as to  the conduct of the paper would infuriate him. He believes that radical  changes are necessary in the policy of _Peaceful Moments_, and he  will carry them through if it snows. Doubtless he would gladly consider  your work if it fitted in with his ideas. A rapid-fire impression of a  glove fight, a spine-shaking word picture of a railway smash, or  something on those lines, would be welcomed. But--\"    \"I have never heard of such a thing,\" said Mr. Waterman indignantly.    \"In this life,\" said Smith, shaking his head, \"we must be prepared for  every emergency. We must distinguish between the unusual and the  impossible. It is unusual for the acting editor of a weekly paper to  revolutionize its existing policy, and you have rashly ordered your  life on the assumption that it is impossible. You are unprepared. The  thing comes on you as a surprise. The cry goes round New York,  'Comrades Asher, Waterman, Philpotts, and others have been taken  unawares. They cannot cope with the situation.'\"    \"But what is to be done?\" cried Mr. Asher.    \"Nothing, I fear, except to wait. It may be that when Mr. Renshaw,  having dodged the bears and eluded the wildcat, returns to his post, he  will decide not to continue the paper on the lines at present mapped  out. He should be back in about ten weeks.\"    \"Ten weeks!\"    \"Till then, the only thing to do is to wait. You may rely on me to keep  a watchful eye on your interests. When your thoughts tend to take a  gloomy turn say to yourselves, 'All is well. Smith is keeping a  watchful eye on our interests.'\"    \"All the same, I should like to see this P. Maloney,\" said Mr. Asher.    \"I shouldn't,\" said Smith. \"I speak in your best interests. P. Maloney  is a man of the fiercest passions. He cannot brook interference. If you  should argue with him, there is no knowing what might not happen. He  would be the first to regret any violent action, when once he had  cooled off, but-- Of course, if you wish it I could arrange a meeting.  No? I think you are wise. And now, gentlemen, as I have a good deal of  work to get through--    \"All very disturbing to the man of culture and refinement,\" said Smith,  as the door closed behind the last of the malcontents. \"But I think  that we may now consider the line clear. I see no further obstacle in  our path. I fear I have made Comrade Maloney perhaps a shade unpopular  with our late contributors, but these things must be. We must clench  our teeth and face them manfully. He suffers in an excellent cause.\"          CHAPTER XVI    TWO VISITORS TO THE OFFICE      There was once an editor of a paper in the Far West who was sitting at  his desk, musing pleasantly on life, when a bullet crashed through the  window and imbedded itself in the wall at the back of his head. A happy  smile lighted up the editor's face. \"Ah!\" he said complacently, \"I knew  that personal column of ours would make a hit!\"    What the bullet was to the Far West editor, the visit of Mr. Martin  Parker to the offices of _Peaceful Moments_ was to Smith.    It occurred shortly after the publication of the second number of the  new series, and was directly due to Betty's first and only suggestion  for the welfare of the paper.    If the first number of the series had not staggered humanity, it had at  least caused a certain amount of comment. The warm weather had begun,  and there was nothing much going on in New York. The papers were  consequently free to take notice of the change in the policy of  _Peaceful Moments_. Through the agency of Smith's newspaper  friends, it received some very satisfactory free advertisement, and the  sudden increase in the sales enabled Smith to bear up with fortitude  against the numerous letters of complaint from old subscribers who did  not know what was good for them. Visions of a large new public which  should replace these Brooklyn and Flatbush ingrates filled his mind.    The sporting section of the paper pleased him most. The personality of  Kid Brady bulked large in it. A photograph of the ambitious pugilist,  looking moody and important in an attitude of self-defense, filled half  a page, and under the photograph was the legend, \"Jimmy Garvin must  meet this boy.\" Jimmy was the present holder of the light-weight title.  He had won it a year before, and since then had confined himself to  smoking cigars as long as walking sticks and appearing nightly in a  vaudeville sketch entitled, \"A Fight for Honor.\" His reminiscences were  being published in a Sunday paper. It was this that gave Smith the idea  of publishing Kid Brady's autobiography in _Peaceful Moments_, an  idea which won the Kid's whole-hearted gratitude. Like most pugilists  he had a passion for bursting into print. Print is the fighter's  accolade. It signifies that he has arrived. He was grateful to Smith,  too, for not editing his contributions. Jimmy Garvin groaned under the  supervision of a member of the staff of his Sunday paper, who deleted  his best passages and altered the rest into Addisonian English. The  readers of _Peaceful Moments_ got their Brady raw.    \"Comrade Brady,\" said Smith meditatively to Betty one morning, \"has a  singularly pure and pleasing style. It is bound to appeal powerfully to  the many-headed. Listen to this. Our hero is fighting one Benson in the  latter's home town, San Francisco, and the audience is rooting hard for  the native son. Here is Comrade Brady on the subject: 'I looked around  that house, and I seen I hadn't a friend in it. And then the gong goes,  and I says to myself how I has one friend, my old mother down in  Illinois, and I goes in and mixes it, and then I seen Benson losing his  goat, so I gives him a half-scissor hook, and in the next round I picks  up a sleep-producer from the floor and hands it to him, and he takes  the count.' That is what the public wants. Crisp, lucid, and to the  point. If that does not get him a fight with some eminent person,  nothing will.\"    He leaned back in his chair.    \"What we really need now,\" he said thoughtfully, \"is a good, honest,  muck-raking series. That's the thing to put a paper on the map. The  worst of it is that everything seems to have been done. Have you by any  chance a second 'Frenzied Finance' at the back of your mind? Or proofs  that nut sundaes are composed principally of ptomaine and outlying  portions of the American workingman? It would be the making of us.\"    Now it happened that in the course of her rambles through the city  Betty had lost herself one morning in the slums. The experience had  impressed itself on her mind with an extraordinary vividness. Her lot  had always been cast in pleasant places, and she had never before been  brought into close touch with this side of life. The sight of actual  raw misery had come home to her with an added force from that  circumstance. Wandering on, she had reached a street which eclipsed in  cheerlessness even its squalid neighbors. All the smells and noises of  the East Side seemed to be penned up here in a sort of canyon. The  masses of dirty clothes hanging from the fire-escapes increased the  atmosphere of depression. Groups of ragged children covered the  roadway.    It was these that had stamped the scene so indelibly on her memory. She  loved children, and these seemed so draggled and uncared-for.    Smith's words gave her an idea.    \"Do you know Broster Street, Mr. Smith?\" she asked.    \"Down on the East Side? Yes, I went there once to get a story, one  red-hot night in August, when I was on the _News_. The Ice Company  had been putting up their prices, and trouble was expected down there.  I was sent to cover it.\"    He did not add that he had spent a week's salary that night, buying ice  and distributing it among the denizens of Broster Street.    \"It's an awful place,\" said Betty,"]]]
