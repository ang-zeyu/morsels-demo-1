The Latins, on their entrance into Constantinople, respected  neither the works of God nor man, but vented their brutal ferocity upon  the one and satisfied their avarice upon the other. Many beautiful  bronze statues, above all price as works of art, were broken into  pieces to be sold as old metal. The finely-chiselled marble, which  could be put to no such vile uses, was also destroyed, with a  recklessness; if possible, still more atrocious. [The following is a  list of some of the works of art thus destroyed, from Nicetas, a  contemporary Greek author:--1st. A colossal Juno, from the forum of  Constantine, the head of which was so large that four horses could  scarcely draw it from the place where it stood to the palace. 2d. The  statue of Paris presenting the apple to Venus. 3d. An immense bronze  pyramid, crowned by a female figure, which turned with the wind. 4th.  The colossal statue of Bellerophon, in bronze, which was broken down  and cast into the furnace. Under the inner nail of the horse's hind  foot on the left side, was found a seal wrapped in a woollen cloth.  5th. A figure of Hercules, by Lysimachus, of such vast dimensions that  the thumb was equal in circumference to the waist of a man. 6th. The  Ass and his driver, cast by order of Augustus after the battle of  Actium, in commemoration of his having discovered the position of  Antony through the means of an ass-driver. 7th. The Wolf suckling the  twins of Rome. 8th. The Gladiator in combat with a lion. 9th. The  Hippopotamus. 10th. The Sphinxes. 11th. An eagle fighting with a  serpent. 12th. A beautiful statue of Helen. 13th. A group, with a  monster somewhat resembling a bull, engaged in deadly conflict with a  serpent; and many other works of art, too numerous to mention.]    The carnage being over, and the spoil distributed, six persons were  chosen from among the Franks and six from among the Venetians, who were  to meet and elect an Emperor, previously binding themselves by oath to  select the individual best qualified among the candidates.  The choice  wavered between Baldwin, Count of Flanders, and Boniface, Marquis of  Montferrat, but fell eventually upon the former. He was straightway  robed in the imperial purple, and became the founder of a new dynasty.  He did not live long to enjoy his power, or to consolidate it for his  successors, who, in their turn, were soon swept away. In less than  sixty years the rule of the Franks at Constantinople was brought to as  sudden and disastrous a termination as the reign of Murzuphlis: and  this was the grand result of the fifth Crusade.    Pope Innocent III, although he had looked with no very unfavourable eye  upon these proceedings, regretted that nothing had been done for the  relief of the Holy Land; still, upon every convenient occasion, he  enforced the necessity of a new Crusade. Until the year 1213, his  exhortations had no other effect than to keep the subject in the mind  of Europe. Every spring and summer, detachments of pilgrims continued  to set out for Palestine to the aid of their brethren, but not in  sufficient numbers to be of much service. These periodical passages  were called the passagiuum Martii, or the passage of March, and the  passagium Johannis, or the passage of the festival of St. John. These  did not consist entirely of soldiers, armed against the Saracen, but of  pilgrims led by devotion, and in performance of their vows, bearing  nothing with them but their staff and their wallet. Early in the spring  of 1213 a more extraordinary body of crusaders was raised in France and  Germany. An immense number of boys and girls, amounting, according to  some accounts, to thirty thousand, were incited by the persuasion of  two monks to undertake the journey to Palestine. They were, no doubt,  composed of the idle and deserted children who generally swarm in great  cities, nurtured in vice and daring, and ready for anything. The object  of the monks seems to have been the atrocious one of inveigling them  into slave ships, on pretence of sending them to Syria, and selling  them for slaves on the coast of Africa. [See Jacob de Voragine and  Albericus.] Great numbers of these poor victims were shipped at  Marseilles; but the vessels, with the exception of two or three, were  wrecked on the shores of Italy, and every soul perished. The remainder  arrived safely in Africa, and were bought up as slaves, and sent off  into the interior of the country. Another detachment arrived at Genoa;  but the accomplices in this horrid plot having taken no measures at  that port, expecting them all at Marseilles, they were induced to  return to their homes by the Genoese.    Fuller, in his quaint history of the \"Holy Warre,\" says that this  Crusade was done by the instinct of the devil; and he adds a reason,  which may provoke mirth now, but which was put forth by the worthy  historian in all soberness and sincerity. He says, \"the devil, being  cloyed with the murdering of men, desired a cordial of children's blood  to comfort his weak stomach;\" as epicures, when tired of mutton, resort  to lamb for a change.    It appears from other authors that the preaching of the vile monks had  such an effect upon these deluded children that they ran about the  country, exclaiming, \"O, Lord Jesus, restore thy cross to us!\" and that  neither bolts nor bars, the fear of fathers, nor the love of mothers,  was sufficient to restrain them from journeying to Jerusalem.    The details of these strange proceedings are exceedingly meagre and  confused, and none of the contemporary writers who mention the subject  have thought it worth while to state the names of the monks who  originated the scheme, or the fate they met for their wickedness.  Two  merchants of Marseilles, who were to have shared in the profits, were,  it is said, brought to justice for some other crime, and suffered  death; but we are not informed whether they divulged any circumstances  relating to this matter.    Pope Innocent III does not seem to have been aware that the causes of  this juvenile Crusade were such as have been stated, for, upon being  informed that numbers of them had taken the Cross, and were marching to  the Holy Land, he exclaimed, \"These children are awake, while we  sleep!\" He imagined, apparently, that the mind of Europe was still bent  on the recovery of Palestine, and that the zeal of these children  implied a sort of reproach upon his own lukewarmness. Very soon  afterwards, he bestirred himself with more activity, and sent an  encyclical letter to the clergy of Christendom, urging them to preach a  new Crusade. As usual, a number of adventurous nobles, who had nothing  else to do, enrolled themselves with their retainers. At a council of  Lateran, which was held while these bands were collecting, Innocent  announced that he himself would take the Cross, and lead the armies of  Christ to the defence of his sepulchre. In all probability he would  have done so, for he was zealous enough; but death stepped in, and  destroyed his project ere it was ripe. His successor encouraged the  Crusade, though he refused to accompany it; and the armament continued  in France, England, and Germany. No leaders of any importance joined it  from the former countries. Andrew, King of Hungary, was the only  monarch who had leisure or inclination to leave his dominions. The  Dukes of Austria and Bavaria joined him with a considerable army of  Germans, and marching to Spalatro, took ship for Cyprus, and from  thence to Acre.    The whole conduct of the King of Hungary was marked by pusillanimity  and irresolution. He found himself in the Holy Land at the head of a  very efficient army; the Saracens were taken by surprise, and were for  some weeks unprepared to offer any resistance to his arms. He defeated  the first body sent to oppose him, and marched towards Mount Tabor,  with the intention of seizing upon an important fortress which the  Saracens had recently constructed. He arrived without impediment at the  Mount, and might have easily taken it; but a sudden fit of cowardice  came over him, and he returned to Acre without striking a blow. He very  soon afterwards abandoned the enterprise altogether, and returned to  his own country.    Tardy reinforcements arrived at intervals from Europe; and the Duke of  Austria, now the chief leader of the expedition, had still sufficient  forces at his command to trouble the Saracens very seriously. It was  resolved by him, in council with the other chiefs, that the whole  energy of the Crusade should be directed upon Egypt, the seat of the  Saracen power in its relationship to Palestine, and from whence were  drawn the continual levies that were brought against them by the  Sultan. Damietta, which commanded the river Nile, and was one of the  most important cities of Egypt, was chosen as the first point of  attack. The siege was forthwith commenced, and carried on with  considerable energy, until the crusaders gained possession of a tower,  which projected into the middle of the stream, and was looked upon as  the very key of the city.    While congratulating themselves upon this success, and wasting in  revelry the time which should have been employed in pushing the  advantage, they received the news of the death of the wise Sultan  Saphaddin. His two sons, Camhel and Cohreddin, divided his empire  between them. Syria and Palestine fell to the share of Cohreddin, while  Egypt was consigned to the other brother, who had for some time  exercised the functions of Lieutenant of that country. Being unpopular  among the Egyptians, they revolted against him, giving the crusaders a  finer opportunity for making a conquest than they had ever enjoyed  before. But, quarrelsome and licentious as they had been from time  immemorial, they did not see that the favourable moment had come; or,  seeing,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/714"],[0,"The Bobbsey Twins in the Country (#20)"],[1,"ou?\" he asked  wistfully.    Then Harry and Bert jumped up to start the phonograph, and that was  like a band wagon to the little fellows, who liked to hear the popular  tunes called off by the funny man in the big bright horn.        CHAPTER XX    A MIDNIGHT SCARE    \"Sometimes I'm afraid in the bed tent over there,\" said Sandy to  Freddie. \"'Cause there ain't nothing to keep the dark out but a piece  of veil in the door.\"    \"Mosquito netting,\" corrected Freddie. \"I would be afraid to sleep  outdoors that way too. 'Cause maybe there's snakes.\"    \"There sure is,\" declared the other little fellow, cuddling up closer  to Freddie. \"'Cause one of the boys, Tommy his name is, killed two the  other day.\"    \"Well, there ain't no snakes around here,\" declared Freddie, \"an' this  bed was put in this room, right next to mama's, for me, so you needn't  be scared when Aunt Sarah comes and turns out the lights.\"    Both little boys were very sleepy, and in spite of having so many  things to tell each other the sand-man came around and interrupted  them, actually making their eyes fall down like porch screens when  someone touches the string.    Mrs. Bobbsey came up and looked in at the door.    Two little sunny heads so close together!    \"Why should that little darling be left alone over in the dark tent!\"  she thought. \"See how happy he is with our own dear son Freddie.\"    Then she tucked them a little bit, half closed the door, and turned out  the hall light.    Everybody must have been dreaming for hours, it seemed so at any rate,  when suddenly all were awake again.    What was it?    What woke up the household with such a start?    \"There it is again!\" screamed Flossie. \"Oh, mamma, mamma, come in my  room quick!\"    Sandy grabbed hold of Freddie.    \"We're all right,\" whispered the brave little Freddie. \"It's only the  girls that's hollering.\"    Then they both put their curls under the bedquilts.    \"Someone's playing the piano,\" Bert said to Harry; and, sure enough, a  nocturnal solo was coming up in queer chunks from the parlor.    \"It's a crazy burglar, and he never saw a piano before,\" Flossie said.    The hall clock just struck midnight. That seemed to make everybody more  frightened.    Uncle Daniel was hurrying down the stairs now.    \"There it is again,\" whispered Bert, as another group of wild chords  came from the piano.    \"It must be cats!\" exclaimed Uncle Daniel. \"Harry, come down here and  help light up, and we'll solve this mystery.\"    Without a moment's hesitation Bert and Harry were down the stairs and  had the hall light burning as quickly as a good match could be struck.    But there was no more music and no cats about.    \"Where is Snoop?\" asked Uncle Daniel.    The boys opened the hall door into the cellarway, and found there Snoop  on his cushion and Fluffy on hers.    \"It wasn't the cats,\" they declared.    \"What could it be?\"    Uncle Daniel even lighted the piano lamp, which gave a strong light,  but there didn't seem to be any disturbance about.    \"It certainly was the piano,\" he said, much puzzled.    \"And sounded like a cat serenade,\" ventured Harry.    \"Well, she isn't around here,\" laughed Uncle Daniel, \"and we never  heard of a ghost in Meadow Brook before.\"    All this time the people upstairs waited anxiously. Flossie held Nan so  tightly about the neck that the elder sister could hardly breathe.  Freddie and Sandy were still under the bedclothes, while Mrs. Bobbsey  and Aunt Sarah listened in the hall.    \"Dat sure is a ghost,\" whispered Dinah to Martha in the hall above.  \"Ghosts always lub music,\" and her funny big eyes rolled around in that  queer way colored people have of expressing themselves.    \"Ghosts nothin',\" replied Martha indignantly. \"I dusted every key of  the piano to-day, and I guess I could smell a ghost about as quick as  anybody.\"    \"Well, I don't see that we can do any good by sitting around here,\"  remarked Uncle Dan to the boys, after the lapse of some minutes. \"We  may as well put out the lights and get into bed again.\"    \"But I cannot see what it could be!\" Mrs. Bobbsey insisted, as they all  prepared to retire again.    \"Neither can we!\" agreed Uncle Daniel. \"Maybe our piano has one of  those self-playing tricks, and somebody wound it up by accident.\"    But no sooner were the lights out and the house quiet than the piano  started again.    \"Hush! keep quiet!\" whispered Uncle Daniel. \"I'll get it this time,  whatever it is!\"    With matches in one hand and a candle in the other he started  downstairs in the dark without making a sound, while the piano kept on  playing in \"chunks\" as Harry said, same as it did before.    Once in the parlor Uncle Daniel struck a match and put it to the  candle, and then the music ceased.    \"There he is!\" he called, and Flossie thought she surely would die.  Slam! went the music-book at something, and Sandy almost choked with  fear.    Bang! went something else, that brought Bert and Harry downstairs to  help catch the burglar.    \"There he is in the corner!\" called Uncle Daniel to the boys, and then  began such a slam banging time that the people upstairs were in terror  that the burglar would kill Harry and Bert and Uncle Daniel.    \"We've got him' We've got him!\" declared Harry, while Bert lighted the  lamp.    \"Is he dead?\" screamed Aunt Sarah from the stairs.    \"As a door-nail!\" answered Harry.    \"What is it?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey, hardly able to speak.    \"A big gray rat,\" replied Uncle Daniel, and everybody had a good laugh.    \"I thought it might be that,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey.    \"So did I,\" declared Nan. \"But I wasn't sure.\"    \"I thought it was a big black burglar,\" Flossie said, her voice still  shaking from the fright.    \"I thought it was a policeman,\" faltered Sandy. \"'Cause they always  bang things like that.\"    \"And I thought, sure's yo' life, it was a real ghost,\" laughed Dinah.  \"'Cause de clock jest struck fer de ghost hour. Ha! ha! dat was suah a  musicanious rat.\"    \"He must have come in from the fields where John has been plowing. Like  a cat in a strange garret, he didn't know what to do in a parlor,\" said  Uncle Daniel.    Harry took the candle and looked carefully over the keys.    \"Why, there's something like seeds on the keys!\" he said.    \"Oh, I have it!\" exclaimed Bert. \"Nan left her hat on the piano last  night, and it has those funny straw flowers on it. See, the rat got  some of them off and they dropped on the keys.\"    \"And the other time he came for the cake,\" said Aunt Sarah.    \"That's it,\" declared Uncle Daniel, \"and each time we scared him off he  came back again to finish his meal. But I guess he is through now,\" and  so saying he took the dead rodent and raising the side window tossed  him out.    It was some time before everybody got quieted down again, but finally  the rat scare was over and the Bobbseys turned to dreams of the happy  summer-time they were enjoying.    When Uncle Dan came up from the postoffice the next morning he brought  a note from the fresh-air camp.    \"Sandy has to go back!\" Nan whispered to Bert. \"His own father in the  city has sent for him, but mamma says not to say anything to Sandy or  Freddie--they might worry. Aunt Sarah will drive over and bring Sandy,  then they can fix it. I'm so sorry he has to go away.\"    \"So am I,\" answered Nan's twin. \"I don't see why they can't let the  little fellow alone when he is happy with us.\"    \"But it's his own father, you know, and something about a rich aunt.  Maybe she is going to adopt Sandy.\"    \"We ought to adopt him; he's all right with us,\" Bert grumbled. \"What  did his rich aunt let him cry his eyes out for if she cared anything  for him?\"    \"Maybe she didn't know about him then,\" Nan considered. \"I'm sure  everybody would have to love Sandy.\"    At that Sandy ran along the path with Freddie. He looked like a live  buttercup, so fresh and bright, his sunny sandy curls blowing in the  soft breeze. Mrs. Bobbsey had just called the children to her.    \"We are going over to see Mrs. Manily today, Sandy,\" she said. \"Won't  you be awfully glad to see your own dear Mamma Manily again?\"    \"Yep,\" he faltered, getting a better hold on Freddie's hand, \"but I  want to come back here,\" he finished.    Poor darling! So many changes of home in his life had made him fear  another.    \"Oh, I am sure you will come to see us again,\" Mrs. Bobbsey declared.  \"Maybe you can come to Lakeport when we go home in the fall.\"    \"No, I'm comin' back here,\" he insisted, \"to see Freddie, and auntie,  and uncle, and all of them.\"    \"Well, we must get ready now,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey. \"John has gone to  bring the wagon.\"    Freddie insisted upon going to the camp with Sandy, \"to make sure he  would come down again,\" he said.    It was only the happiness of seeing Mamma Manily once more that kept  Sandy from crying when they told him he was to go on a great big fast  train to see his own papa.    \"You see,\" Mrs. Manily explained to Mrs. Bobbsey, \"a wealthy aunt of  Edward's expects to adopt him, so we will have to give him up, I am  afraid.\"    \"I hope you can keep track of him,\" answered Mrs. Bobbsey, \"for we are  all so attached to him. I think we would have applied to the Aid  Society to let him share our home if the other claim had not come first  and taken him from us.\"    Then Freddie kissed Sandy good-bye. It was not the kind of a caress  that girls give, but the two little fellows said good-bye, kissed each  other very quickly, then looked down at the ground in a brave effort  not to cry.    Mrs. Bobbsey gave Sandy a real mother's love kiss, and he said:    \"Oh, I'm comin' beck--to-morrow. I won't stay in the city. I'll just  run away and come back.\"    So Sandy was gone to another home, and we hope he will grow to be as  fine a  boy as he has been a loving child.    \"How lonely it seems,\" said Nan that afternoon. \"Sandy was so jolly.\"    Freddie followed John all over the place, and could not find anything  worth doing.
