To the fifth question, which refers to what the same Hojeda  discovered himself beyond Paria, he replied as follows: \"I was the first  to go on an exploring expedition after the discovery of the Admiral,  and I went first nearly 200 leagues to the south on the mainland, and  afterwards came to Paria, going out by the 'Boca del Drago'. There I  ascertained that the Admiral had been at the island of Trinidad, bordering  on the 'Boca del Drago'.\" Further on he says: \"In the voyage which this  witness undertook, he took with him Juan de la Cosa and Americo Vespucio,  and other pilots.\"[144] Alonso de Hojeda says this, among other things,  in his deposition and statement.    Two things are thus proved by Hojeda himself. One is that he took  Americo with him, and the other that he undertook his voyage to the  mainland, after it had been discovered by the Admiral. The latter fact  is established beyond any doubt, namely, that the Admiral was the first  who discovered Paria, and that he was there before any other Christian  whatever was either there or on any other part of the mainland, nor had  any tidings of it. The Admiral Don Diego, his son, had proof of this  from sixty hearsay witnesses and twenty-five eye-witnesses, as is seen  by the records of the lawsuit, which I have not only seen but thoroughly  examined. It was also proved that it was owing to the Admiral having  first discovered these islands of the Indies, and afterwards Paria,  which is the mainland, before anyone else whatever, that the others had  the courage to follow his example and become discoverers. It may be  held for certain that no one would have undertaken to go on voyages of  discovery, and that neither the Indies nor any part of them would have  been made known if the Admiral had not led the way. This is proved by  sixteen hearsay witnesses, by forty-one who believed it, by twenty who  knew it, and by thirteen who gave evidence that in their belief the  Admiral made his discoveries before anyone else whatever. Peter Martyr  also gives the same testimony in his first Decade, chapters 8 and 9. This  author deserves more credit than any of those who have written in Latin,  because he was in Castille at the time, and knew all the explorers, and  they were glad to tell him all they had seen and discovered, as a man  in authority; and because he made his inquiries with a view to writing,  as we mentioned in the prologue of the history.    Americo confesses in his first _Navigation_ that he arrived at Paria  during his first voyage, saying: \"_Et provincia ipsa Parias[145] ab ipsis  nuncupata est._\" Afterwards he made the second _Navigation_, also with  Hojeda, as will appear in chapter 162.    Here it is important to note and make clear the error made by the world in  general respecting America. What I say is this: As no one had arrived at  nor seen Paria before the Admiral, and as the next explorer who arrived  was Hojeda, it follows that either Americo was with Hojeda, or came after  him. If he was with Hojeda, Hojeda was after the Admiral. The Admiral  left San Lucar on the 30th of May, and came in sight of Trinidad and the  mainland on the last day of July, and the 1st and 3rd of August, as has  been proved. How, therefore, can Americo say, without a perversion of  the truth, that he left Cadiz in his first _Navigation_ on the 20th of  May of the year of our salvation 1497? The falsehood is clear, and if the  statement was made by him in earnest, he committed a great infamy. Even  if it is not an intentional falsehood, it seems to be so; for he gives  himself an advantage of ten days as regards the Admiral, with reference  to the departure from Cadiz, for the Admiral left San Lucar on the 30th  of May, and Americo alleges that he departed from Cadiz on the 20th  of that month, and also usurps a year, for the Admiral sailed in 1498,  while Americo pretends that he set out on his first _Navigation_ in the  year 1497. It is true that there would seem to be a mistake, and not an  intentional fraud in this, for Americo says that his first _Navigation_  occupied eighteen months, and at the end he asserts that the date of  his return to Cadiz was the 15th of October 1499. If he left Cadiz on  the 20th of May 1497, the voyage occupied twenty-nine months: seven in  the year 1497, all the year 1498, and ten months in the year 1499. It  is possible that 1499 may be a misprint for 1498[146] in treating of  the return to Castille, and if this was so, there can be no doubt that  the fraud was intentional. This fraud or mistake, whichever it may  have been, and the power of writing and narrating well and in a good  style, as well as Americo's silence respecting the name of his captain,  which was Hojeda, and his care to mention no one but himself, and his  dedication to King Rene, these things have led foreign writers to name  our mainland AMERICA, as if Americo alone, and not another with him, had  made the discovery before all others. It is manifest what injustice he  did if he intentionally usurped what belonged to another, namely, to the  Admiral Don Cristobal Colon, and with what good reason this discovery,  and all its consequences, should belong to the Admiral, after the goodness  and providence of God, which chose him for this work. As it belongs more  to him, the said continent ought to be called Columba, after Colon, or  Columbo, who discovered it, or else \"Sancta\" or \"De Gracia\", the names  he himself gave it, and not America after Americo.           *       *       *       *       *      CHAPTER CLXIV.    The Admiral sent five ships[147] with the news of the discovery of the  mainland of Paria, and of the pearls. Alonso de Hojeda was then in  Spain. I believe myself that he returned at the same time as my uncle,  Francisco de Penalosa, knowing that the Admiral had discovered that  land and the pearls, and having seen the chart of the new discoveries  which the Admiral had sent to the Sovereigns, and that the Admiral said  in his letters that it was an island, although he was also inclined to  the belief that it was a continent; and being favoured by the Bishop of  Badajos, Don Juan de Fonseca, who superintended and managed everything,  Hojeda petitioned that he might have licence to discover in those parts  either continent, or islands, or whatever he might find. The Bishop  gave the licence, signed with his own signature, and not with that of  the Sovereign, either because the Sovereigns ordered him to grant such  licences, or this one only, which is hard to believe; or because he  wished to make the grant of his own authority, and without giving the  Sovereigns a share in the matter, the Admiral having complained to the  Sovereigns in the year 1495 that it was in opposition to his privileges  to give a licence to anyone to undertake discoveries.... I do not see  how the Bishop was able to grant the licence in the way he did. But I  quite see that as he was a very determined and obstinate man, and was  hostile to the Admiral's interests, he may have taken this step actuated  by his own audacity, and without consulting the Sovereigns. This is  possible, but still I doubt it; for, although he was very intimate with  the Sovereigns, this was hardly a thing that he would have dared to do  on his own authority. The licence was granted with the limitations that  it did not include the territory of the King of Portugal, nor the lands  discovered by the Admiral up to the year 1495. Another question arises  here: Why was not the land excepted which the Admiral had just discovered,  and which was identified by the letters and the chart he had sent to  the Sovereigns? To this I cannot give an answer.    That the licence was only signed by the said Bishop, and not by the  Sovereigns, there can be no doubt, for Francisco Roldan saw it, and so  described it to the Admiral, and I saw Roldan's original letter, as I  will presently mention.    Hojeda having obtained the licence, he found persons in Seville who would  fit out four caravels or ships, for there were many who were eager to  go and discover by means of the thread which the Admiral had put into  their hands. For he was the first who opened the gates of that Ocean Sea,  which had been closed for so many ages.    Hojeda set out from the port of Santa Maria or of Cadiz in the month of  May. If Americo Vespucio does not speak contrary to the truth as regards  the day of the month, he does so as regards the year. The date of Hojeda's  departure was the 20th of May 1499, not 1497, as Americo says, usurping  the honour and glory which belongs to the Admiral, and assuming the whole  for himself alone, wishing to give the world to understand that he was the  first discoverer of the mainland of Paria, and not the Admiral, to whom  is justly and rightfully due all the discovery of all these islands and  mainland of the Indies, as has already been proved in chapter 140. In  that chapter I endeavoured to leave it doubtful whether Americo had,  with intention, tacitly denied that this discovery was made first by  the Admiral, and had given the credit of it to himself alone. For I had  not then seen what I afterwards gathered from those writings of Americo,  and from other writings of those times in my possession, or which I have  found. From these I conclude that it was a most false and dishonest thing  on the part of Americo to wish to usurp against justice the honour due to  the Admiral. The proof of this falsehood is made clear from the evidence  of Americo himself, in this way. We will assume what has already been  proved in chapter 140, namely:--First"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36962"],[0,"My Attainment of the Pole (#20)"],[1,"hoped to force a new route to the Pole; upon its snowy highlands was  poured a soft creamy light from encouraging skies. To the right was the  rugged coast of Greenland, its huge, ice-chiselled cliffs leaping  portentously forward in the gloom. Thrilling with the race, we made a  run of twenty miles and reached Rensselaer Harbor, where Dr. Kane had  spent his long nights of misfortune.    We pitched camp at the ice-foot at the head of the bay. Although we  found traces of hare and fox, it was too dark to venture on the chase.  The temperature had fallen to -40 deg., the wind pierced with a sharp sting.  For my shelter I erected a new tent which I had invented, and the  efficiency of which I desired to test. Taking the sledge frame work as a  platform, a folding top of strong canvas was fastened, and spread  between two bars of hickory from each end. The entrance was in front.  Inside was a space eight feet long and three and one-half feet wide,  with a round whaleback top. Inside this a supplementary wall was  constructed of light blankets, offering an air space of an inch between  the outer wall as a non-conductor to confine the little heat generated  within. As there was ample room for only two persons, Koo-loo-ting-wah,  my leading man, was invited to share the tent. The natives had not  provided themselves with shelter of any kind. They had counted on either  building an igloo or seeking the shelter of the snows, as do the  creatures of the wilds.    Inside my tent I prepared a meal on the little German stove, burning the  vapor of alcohol. The meal consisted of a pail of hot corn meal, fried  bacon and a liberal all-round supply of steaming tea. To accomplish  this, which included melting the snow, heating the water, and cooking  everything separately, required about two hours. As I considered eating  outside with any degree of comfort impossible, my companions were  invited to crowd inside the tent. The vapor of their breath and that of  the cooking soon condensed into snow, and a miniature snowstorm covered  everything within. After this was swept out, the Eskimos were invited to  enter again. All partook of the meal ravenously, and then emerged to  reconnoiter the surroundings. Tracks of ptarmigan, hare and foxes were  found, and as we moved about with seeking, owl eyes, ravens shouted  notes of welcome.    We then retired to rest. As there was no snow about that was  sufficiently hard to cut blocks with which to erect snow houses, the  natives placed themselves in semi-reclining positions on their sledges  and slept in their traveling clothes. After a few hours they awoke and  partook of chopped frozen meat and blubber; two hours later, they made a  fire in a tin can, with moss and blubber as fuel, and over this prepared  a pot of parboiled meat. A crescent-shaped wall of snow was built to  break the wind; in the shelter of this they sat, grinning delightedly,  and eating savagely, with much smacking of the lips, the steaming broth  and walrus meat. All this I studied with intense interest. I desired on  this trip not only to test my tent, but to learn more of the native  arts of the Eskimo, knowing that I, on my Polar trip, must, if I would  be successful, adapt myself to just such methods of living.    This was my first winter experience of camping out in the night season  for this year, and, with only a diet of meal and bacon, I was miserably  cold. I was now testing also for the first time the new winter clothing  with which I and all my companions were dressed. Our shirts were made of  bird skins. Over these were coats of blue fox or caribou skins; our  trousers were of bear, our boots of seal, and our stockings of hare  skins. This was the usual native winter costume, but under it I had  added a suit of underwear.    Retiring again for rest, I left instructions to be called for an early  start. It seemed that I had hardly settled comfortably in my sleeping  bag when the call for action came.    We hastily partook of tea and biscuits, harnessed our teams and started  through the dark. The Eskimos, having eaten their fill of fat and frozen  meat, to which I must yet accustom myself, were thoroughly comfortable.  I was miserably cold.    By running behind my sledge I produced sufficient bodily heat after  awhile to feel comfortable. My face suffered severely from the cutting  slant of the winds. We passed the perpendicular walls of Cape Seiper at  dawn. We ran along the long, straight coast into Bancroft Bay during the  six hours of twilight. The journey was continued to Dallas Bay by a  forced march of fifty miles before we halted.    The scene displayed the rare glory of twilight charms as it had the day  before, but the snow was deeper, the temperature lower. The wind  steadily increased and veered northward. We made several efforts to  cross the bay ice, but cracked ice, huge uplifted blocks and deep snows  compelled a retreat to the ice-foot.    The ice-foot along Smith Sound is a superb highway, where otherwise  sledge travel would be quite impossible along the coast.    Along Dallas Bay we found a great deal of grass-covered land in  undulating valleys and on low hills, which offered grazing for caribou  and hare. The preceding glimmer of the new moon, which was to rise a few  days hence, offered sufficient light to search for game.    We now fed our dogs for the first time since leaving Annoatok. After a  liberal drink of snow water, we started to seek our luck in the chase.  In the course of an hour my companions returned with four hares which,  when dressed, weighed about forty-eight pounds. Two of these were  cached. The others were eaten later.    Before dawn of the day-long twilight the wind increased to a full gale.  The sky to the north, smoky all night, now blackened as with soot. The  wind came with a howl that brought to mind the despairing cries of the  dying explorers whose bleached bones were strewn along the shore. The  gloomy outline of the coast remained visible for awhile; but soon the  air thickened and came weighted with snow that piled up in huge drifts.    The Eskimos took a few of their favorite dogs and sought shelter to the  lee of the tent, where drift covered their blankets with snow. Breathing  holes were kept open over their faces. Buried in snow drifts, they were  imprisoned for twenty-eight hours. But this tent sled sheltered  Koo-loo-ting-wah and myself. When the rush of the storm had abated we  began digging our way out. In this effort we dug up men and dogs like  potatoes from a patch. The northern sky had paled, the south was  brightening. The pack was lined with long lines beyond each hummock; the  snow was covered with a strong crust. But the ice-foot was a hopeless  line of drifts which made travel over it quite impossible.    The work of pounding snow from the dogs and freeing the sledges brought  to our faces beads of perspiration which rolled off and froze in lines  of ice on our furs. We were none the worse as a result of the storm, and  although hungry as wolves, time was too precious to stop for a full  meal.    We now pushed out of the bay, on to the sea ice. At this point the dogs  scented a bear and soon crossed its track. Rested and hungry, they were  in condition for a desperate chase. Their sharp noses pointed keenly  into the huge bear foot-prints, their little ears quivered, while, with  howls, they started onward in a mad rush.    Neither our voices nor the whips made an impression on their wild speed.  We crossed banks and ridges of snow and swirled about slopes of ice,  gripping sledges violently. Now we were thrown to one side, again to the  other, dragging resistlessly beside the sleds. Rising, we gripped the  rear upstanders with fierce determination.    Just how we escaped broken limbs, and our sledges utter destruction, is  a mystery to me. After a run of an hour we sighted the bear. The animal  had evidently sighted us, for he was galloping for the open water  toward the northwest. We cut the fleetest dogs loose from each team.  Freed, they rushed over the snow like race-horses. But the bear had an  advantage. As the first dog nipped his haunches he plunged into the  black waters. We advanced and waited for him to rise. But this bruin had  sense enough to emerge on the opposite shore, where he shook off the  freezing waters vigorously, and then sat down as if to have a laugh at  us.    I knew that to plunge into the waters would have been fatal to dog or  man and equally fatal to a boat, as ice, in the intense cold, would form  about it so rapidly that it could not be propelled.    The dogs sat down and howled a chorus of sad disappointment. For miles  about, the men sought fruitlessly for a way to cross. Outwitted, we  returned to continue our journey Northward.    Advance Bay and its islands were in sight. Among these, we aimed to  place our central camp. The light was fading fast, and a cold wind came  from Humboldt Glacier, which at this time was located by a slight  darkening of the sky. Many grounded icebergs were about, and the sea ice  was much crossed. The hummocks and the snow were not as troublesome as  farther south.    Two ravens followed us, their shrill cries echoing from berg to berg.  The Eskimos inferred from their presence that bears were near, but we  saw no tracks.    The cries of the ravens were nearly as provoking to the dogs as the bear  tracks, and we moved along rapidly to Brook's Island. This was rather  high, with a plateau and sharp cliffs. Bonsall Island near by was  rounded by glacial action. Between them we found a place to camp  somewhat sheltered from the wind.    While eating our ration of corn meal and bacon, howls of the dogs rose  to a fierce crescendo. I supposed they were saluting the coming of the  moon, as is their custom, but the howls changed to tones of increasing  excitement. We went out to inquire, but saw nothing. It was so dark that  I could not see the dogs twenty feet away,"]]]
