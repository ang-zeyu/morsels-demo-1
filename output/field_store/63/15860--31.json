While the \"Mormon\"  Battalion suffered, they were free to travel looking forward with hope  to something better; but that we were much longer under suffering  conditions, as we were tied up and had no hope only to stay and take  our chances.    When done speaking he asked me what would satisfy me and what demands I  had to make. I told him of the refusal to admit me into the quorum at  Provo, saying that if I was considered worthy, I would like a recommend  so as to have fellowship there.    The following letter was given me:  \"Great Salt Lake City, Presidents Office,                            \"Aug. 25th, 1857.    \"This is to certify to all whom it may concern, that we, the  undersigned, have investigated the matters between Daniel W. Jones  and the brethren who stayed with him at Devil's Gate, last winter,  and those who left goods at that place, and we are satisfied that  Brother Jones and those with him did the best they possibly could, were  perfectly honest, and that Brother Jones has satisfactorily accounted  for all the things which were taken; and they were necessarily taken to  save the lives of himself and company.    \"We consider that Brother Jones is entitled to the praise, confidence  and respect of all good men for the wise, self-denying and efficient  course he pursued. And we recommend him to all as a faithful brother  in good standing and full fellowship in the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints. (Signed)    \"Brigham Young, Daniel Spencer,  \"Heber C. Kimball, John Van Cott,  \"Daniel H. Wells, George D. Grant,  \"John Taylor, C. H. Wheelock,  \"Amasa Lyman, Edmund Ellsworth,  \"F. D. Richards. \"T. W. Ellerbeck                             \"Clerk.\"    Brother Brigham said if we had set fire to the whole outfit and run off  by the light of it he would never have found fault. So the trial ended  and I went home feeling pretty well.    I was asked many years after this trial by a son-in-law of one of my  accusers if Brother Brigham did not favor me in the trial because we  had been partial and used others' goods, leaving Brother Brigham's  alone.    I replied, \"No, sir; Brother Brigham had no goods whatever at Devil's  Gate. Neither had his name ever showed on box or bale, therefore he  could not have favored us on that account. He decided as he did simply  because he was just and right. Whether we were all naturally honest or  not, we were honest this trip, at least; for there was hardly a day but  what starvation stared us in the face, and we were not much inclined to  pilfer dry goods anyway.\"    I presented my recommend to the quorum which now received me into  their fellowship. After this some few came to me asking about goods in  rather an accusing manner. I referred them to Brother Brigham. So far  and wide had the stories gone, that many took advantage of them. One  old lady, an emigrant, who went to live in Provo, played a sharp game,  but was found out. She had three daughters who were all married soon  after getting in. These young ladies, as is usual with English girls,  had a nice lot of linen. So when the luggage arrived, in the spring,  the old lady came from Provo for the family goods. She, considering her  daughters provided for, and being thrifty in her nature and liking to  appear well, took her daughters' linen and traded it for furniture.    The reader must know that in those days anything from a pumpkin to a  petticoat was a legal tender for some amount, so the old lady had no  trouble in making the exchange. She went back feeling indignant at  \"Jones\" for robbing her daughters. She was a great tea-party woman and  never missed a chance to tell of my cruel conduct, sometimes shedding  tears over it.    One man who had married a daughter became a little suspicious, so he  went to the city and visited the furniture dealer, and soon found the  linen. He told me of the circumstance and asked me what I wished done,  as he considered it an outrage. I told him it was not worth noticing,  as there were so many similar things; to let the old woman and her  daughters settle their own affairs, that would be punishment enough. I  could tell of many more but this will suffice. Some of these stories  were related during the investigation.        CHAPTER XXI.    The Echo Canyon War--An Invading Foe--Plans for checking its  Progress--Peace declared--Pardon granted--The true Cause of the  Trouble--I work at Saddlery--The unjustifiable Killing of Yates--Visit  from Indians.    I will not attempt to give a full account of the Echo Canyon war but  will give only sufficient to connect this history.    Word reached Utah on the twenty-fourth of July, 1857, while the people  were celebrating Pioneer day in Big Cottonwood canyon that U. S. troops  were on the road to Utah. As soon as this report was confirmed, and  the intentions of the invaders fully learned--which were to place the  Territory under martial law, on the pretext that the \"Mormons\" were in  a state of rebellion--Brigham Young, both as President of the Church,  and Governor of the Territory, commenced to advise and issue orders  to meet the situation. The far-off settlements, San Bernardino in  Lower California and Carson valley, Nevada, both thrifty, prosperous  places, were broken up and the people called home to Utah. There was a  determined spirit manifested by both leaders and people to be ready to  meet in the best possible way whatever might come. No fear nor timidity  was shown. Neither was there lack of counsel, but everything that was  required to be done was promptly directed and as promptly executed.    A few companies of cavalry militia were sent out to reconnoiter.  Nothing official could be done by Governor Young on rumor. Finally  an armed force not officially known to him was found invading the  Territory of Utah. As soon as this was reported. The Governor ordered  General Wells to interrupt them and hinder their approach, and protect  the people of the Territory from the invading foe.    The question may be asked, did not President Young and the people know  that these were government troops? President Young and the people knew  it was a political mob; Governor Young, not being notified officially  of their coming, only knew them as an armed enemy entering the  Territory. He was appointed by the President of the United States to  govern under the laws common in the country. According to his oath of  office, he could do no less than try to protect his Territory. Governor  Young had no more right to know this army than had the sentinel on duty  to know his captain unless the captain gives the counter sign. This  Johnston at first refused to give, but as the sequel shows, never got  in until he \"hollowed turkey.\"    This force continued to advance. The troops ordered out by General  Wells did what they could to hinder their progress toward the valleys.  The situation finally became so serious that companies were ordered  from Davis, Salt Lake, and Utah counties to fortify Echo canyon. I went  with the regiment from Utah under Colonal Pace, and had charge of a few  picked riflemen. We remained in Echo during the winter fortifying the  place.    The boys on the plains made it very disagreeable for the advancing army  nightly, running off their beef herd, burning their provision trains  and the grass, and in every way possible impeding their progress.  Finally, winter set in with severity, catching them in the mountains at  Fort Bridger, where they were obliged to stay for the winter. They were  short of supplies and had a hard time wintering. Albert Sidney Johnston  was in command.    After this army was fully settled in their quarters, part of the Utah  army returned home, leaving only enough to watch the moves at Bridger.  This was a winter of business for the \"Mormon\" people. There was no  thought of submission, everything was fully arranged for the spring  work.    As soon as the weather moderated in the spring of 1858, the people  commenced to move from Salt Lake City and more northern settlements,  south as far as Utah county. Every house in Salt Lake City was  abandoned, not a family remaining. Men were detailed to set fire to and  burn everything that could be burned. The people really manifested joy  in these moves. No one appeared down-hearted at the sacrifices. All was  life and energy.    What was known as the standing army of Utah was organized, intending to  make guerrilla warfare on our enemies and hinder their progress, while  the people moved _en masse_ further and further south. There had been  good crops raised previous to this year; the country was full of bread  stuff and fat cattle. Provisions were prepared for future use. Not much  planting was done this season, particularly in the north.    A few troops were kept in Echo and along the road. I had charge of a  company at Lost Spring near the head of the canyon. In the latter part  of May we received orders to break up camp and come in; that peace had  been made. (The part Col. Kane took in bringing about a settlement  is a part of written history.) Ex-Governor Powell, of Kentucky, and  McCullough, of Texas, were sent to arrange peace. They brought printed  posters declaring the people all pardoned and notifying them to return  to their houses. Thus we conquered a great army and nation without  bloodshed.    The whole of this move was brought about by a charge made against the  \"Mormons\" by Judge Drummond, who had been appointed from the state of  Illinois. He had left his wife and family at home and brought here  with him a fancy lady (?) who sat beside him in court. This coming to  the knowledge of the public, Drummond was severely criticized by the  \"Mormon\" press. At this he took offense, and laid his plans for deep  revenge. He locked up his office, with the records in it, and arranged  with a party to set fire to and burn up the whole. He then left the  city in a hurry, pretending to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4657"],[0,"Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah — Volume 1 (#20)"],[1,"the soul destroy.\"    To which you will make answer, if you would pass for a man of belles  lettres, by the well-known lines,    \"Of a truth, the physician hath power with drugs,  Which, long as the patient hath life, may relieve him;  But the tale of our days being duly told,  The doctor is daft, and his drugs deceive him.\"    After sitting there with dignity, like the rest of the guests, I took  my leave, delighted with the truly Persian    [p.88]\"apparatus\" of the scene. The Mirza, having no salary, lives by  fees extorted from his subjects, who pay rather than lack protection;  and his dragoman for a counter-fee will sell their interests  shamelessly. He is a hidalgo of blue blood in pride, pompousness and  poverty. There is not a sheet of writing-paper in the \"Consulate\"-when  they want one a farthing is sent to the grocer's-yet the Consul drives  out in an old carriage with four outriders, two tall-capped men  preceding and two following the crazy vehicle. And the Egyptians laugh  heartily at this display, being accustomed by Mohammed Ali to consider  all such parade obsolete.    About half-an-hour before midnight sounds the Abrar[FN#27] or call to  prayer, at which time the latest wanderers return home to prepare for  the Sahur, their dawn meal. You are careful on the way to address each  sentinel with a \"Peace be upon thee!\" especially if you have no  lantern, otherwise you may chance to sleep in the guard-house. And,  chemin faisant, you cannot but stop to gaze at streets as little like  what civilised Europe understands by that name as is an Egyptian temple  to the new Houses of Parliament.    There are certain scenes, cannily termed \"Ken-speckle,\" which print  themselves upon Memory, and which endure as long as Memory lasts,-a  thunder-cloud bursting upon the Alps, a night of stormy darkness off  the Cape, an African tornado, and, perhaps, most awful of all, a  solitary journey over the sandy Desert.    Of this class is a stroll through the thoroughfares of old Cairo by  night. All is squalor in the brilliancy of noon-day. In darkness you  see nothing but a silhouette. When, however, the moon is high in the  heavens, and the summer stars rain light upon God's world, there is  something not of earth in the view. A glimpse at the    [p.89]strip of pale blue sky above scarcely reveals three ells of  breadth: in many places the interval is less: here the copings meet,  and there the outriggings of the houses seem to interlace. Now they are  parted by a pencil of snowy sheen, then by a flood of silvery  splendour; while under the projecting cornices and the huge hanging  balcony-windows of fantastic wood-work, supported by gigantic brackets  and corbels, and under deep verandahs, and gateways, vast enough for  Behemoth to pass through, and in blind wynds and long cul-de-sacs, lie  patches of thick darkness, made visible by the dimmest of oil lamps.  The arch is a favourite feature: in one place you see it a mere  skeleton-rib opening into some huge deserted hall; in another the ogre  is full of fretted stone and wood carved like lace-work. Not a line is  straight, the tall dead walls of the Mosques slope over their massy  buttresses, and the thin minarets seem about to fall across your path.  The cornices project crookedly from the houses, while the great gables  stand merely by force of cohesion. And that the Line of Beauty may not  be wanting, the graceful bending form of the palm, on whose topmost  feathers, quivering in the cool night breeze, the moonbeam glistens,  springs from a gloomy mound, or from the darkness of a mass of houses  almost level with the ground. Briefly, the whole view is so strange, so  fantastic, so ghostly, that it seems preposterous to imagine that in  such places human beings like ourselves can be born, and live through  life, and carry out the command \"increase and multiply,\" and die.    [FN#1] Of course all quarrelling, abuse, and evil words are strictly  forbidden to the Moslem during Ramazan. If one believer insult another,  the latter should repeat \"I am fasting\" three times before venturing  himself to reply. Such is the wise law. But human nature in Egypt, as  elsewhere, is always ready to sacrifice the spirit to the letter,  rigidly to obey the physical part of an ordinance, and to cast away the  moral, as if it were the husk and not the kernel.   [FN#2] Allah opens (the door of daily bread) is a polite way of  informing a man that you and he are not likely to do business; in other  words, that you are not in want of his money.  [FN#3] The Sufrah is a piece of leather well tanned, and generally of a  yellow colour, bordered with black. It is circular, has a few small  pouches for knives or spoons, and, by means of a thong run through  rings in the periphery, can be readily converted into a bag for  carrying provisions on a journey. Figuratively it is used for the meal  itself. \"Sufrah hazir\" means that dinner is upon the table.  [FN#4] The Salam at this hour of the morning is confined to the  devotions of Ramazan. The curious reader may consult Lane's Modern  Egyptians, chap. 25, for a long and accurate interpretation of these  words.  [FN#5] The summons to prayer.  [FN#6] In the Mohammedan church every act of devotion must be preceded  by what is called its Niyat, or purpose. This intention must be either  mentally conceived, or, as the more general rule is, audibly expressed.  For instance, the worshipper will begin with \"I purpose to pray the  four-bows of mid-day prayer to Allah the Almighty,\" and then he will  proceed to the act of worship. Moslems of the Shafe'i faith must  perform the Niyat of fasting every night for the ensuing day; the  Malikis, on the other hand, \"purpose\" abstinence but once for the  thirty days of Ramazan. Lane tells a pleasant tale of a thief in the  Mosque saying, \"I purpose (before prayer) to carry off this nice pair  of new shoes!\"  [FN#7] Many go to sleep immediately after the Imsak, or about a quarter  of an hour before the dawn prayer, and do not perform their morning  devotions till they awake. But this is not, strictly speaking, correct.  [FN#8] When the late Pasha of Egypt (H.H. Abbas Hilmi) came to power,  he built a large pile of palace close outside the walls of Cairo, on  the direction of Suez, and induced his courtiers to follow his example.  This was done readily enough, for Asiatics, like Europeans, enjoy the  fine air of the desert after the rank atmosphere of towns and cities.  If the successor of His Highness does not follow the usual Oriental  method of wiping away all vestiges of the predecessor, except his  grave, there will be, at no distant period, a second Cairo on the site  of the Abbasiyah.  [FN#9] One of our wants is a history of the bell and its succedanai.  Strict Moslems have an aversion to all modifications of this  instrument, striking clocks, gongs, &c., because they were considered  by the Prophet peculiar to the devotions of Christians. He, therefore,  instituted the Azan, or call to prayer, and his followers still clap  their hands when we should ring for a servant. The symbolical meaning  of the bell, as shown in the sistrum of Isis, seems to be the movement  and mixture of the elements, which is denoted by clattering noise.  \"Hence,\" observes a learned antiquary, \"the ringing of bells and  clattering of plates of metal were used in all lustrations, sacrifices,  &c.\" We find them amongst the Jews, worn by the high priest; the Greeks  attached them to images of Priapus, and the Buddhists of Thibet still  use them in their worship, as do the Catholics of Rome when elevating  the Host.  [FN#10] Al-Ghada is the early dinner: Al-Asha, the supper, eaten  shortly after sunset. (See Lane's Modern Egyptians, Chap. 5.)  [FN#11] Extra prayers repeated in the month of Ramazan. (Lane, Chap.  25, \"Tarawih.\") They take about an hour, consisting of 23 prostrations,  with the Salam (or blessing on the Prophet) after every second  prostration.  [FN#12] The Shisha, or Egyptian and Syrian water-pipe, is too well  known to require any description. It is filled with a kind of tobacco  called Tumbak, for which see Chap. 4 of this Volume.  [FN#13] Strangers often wonder to see a kind of cemetery let into a  dwelling-house in a crowded street. The reason is, that some obstinate  saint has insisted upon being buried there, by the simple process of  weighing so heavily in his bier, that the bearers have been obliged to  place him on the pavement. Of course, no good Moslem would object to  have his ground floor occupied by the corpse of a holy man. The reader  will not forget, that in Europe statues have the whims which dead  bodies exhibit in Egypt. So, according to the Abbe Marche, the little  statue of Our Lady, lately found in the forest of Pennacom, \"became,  notwithstanding her small size, heavy as a mountain, and would not  consent to be removed by any one but the chaplain of the chateau.\"  [FN#14] Europeans compare \"Kara Gyuz\" to our Chinese shadows. He is the  Turkish \"Punch,\" and his pleasantries may remind the traveller of what  he has read concerning the Mines and Fescennine performances of the  Romans. On more than one occasion, Kara Gyuz has been reported to the  police for scandalously jibing and deriding consuls, Frank merchants,  and even Turkish dignitaries.  [FN#15] Mohammed Ali drained and planted the Azbakiyah, which, before  his day, was covered with water and mud long after the inundation had  ceased. The Egyptians extract a perfume, an aphrodisiac, which they  call \"Fitnah,\" from this kind of Acacia.  [FN#16] All \"Agapemones\" are at this time suppressed, by order of His  Highness (Abbas Pasha), whose august mother occasionally insisted upon  banishing whole colleges of Ambubaiae to Upper Egypt. As might be  expected, this proceeding had a most injurious effect upon the morals  of society.
