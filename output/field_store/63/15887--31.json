This, in  this case appears credible. But if the triangle _n p g_ were not  illuminated by the two lights _g_ and _h_, but by _i p_ and _g_ and  _k_ neither side is lighted by more than one single light: that is  _i p_ is invisible to _h g_ and _k_ will never be lighted by _g_;  hence _p q_ will be twice as light as the two visible portions that  are in shadow.    [Footnote: 5--6. This passage is so obscure that it would be rash to  offer an explanation. Several words seem to have been omitted.]    On the relative depth of cast shadows (200-202).    200.    A spot is most in the shade when a large number of darkened rays  fall upon it. The spot which receives the rays at the widest angle  and by darkened rays will be most in the dark; a will be twice as  dark as b, because it originates from twice as large a base at an  equal distance. A spot is most illuminated when a large number of  luminous rays fall upon it. d is the beginning of the shadow _d f_,  and tinges _c_ but _a_ little; _d e_ is half of the shadow _d f_ and  gives a deeper tone where it is cast at _b_ than at _f_. And the  whole shaded space _e_ gives its tone to the spot _a_. [Footnote:  The diagram here referred to is on Pl. XLI, No. 2.]    201.    _A n_ will be darker than _c r_ in proportion to the number of times  that _a b_ goes into _c d_.    202.    The shadow cast by an object on a plane will be smaller in  proportion as that object is lighted by feebler rays. Let _d e_ be  the object and _d c_ the plane surface; the number of times that _d  e_ will go into _f g_ gives the proportion of light at _f h_ to _d  c_. The ray of light will be weaker in proportion to its distance  from the hole through which it falls.    FIFTH BOOK ON LIGHT AND SHADE.    Principles of reflection (203. 204).    203.    OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE SHADOWS CAST BY OBJECTS OUGHT TO BE DEFINED.    If the object is the mountain here figured, and the light is at the  point _a_, I say that from _b d_ and also from _c f_ there will be  no light but from reflected rays. And this results from the fact  that rays of light can only act in straight lines; and the same is  the case with the secondary or reflected rays.    204.    The edges of the derived shadow are defined by the hues of the  illuminated objects surrounding the luminous body which produces the  shadow.    On reverberation.    205.    OF REVERBERATION.    Reverberation is caused by bodies of a bright nature with a flat and  semi opaque surface which, when the light strikes upon them, throw  it back again, like the rebound of a ball, to the former object.    WHERE THERE CAN BE NO REFLECTED LIGHTS.    All dense bodies have their surfaces occupied by various degrees of  light and shade. The lights are of two kinds, one called original,  the other borrowed. Original light is that which is inherent in the  flame of fire or the light of the sun or of the atmosphere. Borrowed  light will be reflected light; but to return to the promised  definition: I say that this luminous reverberation is not produced  by those portions of a body which are turned towards darkened  objects, such as shaded spots, fields with grass of various height,  woods whether green or bare; in which, though that side of each  branch which is turned towards the original light has a share of  that light, nevertheless the shadows cast by each branch separately  are so numerous, as well as those cast by one branch on the others,  that finally so much shadow is the result that the light counts for  nothing. Hence objects of this kind cannot throw any reflected light  on opposite objects.    Reflection on water (206. 207).    206.    PERSPECTIVE.    The shadow or object mirrored in water in motion, that is to say in  small wavelets, will always be larger than the external object  producing it.    207.    It is impossible that an object mirrored on water should correspond  in form to the object mirrored, since the centre of the eye is above  the surface of the water.    This is made plain in the figure here given, which demonstrates that  the eye sees the surface _a b_, and cannot see it at _l f_, and at  _r t_; it sees the surface of the image at _r t_, and does not see  it in the real object _c d_. Hence it is impossible to see it, as  has been said above unless the eye itself is situated on the surface  of the water as is shown below [13].    [Footnote: _A_ stands for _ochio_ [eye], _B_ for _aria_ [air], _C_  for _acqua_ [water], _D_ for _cateto_ [cathetus].--In the original  MS. the second diagram is placed below line 13.]    Experiments with the mirror (208-210).    208.    THE MIRROR.    If the illuminated object is of the same size as the luminous body  and as that in which the light is reflected, the amount of the  reflected light will bear the same proportion to the intermediate  light as this second light will bear to the first, if both bodies  are smooth and white.    209.    Describe how it is that no object has its limitation in the mirror  but in the eye which sees it in the mirror. For if you look at your  face in the mirror, the part resembles the whole in as much as the  part is everywhere in the mirror, and the whole is in every part of  the same mirror; and the same is true of the whole image of any  object placed opposite to this mirror, &c.    210.    No man can see the image of another man in a mirror in its proper  place with regard to the objects; because every object falls on [the  surface of] the mirror at equal angles. And if the one man, who sees  the other in the mirror, is not in a direct line with the image he  will not see it in the place where it really falls; and if he gets  into the line, he covers the other man and puts himself in the place  occupied by his image. Let _n o_ be the mirror, _b_ the eye of your  friend and _d_ your own eye. Your friend's eye will appear to you at  _a_, and to him it will seem that yours is at _c_, and the  intersection of the visual rays will occur at _m_, so that either of  you touching _m_ will touch the eye of the other man which shall be  open. And if you touch the eye of the other man in the mirror it  will seem to him that you are touching your own.    Appendix:--On shadows in movement (211. 212).    211.    OF THE SHADOW AND ITS MOTION.    When two bodies casting shadows, and one in front of the other, are  between a window and the wall with some space between them, the  shadow of the body which is nearest to the plane of the wall will  move if the body nearest to the window is put in transverse motion  across the window. To prove this let _a_ and _b_ be two bodies  placed between the window _n m_ and the plane surface _o p_ with  sufficient space between them as shown by the space _a b_. I say  that if the body _a_ is moved towards _s_ the shadow of the body _b_  which is at _c_ will move towards _d_.    212.    OF THE MOTION OF SHADOWS.    The motion of a shadow is always more rapid than that of the body  which produces it if the light is stationary. To prove this let _a_  be the luminous body, and _b_ the body casting the shadow, and _d_  the shadow. Then I say that in the time while the solid body moves  from _b_ to _c_, the shadow _d_ will move to _e_; and this  proportion in the rapidity of the movements made in the same space  of time, is equal to that in the length of the space moved over.  Thus, given the proportion of the space moved over by the body _b_  to _c_, to that moved over by the shadow _d_ to _e_, the proportion  in the rapidity of their movements will be the same.    But if the luminous body is also in movement with a velocity equal  to that of the solid body, then the shadow and the body that casts  it will move with equal speed. And if the luminous body moves more  rapidly than the solid body, the motion of the shadow will be slower  than that of the body casting it.    But if the luminous body moves more slowly than the solid body, then  the shadow will move more rapidly than that body.    SIXTH BOOK ON LIGHT AND SHADE.    The effect of rays passing through holes (213. 214).    213.    PERSPECTIVE.    If you transmit the rays of the sun through a hole in the shape of a  star you will see a beautiful effect of perspective in the spot  where the sun's rays fall.    [Footnote: In this and the following chapters of MS. C the order of  the original paging has been adhered to, and is shown in  parenthesis. Leonardo himself has but rarely worked out the subject  of these propositions. The space left for the purpose has  occasionally been made use of for quite different matter. Even the  numerous diagrams, most of them very delicately sketched, lettered  and numbered, which occur on these pages, are hardly ever explained,  with the exception of those few which are here given.]    214.    No small hole can so modify the convergence of rays of light as to  prevent, at a long distance, the transmission of the true form of  the luminous body causing them. It is impossible that rays of light  passing through a parallel [slit], should not display the form of  the body causing them, since all the effects produced by a luminous  body are [in fact] the reflection of that body: The moon, shaped  like a boat, if transmitted through a hole is figured in the surface  [it falls on] as a boatshaped object. [Footnote 8: In the MS. a  blank space is left after this question.] Why the eye sees bodies at  a distance, larger than they measure on the vertical plane?.    [Footnote: This chapter, taken from another MS. may, as an  exception, be placed here, as it refers to the same subject as the  preceding section.]    On gradation of shadows (215. 216).    215.    Although the breadth and length of lights and shadow will be  narrower and shorter in foreshortening, the quality and quantity of  the light and shade is not increased nor diminished.

Then he made coffee in a cup, cooked some  slices of bacon on the end of a stick, and took a couple of hard  biscuits from a saddlebag.  Of these his meal consisted.  After that he  removed the halter from Blanco Sol, intending to leave him free to  graze for a while.    Then Gale returned to his little fire, replenished it with short sticks  of dead greasewood and mesquite, and, wrapping his blanket round his  shoulders he sat down to warm himself and to wait till it was time to  bring in the horse and tie him up.    The fire was inadequate and Gale was cold and wet with dew. Hunger and  thirst were with him.  His bones ached, and there was a dull,  deep-seated pain throbbing in his unhealed wound.  For days unshaven,  his beard seemed like a million pricking needles in his blistered skin.  He was so tired that once having settled himself, he did not move hand  or foot.  The night was dark, dismal, cloudy, windy, growing colder.  A  moan of wind in the mesquite was occasionally pierced by the high-keyed  yelp of a coyote.  There were lulls in which the silence seemed to be a  thing of stifling, encroaching substance--a thing that enveloped,  buried the desert.    Judged by the great average of ideals and conventional standards of  life, Dick Gale was a starved, lonely, suffering, miserable wretch.  But in his case the judgment would have hit only externals, would have  missed the vital inner truth.  For Gale was happy with a kind of  strange, wild glory in the privations, the pains, the perils, and the  silence and solitude to be endured on this desert land. In the past he  had not been of any use to himself or others; and he had never know  what it meant to be hungry, cold, tired, lonely.  He had never worked  for anything.  The needs of the day had been provided, and to-morrow  and the future looked the same. Danger, peril, toil--these had been  words read in books and papers.    In the present he used his hands, his senses, and his wits.  He had a  duty to a man who relied on his services.  He was a comrade, a friend,  a valuable ally to riding, fighting rangers.  He had spent endless  days, weeks that seemed years, alone with a horse, trailing over,  climbing over, hunting over a desert that was harsh and hostile by  nature, and perilous by the invasion of savage men.  That horse had  become human to Gale.  And with him Gale had learned to know the simple  needs of existence.  Like dead scales the superficialities, the  falsities, the habits that had once meant all of life dropped off,  useless things in this stern waste of rock and sand.    Gale's happiness, as far as it concerned the toil and strife, was  perhaps a grim and stoical one.  But love abided with him, and it had  engendered and fostered other undeveloped traits--romance and a feeling  for beauty, and a keen observation of nature.  He felt pain, but he was  never miserable.  He felt the solitude, but he was never lonely.    As he rode across the desert, even though keen eyes searched for the  moving black dots, the rising puffs of white dust that were warnings,  he saw Nell's face in every cloud.  The clean-cut mesas took on the  shape of her straight profile, with its strong chin and lips, its fine  nose and forehead.  There was always a glint of gold or touch of red or  graceful line or gleam of blue to remind him of her.  Then at night her  face shone warm and glowing, flushing and paling, in the campfire.    To-night, as usual, with a keen ear to the wind, Gale listened as one  on guard; yet he watched the changing phantom of a sweet face in the  embers, and as he watched he thought.  The desert developed and  multiplied thought.  A thousand sweet faces glowed in the pink and  white ashes of his campfire, the faces of other sweethearts or wives  that had gleamed for other men.  Gale was happy in his thought of Nell,  for Nell, for something, when he was alone this way in the wilderness,  told him she was near him, she thought of him, she loved him.  But  there were many men alone on that vast southwestern plateau, and when  they saw dream faces, surely for some it was a fleeting flash, a gleam  soon gone, like the hope and the name and the happiness that had been  and was now no more.  Often Gale thought of those hundreds of desert  travelers, prospectors, wanderers who had ventured down the Camino del  Diablo, never to be heard of again.  Belding had told him of that most  terrible of all desert trails--a trail of shifting sands.  Lash had  traversed it, and brought back stories of buried waterholes, of bones  bleaching white in the sun, of gold mines as lost as were the  prospectors who had sought them, of the merciless Yaqui and his hatred  for the Mexican.  Gale thought of this trail and the men who had camped  along it.  For many there had been one night, one campfire that had  been the last.  This idea seemed to creep in out of the darkness, the  loneliness, the silence, and to find a place in Gale's mind, so that it  had strange fascination for him. He knew now as he had never dreamed  before how men drifted into the desert, leaving behind graves, wrecked  homes, ruined lives, lost wives and sweethearts.  And for every  wanderer every campfire had a phantom face.  Gale measured the agony of  these men at their last campfire by the joy and promise he traced in  the ruddy heart of his own.    By and by Gale remembered what he was waiting for; and, getting up, he  took the halter and went out to find Blanco Sol.  It was pitch-dark  now, and Gale could not see a rod ahead.  He felt his way, and  presently as he rounded a mesquite he saw Sol's white shape outlined  against the blackness.  The horse jumped and wheeled, ready to run.  It  was doubtful if any one unknown to Sol could ever have caught him.  Gale's low call reassured him, and he went on grazing.  Gale haltered  him in the likeliest patch of grass and returned to his camp.  There he  lifted his saddle into a protected spot under a low wall of the mound,  and, laying one blanket on the sand, he covered himself with the other  and stretched himself for the night.    Here he was out of reach of the wind; but he heard its melancholy moan  in the mesquite.  There was no other sound.  The coyotes had ceased  their hungry cries.  Gale dropped to sleep, and slept soundly during  the first half of the night; and after that he seemed always to be  partially awake, aware of increasing cold and damp. The dark mantle  turned gray, and then daylight came quickly.  The morning was clear and  nipping cold.  He threw off the wet blanket and got up cramped and half  frozen.  A little brisk action was all that was necessary to warm his  blood and loosen his muscles, and then he was fresh, tingling, eager.  The sun rose in a golden blaze, and the descending valley took on  wondrous changing hues.  Then he fetched up Blanco Sol, saddled him,  and tied him to the thickest clump of mesquite.    \"Sol, we'll have a drink pretty soon,\" he said, patting the splendid  neck.    Gale meant it.  He would not eat till he had watered his horse. Sol had  gone nearly forty-eight hours without a sufficient drink, and that was  long enough, even for a desert-bred beast.  No three raiders could keep  Gale away from that well.  Taking his rifle in hand, he faced up the  arroyo.  Rabbits were frisking in the short willows, and some were so  tame he could have kicked them.  Gale walked swiftly for a goodly part  of the distance, and then, when he saw blue smoke curling up above the  trees, he proceeded slowly, with alert eye and ear.  From the lay of  the land and position of trees seen by daylight, he found an easier and  safer course that the one he had taken in the dark.  And by careful  work he was enabled to get closer to the well, and somewhat above it.    The Mexicans were leisurely cooking their morning meal.  They had two  fires, one for warmth, the other to cook over.  Gale had an idea these  raiders were familiar to him.  It seemed all these border hawks  resembled one another--being mostly small of build, wiry, angular,  swarthy-faced, and black-haired, and they wore the oddly styled Mexican  clothes and sombreros.  A slow wrath stirred in Gale as he watched the  trio.  They showed not the slightest indication of breaking camp.  One  fellow, evidently the leader, packed a gun at his hip, the only weapon  in sight.  Gale noted this with speculative eyes.  The raiders had  slept inside the little adobe house, and had not yet brought out the  carbines. Next Gale swept his gaze to the corral, in which he saw more  than a dozen horses, some of them fine animals.  They were stamping and  whistling, fighting one another, and pawing the dirt.  This was  entirely natural behavior for desert horses penned in when they wanted  to get at water and grass.    But suddenly one of the blacks, a big, shaggy fellow, shot up his ears  and pointed his nose over the top of the fence.  He whistled. Other  horses looked in the same direction, and their ears went up, and they,  too, whistled.  Gale knew that other horses or men, very likely both,  were approaching.  But the Mexicans did not hear the alarm, or show any  interest if they did.  These mescal-drinking raiders were not scouts.  It was notorious how easily they could be surprised or ambushed.  Mostly they were ignorant, thick-skulled peons.  They were wonderful  horsemen, and could go long without food or water; but they had not  other accomplishments or attributes calculated to help them in desert  warfare.  They had poor sight, poor hearing, poor judgment, and when  excited they resembled crazed ants running wild.    Gale saw two Indians on burros come riding up the other side of the  knoll upon which the adobe house stood; and apparently they were not  aware of the presence of the Mexicans, for they came on up the path.  One Indian was a Papago.  The other, striking in appearance for other"]]]
