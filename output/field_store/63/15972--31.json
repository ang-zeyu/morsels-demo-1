Your mistress is a  stranger here, and in the hands of enemies. I may be of use to her. I know  this population of Paris, and can perhaps give her better information of  what is going on both at the court and in the gutter than any other man,  and may be able to render her assistance when she most needs it; and would  ask but in payment that, should I come to England, she will extend her  protection to my daughter until I can find a home and place her there. You  see I am playing an open game with you.\"    \"I will reply as frankly,\" Guy said. \"When I came in here it was, as I  told the man-at-arms my companion, with the thought that one who had  noticed us so shrewdly, and had recognized me so quickly in the crowd, was  no ordinary mountebank, but a keen, shrewd man who had some motive for  thus addressing me, and I see that my view was a right one. As to your  proposal I can say naught before I have laid it before my mistress, but  for myself I may say at once that it recommends itself to me as excellent.  We are, as you say, strangers here, and know of no one from whom we might  obtain information as to what is going on. My mistress, if not an actual  prisoner, is practically so, being held with her children as hostages for  my lord's loyalty to France. She is the kindest of ladies, and should she  authorize me to enter into further communication with you, you may be sure  that she would execute to the full the undertaking you ask for on behalf  of your daughter. Where can I see you again? This is scarce a place I  could often resort to without my visits being noticed, if, as is likely  enough, the Duke of Burgundy may occasionally set spies to inform him as  to what we are doing, and whether my mistress is in communication with any  who are regarded as either doubtful or hostile to his faction.\"    \"If you will be in front of Notre Dame this evening at nine o'clock, I  will meet you there and conduct you to my abode, where you can visit me  free of any fear of observation.\"    \"What name shall I call you?\" Guy asked.    \"My name is Montepone. I belong to a noble family of Mantua, but mixing  myself up with the factions there, I was on the losing side, and  unfortunately it happened that in a fray I killed a noble connected with  all the ruling families; sentence of death was passed upon me in my  absence, my property was confiscated. Nowhere in Italy should I have been  safe from the dagger of the assassin, therefore I fled to France, and for  ten years have maintained myself by the two arts which so often go  together, astrology and buffoonery. I had always been fond of knowledge,  and had learned all that could be taught in the grand science of  astrology, so that however much I may gull fools here, I have obtained the  confidence of many powerful personages by the accuracy of my forecasts.  Had Orleans but believed my solemn assurance he would not have ridden  through the streets of Paris to his death that night, and in other cases  where I have been more trusted I have rendered valuable assistance.\"    The belief in astrology had never gained much hold upon the mass of the  English people, many as were the superstitions that prevailed among them.  Guy had never even given the matter a thought. Montepone, however,  evidently believed in his powers of foreseeing the future, and such powers  did not in themselves seem altogether impossible to the lad; he therefore  made no direct reply, but saying that he would not fail to be at the  appointed place at nine that evening, took his leave.    \"Truly, Master Guy, I began to be uneasy about you,\" Robert Picard said  when he rejoined him, \"and was meditating whether I had best enter the  tent, and demand what had become of you. It was only the thought that  there might have been others before you, and that you had to wait your  turn before seeing him, that restrained me. You have not been taking his  nostrums, I trust; for they say that some of those men sell powders by  which a man can be changed into a wolf.\"    Guy laughed. \"I have taken nothing, Robert, and if I had I should have no  fear of such a change happening to me. I have but talked to the man as to  how he came to know me, and it is as I thought,--he saw us as we entered.  He is a shrewd fellow, and may well be of some use to us.\"    \"I like not chaffering with men who have intercourse with the devil,\"  Picard said, shaking his head gravely; \"nothing good comes of it. My  mother knew a man who bought a powder that was to cure his wife of  jealousy; and indeed it did, for it straightway killed her, and he was  hung. I think that I can stand up against mortal man as well as another,  but my blood ran cold when I saw you enter yon tent, and I fell into a  sweat at your long absence.\"    \"The man is not of that kind, Robert, so you can reassure yourself. I  doubt not that the nostrums he sells are perfectly harmless, and that  though they may not cure they will certainly not kill.\"    They made their way back to the house of the provost of the silversmiths.    \"Well, what do you think of Paris, Guy?\" Dame Margaret asked when he  entered.    \"It is a fine city, no doubt, lady, but in truth I would rather be in the  country than in this wilderness of narrow streets. But indeed I have had  somewhat of an adventure, and one which I think may prove of advantage;\"  and he then related to his mistress his visit to the booth of the supposed  doctor.    \"Do you think that he is honest, Guy?\" she asked when he concluded.    \"I think so, madam. He spoke honestly enough, and there was a ring of  truth in what he said; nor do I see that he could have had any motive for  making my acquaintance save what he stated. His story seemed to me to be a  natural one; but I shall be able to judge better when I see him in his own  house and with this daughter he speaks of; that is, if your ladyship is  willing that I should meet him.\"    \"I am willing enough,\" she said, \"for even if he is a spy of Burgundy's  there is nothing that we wish to conceal. I have come here willingly, and  have no thought of making my escape, or of mixing myself up in any of the  intrigues of the court. Therefore there is no harm that he can do us,  while on the other hand you may learn much from him, and will gather in a  short time whether he can be trusted. Then by all means go and meet him  this evening. But it would be as well to take Tom with you. It does not  seem to me at all likely that any plot can be intended, but at any rate it  will be well that you should have one with you whom you can thoroughly  trust, in case there is any snare set, and to guard you against any  lurking cut-throats.\"    \"I will tell him to be in readiness to go with me. It will be his turn to  go out with one of the others this evening, and he might not be back in  time if I did not warn him.\"    \"What arms shall I take with me?\" Long Tom said, when Guy told him of  their expedition.    \"Nothing but your sword and quarter-staff. I see that many of the beggars  and others that one meets in the streets carry long staffs, and yours is  not much longer than the generality. You brought it tied up with your bow,  so you would do well to carry it, for in a street broil, where there is  room to swing it, you could desire no better weapon, in such strong hands  as yours, Tom. Besides, you can knock down and disable with it and no  great harm is done, whereas if you used your sword there would be dead  men; and although by all I hear these are not uncommon objects in the  streets of Paris, there might be trouble if the town watch came up, as we  are strangers. I shall carry a stout cudgel myself, as well as my sword.\"    Accordingly at half-past eight they set out. Guy put on a long cloak and a  cap such as was worn by the citizens, but strengthened inside by a few  bands of steel forming sufficient protection to the head against any  ordinary blow. This he had purchased at a stall on his way home. Tom had  put on the garments that had been bought for him that afternoon,  consisting of a doublet of tanned leather that could be worn under armour  or for ordinary use, and was thick enough to afford considerable  protection. The streets were already almost deserted; those who were  abroad hurried along looking with suspicion at all whom they met, and  walking in the middle of the road so as to avoid being taken by surprise  by anyone lurking in the doorways or at the corners of alleys. Once or  twice men came out and stared at Guy and his companion by the light of the  lanterns suspended across the streets, but there was nothing about their  appearance to encourage an attack, and the stalwart figure of the archer  promised hard blows rather than plunder. Arriving at the square in front  of Notre Dame they waited awhile. Here there were still people about, for  it was a rendezvous both for roistering young gallants, thieves, and  others starting on midnight adventures. After walking backwards and  forwards two or three times Guy said, \"You had best stand here in the  shadow of this buttress while I go and place myself beneath that hanging  lamp; seeing that we are together, and he, looking perhaps only for one,  may not recognize me.\"    On reaching the lamp, Guy took off his hat, so that the light should fall  on his face, waited for a minute, and then replaced it. As soon as he did  so a slightly-built lad came up to him.    \"Were you not at the fair by the river to-day, sir, and are you not  expecting some one to meet you here?\"    \"That is so, lad. If you will tell me whom I am expecting I shall know  that he has sent you, though, indeed, I looked to meet himself and not a  messenger.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7065"],[0,"Children of the Bush (#20)"],[1,"that hurries most men to  hell--especially in the Bush. When a man firmly believes he is a  hopeless case, then there's no hope for him: but let him have doubts and  there's a chance. Make him believe that there are far worse cases than  his. We wouldn't preach the sin of dissipation to him, no--but we'd try  to show him the _folly_ of a wasted life. I ought to be able to preach  that, God knows.    \"And, above all, we'd try to drive out of his head the cursed old  popular idea that it's hard to reform--that a man's got to fight a hard  battle with himself to get away from drink--pity drunkards can't believe  how easy it is. And we'd put it to him straight whether his few hours'  enjoyment were worth the days he had to suffer hell for it.\"    \"And, likely as not,\" I said, \"when you'd put him on his feet he'd take  the nearest track to the next shanty, and go on a howling spree, and  come back to Lost Souls' in a week, raving aid worse than ever. What  would you do then?\"    \"We'd take him in again, and build him up some more; and a third or  fourth time if necessary. I believe in going right on with a thing once  I take it in hand. And if he didn't turn up after the last spree we'd  look for him up the scrub and bring him in and let him die on a bed, and  make his death as comfortable as possible. I've seen one man die on the  ground, and found one dead in the bush. We'd bury him under a gum and  put `Sacred to the Memory of a Man who Died. (Let him R.I.P.)' over him.  I'd have a nice little graveyard, with gums for tombstones--and I'd have  some original epitaphs--I promise you.\"    \"And how much gratitude would you expect to get out of the Lost Souls'  Hotel?\" I asked.    \"None,\" said Mitchell, promptly. \"It wouldn't be a Gratitude Discovery  Syndicate. People might say that the Lost Souls' Hotel was a den for  kidnapping women and girls to be used as decoys for the purpose of  hocussing and robbing bushmen, and the law and retribution might come  after me--but I'd fight the thing out. Or they might want to make a  K.C.M.G., or a god of me, and worship me before they hung me. I reckon  a philanthropist or reformer is lucky if he escapes with a whole skin  in the end, let alone his character-- But there!-- Talking of gratitude:  it's the fear of ingratitude that keeps thousands from doing good. It's  just as paltry and selfish and cowardly as any other fear that curses  the world--it's rather more selfish than most fears, in fact--take  the fear of being thought a coward, or being considered eccentric, or  conceited, or affected, or too good, or too bad, for instance. The man  that's always canting about the world's ingratitude has no gratitude  owing to him as a rule--generally the reverse--he ought to be grateful  to the world for being let live. He broods over the world's ingratitude  until he gets to be a cynic. He sees the world like the outside of a  window, as it were, with the blind drawn and the dead, cold moonlight  shining on it, and he passes on with a sour face; whereas, if he took  the trouble to step inside he'd most likely find a room full of ruddy  firelight, and sympathy and cheerfulness, and kindness, and love, and  gratitude. Sometimes, when he's right down on his uppers, and forced to  go amongst people and hustle for bread, he gets a lot of surprises at  the amount of kindness he keeps running against in the world--and in  places where he'd never have expected to find it. But--ah, well! I'm  getting maudlin.\"    \"And you've forgot all about the Lost Souls' Hotel,\" I said.    \"No, I haven't,\" said Mitchell; \"I'd fix that up all right. As soon  as I'd got things going smoothly under a man I could trust, I'd tie up  every penny I had for the benefit of the concern; get some `white men'  for trustees, and take the track again. I'm getting too old to stay long  in one place--(I'm a lost soul that always got along better in another  place). I'm so used to the track that if I was shut up in a house I'd  get walking up and down in my room of nights and disturb the folk; and,  besides, I'd feel lost and light-shouldered without the swag.\"    \"So you'd put all your money in the concern?\"    \"Yes--except a pound or two to go on the track with--for, who knows, I  might come along there, dusty and tired, and ragged and hard up and old,  some day, and be very glad of a night's rest at the Lost Souls' Hotel.  But I wouldn't let on that I was old Mitchell, the millionaire, who  founded Lost Souls'. They might be too officious, and I hate fuss....  But it's time to take the track, Harry.\"    There came a cool breeze with sunset; we stood up stiffly, shouldered  our swags and tucker-bags, and pushed on, for we had to make the next  water before we camped. We were out of tobacco, so we borrowed some from  one of the bullock-drivers.          THE BOOZERS' HOME      \"A dipsomaniac,\" said Mitchell, \"needs sympathy and commonsense  treatment. (Sympathy's a grand and glorious thing, taking it all round  and looking at it any way you will: a little of it makes a man think  that the world's a good world after all, and there's room and hope for  sinners, and that life's worth living; enough of it makes him sure of  it: and an overdose of sympathy makes a man _feel_ weak and ashamed of  himself, and so moves him to stop whining--and wining--and buck up.)    \"Now, I'm not taking the case of a workman who goes on the spree on  pay night and sweats the drink out of himself at work next day, nor a  slum-bred brute who guzzles for the love of it; but a man with brains,  who drinks to drown his intellect or his memory. He's generally a man  under it all, and a sensitive, generous, gentle man with finer feelings  as often as not. The best and cleverest and whitest men in the world  seem to take to drink mostly. It's an awful pity. Perhaps it's because  they're straight and the world's crooked and they can see things too  plain. And I suppose in the bush the loneliness and the thoughts of the  girl-world they left behind help to sink 'em.    \"Now a drunkard seldom reforms at home, because he's always surrounded  by the signs of the ruin and misery he has brought on the home; and  the sight and thought of it sets him off again before he's had time to  recover from the last spree. Then, again, the noblest wife in the  world mostly goes the wrong way to work with a drunken husband--nearly  everything she does is calculated to irritate him. If, for instance,  he brings a bottle home from the pub, it shows that he wants to stay at  home and not go back to the pub any more; but the first thing the wife  does is to get hold of the bottle and plant it, or smash it before his  eyes, and that maddens him in the state he is in then.    \"No. A dipsomaniac needs to be taken away from home for a while. I knew  a man that got so bad that the way he acted at home one night frightened  him, and next morning he went into an inebriate home of his own  accord--to a place where his friends had been trying to get him for a  year past. For the first day or two he was nearly dead with remorse and  shame--mostly shame; and he didn't know what they were going to do to  him next--and he only wanted them to kill him quick and be done with it.  He reckons he felt as bad as if he was in jail. But there were ten  other patients there, and one or two were worse than he was, and that  comforted him a lot. They compared notes and sympathized and helped each  other. They discovered that all their wives were noble women. He  struck one or two surprises too--one of the patients was a doctor who'd  attended him one time, and another was an old boss of his, and they  got very chummy. And there was a man there who was standing for  Parliament--he was supposed to be having a rest down the coast.... Yes,  my old mate felt very bad for the first day or two; it was all Yes,  Nurse, and Thank you, Nurse, and Yes, Doctor, and No, Doctor, and  Thank you, Doctor. But, inside a week, he was calling the doctor 'Ol'  Pill-Box' behind his back, and making love to one of the nurses.    \"But he said it was pitiful when women relatives came to visit patients  the first morning. It shook the patients up a lot, but I reckon it  did 'em good. There were well-bred old lady mothers in black, and  hard-working, haggard wives and loving daughters--and the expressions of  sympathy and faith and hope in those women's faces! My old mate said  it was enough in itself to make a man swear off drink for ever.... Ah,  God--what a world it is!    \"Reminds me how I once went with the wife of another old mate of mine to  see him. He was in a lunatic asylum. It was about the worst hour I ever  had in my life, and I've had some bad ones. The way she tried to coax  him back to his old self. She thought she could do it when all the  doctors had failed. But I'll tell you about him some other time.    \"The old mate said that the principal part of the treatment was supposed  to be injection of bi-chloride of gold or something, and it was supposed  to be a secret. It might have been water and sugar for all he knew, and  he thought it was. You see, when patients got better they were allowed  out, two by two, on their honour--one to watch the other--and it worked.  But it was necessary to have an extra hold on them; so they were  told that if they were a minute late for `treatment,' or missed one  injection, all the good would be undone. This was dinged into their ears  all the time. Same as many things are done in the Catholic religion--to  hold the people. My old mate said that, as far as the medical treatment  was concerned, he could do all that was necessary himself. But it was  the sympathy that counted, especially the sympathy between the patients  themselves. They always got hold of a new patient and talked to him  and cheered him up; he nearly always came in thinking he was the most  miserable wretch in this world. And it comforts a man and strengthens  him and makes him happier to"]]]
