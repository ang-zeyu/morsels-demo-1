'What are you going to do?'    'I'm going to take his advice, and buck up.'    II    He did. At the beginning of the game the ropes were lined by some  thirty spectators, who had come to derive a languid enjoyment from  seeing the First pile up a record score. By half-time their numbers had  risen to an excited mob of something over three hundred, and the second  half of the game was fought out to the accompaniment of a storm of  yells and counter yells such as usually only belonged to  school-matches. The Second Fifteen, after a poor start, suddenly awoke  to the fact that this was not going to be the conventional massacre by  any means. The First had scored an unconverted try five minutes after  the kick-off, and it was after this that the Second began to get  together. The school back bungled the drop out badly, and had to find  touch in his own twenty-five, and after that it was anyone's game. The  scrums were a treat to behold. Payne was a monument of strength. Time  after time the Second had the ball out to their three-quarters, and  just after half-time Bowden slipped through in the corner. The kick  failed, and the two teams, with their scores equal now, settled down  grimly to fight the thing out to a finish. But though they remained on  their opponents' line for most of the rest of the game, the Second did  not add to their score, and the match ended in a draw of three points  all.    The first intimation Grey received of this came to him late in the  evening. He had been reading a novel which, whatever its other merits  may have been, was not interesting, and it had sent him to sleep. He  awoke to hear a well-known voice observe with some unction: 'Ah! M'yes.  Leeches and hot fomentations.' This effectually banished sleep. If  there were two things in the world that he loathed, they were leeches  and hot fomentations, and the School doctor apparently regarded them as  a panacea for every kind of bodily ailment, from a fractured skull to a  cold in the head. It was this gentleman who had just spoken, but Grey's  alarm vanished as he perceived that the words had no personal  application to himself. The object of the remark was a fellow-sufferer  in the next bed but one. Now Grey was certain that when he had fallen  asleep there had been nobody in that bed. When, therefore, the medical  expert had departed on his fell errand, the quest of leeches and hot  fomentations, he sat up and gave tongue.    'Who's that in that bed?' he asked.    'Hullo, Grey,' replied a voice. 'Didn't know you were awake. I've come  to keep you company.'    'That you, Barrett? What's up with you?'    'Collar-bone. Dislocated it or something. Reade's over in that corner.  He has bust his ankle. Oh, yes, we've been having a nice, cheery  afternoon,' concluded Barrett bitterly.    'Great Scott! How did it happen?'    'Payne.'    'Where? In your collar-bone?'    'Yes. That wasn't what I meant, though. What I was explaining was that  Payne got hold of me in the middle of the field, and threw me into  touch. After which he fell on me. That was enough for my simple needs.  I'm not grasping.'    'How about Reade?'    'The entire Second scrum collapsed on top of Reade. When we dug him out  his ankle was crocked. Mainspring gone, probably. Then they gathered up  the pieces and took them gently away. I don't know how it all ended.'    Just then Walkinshaw burst into the room. He had a large bruise over  one eye, his arm was in a sling, and he limped. But he was in excellent  spirits.    'I knew I was right, by Jove,' he observed to Grey. 'I knew he could  buck up if he liked.'    'I know it now,' said Barrett.    'Who's this you're talking about?' said Grey.    'Payne. I've never seen anything like the game he played today. He was  everywhere. And, by Jove, his _tackling_!'    'Don't,' said Barrett, wearily.    'It's the best match I ever played in,' said Walkinshaw, bubbling over  with enthusiasm. 'Do you know, the Second had all the best of the  game.'    'What was the score?'    'Draw. One try all.'    'And now I suppose you're satisfied?' enquired Barrett. The great  scheme for the regeneration of Payne had been confided to him by its  proud patentee.    'Almost,' said Walkinshaw. 'We'll continue the treatment for one more  game, and then we'll have him simply fizzing for the Windybury match.  That's next Saturday. By the way, I'm afraid you'll hardly be fit again  in time for that, Barrett, will you?'    'I may possibly,' said Barrett, coldly, 'be getting about again in time  for the Windybury match of the year after next. This year I'm afraid I  shall not have the pleasure. And I should strongly advise you, if you  don't want to have to put a team of cripples into the field, to  discontinue the treatment, as you call it.'    'Oh, I don't know,' said Walkinshaw.    On the following Wednesday evening, at five o'clock, something was  carried in on a stretcher, and deposited in the bed which lay between  Grey and Barrett. Close scrutiny revealed the fact that it was what had  once been Charles Augustus Walkinshaw. He was slightly broken up.    'Payne?' enquired Grey in chilly tones.    Walkinshaw admitted the impeachment.    Grey took a pencil and a piece of paper from the table at his side. 'If  you want to know what I'm doing,' he said, 'I'm writing out the team  for the Windybury match, and I'm going to make Payne captain, as the  senior Second Fifteen man. And if we win I'm jolly well going to give  him his cap after the match. If we don't win, it'll be the fault of a  raving lunatic of the name of Walkinshaw, with his beastly Colney Hatch  schemes for reforming slack forwards. You utter rotter!'    Fortunately for the future peace of mind of C. A. Walkinshaw, the  latter contingency did not occur. The School, in spite of its  absentees, contrived to pull the match off by a try to _nil_.  Payne, as was only right and proper, scored the try, making his way  through the ranks of the visiting team with the quiet persistence of a  steam-roller. After the game he came to tea, by request, at the  infirmary, and was straightaway invested by Grey with his First Fifteen  colours. On his arrival he surveyed the invalids with interest.    'Rough game, footer,' he observed at length.    'Don't mention it,' said Barrett politely. 'Leeches,' he added  dreamily. 'Leeches and hot fomentations. _Boiling_ fomentations.  Will somebody kindly murder Walkinshaw!'    'Why?' asked Payne, innocently.          [10]    AUTHOR!      J. S. M. Babington, of Dacre's House, was on the horns of a dilemma.  Circumstances over which he had had no control had brought him, like  another Hercules, to the cross-roads, and had put before him the choice  between pleasure and duty, or, rather, between pleasure and what those  in authority called duty. Being human, he would have had little  difficulty in making his decision, had not the path of pleasure been so  hedged about by danger as to make him doubt whether after all the thing  could be carried through.    The facts in the case were these. It was the custom of the mathematical  set to which J. S. M. Babington belonged, 4B to wit, to relieve the  tedium of the daily lesson with a species of round game which was  played as follows. As soon as the master had taken his seat, one of the  players would execute a manoeuvre calculated to draw attention on  himself, such as dropping a book or upsetting the blackboard. Called up  to the desk to give explanation, he would embark on an eloquent speech  for the defence. This was the cue for the next player to begin. His  part consisted in making his way to the desk and testifying to the  moral excellence of his companion, and giving in full the reasons why  he should be discharged without a stain upon his character. As soon as  he had warmed to his work he would be followed by a third player, and  so on until the standing room around the desk was completely filled  with a great cloud of witnesses. The duration of the game varied, of  course, considerably. On some occasions it could be played through with  such success, that the master would enter into the spirit of the thing,  and do his best to book the names of all offenders at one and the same  time, a feat of no inconsiderable difficulty. At other times matters  would come to a head more rapidly. In any case, much innocent fun was  to be derived from it, and its popularity was great. On the day,  however, on which this story opens, a new master had been temporarily  loosed into the room in place of the Rev. Septimus Brown, who had been  there as long as the oldest inhabitant could remember. The Rev.  Septimus was a wrangler, but knew nothing of the ways of the human boy.  His successor, Mr Reginald Seymour, was a poor mathematician, but a  good master. He had been, moreover, a Cambridge Rugger Blue. This fact  alone should have ensured him against the customary pleasantries, for a  Blue is a man to be respected. It was not only injudicious, therefore,  but positively wrong of Babington to plunge against the blackboard on  his way to his place. If he had been a student of Tennyson, he might  have remembered that the old order is in the habit of changing and  yielding place to the new.    Mr Seymour looked thoughtfully for a moment  at the blackboard.    'That was rather a crude effort,' he said pleasantly to Babington, 'you  lack _finesse_. Pick it up again, please.'    Babington picked it up without protest. Under the rule of the Rev.  Septimus this would have been the signal for the rest of the class to  leave their places and assist him, but now they seemed to realize that  there was a time for everything, and that this was decidedly no time  for indoor games.    'Thank you,' said Mr Seymour, when the board was in its place again.  'What is your name? Eh, what? I didn't quite hear.'    'Babington, sir.'    'Ah. You"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6984"],[0,"The Pothunters (#20)"],[1,"seldom in the  village. The detective bowed and resumed his tale.    'As I passed the door, I ran into a man coming out. In a very elevated,  not to say intoxicated, state. As a matter of fact, barely able to  stand. Reeled against wall, and dropped handful of money. I lent  helping hand, and picked up his money for him. Not my place to arrest  drunken men. Constable's! No constable there, of course. Noticed, as I  picked the money up, that there was a good deal of it. For ordinary  rustic, a _very_ good deal. Sovereign and plenty of silver.' He  paused, mused for a while, and went on again.    'Yes. Sovereign, and quite ten shillings' worth of silver. Now the  nature of my profession makes me a suspicious man. It struck me as  curious, not to say remarkable, that such a man should have thirty  shillings or more about him so late in the week. And then there was  another thing. I thought I'd seen this particular man somewhere on the  School grounds. Couldn't recall his face exactly, but just had a sort  of general recollection of having seen him before. I happened to have a  camera with me. As a matter of fact I had been taking a few photographs  of the place. Pretty place, sir.'    'Very,' agreed the Head.    'You photograph yourself, perhaps?'    'No. I--ah--do not.'    'Ah. Pity. Excellent hobby. However--I took a snap-shot of this man to  show to somebody who might know him better than I did. This is the  photograph. Drunk as a lord, is he not?'    He exhibited a small piece of paper. The Head examined it gravely, and  admitted that the subject of the picture did not appear to be  ostentatiously sober. The sunlight beat full on his face, which wore  the intensely solemn expression of the man who, knowing his own  condition, hopes, by means of exemplary conduct, to conceal it from the  world. The Head handed the photograph back without further comment.    'I gave the man back his money,' went on Mr Roberts, 'and saw him  safely started again, and then I set to work to shadow him. Not a  difficult job. He walked very slowly, and for all he seemed to care,  the whole of Scotland Yard might have been shadowing him. Went up the  street, and after a time turned in at one of the cottages. I marked the  place, and went home to develop the photograph. Took it to show the man  who looks after the cricket-field.'    'Biffen?'    'Just so, Biffen. Very intelligent man. Given me a good deal of help in  one way and another all along. Well, I showed it to him and he said he  thought he knew the face. Was almost certain it was one of the men at  work on the grounds at the time of the robbery. Showed it to friend of  his, the other ground-man. He thought same. That made it as certain as  I had any need for. Went off at once to the man's cottage, found him  sober, and got the whole thing out of him. But not the cups. He had  been meaning to sell them, but had not known where to go. Wanted  combination of good price and complete safety. Very hard to find, so  had kept cups hidden till further notice.'    Here the Head interrupted.    'And the cups? Where are they?'    'We-e-ll,' said the detective, slowly. 'It is this way. We have only  got his word to go on as regards the cups. This man, Stokes, it seems  is a notorious poacher. The night after the robbery he took the cups  out with him on an expedition in some woods that lie in the direction  of Badgwick. I think Badgwick is the name.'    'Badgwick! Not Sir Alfred Venner's woods?'    'Sir Alfred Venner it was, sir. That was the name he mentioned. Stokes  appears to have been in the habit of visiting that gentleman's property  pretty frequently. He had a regular hiding place, a sort of store where  he used to keep all the game he killed. He described the place to me.  It is a big tree on the bank of the stream nearest the high road. The  tree is hollow. One has to climb to find the opening to it. Inside are  the cups, and, I should say, a good deal of mixed poultry. That is what  he told me, sir. I should advise you, if I may say so, to write a note  to Sir Alfred Venner, explaining the case, and ask him to search the  tree, and send the cups on here.'    This idea did not appeal to the Head at all. Why, he thought bitterly,  was this wretched M.P. always mixed up with his affairs? Left to  himself, he could have existed in perfect comfort without either  seeing, writing to, or hearing from the great man again for the rest of  his life. 'I will think it over,' he said, 'though it seems the only  thing to be done. As for Stokes, I suppose I must prosecute--'    The detective raised a hand in protest.    'Pardon my interruption, sir, but I really should advise you not to  prosecute.'    'Indeed! Why?'    'It is this way. If you prosecute, you get the man his term of  imprisonment. A year, probably. Well and good. But then what happens?  After his sentence has run out, he comes out of prison an ex-convict.  Tries to get work. No good. Nobody will look at him. Asks for a job.  People lock up their spoons and shout for the police. What happens  then? Not being able to get work, tries another burglary. Being a  clumsy hand at the game, gets caught again and sent back to prison, and  so is ruined and becomes a danger to society. Now, if he is let off  this time, he will go straight for the rest of his life. Run a mile to  avoid a silver cup. He's badly scared, and I took the opportunity of  scaring him more. Told him nothing would happen this time, if the cups  came back safely, but that he'd be watched ever afterwards to see he  did not get into mischief. Of course he won't really be watched, you  understand, but he thinks he will. Which is better, for it saves  trouble. Besides, we know where the cups are--I feel sure he was  speaking the truth about them, he was too frightened to invent a  story--and here is most of the money. So it all ends well, if I may put  it so. My advice, sir, and I think you will find it good advice--is  not to prosecute.'    'Very well,' said the Head, 'I will not.'    'Very good, sir. Good morning, sir.' And he left the room.    The Head rang the bell.    'Parker,' said he, 'go across to Mr Merevale's, and ask him to send  Thomson to me.'    It was with mixed feelings that he awaited Jim's arrival. The  detective's story had shown how unjust had been his former suspicions,  and he felt distinctly uncomfortable at the prospect of the apology  which he felt bound to make to him. On the other hand, this feeling was  more than equalled by his relief at finding that his faith in the  virtue of the _genus_ School-prefect, though at fault in the  matter of Plunkett, was not altogether misplaced. It made up for a good  deal. Then his thoughts drifted to Sir Alfred Venner. Struggle with his  feelings as he might, the Head could _not_ endure that local  potentate. The recent interview between them had had no parallel in  their previous acquaintance, but the Head had always felt vaguely  irritated by his manner and speech, and he had always feared that  matters would come to a head sooner or later. The prospect of opening  communication with him once more was not alluring. In the meantime  there was his more immediate duty to be performed, the apology to  Thomson. But that reminded him. The apology must only be of a certain  kind. It must not be grovelling. And this for a very excellent reason.  After the apology must come an official lecture on the subject of  betting. He had rather lost sight of that offence in the excitement of  the greater crime of which Thomson had been accused, and very nearly  convicted. Now the full heinousness of it came back to him. Betting!  Scandalous!    'Come in,' he cried, as a knock at the door roused him from his  thoughts. He turned. But instead of Thomson, there appeared Parker.  Parker carried a note. It was from Mr Merevale.    The Head opened it.    'What!' he cried, as he read it. 'Impossible.' Parker made no comment.  He stood in the doorway, trying to look as like a piece of furniture as  possible--which is the duty of a good butler.    'Impossible!' said the Head again.    What Mr Merevale had said in his note was this, that Thomson was not in  the House, and had not been in the House since lunchtime. He ought to  have returned at six o'clock. It was now half-past eight, and still  there were no signs of him. Mr Merevale expressed a written opinion  that this was a remarkable thing, and the Head agreed with him  unreservedly.          [16]    THE DISAPPEARANCE OF J. THOMSON      Certainly the Head was surprised.    He read the note again. No. There was no mistake. 'Thomson is not in  the House.' There could be no two meanings about that.    'Go across to Mr Merevale's,' he said at last, 'and ask him if he would  mind seeing me here for a moment.'    The butler bowed his head gently, but with more than a touch of pained  astonishment. He thought the Headmaster might show more respect for  persons. A butler is not an errand-boy.    'Sir?' he said, giving the Head a last chance, as it were, of realizing  the situation.    'Ask Mr Merevale to step over here for a moment.'    The poor man bowed once more. The phantom of a half-smoked cigar  floated reproachfully before his eyes. He had lit it a quarter of an  hour ago in fond anticipation of a quiet evening. Unless a miracle had  occurred, it must be out by this time. And he knew as well as anybody  else that a relighted cigar is never at its best. But he went, and in a  few minutes Mr Merevale entered the room.    'Sit down, Mr Merevale,' said the Head. 'Am I to understand from your  note that Thomson is actually not in the House?'    Mr Merevale thought that if he had managed to understand anything else  from the note he must possess a mind of no common order, but he did not  say so.    'No,' he said. 'Thomson has not been in the House since lunchtime, as  far as I know. It is a curious thing.'    'It is exceedingly serious. Exceedingly so. For many reasons. Have you  "]]]
