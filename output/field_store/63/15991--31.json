The bundles our people conjectured to be palm  leaves for covering the houses of the Indians, and continued to  observe them above an hour, during which they walked upon the beach,  and up a path that led over a hill of gentle ascent. It was  remarkable, that not one of them was seen to stop and look towards the  Endeavour. They marched along without the least apparent emotion  either of curiosity or surprise, though it was impossible that they  should not have discerned the ship, by some casual glance, as they  went along the shore, and though she must have been the most  stupendous and unaccountable object they had ever beheld.    While on the 17th, our navigators were in a bay, to which Lieutenant  Cook had given the name of Moreton's Bay, and at a place were the land  was not at that time visible, some on board, having observed that the  sea looked paler than usual, were of opinion that the bottom of the  bay opened into a river. The lieutenant was sensible that there was no  real ground for this supposition. As the Endeavour had here  thirty-four fathom water, and a fine sandy bottom, these circumstances  alone were sufficient to produce the change which had been noticed in  the colour of the sea. Nor was it by any means necessary, to suppose a  river, in order to account for the land at the bottom of the bay not  being visible. If the land there was as low as it had been experienced  to be in a hundred other parts of the coast, it would be impossible to  see it from the station of the ship. Our commander would, however,  have brought the matter to the test of experiments, if the wind had  been favourable to such a purpose. Should any future navigator be  disposed to determine the question, whether there is or is not a river  in this place, Mr. Cook has taken care to leave the best directions  for finding its situation.    On the 22nd, as our voyagers were pursuing their course from Harvey's  Bay, they discovered with their glasses that the land was covered with  palm-nut trees, which they had not seen from the time of their leaving  the islands within the tropic. They saw also two men walking along the  shore, who paid them as little attention, as they had met with on  former occasions. At eight o'clock in the evening of this day, the  ship came to an anchor in five fathom, with a fine sandy bottom. Early  in the morning of the next day, the lieutenant, accompanied by Mr.  Banks, Dr. Solander, the other gentlemen, Tupia, and a party of men,  went on shore in order to examine the country. The wind blew fresh,  and the weather was so cold, that being at a considerable distance  from land, they took their cloaks as a necessary equipment for the  voyage. When they landed, they found a channel leading into a large  lagoon. Both the channel and the lagoon were examined by our commander  with his usual accuracy. There is in the place a small river of fresh  water, and room for a few ships to lie in great security. Near the  lagoon grows the true mangrove, such as exists in the West India  islands, and the first of the kind that had been yet met with by our  navigators. Among the shoals and sand banks of the coast, they saw  many large birds, and some in particular of the same kind which they  had seen in Botany Bay. These they judged to be pelicans, but they  were so shy as never to come within reach of a musket. On the shore  was found a species of the bustard, one of which was shot that was  equal in size to a turkey, weighing seventeen pounds and a half. All  the gentlemen agreed that this was the best bird they had eaten since  they left England; and in honour of it they called the inlet Bustard  Bay. Upon the mud banks, and under the mangroves, were innumerable  oysters of various kinds, and among others the hammer oyster, with a  large proportion of small pearl oysters. If in deeper water there  should be equal plenty of such oysters at their full growth, Mr. Cook  was of opinion that a pearl fishery might be established here to very  great advantage.    The people who were left on board the ship asserted, that, while the  gentlemen were in the woods, about twenty of the natives came down to  the beach, abreast of the Endeavour, and, after having looked at her  for some time, went away. Not a single Indian was seen by the  gentlemen themselves, though they found various proofs, in smoke,  fires, and the fragments of recent meals, that the country was  inhabited. The place seemed to be much trodden, and yet not a house,  or the remains of a house, could be discerned. Hence the lieutenant  and his friends were disposed to believe, that the people were  destitute of dwellings, as well as of clothes; and that like the other  commoner of nature, they spent their nights in the open air. Tupia  himself was struck with their apparently unhappy condition; and  shaking his head, with an air of superiority and compassion, said that  they were taata enos, 'poor wretches.'    On the 25th, our voyagers, at the distance of one mile from the land,  were abreast of a point, which Mr. Cook found to lie directly under  the tropic of Capricorn; and for this reason he called it Cape  Capricorn. In the night of the next day, when the ship had anchored at  a place which was distant four leagues from Cape Capricorn, the tide  rose and fell near seven feet; and the flood set to the westward, and  the ebb to the eastward. This circumstance was just the reverse of  what had been experienced when the Endeavour was at anchor to the  eastward of Bustard Bay.    While our people were under sail, on the 26th, and were surrounded  with islands, which lay at different distance from the main land, they  suddenly fell into three fathom of water. Upon this the lieutenant  anchored, and sent away the master to sound a channel, which lay  between the northernmost island and the main. Though the channel  appeared to have a considerable breadth, our commander suspected it to  be shallow, and such was in fact the case. The master reported, at his  return, that he had only two fathom and a half in many places; and  where the vessel lay at anchor, she had only sixteen feet, which was  not two feet more than she drew. Mr. Banks who, while the master was  sounding the channel, tried to fish from the cabin window with hook  and line, was successful in catching two sort of crabs, both of them  such as our navigators had not seen before. One of them was adorned  with a most beautiful blue, in every respect equal to the ultramarine.  With this blue all his claws and joints are deeply tinged; while the  under part of him was white, and so exquisitely polished, that to  colour and brightness it bore an exact resemblance to the white of old  china. The other crab was also marked, though somewhat more sparingly,  with the ultramarine on his joints and his toes; and on his back were  three brown spots of a singular appearance.    Early the next morning, Lieutenant Cook, having found the passage  between the Islands, sailed to the northward, and, on the evening of  the succeeding day, anchored at about two miles distance from the  main. At this time a great number of islands, lying a long way without  the ship, were in sight. On the 29th, the lieutenant sent away the  master with two boats to sound the entrance of an inlet, which lay to  the west, and into which he intended to go with the vessel, that he  might wait a few days for the moon's increase, and have an opportunity  of examining the country. As the tide was observed to ebb and flow  considerably, when the Endeavour had anchored within the inlet, our  commander judged it to be a river, that might run pretty far up into  land. Thinking that this might afford a commodious situation for  laying the ship ashore, and cleaning her bottom, he landed with the  master, in search of a proper place for the purpose. He was  accompanied in the excursion by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander; and they  found walking exceedingly troublesome, in consequence of the ground's  being covered with a kind of grass, the seeds of which were very sharp  and bearded. Whenever these seeds stuck into their clothes, which  happened at every step, they worked forward by means of the beard,  till they got at the flesh. Another disagreeable circumstance was,  that the gentlemen were incessantly tormented with the stings of a  cloud of musquitos. They soon met with several places where the ship  might conveniently be laid ashore; but were much disappointed in not  being able to find any fresh water. In proceeding up the country they  found gum trees, the gum upon which existed only to very small  quantities. Gum trees of a similar kind and as little productive, had  occurred in other parts of the coast of New South Wales. Upon the  branches of the trees were ants' nests, made of clay as big as a  bushel. The ants themselves, by which the nests were inhabited, were  small, and their bodies white. Upon another species of the gum trees,  was found a small black ant, which perforated all the twigs, and,  having worked out the pith, occupied the pipe in which it had been  contained. Notwithstanding this, the parts in which these insects, to  an amazing number, had formed a lodgment, bore leaves and flowers, and  appeared to be entirely in a flourishing state. Butterflies were found  in such multitudes, that the account of them seems almost to be  incredible. The air was so crowded with them, for the space of three  or four acres, that millions might be seen in every direction; and the  branches and twigs of the trees were at the same time covered with  others that were not upon the wing. A small fish a of singular kind  was likewise met with in this place. Its size was about that of a  minnow, and it had two very strong breast-fins. It was found in places  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7787"],[0,"A Complete Grammar of Esperanto (#20)"],[1,"ened\"), cxar tiaj demandoj montras ke mi ankaux pensas pri ili.

THE INTERROGATIVE ADVERB OF MANNER AND DEGREE.    134. The interrogative adverb of manner or degree, related to the  interrogative pronoun \"kiu\", is \"kiel\", how, in what way, to what  degree:       Kiel oni vivas en tia aero? How do people live in such air?     Kiel afabla sxi estas! How amiable she is!     Mi miras kiel la batalo okazis, I wonder how the battle happened.     Kiel longe li pensis pri gxi? How long did he think about it?                             THE PLUPERFECT TENSE.    135. The compound tense formed by combining the past active participle  with the past tense of \"esti\" represents an act or condition as having  been completed at some time in the past, and is called the \"pluperfect  tense\". The conjugation of \"vidi\" in this tense is as follows:       mi estis vidinta, I had seen (I was having-seen).     vi estis vidinta, you had seen (you were having-seen).     li (sxi, gxi) estis vidinta, he (she, it) had seen (was having-seen).     ni estis vidintaj, we had seen (we were having-seen).     vi estis vidintaj, you had seen (you were having-seen).     ili estis vidintaj, they had seen (they were having-seen).                                 CARDINAL NUMERALS.    136. Cardinals are numeral adjectives which answer the question \"How  many?\" The cardinals from one to twelve are as follows:       unu = one.                         sep = seven.     du = two.                          ok = eight.     tri = three.                       naux = nine.     kvar = four.                       dek = ten.     kvin = five.                       dek unu = eleven.     ses = six.                         dek du = twelve.    137. With the exception of \"unu\", none of the cardinals may receive the  plural ending \"-j\" or the accusative ending \"-n\". That is, they are  invariable in form. \"Unuj\" may be used to mean \"some\" in contrast to  \"aliaj\", others:       Unuj marsxis, aliaj kuris, some walked, others ran.     Mi prenis unujn kaj lasis la aliajn, I took some and left the others.    138. The preposition \"el\" is used after numeral adjectives expressing a  number \"out of\" some larger number or quantity:       Ses el la knaboj venis, six of the boys came.     Ok el tiuj libroj estas la miaj, eight of those books are mine.     El tiuj cxapeloj mi sxatas nur unu, of those hats I like only one.    [Footnote: The cardinal \"unu\" must not be used in the sense of the  English pronominal \"one,\" as in \"I am searching for a book, but not the  one on the table\", which should be translated \"Mi sercxas libron, sed ne  tiun sur la tablo.\"]                             THE ACCUSATIVE OF MEASURE.    139. A substantive in the accusative case may be used, instead of  a prepositional phrase or an adverb, not only to express measure  (duration) of time (91), but also to express measure of weight, price,  length, etc.:       Li marsxis dek unu mejlojn, he walked eleven miles.     La parko estas largxa tri mejlojn, kaj longa kvar mejlojn,        the park is three miles wide and four miles long.     La tablo pezas dek du funtojn,        the table weighs (is heavy) twelve pounds.                                    NIA FAMILIO.    Mi rakontos al vi kian familion ni havas. Ni estas ses personoj kaj ni  logxas en cxi tiu domo de antaux preskaux kvar jaroj. Antaux ol veni  cxi tien al la urbo, ni estis logxintaj tri jarojn en kvieta vilagxo  en la kamparo. Mia patro estas alta, kun grizaj haroj kaj griza barbo.  Kvankam li ne estas ricxulo, li tamen havas suficxe da mono por vivi  kontente kaj felicxe. Li sxatas marsxi, kaj ofte li estas marsxinta  kvin aux ses mejlojn por unu promeno. Unu fojon mi demandis \"Kiel vi  povas marsxi tiel multe?\" Li respondis \"Dum mi estis junulo mi estis  soldato, kaj tiam mi estis tre multe marsxanta. Tial mi ne forgesas la  plezurojn de longaj promenoj.\" La patrino estas malpli alta ol mi, kaj  kiel bluajn okulojn sxi havas, sub nigraj okulharoj kaj nigraj brovoj!  Sxiaj haroj estas nigraj kaj buklaj, kaj sxiaj vangoj estas rugxaj. Sxi  havas dolcxan vocxon, kaj estas plezuro auxdi sxiajn kantojn. Por legi  aux skribi sxi kutime portas okulvitrojn. Mi havas du fratojn kaj unu  fratinon. La fratino havas dek unu jarojn.    [Footnote: Like French and some other languages, Esperanto commonly uses  the verb \"to have\" rather than the verb \"to be\", in expressing age: Li  havas sep jarojn, he is seven years old (he has seven years). Mi havis  dek jarojn tiam, I was ten years old (I had ten years) then.]    Unu el la fratoj havas ok jarojn, la alia havas dek du jarojn. Ili povas  bonege kuri, rajdi, kaj fari aliajn interesajn aferojn. Ili lernis  siajn lecionojn en la lernejo tiel bone ke ses fojojn en unu monato  oni lauxdis ilin. Ni multe gxojis pri tiom da lauxdo por la fratoj. La  fratino estas malpli forta, tamen sxi ofte promenas kun ni ecx du aux  tri mejlojn. La avino ankaux logxas cxe ni de antaux sep aux ok jaroj.  Unu el ni kutime restas cxe la hejmo kun sxi, dum la aliaj promenas,  cxar sxi ne estas suficxe forta por marsxi ecx unu mejlon. Mi ofte miras  kial sxi preferas sidi sur la verando, kaj mi demandas al sxi \"Cxu vi  estas tro laca por marsxi?\" Sxi kutime balancas la kapon kaj diras \"Jes,  mia nepo, mi estas tro laca.\"                             SENTENCES FOR TRANSLATION.    1. Three and four make seven. 2. Two and six make eight. Five and six  make eleven. 3. Seven and five make twelve. 4. I have been studying  geometry since five months ago, and German since January. 5. I have read  three German books, but I shall not be able to talk in this language  until after August. 6. To learn how to speak such a language is a  difficult matter. 7. Nine of the children in our school are now studying  German with me. 8. Some learn it easily, others do not like it. 9. Three  of the boys and two of the girls in that school are German. 10. They  had resided four years in a large city, but I think (that) they live  more contentedly in our quiet village. 11. They can not talk with us  very well, but merely nod their heads when we talk to them. 12. I had  not seen them before they came to school, although they are neighbors  of ours. 13. They are amiable children, with blue eyes, red cheeks, and  yellow hair. 14. They can ride very well, and often ride eight or ten  miles in one day. 15. They usually ride in a park three miles wide and  four miles long, where there is but little (\"nur malmulte da\") dust.                                      LESSON XXX.                       THE INTERROGATIVE ADVERB OF QUANTITY.    140. The interrogative adverb of quantity related to the interrogative  pronoun \"kiu\" is \"kiom\", how much, how many:       Kiom da tempo vi ripozis? How much time did you rest?     Kiom da sukero kaj kiom da fragoj vi acxetis?        How much sugar and how many strawberries did you buy?     Ni miras kiom da mono li havos,        we wonder how much money he will have.     Kiom de la leciono vi lernis? How much of the lesson did you learn?                       MODIFIERS OF IMPERSONALLY USED VERBS.    141. Any modifier of an impersonal verb (50) or of a verb used  impersonally, that is, with an infinitive or clause for its subject,  or without any definitely expressed or personal subject (as in \"it is  cold,\" \"it seems too early\"), must necessarily be adverbial:       Estas varme en la domo, it is warm in the house.     Estos malvarme morgaux, it will be cold tomorrow.     Estas bone ke li venis, it is well that he came.     Estas amuze ke ni forgesis lin, it is amusing that we forgot him.     Ke vi venis estis tre sagxe, that you came was very wise.     Estos pli agrable en la salono, it will be pleasanter in the parlor.                          FORMATION OF CARDINAL NUMERALS.    142. The cardinal numerals for the tens, hundreds and thousands are  formed by prefixing \"du\", \"tri\", \"kvar\", etc., to \"dek\", ten, \"cent\",  hundred, and \"mil\", thousand, respectively.                                     Tens.               -----------------------------------------"]]]
