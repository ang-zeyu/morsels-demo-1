[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49131"],[0,"Wings over England (#20)"],[1,"was forming. Climbing slowly, Dave at  last joined that line. Then, in the Sky Over England that was once more  England's own, they cruised the blue until the young Lord gave the word  and they went thundering home.    As they left their ships on the landing field the young Lord walked over  to Dave, put out a hand, gripped Dave's hard, then without a word walked  away. It was enough. Dave understood and was glad.    Just at mess time that evening an old man, member of the Home Guard  appeared at headquarters. Under his arm he carried a flat, paper-wrapped  package.    \"Thought you might like it, sir,\" he said as he placed it in the young  Lord's hand.    As the others gathered around the flight leader unwrapped it, then  handed it to Dave. It was the tail of a Messerschmitt. On it had been  painted two letters, H. W. Below these letters were 56 long, black  lines.    \"This,\" said Dave, \"should be yours.\" He gave it back to the young Lord.  \"All trophies belong to the leader of the flight.\"    \"To the entire squadron,\" the young Lord replied huskily. \"Come. We'll  put it up where all may see.\" He placed it on the mantle. \"Not that we  need to boast,\" he said quietly, \"but that all men may know that the Sky  Over England is England's alone.\"                                       _Chapter_ XXIV                            Searchers of the Sea      Next morning the squadron commander received a strange request. Young  Lord Applegate walked into his quarters, saluted, then said:    \"Commander, I wish to ask for a transfer.\"    \"A transfer?\" The Commander sat forward in his chair. \"Why? You are  doing magnificently. Only yesterday--\"    \"Begging your pardon, sir,\" Applegate broke in, \"that has no bearing on  the case. I ask for a transfer to the bomber service that patrols the  sea. I was trained for that work, had a full year's training. That  should be enough.\"    \"But you are a born fighter.\"    \"Perhaps,\" the young Lord admitted. \"And perhaps too one may fight with  a twin-motored bomber.\"    \"There's seldom an opportunity on sea patrol.\"    \"We will make an opportunity. My men, Ramsey, Barnes and The Lark, wish  to go with me. Old Jock, from Ramsey Farm, a gunner, first-class, who  lost a leg in Flanders, will join us.\"    \"I still don't see--\"    \"Commander,\" the young Lord's face was tense with emotion, \"with me this  is a personal matter. You've heard of the sinking of the Queen Bess?\"  The Commander nodded.    \"Cherry Ramsey was on that ship. You know her, I'm sure.\"    \"I have met her. A charming girl. She was doing a grand piece of work.  Was she lost?\"    \"Her name is not on the list of those rescued. But it is believed,\" the  young Lord's voice rang with hope, \"that one life-boat, not swamped by  the storm, remains unreported.    \"If I am granted a transfer to the Sea Patrol I shall ask that we be  allowed to patrol that portion of the air over the Atlantic beneath  which the Queen Bess was fired upon and sunk.\"    \"I see.\" The commander's face was thoughtful.    \"That is not all.\" The lines on the young Lord's brow deepened. \"I shall  ask that we be allowed to carry two five-hundred pound bombs and be  commissioned to search for the merciless sea raider that sank that  shipload of children. It is still at large.\"    The commander nodded. \"She attacked a convoy last night. Gave no  warning. Sank three ships, then was away.\"    For a moment the commander sat staring at the wall. \"It's very  irregular,\" he murmured.    \"This is an irregular war, not fought by rules. Fought by men. Thank God  for that!\" The young Lord's chin was up.    \"All right. I'll see what I can do.\" The commander stood up. \"Report to  me here at noon.\"    The young Lord saluted, then marched away.    An hour later he was engaged in a heated argument with his good friend,  Alice. \"But, Alice!\" his voice rose. \"It's impossible! A woman on a  sea-patrol bomber! Suppose we catch up with that ruthless pirate.\"    \"All right.\" Alice stood up sturdy and tall. \"Suppose we do?\"    \"It won't be a one-sided fight. That raider carries anti-aircraft guns.  Death may be waiting at those crossroads of the sea.\"    \"Death.\" Alice's voice was low. \"In this war not just young men are  giving their lives for the land they love. Men and women and children  are. It's everybody's war.    \"Harm!\" (She seldom used that name of other days. In her soul was  written traditional homage to nobility.) \"It is Cherry who is out there  on those black waters. Our Cherry! Peggy and Tillie are with her. A  woman's eyes are always sharper than a man's. Always when we were  children it was my eyes, not yours, that saw the lark soaring skyward or  the finches hiding in the hedges. Harman, let me go!\"    \"But the farm, Alice?\" The young Lord was weakening.    \"Surely you can spare Jeff Weeks and his wife for a few days to look  after this farm.\"    \"A few days? Yes. But suppose it is forever?\" The young Lord's voice was  low. \"Alice, more important than our search for Cherry, much as we all  love her, is to be our hunt for the sea-raider. And if we find it there  will be no quarter! It shall be that ship or our plane. Such is war.\"    \"If it is to be forever?\" There was a smile on the girl's lips. \"We die  but once. The farm will not matter. Let me go!\"    The young Lord threw up his hands. \"I surrender,\" he whispered hoarsely.    And so it happened that, when the transfer had been granted and the  young Lord had been put in command of a sea-scouting bomber, one of the  fastest in the service, and when it sailed away into the blue, it  carried not five but six men. One of these \"men\" had short, bobbed hair,  and as he stood by the one-legged, gray-haired rear gunner, he looked  remarkably like a girl.    At dawn, in a bomber that made their little Spitfires seem like gulls,  the young warriors rose high in air, far above the clouds, to zoom away.    When land was lost from sight the young Lord studied his compass and his  chart, set a course south by west to at last drop down close to the sea.    After that, hour after hour, with eyes that burned from watching and  hearts that ached with longing, they studied the dark surface of the  never-ending sea.    Twice they came upon British ship convoys and dipped low to greet them.  Once they thought they saw a life-boat and hope ran high. But, as they  dropped low, the supposed boat submerged.    \"Whale or a submarine?\" the young Lord barked into his receiver.    \"Whale,\" was old Jock's instant response. So they soared on.    It was only after their gasoline supply began running low that they at  last rose into the blue to go zooming to a landing field in the north of  Scotland.    There, after darkness had fallen, Alice slipped away to a little hotel  where no questions were asked. When, however, she told what she dared of  their mission, she was accorded the hospitality due a queen and in the  morning not a cent would her hostess accept.    \"It's our own war,\" said the good lady, \"and may the good Lord bless  you.\"    The second day was more than half gone. The girl's eyes were red with  watching when she called in her phone, \"I--I hear the sound of firing.\"    Every headset was removed.    \"Not a sound but the motors. Not a sound,\" was the report.    \"Climb. Then shut off your motors,\" Alice insisted.    It was done, and from the west to their listening ears came the roar of  heavy guns.    \"Prepare for action,\" the young Lord barked. \"See that the bombs are in  their place. Make all fast.    \"And,\" he added softly, \"say a prayer.\"    Their ship was fast. Smoke loomed on the horizon. Ships, a large convoy,  took form. A minor sea-battle was in progress. Doughty captains of  freighters were pitting their small guns against the heavy ones of a  raider.    They were rapidly approaching the scene when with a joyous battle cry  the Lark sang out, \"Man! Oh, man! They've spotted us. Look! There they  go! Running at full speed.\"    \"We're after them.\" The young Lord's lips were drawn into a straight  line.    Old Jock was at the bomb controls, Dave and Brand at the one-pound  cannons, the Lark at the radio.    They climbed a thousand feet, three, five, then twenty thousand feet.  They were all but above the fleeing raider now. Dave tried to imagine  the wild commotion and the frenzied preparation on board that raider at  that moment. Just what the young Lord meant to do, he knew. Life and  death hung in the balance.    As for the young Lord, his brow suddenly wrinkled. He had caught a  glimpse of two specks against the sky.    \"Here,\" he called to Alice. \"Have a look through the glass. Off to the  right! Enemy or friend? Tell me--Quick!\"    One look and she told him. \"Enemy! Twin motor interceptors. Two of  them.\"    \"Good! We'll show them how it's done.\"    Ten seconds later he barked, \"All set for a power dive!\"    The big ship's nose pointed toward the sea. Far below the raider seemed  a speck. As it grew in size it could be seen to zig-zag this way, then  that.    \"All or nothing,\" had been the young Lord's order. \"When I give the  signal release both bombs.\"    As Dave watched it seemed they could not win. Yet the young Lord had a  keen mind. He had been well trained.    To the roar of the motor and the screaming of the plunging plane was  added the burst of anti-aircraft fire. Death rode the air.    And then Dave realized that the instant had come. Fascinated, he watched  a bomb glide from its place, then another. A second later there was a  lurch as the plane began coming out of its dive.    To Dave, the time of waiting, only a few seconds, seemed endless. Then  came a boom, followed almost at once by a second. And then a roar far  greater than the others. There was a push that lifted them high, then  all but dropped them into the sea.    \"Right on the nose!\" The Lark roared from his tail gunner's position.  \"Blew up their magazine. Raider, whose captain has a heart of stone, has  met its end.\"    \"We'll let those"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4932"],[0,"A Knight of the White Cross: A Tale of the Siege of Rhodes (#20)"],[1,"time that I have reason to complain of you, I shall  bring the matter before the grand master, and represent to him that it  were best to send you home, since you cannot comport yourself to the  servants of the auberge as befits a knight of the Order. We have always  borne the reputation of being specially kind to our servants, and it  is intolerable that one, who has been but a short time only a professed  knight, should behave with a hauteur and insolence that not even the  oldest among us would permit himself. There is not one of the servants  here who was not in his own country of a rank and station equal, if not  superior, to your own; and though misfortune has fallen upon them, they  are to be pitied rather than condemned for it. In future, you are to  give no order whatever to the servants, nor to address them, save when  at meals you require anything. If you have any complaints to make of  their conduct to you, you will make them to me, and I will inquire into  the matter; and if I find they have failed in their duty they will be  punished. I shall keep my eye upon you in the future. There are other  faults that I have observed in you. More than once I have heard you  address Sir Gervaise Tresham in a manner which, were not duelling  forbidden by our rules, might bring about bloodshed; and from what I  have seen when I have been watching the exercises, he is as much your  superior in arms as he is in manner and disposition.\"    This reproof had greatly subdued Robert Rivers; and as he felt that  any display of his jealousy of Gervaise would be resented by the  other knights, and might result in serious consequences to himself, he  abstained from any exhibition of it when they returned to the auberge,  although he could not bring himself to join in the congratulations  offered to them. The next day, however, when he was talking to Ralph  Harcourt, he remarked, \"From what I hear, Harcourt, D'Aubusson praised  young Tresham very highly. It seems to me that there was nothing at all  out of the way in what he did, and it was very unfair that he should be  selected for higher praise than yourself.\"    \"It was not unfair at all,\" Ralph said warmly, for he was of a generous  nature, and incapable of the base feeling of envy. \"Tresham did a great  deal more than I did. When we saw the pirate boat gaining so fast upon  us, it seemed to Sir John Boswell, as well as to myself, that there was  scarce a chance of escape, and that all we could do was to choose a spot  on which to make a stand, and then to sell our lives as dearly as we  could. I could see that Sir John was scanning the hill for a spot where  we could best defend ourselves. As to hiding on so small an island, with  a hundred men eager for our blood searching for us, it was well nigh  impossible. It was Tresham's suggestion alone that saved our lives and  enabled us to fetch succour to Sir Louis. Sir John, who is an old and  tried soldier, said that for quickness and merit of conception, the  oldest knight in the Order could not have done better; and he is not  one to praise unduly. I am four years older than Gervaise Tresham, but  I tell you that were he named tomorrow commander of a galley, I would  willingly serve under him.\"    \"Well, well, you need not be angry, Harcourt, I have nothing to say  against Tresham. No doubt he had a happy thought, which turned out well;  but I cannot see that there was anything wonderful in it, and it seemed  to me unfair that one who is a mere boy should receive higher praise  than yourself, who, as I heard Sir John and Sir Adam Tedbond say last  night at the refectory, bore yourself right gallantly.\"    \"I did my best,\" Ralph said shortly; \"but there was small credit in that  when we were fighting for our lives. The most cowardly beast will fight  under such circumstances. When you see a Moslem rushing at you, scimitar  in hand, and know that if you do not cut him down he will cut you down,  you naturally strike as hard and as quickly as you can. You have never  liked Gervaise, Rivers. I am sure I don't know why, but you always speak  in a contemptuous sort of tone about him. True, it does him no harm,  but it certainly does you no good. For what reason should you feel a  contempt for him? Although so much younger, he is a better swordsman and  a better rider than you are. He is liked by every one in the auberge,  which is more than can be said of yourself; he is always good tempered,  and is quiet and unassuming. What on earth do you always set yourself  against him for?\"    \"I do not know that I do set myself against him,\" Rivers said sullenly.  \"I own to having no great liking for him, which is natural enough,  seeing that his father was a Lancastrian, while we are Yorkists; but it  is not pleasant to see so much made of a boy, merely because D'Aubusson  has favoured him.\"    \"I am certain,\" Harcourt said hotly, \"that such an idea has never  occurred to any one but yourself. Sir Peter is a great man and will soon  be our grand master, but at present he is but grand prior of the langue  of Auvergne, and whether he favours Tresham or not is a matter that  concerns none of us. Gervaise is liked by us for his own good qualities.  He bears himself, as a young knight should do, respectfully towards his  seniors, and is ever ready to do a service to any one. No one has  ever seen him out of temper; he is always kind and considerate to the  servants, and when in command of parties of slaves at the public works  never says a harsh word to them, but treats them as if they were human  beings, and not brute beasts. Besides, though he is more skilful than  any of us with his sword, or indeed at any of the military exercises, he  is unassuming, and has no particle of pride or arrogance. It is for  all these things that he is liked, and the friendship of D'Aubusson  has naught whatever to do with it. It is not only D'Aubusson who has  prophesied that he will rise to a distinguished rank in the Order.  Boswell and Ricord both said the same, and I for one thoroughly believe  it. Is there one among us under the age of twenty--and I might go  farther--who has already won such credit for himself? One who when but  sixteen can make his mark in an Order like ours is certain to rise to  high office, and you and I may, before many years are over, be proud to  serve under him.\"    \"That I will never do,\" Rivers said fiercely. \"I would rather go and  bury myself for life in the smallest commandery in England.\"    \"That may be,\" Harcourt retorted, his temper also roused, \"But possibly  you might prefer that to fighting under any other leader.\"    \"That is a reflection on my courage, Sir Ralph Harcourt, I shall lay  this matter before the bailiff.\"    \"You can do as you like,\" Harcourt said disdainfully, \"But I don't think  you will benefit by your pains.\"    When his temper cooled down Rivers acknowledged to himself the truth of  what Harcourt said. He was not in the favour of the bailiff, while both  Harcourt and Tresham stood at the present moment high in his estimation.  Any complaint would lead to an inquiry into the matter that had led  to the former's words, and even if Harcourt were reprimanded for using  them, he himself would assuredly not gain in the estimation of the  knights. Harcourt himself thought no more of the matter, though he  laughingly told Gervaise that Rivers was by no means gratified at their  both attaining the honour of secular knighthood, which virtually placed  them over his head.    \"He is not a nice fellow,\" Gervaise said. \"But naturally it must be  galling to him, and to a good many others who have not yet had the  chance of distinguishing themselves. I think it is very good of them  that they are all so kind and cordial. Of course it is otherwise with  you, who are as old as most of the other professed knights serving here;  but with me it is quite different, and as Rivers, somehow, has never  been very friendly with me, of course it is doubly galling to him. I  hope he will soon get an opportunity of winning his spurs too.\"    \"That is just like you, Tresham. If I were in your place, I should  have no good wishes for a fellow who has never lost an opportunity of  annoying me, and that without the smallest cause of offence on my part.\"    \"I am sure you would not wish him ill, Harcourt. You would make  allowance for him just as I do, and feel that if he had had the same  opportunities he would have obtained the same credit and honours.\"        CHAPTER VII A FIRST COMMAND      The first news that the knights heard on their return from their  expedition was that the Grand Master Orsini was seriously ill, and that,  at his advanced age, the doctors feared there was little hope of his  rallying. Gervaise felt a keen regret on hearing that the kind and  gentle old man, who had been for three years his master, was at the  point of death. Nevertheless, it was generally felt among the knights  that, in view of the dangers that threatened Rhodes, it was for the good  of the Order that a strong and capable man, whom all respected, and who  possessed their entire confidence, should at such a time be invested  with absolute power.    D'Aubusson had, indeed, for some years been the real head of the  community, but every question had, if only as a matter of form, to  be referred to the grand master, in order to obtain his approval and  signature. In the state of feebleness to which he had for some months  past fallen, much time was frequently lost before he could be made to  understand the questions referred to him. Moreover, orders of D'Aubusson  could be appealed against, his views thwarted, and his authority  questioned; and it was therefore felt that, much as they all respected  the old grand master, it would be an advantage to the Order when the  supreme authority passed into the hands of D'Aubusson.    Four days after the return of the expedition Orsini died. A few hours  later the grand council was convened, "]]]
