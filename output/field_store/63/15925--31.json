He was from this  point of view, indeed, his own Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, the buoyant, self-  enjoying, because pleasure-conferring, man, and at the same time the  helpless yet fascinating \"dark interpreter\" of the gloomy and  gloom-inspiring side of life, viewed from the point of view of dominating  character and inherited influence.  When he reached out his hand with  desire of pleasure-conferring, lo and behold, as he wrote, a hand from  his forefathers was stretched out, and he was pulled backward; so that,  as he has confessed, his endings were apt to shame, perhaps to degrade,  the beginnings.  Here is something pointing to the hidden and secret  springs that feed the deeper will and bend it to their service.  Individuality itself is but a mirror, which by its inequalities  transforms things to odd shapes.  Hawthorne confessed to something of  this sort.  He, like Stevenson, suffered much in youth, if not from  disease then through accident, which kept him long from youthful company.  At a time when he should have been running free with other boys, he had  to be lonely, reading what books he could lay his hands on, mostly  mournful and puritanic, by the borders of lone Sebago Lake.  He that hath  once in youth been touched by this Marah-rod of bitterness will not  easily escape from it, when he essays in later years to paint life and  the world as he sees them; nay, the hand, when he deems himself freest,  will be laid upon him from behind, if not to pull him, as MacDonald has  said, into life backward, then to make him a mournful witness of having  once been touched by the Marah-rod, whose bitterness again declares  itself and wells out its bitterness when set even in the rising and the  stirring of the waters.    Such is our view of the \"gloom\" of Stevenson--a gloom which well might  have justified something of his father's despondency.  He struggles in  vain to escape from it--it narrows, it fatefully hampers and limits the  free field of his art, lays upon it a strange atmosphere, fascinating,  but not favourable to true dramatic breadth and force, and spontaneous  natural simplicity, invariably lending a certain touch of weakness,  inconsistency, and inconclusiveness to his endings; so that he himself  could too often speak of them afterwards as apt to \"shame, perhaps to  degrade, the beginnings.\"  This is what true dramatic art should never  do.  In the ending all that may raise legitimate question in the  process--all that is confusing, perplexing in the separate parts--is met,  solved, reconciled, at least in a way satisfactory to the general, or  ordinary mind; and thus such unity is by it so gained and sealed, that in  no case can the true artist, whatever faults may lie in portions of the  process-work, say of his endings that \"they shame, perhaps degrade, the  beginning.\"  Wherever this is the case there will be \"gloom,\" and there  will also be a sad, tormenting sense of something wanting.  \"The evening  brings a 'hame';\" so should it be here--should it especially be in a  dramatic work.  If not, \"We start; for soul is wanting there;\" or, if not  soul, then the last halo of the soul's serene triumph.  From this side,  too, there is another cause for the undramatic character, in the stricter  sense of Stevenson's work generally: it is, after all, distressful,  unsatisfying, egotistic, for fancy is led at the beck of some  pre-established disharmony which throws back an abiding and irremovable  gloom on all that went before; and the free spontaneous grace of natural  creation which ensures natural simplicity is, as said already, not quite  attained.    It was well pointed out in _Hammerton_, by an unanonymous author there  quoted (pp. 22, 23), that while in the story, Hyde, the worse one, wins,  in Stevenson himself--in his real life--Jekyll won, and not Mr Hyde.  This  writer, too, might have added that the Master of Ballantrae also wins as  well as Beau Austin and Deacon Brodie.  R. L. Stevenson's dramatic art  and a good deal of his fiction, then, was untrue to his life, and on one  side was a lie--it was not in consonance with his own practice or his  belief as expressed in life.    In some other matters the test laid down here is not difficult of  application.  Stevenson, at the time he wrote _The Foreigner at Home_,  had seen a good deal; he had been abroad; he had already had experiences;  he had had differences with his father about Calvinism and some other  things; and yet just see how he applies the standard of his earlier  knowledge and observation to England--and by doing so, cannot help  exaggerating the outstanding differences, always with an almost  provincial accent of unwavering conviction due to his early associations  and knowledge.  He cannot help paying an excessive tribute to the  Calvinism he had formally rejected, in so far as, according to him, it  goes to form character--even national character, at all events, in its  production of types; and he never in any really effective way glances at  what Mr Matthew Arnold called \"Scottish manners, Scottish drink\" as  elements in any way radically qualifying.  It is not, of course, that I,  as a Scotsman, well acquainted with rural life in some parts of England,  as with rural life in many parts of Scotland in my youth, do not heartily  agree with him--the point is that, when he comes to this sort of  comparison and contrast, he writes exactly as his father would or might  have done, with a full consciousness, after all, of the tribute he was  paying to the practical outcome on character of the Calvinism in which he  so thoroughly believed.  It is, in its way, a very peculiar thing--and  had I space, and did I believe it would prove interesting to readers in  general, I might write an essay on it, with instances--in which case the  Address to the Scottish Clergy would come in for more notice, citation  and application than it has yet received.  But meanwhile just take this  little snippet--very characteristic and very suggestive in its own  way--and tell me whether it does not justify and bear out fully what I  have now said as illustrating a certain side and a strange uncertain  limitation in Stevenson:       \"But it is not alone in scenery and architecture that we count England     foreign.  The constitution of society, the very pillars of the empire,     surprise and even pain us.  The dull neglected peasant, sunk in     matter, insolent, gross and servile, makes a startling contrast to our     own long-legged, long-headed, thoughtful, Bible-loving ploughman.  A     week or two in such a place as Suffolk leaves the Scotsman gasping.  It     seems impossible that within the boundaries of his own island a class     should have been thus forgotten.  Even the educated and intelligent     who hold our own opinions and speak in our own words, yet seem to hold     them with a difference or from another reason, and to speak on all     things with less interest and conviction.  The first shock of English     society is like a cold plunge.\" {8}    As there was a great deal of the \"John Bull element\" {9} in the little  dreamer De Quincey, so there was a great deal, after all, of the rather  conceited Calvinistic Scot in R. L. Stevenson, and it is to be traced as  clearly in certain of his fictions as anywhere, though he himself would  not perhaps have seen it and acknowledged it, as I am here forced now to  see it, and to acknowledge it for him.          CHAPTER XVII--PROOFS OF GROWTH      Once again I quote Goethe:       \"Natural simplicity and repose are the acme of art, and hence it     follows no youth can be a master.\"    It has to be confessed that seldom, if ever, does Stevenson naturally and  by sheer enthusiasm for subject and characters attain this natural  simplicity, if he often attained the counterfeit presentment--artistic  and graceful euphony, and new, subtle, and often unexpected  concatenations of phrase.  Style is much; but it is not everything.  We  often love Scott the more that he shows loosenesses and lapses here, for,  in spite of them, he gains natural simplicity, while not seldom  Stevenson, with all his art and fine sense of verbal music, rather misses  it.  _The Sedulous Ape_ sometimes disenchants as well as charms; for  occasionally a word, a touch, a turn, sends us off too directly in search  of the model; and this operates against the interest as introducing a new  and alien series of associations, where, for full effect, it should not  be so.  And this distraction will be the more insistent, the more  knowledge the reader has and the more he remembers; and since Stevenson's  first appeal, both by his spirit and his methods, is to the cultured and  well read, rather than to the great mass, his \"sedulous apehood\" only the  more directly wars against him as regards deep, continuous, and lasting  impression; where he should be most simple, natural and spontaneous; he  also is most artificial and involved.  If the story-writer is not so much  in earnest, not so possessed by his matter that this is allowed to him,  how is it to be hoped that we shall be possessed in the reading of it?  More than once in _Catriona_ we must own we had this experience, directly  warring against full possession by the story, and certain passages about  Simon Lovat were especially marked by this; if even the first  introduction to Catriona herself was not so.  As for Miss Barbara Grant,  of whom so much has been made by many admirers, she is decidedly clever,  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5921"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 1, Complete (#20)"],[1,"the barber.    \"Senor Florismarte here?\" said the curate; \"then by my faith he must take  up his quarters in the yard, in spite of his marvellous birth and  visionary adventures, for the stiffness and dryness of his style deserve  nothing else; into the yard with him and the other, mistress  housekeeper.\"    \"With all my heart, senor,\" said she, and executed the order with great  delight.    \"This,\" said the barber, \"is The Knight Platir.'\"    \"An old book that,\" said the curate, \"but I find no reason for clemency  in it; send it after the others without appeal;\" which was done.    Another book was opened, and they saw it was entitled, \"The Knight of the  Cross.\"    \"For the sake of the holy name this book has,\" said the curate, \"its  ignorance might be excused; but then, they say, 'behind the cross there's  the devil; to the fire with it.\"    Taking down another book, the barber said, \"This is 'The Mirror of  Chivalry.'\"    \"I know his worship,\" said the curate; \"that is where Senor Reinaldos of  Montalvan figures with his friends and comrades, greater thieves than  Cacus, and the Twelve Peers of France with the veracious historian  Turpin; however, I am not for condemning them to more than perpetual  banishment, because, at any rate, they have some share in the invention  of the famous Matteo Boiardo, whence too the Christian poet Ludovico  Ariosto wove his web, to whom, if I find him here, and speaking any  language but his own, I shall show no respect whatever; but if he speaks  his own tongue I will put him upon my head.\"    \"Well, I have him in Italian,\" said the barber, \"but I do not understand  him.\"    \"Nor would it be well that you should understand him,\" said the curate,  \"and on that score we might have excused the Captain if he had not  brought him into Spain and turned him into Castilian. He robbed him of a  great deal of his natural force, and so do all those who try to turn  books written in verse into another language, for, with all the pains  they take and all the cleverness they show, they never can reach the  level of the originals as they were first produced. In short, I say that  this book, and all that may be found treating of those French affairs,  should be thrown into or deposited in some dry well, until after more  consideration it is settled what is to be done with them; excepting  always one 'Bernardo del Carpio' that is going about, and another called  'Roncesvalles;' for these, if they come into my hands, shall pass at once  into those of the housekeeper, and from hers into the fire without any  reprieve.\"    To all this the barber gave his assent, and looked upon it as right and  proper, being persuaded that the curate was so staunch to the Faith and  loyal to the Truth that he would not for the world say anything opposed  to them. Opening another book he saw it was \"Palmerin de Oliva,\" and  beside it was another called \"Palmerin of England,\" seeing which the  licentiate said, \"Let the Olive be made firewood of at once and burned  until no ashes even are left; and let that Palm of England be kept and  preserved as a thing that stands alone, and let such another case be made  for it as that which Alexander found among the spoils of Darius and set  aside for the safe keeping of the works of the poet Homer. This book,  gossip, is of authority for two reasons, first because it is very good,  and secondly because it is said to have been written by a wise and witty  king of Portugal. All the adventures at the Castle of Miraguarda are  excellent and of admirable contrivance, and the language is polished and  clear, studying and observing the style befitting the speaker with  propriety and judgment. So then, provided it seems good to you, Master  Nicholas, I say let this and 'Amadis of Gaul' be remitted the penalty of  fire, and as for all the rest, let them perish without further question  or query.\"    \"Nay, gossip,\" said the barber, \"for this that I have here is the famous  'Don Belianis.'\"    \"Well,\" said the curate, \"that and the second, third, and fourth parts  all stand in need of a little rhubarb to purge their excess of bile, and  they must be cleared of all that stuff about the Castle of Fame and other  greater affectations, to which end let them be allowed the over-seas  term, and, according as they mend, so shall mercy or justice be meted out  to them; and in the mean time, gossip, do you keep them in your house and  let no one read them.\"    \"With all my heart,\" said the barber; and not caring to tire himself with  reading more books of chivalry, he told the housekeeper to take all the  big ones and throw them into the yard. It was not said to one dull or  deaf, but to one who enjoyed burning them more than weaving the broadest  and finest web that could be; and seizing about eight at a time, she  flung them out of the window.    In carrying so many together she let one fall at the feet of the barber,  who took it up, curious to know whose it was, and found it said, \"History  of the Famous Knight, Tirante el Blanco.\"    \"God bless me!\" said the curate with a shout, \"'Tirante el Blanco' here!  Hand it over, gossip, for in it I reckon I have found a treasury of  enjoyment and a mine of recreation. Here is Don Kyrieleison of Montalvan,  a valiant knight, and his brother Thomas of Montalvan, and the knight  Fonseca, with the battle the bold Tirante fought with the mastiff, and  the witticisms of the damsel Placerdemivida, and the loves and wiles of  the widow Reposada, and the empress in love with the squire Hipolito--in  truth, gossip, by right of its style it is the best book in the world.  Here knights eat and sleep, and die in their beds, and make their wills  before dying, and a great deal more of which there is nothing in all the  other books. Nevertheless, I say he who wrote it, for deliberately  composing such fooleries, deserves to be sent to the galleys for life.  Take it home with you and read it, and you will see that what I have said  is true.\"    \"As you will,\" said the barber; \"but what are we to do with these little  books that are left?\"    \"These must be, not chivalry, but poetry,\" said the curate; and opening  one he saw it was the \"Diana\" of Jorge de Montemayor, and, supposing all  the others to be of the same sort, \"these,\" he said, \"do not deserve to  be burned like the others, for they neither do nor can do the mischief  the books of chivalry have done, being books of entertainment that can  hurt no one.\"    \"Ah, senor!\" said the niece, \"your worship had better order these to be  burned as well as the others; for it would be no wonder if, after being  cured of his chivalry disorder, my uncle, by reading these, took a fancy  to turn shepherd and range the woods and fields singing and piping; or,  what would be still worse, to turn poet, which they say is an incurable  and infectious malady.\"    \"The damsel is right,\" said the curate, \"and it will be well to put this  stumbling-block and temptation out of our friend's way. To begin, then,  with the 'Diana' of Montemayor. I am of opinion it should not be burned,  but that it should be cleared of all that about the sage Felicia and the  magic water, and of almost all the longer pieces of verse: let it keep,  and welcome, its prose and the honour of being the first of books of the  kind.\"    \"This that comes next,\" said the barber, \"is the 'Diana,' entitled the  'Second Part, by the Salamancan,' and this other has the same title, and  its author is Gil Polo.\"    \"As for that of the Salamancan,\" replied the curate, \"let it go to swell  the number of the condemned in the yard, and let Gil Polo's be preserved  as if it came from Apollo himself: but get on, gossip, and make haste,  for it is growing late.\"    \"This book,\" said the barber, opening another, \"is the ten books of the  'Fortune of Love,' written by Antonio de Lofraso, a Sardinian poet.\"    \"By the orders I have received,\" said the curate, \"since Apollo has been  Apollo, and the Muses have been Muses, and poets have been poets, so  droll and absurd a book as this has never been written, and in its way it  is the best and the most singular of all of this species that have as yet  appeared, and he who has not read it may be sure he has never read what  is delightful. Give it here, gossip, for I make more account of having  found it than if they had given me a cassock of Florence stuff.\"    He put it aside with extreme satisfaction, and the barber went on, \"These  that come next are 'The Shepherd of Iberia,' 'Nymphs of Henares,' and  'The Enlightenment of Jealousy.'\"    \"Then all we have to do,\" said the curate, \"is to hand them over to the  secular arm of the housekeeper, and ask me not why, or we shall never  have done.\"    \"This next is the 'Pastor de Filida.'\"    \"No Pastor that,\" said the curate, \"but a highly polished courtier; let  it be preserved as a precious jewel.\"    \"This large one here,\" said the barber, \"is called 'The Treasury of  various Poems.'\"    \"If there were not so many of them,\" said the curate, \"they would be more  relished: this book must be weeded and cleansed of certain vulgarities  which it has with its excellences; let it be preserved because the author  is a friend of mine, and out of respect for other more heroic and loftier  works that he has written.\"    \"This,\" continued the barber, \"is the 'Cancionero' of Lopez de  Maldonado.\"    \"The author of that book, too,\" said the curate, \"is a great friend of  mine, and his verses from his own mouth are the admiration of all who  hear them, for such is the sweetness of his voice that he enchants when  he chants them: it gives rather too much of its eclogues, but what is  good was never yet plentiful: let it be kept with those that have been  set apart. But what book is that next it?\"    \"The 'Galatea' of Miguel de Cervantes,\" said the barber.    \"That Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and to my  knowledge he has had more experience in reverses"]]]
