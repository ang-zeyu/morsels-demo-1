There are enough of them to stuff a dozen  Scarecrows. Why not use the money?\"    The Tin Woodman began to turn over the rubbish with the handle of his axe;  and, sure enough, what they had first thought only worthless papers were  found to be all bills of various denominations,        223  which the mischievous Jackdaws had for years been engaged in stealing from  the villages and cities they visited.    There was an immense fortune lying in that inaccessible nest; and Tip's  suggestion was, with the Scarecrow's consent, quickly acted upon.    They selected all the newest and cleanest bills and assorted them into  various piles. The Scarecrow's left leg and boot were stuffed with five-  dollar bills; his right leg was stuffed with ten-dollar bills, and his body  so closely filled with fifties, one-hundreds and one-thousands that he could  scarcely button his jacket with comfort.    \"You are now\" said the Woggle-Bug, impressively, when the task had been  completed, \"the most valuable member of our party; and as you                   Line-Art Drawing        224  are among faithful friends there is little danger of your being spent.\"    \"Thank you,\" returned the Scarecrow, gratefully. \"I feel like a new man; and  although at first glance I might be mistaken for a Safety Deposit Vault, I  beg you to remember that my Brains are still composed of the same old  material. And these are the possessions that have always made me a person to  be depended upon in an emergency.\"    \"Well, the emergency is here,\" observed Tip; \"and unless your brains help us  out of it we shall be compelled to pass the remainder of our lives in this  nest.\"    \"How about these wishing pills?\" enquired the Scarecrow, taking the box from  his jacket pocket. \"Can't we use them to escape?\"    \"Not unless we can count seventeen by twos,\" answered the Tin Woodman. \"But  our friend the Woggle-Bug claims to be highly educated, so he ought easily  to figure out how that can be done.\"    \"It isn't a question of education,\" returned the Insect; \"it's merely a  question of mathematics. I've seen the professor work lots of sums on the  blackboard, and he claimed anything could be done with x's and y's and a's,  and such things, by mixing them up with plenty of plusses and minuses and  equals, and so forth. But he never said anything, so far as        225  I can remember, about counting up to the odd number of seventeen by the even  numbers of twos.\"    \"Stop! stop!\" cried the Pumpkinhead. \"You're making my head ache.\"    \"And mine,\" added the Scarecrow. \"Your mathematics seem to me very like a  bottle of mixed pickles the more you fish for what you want the less chance  you have of getting it. I am certain that if the thing can be accomplished  at all, it is in a very simple manner.\"    \"Yes,\" said Tip. \"old Mombi couldn't use x's and minuses, for she never went  to school.\"    \"Why not start counting at a half of one?\" asked the Saw-Horse, abruptly.  \"Then anyone can count up to seventeen by twos very easily.\"    They looked at each other in surprise, for the Saw-Horse was considered the  most stupid of the entire party.    \"You make me quite ashamed of myself,\" said the Scarecrow, bowing low to the  Saw-Horse.    \"Nevertheless, the creature is right,\" declared the Woggle-Bug; for twice  one-half is one, and if you get to one it is easy to count from one up to  seventeen by twos.\"    \"I wonder I didn't think of that myself,\" said the Pumpkinhead.        226    \"I don't,\" returned the Scarecrow. \"You're no wiser than the rest of us, are  you? But let us make a wish at once. Who will swallow the first pill?\"    \"Suppose you do it,\" suggested Tip.    \"I can't,\" said the Scarecrow.    \"Why not? You've a mouth, haven't you?\" asked the boy.    \"Yes; but my mouth is painted on, and there's no swallow connected with it,'  answered the Scarecrow. \"In fact,\" he continued, looking from one to another  critically, \"I believe the boy and the Woggle-Bug are the only ones in our  party that are able to swallow.\"    Observing the truth of this remark, Tip said:    \"Then I will undertake to make the first wish. Give me one of the Silver  Pills.\"    This the Scarecrow tried to do; but his padded gloves were too clumsy to  clutch so small an object, and he held the box toward the boy while Tip  selected one of the pills and swallowed it.    \"Count!\" cried the Scarecrow.    \"One-half, one, three, five, seven, nine, eleven,!\" counted Tip. thirteen,  fifteen, seventeen.    \"Now wish!\" said the Tin Woodman anxiously:    But Just then the boy began to suffer such fearful pains that he became  alarmed.        227    \"The pill has poisoned me!\" he gasped; \"O--h! O-o-o-o-o! Ouch! Murder!  Fire! O-o-h!\" and here he rolled upon the bottom of the nest in such  contortions that he frightened them all.    \"What can we do for you. Speak, I beg!\" entreated the Tin Woodman, tears of  sympathy running down his nickel cheeks.    \"I--I don't know!\" answered Tip. \"O--h! I wish I'd never swallowed that  pill!\"    Then at once the pain stopped, and the boy rose to his feet again and found  the Scarecrow looking with amazement at the end of the pepper-box.    \"What's happened?\" asked the boy, a little ashamed of his recent exhibition.    \"Why, the three pills are in the box again!\" said the Scarecrow.    \"Of course they are,\" the Woggle-Bug declared. \"Didn't Tip wish that he'd  never swallowed one of them? Well, the wish came true, and he didn't swallow  one of them. So of course they are all three in the box.\"    \"That may be; but the pill gave me a dreadful pain, just the same,\" said the  boy.    \"Impossible!\" declared the Woggle-                   Line-Art Drawing        228  Bug. \"If you have never swallowed it, the pill can not have given you a  pain. And as your wish, being granted, proves you did not swallow the pill,  it is also plain that you suffered no pain.\"    \"Then it was a splendid imitation of a pain,\" retorted Tip, angrily.  \"Suppose you try the next pill yourself. We've wasted one wish already.\"    \"Oh, no, we haven't!\" protested the Scarecrow. \"Here are still three pills  in the box, and each pill is good for a wish.\"    \"Now you're making my head ache,\" said Tip. \"I can't understand the thing at  all. But I won't take another pill, I promise you!\" and with this remark he  retired sulkily to the back of the nest.    \"Well,\" said the Woggle-Bug, \"it remains for me to save us in my most Highly  Magnified and Thoroughly Educated manner; for I seem to be the only one able  and willing to make a wish. Let me have one of the pills.\"    He swallowed it without hesitation, and they all stood admiring his courage  while the Insect counted seventeen by twos in the same way that Tip had  done. And for some reason--perhaps because Woggle-Bugs have stronger  stomachs than boys--the silver pellet caused it no pain whatever.    \"I wish the Gump's broken wings mended, and        229  as good as new!\" said the Woggle-Bug, in a slow; impressive voice.    All turned to look at the Thing, and so quickly had the wish been granted  that the Gump lay before them in perfect repair, and as well able to fly  through the air as when it had first been brought to life on the roof of the  palace.                     Line-Art Drawing        230               Full page line-art drawing.        231               The Scarecrow Appeals to Glinda the Good      \"Hooray!\" shouted the Scarecrow, gaily. \"We can now leave this miserable  Jackdaws' nest whenever we please.\"    \"But it is nearly dark,\" said the Tin Woodman; \"and unless we wait until  morning to make our flight we may get into more trouble. I don't like these  night trips, for one never knows what will happen.\"    So it was decided to wait until daylight, and the adventurers amused  themselves in the twilight by searching the Jackdaws' nest for treasures.    The Woggle-Bug found two handsome bracelets of wrought gold, which fitted  his slender arms very well. The Scarecrow took a fancy for rings, of which  there were many in the nest. Before long he        232  had fitted a ring to each finger of his padded gloves, and not being content  with that display he added one more to each thumb. As he carefully chose  those rings set with sparkling stones, such as rubies, amethysts and  sapphires, the Scarecrow's hands now presented a most brilliant appearance.    \"This nest would be a picnic for Queen Jinjur,\" said he, musingly. \"for as  nearly as I can make out she and her girls conquered me merely to rob my  city of its emeralds.\"    The Tin Woodman was content with his diamond necklace and refused to accept  any additional decorations; but Tip secured a fine gold watch, which was  attached to a heavy fob, and placed it in his pocket with much pride. He  also pinned several jeweled brooches to Jack Pumpkinhead's red waistcoat,  and attached a lorgnette, by means of a fine chain, to the neck of the  Saw-Horse.    \"It's very pretty,\" said the creature, regarding the lorgnette approvingly;  \"but what is it for?\"    None of them could answer that question, however; so the Saw-Horse decided  it was some rare decoration and became very fond of it.    That none of the party might be slighted, they ended by placing several  large seal rings upon the points of the Gump's antlers, although that odd        233  personage seemed by no means gratified by the attention."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5402"],[0,"1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (#20)"],[1,"DUCK.
