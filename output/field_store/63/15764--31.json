At the  suitable moment, when the game was seen, the nearest leash was slipped,  and when they seemed to be on the point of losing another and sometimes  a third was slipped. The poor fox-hounds were not allowed to leave the  woods; the moment the game appeared in the open space they were driven  back by the stiff riders with their cruel whips. The true fox-hound  blood showed itself, and to succeed in beating some of them off the  trail, especially the young ones, required most rigorous action on the  part of all. This seemed to me a prostitution of the good qualities of a  race carefully bred for centuries, and, while realizing the necessity of  the practice for that variety of hunt, I could never look upon it with  complaisance.      [7] There are two varieties: the so-called white hare and the    so-called red hare. The former becomes white in winter, and weighs,    when full grown, ten pounds; the latter has a reddish gray coat which    does not change, and weighs about one and a half pounds less than the    other variety. The red hare frequents the fields less than does the    white. The foxes are the ordinary red ones.    It is just this sort of hunt[8] for which the barzoi has been specially  bred, and which has developed in him a tremendous spring; at the same  time it has given him less endurance than the English greyhound. It was  highly interesting to follow the hounds with the beaters; but, owing to  the thickness of the woods and the absence of trails, it was far from  being an easy task either for horse or rider. To remain at a post with a  leash of hounds was hardly active or exciting enough for me--except when  driving wolves--especially when the hounds could be followed, or when  the open hunt could be enjoyed. In the second case the hunters and  huntsmen with leashes form a line with intervals of 100 to 150 yards and  march for versts straight across the country, cracking the terrible  _nagaika_ and uttering peculiar exciting yells that would start game on  a parade ground. After a few days I flattered myself that I could  manage my leash fairly and slip them passably well. To two or three of  the party leashes were not intrusted, either because they did not desire  them or for their want of experience in general with dogs and horses. To  handle a leash well requires experience and considerable care. To  prevent tangling in the horse's legs, especially at the moment the game  is sighted, requires that the hounds be held well in hand, and that they  be not slipped until both have sighted the game. I much prefer the open  hunt to the post system. There is more action, and in fact more sport,  whether it happens that one or several leashes be slipped for the same  animal. When it is not possible to know whose dogs have taken the game,  it belongs to him who arrived first, providing that he has slipped his  leash.      [8] In Northern Russia, owing to the extensive forest, brush and marsh    lands, every effort was made to utilize the small open spaces or    clearings for the greyhounds, and this was the usual way of hunting;    while in Southern Russia, where steppes predominate, the open    hunt--_chasse a courre_--prevailed. This explains why the Crimean    barzoi also has more endurance than the now recognized type from the    north.    So much for the foxes and hares, but the more interesting hunting of  wolves remains. Few people except wolf-hunters--and they are reluctant  to admit it--know how rarely old wolves are caught with hounds. All  admit the danger of taking an old one either by a dagger thrust or alive  from under[9] barzois, however good they be. There is always a  possibility that the dogs may loosen their hold or be thrown off just at  the critical moment. But the greatest difficulty consists in the  inability of the hounds to hold the wolf even when they have overtaken  him. When it is remembered that a full-grown wolf is nearly twice as  heavy as the average barzoi, and that pound for pound he is stronger, it  is clear that to overtake and hold him requires great speed and grit on  the part of a pair of hounds.      [9] This is the Russian phrasing, and correctly describes the idea.    A famous kennel,[10] which two years since caught forty-six wolves by  the combined system of hunting, took in that number but one old  wolf--that is, three years or more old. The same kennel last year caught  twenty-six without having a single old one in the number. We likewise  failed to include in our captures a single old wolf. I mention these  facts to correct the false impression that exists with us concerning the  barzois, as evidenced by the great disappointment when two years since a  pair, in one of the Western States, failed to kill outright a full-grown  timber wolf. At the field trials on wolves, which take place twice a  year at Colomiaghi, near Petersburg, immediately after the regular  field trials on hares, I have seen as many as five leashes slipped  before an old wolf could be taken, and then it was done only with the  greatest difficulty. In fact, as much skill depends upon the _borzatnik_  (huntsman) as the dogs. Almost the very second the dogs take hold he  simply falls from his horse upon the wolf and endeavors to thrust the  unbreakable handle of his _nagaika_ between the jaws of the animal; he  then wraps the lash around the wolf's nose and head. If the hounds are  able to hold even a few seconds, the skilled _borzatnik_ has had  sufficient time, but there is danger even to the best. I saw an  experienced man get a thumb terribly lacerated while muzzling a wolf,  yet he succeeded, and in an incredibly short time. On another occasion,  even before the brace of hounds had taken firm neck or ear holds, I saw  a bold devil of a huntsman swing from his horse and in a twinkling lie  prone upon an old wolf's head. How this man, whose pluck I shall always  admire, was able to muzzle the brute without injury to himself, and with  inefficient support from his hounds, it is not easy to understand,  though I was within a few yards of the struggle. Such skill comes from  long experience, indifference to pain and, of course, pride in his  profession.      [10] That of the Grand Duke Nicolas Nicolaievitch.    Having hunted foxes and hares, and having been shooting as often as the  environs of Peschalkino and our time allowed, we changed our base to a  village twenty-two versts distant over the border in the government of  Yaroslav. It was a village like all others of this grain and flax  district, where the live stock and poultry shared the same roof with  their owners. A family of eleven wolves had been located about three  versts from it by a pair of huntsmen sent some days in advance; this  explained our arrival. In making this change, I do not now recall that  we saw a single house other than those of the peasant villages and the  churches. I fancy that in the course of time these peasants may have  more enlightenment, a greater ownership in the land, and may possibly  form a yeoman class. At the present the change, slow as it is, seems to  point in that direction. With their limited possessions, they are happy  and devoted subjects. The total of the interior decorations of every  house consists of icons, of cheap colored pictures of the imperial  family and of samovars. In our lodgings, the house of the village  _starost_, the three icons consumed a great part of the wall surface,  and were burdened with decorations of various colored papers. No one has  ever touched upon peasant life in Russia without mentioning the enormous  brick stove (_lezanka_[11]); and having on various hunts profited by  them, I mean to say a word in behalf of their advantages. Even as early  as the middle of September the cold continuous rains cause the gentle  warmth of the _lezanka_ to be cordially appreciated. On it and in its  vicinity all temperatures may be found. Its top offers a fine place for  keeping guns, ammunition and various articles free from moisture, and  for drying boots;[12] while the horizontal abutments constitute benches  well adapted to thawing out a chilled marrow, or a sleeping place for  those that like that sort of thing. A generous space is also allowed for  cooking purposes. In point of architecture there is nothing that can be  claimed for it but stability; excepting the interior upper surface of  the oven, there is not a single curve to break its right lines. It  harmonizes with the surroundings, and in a word answers all the  requirements of the owner as well as of the hunter, who always  preserves a warm remembrance of it.      [11] _Lezanka_ means something used for lying on.      [12] Hot oats poured into the boots were also used for drying them.    The wolves were located in a large marshy wood and, from information of  the scouts based on the midnight and dawn choruses, they were reported  \"at home.\" Accordingly we prepared for our visit with the greatest  precautions. When within a verst of the proposed curved line upon which  we were to take our stands with barzois, all dismounted and proceeded  through the marsh on foot, making as little noise as possible. The  silence was occasionally broken by the efforts of the barzois to slip  themselves after a cur belonging to one of the peasant beaters, that  insisted upon seeing the sport at the most aggravating distance for a  sight hound. It was finally decided to slip one good barzoi that, it was  supposed, could send the vexatious animal to another hunting ground; but  the cur, fortunately for himself, suddenly disappeared and did not show  himself again.    After wading a mile in the marshy bog, we were at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37206"],[0,"Sea and Sardinia (#20)"],[1,"eys, moorland with their intense summer sun and the  riverless, boggy behaviour of the water breed the pest inevitably. But  not very terribly, as far as one can make out: August and September  being the danger months. The natives don't like to admit there is any  malaria: a tiny bit, they say, a tiny bit. As soon as you come to the  _trees_ there is no more. So they say. For many miles the landscape is  moorland and down-like, with no trees. But wait for the trees. Ah, the  woods and forests of Gennargentu: the woods and forests higher up: no  malaria there!    The little engine whisks up and up, around its loopy curves as if it  were going to bite its own tail: we being the tail: then suddenly dives  over the sky-line out of sight. And the landscape changes. The famous  woods begin to appear. At first it is only hazel-thickets, miles of  hazel-thickets, all wild, with a few black cattle trying to peep at us  out of the green myrtle and arbutus scrub which forms the undergrowth;  and a couple of rare, wild peasants peering at the train. They wear the  black sheepskin tunic, with the wool outside, and the long stocking  caps. Like cattle they too peer out from between deep bushes. The myrtle  scrub here rises man-high, and cattle and men are smothered in it. The  big hazels rise bare above. It must be difficult getting about in these  parts.    Sometimes, in the distance one sees a black-and-white peasant riding  lonely across a more open place, a tiny vivid figure. I like so much the  proud instinct which makes a living creature distinguish itself from its  background. I hate the rabbity khaki protection-colouration. A  black-and-white peasant on his pony, only a dot in the distance beyond  the foliage, still flashes and dominates the landscape. Ha-ha! proud  mankind! There you ride! But alas, most of the men are still  khaki-muffled, rabbit-indistinguishable, ignominious. The Italians look  curiously rabbity in the grey-green uniform: just as our sand-colored  khaki men look doggy. They seem to scuffle rather abased, ignominious  on the earth. Give us back the scarlet and gold, and devil take the  hindmost.           *       *       *       *       *    The landscape really begins to change. The hillsides tilt sharper and  sharper. A man is ploughing with two small red cattle on a craggy,  tree-hanging slope as sharp as a roof-side. He stoops at the small  wooden plough, and jerks the ploughlines. The oxen lift their noses to  heaven, with a strange and beseeching snake-like movement, and taking  tiny little steps with their frail feet, move slantingly across the  slope-face, between rocks and tree-roots. Little, frail, jerky steps the  bullocks take, and again they put their horns back and lift their  muzzles snakily to heaven, as the man pulls the line. And he skids his  wooden plough round another scoop of earth. It is marvellous how they  hang upon that steep, craggy slope. An English labourer's eyes would  bolt out of his head at the sight.    There is a stream: actually a long tress of a water-fall pouring into a  little gorge, and a stream-bed that opens a little, and shows a  marvellous cluster of naked poplars away below. They are like ghosts.  They have a ghostly, almost phosphorescent luminousness in the shadow of  the valley, by the stream of water. If not phosphorescent, then  incandescent: a grey, goldish-pale incandescence of naked limbs and  myriad cold-glowing twigs, gleaming strangely. If I were a painter I  would paint them: for they seem to have living, sentient flesh. And the  shadow envelopes them.    Another naked tree I would paint is the gleaming mauve-silver fig, which  burns its cold incandescence, tangled, like some sensitive creature  emerged from the rock. A fig tree come forth in its nudity gleaming over  the dark winter-earth is a sight to behold. Like some white, tangled sea  anemone. Ah, if it could but answer! or if we had tree-speech!           *       *       *       *       *    Yes, the steep valley sides become almost gorges, and there are trees.  Not forests such as I had imagined, but scattered, grey, smallish oaks,  and some lithe chestnuts. Chestnuts with their long whips, and oaks with  their stubby boughs, scattered on steep hillsides where rocks crop out.  The train perilously winding round, half way up. Then suddenly bolting  over a bridge and into a completely unexpected station. What is more,  men crowd in--the station is connected with the main railway by a post  motor-omnibus.    An unexpected irruption of men--they may be miners or navvies or  land-workers. They all have huge sacks: some lovely saddle-bags with  rose-coloured flowers across the darkness. One old man is in full  black-and-white costume, but very dirty and coming to pieces. The others  wear the tight madder-brown breeches and sleeved waistcoats. Some have  the sheepskin tunic, and all wear the long stocking cap. And how they  smell! of sheep-wool and of men and goat. A rank scent fills the  carriage.    They talk and are very lively. And they have mediaeval faces, _ruse_,  never really abandoning their defences for a moment, as a badger or a  pole-cat never abandons its defences. There is none of the brotherliness  and civilised simplicity. Each man knows he must guard himself and his  own: each man knows the devil is behind the next bush. They have never  known the post-Renaissance Jesus. Which is rather an eye-opener.    Not that they are suspicious or uneasy. On the contrary, noisy,  assertive, vigorous presences. But with none of that implicit belief  that everybody will be and ought to be good to them, which is the mark  of our era. They don't expect people to be good to them: they don't want  it. They remind me of half-wild dogs that will love and obey, but which  won't be handled. They won't have their heads touched. And they won't be  fondled. One can almost hear the half-savage growl.    The long stocking caps they wear as a sort of crest, as a lizard wears  his crest at mating time. They are always moving them, settling them on  their heads. One fat fellow, young, with sly brown eyes and a young  beard round his face folds his stocking-foot in three, so that it rises  over his brow martial and handsome. The old boy brings his stocking-foot  over the left ear. A handsome fellow with a jaw of massive teeth pushes  his cap back and lets it hang a long way down his back. Then he shifts  it forward over his nose, and makes it have two sticking-out points,  like fox-ears, above his temples. It is marvellous how much expression  these caps can take on. They say that only those born to them can wear  them. They seem to be just long bags, nearly a yard long, of black  stockinette stuff.    The conductor comes to issue them their tickets. And they all take out  rolls of paper money. Even a little mothy rat of a man who sits opposite  me has quite a pad of ten-franc notes. Nobody seems short of a hundred  francs nowadays: nobody.    They shout and expostulate with the conductor. Full of coarse life they  are: but so coarse! The handsome fellow has his sleeved waistcoat open,  and his shirt-breast has come unbuttoned. Not looking, it seems as if he  wears a black undervest. Then suddenly, one sees it is his own hair. He  is quite black inside his shirt, like a black goat.    But there is a gulf between oneself and them. They have no inkling of  our crucifixion, our universal consciousness. Each of them is pivoted  and limited to himself, as the wild animals are. They look out, and they  see other objects, objects to ridicule or mistrust or to sniff curiously  at. But \"thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself\" has never entered  their souls at all, not even the thin end of it. They might love their  neighbour, with a hot, dark, unquestioning love. But the love would  probably leave off abruptly. The fascination of what is beyond them has  not seized on them. Their neighbour is a mere external. Their life is  centripetal, pivoted inside itself, and does not run out towards others  and mankind. One feels for the first time the real old mediaeval life,  which is enclosed in itself and has no interest in the world outside.    And so they lie about on the seats, play a game, shout, and sleep,  and settle their long stocking-caps: and spit. It is wonderful in  them that at this time of day they still wear the long stocking-caps  as part of their inevitable selves. It is a sign of obstinate and  powerful tenacity. They are not going to be broken in upon by  world-consciousness. They are not going into the world's common clothes.  Coarse, vigorous, determined, they will stick to their own coarse dark  stupidity and let the big world find its own way to its own enlightened  hell. Their hell is their own hell, they prefer it unenlightened.    And one cannot help wondering whether Sardinia will resist right  through. Will the last waves of enlightenment and world-unity break over  them and wash away the stocking-caps? Or is the tide of enlightenment  and world-unity already receding fast enough?    Certainly a reaction is setting in, away from the old universality,  back, away from cosmopolitanism and internationalism. Russia, with her  Third International, is at the same time reacting most violently away  from all other contact, back, recoiling on herself, into a fierce,  unapproachable Russianism. Which motion will conquer? The workman's  International, or the centripetal movement into national isolation? Are  we going to merge into one grey proletarian homogeneity?--or are we  going to swing back into more-or-less isolated, separate, defiant  communities?    Probably both. The workman's International movement will finally break  the flow towards cosmopolitanism and world-assimilation, and suddenly in  a crash the world will fly back into intense separations. The moment has  come when America, that extremist in world-assimilation and  world-oneness, is reacting into violent egocentricity, a"]]]
