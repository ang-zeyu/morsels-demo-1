After he was disfellowshiped in 1844  and later left the Church and wandered around through the organizations  of James J. Strang, Charles B. Thompson and John E. Page, receiving  \"ordinations,\" and honors, and positions, in these movements, he was  then received into the \"Reorganized\" Church on his original baptism.  Now, I ask the question in all candor of any fair minded Latter-day  Saint--Did he after this, in 1860, have any authority or Priesthood to  confer upon Joseph Smith of the \"Reorganization,\" much less the keys  and position of president of the High Priesthood; keys that he never  did hold?[6]      GURLEY'S AUTHORITY.    Zenas H. Gurley, who also laid hands on the head of Joseph in that  \"ordination,\" was ordained to the office of a Seventy in Nauvoo in  1844 under the direction of President Joseph Young. Members of the  \"Reorganization\" claim that he was ordained a Seventy in Far West,  Mo., in 1838, but this is not the fact. The records in the Historian's  office show that this man was ordained in 1844, as I have stated, and  the following year--April 6, 1845--he was made the senior president of  the Twenty-first quorum of Seventy. He left the Church as did William  Marks, and therefore lost his Priesthood and had none to confer on the  head of Joseph Smith.    Now the revelation clearly indicates that no man is called to build up  the Church unless it is known to the Church that he has been properly  ordained to that calling, by the heads of the Church. But these men  were not so called. On the 8th of July, 1904, I wrote to Mr. Heman C.  Smith, historian of the \"Reorganization\" as follows:        \"In the biographical sketch of Zenas H. Gurley, in the third      volume of your Church History, the statement is made that he,      (Zenas H. Gurley) was ordained to the office of a Seventy at Far      West, Missouri. Would you kindly furnish me with the date of this      ordination, and also state the authority on which the statement is      made, and oblige.\"    On the 15th of that month I received the following:        \"Replying to yours of July 8, will say that the church record in      the Recorder's office shows that Zenas H. Gurley was ordained to      the office of Seventy at Far West, Mo., in 1838; day and month      are not stated. This appears once in the hand-writing of Isaac      Sheen, former church recorder, and once in the handwriting of      Henry A. Stebbins, the present church recorder. Elder Stebbins'      memory is that he received it directly from Elder Gurley; and it is      presumable that Elder Sheen also had the information direct. It is      upon the authority of this record that the statement was made in      the biographical sketch.\"    You see they don't know very much about it, it is all presumption. I  cannot conceive of any reason why Mr. Gurley would desire to falsify  the record, and doubt that he ever made such a statement as the above.  The fact is, however, that he was not ordained a Seventy in Far West in  1838, but in Nauvoo in 1844.    Now we will see how much faith they put in the \"authority\" of Mr.  Gurley themselves. January 30, 1905, the following communication was  sent to the president of the \"Reorganization:\"        \"Will you be so kind as to answer for me the following questions:      Is it a teaching of the 'Reorganized' Church that the quorums of      Seventies are limited in number to seven quorums, or do you place a      limit on these quorums at all?        \"Do you recognize as valid any of the ordinations in Nauvoo in      1844-5, of men to the office of Seventy, under the direction of the      Twelve Apostles and first council of Seventy, beyond those of the      first seven quorums?        \"In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah, the      custom is to ordain Seventies and organize quorums beyond the      seventh, and as this practice has been opposed by some of the      Elders of the 'Reorganized' Church, I was prompted to inquire if      those Elders were in harmony with the doctrines of the Church.\"    On the 31st of January the following was received:        \"There are no provisions as revelations as law to the Church for      the organization of more than seven quorums of Seventy; for that      reason we do not recognize as valid any of the ordinations in      Nauvoo in 1844-5 beyond those of the first seven quorums; and      our teaching is that the number is necessarily limited by direct      provision of the law.\"    Thus you see, the president of the \"Reorganization\" repudiates the  Priesthood of the very man who \"ordained\" him to the office which he  pretends to hold. In conclusion let me add that these men did not  hold the keys of the kingdom and therefore could not bestow them on  another. The organization to which they belong is not the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and all the laying on of hands  that they can practice from now till dooms day, will not give one  single soul the Priesthood of God, for that can only come through the  proper channel--the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. An  ordination in the \"Reorganized\" Church is of no more effect than is  an ordination in the Methodist, Presbyterian, or Catholic church, for  those officiating do not hold the Priesthood, and are not recognized  of God. The Prophet did bestow the keys of the kingdom upon the head  of Brigham Young and with him his associates, the Twelve, as we have  shown with a multitude of unimpeachable testimony. If it was necessary  for all the prophets from Adam to Peter, James and John to confer their  keys upon the head of Joseph Smith (See D. & C., 110 and 128 sections),  notwithstanding he has been ordained to the Priesthood by angels, then  in all reason we must hold that it is necessary for him to bestow the  same power and keys of the kingdom on others which the evidence shows  that he did. The men who ordained Joseph Smith of the \"Reorganization\"  were not regularly ordained and did not hold the keys of the kingdom.  The Apostles constituted the second quorum in the Church and were  sustained in their calling as the First Presidency of the Church by the  vote of the people August 8, 1844, and again at the fall conference in  October of that same year.    I call the attention of the Latter-day Saints once more to the fact  previously mentioned (section 43:4-6) that there is but one at a  time who holds the keys and the right to receive revelation for the  Church, and that man is the President of the Church. And when the First  Presidency is disorganized through the death of the President, then,  according to revelation, the Twelve Apostles become the presiding  quorum of the Church, and then, if the Lord has any revelations to  give to His people they will come through the proper channels--the  President of the Twelve. If we will keep this in mind it will be a key  to us as the Lord intended that it should be, by which we may gage  and weigh the pretended revelations of men. When we see this man, or  that man, or perhaps that woman, or child, giving revelations as was  the case in the \"Reorganized\" Church when Jason W. Briggs, Zenas H.  Gurley, Henry H. Deam and the daughter of Zenas H. Gurley, received  \"revelations\" bearing on the organization of their cult, we will  know assuredly that these things are not of God. The Lord will never  ignore the presiding officer and quorum of the Church, for he respects  authority, as He requires us to respect authority. And it will always  be a key to us, if we will bear it in mind, that whenever He has a  revelation or commandment to give to His people that it will come  through the presiding officer of the Church. This is plainly taught in  the revelations.    If there is within the sound of my voice one soul who has not received  a testimony of this work, and that Brigham Young was the right man in  the right place, and the rightful successor, and so on down to the  present day, then I say to you, when you go home go before the Lord  in the spirit of repentance, and humility, and prayer, and ask Him in  faith for that knowledge and He will hear your prayers. There is no  reason why any man should be deceived, for the Lord has promised us  that we shall receive if we ask and if we knock it shall be opened unto  us. By keeping the commandments of God, all men may know of this work  that it is true. If you will do this, then when these deceivers and  pretenders, these men who delight in destroying your faith, come to you  saying that you are in the dark, you can say to them, get behind me,  for I will not be deceived by you. I know we have the truth, that this  is the work of the Lord, that Jesus is the Redeemer of the world, and  that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God and was called to stand at the  head of this dispensation, and those keys and that position he will  ever hold. He was not a fallen Prophet, but died a martyr to this work.  May God bless you. Amen.      Footnotes    1. Serious objection is raised to this line of argument by the author  of the \"defense,\" who attempts to place me in a false position by  imputing to me expressions that are not here conveyed. Had he been  honest in his argument he would have fairly presented what I have  had to say; but this he has studiously avoided throughout his reply.  Here he argues that the provisions in these revelations regarding  a \"successor\" were not limited in their scope, but were to be  carried out during the life of Joseph Smith. I respectfully call  his attention to an editorial in the _Saints' Herald_ of August 18,  1888. At that time Joseph Smith, his president, and William W. Blair,  counselor, were the editors of the _Herald_. The article is called  \"_The Power to Perpetuate the Church_.\" After quoting these passages  the author--presumably the editor, or his assistant, for it is an  editorial--continues:    (d) \"The authority to ordain is given unto the Church.    (e) \" 'Verily, I say"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5039"],[0,"State of the Union Addresses (#20)"],[1,"union-management relationships, disputes over the interpretation of  contract terms are settled peaceably by negotiation or arbitration.  Legislation should be enacted to provide machinery whereby unsettled  disputes concerning the interpretation of an existing agreement may be  referred by either party to final and binding arbitration.    Point number two is the extension of facilities within the Department of  Labor for assisting collective bargaining.    One of our difficulties in avoiding labor strife arises from a lack of  order in the collective bargaining process. The parties often do not have a  dear understanding of their responsibility for settling disputes through  their own negotiations. We constantly see instances where labor or  management resorts to economic force without exhausting the possibilities  for agreement through the bargaining process. Neither the parties nor the  Government have a definite yardstick for determining when and how  Government assistance should be invoked. There is need for integrated  governmental machinery to provide the successive steps of mediation,  voluntary arbitration, and--ultimately in appropriate cases--ascertainment  of the facts of the dispute and the reporting of the facts to the public.  Such machinery would facilitate and expedite the settlement of disputes.    Point number three is the broadening of our program of social legislation  to alleviate the causes of workers' insecurity.    On June 11, 1946, in my message vetoing the Case Bill, I made a  comprehensive statement of my views concerning labor-management relations.  I said then, and I repeat now, that the solution of labor-management  difficulties is to be found not only in legislation dealing directly with  labor relations, but also in a program designed to remove the causes of  insecurity felt by many workers in our industrial society. In this  connection, for example, the Congress should consider the extension and  broadening of our social security system, better housing, a comprehensive  national health program, and provision for a fair minimum wage.    Point number four is the appointment of a Temporary Joint Commission to  inquire into the entire field of labor-management relations.    I recommend that the Congress provide for the appointment of a Temporary  Joint Commission to undertake this broad study.    The President, the Congress, and management and labor have a continuing  responsibility to cooperate in seeking and finding the solution of these  problems. I therefore recommend that the Commission be composed as follows:  twelve to be chosen by the Congress from members of both parties in the  House and the Senate, and eight representing the public, management and  labor, to be appointed by the President.    The Commission should be charged with investigating and making  recommendations upon certain major subjects, among others:    First, the special and unique problem of nationwide strikes in vital  industries affecting the public interest. In particular, the Commission  should examine into the question of how to settle or prevent such strikes  without endangering our general democratic freedoms.    Upon a proper solution of this problem may depend the whole industrial  future of the United States. The paralyzing effects of a nationwide strike  in such industries as transportation, coal, oil, steel, or communications  can result in national disaster. We have been able to avoid such disaster,  in recent years, only by the use of extraordinary war powers. All those  powers will soon be gone. In their place there must be created an adequate  system and effective machinery in these vital fields. This problem will  require careful study and a bold approach, but an approach consistent with  the preservation of the rights of our people. The need is pressing. The  Commission should give this its earliest attention.    Second, the best methods and procedures for carrying out the collective  bargaining process. This should include the responsibilities of labor and  management to negotiate freely and fairly with each other, and to refrain  from strikes or lockouts until all possibilities of negotiation have been  exhausted.    Third, the underlying causes of labor management disputes.    Some of the subjects presented here for investigation involve long-range  study. Others can be considered immediately by the Commission and its  recommendations can be submitted to the Congress in the near future.    I recommend that this Commission make its first report, including specific  legislative recommendations, not later than March 15, 1947.    RESTRICTION Of MONOPOLY AND PROMOTION OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE    The second major policy I desire to lay before you has to do with the  growing concentration of economic power and the threat to free competitive  private enterprise. In 1941 the Temporary National Economic Committee  completed a comprehensive investigation into the workings of the national  economy. The Committee's study showed that, despite a half century of  anti-trust law enforcement, one of the gravest threats to our welfare lay  in the increasing concentration of power in the hands of a small number of  giant organizations.    During the war, this long-standing tendency toward economic concentration  was accelerated. As a consequence, we now find that to a greater extent  than ever before, whole industries are dominated by one or a few large  organizations which can restrict production in the interest of higher  profits and thus reduce employment and purchasing power.    In an effort to assure full opportunity and free competition to business we  will vigorously enforce the anti-trust laws. There is much the Congress can  do to cooperate and assist in this program.    To strengthen and enforce the laws that regulate business practices is not  enough. Enforcement must be supplemented by positive measures of aid to new  enterprises. Government assistance, research programs, and credit powers  should be designed and used to promote the growth of new firms and new  industries. Assistance to small business is particularly important at this  time when thousands of veterans who are potential business and industrial  leaders are beginning their careers.    We should also give special attention to the decentralization of industry  and the development of areas that are now under-industrialized.    HOUSING    The third major policy is also of great importance to the national economy:  an aggressive program to encourage housing construction. The first federal  program to relieve the veterans' housing shortage was announced in February  1946. In 1946 one million family housing units have been put under  construction and more than 665,000 units have already been completed. The  rate of expansion in construction has broken all records.    In the coming year the number of dwelling units built will approach, if not  surpass, the top construction year of 1926. The primary responsibility to  deliver housing at reasonable prices that veterans can afford rests with  private industry and with labor. The Government will continue to expedite  the flow of key building materials, to limit nonresidential construction,  and to give financial support where it will do the most good. Measures to  stimulate rental housing and new types of housing construction will receive  special emphasis.    To reach our long-range goal of adequate housing for all our people,  comprehensive housing legislation is urgently required, similar to the  non-partisan bill passed by the Senate last year. At a minimum, such  legislation should open the way for rebuilding the blighted areas of our  cities and should establish positive incentives for the investment of  billions of dollars of private capital in large-scale rental housing  projects. It should provide for improvement of housing in rural areas and  for the construction, over a 4-year period, of half a million units of  public low-rental housing. It should authorize a single peacetime federal  housing agency to assure efficient use of our resources on the vast housing  front.    FISCAL AFFAIRS    The fourth major policy has to do with the balancing of the budget. In a  prosperous period such as the present one, the budget of the Federal  Government should be balanced. Prudent management of public finance  requires that we begin the process of reducing the public debt. The budget  which I shall submit to you this week has a small margin of surplus. In the  Budget Message I am making recommendations which, if accepted, will result  in a substantially larger surplus which should be applied to debt  retirement. One of these recommendations is that the Congress take early  action to continue throughout the next fiscal year the war excise tax rates  which, under the present law, will expire on June 30, 1947.    Expenditures relating to the war are still high. Considerable sums are  required to alleviate world famine and suffering. Aid to veterans will  continue at peak level. The world situation is such that large military  expenditures are required. Interest on the public debt and certain other  costs are irreducible. For these reasons I have had to practice stringent  economy in preparing the budget; and I hope that the Congress will  cooperate in this program of economy.    AGRICULTURE    The fifth major policy has to do with the welfare of our farm population.    Production of food reached record heights in 1946. Much of our tremendous  grain crop can readily be sold abroad and thus will become no threat to our  domestic markets. But in the next few years American agriculture can face  the same dangers it did after World War I. In the early twenties the Nation  failed to maintain outlets for the new productive capacity of our  agricultural plant. It failed to provide means to protect the farmer while  he adjusted his acreage to peacetime demands.    The result we all remember too well."]]]
