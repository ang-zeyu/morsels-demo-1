The  weather at this time cleared a little and from the masthead a low point  seemed to form a kind of entrance...into a deep bight or bay, a reef of  rocks was also seen to the westward of it. Stood in pretty close along  the edge of the reef and sent Mr. Bowen in the gig to overhaul the place.  Observed the rocks of this reef to be full of seals, sea horses and  elephants. The appearance of this place being favourable...stood further  in and perceived it was a deep bay.    \"Sunday, 17th January. At 1 P.M. came to anchor--the bottom coarse  sand--from where we lay East point of land bore east-north-east distant  10 miles, the Seal Reef south by east 3 or 4 miles...we sounded every  part of this place where a vessel would most likely anchor and found it  14 to 7 fathoms. At 2 P.M. Mr. Bowen came off, he brought on board 3  seals with hair of prime fur and told me there was a vast quantity on  shore. Elephants are also in abundance and the woods full of kangaroo,  emus, badgers, etc., some few shells were found, no water seen as yet.  After dinner I went on shore: the brush is very thick which rendered it  impossible to get any way in, there is little doubt of plenty of water  being here as we in our search started 15 or 20 kangaroo from 30 to 40  pounds weight. An emu was caught by the dog about 50 pounds weight and  surprising fat. At one place on this beach an acre of ground at least was  covered with elephants of a most amazing size and several were all along  the beach and playing in the water. At 7 P.M. I came on board. A sea  watch with the proper officer had been set as has been usual ever since  we made this island...At midnight the wind increasing made sail out of  the bay as I preferred riding out the gale in Elephant Bay. At 11 A.M.  came to anchor in Elephant Bay. We have now overhauled and surveyed this  island from its north-west and west points to its south-west points being  in length about 55 or 60 miles, and although westerly winds that have  blown for such a length of time have retarded our voyage yet they have  enabled me to strictly search every part of the island between  aforementioned points, and should a north-east wind come and remain  steady for a few days we will be able to overhaul the remaining part of  the island with equal accuracy. Of the advantages to be derived from this  fine island I shall say but little, the plain truth is to be seen in this  journal. It contains plenty of wood and water, the woods are full of  animals and excellent of their kind, the shores are lined with fine oil  (if I may be allowed the expression) and this part of the island has two  good bays in it well sheltered from all the dangerous winds. A vessel may  anchor as I did unless the wind blows from the east, south-east or  north-east or north points of the compass. I named this last discovery  the Bay of Seals from the number of these animals on the shores of it,  and the rocks outside the bay Seal Rocks.    \"Monday, 18th January. First and middle parts it blew a gale but with  long lulls at times, latter a harder gale with much heavier squalls than  I have yet seen in this country (the Western Port gale excepted) and it  is with great satisfaction that I am able to say that our little vessel  has rode it out as yet with one anchor and half a cable--a proof of the  goodness of the holding ground...At 8 the boat brought on board a turn of  water and 2 kangaroo were caught--the increase of the gale hindered the  boat from returning on shore.    \"Tuesday, 19th January. From noon till 4 P.M. the gale continued. By  sundown it was moderate weather; the boat returned on board...a wambuck  was caught, served it, a swan and a kangaroo to ship's company.    \"Thursday, 21st January. A.M. Sent Mr. Bowen in the gig to Elephant Rock  with directions to sound all the parts of this bay we did not run over in  the vessel.    \"Friday, 22nd January. P.M. The boat returned on board. Mr. Bowen found  the soundings all the distance from the vessel from 9 to 10 and 11  fathoms and good ground. Close to the Elephant Rock there are 10 fathoms.  This rock is about 1 1/2 miles in circumference and it is entirely  covered with seals of prime fur some of which the officer brought, there  might be 6 or 7,000 seals of different sizes on shore. A.M. Sent boat to  Elephant Rock for skins and another for wood and water.    \"Saturday, January 23rd. P.M. The launch returned with some sealskins of  prime fur and I was told that the Rock was full of mutton-birds, in  consequence of this I had the boat on shore and procured 80 or 90 of  them, served ditto to the people.    \"Sunday, January 24th. Throughout this 24 hours the weather has been  remarkably thick and hazy...stood off and on till 4 P.M...then we made  some sail to get sight of land if possible before dark and by 8 P.M. saw  the north-west point of the Bay of Seals being north by west distant 5  miles, 2 Seal Rocks distant 6 miles north by east...at 2 A.M. found the  vessel close to the breakers and a strong ripple of a current with a very  confused jump of a sea. Tacked and stood off till daylight. By 6 A.M. we  saw the distant looming of the land, bearing north-west, and perceived  that all round us...lay rocks and dangerous breakers, one bore south-west  (a large rock 3 miles) another south-south-west 3 1/2 another south 4  miles and one west 5 miles, that one which bore south-south-west, John  Johnson told me he thought it Harbinger Rock, having seen it when with  Mr. Black, commander of the Harbinger. At 8 A.M. made sail to the  north-east...At noon strong winds at south hauled her off East.    \"Before I close this log it may be proper to observe that from the very  long run of bad weather we have had and being so often baffled in our  attempts to get round the end of the island which is full of danger and  moreover have seen all the land that lies between its north-west and west  points to its south-west points from which these dangerous rocks and  breakers lie about 7 or 8 miles I now determined to stand off to  Albatross Island in a straight line for this reef for we could not  venture too close unto land it having every appearance of a gale from  south or south-east either of which blow in on the shore. This reef I  named Lady Nelson Reef from our so narrowly escaping being on shore on  it, this however is only to distinguish it from others for I have not the  least doubt but it is what Mr. Bass gave me a sketch of, the latitude and  longitude so well correspond with his. I fancy also it is what was seen  in the Martha schooner in 1799 along with the land, all of which is one  island...Thus we took leave of this large and fine island where the  benevolent hand of Providence has fixed the chief necessaries of life and  the means to procure some of its luxuries. We kept on East expecting it  would soon blow a gale and a heavy sea up. I much lament not having as  yet had it in my power from the series of unfavourable weather we have  had so exactly to comply with the Commander-in-Chief's orders as I could  have wished.    \"Monday, January 25th. From noon till half-past 1 P.M. we run due east 8  miles, we then saw from masthead Hunter's Islands bearing (the middle of  them) south-south-east distant 5 or 6 leagues...Under the lee of Three  Hummock Island in smooth water we laid under easy sail off and on all  night--found the tides here to run very strong. In the morning I sent  boat on shore with the First Mate and 2 hands, by noon they returned  having shot 2 ducks and found a spring of water, some small kangaroo were  seen but not worth shooting even could they have been got at. The  footsteps of a man were seen on shore, perhaps one of the Harrington's  Lascars as the foot was measured and found very small. The shores of this  island are bold rock and some dangerous reefs lie off it, one of which (a  sunken one) we did not escape by 10 yards...Lady Nelson's Reef is  east-south-east and west-north-west distance about 30 miles in Latitude  40 degrees 20 minutes 30 seconds south and Longitude by Time-keeper 145  degrees 40 minutes 53 seconds, it has many sandy bights in it where I  would not scruple to anchor in south-south-west, south-east and east  winds.    \"Tuesday, January 26th. At half-past 12 bore away for Elephant Rock. At 5  P.M. the south extreme of Three Hummock Island bore south by east  distance 19 or 20 miles...At sundown extremes of Governor King's Island  bore south-west to west by north distance 11 or 12 miles. At 8 P.M.  shortened sail and threw her head off shore intending to have lain off  and on all night, this was done. At 4 A.M. made sail for land and we  exactly made Elephant Rock right ahead therefore the distance between  Three Hummock Island and Elephant Rock is north 65 west distance 44 miles  true by compass north-west by west. We then stood on for the sandy capes  or bluffs and by half-past 9 A.M. the largest and perpendicular one bore  south by west distant 8 or 9 miles, this I named Cape Farewell. I took a  departure from it intending to run to Cape Albany (Otway); the wind from  4 A.M. has blown at east-north-east and from that to north-east with its  usual hazy dirty weather, in consequence of which we kept our wind till  noon to be certain of clearing the shoals and breakers lying off this end  of the island. At noon saw the looming of the western end of the island  bearing distant perhaps 12 miles, the direct distance from Mid Hummock of  that island to Cape Farewell is north 51 degrees west distance 56 miles  true but by compass north-west a little westerly.\"      CHAPTER 6.    THE DISCOVERY OF PORT PHILLIP.    On leaving King Island, Murray, on January 30th (civil time),* (* In this  chapter civil time is given in the author's observations. The time in the  logs throughout is according to nautical reckoning, i.e. the day  beginning at noon before the civil reckoning.) returned again to Western  Port and next day, at 4 A.M. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7524"],[0,"The Germany and the Agricola of Tacitus (#20)"],[1,"by the father's side; here it signifies children born  after there was already an heir to the name and property of the father.    [118] Justin has a similar thought concerning the Scythians: \"Justice is  cultivated by the dispositions of the people, not by the laws.\" (ii.  2.) How inefficacious the good laws here alluded to by Tacitus were  in preventing enormities among the Romans, appears from the frequent  complaints of the senators, and particularly of Minucius Felix; \"I  behold you, exposing your babes to the wild beasts and birds, or  strangling the unhappy wretches with your own hands. Some of you, by  means of drugs, extinguish the newly-formed man within your bowels, and  thus commit parricide on your offspring before you bring them into the  world.\" (Octavius, c. 30.) So familiar was this practice grown at Rome,  that the virtuous Pliny apologises for it, alleging that \"the great  fertility of some women may require such a licence.\"--xxix. 4, 37.    [119] _Nudi ac sordidi_ does not mean \"in nakedness and filth,\" as most  translators have supposed. Personal filth is inconsistent with the daily  practice of bathing mentioned c. 22; and _nudus_ does not necessarily  imply absolute nakedness (see note 4, p. 293).    [120] This age appears at first to have been twelve years; for then a  youth became liable to the penalties of law. Thus in the Salic law it is  said, \"If a child under twelve commit a fault, 'fred,' or a mulct, shall  not be required of him.\" Afterwards the term was fifteen years of  age. Thus in the Ripuary law, \"A child under fifteen shall not be  responsible.\" Again, \"If a man die, or be killed, and leave a son;  before he have completed his fifteenth year, he shall neither prosecute  a cause, nor be called upon to answer in a suit: but at this term, he  must either answer himself, or choose an advocate. In like manner with  regard to the female sex.\" The Burgundian law provides to the same  effect. This then was the term of majority, which in later times, when  heavier armor was used, was still longer delayed.    [121] This is illustrated by a passage in Caesar (Bell. Gall. vi. 21):  \"They who are the latest in proving their virility are most commended.  By this delay they imagine the stature is increased, the strength  improved, and the nerves fortified. To have knowledge of the other  sex before twenty years of age, is accounted in the highest degree  scandalous.\"    [122] Equal not only in age and constitution, but in condition. Many of  the German codes of law annex penalties to those of both sexes who marry  persons of inferior rank.    [123] Hence, in the history of the Merovingian kings of France, so many  instances of regard to sisters and their children appear, and so many  wars undertaken on their account.    [124] The court paid at Rome to rich persons without children, by the  Haeredipetae, or legacy-hunters, is a frequent subject of censure and  ridicule with the Roman writers.    [125] Avengers of blood are mentioned in the law of Moses, Numb. xxxv.  19. In the Roman law also, under the head of \"those who on account of  unworthiness are deprived of their inheritance,\" it is pronounced, that  \"such heirs as are proved to have neglected revenging the testator's  death, shall be obliged to restore the entire profits.\"    [126] It was a wise provision, that among this fierce and warlike  people, revenge should be commuted for a payment. That this intention  might not be frustrated by the poverty of the offender, his whole family  were conjointly bound to make compensation.    [127] All uncivilized nations agree in this property, which becomes less  necessary as a nation improves in the arts of civil life.    [128] _Convictibus et hospitiis_. \"Festivities and entertainments.\" The  former word applies to friends and fellow-countrymen; the latter, to  those not of the same tribe, and foreigners. Caesar (Bell. Gall. vi. 23)  says, \"They think it unlawful to offer violence to their guests, who,  on whatever occasion they come to them, are protected from injury,  and considered as sacred. Every house is open to them, and provision  everywhere set before them.\" Mela (iii. 3) says of the Germans, \"They  make right consist in force, so that they are not ashamed of robbery:  they are only kind to their guests, and merciful to suppliants. The  Burgundian law lays a fine of three solidi on every man who refuses his  roof or hearth to the coming guest.\" The Salic law, however, rightly  forbids the exercise of hospitality to atrocious criminals; laying a  penalty on the person who shall harbor one who has dug up or despoiled  the dead? till he has made satisfaction to the relations.    [129] The clause here put within brackets is probably misplaced;  since it does not connect well either with what goes before or what  follows.[130] The Russians are at present the most remarkable among the  northern nations for the use of warm bathing. Some of the North American  tribes also have their hypocausts, or stoves.    [131] Eating at separate tables is generally an indication of voracity.  Traces of it may be found in Homer, and other writers who have described  ancient manners. The same practice has also been observed among the  people of Otaheite; who occasionally devour vast quantities of food.    [132] The following article in the Salic law shows at once the frequency  of these bloody quarrels, and the laudable endeavors of the legislature  to restrain them;--\"If at a feast where there are four or five men in  company, one of them be killed, the rest shall either convict one as the  offender, or shall jointly pay the composition for his death. And this  law shall extend to seven persons present at an entertainment.\"    [133] The same custom is related by Herodotus, i. p. 66, as prevailing  among the Persians.    [134] Of this liquor, beer or ale, Pliny speaks in the following  passage: \"The western nations have their intoxicating liquor, made of  steeped grain. The Egyptians also invented drinks of the same kind. Thus  drunkenness is a stranger in no part of the world; for these liquors are  taken pure, and not diluted as wine is. Yet, surely, the Earth thought  she was producing corn. Oh, the wonderful sagacity of our vices! we have  discovered how to render even water intoxicating.\"--xiv. 22.    [135] Mela says, \"Their manner of living is so rude and savage, that  they eat even raw flesh; either fresh killed, or softened by working  with their hands and feet, after it has grown stiff in the hides of  tame or wild animals.\" (iii. 3.) Florus relates that the ferocity of  the Cimbri was mitigated by their feeding on bread and dressed meat, and  drinking wine, in the softest tract of Italy.--iii. 3.    [136] This must not be understood to have been cheese; although Caesar  says of the Germans, \"Their diet chiefly consists of milk, cheese and  flesh.\" (Bell. Gall. vi. 22.) Pliny, who was thoroughly acquainted with  the German manners, says more accurately, \"It is surprising that the  barbarous nations who live on milk should for so many ages have been  ignorant of, or have rejected, the preparation of cheese; especially  since they thicken their milk into a pleasant tart substance, and a fat  butter: this is the scum of milk, of a thicker consistence than what is  called the whey. It must not be omitted that it has the properties of  oil, and is used as an unguent by all the barbarians, and by us for  children.\"--xi. 41.    [137] This policy has been practised by the Europeans with regard to the  North American savages, some tribes of which have been almost totally  extirpated by it.    [138] St. Ambrose has a remarkable passage concerning this spirit  of gaming among a barbarous people:--\"It is said that the Huns, who  continually make war upon other nations, are themselves subject to  usurers, with whom they run in debt at play; and that, while they live  without laws, they obey the laws of the dice alone; playing when drawn  up in line of battle; carrying dice along with their arms, and perishing  more by each others' hands than by the enemy. In the midst of victory  they submit to become captives, and suffer plunder from their own  countrymen, which they know not how to bear from the foe. On this  account they never lay aside the business of war, because, when they  have lost all their booty by the dice, they have no means of acquiring  fresh supplies for play, but by the sword. They are frequently borne  away with such a desperate ardor, that, when the loser has given up his  arms, the only part of his property which he greatly values, he sets the  power over his life at a single cast to the winner or usurer. It is a  fact, that a person, known to the Roman emperor, paid the price of a  servitude which he had by this means brought upon himself, by suffering  death at the command of his master.\"    [139] The condition of these slaves was the same as that of the vassals,  or serfs, who a few centuries ago made the great body of the people  in every country in Europe. The Germans, in after times, imitating the  Romans, had slaves of inferior condition, to whom the name of slave  became appropriated; while those in the state of rural vassalage were  called _lidi_.    [140] A private enemy could not be slain with impunity, since a fine  was affixed to homicide; but a man might kill his own slave without  any punishment. If, however, he killed another person's slave, he was  obliged to pay his price to the owner.    [141] The amazing height of power and insolence to which freedmen  arrived by making themselves subservient to the vices of the prince,  is a striking characteristic of the reigns of some of the worst of the  Roman emperors.    [142] In Rome, on the other hand, the practice of usury was, as our  author terms it, \"an ancient evil, and a perpetual source of sedition  and discord.\"--Annals, vi. 16.    [143] All the copies read _per vices_, \"by turns,\" or alternately; but"]]]
