The whole proceeding was done quietly but determinedly. The only force  employed was the breaking in of the doors to the _Expositor_ office  when admittance was denied. Some of the leading apostates set fire to  their houses and fled to Carthage, the county seat of Hancock County,  with the lie on their lips that their lives were in danger. Fortunately  the police in Nauvoo discovered the houses of these men on fire and  extinguished the flames before any material harm was done, so that they  had no blackened ruins to point to as a witness of Mormon atrocity.    All the mischief anticipated from suppressing the _Expositor_ nuisance  came to pass. \"The Mormons had laid unhallowed hands upon the press!\"  \"They opposed the freedom of speech!\" \"The laws were no longer a  protection to life and property in Nauvoo!\" \"A mob at Nauvoo under a  city ordinance had violated the highest privilege in the government!\"  Such were the sentences that flew as if on the wings of the wind to all  parts of Illinois.    A mass meeting was held at Warsaw, the prevailing sentiment of which  was that \"to seek redress in the ordinary mode would be utterly  ineffectual.\" The meeting therefore adopted resolutions announcing  that those present were at all times ready to co-operate with their  fellow citizens in Missouri and Iowa to exterminate--_utterly  exterminate_--the Mormon leaders--the authors their troubles. Another  mass meeting was held at Carthage at which the Warsaw resolutions were  adopted.    The anti-Mormon press teemed with intemperate articles, outrageously  false accusations and frantic appeals to the very worst passions of  human nature. The citizens of Nauvoo were represented as a horde of  lawless ruffians and brigands; anti-American and anti-republican;  steeped in crime and iniquity; opposed to freedom of speech and to  progress; among whom neither persons nor property were secure. They  were accused also of having designs upon the citizens of Illinois and  of the United States; and for these things the people were called upon  to rise _en masse_ and utterly exterminate them.    While these falsehoods were being extensively circulated through  Illinois and the surrounding states, it was the most difficult thing,  almost impossible to get a true statement of the case before the  country. True accounts of the proceedings of the city council in the  _Expositor_ affair were published in the _Times and Seasons_ and also  in the _Neighbor_; but it was impossible to circulate them in Hancock  and surrounding counties, as they were destroyed at the post offices.  To get them abroad Elder Taylor had to send them a distance of thirty  or forty miles from Nauvoo before posting them. In some instances they  had to be taken to St. Louis, a distance of two hundred miles, to  ensure their reaching their destination.    The systematic circulation of falsehood on the one hand, and the  suppression of the truth on the other, resulted in a tremendous storm  of indignation against the Saints--especially against the leading  Elders--that threatened to overwhelm them.    In the midst of this excitement, complaint was made by Francis M.  Higbee, and a warrant issued against the members of the city council  for riot in destroying the _Expositor_ press and fixtures. The warrant  was issued by Mr. Morrison, a justice of the peace in Carthage, and  required the constable, Mr. Bettisworth, to bring the parties named  in it before him, \"or some other justice of the peace,\" to be dealt  with according to law. When the writ was served on the members of  the council they expressed a perfect willingness to submit to an  investigation of their proceedings; but as the law of the state made it  the privilege of the accused to \"appear before the issuer of the writ  or any other justice of the peace,\" they desired to avail themselves  of this privilege, and go before some other magistrate than Justice  Morrison, alleging as their reason for this that it was unsafe for  them to go to Carthage. The constable refused to grant their request,  whereupon they sued for a writ of _habeas corpus_ before the municipal  court of Nauvoo, and on a hearing of the case they were dismissed. [2]    This was declared to be resistance to the law, and made use of to  further influence the public mind against the Mormons. Mobs were  therefore assembled and the work of violence inaugurated by kidnapping,  whipping and otherwise abusing the Saints living in out-lying districts  of Nauvoo. For protection the people thus abused fled to Nauvoo, and  this was heralded abroad as the massing of the Mormon forces.    Governor Ford was kept informed of all that was transpiring in Nauvoo  by the city authorities, and in answer to the question, \"What course  shall we pursue in the event of an armed mob coming against the city,\"  he replied that Joseph Smith was Lieutenant-General of the Nauvoo  Legion; it was his duty to protect the city and surrounding country,  and issued orders to him to that effect. Thus qualified to act, by the  Governor of the state, the Legion was called together and measures were  taken for the defense of the city: as the mob forces grew bolder every  day, Nauvoo was at last placed under martial law.    Footnotes    1. Ford's History of Illinois, p. 246.    2. Subsequently, at the instance of Judge Thomas, the circuit judge of  the judicial district in which Nauvoo was located, the city council  submitted to a new trial, on the same charge, before Squire Wells and  were again acquitted.        CHAPTER XIV.    ARRIVAL OF GOVERNOR FORD IN CARTHAGE--MOB CONVERTED INTO MILITIA--ELDER  TAYLOR AND DR. BERNHISEL GO TO CARTHAGE--DEMANDS OF GOVERNOR  FORD--PLEDGES THE HONOR OF THE STATE FOR JOSEPH'S PROTECTION--JOSEPH  STARTS FOR THE WEST--RETURNS--ARRIVAL AND RECEPTION AT CARTHAGE.    Meantime the mobocrats were active in making their misrepresentations  to the governor. He finally determined to visit the scenes of the  difficulty. He went from Springfield to Carthage, the head-quarters of  the mob forces, and received them as the militia of the state.    His first move was to send a message to Nauvoo asking that a committee  be appointed to represent to him the state of affairs in the county.  Elder Taylor and Dr. J. M. Bernhisel were appointed that committee.  Armed with affidavits and duplicates of documents which had been sent  to the Governor at Springfield--he had missed the messengers bearing  them by starting for Carthage--they left on the evening of the 21st  of June, to wait upon the Governor, arriving in Carthage about eleven  o'clock at night. The town was filled with a rabble more or less under  the influence of liquor. The yelling and swearing would justify them in  the belief that they had arrived in pandemonium.    Elder Taylor and companion put up at the Hamilton House; the Governor  also had his rooms there. On retiring they had to pass through another  bed-room to get to their own, and stretched out on the bed was one  Jackson, a vicious cut-throat and desperado, one of the chief enemies  of the Saints. On reaching the chamber assigned them, Elder Taylor  hinted to his companion that things looked suspicious, and took the  precaution to see that his weapons were in order.    No sooner had they retired than the young apostate Chauncy Higbee  came to their door, and stated that Daniel Garn was under arrest and  was about to be committed to prison; that as he believed him to be an  honest man, one who had done wrong only through the instigation of  others, he thought it a pity for him to be committed to prison, and he  had come to ask Dr. Bernhisel to be his bail. Touched by this appeal  the doctor said he would go, and Higbee left him while he dressed,  saying he would call for him in a few minutes.    After the departure of Higbee, Elder Taylor expressed his fear that  this was but a ruse to separate them. They had important documents to  submit to the Governor, and it was his opinion that the object was to  separate them and get possession of those papers, and perhaps murder  one or both of them. The doctor admitted the probability of this and  informed Higbee that Elder Taylor and himself would wait upon the  justice in the morning. That night Elder Taylor laid awake with his  pistols under his pillow, ready for any emergency.    The light of morning came at last, and with the darkness fled their  apprehensions. They waited upon the justice who held Daniel Garn in  custody, and offered to be his bail. The justice answered that he  doubted if property in Nauvoo would be worth anything in a few days,  and therefore refused to accept them as bondsmen. They both had  property outside of Nauvoo which they offered as security. The justice  then told them that such was the nature of the accusation against Mr.  Garn, that he would not feel justified in admitting him to bail. This  confirmed Elder Taylor's suspicion that the request for them to be his  bail the night before was only a ruse to separate them.    That morning they had an interview with the Governor. \"And such an  interview!\" exclaimed Elder Taylor. He was surrounded by the very  vilest of apostate Mormons and desperadoes, bent on the destruction of  the Saints. As he opened and read aloud some of the documents submitted  to him, he was frequently interrupted with such expressions as, \"that's  a lie!\" \"that's a G--d d----d lie!\" \"that's an infernal falsehood!\" etc.    After the whole case was stated to the Governor, and all the documents  submitted, he insisted that in order to prove to the people that they  were willing to submit to the law, it would be best for Joseph Smith  and all concerned in the destruction of the _Expositor_ press to come  to Carthage for examination. Elder Taylor represented that they had  already been examined before two competent courts on that charge, the  municipal court of Nauvoo "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4532"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Photo Telephone or the Picture That Saved a Fortune (#20)"],[1,"s--one  for a temporary, or looking-glass, picture, and the other for a  permanent one. In that way I could rush off as soon as I got a  glimpse of the fellow. But it's too late to do that now. I'll have  to develop this plate.\"    Waiting is the most wearisome work there is. Tom and Ned found  this to be the case, as they sat there, hoping each moment that  the telephone bell would ring, and that the man at the other end  of the wire would be the mysterious stranger. Mrs. Damon, too,  felt the nervous strain.    \"This is about the hour he called up yesterday,\" said Tom, in a  low voice, after coming back from a trip to the window to see that  his airship was in readiness. He had brought Koku over to help in  starting it, for he was using his most powerful and speedy craft,  and the propellers were hard to turn.    \"Yes,\" answered Mrs. Damon. \"It was just about this hour, Tom. Oh,  I do hope--\"    She was interrupted by the jingle of the telephone bell. With a  jump Tom was at the auxiliary instrument, while Mrs. Damon lifted  off the receiver of her own telephone.    \"Yes; what is it?\" she asked, in a voice that she tried to make  calm.    \"Do you know who this is?\" Tom heard come over the wire.    \"Are you the--er--the person who was to give me an address where I  am to send certain papers?\"    \"Yes. I'm the same one. I'm glad to see that you have acted  sensibly. If I get the papers all right, you'll soon have your  husband back. Now do as I say. Take down this address.\"    \"Very well,\" assented Mrs. Damon. She looked over at Tom. He was  intently listening, and he, too, would note the address given. The  trap was about to be sprung. The game had walked into it. Just  which telephone was being used Tom could not as yet tell. It was  evidently not the one nearest the planing mill, for Tom could not  hear the buzzing sound. It was well he had put his attachment on  several instruments.    \"One moment, please,\" said Mrs. Damon, to the unknown at the other  end of the wire. This was in accordance with the pre-arranged  plan.    \"Well, what is it?\" asked the man, impatiently. \"I have no time to  waste.\"    Tom heard again the same gruff tones, and he tried in vain to  recognize them.    \"I want you take down a message to Mr. Damon,\" said his wife.  \"This is very important. It can do you no harm to give him this  message; but I want you to get it exact. If you do not promise to  deliver it I shall call all negotiations off.\"    \"Oh, all right I'll take the message; but be quick about it. Then  I'll give you the address where you are to send the papers.\"    \"This is the message,\" went on Mrs. Damon. \"Please write it down.  It is very important to me. Have you a pencil?\"    \"Yes, I have one. Wait until I get a bit of paper. It's so dark in  this booth--wait until I turn on the light.\"    Tom could not repress a pleased and joyful exclamation. It was  just what he had hoped the man would do--turn on the light in the  booth. Indeed, it was necessary for the success of the trap that  the light be switched on. Otherwise no picture could be  transmitted over the wire. And the plan of having the man write  down a message to Mr. Damon was arranged with that end in view.  The man would need a light to see to write, and Tom's apparatus  must be lighted in order to make it work. The plot was coming  along finely.    \"There!\" exclaimed the man at the other end of the wire. \"I have a  light now. Go ahead with your message, Mrs. Damon. But make it  short. I can't stay here long.\"    Then Mrs. Damon began dictating the message she and Tom had agreed  upon. It was as long as they dared make it, for they wanted to  keep the man in the booth to the last second.    \"Dear Husband,\" began Mrs. Damon. What the message was does not  matter. It has nothing to do with this story. Sufficient to say  that the moment the man began writing it down, as Tom could tell  over the sensitive wire, by the scratching of the pencil--at that  moment Tom, knowing the light was on in the distant telephone  booth, switched on the picture-taking apparatus. His receiving  apparatus at once indicated that the image was being made on the  sensitive plate.    It took only a few seconds of time, and with the plate in the  holder Tom hastened to the dark room to develop it. Ned took his  chum's place at the telephone, to see that all worked smoothly.  The photo telephone had done it's work. Whose image would be found  imprinted on the sensitive plate? Tom's hands trembled so that he  could scarcely put it in the developing solution.            CHAPTER XXII    THE ESCAPE      Ned Newton, listening at the auxiliary telephone heard the man, to  whom Mrs. Damon was dictating her message to her husband, utter an  exclamation of impatience.    \"I'm afraid I can't take down any more,\" he called. \"That is  enough. Now you listen. I want you to send me those papers.\"    \"And I am willing to,\" went on Mrs. Damon, while Ned listened to  the talk, the phonograph faithfully recording it.    \"I wonder whose picture Tom will find,\" mused Ned.    The unknown, at the other end of the wire, began giving Mrs. Damon  a description of just what papers he wanted, and how to mail them  to him. He gave an address that Ned recognized as that of a cigar  store, where many persons received their mail under assumed names.  The postal authorities had, for a long time, tried to get evidence  against it.    \"That's going to make it hard to get him, when he comes for the  papers,\" thought Ned. \"He's a foxy criminal, all right. But I  guess Tom will turn the trick.\"    Mrs. Damon was carefully noting down the address. She really  intended to send the papers, if it proved that there was no other  way in which she could secure the release of her husband. But she  did not count on all of Tom's plans. \"Why doesn't he develop that  plate?\" thought Ned. \"He'll be too late, in spite of his airship.  That fellow will skip.\"    It was at that moment that Tom came into the library. He moved  cautiously, for he realized that a loud sound in the room would  carry to the man at the other end of the wire. Tom motioned for  Ned to come to him. He held out a dripping photographic plate.    \"It's Peters!\" said Tom, in a hoarse whisper.    \"Peters?\" gasped Ned. \"How could it be? His voice--\"    \"I know. It didn't sound a bit like Peters over the 'phone, but  there's his picture, all right!\"    Tom held up the plate. There, imprinted on it by the wonderful  power of the young inventor's latest appliance, was the image of  the rascally promoter. As plainly as in life he was shown, even to  his silk hat and the flower in his button-hole. He was in a  telephone booth--that much could be told from the photograph that  had been transmitted over the wire, but which booth could not be  said--they were nearly all alike.    \"Peters!\" gasped Ned. \"I thought he was the fellow, Tom.\"    \"Yes, I know. You were right, and I was wrong. But I did not  recognize his voice. It was very hoarse. He must have a bad cold.\"  Later this was learned to have been the case. \"There's no time to  lose,\" whispered Tom, while Mrs. Damon was doing her best to  prolong the conversation in order to hold the man at the other end  of the wire. \"Ned, get central on the other telephone, and see  where this call came from. Then we'll get there as fast as the  airship will take us.\"    A second and temporary telephone line had been installed in the  Damon home, and on this Ned was soon talking, while Tom, putting  the photographic plate away for future use, rushed out to get his  airship in shape for a quick flight. He had modified his plans.  Instead of having a detective take a print of the photo telephone  image, and make the arrest, Tom was going to try to capture Peters  himself. He believed he could do it. One look at the wet plate was  enough. He knew Peters, though it upset some of his theories to  learn that it was the promoter who was responsible for Mr. Damon's  disappearance.    The man at the other end of the wire was evidently getting  impatient. Possibly he suspected some trick. \"I've got to go now,\"  he called to Mrs. Damon. \"If I don't get those papers in the  morning it will be the worse for Mr. Damon.\"    \"Oh, I'll send you the papers,\" she said.    By this time Ned had gotten into communication with the manager of  the central telephone exchange, and had learned the location of  the instrument Peters was using. It was about a mile from the one  near the sawmill.    \"Come on!\" called Tom to his chum, as the latter gave him this  information. \"The Firefly is tuned up for a hundred miles an hour!  We'll be there in ten minutes! We must catch him red-handed, if  possible!\"    \"He's gone!\" gasped Mrs. Damon as she came to the outer door, and  watched Tom and Ned taking their places in the airship, while Koku  prepared to twirl the propellers.    \"Gone!\" echoed Tom, blankly.    \"Yes, he hung up the receiver.\"    \"See if you can't get him back,\" suggested the young inventor.  \"Ask Central to ring that number again. We'll be there in a jiffy.  Maybe he'll come to the telephone again. Or he may even call up  his partners and tell them the game is working his way. Try to get  him back, Mrs. Damon.\"    \"I will,\" she said.    And, as she hurried back to the instrument, Tom and Ned shot up  toward the blue sky in an endeavor to capture the man at the other  telephone.    \"And to think it was Peters!\" cried Tom into Ned's ear, shouting  to be heard above the roar of the motor exhaust.    \"I thought he'd turn out to be mixed up in the affair,\" said Ned.    \"Well, you were right. I was off, that time,\" admitted Tom, as he  guided his powerful craft above the trees. \"I was willing to admit  that he had something to do with Mr. Damon's financial trouble,  but as for kidnapping him--well, you never can tell.\"    They drove on at a breath-catching pace, and it seemed hardly a  minute after leaving Mrs. Damon's house before Tom called:    \"There's the "]]]
