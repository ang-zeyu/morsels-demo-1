As a proof of how cruel it is to take _all_ a cat's kittens away from  her, I may state that, thus bereaved, a cat will take to nursing even  chickens, or she will suckle puppies, hedgehogs, or rats.    It is a funny thing that many cats can't bear music.  Some will run out  of the room if they hear a fiddle played, and others will growl and  attack the musician.    Cats can be easily taught to follow one in a country walk just like a  dog, and on these occasions they come much better to the sound of  whistling than to any other call.    A well-bred cat will always teach its kittens habits of cleanliness, how  to watch for and catch mice, and also how to catch minnows in a shallow  stream.    I have already said that cats, as a rule, when well treated, are not  thieves, but the very reverse.  But when a cat does take to thieving for  a livelihood, she becomes quite a swell at it--shows how clever she is.    Cats are considered in some parts of England to be of some value as an  article of diet.  I have never to my knowledge eaten cat, so I cannot  give the reader any idea what they taste like.    It is ridiculous to suppose, as some do, that a cat's breath has any  effect upon a baby either for good or for evil.  Neither will a cat  bring blood from a child's temple by licking it with its rough tongue.    An ugly old woman isn't necessarily a witch because she keeps a black  cat.  Neither is a black cat a devil.    They say that witches sail over the sea in riddles accompanied by their  black cats, and that they have rather a jolly time of it upon the whole,  having plenty to eat, and plenty to drink--flagons of wine, in fact.  Don't you believe it, reader.    Cats are not afraid of snakes; but snakes, even the dreaded cobra, will  invariably give pussy a wide berth.    Cats are fond of fish, absurdly so, and if you offer them even the  gold-fish, they won't feel offended.  It is only out of respect for the  owner thereof that they don't devour the canary.  They prefer canary  living, with the feathers on.  It tickles their palates and makes them  laugh.    Chickens are dainties in a cat's _cuisine_; they also rather like a nice  plump partridge, and won't refuse to suck an egg when occasion offers.    Cats are, as a rule, Good Templars; the proof of which rule is this: I  had a Red Tabby Tom who would eat oatmeal and whisky until he couldn't  stand.  The servants knew this failing, and encouraged him in his evil  ways; so that half his time, instead of being as sober as a judge--as  every decent, respectable cat ought--Tom was as drunk as a piper.    It is funny to listen to a cat's concert about two o'clock in the  morning.  Of course, if you are rather nervous, and want to go to sleep,  it isn't so funny.  (N.B.--If cats were better treated, they would hold  their concerts in daylight in the garden, instead of at midnight on the  tiles.  Mind you, there is something in that.)    Altogether, cats are funny things, and the more you study them the  funnier you find them.  That's so!    CHAPTER TWENTY ONE.    THE FIRESIDE FAVOURITE.    The lines of some cats fall in pleasant places.  Mine have.  I'm the  fireside favourite, I'm the parlour pet.  I'm the _beau ideal_, so my  mistress says, of what every decent, respectable, well-trained cat ought  to be--and I looked in the glass and found it so.  But pray don't think  that I am vain because I happen to know the usages of polite society,  and the uses and abuses of the looking-glass.  No cat, in my opinion,  with any claim to the dignity of lady-puss, would think of washing her  face unless in front of a plate-glass mirror.  But I will not soon  forget the day I first knew what a looking-glass meant.  I was then only  a cheeky little mite of a kitten, of a highly inquiring turn of mind.  Well, one evening my young mistress was going to a ball, and before she  went she spent about three hours in her dressing-room, doing something,  and then she came down to the parlour, looking more like an angel than  ever I had seen her.  Oh, how she was dressed, to be sure!  And she had  little bunches of flowers stuck on all over her dress, and I wanted to  play at \"mousies\" with them; but she wouldn't wait, she just kissed me  and bade me be a good kitten and not run up the curtains, and then off  she went.  Yes; I meant to be an awfully good little kitten--but first  and foremost I meant to see the interior of that mysterious room.  By  good luck the door was ajar, so in I popped at once, and made direct for  the table.  Such a display of beautiful things I had never seen before.  I didn't know what they all meant then, but I do now, for, mind you, I  will soon be twenty years of age.  But I got great fun on that table.  I  tried the gold rings on my nose, and the earrings on my toes, and I  knocked off the lid of a powder-box, and scattered the crimson contents  all abroad.  Then I had a fearful battle with a puff which I unearthed  from another box.  During the fight a bottle of ylang-ylang went down.  I didn't care a dump.  Crash went a bottle of fragrant floriline next.  I regarded it not.  I fought the puff till it took refuge on the floor.  Then I paused, wondering what I should do next, when behold! right in  front of me and looking through a square of glass, and apparently  wondering what _it_ should do next, was the ugliest little wretch of a  kitten ever you saw in your life--a long-nosed, blear-eyed,  pingey-wingey thing.  I marched up to it as brave as a button, and it  had the audacity to come and meet me.    \"You ugly, deformed little beast,\" I cried, \"what do you want in my  lady's room?\"    \"The same to you,\" it seemed to say, \"and many of them.\"    \"For two pins,\" I continued, \"I would scratch your nasty little eyes  out--yah--fuss-s!\"    \"Yah--fuss-s!\" replied the foe, lifting its left paw as I lifted my  right.    This was too much.  I crept round the corner to give her a cuff.  She  wasn't there!  I came back, and there she was as brazen as ever.  I  tried this game on several times, but couldn't catch her.  \"Then,\" says  I, \"you'll have it where you stand, and hang the pane of glass!\"    I struck straight from the shoulder, and with a will too.  Down went the  glass, and I found I had been fighting all the time with my own shadow.  Funny, wasn't it?    When mistress came home there was such a row.  But she was sensible, and  didn't beat me.  She took me upstairs, and showed me what I had done,  and looked so vexed that I was sorry too.  \"It is my own fault, though,\"  she said; \"I ought to have shut the door.\"    She presented me with a looking-glass soon after this, and it is quite  surprising how my opinion of that strange kitten in the mirror altered  after that.  I thought now I had never seen such a lovely thing, and I  was never tired looking at it.  No more I had.  But first impressions  _are_ so erroneous, you know.    My dear mother is dead and gone years ago--of course, considering my  age, you won't marvel at that; and my young mistress is married long,  long ago, and has a grown family, who are all as kind as kind can be to  old Tom, as they facetiously call me.  And so they were to my mother,  who, I may tell you, was only three days in her last illness, and gave  up the ghost on a file of old newspapers (than which nothing makes a  better bed) and is buried under the old pear-tree.    Dear me, how often I have wondered how other poor cats who have neither  kind master nor mistress manage to live.  But, the poor creatures, they  are _so_ ignorant--badly-bred, you know.  Why, only the other day the  young master brought home a poor little cat, he had found starving in  the street.  Well, I never in all my life saw such an ill-mannered, rude  little wretch, for no sooner had it got itself stuffed with the best  fare in the house, than it made a deliberate attempt to steal the  canary.  There was gratitude for you!  Now, mind, I don't say that _I_  shouldn't like to eat the canary, but I never have taken our own birds--  no--always the neighbours'.  I did, just once, fly at our own canary's  cage when I was quite a wee cat, and didn't know any better.  And what  do you think my mistress did?  Why, she took the bird out of the cage  and popped me in; and there I was, all day long, a prisoner, with  nothing for dinner but seeds and water, and the canary flying about the  room and doing what it liked, even helping itself to my milk.  I never  forgot that.    Some cats, you know, are arrant thieves, and I don't wonder at it, the  way they are kicked and cuffed about, put out all night, and never  offered food or water.  I would steal myself if I were used like that,  wouldn't you, madam?  But I have my two meals a day, regularly; and I  have a nice double saucer, which stands beside my mirror, and one end  contains nice milk and the other clean water, and I don't know which I  like the best.  When I am downright thirsty, the water is so nice; but  at times I am hungry and thirsty both, if you can understand me--then I  drink the milk.  At times I am allowed to sit on the table when my  mistress is at breakfast, and I often put out my paw, ever so gently,  and help myself to a morsel from her plate; but I wouldn't do it when  she isn't looking.  The other day I took a fancy to a nice smelt, and I  just went and told my mistress and led her to the kitchen, and I got  what I wanted at once.    I am never put out at night.  I have always the softest and warmest of  beds, and in winter, towards morning, when the fire goes out, I go  upstairs and creep (singing loudly to let her know it is I) into my  mistress's arms.    If I want to go on the tiles any night, I have only to ask.  A fellow  does want to go on the tiles now and then, doesn't he?  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3751"],[0,"The Psychology of Beauty (#20)"],[1,"down  the third dimension, the vista introduces an element of action  of counterbalancing character.  In the landscape it introduces  the principal element of variety.  It is always to be found in  those parts of the picture which are opposed to other powerful  elements, and the \"heavier\" the other side, the deeper the vista.  Also in pictures with two groups it serves as a kind of fulcrum,  or unifying element, inasmuch as it rivets the attention between  the two detached sides.    The direction of suggestion by means of the indication of a line,  quite naturally is more frequent in the Madonna picture and  portrait classes.  Both these types are of large simple outline,  so that line would be expected to tell.  In a decided majority  of cases, combined with vista--the shape being more or less a  diagonal slope--it is clear that it acts as a kind of bond  between the two sides, carrying the attention without a break  from one to the other.    The element of mass requires less comment.  It appears in  greatest number in those pictures which have little action, i.e. portraits and landscapes, and which are not yet symmetrical,--  in which last case mass is, of course, already balanced.  In  fact, it must of necessity exert a certain influence in every  unsymmetrical picture, and so its percentage, even for genre  pictures, is large.    Thus we may regard the elements as both attracting attention to  a certain spot and dispersing it over a field.  Those types  which are of a static character (landscapes, altar-pieces)  abound in elements which disperse the attention; those which  are of a dynamic character (genre picture), in those which make  it stable.  The ideal composition seems to combine the dynamic  and static elements,--to animate, in short, the whole field of  view, but in a generally bilateral fashion.  The elements, in  substitutional symmetry, are then simply means of introducing  variety and action.  As a dance in which there are complicated  steps gives the actor and beholder a varied and thus vivified  \"balance,\" and is thus more beautiful than the simple walk, so  a picture composed in substitutional symmetry is more rich in  its suggestions of motor impulse, and thus more beautiful, than  an example of geometrical symmetry.      III    The particular functions of the elements which are substituted  for geometrical symmetry have been made clear; their presence  lends variety and richness to the balance of motor impulses.  But this quality of repose, or unity, given by balance, is also  enriched by a unity for intuition,--a large outline in which all  the elements are held together.  Now this way of holding together  varies; and I believe that it bears a very close relation to the  subject and purpose of the picture.    Examples of these types of composition may best be found by  analyzing a few well-known pictures.  We may begin with the class  first studied, the Altar-piece, choosing a picture by Botticelli,  in the Florence Academy.  Under an arch is draped a canopy held  up by angels; under this, again, sits the Madonna with the Child  on her lap, on a throne, at the foot of which, on each side,  stand three saints.  The outline of the whole is markedly  pyramidal; in fact, there are, broadly speaking, three pyramids,  --of the arch, the canopy, and the grouping.  A second, much  less symmetrical example of this type, is given by another  Botticelli in the Academy,--\"Spring.\"  Here the central female  figure, topped by the floating Cupid, is slightly raised above  the others, which, however, bend slightly inward, so that a  triangle, or pyramid with very obtuse angle at the apex, is  suggested; and the whole, which at first glance seems a little  scattered, is at once felt, when this is grasped, as closely  bound together.    Closely allied to this is the type of the Holbein \"Madonna of  Burgomaster Meyer,\" in the Grand Ducal Castle, Darmstadt.  It  is true that the same pyramid is given by the head of the  Madonna against the shell-like background, and her spreading  cloak which envelops the kneeling donors.  But still more  salient is the diamond form given by the descending rows of  these worshiping figures, especially against the dark background  of the Madonna's dress.  A second example, without the pyramid  backing, is found in Rubens's \"Rape of the Daughters of  Leucippus,\" in the Alte Pinakothek at Munich.  Here the diamond  shape formed by the horses and struggling figures is most  remarkable,--an effect of lightness which will be discussed  later in interpreting the types.    A third type, the diagonal, is given in an \"Evening Landscape\"  by Cuyp, in the Buckingham Palace, London.  High trees and  cliffs, horsemen and others, occupy one side, and the mountains  in the background, the ground and the clouds, all slope  gradually down to the other side.    It is a natural transition from this type to the V-shape of the  landscapes by Aart van der Neer, \"Dutch Villages,\" in the London  National Gallery and in the Rudolphinum at Prague, respectively.  Here are trees and houses on each side, gradually sloping to  the centre to show an open sky and deep vista.  Other examples,  of course, show the opening not exactly in the centre.    In the \"Concert\" by Giorgione, in the Pitti Gallery, Florence,  is seen the less frequent type of the square.  The three  figures turned toward each other with heads on the same level  make almost a square space-shape, although it might be said  that the central player gives a pyramidal foundation.  This  last may also be said of Verrocchio's \"Tobias and the  Archangels\" in the Florence Academy, for the square, or other  rectangle, is again lengthened by the pyramidal shape of the  two central figures.  The unrelieved square, it may here be  interpolated, is not often found except in somewhat primitive  examples.  Still less often observed is the oval type of  \"Samson's Wedding Feast,\" Rembrandt, in the Royal Gallery,  Dresden.  Here one might, by pressing the interpretation, see  an obtuse-angled double-pyramid with the figure of Delilah for  an apex, but a few very irregular pictures seem to fall best  under the given classification.    Last of all, it must be remarked that the great majority of  pictures show a combination of two or even three types; but  these are usually subordinated to one dominant type.  Such,  for instance, is the case with many portraits, which are  markedly pyramidal, with the double-pyramid suggested by the  position of the arms, and the inverted pyramid, or V, in the  landscape background.  The diagonal sometimes just passes over  into the V-shape, or into the pyramid; or the square is  combined with both.    What types are characteristic of the different kinds of pictures?  In order to answer this question we must ask first, What are the  different kinds of pictures?  One answer, at least, is at once  suggested to the student on a comparison of the pictures with  their groupings according to subjects.  All those which represent  the Madonna enthroned, with all variations, with or without  saints, shepherds, or Holy Family, are very quiet in their action;  that is, it is not really an action at all which they represent,  but an attitude,--the attitude of contemplation.  This is no  less true of the pictures we may call \"Adorations,\" in which,  indeed, the contemplative attitude is still more marked.  On the  other hand, such pictures as the \"Descents,\" the \"Annunciations,\"  and very many of the miscellaneous religious, allegorical, and  genre pictures, portray a definite action or event.  Now the  pyramid type is characteristic of the \"contemplative\" pictures  in a much higher degree.  A class which might be supposed to  suggest the same treatment in composition is that of the portraits,  --absolute lack of action being the rule.  And we find, indeed,  that no single type is represented within it except the pyramid  and double-pyramid, with eighty-six per cent. of the former.  Thus it is evident that for the type of picture which expresses  the highest degree of quietude, contemplation, concentration,  the pyramid is the characteristic type of composition.  Among  the so-called \"active\" pictures, the diagonal and V-shaped types  are most numerous.    The landscape picture presents a somewhat different problem.  It  cannot be described as either \"active\" or \"passive,\" inasmuch as  it does not express either an attitude or an event.  There is no  definite idea to be set forth, no point of concentration, as  with the altar-pieces and the portraits, for instance; and yet  a unity is demanded.  An examination of the proportions of the  types shows at once the characteristic type to be here also the  diagonal and V-shaped.    It is now necessary to ask what must be the interpretation of  the use of these types of composition.  Must we consider the  pyramid the expression of passivity, the diagonal or V-shape, of  activity?  But the greatly predominating use of the second for  landscapes would remain unexplained, for at least nothing can  be more reposeful than the latter.  It may aid the solution of  the problem to remember that the composition taken as a whole  has to meet the demand for unity, at the same time that it  allows free play to the natural expression of the subject.  The  altar-piece has to bring about a concentration of attention to  express or induce a feeling of reverence.  This is evidently  accomplished by the suggestion of the converging lines to the  fixation of the high point in the picture,--the small area  occupied by the Madonna and Child,--and by the subordination  of the free play of other elements.  The contrast between the  broad base and the apex gives a feeling of solidity, of repose;  and it seems not unreasonable to suppose that the tendency to  rest the eyes above the centre of the picture directly induces  the associated mood of reverence or worship.  Thus the  pyramidal form serves two ends;"]]]
