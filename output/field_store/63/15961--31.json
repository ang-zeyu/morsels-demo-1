[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6886"],[0,"First Footsteps in East Africa (#20)"],[1,"art, to sit with us on the cowhide in  this cold under a tree?\" Of course they were beggars, princes and paupers,  lairds and loons, being all equally unfortunate; the Arabs have named the  country Bilad Wa Issi,--the \"Land of Give me Something;\"--but their wants  were easily satisfied, and the open hand always made a friend.    The Somal hold mainly to the Shafei school of El Islam: their principal  peculiarity is that of not reciting prayers over the dead even in the  towns. The marriage ceremony is simple: the price of the bride and the  feast being duly arranged, the formula is recited by some priest or  pilgrim. I have often been requested to officiate on these occasions, and  the End of Time has done it by irreverently reciting the Fatihah over the  happy pair. [18] The Somal, as usual amongst the heterogeneous mass  amalgamated by El Islam, have a diversity of superstitions attesting their  Pagan origin. Such for instance are their oaths by stones, their reverence  of cairns and holy trees, and their ordeals of fire and water, the Bolungo  of Western Africa. A man accused of murder or theft walks down a trench  full of live charcoal and about a spear's length, or he draws out of the  flames a smith's anvil heated to redness: some prefer picking four or five  cowries from a large pot full of boiling water. The member used is at once  rolled up in the intestines of a sheep and not inspected for a whole day.  They have traditionary seers called Tawuli, like the Greegree-men of  Western Africa, who, by inspecting the fat and bones of slaughtered  cattle, \"do medicine,\" predict rains, battles, and diseases of animals.  This class is of both sexes: they never pray or bathe, and are therefore  considered always impure; thus, being feared, they are greatly respected  by the vulgar. Their predictions are delivered in a rude rhyme, often put  for importance into the mouth of some deceased seer. During the three  months called Rajalo [19] the Koran is not read over graves, and no  marriage ever takes place. The reason of this peculiarity is stated to be  imitation of their ancestor Ishak, who happened not to contract a  matrimonial alliance at such epoch: it is, however, a manifest remnant of  the Pagan's auspicious and inauspicious months. Thus they sacrifice she-  camels in the month Sabuh, and keep holy with feasts and bonfires the  Dubshid or New Year's Day. [20] At certain unlucky periods when the moon  is in ill-omened Asterisms those who die are placed in bundles of matting  upon a tree, the idea being that if buried a loss would result to the  tribe. [21]    Though superstitious, the Somal are not bigoted like the Arabs, with the  exception of those who, wishing to become learned, visit Yemen or El  Hejaz, and catch the complaint. Nominal Mohammedans, El Islam hangs so  lightly upon them, that apparently they care little for making it binding  upon others.    The Somali language is no longer unknown to Europe. It is strange that a  dialect which has no written character should so abound in poetry and  eloquence. There are thousands of songs, some local, others general, upon  all conceivable subjects, such as camel loading, drawing water, and  elephant hunting; every man of education knows a variety of them. The  rhyme is imperfect, being generally formed by the syllable \"ay\"  (pronounced as in our word \"hay\"), which gives the verse a monotonous  regularity; but, assisted by a tolerably regular alliteration and cadence,  it can never be mistaken for prose, even without the song which invariably  accompanies it. The country teems with \"poets, poetasters, poetitos, and  poetaccios:\" every man has his recognised position in literature as  accurately defined as though he had been reviewed in a century of  magazines,--the fine ear of this people [22] causing them to take the  greatest pleasure in harmonious sounds and poetical expressions, whereas a  false quantity or a prosaic phrase excite their violent indignation. Many  of these compositions are so idiomatic that Arabs settled for years  amongst the Somal cannot understand them, though perfectly acquainted with  the conversational style. Every chief in the country must have a panegyric  to be sung by his clan, and the great patronise light literature by  keeping a poet. The amatory is of course the favourite theme: sometimes it  appears in dialogue, the rudest form, we are told, of the Drama. The  subjects are frequently pastoral: the lover for instance invites his  mistress to walk with him towards the well in Lahelo, the Arcadia of the  land; he compares her legs to the tall straight Libi tree, and imprecates  the direst curses on her head if she refuse to drink with him the milk of  his favourite camel. There are a few celebrated ethical compositions, in  which the father lavishes upon his son all the treasures of Somali good  advice, long as the somniferous sermons of Mentor to the insipid son of  Ulysses. Sometimes a black Tyrtaeus breaks into a wild lament for the loss  of warriors or territory; he taunts the clan with cowardice, reminds them  of their slain kindred, better men than themselves, whose spirits cannot  rest unavenged in their gory graves, and urges a furious onslaught upon  the exulting victor.    And now, dear L., I will attempt to gratify your just curiosity concerning  _the_ sex in Eastern Africa.    The Somali matron is distinguished--externally--from the maiden by a  fillet of blue network or indigo-dyed cotton, which, covering the head and  containing the hair, hangs down to the neck. Virgins wear their locks  long, parted in the middle, and plaited in a multitude of hard thin  pigtails: on certain festivals they twine flowers and plaster the head  like Kafir women with a red ochre,--the _coiffure_ has the merit of  originality. With massive rounded features, large flat craniums, long big  eyes, broad brows, heavy chins, rich brown complexions, and round faces,  they greatly resemble the stony beauties of Egypt--the models of the land  ere Persia, Greece, and Rome reformed the profile and bleached the skin.  They are of the Venus Kallipyga order of beauty: the feature is scarcely  ever seen amongst young girls, but after the first child it becomes  remarkable to a stranger. The Arabs have not failed to make it a matter of  jibe.      \"'Tis a wonderful fact that your hips swell    Like boiled rice or a skin blown out,\"    sings a satirical Yemeni: the Somal retort by comparing the lank haunches  of their neighbours to those of tadpoles or young frogs. One of their  peculiar charms is a soft, low, and plaintive voice, derived from their  African progenitors. Always an excellent thing in woman, here it has an  undefinable charm. I have often lain awake for hours listening to the  conversation of the Bedouin girls, whose accents sounded in my ears rather  like music than mere utterance.    In muscular strength and endurance the women of the Somal are far superior  to their lords: at home they are engaged all day in domestic affairs, and  tending the cattle; on journeys their manifold duties are to load and  drive the camels, to look after the ropes, and, if necessary, to make  them; to pitch the hut, to bring water and firewood, and to cook. Both  sexes are equally temperate from necessity; the mead and the millet-beer,  so common among the Abyssinians and the Danakil, are entirely unknown to  the Somal of the plains. As regards their morals, I regret to say that the  traveller does not find them in the golden state which Teetotal doctrines  lead him to expect. After much wandering, we are almost tempted to believe  the bad doctrine that morality is a matter of geography; that nations and  races have, like individuals, a pet vice, and that by restraining one you  only exasperate another. As a general rule Somali women prefer  _amourettes_ with strangers, following the well-known Arab proverb, \"The  new comer filleth the eye.\" In cases of scandal, the woman's tribe  revenges its honour upon the man. Should a wife disappear with a fellow-  clansman, and her husband accord divorce, no penal measures are taken, but  she suffers in reputation, and her female friends do not spare her.  Generally, the Somali women are of cold temperament, the result of  artificial as well as natural causes: like the Kafirs, they are very  prolific, but peculiarly bad mothers, neither loved nor respected by their  children. The fair sex lasts longer in Eastern Africa than in India and  Arabia: at thirty, however, charms are on the wane, and when old age comes  on they are no exceptions to the hideous decrepitude of the East.    The Somal, when they can afford it, marry between the ages of fifteen and  twenty. Connections between tribes are common, and entitle the stranger to  immunity from the blood-feud: men of family refuse, however, to ally  themselves with the servile castes. Contrary to the Arab custom, none of  these people will marry cousins; at the same time a man will give his  daughter to his uncle, and take to wife, like the Jews and Gallas, a  brother's relict. Some clans, the Habr Yunis for instance, refuse maidens  of the same or even of a consanguineous family. This is probably a  political device to preserve nationality and provide against a common  enemy. The bride, as usual in the East, is rarely consulted, but frequent  _tete a tetes_ at the well and in the bush when tending cattle effectually  obviate this inconvenience: her relatives settle the marriage portion,  which varies from a cloth and a bead necklace to fifty sheep or thirty  dollars, and dowries are unknown. In the towns marriage ceremonies are  celebrated with feasting and music. On first entering the nuptial hut, the  bridegroom draws forth his horsewhip and inflicts memorable chastisement  upon the fair person of his bride, with the view of taming any lurking  propensity to shrewishness. [23] This is carrying out with a will the Arab  proverb,      \"The slave girl from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/689"],[0,"The Kreutzer Sonata and Other Stories (#20)"],[1,"IT,\" by Pauline Grayson,  which is an exceedingly interesting narrative showing one of the results  of the ideas set forth in \"Kreutzer Sonata.\" It is bound in paper  covers and will be sent by mail, postage paid, upon receipt of 25 cents.  Address all orders to J. S. OGILVIE PUBLISHING COMPANY, 57 Rose Street,  New York.          LESSON OF \"THE KREUTZER SONATA.\"    I have received, and still continue to receive, numbers of letters from  persons who are perfect strangers to me, asking me to state in plain  and simple language my own views on the subject handled in the story  entitled \"The Kreutzer Sonata.\" With this request I shall now endeavor  to comply.    My views on the question may be succinctly stated as follows: Without  entering into details, it will be generally admitted that I am accurate  in saying that many people condone in young men a course of conduct with  regard to the other sex which is incompatible with strict morality,  and that this dissoluteness is pardoned generally. Both parents and  the government, in consequence of this view, may be said to wink at  profligacy, and even in the last resource to encourage its practice. I  am of opinion that this is not right.    It is not possible that the health of one class should necessitate the  ruin of another, and, in consequence, it is our first duty to turn a  deaf ear to such an essential immoral doctrine, no matter how strongly  society may have established or law protected it. Moreover, it needs to  be fully recognized that men are rightly to be held responsible for  the consequences of their own acts, and that these are no longer to be  visited on the woman alone. It follows from this that it is the duty of  men who do not wish to lead a life of infamy to practice such continence  in respect to all woman as they would were the female society in which  they move made up exclusively of their own mothers and sisters.    A more rational mode of life should be adopted which would include  abstinence from all alcoholic drinks, from excess in eating and from  flesh meat, on the one hand, and recourse to physical labor on the  other. I am not speaking of gymnastics, or of any of those occupations  which may be fitly described as playing at work; I mean the genuine toil  that fatigues. No one need go far in search of proofs that this kind of  abstemious living is not merely possible, but far less hurtful to health  than excess. Hundreds of instances are known to every one. This is my  first contention.    In the second place, I think that of late years, through various reasons  which I need not enter, but among which the above-mentioned laxity  of opinion in society and the frequent idealization of the subject in  current literature and painting may be mentioned, conjugal infidelity  has become more common and is considered less reprehensible. I am of  opinion that this is not right. The origin of the evil is twofold. It is  due, in the first place, to a natural instinct, and, in the second, to  the elevation of this instinct to a place to which it does not rightly  belong. This being so, the evil can only be remedied by effecting a  change in the views now in vogue about \"falling in love\" and all that  this term implies, by educating men and women at home through family  influence and example, and abroad by means of healthy public opinion, to  practice that abstinence which morality and Christianity alike enjoin.  This is my second contention.    In the third place I am of opinion that another consequence of the false  light in which \"falling in love,\" and what it leads to, are viewed  in our society, is that the birth of children has lost its pristine  significance, and that modern marriages are conceived less and less from  the point of view of the family. I am of opinion that this is not right.  This is my third contention.    In the fourth place, I am of opinion that the children (who in our  society are considered an obstacle to enjoyment--an unlucky accident, as  it were) are educated not with a view to the problem which they will be  one day called on to face and to solve, but solely with an eye to  the pleasure which they may be made to yield to their parents. The  consequence is, that the children of human beings are brought up for  all the world like the young of animals, the chief care of their parents  being not to train them to such work as is worthy of men and women, but  to increase their weight, or add a cubit to their stature, to make them  spruce, sleek, well-fed, and comely. They rig them out in all manner of  fantastic costumes, wash them, over-feed them, and refuse to make them  work. If the children of the lower orders differ in this last respect  from those of the well-to-do classes, the difference is merely formal;  they work from sheer necessity, and not because their parents recognize  work as a duty. And in over-fed children, as in over-fed animals,  sensuality is engendered unnaturally early.    Fashionable dress to-day, the course of reading, plays, music, dances,  luscious food, all the elements of our modern life, in a word, from the  pictures on the little boxes of sweetmeats up to the novel, the tale,  and the poem, contribute to fan this sensuality into a strong, consuming  flame, with the result that sexual vices and diseases have come to be  the normal conditions of the period of tender youth, and often continue  into the riper age of full-blown manhood. And I am of opinion that this  is not right.    It is high time it ceased. The children of human beings should not be  brought up as if they were animals; and we should set up as the object  and strive to maintain as the result of our labors something better and  nobler than a well-dressed body. This is my fourth contention.    In the fifth place, I am of opinion that, owing to the exaggerated and  erroneous significance attributed by our society to love and to the  idealized states that accompany and succeed it, the best energies of our  men and women are drawn forth and exhausted during the most promising  period of life; those of the men in the work of looking for, choosing,  and winning the most desirable objects of love, for which purpose lying  and fraud are held to be quite excusable; those of the women and girls  in alluring men and decoying them into liaisons or marriage by the most  questionable means conceivable, as an instance of which the present  fashions in evening dress may be cited. I am of opinion that this is not  right.    The truth is, that the whole affair has been exalted by poets and  romancers to an undue importance, and that love in its various  developments is not a fitting object to consume the best energies of  men. People set it before them and strive after it, because their view  of life is as vulgar and brutish as is that other conception frequently  met with in the lower stages of development, which sees in luscious  and abundant food an end worthy of man's best efforts. Now, this is not  right and should not be done. And, in order to avoid doing it, it is  only needful to realize the fact that whatever truly deserves to be held  up as a worthy object of man's striving and working, whether it be the  service of humanity, of one's country, of science, of art, not to speak  of the service of God, is far above and beyond the sphere of personal  enjoyment. Hence, it follows that not only to form a liaison, but  even to contract marriage, is, from a Christian point of view, not a  progress, but a fall. Love, and all the states that accompany and follow  it, however we may try in prose and verse to prove the contrary, never  do and never can facilitate the attainment of an aim worthy of men, but  always make it more difficult. This is my fifth contention.    How about the human race? If we admit that celibacy is better and nobler  than marriage, evidently the human race will come to an end. But, if the  logical conclusion of the argument is that the human race will become  extinct, the whole reasoning is wrong.    To that I reply that the argument is not mine; I did not invent it. That  it is incumbent on mankind so to strive, and that celibacy is preferable  to marriage, are truths revealed by Christ 1,900 years ago, set forth in  our catechisms, and professed by us as followers of Christ.    Chastity and celibacy, it is urged, cannot constitute the ideal of  humanity, because chastity would annihilate the race which strove  to realize it, and humanity cannot set up as its ideal its own  annihilation. It may be pointed out in reply that only that is a true  ideal, which, being unattainable, admits of infinite gradation in  degrees of proximity. Such is the Christian ideal of the founding of  God's kingdom, the union of all living creatures by the bonds of love.  The conception of its attainment is incompatible with the conception  of the movement of life. What kind of life could subsist if all  living creatures were joined together by the bonds of love? None. Our  conception of life is inseparably bound up with the conception of a  continual striving after an unattainable ideal.    But even if we suppose the Christian ideal of perfect chastity realized,  what then? We should merely find ourselves face to face on the one hand  with the familiar teaching of religion, one of whose dogmas is that the  world will have an end; and on the other of so-called science, which  informs us that the sun is gradually losing its heat, the result of  which will in time be the extinction of the human race.    Now there is not and cannot be such an institution as Christian  marriage, just as there cannot be such a thing as a Christian liturgy  (Matt. vi. 5-12; John iv. 21), nor Christian teachers, nor church  fathers (Matt. xxiii. 8-10), nor Christian armies, Christian law courts,  nor Christian States. This is what was always taught and believed by  true Christians of the first and following centuries. A Christian's  ideal is not marriage, but"]]]
