A tree never more than  twenty-five feet high. The principal 'mulga' tree. Mr. S. Dixon  praises it particularly as valuable for fodder of pasture animals;  hence it might locally serve for ensilage. Mr. W. Johnson found in the  foliage a considerable quantity of starch and gum, rendering it  nutritious. Cattle and sheep browse on the twigs of this, and some  allied species, even in the presence of plentiful grass; and are much  sustained by such acacias in seasons of protracted drought.  Dromedaries in Australia crave for the mulga as food. Wood excessively  hard, dark-brown; used, preferentially, by the natives for boomerangs,  sticks with which to lift edible roots, and shafts of phragmites,  spears, wommerahs, nulla-nullas, and jagged spear ends. Mr. J.H.  Maiden determined the percentage of mimosa tannic acid in the  perfectly dry bark as 8.62.\" The mulga bears a small woody fruit  called the mulga apple. It somewhat resembles the taste of apples, and  is sweet. If crab apples, as is said, were the originals of all the  present kinds, I imagine an excellent fruit might be obtained from the  mulga by cultivation. As this tree is necessarily so often mentioned  in my travels, the remarks of so eminent a botanist upon it cannot be  otherwise than welcome.    In the direction of south-south-east Mr. Carmichael said the country  appeared most open. A yellow flower, of the immortelle species, which  I picked at this little bluff, was an old Darling acquaintance; the  vegetation, in many respects, resembles that of the River Darling.  There was no water at this bluff, and the horses wandered all over the  country during the night, in mobs of twos and threes. It was midday  before we got away. For several hours we kept on south-south-east,  over sandhills and through casuarina timber, in unvarying monotony. At  about five o'clock the little mare that had foaled yesterday gave in,  and would travel no farther. We were obliged to leave her amongst the  sandhills.    We continued until we had travelled forty miles from Mount Udor, but  no signs of a creek or any place likely to produce or hold water had  been found. The only difference in the country was that it was now  more open, though the spinifex was as lively as ever.    We passed several quandong trees in full fruit, of which we ate a  great quantity; they were the most palatable, and sweetest I have ever  eaten. We also passed a few Currajong-trees (Brachychiton). At this  point we turned nearly east. It was, however, now past sundown, too  dark to go on any farther, and we had again to encamp without water,  our own small supply being so limited that we could have only a third  of a pint each, and we could not eat anything in consequence. The  horses had to be very short-hobbled to prevent their straying, and we  passed the night under the umbrage of a colossal Currajong-tree. The  unfortunate horses had now been two days and nights without water, and  could not feed; being so short-hobbled, they were almost in sight of  the camp in the morning. From the top of a sandhill I saw that the  eastern horizon was bounded by timbered ridges, and it was not very  probable that the creek I was searching for could lie between us and  them. Indeed, I concluded that the creek had exhausted itself, not far  from where we had left it. The western horizon was now bounded by low  ridges, continuous for many miles. I decided to make for our last camp  on the creek, distant some five-and-twenty miles north-east. At five  miles after starting, we came upon a mass of eucalypts which were not  exactly gum-trees, though of that family, and I thought this might be  the end of the exhausted creek channel, only the timber grew  promiscuously on the tops of the sandhills, as in the lower ground  between them. There was no appearance of any flow of water ever having  passed by these trees, and indeed they looked more like gigantic  mallee-trees than gums, only that they grew separately. They covered a  space of about half a mile wide. From here I saw that some ridges were  right before me, at a short distance, but where our line of march  would intersect them they seemed so scrubby and stony I wished to  avoid them. At one point I discerned a notch or gap. The horses were  now very troublesome to drive, the poor creatures being very bad with  thirst. I turned on the bearing that would take me back to the old  creek, which seemed the only spot in this desolate region where water  could be found, and there we had to dig to get it. At one place on the  ridges before us appeared a few pine-trees (Callitris) which enliven  any region they inhabit, and there is usually water in their  neighbourhood. The rocks from which the pines grew were much broken;  they were yet, however, five or six miles away. We travelled directly  towards them, and upon approaching, I found the rocks upheaved in a  most singular manner, and a few gum-trees were visible at the foot of  the ridge. I directed Carmichael and Robinson to avoid the stones as  much as possible, while I rode over to see whether there was a creek  or any other place where water might be procured. On approaching the  rocks at the foot of the ridge, I found several enormous overhanging  ledges of sandstone, under which the natives had evidently been  encamped long and frequently; and there was the channel of a small  watercourse scarcely more than six feet wide. I rode over to another  overhanging ledge and found it formed a verandah wide enough to make a  large cave; upon the walls of this, the natives had painted strange  devices of snakes, principally in white; the children had scratched  imperfect shapes of hands with bits of charcoal. The whole length of  this cave had frequently been a large encampment. Looking about with  some hopes of finding the place where these children of the wilderness  obtained water, I espied about a hundred yards away, and on the  opposite side of the little glen or valley, a very peculiar looking  crevice between two huge blocks of sandstone, and apparently not more  than a yard wide. I rode over to this spot, and to my great delight  found a most excellent little rock tarn, of nearly an oblong shape,  containing a most welcome and opportune supply of the fluid I was so  anxious to discover. Some green slime rested on a portion of the  surface, but the rest was all clear and pure water. My horse must have  thought me mad, and any one who had seen me might have thought I had  suddenly espied some basilisk, or cockatrice, or mailed saurian; for  just as the horse was preparing to dip his nose in the water he so  greatly wanted, I turned him away and made him gallop off after his  and my companions, who were slowly passing away from this liquid  prize. When I hailed, and overtook them, they could scarcely believe  that our wants were to be so soon and so agreeably relieved. There was  abundance of water for all our requirements here, but the approach was  so narrow that only two horses could drink at one time, and we had  great difficulty in preventing some of the horses from precipitating  themselves, loads and all, into the inviting fluid. No one who has not  experienced it, can imagine the pleasure which the finding of such a  treasure confers on the thirsty, hungry, and weary traveller; all his  troubles for the time are at an end. Thirst, that dire affliction that  besets the wanderer in the Australian wilds, at last is quenched; his  horses, unloaded, are allowed to roam and graze and drink at will,  free from the encumbrance of hobbles, and the traveller's other  appetite of hunger is also at length appeased, for no matter what food  one may carry, it is impossible to eat it without water. This was  truly a mental and bodily relief. After our hunger had been satisfied  I took a more extended survey of our surroundings, and found that we  had dropped into a really very pretty little spot.    Low sandstone hills, broken and split into most extraordinary shapes,  forming huge caves and caverns, that once no doubt had been some of  the cavernous depths of the ocean, were to be seen in every direction;  little runnels, with a few gum-trees upon them, constituted the  creeks. Callitris or cypress pines, ornamented the landscape, and a  few blood-wood or red gum-trees also enlivened the scene. No  porcupine, but real green grass made up a really pretty picture, to  the explorer at least. This little spot is indeed an oasis. I had  climbed high hills, traversed untold miles of scrub, and gone in all  directions to try and pick up the channel of a wretched dry creek,  when all of a sudden I stumbled upon a perfect little paradise. I  found the dimensions of this little tarn are not very large, nor is  the quantity of water in it very great, but untouched and in its  native state it is certainly a permanent water for its native owners.  It has probably not been filled since last January or February, and it  now contains amply sufficient water to enable it to last until those  months return, provided that no such enormous drinkers as horses draw  upon it; in that case it might not last a month. I found the actual  water was fifty feet long, by eight feet wide, and four feet deep; the  rocks in which the water lies are more than twenty feet high. The main  ridges at the back are between 200 and 300 feet high. The native  fig-tree (Ficus orbicularis) grows here most luxuriantly; there are  several of them in full fruit, which is delicious when thoroughly  ripe. I had no thought of deserting this welcome little spot for a few  days. On the following morning Mr. Carmichael and I loaded a  pack-horse with water and started back into the scrub to where we left  the little mare the day before yesterday. With protractor and paper I  found the spot we left her at bore from this place south 70 degrees  west, and that she was now no more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4975"],[0,"Spinifex and Sand (#20)"],[1,"five; for an  extra hand, Alfred Morris, had been engaged. Between us the duties of the  day's work were divided.    Our daily labours included hunting up the camels, lest they strayed or  were stolen, cutting timber for mining or firewood, packing water from the  rocks five miles away, and working on the mine.    I had occasion to make a journey to Lawlers, where a Warden, Mr. Clifton,  had lately been established, and I mention here an illustration of one of  the many intelligent traits in the character of camels.    Not wishing to follow the road in its many turns from water to water, I  cut through the bush for some fifty miles. The first part was over hard,  stony ground, then came sand, then more stones, and then I struck the road  again about two miles from Lawlers. I stayed there two or three days,  intending to return on my tracks. Wishing to test the intelligence of my  camel Satan I allowed him a free rein, either to keep on the track or turn  off for a short cut. As soon as we came to the spot where we had first  struck the road, he turned into the bush without hesitation with his nose  for home. After some eight miles of stones, on which I could distinguish  no trail, we came to the sand, and at once I could see our former tracks  right ahead, which little Satan had followed with the precision of a  black-fellow.    In repasssing old camping-places on the road, camels will often stop, and  look surprised if made to go further. They have, too, an excellent idea of  time, and know very well when the day's march should come to an end.  With what sad reproof they look at one with their great, brown eyes, that  say, as plainly as eyes can speak, \"What! going on? I am SO tired.\"  I fancy the reason that camels are so often described as stupid and  vicious, and so forth, is that they are seen, as a rule, in large mobs  under the care of Indian or other black drivers, whose carelessness and  cruelty (so far as my experience goes) are unspeakable. For that reason I  never have had an Afghan driver in my employ, nor can I see any advantage  in employing one, unless it be on the score of cheapness. Camels are  infinitely better managed and treated by white men--of course, I speak  within my own knowledge of Australia--and in consequence their characters  develop, and they are properly appreciated.    In due course the expected inspecting engineer came to see our mine, and,  as he had several reports to make, we had the pleasure of his company at  our camp, and very glad we were to do what we could for such a fine  specimen of an expert and gentleman as Mr. Edward Hooper. He was satisfied  with what he saw--indeed, he could hardly have been otherwise at that  period of the mine's existence; and on our arrival in Cue, wither we had  travelled part of the way together, a bargain was struck, and before many  days Jim and I returned with the glad tidings that the mine was sold, and  would be taken over forthwith.    The road from Cue was as uninteresting as all others on the goldfields--  miles of flat, sandy soil covered with dense scrub, an occasional open  plain of grass and saltbush round the foot of the breakaways, and cliffs  that are pretty frequently met with. Travellers on this road had been kept  lively by a band of marauding black-fellows, most of whom had \"done time\"  at Rotnest Jail for cattle-spearing, probably, on the coast stations.  Having learnt the value of white-fellows' food, they took to the road, and  were continually bailing up lonely swagmen, who were forced to give up  their provisions or be knocked on the head, since hardly any carried  firearms. The finest prize that they captured was a loaded camel, which in  some extraordinary way had got adrift from the end of a large caravan,  and wandered into the scrub. The Afghans, when they had perceived their  loss, tracked up the camel, only to find it dying in agony, with its knees  chopped nearly two. This was Jacky-Jacky's way of putting the poor beast  down to be unloaded. Happily, after a Warden was appointed at Lawlers, a  trooper was sent out, who broke up the gang and captured most of them, at  the expense of the life of one black tracker.    One of these thieves paid our camp a visit, but the sight of a rifle,  combined with a smart blow on the shins with a stick, quite satisfied him  that he had come to the wrong place.    Returned to Lake Darlot, we impatiently awaited the arrival of those who  were to take over the mine from us. At last they came, and it only  remained to pack up our traps, take the road to Coolgardie, and finish up  all business connected with the syndicate. There we parted, Conley and  Egan leaving with their shares; and with regret on both sides I think,  that our ways no longer lay together: for months of close companionship in  the bush, facing hardships and sometimes mutual dangers, make a close tie  of friendship between men, that is not easily broken.    Wishing to pay a visit to the old country, and yet not caring to part with  the camels which had been my property for some months past, and of which I  was very fond, we formed a syndicate, composed of Dave Wilson, Charles  Stansmore, and Alfred Morris, who found the money, and myself, who found  the camels, the profits of the venture, if any arose, to be divided in a  proportion agreed upon. I could depart, therefore, with the satisfactory  feeling of knowing that my faithful animal-friends would be well cared  for.    Shares were rising, the mine was sold, and the work done, and it was with  a light heart that I booked passage for London in October, 1895.            PART IV     MINING          CHAPTER I        QUARTZ REEFING AND DRY-BLOWING      I would not, even if I had the requisite knowledge, wish to bore the  reader by giving a scientific account of gold-mining, but Western  Australia presents so many appearances differing from those in other  gold-producing countries, and so varied are some of the methods of  obtaining gold, that I hope a short account of the usual ways of winning  the precious metal, purely from a prospector's point of view, will be of  interest.    The area over which the goldfields extend, may be described as very gently  undulating country, from which rise, at intervals, low ranges or isolated  hills.* These ranges, in reality seldom over 200 feet above the plain,  have in the distance a far more important appearance. It is a common  experience to steer for a range, sighted from perhaps a distance of  fifteen miles, and find on closer inspection that it is no more than a low  line of rocks. It is equally common for a hill to appear as quite a  respectable mountain when seen from one point, but entirely to disappear  from view when seen from the opposite direction, so gentle is the slope.    [* Mount Burgess, the highest hill around Coolgardie, is about 500 feet  above surrounding country.]    These ranges, such as they are, occur at intervals of a few miles up to  thirty or more, and between them scrub-covered plains, sand-plains, or  flat stretches of open forest are found. In the deeper undulations, long  chains of dry salt-lakes and samphire-flats are met with, occupying a  narrow belt, perhaps one hundred miles in length. Doubtless were the  rainfall greater, these lakes would be connected, and take the place of  rivers, which would eventually find their way into the Australian Bight.  Unfortunately for the comfort of travellers, this is not the case, and  their water supply must depend upon one or other of the various sources  already described.    The first aim of a party of Western Australian prospectors is to find not  gold, but water. Having found this they make camp, and from it start short  excursions in all directions towards any hill that may be in sight.  Arrived at the hills, which, though bare of undergrowth, are usually  covered with low scrub, they can soon determine from the nature the rock  whether further search is likely to have good results. Should they see  hills of ironstone and diorite, or blows and outcrops of quartz, they  will certainly revisit the locality. In what manner, will depend upon the  distance from water. They may be able to form camp in the desired spot,  with water close at hand; or the party may have to divide, some camping in  the likely country, engaged in prospecting solely, while the others \"tail\"  the horses or camels at the watering-place and pack water to their mates.  In cases where \"good gold is getting,\" water has sometimes been packed  distances of twenty to forty miles; or it may happen that good country  must be passed over, from the want of water within reasonable distance.    From his limited appliances and means, a prospector's object is to find a  vein or reef of gold-bearing ore, not by sinking, but from surface  indications.    Veins or reefs may be described as layers, which have been deposited in  fissures and cracks in the rock surrounding them. The enclosing rock is  known as the \"country rock.\" \"Lodes\" are veins composed of a mixture of  quartz, ironstone, and other material, and usually exceed in width the  \"reefs,\" which sometimes, as at Southern Cross, attain thirty feet, but  are rarely more than one to four feet in thickness. The part of a reef  showing above the surface is the \"outcrop,\" which may appear either as a  mass or \"blow\" of quartz, sometimes sixty feet in height, or as a solid  wall or dyke which can be followed for perhaps five miles without a break;  the direction in which it runs is known as its \"strike.\"    Reefs may go down vertically, or on a sloping \"dip\" or \"underlay.\" The  country rock lying immediately above the reef is the \"hanging wall,\" and  that immediately below, the \"foot wall.\"      In prospecting a reef, a miner walks along the strike of the outcrop,  \"napping\" as he goes, i.e., breaking off with a hammer or pick, pieces of  the quartz or ironstone outcrop. Each fragment is carefully examined for  the presence of gold,"]]]
