Her engagement was owing to the remonstrances of Mr. Pitt Crawley, the  only friend or protector Lady Crawley ever had, and the only person,  besides her children, for whom she entertained a little feeble  attachment.  Mr. Pitt took after the noble Binkies, from whom he was  descended, and was a very polite and proper gentleman.  When he grew to  man's estate, and came back from Christchurch, he began to reform the  slackened discipline of the hall, in spite of his father, who stood in  awe of him.  He was a man of such rigid refinement, that he would have  starved rather than have dined without a white neckcloth.  Once, when  just from college, and when Horrocks the butler brought him a letter  without placing it previously on a tray, he gave that domestic a look,  and administered to him a speech so cutting, that Horrocks ever after  trembled before him; the whole household bowed to him: Lady Crawley's  curl-papers came off earlier when he was at home: Sir Pitt's muddy  gaiters disappeared; and if that incorrigible old man still adhered to  other old habits, he never fuddled himself with rum-and-water in his  son's presence, and only talked to his servants in a very reserved and  polite manner; and those persons remarked that Sir Pitt never swore at  Lady Crawley while his son was in the room.    It was he who taught the butler to say, \"My lady is served,\" and who  insisted on handing her ladyship in to dinner.  He seldom spoke to her,  but when he did it was with the most powerful respect; and he never let  her quit the apartment without rising in the most stately manner to  open the door, and making an elegant bow at her egress.    At Eton he was called Miss Crawley; and there, I am sorry to say, his  younger brother Rawdon used to lick him violently.  But though his  parts were not brilliant, he made up for his lack of talent by  meritorious industry, and was never known, during eight years at  school, to be subject to that punishment which it is generally thought  none but a cherub can escape.    At college his career was of course highly creditable. And here he  prepared himself for public life, into which he was to be introduced by  the patronage of his grandfather, Lord Binkie, by studying the ancient  and modern orators with great assiduity, and by speaking unceasingly at  the debating societies.  But though he had a fine flux of words, and  delivered his little voice with great pomposity and pleasure to  himself, and never advanced any sentiment or opinion which was not  perfectly trite and stale, and supported by a Latin quotation; yet he  failed somehow, in spite of a mediocrity which ought to have insured  any man a success.  He did not even get the prize poem, which all his  friends said he was sure of.    After leaving college he became Private Secretary to Lord Binkie, and  was then appointed Attache to the Legation at Pumpernickel, which post  he filled with perfect honour, and brought home despatches, consisting  of Strasburg pie, to the Foreign Minister of the day.  After remaining  ten years Attache (several years after the lamented Lord Binkie's  demise), and finding the advancement slow, he at length gave up the  diplomatic service in some disgust, and began to turn country gentleman.    He wrote a pamphlet on Malt on returning to England (for he was an  ambitious man, and always liked to be before the public), and took a  strong part in the Negro Emancipation question.  Then he became a  friend of Mr. Wilberforce's, whose politics he admired, and had that  famous correspondence with the Reverend Silas Hornblower, on the  Ashantee Mission.  He was in London, if not for the Parliament session,  at least in May, for the religious meetings.  In the country he was a  magistrate, and an active visitor and speaker among those destitute of  religious instruction.  He was said to be paying his addresses to Lady  Jane Sheepshanks, Lord Southdown's third daughter, and whose sister,  Lady Emily, wrote those sweet tracts, \"The Sailor's True Binnacle,\" and  \"The Applewoman of Finchley Common.\"    Miss Sharp's accounts of his employment at Queen's Crawley were not  caricatures.  He subjected the servants there to the devotional  exercises before mentioned, in which (and so much the better) he  brought his father to join.  He patronised an Independent meeting-house  in Crawley parish, much to the indignation of his uncle the Rector, and  to the consequent delight of Sir Pitt, who was induced to go himself  once or twice, which occasioned some violent sermons at Crawley parish  church, directed point-blank at the Baronet's old Gothic pew there.  Honest Sir Pitt, however, did not feel the force of these discourses,  as he always took his nap during sermon-time.    Mr. Crawley was very earnest, for the good of the nation and of the  Christian world, that the old gentleman should yield him up his place  in Parliament; but this the elder constantly refused to do. Both were  of course too prudent to give up the fifteen hundred a year which was  brought in by the second seat (at this period filled by Mr. Quadroon,  with carte blanche on the Slave question); indeed the family estate was  much embarrassed, and the income drawn from the borough was of great  use to the house of Queen's Crawley.    It had never recovered the heavy fine imposed upon Walpole Crawley,  first baronet, for peculation in the Tape and Sealing Wax Office. Sir  Walpole was a jolly fellow, eager to seize and to spend money (alieni  appetens, sui profusus, as Mr. Crawley would remark with a sigh), and  in his day beloved by all the county for the constant drunkenness and  hospitality which was maintained at Queen's Crawley. The cellars were  filled with burgundy then, the kennels with hounds, and the stables  with gallant hunters; now, such horses as Queen's Crawley possessed  went to plough, or ran in the Trafalgar Coach; and it was with a team  of these very horses, on an off-day, that Miss Sharp was brought to the  Hall; for boor as he was, Sir Pitt was a stickler for his dignity while  at home, and seldom drove out but with four horses, and though he dined  off boiled mutton, had always three footmen to serve it.    If mere parsimony could have made a man rich, Sir Pitt Crawley might  have become very wealthy--if he had been an attorney in a country town,  with no capital but his brains, it is very possible that he would have  turned them to good account, and might have achieved for himself a very  considerable influence and competency. But he was unluckily endowed  with a good name and a large though encumbered estate, both of which  went rather to injure than to advance him.  He had a taste for law,  which cost him many thousands yearly; and being a great deal too clever  to be robbed, as he said, by any single agent, allowed his affairs to  be mismanaged by a dozen, whom he all equally mistrusted. He was such a  sharp landlord, that he could hardly find any but bankrupt tenants; and  such a close farmer, as to grudge almost the seed to the ground,  whereupon revengeful Nature grudged him the crops which she granted to  more liberal husbandmen. He speculated in every possible way; he worked  mines; bought canal-shares; horsed coaches; took government contracts,  and was the busiest man and magistrate of his county.  As he would not  pay honest agents at his granite quarry, he had the satisfaction of  finding that four overseers ran away, and took fortunes with them to  America.  For want of proper precautions, his coal-mines filled with  water: the government flung his contract of damaged beef upon his  hands: and for his coach-horses, every mail proprietor in the kingdom  knew that he lost more horses than any man in the country, from  underfeeding and buying cheap. In disposition he was sociable, and far  from being proud; nay, he rather preferred the society of a farmer or a  horse-dealer to that of a gentleman, like my lord, his son: he was fond  of drink, of swearing, of joking with the farmers' daughters: he was  never known to give away a shilling or to do a good action, but was of  a pleasant, sly, laughing mood, and would cut his joke and drink his  glass with a tenant and sell him up the next day; or have his laugh  with the poacher he was transporting with equal good humour.  His  politeness for the fair sex has already been hinted at by Miss Rebecca  Sharp--in a word, the whole baronetage, peerage, commonage of England,  did not contain a more cunning, mean, selfish, foolish, disreputable  old man.  That blood-red hand of Sir Pitt Crawley's would be in  anybody's pocket except his own; and it is with grief and pain, that,  as admirers of the British aristocracy, we find ourselves obliged to  admit the existence of so many ill qualities in a person whose name is  in Debrett.    One great cause why Mr. Crawley had such a hold over the affections of  his father, resulted from money arrangements.  The Baronet owed his son  a sum of money out of the jointure of his mother, which he did not find  it convenient to pay; indeed he had an almost invincible repugnance to  paying anybody, and could only be brought by force to discharge his  debts.  Miss Sharp calculated (for she became, as we shall hear  speedily, inducted into most of the secrets of the family) that the  mere payment of his creditors cost the honourable Baronet several  hundreds yearly; but this was a delight he could not forego; he had a  savage pleasure in making the poor wretches wait, and in shifting from  court to court and from term to term the period of satisfaction.  What's the good of being in Parliament, he said, if you must pay your  debts? Hence, indeed, his position as a senator was not a little useful  to him.    Vanity Fair--Vanity Fair!

I broke my knife, first try, and the axe was too  big. He told me, poor fellow, that two days before, as he was returning  from prospecting up towards the back ranges, his horse got away, and he  _couldn't_ catch him. No: he tried with all his might and main, for in  his swag, which was strapped to the D's of his saddle, was not only his  blanket, but his baccy, and tea, and damper, and a glass o' grog. The  curious thing, too, was that the horse didn't bolt right away, as they  generally do: he jest walked a-head, knowing his master was bound to  follow wherever he led, for in coorse he had hopes to catch him every  moment. That ere brute, he never laid down nor rested,--jest kep slowly  moving on, as if he was a Lunnon street-boy, with a bobby at his heels.  Through creeks and rivers and swamps he led that poor fellow. His boots  got chuck full o' cold water, and when the sun went down it friz into  solid hice; and that misfortnit man he felt his legs--which was  his life, you see, ma'am--gradially dyin' under him. Yet he was a  well-plucked one, if ever there was such a party on this airth. He told  me he had took _five_ mortial hours to come the last mile, the horse  walkin' slowly afore him, and guiding him like. And how do you think he  did it, with two pillars of hice for legs? Why he lifted up just one leg  and then the other with both his hands, and put them afore him, and took  his steps that way.\"    Here honest Ned, his eyes glistening, and his ugly little face glowing  with emotion through its coating of sunburn, paused, as if he did not  like to go on.    I was more touched and interested than I could avoid showing, and  cried, \"Oh, _do_ tell me, Palmer, what became of the poor fellow! Did he  die?\"    Ned cleared his throat, and moved so as to get between me and the light  from the door, as he said huskily, \"He came very nigh to it, ma'am. I  never did set eyes on such a decent patient chap as that man was. I did  the very wust thing I could a' done, the town doctors told me, for I  brought him into the hut, instead o' keeping him outdoors and rubbing  his poor black legs with snow. 'Stead o' that, I wrapped him up warm in  my own blankets, after I had chipped his boots and the hice off of 'em,  and I made up a roarin' fire. Good Lord, how the poor fellow groaned  when he begun to get warm! I gave him a pannikin full o' hot tea, with  a drop o' grog in it, and that seemed to make him awful bad. At last he  said, with the sweat from sheer agony pouring down his face, \"Look here,  matey: couldn't you hump me out in the snow again? for it aint nigh so  bad to bear it cold as it is to bear it hot.\" Not a bad word did he say,  ma'am, and he tried not to give in more nor he could help; but he was  clean druv wild with the hanguish in his legs.    \"Presently I remembers, quite sudden like, that a bush doctor, name of  Tomkins, was likely to be round by Simmons, cos' o' his missus. So I got  on my 'oss in a minnit, and I rides off and fetches him, for sure  enough he was there; and though Simmons' missis wasn't to say over her  troubles, she spoke up from behind the curtain of red blanket she had  put up in her tidy little hut, and bade old Tomkins go with me. May God  bless her and hers for that same, say I! Well, ma'am, when Tomkins come  back with me and saw the poor fellow (he was fair shoutin' with the pain  in his legs by then), he said nothin' could be done. \"They'll mortify  by morrow mornin',\" says he, \"and then he'll die easy.\" So with that he  goes back with the first light next day, to Simmons. Sure enough, the  poor fellow did get a bit easier next day, and I felt clear mad to  think he was goin' to die before my very eyes. \"Not if I can help it!\" I  cries, quite savage like. But he only smiled a patient smile, and said,  \"God's will be done, mate. He knows best, and I aint in any pain to  speak of, now.\"    \"By and bye I hears a rumbling and a creaking, and cracking of whips;  and when I looks out, what do I see but the bullock-dray from Simmons'  coming up the flat. It was the only thing on wheels within forty mile,  and Simmons had brought it his own self to see if we couldn't manage to  get the poor fellow down to the nighest town. I won't make my yarn no  longer than I can help, ma'am, so I'll only mention that we made a lot  o' the strongest mutton broth you ever tasted; we slung a hammock of red  blankets in the dray, and we got the poor fellow down by evening to a  gentleman's station. There they made us kindly welcome, did all they  could for him, and transhipped the hammock into a pair-horse dray, which  went quicker and was easier. We got on as fast as we could every step of  the way, and by midnight that poor fellow was tucked into a clean bed  in the hospital at Christchurch, with both his legs neatly cut off just  above the knee, for there wasn't a minute to lose.\"    I was almost afraid to inquire how the sufferer fared, for Ned's eyes  were fairly swimming with unshed tears; but he smiled brightly,  and said, \"The ladies and gentlemen in the town, they set up a  _subscribetion_, and bought the poor chap a first-rate pair o' wooden  legs, and he could even manage to ride about after a bit; and instead  o' wandering about looking for country, or gold, or what not, he settled  down as a carrier, and throve and did well. And I was thinking, ma'am,  as how I'd like to return thanks for that poor fellow's wonderful  recovery, for I've never had a chance of going to Church since, and its  nigh upon two years ago that it happened.\"    \"So you shall, Ned: so you shall!\" we said with one voice. And so at our  first Church gathering at our dear little antipodean home, F----, who  acted as our minister, paused in the beautiful Thanksgiving Service,  after he had read solemnly and slowly the simple words, \"Especially for  Thy late mercies vouchsafed to ----,\" and Ned Palmer chimed in with an  \"Amen,\"--misplaced, indeed, but none the less hearty, and delightful to  hear.        Chapter X: Swaggers.      Dr. Johnson did not know the somewhat vulgar word which heads this  paper. At least he did not know it as a noun, but gives \"swagger: v.n.,  to bluster, bully, brag;\" but the Slang Dictionary admits it as a word,  springing indeed from the thieves' vocabulary: \"one who carries a swag.\"  Neither of these books however give the least idea of the true meaning  of the expression, which is as fully recognised as an honest word in  both Australia and New Zealand as any other combination of letters  in the English language. A swagger is the very antithesis then of a  swaggerer, for, whereas, the one is full of pretension and abounds  in unjust claims on our notice, the swagger is humility and civility  itself. He knows, poor weary tramp, that on the favourable impression he  makes upon the \"boss,\" depends his night's lodging and food, as well as  a job of work in the future. We will leave then the ideal swaggerer to  some other biographer who may draw glowing word-pictures of him in all  his jay's splendour, and we will confine ourselves to describing the  real swagger, clad in flannel shirt, moleskin trowsers, and what were  once thick boots, but might now be used as sieves.    Nothing astonished me so much in my New Zealand Station Life as these  visitors. Even Sir Roger de Coverley himself would have looked with  distrust upon most of our swagger-guests, and yet I never heard of an  instance in our part of the country where the unhesitating, ungrudging  hospitality extended by the rich squatters to their poorer compatriots  was ever abused. I say \"in our part,\" because unfortunately, wherever  gold is discovered, either in quartz or riverbed, the good old primitive  customs and ways die out of themselves in a few weeks, and each  mammon-seeker looks with distrust on a stranger. Only fifty or sixty  miles from us, as the crow might fly across the snowy range, where an  immense Bush clothes the banks of the Hokitika river right down to its  sand-filled mouth on the West Coast, the great gold diggings broke  out seven or eight years ago, and changed the face of society in that  district in a few days. _There_ a swagger meant a man who might rob or  murder you in your sleep after you had fed and lodged him; or--under  the most favourable circumstances supposing him to be a \"milder mannered  man,\"--a \"fossicker,\" who would not hesitate to \"jump your claim,\" or  hang about when you are prospecting, to watch how much of the colour you  found, and then go off stealthily to return next day at the head of a  \"rush\" of a thousand diggers.    Even before the famous Maungatapu murders in 1866, swaggers were looked  upon with distrust on the West Coast, and after that date hardly any  one travelled in those parts without carrying a small revolver in  his breast-pocket. Nothing is more tantalising than an allusion to a  circumstance which is not well-known; and as I feel certain that very  few of my readers have ever heard of what may be called the first great  crime committed in the Middle Island, a brief account of that terrible  tragedy may not be out of place. Gold of course was at the bottom of it,  but the canvas-bags full of the glittering flakes were red with blood by  the time they reached the bank at Nelson. The diggings on the West Coast  were only two years old at that date, and although it was not uncommon  for prospecting parties cutting their way, axe in hand, through the  thick bush, to come upon skeletons of men in lonely places, still  it might be taken for granted that these were the remains of early  explorers or travellers who had got lost and starved to death within  the green tangled walls of this impenetrable forest. The scenery of that  part of the Middle Island is far more beautiful than in the agricultural  or pastoral districts. Giant Alps clothed half up their steep sides  with evergreen pines,--"]]]
