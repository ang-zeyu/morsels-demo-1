It will be seen, therefore, that the vicarious labor of the living for  the dead, as performed in the temples of the present day, comprises  more than baptism and confirmation. The work is completed on earth only  when the parties, in the persons of their living representatives, have  been baptized, confirmed, endowed, and sealed both in the relationship  of husband and wife as once existent and in the family union of parents  and children.

This passage has been the subject of much controversy. Dr. Adam  Clarke, in his masterly Commentary of the Scriptures, says: \"This  is certainly the most difficult verse in the New Testament; for,  notwithstanding the greatest and wisest men have labored to explain it,  there are to this day nearly as many different interpretations of it as  there are interpreters.\" Yet, notwithstanding its enigmatic meaning,  this passage of scripture is part of the prescribed burial service  in the Episcopal Church, and is duly spoken by the priest at every  funeral. But wherein lies the difficulty of comprehension? The passage  is of plain import, and only when we attempt to make it figurative  do difficulties arise. It is plain that in Paul's day the ordinance  of baptism for the dead was both understood and practised, and the  apostle's argument in support of the doctrine of a literal resurrection  is sound: If the dead rise not at all, why then are they baptized for  the dead?    9.

CHAPTER V    MODERN DAY TEMPLES--THE TEMPLES AT KIRTLAND AND NAUVOO    {110} As to general design, and indeed as to details of plan and  construction of the earlier sanctuaries, much has been preserved to  us through the pages of sacred writ. From the Biblical record alone  it would be possible to practically reproduce the Tabernacle of the  Congregation and the later Temple of Solomon; though, had we no  information to supplement the Biblical account, we would know but  little as to procedure requisite to the administration of ordinances  specifically pertaining to temples.    Regarding the plan of building and the structural design of temples,  we find no close similarity, far less of aught approaching identity,  in these holy houses as erected in different dispensations; on  the contrary we may affirm that direct revelation of temple plans  is required for each distinctive period of the Priesthood's  administration, that is to say for every dispensation of Divine  authority. While the general purpose of temples is the same in all  times, the special suitability of these edifices is determined by the  needs of the dispensation to which they severally belong.    There is a definite sequence of development in the dealings of God with  man throughout the centuries; and it is this unity of order and purpose  that constitutes the {111} eternal unchangeableness of the Supreme  Being. Today is no mere repetition of yesterday; on the contrary, every  today is a sum of all precedent time, so that in each succeeding age  the Divine plan is farther advanced, and the grand finale in the great  drama of human salvation is brought nearer.    From the days of the ancient Tabernacle of the Congregation, and thence  onward to the meridian of time, animal sacrifice was required as an  ordained rite of propitiation and worship; and such was in prototype of  the sacrificial death predicted as part of the mission of the Son of  Man. The temples of the Hebrews who were living under the Mosaic law,  provided, therefore, for the slaughter of animals, for the ceremonial  dividing of the carcasses and for the due disposal of the blood, for  the convenient immolation of the offerings, and for numerous other  details of ceremony associated with worship under the law of Moses.    The Latter-day Saints are one with other Christian sects in the  unreserved acceptance of the doctrine that the atoning death of Christ  terminated the Mosaic rites of sacrifice involving the ceremonial  shedding of blood, that, in truth, the prototype was consummated in the  reality. The temples of today are provided with no altars of sacrifice,  no courts of slaughter, no shambles red with the blood of beasts, no  pyres on which carcasses are burned, no censers of incense to becloud  the fumes from burning flesh.    Even among the temples of the present dispensation there is a graded  variety in the details of construction. The first temple of modern  times was in a measure incomplete as compared with the holy houses of  later construction. {112} The fact was doubtless known to the Lord,  though wisely hidden from common knowledge, that the Kirtland Temple  would serve but for the beginning of the re-establishment of those  distinctive ordinances for which temples are essential. Even as the  Tabernacle of old was but an inferior type of what would follow,  designed for temporary use under special conditions, so the earlier  temples of the latter-day dispensation, specifically those of Kirtland  and Nauvoo, were but temporary Houses of the Lord, destined to serve  for short periods only as sanctuaries.    Scarcely had The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints been  organized when the Lord indicated the necessity of a temple, in which  He could reveal His mind and will to man, and in which the sanctifying  ordinances of the Gospel could be administered. In a revelation given  as early as December, 1830, the Lord said: \"I am Jesus Christ the Son  of God: wherefore gird up your loins and I will suddenly come to my  temple.\"[1] In February 1831, the Lord further indicated His purpose  thus: \"That my covenant people may be gathered in one in that day  when I shall come to my temple. And this I do for the salvation of  my people.\"[2] More definite instructions as to the practical labors  incident to the procuring of a site and the rearing of a temple soon  followed.    TEMPLE SITE AT INDEPENDENCE, MISSOURI    The principal seat of the Church had been temporarily established at  Kirtland, Ohio; nevertheless the prophet had learned through early  revelation that Zion would be {113} established far to the west. In  June, 1831, a conference of elders was held at Kirtland, on which  occasion a revelation[3] was received directing certain of the elders  to start westward, traveling in pairs and preaching by the way. In the  month following, these elders reassembled at a designated place in  western Missouri, all rejoicing in their ministry and eager to learn  the further will of the Lord. The burden of their prayer and song is  thus expressed by the prophet: \"When will the wilderness blossom as  the rose? When will Zion be built up in her glory, and where will thy  temple stand, unto which all nations shall come in the last days?\"[4]  In answer to their supplications the Lord spake by the mouth of His  prophet, designating the western part of Missouri as the land of Zion,  and the site occupied by the town of Independence as the \"center  place,\" and specifying a spot as that upon which a temple should be  built.[5]    On the third of August, 1831, the prophet Joseph Smith and seven other  elders of the Church assembled on the temple lot and dedicated the  same to its sacred purpose. Though the company was small, the occasion  was one of great solemnity and impressiveness. The prophet himself  offered the prayer of dedication.[6] The temple so projected is yet to  be built. Though the Latter-day Saints acquired by purchase title to  and possession of the {114} temple lot, they were later by violence  compelled to abandon their rightful possessions.    THE KIRTLAND TEMPLE    The building of a temple in Missouri was regarded, even by the prophet  and those who assisted him in dedicating the site, as an event of the  future, perhaps even of the far distant future. The center of activity,  the seat of the Church for the time being, was in Ohio, and Kirtland  was the place of temporary gathering. In Kirtland too was to be erected  the first temple of modern times.    In a revelation given December 27, 1832, the Lord commanded the  establishment of a holy house.[7] Perhaps because their eyes were  directed too steadily toward the \"center place,\" and because the people  were prone to contemplate too absorbedly the glory of the future to  the neglect of then present duties, compliance with the requirement  to proceed at once with the erection of a temple was not prompt; and  the Lord rebuked the people for their tardiness and neglect, declaring  again His will that a house be reared to His name and promising success  on condition "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4524"],[0,"Familiar Letters on Chemistry, and Its Relation to Commerce, Physiology, and (#20)"],[1,"of their seeds, are in direct proportion to  its absorption of the elementary parts of the soil in the preceding  epochs of its growth.    The fertility of the year depends in general upon the temperature,  and the moisture or dryness of the spring, if all the conditions  necessary to the assimilation of the atmospheric nourishment be  secured to our cultivated plants. The action of humus, then, as we  have explained it above, is chiefly of value in gaining time. In  agriculture, this must ever be taken into account and in this  respect humus is of importance in favouring the growth of  vegetables, cabbages, &c.    But the cerealia, and plants grown for their roots, meet on our  fields, in the remains of the preceding crop, with a quantity of  decaying vegetable substances corresponding to their contents of  mineral nutriment from the soil, and consequently with a quantity of  carbonic acid adequate to their accelerated development in the  spring. A further supply of carbonic acid, therefore, would be quite  useless, without a corresponding increase of mineral ingredients.    From a morgen of good meadow land, 2,500 pounds weight of hay,  according to the best agriculturists, are obtained on an average.  This amount is furnished without any supply of organic substances,  without manure containing carbon or nitrogen. By irrigation, and the  application of ashes or gypsum, double that amount may be grown. But  assuming 2,500 pounds weight of hay to be the maximum, we may  calculate the amount of carbon and nitrogen derived from the  atmosphere by the plants of meadows.    According to elementary analysis, hay, dried at a temperature of 100  deg Reaumur, contains 45.8 per cent. of carbon, and 1 1/2 per cent.  of nitrogen. 14 per cent. of water retained by the hay, dried at  common temperatures, is driven off at 100 deg. 2,500 pounds weight  of hay, therefore, corresponds to 2,150 pounds, dried at 100 deg.  This shows us, that 984 pounds of carbon, and 32.2 pounds weight of  nitrogen, have been obtained in the produce of one morgen of meadow  land. Supposing that this nitrogen has been absorbed by the plants  in the form of ammonia, the atmosphere contains 39.1 pounds weight  of ammonia to every 3640 pounds weight of carbonic acid (=984  carbon, or 27 per cent.), or in other words, to every 1,000 pounds  weight of carbonic acid, 10.7 pounds of ammonia, that is to about  1/100,000, the weight of the air, or 1/60,000 of its volume.    For every 100 parts of carbonic acid absorbed by the surface of the  leaves, the plant receives from the atmosphere somewhat more than  one part of ammonia.    With every 1,000 pounds of carbon, we obtain--      From a meadow . 32 7/10 pounds of nitrogen.      From cultivated fields,      In Wheat  . 21 1/2 \" \"    Oats      . 22.3   \" \"    Rye       . 15.2   \" \"    Potatoes  . 34.1   \" \"    Beetroot  . 39.1   \" \"    Clover    . 44     \" \"    Peas      . 62     \" \"      Boussingault obtained from his farm at Bechelbronn, in Alsace, in  five years, in the shape of potatoes, wheat, clover, turnips, and  oats, 8,383 of carbon, and 250.7 nitrogen. In the following five  years, as beetroot, wheat, clover, turnips, oats, and rye, 8,192 of  carbon, and 284.2 of nitrogen. In a further course of six years,  potatoes, wheat, clover, turnips, peas, and rye, 10,949 of carbon,  356.6 of nitrogen. In 16 years, 27,424 carbon, 858 1/2 nitrogen,  which gives for every 1,000 carbon, 31.3 nitrogen.    From these interesting and unquestionable facts, we may deduce some  conclusions of the highest importance in their application to  agriculture.    1. We observe that the relative proportions of carbon and nitrogen,  stand in a fixed relation to the surface of the leaves. Those  plants, in which all the nitrogen may be said to be concentrated in  the seeds, as the cerealia, contain on the whole less nitrogen than  the leguminous plants, peas, and clover.    2. The produce of nitrogen on a meadow which receives no  nitrogenised manure, is greater than that of a field of wheat which  has been manured.    3. The produce of nitrogen in clover and peas, which agriculturists  will acknowledge require no nitrogenised manure, is far greater than  that of a potato or turnip field, which is abundantly supplied with  such manures.    Lastly. And this is the most curious deduction to be derived from  the above facts,--if we plant potatoes, wheat, turnips, peas, and  clover, (plants containing potash, lime, and silex,) upon the same  land, three times manured, we gain in 16 years, for a given quantity  of carbon, the same proportion of nitrogen which we receive from a  meadow which has received no nitrogenised manure.    On a morgen of meadow-land, we obtain in plants, containing silex,  lime, and potash, 984 carbon, 32.2 nitrogen. On a morgen of  cultivated land, in an average of 16 years, in plants containing the  same mineral elements, silex, lime, and potash, 857 carbon, 26.8  nitrogen.    If we add the carbon and nitrogen of the leaves of the beetroot, and  the stalk and leaves of the potatoes, which have not been taken into  account, it still remains evident that the cultivated fields,  notwithstanding the supply of carbonaceous and nitrogenised manures,  produced no more carbon and nitrogen than an equal surface of  meadow-land supplied only with mineral elements.    What then is the rationale of the effect of manure,--of the solid  and fluid excrements of animals?    This question can now be satisfactorily answered: that effect is the  restoration of the elementary constituents of the soil which have  been gradually drawn from it in the shape of grain and cattle. If  the land I am speaking of had not been manured during those 16  years, not more than one-half, or perhaps than one-third part of the  carbon and nitrogen would have been produced. We owe it to the  animal excrements, that it equalled in production the meadow-land,  and this, because they restored the mineral ingredients of the soil  removed by the crops. All that the supply of manure accomplished,  was to prevent the land from becoming poorer in these, than the  meadow which produces 2,500 pounds of hay. We withdraw from the  meadow in this hay as large an amount of mineral substances as we do  in one harvest of grain, and we know that the fertility of the  meadow is just as dependent upon the restoration of these  ingredients to its soil, as the cultivated land is upon manures. Two  meadows of equal surface, containing unequal quantities of inorganic  elements of nourishment,--other conditions being equal,--are very  unequally fertile; that which possesses most, furnishes most hay. If  we do not restore to a meadow the withdrawn elements, its fertility  decreases. But its fertility remains unimpaired, with a due supply  of animal excrements, fluid and solid, and it not only remains the  same, but may be increased by a supply of mineral substances alone,  such as remain after the combustion of ligneous plants and other  vegetables; namely, ashes. Ashes represent the whole nourishment  which vegetables receive from the soil. By furnishing them in  sufficient quantities to our meadows, we give to the plants growing  on them the power of condensing and absorbing carbon and nitrogen by  their surface. May not the effect of the solid and fluid excrements,  which are the ashes of plants and grains, which have undergone  combustion in the bodies of animals and of man, be dependent upon  the same cause? Should not the fertility, resulting from their  application, be altogether independent of the ammonia they contain?  Would not their effect be precisely the same in promoting the  fertility of cultivated plants, if we had evaporated the urine, and  dried and burned the solid excrements? Surely the cerealia and  leguminous plants which we cultivate must derive their carbon and  nitrogen from the same source whence the graminea and leguminous  plants of the meadows obtain them! No doubt can be entertained of  their capability to do so.    In Virginia, upon the lowest calculation, 22 pounds weight of  nitrogen were taken on the average, yearly, from every morgen of the  wheat-fields. This would amount, in 100 years, to 2,200 pounds  weight. If this were derived from the soil, every morgen of it must  have contained the equivalent of 110,000 pounds weight of animal  excrements (assuming the latter, when dried, at the temperature of  boiling water, to contain 2 per cent.).    In Hungary, as I remarked in a former Letter, tobacco and wheat have  been grown upon the same field for centuries, without any supply of  nitrogenised manure. Is it possible that the nitrogen essential to,  and entering into, the composition of these crops, could have been  drawn from the soil?    Every year renews the foliage and fruits of our forests of beech,  oak, and chesnuts; the leaves, the acorns, the chesnuts, are rich in  nitrogen; so are cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, and other tropical  productions. This nitrogen is not supplied by man, can it indeed be  derived from any other source than the atmosphere?    In whatever form the nitrogen supplied to plants may be contained in  the atmosphere, in whatever state it may be when absorbed, from the  atmosphere it must have been derived. Did not the fields of Virginia  receive their nitrogen from the same source as wild plants?    Is the supply of nitrogen in the excrements of animals quite a  matter of indifference, or do we receive back from our fields a  quantity of the elements of blood corresponding to this supply?    The researches of Boussingault have solved this problem in the most  satisfactory manner. If, in his grand experiments, the manure which  he gave to his fields was in the same state, i.e. dried at 110 deg  in a vacuum, as it was when analysed, these fields received, in 16  years, 1,300 pounds of nitrogen. But we know that by drying all the  nitrogen escapes which is contained in solid animal excrements,"]]]
