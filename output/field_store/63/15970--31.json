[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7025"],[0,"Rob Roy â€” Complete (#20)"],[1,"   \"Words avail very little with me, young man,\" said my father, whose  inflexibility always possessed the air of the most perfect calmness of  self-possession. \"_Can not_ may be a more civil phrase than _will not,_  but the expressions are synonymous where there is no moral impossibility.  But I am not a friend to doing business hastily; we will talk this matter  over after dinner.--Owen!\"    Owen appeared, not with the silver locks which you were used to venerate,  for he was then little more than fifty; but he had the same, or an  exactly similar uniform suit of light-brown clothes,--the same pearl-grey  silk stockings,--the same stock, with its silver buckle,--the same  plaited cambric ruffles, drawn down over his knuckles in the parlour, but  in the counting-house carefully folded back under the sleeves, that they  might remain unstained by the ink which he daily consumed;--in a word,  the same grave, formal, yet benevolent cast of features, which continued  to his death to distinguish the head clerk of the great house of  Osbaldistone and Tresham.    \"Owen,\" said my father, as the kind old man shook me affectionately by  the hand, \"you must dine with us to-day, and hear the news Frank has  brought us from our friends in Bourdeaux.\"    Owen made one of his stiff bows of respectful gratitude; for, in those  days, when the distance between superiors and inferiors was enforced in a  manner to which the present times are strangers, such an invitation was a  favour of some little consequence.    I shall long remember that dinner-party. Deeply affected by feelings of  anxiety, not unmingled with displeasure, I was unable to take that active  share in the conversation which my father seemed to expect from me; and I  too frequently gave unsatisfactory answers to the questions with which he  assailed me. Owen, hovering betwixt his respect for his patron, and his  love for the youth he had dandled on his knee in childhood, like the  timorous, yet anxious ally of an invaded nation, endeavoured at every  blunder I made to explain my no-meaning, and to cover my retreat;  manoeuvres which added to my father's pettish displeasure, and brought a  share of it upon my kind advocate, instead of protecting me. I had not,  while residing in the house of Dubourg, absolutely conducted myself like                 A clerk condemn'd his father's soul to cross,               Who penn'd a stanza when he should engross;--    but, to say truth, I had frequented the counting-house no more than I had  thought absolutely necessary to secure the good report of the Frenchman,  long a correspondent of our firm, to whom my father had trusted for  initiating me into the mysteries of commerce. In fact, my principal  attention had been dedicated to literature and manly exercises. My father  did not altogether discourage such acquirements, whether mental or  personal. He had too much good sense not to perceive, that they sate  gracefully upon every man, and he was sensible that they relieved and  dignified the character to which he wished me to aspire. But his chief  ambition was, that I should succeed not merely to his fortune, but to the  views and plans by which he imagined he could extend and perpetuate the  wealthy inheritance which he designed for me.    Love of his profession was the motive which he chose should be most  ostensible, when he urged me to tread the same path; but he had others  with which I only became acquainted at a later period. Impetuous in his  schemes, as well as skilful and daring, each new adventure, when  successful, became at once the incentive, and furnished the means, for  farther speculation. It seemed to be necessary to him, as to an ambitious  conqueror, to push on from achievement to achievement, without stopping  to secure, far less to enjoy, the acquisitions which he made. Accustomed  to see his whole fortune trembling in the scales of chance, and dexterous  at adopting expedients for casting the balance in his favour, his health  and spirits and activity seemed ever to increase with the animating  hazards on which he staked his wealth; and he resembled a sailor,  accustomed to brave the billows and the foe, whose confidence rises on  the eve of tempest or of battle. He was not, however, insensible to the  changes which increasing age or supervening malady might make in his own  constitution; and was anxious in good time to secure in me an assistant,  who might take the helm when his hand grew weary, and keep the vessel's  way according to his counsel and instruction. Paternal affection, as well  as the furtherance of his own plans, determined him to the same  conclusion. Your father, though his fortune was vested in the house, was  only a sleeping partner, as the commercial phrase goes; and Owen, whose  probity and skill in the details of arithmetic rendered his services  invaluable as a head clerk, was not possessed either of information or  talents sufficient to conduct the mysteries of the principal management.  If my father were suddenly summoned from life, what would become of the  world of schemes which he had formed, unless his son were moulded into a  commercial Hercules, fit to sustain the weight when relinquished by the  falling Atlas? and what would become of that son himself, if, a stranger  to business of this description, he found himself at once involved in the  labyrinth of mercantile concerns, without the clew of knowledge necessary  for his extraction? For all these reasons, avowed and secret, my father  was determined I should embrace his profession; and when he was  determined, the resolution of no man was more immovable. I, however, was  also a party to be consulted, and, with something of his own pertinacity,  I had formed a determination precisely contrary. It may, I hope, be some  palliative for the resistance which, on this occasion, I offered to my  father's wishes, that I did not fully understand upon what they were  founded, or how deeply his happiness was involved in them. Imagining  myself certain of a large succession in future, and ample maintenance in  the meanwhile, it never occurred to me that it might be necessary, in  order to secure these blessings, to submit to labour and limitations  unpleasant to my taste and temper. I only saw in my father's proposal for  my engaging in business, a desire that I should add to those heaps of  wealth which he had himself acquired; and imagining myself the best judge  of the path to my own happiness, I did not conceive that I should  increase that happiness by augmenting a fortune which I believed was  already sufficient, and more than sufficient, for every use, comfort, and  elegant enjoyment.    Accordingly, I am compelled to repeat, that my time at Bourdeaux had not  been spent as my father had proposed to himself. What he considered as  the chief end of my residence in that city, I had postponed for every  other, and would (had I dared) have neglected altogether. Dubourg, a  favoured and benefited correspondent of our mercantile house, was too  much of a shrewd politician to make such reports to the head of the firm  concerning his only child, as would excite the displeasure of both; and  he might also, as you will presently hear, have views of selfish  advantage in suffering me to neglect the purposes for which I was placed  under his charge. My conduct was regulated by the bounds of decency and  good order, and thus far he had no evil report to make, supposing him so  disposed; but, perhaps, the crafty Frenchman would have been equally  complaisant, had I been in the habit of indulging worse feelings than  those of indolence and aversion to mercantile business. As it was, while  I gave a decent portion of my time to the commercial studies he  recommended, he was by no means envious of the hours which I dedicated to  other and more classical attainments, nor did he ever find fault with me  for dwelling upon Corneille and Boileau, in preference to Postlethwayte  (supposing his folio to have then existed, and Monsieur Dubourg able to  have pronounced his name), or Savary, or any other writer on commercial  economy. He had picked up somewhere a convenient expression, with which  he rounded off every letter to his correspondent,--\"I was all,\" he said,  \"that a father could wish.\"    My father never quarrelled with a phrase, however frequently repeated,  provided it seemed to him distinct and expressive; and Addison himself  could not have found expressions so satisfactory to him as, \"Yours  received, and duly honoured the bills enclosed, as per margin.\"    Knowing, therefore, very well what he desired me to, be, Mr. Osbaldistone  made no doubt, from the frequent repetition of Dubourg's favourite  phrase, that I was the very thing he wished to see me; when, in an evil  hour, he received my letter, containing my eloquent and detailed apology  for declining a place in the firm, and a desk and stool in the corner of  the dark counting-house in Crane Alley, surmounting in height those of  Owen, and the other clerks, and only inferior to the tripod of my father  himself. All was wrong from that moment. Dubourg's reports became as  suspicious as if his bills had been noted for dishonour. I was summoned  home in all haste, and received in the manner I have already communicated  to you.            CHAPTER SECOND.         I begin shrewdly to suspect the young man of a terrible       taint--Poetry; with which idle disease if he be infected,       there's no hope of him in astate course. _Actum est_ of him       for a commonwealth's man, if he goto't in rhyme once.                                          Ben Jonson's _Bartholomew Fair._    My father had, generally speaking, his temper under complete  self-command, and his anger rarely indicated itself by words, except in  a sort of dry testy manner, to those who had displeased him. He never  used threats, or expressions of loud resentment. All was arranged with  him on system, and it was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7028"],[0,"The Clicking of Cuthbert (#20)"],[1,"was playing with  Alexander, and give him my moral support.    \"I shall need it,\" he said. \"I don't mind telling you I'm pretty  nervous. I wish I had had longer to get the stranglehold on that 'Are  You Your Own Master?' stuff. I can see, of course, that it is the real  tabasco from start to finish, and absolutely as mother makes it, but  the trouble is I've only had a few days to soak it into my system. It's  like trying to patch up a motor car with string. You never know when  the thing will break down. Heaven knows what will happen if I sink a  ball at the water-hole. And something seems to tell me I am going to do  it.\"    There was a silence for a moment.    \"Do you believe in dreams?\" asked Mitchell.    \"Believe in what?\"    \"Dreams.\"    \"What about them?\"    \"I said, 'Do you believe in dreams?' Because last night I dreamed that  I was playing in the final of the Open Championship, and I got into the  rough, and there was a cow there, and the cow looked at me in a sad  sort of way and said, 'Why don't you use the two-V grip instead of the  interlocking?' At the time it seemed an odd sort of thing to happen,  but I've been thinking it over and I wonder if there isn't something in  it. These things must be sent to us for a purpose.\"    \"You can't change your grip on the day of an important match.\"    \"I suppose not. The fact is, I'm a bit jumpy, or I wouldn't have  mentioned it. Oh, well! See you tomorrow at two.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The day was bright and sunny, but a tricky cross-wind was blowing when  I reached the club-house. Alexander Paterson was there, practising  swings on the first tee; and almost immediately Mitchell Holmes  arrived, accompanied by Millicent.    \"Perhaps,\" said Alexander, \"we had better be getting under way. Shall I  take the honour?\"    \"Certainly,\" said Mitchell.    Alexander teed up his ball.    Alexander Paterson has always been a careful rather than a dashing  player. It is his custom, a sort of ritual, to take two measured  practice-swings before addressing the ball, even on the putting-green.  When he does address the ball he shuffles his feet for a moment or two,  then pauses, and scans the horizon in a suspicious sort of way, as if  he had been expecting it to play some sort of a trick on him when he  was not looking. A careful inspection seems to convince him of the  horizon's _bona fides_, and he turns his attention to the ball  again. He shuffles his feet once more, then raises his club. He waggles  the club smartly over the ball three times, then lays it behind the  globule. At this point he suddenly peers at the horizon again, in the  apparent hope of catching it off its guard. This done, he raises his  club very slowly, brings it back very slowly till it almost touches the  ball, raises it again, brings it down again, raises it once more, and  brings it down for the third time. He then stands motionless, wrapped  in thought, like some Indian fakir contemplating the infinite. Then he  raises his club again and replaces it behind the ball. Finally he  quivers all over, swings very slowly back, and drives the ball for  about a hundred and fifty yards in a dead straight line.    It is a method of procedure which proves sometimes a little  exasperating to the highly strung, and I watched Mitchell's face  anxiously to see how he was taking his first introduction to it. The  unhappy lad had blenched visibly. He turned to me with the air of one  in pain.    \"Does he always do that?\" he whispered.    \"Always,\" I replied.    \"Then I'm done for! No human being could play golf against a one-ring  circus like that without blowing up!\"    I said nothing. It was, I feared, only too true. Well-poised as I am, I  had long since been compelled to give up playing with Alexander  Paterson, much as I esteemed him. It was a choice between that and  resigning from the Baptist Church.    At this moment Millicent spoke. There was an open book in her hand. I  recognized it as the life-work of Professor Rollitt.    \"Think on this doctrine,\" she said, in her soft, modulated voice, \"that  to be patient is a branch of justice, and that men sin without  intending it.\"    Mitchell nodded briefly, and walked to the tee with a firm step.    \"Before you drive, darling,\" said Millicent, \"remember this. Let no act  be done at haphazard, nor otherwise than according to the finished  rules that govern its kind.\"    The next moment Mitchell's ball was shooting through the air, to come  to rest two hundred yards down the course. It was a magnificent drive.  He had followed the counsel of Marcus Aurelius to the letter.    An admirable iron-shot put him in reasonable proximity to the pin, and  he holed out in one under bogey with one of the nicest putts I have  ever beheld. And when at the next hole, the dangerous water-hole, his  ball soared over the pond and lay safe, giving him bogey for the hole,  I began for the first time to breathe freely. Every golfer has his day,  and this was plainly Mitchell's. He was playing faultless golf. If he  could continue in this vein, his unfortunate failing would have no  chance to show itself.    The third hole is long and tricky. You drive over a ravine--or possibly  into it. In the latter event you breathe a prayer and call for your  niblick. But, once over the ravine, there is nothing to disturb the  equanimity. Bogey is five, and a good drive, followed by a  brassey-shot, will put you within easy mashie-distance of the green.    Mitchell cleared the ravine by a hundred and twenty yards. He strolled  back to me, and watched Alexander go through his ritual with an  indulgent smile. I knew just how he was feeling. Never does the world  seem so sweet and fair and the foibles of our fellow human beings so  little irritating as when we have just swatted the pill right on the  spot.    \"I can't see why he does it,\" said Mitchell, eyeing Alexander with a  toleration that almost amounted to affection. \"If I did all those  Swedish exercises before I drove, I should forget what I had come out  for and go home.\" Alexander concluded the movements, and landed a bare  three yards on the other side of the ravine. \"He's what you would call  a steady performer, isn't he? Never varies!\"    Mitchell won the hole comfortably. There was a jauntiness about his  stance on the fourth tee which made me a little uneasy. Over-confidence  at golf is almost as bad as timidity.    My apprehensions were justified. Mitchell topped his ball. It rolled  twenty yards into the rough, and nestled under a dock-leaf. His mouth  opened, then closed with a snap. He came over to where Millicent and I  were standing.    \"I didn't say it!\" he said. \"What on earth happened then?\"    \"Search men's governing principles,\" said Millicent, \"and consider the  wise, what they shun and what they cleave to.\"    \"Exactly,\" I said. \"You swayed your body.\"    \"And now I've got to go and look for that infernal ball.\"    \"Never mind, darling,\" said Millicent. \"Nothing has such power to  broaden the mind as the ability to investigate systematically and truly  all that comes under thy observation in life.\"    \"Besides,\" I said, \"you're three up.\"    \"I shan't be after this hole.\"    He was right. Alexander won it in five, one above bogey, and regained  the honour.    Mitchell was a trifle shaken. His play no longer had its first careless  vigour. He lost the next hole, halved the sixth, lost the short  seventh, and then, rallying, halved the eighth.    The ninth hole, like so many on our links, can be a perfectly simple  four, although the rolling nature of the green makes bogey always a  somewhat doubtful feat; but, on the other hand, if you foozle your  drive, you can easily achieve double figures. The tee is on the farther  side of the pond, beyond the bridge, where the water narrows almost to  the dimensions of a brook. You drive across this water and over a  tangle of trees and under-growth on the other bank. The distance to the  fairway cannot be more than sixty yards, for the hazard is purely a  mental one, and yet how many fair hopes have been wrecked there!    Alexander cleared the obstacles comfortably with his customary short,  straight drive, and Mitchell advanced to the tee.    I think the loss of the honour had been preying on his mind. He seemed  nervous. His up-swing was shaky, and he swayed back perceptibly. He  made a lunge at the ball, sliced it, and it struck a tree on the other  side of the water and fell in the long grass. We crossed the bridge to  look for it; and it was here that the effect of Professor Rollitt began  definitely to wane.    \"Why on earth don't they mow this darned stuff?\" demanded Mitchell,  querulously, as he beat about the grass with his niblick.    \"You have to have rough on a course,\" I ventured.    \"Whatever happens at all,\" said Millicent, \"happens as it should. Thou  wilt find this true if thou shouldst watch narrowly.\"    \"That's all very well,\" said Mitchell, watching narrowly in a clump of  weeds but seeming unconvinced. \"I believe the Greens Committee run this  bally club purely in the interests of the caddies. I believe they  encourage lost balls, and go halves with the little beasts when they  find them and sell them!\"    Millicent and I exchanged glances. There were tears in her eyes.    \"Oh, Mitchell! Remember Napoleon!\"    \"Napoleon! What's Napoleon got to do with it? Napoleon never was  expected to drive through a primeval forest. Besides, what did Napoleon  ever do? Where did Napoleon get off, swanking round as if he amounted  to something? Poor fish! All he ever did was to get hammered at  Waterloo!\"    Alexander rejoined us. He had walked on to where his ball lay.    \"Can't find it, eh? Nasty bit of rough, this!\"    \"No, I can't find it. But tomorrow some miserable, chinless,  half-witted reptile of a caddie with pop eyes and eight hundred and  thirty-seven pimples will find it, and will sell it to someone for  sixpence! No, it was"]]]
