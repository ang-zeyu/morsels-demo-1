Burdened with their heavy armor,  half consumed by mosquitoes which were so thick that they were scarcely  able to breathe, covered with mud and water, they at length stood before  the Iroquois fort. [70] It was a structure of logs laid one upon another,  braced and held together by posts coupled by withes, and of the usual  circular form. It offered a good protection in savage warfare. Even the  French arquebus discharged through the crevices did slow execution.    It was obvious to Champlain that, to ensure victory, the fort must be  demolished. Huge trees, severed at the base, falling upon it, did not break  it down. At length, directed by Champlain, the savages approached under  their shields, tore away the supporting posts, and thus made a breach, into  which rushed the infuriated besiegers, and in hot haste finished their  deadly work. Fifteen of the Iroquois were taken prisoners; a few plunged  into the river and were drowned; the rest perished by musket-shots,  arrow-wounds, the tomahawk, and the war-club. Of the allied savages three  were killed and fifty wounded. Champlain himself did not escape altogether  unharmed. An arrow, armed with a sharp point of stone, pierced his ear and  neck, which he drew out with his own hand. One of his companions received a  similar wound in the arm. The victors scalped the dead as usual,  ornamenting the prows of their canoes with the bleeding heads of their  enemies, while they severed one of the bodies into quarters, to eat, as  they alleged, in revenge.    The canoes of the savages and a French shallop having come to the scene of  this battle, all soon embarked and returned to the Island of St. Ignace.  Here the allies, joined by eighty Huron warriors who had arrived too late  to participate in the conflict, remained three days, celebrating their  victory by dancing, singing, and the administration of the usual punishment  upon their prisoners of war. This consisted in a variety of exquisite  tortures, similar to those inflicted the year before, after the victory on  Lake Champlain, horrible and sickening in all their features, and which  need not be spread upon these pages. From these tortures Champlain would  gladly have snatched the poor wretches, had it been in his power, but in  this matter the savages would brook no interference. There was a solitary  exception, however, in a fortunate young Iroquois who fell to him in the  division of prisoners. He was treated with great kindness, but it did not  overcome his excessive fear and distrust, and he soon sought an opportunity  and escaped to his home. [71]    When the celebration of the victory had been completed, the Indians  departed to their distant abodes. Champlain, however, before their  departure, very wisely entered into an agreement that they should receive  for the winter a young Frenchman who was anxious to learn their language,  and, in return, he was himself to take a young Huron, at their special  request, to pass the winter in France. This judicious arrangement, in which  Champlain was deeply interested and which he found some difficulty in  accomplishing, promised an important future advantage in extending the  knowledge of both parties, and in strengthening on the foundation of  personal experience their mutual confidence and friendship.    After the departure of the Indians, Champlain returned to Quebec, and  proceeded to put the buildings in repair and to see that all necessary  arrangements were made for the safety and comfort of the colony during the  next winter.    On the 4th of July, Des Marais, in charge of the vessel belonging to De  Monts and his company, which had been left behind and had been expected  soon to follow, arrived at Quebec, bringing the intelligence that a small  revolution had taken place in Brouage, the home of Champlain, that the  Protestants had been expelled, and an additional guard of soldiers had been  placed in the garrison. Des Marais also brought the startling news that  Henry IV. had been assassinated on the 14th of May. Champlain was  penetrated by this announcement with the deepest sorrow. He fully saw how  great a public calamity had fallen upon his country. France had lost, by an  ignominious blow, one of her ablest and wisest sovereigns, who had, by his  marvellous power, gradually united and compacted the great interests of the  nation, which had been shattered and torn by half a century of civil  conflicts and domestic feuds. It was also to him a personal loss. The king  had taken a special interest in his undertakings, had been his patron from  the time of his first voyage to New France in 1603, had sustained him by an  annual pension, and on many occasions had shown by word and deed that he  fully appreciated the great value of his explorations in his American  domains. It was difficult to see how a loss so great both to his country  and himself could be repaired. A cloud of doubt and uncertainty hung over  the future. The condition of the company, likewise, under whose auspices he  was acting, presented at this time no very encouraging features. The  returns from the fur-trade had been small, owing to the loss of the  monopoly which the company had formerly enjoyed, and the excessive  competition which free-trade had stimulated. Only a limited attention had  as yet been given to the cultivation of the soil. Garden vegetables had  been placed in cultivation, together with small fields of Indian corn,  wheat, rye, and barley. These attempts at agriculture were doubtless  experiments, while at the same time they were useful in supplementing the  stores needed for the colony's consumption.    Champlain's personal presence was not required at Quebec during the winter,  as no active enterprise could be carried forward in that inclement season,  and he decided, therefore, to return to France. The little colony now  consisted of sixteen men, which he placed in charge, during his absence, of  Sieur Du Parc. He accordingly left Tadoussac on the 13th of August, and  arrived at Honfleur in France on the 27th of September, 1610.    During the autumn of this year, while residing in Paris, Champlain became  attached to Helene Boulle, the daughter of Nicholas Boulle, secretary of  the king's chamber. She was at that time a mere child, and of too tender  years to act for herself, particularly in matters of so great importance as  those which relate to marital relations. However, agreeably to a custom not  infrequent at that period, a marriage contract [72] was entered into on the  27th of December with her parents, in which, nevertheless, it was  stipulated that the nuptials should not take place within at least two  years from that date. The dowry of the future bride was fixed at six  thousand livres _tournois_, three fourths of which were paid and receipted  for by Champlain two days after the signing of the contract. The marriage  was afterward consummated, and Helen Boulle, as his wife, accompanied  Champlain to Quebec, in 1620, as we shall see in the sequel.    Notwithstanding the discouragements of the preceding year and the small  prospect of future success, De Monts and the merchants associated with him  still persevered in sending another expedition, and Champlain left Honfleur  for New France on the first day of March, 1611. Unfortunately, the voyage  had been undertaken too early in the season for these northern waters, and  long before they reached the Grand Banks, they encountered ice-floes of the  most dangerous character. Huge blocks of crystal, towering two hundred feet  above the surface of the water, floated at times near them, and at others  they were surrounded and hemmed in by vast fields of ice extending as far  as the eye could reach. Amid these ceaseless perils, momentarily expecting  to be crushed between the floating islands wheeling to and fro about them,  they struggled with the elements for nearly two months, when finally they  reached Tadoussac on the 13th of May.

She denied most positively  that it was so, but she immediately took measures to communicate the  conversation to Charles. The result of their consultations, and of  their inquiries about the character of Pope for prudence and fidelity,  was to admit him to their confidence, and endeavor to secure his aid.  He was faithful in keeping the secret, and he rendered the king  afterward a great deal of very efficient aid.    There was a certain Colonel Wyndham, whose name has become immortalized  by his connection with the king's escape, who lived at a place called  Trent, not far from the southern coast of England. After much  deliberation and many inquiries, it was decided that the king should  proceed there while arrangements should be made for his embarkation.  When this plan was formed, Mrs. Lane received a pretended letter from  home, saying that her father was taken suddenly and dangerously sick,  and urging her immediate return. They set out accordingly, William  having so far recovered from his fever as to be able to travel again!    During all this time, Lord Wilmot, who has already been mentioned as  a fellow fugitive with Charles from the battle of Worcester, had  followed the party of the king in his progress through the country,  under various disguises, and by different modes of travel, keeping  near his royal master all the way, and obtaining stolen interviews  with him, from time to time, for consultation. In this way each rendered  the other very essential aid. The two friends arrived at last at Colonel  Wyndham's together. Mrs. Lane and her party here took leave of the  king, and returned northward toward her home.    Colonel Wyndham was a personal acquaintance of the king. He had been  an officer under Charles I., in the civil wars preceding that monarch's  captivity and death, and Charles, who, as Prince of Wales, had made  a campaign as will be recollected, in the west of England before he  went to France, had had frequent intercourse with Wyndham, and bad  great confidence in his fidelity. The colonel had been at last shut  up in a castle, and had finally surrendered on such conditions as  secured his own liberty and safety. He had, consequently, since been  allowed to live quietly at his own estate in Trent, though he was  watched and suspected by the government as a known friend of the king's.  Charles had, of course, great confidence in him. He was very cordially  received into his house, and very securely secreted there.    It would be dangerous for Wyndham himself to do any thing openly in  respect to finding a vessel to convey the king to France. He accordingly  engaged a trusty friend to go down to the sea-port on the coast which  was nearest to his residence, and see what he could do. This sea-port  was Lyme, or Lyme-Regis, as it is sometimes called. It was about  twenty-five miles from Trent, where Wyndham resided, toward the  southwest, and about the same distance to the eastward of Exeter, where  Charles's mother had some years before sought refuge from her husband's  enemies.    Colonel Wyndham's messenger went to Lyme. He found there, pretty soon,  the master of a small vessel, which was accustomed to ply back and  forth to one of the ports on the coast of France, to carry merchandise.  The messenger, after making inquiries, and finding that the captain,  if captain he may be called, was the right sort of man for such an  enterprise, obtained an interview with him and introduced conversation  by asking when he expected to go back to France. The captain replied  that it would probably be some time before he should be able to make  up another cargo. \"How should you like to take some passengers?\" said  the messenger. \"Passengers?\" inquired the captain. \"Yes,\" rejoined the  other; \"there are two gentlemen here who wish to cross the Channel  privately, and they are willing to pay fifty pounds to be landed at  any port on the other side. Will you take them?\"    The captain perceived that it was a serious business. There was a  proclamation out, offering a reward for the apprehension of the king,  or Charles Stuart as they called him, and also for other of the leaders  at the battle of Worcester. All persons, too, were strictly prohibited  from taking any one across the Channel; and to conceal the king, or  to connive in any way at his escape, was death. The captain, however,  at length agreed to the proposal, influenced as the colonel's messenger  supposed, partly by the amount of his pay, and partly by his interest  in the Royal cause. He agreed to make his little vessel ready without  delay.    They did not think it prudent for the king to attempt to embark at  Lyme, but there was, a few miles to the eastward of it, along the  shore, a small village named Charmouth, where there was a creek jutting  up from the sea, and a little pier, sufficient for the landing of so  small a vessel as the one they had engaged. It was agreed that, on an  appointed day, the king and Lord Wilmot were to come down to Charmouth,  and take up their lodgings at the inn; that in the night the captain  was to sail out of the port of Lyme, in the most private manner  possible, and come to Charmouth; and that the king and Wilmot, who  would, in the mean time, be watching from the inn, when they saw the  light of the approaching vessel, should come down to the pier and  embark, and the captain then immediately sail away.    The messenger accordingly went back to Colonel Wyndham's with  intelligence of the plan that he had formed, while the captain of the  vessel went to work as privately as possible to lay in his stores and  make his other preparations for sea. He did this with the utmost  precaution and secrecy, and succeeded in deceiving every body but his  wife. Wives have the opportunity to perceive indications of the  concealed existence of matters of moment and weight which others do  not enjoy, in studying the countenances of their husbands. A man can  easily, through the day, when surrounded by the world, assume an  unconcerned and careless air, though oppressed with a very considerable  mental burden; but when he comes home at night, he instinctively throws  off half his disguise, and conjugal watchfulness and solicitude easily  penetrate the remainder. At least it was so in this case. The captain's  dame perceived that her husband was thoughtful and absent minded. She  watched him. She observed some indications that he was making  preparations for sea. She asked him what it meant. He said he did not  know how soon he might have a cargo, and he wanted to be all ready in  season. His wife, however, was not satisfied. She watched him more  closely still, and when the appointed night came on which he had agreed  to sail, finding that it was impossible for him to elude her vigilance,  he told her plainly, that he was going across the Channel on private  business, but that he should immediately return.    She declared positively that he should not go. She knew, she said,  that the business was something which would end in ruining him and his  family, and she was determined that he should not risk her safety and  his own life in any such desperate and treasonable plans. She locked  the door upon him, and when he insisted on being released, she declared  that if he did attempt to go, she would immediately give warning to  the authorities, and have him arrested and confined. So the discomfited  captain was compelled to give up his design, and break his appointment  at the Charmouth pier.    In the mean time, the king and Lord Wilmot came down, as had been  agreed upon, to Charmouth, and put up, with many other travelers, at  the inn. There was great excitement all over that part of the country,  every one talking about the battle of Worcester, the escape of the  king, and especially about an expedition which Cromwell had been  organizing, which was then assembling on the southern coast. Its  destination was the island of Jersey, which had thus far adhered to  the Royalist cause, and which Cromwell was now intending to reduce to  subjection to him. The bustle and movement which all these causes  combined to create, made the king and Lord Wilmot very anxious and  uneasy. There were assemblies convened in the villages which they  passed through, and men were haranguing the populace on the victories  which had been gained, and on the future measures to be pursued. In  one place the bells were ringing, and bonfires were burning in  celebration of the death of the king, it being rumored and believed  that he had been shot.    Our two fugitives, however, arrived safely at the inn, put up their  horses, and began to watch anxiously for the light of the approaching  vessel. They watched, of course, in vain. Midnight came, but no vessel.  They waited hour after hour, till at last morning dawned, and they  found that all hope of accomplishing their enterprise must be abandoned.  They could not remain where they were, however, another day, without  suspicion; so they prepared to move on and seek temporary refuge in  some other neighboring town, while they could send one of the attendants  who came with them back to Colonel Wyndham's, to see if he could  ascertain the cause of the failure. One or two days were spent in  inquiries, negotiations, and delays. The result was, that all hope of  embarking at Lyme had to be abandoned, and it was concluded that the  fugitives should proceed on to the eastward, along the coast, to the  care of another Royalist, a certain Colonel Gunter, who might perhaps  find means to send them away from some port in that part of the country.  At any rate, they would, by this plan, escape the excitements and  dangers which seemed to environ them in the neighborhood of Lyme.    It was fortunate that they went away from Charmouth when they did; by  doing so they narrowly escaped apprehension; for that night, while the  king's horse was in the stable,"]]]
