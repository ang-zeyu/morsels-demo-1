A small platter, containing two or three  slices of \"frizzled\" pork, was placed by the old man's plate.    Meanwhile, the starry flakes came faster and faster. Some of the more  adventurous alighted on the kitchen window and gazed in until they  were finally melted at the sight. A few ventured down into the well,  and, drifting against the mossy stones, gave to the slender ferns that  peeped from the chinks the food they had gathered in the skies; others  found their way through a broad crack into the barn and fell  noiselessly upon the floor with its hayseed carpet, thereupon causing  much wonderment and grave discussion among the fowls, who were  exchanging views in low tones on the topics of the morning. If you had  been in the woods, you would have heard the tick-ticking of the tiny  crystals, like the dancing of myriads of fairy feet, upon the dry  leaves which still clung to the oak and beech.    So fell the snowflakes over meadow and fallow, wood and hill, bringing  the materials that should be built up into corn and wheat during the  coming year and thus provide food for thousands who would then be  reciting their prayers for daily bread, without a thought that the  answers had begun so many months before.    Now, either by a preconcerted plan or by an impulse of the moment, one  of the most daring of the advance guard of the storm resolved to have  a wild ride before he gave up his substance to winds and earth; and so  it came about that a chubby nose, which had previously been flattened  against one of the plate-glass windows of a Pullman car on a  northbound train, suddenly withdrew itself, and a childish voice  exclaimed, \"Oh, Miss Amory, it's snowing! it's snowing! Here's a  little mite of a flake on the window. Oh, mamma, won't it be nice  sleighing for Santa Claus! He can come right on the tops of the trees:  I saw a lot that looked just like frosted cake.\"    \"Yes, dear; yes, dear,\" said the quiet lady in the next chair,  glancing up from her \"Seaside\" pamphlet. \"Only don't speak so loud,  Maurice. You will disturb the other people in the car.\"    \"Miss Amory,\" persisted the boy, but in lower tones, \"won't you go out  and coast with me, and take a great, long, long sleigh-ride  to-morrow?\"    \"Yes, Maurice, if mamma would like me to,\" replied the one addressed,  a little wearily. She had not yet quite schooled herself to her  position, this young governess, and the constant reference of even  such trifles as the boy's request to a higher authority still jarred  on her spirits. She had not, indeed, like most paper heroines, been  accustomed to the luxuries of wealth, with phalanxes of servants  devoting themselves exclusively to her service and amusement, but she  had enjoyed the comforts of a well-to-do New England home, the  independence of American girlhood, and the priceless blessing of a  mother who understood her thoroughly and was always ready to  sympathize with her daughter's pleasures and troubles alike, to  counsel or remain silent, as the case might be, and to help her out  of all her girlish perplexities, from the choice of a ribbon to the  treatment of an importunate suitor. It was a brave thing, this setting  her face resolutely to the world, and she had accordingly made up her  mind at the start to look for and meet every unpleasant concomitant to  her new position without a murmur.    At first she had been uncertain at what door she should knock of all  those opening into the tower named Self-Support, but, as she  approached, one of them flew open before her hand was raised. A lady  who was spending the summer near by gave out word that she wished for  a governess to take charge of her two children and accompany them to  the city in the autumn. Miss Amory's bright face and gentle ways won  the children at first sight. She was retained on trial, and had proved  too great a treasure to be relinquished.    Mrs. Walton had been more than kind and considerate, but her very  effort to offer attentions and induce the new governess to forget her  position only made it more marked, like an erasure upon white paper.    Miss Amory scolded herself twenty times a day, and devoted herself  more and more to her duties, but still she could not help looking  forward to next summer, when--when--well, beyond that it was all  vague. At any rate, there might be some change for the better. Perhaps  she could give music-lessons, or could teach school; something she  would do where she was her own mistress.    The train rumbled on, and the storm increased. Twice they had to stop  and back before they could push their way through a narrow cut where  the huge drifts were wedged in solidly from brim to brim. At last,  just as the December light was fading from the sky, hurried by the  whirling snow-mist, the cars came to a standstill beside a long, low  building, and the conductor shouted, \"Haybrook! Haybrook!\"    Ten minutes later, two sleighs, one in advance loaded with boxes and  parcels, the other with the ladies and the two children, crept slowly  up the hill that led from the little brown station to the main road.  For a while the houses on each side and a few half-obliterated tracks  made navigation comparatively easy; but once out of the village it  became a matter of nice calculation. The sleet stung the faces of the  drivers and formed little icy crusts over the eyes of the patient  horses, who struggled on, setting their hoofs down firmly into the  smooth, unbroken sheet of snow and sending it out on either side like  foam. Suddenly there was a creak, a lurch, and then a dead stop. The  drivers consulted in muffled tones as they examined the harness.    \"Broken jest above the buckle; nothing to hitch to.\"    \"Better call up the old man, 'n' get Wesley to help. 'S only a step  further 'n the Corner.\"    In the sleigh, Mrs. Walton and her governess, covered with heavy  buffalo-robes, waited patiently. The children fidgeted.    \"I want to get out and wade.\"    \"No, Morrie, you just keep still, and perhaps Santa Claus will come  along and help us. He must have started by this time.\"    \"H'm! guess reindeers wouldn't do much good. I wish I had my pony  here. Why, Miss Amory, how cold your hand is! Why, you've been keeping  that robe over me, and you're right out in the cold. See the snow on  her sleeve, mamma.\"    \"Oh, I don't mind,\" interposed the little governess; but her teeth  chattered, and it was an intense relief when she heard a new, strong  voice just outside: \"Where are they, Marston? In that heap of  buffaloes?\" After a moment's pause, the robes were lifted, and before  she could say a word the girl felt herself raised from the sleigh and  borne along through the storm in a pair of stout arms, while the same  cheery voice said: \"Beg your pardon, miss, it's the only way. The  house is but a few rods from here.\"    \"Thank you,\" she answered smiling, in spite of the cold, at her  situation: \"but I'm afraid I shall tire you!\"    The young man said nothing, but gravely picked his way between drifts  and treacherous hollows. Once he staggered, and nearly fell with his  burden. She instinctively threw her arm round his neck like a child,  to save herself, withdrawing it quietly a moment after. He plodded on  in silence.    \"He's a gentleman,\" she thought, \"or he would have laughed or joked  about it.\"    Close behind them the men were following with those left in the  sleigh, and the whole company were soon gathered around 'Lisbeth's  fire, exchanging comments, throwing aside their snowy wraps, and  refreshing themselves with hot tea.    \"Just like a desert island,\" whispered Maurice.    \"Only savages don't have doughnuts and milk,\" returned Edie, helping  herself liberally.    The fire leaped higher and glowed more and more ardently in its  efforts to warm the castaways, until they were glad to draw back their  chairs from the hearth,--all except the little governess, who was  still chilled through and through, although she meekly drank three  cups of hot tea in succession, and crouched as near the friendly fire  as she could without scorching the pretty dark-blue traveling dress.  Little ripples of shiver seemed to run over her from head to foot,  like a cold breeze.    \"I think, if you please, I'll go to my room,\" she said at last, with a  grateful look at 'Lisbeth, who was watching her anxiously, and who  doubtless supposed her to be a relative, probably the children's aunt.  \"Governess\" was an idea that had not struck Haybrook, except through  the medium of an old English novel or two.    \"Well, just step right in here,\" she said, sympathetically; \"and don't  you get up till ye're called in the mornin'.\"    As she spoke she opened one of the little, gray, uneven doors behind  her guests, and lighting a tallow candle in a knobby brass  candlestick, placed it upon some article of furniture within.    \"Good-night,\" she said again, kindly. \"Don't let me disturb ye by my  travelin' round the kitchen gettin' breakfast. You can leave the door  open a crack for company, if you're lonesome.\"      II    When Florence Amory opened her eyes the next morning, she was at a  loss for some minutes to determine her own position in the great white  world that lay around her. Then the events of the preceding night  marshaled themselves into line one by one, and at the same time came  the consciousness that she possessed a head,--a most unmanageable one,  too. It danced and whirled in such an uncomfortable way that she was  glad to shut her eyes once more.    Presently the sound of an old-fashioned coffee-mill, with its  unwilling halts and sudden compliances, fell upon her ear in such  close proximity that there was no mistaking the character of the  adjoining room. A moment or two later the crushed berries sent through  the keyhole a delicious whiff"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4320"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (#20)"],[1,"of ethics, left by  nature to baffle all the pride of philosophy, and make her sensible of  her narrow boundaries and slender acquisitions.    We approve of another, because of his wit, politeness, modesty, decency,  or any agreeable quality which he possesses; although he be not of our  acquaintance, nor has ever given us any entertainment, by means of  these accomplishments. The idea, which we form of their effect on his  acquaintance, has an agreeable influence on our imagination, and gives  us the sentiment of approbation. This principle enters into all the  judgements which we form concerning manners and characters.          SECTION IX. CONCLUSION.        PART I.        IT may justly appear surprising that any man in so late an age, should  find it requisite to prove, by elaborate reasoning, that Personal Merit  consists altogether in the possession of mental qualities, USEFUL or  AGREEABLE to the PERSON HIMSELF or to OTHERS. It might be expected that  this principle would have occurred even to the first rude, unpractised  enquirers concerning morals, and been received from its own evidence,  without any argument or disputation. Whatever is valuable in any kind,  so naturally classes itself under the division of USEFUL or AGREEABLE,  the UTILE or the DULCE, that it is not easy to imagine why we should  ever seek further, or consider the question as a matter of nice research  or inquiry. And as every thing useful or agreeable must possess these  qualities with regard either to the PERSON HIMSELF or to OTHERS, the  complete delineation or description of merit seems to be performed as  naturally as a shadow is cast by the sun, or an image is reflected upon  water. If the ground, on which the shadow is cast, be not broken and  uneven; nor the surface from which the image is reflected, disturbed  and confused; a just figure is immediately presented, without any art  or attention. And it seems a reasonable presumption, that systems and  hypotheses have perverted our natural understanding, when a theory,  so simple and obvious, could so long have escaped the most elaborate  examination.    But however the case may have fared with philosophy, in common life  these principles are still implicitly maintained; nor is any other topic  of praise or blame ever recurred to, when we employ any panegyric or  satire, any applause or censure of human action and behaviour. If we  observe men, in every intercourse of business or pleasure, in every  discourse and conversation, we shall find them nowhere, except the  schools, at any loss upon this subject. What so natural, for instance,  as the following dialogue? You are very happy, we shall suppose one to  say, addressing himself to another, that you have given your daughter  to Cleanthes. He is a man of honour and humanity. Every one, who has  any intercourse with him, is sure of FAIR and KIND treatment. [Footnote:  Qualities useful to others.] I congratulate you too, says another,  on the promising expectations of this son-in-law; whose assiduous  application to the study of the laws, whose quick penetration and early  knowledge both of men and business, prognosticate the greatest honours  and advancement. [Footnote: Qualities useful to the person himself.]  You surprise me, replies a third, when you talk of Cleanthes as a man  of business and application. I met him lately in a circle of the gayest  company, and he was the very life and soul of our conversation: so much  wit with good manners; so much gallantry without affectation; so much  ingenious knowledge so genteelly delivered, I have never before observed  in any one. [Footnote: Qualities immediately agreeable to others,]  You would admire him still more, says a fourth, if you knew him more  familiarly. That cheerfulness, which you might remark in him, is not a  sudden flash struck out by company: it runs through the whole tenor of  his life, and preserves a perpetual serenity on his countenance, and  tranquillity in his soul. He has met with severe trials, misfortunes as  well as dangers; and by his greatness of mind, was still superior to  all of them [Footnote: Qualities immediately agreeable to the person  himself]. The image, gentlemen, which you have here delineated of  Cleanthes, cried I, is that of accomplished merit. Each of you has given  a stroke of the pencil to his figure; and you have unawares exceeded all  the pictures drawn by Gratian or Castiglione. A philosopher might select  this character as a model of perfect virtue.    And as every quality which is useful or agreeable to ourselves or others  is, in common life, allowed to be a part of personal merit; so no other  will ever be received, where men judge of things by their natural,  unprejudiced reason, without the delusive glosses of superstition and  false religion. Celibacy, fasting, penance, mortification, self-denial,  humility, silence, solitude, and the whole train of monkish virtues; for  what reason are they everywhere rejected by men of sense, but because  they serve to no manner of purpose; neither advance a man's fortune in  the world, nor render him a more valuable member of society; neither  qualify him for the entertainment of company, nor increase his power of  self-enjoyment? We observe, on the contrary, that they cross all these  desirable ends; stupify the understanding and harden the heart, obscure  the fancy and sour the temper. We justly, therefore, transfer them to  the opposite column, and place them in the catalogue of vices; nor has  any superstition force sufficient among men of the world, to pervert  entirely these natural sentiments. A gloomy, hair-brained enthusiast,  after his death, may have a place in the calendar; but will scarcely  ever be admitted, when alive, into intimacy and society, except by those  who are as delirious and dismal as himself.    It seems a happiness in the present theory, that it enters not into that  vulgar dispute concerning the DEGREES of benevolence or self-love, which  prevail in human nature; a dispute which is never likely to have any  issue, both because men, who have taken part, are not easily convinced,  and because the phenomena, which can be produced on either side, are so  dispersed, so uncertain, and subject to so many interpretations, that it  is scarcely possible accurately to compare them, or draw from them any  determinate inference or conclusion. It is sufficient for our present  purpose, if it be allowed, what surely, without the greatest absurdity  cannot be disputed, that there is some benevolence, however small,  infused into our bosom; some spark of friendship for human kind; some  particle of the dove kneaded into our frame, along with the elements of  the wolf and serpent. Let these generous sentiments be supposed ever  so weak; let them be insufficient to move even a hand or finger of our  body, they must still direct the determinations of our mind, and where  everything else is equal, produce a cool preference of what is useful  and serviceable to mankind, above what is pernicious and dangerous. A  MORAL DISTINCTION, therefore, immediately arises; a general sentiment of  blame and approbation; a tendency, however faint, to the objects of the  one, and a proportionable aversion to those of the other. Nor will those  reasoners, who so earnestly maintain the predominant selfishness of  human kind, be any wise scandalized at hearing of the weak sentiments of  virtue implanted in our nature. On the contrary, they are found as ready  to maintain the one tenet as the other; and their spirit of satire (for  such it appears, rather than of corruption) naturally gives rise to  both opinions; which have, indeed, a great and almost an indissoluble  connexion together.    Avarice, ambition, vanity, and all passions vulgarly, though improperly,  comprised under the denomination of SELF-LOVE, are here excluded from  our theory concerning the origin of morals, not because they are too  weak, but because they have not a proper direction for that purpose.  The notion of morals implies some sentiment common to all mankind, which  recommends the same object to general approbation, and makes every man,  or most men, agree in the same opinion or decision concerning it. It  also implies some sentiment, so universal and comprehensive as to extend  to all mankind, and render the actions and conduct, even of the persons  the most remote, an object of applause or censure, according as they  agree or disagree with that rule of right which is established. These  two requisite circumstances belong alone to the sentiment of humanity  here insisted on. The other passions produce in every breast, many  strong sentiments of desire and aversion, affection and hatred; but  these neither are felt so much in common, nor are so comprehensive, as  to be the foundation of any general system and established theory of  blame or approbation.    When a man denominates another his ENEMY, his RIVAL, his ANTAGONIST, his  ADVERSARY, he is understood to speak the language of self-love, and to  express sentiments, peculiar to himself, and arising from his particular  circumstances and situation. But when he bestows on any man the epithets  of VICIOUS or ODIOUS or DEPRAVED, he then speaks another language, and  expresses sentiments, in which he expects all his audience are to  concur with him. He must here, therefore, depart from his private and  particular situation, and must choose a point of view, common to him  with others; he must move some universal principle of the human frame,  and touch a string to which all mankind have an accord and symphony. If  he mean, therefore, to express that this man possesses qualities, whose  tendency is pernicious to society, he has chosen this common point of  view, and has touched the principle of humanity, in which every man, in  some degree, concurs. While the human heart is compounded of the same  elements as at present, it will never be wholly indifferent to"]]]
