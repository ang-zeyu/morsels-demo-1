Here were five hundred citizens, nearly all  white, at the mercy of their former slaves. To some of these whites it  was the last crowning humiliation, and they were, or professed to be,  in perpetual fear. On the other hand, the most intelligent and lady-like  woman I saw, the wife of a Rebel captain, rather surprised me by saying  that it seemed pleasanter to have these men stationed there, whom they  had known all their lives, and who had generally borne a good character,  than to be in the power of entire strangers. Certainly the men deserved  the confidence, for there was scarcely an exception to their good  behavior. I think they thoroughly felt that their honor and dignity were  concerned in the matter, and took too much pride in their character  as soldiers,--to say nothing of higher motives,--to tarnish it by any  misdeeds. They watched their officers vigilantly and even suspiciously,  to detect any disposition towards compromise; and so long as we pursued  a just course it was evident that they could be relied on. Yet the  spot was pointed out to me where two of our leading men had seen their  brothers hanged by Lynch law; many of them had private wrongs to avenge;  and they all had utter disbelief in all pretended loyalty, especially on  the part of the women.    One citizen alone was brought to me in a sort of escort of honor by  Corporal Prince Lambkin,--one of the color-guard, and one of our ablest  men,--the same who had once made a speech in camp, reminding his hearers  that they had lived under the American flag for eighteen hundred and  sixty-two years, and ought to live and die under it. Corporal Lambkin  now introduced his man, a German, with the highest compliment in his  power, \"He hab true colored-man heart.\" Surrounded by mean, cajoling,  insinuating white men and women who were all that and worse, I was quite  ready to appreciate the quality he thus proclaimed. A colored-man heart,  in the Rebel States, is a fair synonyme for a loyal heart, and it is  about the only such synonyme. In this case, I found afterwards that the  man in question, a small grocer, had been an object of suspicion to the  whites from his readiness to lend money to the negroes, or sell to  them on credit; in which, perhaps, there may have been some mixture of  self-interest with benevolence.    I resort to a note-book of that period, well thumbed and pocket-worn,  which sometimes received a fragment of the day's experience.      \"March 16, 1863.    \"Of course, droll things are constantly occurring. Every white  man, woman, and child is flattering, seductive, and professes Union  sentiment; every black ditto believes that every white ditto is a  scoundrel, and ought to be shot, but for good order and military  discipline. The Provost Marshal and I steer between them as blandly as  we can. Such scenes as succeed each other! Rush of indignant Africans.  A white man, in woman's clothes, has been seen to enter a certain  house,--undoubtedly a spy. Further evidence discloses the Roman  Catholic priest, a peaceful little Frenchman, in his professional  apparel.--Anxious female enters. Some sentinel has shot her cow by  mistake for a Rebel. The United States cannot think of paying the  desired thirty dollars. Let her go to the Post-Quartermaster and select  a cow from his herd. If there is none to suit her (and, indeed, not one  of them gave a drop of milk,--neither did hers), let her wait till  the next lot comes in,--that is all.--Yesterday's operations gave the  following total yield: Thirty 'contrabands,' eighteen horses, eleven  cattle, ten saddles and bridles, and one new army-wagon. At this rate we  shall soon be self-supporting _cavalry_.    \"Where complaints are made of the soldiers, it almost always turns out  that the women have insulted them most grossly, swearing at them, and  the like. One unpleasant old Dutch woman came in, bursting with wrath,  and told the whole narrative of her blameless life, diversified with  sobs:--    \"'Last January I ran off two of my black people from St. Mary's to  Fernandina,' (sob,)--'then I moved down there myself, and at Lake City I  lost six women and a boy,' (sob,)--'then I stopped at Baldwin for one  of the wenches to be confined,' (sob,)--'then I brought them all here  to live in a Christian country' (sob, sob). \"Then the blockheads'  [blockades, that is, gunboats] 'came, and they all ran off with the  blockheads,' (sob, sob, sob,) 'and left me, an old lady of forty-six,  obliged to work for a living.' (Chaos of sobs, without cessation.)    \"But when I found what the old sinner had said to the soldiers I rather  wondered at their self-control in not throttling her.\"    Meanwhile skirmishing went on daily in the outskirts of the town.  There was a fight on the very first day, when our men killed, as before  hinted, a Rebel surgeon, which was oddly metamorphosed in the Southern  newspapers into their killing one of ours, which certainly never  happened. Every day, after this, they appeared in small mounted squads  in the neighborhood, and exchanged shots with our pickets, to which the  gunboats would contribute their louder share, their aim being rather  embarrassed by the woods and hills. We made reconnoissances, too, to  learn the country in different directions, and were apt to be fired upon  during these. Along the farther side of what we called the \"Debatable  Land\" there was a line of cottages, hardly superior to negro huts,  and almost all empty, where the Rebel pickets resorted, and from whose  windows they fired. By degrees all these nests were broken up and  destroyed, though it cost some trouble to do it, and the hottest  skirmishing usually took place around them.    Among these little affairs was one which we called \"Company K's  Skirmish,\" because it brought out the fact that this company, which was  composed entirely of South Carolina men, and had never shone in drill  or discipline, stood near the head of the regiment for coolness and  courage,--the defect of discipline showing itself only in their extreme  unwillingness to halt when once let loose. It was at this time that the  small comedy of the Goose occurred,--an anecdote which Wendell Phillips  has since made his own.    One of the advancing line of skirmishers, usually an active fellow  enough, was observed to move clumsily and irregularly. It soon appeared  that he had encountered a fine specimen of the domestic goose, which had  surrendered at discretion. Not wishing to lose it, he could yet find no  way to hold it but between his legs; and so he went on, loading, firing,  advancing, halting, always with the goose writhing and struggling and  hissing in this natural pair of stocks. Both happily came off unwounded,  and retired in good order at the signal, or some time after it; but I  have hardly a cooler thing to put on record.    Meanwhile, another fellow left the field less exultingly; for, after a  thoroughly courageous share in the skirmish, he came blubbering to his  captain, and said,--\"Cappen, make Caesar gib me my cane.\" It seemed  that, during some interval of the fighting, he had helped himself to an  armful of Rebel sugar-cane, such as they all delighted in chewing. The  Roman hero, during another pause, had confiscated the treasure; whence  these tears of the returning warrior. I never could accustom myself to  these extraordinary interminglings of manly and childish attributes.    Our most untiring scout during this period was the chaplain of my  regiment,--the most restless and daring spirit we had, and now exulting  in full liberty of action. He it was who was daily permitted to  stray singly where no other officer would have been allowed to go, so  irresistible was his appeal, \"You know I am only a chaplain.\" Methinks I  see our regimental saint, with pistols in belt and a Ballard rifle slung  on shoulder, putting spurs to his steed, and cantering away down some  questionable wood-path, or returning with some tale of Rebel haunt  discovered, or store of foraging. He would track an enemy like an  Indian, or exhort him, when apprehended, like an early Christian. Some  of our devout soldiers shook their heads sometimes over the chaplain's  little eccentricities. \"Woffor Mr. Chapman made a preacher for?\" said  one of them, as usual transforming his title into a patronymic. \"He's  _de fightingest more Yankee_ I eber see in all my days.\"    And the criticism was very natural, though they could not deny that,  when the hour for Sunday service came, Mr. F. commanded the respect and  attention of all. That hour never came, however, on our first Sunday  in Jacksonville; we were too busy and the men too scattered; so the  chaplain made his accustomed foray beyond the lines instead.    \"Is it not Sunday?\" slyly asked an unregenerate lieutenant. \"Nay,\" quoth  his Reverence, waxing fervid; \"it is the Day of Judgment\"    This reminds me of a raid up the river, conducted by one of our senior  captains, an enthusiast whose gray beard and prophetic manner always  took me back to the Fifth-Monarchy men. He was most successful that day,  bringing back horses, cattle, provisions, and prisoners; and one of the  latter complained bitterly to me of being held, stating that Captain R.  had promised him speedy liberty. But that doughty official spurned  the imputation of such weak blandishments, in this day of triumphant  retribution.    \"Promise him!\" said he, \"I promised him nothing but the Day of Judgment  and Periods of Damnation!\"    Often since have I rolled beneath my tongue this savory and solemn  sentence, and I do not believe that since the days of the Long  Parliament there has been a more resounding anathema.    In Colonel Montgomery's hands these up-river raids reached the dignity  of a fine art. His conceptions of foraging were rather more Western and  liberal than mine, and on these excursions he fully indemnified himself  for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/677"],[0,"The Heroes; Or, Greek Fairy Tales for My Children (#20)"],[1,"are all good men and true,  and all we ask is food and water;' but the giant cried the more--    'You are robbers, you are pirates all; I know you; and if you land, you  shall die the death.'    Then he waved his arms again as a signal, and they saw the people flying  inland, driving their flocks before them, while a great flame arose among  the hills.  Then the giant ran up a valley and vanished, and the heroes  lay on their oars in fear.    But Medeia stood watching all from under her steep black brows, with a  cunning smile upon her lips, and a cunning plot within her heart.  At  last she spoke, 'I know this giant.  I heard of him in the East.  Hephaistos the Fire King made him in his forge in AEtna beneath the  earth, and called him Talus, and gave him to Minos for a servant, to  guard the coast of Crete.  Thrice a day he walks round the island, and  never stops to sleep; and if strangers land he leaps into his furnace,  which flames there among the hills; and when he is red-hot he rushes on  them, and burns them in his brazen hands.'    Then all the heroes cried, 'What shall we do, wise Medeia?  We must have  water, or we die of thirst.  Flesh and blood we can face fairly; but who  can face this red-hot brass?'    'I can face red-hot brass, if the tale I hear be true.  For they say that  he has but one vein in all his body, filled with liquid fire; and that  this vein is closed with a nail: but I know not where that nail is  placed.  But if I can get it once into these hands, you shall water your  ship here in peace.'    Then she bade them put her on shore, and row off again, and wait what  would befall.    And the heroes obeyed her unwillingly, for they were ashamed to leave her  so alone; but Jason said, 'She is dearer to me than to any of you, yet I  will trust her freely on shore; she has more plots than we can dream of  in the windings of that fair and cunning head.'    So they left the witch-maiden on the shore; and she stood there in her  beauty all alone, till the giant strode back red-hot from head to heel,  while the grass hissed and smoked beneath his tread.    And when he saw the maiden alone, he stopped; and she looked boldly up  into his face without moving, and began her magic song:--    'Life is short, though life is sweet; and even men of brass and fire must  die.  The brass must rust, the fire must cool, for time gnaws all things  in their turn.  Life is short, though life is sweet: but sweeter to live  for ever; sweeter to live ever youthful like the Gods, who have ichor in  their veins--ichor which gives life, and youth, and joy, and a bounding  heart.'    Then Talus said, 'Who are you, strange maiden, and where is this ichor of  youth?'    Then Medeia held up a flask of crystal, and said, 'Here is the ichor of  youth.  I am Medeia the enchantress; my sister Circe gave me this, and  said, \"Go and reward Talus, the faithful servant, for his fame is gone  out into all lands.\"  So come, and I will pour this into your veins, that  you may live for ever young.'    And he listened to her false words, that simple Talus, and came near; and  Medeia said, 'Dip yourself in the sea first, and cool yourself, lest you  burn my tender hands; then show me where the nail in your vein is, that I  may pour the ichor in.'    Then that simple Talus dipped himself in the sea, till it hissed, and  roared, and smoked; and came and knelt before Medeia, and showed her the  secret nail.    And she drew the nail out gently, but she poured no ichor in; and instead  the liquid fire spouted forth, like a stream of red-hot iron.  And Talus  tried to leap up, crying, 'You have betrayed me, false witch-maiden!'  But she lifted up her hands before him, and sang, till he sank beneath  her spell.  And as he sank, his brazen limbs clanked heavily, and the  earth groaned beneath his weight; and the liquid fire ran from his heel,  like a stream of lava, to the sea; and Medeia laughed, and called to the  heroes, 'Come ashore, and water your ship in peace.'    So they came, and found the giant lying dead; and they fell down, and  kissed Medeia's feet; and watered their ship, and took sheep and oxen,  and so left that inhospitable shore.    At last, after many more adventures, they came to the Cape of Malea, at  the south-west point of the Peloponnese.  And there they offered  sacrifices, and Orpheus purged them from their guilt.  Then they rode  away again to the northward, past the Laconian shore, and came all worn  and tired by Sunium, and up the long Euboean Strait, until they saw once  more Pelion, and Aphetai, and Iolcos by the sea.    And they ran the ship ashore; but they had no strength left to haul her  up the beach; and they crawled out on the pebbles, and sat down, and wept  till they could weep no more.  For the houses and the trees were all  altered; and all the faces which they saw were strange; and their joy was  swallowed up in sorrow, while they thought of their youth, and all their  labour, and the gallant comrades they had lost.    And the people crowded round, and asked them 'Who are you, that you sit  weeping here?'    'We are the sons of your princes, who sailed out many a year ago.  We  went to fetch the golden fleece, and we have brought it, and grief  therewith.  Give us news of our fathers and our mothers, if any of them  be left alive on earth.'    Then there was shouting, and laughing, and weeping; and all the kings  came to the shore, and they led away the heroes to their homes, and  bewailed the valiant dead.    Then Jason went up with Medeia to the palace of his uncle Pelias.  And  when he came in Pelias sat by the hearth, crippled and blind with age;  while opposite him sat AEson, Jason's father, crippled and blind  likewise; and the two old men's heads shook together as they tried to  warm themselves before the fire.    And Jason fell down at his father's knees, and wept, and called him by  his name.  And the old man stretched his hands out, and felt him, and  said, 'Do not mock me, young hero.  My son Jason is dead long ago at  sea.'    'I am your own son Jason, whom you trusted to the Centaur upon Pelion;  and I have brought home the golden fleece, and a princess of the Sun's  race for my bride.  So now give me up the kingdom, Pelias my uncle, and  fulfil your promise as I have fulfilled mine.'    Then his father clung to him like a child, and wept, and would not let  him go; and cried, 'Now I shall not go down lonely to my grave.  Promise  me never to leave me till I die.'        PART VI  WHAT WAS THE END OF THE HEROES      And now I wish that I could end my story pleasantly; but it is no fault  of mine that I cannot.  The old songs end it sadly, and I believe that  they are right and wise; for though the heroes were purified at Malea,  yet sacrifices cannot make bad hearts good, and Jason had taken a wicked  wife, and he had to bear his burden to the last.    And first she laid a cunning plot to punish that poor old Pelias, instead  of letting him die in peace.    For she told his daughters, 'I can make old things young again; I will  show you how easy it is to do.'  So she took an old ram and killed him,  and put him in a cauldron with magic herbs; and whispered her spells over  him, and he leapt out again a young lamb.  So that 'Medeia's cauldron' is  a proverb still, by which we mean times of war and change, when the world  has become old and feeble, and grows young again through bitter pains.    Then she said to Pelias' daughters, 'Do to your father as I did to this  ram, and he will grow young and strong again.'  But she only told them  half the spell; so they failed, while Medeia mocked them; and poor old  Pelias died, and his daughters came to misery.  But the songs say she  cured AEson, Jason's father, and he became young, and strong again.    But Jason could not love her, after all her cruel deeds.  So he was  ungrateful to her, and wronged her; and she revenged herself on him.  And  a terrible revenge she took--too terrible to speak of here.  But you will  hear of it yourselves when you grow up, for it has been sung in noble  poetry and music; and whether it be true or not, it stands for ever as a  warning to us not to seek for help from evil persons, or to gain good  ends by evil means.  For if we use an adder even against our enemies, it  will turn again and sting us.    But of all the other heroes there is many a brave tale left, which I have  no space to tell you, so you must read them for yourselves;--of the  hunting of the boar in Calydon, which Meleager killed; and of Heracles'  twelve famous labours; and of the seven who fought at Thebes; and of the  noble love of Castor and Polydeuces, the twin Dioscouroi--how when one  died the other would not live without him, so they shared their  immortality between them; and Zeus changed them into the two twin stars  which never rise both at once.    And what became of Cheiron, the good immortal beast?  That, too, is a sad  story; for the heroes never saw him more.  He was wounded by a poisoned  arrow, at Pholoe among the hills, when Heracles opened the fatal  wine-jar, which Cheiron had warned him not to touch.  And the Centaurs  smelt the wine, and flocked to it, and fought for it with Heracles; but  he killed them all with his poisoned arrows, and Cheiron was left alone.  Then Cheiron took up one of the arrows, and dropped it by chance upon his  foot; and the poison ran like fire along his veins, and he lay down and  longed to die; and cried, 'Through wine I perish, the bane of all my  race.  Why should I live for ever in this agony?  Who will take my  immortality, that I may die?'    Then Prometheus answered, the good Titan, whom Heracles had set free from  Caucasus, 'I will take your immortality and live for ever, that I may  help poor mortal men.'  So Cheiron gave him his immortality, and died,  and had rest from pain.  And Heracles and Prometheus wept over him, and  went to bury him on Pelion; but Zeus took him up"]]]
