I merely stepped in to get a peep  at the beautiful celebration and to fill my eyes and my imagination  with it. On the night to which I refer I managed to stay down longer  than usual. I looked for Marion everywhere. There were others, too,  who were looking for her. My mother's conduct had been criticised  and rather disapproved of; for those were simple folk, virtuous  themselves and pitiless to others. If Marion had been brutally  discharged, they would have applauded. Now they believed her to  be forgiven; and they felt her forgiveness to be in a measure an  encouragement to vice. Aunt Gabrielle had found time to speak to  the rector, to excuse Marguerite, she said; but without realizing  it she had merely expressed her disapprobation. I not only remember  all these details after sixty-five years, but I remember the room  in which the scene took place. I can even evoke the faces and the  attitudes,--the saintly protectress, somewhat moved, but very  resolute; the rector, restless and anxious; Gabrielle and her  confederates, pitiless in their censure. Although not a word had been  uttered in my presence concerning the nature of Marion's fault, I had  understood it all, thanks to \"Celina,\" no doubt. It is useless to  state which side my heart was on. The priest was anxious above all  things to preserve in our parish those rigid customs for which we  were famed.    \"A moral plague must be treated just like a physical plague, with  heroic remedies,\" said he.    \"We must be charitable,\" said my mother. \"Our God is a God of  charity.\"    The priest was of the opinion that the sinner should not under any  consideration be allowed to come back to the house and work among  the maid-servants.    \"Why, of course not; I never thought of such a thing,\" said my  mother, in that sweet voice of hers that reached one's soul. \"We must  make this an example, a warning for our girls. I will see to that,  never fear. I am just as anxious about it as you are. She will live  alone with her child. I did not care to crush her under the weight of  a public anathema, nor would I be so inexorable as to condemn her to  mendicity or debauch, that is all. I said to my poor Gabrielle, who  is so ungovernable to-night,\" she added, smiling, \"that I would take  her work myself if I found nobody to obey me; but that is not exactly  what I meant. What I meant was this: I will go to her myself; I will  go every day. I will assume, or rather encroach upon your rights.  I will exhort, I will preach to her; I will make her see that she  is among sisters whom her conduct has grieved, but among sisters,  nevertheless.\"    She said all this with kindness, simplicity, and firmness.    The priest lifted his broad-brimmed hat from his head. \"I uncover  my white hair before you, Madame,\" said he, in a loud voice, \"and I  pray God to bless the task that you have undertaken for his sake.  My children, Marion will come back and work among you when she has  made atonement for her fault. Until then I leave her entirely in  your mistress's hands. If she does not lead her back to the path of  virtue, we priests will have to give it up. Our Latin will not help  us out of it.\"    This very mild pleasantry excited much admiration, as everything did  that fell from those venerable lips.    For my part I was delighted, having a confused impression that we had  gained a great victory; and I ran off to bed after having kissed my  mother with unusual tenderness.    [Illustration]          THE MULE AND THE OX.    From the Spanish of BENITO PÉREZ GALDÓS.      I.    The poor little one had ceased to moan; she turned her head slightly  and stared with wide eyes at those who stood around her bed; her  breath came fainter, fainter, until it stopped altogether. She was  dead. The guardian angel uttered a deep sigh, unfolded his wings, and  flew away.    The poor mother could not believe in the reality of so much sorrow;  still Celinina's exquisite face was growing diaphanous and yellow,  like wax; her limbs were cold; and her body finally became rigid  and hard like that of a doll. Then the mother was led away from  the alcove, while the father, the nearest relatives, two or three  friends, and the servants performed the last duties toward the dead  child.    They dressed her in a beautiful gown of lawn that was as white and  as sheer as a cloud, and covered with frills and laces that looked  like foam. They put on her shoes, which were white too, and whose  soles showed that they had taken but few steps. They braided her  lovely dark chestnut hair, and arranged it gracefully about her  head, intertwining it with blue ribbons. They tried to find fresh  flowers, but the season was too far advanced, and there were none  to be had; so they made her a wreath of artificial ones, selecting  only those which were beautiful and which might have been mistaken  for real blossoms just from the garden. Then a very repulsive man  brought a box, just a trifle larger than the case of a violin, lined  with blue silk and elaborately adorned with white satin and silver  braid. Celinina was laid in it: an exquisite soft pillow was placed  under her head, so that her position might not seem strained; and  when she had been carefully and tenderly fixed in her funereal couch,  they crossed her little hands, tied them together with a ribbon, and  slipped a bunch of white roses between them,--roses so artistically  fashioned that they seemed to be the very children of Spring.    The women threw gorgeous draperies over a table, adorned it like  an altar, and laid the coffin upon it. They arranged other altars,  too, after the manner of church canopies, with fine white curtains,  gracefully caught back on either side. They brought a great quantity  of saints and images from other rooms, which they disposed with  great art in symmetrical groups, forming a sort of funereal court  around the departed angel. They also brought in, without losing a  moment, the great candelabrum from the parlor, and lighted several  dozen tapers, which shed their mournful glow upon Celinina. Then they  kissed the child's frozen cheek again and again, and their pious task  was done.      II.    From the other end of the house, from the depths of the bedrooms,  came the moans of a man and a woman, the heart-rending lamentations  of the parents who could not be convinced of the truth of those  aphorisms about angels in heaven, administered by friends as a sort  of moral sedative on these occasions. They believed, on the contrary,  that this world is the proper and natural habitation for angels; nor  could they admit the theory that the death of a grown person is far  more lamentable and disastrous than that of a child. Mingled with  their grief was that profound pity which the death-agony of an infant  always inspires, and to them there was no sorrow in life like that  which was tearing their very vitals. A thousand memories and painful  visions struck at their hearts like so many daggers. The mother's  ears rang with Celinina's lispings,--that enchanting baby-talk that  gets everything wrong, and converts the words of our language into  delicious philological caricatures, which caricatures, flowing from  rosy mouths, are the tenderest and most affecting music to a mother's  heart.    Nothing so characterizes a child as his style,--his spontaneous  mode of expression, the art of saying everything with four letters,  his prehistoric grammar, which is like the first sobbing of the  words at the dawn of humanity, his simple rules of declension and  conjugation, innocent corrections of the languages which usage has  legitimatized. The vocabulary of a child of three, like Celinina, is  the real literary treasure of a family. How could her mother ever  forget the little pink tongue that said \"wat\" for hat, and called a  bean a \"ween\"! No matter where she turned, the good woman's eyes were  sure to fall upon some of the toys with which Celinina had cheered  the last days of her life; and as these were the days that preceded  Christmas, the floor was strewn with little clay turkeys on wire  legs, a Saint Joseph that had lost both hands, a manger in which lay  the Christ-Child, like a little pink ball, a wise man from the Orient  mounted upon a proud, headless camel. What these poor little figures  had endured during the past few days, dragged here and there, made to  assume this or that posture, was known only to God, the mother, and  the pure little spirit that had taken its flight.    All this broken statuary was imbued with Celinina's very  soul,--clothed with a peculiar sad light, which was the light from  her, as it were. The mother trembled from head to foot as she gazed  at them, and she felt that the wound had been dealt to her innermost  being. Strange association of things! How all these broken pieces  of clay seemed to weep! They seemed so grieved, so full of intense  sorrow, that the sight of them was scarcely less bitter than the  spectacle of the dying child herself, who with appealing eyes begged  her parents to take the pain away from her burning head. To the  mother nothing could have been more pathetic than that turkey with  its wire legs, which in its frequent changes of posture had lost its  crest and its bill.      III.    The mother's grief was surely intense, but the father's affliction  was still more profound. She was transpierced with sorrow,--his pain  was aggravated by the stings of remorse. This is how it came about.  It will no doubt seem very childish to some people; however, let  them bear in mind that nothing is more open to childishness than a  deep, pure sorrow, free from any touch of worldly interests or the  secondary sufferings of unsatisfied egoism.    From the very first and all through her illness Celinina's mind was  filled with dreams of Christmas,--of the poetic celebration supremely  delightful to children.

Vol. 1 (of 3) (#20)"],[1,"that Mrs. O'Toole had treated me more like  a pet child than a respected \"Right Honourable\" since my illness, and  rather ruled me with a rod of iron.    I replied to her kind enquiries, and asked for Miss Vernon.    \"Is it Miss Kate? she's singin' like a lark. Ses she, 'Nurse, be sure  you ask Captin Egerton when I may go see him; I'm sure,' ses she, 'he's  angry with me for making him go back to help Mr. Gilpin,' ses she, 'or  he'd let me go see him as well as every one else,' ses she.\"    \"Did she though? I am most happy she made me instrumental in saving  Mr. Gilpin's life, and of course I'll be too glad to see her the next  time she calls on Mrs. Winter; but Nurse, don't I look confoundedly  wretched?\"    \"Musha is it that ye'r thinkin' of? ye needn't bother ye'r head about  it, honey. If ye were like ould Dan Kelly (an' he'd a broken nose an'  a cast in his two eyes), Miss Kate, 'ud think the sun shone in ye'r  face afther ye'r goin back to help the crather of an organist, an every  one else runin' away. She ses\"--    \"Oh! it was a natural instinct to help him.\"    \"Faith, it 'ud come more natural to many a one to save himself. I'll  never forget the night ye come home all bruised an' bloody, widout  as much life in ye as 'ud stand a pooff, Gilpin houldin' yer head,  Winter cursin' (God forgive him) like a throoper in Greek or Latin;  the ould masther, as studdy as a rock, sending off right an' left for  everything, an' Miss Kate as white as a sheet, an' thrimblin' from head  to fut, not spakin' a word, an' keepin' quiet as a lamb, just not to  disturb any one. Musha, but we'd the ruction!\"    \"I can never forget the great kindness you all showed me; I must have  been a great trouble to you when I was delirious; do you remember what  I raved about?\"    \"Oh! you was rampagin mad; it was ordtherin' the army one minit, an'  followin' the hounds the next, an' shoutin' murther to save Miss Kate,  for whatever ye began with, it iver an' always ended with her; may be  ye have a sisther called Kate.\"    \"No, it was your Miss Kate that always seemed to me in some deadly  danger, and I could not rescue her; your voice used invariably to break  the spell; but did any one else hear me except you?\"    \"I couldn't take upon me to say, but Mr. Gilpin an' meeself was wid ye  most times.\"    \"Hum! and Miss Vernon, you did not mention my delusions to her?\"    \"In course I did.\"    \"And what did she say?\"    Mrs. O'Toole just thought for a moment, and then looking up in my face,  said, \"Is it Miss Kate? Ses she--'isn't it odd, dear Nurse, how people  rave about those they never think of when sane,' ses she; sane or  sinsible was the word, but I _dis_ remember which.\"    Not much tenderness or recognition of my feelings there, I thought!  \"_Tant mieux_, you may put away the cup, Nurse, it was so good I quite  enjoyed it: and tell me, did you see Colonel Dashwood when he was over  here?\"    \"Is it the 'Curnel? To be sure I did, he was twizte over at the Priory,  an' a fine grand lookin' gentleman he is; he wanted the masther to  go back with him, but, ses he, 'No, Dashwood, I'm too old for a mess  table, an' I would have no pleasure widout poor Egerton, at all  evints,' ses he; an' then Miss Kate ups, an' ses she, 'If you take  grandpapa, 'Curnel, you must take me too, for we are--' Musha, I forget  the word.\"    \"Inseparable,\" I suggested.    \"Somethin' like it, anyhow; and then the 'Curnel bowed mighty grand,  an' ses he--'Arrah, then, it's the whole rigmint 'ull be wantin'  'Curnel Vernon, if I mintion them conditions,' ses he.\"    I laughed to a degree that alarmed Nurse, at the idea of our dashing  thorough-bred colonel prefacing his speech with \"arrah, thin.\"    \"I'll lave ye intirely if ye be shakin' yerself that way, when ye  havn't the stringth in ye to laugh out.\"    \"Oh Nurse, dear Nurse, do not go, tell me something more.\"    \"I havn't a ha'poth more to tell ye, an its time for me to be going.  The blessin' of Christ be wid ye, ye'r lookin' ten stone bether, Glory  be to God.\"    The next day in consequence of Nurse's report, Miss Vernon came with  her grandfather. I almost expected her, yet her advent made me feel  strangely nervous; it seemed strange to me too, being unable to rise,  that she should come over, and place her hand in mine, when I could not  stir to receive her; she sat down near me and began talking in a gentle  subdued tone, as if half afraid of disturbing me.    \"You look much better than I expected, Captain Egerton; what a  wonderful recovery! But why would you not let me come here before?\"    \"I was afraid my ghastly looks would frighten you.\"    \"You look all eyes now.\"    In a whisper, \"I am.\"    \"I do not think you look so well to day, Egerton, you have a feverish  excited air, and your voice is decidedly weaker,\" observed the Colonel.    \"Perhaps we ought not to stay,\" said Miss Vernon.    \"I beg you will not leave me,\" I gasped.    After a little more conversation a message from Mr. Winter called the  Colonel out of the room, and Kate and I were _tête-à-tête_.    \"Nurse gave rather a melancholy account of you yesterday,\" said Miss  Vernon, \"she said you were all alone and '_dissolute_' by yourself.  Have you no books?\"    \"I do not feel up to reading, but if I had any one to read out to  me--Gilpin has not time.\"    \"I would be delighted, I will come here and read to you and Mrs. Winter  every day.\"    \"You are most kind.\"    The excitement of her visit was too much for me, and I felt a faintness  stealing over me. Miss Vernon observing the deadly pallor of my face,  with an expression of alarm, felt my pulse. \"Let me call some one,\"  she said. I feebly grasped her hand, dreading that an interview so  delightful to me should be curtailed.    \"It is nothing--air, air!\" I articulated with much difficulty. Still  leaving her hand in mine, she stretched the other to a screen, and  fanned me silently for a few moments; then perceiving the returning  colour, \"Are you better now?\" she said softly, with such an expression  of tenderness in her dark eyes, I could have thrown myself at her feet.    \"If you will let go my hand I will get you a little of that bottle; I  see 'restorative' on it\" she added, without a shade of embarrassment,  evidently considering my desire to retain it some sickly fancy. I  reluctantly relinquished my hold and turning to the table she gave me  the medicine and then arranged my pillows in such a home-like manner.    From that interview, the sort of unsettled but ardent admiration I  had before entertained for her, seemed to deepen into something purer,  higher, more devoted, and unselfish, than I had ever felt before. I  looked forward to the possibility of calling her my wife; not with  the rash eagerness to possess a new toy, or to give life a new charm,  but with a deep rooted conviction that with her at my side, come weal  or woe, I would have love and truth and strength there always and  unchangeably.    From this time she came over constantly after my host's early dinner,  and read aloud, while Mrs. Winter pursued her occupation of knitting;  and I lay on my sofa all eye and ear. Winter and the Colonel often  joined our party, but the former was too fond of raising questions in  opposition to the opinions of whatever author we were perusing.    Miss Vernon generally chose the books she was to read, and I could not  help thinking she had some design in her selection; they were generally  thoughtful, high toned works, not coming under the denomination  of religious literature; but yet setting forth in a strong, though  unobtrusive manner, the necessity of faith; the healing power of  resignation.    I hinted one day that I could see she intended to convert me; she  disclaimed such an intention very eagerly, concluding, \"why should I  pretend to do so; I am sure you are as good as I am! I consulted Mr.  Gilpin about the books, and took what he advised, and I like them too,  for I feel they do me good; but I will bring you a novel to-morrow.\"  She did so, and chose Zanoni, excluding Winter from the lecture. I did  thoroughly enjoy it.    Miss Vernon seemed to identify herself with its noble thoughts, its  wild imaginings, its grand philosophy, and high-souled spirit of  self-sacrifice! Her musical voice varying with every sentiment it  expressed, and often laying down the book to discuss its character  with an interest and affection that invested them with life-like  reality: I had glanced over the work before, and put it down with an  acknowledgment, certainly, of the author's great genius, but with an  idea that it was beyond the scope of my imagination to enjoy. Kate's  readings and remarks on it revealed me to myself, and showed me I had  aspirations and capabilities for better things: yet it was merely the  outpouring of her own heart, and she would have raised her darkly  fringed eyelids in astonishment had any one told her she was making a  silent revolution in mine.    Poor Mrs. Winter used to listen to our animated debates on Viola and  Glyndon, &c., in perfect amazement, and when appealed to by Kate for  an opinion, replied with a smile, \"Indeed, my dear, I don't know; it's  a very curious book, and quite impossible to believe any man could see  and know everything the way that Mr. Zanoni did.\"    Longfellow's poems, then attracting notice for the first time in  England, were great favourites with Miss Vernon, and here she and  Winter perfectly agreed, for a wonder. These were hours of intense  happiness: the exterior world all forgotten, I lived in a fairy-like  dream, with just sufficient of earth around me to prove it real; my  strength was now rapidly returning, and I began to feel this delicious  breathing space from life's ruder joys and ruder cares had lasted long  enough. Once or twice I had caught Winter watching Kate and myself as  we sat apart rather from the others--she pouring forth her opinions on  some favourite author with all"]]]
