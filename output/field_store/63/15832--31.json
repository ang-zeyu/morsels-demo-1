And I recovered the tube for you, without which you would  have been helpless.  But that is the only time I saw fit to interfere  in any way.\"    \"I'm afraid I did not get a chance to give many hints to inventors or  scientists,\" said Rob.    \"True, and I have deeply regretted it,\" replied the Demon.  \"But your  unusual powers caused more astonishment and consternation than you,  perhaps, imagined; for many saw you whom you were too busy to notice.  As a result several able electricians are now thinking new thoughts  along new lines, and some of them may soon give these or similar  inventions to the world.\"    \"You are satisfied, then?\" asked Rob.    \"As to that,\" returned the Demon, composedly, \"I am not.  But I have  hopes that with the addition of the three marvelous devices I shall  present you with to-day you will succeed in arousing so much popular  interest in electrical inventions as to render me wholly satisfied with  the result of this experiment.\"    Rob regarded the brilliant apparition with a solemn face, but made no  answer.    \"No living person,\" continued the Demon, \"has ever before been favored  with such comforting devices for the preservation and extension of  human life as yourself.  You seem quite unappreciative, it is true; but  since our connection I have come to realize that you are but an  ordinary boy, with many boyish limitations; so I do not condemn your  foolish actions too harshly.\"    \"That is kind of you,\" said Rob.    \"To prove my friendliness,\" pursued the Demon, \"I have brought, as the  first of to-day's offerings this Electro-Magnetic Restorer.  You see it  is shaped like a thin metal band, and is to be worn upon the brow,  clasping at the back of the head.  Its virtues surpass those of either  the fabulous 'Fountain of Youth,' or the 'Elixir of Life,' so vainly  sought for in past ages.  For its wearer will instantly become free  from any bodily disease or pain and will enjoy perfect health and  vigor.  In truth, so great are its powers that even the dead may be  restored to life, provided the blood has not yet chilled.  In  presenting you with this appliance, I feel I am bestowing upon you the  greatest blessing and most longed-for boon ever bequeathed of suffering  humanity.\"    Here he held the slender, dull-colored metallic band toward the boy.    \"Keep it,\" said Rob.    The Demon started, and gave him an odd look.    \"What did you say?\" he asked.    \"I told you to keep it,\" answered Rob.  \"I don't want it.\"    The Demon staggered back as if he had been struck.    \"Don't want it!\" he gasped.    \"No; I've had enough of your infernal inventions!\" cried the boy, with  sudden anger.    He unclasped the traveling machine from his wrist and laid it on the  table beside the Demon.    \"There's the thing that's responsible for most of my troubles,\" said  he, bitterly.  \"What right has one person to fly through the air while  all his fellow-creatures crawl over the earth's surface?  And why  should I be cut off from all the rest of the world because you have  given me this confounded traveling machine?  I didn't ask for it, and I  won't keep it a moment longer.  Give it to some one you hate more than  you do me!\"    The Demon stared aghast and turned his glittering eyes wonderingly from  Rob to the traveling machine and back again, as if to be sure he had  heard and seen aright.    \"And here are your food tablets,\" continued the boy, placing the box  upon the table.  \"I've only enjoyed one square meal since you gave them  to me.  They're all right to preserve life, of course, and answer the  purpose for which they were made; but I don't believe nature ever  intended us to exist upon such things, or we wouldn't have the sense of  taste, which enables us to enjoy natural food.  As long as I'm a human  being I'm going to eat like a human being, so I've consumed my last  Electrical Concentrated Food Tablet--and don't you forget it!\"    The Demon sank into a chair, nerveless and limp, but still staring  fearfully at the boy.    \"And there's another of your unnatural devices,\" said Rob, putting the  Automatic Record of Events upon the table beside the other things.  \"What right have you to capture vibrations that radiate from private  and secret actions and discover them to others who have no business to  know them?  This would be a fine world if every body could peep into  every one else's affairs, wouldn't it?  And here is your Character  Marker.  Nice thing for a decent person to own, isn't it?  Any one who  would take advantage of such a sneaking invention as that would be  worse than a thief!  Oh, I've used them, of course, and I ought to be  spanked for having been so mean and underhanded; but I'll never be  guilty of looking through them again.\"    The Demon's face was frowning and indignant.  He made a motion to rise,  but thought better of it and sank back in his chair.    \"As for the Garment of Protection,\" resumed the boy, after a pause,  \"I've worn it for the last time, and here it is, at your service.  I'll  put the Electric Tube with it.  Not that these are such very bad things  in themselves, but I'll have none of your magical contrivances.  I'll  say this, however: if all armies were equipped with Electrical Tubes  instead of guns and swords the world would be spared a lot of misery  and unnecessary bloodshed.  Perhaps in time; but that time hasn't  arrived yet.\"    \"You might have hastened it,\" said the Demon, sternly, \"if you had been  wise enough to use your powers properly.\"    \"That's just it,\" answered Rob.  \"I'm NOT wise enough.  Nor is the  majority of mankind wise enough to use such inventions as yours  unselfishly and for the good of the world.  If people were better, and  every one had an equal show, it would be different.\"    For some moments the Demon sat quietly thinking.  Finally the frown  left his face and he said, with animation:    \"I have other inventions, which you may use without any such qualms of  conscience.  The Electro-Magnetic Restorer I offered you would be a  great boon to your race, and could not possibly do harm.  And, besides  this, I have brought you what I call the Illimitable Communicator.  It  is a simple electric device which will enable you, wherever you may be,  to converse with people in any part of the world, without the use of  such crude connections as wires.  In fact, you may--\"    \"Stop!\" cried Rob.  \"It is useless for you to describe it, because I'll  have nothing more to do with you or your inventions.  I have given them  a fair trial, and they've got me into all sorts of trouble and made all  my friends miserable.  If I was some high-up scientist it would be  different; but I'm just a common boy, and I don't want to be anything  else.\"    \"But, your duty--\" began the Demon.    \"My duty I owe to myself and to my family,\" interrupted Rob.  \"I have  never cultivated science, more than to fool with some simple electrical  experiments, so I owe nothing to either science or the Demon of  Electricity, so far as I can see.\"    \"But consider,\" remonstrated the Demon, rising to his feet and speaking  in a pleading voice, \"consider the years that must elapse before any  one else is likely to strike the Master Key!  And, in the meanwhile,  consider my helpless position, cut off from all interest in the world  while I have such wonderful inventions on my hands for the benefit of  mankind.  If you have no love for science or for the advancement of  civilization, DO have some consideration for your fellow-creatures, and  for me!\"    \"If my fellow-creatures would have as much trouble with your electrical  inventions as I had, I am doing them a service by depriving them of  your devices,\" said the boy.  \"As for yourself, I've no fault to find  with you, personally.  You're a very decent sort of Demon, and I've no  doubt you mean well; but there's something wrong about our present  combination, I'm sure.  It isn't natural.\"    The Demon made a gesture of despair.    \"Why, oh why did not some intelligent person strike the Master Key!\" he  moaned.    \"That's it!\" exclaimed Rob.  \"I believe that's the root of the whole  evil.\"    \"What is?\" inquired the Demon, stupidly.    \"The fact that an intelligent person did not strike the Master Key.  You don't seem to understand.  Well, I'll explain.  You're the Demon of  Electricity, aren't you?\"    \"I am,\" said the other, drawing himself up proudly.    \"Your mission is to obey the commands of whoever is able to strike the  Master Key of Electricity.\"    \"That is true.\"    \"I once read in a book that all things are regulated by exact laws of  nature.  If that is so you probably owe your existence to those laws.\"  The Demon nodded.  \"Doubtless it was intended that when mankind became  intelligent enough and advanced enough to strike the Master Key, you  and all your devices would not only be necessary and acceptable to  them, but the world would be prepared for their general use.  That  seems reasonable, doesn't it?\"    \"Perhaps so.  Yes; it seems reasonable,\" answered the Demon,  thoughtfully.    \"Accidents are always liable to happen,\" continued the boy.  \"By  accident the Master Key was struck long before the world of science was  ready for it--or for you.  Instead of considering it an accident and  paying no attention to it you immediately appeared to me--a mere  boy--and offered your services.\"    \"I was very anxious to do something,\" returned the Demon, evasively.  \"You've no idea how stupid it is for me to live invisible and unknown,  while all the time I have in my possession secrets of untold benefit to  the world.\"    \"Well, you'll have to keep cool and bide your time,\" said Rob.  \"The  world wasn't made in a minute, and while civilization is going on at a  pretty good pace, we're not up to the Demon of Electricity yet.\"    \"What shall I do!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43607"],[0,"Builders of United Italy (#20)"],[1," the Witch of Endor. The passers-by look like ghosts--one feels almost  a ghost oneself.\"    The lack of money oppressed him sorely; he would give to every Italian  who begged of him on the score of universal brotherhood, gradually his  few possessions went their way to the pawnshop. He said that he needed  only a place to write and a few pennies to buy cigars. Then by one of  those curious chances of fate he met the Carlyles, and his life became  a little less cramped and lonely, although perhaps more tempestuous.  There are a score of accounts of evenings Mazzini spent with these new  friends, the one of whom he admired as a great thinker, the other as a  truly noble woman. In time Carlyle tried the gentle Italian sorely; the  story goes that the philosopher would rage at all human institutions  with the violence of a hurricane and then turn to his guest with the  words, \"You have not succeeded yet because you have talked too much.\" We  can picture the boisterous, stormy Englishman thundering at those ideals  which the sensitive, passionate Italian was trying to defend. It speaks  well for Mazzini that he said of Carlyle, \"He is good, good, good; and  still, I think in spite of his great reputation, unhappy.\" Carlyle's  estimate of Mazzini was that he was \"by nature a little lyrical poet.\"  This opposition of ideas did not, however, keep him from defending his  Italian friend when others attacked him. The London _Times_ saw fit to  speak slightingly of Mazzini, and Carlyle wrote the editors in noble  indignation. \"Whatever I may think of his practical insight and skill  in worldly affairs,\" he said, \"I can with great freedom testify to all  men that he, if I have ever seen such, is a man of genius and virtue, a  man of sterling veracity, humanity, and nobleness of mind, one of those  rare men, numerable, unfortunately, but as units in this world, who are  worthy to be called martyr souls; who in silence, piously in their daily  life, understand and practise what is meant by that.\" These were glowing  words, and thrilled Mazzini as he read them. They were a tribute to  Carlyle's justice, but it is doubtful if he ever really understood the  Italian. He would have found it difficult to discover a prophet living  in lodgings so near to his own house.    Gradually Mazzini made other English friends, and he worked his way into  the pages of the best reviews. In time also his political efforts were  revived; he never let any temporary interest dim his goal. He started a  society of Italian workmen in London, and edited a paper for them, and  opened an evening school where poor Italian boys were taught to read and  write and learn something of Italian history. This school was very near  his heart, he was always devoted to children.    During Mazzini's exiled years in London, \"Young Italy\" had spread over  Europe, and through countless secret channels was gradually making its  strength felt. Outside circumstances were needed to bring its forces  to a head, but there was no doubt that Mazzini's words had called a  power into being that must in time inevitably come to a life and death  struggle with the Austrians. It is difficult to point out the exact  minor causes of each fluctuation in Italian opinion, it is certain  that the new popular literature called readers to take account of the  words of Dante, and that the more they read the great poet the more  they longed for liberty from the foreigner. Charles Albert, it was  felt, was again dreaming of heroic measures, and something of the old,  almost legendary faith in the house of Savoy as a national deliverer,  re-awakened. Manzoni and Gioberti were prophesying a great Catholic  revival, and the election of Pius the Ninth seemed for the moment to  justify the hope. The half-pitiful words of Pius, \"They want to make a  Napoleon of me who am only a poor country parson,\" was a more correct  estimate of the Pontiff than the glowing words of his contemporaries; he  was no more in accord with the spirit of his time than was Metternich.  Still his election marked the swing of the pendulum in the liberal  direction, and \"Young Italy\" was quick to take notice of such a fact.    The year 1848 was remarkable for concerted social movements throughout  Europe. In France the Second Republic overthrew the monarchy, and  throughout the Italian states an electric current shocked the people  into revolution. Leghorn revolted and made Guerrazzi its chief, Milan  fell easy victim to the Tobacco rioters, Sicily sent its Bourbon king  flying, and Naples wrested a popular constitution from the greedy hand  of Ferdinand. Piedmont and Tuscany followed soon, demanded and obtained  constitutions, and the Pope, alarmed at the sudden spread of liberalism,  granted a constitution to Rome. The moment seemed ripe to throw off the  Austrian overlords.    There are few more tangled histories than the record of the next few  months in Italy. It is a drama filled with heroic figures, but one  through which runs the current of continual misunderstandings. Was  Italy to be a kingdom or a republic? Was the Pope a menace or a help?  Was French aid to be courted or rejected? These were only a few of the  questions on which men split. The one glorious fact was the burning  patriotic ardor of Italians in each state from Sicily to Savoy, their  actual belief in the religion of duty Mazzini had been preaching to them.    Word came to Milan that there was revolution in Vienna, and the  Five Days drove the Austrian garrison from their stronghold. Como,  Brescia, Venice, all the northern cities that had so long loathed the  white-coated overlords, won freedom; Metternich's puppet-princes of  Modena and Parma fled. Piedmont declared war, Tuscany declared war,  volunteers of all ranks and ages poured from Umbria to help the northern  armies. Mazzini, hearing the news in London, sped to Milan, and was  received as the prophet of the new day. Italy had its prophet, but the  statesman and the soldier were not yet recognized.    The new provisional government in Milan had no fixed policy, Charles  Albert's advisers still clogged his steps, the volunteers were ready,  but they had neither the arms nor the training to compete with the  war-worn Austrians. While there was discussion and dissension in  Lombardy, the enemy recuperated and returned to besiege the cities they  had lost. By July the Italian army was driven into Milan, there the  spirit of the earlier Five Days revived, but victory appeared hopeless,  and finally Charles Albert, torn and distracted, surrendered the city.  Mazzini passed to Lugano, thence to Leghorn, thence to Florence; in each  city the situation was practically the same, the people were aflame with  devotion to Italy, the leaders had as many plans as there were men.    Rome had driven out the Pope and proclaimed the Republic. The call of  Rome was the call direct to Mazzini's soul, he turned there to find a  solution of all difficulties. Simultaneously the newly formed Roman  Assembly turned to him, and bade him welcome as a citizen of Rome. He  believed that Dante's vision and his own were coming true, and hurried  to the Eternal City. His first work there was to raise ten thousand  troops and send them north. They had scarcely started when the crushing  news of the defeat at Novara stunned all patriots. Rome had to look to  herself, and made Mazzini Triumvir and practically dictator of the city.    The little Roman Republic of 1849 had an inspiring history. Mazzini had  written and spoken, now it became his turn to act. He was set at the  head of a city from which its spiritual as well as its temporal head had  fled. Priests and protesting laymen were all about him, it would have  been easy for him to scorn the power that scoffed at him. He did not,  he himself doubted the strength of the Catholic Church to survive, he  dreamed of a new church which should speak to the world from the seven  hills of Rome, but he would not take a single step to destroy one man's  religion. More than that he made it his special duty to see that the  priests were not disturbed in their work. He wanted the Republic to be  based on the love of God. He hoped that the Church would aid the Italian  cause for the love of man. He would allow the Pope to reign as spiritual  Prince, if he would only be content with his own noble sphere.    Rome won back something of its historic ardor under Mazzini's call. The  Republic was planned on lines of great proportions, steps were actually  taken to make it a republic wherein each man had a worthy share. The  foundations were laid with the greatest patience and zeal, the Triumvir  gave the last ounce of his strength to building truly, he lived as he  had always lived, for others, and took nothing for himself. Margaret  Fuller said that at this time his face, haggard and worn, seemed to her  \"more divine than ever.\" The poorest citizen could find him as readily  as the richest, he was the same to all, he gave away his small salary of  office as entirely as in his London days he had dispersed his earnings.  If ever man's rule was noble, if ever it was spiritual, that of Rome's  Triumvir was, in the weeks when he faced treachery both from without and  within.    It is scarcely possible that Mazzini could have expected his city to  stand against the armies that were marching towards it. At most he could  only hope to show the Romans of what great self-sacrifice they were  capable. He probably hoped that the Republic would convince Italians  that the spirit of \"Young Italy\" was not a mere prophet's dream. That he  did; he could not fight Austria and France single-handed.    Louis Napoleon had evolved one of his great ideas, he would win both the  French army and the French clergy by a strategic move. He sent Oudinot  into Italy, blinding the Romans with various subtleties, waiting until  the propitious hour to strike. The Romans understood, the Assembly  voted to resist to the end,"]]]
