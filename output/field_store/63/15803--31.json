The Filippo Strozzi  mentioned as having been his master was the great opponent of the  Medicean despotism, who killed himself in prison after the defeat of  Montemurlo in 1539. He married in early life a daughter of Piero de  Medici.    Note 2. 'Passatojacci.'    Note 3. Franciotto Orsini was educated in the household of his kinsman  Lorenzo de Medici. He followed the profession of arms, and married; but  after losing his wife took orders, and received the hat in 1517.    Note 4. 'Io che non potevo stare alle mosse.'    XXXIX    AFTER I had melted down the gold, I took it to the Pope, who thanked me  cordially for what I had done, and ordered the Cavalierino to give me  twenty-five crowns, apologising to me for his inability to give me more.  A few days afterwards the articles of peace were signed. I went with  three hundred comrades in the train of Signor Orazio Baglioni toward  Perugia; and there he wished to make me captain of the company, but I  was unwilling at the moment, saying that I wanted first to go and see my  father, and to redeem the ban which was still in force against me at  Florence. Signor Orazio told me that he had been appointed general of  the Florentines; and Sir Pier Maria del Lotto, the envoy from Florence,  was with him, to whom he specially recommended me as his man. 1    In course of time I came to Florence in the company of several comrades.  The plague was raging with indescribable fury. When I reached home, I  found my good father, who thought either that I must have been killed in  the sack of Rome, or else that I should come back to him a beggar.  However, I entirely defeated both these expectations; for I was alive,  with plenty of money, a fellow to wait on me, and a good horse. My joy  on greeting the old man was so intense, that, while he embraced and  kissed me, I thought that I must die upon the spot. After I had narrated  all the devilries of that dreadful sack, and had given him a good  quantity of crowns which I had gained by my soldiering, and when we had  exchanged our tokens of affection, he went off to the Eight to redeem my  ban. It so happened that one of those magistrates who sentenced me, was  now again a member of the board. It was the very man who had so  inconsiderately told my father he meant to march me out into the country  with the lances. My father took this opportunity of addressing him with  some meaning words, in order to mark his revenge, relying on the favour  which Orazio Baglioni showed me.    Matters standing thus, I told my father how Signor Orazio had appointed  me captain, and that I ought to begin to think of enlisting my company.  At these words the poor old man was greatly disturbed, and begged me for  Gods sake not to turn my thoughts to such an enterprise, although he  knew I should be fit for this or yet a greater business, adding that his  other son, my brother, was already a most valiant soldier, and that I  ought to pursue the noble art in which I had laboured so many years and  with such diligence of study. Although I promised to obey him, he  reflected, like a man of sense, that if Signor Orazio came to Florence,  I could not withdraw myself from military service, partly because I had  passed my word, as well as for other reasons; He therefore thought of a  good expedient for sending me away, and spoke to me as follows: Oh, my  dear son, the plague in this town is raging with immitigable violence,  and I am always fancying you will come home infected with it. I  remember, when I was a young man, that I went to Mantua, where I was  very kindly received, and stayed there several years. I pray and command  you, for the love of me, to pack off and go thither; and I would have  you do this to-day rather than to-morrow.    Note 1. Pier Maria di Lotto of S. Miniato was notary to the Florentine  Signoria. He collected the remnants of the Bandle Nere, and gave them  over to Orazio Baglioni, who contrived to escape from S. Angelo in  safety to Perugia.    XL    I HAD always taken pleasure in seeing the world; and having never been  in Mantua, I went there very willingly. Of the money I had brought to  Florence, I left the greater part with my good father, promising to help  him wherever I might be, and confiding him to the care of my elder  sister. Her name was Cosa; and since she never cared to marry, she was  admitted as a nun in Santa Orsola; but she put off taking the veil, in  order to keep house for our old father, and to look after my younger  sister, who was married to one Bartolommeo, a surgeon. So then, leaving  home with my fathers blessing, I mounted my good horse, and rode off on  it to Mantua.    It would take too long to describe that little journey in detail. The  whole world being darkened over with plague and war, I had the greatest  difficulty in reaching Mantua. However, in the end, I got there, and  looked about for work to do, which I obtained from a Maestro Niccolò of  Milan, goldsmith to the Duke of Mantua. Having thus settled down to  work, I went after two days to visit Messer Giulio Romano, that most  excellent painter, of whom I have already spoken, and my very good  friend. He received me with the tenderest caresses, and took it very ill  that I had not dismounted at his house. He was living like a lord, and  executing a great work for the Duke outside the city gates, in a place  called Del Te. It was a vast and prodigious undertaking, as may still, I  suppose, be seen by those who go there. [1]    Messer Giulio lost no time in speaking of me to the Duke in terms of the  warmest praise. [2] That Prince commissioned me to make a model for a  reliquary, to hold the blood of Christ, which they have there, and say  was brought them by Longinus. Then he turned to Giulio, bidding him  supply me with a design for it. To this Giulio replied: My lord,  Benvenuto is a man who does not need other peoples sketches, as your  Excellency will be very well able to judge when you shall see his  model. I set hand to the work, and made a drawing for the reliquary,  well adapted to contain the sacred phial. Then I made a little waxen  model of the cover. This was a seated Christ, supporting his great cross  aloft with the left hand, while he seemed to lean against it, and with  the fingers of his right hand he appeared to be opening the wound in his  side. When it was finished, it pleased the Duke so much that he heaped  favours on me, and gave me to understand that he would keep me in his  service with such appointments as should enable me to live in affluence.    Meanwhile, I had paid my duty to the Cardinal his brother, who begged  the Duke to allow me to make the pontifical seal of his most reverend  lordship. [3] This I began; but while I was working at it I caught a  quartan fever. During each access of this fever I was thrown into  delirium, when I cursed Mantua and its master and whoever stayed there  at his own liking. These words were reported to the Duke by the Milanese  goldsmith, who had not omitted to notice that the Duke wanted to employ  me. When the Prince heard the ravings of my sickness, he flew into a  passion against me; and I being out of temper with Mantua, our bad  feeling was reciprocal. The seal was finished after four months,  together with several other little pieces I made for the Duke under the  name of the Cardinal. His Reverence paid me well, and bade me return to  Rome, to that marvellous city where we had made acquaintance.    I quitted Mantua with a good sum of crowns, and reached Governo, where  the most valiant general Giovanni had been killed. [4] Here I had a  slight relapse of fever, which did not interrupt my journey, and coming  now to an end, it never returned on me again. When I arrived at  Florence, I hoped to find my dear father, and knocking at the door, a  hump-backed woman in a fury showed her face at the window; she drove me  off with a torrent of abuse, screaming that the sight of me was a  consumption to her. To this misshapen hag I shouted: Ho! tell me,  cross-grained hunchback, is there no other face to see here but your  ugly visage? No, and bad luck to you. Whereto I answered in a loud  voice: In less than two hours may it [5] never vex us more! Attracted  by this dispute, a neighbour put her head out, from whom I learned that  my father and all the people in the house had died of the plague. As I  had partly guessed it might be so, my grief was not so great as it would  otherwise have been. The woman afterwards told me that only my sister  Liperata had escaped, and that she had taken refuge with a pious lady  named Mona Andrea de Bellacci. 6    I took my way from thence to the inn, and met by accident a very dear  friend of mine, Giovanni Rigogli. Dismounting at his house, we proceeded  to the piazza, where I received intelligence that my brother was alive,  and went to find him at the house of a friend of his called Bertino  Aldobrandini. On meeting, we made demonstrations of the most passionate  affection; for he had heard that I was dead, and I had heard that he was  dead; and so our joy at embracing one another was extravagant. Then he  broke out into a loud fit of laughter, and said: Come, brother, I will  take you where Im sure youd never guess! You must know that I have  given our sister Liperata away again in marriage, and she holds it for  absolutely certain that you are dead. On our way we told each other all  the wonderful adventures we had met with; and when we reached the house  where our sister dwelt, the surprise of seeing me alive threw her into a  fainting fit, and she fell senseless in my arms. Had not my brother been  present, her speechlessness and sudden seizure must have made her  husband imagine I was some one different from a brother-as indeed at  first it did. Cecchino, however, explained matters, and busied himself  in helping the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4035"],[0,"Greek Studies: a Series of Essays (#20)"],[1,"shore with gems of flowers; and, under  her skilful hand, the threads, with their inwrought lustre, swell up,  in momentary counterfeit of the waves; you might think that the sea-  wind flapped against the rocks, and that a hollow murmur came  creeping over the thirsty sands.  She puts in the five zones, marking  with a red ground the midmost zone, possessed by burning heat; its  outline was parched and stiff; the threads seemed thirsty with the  constant sunshine; on either side lay the two zones proper for human  life, [133] where a gentle temperance reigns; and at the extremes she  drew the twin zones of numbing cold, making her work dun and sad with  the hues of perpetual frost. She paints in, too, the sacred places of  Dis, her father's brother, and the Manes, so fatal to her; and an  omen of her doom was not wanting; for, as she worked, as if with  foreknowledge of the future, her face became wet with a sudden burst  of tears.  And now, in the utmost border of the tissue, she had begun  to wind in the wavy line of the river Oceanus, with its glassy  shallows; but the door sounds on its hinges, and she perceives the  goddesses coming; the unfinished work drops from her hands, and a  ruddy blush lights up in her clear and snow-white face.\"    I have reserved to the last what is perhaps the daintiest treatment  of this subject in classical literature, the account of it which Ovid  gives in the Fasti--a kind of Roman Calendar--for the seventh of  April, the day of the games of Ceres.  He tells over again the old  story, with much of which, he says, the reader will be already  familiar; but he has something also of his own to add to it, which  the reader will hear for the first time; and, like one of those old  painters who, in depicting a scene of Christian history, drew from  their own fancy or experience its special setting and accessories, he  translates the story into something very different from the Homeric  hymn.  The writer of the Homeric [134] hymn had made Celeus a king,  and represented the scene at Eleusis in a fair palace, like the  Venetian painters who depict the persons of the Holy Family with  royal ornaments.  Ovid, on the other hand, is more like certain  painters of the early Florentine school, who represent the holy  persons amid the more touching circumstances of humble life; and the  special something of his own which he adds, is a pathos caught from  homely things, not without a delightful, just perceptible, shade of  humour even, so rare in such work.  All the mysticism has  disappeared; but, instead, we trace something of that \"worship of  sorrow,\" which has been sometimes supposed to have had no place in  classical religious sentiment.  In Ovid's well-finished elegiacs,  Persephone's flower-gathering, the Anthology, reaches its utmost  delicacy; but I give the following episode for the sake of its  pathetic expression.    \"After many wanderings Ceres was come to Attica.  There, in the  utmost dejection, for the first time, she sat down to rest on a bare  stone, which the people of Attica still call the stone of sorrow.  For many days she remained there motionless, under the open sky,  heedless of the rain and of the frosty moonlight.  Places have their  fortunes; and what is now the illustrious town of Eleusis was then  the field of an old man named Celeus.  He was carrying home a load of  acorns, and wild berries shaken down from the [135] brambles, and dry  wood for burning on the hearth; his little daughter was leading two  goats home from the hills; and at home there was a little boy lying  sick in his cradle.  'Mother,' said the little girl--and the goddess  was moved at the name of mother--'what do you, all alone, in this  solitary place?'  The old man stopped too, in spite of his heavy  burden, and bade her take shelter in his cottage, though it was but a  little one.  But at first she refused to come; she looked like an  old woman, and an old woman's coif confined her hair; and as the man  still urged her, she said to him, 'Heaven bless you; and may children  always be yours!  My daughter has been stolen from me.  Alas! how  much happier is your lot than mine'; and, though weeping is  impossible for the gods, as she spoke, a bright drop, like a tear,  fell into her bosom.  Soft-hearted, the little girl and the old man  weep together.  And after that the good man said, 'Arise! despise not  the shelter of my little home; so may the daughter whom you seek be  restored to you.'  'Lead me,' answered the goddess; 'you have found  out the secret of moving me;' and she arose from the stone, and  followed the old man; and as they went he told her of the sick child  at home--how he is restless with pain, and cannot sleep.  And she,  before entering the little cottage, gathered from the untended earth  the soothing and sleep-giving poppy; and as she gathered it, it is  said that she [136] forgot her vow, and tasted of the seeds, and  broke her long fast, unaware.  As she came through the door, she saw  the house full of trouble, for now there was no more hope of life for  the sick boy.  She saluted the mother, whose name was Metaneira, and  humbly kissed the lips of the child, with her own lips; then the  paleness left its face, and suddenly the parents see the strength  returning to its body; so great is the force that comes from the  divine mouth.  And the whole family was full of joy--the mother and  the father and the little girl; they were the whole household.*    Three profound ethical conceptions, three impressive sacred figures,  have now defined themselves for the Greek imagination, condensed from  all the traditions which have now been traced, from the hymns of the  poets, from the instinctive and unformulated mysticism of primitive  minds.  Demeter is become the divine sorrowing mother.  Kore, the  goddess of summer, is become Persephone, the goddess of death, still  associated with the forms and odours of flowers and fruit, yet as one  risen from the dead also, presenting one side of her ambiguous nature  to men's gloomier fancies.  Thirdly, there is the image of Demeter  enthroned, chastened by sorrow, and somewhat advanced in age,  blessing the earth, in her joy at the return of Kore.  The myth has  [137] now entered on the third phase of its life, in which it becomes  the property of those more elevated spirits, who, in the decline of  the Greek religion, pick and choose and modify, with perfect freedom  of mind, whatever in it may seem adapted to minister to their  culture.  In this way, the myths of the Greek religion become parts  of an ideal, visible embodiments of the susceptibilities and  intuitions of the nobler kind of souls; and it is to this latest  phase of mythological development that the highest Greek sculpture  allies itself.  Its function is to give visible aesthetic expression  to the constituent parts of that ideal.  As poetry dealt chiefly with  the incidents of the story, so it is with the personages of the  story--with Demeter and Kore themselves--that sculpture has to do.    For the myth of Demeter, like the Greek religion in general, had its  unlovelier side, grotesque, unhellenic, unglorified by art,  illustrated well enough by the description Pausanias gives us of his  visit to the cave of the Black Demeter at Phigalia.  In his time the  image itself had vanished; but he tells us enough about it to enable  us to realise its general characteristics, monstrous as the special  legend with which it was connected, the black draperies, the horse's  head united to the woman's body, with the carved reptiles creeping  about it.  If, with the thought of this gloomy image of our mother  the earth, in our minds, we take up one of those coins [138] which  bear the image of Kore or Demeter,* we shall better understand what  the function of sculpture really was, in elevating and refining the  religious conceptions of the Greeks.  Looking on the profile, for  instance, on one of those coins of Messene, which almost certainly  represent Demeter, and noting the crisp, chaste opening of the lips,  the minutely wrought earrings, and the delicately touched ears of  corn,--this trifling object being justly regarded as, in its  aesthetic qualities, an epitome of art on a larger scale,--we shall  see how far the imagination of the Greeks had travelled from what  their Black Demeter shows us had once been possible for them, and in  making the gods of their worship the objects of a worthy  companionship in their thoughts.  Certainly, the mind of the old  workman who struck that coin was, if we may trust the testimony of  his work, unclouded by impure or gloomy shadows.  The thought of  Demeter is impressed here, with all the purity and proportion, the  purged and dainty intelligence of the human countenance.  The mystery  of it is indeed absent, perhaps could hardly have been looked for in  so slight a thing, intended for no sacred purpose, and tossed lightly  from hand to hand.  But in his firm hold on the harmonies of the  human face, the designer of this tranquil head of [139] Demeter is on  the one road to a command over the secrets of all imaginative pathos  and mystery; though, in the perfect fairness and blitheness of his  work, he might seem almost not to have known the incidents of her  terrible story.    It is probable that, at a later period than in other equally  important temples of Greece, the earlier archaic representation of  Demeter in the sanctuary of Eleusis, was replaced by a more beautiful  image in the new style, with face and hands of ivory, having  therefore, in tone and texture, some subtler likeness to women's  flesh, and the closely enveloping drapery being constructed in  daintily beaten plates of gold.  Praxiteles seems to have been the  first to bring into the region of a freer artistic handling these shy  deities of the earth, shrinking still within the narrow restraints of  a hieratic, conventional treatment, long after the"]]]
