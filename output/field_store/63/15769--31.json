As our Nation grows, people expect and need more from their  forests--more wood; more water, fish, and wildlife; more recreation and  natural beauty; more special forest products and forage. The Forest  Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture helps to fulfill these  expectations and needs through three major activities:    [Illustration]        . Conducting forest and range research at over 75 locations        ranging from Puerto Rico to Alaska to Hawaii.        . Participating with all State forestry agencies in        cooperative programs to protect, improve, and wisely        use our Country's 395 million acres of State, local,        and private forest lands.        . Managing and protecting the 187-million acre National        Forest System.    The Forest Service does this by encouraging use of the new knowledge  that research scientists develop; by setting an example in managing,  under sustained yield, the National Forests and Grasslands for multiple  use purposes; and by cooperating with all States and with private  citizens in their efforts to achieve better management, protection, and  use of forest resources.    Traditionally, Forest Service people have been active members of the  communities and towns in which they live and work. They strive to  secure for all, continuous benefits from the Country's forest  resources.    For more than 60 years, the Forest Service has been serving the Nation  as a leading natural resource conservation agency.           *       *       *       *       *          Transcriber's Notes      This is a compilation of four separate reports, each having their own  table and figure numbers.

He was very happy there, petted and made much of, until one day a  treacherous rival, an alderman of the village, lay in wait for him  early in the morning when he was coming out of the tavern, and would  have beaten him with a wooden club. But Ulenspiegel, thinking to cool  his rival's anger, threw him into a duck-pond that was full of water,  and the alderman scrambled out as best he could, green as a toad and  dripping like a sponge.    As a result of this mighty deed Ulenspiegel found it convenient to  depart from Koolkerke, and off he went to Damme as fast as his legs  would carry him, fearing the vengeance of the alderman.    The night fell cold, and Ulenspiegel ran quickly. For he was longing  to be home again, and already he saw in imagination Nele sewing by the  fire, Soetkin getting ready the supper, Claes binding up his sticks,  and Schnouffius gnawing at a bone.    A tramping pedlar met him on the road and asked him whither he was  off to so fast and at that time of night.    \"To my home in Damme,\" Ulenspiegel told him.    The tramp said:    \"That town is no longer safe. They are arresting the Reformers there.\"  And he passed on.    Presently Ulenspiegel arrived at the inn of the Roode Schildt and  went in for a glass of dobbel kuyt. The innkeeper said to him:    \"Are you not the son of Claes?\"    \"I am,\" said Ulenspiegel.    \"Make haste then,\" said the innkeeper, \"for the hour of evil fortune  has sounded for your father.\"    Ulenspiegel asked him what he meant by these words, and the innkeeper  told him that he would know soon enough. So Ulenspiegel left the inn  and continued on his way, running apace.    When he arrived at the outskirts of Damme, the dogs that stood by the  doorways came running round his legs, jumping up at him, yelping and  barking. Hearing this noise, the women also came out of their houses,  and when they saw who it was they all began talking at once.    \"Whence come you?\" they cried. \"And have you any news of your  father? And do you know where your mother is? Is she in prison  too? Alas! Heaven send they do not bring him to the stake!\"    Ulenspiegel ran on faster than ever. He met Nele.    \"Tyl,\" she said, \"you must not go home. They have set guards in our  house in the name of His Majesty.\"    Ulenspiegel stopped running.    \"Nele,\" he said, \"is it true that Claes, my father, is in prison?\"    \"It is true,\" Nele said, \"and Soetkin sits weeping at the gaol door.\"    Then the heart of the prodigal son swelled with grief, and he said:  \"I must go to them.\"    \"No,\" said Nele. \"First you must do what Claes told me, just before  he was taken away. 'Look to the money,' he said, 'it is hidden at the  back of the grate. You must make sure of that first of everything,  for it is the inheritance of poor Soetkin.'\"    But Ulenspiegel would not hear aught and ran on quickly to the  gaol. There he found Soetkin sitting at the gate. She embraced him  with many tears, and they cried on one another's neck.    Knowing that they were there, the populace began to crowd in front of  the prison. Then the sergeants arrived and told Soetkin and Ulenspiegel  that they were to go away at once. So mother and son returned to Nele's  cottage, which was next door to their own, and was being guarded by  one of the foot-soldiers who had been sent for from Bruges in case  there might be trouble during the trial and execution of Claes. For  it was well known that the people of Damme loved him exceedingly.    The soldier was sitting on the pavement in front of the door,  draining the last drops of brandy from a flask. Finding it was all  gone he threw the flask away and was amusing himself by dislodging  the stones on the path with the point of his dagger.    Soetkin went in to Katheline, crying most bitterly.    But Katheline said: \"Fire! Fire! Make a hole! My soul wants to  get out!\" And she kept wagging her head.              XXXIX      Borgstorm, the great bell of Damme, had summoned the judges to  judgment. It was four o'clock, and now they were collected together  at the Vierschare, around the Tree of Justice.    Claes was brought before them. Seated upon the dais was the high  bailiff of Damme, and by his side, opposite Claes, the mayor, the  alderman, and the clerk of the court.    The populace ran together at the sound of the bell. A great crowd  they were, and many of them were saying that the judges were there  to do--not justice--but merely the will of His Imperial Majesty....    After certain preliminaries, the high bailiff began to make  proclamation of the acts and deeds for which Claes had been summoned  before that tribunal.    \"The informer,\" he said, \"had been staying by chance at Damme, not  wishing to spend all his money at Bruges in feasting and festivity as  is too often the case during these sacred occasions. On a time, then,  when he was taking the air soberly on his own doorstep, he saw a man  walking towards him along the rue Heron. This man Claes also saw,  and went up to him and greeted him. The stranger, who was dressed  all in black, entered the house of Claes, leaving the door into the  street half open. Curious to find out who the man was, the informer  went into the vestibule, and heard Claes talking to the stranger in the  kitchen. The talk was all about a certain Josse, the brother of Claes,  who it seems had been made prisoner among the army of the Reformers,  and had suffered the punishment of being broken alive on the wheel  of torture, not far from Aix. The stranger said that he had brought  Claes a sum of money which his brother had desired to leave him, which  money having been gained from the ignorant and poverty-stricken, it  behoved Claes to spend it in bringing up his own son in the Reformed  Faith. He also urged Claes to quit the bosom of our Holy Mother  Church, and spake also many other impious words to which the only  reply vouchsafed by Claes was this: 'The cruel brutes! Alas, my poor  Josse!' So did the prisoner blaspheme against our Holy Father the Pope  and against His Royal Majesty, accusing them of cruelty in that they  rightly had punished heresy as a crime of treason against God and  man. When the stranger had finished the meal that Claes put before  him, our agent heard Claes cry out again: 'Alas, poor Josse! May God  keep thee in his glory! How cruel they were to thee!' And thus did he  accuse God himself of impiety by this suggestion that He could receive  a heretic into His heaven. Nor did Claes ever cease to cry aloud:  'Alas! Alas! My poor Josse!' The stranger then, launching out into  a frenzy, like a preacher beginning his sermon, fell to revile most  shamefully our Holy Mother the Church. 'She will fall,' he shouted,  'she will fall, the mighty Babylon, the whore of Rome, and she will  become the abode of demons, and the haunt of every bird accursed.' And  Claes meanwhile continued the same old cry: 'Cruel brutes! Alas, poor  Josse!' And the stranger went on in the same way as he had begun,  saying: 'Verily an angel shall appear that shall take a stone that  is great as a millstone, and shall cast it into the sea, crying:  \"Thus shall it be done to Babylon the mighty, and she shall be no  more seen.\"' Whereupon, 'Sir,' says Claes, 'your mouth is full of  bitterness; but tell me, when cometh that kingdom in which they  that are gentle of heart shall be able to dwell in peace upon the  earth?' 'Never,' answered the stranger, 'while yet my Lord Antichrist  rules, that is the Pope, who is to-day the enemy to all truth.' 'Ah,'  said Claes, 'you speak with little respect of the Holy Father. But  he, surely, is ignorant of the cruel punishments which are meted out  to poor Reformers.' 'Not at all,' answered the stranger, 'and far  from it, for it is he who initiates the decrees and causes them to  be put into force by the Emperor, now by the King. The latter enjoys  all the benefits of confiscation, inherits the property of the dead,  and finds it easy to bring charges of heresy against those who have  any wealth.' Claes said: 'Indeed I know that such things are freely  spoken of in the land of Flanders, and one may well believe them, for  the flesh of man is weak, even though the flesh be royal flesh. O my  poor Josse!' And by this did Claes give to understand that heretics  are punished because of a vile desire on the part of His Majesty for  filthy lucre. The stranger wished to argue the matter further, but  Claes said: 'Please, sir, do not let us continue this conversation,  for if it were overheard I might easily find myself involved in some  awkward inquiry.' Then Claes got up to go to the cellar, whence he  presently returned with a pot of beer. 'I am going to shut the door,'  said he, and after that the informer heard nothing more, for he had  to make his way out of the house as quickly as he could. Not till  it was night was the door again opened, and then the stranger came  forth. But he soon returned, knocking at the door and calling to Claes:  'It is very cold, and I know not where I am to lodge this night. Give  me shelter, pray. No one has seen me. The town is deserted.' Claes  welcomed him in, lit a lantern, and last of all he was seen to be  leading the heretic up the staircase into a little attic room with  a window that looked out on to the country.\"    At this Claes cried out: \"And who could have reported all this but  you, you wicked fishmonger! I saw you on Sunday, standing at your  door, as straight as a post, gazing up, like the hypocrite you are,  at the swallows in their flight!\"    And as he spoke, he pointed with his finger at Josse Grypstuiver,  the Dean of the Fishmongers, who showed his ugly phiz in the crowd  of people. And the fishmonger gave an evil smile when he saw Claes  betraying himself in this way. And the people in the crowd, men,  women, and maids, looked one at the other and said: \"P"]]]
