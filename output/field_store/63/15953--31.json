[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6753"],[0,"Psmith in the City (#20)"],[1,", the days passed very  quickly; and with his life after office-hours he had no fault to find  at all.    His life was very regular. He would arrive in the morning just in time  to sign his name in the attendance-book before it was removed to the  accountant's room. That was at ten o'clock. From ten to eleven he would  potter. There was nothing going on at that time in his department, and  Mr Waller seemed to take it for granted that he should stroll off to  the Postage Department and talk to Psmith, who had generally some fresh  grievance against the ring-wearing Bristow to air. From eleven to half  past twelve he would put in a little gentle work. Lunch, unless there  was a rush of business or Mr Waller happened to suffer from a spasm of  conscientiousness, could be spun out from half past twelve to two. More  work from two till half past three. From half past three till half past  four tea in the tearoom, with a novel. And from half past four till  five either a little more work or more pottering, according to whether  there was any work to do or not. It was by no means an unpleasant mode  of spending a late January day.    Then there was no doubt that it was an interesting little community,  that of the New Asiatic Bank. The curiously amateurish nature of the  institution lent a certain air of light-heartedness to the place. It  was not like one of those banks whose London office is their main  office, where stern business is everything and a man becomes a mere  machine for getting through a certain amount of routine work. The  employees of the New Asiatic Bank, having plenty of time on their  hands, were able to retain their individuality. They had leisure to  think of other things besides their work. Indeed, they had so much  leisure that it is a wonder they thought of their work at all.    The place was full of quaint characters. There was West, who had been  requested to leave Haileybury owing to his habit of borrowing horses  and attending meets in the neighbourhood, the same being always out of  bounds and necessitating a complete disregard of the rules respecting  evening chapel and lock-up. He was a small, dried-up youth, with black  hair plastered down on his head. He went about his duties in a costume  which suggested the sportsman of the comic papers.    There was also Hignett, who added to the meagre salary allowed him by  the bank by singing comic songs at the minor music halls. He confided  to Mike his intention of leaving the bank as soon as he had made a  name, and taking seriously to the business. He told him that he had  knocked them at the Bedford the week before, and in support of the  statement showed him a cutting from the Era, in which the writer said  that 'Other acceptable turns were the Bounding Zouaves, Steingruber's  Dogs, and Arthur Hignett.' Mike wished him luck.    And there was Raymond who dabbled in journalism and was the author of  'Straight Talks to Housewives' in _Trifles_, under the pseudonym  of 'Lady Gussie'; Wragge, who believed that the earth was flat, and  addressed meetings on the subject in Hyde Park on Sundays; and many  others, all interesting to talk to of a morning when work was slack and  time had to be filled in.    Mike found himself, by degrees, growing quite attached to the New  Asiatic Bank.    One morning, early in February, he noticed a curious change in Mr  Waller. The head of the Cash Department was, as a rule, mildly cheerful  on arrival, and apt (excessively, Mike thought, though he always  listened with polite interest) to relate the most recent sayings and  doings of his snub-nosed son, Edward. No action of this young prodigy  was withheld from Mike. He had heard, on different occasions, how he  had won a prize at his school for General Information (which Mike could  well believe); how he had trapped young Mr Richards, now happily  reconciled to Ada, with an ingenious verbal catch; and how he had made  a sequence of diverting puns on the name of the new curate, during the  course of that cleric's first Sunday afternoon visit.    On this particular day, however, the cashier was silent and  absent-minded. He answered Mike's good-morning mechanically, and  sitting down at his desk, stared blankly across the building. There  was a curiously grey, tired look on his face.    Mike could not make it out. He did not like to ask if there was  anything the matter. Mr Waller's face had the unreasonable effect on  him of making him feel shy and awkward. Anything in the nature of  sorrow always dried Mike up and robbed him of the power of speech.  Being naturally sympathetic, he had raged inwardly in many a crisis at  this devil of dumb awkwardness which possessed him and prevented him  from putting his sympathy into words. He had always envied the cooing  readiness of the hero on the stage when anyone was in trouble. He  wondered whether he would ever acquire that knack of pouring out a  limpid stream of soothing words on such occasions. At present he could  get no farther than a scowl and an almost offensive gruffness.    The happy thought struck him of consulting Psmith. It was his hour for  pottering, so he pottered round to the Postage Department, where he  found the old Etonian eyeing with disfavour a new satin tie which  Bristow was wearing that morning for the first time.    'I say, Smith,' he said, 'I want to speak to you for a second.'    Psmith rose. Mike led the way to a quiet corner of the Telegrams  Department.    'I tell you, Comrade Jackson,' said Psmith, 'I am hard pressed. The  fight is beginning to be too much for me. After a grim struggle, after  days of unremitting toil, I succeeded yesterday in inducing the man  Bristow to abandon that rainbow waistcoat of his. Today I enter the  building, blythe and buoyant, worn, of course, from the long struggle,  but seeing with aching eyes the dawn of another, better era, and there  is Comrade Bristow in a satin tie. It's hard, Comrade Jackson, it's  hard, I tell you.'    'Look here, Smith,' said Mike, 'I wish you'd go round to the Cash and  find out what's up with old Waller. He's got the hump about something.  He's sitting there looking absolutely fed up with things. I hope  there's nothing up. He's not a bad sort. It would be rot if anything  rotten's happened.'    Psmith began to display a gentle interest.    'So other people have troubles as well as myself,' he murmured  musingly. 'I had almost forgotten that. Comrade Waller's misfortunes  cannot but be trivial compared with mine, but possibly it will be as  well to ascertain their nature. I will reel round and make inquiries.'    'Good man,' said Mike. 'I'll wait here.'    Psmith departed, and returned, ten minutes later, looking more serious  than when he had left.    'His kid's ill, poor chap,' he said briefly. 'Pretty badly too, from  what I can gather. Pneumonia. Waller was up all night. He oughtn't to  be here at all today. He doesn't know what he's doing half the time.  He's absolutely fagged out. Look here, you'd better nip back and do as  much of the work as you can. I shouldn't talk to him much if I were  you. Buck along.'    Mike went. Mr Waller was still sitting staring out across the aisle.  There was something more than a little gruesome in the sight of him. He  wore a crushed, beaten look, as if all the life and fight had gone out  of him. A customer came to the desk to cash a cheque. The cashier  shovelled the money to him under the bars with the air of one whose  mind is elsewhere. Mike could guess what he was feeling, and what he  was thinking about. The fact that the snub-nosed Edward was, without  exception, the most repulsive small boy he had ever met in this world,  where repulsive small boys crowd and jostle one another, did not  interfere with his appreciation of the cashier's state of mind. Mike's  was essentially a sympathetic character. He had the gift of intuitive  understanding, where people of whom he was fond were concerned. It was  this which drew to him those who had intelligence enough to see beyond  his sometimes rather forbidding manner, and to realize that his blunt  speech was largely due to shyness. In spite of his prejudice against  Edward, he could put himself into Mr Waller's place, and see the thing  from his point of view.    Psmith's injunction to him not to talk much was unnecessary. Mike, as  always, was rendered utterly dumb by the sight of suffering. He sat at  his desk, occupying himself as best he could with the driblets of work  which came to him.    Mr Waller's silence and absentness continued unchanged. The habit of  years had made his work mechanical. Probably few of the customers who  came to cash cheques suspected that there was anything the matter with  the man who paid them their money. After all, most people look on the  cashier of a bank as a sort of human slot-machine. You put in your  cheque, and out comes money. It is no affair of yours whether life is  treating the machine well or ill that day.    The hours dragged slowly by till five o'clock struck, and the cashier,  putting on his coat and hat, passed silently out through the swing  doors. He walked listlessly. He was evidently tired out.    Mike shut his ledger with a vicious bang, and went across to find  Psmith. He was glad the day was over.          20. Concerning a Cheque      Things never happen quite as one expects them to. Mike came to the  office next morning prepared for a repetition of the previous day. He  was amazed to find the cashier not merely cheerful, but even  exuberantly cheerful. Edward, it appeared, had rallied in the  afternoon, and, when his father had got home, had been out of danger.  He was now going along excellently, and had stumped Ada, who was  nursing him, with a question about the Thirty Years' War, only a few  minutes before his father had left to catch his train. The cashier was  overflowing with happiness and goodwill towards his species. He greeted  customers with bright remarks on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6762"],[0,"Politics: A Treatise on Government (#20)"],[1,"very evident that men will endure many calamities for the sake  of living, as being something naturally sweet and desirable. It is easy  to point out the different modes of government, and we have already  settled them in our exoteric discourses. The power of the master, though  by nature equally serviceable, both to the master and to the slave, yet  nevertheless has for its object the benefit of the master, while the  benefit of the slave arises accidentally; for if the slave is destroyed,  the power of the master is at an end: but the authority which a man  has over his wife, and children, and his family, which we call domestic  government, is either for the benefit of those who are under subjection,  or else for the common benefit of the whole: but its particular object  is the benefit of the governed, as we see in other arts; in physic, for  instance, and the gymnastic exercises, wherein, if any benefit [1279a]  arise to the master, it is accidental; for nothing forbids the master of  the exercises from sometimes being himself one of those who exercises,  as the steersman is always one of the sailors; but both the master of  the exercises and the steersman consider the good of those who are under  their government. Whatever good may happen to the steersman when he is  a sailor, or to the master of the exercises when he himself makes one at  the games, is not intentional, or the object of their power; thus in all  political governments which are established to preserve and defend the  equality of the citizens it is held right to rule by turns. Formerly, as  was natural, every one expected that each of his fellow-citizens should  in his turn serve the public, and thus administer to his private good,  as he himself when in office had done for others; but now every one is  desirous of being continually in power, that he may enjoy the advantage  which he makes of public business and being in office; as if places were  a never-failing remedy for every complaint, and were on that account so  eagerly sought after.    It is evident, then, that all those governments which have a common good  in view are rightly established and strictly just, but those who have  in view only the good of the rulers are all founded on wrong principles,  and are widely different from what a government ought to be, for they  are tyranny over slaves, whereas a city is a community of freemen.          CHAPTER VII      Having established these particulars, we come to consider next the  different number of governments which there are, and what they are; and  first, what are their excellencies: for when we have determined this,  their defects will be evident enough.    It is evident that every form of government or administration, for the  words are of the same import, must contain a supreme power over the  whole state, and this supreme power must necessarily be in the hands  of one person, or a few, or many; and when either of these apply their  power for the common good, such states are well governed; but when the  interest of the one, the few, or the many who enjoy this power is alone  consulted, then ill; for you must either affirm that those who make  up the community are not citizens, or else let these share in the  advantages of government. We usually call a state which is governed by  one person for the common good, a kingdom; one that is governed by  more than one, but by a few only, an aristocracy; either because the  government is in the hands of the most worthy citizens, or because it  is the best form for the city and its inhabitants. When the citizens at  large govern for the public good, it is called a state; which is also  a common name for all other governments, and these distinctions are  consonant to reason; for it will not be difficult to find one person,  or a very few, of very distinguished abilities, but almost impossible to  meet with the majority [1279b] of a people eminent for every virtue;  but if there is one common to a whole nation it is valour; for this is  created and supported by numbers: for which reason in such a state  the profession of arms will always have the greatest share in the  government.    Now the corruptions attending each of these governments are these; a  kingdom may degenerate into a tyranny, an aristocracy into an oligarchy,  and a state into a democracy. Now a tyranny is a monarchy where the good  of one man only is the object of government, an oligarchy considers  only the rich, and a democracy only the poor; but neither of them have a  common good in view.          CHAPTER VIII      It will be necessary to enlarge a little more upon the nature of each  of these states, which is not without some difficulty, for he who would  enter into a philosophical inquiry into the principles of them, and not  content himself with a superficial view of their outward conduct, must  pass over and omit nothing, but explain the true spirit of each of them.  A tyranny then is, as has been said, a monarchy, where one person has  an absolute and despotic power over the whole community and every member  therein: an oligarchy, where the supreme power of the state is lodged  with the rich: a democracy, on the contrary, is where those have it who  are worth little or nothing. But the first difficulty that arises from  the distinctions which we have laid down is this, should it happen that  the majority of the inhabitants who possess the power of the state (for  this is a democracy) should be rich, the question is, how does this  agree with what we have said? The same difficulty occurs, should it ever  happen that the poor compose a smaller part of the people than the rich,  but from their superior abilities acquire the supreme power; for this is  what they call an oligarchy; it should seem then that our definition  of the different states was not correct: nay, moreover, could any one  suppose that the majority of the people were poor, and the minority  rich, and then describe the state in this manner, that an oligarchy  was a government in which the rich, being few in number, possessed the  supreme power, and that a democracy was a state in which the poor, being  many in number, possessed it, still there will be another difficulty;  for what name shall we give to those states we have been describing? I  mean, that in which the greater number are rich, and that in which the  lesser number are poor (where each of these possess the supreme power),  if there are no other states than those we have described. It seems  therefore evident to reason, that whether the supreme power is vested  in the hands of many or few may be a matter of accident; but that it  is clear enough, that when it is in the hands of the few, it will be  a government of the rich; when in the hands of the many, it will be a  government of the poor; since in all countries there are many poor and  few rich: it is not therefore the cause that has been already assigned  (namely, the number of people in power) that makes the difference  between the two governments; but an oligarchy and democracy differ in  this from each other, in the poverty of those who govern in the one,  and the riches I28oa of those who govern in the other; for when the  government is in the hands of the rich, be they few or be they more, it  is an oligarchy; when it is in the hands of the poor, it is a democracy:  but, as we have already said, the one will be always few, the other  numerous, but both will enjoy liberty; and from the claims of wealth and  liberty will arise continual disputes with each other for the lead in  public affairs.          CHAPTER IX      Let us first determine what are the proper limits of an oligarchy and  a democracy, and what is just in each of these states; for all men have  some natural inclination to justice; but they proceed therein only to  a certain degree; nor can they universally point out what is absolutely  just; as, for instance, what is equal appears just, and is so; but not  to all; only among those who are equals: and what is unequal appears  just, and is so; but not to all, only amongst those who are unequals;  which circumstance some people neglect, and therefore judge ill; the  reason for which is, they judge for themselves, and every one almost is  the worst judge in his own cause. Since then justice has reference to  persons, the same distinctions must be made with respect to persons  which are made with respect to things, in the manner that I have already  described in my Ethics.    As to the equality of the things, these they agree in; but their dispute  is concerning the equality of the persons, and chiefly for the reason  above assigned; because they judge ill in their own cause; and also  because each party thinks, that if they admit what is right in some  particulars, they have done justice on the whole: thus, for instance,  if some persons are unequal in riches, they suppose them unequal in the  whole; or, on the contrary, if they are equal in liberty, they suppose  them equal in the whole: but what is absolutely just they omit; for  if civil society was founded for the sake of preserving and increasing  property, every one's right in the city would be equal to his fortune;  and then the reasoning of those who insist upon an oligarchy would be  valid; for it would not be right that he who contributed one mina should  have an equal share in the hundred along with him who brought in all the  rest, either of the original money or what was afterwards acquired.    Nor was civil society founded merely to preserve the lives of its  members; but that they might live well: for otherwise a state might  be composed of slaves, or the animal creation: but this is not so; for  these have no share in the happiness of it; nor do they live after their  own choice; nor is it an alliance mutually to defend each other from  injuries, or for a commercial intercourse: for then the Tyrrhenians and  Carthaginians, and all other nations"]]]
