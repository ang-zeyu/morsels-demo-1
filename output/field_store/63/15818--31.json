In what respects is a valley glacier like a mountain stream which  flows out upon desert plains?    Two confluent glaciers do not mingle their currents as do two  confluent rivers. What characteristics of surface moraines prove  this fact?    What effect would you expect the laws of glacier motion to have on  the slant of the sides of transverse crevasses?    A trunk glacier has four medial moraines. Of how many tributaries  is it composed? Illustrate by diagram.    State all the evidences which you have found that glaciers move.    If a glacier melts back with occasional pauses up a valley, what  records are left of its retreat?    PIEDMONT GLACIERS    THE MALASPINA GLACIER. Piedmont (foot of the mountain) glaciers  are, as the name implies, ice fields formed at the foot of  mountains by the confluence of valley glaciers. The Malaspina  glacier of Alaska, the typical glacier of this kind, is seventy  miles wide and stretches for thirty miles from the foot of the  Mount Saint Elias range to the shore of the Pacific Ocean. The  valley glaciers which unite and spread to form this lake of ice  lie above the snow line and their moraines are concealed beneath  neve. The central area of the Malaspina is also free from debris;  but on the outer edge large quantities of englacial drift are  exposed by surface melting and form a belt of morainic waste a few  feet thick and several miles wide, covered in part with a  luxuriant forest, beneath which the ice is in places one thousand  feet in depth. The glacier here is practically stagnant, and lakes  a few hundred yards across, which could not exist were the ice in  motion and broken with crevasses, gather on their beds sorted  waste from the moraine. The streams which drain the glacier have  cut their courses in englacial and subglacial tunnels; none flow  for any distance on the surface. The largest, the Yahtse River,  issues from a high archway in the ice,--a muddy torrent one  hundred feet wide and twenty feet deep, loaded with sand and  stones which it deposits in a broad outwash plain (Fig. 110).  Where the ice has retreated from the sea there is left a hummocky  drift sheet with hollows filled with lakelets. These deposits help  to explain similar hummocky regions of drift and similar plains of  coarse, water-laid material often found in the drift-covered area  of the northeastern United States.    THE GEOLOGICAL WORK OF GLACIER ICE    The sluggish glacier must do its work in a different way from the  agile river. The mountain stream is swift and small, and its  channel occupies but a small portion of the valley. The glacier is  slow and big; its rate of motion may be less than a millionth of  that of running water over the same declivity, and its bulk is  proportionately large and fills the valley to great depth.  Moreover, glacier ice is a solid body plastic under slowly applied  stresses, while the water of rivers is a nimble fluid.    TRANSPORTATION. Valley glaciers differ from rivers as carriers in  that they float the major part of their load upon their surface,  transporting the heaviest bowlder as easily as a grain of sand;  while streams push and roll much of their load along their beds,  and their power of transporting waste depends solely upon their  velocity. The amount of the surface load of glaciers is limited  only by the amount of waste received from the mountain slopes  above them. The moving floor of ice stretched high across a valley  sweeps along as lateral moraines much of the waste which a  mountain stream would let accumulate in talus and alluvial cones.    While a valley glacier carries much of its load on top, an ice  sheet, such as that of Greenland, is free from surface debris,  except where moraines trail away from some nunatak. If at its edge  it breaks into separate glaciers which drain down mountain  valleys, these tongues of ice will carry the selvages of waste  common to valley glaciers. Both ice sheets and valley glaciers  drag on large quantities of rock waste in their ground moraines.    Stones transported by glaciers are sometimes called erratics. Such  are the bowlders of the drift of our northern states. Erratics may  be set down in an insecure position on the melting of the ice.    DEPOSIT. Little need be added here to what has already been said  of ground and terminal moraines. All strictly glacial deposits are  unstratified. The load laid down at the end of a glacier in the  terminal moraine is loose in texture, while the drift lodged  beneath the glacier as ground moraine is often an extremely dense,  stony clay, having been compacted under the pressure of the  overriding ice.    EROSION. A glacier erodes its bed and banks in two ways,--by  abrasion and by plucking.    The rock bed over which a glacier has moved is seen in places to  have been abraded, or ground away, to smooth surfaces which are  marked by long, straight, parallel scorings aligned with the line  of movement of the ice and varying in size from hair lines and  coarse scratches to exceptional furrows several feet deep. Clearly  this work has been accomplished by means of the sharp sand, the  pebbles, and the larger stones with which the base of the glacier  is inset, and which it holds in a firm grasp as running water  cannot. Hard and fine-grained rocks, such as granite and  quartzite, are often not only ground down to a smooth surface but  are also highly polished by means of fine rock flour worn from the  glacier bed.    In other places the bed of the glacier is rough and torn. The  rocks have been disrupted and their fragments have been carried  away,--a process known as PLUCKING. Moving under immense pressure  the ice shatters the rock, breaks off projections, presses into  crevices and wedges the rocks apart, dislodges the blocks into  which the rock is divided by joints and bedding planes, and  freezing fast to the fragments drags them on. In this work the  freezing and thawing of subglacial waters in any cracks and  crevices of the rock no doubt play an important part. Plucking  occurs especially where the bed rock is weak because of close  jointing. The product of plucking is bowlders, while the product  of abrasion is fine rock flour and sand.    Is the ground moraine of Figure 87 due chiefly to abrasion or to  plucking?    ROCHES MOUTONNEES AND ROUNDED HILLS. The prominences left between  the hollows due to plucking are commonly ground down and rounded  on the stoss side,--the side from which the ice advances,--and  sometimes on the opposite, the lee side, as well. In this way the  bed rock often comes to have a billowy surface known as roches  moutonnees (sheep rocks). Hills overridden by an ice sheet often  have similarly rounded contours on the stoss side, while on the  lee side they may be craggy, either because of plucking or because  here they have been less worn from their initial profile.    THE DIRECTION OF GLACIER MOVEMENT. The direction of the flow of  vanished glaciers and ice sheets is recorded both in the  differences just mentioned in the profiles of overridden hills and  also in the minute details of the glacier trail.    Flint nodules or other small prominences in the bed rock are found  more worn on the stoss than on the lee side, where indeed they may  have a low cone of rock protected by them from abrasion. Cavities,  on the other hand, have their edges worn on the lee side and left  sharp upon the stoss.    Surfaces worn and torn in the ways which we have mentioned are  said to be glaciated. But it must not be supposed that a glacier  everywhere glaciates its bed. Although in places it acts as a rasp  or as a pick, in others, and especially where its pressure is  least, as near the terminus, it moves over its bed in the manner  of a sled. Instances are known where glaciers have advanced over  deposits of sand and gravel without disturbing them to any notable  degree. Like a river, a glacier does not everywhere erode. In  places it leaves its bed undisturbed and in places aggrades it by  deposits of the ground moraine.    CIRQUES. Valley glaciers commonly head as we have seen, in broad  amphitheaters deeply filled with snow and ice. On mountains now  destitute of glaciers, but whose glaciation shows that they have  supported glaciers in the past, there are found similar crescentic  hollows with high, precipitous walls and glaciated floors. Their  floors are often basined and hold lakelets whose deep and quiet  waters reflect the sheltering ramparts of rugged rock which tower  far above them. Such mountain hollows are termed CIRQUES. As a  powerful spring wears back a recess in the valley side where it  discharges, so the fountain head of a glacier gradually wears back  a cirque. In its slow movement the neve field broadly scours its  bed to a flat or basined floor. Meanwhile the sides of the valley  head are steepened and driven back to precipitous walls. For in  winter the crevasse of the bergschrund which surrounds the neve  field is filled with snow and the neve is frozen fast to the rocky  sides of the valley. In early summer the neve tears itself free,  dislodging and removing any loosened blocks, and the open fissure  of the bergschrund allows frost and other agencies of weathering  to attack the unprotected rock. As cirques are thus formed and  enlarged the peaks beneath which they lie are sharpened, and the  mountain crests are scalloped and cut back from either side to  knife-edged ridges.    In the western mountains of the United States many cirques, now  empty of neve and glacier ice, and known locally as \"basins,\"  testify to the fact that in recent times the snow line stood  beneath the levels of their floors, and thus far below its present  altitude.    GLACIER TROUGHS.

In spite of my supplications, they drew no nearer in, and  what frightened me most of all, the new man tee-hee'd with laughter as  he talked and looked at me.    Then he stood up in the boat and addressed me a long while, speaking  fast and with many wavings of his hand. I told him I had no Gaelic; and  at this he became very angry, and I began to suspect he thought he was  talking English. Listening very close, I caught the word \"whateffer\"  several times; but all the rest was Gaelic and might have been Greek and  Hebrew for me.    \"Whatever,\" said I, to show him I had caught a word.    \"Yes, yes--yes, yes,\" says he, and then he looked at the other men, as  much as to say, \"I told you I spoke English,\" and began again as hard as  ever in the Gaelic.    This time I picked out another word, \"tide.\" Then I had a flash of hope.  I remembered he was always waving his hand towards the mainland of the  Ross.    \"Do you mean when the tide is out--?\" I cried, and could not finish.    \"Yes, yes,\" said he. \"Tide.\"    At that I turned tail upon their boat (where my adviser had once more  begun to tee-hee with laughter), leaped back the way I had come, from  one stone to another, and set off running across the isle as I had never  run before. In about half an hour I came out upon the shores of the  creek; and, sure enough, it was shrunk into a little trickle of water,  through which I dashed, not above my knees, and landed with a shout on  the main island.    A sea-bred boy would not have stayed a day on Earraid; which is only  what they call a tidal islet, and except in the bottom of the neaps, can  be entered and left twice in every twenty-four hours, either dry-shod,  or at the most by wading. Even I, who had the tide going out and in  before me in the bay, and even watched for the ebbs, the better to get  my shellfish--even I (I say) if I had sat down to think, instead of  raging at my fate, must have soon guessed the secret, and got free. It  was no wonder the fishers had not understood me. The wonder was rather  that they had ever guessed my pitiful illusion, and taken the trouble to  come back. I had starved with cold and hunger on that island for close  upon one hundred hours. But for the fishers, I might have left my bones  there, in pure folly. And even as it was, I had paid for it pretty dear,  not only in past sufferings, but in my present case; being clothed like  a beggar-man, scarce able to walk, and in great pain of my sore throat.    I have seen wicked men and fools, a great many of both; and I believe  they both get paid in the end; but the fools first.          CHAPTER XV    THE LAD WITH THE SILVER BUTTON: THROUGH THE ISLE OF MULL    The Ross of Mull, which I had now got upon, was rugged and trackless,  like the isle I had just left; being all bog, and brier, and big stone.  There may be roads for them that know that country well; but for my part  I had no better guide than my own nose, and no other landmark than Ben  More.    I aimed as well as I could for the smoke I had seen so often from the  island; and with all my great weariness and the difficulty of the way  came upon the house in the bottom of a little hollow about five or  six at night. It was low and longish, roofed with turf and built of  unmortared stones; and on a mound in front of it, an old gentleman sat  smoking his pipe in the sun.    With what little English he had, he gave me to understand that my  shipmates had got safe ashore, and had broken bread in that very house  on the day after.    \"Was there one,\" I asked, \"dressed like a gentleman?\"    He said they all wore rough great-coats; but to be sure, the first of  them, the one that came alone, wore breeches and stockings, while the  rest had sailors' trousers.    \"Ah,\" said I, \"and he would have a feathered hat?\"    He told me, no, that he was bareheaded like myself.    At first I thought Alan might have lost his hat; and then the rain came  in my mind, and I judged it more likely he had it out of harm's way  under his great-coat. This set me smiling, partly because my friend was  safe, partly to think of his vanity in dress.    And then the old gentleman clapped his hand to his brow, and cried out  that I must be the lad with the silver button.    \"Why, yes!\" said I, in some wonder.    \"Well, then,\" said the old gentleman, \"I have a word for you, that you  are to follow your friend to his country, by Torosay.\"    He then asked me how I had fared, and I told him my tale. A  south-country man would certainly have laughed; but this old gentleman  (I call him so because of his manners, for his clothes were dropping off  his back) heard me all through with nothing but gravity and pity. When I  had done, he took me by the hand, led me into his hut (it was no better)  and presented me before his wife, as if she had been the Queen and I a  duke.    The good woman set oat-bread before me and a cold grouse, patting my  shoulder and smiling to me all the time, for she had no English; and the  old gentleman (not to be behind) brewed me a strong punch out of their  country spirit. All the while I was eating, and after that when I was  drinking the punch, I could scarce come to believe in my good fortune;  and the house, though it was thick with the peat-smoke and as full of  holes as a colander, seemed like a palace.    The punch threw me in a strong sweat and a deep slumber; the good people  let me lie; and it was near noon of the next day before I took the road,  my throat already easier and my spirits quite restored by good fare and  good news. The old gentleman, although I pressed him hard, would take no  money, and gave me an old bonnet for my head; though I am free to own I  was no sooner out of view of the house than I very jealously washed this  gift of his in a wayside fountain.    Thought I to myself: \"If these are the wild Highlanders, I could wish my  own folk wilder.\"    I not only started late, but I must have wandered nearly half the time.  True, I met plenty of people, grubbing in little miserable fields that  would not keep a cat, or herding little kine about the bigness of asses.  The Highland dress being forbidden by law since the rebellion, and the  people condemned to the Lowland habit, which they much disliked, it was  strange to see the variety of their array. Some went bare, only for a  hanging cloak or great-coat, and carried their trousers on their backs  like a useless burthen: some had made an imitation of the tartan with  little parti-coloured stripes patched together like an old wife's quilt;  others, again, still wore the Highland philabeg, but by putting a few  stitches between the legs transformed it into a pair of trousers like  a Dutchman's. All those makeshifts were condemned and punished, for the  law was harshly applied, in hopes to break up the clan spirit; but in  that out-of-the-way, sea-bound isle, there were few to make remarks and  fewer to tell tales.    They seemed in great poverty; which was no doubt natural, now that  rapine was put down, and the chiefs kept no longer an open house;  and the roads (even such a wandering, country by-track as the one  I followed) were infested with beggars. And here again I marked  a difference from my own part of the country. For our Lowland  beggars--even the gownsmen themselves, who beg by patent--had a louting,  flattering way with them, and if you gave them a plaek and asked change,  would very civilly return you a boddle. But these Highland beggars stood  on their dignity, asked alms only to buy snuff (by their account) and  would give no change.    To be sure, this was no concern of mine, except in so far as it  entertained me by the way. What was much more to the purpose, few had  any English, and these few (unless they were of the brotherhood of  beggars) not very anxious to place it at my service. I knew Torosay  to be my destination, and repeated the name to them and pointed; but  instead of simply pointing in reply, they would give me a screed of the  Gaelic that set me foolish; so it was small wonder if I went out of my  road as often as I stayed in it.    At last, about eight at night, and already very weary, I came to a lone  house, where I asked admittance, and was refused, until I bethought  me of the power of money in so poor a country, and held up one of my  guineas in my finger and thumb. Thereupon, the man of the house, who had  hitherto pretended to have no English, and driven me from his door by  signals, suddenly began to speak as clearly as was needful, and agreed  for five shillings to give me a night's lodging and guide me the next  day to Torosay.    I slept uneasily that night, fearing I should be robbed; but I might  have spared myself the pain; for my host was no robber, only miserably  poor and a great cheat. He was not alone in his poverty; for the next  morning, we must go five miles about to the house of what he called a  rich man to have one of my guineas changed. This was perhaps a rich man  for Mull; he would have scarce been thought so in the south; for it  took all he had--the whole house was turned upside down, and a neighbour  brought under contribution, before he could scrape together twenty  shillings in silver. The odd shilling he kept for himself, protesting he  could ill afford to have so great a sum of money lying \"locked up.\" For  all that he was very courteous and well spoken, made us both sit down  with his family to dinner, and brewed punch in a fine china bowl, over  which my rascal guide grew so merry that he refused to start.    I was for getting angry, and appealed to the rich man (Hector Maclean  was his name), who had been a witness to our bargain and to my payment  of the five shillings. But Maclean had taken his share of the punch,  and vowed that no gentleman should leave his table after the bowl was  brewed; so there was nothing for it but to sit and hear Jacobite toasts  and Gaelic songs, till all "]]]
