The three subspecies in the state are _R. f. intermedias_ in the  northern half, _R. f. griseoflavus_ in the high parts of the Sierra  Madre Oriental, and _R. f. tropicalis_ in the southeast. The lines  between these subspecies are difficult to establish because the zones  of intergradation are broad. Characters for separating the three  subspecies in Tamaulipas are listed by Hooper (1952).      =Reithrodontomys fulvescens griseoflavus= Merriam         1901. _Reithrodontomys griseoflavus_ Merriam, Proc.

Only specimens from Jaumave are clearly _R. f. griseoflavus_; all  others east of this locality are intergrades between _griseoflavus_ and  _tropicalis_, under which latter subspecies they are included. In  _griseoflavus_ the tail is longer in relation to the head and body,  141.2 (135-153) per cent, than in the other two subspecies that occur  in Tamaulipas. The average weight of 14 males was 14 (12-16) grams.         _Record of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 15, from       Jaumave, 2400 ft.      =Reithrodontomys fulvescens intermedius= J. A.

Fauna, 36:47, June 5.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Northern half of state.    No specimen of this subspecies has been examined. Jones and Anderson  (1958:447) reported specimens from Rancho Pano Ayuctle as _R. f.  intermedius_, but here those same specimens are assigned to _R. f.  tropicalis_. J. A. Allen (1891:223) recorded specimens from Santa  Teresa as _Ochetodon mexicanus_. According to Hooper (1952:142) that  name was used by Allen for _R. fulvescens_. Allen's specimens from  Santa Teresa are here referred to _R. f. intermedius_ on geographic  grounds.         _Records_ (Hooper, 1952:108): Camargo, 200 ft.; 20 mi.

Mamm., 25:393, December 12, type from Boca del Rio, 8 km. S       city of Veracruz, Veracruz.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Tropical area in southeastern       part of state.    Most of the specimens examined of _R. fulvescens_ are included in this  subspecies, principally because of their reddish coloration that is  characteristic of _R. f. tropicalis_. According to the original  description by Davis (1944:393) this subspecies is smaller than  _griseoflavus_ and the posterior border of the incisive foramina  terminate anterior to the plane of the molars. But, these  characteristics are not found in any specimen examined from Tamaulipas  and the average of external measurements is more than those given by  Hooper (1952:109) for _tropicalis_. Of all specimens from Tamaulipas,  those from the vicinity of Altamira and Tampico are most nearly typical  of _tropicalis_. Weights of seven males and five females, from the  Sierra de Tamaulipas, were, respectively, 13 (11-15), and 11 (9-14)  grams.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 51: Rancho       Santa Rosa, 25 km.

As noted before, J. A. Allen (1891:223) reported specimens from Rancho  Santa Rosa as _Ochetodon mexicanus_, but he used this name for the  species now known as _R. fulvescens_.

It and _Liomys irroratus_ are the two rodents most easily  trapped throughout the state. In general _P. l. texanus_ occurs in  forested and brushy areas especially under 1200 feet in elevation, as  was noted in the Sierra de Tamaulipas, where _P. l. texanus_ was taken  commonly at elevations of up to 1200 feet. Above this elevation the  species"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39421"],[0,"Mount Everest, the Reconnaissance, 1921 (#20)"],[1,"ach, and we  could get no information about the route. A little further on we came  across more villages, in one of which, with much difficulty and after a  long chase, we captured a man and made him guide us to the village of  Chulungphu, where we decided to stop the night. After a little time we  induced some of the villagers to come out from their hiding-places, and  to produce tents and fuel for us. The camp was pitched in a field of  sweet-scented primulas near the village. The architecture of these  houses was quite different from what we had met before--they all appear  to be strongly fortified, as they have practically no windows and there  are only small loopholes facing outwards. They are all built of a brown  stone--a kind of gneiss, and have sods on the parapet over which are  laid branches of juniper. The next morning we woke to the sound of  pattering rain and found all the hills wreathed in grey mist. This was  their first rain this year, so the inhabitants told us. It was pleasant  to one's skin after the dry climate and biting winds that we had been  experiencing on the other side of the passes to feel oneself wrapped in  a softer and milder air. We rode down this valley for about 6 miles  until it debouched into the main Arun Valley. The people, however, do  not know it by this name here, but call it still the Bhong-chu until it  reaches Nepal. We passed villages all the way, villages brown in colour  and built of a brown gneiss, around which grew fields of barley and  mustard. After the barren valleys which we had left, these appeared very  fertile; rose and currant bushes surrounded every field, while the  hillsides were covered with juniper and willows. Along the path grew  spiraeas and clematis, while beside every watercourse were yellow marsh  marigolds and primulas. A feature of the Arun Valley, which was fairly  wide here, was the old terraces on its slopes, now all covered with  barley, pea and mustard fields, the latter being a blaze of yellow.  There were many villages here and some pleasant country houses  surrounded by groves of willows and poplars. Down here the people were  not quite so frightened of us as they were in the valley from which we  had just come, where they had run away from us whenever we approached.  The Bong-chu here is a large river with a very great flow of water, and  quite unfordable. The nearest place where it could be crossed is at a  rope bridge some 18 miles higher up, and during the rainy season this  bridge is impassable, and communication with the other side completely  cut off. To the South and close by, at a height of 12,000 feet, the  Bhong-chu enters a terrific gorge on either side of which tower up great  cliffs with snowy peaks high above them. On some of the slopes which are  not quite so steep there are thick forests of fir trees and  rhododendrons where, I was told, the muskdeer lived. After descending  the valley for 3 miles, we turned up a side valley pointing Westwards.  Down this flowed a very large and unfordable glacial stream. This  evidently came down from the neighbourhood of Mount Everest, but local  information as to its source was very vague, and it was evident that we  should have to prospect for ourselves. Some 3 miles up this valley we  came to a place called by the natives Kharta Shika, where the Governor  of the Kharta District resides. Kharta was not apparently a village at  all, but a district including a number of small villages. We halted a  short distance below Kharta Shika and presently the Governor came out to  meet us with a present of sweetmeats and the usual scarf. He apologised  for not meeting us before, as he said that he had no information as to  the date of our arrival. He begged that we would come over to his garden  where he had ordered a fine Chinese tent to be pitched for us. We  crossed the river by a wooden bridge, and after going through the  village came to the Governor's house. Crossing through the courtyard we  entered his garden, which lay in a nice sheltered spot surrounded by  willow trees with a stream of clear water running through it. Big wild  roses grew there and a few European flowers that he had planted, while  under a very ancient poplar there was a large painted prayer wheel, some  8 feet high, which was turned by a stream of water. Here in his garden  he provided us with a meal of excellent macaroni and a very hot chilli  salad. It was very pleasant to rest the eyes on the luscious green of  the well irrigated garden, and to be for once sheltered from the wind.  During the night we were awakened by a regular shower bath. The Chinese  tent, beautiful as it was in outward appearance, was sadly lacking in  waterproof qualities. As it rained steadily most of the night, we had to  take cover under our mackintoshes on which were pools of water in the  morning. There seemed to be no doubt that the proper Monsoon had at last  broken, and the Jongpen himself told us that this was the first really  heavy rain that they had had. All the people considered that we had  brought this rain with us and were very grateful in consequence; later  on, when we left, they begged us not to stop the rain, as they wanted it  badly for their crops.    As it cleared up a little about nine o'clock in the morning, though the  hills were still all in cloud, we rode out with Chheten Wangdi, the  Jongpen and Hopaphema, who was the largest landowner about here, to look  out for a site for our next base camp. We wanted, if possible, to get a  house that could be used as a store-room and also for photographic  purposes. We rode down into the main valley, and after looking over  several houses, we eventually selected one on an old river terrace with  fine views all around and standing quite by itself well away from any  village. The water supply was good and handy, and there was a pleasant  garden of poplars and willows, in which we could pitch our tents. After  a certain amount of bargaining, the owners were willing to let us have  the house and the garden for the large rent of one trangka (31/2_d._) a  day. It was apparently the first time anyone in that valley had ever  wanted to rent a house, and there were no house agents there to run one  up into exorbitant prices. We then rode on to Hopaphema's house, which  was a fine solidly built dwelling surrounded by large juniper trees,  willows and poplars. Later on we got to know this man very well, and  used to call him always the \"Sergeant,\" as he was supposed to do any  recruiting for the Tibetan army that was needed in that valley. He had a  very kindly disposition, was always very hospitable, and had a great  sense of humour. He had a tent pitched for our reception under a very  old poplar with a grass plot in front surrounded by bushes of wild red  roses. Here we were given tea, milk and beer, and then the usual  macaroni and mince was produced. On leaving, he insisted on my taking  away a large quantity of turnip leaves, as he knew I was very fond of  green food, and they made an excellent \"spinach.\" The Tibetans that we  met have invariably proved very kindly and hospitable.    On returning to Kharta, where I had left Heron, I found that it had been  raining all the time, though in the main valley we had had it quite  fine. In the evening I took a walk up to an old fort not far from our  camp. This fort in old days had commanded the only path from here that  led into Nepal, but now it had all fallen into ruin. Close by it,  however, was a delightful dell full of hoary willow trees, underneath  which the ground was carpeted with yellow primulas growing among the  bushes of scarlet roses. Near by were two old poplar trees, whose trunks  measured between 20 and 30 feet in circumference and were evidently of a  very great age. The primulas everywhere were really astonishing. They  outlined every watercourse with yellow and often grew between 2 and 3  feet high with enormous heads of sweet cowslip-scented yellow flowers.  It rained again during the whole of the night, and the fine spray that  came through the Chinese tent made sleep rather difficult. The next  morning we started to go back to Tingri, and for the first day's march  were given coolies for our transport. In this district coolies are used  a great deal as all the trade with Nepal has to be carried on by them,  the paths over the passes being quite impassable for pack transport;  the Jongpen told us that we would find them quite as fast as ponies.    To-day's march was to Lumeh--a distance of about 17 miles--and the  coolies arrived very soon after we did, having come along  extraordinarily well. Our route for the first 3 miles was down the  Kharta Valley until it joined the valley of the Bhong-chu; we then  followed the right bank of this for some 10 miles. On the way we stopped  at the house of Hopaphema, who insisted on giving us a meal of milk,  macaroni and mince, although it was only just over an hour since we had  had breakfast. On our departure he gave us a basket of eggs and some  more turnip leaves to take along with us, and altogether showed himself  a most friendly and hospitable host. At first we rode through fields of  barley, peas and mustard for several miles, the valley then became much  more barren and the path occasionally was taken high up on the face of a  cliff, where the river swept round close beneath the mountain side. At  other times we crossed broad stony terraces. We came eventually to the  village of Dak, where the monks from the monastery had pitched tents for  us and had another meal provided for us. Coolies had to be changed here,  our old coolies arriving while we were having our meal; after the loads  had been transferred, our new transport proceeded along to Lumeh, where  we intended to spend the night. The path after Dak was in places  dangerous owing to falling stones, and our guide every now and then  urged us to hurry, as owing to the heavy rain of the preceding"]]]
