Adieu! I embrace  from my heart--cart, my dear sister--blister, and am your dutiful and  attached son,    WOLFGANG AMADE MOZART,    Knight of the Golden Spur, Member of the great Verona Academy,  Bologna--oui, mon ami!        79.    Mannheim, Nov. 26, 1777. --MOREOVER, every one acquainted with Mannheim,  even the nobility, advised me to come here. The reason why we are still  in this place is that I have some thoughts of remaining the winter here,  and I am only waiting for an answer from the Elector to decide my plans.  The Intendant, Count Savioli, is a very worthy gentleman, and I told  him to inform the Elector that, this being such severe weather for  travelling, I am willing to remain here to teach the young Count [Carl  Theodor's son]. He promised me to do his best for me, but said that I  must have patience till the gala days were over. All this took place  with the consent and at the SUGGESTION of Cannabich. When I told him  that I had spoken to Savioli and what I had said, he replied he really  thought it was more likely to be brought about than not. Indeed,  Cannabich spoke to the Elector on the subject before the Count did  so; and now I must wait to hear the result. I am going to call on Herr  Schmalz to draw my 150 florins, for my landlord would no doubt prefer  the sound of gold to that of music. I little thought that I should have  the gift of a watch here, [see No. 74,] but such is again the case. I  would have been off long ago, but every one says to me, \"Where do you  intend to go for the winter? Travelling is detestable in such weather;  stay here.\" Cannabich also wishes it very much; so now I have taken  steps to do so, and as such an affair cannot be hurried, I must wait  with patience, and I hope soon to be able to send you good news. I have  already two pupils certain, besides the ARCH ones, who certainly won't  give me less than a louis each monthly. Without these I could not indeed  manage to remain. Now let the matter rest as it is, or as it may be,  what avail useless speculations? What is to occur we do not know; still  in so far we do! what God wills!    Now for a cheerful allegro--non siete si pegro. [Footnote: \"Don't be so  desponding.\"] If we do leave this, we shall go straight to--where? To  Weilburg, or whatever the name of the place may be, to the Princess,  sister of the Prince of Orange, whom we knew so well at the Hague. There  we shall stay--N. B., so long as we like the officers' table, and no  doubt receive at least six louis-d'or.    A few days ago Herr Sterkel came here from Wurzburg. The day before  yesterday, the 24th, I dined with Cannabich's, and again at Oberstjager  von Hagen's, and spent the evening al solito with Cannabich, where  Sterkel joined us, [Footnote: Abbe Sterkel, a favorite composer and  virtuoso on the piano, whom Beethoven, along with Simrock, Ries, and  the two Rombergs, visited in the autumn of 1791, in Aschaffenberg.]  and played five duets [sonatas with violin], but so quick that it was  difficult to follow the music, and neither distinctly nor in time. Every  one said the same. Madlle. Cannabich played my six sonatas, and in fact  better than Sterkel. I must now conclude, for I cannot write in bed, and  I am too sleepy to sit up any longer.        80.    Mannheim, Nov. 29, 1777.    I RECEIVED this morning your letter of the 24th, and perceive that you  cannot reconcile yourself to the chances of good or bad fortune, if,  indeed, the latter is to befall us. Hitherto, we four have neither been  very lucky nor very unlucky, for which I thank God. You make us many  reproaches which we do not deserve. We spend nothing but what is  absolutely necessary, and as to what is required on a journey, you know  that as well or better than we do. No one BUT MYSELF has been the cause  of our remaining so long in Munich; and had I been alone I should have  stayed there altogether. Why were we fourteen days in Augsburg? Surely  you cannot have got my letters from there? I wished to give a concert.  They played me false, so I thus lost eight days. I was absolument  determined to go away, but was not allowed, so strong was the wish that  I should give a concert. I wished to be urged to do so, and I was urged.  I gave the concert; this accounts for the fourteen days. Why did we go  direct to Mannheim? This I answered in my last letter. Why are we still  here? How can you suppose that I would stay here without good cause? But  my father, at all events, should--Well! you shall hear my reasons and  the whole course of the affair; but I had quite resolved not to write to  you on the subject until I could say something decided, (which even yet  I cannot do,) on purpose to avoid causing you care and anxiety, which I  always strive to do, for I knew that uncertain intelligence would only  fret you. But when you ascribe this to my negligence, thoughtlessness,  and indolence, I can only regret your having such an opinion of me,  and from my heart grieve that you so little know your son. I am not  careless, I am only prepared for the worst; so I can wait and bear  everything patiently, so long as my honor and my good name of Mozart  remain uninjured. But if it must be so, so let it be. I only beg that  you will neither rejoice nor lament prematurely; for whatever may  happen, all will be well if we only have health; for happiness  exists--merely in the imagination.    Last Thursday week I went in the forenoon to wait on Count Savioli, and  asked him if it were possible to induce the Elector to keep me here this  winter, as I was anxious to give lessons to his children. His answer  was, \"I will suggest it to the Elector, and if it depends on me, the  thing will certainly be done.\" In the afternoon I went to Cannabich's,  and as I had gone to Savioli by his advice, he immediately asked me if I  had been there. I told him everything, on which he said, \"I should like  you very much to spend the winter with us, but still more to see you in  some permanent situation.\" I replied, \"I could wish nothing better than  to be settled near you, but I don't see how it is possible. You have  already two Capellmeisters, so I don't know what I could have, for I  would not be subordinate to Vogler.\" \"That you would never be,\" said  he. \"Here not one of the orchestra is under the Capellmeister, nor  even under the Intendant. The Elector might appoint you Chamber Court  composer; only wait a little, and I will speak to Count Savioli on the  subject.\" On the Thursday after there was a grand concert. When the  Count saw me, he apologized for not having yet spoken to the Elector,  these being still gala days; but as soon as they were over (next Monday)  he would certainly speak to his Royal Highness. I let three days pass,  and, still hearing nothing whatever, I went to him to make inquiries. He  said, \"My good M. Mozart, (this was yesterday, Friday,) today there was  a chasse, so it was impossible for me to ask the Elector, but to-morrow  at this hour I will certainly give you an answer.\" I begged him not  to forget it. To tell you the truth, when I left him I felt rather  indignant, so I resolved to take with me the easiest of my six  variations of the Fischer minuet, (which I wrote here for this express  purpose,) to present to the young Count, in order to have an opportunity  to speak to the Elector myself. When I went there, you cannot conceive  the delight of the governess, by whom I was most politely received.  When I produced the variations, and said that they were intended for  the young Count, she said, \"Oh! that is charming, but I hope you have  something for the Countess also.\" \"Nothing as yet,\" said I, \"but if I  stay here long enough to have time to write something I will do so.\" \"A  propos,\" said she, \"I am so glad that you stay the winter here.\" \"I? I  have not heard a word of it.\" \"That does surprise me; how very odd!  for the Elector told me so himself lately; he said, 'By the by, Mozart  remains here all winter.'\" \"Well, when he said so, he was the only man  who could say so, for without the Elector I of course cannot remain  here;\" and then I told her the whole story. We agreed that I should come  the next day (that is, to-day) at four o'clock, and bring some piece of  music for the Countess. She was to speak to the Elector before I came;  and I should be certain to meet him. I went today, but he had not been  there at all; but I shall go again to-morrow. I have written a Rondo for  the Countess. Have I not then sufficient cause to stay here and await  the result? As this important step is finally taken, ought I at this  moment to set off? I have now an opportunity of speaking to the Elector  myself. I shall most probably spend the winter here, for I am a favorite  with his Royal Highness, who thinks highly of me, and knows what I can  do. I hope to be able to give you good news in my next letter. I entreat  you once more neither to rejoice nor to be uneasy too soon, and not to  confide the affair to any one except Herr Bullinger and my sister. I  send my sister the allegro and the andante of the sonata I wrote for  Madlle. Cannabich. The Rondo will follow shortly; the packet would have  been too heavy had I sent it with the others. You must be satisfied with  the original, for you "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5308"],[0,"The Paradise Mystery (#20)"],[1," foot of it, his back comfortably planted  against the angle of a projecting buttress, sat a man, evidently fast  asleep in the warmth of those powerful rays. His head leaned down and  forward over his chest, his hands were folded across his waist, his  whole attitude was that of a man who, having eaten and drunken in the  open air, has dropped off to sleep. That he had so dropped off while  in the very act of smoking was evident from the presence of a short,  well-blackened clay pipe which had fallen from his lips and lay in the  grass beside him. Near the pipe, spread on a coloured handkerchief, were  the remains of his dinner--Bryce's quick eye noticed fragments of bread,  cheese, onions. And close by stood one of those tin bottles in which  labouring men carry their drink; its cork, tied to the neck by a piece  of string, dangled against the side. A few yards away, a mass of fallen  rubbish and a shovel and wheelbarrow showed at what the sleeper had been  working when his dinner-hour and time for rest had arrived.    Something unusual, something curiously noticeable--yet he could not  exactly tell what--made Bryce go closer to the sleeping man. There was  a strange stillness about him--a rigidity which seemed to suggest  something more than sleep. And suddenly, with a stifled exclamation,  he bent forward and lifted one of the folded hands. It dropped like a  leaden weight when Bryce released it, and he pushed back the man's face  and looked searchingly into it. And in that instant he knew that for  the second time within a fortnight he had found a dead man in Wrychester  Paradise.    There was no doubt whatever that the man was dead. His hands and body  were warm enough--but there was not a flicker of breath; he was as dead  as any of the folk who lay six feet beneath the old gravestones around  him. And Bryce's practised touch and eye knew that he was only just  dead--and that he had died in his sleep. Everything there pointed  unmistakably to what had happened. The man had eaten his frugal dinner,  washed it down from his tin bottle, lighted his pipe, leaned back in the  warm sunlight, dropped asleep--and died as quietly as a child taken from  its play to its slumbers.    After one more careful look, Bryce turned and made through the trees  to the path which crossed the old graveyard. And there, going leisurely  home to lunch, was Dick Bewery, who glanced at the young doctor  inquisitively.    \"Hullo!\" he exclaimed with the freedom of youth towards something not  much older. \"You there? Anything on?\"    Then he looked more clearly, seeing Bryce to be pale and excited. Bryce  laid a hand on the lad's arm.    \"Look here!\" he said. \"There's something wrong--again!--in here. Run  down to the police-station--get hold of Mitchington--quietly, you  understand!--bring him here at once. If he's not there, bring somebody  else--any of the police. But--say nothing to anybody but them.\"    Dick gave him another swift look, turned, and ran. And Bryce went back  to the dead man--and picked up the tin bottle, and making a cup of his  left hand poured out a trickle of the contents. Cold tea!--and, as far  as he could judge, nothing else. He put the tip of his little finger  into the weak-looking stuff, and tasted--it tasted of nothing but a  super-abundance of sugar.    He stood there, watching the dead man until the sound of footsteps  behind him gave warning of the return of Dick Bewery, who, in another  minute, hurried through the bushes, followed by Mitchington. The boy  stared in silence at the still figure, but the inspector, after a hasty  glance, turned a horrified face on Bryce.    \"Good Lord!\" he gasped. \"It's Collishaw!\"    Bryce for the moment failed to comprehend this, and Mitchington shook  his head.    \"Collishaw!\" he repeated. \"Collishaw, you know! The man I told you about  yesterday afternoon. The man that said--\"    Mitchington suddenly checked himself, with a glance at Dick Bewery.    \"I remember--now,\" said Bryce. \"The mason's labourer! So--this is the  man, eh? Well, Mitchington, he's dead!--I found him dead, just now. I  should say he'd been dead five to ten minutes--not more. You'd better  get help--and I'd like another medical man to see him before he's  removed.\"    Mitchington looked again at Dick.    \"Perhaps you'd fetch Dr. Ransford, Mr--Richard?\" he asked. \"He's  nearest.\"    \"Dr. Ransford's not at home,\" said Dick. \"He went to Highminster--some  County Council business or other--at ten this morning, and he won't be  back until four--I happen to know that. Shall I run for Dr. Coates?\"    \"If you wouldn't mind,\" said Mitchington, \"and as it's close by, drop in  at the station again and tell the sergeant to come here with a couple of  men. I say!\" he went on, when the boy had hurried off, \"this is a queer  business, Dr. Bryce! What do you think?\"    \"I think this,\" answered Bryce. \"That man!--look at him!--a strong,  healthy-looking fellow, in the very prime of life--that man has met his  death by foul means. You take particular care of those dinner things  of his--the remains of his dinner, every scrap--and of that tin bottle.  That, especially. Take all these things yourself, Mitchington, and lock  them up--they'll be wanted for examination.\"    Mitchington glanced at the simple matters which Bryce indicated. And  suddenly he turned a half-frightened glance on his companion.    \"You don't mean to say that--that you suspect he's been poisoned?\" he  asked. \"Good Lord, if that is so--\"    \"I don't think you'll find that there's much doubt about it,\" answered  Bryce. \"But that's a point that will soon be settled. You'd better tell  the Coroner at once, Mitchington, and he'll issue a formal order to Dr.  Coates to make a post-mortem. And,\" he added significantly, \"I shall be  surprised if it isn't as I say--poison!\"    \"If that's so,\" observed Mitchington, with a grim shake of his head, \"if  that really is so, then I know what I shall think! This!\" he went  on, pointing to the dead man, \"this is--a sort of sequel to the other  affair. There's been something in what the poor chap said--he did know  something against somebody, and that somebody's got to hear of it--and  silenced him. But, Lord, doctor, how can it have been done?\"    \"I can see how it can have been done, easy enough,\" said Bryce. \"This  man has evidently been at work here, by himself, all the morning. He of  course brought his dinner with him. He no doubt put his basket and his  bottle down somewhere, while he did his work. What easier than for some  one to approach through these trees and shrubs while the man's back was  turned, or he was busy round one of these corners, and put some deadly  poison into that bottle? Nothing!\"    \"Well,\" remarked Mitchington, \"if that's so, it proves something  else--to my mind.\"    \"What!\" asked Bryce.    \"Why, that whoever it was who did it was somebody who had a knowledge  of poison!\" answered Mitchington. \"And I should say there aren't many  people in Wrychester who have such knowledge outside yourselves and the  chemists. It's a black business, this!\"    Bryce nodded silently. He waited until Dr. Coates, an elderly man who  was the leading practitioner in the town, arrived, and to him he gave  a careful account of his discovery. And after the police had taken the  body away, and he had accompanied Mitchington to the police-station and  seen the tin bottle and the remains of Collishaw's dinner safely locked  up, he went home to lunch, and to wonder at this strange development.  The inspector was doubtless right in saying that Collishaw had been  done to death by somebody who wanted to silence him--but who could  that somebody be? Bryce's thoughts immediately turned to the fact that  Ransford had overheard all that Mitchington had said, in that very room  in which he, Bryce, was then lunching--Ransford! Was it possible that  Ransford had realized a danger in Collishaw's knowledge, and had--    He was interrupted at this stage by Mitchington, who came hurriedly in  with a scared face.    \"I say, I say!\" he whispered as soon as Bryce's landlady had shut the  door on them. \"Here's a fine business! I've heard something--something  I can hardly credit--but it's true. I've been to tell Collishaw's family  what's happened. And--I'm fairly dazed by it--yet it's there--it is so!\"    \"What's so?\" demanded Bryce. \"What is it that's true?\"    Mitchington bent closer over the table.    \"Dr. Ransford was fetched to Collishaw's cottage at six o'clock this  morning!\" he said. \"It seems that Collishaw's wife has been in a poor  way about her health of late, and Dr. Ransford has attended her, off and  on. She had some sort of a seizure this morning--early--and Ransford  was sent for. He was there some little time--and I've heard some queer  things.\"    \"What sort of queer things?\" demanded Bryce. \"Don't be afraid of  speaking out, man!--there's no one to hear but myself.\"    \"Well, things that look suspicious, on the face of it,\" continued  Mitchington, who was obviously much upset. \"As you'll acknowledge when  you hear them. I got my information from the next-door neighbour, Mrs.  Batts. Mrs. Batts says that when Ransford--who'd been fetched by Mrs.  Batts's eldest lad--came to Collishaw's house, Collishaw was putting up  his dinner to take to his work--\"    \"What on earth made Mrs. Batts tell you that?\" interrupted Bryce.    \"Oh, well, to tell you the truth, I put a few questions to her as to  what went on while Ransford was in the house,\" answered Mitchington.  \"When I'd once found that he had been there, you know, I naturally  wanted to know all I could.\"    \"Well?\" asked Bryce.    \"Collishaw, I say, was putting up his dinner to take to his work,\"  continued Mitchington. \"Mrs. Batts was doing a thing or two about the  house. Ransford went upstairs to see Mrs. Collishaw. After a while he  came down and said he would have to remain a little. Collishaw went  up to speak to his wife before going out. And"]]]
