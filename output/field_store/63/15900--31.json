That same  versatile genius who had but a short time before made birds and fish out  of a hog, cut it up; it was then consigned to the kettle, and while  Daedalus was taking a long hot drink, Fortunata ground pepper in a  boxwood mill.  When these delicacies had been consumed, Trimalchio looked  the slaves over.  \"You haven't had anything to eat yet, have you?\"  he  asked.  \"Get out and let another relay come on duty.\"  Thereupon a second  relay came in.  \"Farewell, Gaius,\" cried those going off duty, and \"Hail,  Gaius,\" cried those coming on.  Our hilarity was somewhat dampened soon  after, for a boy, who was by no means bad looking, came in among the  fresh slaves.  Trimalchio seized him and kissed him lingeringly,  whereupon Fortunata, asserting her rights in the house, began to rail at  Trimalchio, styling him an abomination who set no limits to his lechery,  finally ending by calling him a dog. Trimalchio flew into a rage at her  abuse and threw a wine cup at her head, whereupon she screeched, as if  she had had an eye knocked out and covered her face with her trembling  hands.  Scintilla was frightened, too, and shielded the shuddering woman  with her garment.  An officious slave presently held a cold water pitcher  to her cheek and Fortunata bent over it, sobbing and moaning.  But as for  Trimalchio, \"What the hell's next?\"  he gritted out, \"this Syrian  dancing-whore don't remember anything!  I took her off the auction block  and made her a woman among her equals, didn't I?  And here she puffs  herself up like a frog and pukes in her own nest; she's a blockhead, all  right, not a woman.  But that's the way it is, if you're born in an attic  you can't sleep in a palace I'll see that this booted Cassandra's tamed,  so help me my Genius, I will!  And I could have married ten million, even  if I did only have two cents: you know I'm not lying!  'Let me give you a  tip,' said Agatho, the perfumer to the lady next door, when he pulled me  aside: 'don't let your line die out!'  And here I've stuck the ax into my  own leg because I was a damned fool and didn't want to seem fickle.  I'll  see to it that you're more careful how you claw me up, sure as you're  born, I will! That you may realize how seriously I take what you've done  to me--Habinnas, I don't want you to put her statue on my tomb for fear  I'll be nagged even after I'm dead!  And furthermore, that she may know I  can repay a bad turn, I won't have her kissing me when I'm laid out!\"          CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-FIFTH.    When Trimalchio had launched this thunderbolt, Habinnas commenced to  beg him to control his anger.  \"There's not one of us but goes wrong  sometimes,\" argued he; \"we're not gods, we're men.\"  Scintilla also cried  out through her tears, calling him \"Gaius,\" and entreating him by his  guardian angel to be mollified.  Trimalchio could restrain the tears no  longer.  \"Habinnas,\" he blubbered, \"as you hope to enjoy your money, spit  in my face if I've done anything wrong.  I kissed him because he's very  thrifty, not because he's a pretty boy.  He can recite his division table  and read a book at sight: he bought himself a Thracian uniform from his  savings from his rations, and a stool and two dippers, with his own  money, too.  He's worth my attention, ain't he?  But Fortunata won't see  it!  Ain't that the truth, you high-stepping hussy'?  Let me beg you to  make the best of what you've got, you shekite, and don't make me show my  teeth, my little darling, or you'll find out what my temper's like!  Believe me, when once I've made up my mind, I'm as fixed as a spike in a  beam!  But let's think of the living.  I hope you'll all make yourselves  at home, gentlemen: I was in your fix myself once; but rose to what I am  now by my own merit.  It's the brains that makes the man, all the rest's  bunk.  I buy well, I sell well, someone else will tell you a different  story, but as for myself, I'm fairly busting with prosperity.  What,  grunting-sow, still bawling?  I'll see to it that you've something to  bawl for, but as I started to say, it was my thrift that brought me to  my fortune.  I was just as tall as that candlestick when I came over from  Asia; every day I used to measure myself by it, and I would smear my lips  with oil so my beard would sprout all the sooner.  I was my master's  'mistress' for fourteen years, for there's nothing wrong in doing what  your master orders, and I satisfied my mistress, too, during that time,  you know what I mean, but I'll say no more, for I'm not one of your  braggarts!\"          CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-SIXTH.    \"At last it came about by the will of the gods that I was master in the  house, and I had the real master under my thumb then.  What is there  left to tell?  I was made co-heir with Caesar and came into a Senator's  fortune.  But nobody's ever satisfied with what he's got, so I embarked  in business.  I won't keep you long in suspense; I built five ships and  loaded them with wine--worth its weight in gold, it was then--and sent  them to Rome.  You'd think I'd ordered it so, for every last one of them  foundered; it's a fact, no fairy tale about it, and Neptune swallowed  thirty million sesterces in one day!  You don't think I lost my pep, do  you?  By Hercules, no!  That was only an appetizer for me, just as if  nothing at all had happened.  I built other and bigger ships, better  found, too, so no one could say I wasn't game.  A big ship's a big  venture, you know.  I loaded them up with wine again, bacon, beans,  Capuan perfumes, and slaves: Fortunata did the right thing in this  affair, too, for she sold every piece of jewelry and all her clothes into  the bargain, and put a hundred gold pieces in my hand.  They were the  nest-egg of my fortune.  A thing's soon done when the gods will it;  I cleared ten million sesterces by that voyage, all velvet, and bought  in all the estates that had belonged to my patron, right away.  I built  myself a house and bought cattle to resell, and whatever I touched grew  just like a honeycomb.  I chucked the game when I got to have an income  greater than all the revenues of my own country, retired from business,  and commenced to back freedmen.  I never liked business anyhow, as far as  that goes, and was just about ready to quit when an astrologer, a Greek  fellow he was, and his name was Serapa, happened to light in our colony,  and he slipped me some information and advised me to quit.  He was hep to  all the secrets of the gods: told me things about myself that I'd  forgotten, and explained everything to me from needle and thread up; knew  me inside out, he did, and only stopped short of telling me what I'd had  for dinner the day before.  You'd have thought he'd lived with me  always!\"          CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-SEVENTH.    \"Habinnas, you were there, I think, I'll leave it to you; didn't he say  --'You took your wife out of a whore-house'? you're as lucky in your  friends, too, no one ever repays your favor with another, you own broad  estates, you nourish a viper under your wing, and--why shouldn't I tell  it--I still have thirty years, four months, and two days to live!  I'll  also come into another bequest shortly.  That's what my horoscope tells  me.  If I can extend my boundaries so as to join Apulia, I'll think I've  amounted to something in this life!  I built this house with Mercury on  the job, anyhow; it was a hovel, as you know, it's a palace now!  Four  dining-rooms, twenty bed-rooms, two marble colonnades, a store-room  upstairs, a bed-room where I sleep myself, a sitting-room for this viper,  a very good room for the porter, a guest-chamber for visitors.  As a  matter of fact, Scaurus, when he was here, would stay nowhere else,  although he has a family place on the seashore.  I'll show you many other  things, too, in a jiffy; believe me, if you have an as, you'll be rated  at what you have.  So your humble servant, who was a frog, is now a king.  Stychus, bring out my funereal vestments while we wait, the ones I'll be  carried out in, some perfume, too, and a draught of the wine in that jar,  I mean the kind I intend to have my bones washed in.\"          CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-EIGHTH.    It was not long before Stychus brought a white shroud and a  purple-bordered toga into the dining-room, and Trimalchio requested us  to feel them and see if they were pure wool. Then, with a smile, \"Take  care, Stychus, that the mice don't get at these things and gnaw them, or  the moths either.  I'll burn you alive if they do.  I want to be carried  out in all my glory so all the people will wish me well.\"  Then, opening  a jar of nard, he had us all anointed.  \"I hope I'll enjoy this as well  when I'm dead,\" he remarked, \"as I do while I'm alive.\"  He then ordered  wine to be poured into the punch-bowl. \"Pretend,\" said he, \"that you're  invited to my funeral feast.\"  The thing had grown positively  nauseating, when Trimalchio, beastly drunk by now, bethought himself of  a new and singular diversion and ordered some horn-blowers brought into  the dining-room.  Then, propped up by many cushions, he stretched  himself out upon the couch.  \"Let on that I'm dead,\" said he, \"and say  something nice about me.\"  The horn-blowers sounded off a loud funeral  march together, and one in particular, a slave belonging to an  undertaker, made such a fanfare that he roused the whole neighborhood,  and the watch, which was patrolling the vicinity, thinking Trimalchio's  house was afire, suddenly smashed in the door and rushed in with their  water and axes, as is their right, raising a rumpus all their own.  We  availed ourselves of this happy circumstance and, leaving Agamemnon in  the lurch, we took to our heels, as though we were running away from a  real conflagration.          ETEXT EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:    Affairs start to go wrong,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5255"],[0,"The Book of Good Manners; a Guide to Polite Usage for All Social Functions (#20)"],[1,"         He also sends or hands the marriage license         (if one is needed) to the officiating         clergyman before the ceremony.      CHURCH, It is not customary for the groom to         see his bride on the wedding-day till he         meets her at the altar. The groom and the         best man usually breakfast together on the         wedding-day and arrive in ample time at the         church.           Upon the arrival of the bride in the         vestibule, the clergyman enters the chancel,         followed by the groom and the best man. The         groom then steps forward, and stands at the         left of the clergyman, facing the audience. It         is a good plan for both the groom and best         man to leave their hats in the vestry, but if         the groom has not done so, he gives his hat         and gloves to the best man on the approach         of the bride, and advances to meet her. He         gives her his left arm, and together they stand         before the clergyman.           At the proper moment he receives the ring         from the best man and hands it to the bride.         It is no longer in good form for him to kiss         the bride after the ceremony, but after receiving         the congratulations of the clergyman         to give her his right arm, and together they         lead the procession to the vestibule.      CLERGYMAN. While the bride selects the officiating         clergyman, it is the place of the groom         to call upon him in regard to the details, and         to pay him the fee.           If the clergyman from any cause--as, living         outside of the State--cannot legally perform         the ceremony, a magistrate should be present         to legalize the marriage, and should receive         a fee.      DRESS-EVENING WEDDING. He wears full         evening dress.      DRESS-MORNING OR AFTERNOON WEDDING.         He wears afternoon dress, consisting of a         double-breasted frock coat of dark material,         waistcoat, single or double (preferably the         latter), of same material, or more usually of         some fancy material of late design. The         trousers should be of light pattern, avoiding         extremes. The linen should be white, and         the tie white or light material, and the gloves         of gray suede. These, with patent-leather         shoes and a silk hat, complete the costume.      EXPENSES. He pays for the license fee, the         organist's fee, and a fee to the sexton.           Nothing less than five dollars in gold,         clean bills, or a check in a sealed envelope,         or more, according to social position and         financial income, should be the clergyman's         fee. Should there be one or two additional         clergymen, he pays a fee to each, the fee of         the officiating clergyman being double that         of the others.           He pays for the carriages of the ushers,         the one for himself and the best man, and         the one which takes away the married couple         on their wedding trip.           He pays for the bouquet carried by the         bride, and, if he wishes, for the bouquets         carried by the bridesmaids. He also pays for         the cuff-buttons or scarf-pins, and, if he         wishes, for the gloves and neckties given         to the ushers and the best man.           He pays for the wedding-ring--a plain gold         one, with initials of bride and groom and         date of marriage engraved thereon. He may         also present some souvenirs to the         bridesmaids.           He may give a farewell dinner a few         evenings before the wedding to his best man,         ushers, and a few intimate friends. He sits         at the head of the table and the best man         opposite, and on this occasion he may give         the scarf-pins or cuff-buttons, also neckties         and gloves, if he wishes, to the best man and         ushers.      FAREWELL DINNER. See BACHELOR'S FAREWELL         DINNER.      GLOVES. At a morning or afternoon wedding,         the groom wears gray suede gloves.           At an evening wedding he wears white kid         gloves.      WEDDING BREAKFAST. The bride and groom         enter first, and are seated at the principal         table.      WEDDING RECEPTION. The groom and his bride         stand side by side and receive the         congratulations of all present. The guests serve         them refreshments.             See also BEST MAN. BRIDE. USHERS.

GUEST OF HONOR AT BALLS, if the ball is given         in honor of some special person, he should be         met on his arrival, introduced to the women         of the reception committee, escorted to the         seat prepared for him, and be attended to the         whole evening by the management of the ball.           At the end of the ball, he should be escorted         to his carriage.      LATE AT DINNERS. When a guest arrives late         he should make a short and suitable apology         to the hostess, and then take his seat as         quickly and as quietly as possible.           The hostess shakes hands with the guest,         but does not rise unless the guest is a woman.           The host should in either case rise and         meet the guest, and assist him in finding his         seat, and endeavor, by making the conversation         general, to distract attention from the         event.           For duties of guests, see other functions--         as, BALLS--GUESTS, CHRISTENINGS--GUESTS, etc.        HAND-SHAKING--INTRODUCTIONS. Women and men on         being introduced may shake hands, but it is         not good form. A polite bow, a smile, and         friendly recognition is more correct. If an         advance is made by either party, it should be         immediately accepted.        HAT.      MEN--CALLING. When making a formal or         brief call, the hat should be carried in the         hand into the parlor.           In apologizing to a woman, opening a door,         or rendering any service to a woman in public,         or in answering a question, the hat should         be raised.           When seeing a woman to her carriage, he         should raise his hat upon closing the         carriage door. When attentions are offered by         another man to a woman whom he is escorting,         a man raises his hat in acknowledgment         of the courtesy and thanks the party.           In a street-car a man raises his hat when         giving his seat to a woman.           On the railroad a man removes his hat in         the parlor-car, but not in the day coach.           In an elevator a man should remove his         hat in the presence of women.           In hotels where corridors are reserved and         used as places of meeting and recreation by         the guests, no hats should be worn. Standing         uncovered when talking to a woman on         the street is generally embarrassing to her,         and it is better to make a polite bow and         replace it after a few seconds.      MOURNING. A crape band around the hat should         be worn--the width of the band being         determined by the character of the bereavement.        HIGH TEA. This is an elaborate entertainment,         and an elaborate menu is generally served.      CALLS. Calls should be made in person one week         after the event.      GUESTS. Guests wear evening dress, and should         not remain more than half an hour.      INVITATIONS. These are engraved, and the         hour for the entertainment specified. They         should be issued in the name of the hostess         only, except in such cases when the entertainment         is the occasion of a debut or another         woman assists, in which event her         name appears likewise.           The invitations should be promptly accepted         or declined.      MEN. Full dress is worn, but men do not wear         gloves.      WOMEN. Full dress is worn.        HOME WEDDINGS. Weddings at the homes of the         brides vary much, according to the taste of         the participants. The ushers, bridesmaids,         best man, and maid of honor are generally         dispensed with; but if present, their duties         are the same as at a church wedding, with         minor differences.           The clergyman stands in a large room         decorated with flowers, facing the audience,         with the groom beside him. The bride enters         on the arm of her father, followed by the         bridesmaids and ushers, and the ceremony         proceeds as at a church, with the usual         congratulations to the groom and best wishes to         the bride.           Refreshments are served, either formal or         informal. At an afternoon ceremony men         wear the regulation afternoon dress, and if         in the evening, the usual evening dress.

The hostess receiving in her own home         should offer her hand to all to whom she is         introduced.           The hostess introduces her "]]]
