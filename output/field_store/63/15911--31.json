True, we had pulled on the cord  to start it, but we couldn't push up on the cord to stop it.  The  bowl was almost full now and the water showed no signs of  stopping.    Just before the bowl ran over we ran downstairs.  We looked back,  expecting to see the water come flowing down through the upstairs  floor, or maybe down the stairway.  But it didn't run over.  We  had gotten scared all for nothing.  It was years later that we  learned about indoor plumbing having automatic cutoffs on the  water supply to the bowls.    Now getting back to our trip--before we found a farmer who needed  us, one tooth broke off the ring gear in the differential of our  car.  We were familiar with the sound--it had happened before.  But we drove on, listening to the click, click, in the car's rear  end every time the wheels went around.  Soon it ceased to be a  click, click, and became a wham, wham.  That meant there were two  teeth off.  It sounded bad; we couldn't go on.    With the differential sounding like it might go to pieces at any  minute, we decided that perhaps this was the cotton country we  had been searching for.  So we spotted a large patch of white  cotton and inquired about picking it.  The man said he didn't  need hands, but he thought Mr. Hammond wanted some pickers.  He  lived about three miles on down the road.    We phoned Mr. Hammond and found that we were in luck.  He wanted  us, and we certainly needed him.  He brought a team of mules and  towed our car to his place.  We unloaded and began picking  immediately, and before nightfall we had gathered hundreds of  pounds of cotton.    Papa caught a ride to Durant the next day and ordered a ring gear  for the car.  Before we had finished picking Mr. Hammond's cotton  the gear came by mail.  Papa jacked up the car, crawled under and  made the repair right there in the cotton field by our camp.    When we finished that patch, there were other fields waiting for  us.  We were making from $30 to $40 a day.  The work was hard but  we didn't mind.  We were finally getting a little money ahead.    I was twelve, and even at that age, I enjoyed helping the family  do what I knew had to be done.  I was growing up.  I was picking  more cotton in a day than I had ever picked before.  I enjoyed  figuring how much I picked and how much money I was making.  I  knew it wouldn't be my money, but I found pleasure in knowing how  much I was adding to the family income.    We quit picking cotton in time to get to Lamesa before Christmas.  We didn't go by our farm at Abbie, but went west into the Texas  panhandle.  Then we turned south to our Lamesa farm.    All in all it was an easy trip.  One stretch of road in Oklahoma  was through sandy post oak country.  Some of the trees were  fairly large, otherwise the land was like Texas shinnery.  The  county road didn't go through the worst of the sand but detoured  many miles out of the way to go around it.  In some places the  sand was higher than our car top.  One man who owned some of the  sandiest land had a road through his pasture so people could cut  through and save many miles.  He had built wooden runways over  the sand hills so cars could travel easily.  He charged a toll of  one dollar for each car.  We paid the toll and saved a good many  miles.    And then, of course we came to the Red River that forms the  boundary between Oklahoma and Texas.  Now, in that part of the  country there is just one way to get from Oklahoma to Texas and  that is to cross the river.  And I don't know of anyone who would  choose to stay in Oklahoma if he had a chance to go to Texas.  And that included us.  So we crossed the river.    I remember, there was a long, long bridge made of wood.  It never  occurred to me at the time just why it was made of wood instead  of concrete, this perhaps because I had never seen a concrete  bridge, and didn't know at that time they would have such things  in my lifetime.  Anyway, there was this nice bridge across the  big muddy river.  And about 200 yards down stream from the  bridge, there was a road where people could cross the river in  the mud and shallow water if they wanted to.    Now the next thing I knew, we were down there in that muddy road  while all the other cars were zipping across on the bridge.  I  wondered why we didn't ride across on the bridge.  We didn't even  ride across the river--well, yes, the driver rode--that was Papa,  but the rest of us didn't ride.  Papa was smart.  He was not only  smart, he was the only one who could drive the car.  The rest of  us didn't walk, either, we ran and pushed.  Part of the time we  were running and trying to keep up.  The rest of the time we were  pushing, trying to keep the car from stopping and sinking into  the quicksand.    I think the bridge we didn't cross on was a toll bridge.  My  memory doesn't tell me it was a toll bridge, but by way of  reasoning I can only conclude that it was.  Otherwise, why would  we Johnsons have been down there pushing in the mud when other  cars were crossing on the bridge?  And why did that man at the  bridge show Papa how to get down to that muddy road?  Why  wouldn't he let us cross on the bridge like the other cars were  doing?  Yes, it all adds up, that must have been a toll bridge.    But we didn't pay the toll.  And we had very little trouble  crossing on the low road.  Matter of fact, we didn't even stop,  that is, Papa didn't, except for us to catch up and load back  into the car.  We saved our money and lost very little time.    When we got into the Texas panhandle, we headed south toward  Lamesa.  We stayed awhile with Susie and Dode and then went on to  the rented farm at Abbie.    It was the end of the year now, and time to re-rent the Abbie  place for another year or give it up.  We gave it up and moved  back to the farm at Lamesa.  We moved west the first time by  railroad.  We went this time in two wagons.  It was January, 1919  and the weather was cold.    If I had known then what I know now, I think I might have asked  my parents how this wagon trip compared with another cold January  21 years ago when the Johnsons moved back to Texas from Oklahoma  in wagons.  At least this time we were not driving a herd of  cattle, only one old milk cow.  And the weather wasn't all that  cold.    I guess the coldest night was the one we spent in an old rundown  schoolhouse, after chasing the skunks and roadrunners out.  It  was somewhere in the bad lands near Gail.  The next morning it  was almost too cold to travel.  After going a few miles we  stopped and got around behind Gail Mountain out of the cold wind,  and built a fire to warm by.          CHAPTER 9    BACK TO OUR LAMESA FARM IN 1919; SCHOOL AT BALLARD    So we moved back to our big farm near Lamesa and farmed there in  1919.  Susie and Dode moved to Hamlin.  They quit farming and  Dode got a job in town.    After those two dry years on the plains, there seemed to be more  coyotes than ever, at least we saw more of them.  The drought and  hunters had taken their toll of rabbits and I guess it was harder  for the coyotes to find something to eat.  They would come almost  to our barnyard in broad daylight in search of food.  Old Scotch  managed to keep them away from our chickens, but he was no match  for two or three of them at one time off out in the pasture, and  he was wise enough to know it.    I have seen him chase a lone coyote a few hundred yards away from  our house, but then that one would join another one and the two  of them would chase Old Scotch back into our yard.  Then with us  to back him up, he would chase them away again.  When there were  more than one, they made the dog stay in his place.    Now I guess you are wondering why we didn't shoot the coyotes  when they came that close.  The answer is simple.  Coyotes are  not stupid.  They can tell a boy from a man, and they can also  tell whether or not the boy has a gun.  They simply would not  come that close to a big boy with a gun.  We kids had guns but  they were small 22 caliber.  They were too small for coyotes.  And besides, the powder in the shells at that time was nothing  like as powerful as the powder we use today.    We four boys had our own guns and naturally Papa had his.  Albert  was the youngest of us four.  He had a gun by the time he was ten  and he killed his share of rabbits, prairie dogs and  rattlesnakes.    You see, we did a lot of target practice with our guns.  Sometimes we would sit on our front porch and shoot nailheads in  the front yard fence.  We would also stand matches up in nail  holes in the fence and shoot the heads, striking the matches  without breaking the stems.  Shells cost us only eight cents for  a box of 50.    No one could deny that we were pretty good.  One man told that  Earl was so good with his rifle that we boys didn't climb trees  to pick peaches.  He said we other kids would walk around under  the trees with buckets and Earl would shoot the stems and let the  peaches fall into the buckets.  But Earl denied it, explaining  that we tried it but Papa made us quit because it bruised the  peaches when they fell.    Now Joel was a year-and-a-half older than I, and no question  about it, he was a smart boy.  He was almost as smart as I was.  But he was so good-looking the girls wouldn't leave him alone.  So he sort of drifted away from his smartness and concentrated on  dressing well and looking good.  He wound up selling men's  clothing, and later on, insurance.  But when he was a boy on the  farm at Lamesa, I remember he made a windmill.  I mean this was a  windmill to remember.  He set it up on a tower and made it pump  water.  And he made a real cylinder out of a piece of pipe, with  two leather valves attached to two wooden spools.  One spool  moved up and down, the other one was stationary at the lower end  of the pipe.  When the wind blew the mill would pump water from a  can that was buried"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54331"],[0,"Life of a Pioneer: Being the Autobiography of James S. Brown (#20)"],[1," further,  the rumors that Col. John C. Fremont, with eight hundred or a thousand  men, claimed it was his right, and not Gen. Kearney's, to dictate  to the United States forces in California. In fact, it was reported  that Col. Fremont was in open hostility to Gen. Kearney, who was  military governor of California by orders from Washington. Under these  circumstances, we were kept in constant readiness, not knowing the  moment we would be called into active service.    Our training daily was one hour for each pound of beef issued, the beef  costing less than a cent a pound to the government. Sergeant Tyler says  our rations were five pounds a day, and I say it was not half enough,  for we were ravenously hungry all the time. If the reader doubts this,  let him try the ration for a little while, and doubt will disappear.    About February 25 we obtained bolted flour and some other supplies of  provisions that had been brought from the Sandwich Islands, by Major  Sward, to San Diego, and thence to San Luis del Rey by mule team. In  the meantime we had received a small amount of unbolted flour, brought  by Lieutenant Oman and a small detachment of the battalion sent out for  the purpose. Then the beef rations were reduced; so that during the  whole twelve months' service we did not once have issued to us the full  rations allowed by the government to the American soldier--if we had  full rations in one thing, another was lacking. Either the government  made a great saving from regulations in feeding us, or a steal put  money into some contractors' pockets.    Day after day the duties of soldier were performed, drilling, out on  detached duty, or marching here, there and everywhere, early and late,  by day and by night, just to suit the fancy of some of our officers,  and not always upon real occasion for the movements. It would seem that  in many respects the soldier's life is much like a faithful wife's; and  in others much unlike a woman's work. Like hers, in that the task seems  never done, busy all day and up at every hour of night in response to  calls of first one child, then another, or even to the exploits of  some mischievous cat, her rest broken and her life worn away; unlike  hers, in that she usually has a dry shelter, regular meals, and a  place to lie down when she can rest, while the soldier in time of war  never knows where he will make his bed at night, often is without food  and drink, having to move at the word of command over deserts, rocks,  mountains, plains and rivers--a stranger to the locality he may call  his home. But the toils of both are necessary, she to rear the nation's  pride and strength--a soldier in the right; he to protect her and  himself, to defend their country's rights and avenge her wrongs.    Returning to the narrative of garrison duty, it appeared to me the  hours of drill were more than Sergeant Tyler's account will admit of;  but I shall not dispute with him, as I write from memory. I do recall  that roll call came at daylight, sick call at 7:30 a.m., breakfast call  at 8:40, drill at 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. roll call at sundown, tattoo at  8:30, and taps at 9 p.m., after which lights must be out except in case  of sickness. All must be silent then, as the men are supposed to have  retired for the night.    On or near the 20th of March, companies A, C, D and E took up their  journey to the Puebla de Los Angeles. We traveled over a hilly country,  where there were numerous herds of cattle and bands of horses. In some  places we passed down to and along the sandy beach around big bluffs  over which, so we were told, the Californians, some years previously,  had driven thousands of horses and cattle to rid the country of them,  as they had overrun the place so that all were suffering for food. This  story seemed confirmed by the great amount of bones that we saw among  the rocks and sands at the foot of deep declivities along the seashore.    On the way to Los Angeles we passed a stone church that had been badly  shaken; the walls had been good mason work, but now were mostly broken  down. We were told that an earthquake did the damage, and that some  three hundred people had been killed. On by the San Gabriel River we  went, arriving at Los Angeles in about four days' march from where we  had started out. We marched into the main street and stacked our arms  as if to say, \"We have possession here.\"    Most of the citizens stood aloof, looking as if the cause they had  supported was lost, but soon the merchants brought out buckets of  whisky and wine, which they set before the command, inviting us to help  ourselves. Some accepted the invitation rather freely, while others  refrained from touching the beverages. We returned to the river at  night, and camped. In a day or two we were marched about two miles up  the stream, and above the town, where we again ran out of provisions  and had to go hungry; nor did we break our fast till 11 a.m. next day.    At this time the air was full of alarming rumors. A revolt of Californians  was talked of; then it was Fremont who was said to be in  rebellion against General Kearney's authority; and again, a powerful  band of Indians was ready to pounce down upon us. It was not very  unexpectedly, therefore, that we received orders to occupy the most  commanding point overlooking the town. Soon after this we learned that  a supply of provisions for the command had been landed at San Pedro,  about twenty-one miles distant, and teams and wagons were sent at once,  under an escort of soldiers, the writer being one. We returned next  day, heavily loaded.    About this date, the command began the erection of a fort, or rather  began to throw up earthworks. Lieutenant Rosecranz was ordered with a  small detachment to Cajon Pass, a narrow opening in the Sierra Nevada  range, about eighty miles east of us. The object was to guard the pass  against the advance of any foe, for, as has been said, there were many  rumors of impending danger. In a short time, Lieutenant Pace, with  twenty-nine officers and men of the battalion--the writer being one of  the number--received orders to relieve the detachment of Lieutenant  Rosecranz. Pace's command had just reached the Rosecranz party, finding  the latter in the act of striking camp, when a dispatch came by pony  express ordering us to return as well.    On our march out, the wild cattle, which were there by thousands,  became excited and began to bellow and crowd toward us. We could see  them for miles coming on the run. They closed in quickly until we were  surrounded by them on three sides, with a deep gulch or very brushy  ravine on the fourth. We retreated in double-quick time to this gulch,  and were compelled to remain in what shelter it afforded until the next  day, before we could pass on in safety.    The unsettled state of the country kept us constantly busy. Our fort  was pushed to completion, and we having obtained what artillery Colonel  Fremont had, the twelve or fifteen pieces now in our possession were  placed in proper position for defense. Everything was made as complete  as could be, and the warclouds began to give way. Fremont had been  placed under arrest for insubordination or rebellion, I do not recall  which, and this contributed to the peace of the country.    A Spaniard was hired to haul a liberty pole from San Bernardino Canyon,  a distance of eighty miles, and as he dared not undertake the journey  without a military escort, Corporal Lafayette Shepherd and fourteen  men, among whom the writer was included, were sent to protect the  Spaniard and help get the pole down to the fort. On that trip we camped  on the present site of San Bernardino City, then a wild and lonely  wilderness, with not a house or farm in sight. At that time the country  abounded in wild cattle, bear, and other wild animals.    Just where we came out on the plain we camped for the night, and in the  morning our Spanish friend went out into the hills to see if he could  kill a deer. Soon he came upon a party of Indians jerking beef, and he  shot into their camp. They came out, returned his fire, and gave him  chase. We were getting breakfast when he dashed into our camp, shouting  that the Indians were upon us, and for us to get our guns. Of course,  we complied, and were ready in short order, but as no Indians came, the  Spaniard insisted that we go in and rout them, as they were killing the  citizens' cattle, and our commander had given a promise of protection  from this. Hastily we saddled our mules and started, expecting every  moment to meet the Indians, who were on foot. We found no one before we  came to the campfires, around which was strewn considerable beef. Soon  we discovered the Indians fleeing up the mountain, and on our jaded  mules we gave chase, but when we reached the summit the Indians were  going up the opposite ridge. We dismounted and poured a few volleys  into the brush above them. They did not fire back. I do not think any  harm was done. They were fleeing for their lives and did not show  any opposition to us, and we had no desire to harm them, but simply  to demonstrate to the Californians that as United States soldiers we  were ready to protect them and their property, as was promised by our  officers.    We hastened back to the fort with our charge, the logs in the rough  being about fifty feet each, the two making a pole between ninety and  ninety-five feet long when completed, which was done by the members of  the battalion at the fort.    Another event about this period was an order by Colonel Cooke for a  detail of good marksmen and trusty men to go through the town and shoot  or bayonet all the dogs to be found in the streets. The colonel had  notified the town authorities of his intention. Accordingly the detail  was made and ammunition issued. The writer was one of the trusted  marksmen. We sallied forth in the town of Los Angeles, where the dogs  were more numerous"]]]
