It seems best to refer the mice from 4 km. N Ciudad Valles to _B. t.  taylori_ on the basis of the average of external and cranial characters.  Specimens from 6 mi. SW San Geronimo, Coahuila, also referred to _B. t.  taylori_, resemble in color the mice from 4 km. N Ciudad Valles. When  more specimens are obtained from the front range of the Sierra Madre  Oriental, at lower altitudes, the manner in which these two subspecies  intergrade with one another will be better understood. At present,  populations from higher altitudes in the mountains seem to represent a  dark subspecies; populations from the coastal plain represent a pale  subspecies, and those from the lower slopes and high valleys seemingly  are intergrades. _B. t. fuliginatus_ occurs in a somewhat limited strip  of chernozem soil (or suelos negros of Tamayo, 1949: Carta de Suelos).  The populations occurring at lower altitudes on the coastal plain are on  generally paler soils.    _Specimens examined._--Total 39, all from the Republic of Mexico, as  follows: SAN LUIS POTOSI: El Salto, 24 Mus.

H. Batty, original number 455.    _Range._--Central Chihuahua south through Durango (west to eastern edge  of Sierra Madre Occidental), to Zacatecas and Aguascalientes, thence  west into northern and northwestern Jalisco, see Figure 11. Zonal range:  Lower Sonoran, approximately the Chihuahua Desert Biotic Province of  Goldman and Moore (1945:349). Occurs from 4000 feet 2 mi. ESE Tequila,  Jalisco, up to 6700 feet 2 mi. W Minaca, Chihuahua.    _Diagnosis._--Size medium to small for the species; dorsum Buffy Brown  to fawn color; dorsal ground color of unworn pelage of adults varying  from Buffy Brown in darkest series (especially those from higher  altitudes) to Avellaneous with grayish overtones in palest series; worn  pelage in mid-dorsal region of adults fawn to grayish; terminal parts of  individual hairs buffy, gray basally; guard hairs on dorsum  black-tipped, grayish basally; belly Light Gull Gray, distal half of  hairs white, proximal half Neutral Gray; hairs in region of throat and  chin white to base (some specimens with faint buffy overtones); forefeet  dusky below, whitish above; hind feet whitish above, ventral surface  whitish to dusky; dorsal and lateral vibrissae black, other vibrissae  white. Average and extreme measurements of six adults from the type  locality are as follows: total length, 109 (106-117); length of tail,  44.5 (43-48); length of body, 63 (57-69); length of hind foot, 13.1  (12.7-14.0); occipitonasal length, 17.5 (17.4-18.0); zygomatic breadth,  9.3 (9.1-9.5); postpalatal length, 6.6 (6.2-6.9); least interorbital  breadth, 3.5 (3.4-3.6); length of incisive foramina, 3.8 (3.6-4.1);  length of rostrum, 5.9 (5.7-6.0); breadth of braincase, 8.6 (8.5-8.8);  depth of cranium, 6.6 (6.2-6.9); alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row,  3.2 (3.1-3.4); for photographs of the skull, see Plate 2_e_ and Plate  4_f_.    _Comparisons._--For comparisons with _B. t. allex_, _B. t. canutus_, _B.  t. ater_, and _B. t. taylori_, see accounts of those subspecies. From  _B. t. analogous_, _B. t. paulus_ differs as follows: dorsal color paler  having more reddish-brown than blackish-brown tones; venter whitish to  buffy, instead of gray to light-gray; tail bicolored (not unicolored),  usually having more hairs; hind feet white (not sooty) above. Cranially,  _B. t. paulus_ differs from _B. t. analogous_ in: skull slightly smaller  in all dimensions; maxillary part of zygoma narrowing and forming  oblique angle rather than a near right angle with rostrum; anterior  incisive foramina constricted posteriorly; tips of nasals truncate (less  rounded).    _Remarks._--J. A. Allen (1903:599) correctly pointed out that young  specimens, in first pelage, were gray brown; young adults were darker  and more varied with some blackish; adults and old adults were buffy to  grayish. The change in color of pelage with increasing age is more  pronounced in _paulus_ than in other subspecies of _B. taylori_. Of two  males collected on April 12, 1949, one, an adult, is buffy brown, and  the other, an old adult with worn pelage, is grayish-brown. In mice in  the earlier stages of adulthood, underfur of the dorsum is buffy at the  tips and gray basally. With increased wear, the buffy tip is lost.  Consequently, mice in the later stages of adulthood are grayish.    _B. t. paulus_ intergrades with _ater_ to the north in Chihuahua (see  account of that subspecies), with _analogous_ to the south in Jalisco,  and with _allex_ (see account of that subspecies) to the southwest in  Nayarit and Jalisco. The zone of intergradation between _paulus_ and  _analogous_ in Jalisco approximately borders the Rio Grande de Santiago  from the western part of the State to the northwest shore of Lago de  Chapala. Nineteen specimens from 2 mi. WNW Lagos de Moreno in northwest  Jalisco seem to be intermediate between _paulus_ and _analogous_ in  color, averaging slightly grayer than typical _paulus_. The series of 19  is referable to _paulus_ on the basis of cranial characters.    A series of 34 specimens from 3 mi. W La Venta, Jalisco (referable to  _paulus_), is indistinguishable in color of pelage from two series of  _paulus_ from 5 mi. N Durango, and from 8 mi. NE of Durango, except that  the antiplantar surfaces of the hind feet are sooty as in _analogous_.  Seemingly, features of color mentioned above as diagnostic of the two  subspecies are either present or absent and there is no tendency toward  intermediacy in color in the population from 3 mi. W La Venta.    The Rio Grande de Santiago may have acted in the past as a physical  barrier reducing gene flow between _allex_ and _paulus_ and in  separating completely the two populations for limited periods.    _Specimens examined._--Total 176, all from the Republic of Mexico and  distributed as follows: CHIHUAHUA: Rancho Sanignacio, 4 mi.

The general arrangement of the region of the digits of the posterior  limbs in birds, presents some points of interest.    We shall merely say with regard to the metatarsus, that it is formed by  a single bone, which in the cock is furnished towards its inferior third  with a pointed process, the _spur_. At the inferior part, there is,  however, found another, which is but very slightly developed, and with  which the first phalanx of the innermost toe articulates.    The toes are, in the majority of species, four in number:[15] an  internal, which is directed backwards, and corresponds to the great-toe;  the others are directed forwards. This arrangement is constant in  grallatores (wading birds), gallinaceae[16] (domestic fowls), and  raptores (birds of prey).      [15] In spite of the fact that the custom is to designate the terminal         portions of the foot of birds by the name of digits, we prefer to         employ here the terms _foot_ and _toes_. In adopting this         decision we believe we are acting according to a more didactic         method. Homology of names should, in our opinion, always         accompany homology of regions.      [16] With regard to the gallinaceae, we must add that in certain         varieties the number of toes is five; those which are directed         forwards are three in number; the internal one which passes         backward, is double. The two toes which are the subject of this         special arrangement are placed very close together, and are         nearly always superimposed. This condition is found in the Houdan         and Dorking breeds.    [Illustration: FIG. 47.--POSTERIOR LIMB OF THE HORSE PLACED IN THE  POSITION WHICH IT SHOULD OCCUPY IF THE ANIMAL WERE A PLANTIGRADE: LEFT  LIMB, EXTERNAL SURFACE.    1, Tibia; 2, astragalus; 3, calcaneum; 4, metatarsus; 5, first phalanx;  6, second phalanx; 7, third phalanx.]    In climbing birds (parrots, woodpeckers, and toucans), the innermost  toe is not only directed backward, but the external toe accompanies it  in that direction; consequently, there are two posterior and two  anterior toes. Sometimes they are all directed forwards; this  disposition is found in the martins. In some birds, the number of toes  is reduced to three: the cassowary shows this reduction; in others, the  number is still further diminished--the ostrich, for example, has but  two.    [Illustration: FIG. 48.--SKELETON OF THE FOOT OF A BIRD (THE COCK): LEFT  SIDE, EXTERNAL SURFACE.    1, Metatarsus; 2, spur; 3, rudimentary metatarsal; 4, first toe; 5,  second toe; 6, third toe; 7, fourth toe.]    Further, we find that, in general, the number of the phalanges  increases, when we examine the toes in commencing with the most internal  (Fig. 48): this has two; then the following one three; that which comes  next in order has four; and the most external toe has five. The  phalanges of this last are short; so that, although it is formed by a  larger number of bones, it is not the longest of the toes.      THE POSTERIOR LIMBS IN SOME ANIMALS.    =Plantigrades=: =Bear= (Fig. 33, p. 50).--The external iliac fossa is  very deep. The femur is longer than the bones of the leg; the great  trochanter does not reach the level of the head of the femur. The  fibula is well developed; it is united to the tibia at its superior and  inferior extremities only.    The foot, which, as in the case of the hand, rests on the ground by the  whole extent of its plantar surface, presents five toes; the shortest of  these is the internal--that is, the toe which corresponds to the  great-toe in man; the third and fourth are the longest, and they are  almost equal; there is a very slight difference in favour of the fourth,  which is slightly superior in dimensions to the third.    =Digitigrades=: =Cat=, =Dog= (Fig. 34, p. 52).--The external iliac  fossa, which looks outwards, is deep; the iliac crest is convex  anteriorly, the convexity is continued from one iliac spine to the  other.    [Illustration: FIG. 49.--PELVIS OF THE DOG, SEEN FROM ABOVE.    1, Iliac crest; 2, external iliac fossa; 3, sacrum; AA', bi-iliac  diameter; BB', bi-ischial diameter.]    In the dog, the distance which separates the anterior iliac spines is  less than that which separates the ischia (Fig. 49). On a skeleton which  we measured, the transverse diameter, the distance from the anterior  iliac spine of one side to that of the opposite side, was 8 centimetres,  whilst the distance which separated the ischia was 105 millimetres; on  another skeleton, the first measurement was 127 metres, and the second  was 146 millimetres. It seems to us unnecessary to multiply examples.    In the cat, the iliac spines are but slightly marked; the result is  that the iliac crest is almost confounded with the inferior and superior  borders of the ilium. The two diameters referred to above are almost  equal (Fig. 50).    We draw particular attention to what we have just noted in regard to the  transverse proportions of the iliac and ischiatic regions of the dog and  the cat. These relations are evidently of importance with regard to  shape, since the iliac crests and the ischia are noticeable beneath the  skin.    [Illustration: FIG. 50.--PELVIS OF A FELIDE (LION), VIEWED FROM ABOVE.    1, Iliac crest; 2, external iliac fossa; 3, sacrum; AA', bi-iliac  diameter; BB', bi-ischial diameter.]    In the dog, the shaft of the femur is slightly convex in front; but in  the cat it is straight. The borders of the shaft are slightly marked, so  that it is almost cylindrical. The _linea aspera_, less prominent than  in man, gains in width what it loses in elevation; it constitutes what  may almost be called a rough _surface_. This surface is narrower in its  middle portion than at its extremities, where it bifurcates to go  upwards to the two trochanters, and downwards to the two condyles. At  the superior extremity, the neck is short, the great trochanter reaching  almost to the level of the head of the femur; the digital _cavity_,  which is situated on the internal surface of the great trochanter, is  very deep. At its inferior extremity it projects strongly backward. The  trochlea is narrow; in the cat its two lips are equally prominent, while  in the dog the external is a little more elevated than the internal,  which on its part is a little thicker. The trochlea is still more  independent of the condyles than in the human femur; it is separated  from these latter by a slight constriction.    The knee-cap is long and narrow.    The tibia of the dog is slightly curved from before backward: it has the  form of an elongated S; this conformation is in great part due to the  very marked projection of the anterior tuberosity and of the superior  portion of the crest, which, a little below that tuberosity, turns  abruptly backwards, and thus describes a curve the concavity of which is  directed forward. The superior part of the external surface is very much  hollowed out.    The superior extremity is much thicker than the inferior one. It is not  only wide in the transverse direction, but is more especially extended  from before backwards; the prominence of the anterior tuberosity is the  cause of the elongation of this antero-posterior diameter. On the  posterior part of the external tuberosity is found a surface to which  the superior extremity of the fibula is applied.    The inferior extremity presents an articular surface, which is formed of  two lateral cavities, separated by a crest, which is directed obliquely  forwards and outwards. The internal part is prominent, and forms the  internal malleolus.    With regard to the fibula, it is united to the tibia by its extremities  and by the inferior half of its shaft. This latter is more expanded  below than in its upper part. The superior extremity is flattened from  without inwards. The inferior extremity projects beyond the articular  surface of the tibia, and forms the external malleolus, which, instead  of, as in man, descending further than the tibial malleolus, stops at  the same level, and even descends a little less than does the latter.    In the cat, the curve of the tibia is less pronounced; this is due to  the fact that the crest, instead of being concave in its middle portion,  is slightly convex anteriorly. The fibula, less flattened than that of  the dog, is united to the tibia by its extremities only, and is separate  in the rest of its extent.    The bones of the tarsus are seven in number, and arranged as in man,  with this difference (which is easily comprehended), that their general  relations are changed on account of the vertical direction of the  tarsus. For example, the astragalus, instead of being above the  calcaneum, is situated in front of it; the cuneiform bones, instead of  being situated in front of the scaphoid, are found below it, etc.    These animals have but four well-developed metatarsals; that which  corresponds to the great-toe is represented merely by a small  style-shaped bone, situate at the internal part of the region.    Nevertheless, we find this toe fully developed in some dogs.  Notwithstanding this, the bones which form it are, however, but  rudimentary, and much smaller than those of the innermost digit of the  fore-limb.    Sometimes it is double; this condition is demonstrable in individuals  belonging to breeds of large size. The median metatarsals are more fully  developed than the other bones of the same region which are next them.  Viewed as a whole, the metatarsal bones are a little longer than the  metacarpals; the result is that the distance which separates the tarsus  from the ground is a little greater than that which separates the carpus  from the plane on which the anterior limbs rest. The length of the  calcaneum still further exaggerates this difference, and, as in the  animals "]]]
