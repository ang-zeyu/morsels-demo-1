[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/477"],[0,"Criminal Sociology (#20)"],[1,"the death penalty, there  are many instances of condemned persons who, through congenital  insensibility, submit to it cynically.  Moreover, for such as have  been overwhelmed with terror when the moment of execution arrived,  the utmost that this fact can prove is that <p 103>they are so  constituted as to give themselves up completely to the impression  of the moment, without the energy to resist it.  In other words,  so long as the punishment is distant and uncertain, they were not  terrified, but having always yielded to the impression of the  moment, they yielded to the criminal impulse.    For other punishments, also, it is known that punitive methods,  even when not contrary to the law, as they sometimes are in Italy,  are always less stern than simple folk imagine when they read the  codes and the sentences.  And criminals naturally judge of  punishments by their own experience, that is to say, in accordance  with their practical application, and not with the more or less  candid threats of the lawmaker.    If we add to vindictive feeling, historic traditions, oblivion of  bio-psychic differences of the social strata, the confounding of  exceptional laws and ordinary punishments, and of the varying  effective force of punishment, the attitude of the public mind and  the natural tendency of criminalists to think only of their two  syllogistic symbols of crime and punishment--if we further add the  easy-going idea of the multitude, that the inscribing of a law in  the statute-book is a sufficient remedy for social diseases, we  can readily understand how this exaggerated and illusory  confidence in punishment is so persistent, and crops up in every  theoretical or practical discussion, in spite of the strong  refutation which is daily afforded by facts and psychological  observation.    All human actions, like the actions of animals, are developed  between the two opposite poles of <p 104>pleasure and pain, by the  attraction of the former and the repulsion of the latter.  And  punishment, which is one of the social forms of pain, is always a  direct motive in human conduct, as it is also an indirect guide,  by virtue of its being a sanction of justice, unconsciously  strengthening respect for the law.  But still this psychological  truth, whilst it demonstrates the natural character of punishment,  and the consequent absurdity of abolishing it as absolutely void  of efficacy, does not destroy our conclusion as to the slight  efficacy of punishment as a counteraction of crime.    We have only to distinguish between punishment as a natural  sanction and punishment as a social sanction in order to see how  the really great power of natural punishment almost entirely  disappears in social punishment, which in all our systems is but a  sorry caricature.    The mute but inexorable reaction of nature against every action  which infringes her laws, and the grievous consequences which  inevitably follow for the man who has infringed them, constitute a  repression of the most efficacious kind, wherein every man,  especially in the earlier years of his life, receives daily and  never to be forgotten lessons.  This is the discipline of natural  consequence, which is a genuine educational method, long since  pointed out by Rousseau, and developed by Spencer and Bain.    But in this natural and spontaneous form, the punishment derives  its whole force from the inevitable character of the consequences.  And it is one of the few observations of practical psychology  which have <p 105>been made and repeated by the classical students  of crime, that in punishment, and especially the punishment of  death, the certainty is more effectual than the severity.  And I  will add that even a small uncertainty takes away from a pain  which we fear, much of its repelling force, whereas even a great  uncertainty does not destroy the attraction of a pleasure which we  are hoping for.    Here, then, we have a primary and potent cause of the slight  efficacy of legal punishments, in the picturing of the many  chances of escape.  First there is the chance of not being  detected, which is the most powerful spring of all contemplated  crime: then the chance, in case of detection, that the evidence  will not be strong enough, that the judges will be merciful, or  will be deceived, that judgment may be averted amidst the  intricacies of the trial, that clemency may either reverse or  mitigate the sentence.  These are so many psychological causes  which, conflicting with the natural fear of unpleasant  consequences, weaken the repellent force of legal punishment,  whilst they are unknown to natural punishment.    There is also another psychological condition which, undermining  even the force of natural punishment, almost entirely destroys the  power of social punishment; and that is improvidence.  We see, in  fact, that even the most certain natural consequences are defied,  and lose most of their power to guard an improvident man from  anti-natural and dangerous actions.  Now in regard to legal  punishment, even apart from passionate impulse, it is known that  criminals, occasional and other, are specially improvident, in  common <p 106>with savages and children.  This weakness is  conspicuous enough in the lower and less instructed classes, but  amongst criminals it is a genuine characteristic of psychological  infirmity.    Now, whilst a very slight force is sufficient to produce very  great and constant effects, when it acts in harmony with natural  tendency and environment, every process, on the other hand, which  is opposed to the natural tendencies of man, or which does not  follow them closely, encounters a resistance which triumphs in the  last resort.    Everyday life gives us many examples.  The university student,  when he gambles, risks on a single card the last remnant of his  allowance, and prepares for himself a thousand privations.  Miners  and workmen at dangerous trades refuse to take warning by the  sight of comrades whom they have seen dying or repeatedly attacked  by disease.  M. Despine related that, during the cholera of 1866,  at Bilbao, there were some who set up an imitation of the disease  in order to obtain charitable relief, though in several cases  death ensued.  M. Fayet, in an essay on the statistics of accused  persons in France, extending over twenty years, remarked that  specific and proportionately greater criminality was displayed by  notaries and bailiffs, who knew better than any one else the  punishments fixed by law.  And in the statistics of capital  punishment at Ferrara, during nine centuries, I discovered the  significant fact that there is a succession of notaries executed  for forgery, frequently at very short intervals, in the same town.  This attests the truth of the observation made by Montesquieu and  Beccaria, <p 107>as against the deterrent power of the death  penalty, for men grow accustomed to the sight; and this again is  confirmed by the fact mentioned by Mr. Roberts, a gaol chaplain,  and M. B<e'>renger, a magistrate, that several condemned men had  previously been present at executions, and by another fact  mentioned by Despine and Angelucci, that in the same town, and  often in the same place, in which executions had been carried out,  murders are often committed on the same day.    A man does not change his identity; and no penal code, whether  mild or severe, can change his natural and invincible tendencies,  such as inclination to pleasure and persistent hope of impunity.    Let us also observe that, as Mill said, the permanent efficacy of  any measure in the spheres of politics, economy, and  administration, is always inversely proportional to its force and  suddenness.  Now punishment does not stand the test even of this  sociological law, for in its essence it is only the primitive  reaction of force against force.  It is true that, as Beccaria  said, the classical school has always aimed at rendering social  reaction against crime less violent; but that is not enough.  Henceforward, if we are to adapt ourselves to psychological and  sociological laws, the development of our defensive administration  must tend to render this social reaction less direct.  If the  struggle for existence is always to remain the supreme law of  living creatures, yet it is not necessary that it should always be  developed in the violent forms of primitive humanity.  On the  contrary, one of the results of social progress is to make the  struggle for existence less violent and less direct.  <p 108>    In the same way, the continuous struggle between society and  criminals, instead of being a physical and social force, directly  opposed to a physical individual force, should rather become an  indirect system of psychical forces.  Penal law in society has the  same qualities as education in the family and pedagogy in schools.  All the three were once dominated by the idea of taming human  passions by force; the rod was supreme.  In course of time it was  perceived that this produced unexpected results, such as violence  and hypocrisy, and then men thought fit to modify their  punishments.  But in our own days schoolmasters see the advantage  of relying solely on the free play of tendencies and bio-  psychological laws.  Similarly the defensive function of society,  as Romagnosi said, in place of being a physical and repressive  system, ought to be a moral and preventive system, based on the  natural laws of biology, psychology, and sociology.    Force is always a bad remedy for force.  In the Middle Ages, when  punishments were brutal, crimes were equally savage; and society,  in demoralising rivalry with the atrocity of criminals, laboured  in a vicious circle.  Now, in the lower social grades, the brutal  man, who often resorts to violence, is in his turn frequently the  victim of violence; so that, amongst criminals, a scar is somewhat  of a professional distinction.      To sum up,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47703"],[0,"Wilford Woodruff, Fourth President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day (#20)"],[1,"we went on  board a sloop which landed us on North Fox Island at 2 o'clock a. m. on  August 20th.    \"The town of Vinal Haven includes both North and South Fox Islands,  in latitude 44 north longitude 69 10' west. The population numbered,  at the time of my visit, about eighteen hundred. The inhabitants were  intelligent and industrious, and hospitable to strangers. They got most  of their living and wealth by fishing. The town fitted out over one  hundred licensed sailing vessels, besides smaller craft.    \"North Fox Island is nine miles long by two miles in width, and has  a population of eight hundred. They have a postoffice, one store,  a Baptist church and a meetinghouse, four schoolhouses, and a tide  grist-mill. The land is rather poor, yet there are some good farms. The  products are wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, and grass. The principal  timber consists of fir, spruce, hemlock, and birch. Raspberries and  gooseberries grow in great abundance, and some upland cranberries are  raised. The principal stock are sheep.    \"South Fox Island comes as near being without definite form as any spot  on earth I ever saw. It would be difficult for any person to describe  it. It is about ten miles in length by five in width, and is a mass  of rocks, formed into shelves, hills, and valleys, and cut up into  necks and points to make room for the coves and harbors that run into  the island. The population is one thousand. The inhabitants get their  living entirely by fishing. There is no chance for farming upon the  island. There are a few garden patches which are cultivated at great  expense. Some few sheep are raised there. Many of the inhabitants fish  in the vicinity of Newfoundland, and bring their fish home, where they  cure them on flakes and prepare them for the market. They supply the  market with great quantities of cod, mackerel, and boxed herring. Upon  this island there are two stores, three tide mills, six schoolhouses,  and a small branch of the Methodist church presided over by a priest.  What timber there is upon this {76} island, such as pine, fir, spruce,  hemlock, and birch, and likewise whortleberries, raspberries, and  gooseberries, grow mostly out of the cracks in the rocks.    \"Great quantities of fish in almost endless variety inhabit the  coves and harbors around the islands. The whale, blackfish, shark,  ground-shark, pilot-fish, horse-mackerel, sturgeon, salmon, halibut,  cod, polleck, tom-cod, hake, haddock, mackerel, shad-bass, alewife,  herring, pohagen, dolphin, whiting, frost-fish, flounders, smelt,  skate, shrimp, skid, cusk, blueback, scallop, dog-fish, mutton-fish,  lumpfish, squid, five-fingers, monkfish, horse-fish, sun-fish,  sword-fish, thrasher, cat-fish, scuppog, tootog, eye-fish, cunner,  ling, also the eel, lobster, clam, mussel, periwinkle, porpoise, seal,  etc., are found.    \"I have given a brief description of Vinal Haven. It was quite dark  when we landed, without a farthing of money. We made our way over the  rocks and through the cedars the best we could until we found a house.  We rapped at the door. A woman put her head out of the window and asked  who we were and what was wanted. I told her we were two strangers, and  wanted a bed to lie down upon till morning. She let us in and gave us a  bed. We slept until quite late, it being Sunday morning.    \"When we came out and took breakfast it was nearly noon. I asked  her what she charged for our accomodation. She replied that we were  welcome. I then asked her if there were any minister or church on  the island. She informed us that there was a Baptist minister, named  Newton, who had a congregation and a meetinghouse about five miles from  there.    \"We thanked her for her kindness, walked to the meetinghouse, and  stepped inside the doorway. We stood there until a deacon came to the  door. I asked him to tell the minister in the pulpit that there were  two servants of God at the door, and that they had a message to give to  the people and wished the privilege of delivering it. He sent for us  to come to the pulpit, so we walked through the congregation with our  valises and took a seat by the side of the minister, who was about to  speak as we came to the door. He arose and delivered his discourse to  the people, occupying about half an hour. When he closed he asked me  what my wish was. I told him we wished to speak to the people at any  hour that would suit his or their convenience; so he gave notice {77}  that there were two strangers present who would speak to the people at  5 o'clock that evening.    \"We were quite a source of wonderment to the people, as they had  no idea who we were. Mr. Newton asked us home to tea with him, and  we gladly accepted the invitation. When we arrived at his house, I  opened my valise and took out the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and  Covenants, laid them upon the table, and took my seat. Mr. Newton took  up the books and looked at them, but said nothing. I then inquired if  there were any schoolhouses upon the island, and if so, whether they  were free to preach in. He answered that there were four, numbered  respectively from one to four, and that they were free. Mr. Newton  and family accompanied us to the meeting-house, where we met a large  congregation, none of whom knew who we were or anything about our  profession, except the minister.    \"Elder Hale and I went to the stand, and I arose with peculiar feelings  and addressed the congregation for one hour, taking for my text  Galatians 1:8, 9. This was the first time that I, or any other elder of  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, had (to my knowledge)  attempted to preach the fulness of the gospel and the Book of Mormon  to the inhabitants of any island of the sea. I had much liberty in  speaking, and informed the people that the Lord had raised up a prophet  and organized His Church as in the days of Christ and the ancient  apostles, with prophets, apostles, and the gifts as anciently, and that  he had brought forth the Book of Mormon. At the close of my remarks  Elder Hale bore testimony. I gave liberty for any one to speak who  might wish to do so. As no one responded, I announced that we would  hold meetings the next four evenings at the schoolhouses, beginning at  No. 1.    \"During the first thirteen days of our sojourn upon the island, we  preached seventeen discourses, being invited by the people to tarry  with them. I left a copy of the Doctrine and Covenants with Mr. Newton  for his perusal. He read it, and the spirit of God bore testimony to  him of its truth. He pondered over it for days, and walked his room  until midnight trying to decide whether to receive or reject it. He  and his family attended about a dozen of my first meetings, and then  he made up his mind, contrary to the dictation of the spirit of God to  him, to reject the {78} testimony and come out against me. However,  we commenced baptizing his flock. The first two we baptized were  a sea-captain, by the name of Justin Eames, and his wife. Brother  Jonathan H. Hale went down into the sea on the 3rd of September, and  baptized them; these were the first baptisms performed by proper  authority upon any of the islands of the sea (to my knowledge) in this  dispensation.    \"Before we left Kirtland some of the leading apostates there had tried  to discourage Brother Hale about going on his mission, telling him he  never would baptize anyone, and had better remain at home. When Captain  Eames offered himself for baptism, I asked Brother Hale to baptize  him, and prove those men to be false prophets, which he did. On the  following Sabbath I baptized Justin Eames' brother, Ebenezer Eames,  another sea-captain, and a young lady.    \"Mr. Newton, the Baptist minister, now commenced a war against us, and  sent to the South Island for a Mr. Douglass, a Methodist minister, with  whom he had been at variance for years, to come over and help him put  down 'Mormonism.' Mr. Douglass came over and they got together as many  people as they could, and held a conference. He railed against Joseph,  the Prophet, and the Book of Mormon, and taking that book in his hand,  with outstretched arm, declared that he feared none of the judgments of  God that would come upon him for rejecting it as the word of God. (I  never heard what his sentiments upon this subject were at the end of  his term of fourteen years' imprisonment in the Thomaston penitentiary,  for an outrage upon his daughter. The judgment was given upon the  testimony of his wife and daughter).    \"I was present and heard Mr. Douglass' speech upon this occasion, and  took minutes of it. When he closed I arose and informed the people that  I would meet them the next Sunday in the meeting-house and answer Mr.  Douglass; and I wished him, as well as the people, to be present. I  informed the people that Mr. Douglass had made many false statements  against Joseph Smith and the Latter-day Saints, with whom he had no  acquaintance; and he had misquoted much Scripture, all of which I would  correct.    \"We continued to baptize the people on North Island until {79}  we baptized every person who owned an interest in the Baptist  meeting-house. I then followed Mr. Douglas home to South Island, and  preached the gospel to the members of his church, and baptized nearly  all of them.    \"The excitement became great on both islands, and on Sunday, the 17th  of September, I met a large assembly from both islands, and took up  the same subject that Mr. Douglass had dwelt upon in his remarks  against the Book of Mormon and our principles. I spoke two and a half  hours, and answered every objection against the Book of Mormon, Joseph  Smith, or our principles. I had good attention, and the people seemed  satisfied. At the close of the meeting Elder Hale administered the  ordinance of baptism.    \"Mr. Newton, in order to save his cause, went to the mainland, brought  over several ministers, and held"]]]
