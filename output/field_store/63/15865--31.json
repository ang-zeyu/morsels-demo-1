But there is another Christian virtue, a virtue far more obviously and  historically connected with Christianity, which will illustrate even  better the connection between paradox and practical necessity. This  virtue cannot be questioned in its capacity as a historical symbol;  certainly Mr. Lowes Dickinson will not question it. It has been the  boast of hundreds of the champions of Christianity. It has been the  taunt of hundreds of the opponents of Christianity. It is, in essence,  the basis of Mr. Lowes Dickinson's whole distinction between  Christianity and Paganism.  I mean, of course, the virtue of humility.  I admit, of course, most readily, that a great deal of false Eastern  humility (that is, of strictly ascetic humility) mixed itself with the  main stream of European Christianity. We must not forget that when we  speak of Christianity we are speaking of a whole continent for about a  thousand years.  But of this virtue even more than of the other three,  I would maintain the general proposition adopted above.  Civilization  discovered Christian humility for the same urgent reason that it  discovered faith and charity--that is, because Christian civilization  had to discover it or die.    The great psychological discovery of Paganism, which turned it into  Christianity, can be expressed with some accuracy in one phrase. The  pagan set out, with admirable sense, to enjoy himself. By the end of  his civilization he had discovered that a man cannot enjoy himself and  continue to enjoy anything else. Mr. Lowes Dickinson has pointed out in  words too excellent to need any further elucidation, the absurd  shallowness of those who imagine that the pagan enjoyed himself only in  a materialistic sense. Of course, he enjoyed himself, not only  intellectually even, he enjoyed himself morally, he enjoyed himself  spiritually. But it was himself that he was enjoying; on the face of  it, a very natural thing to do.  Now, the psychological discovery is  merely this, that whereas it had been supposed that the fullest  possible enjoyment is to be found by extending our ego to infinity, the  truth is that the fullest possible enjoyment is to be found by reducing  our ego to zero.    Humility is the thing which is for ever renewing the earth and the  stars. It is humility, and not duty, which preserves the stars from  wrong, from the unpardonable wrong of casual resignation; it is through  humility that the most ancient heavens for us are fresh and strong. The  curse that came before history has laid on us all a tendency to be  weary of wonders.  If we saw the sun for the first time it would be the  most fearful and beautiful of meteors. Now that we see it for the  hundredth time we call it, in the hideous and blasphemous phrase of  Wordsworth, \"the light of common day.\" We are inclined to increase our  claims.  We are inclined to demand six suns, to demand a blue sun, to  demand a green sun. Humility is perpetually putting us back in the  primal darkness. There all light is lightning, startling and  instantaneous. Until we understand that original dark, in which we have  neither sight nor expectation, we can give no hearty and childlike  praise to the splendid sensationalism of things.  The terms \"pessimism\"  and \"optimism,\" like most modern terms, are unmeaning. But if they can  be used in any vague sense as meaning something, we may say that in  this great fact pessimism is the very basis of optimism.  The man who  destroys himself creates the universe. To the humble man, and to the  humble man alone, the sun is really a sun; to the humble man, and to  the humble man alone, the sea is really a sea. When he looks at all the  faces in the street, he does not only realize that men are alive, he  realizes with a dramatic pleasure that they are not dead.    I have not spoken of another aspect of the discovery of humility as a  psychological necessity, because it is more commonly insisted on, and  is in itself more obvious.  But it is equally clear that humility is a  permanent necessity as a condition of effort and self-examination. It  is one of the deadly fallacies of Jingo politics that a nation is  stronger for despising other nations.  As a matter of fact, the  strongest nations are those, like Prussia or Japan, which began from  very mean beginnings, but have not been too proud to sit at the feet of  the foreigner and learn everything from him.  Almost every obvious and  direct victory has been the victory of the plagiarist. This is, indeed,  only a very paltry by-product of humility, but it is a product of  humility, and, therefore, it is successful. Prussia had no Christian  humility in its internal arrangements; hence its internal arrangements  were miserable.  But it had enough Christian humility slavishly to copy  France (even down to Frederick the Great's poetry), and that which it  had the humility to copy it had ultimately the honour to conquer.  The  case of the Japanese is even more obvious; their only Christian and  their only beautiful quality is that they have humbled themselves to be  exalted. All this aspect of humility, however, as connected with the  matter of effort and striving for a standard set above us, I dismiss as  having been sufficiently pointed out by almost all idealistic writers.    It may be worth while, however, to point out the interesting disparity  in the matter of humility between the modern notion of the strong man  and the actual records of strong men.  Carlyle objected to the  statement that no man could be a hero to his valet. Every sympathy can  be extended towards him in the matter if he merely or mainly meant that  the phrase was a disparagement of hero-worship. Hero-worship is  certainly a generous and human impulse; the hero may be faulty, but the  worship can hardly be.  It may be that no man would be a hero to his  valet.  But any man would be a valet to his hero. But in truth both the  proverb itself and Carlyle's stricture upon it ignore the most  essential matter at issue.  The ultimate psychological truth is not  that no man is a hero to his valet. The ultimate psychological truth,  the foundation of Christianity, is that no man is a hero to himself.  Cromwell, according to Carlyle, was a strong man.  According to  Cromwell, he was a weak one.    The weak point in the whole of Carlyle's case for aristocracy lies,  indeed, in his most celebrated phrase. Carlyle said that men were  mostly fools.  Christianity, with a surer and more reverent realism,  says that they are all fools. This doctrine is sometimes called the  doctrine of original sin. It may also be described as the doctrine of  the equality of men. But the essential point of it is merely this, that  whatever primary and far-reaching moral dangers affect any man, affect  all men. All men can be criminals, if tempted; all men can be heroes,  if inspired. And this doctrine does away altogether with Carlyle's  pathetic belief (or any one else's pathetic belief) in \"the wise few.\"  There are no wise few.  Every aristocracy that has ever existed has  behaved, in all essential points, exactly like a small mob. Every  oligarchy is merely a knot of men in the street--that is to say, it is  very jolly, but not infallible.  And no oligarchies in the world's  history have ever come off so badly in practical affairs as the very  proud oligarchies--the oligarchy of Poland, the oligarchy of Venice.  And the armies that have most swiftly and suddenly broken their enemies  in pieces have been the religious armies--the Moslem Armies, for  instance, or the Puritan Armies.  And a religious army may, by its  nature, be defined as an army in which every man is taught not to exalt  but to abase himself.  Many modern Englishmen talk of themselves as the  sturdy descendants of their sturdy Puritan fathers. As a fact, they  would run away from a cow.  If you asked one of their Puritan fathers,  if you asked Bunyan, for instance, whether he was sturdy, he would have  answered, with tears, that he was as weak as water.  And because of  this he would have borne tortures. And this virtue of humility, while  being practical enough to win battles, will always be paradoxical  enough to puzzle pedants. It is at one with the virtue of charity in  this respect. Every generous person will admit that the one kind of sin  which charity should cover is the sin which is inexcusable.  And every  generous person will equally agree that the one kind of pride which is  wholly damnable is the pride of the man who has something to be proud  of. The pride which, proportionally speaking, does not hurt the  character, is the pride in things which reflect no credit on the person  at all. Thus it does a man no harm to be proud of his country, and  comparatively little harm to be proud of his remote ancestors. It does  him more harm to be proud of having made money, because in that he has  a little more reason for pride. It does him more harm still to be proud  of what is nobler than money--intellect.  And it does him most harm of  all to value himself for the most valuable thing on earth--goodness.  The man who is proud of what is really creditable to him is the  Pharisee, the man whom Christ Himself could not forbear to strike.    My objection to Mr. Lowes Dickinson and the reassertors of the pagan  ideal is, then, this.  I accuse them of ignoring definite human  discoveries in the moral world, discoveries as definite, though not as  material, as the discovery of the circulation of the blood. We cannot  go back to an ideal of reason and sanity. For mankind has discovered  that reason does not lead to sanity. We cannot go back to an ideal of  pride and enjoyment.  For mankind has discovered that pride does not  lead to enjoyment.

Now, my brethren and sisters, I know that my Redeemer lives. I feel  it in every fiber of my being. I am just as satisfied of it as I am  of my own existence. I cannot feel more sure of my own being than  I do that my Redeemer lives, and that my God lives, the Father of  my Savior. I feel it in my soul; I am converted to it in my whole  being. I bear testimony to you that this is the doctrine of Christ,  the gospel of Jesus, which is the power of God unto salvation. It is  \"Mormonism.\"--_Sermon in Tabernacle,_ Salt Lake City, March 16, 1902.    OUR PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. If there is one principle of the gospel  of Jesus Christ that goes directly to the very foundation of justice  and righteousness, it is that great and glorious and God-like principle  that every man will have to render an account for that which he does,  and every man will be rewarded for his works, whether they be good or  evil.--_Improvement Era,_ Vol. 21, p. 104.    THE CHURCH A DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION. The Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints is the most democratic institution in the  world.--_Improvement Era,_ Vol. 21, p. 100.    HOW TO SECURE GOD'S BLESSING. If we desire a continuation of the  blessings of the Lord, we must do his will {85} and obey the laws on  which his blessings are predicated. There is no other way to obtain his  blessings.--_Improvement Era,_ Vol. 21, p. 99, December, 1917.    JESUS IS THE SON. Jesus Christ is not the Father of the spirits who  have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth, for he is one of  them. He is the Son, as they are sons or daughters of Elohim. So far as  the stages of eternal progression and attainment have been made known  through divine revelation, we are to understand that only resurrected  and glorified beings can become parents of spirit offspring. Only such  exalted souls have reached maturity in the appointed course of eternal  life; and the spirits born to them in the eternal worlds will pass  in due sequence through the several stages or estates by which the  glorified parents have attained exaltation.--_Improvement Era,_ Vol.  19, p. 942.    JEHOVAH, THE FIRSTBORN. Among the spirit children of Elohim, the  first-born was and is Jehovah, or Jesus Christ, to whom all others are  juniors.--_Improvement Era,_ Vol. 19, p. 940    NOTHING TEMPORAL WITH GOD. We ought to be united in all things temporal  as well as spiritual. With God all things are spiritual. There is  nothing temporal with him at all, and there ought to be no distinction  with us in regard to these matters. Our earthly or temporal existence  is merely a continuance of that which is spiritual. Every step we take  in the great journey of life, the great journey of eternity, is a step  in advance or in retrogression. We are here in mortality, it is true;  but we are ahead of that condition we occupied before we came here and  took upon us mortality. We are a step in advance of our former state.  What is the body without the spirit? It is lifeless clay. What is it  that affects this lifeless clay? It is the spirit, it is the immortal  part, the eternal being, that existed before it came here, that exists  within us, and that will continue to exist that by and by will redeem  these tabernacles and bring {86} them forth out of the graves. The  whole mission of ours is spiritual. The work we have to do here,  although we call it temporal, pertains alike to our spiritual and our  temporal salvation. And the Lord has just as much right to dictate, to  counsel, to direct and guide us in the manipulation and management of  our temporal affairs, as we call them, as he has to say one word in  relation to our spiritual affairs. So far as he is concerned there is  no difference in this regard. He looks upon us as immortal beings. Our  bodies are designed to become eternal and spiritual. God is spiritual  himself, although he has a body of flesh and bone as Christ has. Yet he  is spiritual, and those who worship him must do so in spirit and truth.  And when you come to separate the spiritual from the temporal, see that  you do not make a mistake.--_Deseret Weekly News,_ Vol. 23, July 16,  1884, p. 466.    THE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. The important consideration is not how  long we can live, but how well we can learn the lessons of life,  and discharge our duties and obligations to God and to each other.  One of the main purposes of our existence is that we might conform  to the image and likeness of Him who sojourned in the flesh without  blemish--immaculate, pure, and spotless! Christ came not only to atone  for the sins of the world, but to set an example before all men, and  to establish the standard of God's perfection, of God's law, and of  obedience to the Father.--_Improvement Era,_ Vol. 21, 1917, p. 104.    {87}        CHAPTER VI    THE PURPOSE AND THE MISSION OF THE CHURCH    THE KINGDOM OF GOD DEFINED. What I mean by the kingdom of God is the  organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, over  which the son of God presides, and not man. That is what I mean. I mean  the kingdom of which Christ is the King and not man. If any man object  to Christ, the Son of God, being King of Israel, let him object, and go  to hell just as quick as he please.--_Oct. C. R.,_ 1906, p. 9.    \"MORMONISM\" DEFINED. I desire to say that \"Mormonism,\" as it is called,  is still, as always, nothing more and nothing less than the power of  God unto salvation, unto every soul that will receive it honestly and  will obey it. I say to you, my brethren, sisters and friends, that all  Latter-day Saints, wherever you find them, provided they are true to  their name, to their calling and to their understanding of the gospel,  are people who stand for truth and for honor, for virtue and for purity  of life, for honesty in business and in religion; people who stand for  God and for his righteousness, for God's truth and his work in the  earth, which aims, for the salvation of the children of men, for their  salvation from the evils of the world, from the pernicious habits of  wicked men and from all those things that degrade, dishonor or destroy;  or tend to lessen the vitality and life, the honor and godliness among  the people of the earth.--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1910, p. 5.    THE MISSION OF THE CHURCH. Our mission has been to save men. We have  been laboring all these eighty-odd years of the Church to bring men to  a knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ, to bring them to repentance,  to obedience {88} to the requirements of God's law. We have been  striving to save men from error, to persuade them to turn away from  evil and to learn to do good. Now if our enemies will only charge us  with doing this, all right; and if they wish to oppose us for doing  this, that is their business; but when they charge us with doing  that which we have not done, believing that which we do not believe,  practicing that which we have never practiced, then I pity them. I  pity them because they are doing it in ignorance, or because they are  wilfully disposed to misrepresent the truth.--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1912, pp.  3, 4.    THE PLAN OF LIFE RESTORED. It is the plan of life that the Almighty  has restored to man in the latter days for the salvation of the souls  of men, not only in the world to come, but in our present life,  for the Lord has instituted his work that his people may enjoy the  blessings of this life to the utmost; that they should be saved in  this present life, as well as in the life to come, that they should  lay the foundation here for immunity from sin and all its effects and  consequences, that they may obtain an inheritance in the kingdom of God  beyond this vale of tears. The gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of  God unto salvation, and it is absolutely necessary for every man and  woman in the Church of Christ to work righteousness, to observe the  laws of God, and keep the commandments that he has given, in order that  they may avail themselves of the power of God unto salvation in this  life.--_Oct. C. R.,_ 1907, p. 2.    OUR MISSION IS TO SAVE. Our mission is to save, to preserve from  evil, to exalt mankind, to bring light and truth into the world, to  prevail upon the people of the earth to walk righteously before God,  and to honor him in their lives and with the first fruits of all their  substance and increase, that their barns may be filled with plenty  and, figuratively speaking, that \"their presses may burst out with new  wine.\"--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1907, p. 118.    {89} THE GOSPEL MESSAGE. I rejoice exceedingly in the truth. I thank  God every day of my life for his mercy and kindness, and loving care  and protection that have been extended to all his people, and for the  many manifestations of his peculiar mercy and blessings that have been  extended unto us throughout all the length and breadth of the land and  through all the years since the organization of the Church, on the 6th  of April, 1830.    The Lord, about that time, or soon after, decreed a decree which he  said his people should realize, that they should begin from that very  hour to prevail over all their enemies, and, inasmuch as they continued  to be faithful in keeping his laws he had given unto them, it was  decreed that they should prevail until all enemies were subdued--not  subdued by violence, nor the spirit of contention nor of warfare, but  subdued by the power of eternal truth, by the majesty and power of  Almighty God, but by the increased power of the righteous and of the  upright covenanted people of God--should be magnified and increased,  until the world shall bow and acknowledge that Jesus is the Christ, and  that there is a people preparing for his coming in power and glory to  the earth again.    We carry to the world the olive branch of peace. We present to the  world the law of God, the word of the Lord, "]]]
