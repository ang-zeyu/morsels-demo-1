'Why, really,' says Timotheus, 'it is no such easy matter, Harmonides, to  become a public character, or to gain the prestige and distinction to  which you aspire; and if you propose to set about it by performing in  public, you will find it a long business, and at the best will never  achieve a universal reputation. Where will you find a theatre or circus  large enough to admit the whole nation as your audience? But if you would  attain your object and become known, take this hint. By all means perform  occasionally in the theatres, but do not concern yourself with the  public. Here is the royal road to fame: get together a small and select  audience of connoisseurs, real experts, whose praise, whose blame are  equally to be relied upon; display your skill to these; and if you can  win _their_ approval, you may rest content that in a single hour you  have gained a national reputation. I argue thus. If you are known to be  an admirable performer by persons who are themselves universally known  and admired, what have you to do with public opinion? Public opinion must  inevitably follow the opinion of the best judges. The public after all is  mainly composed of untutored minds, that know not good from bad  themselves; but when they hear a man praised by the great authorities,  they take it for granted that he is not undeserving of praise, and praise  him accordingly. It is the same at the games: most of the spectators know  enough to clap or hiss, but the judging is done by some five or six  persons.'    Harmonides had no time to put this policy into practice. The story goes  that in his first public competition he worked so energetically at his  flute, that he breathed his last into it, and expired then and there,  before he could be crowned. His first Dionysiac performance was also his  last.    But Timotheus's remarks need not be confined to Harmonides, nor to his  profession: they seem applicable to all whose ambition prompts them to  exhibit their talents and to aim at the approbation of the public.  Accordingly, when I, like Harmonides, was debating within myself the  speediest means of becoming known, I took Timotheus's advice: 'Who,' I  asked myself, 'is the foremost man in all this city? Whose credit is  highest with his neighbours? Who shall be my _multum in parvo_?'  Only one name could reasonably suggest itself--your own; which stands for  the perfection of every excellence, the glass of culture and the mould of  wit. To submit my works to you, to win _your_ approbation--if such a  thing might be!--were to reach the goal of my desire; for your suffrage  carries the rest with it. Whom, indeed, could I substitute in your place,  and hope to preserve a reputation for sanity? In a sense, no doubt, I  shall be hazarding all on one cast of the die: yet with more truth I  might be said to have summoned the whole population into one audience-  chamber; for your single judgement must assuredly outweigh the rest,  taken individually or collectively. The Spartan kings had two votes each  to the ordinary man's one: but you are a whole Privy Council and Senate  in yourself. Your influence is unequalled in the Court of Literature,  and, above all, yours is the casting-vote of acquittal; an encouraging  thought for me, who might well be uneasy otherwise at the extent of my  hardihood. Moreover, I am not wholly without a claim on your interest, as  belonging to that city which has so often enjoyed peculiar benefits at  your hand, in addition to those which it has shared with the nation at  large; and this encourages me to hope that in the present instance, if  judgement is going against me, and the votes of acquittal are in a  minority, you will use your prerogative, and make all right with that  casting-vote of yours. I may have had successes, I may have made a name,  my lectures may have been well received:--all this amounts to nothing; it  is visionary; it is a mere bubble. The truth must come to light now; I am  put to a final test; there will be no room for doubt or hesitation after  this. It rests with you, whether my literary rank shall be assured, or my  pretensions--but no! with such a contest before me, I will abstain from  words of evil omen.    Ye Gods, give me approval _here_, and set the seal upon my  reputation! I may then face the world with a light heart: he who has  carried the prize at Olympia need fear no other course.          THE SCYTHIAN      Anacharsis was not the first Scythian who was induced by the love of  Greek culture to leave his native country and visit Athens: he had been  preceded by Toxaris, a man of high ability and noble sentiments, and an  eager student of manners and customs; but of low origin, not like  Anacharsis a member of the royal family or of the aristocracy of his  country, but what they call _'an eight-hoof man,'_ a term which  implies the possession of a waggon and two oxen. Toxaris never returned  to Scythia, but died at Athens, where he presently came to be ranked  among the Heroes; and sacrifice is still paid to 'the Foreign Physician,'  as he was styled after his deification. Some account of the significance  of this name, the origin of his worship, and his connexion with the sons  of Asclepius, will not, I think, be out of place: for it will be seen  from this that the Scythians, in conferring immortality on mortals, and  sending them to keep company with Zamolxis, do not stand alone; since the  Athenians permit themselves to make Gods of Scythians upon Greek soil.    At the time of the great plague, the wife of Architeles the Areopagite  had a vision: the Scythian Toxaris stood over her and commanded her to  tell the Athenians that the plague would cease if they would sprinkle  their back-streets with wine. The Athenians attended to his instructions,  and after several sprinklings had been performed, the plague troubled  them no more; whether it was that the perfume of the wine neutralized  certain noxious vapours, or that the hero, being a medical hero, had some  other motive for his advice. However that may be, he continues to this  day to draw a fee for his professional services, in the shape of a white  horse, which is sacrificed on his tomb. This tomb was pointed out by  Dimaenete as the place from which he issued with his instructions about  the wine; and beneath it Toxaris was found buried, his identity being  established not merely by the inscription, of which only a part remained  legible, but also by the figure engraved on the monument, which was that  of a Scythian, with a bow, ready strung, in his left hand, and in the  right what appeared to be a book. You may still make out more than half  the figure, with the bow and book complete: but the upper portion of the  stone, including the face, has suffered from the ravages of time. It is  situated not far from the Dipylus, on your left as you leave the Dipylus  for the Academy. The mound is of no great size, and the pillar lies  prostrate: yet it never lacks a garland, and there are statements to the  effect that fever-patients have been known to be cured by the hero; which  indeed is not surprising, considering that he once healed an entire city.    However, my reason for mentioning Toxaris was this. He was still alive,  when Anacharsis landed at Piraeus and made his way up to Athens, in no  small perturbation of spirit; a foreigner and a barbarian, everything was  strange to him, and many things caused him uneasiness; he knew not what  to do with himself; he saw that every one was laughing at his attire; he  could find no one to speak his native tongue;--in short he was heartily  sick of his travels, and made up his mind that he would just see Athens,  and then retreat to his ship without loss of time, get on board, and so  back to the Bosphorus; once there he had no great journey to perform  before he would be home again. In this frame of mind he had already  reached the Ceramicus, when his good genius appeared to him in the guise  of Toxaris. The attention of the latter was immediately arrested by the  dress of his native country, nor was it likely that he would have any  difficulty in recognizing Anacharsis, who was of noble birth and of the  highest rank in Scythia. Anacharsis, on the other hand, could not be  expected to see a compatriot in Toxaris, who was dressed in the Greek  fashion, without sword or belt, wore no beard, and from his fluent speech  might have been an Athenian born; so completely had time transformed him.  'You are surely Anacharsis, the son of Daucetas?' he said, addressing him  in the Scythian language. Anacharsis wept tears of joy; he not only heard  his mother-tongue, but heard it from one who had known him in Scythia.  'How comes it, sir, that you know me?' he asked.    'I too am of that country; my name is Toxaris; but it is probably not  known to you, for I am a man of no family.'    'Are you that Toxaris,' exclaimed the other, 'of whom I heard that for  love of Greece he had left wife and children in Scythia, and gone to  Athens, and was there dwelling in high honour?'    'What, is my name still remembered among you?--Yes, I am Toxaris.'    'Then,' said Anacharsis, 'you see before you a disciple, who has caught  your enthusiasm for Greece; it was with no other object than this that I  set out on my travels. The hardships I have endured in the countries  through which I passed on my way hither are infinite; and I had already  decided, when I met you, that before the sun set I would return to my  ship; so much was I disturbed at the strange and outlandish sights that I  have seen. And now, Toxaris, I adjure you by Scimetar and Zamolxis, our  country's Gods,--take me by the hand, be my guide, and make me acquainted  with all that is best in Athens and in the rest of Greece; their great  men, their wise laws, their customs, their assemblies, their  constitution, their everyday life."]]]
