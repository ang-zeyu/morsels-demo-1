He would marry the girl, go to the country, live  there quietly until the British evacuated Philadelphia, when he would  return and cast his lot with the Jarrett household.    Howell donned citizen's dress, and the wedding took place in the spacious  best room of the mansion, but as he slipped the ring on the finger of his  bride the roll of a drum was heard advancing up the steps into the room,  then on and away until all was still again. The young colonel was pale;  Ruth clung to him in terror; clergymen and guests looked at each other in  amazement. Now there were voices at the porch, the door was flung open,  armed men entered, and the bridegroom was a prisoner. He was borne to his  quarters, and afterward tried for desertion, for a servant in the Jarrett  household, hating all English and wishing them to suffer, even at each  other's hands, had betrayed the plan of his master's guest. The  court-martial found him guilty and condemned him to be shot. When the  execution took place, Ruth, praying and sobbing in her chamber, knew that  her husband was no more. The distant sound of musketry reverberated like  the roll of a drum.          THE MISSING SOLDIER OF VALLEY FORGE    During the dreadful winter of the American encampment at Valley Forge six  or eight soldiers went out to forage for provisions. Knowing that little  was to be hoped for near the camp of their starving comrades, they set  off in the direction of French Creek. At this stream the party separated,  and a little later two of the men were attacked by Tory farmers. Flying  along the creek for some distance they came to a small cave in a bluff,  and one of them, a young Southerner named Carrington, scrambled into it.  His companion was not far behind, and was hurrying toward the cave, when  he was arrested by a rumble and a crash: a block of granite, tons in  weight, that had hung poised overhead, slid from its place and completely  blocked the entrance. The stifled cry of despair from the living occupant  of the tomb struck to his heart. He hid in a neighboring wood until the  Tories had dispersed, then, returning to the cave, he strove with might  and main to stir the boulder from its place, but without avail.    When he reached camp, as he did next day, he told of this disaster, but  the time for rescue was believed to be past, or the work was thought to  be too exhausting and dangerous for a body of men who had much ado to  keep life in their own weak frames. It was a double tragedy, for the  young man's sweetheart never recovered from the shock that the news  occasioned, and on her tomb, near Richmond, Virginia, these words are  chiselled: \"Died, of a broken heart, on the 1st of March, 1780, Virginia  Randolph, aged 21 years, 9 days. Faithful unto death.\" In the summer of  1889 some workmen, blasting rock near the falls on French Creek,  uncovered the long-concealed cavern and found there a skeleton with a few  rags of a Continental uniform. In a bottle beside it was an account,  signed by Arthur L. Carrington, of the accident that had befallen him,  and a letter declaring undying love for his sweetheart.    He had starved to death. The bones were neatly coffined, and were sent to  Richmond to be buried beside those of the faithful Miss Randolph.          THE LAST SHOT AT GERMANTOWN    Many are the tales of prophecy that have been preserved to us from war  times. In the beginning of King Philip's war in Connecticut, in 1675, it  was reported that the firing of the first gun was heard all over the  State, while the drumbeats calling settlers to defence were audible eight  miles away. Braddock's defeat and the salvation of Washington were  foretold by a Miami chief at a council held in Fort Ponchartrain, on  Detroit River, the ambush and the slaughter having been revealed to him  in a dream. The victims of that battle, too, had been apprised, for one  or two nights before the disaster a young lieutenant in Braddock's  command saw his fellow-officers pass through his tent, bloody and torn,  and when the first gun sounded he knew that it spoke the doom of nearly  all his comrades. At Killingly, Connecticut, in the autumn before the  outbreak of the Revolution, a distant roar of artillery was heard for a  whole day and night in the direction of Boston, mingled with a rattle of  musketry, and so strong was the belief that war had begun and the British  were advancing, that the minute men mustered to await orders. It was  afterward argued that these noises came from an explosion of meteors, a  shower of these missiles being then in progress, invisible, of course, in  the day-time. Just after the signing of the Declaration of Independence  the royal arms on the spire of the Episcopal church at Hampton, Virginia,  were struck off by lightning. Shortly before the surrender of Cornwallis  a display of northern lights was seen in New England, the rays taking the  form of cannon, facing southward. In Connecticut sixty-four of these guns  were counted.    At the battle of Germantown the Americans were enraged by the killing of  one of their men who had gone out with a flag of truce. He was shot from  the windows of Judge Chew's house, which was crowded with British  soldiers, and as he fell to the lawn, dyeing the peaceful emblem with his  blood, at least one of the Continentals swore that his death should be  well avenged. The British reinforcements, sixteen thousand strong, came  hurrying through the street, their officers but half-dressed, so urgent  had been the summons for their aid. Except for their steady tramp the  place was silent; doors were locked and shutters bolted, and if people  were within doors no sign of them was visible. General Agnew alone of all  the troop seemed depressed and anxious. Turning to an aide as they passed  the Mennonist graveyard, he said, \"This field is the last I shall fight  on.\"    An eerie face peered over the cemetery wall, a scarred, unshaven face  framed in long hair and surmounting a body clothed in skins, with the  question, \"Is that the brave General Gray who beat the rebels at Paoli?\"  One of the soldiers, with a careless toss of the hand, seemed to indicate  General Agnew. A moment later there was a report, a puff of smoke from  the cemetery wall, and a bullet whizzed by the head of the general, who  smiled wanly, to encourage his men. Summary execution would have been  done upon the stranger had not a body of American cavalry dashed against  the red-coats at that moment, and a fierce contest was begun. When the  day was over, General Agnew, who had been separated from his command in  the confusion of battle, came past the graves again. Tired and depressed,  he drew rein for a moment to breathe the sweet air, so lately fouled with  dust and smoke, and to watch the gorgeous light of sunset. Again, like a  malignant genius of the place, the savage-looking stranger arose from  behind the wall. A sharp report broke the quiet of evening and awoke  clattering echoes from the distant houses. A horse plunged and General  Agnew rolled from his saddle, dead: the last victim in the strife at  Germantown.          A BLOW IN THE DARK    The Tory Manheim sits brooding in his farmhouse near Valley Forge, and  his daughter, with a hectic flush on her cheek, looks out into the  twilight at the falling snow. She is worn and ill; she has brought on a  fever by exposure incurred that very day in a secret journey to the  American camp, made to warn her lover of another attempt on the life of  Washington, who must pass her father's house on his return from a distant  settlement. The Tory knows nothing of this; but he starts whenever the  men in the next room rattle the dice or break into a ribald song, and a  frown of apprehension crosses his face as the foragers crunch by,  half-barefoot, through the snow. The hours go on, and the noise in the  next room increases; but it hushes suddenly when a knock at the door is  heard. The Tory opens it, and trembles as a tall, grave man, with the  figure of an athlete, steps into the fire-light and calmly removes his  gloves. \"I have been riding far,\" said he. \"Can you give me some food and  the chance to sleep for an hour, until the storm clears up?\"    Manheim says that he can, and shuffling into the next room, he whispers,  \"Washington!\" The girl is sent out to get refreshments. It is in vain  that she seeks to sign or speak to the man who sits there so calmly  before the fire, for her father is never out of sight or hearing. After  Washington has finished his modest repast he asks to be left to himself  for a while, but the girl is told to conduct him to the room on the left  of the landing on the next floor.    Her father holds the candle at the foot of the stairs until he sees his  guest enter; then he bids his daughter go to her own bed, which is in the  chamber on the right of the landing. There is busy whispering in the room  below after that, and the dice box is shaken to see to whose lot it shall  fall to steal up those stairs and stab Washington in his sleep. An hour  passes and all in the house appear to be at rest, but the stairs creak  slightly as Manheim creeps upon his prey. He blows his candle out and  softly enters the chamber on the left. The men, who listen in the dark at  the foot of the stair, hear a moan, and the Tory hurries back with a  shout of gladness, for the rebel chief is no more and Howe's reward will  enrich them for life.    Glasses are filled, and in the midst of the rejoicing a step is heard on  the stair. Washington stands before them. In calm, deep tones he thanks  the farmer for his shelter, and asks that his horse be brought to the  door and his reckoning be made out. The Tory stares as one bereft. Then  he rushes aloft, flings open the door of the room on the left,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6622"],[0,"Legends That Every Child Should Know; a Selection of the Great Legends of All (#20)"],[1," yield thee, Percy!\" Douglas said,      \"And in faith I will thee bring    Where thou shalt high advanced be      By James, our Scottish king.      \"Thy ransom I will freely give,      And this report of thee,    Thou art the most courageous knight      That ever I did see.\"      \"No, Douglas,\" quoth Earl Percy then,       \"Thy proffer I do scorn;    I will not yield to any Scot      That ever yet was born.\"      With that there came an arrow keen,      Out of an English bow,    Which struck Earl Douglas on the breast      A deep and deadly blow.      Who never said more words than these:      \"Fight on, my merry men all!    For why, my life is at an end,      Lord Percy sees my fall.\"      Then leaving life, Earl Percy took      The dead man by the hand;    Who said, \"Earl Douglas, for thy life     Would I had lost my land!      \"O Christ! my very heart doth bleed      For sorrow for thy sake,    For sure a more redoubted knight      Mischance could never take.\"      A knight amongst the Scots there was      Which saw Earl Douglas die,    Who straight in heart did vow revenge      Upon the Lord Percy.      Sir Hugh Montgomery was he called,      Who, with a spear full bright,    Well mounted on a gallant steed,      Ran fiercely through the fight,      And past the English archers all,      Without all dread or fear,    And through Earl Percy's body then      He thrust his hateful spear.      With such a vehement force and might      His body he did gore,    The staff ran through the other side      A large cloth-yard, and more.      Thus did both those nobles die,      Whose courage none could stain;    An English archer then perceived      The noble earl was slain.      He had a good bow in his hand      Made of a trusty tree;    An arrow of a cloth-yard long      To the hard head haled he.      Against Sir Hugh Montgomery      His shaft full right he set;    The gray-goose-wing that was thereon      In his heart's blood was wet.      This fight from break of day did last      Till setting of the sun,    For when they rang the evening-bell      The battle scarce was done.      With stout Earl Percy there was slain      Sir John of Egerton,    Sir Robert Harcliff and Sir William,      Sir James, that bold baron.      And with Sir George and Sir James,      Both knights of good account,    Good Sir Ralph Raby there was slain,      Whose prowess did surmount.      For Witherington needs must I wail      As one in doleful dumps.    For when his legs were smitten off,      He fought upon his stumps.      And with Earl Douglas there was slain      Sir Hugh Montgomery,    And Sir Charles Morrell, that from field      One foot would never flee;      Sir Roger Heuer of Harcliff, too,      His sister's son was he;    Sir David Lambwell, well esteemed,      But saved he could not be.      And the Lord Maxwell, in like case,      With Douglas he did die;    Of twenty hundred Scottish spears,      Scarce fifty-five did fly.      Of fifteen hundred Englishmen      Went home but fifty-three;    The rest in Chevy Chase were slain,      Under the greenwood tree.      Next day did many widows come      Their husbands to bewail;    They washed their wounds in brinish sears.      But all would not prevail.      Their bodies, bathed in purple blood,      They bore with them away;    They kissed them dead a thousand times      Ere they were clad in clay.      The news was brought to Edinburgh,      Where Scotland's king did reign,    That brave Earl Douglas suddenly      Was with an arrow slain.      \"O heavy news!\" King James can say,      \"Scotland may witness be    I have not any captain more      Of such account as he.\"      Like tidings to King Henry came      Within as short a space,    That Percy of Northumberland      Was slain at Chevy Chase.      \"Now God be with him!\" said our king,      \"Since it will no better be;    I trust I have within my realm      Five hundred as good as he.\"      \"Yet shall not Scots nor Scotland say      But I will vengeance take,    And be revenged on them all      For brave Earl Percy's sake.\"      This vow the king did well perform      After on Humble-down;    In one day fifty knights were slain      With lords of great renown.      And of the rest, of small account,      Did many hundreds die:    Thus endeth the hunting in Chevy Chase      Made by the Earl Percy.      God save our king, and bless this land      With plenty, joy, and peace,    And grant henceforth that foul debate      Twixt noble men may cease!          CHAPTER IX    THE FATE OF THE CHILDREN OF LIR      Now at the time when the Tuatha de Danaan chose a king for themselves  after the battle of Tailltin, and Lir heard the kingship was given to  Bodb Dearg, it did not please him, and he left the gathering without  leave and with no word to any one; for he thought it was he himself had  a right to be made king. But if he went away himself, Bodb was given the  kingship none the less, for not one of the five begrudged it to him but  only Lir. And it is what they determined, to follow after Lir, and to  burn down his house, and to attack himself with spear and sword, on  account of his not giving obedience to the king they had chosen. \"We  will not do that,\" said Bodb Dearg, \"for that man would defend any place  he is in; and besides that,\" he said, \"I am none the less king over the  Tuatha de Danaan, although he does not submit to me.\"    All went on like that for a good while, but at last a great misfortune  came on Lir, for his wife died from him after a sickness of three  nights. And that came very hard on Lir, and there was heaviness on his  mind after her. And there was great talk of the death of that woman in  her own time.    And the news of it was told all through Ireland, and it came to the  house of Bodb, and the best of the Men of Dea were with him at that  time. And Bodb said: \"If Lir had a mind for it,\" he said, \"my help and  my friendship would be good for him now, since his wife is not living to  him. For I have here with me the three young girls of the best shape,  and the best appearance, and the best name in all Ireland, Aobh, Aoife,  and Aihbhe, the three daughters of Oilell of Aran, my own three  nurselings.\" The Men of Dea said then it was a good thought he had, and  that what he said was true.    Messages and messengers were sent then from Bodb Dearg to the place Lir  was, to say that if he had a mind to join with the Son of the Dagda and  to acknowledge his lordship, he would give him a foster-child of his  foster-children. And Lir thought well of the offer, and he set out on  the morrow with fifty chariots from Sidhe Fionna-chaidh; and he went by  every short way till he came to Bodb's dwelling-place at Loch Dearg, and  there was a welcome before him there, and all the people were merry and  pleasant before him, and he and his people got good attendance that  night.    And the three daughters of Oilell of Aran were sitting on the one seat  with Bodb Dearg's wife, the queen of the Tuatha de Danaan, that was  their foster-mother. And Bodb said: \"You may have your choice of the  three young girls, Lir.\" \"I cannot say,\" said Lir, \"which one of them is  my choice, but whichever of them is the eldest, she is the noblest, and  it is better for me to take her.\" \"If that is so,\" said Bodb, \"it is  Aobh is the eldest, and she will be given to you, if it is your wish.\"  \"It is my wish,\" he said. And he took Aobh for his wife that night, and  he stopped there for a fortnight, and then he brought her away to his  own house, till he would make a great wedding-feast.    And in the course of time Aobh brought forth two children, a daughter  and a son, Fionnuala and Aodh their names were. And after a while she  was brought to bed again, and this time she gave birth to two sons, and  they called them Fiachra and Conn. And she herself died at their birth.  And that weighed very heavy on Lir, and only for the way his mind was  set on his four children he would have gone near to die of grief.    The news came to Bodb Dearg's place, and all the people gave out three  loud, high cries, keening their nursling. And after they had keened her  it is what Bodb Dearg said: \"It is a fret to us our daughter to have  died, for her own sake and for the sake of the good man we gave her to,  for we are thankful for his friendship and his faithfulness. However,\"  he said, \"our friendship with one another will not be broken, for I will  give him for a wife her sister Aoife.\"    When Lir heard that he came for the girl and married her, and brought  her home to his house. And there was honour and affection with Aoife for  her sister's children; and indeed no person at all could see those four  children without giving them the heart's love.    And Bodb Dearg used often to be going to Lir's house for the sake of  those children; and he used to bring them to his own place for a good  length of time, and then he would let them go back to their own place  again. And the Men of Dea were at that time using the Feast of Age in  every hill of the Sidhe in turn; and when they came to Lir's hill those  four children were their joy and delight for the beauty of their  appearance; and it is where they used to sleep, in beds in sight of  their father Lir. And he used to rise up at the break of every morning,  and to lie down among his children.    But it is what came of all this, that a fire of jealousy was kindled in  Aoife, and she got to have a dislike and a hatred of her sister's  children.    Then she let on to have a sickness, that lasted through nearly the  length of a year. And the end of that time she did a deed of jealousy  and cruel treachery against the children of Lir.    And one day she got her chariot yoked, and she took the four children in  it, and they went forward toward the house of Bodb Dearg; but Fionnuala  had no mind to go with her, for she knew by her she had some plan for  their death or their destruction, and she had seen in a "]]]
