If anyone had dared to have done such a thing he would  have been brought before the High Council and tried, and if proven  against him, he would have been excommunicated from the Church, and  that would have ended polygamy forever, and would also have ended the  man who had dared to introduce such a doctrine without the consent of  the Prophet Joseph.    And deponent further says: Joseph the Prophet, at the City of Nauvoo,  Illinois, some time in the latter part of the year 1843, or the  first part of the year 1844, made a proposition to my sister, Nancy  Rigdon, to become his wife. It happened in this way: Nancy had gone to  Church, meeting being held in a grove near the temple lot on which the  \"Mormons\" were then erecting a temple, an old lady friend who lived  alone invited her to go home with her, which Nancy did. When they got  to the house and had taken their bonnets off, the old lady began to  talk to her about the new doctrine of polygamy which was then being  taught, telling Nancy, during the conversation, that it was a surprise  to her when she first heard it, but that she had since come to believe  it to be true. While they were talking Joseph Smith the Prophet came  into the house, and joined them, and the old lady immediately left  the room. It was then that Joseph made the proposal of marriage to my  sister. Nancy flatly refused him, saying if she ever got married she  would marry a single man or none at all, and thereupon took her bonnet  and went home, leaving Joseph at the old lady's house. Nancy told  father and mother of it. The story got out and it became the talk of  the town that Joseph had made a proposition to Nancy Rigdon to become  his wife, and that she refused him. A few days after the occurrence  Joseph Smith came to my father's house and talked the matter over with  the family, my sister, Mrs. Athalia Robinson also being present, who  is now alive. The feelings manifested by our family on this occasion  were anything but brotherly or sisterly, more especially on the  part of Nancy, as she felt that she had been insulted. A day or two  later Joseph Smith returned to my father's house, when matters were  satisfactorily adjusted between them, and there the matter ended. After  that Joseph Smith sent my father to Pittsburgh, Pa., to take charge of  a little church that was there, and Ebenezer Robinson, who was then the  Church printer, or at least had been such, as he was the printer of the  paper in Kirtland, Ohio, and a printer by trade, was to go with him  to print a paper there, and nine days before Joseph Smith was shot at  Carthage we started, reaching Pittsburgh the day before he was killed.    Deponent further says: I have in my possession a paper called the  _Nauvoo Expositor_, bearing date, Nauvoo, Illinois, Friday, June 7th,  1844, which said paper's printing plant was destroyed by the City  Council at Nauvoo a night or two after that issue. There never was but  one issue of this paper. Joseph Smith the Prophet was then Mayor of the  City of Nauvoo. In the afternoon of the day on which the printing plant  was destroyed, Henry Phelps, a son of W. W. Phelps, came down Main  Street selling this paper, the _Nauvoo Expositor_, and everyone who  could raise five cents bought a copy. In that paper the three following  affidavits appeared, which I reproduce herewith.      AFFIDAVITS        I hereby certify that Hyrum Smith did (in his office) read to me a      certain written document which he said was a revelation from God.      He said that he was with Joseph when it was received. He afterwards      gave me the document to read and I took it to my house and read      it and showed it to my wife and returned it the next day. The      revelation (so called) authorized certain men to have more wives      than one at a time in this world and in the world to come. It said      this was the law, and commanded Joseph to enter into the law. And      also that he should administer to others. Several other items were      in the revelation, supporting the above doctrines.                                                                  Wm. Law.        State of Illinois,        Hancock County.        I, Robert D. Foster, certify that the above certificate was sworn      to before me as true in substance, this fourth day of May, A.D.      1844.                                                   Robert D. Foster, J. P.          I certify that I read the revelation referred to in the above      affidavit of my husband. It sustained in strong terms the doctrine      of more wives than one at a time in this world and in the next. It      authorized some to have to the number of ten, and set forth that      those women who would not allow their husbands to have more wives      than one should be under condemnation before God.                                                                 Jane Law.        Sworn and subscribed before me this 4th day of May, A.D. 1844.                                                   Robert D. Foster, J. P.          To all whom it may concern:        Forasmuch as the public mind hath been much agitated by a course of      procedure in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by a      number of persons declaring against certain doctrines and practices      therein (among whom I am one) it is but meet that I should give my      reasons at least in part as a cause that hath led me to declare      myself. In the latter part of the summer of 1843, the Patriarch      Hyrum Smith did in the High Council, of which I was a member,      introduce what he said was a revelation given through the Prophet,      that the said Hyrum Smith did essay to read the said revelation in      the said council; that according to his reading there was contained      the following doctrines: 1st. The sealing up of persons to eternal      life, against all sins save that of shedding innocent blood or of      consenting thereto; 2nd. The doctrine of plurality of wives or      marrying virgins; that David and Solomon had many wives, yet in      this they sinned not, save in the matter of Uriah. This revelation      with others, evidence that the aforesaid heresies were taught and      practiced in the Church, determined me to leave the office of first      counselor to the President of the Church at Nauvoo, inasmuch as I      dared not teach or administer such laws. And further deponent saith      not.                                                           Austin Cowles.        State of Illinois,        Hancock County.        To all whom it may concern: I hereby certify that the above      certificate was sworn and subscribed before me, this fourth day of      May, 1844.                                                  Robert D. Foster, J. P.                                                          John W. Rigdon.        Sworn to before me this 28th day of July, 1905.        [Seal.]                                               James Jack, Notary Public.      STATEMENT OF ORANGE L. WIGHT    The following confirmation of John W. Rigdon's affidavit is copied from  the _Deseret News_ of Saturday, August 12, 1905:        Bunkerville, Lincoln County, Nev., August 4, 1905:--Seeing the      testimony of J. W. Rigdon in the semi-weekly _News_ of July 31,      and being much interested in the subject, and knowing that there      lived in this place a man that was quite familiar with the early      scenes of church history, especially those in and about Far West,      Missouri, and having heard him say that he had many times visited      his father and the Prophet Joseph, while they were incarcerated in      Liberty jail, I went and interviewed Orange L. Wight (eldest son of      former Apostle Lyman Wight), who is now 82 years old and resides      with his daughter, Sister Harriet M. Earl. Brother Wight is quite      feeble in body, but his mind seems to be as bright as ever.        I found Brother Wight in his usual good humor, and seemed quite      willing to talk, in fact, was pleased to do so. \"Elder Wight,\"      said I, \"are you willing to make a statement for publication in      regard to what you know about Joseph Smith, son of the Prophet      Joseph, being ordained while in Liberty jail to lead the Church?\"      \"Certainly I am.\" \"Then,\" said I, \"just write me out a brief      statement covering those points, and I will give it in your own      words.\" Following is Brother Wight's statement:        \"In regard to the statement of John W. Rigdon, I endorse it in      every point. Brother John W. Rigdon speaks of being in Liberty      prison when the Prophet Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Hyrum Smith,      Lyman Wight, and others were there (the others were Caleb Baldwin      and Alexander McRae). I also visited the prisoners at or about the      same time, and slept with them many times at different periods, and      I cannot recollect of ever hearing the subject of an ordination      mentioned.        \"My father, Lyman Wight, nor my mother, never alluded to it during      their lifetime in my presence; so I take it for granted that      Joseph, the son of the Prophet Joseph Smith, was not ordained to      fill the place of his father, in the Liberty jail. I was born in      the State of New York, November 29, 1823, hence am about seven      years older than Brother John W. Rigdon. And if an ordination of      Young Joseph had occurred in the prison, I would likely have heard      it, and would certainly recollect it.        \"Previous to this, while I was several years younger, the Twelve      Apostles were organized and commissioned to assist in leading and      governing the Church. I can recollect every detail distinctly.      My acquaintance with the Prophet was from the year 1830 to his      martyrdom, and I can truly say he was a Prophet of God, and was      appointed to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50536"],[0,"Gospel Themes: A Treatise on Salient Features of \"Mormonism\" (#20)"],[1,"to the seven seals,  are as seven great days, during which Mother Earth will fulfil her  mortal mission or probation, laboring six days, and resting upon the  seventh, her period of sanctification. We are not to understand,  however, that these seven thousand years include the time during which  the earth was in process of creation and of preparation for man. The  phrase \"temporal existence\" shows that the reckoning began, not before,  but after, time had been decreed.    Earth Obedient to Law.--That this planet is indeed upon probation, and  capable of obeying law, is plainly taught in modern revelation:    \"And again, verily I say unto you, the earth abideth the law of a  celestial kingdom, for it filleth the measure of its creation, and  transgresseth not the law.    \"Wherefore it shall be sanctified; yea, notwithstanding it shall die,  it shall be quickened again, and shall abide the power by which it is  quickened, and the righteous shall inherit it.\"--(D. and C. 88:25-26.)    The Sea of Glass.--The key to the Apocalypse, already quoted, begins  with this question concerning earth's glorious future: \"What is the  sea of glass spoken of by John, 4th chapter, and 6th verse, of the  Revelation?\" And the answer is: \"It is the earth, in its sanctified,  immortal, and eternal state.\"    One Day as a Thousand Years.--That the seven thousand years are indeed  as seven great days, is virtually set forth in the Book of Abraham,  where the patriarch, who was deeply learned in astronomy, and taught  that science to the Egyptians, tells of a mighty governing planet  nearest to the throne of God--a planet named Kolob, revolving once in a  thousand years. (Abr. 3.) It is evident that such a day figured in the  warning given to Adam: \"In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt  surely die\" (Gen. 2:17) for Adam, having eaten of the forbidden fruit,  lived on to the age of 930 years. In the Book of Abraham (5:13), it is  explained that the day in question was \"after the time of Kolob; for as  yet the Gods had not appointed unto Adam his reckoning.\"    The Saturday Evening of Time.--According to received chronology, four  thousand years, or four of the seven great days given to this planet  as the period of its temporal continuance, had passed before Christ  came, while nearly two thousand years have gone by since. So that the  sixth day is now drawing to a close, and we stand at the present moment  in the Saturday evening of human history. Morning will break upon the  Millennium, the thousand years of peace, the Sabbath of the world.    Dispensations Inter-Related.--Whatever their number, or the names  by which they may be properly known, it is certain that the gospel  dispensations are inter-related. They are as the links of a mighty  chain, representing God's dealings with man, and extending from the  dawn of creation down to and beyond the present time.    Symbolical and Prophetic.--Those dispensations are likewise symbolical  and prophetic in character, pointing forward and finding their  culmination, their prospective and complete fulfilment, in the great  and final dispensation that is destined to bring about \"the restitution  of all things.\" This is \"Mormonism's\" mission upon earth--\"Mormonism,\"  a nick-name for the Everlasting Gospel, brought back once more for the  purpose of completing the Lord's work as pertaining to this planet,  binding in one the dispensations, and merging them into the last and  greatest of all--the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times.        CHAPTER II.    The Adamic Period    Adam Holds the Keys.--The Prophet Joseph Smith treats thus the theme of  the Gospel dispensations:    \"Commencing with Adam, who was the first man, * * * the first and  father of all, not only by progeny, but the first to hold the spiritual  blessings, to whom was made known the plan of ordinances for the  salvation of his posterity unto the end, and to whom Christ was first  revealed, and through whom Christ has been revealed from heaven, and  will continue to be revealed from henceforth;--Adam holds the keys of  the dispensation of the fulness of times; i.e., the dispensation of all  the times have been and will be revealed through him from the beginning  to Christ, and from Christ to the end of all the dispensations that are  to be revealed.\"--(\"History of the Church,\" Vol. IV, pp. 207, 208.)    \"All Things in Christ.\"--Having cited Paul (Ephesians 1:9,10), as  showing how God \"purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the  fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ,  both which are in heaven and which are on earth,\" the Prophet goes on  to say:    \"Now the purpose of himself, in the winding up scene of the last  dispensation, is that all things pertaining to that dispensation should  be conducted precisely in accordance with the preceding dispensations.    \"And again, God purposed in himself that there should not be an  eternal fulness until every dispensation should be fulfiled and  gathered together in one, and that all things whatsoever that should be  gathered together in one in those dispensations unto the same fulness  and eternal glory, should be in Christ Jesus; therefore he set the  ordinances to be the same forever and ever, and set Adam to watch over  them, to reveal them from heaven to man, or to send angels to reveal  them.    * * * * * * * * * * *    \"This, then, is the nature of the Priesthood: every man holding the  presidency of his dispensation, and one man holding the presidency of  them all, even Adam; and Adam receiving his presidency and authority  from the Lord, but cannot receive a fulness until Christ shall present  the kingdom to the Father, which shall be at the end of the last  dispensation.\"--(Ibid, pp. 208-209.)    Distinctive Features.--Each dispensation stands for some particular  development of God's work. Each period possess certain distinguishing  characteristics, to point out which, rather than to give an exhaustive  narration of events and happenings, is the aim of the present article.  In the Adamic dispensation, or the period during which Adam lived upon  the earth, in addition to the Creation and the Fall, already treated in  previous chapters, we find the following distinctive features:    (1) The institution of the law of sacrifice, foreshadowing the  Atonement that was to be made by the Lamb of God.    (2) The introduction and first promulgation of the Gospel, as a means  of redeeming mankind from the effects of the Fall.    (3) The original exercise of the evangelical power and authority by  Father Adam, the patriarch of the human family.    Sacrifice Instituted.--Respecting the law of sacrifice, it is written:    \"And Adam and Eve, his wife, called upon the name of the Lord, and they  heard the voice of the Lord from the way toward the Garden of Eden,  speaking unto them, and they saw him not; for they were shut out from  his presence.    \"And he gave unto them commandments, that they should worship the Lord  their God, and should offer the firstlings of their flocks, for an  offering unto the Lord. And Adam was obedient unto the commandments of  the Lord.    \"And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying:  Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I  know not, save the Lord commanded me.    \"And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the  sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace  and truth.    \"Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son,  and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son for  evermore.\"--(Moses 5:4-8.)    Revelation Necessary.--Adam knew all about the law of sacrifice--knew  all about it in the spirit; for he was one of those who had sat in  the eternal councils, where the plan of salvation was framed, and the  choice made of a Redeemer and Savior. He helped to form that plan, and  to choose the One who would put it into effect. Adam knew all about  the Lamb of God, slain in theory from the foundation of the world, and  yet to be slain literally upon the earth, an event symbolized by the  sacrifice that he was in the very act of offering, perhaps, when the  angel accosted him. But he had forgotten it all, so great is the change  that comes over the spirit in passing from pre-mortal into mortal  conditions. Hence the necessity of such a visitation, to enlighten  him. Hence, also, the necessity of revelation by the Holy Ghost, the  Comforter, bringing things past to remembrance, showing things to come.    The Gospel's Introduction.--The introduction of the Gospel is thus  narrated:    \"And the Lord God called upon men by the Holy Ghost everywhere and  commanded them that they should repent.\"--(Moses 5:14.)    * * * * * * * * * * *    \"And he called upon our father Adam by his own voice, saying: I am God;  I made the world, and men before they were in the flesh.    \"And he also said unto him: If thou wilt turn unto me, and hearken  unto my voice, and believe, and repent of all thy transgressions, and  be baptized, even in water, in the name of mine Only Begotten Son,  who is full of grace and truth, which is Jesus Christ, the only name  which shall be given under heaven whereby salvation shall come unto the  children of men, ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost; asking  all things in His name, and whatsoever ye shall ask, it shall be given  you.    * * * * * * * * * * *    \"And now, behold, I say unto you: This is the plan of salvation unto  all men, through the blood of mine Only Begotten, who shall come in the  meridian of time.    * * * * * * * * * * *    \"And it came to pass, when the Lord had spoken with Adam, our father,  that Adam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught away by the Spirit of  the Lord, and was carried down into the water, and was laid under the  water, and was brought forth out of the water.    \"And thus he was baptized, and the Spirit of"]]]
