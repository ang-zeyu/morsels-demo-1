Men say our cult is a survival of the ancient Stygian serpent-worship.  That is a lie. Our ancestors came from Vendhya, beyond the Sea of  Vilayet and the blue Himelian mountains. We are sons of the East, not  the South, and we have knowledge of all the wizards of the East, who are  greater than the wizards of the West. And not one of them but would be a  straw in the wind before the black might of Xaltotun.'    'But he was conquered once,' persisted Conan.    'Aye; a cosmic source was turned against him. But now that source is  again in his hands, and he will see that it is not stolen again.'    'And what is this damnable source?' demanded Conan irritably.    'It is called the Heart of Ahriman. When Acheron was overthrown, the  primitive priest who had stolen it and turned it against Xaltotun hid it  in a haunted cavern and built a small temple over the cavern. Thrice  thereafter the temple was rebuilt, each time greater and more  elaborately than before, but always on the site of the original shrine,  though men forgot the reason therefor. Memory of the hidden symbol faded  from the minds of common men, and was preserved only in priestly books  and esoteric volumes. Whence it came no one knows. Some say it is the  veritable heart of a god, others that it is a star that fell from the  skies long ago. Until it was stolen, none had looked upon it for three  thousand years.    'When the magic of the Mitran priests failed against the magic of  Xaltotun's acolyte, Altaro, they remembered the ancient legend of the  heart, and the high priest and an acolyte went down into the dark and  terrible crypt below the temple into which no priest had descended for  three thousand years. In the ancient iron-bound volumes which speak of  the Heart in their cryptic symbolism, it is also told of a creature of  darkness left by the ancient priest to guard it.    'Far down in a square chamber with arched doorways leading off into  immeasurable blackness, the priest and his acolytes found a black stone  altar that glowed dimly with inexplicable radiance.    'On that altar lay a curious gold vessel like a double-valved sea-shell  which clung to the stone like a barnacle. But it gaped open and empty.  The Heart of Ahriman was gone. While they stared in horror, the keeper  of the crypt, the creature of darkness, came upon them and mangled the  high priest so that he died. But the acolyte fought off the being--a  mindless, soulless waif of the pits brought long ago to guard the  Heart--and escaped up the long black narrow stairs carrying the dying  priest, who before he died, gasped out the news to his followers, bade  them submit to a power they could not overcome, and commanded secrecy.  But the word has been whispered about among the priests, and we of Asura  learned of it.'    'And Xaltotun draws his power from this symbol?' asked Conan, still  skeptical.    'No. His power is drawn from the black gulf. But the Heart of Ahriman  came from some far universe of flaming light, and against it the powers  of darkness cannot stand, when it is in the hands of an adept. It is  like a sword that might smite at him, not a sword with which he can  smite. It restores life, and can destroy life. He has stolen it, not to  use against his enemies, but to keep them from using it against him.'    'A shell-shaped bowl of gold on a black altar in a deep cavern,' Conan  muttered, frowning as he sought to capture the illusive image. 'That  reminds me of something I have heard or seen. But what, in Crom's name,  is this notable Heart?'    'It is in the form of a great jewel, like a ruby, but pulsing with  blinding fire with which no ruby ever burned. It glows like living  flame--'    But Conan sprang suddenly up and smote his right fist into his left palm  like a thunderclap.    'Crom!' he roared, 'What a fool I've been! The Heart of Ahriman! The  heart of my kingdom! Find the heart of my kingdom, Zelata said. By Ymir,  it was the jewel I saw in the green smoke, the jewel which Tarascus  stole from Xaltotun while he lay in the sleep of the black lotus!'    Hadrathus was also on his feet, his calm dropped from him like a  garment.    'What are you saying? The Heart stolen from Xaltotun?'    'Aye!' Conan boomed. 'Tarascus feared Xaltotun and wanted to cripple his  power, which he thought resided in the Heart. Maybe he thought the  wizard would die if the Heart was lost. By Crom--ahhh!' With a savage  grimace of disappointment and disgust he dropped his clenched hand to  his side.    'I forgot. Tarascus gave it to a thief to throw into the sea. By this  time the fellow must be almost to Kordava. Before I can follow him he'll  take ship and consign the Heart to the bottom of the ocean.'    'The sea will not hold it!' exclaimed Hadrathus, quivering with  excitement. 'Xaltotun would himself have cast it into the ocean long  ago, had he not known that the first storm would carry it ashore. But on  what unknown beach might it not land!'    'Well,' Conan was recovering some of his resilient confidence, 'there's  no assurance that the thief will throw it away. If I know thieves--and I  should, for I was a thief in Zamora in my early youth--he won't throw it  away. He'll sell it to some rich trader. By Crom!' he strode back and  forth in his growing excitement. 'It's worth looking for! Zelata bade me  find the heart of my kingdom, and all else she showed me proved to be  truth. Can it be that the power to conquer Xaltotun lurks in that  crimson bauble?'    'Aye! My head upon it!' cried Hadrathus, his face lightened with fervor,  his eyes blazing, his fists clenched. 'With it in our hands we can dare  the powers of Xaltotun! I swear it! If we can recover it, we have an  even chance of recovering your crown and driving the invaders from our  portals. It is not the swords of Nemedia that Aquilonia fears, but the  black arts of Xaltotun.'    Conan looked at him for a space, impressed by the priest's fire.    'It's like a quest in a nightmare,' he said at last. 'Yet your words  echo the thought of Zelata, and all else she said was truth. I'll seek  for this jewel.'    'It holds the destiny of Aquilonia,' said Hadrathus with conviction. 'I  will send men with you--'    'Nay!' exclaimed the king impatiently, not caring to be hampered by  priests on his quest, however skilled in esoteric arts. 'This is a task  for a fighting man. I go alone. First to Poitain, where I'll leave  Albiona with Trocero. Then to Kordava, and to the sea beyond, if  necessary. It may be that, even if the thief intends carrying out  Tarascus' order, he'll have some difficulty finding an outbound ship at  this time of the year.'    'And if you find the Heart,' cried Hadrathus, 'I will prepare the way  for your conquest. Before you return to Aquilonia I will spread the word  through secret channels that you live and are returning with a magic  stronger than Xaltotun's. I will have men ready to rise on your return.  They will rise, if they have assurance that they will be protected from  the black arts of Xaltotun.    'And I will aid you on your journey.'    He rose and struck a gong.    'A secret tunnel leads from beneath this temple to a place outside the  city wall. You shall go to Poitain on a pilgrim's boat. None will dare  molest you.'    'As you will.' With a definite purpose in mind Conan was afire with  impatience and dynamic energy. 'Only let it be done swiftly.'           *       *       *       *       *    In the meantime events were moving not slowly elsewhere in the city. A  breathless messenger had burst into the palace where Valerius was  amusing himself with his dancing-girls, and throwing himself on his  knee, gasped out a garbled story of a bloody prison break and the escape  of a lovely captive. He bore also the news that Count Thespius, to whom  the execution of Albiona's sentence had been entrusted, was dying and  begging for a word with Valerius before he passed.    Hurriedly cloaking himself, Valerius accompanied the man through various  winding ways, and came to a chamber where Thespius lay. There was no  doubt that the count was dying; bloody froth bubbled from his lips at  each shuddering gasp. His severed arm had been bound to stop the flow of  blood, but even without that, the gash in his side was mortal.    Alone in the chamber with the dying man, Valerius swore softly.    'By Mitra, I had believed that only one man ever lived who could strike  such a blow.'    'Valerius!' gasped the dying man. 'He lives! Conan lives!'    'What are you saying?' ejaculated the other.    'I swear by Mitra!' gurgled Thespius, gagging on the blood that gushed  to his lips. 'It was he who carried off Albiona! He is not dead--no  phantom come back from hell to haunt us. He is flesh and blood, and more  terrible than ever. The alley behind the tower is full of dead men.  Beware, Valerius--he has come back--to slay us all--'    A strong shudder shook the blood-smeared figure, and Count Thespius went  limp.    Valerius frowned down at the dead man, cast a swift glance about the  empty chamber, and stepping swiftly to the door, cast it open suddenly.  The messenger and a group of Nemedian guardsmen stood several paces down  the corridor. Valerius muttered something that might have indicated  satisfaction.    'Have all the gates been closed?' he demanded.    'Yes, your Majesty.'    'Triple the guards at each. Let no one enter or leave the city without  strictest investigation. Set men scouring the streets and searching the  quarters. A very valuable prisoner has escaped, with the aid of an  Aquilonian rebel. Did any of you recognize the man?'    'No, your Majesty. The old watchman had a glimpse of him, but could only  say that he was a giant, clad in the black garb of the executioner,  whose naked body we found in an empty cell.'    'He is a dangerous man,' said Valerius. 'Take no chances with him. You  all know the Countess Albiona."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4227"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Wireless Message; Or, The Castaways of Earthquake Island (#20)"],[1,"I  said, we will have to trust much to chance. But other people have  been saved by sending messages off into space; and why not we?  Sinking steamers have had their passengers taken off when the  operator called for help, merely by sending a message into space.\"    \"But how can we tell them where to come for us--on this unknown  island?\" inquired Mrs. Anderson.    \"I fancy Captain Mentor can supply our longitude and latitude,\"  answered Tom. \"I will give that with every message I send out, and  help may come--some day.\"    \"It can't come any too quick for me!\" declared Mr. Damon. \"Bless my  door knob, but my wife must be worrying about my absence!\"    \"What message for help will you send?\" Captain Mentor wanted to  know.    \"I am going to use the old call for aid,\" was the reply of the young  inventor. \"I shall flash into space the three letters 'C.Q.D.' They  stand for 'Come Quick--Danger.' A new code call has been instituted  for them, but I am going to rely on the old one, as, in this part of  the world, the new one may not be so well understood. Then I will  follow that by giving our position in the ocean, as nearly as  Captain Mentor can figure it out. I will repeat this call at  intervals until we get help--\"    \"Or until the island sinks,\" added the scientist, grimly.    \"Here! Don't mention that any more,\" ordered Mr. Hosbrook. \"It's  getting on my nerves! We may be rescued before that awful calamity  overtakes us.\"    \"I don't believe so,\" was Mr. Parker's reply, and he actually seemed  to derive pleasure from his gloomy prophecy.    \"It's lucky you understand wireless telegraphy, Tom Swift,\" said Mr.  Nestor admiringly, and the other joined in praising the young  inventor, until, blushing, he hurried off to make some adjustments  to his apparatus.    \"Can you compute our longitude and latitude, Captain Mentor,\" asked  the millionaire yacht owner.    \"I think so,\" was the reply. \"Not very accurately, of course, for  all my papers and instruments went down in the RESOLUTE. But near  enough for the purpose, I fancy. I'll get right to work at it, and  let Mr. Swift have it.\"    \"I wish you would. The sooner we begin calling for help the better.  I never expected to be in such a predicament as this, but it is  wonderful how that young fellow worked out his plan of rescue. I  hope he succeeds.\"    It took some little time for the commander to figure their position,  and then it was only approximate. But at length he handed Tom a  piece of paper with the latitude and longitude written on it.    In the meanwhile, the young inventor had been connecting up his  apparatus. The wires were now all strung, and all that was necessary  was to start the motor and dynamo.    A curious throng gathered about the little shack as Tom announced  that he was about to flash into space the first message calling for  help. He took his place at the box, to which had been fastened the  apparatus for clicking off the Morse letters.    \"Well, here we go,\" he said, with a smile.    His fingers clasped the rude key he had fashioned from bits of brass  and hard rubber. The motor was buzzing away, and the electric dynamo  was purring like some big cat.    Just as Tom opened the circuit, to send the current into the  instrument, there came an ominous rumbling of the earth.    \"Another quake!\" screamed Mrs. Anderson. But it was over in a  second, and calmness succeeded the incipient panic.    Suddenly, overhead, there sounded a queer crackling noise, a  vicious, snapping, as if from some invisible whips.    \"Mercy! What's that?\" cried Mrs. Nestor.    \"The wireless,\" replied Tom, quietly. \"I am going to send a message  for help, off into space. I hope some one receives it--and answers,\"  he added, in a low tone.    The crackling increased. While they gathered about him, Tom Swift  pressed the key, making and breaking the current until he had sent  out from Earthquake Island the three letters--\"C.Q.D.\" And he  followed them by giving their latitude and longitude. Over and over  again he flashed out this message.    Would it be answered? Would help come? If so, from where? And if so,  would it be in time? These were questions that the castaways asked  themselves. As for Tom, he sat at the key, clicking away, while,  overhead, from the wires fastened to the dead tree, flashed out the  messages.          CHAPTER XXII    ANXIOUS DAYS      After the first few minutes of watching Tom click out the messages,  the little throng of castaways that had gathered about the shack,  moved away. The matter had lost its novelty for them, though, of  course, they were vitally interested in the success of Tom's  undertaking. Only Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick remained with the young  inventor, for he needed help, occasionally, in operating the dynamo,  or in adjusting the gasolene motor. Mrs. Nestor, who, with Mrs.  Anderson, was looking after the primitive housekeeping arrangements,  occasionally strolled up the hill to the little shed.    \"Any answer yet, Mr. Swift?\" she would ask.    \"No.\" was the reply. \"We can hardly expect any so soon,\" and Mrs.  Nestor would depart, with a sigh.    Knowing that his supply of gasolene was limited, Tom realized that  he could not run the dynamo steadily, and keep flashing the wireless  messages into space. He consulted with his two friends on the  subject, and Mr. Damon said:    \"Well, the best plan, I think, would be only to send out the flashes  over the wires at times when other wireless operators will be on the  lookout, or, rather, listening. There is no use wasting our fuel. We  can't get any more here.\"    \"That's true,\" admitted Tom, \"but how can we pick out any certain  time, when we can be sure that wireless operators, within a zone of  a thousand miles, will be listening to catch clicks which call for  help from the unknown?\"    \"We can't,\" decided Mr. Fenwick. \"The only thing to do is to trust  to chance. If there was only some way so you would not have to be on  duty all the while, and could send out messages automatically, it  would be good.\"    Tom shook his head. \"I have to stay here to adjust the apparatus,\"  he said. \"It works none too easily as it is, for I didn't have just  what I needed from which to construct this station. Anyhow, even if  I could rig up something to click out 'C.Q.D.' automatically, I  could hardly arrange to have the answer come that way. And I want to  be here when the answer comes.\"    \"Have you any plan, then?\" asked Mr. Damon. \"Bless my shoe laces!  there are enough problems to solve on this earthquake island.\"    \"I thought of this,\" said Tom. \"I'll send out our call for help from  nine to ten in the morning. Then I'll wait, and send out another  call from two to three in the afternoon. Around seven in the evening  I'll try again, and then about ten o'clock at night, before going to  bed.\"    \"That ought to be sufficient,\" agreed Mr. Fenwick. \"Certainly we  must save our gasolene, for there is no telling how long we may have  to stay here, and call for help.\"    \"It won't be long if that scientist Parker has his way,\" spoke Mr.  Damon, grimly. \"Bless my hat band, but he's a MOST uncomfortable man  to have around; always predicting that the island is going to sink!  I hope we are rescued before that happens.\"    \"I guess we all do,\" remarked Mr. Fenwick. \"But, Tom, here is  another matter. Have you thought about getting an answer from the  unknown--from some ship or wireless station, that may reply to your  calls? How can you tell when that will come in?\"    \"I can't.\"    \"Then won't you or some of us, have to be listening all the while?\"    \"No, for I think an answer will come only directly after I have sent  out a call, and it has been picked up by some operator. Still there  is a possibility that some operator might receive my message, and  report to his chief, or some one in authority over him, before  replying. In that time I might go away. But to guard against that I  will sleep with the telephone receiver clamped to my ear. Then I can  hear the answer come over the wires, and can jump up and reply.\"    \"Do you mean you will sleep here?\" asked Mr. Damon, indicating the  shack where the wireless apparatus was contained.    \"Yes,\" answered Tom, simply.    \"Can't we take turns listening for the answer?\" inquired Mr.  Fenwick, \"and so relieve you?\"    \"I'm afraid not, unless you understand the Morse code,\" replied Tom.  \"You see there may be many clicks, which result from wireless  messages flying back and forth in space, and my receiver will pick  them up. But they will mean nothing. Only the answer to our call for  help will be of any service to us.\"    \"Do you mean to say that you can catch messages flying back and  forth between stations now?\" asked Mr. Fenwick.    \"Yes,\" replied the young inventor, with a smile. \"Here, listen for  yourself,\" and he passed the head-instrument over to the WHIZZER's  former owner. The latter listened a moment.    \"All I can hear are some faint clicks,\" he said.    \"But they are a message,\" spoke Tom. \"Wait, I'll translate,\" and he  put the receiver to his ear. \"'STEAMSHIP \"FALCON\" REPORTS A SLIGHT  FIRE IN HER FORWARD COMPARTMENT,'\" said Tom, slowly. \"'IT IS UNDER  CONTROL, AND WE WILL PROCEED.'\"    \"Do you mean to say that was the message you heard?\" cried Mr.  Damon. \"Bless my soul, I never can understand it!\"    \"It was part of a message,\" answered Tom. \"I did not catch it all,  nor to whom it was sent.\"    \"But why can't you send a message to that steamship then, and beg  them to come to our aid?\" asked Mr. Fenwick. \"Even if they have had  a fire, it is out now, and they ought to be glad to save life.\"    \"They would come to our aid, or send,\" spoke Tom, \"but I can not  make their wireless operator pick up our message. Either his  apparatus is not in tune, or in accord with ours, or he is beyond  our zone.\"    \"But you heard him,\" insisted Mr. Damon.    \"Yes, but sometimes it is easier to pick up messages than it is to  send them."]]]
