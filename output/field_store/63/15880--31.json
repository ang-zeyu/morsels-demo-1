The canary band is  wider, and of stronger colour.  The black band around the lower  half is yet wider, and of long velvety  hairs.  It extends in an  oval above the transparent spot fully half an inch, then shades  through peacock blue, and grey to the hairlike black line  enclosing the spot.    The under sides of the wings are pure tan, clouded and lined with  shades of rich brown.  The transparent spots are outlined with  canary, and show a faint line drawn across the middle the long way.    The face is a tiny brown patch with small eyes, for the size of  the moth, and large brown antennae, shaped like those of Cecropia.  The grey band of the costa crosses the top of the head.  The  shoulders are covered with pinkish, yellow-brown hair.  The top  and sides of the abdomen are a lighter shade of the same.    The under side of the abdomen is darker brown, and the legs brown  with very dark brown feet.  These descriptions do the harmonizing  colours of the moth no sort of justice, but are the best I can offer.  In some lights it is a rich YELLOW-BROWN, and again a pink flush  pervades body and wings.    My first experience with a living Polyphemis (I know Telea is shorter,  but it is not suitable, while a giant among moths it is, so that  name is best) occurred several years ago.  A man brought me a living  Polyphemus battered to rags and fringes, antennae broken and three  feet missing.  He had found a woman trying to beat the clinging  creature loose from a door screen, with a towel, before the wings  were hardened for flight, and he rescued the remains.  There was  nothing to say; some people are not happy unless they are killing  helpless, harmless creatures; and there was nothing to do.    The moth was useless for a study, while its broken antennae set it  crazy, and it shook and trembled continually, going out without  depositing any eggs.  One thing I did get was complete identification,  and another, to attribute the experience to Mrs. Comstock in \"A  Girl of the Limberlost\", when I wished to make her do something  particularly disagreeable.  In learning a moth I study its eggs,  caterpillars, and cocoons, so that fall Raymond and I began searching  for Polyphemus.  I found our first cocoon hanging by a few threads  of silk, from a willow twig overhanging a stream in the limberlost.    A queer little cocoon it was.  The body was tan colour, and thickly  covered with a white sprinkling like lime.  A small thorn tree  close the cabin yielded Raymond two more; but these were darker in  colour, and each was spun inside three thorn leaves so firmly that  it appeared triangular in shape.  The winds had blown the cocoons  against the limbs and worn away the projecting edges of the leaves,  but the midribs and veins showed plainly.  In all we had half a dozen  of these cocoons gathered from different parts of the swamp, and we  found them dangling from a twig of willow or hawthorn, by a small  piece of spinning.  During the winter these occupied the place of  state in the conservatory, and were watched every day.  They were  kept in the coolest spot, but where the sun reached them at times.  Always in watering the flowers, the hose was turned on them, because  they would have been in the rain if they  had been left out of doors,  and conditions should be kept as natural as possible.    Close time for emergence I became very  uneasy, because the  conservatory was warm; so I moved them to my sleeping room, the  coolest in the cabin, where a fireplace, two big windows and an  outside door, always open, provide natural atmospheric conditions,  and where I would be sure to see them every  day.  I hung the twigs  over a twine stretched from my dresser to the window-sill.  One  day in May, when the trees were in full bloom, I was working on a  tulip bed under an apple tree in the garden, when Molly-Cotton said  to me, \"How did you get that cocoon in your room wet?\"    \"I did not water any of the cocoons,\" I answered.  \"I have done no  sprinkling today.  If they  are wet, it has come from the inside.\"    Molly-Cotton dropped her trowel.  \"One of them was damp on the top  before lunch,\"  she cried.  \"I just now thought of it.  The moths  are coming!\"  She started on a run and I followed, but stopped  to wash my hands, so she reached them first, and her shout told  the news.    \"Hurry!\" she cried.  \"Hurry!  One is out, and another is just  struggling through!\"  Quickly as I could I stood beside her.  One Polyphemus female, a giant indeed, was clinging to a twig with  her feet, and from her shoulders depended her wings, wet, and  wrinkled as they had been cramped in the pupa case.  Even then she  had expanded in body  until it seemed impossible that she had  emerged from the opening of the vacant cocoon.  The second one had  its front feet and head out, and was struggling frantically to  free its shoulders.  A fresh wet spot on the top of another cocoon,  where the moth had ejected the acid with which it is provided to  soften the spinning, was heaving with the pushing head of the  third.    Molly-Cotton was in sympathy with the imprisoned moths.    \"Why don't you get something sharp, and split the cocoons so they  can get out?\" she demanded.  \"Just look at them struggle!  They  will kill themselves!\"    Then I explained to her that if we wanted big, perfect moths we  must not touch them.  That the evolution of species was complete to  the minutest detail.  The providence that supplied the acid,  required that the moths make the fight necessary to emerge alone,  in order to strengthen them so they would be able to walk and  cling with their feet, while the wings drooped and dried properly.  That if I cut a case, and took out a moth with no effort on its  part, it would be too weak to walk, or bear its weight, and so  would fall to the floor.  Then because of not being in the right  position, the wings would harden half spread, or have broken  membranes and never develop fully.  So instead of doing a kindness  I really would work ruination.    \"Oh, I see!\" cried the wondering girl, and her eyes were large enough  to have seen anything, while her brain was racing.  If you want to  awaken a child and teach it to think, give object lessons such as  these, in natural history and study  with it, so that every  miraculous point is grasped when reached.  We left the emerging moths  long enough to set up a camera outside, and focus on old tree.  Then  we hurried back, almost praying that the second moth would be a male,  and dry soon enough that the two could be pictured together, before  the first one would be strong enough to fly.    The following three hours were spent with them, and every minute  enjoyed to the fullest.  The first to emerge was dry, and pumping  her wings to strengthen them for flight; the second was in condition  to pose, but a disappointment, for it was another female.  The third  was out, and by its smaller size, brighter markings and broad antennae  we knew it was a male.  His 'antlers' were much wider than those of  the first two, and where their markings were pink, his were so vivid  as to be almost red, and he was very furry.  He had, in fact, almost  twice as much long hair as the others, so he undoubtedly was a male,  but he was not sufficiently advanced to pose with the females, and  I was in doubt as to the wisest course to pursue.    \"Hurry him up!\" suggested Molly-Cotton.  \"Tie a string across  the window and hang him in the sunshine.  I'll bring a fan, and  stir the air gently.\"    This plan seemed feasible, and when the twine was ready, I lifted  his twig to place it in the new location.  The instant I touched  his resting-place and lifted its weight from the twine both females  began ejecting a creamy liquid.  They ruined the frescoing behind  them, as my first Cecropia soiled the lace curtain when I was smaller  than Molly-Cotton at that time.  We tacked a paper against the wall  to prevent further damage.  A point to remember in moth culture, is  to be ready for this occurrence before they  emerge, if you do not  want stained frescoing, floors, and hangings.    In the sunshine and fresh air the male began to dry rapidly, and  no doubt he understood the presence of his kind, for he was much  more active than the females.  He climbed the twig, walked the  twine body pendent, and was so energetic that we thought we  dared not trust him out of doors; but when at every effort to  walk or fly he only attempted to reach the females, we concluded  that he would not take wing if at liberty.  By this time he was  fully developed, and so perfect he would serve for a study.    I polished the lenses, focused anew on the tree, marked the limits  of exposure, inserted a plate, and had everything ready.  Then I  brought out the female, Molly-Cotton walking beside me hovering  her with a net.  The moth climbed from the twig to the tree, and  clung there, her wings spread flat, at times setting them quivering  in a fluttering motion, or raising them.  While Molly-Cotton guarded  her I returned for the male, and found him with wings so hardened  that could raise them above his back, and lower them full width.    I wanted my study to dignify  the term, so I planned it to show  the under wings of one moth, the upper of the other.  Then the  smaller antennae and large abdomen of the female were of interest.  I also thought it would be best to secure the male with wings  widespread if possible, because his colour was stronger, his  markings more pronounced.  So I helped the female on a small branch  facing the trunk of the tree, and she rested with raised wings as  I fervently hoped she would.  The male I placed on the trunk, and  with wide wings he immediately started toward the female, while  she advanced in his direction.  This showed his large antennae and  all markings and points especially  note worthy; being good  composition as well,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4912"],[0,"Wacousta : a tale of the Pontiac conspiracy (Complete) (#20)"],[1," of one far less gentle and susceptible than himself.    Between Sir Everard Valletort and Charles de Haldimar, who, it has  already been remarked, were lieutenants in Captain Blessington's  company, a sentiment of friendship had been suffered to spring up  almost from the moment of Sir Everard's joining. The young men were  nearly of the same age; and although the one was all gentleness, the  other all spirit and vivacity, not a shade of disunion had at any  period intervened to interrupt the almost brotherly attachment  subsisting between them, and each felt the disposition of the other was  the one most assimilated to his own. In fact, Sir Everard was far from  being the ephemeral character he was often willing to appear. Under a  semblance of affectation, and much assumed levity of manner, never,  however, personally offensive, he concealed a brave, generous, warm,  and manly heart, and talents becoming the rank he held in society, such  as would not have reflected discredit on one numbering twice his years.  He had entered the army, as most young men of rank usually did at that  period, rather for the agremens it held forth, than with any serious  view to advancement in it as a profession. Still he entertained the  praiseworthy desire of being something more than what is, among  military men, emphatically termed a feather-bed soldier; and, contrary  to the wishes of his fashionable mother, who would have preferred  seeing him exhibit his uniform in the drawing-rooms of London, had  purchased the step into his present corps from a cavalry regiment at  home. Not that we mean, however, to assert he was not a feather-bed  soldier in its more literal sense: no man that ever glittered in gold  and scarlet was fonder of a feather-bed than the young baronet; and, in  fact, his own observations, recorded in the early part of this volume,  sufficiently prove his predilection for an indulgence which, we take  it, in no way impugned his character as a soldier. Sir Everard would  have fought twenty battles in the course of the month, if necessary,  and yet not complained of the fatigue or severity of his service,  provided only he had been suffered to press his downy couch to what is  termed a decent hour in the day. But he had an innate and, perhaps, it  may be, an instinctive horror of drills and early rising; a pastime in  which the martinets and disciplinarians of the last century were very  much given to indulge. He frequently upheld an opinion that must have  been little less than treason in the eyes of a commander so strict as  Colonel de Haldimar, that an officer who rose at eight, with all his  faculties refreshed and invigorated, might evince as much of the true  bearing of the soldier in the field, as he who, having quitted his  couch at dawn, naturally felt the necessity of repose at a moment when  activity and exertion were most required.    We need scarcely state, Sir Everard's theories on this important  subject were seldom reduced to practice; for, even long before the  Indians had broken out into open acts of hostility, when such  precautions were rendered indispensable, Colonel de Haldimar had never  suffered either officer or man to linger on his pillow after the first  faint dawn had appeared. This was a system to which Sir Everard could  never reconcile himself. He had quitted England with a view to active  service abroad, it is true, but he had never taken \"active service\" in  its present literal sense, and, as he frequently declared to his  companions, he preferred giving an Indian warrior a chance for his  scalp any hour after breakfast, to rising at daybreak, when, from very  stupefaction, he seldom knew whether he stood on his head or his heels.  \"If the men must be drilled,\" he urged, \"with a view to their health  and discipline, why not place them under the direction of the adjutant  or the officer of the day, whoever he might chance to be, and not  unnecessarily disturb a body of gentlemen from their comfortable  slumbers at that unconscionable hour?\" Poor Sir Everard! this was the  only grievance of which he complained, and he complained bitterly.  Scarcely a morning passed without his inveighing loudly against the  barbarity of such a custom; threatening at the same time, amid the  laughter of his companions, to quit the service in disgust at what he  called so ungentlemanly and gothic a habit. All he waited for, he  protested, was to have an opportunity of bearing away the spoils of  some Indian chief, that, on his return to England, he might afford his  lady mother an opportunity of judging with her own eyes of the sort of  enemy he had relinquished the comforts of home to contend against, and  exhibiting to her very dear friends the barbarous proofs of the prowess  of her son. Though these observations were usually made half in jest  half in earnest, there was no reason to doubt the young and lively  baronet was, in truth, heartily tired of a service which seemed to  offer nothing but privations and annoyances, unmixed with even the  chances of obtaining those trophies to which he alluded; and, but for  two motives, there is every probability he would have seriously availed  himself of the earliest opportunity of retiring. The first of these was  his growing friendship for the amiable and gentle Charles de Haldimar;  the second the secret, and scarcely to himself acknowledged, interest  which had been created in his heart for his sister Clara; whom he only  knew from the glowing descriptions of his friend, and the strong  resemblance she was said to bear to him by the other officers.    Clara de Haldimar was the constant theme of her younger brother's  praise. Her image was ever uppermost in his thoughts--her name ever  hovering on his lips; and when alone with his friend Valletort, it was  his delight to dwell on the worth and accomplishments of his amiable  and beloved sister. Then, indeed, would his usually calm blue eye  sparkle with the animation of his subject, while his colouring cheek  marked all the warmth and sincerity with which he bore attestation to  her gentleness and her goodness. The heart of Charles de Haldimar,  soldier as he was, was pure, generous, and unsophisticated as that of  the sister whom he so constantly eulogized; and, while listening to his  eloquent praises, Sir Everard learnt to feel an interest in a being  whom all had declared to be the counterpart of her brother, as well in  personal attraction as in singleness of nature. With all his affected  levity, and notwithstanding his early initiation into fashionable  life--that matter-of-fact life which strikes at the existence of our  earlier and dearer illusions--there was a dash of romance in the  character of the young baronet which tended much to increase the  pleasure he always took in the warm descriptions of his friend. The  very circumstance of her being personally unknown to him, was, with Sir  Everard, an additional motive for interest in Miss de Haldimar.    Imagination and mystery generally work their way together; and as there  was a shade of mystery attached to Sir Everard's very ignorance of the  person of one whom he admired and esteemed from report alone,  imagination was not slow to improve the opportunity, and to endow the  object with characteristics, which perhaps a more intimate knowledge of  the party might have led him to qualify. In this manner, in early  youth, are the silken and willing fetters of the generous and the  enthusiastic forged. We invest some object, whose praises, whispered  secretly in the ear, have glided imperceptibly to the heart, with all  the attributes supplied by our own vivid and readily according  imaginations; and so accustomed do we become to linger on the picture,  we adore the semblance with an ardour which the original often fails to  excite. When, however, the high standard of our fancy's fair creation  is attained, we worship as something sacred that which was to our  hearts a source of pure and absorbing interest, hallowed by the very  secrecy in which such interest was indulged. Even where it fails, so  unwilling are we to lose sight of the illusion to which our thoughts  have fondly clung, so loth to destroy the identity of the semblance  with its original, that we throw a veil over that reason which is then  so little in unison with our wishes, and forgive much in consideration  of the very mystery which first gave a direction to our interest, and  subsequently chained our preference. How is it to be lamented, that  illusions so dear, and images so fanciful, should find their level with  time; or that intercourse with the world, which should be the means  rather of promoting than marring human happiness, should leave on the  heart so little vestige of those impressions which characterize the  fervency of youth; and which, dispassionately considered, constitute  the only true felicity of riper life! It is then that man, in all the  vigour and capacity of his intellectual nature, feels the sentiment of  love upon him in all its ennobling force. It is then that his impetuous  feelings, untinged by the romance which imposes its check upon the more  youthful, like the wild flow of the mighty torrent, seeks a channel  wherein they may empty themselves; and were he to follow the guidance  of those feelings, of which in that riper life he seems ashamed as of a  weakness unworthy his sex, in the warm and glowing bosom of Nature's  divinity--WOMAN--would he pour forth the swollen tide of his affection;  and acknowledge, in the fullness of his expanding heart, the vast  bounty of Providence, who had bestowed on him so invaluable--so  unspeakably invaluable, a blessing.--But no; in the pursuit of  ambition, in the acquisition of wealth, in the thirst after power, and  the craving after distinction, nay, nineteen times out of twenty, in  the most frivolous occupations, the most unsatisfactory amusements, do  the great mass of the maturer man sink"]]]
