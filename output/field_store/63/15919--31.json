Whilst the boat was being baled, I walked to the  shore, and prospected our day's work. The forest showed a novel  feature: flocks of cottony mist-clouds curling amongst the trees,  like opals scattered upon a bed of emeralds; a purple haze banked  up the western horizon, whilst milk-white foam drew a delicate  line between the deep yellow sand and the still deeper blue. Far  to the south lay the Serna or prairillon of Sánga-Tánga, a  rolling patch, \"or, on a field vert,\" backed by the usual dark  belt of the same, and fronted by straggling dots that emerged  from the wave--they proved to be a thin line of trees along  shore. We were lying inside the mouth of the \"Habanyaá\" alias the  Shark River, which flows along the south of a high grassy dome,  streaked here and there with rows of palms, and broken into the  semblance of a verdure-clad crater. According to the people the  Nkonje (Squalus) here is not a dangerous \"sea-tiger\" unless a man  wear red or carry copper bracelets; it is caught with hooks and  eaten as by the Chinese and the Suri Arabs. The streamlet is a  favourite haunt of the hippopotamus; a small one dived when it  sighted us, and did not reappear. It was the only specimen that I  saw during my three years upon the West African Coast,--a great  contrast to that of Zanzibar, where half a dozen may be shot in a  single day. The musket has made all the difference.    At 6 A.M. on Friday, March 28, the boat was safely carried over  the bar of Shark River, and we found ourselves once more hugging  the shore southwards. The day was exceptional for West Africa,  and much like damp weather at the end of an English May; the grey  air at times indulged us with a slow drizzle. After two hours we  passed another maritime village, where the farce of yesterday  evening was re-acted, but this time with more vigour. Ignorant of  my morning's private work, Hotaloya swore that it was Sánga-  Tánga. I complimented him upon his proficiency in lying, and poor  Lángobúmo, almost in tears, confessed that he had pointed out to  me the real place. Whereupon Hotaloya began pathetically to  reproach him for being thus prodigal of the truth. Núrya, the  \"head trader,\" coming down to the beach, with dignity and in  force told me in English that I must land, and was chaffed  accordingly. He then blustered and threatened instant death, at  which it was easy to laugh. About 10 A.M. we lay off our  destination, some ten miles south of Dyánye Point. It was a  beautiful site, the end of a grassy dune, declining gradually  toward the tree-fringed sea; the yellow slopes, cut by avenues  and broken by dwarf table-lands, were long afterwards recalled to  my memory, when sighting the fair but desolate scenery south of  Paraguayan Asuncion. These downs appear to be a sea-coast raised  by secular upheaval, and much older than the flat tracts which  encroach upon the Atlantic. We could now understand the position  of the town which figures so largely in the squadron-annals of  the equatorial shore; it was set upon a hillock, whence the eye  could catch the approaching sail of the slaver, and where the  flag could be raised conspicuously in token of no cruiser being  near.    But the glory had departed from Sánga-Tánga (Peel-White? Strip-  White?); not a trace of the town remained, the barracoons had  disappeared, and all was innocent as upon the day of its  creation. A deep silence reigned where the song of joy and the  shrieks of torture had so often been answered by the voice of the  forest, and Eternal Nature had ceased to be disturbed by the  follies and crimes of man.    Sánga-Tánga was burned down, after the fashion of these people,  when Mbango, whom Europeans called \"Pass-all,\" King of the  Urungu, who extend up the right bank of the Ogobe, passed away  from the sublunary world. King Pass-all had completed his  education in Portugal: a negro never attains his highest  potential point of villany without a tour through Europe; and  thus he rose to be the greatest slave-dealer in this slave-  dealing scrap of the coast. In early life he protected the  Spanish pirates who fled to Cape Lopez, after plundering the  American brig \"Mexico:\" they were at last forcibly captured by  Captain (the late Admiral) Trotter, R.N.; passed over to the  United States, and finally hanged at Boston, during the  Presidency of General Jackson. Towards the end of his life he  became paralytic, like King Pepple of Bonny, and dangerous to the  whites as well as to the blacks under his rule. The people,  however, still speak highly of him, generosity being a gift which  everywhere covers a multitude of sins. He was succeeded by one of  his sons, who is favourably mentioned, but who soon followed him  to the grave. I saw another, a boy, apparently a slave to a  Mpongwe on the coast, and the rest of the family is scattered far  and wide. Since Pass-all's death the \"peddlers in human flesh and  blood\" have gone farther south: men spoke of a great depot at the  Mpembe village on the banks of the Nazareth River, where a  certain Ndábúliya is aided and abetted by two Utangáni. Now that  \"'long-sea\" exportation has been completely suppressed, their  only markets must be the two opposite islands.    South of Sánga-Tánga, lay a thin line of deeper blue, Fetish  Point, the eastern projection of Cape Lopez Bay. From Mbango's  Town it is easy to see the western headland, Cape Lopez, whose  low outliers of sand and trees gain slowly but surely upon the  waters of the Atlantic. I deferred a visit until a more  favourable time, and--that time never came.    Cape Lopez is said to have considerable advantages for developing  trade, but the climate appears adverse. A large Catholic mission,  described by Barbot, was established here by the Portuguese: as  in the Congo, nothing physical of it remains. But Mr. Wilson is  rather hard when he asserts that all traces have disappeared--  they survive in superior 'cuteness of the native.    Little need be said about our return, which was merrier than the  outward bound trip. Wind, tide, and current were now in our  favour, and we followed the chords, not the arcs, of the several  bays. At 9.30 P.M. we gave a wide berth to the rollers off Point  Nyonye and two hours afterwards we groped through the outer  darkness into Bwámánge, where the good Azízeh and Asúnye, who  came to receive us, shouted with joy. On the next day another  \"gorilla palaver,\" when a large male was reported to have been  shot without a shadow of truth, detained me: it was the last  straw which broke the patient camel's back. After \"dashing\" to  old King Lángobómo one cloth, one bottle of absinthe, two heads  of tobacco, and a clay pipe, we set out betimes for the fifteen  miles' walk to Mbátá. Various obstacles delayed us on the way,  and the shades of evening began to close in rapidly; night  already reigned over the forest. Progress under such  circumstances requires the greatest care; as in the streets of  Damascus, one must ever look fixedly at the ground, under penalty  of a shaking stumble over cross-bars of roots, or fallen branches  hidden by grass and mud. And the worst of these wet walks is  that, sooner or later, they bring on swollen feet, which the  least scratch causes to ulcerate, and which may lame the  traveller for weeks. They are often caused by walking and sitting  in wet shoes and stockings; it is so troublesome to pull off and  pull on again after wading and fording, repeated during every few  hundred yards, that most men tramp through the brooks and suffer  in consequence. Constant care of the feet is necessary in African  travel, and the ease with which they are hurt--sluggish  circulation, poor food and insufficient stimulants being the  causes--is one of its deplaisirs. The people wash and anoint  these wounds with palm oil: a hot bath, with pepper-water, if  there be no rum, gives more relief, and caustic must sometimes be  used.    We reached Mbátá at 6.15 P.M., and all agreed that two hours of  such forest-walking do more damage than five days along the  sands.    Since my departure from the coast, French naval officers,  travellers and traders, have not been idle. The Marquis de  Compiègne, who returned to France in 1874, suffering from  ulcerated legs, had travelled up the Fernão Vaz, and its  tributary the highly irregular Ogobai, Ogowaï, or Ogowé (Ogobe);  yet, curious to remark, all his discoveries arc omitted by Herr  Kiepert. His furthest point was 213 kilometres east of \"San  Quita\" (Sankwita), a village sixty-one kilometres north (??) of  Pointe Fétiche, near Cape Lopez; but wars and receding waters  prevented his reaching the confluence where the Ivindo fork  enters the north bank of the Ogobe. He made observations amongst  the \"Kamma\" tribe, which differs from the Bakele and other  neighbours. M. Guirold, commanding a cruiser, was also sent to  the estuary of the Rembo or Fernão Vaz, into which the Mpungule  (N'poulounay of M. du Chaillu?), ascended only by M. Aymès,  discharges. The explorers found many shoals and shifting sands  before entering the estuary; in the evening they stopped at the  Ogobe confluence, where a French seaman was employed in custom-  house duties. M. de Compiègne, after attending many palavers, was  duly upset when returning to the ship.    On the Fernão Vaz there are now (1873) five factories, each named  after some French town: Paris Factory, however, had fallen to  ruins, the traders having migrated 150 miles higher up the Kamma  River. Here a certain drunken kinglet, \"Rampano,\" breaks  everything he finds in the house, and pays damages when he  returns to his senses. On March 31st there was a violent quarrel  between the women of two settlements, and the \"reguli\" embarked  with all their host, to fight it out; Rampano was the victor, and  after the usual palaver the vanquished was compelled to pay a  heavy fine.

His father, Gidi  Mavunga, knelt before him on the ground, a mat being forbidden in  the presence: he made the \"batta-palmas\" before he addressed his  \"filho de pistola,\" as he called him, in opposition to filho de  fazenda. The \"king\" had lately been crowned in virtue of his  mother being a uterine sister of his predecessor. Here the goods  and dignity of the father revert after death to his eldest  maternal brother; to his eldest nephew, that is, the eldest son  of the eldest uterine sister, and, all others failing, to the  first born of the nearest maternal relative. This subjection of  sire to son is, however, mainly ceremonious: in private life the  king wears a cotton pagne, and his \"governor\" asserts his birth-  right even by wigging royalty.    We disposed ourselves upon seamen's chests covered with red  baize, fronting the semi-circle of frock-coated \"gentlemen\" and  half-naked dependants and slaves. Proceedings began with the  \"mata-bicho\" de rigueur, the inevitable preliminary and  conclusion of all life-business between birth and burial. The  Congo traveller will hear \"Nganna! mata bicho\" (Master! kill the  worm, i.e., give me a dram), till the words seem, like  \"Bakhshish\" further east, to poison his ears. This excuse for a  drink arose, or is said to have arisen, from some epidemic which  could be cured only by spirits, and the same is the tradition in  the New World (\"Highlands of the Brazil,\" i. chap. 38). Similarly  the Fulas of the Windward coast, who as strict Moslem will not  drink fermented liquors, hold a cup of rum to be the sovereignest  thing in the world for taenia. The entozoon of course gives rise  to a variety of stale and melancholy jokes about the early bird,  the worm that dieth not, and so forth.    A greybeard of our gin was incontinently opened and a tumbler in  a basin was filled to overflowing; even when buying ground-nuts,  the measure must be heaped up. The glass was passed round to the  \"great gentlemen,\" who drank it African fashion, expanding the  cheeks, rinsing the mouth so that no portion of the gums may lose  their share, and swallowing the draught with an affectedly wry  face. The basin then went to the \"little gentlemen\" below the  salt, they have the \"vinum garrulum,\" and they scrambled as well  as screamed for a sup of the precious liquor. I need hardly quote  Caliban and his proposed genuflections.    I had been warned by all the traders of the lower river that  Banza Nokki would be to me the far-famed point of which it was  said,              \"Quern passar o Cabo de Nam             Ou tornará, ou n o,\"    and prepared accordingly. Old Shimbal, the linguist, had declared  that a year would be required by the suspicious \"bush-men\" to  palaver over the knotty question of a stranger coming only to  \"make mukanda,\" that is to see and describe the country. M.  Pissot was forbidden by etiquette to recognize his old employé  (honours change manners here as in Europe), yet he set about the  work doughtily. My wishes were expounded, and every possible  promise of hammocks and porters, guides and interpreters, was  made by the hosts. The royal helmet was then removed, and a  handsome burnous was drawn over the king's shoulders, the hood  covering the berretta in most grotesque guise. After which the  commander and M. Pissot set out for the return march, leaving me  with my factotum Selim and the youth Nchama Chamvu. To the  question \"Quid muliere levius?\" the scandalous Latin writer  answers \"Nihil,\" for which I would suggest \"Niger.\" At the  supreme moment the interpreter, who had been deaf to the  charmer's voice (offering fifty dollars) for the last three days,  succumbed to the \"truant fever.\" He knew something of Portuguese;  and, having been employed by the French factory, he had scoured  the land far and wide in search of \"emigrants.\" He began well;  cooked a fowl, boiled some eggs, and made tea; after which he  cleared out a hut that was declared très logeable, and found a  native couch resembling the Egyptian kafas.    We slept in a new climate: at night the sky was misty, and the  mercury fell to 60° (F.). There was a dead silence; neither beast  nor bird nor sound of water was heard amongst the hills; only at  times high winds in gusts swept over the highlands with a  bullying noise, and disappeared, leaving everything still as the  grave. I felt once more \"at home in the wilderness\"--such,  indeed, it appeared after Boma, where the cockney-taint yet  lingered.                                       Chapter X.                   Notes on the Nzadi or Congo River.        And first, touching the name of this noble and mysterious stream.  Diogo Cam, the discoverer in 1485, called it River of Congo,  Martin von Behaim Rio de Padrao, and De Barros \"Rio Zaire.\" The  Portuguese discoveries utilized by Dapper thus corrupted to the  sonorous Zaïre, the barbarous Nzadi applied by the natives to the  lower bed. The next process was that of finding a meaning.  Philippo Pigafetta of Vicenza,[FN#10] translated Zaïre by \"so,  cioè Sapio in Latino;\" hence Sandoval[FN#11] made it signify \"Rio  de intendimiento,\" of understanding. Merolla duly records the  contrary. \"The King of Portugal, Dom John II., having sent a  fleet under D. Diego Cam to make discoveries in this Southern  Coast of Africa, that admiral guessed at the nearness of the land  by nothing so much as by the complexion of the waters of the  Zaire; and, putting into it, he asked of the negroes what river  and country that was, who not understanding him answered  Zevoco,' which in the Congolan tongue is as much as to say I  cannot tell;' from whence the word being corrupted, it has since  been called Zairo.\"    D'Anville (1749), with whom critical African geography began,  records \"Barbela,\" a southern influent, perhaps mythical, named  by his predecessors, and still retained in our maps: it is the  Verbele of Pigafetta and the Barbele of Linschoten, who make it  issue either from the western lake-reservoir of the Nile, or from  the \"Aquilunda\" water, a name variously derived from O-Calunga,  the sea (?), or from A-Kilunda, of Kilunda (?) The industrious  compiler, James Barbot (1700), mentions the \"Umbre,\" the modern  Wambre, rising in the northern mountains or, according to P.  Labat, in a lake: Dapper (1676), who so greatly improved the  outline of Africa, had already derived with De Barros the \"Rio  Zaïre\" from a central reservoir \"Zaïre,\" whose island, the  Zembre, afterwards became the Vambere, Wambre, and Zambere, now  identified through the Zambeze with the Maravi, Nyassa or Kilwa  water. The second or northernmost branch is the Bancora of modern  maps, the Brankare of Pigafetta, and the Bancari of Cavazzi; it  flows from the same mountain as the Umbre, and Duarte Lopez  (1560) causes it to mingle with the Zaire on the eastern borders  of Pango, at the foot of the Sierra del Crystal. In certain  modern maps the Bankare fork is called \"Lekure,\"and is made to  receive the \"Bambaye.\" The Barbela again anastomoses with the  Luba (?) or northern section of the Coango, including its  influent, the Lubilash; the Kasai (Kasabi) also unites with the  Coango, and other dotted lines show the drainage of the Lualaba  into the Kasai.    The Portuguese, according to Vasconcello, shunning all fanciful  derivations, were long satisfied to term the Congo \"Rio de  Patron\" (Rio do Padrao) from the first of memorial columns built  at its mouth. In 1816 Captain Tuckey's expedition learned with  Maxwell that the stream should be called, not Zaire, but Moienzi  Enzaddi, the \"great river\" or the \"river which absorbs all other  rivers.\" This thoroughly corrupted name, which at once found its  way into popular books, and which is repeated to the present day  even by scientific geographers, suggested to some theorists  \"Zadi,\" the name of the Niger at Wassenah according to Sidi  Harriet, as related by the American, James Riley, of the brig  \"Commerce,\" wrecked on August 28, 1815: others remembered \"Zad\"  which Shaykh Yusuf (Hornemann), misleading Mungo Park, learned to  be the Niger east of Tinbuktu, \"where it turns off to the  southward.\" I need hardly say that this \"Zadi\" and \"Zad\" are  evident corruptions of Bahr Shady, Shary, Shari, Chad, Tsad, and  Chadda, the swampy lake, alternately sweet and brackish, which  was formerly thrown by mistake into the Chadda River, now called  the Binue or Bimúwe, the great eastern fork of the Negro-land  Nile: the true drainage of the Chadda in ancient times has lately  been determined by the adventurous Dr. Nachtigal. Mr.  Cooley[FN#12] applied, as was his wont, a superficial knowledge  of Kibundo to Fiote or Congoese, and further corrupted Moienzi  Enzaddi to Muenya (for Menha or Menya) Zinzádi-this Angolan  \"emendation,\" however, was not adopted.    The natives dwelling upon the Congo banks have, as usual in  Africa, no comprehensive generic term for the mighty artery of  the West Coast. Each tribe calls it by its own name. Thus even in  Fiote we find \"Mulángo,\" or \"Lángo,\" the water; \"Nkoko,\" the  stream, \"Mwánza,\" the river, and \"Mwanza Nnenne,\" the great  river, all used synonymously at the several places. The only  proper name is Mwánza Nzádi, the River Nzadi: hence Zaire, Zaïre,  Zahir, Zaira the \"flumen Congo olim Zaida\" (C. Barlé)--all  corruptions more or less common.    The homogeneous form of the African continent causes a whimsical  family resemblance, allowing for the difference of northern and  southern hemispheres, in its four arterial streams--the Nile and  Niger, the Congo and Zambeze. I neglect the Limpopo, called in  its lower bed Espirito Santo, Maniça, Manhiça (Manyisa), and  Delagoa River; the Cunene (Nourse) River, the Orange River, and  others, which would be first-rate streams in Europe, but are mere  dwarfs in the presence of the "]]]
