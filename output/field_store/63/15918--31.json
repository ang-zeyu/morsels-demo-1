Thanks to its raw material endowment, a   technically skilled labor force, and strong links to German industrial   firms, Austria occupies specialized niches in European industry and   services (tourism, banking) and produces almost enough food to feed   itself with only 8% of the labor force in agriculture. After 11   consecutive years of growth, the Austrian economy experienced a mild   recession in 1993, but growth resumed in 1994. Unemployment is 4.3%   and will likely stay at that level as companies adjust to the   competition of EU membership beginning 1 January 1995. To prepare for   EU membership, Austria's government has taken measures to open the   economy by introducing a major tax reform, privatizing state-owned   firms, and liberalizing cross-border capital movements. Problems for   the 1990s include an aging population, the high level of industrial   subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budgetary   capabilities - the deficit climbed to over 4% of GDP in 1994.

The Karabakh Armenians have declared   independence and seized almost 20% of the country's territory,   creating almost 1 million Azeri displaced persons in the process. Both   sides have generally observed a Russian-mediated cease-fire in place   since May 1994, and support the OSCE-mediated peace process, now   entering its fourth year. Nevertheless, Baku and Xankandi   (Stepanakert) remain far apart on most substantive issues from the   placement and composition of a peacekeeping force to the enclave's   ultimate political status, and prospects for a negotiated settlement   remain dim.    @Azerbaijan:Geography     Location: Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran   and Russia     Map references: Commonwealth of Independent States - European States     Area:   total area: 86,600 sq km   land area: 86,100 sq km   comparative area: slightly larger than Maine   note: includes the exclave of Naxcivan Autonomous Republic and the   Nagorno-Karabakh region; the region's autonomy was abolished by   Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet on 26 November 1991     Land boundaries: total 2,013 km, Armenia (west) 566 km, Armenia   (southwest) 221 km, Georgia 322 km, Iran (south) 432 km, Iran   (southwest) 179 km, Russia 284 km, Turkey 9 km     Coastline: 0 km (landlocked)   note: Azerbaijan borders the Caspian Sea (800 km, est.)

When the two friends reached the hotel, they found Col. Warner already  downstairs.    \"Good-morning, gentlemen!\" he said. \"So you have taken a walk? I never  walk before breakfast, for my part.\"    \"Nor do I often,\" said Melville. \"In this case I was persuaded by my  young friend. I am repaid by a good appetite.\"    \"Can't I persuade you to try a glass of bitters, Mr. Melville?\" asked  the colonel.    \"Thank you, colonel. You will have to excuse me.\"    \"Breakfast's ready!\" announced the landlady, and the stage passengers  sat down at a long, unpainted, wooden table, where the food was of  the plainest. In spite of the impending peril of which they, only, had  knowledge, Herbert ate heartily, but Melville seemed preoccupied.          CHAPTER XXV. MELVILLE MAKES A SENSATION.        Col. Warner seemed in very good spirits. He ate and drank with violent  enjoyment, and was as affable as usual. George Melville regarded him  with curiosity.    \"The man does not appear like a desperado or outlaw,\" he thought. \"There  is nothing to distinguish him from the majority of men one meets in  ordinary intercourse. He is a problem to me, I should like to study  him.\"    Col. Warner did not fail to observe the unconscious intentness with  which Melville regarded him, and, for some reason, it did not please  him.    \"You have lost your appetite, Mr. Melville,\" he said, lightly. \"You have  been looking at me until--egad!--if I were a vain man, I should conclude  there was something striking about my appearance.\"    \"I won't gainsay that, Colonel,\" answered Melville, adroitly. \"I confess  I am not very hungry, and I will further confess that I have something  on my mind.\"    \"Indeed! Better make me your father confessor,\" said the colonel, whose  suspicion or annoyance was removed by this ready reply.    \"So I may, after a while,\" said Melville.    He took the hint, and ceased to regard the colonel.    The latter made himself generally social, and generally popular.    The stage drove round to the door after breakfast, and there was the  usual bustle, as the passengers bestowed themselves inside.    George Melville had intended to watch narrowly the landlord and Col.  Warner, to detect, if possible, the secret understanding which must  exist between them. But he was deprived of an opportunity, for the very  good reason that the landlord had disappeared, and was not again seen  before their departure.    The driver gathered up his reins, cracked his whip, and the stage  started. Herbert looked at George Melville a little anxiously, not  knowing what course he had decided to take. They two, it will be  remembered, were the only ones who knew of the intended attack.    Before the stage started, Melville quietly took the opportunity to hand  his pocketbook to Herbert, saying, briefly: \"It will be safer with you  in case of an attack.\"    \"But won't it be considered suspicious that you have no money about  you?\" suggested Herbert.    \"I have a roll of bills in my pocket-fifty dollars,\" answered Melville.    They had no further opportunity of speaking, as one of the passengers  came up where they were standing.    Herbert had already taken his seat in the coach, when his employer said:  \"Herbert, wouldn't you like to ride outside with the driver?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" answered Herbert, promptly, for he understood, that this was  Mr. Melville's wish.    \"It will give us more room, and you will have a better view.\"    \"Yes, sir; I shall like it.\"    In a quick manner Herbert made the change, taking care not to look  significantly at Melville, as some boys might have done, and thus  excited suspicion.    For the first mile there was very little conversation.    Then Col. Warner spoke.    \"Well, gentlemen,\" he said, \"we are fairly on our way. Let us hope  nothing will mar our pleasure.\"    \"Do you anticipate anything?\" asked George Melville.    \"I! Why should I? We have a skillful driver, and I guarantee he won't  tip us over.\"    \"Mr. Melville was, perhaps, referring to the chance of the stage being  stopped by some enterprising road agent,\" suggested Parker.    \"Oho! Sits the wind in that quarter?\" said the Colonel, laughing  lightly. \"Not the least chance of that--that is, the chance is very  slight.\"    \"You spoke differently yesterday,\" said the German capitalist.    \"Did I? I didn't mean it, I assure you. We are as safe here as if we  were riding in the interior of New York. I suppose I was only whiling  away a few idle minutes.\"    \"I am glad to hear it,\" said the German. \"I shouldn't like to meet any  of these gentlemen.\"    \"Nor I,\" answered Melville; \"but I am prepared to give him or them a  warm reception.\"    As he spoke he drew a revolver from his pocket. He sat next to the door,  and in an exposed situation.    \"Put up your shooting iron, Mr. Melville,\" said Col. Warner, exhibiting  a slight shade of annoyance. \"Let me exchange places with you. I should  prefer the post of danger, if' there is any.\"    \"You are very kind, Colonel,\" said Melville, quietly, \"but I don't care  to change. I am quite satisfied with my seat.\"    \"But, my dear sir, I insist--\" said the Colonel, making a motion to  rise.    \"Keep your seat, Colonel! I insist upon staying where I am,\" answered  Melville.    He was physically far from formidable, this young man, but there was a  resolute ring in his voice that showed he was in earnest.    \"Really, my dear sir,\" said the Colonel, trying to conceal his  annoyance, \"you have been quite misled by my foolish talk. I did not  suppose you were so nervous.\"    \"Possibly I may have a special reason for being so,\" returned George  Melville.    \"What do you mean?\" demanded the Colonel, quickly. \"If you have, we are  all interested, and ought to know it.\"    \"The Colonel is right,\" said the German. \"If you know of any danger, it  is only fair to inform us all.\"    \"I am disposed to agree with you, gentlemen,\" said Melville. \"Briefly,  then, I have good reason to think that this company of passengers has  been marked for plunder.\"    Col. Warner started, but, quickly recovering himself, he laughed  uneasily.    \"Tush!\" he said, \"I put no faith in it. Some one has been deceiving you,  my friend.\"    But the other passengers took it more seriously.    \"You evidently know something that we do not,\" said Parker.    \"I do,\" answered Melville.    Col. Warner looked at him searchingly, but did not speak.    Now was the time to test George Melville's nerve. He was about to take a  bold step.    \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I regret to say that I have every reason to  believe there is a man in this stage who is in league with the road  agents.\"    This statement naturally made a sensation.    There were seven passengers, and each regarded the rest with new-born  suspicion. There seemed, on the whole, about as much reason to suspect  one man as another, and each, with the exception of Melville, found  himself looked upon with distrust.    \"Pooh, Melville! You must have had bad dreams!\" said Col. Warner, who  was the first to recover his self-possession. \"Really, I give you credit  for a first-class sensation. As for you, gentlemen, you may take stock  in this cock-and-bull story, if you like; I shall not. I, for one, have  no fear of my fellow passengers. I regard them all as gentlemen, and  shall not allow myself to be disturbed by any silly fears.\"    The air of calm composure with which the Colonel spoke served to  tranquilize the rest of the passengers, who wished to put credit in his  assurance.    \"The Colonel speaks sensibly,\" said Mr. Parker, \"and unless Mr. Melville  assigns a reason for his remarkable belief, I am disposed to think we  have taken alarm too quick.\"    \"Of course, of course; all sensible men will think so,\" said the  Colonel. \"My friend, we shall be tempted to laugh at you if you insist  on entertaining us with such hobgoblin fancies. My advice is, to put up  that weapon of yours, and turn your attention to the scenery, which  I can assure you, gentlemen, is well worthy of your admiration. Just  observe the walls of yonder canyon, and the trees growing on the  points.\"    \"Gentlemen,\" said Melville, \"I should be glad to take the view of the  last speaker, if I had not positive proof that he is the man who has  agreed to deliver us into the hands of a road agent within the space of  half an I hour!\"    \"Sir, you shall answer for this!\" exclaimed the Colonel, furiously, as  he struggled to secure the weapon, his face livid with passion.    But two passengers, one the German, who, though short, was very  powerful, forcibly prevented him.          CHAPTER XXVI. A COUNCIL OF WAR.        \"Are you sure of what you say?\" asked a passenger, turning with a  puzzled look from George Melville, who, in the midst of the general  excitement produced by his revelation, sat, not unmoved indeed, but  comparatively calm. Courage and physical strength are by no means  inseparable, and this frail young man, whose strength probably was not  equal to Herbert's, was fearless in the face of peril which would daunt  many a stalwart six-footer.    In reply to this very natural question, George Melville repeated the  essential parts of the conversation which had taken place between Col.  Warner and the landlord.    Col. Warner's countenance changed, and he inwardly execrated the  imprudence that had made his secret plan known to one of the intended  victims.    \"Is this true, Col. Warner?\" asked Parker.    \"No, it's a lie!\" returned the colonel, with an oath.    \"Gentlemen!\" said George Melville, calmly, \"you can choose which you  will believe. I will only suggest that this man managed very adroitly  to find out where each one of us kept his money. You can also consider  whether I have any cause to invent this story.\"    It was clear that the passengers were inclined to put faith in  Melville's story.    \"Gentlemen!\" said the Colonel, angrily, \"I never was so insulted in my  life. I am a man of wealth,"]]]
