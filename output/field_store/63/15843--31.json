Certainly the historian may confine himself to the reproduction  of documents, and this is the present tendency.  But these  documents, for periods as near us as the Revolution, are so  abundant that a man's whole life would not suffice to go through  them.  Therefore the historian must make a choice.    Consciously sometimes, but more often unconsciously, the author  will select the material which best corresponds with his  political, moral, and social opinions.    It is therefore impossible, unless he contents himself with  simple chronologies summing up each event with a few words and a  date, to produce a truly impartial volume of history.  No author  could be impartial; and it is not to be regretted.  The claim to  impartiality, so common to-day, results in those flat, gloomy,  and prodigiously wearisome works which render the comprehension  of a period completely impossible.    Should the historian, under a pretext of impartiality, abstain  from judging men--that is, from speaking in tones of admiration  or reprobation?    This question, I admit, allows of two very different solutions,  each of which is perfectly correct, according to the point of  view assumed--that of the moralist or that of the psychologist.    The moralist must think exclusively of the interest of society,  and must judge men only according to that interest.  By the very  fact that it exists and wishes to continue to exist a society is  obliged to admit a certain number of rules, to have an  indestructible standard of good and evil, and consequently to  create very definite distinctions between vice and virtue.  It  thus finally creates average types, to which the man of the  period approaches more or less closely, and from which he cannot  depart very widely without peril to society.    It is by such similar types and the rules derived from social  necessities that the moralist must judge the men of the past.  Praising those which were useful and blaming the rest, he thus  helps to form the moral types which are indispensable to the  progress of civilisation and which may serve others as models.  Poets such as Corneille, for example, create heroes superior to  the majority of men, and possibly inimitable; but they thereby  help greatly to stimulate our efforts.  The example of heroes  must always be set before a people in order to ennoble its mind.    Such is the moralist's point of view.  That of the psychologist  would be quite different.  While a society has no right to be  tolerant, because its first duty is to live, the psychologist may  remain indifferent.  Considering things as a scientist, he no  longer asks their utilitarian value, but seeks merely to explain  them.    His situation is that of the observer before any phenomenon.  It  is obviously difficult to read in cold blood that Carrier ordered  his victims to be buried up to the neck so that they might then  be blinded and subjected to horrible torments.  Yet if we wish to  comprehend such acts we must be no more indignant than the  naturalist before the spider slowly devouring a fly.  As soon as  the reason is moved it is no longer reason, and can explain  nothing.    The functions of the historian and the psychologist are not, as  we see, identical, but of both we may demand the endeavour, by a  wise interpretation of the facts, to discover, under the visible  evidences, the invisible forces which determine them.        CHAPTER II    THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE ANCIEN REGIME    1.  The Absolute Monarchy and the Bases of the Ancien Regime.    Many historians assure us that the Revolution was directed  against the autocracy of the monarchy.  In reality the kings of  France had ceased to be absolute monarchs long before its  outbreak.    Only very late in history--not until the reign of Louis XIV.--did  they finally obtain incontestable power.  All the preceding  sovereigns, even the most powerful, such as Francis I., for  example, had to sustain a constant struggle either against the  seigneurs, or the clergy, or the parliaments, and they did not  always win.  Francis himself had not sufficient power to protect  his most intimate friends against the Sorbonne and the  Parliament.  His friend and councillor Berquin, having offended  the Sorbonne, was arrested upon the order of the latter body.  The king ordered his release, which was refused.  He was obliged  to send archers to remove him from the Conciergerie, and could  find no other means of protecting him than that of keeping him  beside him in the Louvre.  The Sorbonne by no means considered  itself beaten.  Profiting by the king's absence, it  arrested Berquin again and had him tried by Parliament.  Condemned at ten in the morning, he was burned alive at noon.    Built up very gradually, the power of the kings of France was not  absolute until the time of Louis XIV.  It then rapidly declined,  and it would be truly difficult to speak of the absolutism of  Louis XVI.    This pretended master was the slave of his court, his ministers,  the clergy, and the nobles.  He did what they forced him to do  and rarely what he wished.  Perhaps no Frenchman was so little  free as the king.    The great power of the monarchy resided originally in the Divine  origin which was attributed to it, and in the traditions which  had accumulated during the ages.  These formed the real social  framework of the country.    The true cause of the disappearance of the ancien regime was  simply the weakening of the traditions which served as its  foundations.  When after repeated criticism it could find no more  defenders, the ancien regime crumbled like a building whose  foundations have been destroyed.      2.  The Inconveniences of the Ancien Regime      A long-established system of government will always finally seem  acceptable to the people governed.  Habit masks its  inconveniences, which appear only when men begin to think.  Then  they ask how they could ever have supported them.  The truly  unhappy man is the man who believes himself miserable.    It was precisely this belief which was gaining ground at the time  of the Revolution, under the influence of the writers whose work  we shall presently study.  Then the imperfections of the  ancien regime stared all men in the face.  They were  numerous; it is enough to mention a few.    Despite the apparent authority of the central power, the kingdom,  formed by the successive conquest of independent provinces, was  divided into territories each of which had its own laws and  customs, and each of which paid different imposts.  Internal  customs-houses separated them.  The unity of France was thus  somewhat artificial.  It represented an aggregate of various  countries which the repeated efforts of the kings, including  Louis XIV., had not succeeded in wholly unifying.  The most  useful effect of the Revolution was this very unification.    To such material divisions were added social divisions  constituted by different classes--nobles, clergy, and the Third  Estate, whose rigid barriers could only with the utmost  difficulty be crossed.    Regarding the division of the classes as one of its sources of  power, the ancien regime had rigorously maintained that  division.  This became the principal cause of the hatreds which  the system inspired.  Much of the violence of the triumphant  bourgeoisie represented vengeance for a long past of disdain  and oppression.  The wounds of self-love are the most difficult  of all to forget.  The Third Estate had suffered many such  wounds.  At a meeting of the States General in 1614, at which its  representatives were obliged to remain bareheaded on their knees,  one member of the Third Estate having dared to say that the three  orders were like three brothers, the spokesman of the nobles  replied ``that there was no fraternity between it and the Third;  that the nobles did not wish the children of cobblers and  tanners to call them their brothers.''    Despite the march of enlightenment the nobles and the clergy  obstinately preserved their privileges and their demands, no  longer justifiable now that these classes had ceased to render  services.    Kept from the exercise of public functions by the royal power,  which distrusted them, and progressively replaced by a  bourgeoisie which was more and more learned and capable, the  social role of nobility and clergy was only an empty show.  This point has been luminously expounded by Taine:--    ``Since the nobility, having lost its special capacity, and the  Third Estate, having acquired general capacity, were now on a  level in respect of education and aptitudes, the inequality which  divided them had become hurtful and useless.  Instituted by  custom, it was no longer ratified by the consciousness, and the  Third Estate was with reason angered by privileges which nothing  justified, neither the capacity of the nobles nor the incapacity  of the bourgeoisie.''    By reason of the rigidity of castes established by a long past we  cannot see what could have persuaded the nobles and the clergy to  renounce their privileges.  Certainly they did finally abandon  them one memorable evening, when events forced them to do so; but  then it was too late, and the Revolution, unchained, was pursuing  its course.    It is certain that modern progress would successively have  established all that the Revolution effected--the equality of  citizens before the law, the suppression of the privileges of  birth, &c.  Despite the conservative spirit of the Latins, these  things would have been won, as they were by the majority  of the peoples.  We might in this manner have been saved twenty  years of warfare and devastation; but we must have had a  different mental constitution, and, above all, different  statesmen.    The profound hostility of the bourgeoisie against the classes  maintained above it by tradition was one of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44896"],[0,"The Autobiography of Parley Parker Pratt (#20)"],[1,"compelled to flee; and those who fled to Lafayette  County were soon expelled, or the most part of them, and had to  move to wherever they could find protection.    When the news of these outrages reached the Governor of the  State, courts of inquiry, both civil and military, were ordered by  him, but nothing effectual was ever done to restore our rights, or  to protect us in the least. It is true the Attorney-General, and a  military escort under Colonel, afterwards General Doniphan, and our  witnesses went to Jackson County and demanded indictments; but the  court refused to do anything in the case, and the military,  Attorney-General and witnesses were mobbed out of the county; and  thus that matter ended.    The Governor also ordered them to restore the arms of which they  robbed us, but they never were restored. Even our lands were robbed  of their timber, and either occupied by our enemies for years or  left desolate. Soon after Jackson County had rebelled against the  laws and constitution of the General and State governments, several  of the adjacent counties followed the example, by justifying her  proceedings, and by opposing the Saints in settling among them. The  counties of Clay, Ray, Clinton and various others, held public  meetings, the tenor of which was to deprive the members of our  society of the rights of citizenship, drive them from among them,  and to compel them to settle only in such places as these outlaws  should dictate; and even at that time some of their proceedings  went so far as to publicly threaten to drive the whole society from  the State. The excuses they offered for these outrages were:    First: The society were guilty principally of being eastern or  northern people.    Secondly: They were guilty of some slight variations in manners  and language from the other citizens of the State, who were mostly  from the South.    Thirdly: Their religious principles differed in some important  particulars from most other societies.    Fourthly: They were guilty of immigrating rapidly from the  different States, and of purchasing large quantities of land, and  of being more enterprising and industrious than their neighbors.    Fifthly: Some of them were guilty of poverty--especially those  who had been driven, from time to time, and robbed of their all.  And,    Lastly: They were said to be guilty of believing in the present  Government administration of Indian affairs, viz: that the land  west of the Mississippi, which Government had deeded in fee simple  to the immigrating tribes, was destined by Providence for their  permanent homes.    All these crimes were charged upon our society, in the public  proceedings of the several counties, and were deemed sufficient to  justify their unlawful proceedings against us. The reader may smile  at this statement, but the public journals of Upper Missouri in  1835, actually printed charges and declarations against us, of the  tenor of the foregoing.    By these wicked proceedings our people were once more compelled  to remove, at a great sacrifice of property, and were at last  permitted to settle in the north of Ray County, where, by the next  legislature, they were organized into the counties of Caldwell and  Daviess. Here again they exercised the utmost industry and  enterprise, and these wild regions soon presented a more  flourishing aspect than the oldest counties of the State.    In the meantime, the majority of the State so far countenanced  these outrages that they actually elected Lilburn W. Boggs (one of  the oldest actors in the scenes of Jackson County, who had assisted  in murder and plunder, and the expulsion of twelve hundred  citizens, in 1833) for Governor of the State, and placed him in the  executive chair, instead of suspending him by the neck, between the  heavens and the earth, as his crimes justly merited. This movement  may be said to have put an end to liberty, law and government in  that State. About this time, Colonel Lucas, a leader of the  banditti, was elected Major-General, instead of being hung for  treason and murder. And Moses Wilson, another leader of the mob,  was elected Brigadier-General and others were advanced accordingly.  These all very readily received their commissions from their  accomplice, Governor Boggs, and thus corruption, rebellion and  conspiracy had spread on every side, being fostered and encouraged  by a large majority of the State; and thus the treason became  general.    In the meantime, our society had greatly increased by a rapid  immigration, and having long felt the withering hand of oppression  from so corrupt an administration, they had endeavored to organize  themselves, both civil and military, in the counties where they  composed the majority, by electing such officers as they thought  would stand for equal rights, and for the laws and Constitution of  the country. In this way they hoped to withstand the storm which  had so long beaten upon them, and whose black clouds now seemed  lowering in awful gloom, preparing to burst with overwhelming fury  upon all who dared to stand for liberty and law.      CHAPTER XIV.  ------------------------    Labors in Clay County:--Conference:--Appointment  to a Tedious Journey:--A Case of Healing:--Arrive at  Kirtland:--Revelation:--Travel Eastward, in Company with  President Joseph Smith:--Conference in Geneseo:--Pleasing  Reminiscence:--President Smith and Others Return Home:--Visit  Sackett's Harbor:--Crowded Meeting:--Requested to Visit the  Sick:--A Little Boy Healed:--Baptisms, etc.:--Miraculous  Gifts:--Lying Priests and Rabble:--Visit my Parents in Canaan,  N. Y.:--Return to Kirtland.    As the history of this horrible persecution of the Church was  interwoven with my own, I have traced it for a few years in  connection; in which I have of necessity digressed from the main  thread of my own personal narrative, to which I mast return.    After making our escape into the county of Clay--being reduced  to the lowest poverty--I made a living by day labor, jobbing,  building, or wood cutting, till some time in the winter of 1834,  when a general Conference was held at my house, in which it was  decided that two of the Elders should be sent to Ohio, in order to  counsel with President Smith and the Church at Kirtland, and rake  some measures for the relief or restoration of the people thus  plundered and driven from their homes. The question was put to the  Conference: \"Who would volunteer to perform so great a journey?\"    The poverty of all, and the inclement season of the year made  all hesitate. At length Lyman Wight and myself offered our  services, which were readily accepted. I was at this time entirely  destitute of proper clothing for the journey; and I had neither  horse, saddle, bridle, money nor provisions to take with me; or to  leave with my wife, who lay sick and helpless most of the time.    Under these circumstances I knew not what to do. Nearly all had  been robbed and plundered, and all were poor. As we had to start  without delay, I almost trembled at the undertaking; it seemed to  be all but an impossibility; but \"to him that believeth all things  are possible.\" I started out of my house to do something towards  making preparation; I hardly knew which way to go, but I found  myself in the house of brother John Lowry, and was intending to ask  him for money; but as I entered his miserable cottage in the swamp,  amid the low, timbered bottoms of the Missouri river, I found him  sick in bed with a heavy fever, and two or three others of his  family down with the same complaint, on different beds in the same  room. He was vomiting severely, and was hardly sensible of my  presence. I thought to myself, \"well, this is a poor place to come  for money, and yet I must have it; I know of no one else that has  got it; what shall I do?\" I sat a little while confounded and  amazed. At length another Elder happened in; at that instant faith  sprung up in my heart; the Spirit whispered to me, \"is there  anything too hard for the Lord?\" I said to the Elder that came in:  \"Brother, I am glad you have come; these people must be healed, for  I want some money of them, and must have it.\"    We laid hands on them and rebuked the disease; brother Lowry  rose up well; I did my errand, and readily obtained all I asked.  This provided in part for my family's sustenance while I should  leave them. I went a little further into the woods of the Missouri  bottoms, and came to a camp of some brethren, by the name of  Higbee, who owned some horses; they saw me coming, and, moved by  the Spirit, one of them said to the other, \"there comes brother  Parley; he's in want of a horse for his journey--I must let him  have old Dick;\" this being the name of the best horse he had.  \"Yes,\" said I, \"brother, you have guessed right; but what will I do  for a saddle?\" \"Well,\" says the other, \"I believe I'll have to let  you have mine.\" I blessed them and went on my way rejoicing.    I next called on Sidney A. Gilbert, a merchant, then sojourning  in the village of Liberty--his store in Jackson County having been  broken up, and his goods plundered and destroyed by the mob.  \"Well,\" says he, \"brother Parley, you certainly look too shabby to  start a journey; you must have a new suit; I have got some remnants  left that will make you a coat,\" etc. A neighboring tailoress and  two or three other sisters happened to be present on a visit, and  hearing the conversation, exclaimed, \"Yes, brother Gilbert, you  find the stuff and we'll make it up for him.\" This arranged, I now  lacked only a cloak; this was also furnished by brother Gilbert.    Brother Wight was also prospered in a similar manner in his  preparations. Thus faith and the blessings of God had cleared up  our way to accomplish what seemed impossible. We were soon ready,  and on the first of February we mounted our horses, and started in  good cheer to ride one thousand or fifteen hundred miles through"]]]
