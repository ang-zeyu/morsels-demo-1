Had there not been those  within the cruel city of Kadabra who needed succor far worse than  the poor unfortunate dead and dying out there in the cold upon the  bent and broken carcasses of a thousand fliers I could not have  restrained my desire to hasten back and do battle with those horrid  creatures that had been despatched to rend and devour them.    As it was I could but follow the yellow warriors, with bowed head,  and give thanks for the chance that had given Thuvan Dihn and me  such easy ingress to the capital of Salensus Oll.    Once within the gates, we had no difficulty in eluding our friends  of the morning, and presently found ourselves in a Martian hostelry.          IN DURANCE      The public houses of Barsoom, I have found, vary but little.  There  is no privacy for other than married couples.    Men without their wives are escorted to a large chamber, the floor  of which is usually of white marble or heavy glass, kept scrupulously  clean.  Here are many small, raised platforms for the guest's sleeping  silks and furs, and if he have none of his own clean, fresh ones  are furnished at a nominal charge.    Once a man's belongings have been deposited upon one of these  platforms he is a guest of the house, and that platform his own  until he leaves.  No one will disturb or molest his belongings, as  there are no thieves upon Mars.    As assassination is the one thing to be feared, the proprietors  of the hostelries furnish armed guards, who pace back and forth  through the sleeping-rooms day and night.  The number of guards and  gorgeousness of their trappings quite usually denote the status of  the hotel.    No meals are served in these houses, but generally a public eating  place adjoins them.  Baths are connected with the sleeping chambers,  and each guest is required to bathe daily or depart from the hotel.    Usually on a second or third floor there is a large sleeping-room  for single women guests, but its appointments do not vary materially  from the chamber occupied by men.  The guards who watch the women  remain in the corridor outside the sleeping chamber, while female  slaves pace back and forth among the sleepers within, ready to  notify the warriors should their presence be required.    I was surprised to note that all the guards with the hotel at which  we stopped were red men, and on inquiring of one of them I learned  that they were slaves purchased by the proprietors of the hotels from  the government.  The man whose post was past my sleeping platform  had been commander of the navy of a great Martian nation; but fate  had carried his flagship across the ice-barrier within the radius  of power of the magnetic shaft, and now for many tedious years he  had been a slave of the yellow men.    He told me that princes, jeds, and even jeddaks of the outer  world, were among the menials who served the yellow race; but when  I asked him if he had heard of the fate of Mors Kajak or Tardos Mors  he shook his head, saying that he never had heard of their being  prisoners here, though he was very familiar with the reputations  and fame they bore in the outer world.    Neither had he heard any rumor of the coming of the Father of Therns  and the black dator of the First Born, but he hastened to explain  that he knew little of what took place within the palace.  I could  see that he wondered not a little that a yellow man should be so  inquisitive about certain red prisoners from beyond the ice-barrier,  and that I should be so ignorant of customs and conditions among  my own race.    In fact, I had forgotten my disguise upon discovering a red man  pacing before my sleeping platform; but his growing expression of  surprise warned me in time, for I had no mind to reveal my identity  to any unless some good could come of it, and I did not see how  this poor fellow could serve me yet, though I had it in my mind  that later I might be the means of serving him and all the other  thousands of prisoners who do the bidding of their stern masters  in Kadabra.    Thuvan Dihn and I discussed our plans as we sat together among our  sleeping silks and furs that night in the midst of the hundreds  of yellow men who occupied the apartment with us.  We spoke in low  whispers, but, as that is only what courtesy demands in a public  sleeping place, we roused no suspicion.    At last, determining that all must be but idle speculation until  after we had had a chance to explore the city and attempt to put  into execution the plan Talu had suggested, we bade each other good  night and turned to sleep.    After breakfasting the following morning we set out to see Kadabra,  and as, through the generosity of the prince of Marentina, we were  well supplied with the funds current in Okar we purchased a handsome  ground flier.  Having learned to drive them while in Marentina, we  spent a delightful and profitable day exploring the city, and late  in the afternoon at the hour Talu told us we would find government  officials in their offices, we stopped before a magnificent building  on the plaza opposite the royal grounds and the palace.    Here we walked boldly in past the armed guard at the door, to be  met by a red slave within who asked our wishes.    \"Tell Sorav, your master, that two warriors from Illall wish to  take service in the palace guard,\" I said.    Sorav, Talu had told us, was the commander of the forces of the  palace, and as men from the further cities of Okar--and especially  Illall--were less likely to be tainted with the germ of intrigue  which had for years infected the household of Salensus Oll, he was  sure that we would be welcomed and few questions asked us.    He had primed us with such general information as he thought would  be necessary for us to pass muster before Sorav, after which we would  have to undergo a further examination before Salensus Oll that he  might determine our physical fitness and our ability as warriors.    The little experience we had had with the strange hooked sword of  the yellow man and his cuplike shield made it seem rather unlikely  that either of us could pass this final test, but there was the  chance that we might be quartered in the palace of Salensus Oll  for several days after being accepted by Sorav before the Jeddak  of Jeddaks would find time to put us to the final test.    After a wait of several minutes in an ante-chamber we were summoned  into the private office of Sorav, where we were courteously greeted  by this ferocious-appearing, black-bearded officer.  He asked us  our names and stations in our own city, and having received replies  that were evidently satisfactory to him, he put certain questions  to us that Talu had foreseen and prepared us for.    The interview could not have lasted over ten minutes when Sorav  summoned an aid whom he instructed to record us properly, and then  escort us to the quarters in the palace which are set aside for  aspirants to membership in the palace guard.    The aid took us to his own office first, where he measured and  weighed and photographed us simultaneously with a machine ingeniously  devised for that purpose, five copies being instantly reproduced in  five different offices of the government, two of which are located  in other cities miles distant.  Then he led us through the palace  grounds to the main guardroom of the palace, there turning us over  to the officer in charge.    This individual again questioned us briefly, and finally despatched  a soldier to guide us to our quarters.  These we found located upon  the second floor of the palace in a semi-detached tower at the rear  of the edifice.    When we asked our guide why we were quartered so far from the  guardroom he replied that the custom of the older members of the  guard of picking quarrels with aspirants to try their metal had  resulted in so many deaths that it was found difficult to maintain  the guard at its full strength while this custom prevailed.  Salensus  Oll had, therefore, set apart these quarters for aspirants, and here  they were securely locked against the danger of attack by members  of the guard.    This unwelcome information put a sudden check to all our well-laid  plans, for it meant that we should virtually be prisoners in the  palace of Salensus Oll until the time that he should see fit to  give us the final examination for efficiency.    As it was this interval upon which we had banked to accomplish  so much in our search for Dejah Thoris and Thuvia of Ptarth, our  chagrin was unbounded when we heard the great lock click behind our  guide as he had quitted us after ushering us into the chambers we  were to occupy.    With a wry face I turned to Thuvan Dihn.  My companion but shook  his head disconsolately and walked to one of the windows upon the  far side of the apartment.    Scarcely had he gazed beyond them than he called to me in a tone  of suppressed excitement and surprise.  In an instant I was by his  side.    \"Look!\" said Thuvan Dihn, pointing toward the courtyard below.    As my eyes followed the direction indicated I saw two women pacing  back and forth in an enclosed garden.    At the same moment I recognized them--they were Dejah Thoris and  Thuvia of Ptarth!    There were they whom I had trailed from one pole to another, the  length of a world.  Only ten feet of space and a few metal bars  separated me from them.    With a cry I attracted their attention, and as Dejah Thoris looked  up full into my eyes I made the sign of love that the men of Barsoom  make to their women.    To my astonishment and horror her head went high, and as a look  of utter contempt touched her finely chiseled features she turned  her back full upon me.

We do not know whether  Lincoln gained any votes that day, but he gained what was far more  valuable, the active friendship of these able and honorable men, all  Whigs and all Kentuckians like himself.    The acquaintances he made in his canvass, the practice he gained in  speaking, and the added confidence which this experience of measuring  his abilities with those of others gave, were all the advantages which  Lincoln derived from this attempt. He was defeated, for the only time  in his life, in a contest before the people. The fortunate candidates  were E. D. Taylor, J. T. Stuart, Achilles Morris, and Peter  Cartwright, the first of whom received 1127 votes and the last 815.  Lincoln's position among the eight defeated candidates was a very  respectable one. He had 657 votes, and there were five who fared  worse, among them his old adversary Kirkpatrick. What must have been  especially gratifying to him was the fact that he received the almost  unanimous vote of his own neighborhood, the precinct of New Salem, 277  votes against 3, a result which showed more strongly than any words  could do the extent of the attachment and the confidence which his  genial and upright character had inspired among those who knew him  best.    Having been, even in so slight a degree, a soldier and a politician,  he was unfitted for a day laborer; but being entirely without means of  subsistence, he was forced to look about for some suitable occupation.  We know he thought seriously at this time of learning the trade of a  blacksmith, and using in that honest way the sinew and brawn which  nature had given him. But an opening for another kind of business  occurred, which prevented his entering upon any merely mechanical  occupation. Two of his most intimate friends were the brothers  Herndon, called, according to the fashion of the time, which held it  unfriendly to give a man his proper name, and arrogant for him to  claim it, \"Row\" and \"Jim.\" They kept one of those grocery stores in  which everything salable on the frontier was sold, and which seem to  have changed their occupants as rapidly as sentry-boxes. \"Jim\" sold  his share to an idle and dissolute man named Berry, and \"Row\" soon  transferred his interest to Lincoln. It was easy enough to buy, as  nothing was ever given in payment but a promissory note. A short time  afterwards, one Reuben Radford, who kept another shop of the same  kind, happened one evening to attract the dangerous attention of the  Clary's Grove boys, who, with their usual prompt and practical  facetiousness, without a touch of malice in it, broke his windows and  wrecked his store. The next morning, while Radford was ruefully  contemplating the ruin, and doubtless concluding that he had had  enough of a country where the local idea of neighborly humor found  such eccentric expression, he hailed a passer-by named Greene, and  challenged him to buy his establishment for four hundred dollars. This  sort of trade was always irresistible to these Western speculators,  and Greene at once gave his note for the amount. It next occurred to  him to try to find out what the property was worth, and doubting his  own skill, he engaged Lincoln to make an invoice of it. The young  merchant, whose appetite for speculation had just been whetted by his  own investment, undertook the task, and, finding the stock of goods  rather tempting, offered Greene $250 for his bargain, which was at  once accepted. Not a cent of money changed hands in all these  transactions. By virtue of half a dozen signatures, Berry and Lincoln  became proprietors of the only mercantile establishment in the  village, and the apparent wealth of the community was increased by a  liberal distribution of their notes among the Herndons, Radford,  Greene, and a Mr. Rutledge, whose business they had also bought.    Fortunately for Lincoln and for the world, the enterprise was not  successful. It was entered into without sufficient reflection, and  from the very nature of things was destined to fail. To Berry the  business was merely the refuge of idleness. He spent his time in  gossip and drank up his share of the profits, and it is probable that  Lincoln was far more interested in politics and general reading than  in the petty traffic of his shop. In the spring of the next year,  finding that their merchandise was gaining them little or nothing,  they concluded to keep a tavern in addition to their other business,  and the records of the County Court of Sangamon County show that Berry  took out a license for that purpose on the 6th of March, 1833.  [Transcriber's Note: Lengthy footnote (1) relocated to chapter end.]  But it was even then too late for any expedients to save the moribund  partnership. The tavern was never opened, for about this time Lincoln  and Berry were challenged to sell out to a pair of vagrant brothers  named Trent, who, as they had no idea of paying, were willing to give  their notes to any amount. They soon ran away, and Berry expired,  extinguished in rum. Lincoln was thus left loaded with debts, and with  no assets except worthless notes of Berry and the Trents. It is  greatly to his credit that he never thought of doing by others as  others had done by him. The morality of the frontier was deplorably  loose in such matters, and most of these people would have concluded  that the failure of the business expunged its liabilities. But Lincoln  made no effort even to compromise the claims against him. He promised  to pay when he could, and it took the labor of years to do it; but he  paid at last every farthing of the debt, which seemed to him and his  friends so large that it was called among them \"the national debt.\"    [Illustration:   JUDGE STEPHEN T. LOGAN.]    He had already begun to read elementary books of law, borrowed from  Major Stuart and other kindly acquaintances. Indeed, it is quite  possible that Berry and Lincoln might have succeeded better in  business if the junior member of the firm had not spent so much of his  time reading Blackstone and Chitty in the shade of a great oak just  outside the door, while the senior quietly fuddled himself within.  Eye-witnesses still speak of the grotesque youth, habited in homespun  tow, lying on his back with his feet on the trunk of the tree, and  poring over his book by the hour, \"grinding around with the shade,\" as  it shifted from north to east. After his store, to use his own  expression, had \"winked out,\" he applied himself with more continuous  energy to his reading, doing merely what odd jobs came to his hand to  pay his current expenses, which were of course very slight. He  sometimes helped his friend Ellis in his store; sometimes went into  the field and renewed his exploits as a farm-hand, which had gained  him a traditional fame in Indiana; sometimes employed his clerkly hand  in straightening up a neglected ledger. It is probable that he worked  for his board oftener than for any other compensation, and his hearty  friendliness and vivacity, as well as his industry in the field, made  him a welcome guest in any farmhouse in the county. His strong arm was  always at the disposal of the poor and needy; it is said of him, with  a graphic variation of a well-known text, \"that he visited the  fatherless and the widow and chopped their wood.\"    In the spring of this year, 1833, he was appointed Postmaster of New  Salem, and held the office for three years. Its emoluments were  slender and its duties light, but there was in all probability no  citizen of the village who could have made so much of it as he. The  mails were so scanty that he was said to carry them in his hat, and he  is also reported to have read every newspaper that arrived; it is  altogether likely that this formed the leading inducement to his  taking the office. His incumbency lasted until New Salem ceased to be  populous enough for a post-station and the mail went by to Petersburg.  Dr. J. G. Holland relates a sequel to this official experience which  illustrates the quaint honesty of the man. Several years later, when  he was a practicing lawyer, an agent of the Post-office Department  called upon him, and asked for a balance due from the New Salem  office, some seventeen dollars. Lincoln rose, and opening a little  trunk which lay in a corner of the room, took from it a cotton rag in  which was tied up the exact sum required. \"I never use any man's money  but my own,\" he quietly remarked. When we consider the pinching  poverty in which these years had been passed, we may appreciate the  self-denial denial which had kept him from making even a temporary use  of this little sum of government money.    [Illustration:   A. LINCOLN'S SURVEYING INSTRUMENTS AND SADDLE-BAG. IN  THE POSSESSION OF THE LINCOLN MONUMENT COLLECTION.]    John Calhoun, the Surveyor of Sangamon County, was at this time  overburdened with work. The principal local industry was speculation  in land. Every settler of course wanted his farm surveyed and marked  out for him, and every community had its syndicate of leading citizens  who cherished a scheme of laying out a city somewhere. In many cases  the city was plotted, the sites of the principal buildings, including  a courthouse and a university, were determined, and a sonorous name  was selected out of Plutarch, before its location was even considered.  For this latter office the intervention of an official surveyor was  necessary, and therefore Mr. Calhoun had more business than he could  attend to without assistance. Looking about for a young man of good  character, intelligent enough to learn surveying at short notice, his  attention was soon attracted to Lincoln.
