On the 13th his force was again  on the move in the direction of Bothaville, in order to frustrate some  parties of Boers who were seeking to evade the troops then operating  near Klerksdorp, and to return to the Orange Colony. It was not long  before the advance column under Colonel Pilcher came in touch with  them. At a place called Allettasdraai, on the Valsch River, they were  discovered, dealt with smartly and decisively, and driven south-west  towards Zandspruit before Colonel Thorneycroft and his nimble band.  After this period General Knox concentrated his force, and marched  back to the railway with a view to acting in co-operation with General  Bruce-Hamilton's enveloping movement before described. During this  movement Colonel Pilcher was continually engaged with either  Commandants Jacob or Erasmus, emerging from the various frays with  waggons, stock, and prisoners.    Colonel Henry, who moved his force from Jacobsdal to Christiana at the  conclusion of General Bruce-Hamilton's operations, was now placed  under General Knox's orders. Together with the Kimberley column he  operated in the region between Bloemhof and Hoopstad, with the result  that between the 2nd and 7th of July 52 prisoners, 50 horses, 64  vehicles, and over 7000 cattle were captured, 2 Boers were killed, and  55 surrendered.    Colonel Pilcher from Boshof moved to Bultfontein on the 18th of June,  Colonel Thorneycroft taking simultaneously the same direction. During  the advance Colonel Pilcher came in for hot work. On the 19th, while  watering his cattle, he was attacked by 400 Boers, who, under cover of  the smoke of a veldt fire, attacked the rearguard. These retired in  good order, firing by sections. They were then relieved by the Mounted  Infantry, who sent the guerillas flying, leaving seven of their number  behind. The next day from a small kopje the fugitives became  aggressive, and were charged by a detachment of Yeomen, who routed  them, but on the morrow they were again found in some strength near  Badenhorst Farm. The East Yorkshire Mounted Infantry, therefore,  charged their position and dispersed them.    While Colonel Thorneycroft escorted prisoners and stock to Brandfort,  Colonel Pilcher moved on in the direction of Hoopstad. Colonel  Thorneycroft then searched the bed of the Vet River (west of  Smaldeel), unearthing waggons and cattle which were hidden there.  Towards the end of June the columns of both Pilcher and Thorneycroft  were concentrated at Brandfort in order to recuperate before fresh  undertakings in the easterly direction, which began on the 1st of  July.          CHAPTER VIII    LORD METHUEN, TRANSVAAL (SOUTH-WEST)      The Boers (who had been concentrating for a month at  Hartebeestefontein), before the enveloping columns of Lord Methuen and  General Mildmay Willson, now left their strong positions and scattered  to the west. On the 8th of May some were brought to a stand at  Leeuwfontein by General Babington with his smart New Zealanders,  Bushmen, and Imperial Light Horse, while others were driven into  General Dixon's net at Putfontein. Thus many captures were effected.  Besides the fight of the 8th there was another near Korannafontein on  the 10th with a detachment of Colonel Williams' force.    Lord Methuen and Sir Henry Rawlinson, after chasing the enemy in the  west, moved to Mafeking and Maribogo respectively. General Babington  and Colonel Williams by a southerly route returned to Klerksdorp, and  General Dixon on the 25th took up his old position at Naauwpoort  (south of the Magaliesberg). Seventy prisoners, twenty-six surrenders,  102 vehicles, and much stock were the results of these combined  operations.    Attention next turned to Wolmaranstad, where Delarey was reported to  be, and which place was now called by the Boers their capital.  Rawlinson from the west, and Williams, accompanied by General  Fetherstonhaugh (who had relieved General Babington) marched thither  from Klerksdorp, while Lord Methuen guarded the exits towards the  north. Colonel Rawlinson entered Wolmaranstad without opposition,  joined hands with General Fetherstonhaugh, and proceeded towards  Klerksdorp, after having marched (since the 6th of May) 387 miles. By  way of interlude he captured a small laager near Cyferkuil, thus  making his haul consist of 17 prisoners, 3000 head of cattle, 29,000  sheep, and 400 horses. Forty Boers and many families were also brought  in. At the same time Lord Methuen, working from Korannafontein, chased  a roving commando which was trekking towards Lichtenburg. The fruit of  the united activity represented 56 prisoners, 40 horses, and over 100  vehicles, besides stock in abundance. An animated fight took place on  the 23rd, over a convoy moving from Potchefstroom to Ventersdorp. The  Potchefstroom convoy got as far as Witpoortje, where it was met by the  Ventersdorp section. This section was about to leave Witpoortje on its  way to Ventersdorp when it was attacked by 300 Boers, who fought the  fight of the famished. Instantly the Potchefstroom section returned to  the rescue, and reinforced the Ventersdorp force with fifty men of the  Welsh Fusiliers and twenty of the Imperial Light Horse. The Boers  driven off, the convoy then proceeded, but again at Rietfontein Drift  the guerillas, some 400 of them under Liebenberg, made a desperate  rush upon the coveted supplies, three waggons of which had broken down  in the scrimmage.    The escort were hard pressed--losing four men killed and two officers  and thirty-one men wounded--but their endurance and gallantry stood  every test. The garrison of Ventersdorp sent out fifty men to clear the  front of the convoy, and finally brought it back in safety. At one time  it seemed as though the convoy was lost, but it was recaptured by dint  of hard fighting. Captain Purchas (2nd Battalion South Wales Borderers)  especially distinguished himself, Captain Hay (Royal Welsh Fusiliers)  was wounded, and Lieutenant Wells (Loyal North Lancashire Regiment),  Lieutenant Bankes (Imperial Yeomanry), and Second-Lieutenant Smith (78th  Battery R.F.A.), who were in the thick of the fray, had narrow escapes,  owing to the prodigious energy with which they tackled the marauders.    The work of clearing the right bank of the Vaal towards Klerksdorp was  next undertaken by General Fetherstonhaugh and Colonel Williams. A  successful action on the 24th against Van Rensburg's banditti enabled  the force to march into Klerksdorp with twenty-four prisoners, 6200  rounds of ammunition, and thirty ox waggons. Thirty-five Burghers  surrendered in course of the march.    General Dixon, veering west from Naauwpoort, made a search for guns  and ammunition, which had been buried in the neighbourhood. From his  camp at Vlakfontein[3] he moved on the 29th of May to Waterval, where,  on a farm, he found the spot where the guns had been buried. The  weapons themselves had been removed. Near here ammunition was found,  but it was too late in the day to attempt to unearth it. The enemy was  hovering all round the region, and it was deemed advisable to return  to camp before making a lunge at them. The camp in the absence of  General Dixon was well guarded, and in a good defensible position, and  there was no reason to believe that the hovering Boers could quickly  mass in any large number.    [Illustration: THE ENGAGEMENT AT VLAKFONTEIN: THE DERBYSHIRES  RE-TAKING THE GUNS AT THE POINT OF THE BAYONET    Drawing by R. Caton Woodville]    As the centre (with which was General Dixon) was crossing the valley  towards camp, the firing which had all day been going forward in the  direction of the rearguard[4] became louder and louder. Then  suddenly the hilly ground on which was the rearguard became apparently  enveloped in fire, the veldt blazing and smoking, and seeming to  impose a flaming curtain between one portion of the force and the  other. The rolls of artillery now increased, and presently a messenger  from Major Chance reported that he was hard pressed. The Boers, under  cover of the smoke, had come up in great numbers, rushed upon and  surrounded the guns, killing the gun teams and--after a desperate  struggle--most of the section in charge. According to the  much-contested statement of Reuter's Correspondent: \"A lieutenant and  a sergeant-major were made prisoners, and on their refusing to give  information as to the working of the guns they were shot. Their  gallant conduct undoubtedly saved many lives, for the enemy actually  turned the guns on our troops, but the shells failed to explode, as  the pins had not been withdrawn.\" This statement could not be  corroborated, as those concerned were dead, but support for it is  found in the assertion of a private, who stated: \"They asked the  officer in charge to surrender, but he replied, 'A British soldier  does not know the meaning of surrender, and if you want guns you will  need to shoot me and my gunners!' Thereupon the enemy shot the officer  and gunners, and captured the two guns, and then turned them on us.\"  At this juncture General Dixon, who had sent off Colonel Duff and his  troops to the succour of Major Chance, and himself had been galloping  across the valley to the scene of action, came to the rescue. On  arrival at the west picket of the camp, he found the situation was  critical in the extreme. The two guns and howitzer which had been with  him were in action west of the picket, and these, together with the  company of the Derbys which had been on picket and the details left in  camp, were hotly engaged. Some of the enemy were within 800 yards of  the picket, while others at 1600 yards range were shelling the British  camp and guns. It now became evident that the guns of the rearguard  were captured! Colonel Duff, advancing with two guns (8th Battery),  200 Scottish Horse, and two companies of the King's Own Borderers with  a Maxim, now hastened across"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4715"],[0,"An African Millionaire: Episodes in the Life of the Illustrious Colonel Clay (#20)"],[1,"righted themselves of  a sudden. While we were wondering what it meant, Charles received a  telegram from Sir Adolphus Cordery:--    \"The man is a fraud. Not Schleiermacher at all. Just had a wire  from Jena saying the Professor knows nothing about him. Sorry  unintentionally to have caused you trouble. Come round and see me.\"    \"Sorry unintentionally to have caused you trouble.\" Charles was  beside himself with anger. Sir Adolphus had upset the share-market  for forty-eight mortal hours, half-ruined a round dozen of wealthy  operators, convulsed the City, upheaved the House, and now--he  apologised for it as one might apologise for being late ten minutes  for dinner! Charles jumped into a hansom and rushed round to see  him. How had he dared to introduce the impostor to solid men as  Professor Schleiermacher? Sir Adolphus shrugged his shoulders. The  fellow had come and introduced himself as the great Jena chemist;  he had long white hair, and a stoop in the shoulders. What reason  had _he_ for doubting his word? (I reflected to myself that on much  the same grounds Charles in turn had accepted the Honourable David  Granton and Graf von Lebenstein.) Besides, what object could the  creature have for this extraordinary deception? Charles knew only  too well. It was clear it was done to disturb the diamond market,  and we realised, too late, that the man who had done it was--Colonel  Clay, in \"another of his manifold allotropic embodiments!\" Charles  had had his wish, and had met his enemy once more in London!    We could see the whole plot. Colonel Clay was polymorphic, like the  element carbon! Doubtless, with his extraordinary sleight of hand,  he had substituted real diamonds for the shapeless mass that came  out of the apparatus, in the interval between handing the pebbles  round for inspection, and distributing them piecemeal to the men of  science and representatives of the diamond interest. We all watched  him closely, of course, when he opened the crucibles; but when once  we had satisfied ourselves that _something_ came out, our doubts were  set at rest, and we forgot to watch whether he distributed those  somethings or not to the recipients. Conjurers always depend upon  such momentary distractions or lapses of attention. As usual, too,  the Professor had disappeared into space the moment his trick was  once well performed. He vanished like smoke, as the Count and Seer  had vanished before, and was never again heard of.    Charles went home more angry than I have ever beheld him. I couldn't  imagine why. He seemed as deeply hipped as if he had lost his  thousands. I endeavoured to console him. \"After all,\" I said,  \"though Golcondas have suffered a temporary loss, it's a comfort  to think that you should have stood so firm, and not only stemmed  the tide, but also prevented yourself from losing anything at all  of your own through panic. I'm sorry, of course, for the widows  and orphans; but if Colonel Clay has rigged the market, at least  it isn't YOU who lose by it this time.\"    Charles withered me with a fierce scowl of undisguised contempt.  \"Wentworth,\" he said once more, \"you are a fool!\" Then he relapsed  into silence.    \"But you declined to sell out,\" I said.    He gazed at me fixedly. \"Is it likely,\" he asked at last, \"I would  tell _you_ if I meant to sell out? or that I'd sell out openly through  Finglemore, my usual broker? Why, all the world would have known,  and Golcondas would have been finished. As it is, I don't desire to  tell an ass like you exactly how much I've lost. But I _did_ sell out,  and some unknown operator bought in at once, and closed for ready  money, and has sold again this morning; and after all that has  happened, it will be impossible to track him. He didn't wait for the  account: he settled up instantly. And he sold in like manner. I know  now what has been done, and how cleverly it has all been disguised  and covered; but the most I'm going to tell you to-day is just  this--it's by far the biggest haul Colonel Clay has made out of me.  He could retire on it if he liked. My one hope is, it may satisfy  him for life; but, then, no man has ever had enough of making money.\"    \"_You_ sold out!\" I exclaimed. \"_You_, the Chairman of the company!  _You_ deserted the ship! And how about your trust? How about the widows  and orphans confided to you?\"    Charles rose and faced me. \"Seymour Wentworth,\" he said, in his most  solemn voice, \"you have lived with me for years and had every  advantage. You have seen high finance. Yet you ask me that question!  It's my belief you will never, never understand business!\"          VII    THE EPISODE OF THE ARREST OF THE COLONEL      How much precisely Charles dropped over the slump in Cloetedorps  I never quite knew. But the incident left him dejected, limp, and  dispirited.    \"Hang it all, Sey,\" he said to me in the smoking-room, a few  evenings later. \"This Colonel Clay is enough to vex the patience of  Job--and Job had large losses, too, if I recollect aright, from the  Chaldeans and other big operators of the period.\"    \"Three thousand camels,\" I murmured, recalling my dear mother's  lessons; \"all at one fell swoop; not to mention five hundred yoke of  oxen, carried off by the Sabeans, then a leading firm of speculative  cattle-dealers!\"    \"Ah, well,\" Charles meditated aloud, shaking the ash from his  cheroot into a Japanese tray--fine antique bronze-work. \"There were  big transactions in live-stock even then! Still, Job or no Job, the  man is too much for me.\"    \"The difficulty is,\" I assented, \"you never know where to have him.\"    \"Yes,\" Charles mused; \"if he were always the same, like Horniman's  tea or a good brand of whisky, it would be easier, of course; you'd  stand some chance of spotting him. But when a man turns up smiling  every time in a different disguise, which fits him like a skin, and  always apparently with the best credentials, why, hang it all, Sey,  there's no wrestling with him anyhow.\"    \"Who could have come to us, for example, better vouched,\" I  acquiesced, \"than the Honourable David?\"    \"Exactly so,\" Charles murmured. \"I invited him myself, for my own  advantage. And he arrived with all the prestige of the Glen-Ellachie  connection.\"    \"Or the Professor?\" I went on. \"Introduced to us by the leading  mineralogist of England.\"    I had touched a sore point. Charles winced and remained silent.    \"Then, women again,\" he resumed, after a painful pause. \"I must meet  in society many charming women. I can't everywhere and always be on  my guard against every dear soul of them. Yet the moment I relax  my attention for one day--or even when I don't relax it--I am  bamboozled and led a dance by that arch Mme. Picardet, or that  transparently simple little minx, Mrs. Granton. She's the cleverest  girl I ever met in my life, that hussy, whatever we're to call her.  She's a different person each time; and each time, hang it all, I  lose my heart afresh to that different person.\"    I glanced round to make sure Amelia was well out of earshot.    \"No, Sey,\" my respected connection went on, after another long  pause, sipping his coffee pensively, \"I feel I must be aided in this  superhuman task by a professional unraveller of cunning disguises. I  shall go to Marvillier's to-morrow--fortunate man, Marvillier--and  ask him to supply me with a really good 'tec, who will stop in the  house and keep an eye upon every living soul that comes near me.  He shall scan each nose, each eye, each wig, each whisker. He shall  be my watchful half, my unsleeping self; it shall be his business  to suspect all living men, all breathing women. The Archbishop of  Canterbury shall not escape for a moment his watchful regard; he  will take care that royal princesses don't collar the spoons or walk  off with the jewel-cases. He must see possible Colonel Clays in the  guard of every train and the parson of every parish; he must detect  the off-chance of a Mme. Picardet in every young girl that takes tea  with Amelia, every fat old lady that comes to call upon Isabel. Yes,  I have made my mind up. I shall go to-morrow and secure such a man  at once at Marvillier's.\"    \"If you please, Sir Charles,\" Cesarine interposed, pushing her head  through the portiere, \"her ladyship says, will you and Mr. Wentworth  remember that she goes out with you both this evening to Lady  Carisbrooke's?\"    \"Bless my soul,\" Charles cried, \"so she does! And it's now past ten!  The carriage will be at the door for us in another five minutes!\"    Next morning, accordingly, Charles drove round to Marvillier's. The  famous detective listened to his story with glistening eyes; then he  rubbed his hands and purred. \"Colonel Clay!\" he said; \"Colonel Clay!  That's a very tough customer! The police of Europe are on the  look-out for Colonel Clay. He is wanted in London, in Paris, in  Berlin. It is le Colonel Caoutchouc here, le Colonel Caoutchouc  there; till one begins to ask, at last, IS there _any_ Colonel  Caoutchouc, or is it a convenient class name invented by the Force  to cover a gang of undiscovered sharpers? However, Sir Charles, we  will do our best. I will set on the track without delay the best and  cleverest detective in England.\"    \"The very man I want,\" Charles said. \"What name, Marvillier?\"    The principal smiled. \"Whatever name you like,\" he said. \"He isn't  particular. Medhurst he's called at home. _We_ call him Joe. I'll  send him round to your house this afternoon for certain.\"    \"Oh no,\" Charles said promptly, \"you won't; or Colonel Clay himself  will come instead of him. I've been sold too often. No casual  strangers! I'll wait here and see him.\"    \"But he isn't in,\" Marvillier objected.    Charles was firm as a rock. \"Then send and fetch him.\"    In half an hour, sure enough, the detective arrived. He was an  odd-looking small man, with hair cut short and standing straight up  all over his head, like a Parisian waiter. He had quick, "]]]
