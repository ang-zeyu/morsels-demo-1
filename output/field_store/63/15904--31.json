[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5311"],[0,"Parnassus on Wheels (#20)"],[1,"the place.\"    For the life of me, I couldn't utter the tenderness in my heart with  that gorilla of a jailer standing behind us.    Somehow we made our way downstairs, after the Professor had gathered  together the sheets of his manuscript. It had already reached  formidable proportions, as he had written fifty pages in the  thirty-six hours he had been in prison. In the office we had to sign  some papers. The sheriff was very apologetic to Mifflin, and offered  to take him back to town in his car, but I explained that Parnassus  was waiting at the gate. The Professor's eyes brightened when he  heard that, but I had to hurry him away from an argument about  putting good books in prisons. The sheriff walked with us to the  gate and there shook hands again.    Peg whickered as we came up to her, and the Professor patted her  soft nose. Bock tugged at his chain in a frenzy of joy. At last we  were alone.        CHAPTER FIFTEEN      I never knew just how it happened. Instead of driving back through  Port Vigor, we turned into a side road leading up over the hill and  across the heath where the air came fresh and sweet from the sea.  The Professor sat very silent, looking about him. There was a grove  of birches on the hill, and the sunlight played upon their satin  boles.    \"It feels good to be out again,\" he said calmly. \"The Sage cannot  be so keen a lover of open air as his books would indicate, or he  wouldn't be so ready to clap a man into quod. Perhaps I owe him  another punch on the nose for that.\"    \"Oh, Roger,\" I said--and I'm afraid my voice was trembly--\"I'm  _sorry_. I'm _sorry_.\"    Not very eloquent, was it? And then, somehow or other, his arm was  around me.    \"Helen,\" he said. \"Will you marry me? I'm not rich, but I've saved  up enough to live on. We'll always have Parnassus, and this winter  we'll go and live in Brooklyn and write the book. And we'll travel  around with Peg, and preach the love of books and the love of human  beings. Helen--you're just what I need, God bless you. Will you come  with me and make me the happiest bookseller in the world?\"    Peg must have been astonished at the length of time she had for  cropping the grass, undisturbed. I know that Roger and I sat  careless of time. And when he told me that ever since our first  afternoon together he had determined to have me, sooner or later,  I was the proudest woman in New England. I told Roger about the  ghastly wreck, and my agony of apprehension. I think it was the  wreck that made us both feel inclined to forgive Andrew.    We had a light luncheon together there on the dunes above the Sound.  By taking a short cut over the ridge we struck into the Shelby road  without going down into Port Vigor again. Peg pulled us along toward  Greenbriar, and we talked as we went.    Perhaps the best of it was that a cold drizzle of rain began to fall  as we moved along the hill road. The Professor--as I still call him,  by force of habit--curtained in the front of the van with a rubber  sheet. Bock hopped up and curled himself aginst his master's leg.  Roger got out his corncob pipe, and I sat close to him. In the  gathering gloom we plodded along, as happy a trio--or quartet, if  you include fat, cheery old Peg--as any on this planet. Summer was  over, and we were no longer young, but there were great things  before us. I listened to the drip of the rain, and the steady creak  of Parnassus on her axles. I thought of my \"anthology\" of loaves of  bread and vowed to bake a million more if Roger wanted me to. It was  after supper time when we got to Greenbriar. Roger had suggested  that we take a shorter road that would have brought us through to  Redfield sooner, but I begged him to go by way of Shelby and  Greenbriar, just as we had come before. I did not tell him why I  wanted this. And when finally we came to a halt in front of Kirby's  store at the crossroads it was raining heavily and we were ready for  a rest.    \"Well, sweetheart,\" said Roger, \"shall we go and see what sort of  rooms the hotel has?\"    \"I can think of something better than that,\" said I. \"Let's go up to  Mr. Kane and have him marry us. Then we can get back to Sabine Farm  afterward, and give Andrew a surprise.\"    \"By the bones of Hymen!\" said Roger. \"You're right!\"    It must have been ten o'clock when we turned in at the red gate  of Sabine Farm. The rain had stopped, but the wheels sloshed  through mud and water at every turn. The light was burning in the  sitting-room, and through the window I could see Andrew bent over  his work table. We climbed out, stiff and sore from the long ride.  I saw Roger's face set in a comical blend of sternness and humour.    \"Well, here goes to surprise the Sage!\" he whispered.    We picked our way between puddles and rapped on the door. Andrew  appeared, carrying the lamp in one hand. When he saw us he grunted.    \"Let me introduce my wife,\" said Roger.    \"Well, I'll be damned,\" said Andrew.    But Andrew isn't quite so black as I've painted him. When he's  once convinced of the error of his ways, he is almost pathetically  eager to make up. I remember only one remark in the subsequent  conversation, because I was so appalled by the state of everything  at Sabine Farm that I immediately set about putting the house to  rights. The two men, however, as soon as Parnassus was housed in  the barn and the animals under cover, sat down by the stove to talk  things over.    \"I tell you what,\" said Andrew--\"do whatever you like with your  wife; she's too much for me. But I'd like to buy that Parnassus.\"    \"Not on your life!\" said the Professor."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53356"],[0,"Kate Vernon: A Tale. Vol. 2 (of 3) (#20)"],[1,"pause.    \"I suppose so,\" returned Kate, dreamily. \"Ah, nurse,\" she exclaimed,  a few moments after, as Mrs. O'Toole entered, about some household  matter, \"he is gone--he is happy--our kind, gentle friend, Mr. Gilpin.\"    \"The heavens be his bed,\" said Mrs. O'Toole, crossing herself. \"Och,  whin was he taken, Miss Kate?\"    \"Two days ago.\"    \"Athin 'twas he was fit to go! faith, he was worth a score iv clargy to  the poor; an', at the first goin' to A--, I used to think it beneath  ye, to be talkin' an' walkin, wid a poor crathure iv an organist; but  I was proud to spake to him aftherwards meself; for he always looked  as if he'd a taste iv heaven inside iv him, so he did. Sure, it's no  wondher, this is such a miserable place to be in, wid sich min as  Misther Gilpin an' the masther, whipt off like--like a pooff, or robbed  iv their own; an' sich chaps as Taaffe an' Moore, or thim in their  coaches, an' desavin' the world! faith, it's beyant me entirely, so it  is.\"    \"And beyond many a wiser head than either yours or mine, Nelly,\" said  the Colonel, kindly. \"We must leave all that to God.\"    \"Thrue for ye, sir.\" And she retired, murmuring--\"Och, blessed Jasus!  resave yer soul, mee poor Gilpin! It's a saint on airth ye wur!\"    So Kate's letter was written, in a very different strain from what she  had intended; and then she strolled with her grandfather in Kensington  Gardens. The old man seemed feeble and depressed; he took Kate's arm,  as he often did of late, and spoke much of his own advancing years,  and his anxiety, in the event of his death, for her in a tone that  thrilled her heart with fear and anguish. She strove to turn the  conversation--but it would not do.    \"I have no doubt, that you alone would find a happy home under  Georgina's roof; but I wish I might see you happily married, and in  a house of your own, before I am called away. I fear from Moore's  intelligence, brief and scanty as it is, there is no chance of our  gaining this fatal lawsuit, so that you will be totally unprovided  for;\" and he sighed deeply. \"Our relations are so few, and--\"    \"Oh, hush, hush, dearest and best!\" cried Kate; \"you cannot dream what  pain you inflict on me, by such words; do not fear for me; I never  know dread on my own account, for the future; you do not know the  strong courage of my heart--I did not know it myself till of late; we  cannot provide against future ills; why then darken the present by  anticipating them. Let us leave it all to God, as you told nurse this  morning; believe me, I fear nothing, except hearing you speak in this  manner.\"    The old man was silent for a while, and then resumed--    \"We little thought, the day Fred Egerton rushed back so gallantly to  rescue our poor friend, how soon that pleasant little party would be  scattered.\"    \"Little indeed,\" echoed Kate; \"next week it will be a year since the  ball at Carrington, where I first met him.\"    The Colonel smiled, and sighed.    \"He will be sorry to hear of poor Gilpin's death. I wonder he has not  written.\"    \"Good morning, Miss Vernon,\" said Langley, coming up behind them. \"I  hope you caught no cold last night? How do you do, Colonel Vernon?\"    The Colonel informed him of Gilpin's death; and he seemed rather  interested, as the compositions of the organist, which Kate had played  the night before, had pleased him greatly. Then they talked of great  musicians, and Mozart's Requiem, and the strange circumstances under  which it is said to have been composed.    \"How much I love those wild, mysterious German stories, they have an  indescribable charm for me,\" said Kate.    \"Why?\" asked Langley, in his blunt manner.    \"That is exactly what I cannot answer.\"    \"I never like what I do not understand.\"    \"How is it you are a painter then?\" asked Kate, in her turn.    \"I do not see what that has to do with the subject on which we were  speaking,\" he returned, startled at this attack.    \"How is it that you can give expression to a face with your pencil,  which you could not convey in words? Even a landscape may speak the  painter's soul, far more than the most eloquent description; so it is  that glimpses of what is far beyond our nature to comprehend, faint  though they be, give us an idea of space and might far more than any  even perfectly comprehended explanation, as mist-wreaths hide but  magnify the depths seen from a mountain.\"    \"A very poetical definition, Miss Vernon.\"    \"I speak but my thoughts,\" said Kate, steadily, though she blushed, and  felt uneasy; as enthusiasts always do, when the quick current of their  imagination is checked by some son of earth, who dignifies his dulness  by the name of strong common sense.    \"Well, Miss Vernon, I must think of what you say about painting.\"    \"Ah, you must have enthusiasm and imagination to be a painter, though  you are too English not to be ashamed of your better self.\"    \"That is what Galliard says.\"    \"Who is this Monsieur Galliard?\" asked the Colonel.    \"Oh, a very curious medley--his father was French, his mother  English--and his life has been divided between France, Italy, and  England--he is half a musician, half a painter, but wholly a writer for  newspapers and reviews, foreign and domestic; he is well thought of,  however, notwithstanding some vulnerable points--knows lots of people,  and is a very likely person to push you on well, Miss Vernon.\"    The Colonel winced at this conclusion.    \"You are very kind,\" said Kate; \"I quite begin to think you a real  friend, now I am more accustomed to you.\"    Langley stared, astonished! Old enough to be Miss Vernon's father, it  was extraordinary the influence this fair, bright, noble creature,  whose every word and thought were so at variance with the maxims of his  work-a-day world, was gaining over him.    Meanwhile, they had reached the Vernon's lodgings before he had  recovered the fit of musing into which Kate's words had thrown him.    \"I am glad you think me your friend,\" he said, at length, interrupting  an exposition of the state of the _Ancienne Regime_, as it existed  when he was in France, into which the Colonel had diverged, apropos to  Galliard.    \"I am quite sure you are 'no humbug,' as my partner of last night  would say,\" returned Kate, laughing.    And they parted.    Lady Desmond's letters were rather more frequent at this time, and  though they evinced, as usual, warm affection and sincere interest in  the fortunes of her relatives, there was a restlessness and despondency  in their tone which spoke of a spirit ill at ease. She frequently said  she would return to them, as they would not come to her; but months  flew by, and still she was among the \"distinguished English at present  in Florence.\" And Kate, who, in spite of herself, yearned for her  return, as for the first beam of the rising sun, as something that  would create a change for the better in the face of affairs, and also  longed to see the fair face of a much loved relative, felt that the  only reason why she did not quite despair of seeing Lady Desmond's  promises fulfilled, was because she dared not deprive herself of that  hope. The Colonel, too, clung to it, with an eagerness almost painful,  at times; and it was evident, this feverish anxiety was connected with  some intention of putting Kate under her guardianship.    And so their life rolled on--the only break in its monotony was a  slight difference between Mrs. Crooks, the landlady, and Mrs. O'Toole,  which arose from their mutual affection for the parrot. Nurse asserted  \"it was a mighty knowledgeable craythur iv a bird;\" and Poll verified  the statement of her admirer, by repeating various phrases she learnt  from Mrs. O'Toole, in a rich County Clare brogue. The poverty of the  kitchen fire was a constant source of vexation to Mrs. O'Toole.    \"Hesther, och! girl alive--will ye rouse up that fire a bit,\" was her  constant cry; and Poll never beheld the much enduring handmaid of Mrs.  Crooks, without screaming. \"Hesther, Hesther, rouse up the fire a bit.\"  \"Hesther ye divil!\" \"Ah, speak pretty, Poll,\" Mr. Crooks would then  exclaim, \"don't say such ugly words--say dear mistress.\" \"Ye divil,\"  Poll would reply.    \"Faith it would make ye break yer heart laughing, sir,\" said nurse,  who was detailing the events of their warfare, to the Colonel and  Kate, one evening. 'Spake pretty,' ses she, 'an don't be hollowin'  out thim vulgar Hirish words,' ses she. 'Och, God help ye woman,' ses  I, 'it's little ye know the differ between what's vulgar, an what's  genteel in this counthry,' ses I. 'Ye'd lave a poor Queen, to go sarve  a rich tinker, any hour of the twinty-four; an ye'd rummage through the  blackest dirt iv London for a halfpenny, though yer pocket was full iv  goold guineas, all the time--that's yer gintility in England,' sis I;  'an as for style, an rale quolity, faith it's so little--'\"    \"Dear nurse,\" interrupted Kate, gravely, \"I wish you had not made such  a long and irritating speech, to Mrs. Crooks; you must let me settle  your differences, and in future turn a deaf ear to any casual remarks  that may hurt your national vanity--they are not worth noticing.\"    \"Och, my gracious, Miss Kate, is an impident thief iv a lodging-house  keeper, to be let to have her talk about her betthers an--be the  powers! there's the post,\" cried nurse interrupting herself, \"an I  dhreamt, I had a letther from--\" she ran out hastily, and returned  almost immediately, with a disappointed look, \"It's for the masther.\"    \"From Winter,\" said he, opening it. An enclosed letter, with the  Indian post-mark fell from it. \"From Egerton, I do believe,\" cried the  Colonel; but no--within that again was another enclosure, the address,  written in an intoxicated looking hand, and much blotted. \"For Mrs.  O'Toole, at the Kurnel's in England.\"    \"It's for you, nurse,\" said Kate, with a heavy sensation of deep  disappointment weighing down her heart.    \"I'll engage it's"]]]
