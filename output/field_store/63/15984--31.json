And God forbid it should be so,\" said  Mr. Fox.    \"I then dreamed that I rushed down the gallery, and just as I was  going down the stairs, I saw you, Mr. Fox, coming up to the hall door,  dragging after you a poor young lady, rich and beautiful.\"    \"It is not so, nor it was not so. And God forbid it should be so,\" said  Mr. Fox.    \"I rushed downstairs, just in time to hide myself behind a cask, when  you, Mr. Fox, came in dragging the young lady by the arm. And, as you  passed me, Mr. Fox, I thought I saw you try and get off her diamond  ring, and when you could not, Mr. Fox, it seemed to me in my dream, that  you out with your sword and hacked off the poor lady's hand to get the  ring.\"    \"It is not so, nor it was not so. And God forbid it should be so,\" said  Mr. Fox, and was going to say something else as he rose from his seat,  when Lady Mary cried out:    \"But it is so, and it was so. Here's hand and ring I have to show,\" and  pulled out the lady's hand from her dress, and pointed it straight at  Mr. Fox.    At once her brothers and her friends drew their swords and cut Mr. Fox  into a thousand pieces.          LAZY JACK    Once upon a time there was a boy whose name was Jack, and he lived with  his mother on a common. They were very poor, and the old woman got her  living by spinning, but Jack was so lazy that he would do nothing but  bask in the sun in the hot weather, and sit by the corner of the hearth  in the winter-time. So they called him Lazy Jack. His mother could not  get him to do anything for her, and at last told him, one Monday, that  if he did not begin to work for his porridge she would turn him out to  get his living as he could.    This roused Jack, and he went out and hired himself for the next day  to a neighbouring farmer for a penny; but as he was coming home, never  having had any money before, he lost it in passing over a brook. \"You  stupid boy,\" said his mother, \"you should have put it in your pocket.\"  \"I'll do so another time,\" replied Jack.    On Wednesday, Jack went out again and hired himself to a cow-keeper, who  gave him a jar of milk for his day's work. Jack took the jar and put it  into the large pocket of his jacket, spilling it all, long before he got  home. \"Dear me!\" said the old woman; \"you should have carried it on your  head.\" \"I'll do so another time,\" said Jack.    So on Thursday, Jack hired himself again to a farmer, who agreed to  give him a cream cheese for his services. In the evening Jack took the  cheese, and went home with it on his head. By the time he got home the  cheese was all spoilt, part of it being lost, and part matted with his  hair. \"You stupid lout,\" said his mother, \"you should have carried it  very carefully in your hands.\" \"I'll do so another time,\" replied Jack.    On Friday, Lazy Jack again went out, and hired himself to a baker, who  would give him nothing for his work but a large tom-cat. Jack took the  cat, and began carrying it very carefully in his hands, but in a short  time pussy scratched him so much that he was compelled to let it go.  When he got home, his mother said to him, \"You silly fellow, you should  have tied it with a string, and dragged it along after you.\" \"I'll do so  another time,\" said Jack.    So on Saturday, Jack hired himself to a butcher, who rewarded him by the  handsome present of a shoulder of mutton. Jack took the mutton, tied it  to a string, and trailed it along after him in the dirt, so that by the  time he had got home the meat was completely spoilt. His mother was this  time quite out of patience with him, for the next day was Sunday,  and she was obliged to make do with cabbage for her dinner. \"You  ninney-hammer,\" said she to her son; \"you should have carried it on your  shoulder.\" \"I'll do so another time,\" replied Jack.    On the next Monday, Lazy Jack went once more, and hired himself to a  cattle-keeper, who gave him a donkey for his trouble. Jack found it hard  to hoist the donkey on his shoulders, but at last he did it, and began  walking slowly home with his prize. Now it happened that in the  course of his journey there lived a rich man with his only daughter,  a beautiful girl, but deaf and dumb. Now she had never laughed in her  life, and the doctors said she would never speak till somebody made her  laugh. This young lady happened to be looking out of the window when  Jack was passing with the donkey on his shoulders, with the legs  sticking up in the air, and the sight was so comical and strange that  she burst out into a great fit of laughter, and immediately recovered  her speech and hearing. Her father was overjoyed, and fulfilled  his promise by marrying her to Lazy Jack, who was thus made a rich  gentleman. They lived in a large house, and Jack's mother lived with  them in great happiness until she died.          JOHNNY-CAKE    Once upon a time there was an old man, and an old woman, and a little  boy. One morning the old woman made a Johnny-cake, and put it in the  oven to bake. \"You watch the Johnny-cake while your father and I go out  to work in the garden.\" So the old man and the old woman went out and  began to hoe potatoes, and left the little boy to tend the oven. But he  didn't watch it all the time, and all of a sudden he heard a noise, and  he looked up and the oven door popped open, and out of the oven jumped  Johnny-cake, and went rolling along end over end, towards the open door  of the house. The little boy ran to shut the door, but Johnny-cake was  too quick for him and rolled through the door, down the steps, and out  into the road long before the little boy could catch him. The little boy  ran after him as fast as he could clip it, crying out to his father and  mother, who heard the uproar, and threw down their hoes and gave chase  too. But Johnny-cake outran all three a long way, and was soon out of  sight, while they had to sit down, all out of breath, on a bank to rest.    On went Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to two well-diggers who  looked up from their work and called out: \"Where ye going, Johnny-cake?\"    He said: \"I've outrun an old man, and an old woman, and a little boy,  and I can outrun you too-o-o!\"    \"Ye can, can ye? we'll see about that?\" said they; and they threw down  their picks and ran after him, but couldn't catch up with him, and soon  they had to sit down by the roadside to rest.    On ran Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to two ditch-diggers who were  digging a ditch. \"Where ye going, Johnny-cake?\" said they. He said:  \"I've outrun an old man, and an old woman, and a little boy, and two  well-diggers, and I can outrun you too-o-o!\"    \"Ye can, can ye? we'll see about that!\" said they; and they threw down  their spades, and ran after him too. But Johnny-cake soon outstripped  them also, and seeing they could never catch him, they gave up the chase  and sat down to rest.    On went Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to a bear. The bear said:  \"Where are ye going, Johnny-cake?\"    He said: \"I've outrun an old man, and an old woman and a little boy, and  two well-diggers, and two ditch-diggers, and I can outrun you too-o-o!\"    \"Ye can, can ye?\" growled the bear, \"we'll see about that!\" and trotted  as fast as his legs could carry him after Johnny-cake, who never stopped  to look behind him. Before long the bear was left so far behind that  he saw he might as well give up the hunt first as last, so he stretched  himself out by the roadside to rest.    On went Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to a wolf. The wolf  said:--\"Where ye going, Johnny-cake?\" He said: \"I've outrun an old  man, and an old woman, and a little boy, and two well-diggers, and two  ditch-diggers and a bear, and I can outrun you too-o-o!\"    \"Ye can, can ye?\" snarled the wolf, \"we'll see about that!\" And he set  into a gallop after Johnny-cake, who went on and on so fast that the  wolf too saw there was no hope of overtaking him, and he too lay down to  rest.    On went Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to a fox that lay quietly in  a corner of the fence. The fox called out in a sharp voice, but without  getting up: \"Where ye going Johnny-cake?\"    He said: \"I've outrun an old man, and an old woman, and a little boy,  and two well-diggers, and two ditch-diggers, a bear, and a wolf, and I  can outrun you too-o-o!\"    The fox said: \"I can't quite hear you, Johnny-cake, won't you come a  little closer?\" turning his head a little to one side.    Johnny-cake stopped his race for the first time, and went a little  closer, and called out in a very loud voice _\"I've outrun an old man,  and an old woman, and a little boy, and two well-diggers, and two  ditch-diggers, and a bear, and a wolf, and I can outrun you too-o-o.\"_    \"Can't quite hear you; won't you come a _little_ closer?\" said the fox  in a feeble voice, as he stretched out his neck towards Johnny-cake, and  put one paw behind his ear.    Johnny-cake came up close, and leaning towards the fox screamed out:  I'VE OUTRUN AN OLD MAN, AND AN OLD WOMAN, AND A LITTLE BOY, AND TWO  WELL-DIGGERS, AND TWO DITCH-DIGGERS, AND A BEAR, AND A WOLF, AND I CAN  OUTRUN YOU TOO-O-O!\"    \"You can, can you?\" yelped the fox, and he snapped up the Johnny-cake in  his sharp teeth in the twinkling of an eye.          EARL MAR'S DAUGHTER    One fine summer's day Earl Mar's daughter went into the castle garden,  dancing and tripping along."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7440"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#20)"],[1," as a flagrant instance of injustice, for that, says he, he violently  dispossessed these poor orphans, the sons of an inferior artificer (whom the  author he quotes6 calls a carpenter) of this ground, and so founded the first  fabric of his worship with the like wickedness as he did his religion.7  But  to say nothing of the improbability that Mohammed should act in so impolitic a  manner at his first coming, the mohammedan writers set this affair ina quite  different light; one tells us that he treated with the lads about the price of  the ground, but they desired he would accept it asa present;8 however, as  historians of good credit assure us, he actually bought it,9 and the money was  paid by Abu Becr.1  Besides, had Mohammed accepted it as a present, the  orphans were in circumstances sufficient to have afforded it; for they were of  a very good family, of the tribe of Najjâr, one of the most illustrious among  the Arabs, and not the sons of a carpenter, as Dr. Prideaux's author writes,  who took the word Najjâr, which signifies a carpenter, for an appellative,  whereas it is a proper name.2     Mohammed being securely settled at Medina, and able not only to defend  himself against the insults of his enemies, but to attack them, began to send  out small parties to make reprisals on the Koreish; the first party consisting  of no more than nine men, who intercepted and plundered a caravan belonging to  that tribe, and in the action took two prisoners.  But what established his  affairs very much, and was the foundation on which he built all his succeeding  greatness, was the gaining of the battle of Bedr, which was fought in the  second year of the Hejra, and is so famous in the Mohammedan history.3  As my  design is not to write the life of Mohammed, but only to describe the manner  in which he carried on his enterprise, I shall not enter into any detail of  his subsequent battles and expeditions, which amounted to a considerable  number.  Some reckon no less than twenty-seven expeditions wherein Mohammed  was personally present, in nine of which he gave battle, besides several other  expeditions in which he was not present:4 some of them, however, will be  necessarily taken notice of in explaining several passages of the Korân.  His  forces he maintained partly by the contributions of his followers for this  purpose, which he called by the name of Zacât or alms, and the paying of which  he very artfully made one main article of his religion; and partly by ordering  a fifth part of the plunder to be brought into the public treasury for that  purpose, in which manner he likewise pretended to act by the divine direction.       4  Abulfeda.

In a few years by the success of his arms (notwithstanding he sometimes  came off by the worst) he considerably raised his credit and power.  In the  sixth year of the Hejra he set out with 1,400 men to visit the temple of  Mecca, not with any intent of committing hostilities, but in a peaceable  manner.  However, when he came to al Hodeibiya, which is situate partly within  and partly without the sacred territory, the Koreish sent to let him know that  they would not permit him to enter Mecca, unless he forced his way; whereupon  he called his troops about him, and they all took a solemn oath of fealty or  homage to him, and he resolved to attack the city; but those of Mecca sending  Araw Ebn Masúd, prince of the tribe of Thakîf, as their ambassador to desire  peace, a truce was concluded between them for ten years, by which any person  was allowed to enter into league either with Mohammed or with the Koreish as  he thought fit.     It may not be improper, to show the inconceivable veneration and respect  the Mohammedans by this time had for their prophet, to mention the account  which the above-mentioned ambassador gave the Koreish, at his return, of their  behaviour.  He said he had been at the courts both of the Roman emperor and of  the king of Persia, and never saw any prince so highly respected by his  subjects as Mohammed was by his companions; for whenever he made the ablution,  in order to say his prayers, they ran and catched the water that he had used;  and whenever he spit, they immediately licked it up, and gathered up every  hair that fell from him with great superstition.1     In the seventh year of the Hejra, Mohammed began to think of propagating  his religion beyond the bounds of Arabia, and sent messengers to the  neighbouring princes with letters to invite them to Mohammedism.  Nor was this  project without some success.  Khosrû Parvîz, then king of Persia, received  his letter with great disdain, and tore it in a passion, sending away the  messenger very abruptly; which when Mohammed heard, he said, \"GOD shall tear  his kingdom.\"  And soon after a messenger came to Mohammed from Badhân, king  of Yaman, who was a dependant on the Persians,2 to acquaint him that he had  received orders to send him to Khosrû.  Mohammed put off his answer till the  next morning, and then told the messenger it had been revealed to him that  night that Khosrû was slain by his son Shirûyeh; adding that he was well  assured his new religion and empire should rise to as great a height as that  of Khosrû; and therefore bid him advise his master to embrace Mohammedism.  The messenger being returned, Badhân in a few days received a letter from  Shirûyeh informing him of his father's death, and ordering him to give the  prophet no further disturbance.  Whereupon Badhân and the Persians with him  turned Mohammedans.3     The emperor Heraclius, as the Arabian historians assure us, received  Mohammed's letter with great respect, laying it on his pillow, and dismissed  the bearer honourably.  And some pretend that he would have professed this new  faith, had he not been afraid of losing his crown.4     Mohammed wrote to the same effect to the king of Ethiopia, though he had  been converted before, according to the Arab writers; and to       1  Abulfeda Vit. Moh. p. 85.  2  See before, p. 8.  3  Abulfeda, Vit. Moh. p. 92, &c. 4  Al Jannâbi.          Mokawkas, governor of Egypt, who gave the messenger a very favourable  reception, and sent several valuable presents to Mohammed, and among the rest  two girls, one of which, named Mary,1 became a great favourite with him.  He  also sent letters of the like purport to several Arab princes, particularly  one to al Hareth Ebn Abi Shamer,2 king of Ghassân, who, returning for answer  that he would go to Mohammed himself, the prophet said, \"May his kingdom  perish;\" another to Hawdha Ebn Ali, king of Yamâma, who was a Christian, and  having some time before professed Islamism, had lately returned to his former  faith; this prince sent back a very rough answer, upon which Mohammed cursing  him, he died soon after; and a third to al Mondar Ebn Sâwa, king of Bahrein,  who embraced Mohammedism, and all the Arabs of that country followed his  example.3     The eighth year of the Hejra was a very fortunate year to Mohammed.  In the  beginning of it Khâled Ebn al Walîd and Amru Ebn al As, both excellent  soldiers, the first of whom afterwards conquered Syria and other countries,  and the latter Egypt, became proselytes of Mohammedism.  And soon after the  prophet sent 3,000 men against the Grecian forces, to revenge the death of one  of his ambassadors, who being sent to the governor of Bosra on the same errand  as those who went to the above-mentioned princes, was slain by an Arab of the  tribe of Ghassân at Mûta, a town in the territory of Balkâ in Syria, about  three days' journey eastward from Jerusalem, near which town they encountered.  The Grecians being vastly superior in number (for, including the auxiliary  Arabs, they had an army of 100,000 men), the Mohammedans were repulsed in the  first attack, and lost successively three of their general, viz., Zeid Ebn  Hâretha, Mohammed's freedman, Jaafar, the son of Abu Tâleb, and Abdâllah Ebn  Rawâha; but Khâled Ebn al Walîd, succeeding to the command, overthrew the  Greeks with a great slaughter, and brought away abundance of rich spoil;4 on  occasion of which action Mohammed gave him the honourable title of Seif min  soyûf Allah, One of the Swords of GOD.5     In this year also Mohammed took the city of Mecca, the inhabitants whereof  had broken the truce concluded on two years before.  For the tribe of Becr,  who were confederates of the Koreish, attacking those of Khozâah, who were  allies of Mohammed, killed several of them, being supported in the action by a  party of the Koreish themselves.  The consequence of this violation was soon  apprehended, and Abu Sofiân himself made a journey to Medina on purpose to  heal the breach and renew the truce,6 but in vain, for Mohammed, glad of this  opportunity, refused to see him; whereupon he applied to Abu Becr and Ali, but  they giving him no answer, he was obliged to return to Mecca as he came.     Mohammed immediately gave orders for preparations to be made, that he might  surprise the Meccans while they were unprovided to receive him; in a little  time he began his march thither, and by the       1  It is, however, a different name from that of the Virgin Mary, which the  Orientals always write Maryam, or Miriam-whereas this is written Mâriya.   2  This prince is omitted in Dr. Pocock's list of the kings of Ghassân,  Spec. p. 77.  3  Abulfeda, bui sup. p. 94, &c.  4  Idem ib. p. 99, 100, &c.   5  Al Bokhâri in Sonna.  6  This circumstance is a plain proof that the Koreish had actually broken the  truce, and that it was not a mere pretence of Mohammed's as Dr. Prideaux  insinuates."]]]
