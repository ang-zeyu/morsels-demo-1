Never was poor doxy of a Muse  worse treated.  This was exalted like the other; but in a pillory.  It  made a day's sport for the mob, at my expense.  Was not that pain and  humiliation enough? But Galeazzo must visit upon me the rage of his  mortification.  Well, when he was done with me, Messer Lanti, high in  favour, begged the remnant of my folly, and it was thrown to him.  The  story leaked out; I had had so many holes cut in me.  It had been wiser  to seal my lips with kindness.  But the Duke, as you may suppose, loves  me to this day.'    As he spoke, they turned an angle of the battlements, and saw advancing  towards them, smiling and insinuative, the figure of Tassino.  Bernardo  started, in some wonder.  He had not set eyes on this dandiprat since  his public condemnation of him, and, if he thought of him at all, had  believed him gone to make the restitution ordered.  Now he gazed at him  with an expression in which pity and an instinctive abhorrence fought  for precedence.    The young man was brilliantly, even what a later generation would have  called 'loudly,' dressed.  He had emerged from his temporary pupation a  very tiger-moth; but the soul of the ignoble larva yet obtained between  the gorgeous wings.  Truckling, insinuative, and wicked throughout, he  accosted his judge with a servile bow, as he stood cringing before him.  Bembo mastered his antipathy.    'What!  Messer cavalier,' he said, struggling to be gay.  'Art  returned?'--for he guessed nothing of the truth.  Then a kind thought  struck him.  'Perchance thou comest as a bridegroom, _bene meritus_.'    Tassino glanced up an instant, and lowered his eyes. How he coveted the  frank audacity of the Patrician swashbuckler, with which he had been  made acquainted, but which he found impossible to the craven meanness of  his nature.  To dare by instinct--how splendid!  No doubt there is that  fox of self-conscious pusillanimity gnawing at the ribs of many a  seeming-brazen upstart. He twined and untwined his fingers, and shook  his head, and sobbed out a sigh, with craft and hatred at his heart.  Bernardo looked grave.    'Alas, Messer Tassino!' said he: 'think how every minute of a delayed  atonement is a peril to thy soul.'    This sufficed the other for cue.    'Atone?' he whined: 'wretch that I am!  How could a hunted creature do  aught but hide and shake?'    'Hunted!'    'O Messer Bembo! 'twas so simple for you to let loose the mad dog, and  blink the consequences for others.'    'Mad dog!'    'Now don't, for pity's sake, go quoting my rash simile. Hast not ruined  me enough already?'    'Alas, good sir!  What worth was thine estate so pledged?  I had no  thought but to save thee for heaven.'    'And so let loose the Duke, that Cerberus?  O, I am well saved, indeed,  but not for heaven!  Had it not been for the good Jacopo taking me in  and hiding me, I had been roasting unhousel'd by now.'    'Tassino, thou dost the Duke a wrong.  'Twas thy fear distorted thy  peril.  He is a changed man, and most inclined to charity and justice.'    Tassino let his jaw drop, affecting astonishment.    'Since when?'    'Since the day of thy disgrace.'    The other shook his head, with a smile of growing effrontery.    'Why, look you, Messer Bembo,' he said: 'you represent his conscience,  they tell me, and should know.  Yet may not a man and his conscience,  like ill-mated consorts, be on something less than speaking terms?'    He laughed, half insolent, half nervous, as Bernardo regarded him in  silence with earnest eyes.    'Supposing,' said he, 'you were to represent, of your holy innocence and  credulity, a little more and a little sweeter than the truth?  Think'st  thou I should have dared reissue from my hiding, were Galeazzo still  here to represent his own?  If I had ever thought to, there was that  buried a week ago in the walls yonder would have stopped me  effectively.'    'Buried--in the walls!  What?'    'Dost not know?  Then 'tis patent he is not all-confiding in his  conscience.  And yet thou shouldst know. 'Tis said thou lead'st him by  the nose, as St. Mark the lion.  Well, I am a sinner, properly  persecuted; yet, to my erring perceptives, 'tis hard to reconcile thy  saintship with thy subscribing to his sentence on a poor Franciscan  monk, a crazy dreamer, who came to him with some story of the stars.'    'O, I cry you mercy!  I quote Messer Jacopo, who was present.  \"Deserving of the last chastisement\"--were not those thy words?  And  Omniscience dethroned--a bewildered mortal like ourselves?  Anyhow, he  held thy saintship to justify his sentence on the monk.'    'What sentence?'    'Wilt thou come and see?  I have my host's pass.'    He staggered under the shock of a sudden leap and clutch.  Young  strenuous hands mauled his pretty doublet; sweet glaring eyes devoured  his soul.    'I see it in thy face!  O, inhuman dogs are ye all! Show me, take me to  him!'    Tassino struggled feebly, and whimpered.    'Let go: I will take thee: I am not to blame.'    Shaking, but exultant in his evil little heart, he broke loose and led  the way to a remote angle of the battlements, where the trunk of a great  tower, like the drum of a hinge, connected the northern and eastern  curtains. This was that same massy pile in whose bowels was situate the  dreadful oubliette known as the 'Hermit's Cell': a grim, ironic title  signifying deadness to the world, living entombment, utter abandonment  and self-obliteration.  It was delved fathoms deep; quarried out of the  bed-rock; walled in further by a mountain of masonry.  Tyranny sees an  Enceladus in the least of its victims.  On so exaggerated a scale of  fear must the sum of its deeds be calculated.    Here the Provost-Marshal had his impregnable quarters.  Looking down,  one might see the huge blank bulge of the tower enter the pavement below  unpierced but by an occasional loop or eyelet hole.  Its only entrance,  indeed, was from the rampart-walk; its direct approach by way of the  flying stair-way, up which Bembo had seen the monk disappear.  His heart  burned in his breast as he thought of him.  There was a fury in his  blood, a sickness in his throat.    A sentry, lounging by the door, offered, as if by preconcert with  Tassino, no bar to his entrance.  But, when Cicada would have followed,  he stayed him.    'Back, Fool!' he said shortly, opposing his halberd.    Cicada struggled a moment, and desisted.    'A murrain on thy tongue,' snapped he, 'that calls me one!'    The sentry laughed, and, having gained his point, produced a flask  leisurely from his belt.    'What! art thou not a fool?' said he, unstoppering it, and preparing to  drink.    'Understand, I have forsworn all liquor,' said Cicada, with a wry  twinkle.    'So art thou certainly a fool,' said the sentry, eye and body guarding  the doorway, as he raised the horn.    'Hist!' whispered Cicada, staying him: 'this remoteness--that damning  gurgle--come! a ducat for a mouthful!  Be quick, before he returns!'    The soldier, between cupidity and good-nature, laughed and handed over  the flask.  'Done on that!' said he.  But on the instant he roared out,  as the other snatched and bolted with his property.    'How, thou bloody filcher!  Give me back my wine!'    Cicada crowed and capered, dangling his spoil.    'Judas! for a dirty piece of silver to betray temperance!'    The sentry, with a furious oath, made at him.  He dodged; eluded;  finally, under the very hands of his pursuer, threw the flask into a  corner, and, as the other dived for it, slipped by and disappeared into  the tower. The soldier, cursing and panting in his wake, ran into the  arms of an impassive figure--staggered, fell back, and saluted.    Messer Jacopo eyed the delinquent a long minute without a word.  He had  been silent witness, within the guard-room, of all the little scene, and  was considering the penalty meet to such a breach of orders and  discipline.    There had been something of pre-arrangement in this matter between him  and Messer Tassino.  The two were in a common accord as to the loss and  inconvenience to be entailed upon themselves by any reform of existing  institutions--comprehensively, as to the menace this stranger was to  their interests.  It would be well to demonstrate to him the unreality  of his influence with Galeazzo.  Let him see the starving monk, in  evidence of his power's short limits.  It was possible the sight might  kill his presumption for ever: return him disillusioned to obscurity.    So his presence here had been procured, with orders to the sentry to  debar the Fool.  Jacopo wanted no shrewd cricket at the boy's side, to  leaven the horror for him with his song of cheer.  The full  impressiveness of the awful scene must be allowed to overbear his soul  in silence.  This sentry had erred rather foolishly.    It abated nothing of the terror of the man that no sign of passion ever  crossed his face, nor word his lips. He turned away, not having uttered  a sound; and left the delinquent collapsed as under a heat-stroke.    'Now, let it be no worse than the strappado!' prayed the poor wretch to  himself.    In the meanwhile, Cicada, swift, quivering, alert, was descending, like  a gulped Jonah, into the bowels of the tower.  He had no need to pick  his path: the well-stairway, like a screw pinning the upper to the  underworld, transmitted to him every whisper and shuffle of the  footsteps he was pursuing.  Sometimes, so deceptive were the echoes in  that winding shaft, he fancied himself treading close upon the heels of  the chase; yet each little loop-lighted landing found him, as he reached  it, audibly no nearer.  His mocking mouth was set grim; he dreaded, not  for himself but for his darling, some nameless entrapping wickedness.  'If they design it,' he thought--'if they design it!  Hell shall not  hide them from me.'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44235"],[0,"Memoirs of the Dukes of Urbino, Volume 2 (of 3) (#20)"],[1,"he was allowed to share the  instructions bestowed upon his patron's younger son Giovanni. A close  intimacy gradually sprang up between these fellow students, which  the similarity of their talents, their tastes, and their pursuits  ripened into lasting friendship. Identifying himself with the  Medici, he followed their fortunes into exile, and attended Giuliano  to Urbino, where he was received with the welcome there extended to  all who, like him, combined the scholar and the gentleman. But this  hospitality met with a very different return from these two guests.  Of Giuliano's generous forbearance to second the evil designs of his  brother, the Pope, against the state which had sheltered him, we have  lately spoken. When we come to narrate the usurpation of the duchy by  the Medici in 1516-17, we shall find in command of their invading army         \"That courteous Sir, who honours and adorns       Bibbiena, spreading far and high its fame,\"    and who had adopted that town as a substitute for his own  undistinguished patronymic. This ingratitude was the more odious if,  as it was probable, he owed to Guidobaldo, or his nephew, the favour  of Julius II., who first brought him forward in the public service.    At that Pontiff's death he was acting as secretary to his early  friend, the Cardinal de' Medici, and in that capacity was admitted  to the conclave. The intrigues which there effected his patron's  election have given rise to various anecdotes and controversies,  which we pass by with the single remark that, by all accounts, the  address of Dovizi was not unimportant to the success of Leo X. In  return, he was included in the first distribution of scarlet hats  as CARDINAL BIBBIENA. In this enlarged sphere his talents  and tastes had full room for exercise. He was selected for various  important diplomatic trusts, besides filling the offices of treasurer  and legate in the war of Urbino. With his now ample means, his  patronage of letters and arts had ample scope, and he was regarded  as the Maecenas of a court rivalling that of Augustus. Raffaele  enjoyed his particular regard, which he would willingly have proved  by bestowing on him the hand of his niece.    His ambition is alleged to have exceeded even the rise of his  fortunes, and to have prompted him to contemplate, and possibly to  intrigue for, his own elevation to the chair of St. Peter, in the  event of a vacancy. His sudden death in 1520, soon after a residence  of above a year as legate to Francis I. (who had conferred upon him  the see of Constance), when coupled with such reports, was construed  as the effect of poison administered by Leo. Indeed, his friend,  Ludovico Canossa, observed that it was a received dogma among the  French at that very time that every man of station who died in Italy  was poisoned. But such vague conjectures, however specious under  Alexander VI., are less credible in other pontificates; and if the  Cardinal were poisoned, that practice was then by no means limited  to popes. He was an accomplished dilettante when the standards of  beauty were of pagan origin; and his intimacy with Raffaele dated  after the painter's Umbrian inspirations had faded before a gradual  homage to the \"new manner.\" Like his friend Bembo, his morals were  epicurean to the full licence of a dissolute age. His famed comedy  of the _Calandra_,[*47] which was brought out at Urbino in 1508,  and which gave full play to his exquisite sense of the ridiculous,  justifies this charge, and all that we have so often to repeat of the  laxity then prevalent in the most refined Italian circles. A notice  of this, the only important production of his pen, and an account of  its being magnificently performed before Guidobaldo, will be found  in our twenty-fifth chapter. Those who regard the pontificate of Leo  X. as the classic period of Italian letters must feel grateful to  Cardinal Bibbiena for developing a portion of its lustre; the sterner  moralist, who brands its vices, will charge him with pandering  freely to the licence of a court of which he was a notable ornament.  Castiglione tells us that an acute and ready genius rendered him the  delight of all his acquaintance; and Baldi adds, that by practice  in the papal court he so improved that gift, that his tact in  business was unrivalled, to which his mild address, and happy talent  of seasoning the dullest topics with graceful pleasantry, greatly  contributed.    [Footnote *47: For all concerning this play and its performance at  Urbino in 1513, see VERNARECCI, _Di Alcune Rappresentazioni  Drammatiche alla Corte d'Urbino nel 1513_ in _Archivio Storico per  le Marche e per l'Umbria_, vol. III., p. 181 _et seq._ The original  prologue, by Bibbiena, was only recently made known by DEL  LUNGO, _La Recitazione dei Menaechmi in Firenze e il doppio  prologo della Calandria_, in the _Arch. Stor. Ital._, series III.,  vol. XXII., pp. 346-51. Machiavelli's estimate of Bibbiena will be  found in _Lettere Famil. di N. Machiavelli_, Firenze, 1883, p. 304,  \"Bibbiena, hora cardinale, in verita ha gentile ingegno, ed e homo  faceto et discreto, et ha durato a' suoi di gran fatica.\"]    His personal beauty obtained for him the adjunct of _bel_ Bernardo,  and he is represented in the _Cortegiano_ as saying, in reference to  the amount of good looks desirable for a gentleman, \"Such grace and  beauty of feature are, I doubt not, mine, in consequence whereof,  as you know, so many women are in love with me; but I have some  misgivings as to my figure, especially these legs of mine, which, to  say the truth, don't seem to me quite what I should like, though I am  well enough satisfied with my bust, and all the rest.\" This, however,  having been introduced as a jest, may perhaps be understood rather as  complimentary to his person, than as a sarcasm on his vanity.    A contemporary and unsparing pen thus sketches his qualities, in a  manuscript printed by Roscoe, from the Vatican archives:--\"He was a  facetious character, with no mean powers of ridicule, and much tact  in promoting jocular conversation by his wit and well-timed jests.  He was a great favourite with certain cardinals, whose chief pursuit  was pleasure and the chase, for he thoroughly knew all their habits  and fancies, and was even aware of whatever vicious propensities they  had. He likewise possessed a singular pliancy for flattery, and for  obsequiously accommodating himself to their whims, stooping patiently  to be the butt of insulting and abusive jokes, and shrinking from  nothing which could render him acceptable to them. He also had much  readiness in council, and was perfectly able seasonably to qualify  his wit with wisdom, or to dissemble with singular cunning.\" Bembo,  with more partial pen, says in a letter to Federigo Fregoso, \"The  days seem years until I see him, and enjoy the pleasing society, the  charming conversation, the wit, the jests, the features, and the  affection of that man.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Among the distinguished literary names which have issued from Arezzo,  several members of the ACCOLTI family were conspicuous in the fifteenth  and sixteenth centuries. BERNARDO,[*48] of whom we are now to speak,  had a father noted as a historian, a brother and a nephew who reached  the dignity of cardinal, and were remarkable in politics and letters.  He obtained from Leo X. the fief of Nepi, as well as various offices  of trust and emolument; of these, however, his wealth rendered him  independent, enabling him to indulge in a life of literary ease. His  poetical celebrity exceeded that of his contemporaries, and seems  to have been his chief recommendation at the court of Guidobaldo.  There, and at Rome, he was in the habit of reciting his verses in  public to vast audiences, composed of all that was brilliant in  these cultivated capitals. Nor was his popularity limited to a  lettered circle. When an exhibition was announced, the shops were  closed, the streets emptied, and guards restrained the crowds who  rushed to secure places among his audience. This extraordinary  enthusiasm appears the more unaccountable, when we find his printed  poetry characterised by a bald and stilted style, which leaves no  pleasing impression on the reader. The mystery seems explained by a  supposition that his talent lay in extemporary declamation.    [Footnote *48: On the Unico Aretino Bernardo Accolti, see especially  D'ANCONA, _Studi sulla Lett. Ital. de' primi secoli_ (Ancona, 1884),  in the essay, _Del Seicentismo nella poesia cortigiana del Secolo XV._,  pp. 217-18. He professed an extraordinary devotion for the Duchess of  Urbino.]    Instances are far from uncommon in Italy, of similar effects produced  by the _improvisatori_, whose torrent of melodious words, directed  to a popular theme, and accompanied by music and impassioned  gesticulation, hurries the feelings of a sympathising auditory to  bursts of tumultuous applause, whilst on cool perusal, the same  compositions fall utterly vapid on the reader. Be this as it may,  the success of Accolti had the common result of superficial powers,  and so egregiously inflated his vanity, that he assumed as his usual  designation \"the unique Aretine,\" by which he is always accosted  in the _Cortegiano_. Nine years later we find him devoting to  Duchess Elisabetta attentions which were attributed to a passion  more powerful than gratitude, but which, knowing as he well did,  her immaculate modesty, could only have been prompted by despicable  vanity, and hence exposed him to keen ridicule.           *       *       *       *       *    To few of the pedigrees illustrated by Sansovino is there attributed  a more remote origin, or a brighter illustration, than to that of  CANOSSA.[*49] A younger son of the family was COUNT LUDOVICO, who,  being cousin-german of Castiglione's mother, was perhaps by this  means brought to Urbino, and thence recommended to Julius "]]]
