I never  found out the name of this snake, which, as I have said, was of a dark  brick-red colour all over; and I only saw one other of the same kind  all the time I was in East Africa. I came upon it suddenly one day when  out shooting. It was evidently much startled, and stood erect, hissing  venomously; but I also was so much taken aback at its appearance that I  did not think about shooting it until it had glided off and disappeared  in the thick undergrowth.          CHAPTER XV    UNSUCCESSFUL RHINO HUNTS      Although the jungle round Tsavo was a network of rhino paths I had  never so far been successful in my efforts to obtain one of these  animals, nor was my ambition yet to be realised. One day I was out  exploring in the dense bush some six or seven miles away from camp, and  found my progress more than usually slow, owing to the fact that I had  to spend most of my time crawling on all-fours through the jungle. I  was very pleased, therefore, to emerge suddenly on a broad and  well-beaten track along which I could walk comfortably in an upright  position. In this were some fresh rhino footprints which seemed barely  an hour old, so I determined to follow them up. The roadway was beaten  in places into a fine white dust by the passage of many heavy animals;  and as I pushed cautiously forward I fully expected to come face to  face with a rhino at every corner I turned. After having gone a little  way I fancied that I really did see one lying at the foot of a tree  some distance ahead of me, but on approaching cautiously found that it  was nothing more than a great brown heap of loose earth which one of  the huge beasts had raised by rolling about on the soft ground. This,  however, was evidently a resting-place which was regularly used, so I  made up my mind to spend a night in the overhanging branches of the  tree.    The next afternoon, accordingly, Mahina and I made our way back to the  place, and by dusk we were safely but uncomfortably perched among the  branches directly over the path. We had scarcely been there an hour  when to our delight we heard a great rhino plodding along the track in  our direction. Unfortunately the moon had not yet risen, so I was  unable to catch sight of the monster as he approached; I knew, however,  that there was light enough for me to see him when he emerged from the  bushes into the little clearing round the foot of our tree. Nearer and  nearer we heard him coming steadily on, and I had my rifle ready,  pointing it in the direction in which I expected his head to appear.  But, alas, just at that moment the wind veered round and blew straight  from us towards the rhino, who scented us immediately, gave a mighty  snort and then dived madly away through the jungle. For some  considerable time we could hear him crashing ponderously through  everything that came in his way, and he must have gone a long distance  before he recovered from his fright and slowed down to his usual pace.  At any rate we neither heard nor saw anything more of him, and spent a  wakeful and uncomfortable night for nothing.    My next attempt to bag a rhino took place some months later, on the  banks of the Sabaki, and was scarcely more successful. I had come down  from Tsavo in the afternoon, accompanied by Mahina, and finding a  likely tree, within a few yards of the river and with fresh footprints  under it, I at once decided to take up my position for the night in its  branches. Mahina preferred to sit where he could take a comfortable  nap, and wedged himself in a fork of the tree some little way below me,  but still some eight or ten feet from the ground. It was a calm and  perfect night, such as can be seen only in the tropics; everything  looked mysteriously beautiful in the glorious moonlight, and stood out  like a picture looked at through a stereoscope. From my perch among the  branches I watched first a water-buck come to drink in the river; then  a bush-buck; later, a tiny paa emerged from the bushes and paused at  every step with one graceful forefoot poised in the air--thoroughly on  the alert and looking round carefully and nervously for any trace of a  possible enemy. At length it reached the brink of the river in safety,  and stooped to drink. Just then I saw a jackal come up on its trail and  begin carefully to stalk it, not even rustling a fallen leaf in its  stealthy advance on the poor little antelope. All of a sudden, however,  the jackal stopped dead for a second, and then made off out of sight as  fast as ever he could go. I looked round to discover the cause of this  hurried exit, and to my surprise saw a large and very beautiful leopard  crouching down and moving noiselessly in the direction of our tree. At  first I thought it must be stalking some animal on the ground below us,  but I soon realised that it was Mahina that the brute was intent on.  Whether, if left to himself, the leopard would actually have made a  spring at my sleeping gun-bearer, I do not know; but I had no intention  of letting him have a chance of even attempting this, so I cautiously  raised my rifle and levelled it at him. Absolutely noiseless as I was  in doing this, he noticed it--possibly a glint of moonlight on the  barrel caught his eye--and immediately disappeared into the bush before  I could get in a shot. I at once woke Mahina and made him come up to  more secure quarters beside me.    For a long time after this nothing disturbed our peace, but at last the  quarry I had hoped for made his appearance on the scene. Just below us  there was an opening in the elephant grass which lined the river's  edge, and through this the broad stream shone like silver in the  moonlight. Without warning this gap was suddenly filled by a huge black  mass--a rhino making his way, very leisurely, out of the shallow water.  On he came with a slow, ponderous tread, combining a certain  stateliness with his awkward strides. Almost directly beneath us he  halted and stood for an instant clearly exposed to our view. This was  my opportunity; I took careful aim at his shoulder and fired.  Instantly, and with extraordinary rapidity, the huge beast whirled  round like a peg-top, whereupon I fired again. This time I expected him  to fall; but instead of that I had the mortification of seeing him rush  off into the jungle and of hearing him crash through it like a great  steam-roller for several minutes. I consoled myself by thinking that he  could not go far, as he was hard hit, and that I should easily find him  when daylight arrived. Mahina, who was in a wild state of excitement  over the burra janwar (great animal), was also of this opinion, and as  there was no longer any reason for silence, he chatted to me about many  strange and curious things until the grey dawn appeared. When we got  down from our perch, we found the track of the wounded rhino clearly  marked by great splashes of blood, and for a couple of miles the spoor  could thus be easily followed. At length, however, it got fainter and  fainter, and finally ceased altogether, so that we had to abandon the  search; the ground round about was rocky, and there was no possibility  of telling which way our quarry had gone. I was exceedingly sorry for  this, as I did not like to leave him wounded; but there was no help for  it, so we struck out for home and arrived at Tsavo in the afternoon  very tired, hungry and disappointed.    Rhinos are extraordinary animals, and not in any way to be depended  upon. One day they will sheer off on meeting a human being and make no  attempt to attack; the next day, for no apparent reason, they may  execute a most determined charge. I was told for a fact by an official  who had been long in the country that on one occasion while a gang of  twenty-one slaves, chained neck to neck as was the custom, was being  smuggled down to the coast and was proceeding in Indian file along a  narrow path, a rhinoceros suddenly charged out at right angles to them,  impaled the centre man on its horns and broke the necks of the  remainder of the party by the suddenness of his rush. These huge beasts  have a very keen sense of smell, but equally indifferent eyesight, and  it is said that if a hunter will only stand perfectly still on meeting  a rhino, it will pass him by without attempting to molest him. I feel  bound to add, however, that I have so far failed to come across anybody  who has actually tried the experiment. On the other hand, I have met  one or two men who have been tossed on the horns of these animals, and  they described it as a very painful proceeding. It generally means  being a cripple for life, if one even succeeds in escaping death. Mr.  B. Eastwood, the chief accountant of the Uganda Railway, once gave me a  graphic description of his marvellous escape from an infuriated rhino.  He was on leave at the time on a hunting expedition in the  neighbourhood of Lake Baringo, about eighty miles north of the railway  from Nakuru, and had shot and apparently killed a rhino. On walking up  to it, however, the brute rose to its feet and literally fell on him,  breaking four ribs and his right arm. Not content with this, it then  stuck its horn through his thigh and tossed him over its back,  repeating this operation once or twice. Finally, it lumbered off,  leaving poor Eastwood helpless and fainting in the long grass where he  had fallen. He was alone at the time, and it was not for some hours  that he was found by his porters, who were only attracted to the spot  by the numbers of vultures hovering about, waiting in their ghoulish  manner for life to be extinct before beginning their meal. How he  managed to live for the eight days after this which elapsed before a  doctor could be got to him I cannot imagine; but in the end he  fortunately made a good recovery, the only sign of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38189"],[0,"A Treatise on Sheep: (#20)"],[1,"observations on the breeding  of sheep, and came to the conclusion, that changing and crossing the  breed of the animals is a matter of great importance, in preventing a  dwindling and degeneracy of the flock. Dr Coventry, in his pamphlet on  _Live-Stock_, gives it as his opinion, that \"The most perfect race of  animals may be debased by improper mixture, or injured by improper  treatment. Indiscriminate matches in breeding, and inattentive  management in rearing, are alike capable of producing a worthless  progeny.\" Here the matter is made very plain, from comparing an evil,  the progress of which is insidious, with the injurious consequences,  which the most unobserving can easily trace to a parallel neglect. Mr  Dick of Edinburgh, so well known for the valuable and trustworthy  information he has accumulated, has been informed by eminent farmers,  \"that cattle bred _in-and-in_, are very subject to _clyers_ in the  throat after they have attained their first year.\" By clyers are meant  enlarged lymphatic glands, which are a sure sign of what is termed a  scrofulous habit, a breaking up of the constitution, which, though  produced by a variety of causes, is yet frequently the result of an  \"_owr sib_\" connection. These are, I may say, the accidental opinions  of men who had no point to make good, in which their credit was at all  at stake, and who are not endeavouring to support the crude opinions  of former years. For these reasons, they possess a value which ought  to give them a proportional weight in an investigation like the  present. Mr Bakewell succeeded in bringing his sheep to great  perfection as regards form, and rapidity of fattening, by breeding in  the same family for a great many years; but it was attended with  considerable deterioration in the quality of the wool, and engendered  a liability to disease, sufficient to deter any one from proceeding a  similar length in the same track, to what is so dubiously called  improvement. See what Mr Dickson says to this effect, in a recent  number of the _Quarterly Journal of Agriculture_. \"The evil of  breeding _in-and-in_, or in other words, producing too great  refinement of tone, is manifested in the first instance by a  tenderness of constitution; the animals not being able to withstand  the extremes of heat and cold, rain and drought. If the evil is  prolonged through several generations, the forms of the animals become  affected, the bone becomes very small, the neck droops, the skin of  the head becomes tight and scantily covered with hair, the expression  of the eye indicates extreme sensibility, the hair on the body becomes  thin and short, and the skin as thin as paper; the _points_ continue  good, and predisposition to fatness increases, but the whole carcass  becomes much diminished in size, though retaining its plumpness, and  beautiful symmetry. The evil, however, does not terminate in the  production of these symptoms. Internal diseases ensue, such as  disorganization of the liver, or rot, polypi in the trachea, clyers,  malformation of the bones of the neck and legs, and general  deformity.\" This position, however, will be strengthened by drawing  attention to insulated portions of our race, where the effects of such  a system are exhibited on a considerable scale. The Members of the  Society of Friends were, at one time, supposed to be of all others the  least subject to insanity; but the very reverse is the case; being,  from the limited nature of their sect, driven to frequent  intermarriages, and to a consequent deterioration of the most active  part of the human frame--the brain. It is for the same reason, that  almost every royal family contains a large proportion of idiots, or,  at the best, persons of very weak intellect; and, such will continue  to occur, till legislators fall on some plan of striking at the  groundwork of the mischief. If the laws of God and man define to us so  clearly the evils of intermarrying with relatives; and if, as all  animals are constructed on one grand plan, we admit the proximity of  the sheep to the human race, it follows, that what is destructive, in  this respect, to the one, is destructive to the other; and that we  should seek, by a nearly similar, if not wider, range of rules, to  obviate many of those diseases of which, when under our protection,  they are so frequently the subjects.    (89.) _Breeding from different families of the same race._--Mr Culley,  though believing that no great harm can result from breeding  in-and-in, yet appears to have in a manner preferred the preferable  practice of breeding from different families of the same race; as he,  for many years, hired his rams from Mr Bakewell, at a time when other  breeders were paying a liberal price for his own valuable animals.  This is of all methods deservedly the best, as the males, which are  inter-changed, have always had shades of difference impressed upon  them, by various soils and treatment, so that the defects of each  family have a good chance to be counteracted by the perfections of the  other. By this means the bad points are gradually exhausted, and their  valuable properties as gradually heightened. Breeders have been much  aided in the furtherance of this desirable plan, by the rearing of  superior rams having become, of late years, a separate pursuit. The  letting of them out to distant parts of the country has long been a  branch of this speculation; diffusing some of the most valuable points  of particular breeds, and leading to a spirit of competition. The  practice has been reprobated, but, I presume, rather hastily; for with  all its attendant evils, such as leading to deception, by what is  termed the _making up_ of rams, it possesses excellencies which will,  I hope, lead to its continuance.    (90.) _Crossing._-The only other method of improving a breed is by  crossing two distinct races, one of which possesses the properties it  is desirable to acquire, and wants the defects we wish to remove.  This, however, is a measure not to be recommended, and only to be  resorted to when neither of the others will do; for it is scarcely  possible to obtain the desirable properties without at the same time  imparting qualities sufficient to neutralize them; and with which, in  fact, we would rather dispense. To cross, as Mr Cleghorn remarks, any  mountain breed with Leicester rams, with a view to obtain a propensity  to fatten at an early age, would be attended with an enlargement of  size, which the mountain pasture could not support, and the progeny  would be a mongrel race, not suited to the pastures of either of the  parent breeds. The folly of such a proceeding is beautifully shown in  the failure of the attempts made, some years ago, to better the fleece  of the mountain sheep, in the South of Scotland. To effect this  desirable end, rams were brought from the Cheviot range of hills, and  the consequences were, as described by Mr William Hogg, of Stobbo, in  the _Quarterly Journal of Agriculture_, just what a preliminary  consideration of the existing circumstances would have proved to be  unavoidable. \"The independent habits of the mountain flocks were lost,  and a mongrel progeny, of a clumsy figure, occupied the lowest and  warmest of the pastures. As they were very improper subjects to breed  from, they were often a drug in the market: _but the store-master had  no other resource, but to struggle on against the opposition which the  animal itself made to the change_, and, also, against the influence of  bad seasons, in order to get the influence of the Cheviot breed fully  established. * * * With its shaggy coat the animal lost its bold  independent look, its stout shape, its unvitiated taste, and its sound  constitution. A course of severe winters too occurred during the time  of changing, while every property calculated to resist privation and  fatigue was unconfirmed in the progeny; and, in consequence, the  ravages by rot, and poverty, among the flocks that occupied soft  pastures were immense.\" How did it happen, that the store-master had  no other resource but to persevere in an unprofitable course? Was he  obliged to strive against natural obstacles, which even a short  experience might have taught him were, in that manner, insurmountable?  Why not recur _at once_ to the old mode of management, rather than  injure himself by kicking against the pricks. \"Sundry store-masters  were not aware,\" says Mr Hogg, \"that their old breed would so  obstinately resist the impression of the Cheviot blood, nor did they  ever dream that the mongrel issue would be so easily subdued by the  hardships and cold of winter: thus finding their scheme opposed, at  points where they anticipated little resistance, they gave up the  experiment ere it was _half completed_, and introduced mountain rams  to the mongrel issue.\" Enough, however, has been said to prove that  this plan ought not to be pursued: let me now say a few words as to  the reasons which should deter us from its adoption. To take a  familiar illustration:--How would one of the worshipful company of  Aldermen, or a dignitary of the Church, manage to keep up an  _appearance_, if suddenly transported from the luxurious plenty which  surrounds him, to the meagre fare, and churlish climate, of our  Highlands? Would their offspring, which ten to one would be prone to  rapid growth, and, therefore, requiring at the least a large supply of  porridge and milk; would they, I ask, arrive at a healthy maturity, if  supported only on the oaten cake, and _whang_ of skimmed-milk cheese,  of the hardy Northern? The answer is, they would not. They would,  doubtless, bear the climate; but the habit of body imprinted on them,  by the full living of the parents, would require a more nutritious  food to bring it to the adult age, than what might be necessary for  the sustenance of any child descended from the possessors of the soil.  If such then is the case with"]]]
