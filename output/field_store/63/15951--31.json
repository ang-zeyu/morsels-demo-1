There was only one operator--Cottam--on board, and although  he was assisted to some extent later, when Bride from the Titanic had  recovered from his injuries sufficiently to work the apparatus, he had  so much to do that he fell asleep over this work on Tuesday night  after three days' continuous duty without rest. But we did not know  the messages were held back, and imagined our friends were aware of  our safety; then, too, a roll-call of the rescued was held in the  Carpathia's saloon on the Monday, and this was Marconied to land in  advance of all messages. It seemed certain, then, that friends at home  would have all anxiety removed, but there were mistakes in the  official list first telegraphed. The experience of my own friends  illustrates this: the Marconigram I wrote never got through to  England; nor was my name ever mentioned in any list of the saved (even  a week after landing in New York, I saw it in a black-edged \"final\"  list of the missing), and it seemed certain that I had never reached  the Carpathia; so much so that, as I write, there are before me  obituary notices from the English papers giving a short sketch of my  life in England. After landing in New York and realizing from the  lists of the saved which a reporter showed me that my friends had no  news since the Titanic sank on Monday morning until that night  (Thursday 9 P.M.), I cabled to England at once (as I had but two  shillings rescued from the Titanic, the White Star Line paid for the  cables), but the messages were not delivered until 8.20 A.M. next  morning. At 9 A.M. my friends read in the papers a short account of  the disaster which I had supplied to the press, so that they knew of  my safety and experiences in the wreck almost at the same time. I am  grateful to remember that many of my friends in London refused to  count me among the missing during the three days when I was so  reported.    There is another side to this record of how the news came through, and  a sad one, indeed. Again I wish it were not necessary to tell such  things, but since they all bear on the equipment of the trans-Atlantic  lines--powerful Marconi apparatus, relays of operators, etc.,--it is  best they should be told. The name of an American gentleman--the same  who sat near me in the library on Sunday afternoon and whom I  identified later from a photograph--was consistently reported in the  lists as saved and aboard the Carpathia: his son journeyed to New York  to meet him, rejoicing at his deliverance, and never found him there.  When I met his family some days later and was able to give them some  details of his life aboard ship, it seemed almost cruel to tell them  of the opposite experience that had befallen my friends at home.    Returning to the journey of the Carpathia--the last boatload of  passengers was taken aboard at 8.30 A.M., the lifeboats were hauled on  deck while the collapsibles were abandoned, and the Carpathia  proceeded to steam round the scene of the wreck in the hope of picking  up anyone floating on wreckage. Before doing so the captain arranged  in the saloon a service over the spot where the Titanic sank, as  nearly as could be calculated,--a service, as he said, of respect to  those who were lost and of gratitude for those who were saved.    She cruised round and round the scene, but found nothing to indicate  there was any hope of picking up more passengers; and as the  Californian had now arrived, followed shortly afterwards by the Birma,  a Russian tramp steamer, Captain Rostron decided to leave any further  search to them and to make all speed with the rescued to land. As we  moved round, there was surprisingly little wreckage to be seen: wooden  deck-chairs and small pieces of other wood, but nothing of any size.  But covering the sea in huge patches was a mass of reddish-yellow  \"seaweed,\" as we called it for want of a name. It was said to be cork,  but I never heard definitely its correct description.    The problem of where to land us had next to be decided. The Carpathia  was bound for Gibraltar, and the captain might continue his journey  there, landing us at the Azores on the way; but he would require more  linen and provisions, the passengers were mostly women and children,  ill-clad, dishevelled, and in need of many attentions he could not  give them. Then, too, he would soon be out of the range of wireless  communication, with the weak apparatus his ship had, and he soon  decided against that course. Halifax was the nearest in point of  distance, but this meant steaming north through the ice, and he  thought his passengers did not want to see more ice. He headed back  therefore to New York, which he had left the previous Thursday,  working all afternoon along the edge of the ice-field which stretched  away north as far as the unaided eye could reach. I have wondered  since if we could possibly have landed our passengers on this ice-floe  from the lifeboats and gone back to pick up those swimming, had we  known it was there; I should think it quite feasible to have done so.  It was certainly an extraordinary sight to stand on deck and see the  sea covered with solid ice, white and dazzling in the sun and dotted  here and there with icebergs. We ran close up, only two or three  hundred yards away, and steamed parallel to the floe, until it ended  towards night and we saw to our infinite satisfaction the last of the  icebergs and the field fading away astern. Many of the rescued have no  wish ever to see an iceberg again. We learnt afterwards the field was  nearly seventy miles long and twelve miles wide, and had lain between  us and the Birma on her way to the rescue. Mr. Boxhall testified that  he had crossed the Grand Banks many times, but had never seen  field-ice before. The testimony of the captains and officers of other  steamers in the neighbourhood is of the same kind: they had \"never  seen so many icebergs this time of the year,\" or \"never seen such  dangerous ice floes and threatening bergs.\" Undoubtedly the Titanic  was faced that night with unusual and unexpected conditions of ice:  the captain knew not the extent of these conditions, but he knew  somewhat of their existence. Alas, that he heeded not their warning!    During the day, the bodies of eight of the crew were committed to the  deep: four of them had been taken out of the boats dead and four died  during the day. The engines were stopped and all passengers on deck  bared their heads while a short service was read; when it was over the  ship steamed on again to carry the living back to land.    The passengers on the Carpathia were by now hard at work finding  clothing for the survivors: the barber's shop was raided for ties,  collars, hair-pins, combs, etc., of which it happened there was a  large stock in hand; one good Samaritan went round the ship with a box  of tooth-brushes offering them indiscriminately to all. In some cases,  clothing could not be found for the ladies and they spent the rest of  the time on board in their dressing-gowns and cloaks in which they  came away from the Titanic. They even slept in them, for, in the  absence of berths, women had to sleep on the floor of the saloons and  in the library each night on straw _paillasses_, and here it was  not possible to undress properly. The men were given the smoking-room  floor and a supply of blankets, but the room was small, and some  elected to sleep out on deck. I found a pile of towels on the bathroom  floor ready for next morning's baths, and made up a very comfortable  bed on these. Later I was waked in the middle of the night by a man  offering me a berth in his four-berth cabin: another occupant was  unable to leave his berth for physical reasons, and so the cabin could  not be given up to ladies.    On Tuesday the survivors met in the saloon and formed a committee  among themselves to collect subscriptions for a general fund, out of  which it was resolved by vote to provide as far as possible for the  destitute among the steerage passengers, to present a loving cup to  Captain Rostron and medals to the officers and crew of the Carpathia,  and to divide any surplus among the crew of the Titanic. The work of  this committee is not yet (June 1st) at an end, but all the  resolutions except the last one have been acted upon, and that is now  receiving the attention of the committee. The presentations to the  captain and crew were made the day the Carpathia returned to New York  from her Mediterranean trip, and it is a pleasure to all the survivors  to know that the United States Senate has recognized the service  rendered to humanity by the Carpathia and has voted Captain Rostron a  gold medal commemorative of the rescue. On the afternoon of Tuesday, I  visited the steerage in company with a fellow-passenger, to take  down the names of all who were saved. We grouped them into  nationalities,--English Irish, and Swedish mostly,--and learnt from  them their names and homes, the amount of money they possessed, and  whether they had friends in America. The Irish girls almost  universally had no money rescued from the wreck, and were going to  friends in New York or places near, while the Swedish passengers,  among whom were a considerable number of men, had saved the greater  part of their money and in addition had railway tickets through to  their destinations inland. The saving of their money marked a curious  racial difference, for which I can offer no explanation: no doubt the  Irish girls never had very much but they must have had the necessary  amount fixed by the immigration laws. There were some pitiful cases of  women with children and the husband lost; some with one or two  children saved and the others lost; in one case, a whole family was  missing, and only a friend left to tell of them. Among the Irish group  was one girl of really remarkable beauty, black hair and deep violet  eyes with long lashes,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6684"],[0,"Uneasy Money (#20)"],[1,"man, then at the scullery-maid, whose voice rose high  above the din.    'I rather fancy, m'lady,' said Wrench, dispassionately, 'that the  animal is about to hurl a plate.'    It had escaped the notice of those present that the shelf on which  the rioter had taken refuge was within comfortable reach of the  dresser, but Eustace himself had not overlooked this important  strategic point. As the butler spoke, Eustace picked up a plate  and threw it at the scullery-maid, whom he seemed definitely to  have picked out as the most hostile of the allies. It was a fast  inshoot, and hit the wall just above her head.    ''At-a-boy!' said the odd-job man, reverently.    Lady Wetherby turned on him with some violence. His detached  attitude was the most irritating of the many irritating aspects of  the situation. She paid this man a weekly wage to do odd jobs. The  capture of Eustace was essentially an odd job. Yet, instead of  doing it, he hung about with the air of one who has paid his  half-dollar and bought his bag of peanuts and has now nothing to  do but look on and enjoy himself.    'Why don't you catch him?' she cried.    The odd-job man came out of his trance. A sudden realization came  upon him that life was real and life was earnest, and that if he  did not wish to jeopardize a good situation he must bestir  himself. Everybody was looking at him expectantly. It seemed to be  definitely up to him. It was imperative that, whatever he did, he  should do it quickly. There was an apron hanging over the back of  a chair. More with the idea of doing something than because he  thought he would achieve anything definite thereby, he picked up  the apron and flung it at Eustace. Luck was with him. The apron  enveloped Eustace just as he was winding up for another inshoot  and was off his balance. He tripped and fell, clutched at the  apron to save himself, and came to the ground swathed in it,  giving the effect of an apron mysteriously endowed with life. The  triumphant odd-job man, pressing his advantage like a good  general, gathered up the ends, converted it into a rude bag, and  one more was added to the long list of the victories of the human  over the brute intelligence.    Everybody had a suggestion now. The cook advocated drowning. The  parlour-maid favoured the idea of hitting the prisoner with a  broom-handle. Wrench, eyeing the struggling apron disapprovingly,  mentioned that Mr Pickering had bought a revolver that morning.    'Put him in the coal-cellar,' said Lady Wetherby.    Wrench was more far-seeing.    'If I might offer the warning, m'lady,' said Wrench, 'not the  cellar. It is full of coal. It would be placing temptation in the  animal's way.'    The odd-job man endorsed this.    'Put him in the garage, then,' said Lady Wetherby.    The odd-job man departed, bearing his heaving bag at arm's length.  The cook and the parlour-maid addressed themselves to comforting  and healing the scullery-maid. Wrench went off to polish silver,  Lady Wetherby to resume her letters. The cat was the last of the  party to return to the normal. She came down from the chimney an  hour later covered with soot, demanding restoratives.    Lady Wetherby finished her letters. She cut them short, for  Eustace's insurgence had interfered with her flow of ideas. She  went into the drawing-room, where she found Roscoe Sherriff  strumming on the piano.    'Eustace has been raising Cain,' she said.    The Press-agent looked up hopefully. He had been wearing a rather  preoccupied air.    'How's that?' he asked.    'Throwing eggs and plates in the kitchen.'    The gleam of interest which had come into Roscoe Sherriff's face  died out.    'You couldn't get more than a fill-in at the bottom of a column on  that,' he said, regretfully. 'I'm a little disappointed in that  monk. I hoped he would pan out bigger. Well, I guess we've just  got to give him time. I have an idea that he'll set the house on  fire or do something with a punch like that one of these days. You  mustn't get discouraged. Why, that puma I made Valerie Devenish  keep looked like a perfect failure for four whole months. A child  could have played with it. Miss Devenish called me up on the  phone, I remember, and said she was darned if she was going to  spend the rest of her life maintaining an animal that might as  well be stuffed for all the liveliness it showed, and that she was  going right out to buy a white mouse instead. Fortunately, I  talked her round.    'A few weeks later she came round and thanked me with tears in her  eyes. The puma had suddenly struck real mid-season form. It clawed  the elevator-boy, bit a postman, held up the traffic for miles,  and was finally shot by a policeman. Why, for the next few days  there was nothing in the papers at all but Miss Devenish and her  puma. There was a war on at the time in Mexico or somewhere, and  we had it backed off the front page so far that it was over before  it could get back. So, you see, there's always hope. I've been  nursing the papers with bits about Eustace, so as to be ready for  the grand-stand play when it comes--and all we can do is to wait.  It's something if he's been throwing eggs. It shows he's waking  up.'    The door opened and Lord Wetherby entered. He looked fatigued. He  sank into a chair and sighed.    'I cannot get it,' he said. 'It eludes me.'    He lapsed into a sombre silence.    'What can't you get?' said Lady Wetherby, cautiously.    'The expression--the expression I want to get into the child's  eyes in my picture, \"Innocence\".'    'But you have got it.'    Lord Wetherby shook his head.    'Well, you had when I saw the picture,' persisted Lady Wetherby.  'This child you're painting has just joined the Black Hand. He  has been rushed in young over the heads of the waiting list  because his father had a pull. Naturally the kid wants to do  something to justify his election, and he wants to do it quick.  You have caught him at the moment when he sees an old gentleman  coming down the street and realizes that he has only got to sneak  up and stick his little knife--'    'My dear Polly, I welcome criticism, but this is more--'    Lady Wetherby stroked his coat-sleeve fondly.    'Never mind, Algie, I was only joking, precious. I thought the  picture was coming along fine when you showed it to me. I'll come  and take another look at it.'    Lord Wetherby shook his head.    'I should have a model. An artist cannot mirror Nature properly  without a model. I wish you would invite that child down here.'    'No, Algie, there are limits. I wouldn't have him within a mile  of the place.'    'Yet you keep Eustace.'    'Well, you made me engage Wrench. It's fifty-fifty. I wish you  wouldn't keep picking on Eustace, Algie dear. He does no harm. Mr  Sherriff and I were just saying how peaceable he is. He wouldn't  hurt--'    Claire came in.    'Polly,' she said, 'did you put that monkey of yours in the  garage? He's just bitten Dudley in the leg.'    Lord Wetherby uttered an exclamation.    'Now perhaps--'    'We went in just now to have a look at the car,' continued  Claire. 'Dudley wanted to show me the commutator on the exhaust-box  or the windscreen, or something, and he was just bending over  when Eustace jumped out from nowhere and pinned him. I'm afraid he  has taken it to heart rather.'    Roscoe Sherriff pondered.    'Is this worth half a column?' He shook his head. 'No, I'm afraid  not. The public doesn't know Pickering. If it had been Charlie  Chaplin or William J. Bryan, or someone on those lines, we could  have had the papers bringing out extras. You can visualize William  J. Bryan being bitten in the leg by a monkey. It hits you. But  Pickering! Eustace might just as well have bitten the leg of the  table!'    Lord Wetherby reasserted himself.    'Now that the animal has become a public menace--'    'He's nothing of the kind,' said Lady Wetherby. 'He's only a  little upset to-day.'    'Do you mean, Pauline, that even after this you will not get rid  of him?'    'Certainly not--poor dear!'    'Very well,' said Lord Wetherby, calmly. 'I give you warning that  if he attacks me I shall defend myself.'    He brooded. Lady Wetherby turned to Claire.    'What happened then? Did you shut the door of the garage?'    'Yes, but not until Eustace had got away. He slipped out like a  streak and disappeared. It was too dark to see which way he went.'    Dudley Pickering limped heavily into the room.    'I was just telling them about you and Eustace, Dudley.'    Mr Pickering nodded moodily. He was too full for words.    'I think Eustace must be mad,' said Claire.    Roscoe Sherriff uttered a cry of rapture.    'You've said it!' he exclaimed. 'I knew we should get action  sooner or later. It's the puma over again. Now we are all right.  Now I have something to work on. \"Monkey Menaces Countryside.\"  \"Long Island Summer Colony in Panic.\" \"Mad Monkey Bites One--\"'    A convulsive shudder galvanized Mr Pickering's portly frame.    '\"Mad Monkey Terrorizes Long Island. One Dead!\"' murmured Roscoe  Sherriff, wistfully. 'Do you feel a sort of shooting, Pickering--a  kind of burning sensation under the skin? Lady Wetherby, I guess  I'll be getting some of the papers on the phone. We've got a big  story.'    He hurried to the telephone, but it was some little time before he  could use it. Dudley Pickering was in possession, talking  earnestly to the local doctor.          14      It was Nutty Boyd's habit to retire immediately after dinner to  his bedroom. What he did there Elizabeth did not know. Sometimes  she pictured him reading, sometimes thinking. Neither supposition  was correct. Nutty never read. Newspapers bored him and books made  his head ache. And as for thinking, he had the wrong shape of  forehead. The nearest he ever got to meditation was a sort of  trance-like state, a kind of suspended animation in which his mind  drifted sluggishly like a log in a backwater. Nutty, it is  regrettable"]]]
