The weather was very pleasant, the sun shone clearly, and  all was tranquil, and no one expressed any apprehension of the awful  crisis that was near us--even at our doors.    \"It was about four o'clock P. M., while sitting in my cabin, with  my babe in my arms, and my wife standing by my side, the door being  open, I cast my eyes on the opposite bank of Shoal Creek, and saw a  large body of armed men on horses directing their course towards the  mills with all possible speed. As they advanced through the scattering  trees that bordered the prairie, they seemed to form themselves into  a three-square position, forming a vanguard in front. At this moment  David Evans, seeing the superiority of their numbers (there being two  hundred and forty of them, according to their own account), gave a  signal and cried for peace. This not being heeded, they continued to  advance, and their leader, a man named Comstock, fired a gun, which  was followed by a solemn pause of about ten or twelve seconds, when  all at once they discharged about one hundred rifles, aiming at a  blacksmith's shop, into which our friends had fled for safety. They  then charged up to the shop, the crevices of which, between the logs,  were sufficiently large to enable them to aim directly at the bodies of  those who had there fled for refuge from the fire of their murderers.  There were several families tented in the rear of the shop, whose lives  were exposed, and amid showers of bullets these fled to the woods in  different directions.    \"After standing and gazing at this bloody scene for a few minutes, and  finding myself in the uttermost danger, the bullets having reached the  house where I was living, I committed my family to the protection of  heaven; and leaving the house on the opposite side, I took a path which  led up the hill, following in the trail of three of my brethren that  had fled from the shop.    \"While ascending the hill we were discovered by the mob, who fired at  us, and continued so to do till we reached the summit. In descending  the hill I secreted myself in a thicket of bushes, where I lay till  8 o'clock in the evening. At this time I heard a voice calling my  name in an undertone. I immediately left the thicket and went to the  house of Benjamin Lewis, where I found my family--who had fled there  in safety--and two of my friends, mortally wounded, one of whom died  before morning. Here we passed the painful night in deep and awful  reflections upon the scenes of the preceding evening.    \"After daylight appeared some four or five men, with myself, who had  escaped with our lives from this horrid massacre, repaired as soon as  possible to the mills to learn the condition of our friends whose fate  we had but too truly anticipated.    \"When we arrived at the house of Mr. Haun, we found Mr. Merrick's body  lying in the rear of the house, and Mr. McBride's in front, literally  mangled from head to foot. We were informed by Miss Rebecca Judd, who  was an eye-witness, that he was shot with his own gun after he had  given it up, and then cut to pieces with a corn-cutter by a man named  Rogers, of Davies county, who kept a ferry on Grand River, and who  afterwards repeatedly boasted of this same barbarity. Mr. York's body  we found in the house. After viewing these corpses we immediately went  to the blacksmith's shop, where we found nine of our friends, eight of  whom were already dead--the other, Mr. Cox, of Indiana, in the agonies  of death, who soon expired.\"    But to sister Amanda Smith must be given the principal thread of this  tragedy, for around her centres the terrible interest of the Haun's  Mill massacre, which even to-day rises before her in all the horrors of  an occurring scene. She says:    \"We sold our beautiful home in Kirtland for a song, and traveled all  summer to Missouri--our teams poor, and with hardly enough to keep body  and soul together.    \"We arrived in Caldwell county, near Haun's Mill, nine wagons of us in  company. Two days before we arrived we were taken prisoners by an armed  mob that had demanded every bit of ammunition and every weapon we had.  We surrendered all. They knew it, for they searched our wagons.    \"A few miles more brought us to Haun's Mill, where that awful scene of  murder was enacted. My husband pitched his tent by a blacksmith's shop.    \"Brother David Evans made a treaty with the mob that they would not  molest us. He came just before the massacre and called the company  together and they knelt in prayer.    \"I sat in my tent. Looking up I suddenly saw the mob coming--the same  that took away our weapons. They came like so many demons or wild  Indians.    \"Before I could get to the blacksmith's shop door to alarm the  brethren, who were at prayers, the bullets were whistling amongst them.    \"I seized my two little girls and escaped across the mill-pond on a  slab-walk. Another sister fled with me. Yet though we were women, with  tender children, in flight for our lives, the demons poured volley  after volley to kill us.    \"A number of bullets entered my clothes, but I was not wounded. The  sister, however, who was with me, cried out that she was hit. We had  just reached the trunk of a fallen tree, over which I urged her,  bidding her to shelter there where the bullets could not reach her,  while I continued my flight to some bottom land.    \"When the firing had ceased I went back to the scene of the massacre,  for there were my husband and three sons, of whose fate I as yet knew  nothing.    \"As I returned I found the sister in a pool of blood where she had  fainted, but she was only shot through the hand. Farther on was lying  dead Brother McBride, an aged white-haired revolutionary soldier. His  murderer had literally cut him to pieces with an old corn-cutter. His  hands had been split down when he raised them in supplication for  mercy. Then the monster cleft open his head with the same weapon, and  the veteran who had fought for his country, in the glorious days of the  past, was numbered with the martyrs.    \"Passing on I came to a scene more terrible still to the mother and  wife. Emerging from the blacksmith shop was my eldest son, bearing on  his shoulders his little brother Alma.    \"'Oh! my Alma is dead!' I cried, in anguish.    \"'No, mother; I think Alma is not dead. But father and brother Sardius  are killed!'    \"What an answer was this to appal me! My husband and son murdered;  another little son seemingly mortally wounded; and perhaps before the  dreadful night should pass the murderers would return and complete  their work!    \"But I could not weep then. The fountain of tears was dry; the heart  overburdened with its calamity, and all the mother's sense absorbed  in its anxiety for the precious boy which God alone could save by his  miraculous aid.    \"The entire hip joint of my wounded boy had been shot away. Flesh, hip  bone, joint and all had been ploughed out from the muzzle of the gun  which the ruffian placed to the child's hip through the logs of the  shop and deliberately fired.    \"We laid little Alma on a bed in our tent and I examined the wound. It  was a ghastly sight. I knew not what to do. It was night now.    \"There were none left from that terrible scene, throughout that long,  dark night, but about half a dozen bereaved and lamenting women, and  the children. Eighteen or nineteen, all grown men excepting my murdered  boy and another about the same age, were dead or dying; several more of  the men were wounded, hiding away, whose groans through the night too  well disclosed their hiding places, while the rest of the men had fled,  at the moment of the massacre, to save their lives.    \"The women were sobbing, in the greatest anguish of spirit; the  children were crying loudly with fear and grief at the loss of fathers  and brothers; the dogs howled over their dead masters and the cattle  were terrified with the scent of the blood of the murdered.    \"Yet was I there, all that long, dreadful night, with my dead and my  wounded, and none but God as our physician and help.    \"Oh my Heavenly Father, I cried, what shall I do? Thou seest my poor  wounded boy and knowest my inexperience. Oh Heavenly Father direct me  what to do!    \"And then I was directed as by a voice speaking to me.    \"The ashes of our fire was still smouldering. We had been burning the  bark of the shag-bark hickory. I was directed to take those ashes and  make a lye and put a cloth saturated with it right into the wound. It  hurt, but little Alma was too near dead to heed it much. Again and  again I saturated the cloth and put it into the hole from which the  hip-joint had been ploughed, and each time mashed flesh and splinters  of bone came away with the cloth; and the wound became as white as  chicken's flesh.    \"Having done as directed I again prayed to the Lord and was again  instructed as distinctly as though a physician had been standing by  speaking to me.    \"Near by was a slippery-elm tree. From this I was told to make a  slippery-elm poultice and fill the wound with it.    \"My eldest boy was sent to get the slippery-elm from the roots, the  poultice was made, and the wound, which took fully a quarter of a yard  of linen to cover, so large was it, was properly dressed.    \"It was then I found vent to my feelings in tears, and resigned myself  to the anguish of the hour. And all that night we, a few poor, stricken  women, were thus left there with our dead and wounded. All through the  night we heard the groans of the dying. Once in the dark we crawled  over the heap of dead in the blacksmith's shop to try to help or soothe  the sufferers' wants; once we followed the cries of a wounded brother  who hid in some bushes from the murderers, and relieved him all we  could.    \"It has passed from my memory whether he was dead in the morning or  whether "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/544"],[0,"Anne's House of Dreams (#20)"],[1,"command our admiration but never our love.  The  sky was sharp and blue; the snow diamonds sparkled insistently; the  stark trees were bare and shameless, with a kind of brazen beauty; the  hills shot assaulting lances of crystal.  Even the shadows were sharp  and stiff and clear-cut, as no proper shadows should be.  Everything  that was handsome seemed ten times handsomer and less attractive in the  glaring splendor; and everything that was ugly seemed ten times uglier,  and everything was either handsome or ugly.  There was no soft  blending, or kind obscurity, or elusive mistiness in that searching  glitter.  The only things that held their own individuality were the  firs--for the fir is the tree of mystery and shadow, and yields never  to the encroachments of crude radiance.    But finally the day began to realise that she was growing old.  Then a  certain pensiveness fell over her beauty which dimmed yet intensified  it; sharp angles, glittering points, melted away into curves and  enticing gleams.  The white harbor put on soft grays and pinks; the  far-away hills turned amethyst.    \"The old year is going away beautifully,\" said Anne.    She and Leslie and Gilbert were on their way to the Four Winds Point,  having plotted with Captain Jim to watch the New Year in at the light.  The sun had set and in the southwestern sky hung Venus, glorious and  golden, having drawn as near to her earth-sister as is possible for  her.  For the first time Anne and Gilbert saw the shadow cast by that  brilliant star of evening, that faint, mysterious shadow, never seen  save when there is white snow to reveal it, and then only with averted  vision, vanishing when you gaze at it directly.    \"It's like the spirit of a shadow, isn't it?\" whispered Anne.  \"You can  see it so plainly haunting your side when you look ahead; but when you  turn and look at it--it's gone.\"    \"I have heard that you can see the shadow of Venus only once in a  lifetime, and that within a year of seeing it your life's most  wonderful gift will come to you,\" said Leslie.  But she spoke rather  hardly; perhaps she thought that even the shadow of Venus could bring  her no gift of life.  Anne smiled in the soft twilight; she felt quite  sure what the mystic shadow promised her.    They found Marshall Elliott at the lighthouse.  At first Anne felt  inclined to resent the intrusion of this long-haired, long-bearded  eccentric into the familiar little circle.  But Marshall Elliott soon  proved his legitimate claim to membership in the household of Joseph.  He was a witty, intelligent, well-read man, rivalling Captain Jim  himself in the knack of telling a good story.  They were all glad when  he agreed to watch the old year out with them.    Captain Jim's small nephew Joe had come down to spend New Year's with  his great-uncle, and had fallen asleep on the sofa with the First Mate  curled up in a huge golden ball at his feet.    \"Ain't he a dear little man?\" said Captain Jim gloatingly.  \"I do love  to watch a little child asleep, Mistress Blythe.  It's the most  beautiful sight in the world, I reckon.  Joe does love to get down here  for a night, because I have him sleep with me.  At home he has to sleep  with the other two boys, and he doesn't like it.  Why can't I sleep  with father, Uncle Jim?\" says he.  'Everybody in the Bible slept with  their fathers.'  As for the questions he asks, the minister himself  couldn't answer them.  They fair swamp me.  'Uncle Jim, if I wasn't ME  who'd I be?' and, 'Uncle Jim, what would happen if God died?'  He fired  them two off at me tonight, afore he went to sleep.  As for his  imagination, it sails away from everything.  He makes up the most  remarkable yarns--and then his mother shuts him up in the closet for  telling stories.  And he sits down and makes up another one, and has it  ready to relate to her when she lets him out.  He had one for me when  he come down tonight.  'Uncle Jim,' says he, solemn as a tombstone, 'I  had a 'venture in the Glen today.'  'Yes, what was it?' says I,  expecting something quite startling, but nowise prepared for what I  really got.  'I met a wolf in the street,' says he, 'a 'normous wolf  with a big, red mouf and AWFUL long teeth, Uncle Jim.'  'I didn't know  there was any wolves up at the Glen,' says I.  'Oh, he comed there from  far, far away,' says Joe, 'and I fought he was going to eat me up,  Uncle Jim.'  'Were you scared?' says I.  'No, 'cause I had a big gun,'  says Joe, 'and I shot the wolf dead, Uncle Jim,--solid dead--and then  he went up to heaven and bit God,' says he.  Well, I was fair  staggered, Mistress Blythe.\"    The hours bloomed into mirth around the driftwood fire.  Captain Jim  told tales, and Marshall Elliott sang old Scotch ballads in a fine  tenor voice; finally Captain Jim took down his old brown fiddle from  the wall and began to play.  He had a tolerable knack of fiddling,  which all appreciated save the First Mate, who sprang from the sofa as  if he had been shot, emitted a shriek of protest, and fled wildly up  the stairs.    \"Can't cultivate an ear for music in that cat nohow,\" said Captain Jim.  \"He won't stay long enough to learn to like it.  When we got the organ  up at the Glen church old Elder Richards bounced up from his seat the  minute the organist began to play and scuttled down the aisle and out  of the church at the rate of no-man's-business.  It reminded me so  strong of the First Mate tearing loose as soon as I begin to fiddle  that I come nearer to laughing out loud in church than I ever did  before or since.\"    There was something so infectious in the rollicking tunes which Captain  Jim played that very soon Marshall Elliott's feet began to twitch.  He  had been a noted dancer in his youth.  Presently he started up and held  out his hands to Leslie.  Instantly she responded.  Round and round the  firelit room they circled with a rhythmic grace that was wonderful.  Leslie danced like one inspired; the wild, sweet abandon of the music  seemed to have entered into and possessed her.  Anne watched her in  fascinated admiration.  She had never seen her like this.  All the  innate richness and color and charm of her nature seemed to have broken  loose and overflowed in crimson cheek and glowing eye and grace of  motion.  Even the aspect of Marshall Elliott, with his long beard and  hair, could not spoil the picture.  On the contrary, it seemed to  enhance it.  Marshall Elliott looked like a Viking of elder days,  dancing with one of the blue-eyed, golden-haired daughters of the  Northland.    \"The purtiest dancing I ever saw, and I've seen some in my time,\"  declared Captain Jim, when at last the bow fell from his tired hand.  Leslie dropped into her chair, laughing, breathless.    \"I love dancing,\" she said apart to Anne.  \"I haven't danced since I  was sixteen--but I love it.  The music seems to run through my veins  like quicksilver and I forget everything--everything--except the  delight of keeping time to it.  There isn't any floor beneath me, or  walls about me, or roof over me--I'm floating amid the stars.\"    Captain Jim hung his fiddle up in its place, beside a large frame  enclosing several banknotes.    \"Is there anybody else of your acquaintance who can afford to hang his  walls with banknotes for pictures?\" he asked.  \"There's twenty  ten-dollar notes there, not worth the glass over them.  They're old  Bank of P. E.  Island notes.  Had them by me when the bank failed, and  I had 'em framed and hung up, partly as a reminder not to put your  trust in banks, and partly to give me a real luxurious, millionairy  feeling.  Hullo, Matey, don't be scared.  You can come back now.  The  music and revelry is over for tonight.  The old year has just another  hour to stay with us.  I've seen seventy-six New Years come in over  that gulf yonder, Mistress Blythe.\"    \"You'll see a hundred,\" said Marshall Elliott.    Captain Jim shook his head.    \"No; and I don't want to--at least, I think I don't.  Death grows  friendlier as we grow older.  Not that one of us really wants to die  though, Marshall.  Tennyson spoke truth when he said that.  There's old  Mrs. Wallace up at the Glen.  She's had heaps of trouble all her life,  poor soul, and she's lost almost everyone she cared about.  She's  always saying that she'll be glad when her time comes, and she doesn't  want to sojourn any longer in this vale of tears.  But when she takes a  sick spell there's a fuss!  Doctors from town, and a trained nurse, and  enough medicine to kill a dog.  Life may be a vale of tears, all right,  but there are some folks who enjoy weeping, I reckon.\"    They spent the old year's last hour quietly around the fire.  A few  minutes before twelve Captain Jim rose and opened the door.    \"We must let the New Year in,\" he said.    Outside was a fine blue night.  A sparkling ribbon of moonlight  garlanded the gulf.  Inside the bar the harbor shone like a pavement of  pearl.  They stood before the door and waited--Captain Jim with his  ripe, full experience, Marshall Elliott in his vigorous but empty  middle life, Gilbert and Anne with their precious memories and  exquisite hopes, Leslie with her record of starved years and her  hopeless future.  The clock on the little shelf above the fireplace  struck twelve.    \"Welcome, New Year,\" said Captain Jim, bowing low as the last stroke  died away.  \"I wish you all the best year of your lives, mates.  I  reckon that whatever the New Year brings us will be the best the Great  Captain has for us--and somehow or other we'll all make port in a good  harbor.\"        CHAPTER 17    A FOUR WINDS WINTER    Winter set in vigorously after New Year's.  Big, white drifts heaped  themselves about the little house, and palms of frost covered its  windows.  The harbor ice grew harder and thicker, until the Four Winds  people began their usual winter travelling over it.  The safe ways were  \"bushed\" by a benevolent Government, and"]]]
