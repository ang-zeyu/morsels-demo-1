Roebling,  Jr., whose name is among the list of dead, went to the pier to see what  they could learn of his fate.    J. P. Morgan, Jr., arrived at the pier about half an hour before the  Carpathia docked. He said he had many friends on the Titanic and was  eagerly awaiting news of all of them.    Fire Commissioner Johnson was there with John Peel, of Atlanta, Gal, a  brother of Mrs. Jacques Futrelle. Mrs. Futrelle has a son twelve years  old in Atlanta, and a daughter Virginia, who has been in school in  the North and is at present with friends in this city, ignorant of her  father's death.      A MAN IN HYSTERICS    There was one man in that sad waiting company who startled those near  him about 9 o'clock by dancing across the pier and back. He seemed to be  laughing, but when he was stopped it was found that he was sobbing. He  said that he had a relative on the Titanic and had lost control of his  nerves.    H. H. Brunt, of Chicago, was at the gangplank waiting for A. Saalfeld,  head of the wholesale drug firm of Sparks, White & Co., of London, who  was coming to this country on the Titanic on a business trip and whose  life was saved.      WAITING FOR CARPATHIA    During the afternoon and evening tugboats, motor boats and even sailing  craft, had been waiting off the Ambrose Light for the appearance of the  Carpathia.    Some of the waiting craft contained friends and anxious relatives of the  survivors and those reported as missing.    The sea was rough and choppy, and a strong east wind was blowing. There  was a light fog, so that it was possible to see at a distance of only a  few hundred yards. This lifted later in the evening.    First to discover the incoming liner with her pitiful cargo was one  of the tugboats. From out of the mist there loomed far out at sea the  incoming steamer.      RESCUE BOAT SIGHTED    \"Liner ahead!\" cried the lookout on the tug to the captain.    \"She must be the Carpathia,\" said the captain, and then he turned the  nose of his boat toward the spot on t he horizon.    Then the huge black hull and one smokestack could be distinguished.    \"It's the Carpathia,\" said the captain. \"I can tell her by the stack.\"    The announcement sent a thrill through those who heard it. Here, at the  gate of New York, was a ship whose record for bravery and heroic work  would be a famuliar{sic} name in history.      {illust. caption = Copyright by G. V. Buck. MRS. LUCIEN P.

THE TRAGIC HOME-COMING    THE CARPATHIA REACHES NEW YORK--AN INTENSE AND DRAMATIC  MOMENT--HYSTERICAL REUNIONS AND CRUSHING DISAPPOINTMENTS AT THE  DOCK--CARING FOR THE SUFFERERS--FINAL REALIZATION THAT ALL HOPE FOR  OTHERS IS FUTILE--LIST OF SURVIVORS--ROLL OF THE DEAD    IT was a solemn moment when the Carpathia heaved in sight. There  she rested on the water, a blur of black--huge, mysterious,  awe-inspiring--and yet withal a thing to send thrills of pity and then  of admiration through the beholder.    It was a few minutes after seven o'clock when she arrived at the  entrance to Ambrose Channel. She was coming fast steaming at better than  fifteen knots an hour, and she was sighted long before she was expected.  Except for the usual side and masthead lights she was almost dark, only  the upper cabins showing a glimmer here and there.    Then began a period of waiting, the suspense of which proved almost too  much for the hundreds gathered there to greet friends and relatives or  to learn with certainty at last that those for whom they watched would  never come ashore.    There was almost complete silence on the pier. Doctors and nurses,  members of the Women's Relief Committee, city and government officials,  as well as officials of the line, moved nervously about.    Seated where they had been assigned beneath the big customs letters  corresponding to the initials of the names of the survivors they came to  meet, sat the mass of 2000 on the pier.    Women wept, but they wept quietly, not hysterically, and the sound of  the sobs made many times less noise than the hum and bustle which is  usual on the pier among those awaiting an incoming liner.    Slowly and majestically the ship slid through the water, still bearing  the details of that secret of what happened and who perished when the  Titanic met her fate.    Convoying the Carpathia was a fleet of tugs bearing men and women  anxious to learn the latest news. The Cunarder had been as silent for  days as though it, too, were a ship of the dead. A list of survivors  had been given out from its wireless station and that was all. Even the  approximate time of its arrival had been kept a secret.      NEARING PORT    There was no response to the hail from one tug, and as others closed in,  the steamship quickened her speed a little and left them behind as she  swung up the channel.    There was an exploding of flashlights from some of the tugs, answered  seemingly by sharp stabs of lightning in the northwest that served to  accentuate the silence and absence of light aboard the rescue ship. Five  or six persons, apparently members of the crew or the ship's officers,  were seen along the rail; but otherwise the boat appeared to be  deserted.    Off quarantine the Carpathia slowed down and, hailing the immigration  inspection boat, asked if the health officer wished to board. She  was told that he did, and came to a stop while Dr. O'Connell and two  assistants climbed on board. Again the newspaper men asked for some  word of the catastrophe to the Titanic, but there was no answer, and the  Carpathia continued toward her pier.    As she passed the revenue cutter Mohawk and the derelict destroyer  Seneca anchored off Tompkinsville the wireless on the Government vessels  was seen to flash, but there was no answering spark from the Carpathia.  Entering the North River she laid her course close to the New Jersey  side in order to have room to swing into her pier.    By this time the rails were lined with men and women. They were very  silent. There were a few requests for news from those on board and a few  answers to questions shouted from the tugs.    The liner began to slacken her speed, and the tugboat soon was  alongside. Up above the inky blackness of the hull figures could be made  out, leaning over the port railing, as though peering eagerly at the  little craft which was bearing down on the Carpathia.    Some of them, perhaps, had passed through that inferno of the deep sea  which sprang up to destroy the mightiest steamship afloat.    \"Carpathia, ahoy!\" was shouted through a megaphone.    There was an interval of a few seconds, and then, \"Aye, aye,\" came the  reply.    \"Is there any assistance that can be rendered?\" was the next question.    \"Thank you, no,\" was the answer in a tone that carried emotion with it.  Meantime the tugboat was getting nearer and nearer to the Carpathia, and  soon the faces of those leaning over the railing could be distinguished.      TALK WITH SURVIVORS    More faces appeared, and still more.    A woman who called to a man on the tugboat was asked? \"Are you one the  Titanic survivors?\"    \"Yes,\" said the voice, hesitatingly.    \"Do you need help?\"    \"No,\" after a pause.    \"If there is anything you want done it will be attended to.\"    \"Thank you. I have been informed that my relatives will meet me at the  pier.\"    \"Is it true that some of the life-boats sank with the Titanic?\"    \"Yes. There was some trouble in manning them. They were not far enough  away from her.\"    All of this questioning and receiving replies was carried on with the  greatest difficulty. The pounding of the liner's engines, the washing of  the sea, the tugboat's engines, made it hard to understand the woman's  replies.      ALL CARED FOR ON BOARD    \"Were the women properly cared for after the crash?\" she was asked.    \"Oh, yes,\" came the shrill reply. \"The men were brave--very brave.\" Here  her voice broke and she turned and left the railing, to reappear a few  moments later and cry:    \"Please report me as saved.\"    \"What name?\" was asked. She shouted a name that could not be understood,  and, apparently believing that it had been, turned away again and  disappeared.    \"Nearly all of us are very ill,\" cried another woman. Here several other  tugboats appeared, and those standing at the railing were besieged with  questions.    \"Did the crash come without warning?\" a voice on one of the smaller  boats megaphoned.    \"Yes,\" a woman answered. \"Most of us had retired. We saved a few of our  belongings.\"    \"How long did it take the boat to sink?\" asked the voice.      TITANIC CREW HEROES    \"Not long,\" came the reply? \"The crew and the men were very brave. Oh,  it is dreadful--dreadful to think of!\"    \"Is Mr. John Jacob Astor on board?\"    \"No.\"    \"Did he remain on the Titanic after the collision?\"    \"I do not know.\"    Questions of this kind were showered at the few survivors who stood at  the railing, but they seemed too confused to answer them intelligibly,  and after replying evasively to some they would disappear.      RUSHES ON TO DOCK    \"Are you going to anchor for the night?\" Captain Rostron was asked by  megaphone as his boat approached Ambrose Light. It was then raining  heavily.    \"No,\" came the reply. \"I am going into port. There are sick people on  board.\"    \"We tried to learn when she would dock,\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7820"],[0,"Monitress Merle (#20)"],[1,"her solitude, but that was  strictly forbidden on the ground that they might be germ-carriers and  convey the mumps to others. One day she was sitting at her table trying  to amuse herself with an everlasting game of patience, when she suddenly  heard peculiar noises on the roof above. There was a scraping and  bumping, as if an eagle or some other enormous bird had alighted there.  The sounds continued till at last there was a thump on the skylight and  Clive's mischievous face appeared grinning down at her. Immensely  thrilled she lifted the window, and he crawled farther along and thrust  his head through.    \"Hello, old girl! How are you getting on? I say! You do look rather a  sight! I wanted to have a squint at you! Are you going to have your photo  taken?\"    \"Don't be a young beast! How did you get up here?\"    \"They're repainting the house next door, so I took French leave and  borrowed the tall ladder. I've had rather a business clambering about  till I found your window. I say, does your face hurt?\"    \"Not much now, but it did at first.\"    \"You look like the picture of the fat woman at a fair!\"    \"Wait till you get it yourself, and then I'll jeer.\"    \"I'm awfully sorry for you! Look here, I've brought you some toffee. Can  you catch it if I throw it down? I've finished that boat we were making.  Tom helped me. Mavis is hemming some sails; then I'm going to try it on  the reservoir. I wish you could come with me!\"    \"So do I,\" said the patient dolefully. \"But that's out of the question.  Don't you think you ought to be going back? Suppose somebody takes away  the ladder!\"    \"I'd drop down into your room then.\"    \"And catch the mumps?\"    \"Shouldn't much care if it meant missing my lessons!\"    \"I can hear somebody coming upstairs!\"    \"I'll be off then. Ta-ta! You're not exactly beautiful, but on the whole  you don't look so bad as I expected. You needn't tell anybody I came!  Bye-bye!\"    On the 14th of February Merle was still a prisoner. She had almost  forgotten there was such a saint as St. Valentine, so it came as a great  surprise to find certain mysterious parcels brought up on her breakfast  tray. There were flowers and a packet of chocolates, and a new game of  solitaire, and an amusing little mascot dog with a movable head. It was  almost like having a birthday. On the top of the parcels was an envelope  addressed in a disguised handwriting. It contained a sheet of pink paper  bearing the picture of a heart pierced by an arrow, while Cupid drew his  bow in the distance. Underneath was written:      \"Sweet Merle, of Durracombe the belle,    Accept this heart that loves you well:    A heart most tender, kind, and true,    That lives and beats for only you!    'Twere cruel in this faithful heart    To plant and fix so big a dart,    So heal its wound I beg and pray,    And be my VALENTINE to-day!\"    The sender, as is usual in valentines, remained anonymous, and Merle  could only guess at the authorship, though she had strong suspicions of  Daddy and taxed him with it.    \"St. Valentine never lets out secrets!\" he twinkled. \"He's a most  discreet old gentleman. People don't make as much use of him as formerly.  Very foolish of them, for he came in extremely handy. It's a pity to let  good old customs drop. A St. Valentine revival society might be rather a  good idea. By the by, that heart isn't anatomically correct! It looks  more like a specimen from a butcher's shop than the human variety!\"    \"Don't be horrid!\" laughed Merle. \"You can't expect Cupid to know the  difference! He's sent me some nice things. Aren't there any more saints  in the calendar who bring presents? What's the next red-letter day?\"    \"Nothing till Shrove Tuesday, my dear, and by that time, I hope, you'll  be downstairs again, and eating your pancakes with the rest of the  family.\"          CHAPTER XI    Bamberton Ferry      Miss Pollard was extremely nervous on the subject of the mumps. She  insisted upon waiting until long after the usual period of disinfection  before she would allow Mavis and Merle to return to 'The Moorings.'    \"One can't be too careful!\" she fluttered. \"I know in a doctor's house  they are apt sometimes to take these things too lightly. It's far better  not to run any risks.\"    As Merle had a medical certificate of complete recovery, and neither  Mavis nor Clive had developed the complaint, there was now no reason for  keeping the girls away from school, and one Monday morning they were  received back into the fold. They had lost a considerable amount of  ground in regard to their lessons, and had to work hard to try to make up  for the weeks that were missed. At hockey, too, Merle found her teams  were slack. It needed much urging to persuade them to play a really  sporting game.    \"I daren't fix a match yet with any other school,\" she assured them. \"We  should only be beaten hollow, and it's no use playing if we have no  chance to win. You must all buck up and get more into the swing of  things. Perhaps next season we shall be a stronger team.\"    \"If we never play matches we shall never improve,\" objected Sybil, who  was anxious to accept the challenge of the Beverton County School.    \"We've got the credit of 'The Moorings' to think about!\" snapped Merle.  \"You wouldn't like them to go home crowing they'd absolutely wiped us off  the face of the earth? I've had a little experience in matches and I know  what I'm talking about. It would be downright silly to give ourselves  away.\"    Sybil was rather a thorn in Merle's side. She had come from another  boarding-school, and on the strength of this experience thought she had  the right to become at once a leader at 'The Moorings.' She was very  disgusted not to be in any position of authority, and consoled herself by  continual criticism of the monitresses, particularly Merle, with whom she  was always sparring. She was a curious character, all precept but not  much practice. She loved to give good advice and to lay down the law, and  was rather priggish in bringing out moral maxims for the benefit of  others. She had a tremendous sense of her own importance and what was due  to her, and was very ready to consider herself overlooked, or neglected,  or misunderstood.    \"Look here!\" said Merle bluntly one day. \"_Why_, I ask, _why_  should people be expected to make such a fuss over you? I don't wonder  you're neglected! I'd neglect you myself! And serve you jolly well right  too!\"    Whereupon Sybil dissolved into tears, and confided to her nearest friend  that so long as Merle Ramsay was monitress she was afraid she would never  be happy at 'The Moorings.' Poor Sybil had her good points. She was  generous in her own way, and rather affectionate, but nature had not  endowed her with tact, and she would go blundering on, never seeing that  she was making mistakes. Her very chums soon tired of her and discreetly  left her to some one else.    \"I sometimes think she's a little bit dotty!\" opined Nesta.    \"Nonsense! She's as sane as you or I. It's all swank! I've no particular  patience with her!\" said Merle.    One particularly aggravating feature of Sybil was the way she traded upon  rather delicate health. There was really nothing much the matter with  her, but she sometimes had slight attacks of faintness, which, the girls  declared, always came on when she thought she could be a subject of  interest. She liked to extract sympathy from Miss Mitchell, or to arouse  Miss Pollard's anxiety. Moreover, it was often a very good excuse for  slacking off in her preparation or her practising.    One afternoon Merle, coming back to school, met Miss Mitchell by the  gate.    \"I was just looking for you!\" said the teacher. \"I've arranged an extra  hockey practice at three, instead of English language. Will you tell the  others?\"    This was excellent news. The Fifth hated the English Language class,  which consisted mostly of learning strings of horrible derivations, and  to have it cut out for once in favour of hockey was quite an event. Merle  walked up the drive smirking with satisfaction. By the porch she found  Sybil, with an English language book in one hand, half-heartedly helping  Miss Fanny, who was nailing up creepers. She looked very sorry for  herself.    \"I wish you'd hold the ladder, Merle!\" she sighed, eager to thrust her  duties on to a substitute. \"I don't feel quite well this afternoon. I get  such a faintness. Aren't these derivations too awful for anything?\" she  added _sotto voce_. \"I don't believe I know one of them.\"    \"Buck up!\" whispered Merle with scant sympathy.    \"It's all very well to say 'buck up'! You don't know what it is to feel  faint. You're as strong as a horse. I'm really not fit to stand about!\"    \"Shall I ask Miss Fanny to let you go in and lie down?\"    \"I wish you would! I don't like to ask her myself; it seems making such a  fuss.\"    Merle proffered the request, with which Miss Fanny, rather astonished,  complied.    \"Certainly, Sybil, if you really are ill! Shall I give you a dose of sal  volatile?\"    \"No, thanks! I shall be all right if I can just rest on my bed,\" answered  the plaintive voice.    \"I daresay you'll soon feel better. It's a pity you'll miss the hockey  practice,\" said Merle.    \"What hockey practice?\"    \"Miss Mitchell has just told me to tell everybody. We're to play instead  of having English language this afternoon.\"    Sybil's face was a study. But Miss Fanny's eyes were fixed upon her with  such a questioning look that she was obliged to preserve her air of  faintness and continue to pose as an invalid. There was nothing for it  but to go and lie down. As she turned, however, she managed to whisper to  Merle:    \"You're the meanest thing on the face of this earth! Why couldn't you  tell me sooner about the hockey?\"    \"Your own fault entirely!\" chuckled Merle. \"You nailed me straight away  to do your job for you. Hope you'll enjoy yourself! Yes, Miss Fanny! I'm  coming"]]]
