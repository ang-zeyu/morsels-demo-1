And they carry seven or eight of these  each, put on the left arm; and they take one and put it on the  finger of the right hand, and make it spin round many times, and so  they hurl it at their enemies, and if they hit anyone on the arm or  leg or neck, it cuts through all. And with these they carry on much  fighting, and are very dexterous with them.    This king of Dely confines with Tatars, and has taken many lands  from the King of Cambay; and from the King of Dacan, his servants  and captains, with many of his people, took much, and afterwards in  time they revolted and set themselves up as kings. In this kingdom  of Dely there are some trees, the root of which is called  Baxarague,[193] and it is so poisonous that any one who eats it dies  at once; and its fruit is called Nirabixy,[194] and it is of such  virtue that it extinguishes all poison, and gives life to any one  poisoned with the said root or with other poisons. These jogues, who  come from the kingdom of Dely, carry this root and fruit; some of  them give it to some Indian kings; and so likewise they carry with  them sometimes rhinoceros' horn and Pajar stone, which possess great  virtue against all poisons. And this stone, Pajar, is grey and soft,  of the size of an almond; and they say that it is found in the head  of an animal: it is greatly esteemed amongst the Indians.[195]      COUNTRY OF MALABAR.    Having passed the province of Tulynate, which is of the kingdom of  Narsinga, along the coast of the sea, which province begins from  Cinbola near the mountain Dely, and ends at the Cape of Conmery,  which is a distance of seventy leagues along the coast towards the  south and south-east. And there begins the country of Malabar, which  was governed by a king who was called Sernaperimal,[196] who was a  very great lord. And after that the Moors of Mekkah discovered  India, and began to navigate near it, which was six hundred and ten  years ago; they used to touch at this country of Malabar on account  of the pepper which is found there. And they began to load their  ships with it in a city and seaport, Coulom,[197] where the king  used frequently to be. And so for some years these Moors continued  their voyages to this country of Malabar, and began to spread  themselves through it, and became so intimate and friendly with the  said king, that they made him turn Moor, and he went away with them  to die at the house of Mekkah, and he died on the road. And before  he set out from his country, he divided the whole of his kingdom of  Malabar amongst his relations; and it remained divided amongst them  and their descendants as it now is. And when he distributed the  lands, he abandoned those that he gave, never to return to them  again; and at last, when he had given away all, and there did not  remain anything more for him to give, except ten or twelve leagues  of land all round the spot from which he embarked, which was an  uninhabited beach, where now stands the city of Calicut. And at that  moment he was accompanied by more Moors than Gentiles, on account of  having given to the latter almost all that he possessed, and he had  with him only one young nephew, who waited on him as a page, to whom  he gave that piece of land; and he told him to get it peopled,  especially that very spot whence he embarked. And he gave him his  sword and a chandelier, which he carried with him for state. And he  left an injunction to the other lords, his relations to whom he had  made grants of lands, that they should obey him, only leaving exempt  the King of Coulam and the King of Cavanor:[198] so that he  instituted three kings in the country of Malabar, and commanded that  no one should coin money except the King of Calicut. And so he  embarked at the same place where the city of Calicut was founded;  and the Moors held this time and place in much veneration, and would  not after that go and load pepper any more in any other part since  the said king embarked there after becoming a Moor and going to die  at Mekkah. This city of Calicut is very large, and ennobled by many  very rich merchants and great traffic in goods. This king became  greater and more powerful than all the others: he took the name of  Zomodri,[199] which is a point of honour above all other kings. So  that this great King of Malabar did not leave more kings than these  three: that is to say, the Zomodry, who was named Cunelava-dyri, and  the King of Culaon, who was named Benate-diry, and the King of  Cananor, who was named Coletry.[200] And there are many other lords  in the country of Malabar, who wish to call themselves kings; and  they are not so, because they are not able to coin money, nor cover  houses with roofs under penalty of all the others rising up against  whomsoever should do such a thing, or of having to destroy them. And  these kings of Culam and Cananor afterwards struck money for a  certain time in their countries without having the power of doing  so. In all the country they use one language, which is called  Maleama, and all the kings are of one sect, and almost of the same  customs.    In these kingdoms of Malabar there are eighteen sects of Gentiles,  each one of which is much distinguished from the others in so great  a degree that the ones will not touch the others under pain of death  or dishonour or loss of their property: and all of them have  separate customs in their idol-worship, as will be set forth further  on.      CUSTOMS OF THE SAID KINGDOMS AND COUNTRY OF MALABAR.    In the first place, the Kings of Malabar are, as has been said,  Gentiles, and honour their idols: they are brown, almost white,  others are darker; they go naked from the waist upwards, and from  the waist downwards are covered with white cotton wraps and some of  them of silk. Sometimes they clothe themselves with short jackets  open in front, reaching halfway down the thigh, made of very fine  cotton cloth, fine scarlet cloth, or of silk and brocade. They wear  their hair tied upon the top of their heads, and sometimes long  hoods like Galician casques, and they are barefooted. They shave  their beards and leave the moustaches[201] very long, after the  manner of the Turks. Their ears are bored, and they wear in them  very precious jewels and pearls set in gold, and on their arms from  the elbows upwards gold bracelets, with similar jewels and strings  of very large pearls. At their wrists over their clothes they wear  jewelled girdles three fingers in width, very well wrought and of  great value.    And on their breasts, shoulders, and foreheads, they make marks by  threes with ashes, which they wear in accordance with the custom of  their sect, saying that they do it to remind themselves that they  have to turn to ashes: for when they die they burn their bodies, and  so this ceremony continues among them. And many use it mixed with  sandal wood, saffron, aloes wood, and rose water, all this ground  up. When they are in their houses they always sit on high benches,  and in houses without stories; these benches are very smooth, and  are slightly smeared once every day with cow dung. And they keep  there a stand very white and four fingers high, and a cloth of brown  wool undyed, after the manner of a carpet of the size of a  horsecloth[202] folded in three folds; and upon this they sit, and  they lean upon pillows, round and long, of cotton, silk, or fine  cloth. And they also sit on carpets of cloth of gold and silk; but  they always keep under them, or near them, that cloth of brown wool,  on account of their sect, and for state. And frequently they happen  to be lying on couches and cushions of silk and very fine white  sheets, and when any one comes to see them, they bring him this  brown woollen cloth and put it near him, and when he goes out, a  page carries the cloth folded before him for state and ceremony. And  likewise he always keeps a sword near him, and when he changes from  one spot to another, he carries it in his hand naked, as they always  keep it. These kings do not marry, nor have a marriage law, only  each one has a mistress, a lady of great lineage and family, which  is called nayre, and said to be very beautiful and graceful. Each  one keeps such a one with him near the palaces in a separate house,  and gives her a certain sum each month, or each year, for expenses,  and leaves her whenever she causes him discontent, and takes  another. And many of them for honour's sake do not change them, nor  make exchanges with them; and they seek much to please their king,  for that honour and favour which they receive. And the children that  are born from these mistresses are not held to be sons, nor do they  inherit the kingdom, nor anything else of the king's; they only  inherit the property of the mother. And whilst they are children,  they are favoured by the king like children of other people whom he  might be bringing up; but not like his own, because since they are  men, the children are not accounted for more than as children of  their mothers.[203] The king sometimes makes grants of money to  them, for them to maintain themselves better than the other nobles.  The heirs of these kings are their brothers, or nephews, sons of  their sisters, because they hold those to be their true successors,  and because they know that they were born from the body of their  sisters. These do not marry, nor have fixed husbands, and are very  free and at liberty in doing what they please with themselves.    In this wise the lineage of the kings of this country, and the true  stock, is in the women: that is to say, if a woman[204] gives birth  to three or four sons and two or three daughters, the first is king,  and so on, all the other brothers inherit from one another; and when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3829"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#20)"],[1," have  faded almost imperceptibly from the world, like Mr. Bardell, even if,  as in his case, it had involved being knocked on the head with a pint  pot in a public-house cellar.    In such a mood it is imperative that one should seek distraction. The  shining example of Mr. Harry Hawk did not lure me. Taking to drink  would be a nuisance. Work was what I wanted. I would toil like a navvy  all day among the fowls, separating them when they fought, gathering in  the eggs when they laid, chasing them across country when they got  away, and even, if necessity arose, painting their throats with  turpentine when they were stricken with roop. Then, after dinner, when  the lamps were lit, and Mrs. Ukridge nursed Edwin and sewed, and  Ukridge smoked cigars and incited the gramophone to murder \"Mumbling  Mose,\" I would steal away to my bedroom and write--and write--and  _write_. And go on writing till my fingers were numb and my eyes  refused to do their duty. And, when time had passed, I might come to  feel that it was all for the best. A man must go through the fire  before he can write his masterpiece. We learn in suffering what we  teach in song. What we lose on the swings we make up on the  roundabouts. Jerry Garnet, the Man, might become a depressed, hopeless  wreck, with the iron planted immovably in his soul; but Jeremy Garnet,  the Author, should turn out such a novel of gloom, that strong critics  would weep, and the public jostle for copies till Mudie's doorway  became a shambles.    Thus might I some day feel that all this anguish was really a  blessing--effectively disguised.     * * * * *    But I doubted it.     * * * * *    We were none of us very cheerful now at the farm. Even Ukridge's spirit  was a little daunted by the bills which poured in by every post. It was  as if the tradesmen of the neighbourhood had formed a league, and were  working in concert. Or it may have been due to thought-waves. Little  accounts came not in single spies but in battalions. The popular demand  for the sight of the colour of his money grew daily. Every morning at  breakfast he would give us fresh bulletins of the state of mind of each  of our creditors, and thrill us with the announcement that Whiteley's  were getting cross, and Harrod's jumpy or that the bearings of Dawlish,  the grocer, were becoming overheated. We lived in a continual  atmosphere of worry. Chicken and nothing but chicken at meals, and  chicken and nothing but chicken between meals had frayed our nerves. An  air of defeat hung over the place. We were a beaten side, and we  realised it. We had been playing an uphill game for nearly two months,  and the strain was beginning to tell. Ukridge became uncannily silent.  Mrs. Ukridge, though she did not understand, I fancy, the details of  the matter, was worried because Ukridge was. Mrs. Beale had long since  been turned into a soured cynic by the lack of chances vouchsafed her  for the exercise of her art. And as for me, I have never since spent so  profoundly miserably a week. I was not even permitted the anodyne of  work. There seemed to be nothing to do on the farm. The chickens were  quite happy, and only asked to be let alone and allowed to have their  meals at regular intervals. And every day one or more of their number  would vanish into the kitchen, Mrs. Beale would serve up the corpse in  some cunning disguise, and we would try to delude ourselves into the  idea that it was something altogether different.    There was one solitary gleam of variety in our menu. An editor sent me  a cheque for a set of verses. We cashed that cheque and trooped round  the town in a body, laying out the money. We bought a leg of mutton,  and a tongue and sardines, and pine-apple chunks, and potted meat, and  many other noble things, and had a perfect banquet. Mrs. Beale, with  the scenario of a smile on her face, the first that she had worn in  these days of stress, brought in the joint, and uncovered it with an  air.    \"Thank God!\" said Ukridge, as he began to carve.    It was the first time I had ever heard him say a grace, and if ever an  occasion merited such a deviation from habit, this occasion did.    After that we relapsed into routine again.    Deprived of physical labour, with the exception of golf and  bathing--trivial sports compared with work in the fowl-run at its  hardest--I tried to make up for it by working at my novel.    It refused to materialise.    The only progress I achieved was with my villain.    I drew him from the professor, and made him a blackmailer. He had  several other social defects, but that was his profession. That was the  thing he did really well.    It was on one of the many occasions on which I had sat in my room, pen  in hand, through the whole of a lovely afternoon, with no better result  than a slight headache, that I bethought me of that little paradise on  the Ware Cliff, hung over the sea and backed by green woods. I had not  been there for some time, owing principally to an entirely erroneous  idea that I could do more solid work sitting in a straight hard chair  at a table than lying on soft turf with the sea wind in my eyes.    But now the desire to visit that little clearing again drove me from my  room. In the drawing-room below the gramophone was dealing brassily  with \"Mister Blackman.\" Outside the sun was just thinking of setting.  The Ware Cliff was the best medicine for me. What does Kipling say?      \"And soon you will find that the sun and the wind       And the Djinn of the Garden, too,     Have lightened the hump, Cameelious Hump,       The Hump that is black and blue.\"    His instructions include digging with a hoe and a shovel also, but I  could omit that. The sun and the wind were what I needed.    I took the upper road. In certain moods I preferred it to the path  along the cliff. I walked fast. The exercise was soothing.    To reach my favourite clearing I had to take to the fields on the left,  and strike down hill in the direction of the sea. I hurried down the  narrow path.    I broke into the clearing at a jog trot, and stood panting. And at the  same moment, looking cool and beautiful in her white dress, Phyllis  entered in from the other side. Phyllis--without the professor.        CHAPTER XVII    OF A SENTIMENTAL NATURE    She was wearing a panama, and she carried a sketching-block and  camp-stool.    \"Good evening,\" I said.    \"Good evening,\" said she.    It is curious how different the same words can sound, when spoken by  different people. My \"good evening\" might have been that of a man with  a particularly guilty conscience caught in the act of doing something  more than usually ignoble. She spoke like a rather offended angel.    \"It's a lovely evening,\" I went on pluckily.    \"Very.\"    \"The sunset!\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Er--\"    She raised a pair of blue eyes, devoid of all expression save a faint  suggestion of surprise, and gazed through me for a moment at some  object a couple of thousand miles away, and lowered them again, leaving  me with a vague feeling that there was something wrong with my personal  appearance.    Very calmly she moved to the edge of the cliff, arranged her  camp-stool, and sat down. Neither of us spoke a word. I watched her  while she filled a little mug with water from a little bottle, opened  her paint-box, selected a brush, and placed her sketching-block in  position.    She began to paint.    Now, by all the laws of good taste, I should before this have made a  dignified exit. It was plain that I was not to be regarded as an  essential ornament of this portion of the Ware Cliff. By now, if I had  been the Perfect Gentleman, I ought to have been a quarter of a mile  away.    But there is a definite limit to what a man can do. I remained.    The sinking sun flung a carpet of gold across the sea. Phyllis' hair  was tinged with it. Little waves tumbled lazily on the beach below.  Except for the song of a distant blackbird, running through its  repertoire before retiring for the night, everything was silent.    She sat there, dipping and painting and dipping again, with never a  word for me--standing patiently and humbly behind her.    \"Miss Derrick,\" I said.    She half turned her head.    \"Yes.\"    \"Why won't you speak to me?\" I said.    \"I don't understand you.\"    \"Why won't you speak to me?\"    \"I think you know, Mr. Garnet.\"    \"It is because of that boat accident?\"    \"Accident!\"    \"Episode,\" I amended.    She went on painting in silence. From where I stood I could see her  profile. Her chin was tilted. Her expression was determined.    \"Is it?\" I said.    \"Need we discuss it?\"    \"Not if you do not wish it.\"    I paused.    \"But,\" I added, \"I should have liked a chance to defend myself.... What  glorious sunsets there have been these last few days. I believe we  shall have this sort of weather for another month.\"    \"I should not have thought that possible.\"    \"The glass is going up,\" I said.    \"I was not talking about the weather.\"    \"It was dull of me to introduce such a worn-out topic.\"    \"You said you could defend yourself.\"    \"I said I should like the chance to do so.\"    \"You have it.\"    \"That's very kind of you. Thank you.\"    \"Is there any reason for gratitude?\"    \"Every reason.\"    \"Go on, Mr. Garnet. I can listen while I paint. But please sit down. I  don't like being talked to from a height.\"    I sat down on the grass in front of her, feeling as I did so that the  change of position in a manner clipped my wings. It is difficult to  speak movingly while sitting on the ground. Instinctively I avoided  eloquence. Standing up, I might have been pathetic and pleading.  Sitting down, I was compelled to be matter-of-fact.    \"You remember, of course, the night you and Professor Derrick dined  with us? When I say dined, I use the word in a loose sense.\"    For a moment I thought she was going to smile. We were both thinking of  Edwin. But it was only for a moment, and then her face grew cold once  more,"]]]
