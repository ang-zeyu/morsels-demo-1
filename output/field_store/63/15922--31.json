No doubt they despise us, and tell  themselves that we are not real smokers, but I fancy that they  feel a little uneasy sometimes. For my young friends are always  trying to persuade me to join their school, to become one of the  white-spotted ones. I have no desire to be of their company, but  I am prepared to make a suggestion to the founder of the school.  It is that he should invent a pipe, white spot and all, which  smokes itself. His pupils could hang it in the mouth as  picturesquely as before, but the incidental bother of keeping it  alight would no longer trouble them.          The Path to Glory      My friend Mr. Sidney Mandragon is getting on. He is now one of  the great ones of the earth. He has just been referred to as  \"Among those present was Mr. Sidney Mandragon.\"    As everybody knows (or will know when they have read this  article) the four stages along the road to literary fame are  marked by the four different manners in which the traveller's  presence at a public function is recorded in the Press. At the  first stage the reporter glances at the list of guests, and says  to himself, \"Mr. George Meredith --never heard of him,\" and for  all the world knows next morning, Mr. George Meredith might just  as well have stayed at home. At the second stage (some years  later) the reporter murmurs to his neighbour in a puzzled sort of  way: \"George Meredith? George Meredith? Now where have I come  across that name lately? Wasn't he the man who pushed a  wheelbarrow across America? Or was he the chap who gave evidence  in that murder trial last week?\" And, feeling that in either case  his readers will be interested in the fellow, he says: \"The  guests included ... Mr. George Meredith and many others.\" At the  third stage the reporter knows at last who Mr. George Meredith  is. Having seen an advertisement of one of his books, and being  pretty sure that the public has read none of them, he refers to  him as \"Mr. George Meredith, the well-known novelist.\" The fourth  and final stage, beyond the reach of all but the favoured few, is  arrived at when the reporter can leave the name to his public  unticketed, and says again, \"Among those present was Mr. George  Meredith.\"    The third stage is easy to reach--indeed, too easy. The \"well-  known actresses\" are not Ellen Terry, Irene Vanbrugh and Marie  Tempest, but Miss Birdie Vavasour, who has discovered a new way  of darkening the hair, and Miss Girlie de Tracy, who has been  arrested for shop-lifting. In the same way, the more the Press  insists that a writer is \"well-known,\" the less hope will he have  that the public has heard of him. Better far to remain at the  second stage, and to flatter oneself that one has really arrived  at the fourth.    But my friend Sidney Mandragon is, indeed, at the final stage  now, for he had been \"the well-known writer\" for at least a dozen  years previously. Of course, he has been helped by his name.  Shakespeare may say what he likes, but a good name goes a long  way in the writing profession. It was my business at one time to  consider contributions for a certain paper, and there was one  particular contributor whose work I approached with an awe  begotten solely of his name. It was not exactly Milton, and not  exactly Carlyle, and not exactly Charles Lamb, but it was a sort  of mixture of all three and of many other famous names thrown in,  so that, without having seen any of his work printed elsewhere, I  felt that I could not take the risk of refusing it myself. \"This  is a good man,\" I would say before beginning his article; \"this  man obviously has style. And I shouldn't be surprised to hear  that he was an authority on fishing.\" I wish I could remember his  name now, and then you would see for yourself.    Well, take Mr. Hugh Walpole (if he will allow me). It is safe to  say that, when Mr. Walpole's first book came out, the average  reader felt vaguely that she had heard of him before. She hadn't  actually read his famous Letters, but she had often wanted to,  and--or was that his uncle? Anyway, she had often heard people  talking about him. What a very talented family it was! In the  same way Sidney Mandragon has had the great assistance of one of  the two Christian names which carry weight in journalism. The  other, of course, is Harold. If you are Sidney or Harold, the  literary world is before you.    Another hall-mark by which we can tell whether a man has arrived  or not is provided by the interview. If (say) a Lepidopterist is  just beginning his career, nobody bothers about his opinions on  anything. If he is moderately well-known in his profession, the  papers will seek his help whenever his own particular subject  comes up in the day's news. There is a suggestion, perhaps, in  Parliament that butterflies should be muzzled, and \"Our  Representative\" promptly calls upon \"the well-known  Lepidopterist\" to ask what HE thinks about it. But if he be of an  established reputation, then his professional opinion is no  longer sought. What the world is eager for now is to be told his  views on Sunday Games, the Decadence of the Theatre or Bands in  the Parks.    The modern advertising provides a new scale of values. No doubt  Mr. Pelman offers his celebrated hundred guineas' fee equally to  all his victims, but we may be pretty sure that in his business-  like brain he has each one of them nicely labelled, a Gallant  Soldier being good for so much new business, a titled Man of  Letters being good for slightly less; and that real Fame is best  measured by the number of times that one's unbiased views on  Pelmanism (or Tonics or Hair-Restorers) are considered to be  worth reprinting. In this matter my friend Mandragon is doing  nicely. For a suitable fee he is prepared to attribute his  success to anything in reason, and his confession of faith can  count upon a place in every full-page advertisement of the  mixture, and frequently in the odd half-columns. I never quite  understand why a tonic which has tightened up Mandragon's fibres,  or a Mind-Training System which has brought General Blank's  intellect to its present pitch, should be accepted more greedily  by the man-in-the-street than a remedy which has only proved its  value in the case of his undistinguished neighbour, but then I  can never understand quite a number of things. However, that  doesn't matter. All that matters at the moment is that Mr. Sidney  Mandragon has now achieved glory. Probably the papers have  already pigeon-holed his obituary notice. It is a pleasing  thought.          A Problem in Ethics      Life is full of little problems, which arise suddenly and find  one wholly unprepared with a solution. For instance, you travel  down to Wimbledon on the District Railway--first-class, let us  suppose, because it is your birthday. On your arrival you find  that you have lost your ticket. Now, doubtless there is some sort  of recognized business to be gone through which relieves you of  the necessity of paying again. You produce an affidavit of a  terribly affirmative nature, together with your card and a  testimonial from a beneficed member of the Church of England. Or  you conduct a genial correspondence with the traffic manager  which spreads itself over six months. To save yourself this  bother you simply tell the collector that you haven't a ticket  and have come from Charing Cross. Is it necessary to add \"first-  class\"?    Of course one has a strong feeling that one ought to, but I think  a still stronger feeling that one isn't defrauding the railway  company if one doesn't. (I will try not to get so many \"ones\"  into my next sentence.) For you may argue fairly that you  established your right to travel first-class when you stepped  into the carriage with your ticket--and, it may be, had it  examined therein by an inspector. All that you want to do now is  to establish your right to leave the Wimbledon platform for the  purer air of the common. And you can do this perfectly easily  with a third-class ticket.    However, this is a problem which will only arise if you are  careless with your property. But however careful you are, it may  happen to you at any moment that you become suddenly the owner of  a shilling with a hole in it.    I am such an owner. I entered into possession a week ago--Heaven  knows who played the thing off on me. As soon as I made the  discovery I went into a tobacconist's and bought a box of  matches.    \"This,\" he said, looking at me reproachfully, \"is a shilling with  a hole in it.\"    \"I know,\" I said, \"but it's all right, thanks. I don't want to  wear it any longer. The fact is, Joanna has thrown me--However, I  needn't go into that.\" He passed it back to me.    \"I am afraid I can't take it,\" he said.    \"Why not? I managed to.\"    However, I had to give him one without a hole before he would let  me out of his shop. Next time I was more thoughtful. I handed  three to the cashier at my restaurant in payment of lunch, and  the ventilated one was in the middle. He saw the joke of it just  as I was escaping down the stairs.    \"Hi!\" he said, \"this shilling has a hole in it.\"    I went back and looked at it. Sure enough it had.    \"Well, that's funny,\" I said. \"Did you drop it, or what?\"    He handed the keepsake back to me. He also had something of  reproach in his eye.    \"Thanks, very much,\" I said. \"I wouldn't have lost it for worlds;  Emily--But I mustn't bore you with the story. Good day to you.\"  And I gave him a more solid coin and went.    Well, that's how we are at present. A more unscrupulous person  than myself would have palmed it off long ago. He would have told  himself with hateful casuistry that the coin was none the worse  for the air-hole in it, and that, if everybody who came into  possession of it pressed it on to the next man, nobody would be  injured by its circulation. But I cannot argue like this. It  pleases me to give my shilling a run with the others sometimes."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5805"],[0,"The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel (#20)"],[1,"is not often at home. He lives with a  daughter somewhere Passy way, and only uses this place as a workshop. I  am sure he is no traitor.\"    \"We'll soon see about that,\" remarked Rouget dryly.    Petite maman held her shawl tightly crossed over her bosom: her hands  felt clammy and cold as ice. She was looking straight out before her,  quite dry-eyed and calm, and never once glanced on Rosette, who was not  allowed to come anywhere near her mother.    As there was no duplicate key to apartment No. 12, citizen Rouget  ordered his men to break in the door. It did not take very long: the  house was old and ramshackle and the doors rickety. The next moment the  party stood in the room which a while ago the Englishman had so  accurately described to pere Lenegre in petite maman's hearing.    There was the wardrobe. Petite maman, closely surrounded by the  soldiers, went boldly up to it; she opened it just as milor had  directed, and pushed aside the row of shabby clothes that hung there.  Then she pointed to the panels that did not fit quite tightly together  at the back. Petite maman passed her tongue over her dry lips before she  spoke.    \"There's a recess behind those panels,\" she said at last. \"They slide  back quite easily. My old man is there.\"    \"And God bless you for a brave, loyal soul,\" came in merry, ringing  accent from the other end of the room. \"And God save the Scarlet  Pimpernel!\"    These last words, spoken in English, completed the blank amazement which  literally paralysed the only three genuine Republican soldiers  there--those, namely, whom Rouget had borrowed from the sergeant. As for  the others, they knew what to do. In less than a minute they had  overpowered and gagged the three bewildered soldiers.    Rosette had screamed, terror-stricken, from sheer astonishment, but  petite maman stood quite still, her pale, tear-dimmed eyes fixed upon  the man whose gay \"God bless you!\" had so suddenly turned her despair  into hope.    How was it that in the hideous, unkempt and grimy Rouget she had not at  once recognised the handsome and gallant milor who had saved her  Pierre's life? Well, of a truth he had been unrecognisable, but now that  he tore the ugly wig and beard from his face, stretched out his fine  figure to its full height, and presently turned his lazy, merry eyes on  her, she could have screamed for very joy.    The next moment he had her by the shoulders and had imprinted two  sounding kisses upon her cheeks.    \"Now, petite maman,\" he said gaily, \"let us liberate the old man.\"    Pere Lenegre, from his hiding-place, had heard all that had been going  on in the room for the last few moments. True, he had known exactly what  to expect, for no sooner had he taken possession of the recess behind  the wardrobe than milor also entered the apartment and then and there  told him of his plans not only for pere's own safety, but for that of  petite maman and Rosette who would be in grave danger if the old man  followed in the wake of Pierre.    Milor told him in his usual light-hearted way that he had given the  Committee's spies the slip.    \"I do that very easily, you know,\" he explained. \"I just slip into my  rooms in the Rue Jolivet, change myself into a snuffy and hunchback  violin-maker, and walk out of the house under the noses of the spies. In  the nearest wine-shop my English friends, in various disguises, are all  ready to my hand: half a dozen of them are never far from where I am in  case they may be wanted.\"    These half-dozen brave Englishmen soon arrived one by one: one looked  like a coal-heaver, another like a seedy musician, a third like a  coach-driver. But they all walked boldly into the house and were soon  all congregated in apartment No. 12. Here fresh disguises were assumed,  and soon a squad of Republican Guards looked as like the real thing as  possible.    Pere Lenegre admitted himself that though he actually saw milor  transforming himself into citizen Rouget, he could hardly believe his  eyes, so complete was the change.    \"I am deeply grieved to have frightened and upset you so, petite maman,\"  now concluded milor kindly, \"but I saw no other way of getting you and  Rosette out of the house and leaving that stupid sergeant and some of  his men behind. I did not want to arouse in him even the faintest breath  of suspicion, and of course if he had asked me for the written orders  which he was actually waiting for, or if his corporal had returned  sooner than I anticipated, there might have been trouble. But even  then,\" he added with his usual careless insouciance, \"I should have  thought of some way of baffling those brutes.\"    \"And now,\" he concluded more authoritatively, \"it is a case of getting  out of Paris before the gates close. Pere Lenegre, take your wife and  daughter with you and walk boldly out of this house. The sergeant and  his men have not vacated their post in the Rue Jolivet, and no one else  can molest you. Go straight to the Porte de Neuilly, and on the other  side wait quietly in the little cafe at the corner of the Avenue until I  come. Your old passes for the barriers still hold good; you were only  placed on the 'suspect' list this morning, and there has not been a hue  and cry yet about you. In any case some of us will be close by to help  you if needs be.\"    \"But you, milor,\" stammered pere Lenegre, \"and your friends--?\"    \"La, man,\" retorted Blakeney lightly, \"have I not told you before never  to worry about me and my friends? We have more ways than one of giving  the slip to this demmed government of yours. All you've got to think of  is your wife and your daughter. I am afraid that petite maman cannot  take more with her than she has on, but we'll do all we can for her  comfort until we have you all in perfect safety--in England--with  Pierre.\"    Neither pere Lenegre, nor petite maman, nor Rosette could speak just  then, for tears were choking them, but anon when milor stood nearer,  petite maman knelt down, and, imprisoning his slender hand in her brown,  wrinkled ones, she kissed it reverently.    He laughed and chided her for this.    \"'Tis I should kneel to you in gratitude, petite maman,\" he said  earnestly, \"you were ready to sacrifice your old man for me.\"    \"You have saved Pierre, milor,\" said the mother simply.    A minute later pere Lenegre and the two women were ready to go. Already  milor and his gallant English friends were busy once more transforming  themselves into grimy workmen or seedy middle-class professionals.    As soon as the door of apartment No. 12 finally closed behind the three  good folk, my lord Tony asked of his chief:    \"What about these three wretched soldiers, Blakeney?\"    \"Oh! they'll be all right for twenty-four hours. They can't starve till  then, and by that time the concierge will have realised that there's  something wrong with the door of No. 12 and will come in to investigate  the matter. Are they securely bound, though?\"    \"And gagged! Rather!\" ejaculated one of the others. \"Odds life,  Blakeney!\" he added enthusiastically, \"that was a fine bit of work!\"          VI    HOW JEAN PIERRE MET THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL    As told by Himself      I    Ah, monsieur! the pity of it, the pity! Surely there are sins which le  bon Dieu Himself will condone. And if not--well, I had to risk His  displeasure anyhow. Could I see them both starve, monsieur? I ask you!  and M. le Vicomte had become so thin, so thin, his tiny, delicate bones  were almost through his skin. And Mme. la Marquise! an angel, monsieur!  Why, in the happy olden days, before all these traitors and assassins  ruled in France, M. and Mme. la Marquise lived only for the child, and  then to see him dying--yes, dying, there was no shutting one's eyes to  that awful fact--M. le Vicomte de Mortain was dying of starvation and of  disease.    There we were all herded together in a couple of attics--one of which  little more than a cupboard--at the top of a dilapidated half-ruined  house in the Rue des Pipots--Mme. la Marquise, M. le Vicomte and I--just  think of that, monsieur! M. le Marquis had his chateau, as no doubt you  know, on the outskirts of Lyons. A loyal high-born gentleman; was it  likely, I ask you, that he would submit passively to the rule of those  execrable revolutionaries who had murdered their King, outraged their  Queen and Royal family, and, God help them! had already perpetrated  every crime and every abomination for which of a truth there could be no  pardon either on earth or in Heaven? He joined that plucky but, alas!  small and ill-equipped army of royalists who, unable to save their King,  were at least determined to avenge him.    Well, you know well enough what happened. The counter-revolution failed;  the revolutionary army brought Lyons down to her knees after a siege of  two months. She was then marked down as a rebel city, and after the  abominable decree of October 9th had deprived her of her very name, and  Couthon had exacted bloody reprisals from the entire population for its  loyalty to the King, the infamous Laporte was sent down in order finally  to stamp out the lingering remnants of the rebellion. By that time,  monsieur, half the city had been burned down, and one-tenth and more of  the inhabitants--men, women, and children--had been massacred in cold  blood, whilst most of the others had fled in terror from the appalling  scene of ruin and desolation. Laporte completed the execrable work so  ably begun by Couthon. He was a very celebrated and skilful doctor at  the Faculty of Medicine, now turned into a human hyena in the name of  Liberty and Fraternity.    M. le Marquis contrived to escape with the scattered remnant of the  Royalist army into Switzerland. But Mme la Marquise throughout all these  strenuous times had stuck to her post at the chateau like the valiant  creature that she was. When Couthon entered Lyons at the head of the  revolutionary army, the whole of her household fled, and "]]]
