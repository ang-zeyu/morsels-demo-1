Rauzzini is little more than a name now, but for  Haydn's sake it is worth recalling his memory. Born at Rome in 1747,  his striking beauty of face and figure had drawn him into certain  entanglements which made it expedient for him to leave his native land.  He was as fond of animals as Dragonetti was of dolls, and had erected a  memorial tablet in his garden to his \"best friend,\" otherwise his dog.  \"Turk was a faithful dog and not a man,\" ran the inscription, which  reminds one of Schopenhauer's cynical observation that if it were not  for the honest faces of dogs, we should forget the very existence of  sincerity. When Haydn read the inscription he immediately proceeded to  make use of the words for a four-part canon. It was presumably at this  time that he became acquainted with Dr Henry Harington, the musician  and author, who had removed to Bath in 1771, where he had founded the  Harmonic Society. Haydn dedicated one of his songs to him in return for  certain music and verses, which explains the following otherwise cryptic  note of Clementi's, published for the first time recently by Mr J. S.  Shedlock: \"The first Dr [Harington] having bestowed much praise on  the second Dr [Haydn], the said second Dr, out of doctorial gratitude,  returns the 1st Dr thanks for all favours recd., and praises in his  turn the said 1st Dr most handsomely.\" The title of Haydn's song was \"Dr  Harington's Compliments.\"    Opera Concerts    The composer returned to London at the beginning of October for the  winter season's concerts. These began, as before, in February, and were  continued once a week up to the month of May. This time they took the  form of opera concerts, and were given at the \"National School of Music\"  in the new concert-room of the King's Theatre. No fresh symphonies were  contributed by Haydn for this series, though some of the old ones always  found a place in the programmes. Two extra concerts were given on May  21 and June 1, at both of which Haydn appeared; but the composer's last  benefit concert was held on May 4. On this occasion the programme  was entirely confined to his own compositions, with the exception of  concertos by Viotti, the violinist, and Ferlendis, the oboist. Banti  sang the aria already mentioned as having been written expressly for  her, but, according to the composer, \"sang very scanty.\" The main  thing, however, was that the concert proved a financial success, the net  receipts amounting to 400 pounds. \"It is only in England,\" said Haydn,  \"that one can make 4000 gulden in one evening.\"    Haydn did indeed remarkably well in London. As Pohl says, \"he returned  from it with increased powers, unlimited fame, and a competence for  life. By concerts, lessons, and symphonies, not counting his other  compositions, he had again made 1200 pounds, enough to relieve him from  all anxiety as to the future. He often said afterwards that it was not  till he had been to England that he became famous in Germany; by which  he meant that although his reputation was high at home, the English were  the first to give him public homage and liberal remuneration.\"    Kingly Courtesies    It is superfluous to say that Haydn was as much of a \"lion\" in London  society during his second visit as he had been on the previous occasion.  The attention bestowed on him in royal circles made that certain, for  \"society\" are sheep, and royalty is their bell-wether. The Prince  of Wales had rather a fancy for him, and commanded his attendance at  Carlton House no fewer than twenty-six times. At one concert at York  House the programme was entirely devoted to his music. George III and  Queen Caroline were present, and Haydn was presented to the King by the  Prince. \"You have written a great deal, Dr Haydn,\" said the King. \"Yes,  sire,\" was the reply; \"more than is good for me.\" \"Certainly not,\"  rejoined His Majesty. He was then presented to the Queen, and asked to  sing some German songs. \"My voice,\" he said, pointing to the tip of  his little finger, \"is now no bigger than that\"; but he sat down to  the pianoforte and sang his song, \"Ich bin der Verliebteste.\" He was  repeatedly invited by the Queen to Buckingham Palace, and she tried to  persuade him to settle in England. \"You shall have a house at Windsor  during the summer months,\" she said, and then, looking towards the King,  added, \"We can sometimes make music tete-a-tete.\" \"Oh! I am not jealous  of Haydn,\" interposed the King; \"he is a good, honourable German.\" \"To  preserve that reputation,\" replied Haydn, \"is my greatest pride.\"    Most of Haydn's appearances were made at the concerts regularly  organized for the entertainment of royalty at Carlton House and  Buckingham Palace, and Haydn looked to be paid for his services. Whether  the King and the Prince expected him to give these services in return  for the supposed honour they had conferred upon him does not appear.  At all events, Haydn sent in a bill for 100 guineas sometime after his  return to Vienna, and the amount was promptly paid by Parliament.    A Valuable Parrot    Among the other attentions bestowed upon him while in London, mention  should be made of the present of a talking parrot. Haydn took the bird  with him, and it was sold for 140 pounds after his death. Another gift  followed him to Vienna. A Leicester manufacturer named Gardiner--he  wrote a book on The Music of Nature, and other works--sent him half a  dozen pairs of cotton stockings, into which were woven the notes of the  Austrian Hymn, \"My mother bids me bind my hair,\" the Andante from  the \"Surprise\" Symphony, and other thematic material. These musical  stockings, as a wit has observed, must have come as a REAL surprise  to Haydn. It was this same Leicester manufacturer, we may remark  parenthetically, who annotated the translation of Bombet's Life of  Haydn, made by his fellow-townsman, Robert Brewin, in 1817.    Haydn's return from London was hastened by the receipt of a  communication from Esterhaz. Prince Anton had been succeeded by his  son Nicolaus, who was as fond of music as the rest of his family, and  desired to keep his musical establishment up to the old standard. During  the summer of 1794 he had written to Haydn, asking if the composer would  care to retain his appointment as director. Haydn was only too glad to  assent; and now that his London engagements were fulfilled, he saw no  reason for remaining longer in England. Accordingly he started for home  on the 15th of August 1795, travelling by way of Hamburg, Berlin and  Dresden, and arriving at Vienna in the early days of September.    Rohrau Reminiscences    Soon after his return he was surprised to receive an invitation to visit  his native Rohrau. When he arrived there he found that a monument, with  a marble bust of himself, had been erected to his honour in a park near  his birthplace. This interesting memorial consists of a square pillar  surmounting three stone steps, with an inscription on each side. The  visit was productive of mingled feelings to Haydn. He took his friends  to see the old thatch-roofed cottage, and, pointing to the familiar  stove, still in its place, modestly remarked that there his career as a  musician began--a reminiscence of the now far-away time when he sat by  his father's side and sawed away on his improvised fiddle.    Esterhaz once more    There is little to say about Haydn's labours as Capellmeister of the  Esterhazy household at this time. Apparently he was only at Eisenstadt  for the summer and autumn. Down to 1802, however, he always had a mass  ready for Princess Esterhazy's name-day in September. These compositions  are Nos. 2, 1, 3, 16, 4 and 6 of the Novello edition. No. 2, Pohl tells  us, was composed in 1796, and called the \"Paukenmesse,\" from the fact  of the drums being used in the Agnus. No. 3 was written in 1797. It  is known in England as the Imperial Mass, but in Germany as \"Die  Nelsonmesse,\" on account of its having been performed during Nelson's  visit to Eisenstadt in 1800. On that occasion Nelson asked Haydn for his  pen, and gave him his own gold watch in exchange.    The Austrian Hymn    It was shortly after his return to Vienna--in January 1797, to be  precise--that he composed his favourite air, \"God preserve the Emperor,\"  better known as the Austrian Hymn. The story of this celebrated  composition is worth telling with some minuteness. Its inception was  due to Count von Saurau, Imperial High Chancellor and Minister of the  Interior. Writing in 1820, the count said:    I often regretted that we had not, like the English, a national air  calculated to display to all the world the loyal devotion of our people  to the kind and upright ruler of our Fatherland, and to awaken  within the hearts of all good Austrians that noble national pride  so indispensable to the energetic fulfillment of all the beneficial  measures of the sovereign. This seemed to me more urgent at a period  when the French Revolution was raging most furiously, and when the  Jacobins cherished the idle hope of finding among the worthy Viennese  partisans and participators in their criminal designs. [The scandalous  Jacobin persecutions and executions in Austria and Hungary took place  in 1796]. I caused that meritorious poet Haschka to write the words,  and applied to our immortal countryman Haydn to set them to music, for I  considered him alone capable of writing anything approaching in merit  to the English \"God save the King.\" Such was the origin of our national  hymn.    It would not have been difficult to match \"God save the King,\" the  mediocrity of which, especially as regards the words, has been the butt  of countless satirists. Beethoven wrote in his diary that he \"must show  the English what a blessing they have\" in that \"national disgrace.\" If  Haydn regarded"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37904"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 4, No. 4, November 1, 1851 (#20)"],[1,"tion. The       government, I should add, sent a company of sappers and       miners to assist the afflicted _nine days after the       earthquake_!--and a medical commission is to set off       to-morrow. In conclusion, I may observe, that Vesuvius       has for a long time been singularly quiet. The shock of       the earthquake was felt slightly, though sensibly, from       Naples round to Sorrento. I have just heard that the       shocks have not ceased in the district of Malfi; and it       is supposed that volcanic agency is still active.       Indeed, my informant anticipates that an eruption will       take place; and probably some extraordinary phenomena       may appear in this neighborhood. The volcanic action       appears to have taken the direction of Sicily, as       reports have arrived stating that the shocks were felt       in that direction far more strongly than in that of       Naples. I shall send you further particulars as soon as       I can do so with certainty.\"          MR. JEFFERSON ON THE STUDY OF THE ANGLO-SAXON LANGUAGE.      The trustees of the University of Virginia have had printed a few copies of  _An Essay towards facilitating Instruction in the Anglo-Saxon and Modern  Dialects of the English Language_: _By_ THOMAS JEFFERSON. The MS. has been  preserved in the library of their University ever since Mr. Jefferson's  death. It is a very characteristic production, and is printed in a thin  quarto volume, prefaced by the following letter from Mr. Jefferson to  Herbert Croft, LL.B., of London:                                  MONTICELLO, _Oct. 30th, 1798_.         Sir; The copy of your printed letter on the English and       German languages, which you have been so kind as to       send me, has come to hand; and I pray you to accept of       my thanks for this mark of your attention. I have       perused it with singular pleasure, and, having long       been sensible of the importance of a knowledge of the       Northern languages to the understanding of English, I       see it, in this letter, proved and specifically       exemplified by your collations of the English and       German. I shall look with impatience for the       publication of your \"English and German Dictionary.\"       Johnson, besides the want of precision in his       definitions, and of accurate distinction in passing       from one shade of meaning to another of the same word,       is most objectionable in his derivations. From a want       probably of intimacy with our own language while in the       Anglo-Saxon form and type, and of its kindred languages       of the North, he has a constant leaning towards Greek       and Latin for English etymon. Even Skinner has a little       of this, who, when he has given the true Northern       parentage of a word, often tells you from what Greek       and Latin source it might be derived by those who have       that kind of partiality. He is, however, on the whole,       our best etymologist, unless we ascend a step higher to       the Anglo-Saxon vocabulary; and he has set the good       example of collating the English word with its kindred       word in the several Northern dialects, which often       assist in ascertaining its true meaning.         Your idea is an excellent one, in producing authorities       for the meanings of words, \"to select the prominent       passages in our best writers, to make your dictionary a       general index to English literature, and thus to       intersperse with verdure and flowers the barren deserts       of Philology.\" And I believe with you that \"wisdom,       morality, religion, thus thrown down, as if without       intention, before the reader, in quotations, may often       produce more effect than the very passages in the books       themselves;\"--\"that the cowardly suicide, in search of       a strong word for his dying letter, might light on a       passage which would excite him to blush at his want of       fortitude, and to forego his purpose;\"--\"and that a       dictionary with examples at the words may, in regard to       every branch of knowledge, produce more real effect       than the whole collection of books which it quotes.\" I       have sometimes myself used Johnson as a Repertory, to       find favorite passages which I wished to recollect, but       too rarely with success.         I was led to set a due value on the study of the       Northern languages, and especially of our Anglo-Saxon,       while I was a student of the law, by being obliged to       recur to that source for explanation of a multitude of       law-terms. A preface to Fortescue on Monarchies,       written by Fortescue Aland, and afterwards premised to       his volume of Reports, developes the advantages to be       derived to the English student generally, and       particularly the student of law, from an acquaintance       with the Anglo-Saxon; and mentions the books to which       the learner may have recourse for acquiring the       language. I accordingly devoted some time to its study,       but my busy life has not permitted me to indulge in a       pursuit to which I felt great attraction. While engaged       in it, however, some ideas occurred for facilitating       the study by simplifying its grammar, by reducing the       infinite diversities of its unfixed orthography to       single and settled forms, indicating at the same time       the pronunciation of the word by its correspondence       with the characters and powers of the English alphabet.       Some of these ideas I noted at the time on the blank       leaves of my Elstob's Anglo-Saxon Grammar: but there I       have left them, and must leave them, unpursued,       although I still think them sound and useful. Among the       works which I proposed for the Anglo-Saxon student, you       will find such literal and verbal translations of the       Anglo-Saxon writers recommended, as you have given us       of the German in your printed letter. Thinking that I       cannot submit those ideas to a better judge than       yourself, and that if you find them of any value you       may put them to some use, either as hints in your       dictionary, or in some other way, I will copy them as a       sequel to this letter, and commit them without reserve       to your better knowledge of the subject. Adding my       sincere wishes for the speedy publication of your       valuable dictionary, I tender you the assurance of my       high respect and consideration.                                  THOMAS JEFFERSON.\"    Of the Essay itself we have room for only the initial paragraph, which is  as follows:         \"The importance of the Anglo-Saxon dialect towards a       perfect understanding of the English language seems not       to have been duly estimated by those charged with the       education of youth; and yet it is unquestionably the       basis of our present tongue. It was a full-formed       language; its frame and construction, its declension of       nouns and verbs, and its syntax were peculiar to the       Northern languages, and fundamentally different from       those of the South. It was the language of all England,       properly so called, from the Saxon possession of that       country in the sixth century to the time of Henry III.       in the thirteenth, and was spoken pure and unmixed with       any other. Although the Romans had been in possession       of that country for nearly five centuries from the time       of Julius Caesar, yet it was a military possession       chiefly, by their soldiery alone, and with dispositions       intermutually jealous and unamicable. They seemed to       have aimed at no lasting settlements there, and to have       had little familiar mixture with the native Britons. In       this state of connection there would probably be little       incorporation of the Roman into the native language,       and on their subsequent evacuation of the island its       traces would soon be lost altogether. And had it been       otherwise, these innovations would have been carried       with the natives themselves when driven into Wales by       the invasion and entire occupation of the rest of the       Southern portion of the island by the Anglo-Saxons. The       language of these last became that of the country from       that time forth, for nearly seven centuries; and so       little attention was paid among them to the Latin, that       it was known to a few individuals only as a matter of       science, and without any chance of transfusion into the       vulgar language. We may safely repeat the affirmation,       therefore, that the pure Anglo-Saxon constitutes at       this day the basis of our language. That it was       sufficiently copious for the purposes of society in the       existing condition of arts and manners, reason alone       would satisfy us from the necessity of the case. Its       copiousness, too, was much favored by the latitude it       allowed of combining primitive words so as to produce       any modification of idea desired. In this       characteristic it was equal to the Greek, but it is       more specially proved by the actual fact of the books       they have left us in the various branches of history,       geography, religion, law, and poetry. And although       since the Norman conquest it has received vast       additions and embellishments from the Latin, Greek,       French, and Italian languages, yet these are but       engraftments on its idiomatic stem; its original       structure and syntax remain the same, and can be but       imperfectly understood by the mere Latin scholar. Hence       the necessity of making the Anglo-Saxon a regular       branch of academic education. In the sixteenth and       seventeenth centuries it was assiduously cultivated by       a host of learned men.
