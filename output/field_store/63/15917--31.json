Had he  said that the artery transmits spirits and not blood, he would  indeed sufficiently have answered Erasistratus, who imagined that  the arteries contained nothing but spirits; but then he would  have contradicted himself, and given a foul denial to that for  which he had keenly contended in his writings against this very  Erasistratus, to wit, that blood in substance is contained in the  arteries, and not spirits; a fact which he demonstrated not only  by many powerful arguments, but by experiments.    But if the divine Galen will here allow, as in other places he  does, \"that all the arteries of the body arise from the great  artery, and that this takes its origin from the heart; that all  these vessels naturally contain and carry blood; that the three  semilunar valves situated at the orifice of the aorta prevent the  return of the blood into the heart, and that nature never  connected them with this, the most noble viscus of the body,  unless for some important end\"; if, I say, this father of  physicians concedes all these things,--and I quote his own  words,--I do not see how he can deny that the great artery is the  very vessel to carry the blood, when it has attained its highest  term for term of perfection, from the heart for distribution to  all parts of the body. Or would he perchance still hesitate, like  all who have come after him, even to the present hour, because he  did not perceive the route by which the blood was transferred  from the veins to the arteries, in consequence, as I have already  said, of the intimate connexion between the heart and the lungs?  And that this difficulty puzzled anatomists not a little, when in  their dissections they found the pulmonary artery and left  ventricle full of thick, black, and clotted blood, plainly  appears, when they felt themselves compelled to affirm that the  blood made its way from the right to the left ventricle by  transuding through the septum of the heart. But this fancy I  have already refuted. A new pathway for the blood must therefore  be prepared and thrown open, and being once exposed, no further  difficulty will, I believe, be experienced by anyone in admitting  what I have already proposed in regard to the pulse of the heart  and arteries, viz., the passage of the blood from the veins to  the arteries, and its distribution to the whole of the body by  means of these vessels.          CHAPTER VI    OF THE COURSE BY WHICH THE BLOOD IS CARRIED FROM THE VENA CAVA  INTO THE ARTERIES, OR FROM THE RIGHT INTO THE LEFT VENTRICLE OF  THE HEART      Since the intimate connexion of the heart with the lungs, which  is apparent in the human subject, has been the probable cause of  the errors that have been committed on this point, they plainly  do amiss who, pretending to speak of the parts of animals  generally, as anatomists for the most part do, confine their  researches to the human body alone, and that when it is dead.  They obviously do not act otherwise than he who, having studied  the forms of a single commonwealth, should set about the  composition of a general system of polity; or who, having taken  cognizance of the nature of a single field, should imagine that  he had mastered the science of agriculture; or who, upon the  ground of one particular proposition, should proceed to draw  general conclusions.    Had anatomists only been as conversant with the dissection of the  lower animals as they are with that of the human body, the  matters that have hitherto kept them in a perplexity of doubt  would, in my opinion, have met them freed from every kind of  difficulty.    And first, in fishes, in which the heart consists of but a single  ventricle, being devoid of lungs, the thing is sufficiently  manifest. Here the sac, which is situated at the base of the  heart, and is the part analogous to the auricle in man, plainly  forces the blood into the heart, and the heart, in its turn,  conspicuously transmits it by a pipe or artery, or vessel  analogous to an artery; these are facts which are confirmed by  simple ocular inspection, as well as by a division of the vessel,  when the blood is seen to be projected by each pulsation of the  heart.    The same thing is also not difficult of demonstration in those  animals that have, as it were, no more than a single ventricle to  the heart, such as toads, frogs, serpents, and lizards, which  have lungs in a certain sense, as they have a voice. I have many  observations by me on the admirable structure of the lungs of  these animals, and matters appertaining, which, however, I cannot  introduce in this place. Their anatomy plainly shows us that the  blood is transferred in them from the veins to the arteries in  the same manner as in higher animals, viz., by the action of the  heart; the way, in fact, is patent, open, manifest; there is no  difficulty, no room for doubt about it; for in them the matter  stands precisely as it would in man were the septum of his heart  perforated or removed, or one ventricle made out of two; and this  being the case, I imagine that no one will doubt as to the way by  which the blood may pass from the veins into the arteries.    But as there are actually more animals which have no lungs than  there are furnished with them, and in like manner a greater  number which have only one ventricle than there are with two, it  is open to us to conclude, judging from the mass or multitude of  living creatures, that for the major part, and generally, there  is an open way by which the blood is transmitted from the veins  through the sinuses or cavities of the heart into the arteries.    I have, however, cogitating with myself, seen further, that the  same thing obtained most obviously in the embryos of those  animals that have lungs; for in the foetus the four vessels  belonging to the heart, viz., the vena cava, the pulmonary  artery, the pulmonary vein, and the great artery or aorta, are  all connected otherwise than in the adult, a fact sufficiently  known to every anatomist. The first contact and union of the vena  cava with the pulmonary veins, which occurs before the cava opens  properly into the right ventricle of the heart, or gives off the  coronary vein, a little above its escape from the liver, is by a  lateral anastomosis; this is an ample foramen, of an oval form,  communicating between the cava and the pulmonary vein, so that  the blood is free to flow in the greatest abundance by that  foramen from the vena cava into the pulmonary vein, and left  auricle, and from thence into the left ventricle. Further, in  this foramen ovale, from that part which regards the pulmonary  vein, there is a thin tough membrane, larger than the opening,  extended like an operculum or cover; this membrane in the adult  blocking up the foramen, and adhering on all sides, finally  closes it up, and almost obliterates every trace of it. In the  foetus, however, this membrane is so contrived that falling  loosely upon itself, it permits a ready access to the lungs and  heart, yielding a passage to the blood which is streaming from  the cava, and hindering the tide at the same time from flowing  back into that vein. All things, in short, permit us to believe  that in the embryo the blood must constantly pass by this foramen  from the vena cava into the pulmonary vein, and from thence into  the left auricle of the heart; and having once entered there, it  can never regurgitate.    Another union is that by the pulmonary artery, and is effected  when that vessel divides into two branches after its escape from  the right ventricle of the heart. It is as if to the two trunks  already mentioned a third were superadded, a kind of arterial  canal, carried obliquely from the pulmonary artery, to perforate  and terminate in the great artery or aorta. So that in the  dissection of the embryo, as it were, two aortas, or two roots of  the great artery, appear springing from the heart. This canal  shrinks gradually after birth, and after a time becomes withered,  and finally almost removed, like the umbilical vessels.    The arterial canal contains no membrane or valve to direct or  impede the flow of blood in this or in that direction: for at the  root of the pulmonary artery, of which the arterial canal is the  continuation in the foetus, there are three semilunar valves,  which open from within outwards, and oppose no obstacle to the  blood flowing in this direction or from the right ventricle into  the pulmonary artery and aorta; but they prevent all  regurgitation from the aorta or pulmonic vessels back upon the  right ventricle; closing with perfect accuracy, they oppose an  effectual obstacle to everything of the kind in the embryo. So  that there is also reason to believe that when the heart  contracts, the blood is regularly propelled by the canal or  passage indicated from the right ventricle into the aorta.    What is commonly said in regard to these two great  communications, to wit, that they exist for the nutrition of the  lungs, is both improbable and inconsistent; seeing that in the  adult they are closed up, abolished, and consolidated, although  the lungs, by reason of their heat and motion, must then be  presumed to require a larger supply of nourishment. The same may  be said in regard to the assertion that the heart in the embryo  does not pulsate, that it neither acts nor moves, so that nature  was forced to make these communications for the nutrition of the  lungs. This is plainly false; for simple inspection of the  incubated egg, and of embryos just taken out of the uterus, shows  that the heart moves in them precisely as in adults, and that  nature feels no such necessity.

Poor girl! She came to a dreadful end. Mr. Nicholson,  here, identified her at Bow Street to-night.\"    Now the whole amazing truth burst upon me.    \"I understand!\" I cried. \"This\"--and I snatched up the pigtail--    \"That my pigtail,\" moaned Hi Wing Ho feebly.    Mr. Nicholson pitched him unceremoniously into a corner of the room, and  taking the pigtail in his huge hand, clumsily unfastened it. Out from  the thick part, some two inches below the point at which it had been cut  from the Chinaman's head, a great diamond dropped upon the floor!    For perhaps twenty seconds there was perfect silence in my study. No one  stooped to pick the diamond from the floor--the diamond which now had  blood upon it. No one, so far as my sense informed me, stirred. But  when, following those moments of stupefaction, we all looked up--Hi Wing  Ho, like a phantom, had faded from the room!              THE HOUSE OF GOLDEN JOSS            I    THE BLOOD-STAINED IDOL      \"Stop when we pass the next lamp and give me a light for my pipe.\"    \"Why?\"    \"No! don't look round,\" warned my companion. \"I think someone is  following us. And it is always advisable to be on guard in this  neighbourhood.\"    We had nearly reached the house in Wade Street, Limehouse, which my  friend used as a base for East End operations. The night was dark but  clear, and I thought that presently when dawn came it would bring a  cold, bright morning. There was no moon, and as we passed the lamp and  paused we stood in almost total darkness.    Facing in the direction of the Council School I struck a match. It  revealed my ruffianly looking companion--in whom his nearest friends  must have failed to recognize Mr. Paul Harley of Chancery Lane.    He was glancing furtively back along the street, and when a moment later  we moved on, I too, had detected the presence of a figure stumbling  toward us.    \"Don't stop at the door,\" whispered Harley, for our follower was only a  few yards away.    Accordingly we passed the house in which Harley had rooms, and had  proceeded some fifteen paces farther when the man who was following us  stumbled in between Harley and myself, clutching an arm of either. I  scarcely knew what to expect, but was prepared for anything, when:    \"Mates!\" said a man huskily. \"Mates, if you know where I can get a  drink, take me there!\"    Harley laughed shortly. I cannot say if he remained suspicious of the  newcomer, but for my own part I had determined after one glance at  the man that he was merely a drunken fireman newly recovered from a  prolonged debauch.    \"Where 'ave yer been, old son?\" growled Harley, in that wonderful  dialect of his which I had so often and so vainly sought to cultivate.  \"You look as though you'd 'ad one too many already.\"    \"I ain't,\" declared the fireman, who appeared to be in a semi-dazed  condition. \"I ain't 'ad one since ten o'clock last night. It's dope  wot's got me, not rum.\"    \"Dope!\" said Harley sharply; \"been 'avin' a pipe, eh?\"    \"If you've got a corpse-reviver anywhere,\" continued the man in that  curious, husky voice, \"'ave pity on me, mate. I seen a thing to-night  wot give me the jim-jams.\"    \"All right, old son,\" said my friend good-humouredly; \"about turn! I've  got a drop in the bottle, but me an' my mate sails to-morrow, an' it's  the last.\"    \"Gawd bless yer!\" growled the fireman; and the three of us--an odd trio,  truly--turned about, retracing our steps.    As we approached the street lamp and its light shone upon the haggard  face of the man walking between us, Harley stopped, and:    \"Wot's up with yer eye?\" he inquired.    He suddenly tilted the man's head upward and peered closely into one of  his eyes. I suppressed a gasp of surprise for I instantly recognized the  fireman of the Jupiter!    \"Nothin' up with it, is there?\" said the fireman.    \"Only a lump o' mud,\" growled Harley, and with a very dirty handkerchief  he pretended to remove the imaginary stain, and then, turning to me:    \"Open the door, Jim,\" he directed.    His examination of the man's eyes had evidently satisfied him that our  acquaintance had really been smoking opium.    We paused immediately outside the house for which we had been bound, and  as I had the key I opened the door and the three of us stepped into a  little dark room. Harley closed the door and we stumbled upstairs to a  low first-floor apartment facing the street. There was nothing in its  appointments, as revealed in the light of an oil lamp burning on the  solitary table, to distinguish it from a thousand other such apartments  which may be leased for a few shillings a week in the neighbourhood.  That adjoining might have told a different story, for it more closely  resembled an actor's dressing-room than a seaman's lodging; but the door  of this sanctum was kept scrupulously locked.    \"Sit down, old son,\" said my friend heartily, pushing forward an old  arm-chair. \"Fetch out the grog, Jim; there's about enough for three.\"    I walked to a cupboard, as the fireman sank limply down in the chair,  and took out a bottle and three glasses. When the man, who, as I could  now see quite plainly, was suffering from the after effects of opium,  had eagerly gulped the stiff drink which I handed to him, he looked  around with dim, glazed eyes, and:    \"You've saved my life, mates,\" he declared. \"I've 'ad a 'orrible  nightmare, I 'ave--a nightmare. See?\"    He fixed his eyes on me for a moment, then raised himself from his seat,  peering narrowly at me across the table.    \"I seed you before, mate. Gaw, blimey! if you ain't the bloke wot  I giv'd the pigtail to! And wot laid out that blasted Chink as was  scraggin' me! Shake, mate!\"    I shook hands with him, Harley eyeing me closely the while, in a  manner which told me that his quick brain had already supplied the link  connecting our doped acquaintance with my strange experience during his  absence. At the same time it occurred to me that my fireman friend  did not know that Ah Fu was dead, or he would never have broached the  subject so openly.    \"That's so,\" I said, and wondered if he required further information.    \"It's all right, mate. I don't want to 'ear no more about blinking  pigtails--not all my life I don't,\" and he sat back heavily in his chair  and stared at Harley.    \"Where have you been?\" inquired Harley, as if no interruption had  occurred, and then began to reload his pipe: \"at Malay Jack's or at  Number Fourteen?\"    \"Neither of 'em!\" cried the fireman, some evidence of animation  appearing in his face; \"I been at Kwen Lung's.\"    \"In Pennyfields?\"    \"That's 'im, the old bloke with the big joss. I allers goes to see Ma  Lorenzo when I'm in Port o' London. I've seen 'er for the last time,  mates.\"    He banged a big and dirty hand upon the table.    \"Last night I see murder done, an' only that I know they wouldn't  believe me, I'd walk across to Limehouse P'lice Station presently and  put the splits on 'em, I would.\"    Harley, who was seated behind the speaker, glanced at me significantly.    \"Sure you wasn't dreamin'?\" he inquired facetiously.    \"Dreamin'!\" cried the man. \"Dreams don't leave no blood be'ind, do  they?\"    \"Blood!\" I exclaimed.    \"That's wot I said--blood! When I woke up this mornin' there was blood  all on that grinnin' joss--the blood wot 'ad dripped from 'er shoulders  when she fell.\"    \"Eh!\" said Harley. \"Blood on whose shoulders? Wot the 'ell are you  talkin' about, old son?\"    \"Ere\"--the fireman turned in his chair and grasped Harley by the  arm--\"listen to me, and I'll tell you somethink, I will. I'm goin' in  the Seahawk in the mornin' see? But if you want to know somethink, I'll  tell yer. Drunk or sober I bars the blasted p'lice, but if you like  to tell 'em I'll put you on somethink worth tellin'. Sure the bottle's  empty, mates?\"    I caught Harley's glance and divided the remainder of the whisky evenly  between the three glasses.    \"Good 'ealth,\" said the fireman, and disposed of his share at a draught.  \"That's bucked me up wonderful.\"    He lay back in his chair and from a little tobacco-box began to fill a  short clay pipe.    \"Look 'ere, mates, I'm soberin' up, like, after the smoke, an' I can  see, I can see plain, as nobody'll ever believe me. Nobody ever does,  worse luck, but 'ere goes. Pass the matches.\"    He lighted his pipe, and looking about him in a sort of vaguely  aggressive way:    \"Last night,\" he resumed, \"after I was chucked out of the Dock Gates, I  made up my mind to go and smoke a pipe with old Ma Lorenzo. Round I goes  to Pennyfields, and she don't seem glad to see me. There's nobody  there only me. Not like the old days when you 'ad to book your seat in  advance.\"    He laughed gruffly.    \"She didn't want to let me in at first, said they was watched, that if  a Chink 'ad an old pipe wot 'ad b'longed to 'is grandfather it was good  enough to get 'im fined fifty quid. Anyway, me bein' an old friend she  spread a mat for me and filled me a pipe. I asked after old Kwen Lung,  but, of course, 'e was out gamblin', as usual; so after old Ma Lorenzo  'ad made me comfortable an' gone out I 'ad the place to myself, and  presently I dozed off and forgot all about bloody ship's bunkers an'  nigger-drivin' Scotchmen.\"    He paused and looked about him defiantly.    \"I dunno 'ow long I slept,\" he continued, \"but some time in the night I  kind of 'alf woke up.\"    At that he twisted violently in his chair and glared across at Harley:    \"You been a pal to me,\" he said; \"but tell me I was dreamin' again and  I'll smash yer bloody face!\"    He glared for a while, then addressing his narrative more particularly  to me, he resumed:    \"It was a scream wot woke me--a woman's scream. I didn't sit up; I  couldn't. I never felt like it before. It was the same as bein' buried  alive, I should think. I could see an' I could 'ea"]]]
