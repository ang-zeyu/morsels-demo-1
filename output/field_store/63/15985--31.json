CHAPTER VIII.    MIMICRY AND WARNING COLOURS IN GRASSHOPPERS.      There is in La Plata a large handsome grasshopper (Zoniopoda tarsata),  the habits of which in its larva and imago stages are in strange  contrast, like those in certain lepidoptera, in which the caterpillars  form societies and act in concert. The adult has a greenish protective  colouring, brown and green banded thighs, bright red hind wings, seen  only during flight. It is solitary and excessively shy in its habits,  living always in concealment among the dense foliage near the surface of  the ground. The yonng are intensely black, like grasshoppers cut out of  jet or ebony, and gregarious in habit, living in bands of forty or fifty  to three or four hundred; and so little shy, that they may sometimes be  taken up by handfuls before they begin to scatter in alarm. Their  gregarious habits and blackness--of all hues in nature the most obvious  to the sight--would alone be enough to make them the most conspicuous of  insects; but they have still other habits which appear as if specially  designed to bring them more prominently into notice. Thus, they all keep  so close together at all times as to have their bodies actually  touching, and when travelling, move so slowly that the laziest snail  might easily overtake and pass one of their bands, and even disappear  beyond their limited horizon in a very short time.    They often select an exposed weed to feed on, clustering together on its  summit above the surrounding verdure, an exceedingly conspicuous object  to every eye in the neighbourhood. They also frequently change their  feeding-ground; at such times they deliberately cross wide roads and  other open spaces, barren of grass, where, moving so slowly that they  scarcely seem to move at all, they look at a distance like a piece of  black velvet lying on the ground. Thus in every imaginable way they  expose themselves and invite attack; yet, in spite of it all, I have  never detected birds preying on them, and I have sometimes kept one of  these black societies under observation near my house for several days,  watching them at intervals, in places where the trees overhead were the  resort of Icterine and tyrant birds, Guira cuckoos, and other species,  all great hunters after grasshoppers. A young grasshopper is, moreover,  a morsel that seldom comes amiss to any bird, whether insect or seed  eater; and, as a rule, it is extremely shy, nimble, and inconspicuous.  It seems clear that, although the young Zoniopoda does not mimic in its  form any black protected insect, it nevertheless owes its safety to its  blackness, together with the habit it possesses of exposing itself in so  open and bold a manner. Blackness is so common in large protected  insects, as, for instance, in the un-palatable leaf-cutting ants,  scorpions, mygale spiders, wasps, and other dangerous kinds, that it is  manifestly a \"warning colour,\" the most universal and best known in  nature; and the grasshopper, I believe, furthermore mimics the fearless  demeanour of the protected or venomous species, which birds and other  insect-eaters know and respect. It might be supposed that the young  Zoniopoda is itself unpalatable; but this is scarcely probable, for when  the deceptive black mask is once dropped, the excessive shyness, love of  concealment, and protective colouring of the insect show that it is much  sought after by birds.    While setting this down as an undoubted case of \"mimicry,\" although it  differs in some respects from all other cases I have seen reported, I  cannot help remarking that this most useful word appears to be in some  danger of losing the meaning originally attached to it in zoology. There  are now very few cases of an accidental resemblance found between two  species in nature which are not set down by someone to \"mimicry,\" some  in which even the wildest imagination might well fail to see any  possible benefit to the supposed mimic. In cases where the outward  resemblance of some feeble animal to a widely different and  well-protected species, or to some object like a leaf or stick, and  where such resemblance is manifestly advantageous and has reacted on and  modified the life habits, it is conceivable that slight spontaneous  variations in the structure and colouring of the unprotected species  have been taken advantage of by the principle of natural selection, and  a case of \"mimicry\" set up, to become more and more perfect in time, as  successive casual variations in the same direction increased the  resemblance.    The stick-insect is perhaps the most perfect example where resemblance  to an inanimate object has been the result aimed at, so to speak, by  nature; the resemblance of the volucella fly to the humble-bee, on which  it is parasitical, is the most familiar example of one species growing  like another to its own advantage, since only by means of its deceptive  likeness to the humble-bee is it able to penetrate into the nest with  impunity. These two cases, with others of a similar character, were  first called cases of \"mimicry\" by Kirby and Spence, in their  ever-delightful _Introduction to Entomology--_an old book, but,  curiously enough in these days of popular treatises on all matters of  the kind, still the only general work on insects in the English language  which one who is not an entomologist can read with pleasure.    A second case of mimicry not yet noticed by any naturalist is seen in  another grasshopper, also common in La Plata (Rhomalea speciosa of  Thun-berg). This is an extremely elegant insect; the head and thorax  chocolate, with cream-coloured markings; the abdomen steel-blue or  purple, a colour I have not seen in any other insects of this family.  The fore wings have a protective colouring; the hind wings are bright  red. When at rest, with the red and purple tints concealed, it is only a  very pretty grasshopper, but the instant it takes wing it becomes the  fac-simile of a very common wasp of the genus Pepris. These wasps vary  greatly in size, some being as large as the hornet; they are solitary,  and feed on the honey of flowers and on fruit, and, besides being  furnished with stings like other wasps--though their sting is nok so  venomous as in other genera--they also, when angry, emit a most  abominable odour, and are thus doubly protected against their enemies.  Their excessive tameness, slow flight, and indolent motions serve to  show that they are not accustomed to be interfered with. All these  strong-smelling wasps have steel-blue or purple bodies, and bright red  wings. So exactly does the Rhomalea grasshopper mimic the Pepris when  flying, that I have been deceived scores of times. I have even seen it  on the leaves, and, after it has flown and settled once more, I have  gone to look at it again, to make sure that my eyes had not deceived me.  It is curious to see how this resemblance has reacted on and modified  the habits of the grasshopper. It is a great flyer, and far more aerial  in its habits than any other insect I am acquainted with in this family,  living always in trees, instead of on or near the surface of the ground.  It is abundant in orchards and plantations round Buenos Ayres, where its  long and peculiarly soft, breezy note may be heard all summer. If the  ancient Athenians possessed so charming an insect as this, their great  regard for the grasshopper was not strange: I only wish that the  \"Athenians of South America,\" as my fellow-townsmen sometimes call  themselves in moments of exaltation, had a feeling of the samo kind--the  regard which does _not_ impale its object on a pin--for the pretty  light-hearted songster of their groves and gardens.    When taken in the hand, it has the habit, common to most grasshoppers,  of pouring out an inky fluid from its mouth; only the discharge is  unusually copious in this species. It has another habit in defending  itself which is very curious. When captured it instantly curls its body  round, as a wasp does to sting. The suddenness of this action has more  than once caused me to drop an insect I had taken, actually thinking for  the moment that I had taken hold of a wasp. Whether birds would be  deceived and made to drop it or not is a question it would not be easy  to settle; but the instinct certainly looks like 'one of a series of  small adaptations, all tending to make the resemblance to a wasp more  complete and effective.            CHAPTER IX.    DRAGON-FLY STORMS.      One of the most curious things I have encountered in my observations on  animal life relates to a habit of the larger species of dragon-flies  inhabiting the Pampas and Patagonia. Dragon-flies are abundant  throughout the country wherever there is water. There are several  species, all more or less brilliantly coloured. The kinds that excited  my wonder, from their habits, are twice as large as the common widely  distributed insects, being three inches to four inches in length, and as  a rule they are sober-coloured, although there is one species--the  largest among them--entirely of a brilliant scarlet. This kind is,  however, exceedingly rare. All the different kinds (of the large  dragon-flies) when travelling associate together, and occasionally, in a  flight composed of countless thousands, one of these brilliant-hued  individuals will catch the eye, appearing as conspicuous among the  others as a poppy or scarlet geranium growing alone in an otherwise  flowerless field. The most common species--and in some cases the entire  flight seems to be composed of this kind only--is the Aeschna  bonariensis Raml, the prevailing colour of which is pale blue.

Peron et Flinders sont morts; l'un et l'autre ont des  titres certains a notre estime, a notre admiration; ils vivront, ainsi  que leurs travaux, dans la memoire des hommes, et les nuages que je  cherche a dissiper auront disparu sans retour\" (volume 1 Preface page  11). One cannot but be touched by that appeal; but at the same time it is  to be observed that in the very preface in which he made it, Freycinet  did far less than justice to the work of Flinders.) Except for the Port  Phillip part of the work, we might fairly say that history has commonly  done him and his confreres a serious injustice.    But we have seen that, although Port Phillip was included in the French  charts, and inside soundings were actually shown, neither the port nor  the entrance was seen by the expedition. How was that information  obtained?    Le Geographe and Le Naturaliste lay in Sydney harbour from June 20 to  November 18, 1802, their afflicted crews receiving medical treatment, and  their officers enjoying the hospitality of Governor King. Flinders and  Lieutenant John Murray, who discovered Port Phillip, were both there  during part of the same time. It was then that the French learnt of the  existence of the great harbour of which Baudin was ignorant when he met  Flinders in Encounter Bay; and it is highly probable that by some means  they obtained a copy of the chart which they saw.    Grounds for stating that that is a probability will be advanced a little  later. But let us first see how the drawing of Port Phillip that does  appear on the Terre Napoleon charts got there.    It was taken, as Freycinet acknowledged,* (* Voyage de Decouvertes 3  430.) \"from a manuscript chart prepared on the English ship Armiston, in  1804. In 1806 the French frigate La Piedmontoise captured the British  ship Fame. Amongst the papers found on board was this manuscript chart.  It so happened that one of the officers of La Piedmontoise was Lieutenant  Charles Baudin des Ardennes, who had been a junior officer on Le  Naturaliste from 1800 to 1804. (He was no relative of Captain Baudin. The  family of Baudin des Ardennes was very well known in France; and this  officer became a distinguished French admiral.) He took possession of the  manuscript, and handed it over to Freycinet, who made use of it in  preparing his charts.    Probably it was a very rough chart; but even so, if Freycinet had had  anything like a drawing of Port Phillip made on Le Geographe, he would  have turned out a better piece of work. Not only is the outline very  defective, but the \"lay\" of the Nepean peninsula is so grossly wrong that  this alone would suffice to show that Freycinet did not merely correct  his chart with the aid of that captured from the Fame, but that the whole  drawing of Port Phillip was fitted in, like a patch. However ill a  navigator may draw, he always knows whether a coast along which he is  sailing runs west or north-west. A mariner's apprentice would know that.  But on the Terre Napoleon charts, the peninsula lies due east and west,  whereas in reality, as the reader will see by reference to any good map,  it has a decidedly north-westerly inclination. The patch was not well put  on. The consequence of this bad cobbling was to give a box-like,  rectangular appearance to the bay, utterly unlike the reality. The east  and west sides were carried about as far as Mornington and St. Leonards  respectively, in two nearly straight and parallel lines; Swan Bay and  Swan Island were missed altogether; and the graceful curve of the coast  round by Sorrento and Dromana--a curve most grateful to the eye on a day  when sea and sky are blue, and the silver sands and white cliffs shine in  the clear light--was tortured into a sharp bend. It was a very rough bit  of work.    The fact that an expedition sent out for discovery purposes, and which  named a considerable extent of the coast-line traversed after the Emperor  who had enabled it to be despatched, had to depend upon a manuscript  accidentally obtained from a captured British merchant ship for a chart  of the principal port in the territory so flauntingly denominated, hardly  calls for comment. But even when we are in possession of this  information, we are still left in some doubt as to whether the French had  not some sort of a drawing of Port Phillip before they left Sydney.  Otherwise the course pursued by their commodore after quitting that port  is quite unaccountable. The following reasons induce that belief.    When Baudin bade an affectionate and grateful farewell to Governor King  at Sydney on November 18, he sailed direct to King Island, which is  situated in Bass Strait, on the 40th parallel of south latitude, about  midway between the south-east of Cape Otway and the north-west corner of  Tasmania. Le Geographe was accompanied by Le Naturaliste and the little  Casuarina. A camp was established on the island, which was fully charted.  Baudin had missed it on his former voyage, though he had sailed within a  few miles of it. It will be remembered that when Flinders conversed with  him in Encounter Bay, and \"inquired concerning a large island said to lie  in the western entrance of Bass Strait,\" Baudin said he had not seen it,  \"and seemed to doubt much of its existence.\"* (*Flinders, Voyage 1 188.)  But Flinders found it easily enough, and spent a little time there before  entering Port Phillip. It was doubtless this inquiry of Flinders that  induced Baudin to mark down on his chart a purely fictitious island far  westward of the actual one, and to inscribe against it the words, \"it is  believed that an island exists in this latitude.\"* (* \"On croit qu'il  existe une ile par cette latitude.\" See the chart, a little west of Cape  Bridgewater (Cap Duquesne).)    As Baudin afterwards found the real island, it is curious that the  imaginary one should have been kept upon his chart; but there is a reason  for that also. While the French lay at King Island, most of the work done  up to date--geographical, zoological, and other--was collected and sent  back to France on Le Naturaliste; Le Geographe and the Casuarina  remaining to finish the exploratory voyage. Le Naturaliste sailed for  Europe on December 16, and entered the port of Havre on June 6, 1803. Had  Baudin lived to return to France, and to supervise the completion of the  charts, it is most probable that he would have erased the island which  was merely supposed, as he had since charted the real one; but Freycinet,  not having been present at the meeting with Flinders, and knowing nothing  of the reason which induced Baudin to set it down, left it there--a  quaint little fragment of corroboration of the truth of Flinders'  narrative of the Encounter Bay incident.    Now, when at the end of December Le Geographe and the Casuarina sailed  from King Island--the naturalists having in the interval profitably  enjoyed themselves in collecting plants, insects, and marine  specimens--they made direct for Kangaroo Island, four hundred miles away,  to resume the work which had been commenced in the gulfs in the previous  April and May. The whole of the movements of the ships up to this time  are to be read in the printed logs appended to volume 3 of the Voyage de  Decouvertes. Baudin made no call at Port Phillip, nor did one of his  three vessels visit the harbour either before or after reaching King  Island. But by this time Baudin knew all about the port, and it is surely  difficult to suppose that he would have sailed straight past it in  December unless at length he had it marked on his rough charts. His  officers knew about it too, though none of them had seen it; for Captain  Hamelin of Le Naturaliste reported when he reached Paris, that, as he  left King Island, he met and spoke to \"an English goelette on her way to  Port Philips [sic], south-east coast.\"* (* Moniteur, 27 Thermidor.) It  was the Cumberland, Lieutenant Charles Robbins, bound on a mission to be  explained later.    It seems reasonable to assume that when Le Naturaliste sailed for France  on December 16, and the two other ships for Kangaroo Island later in the  same month, Baudin was quite satisfied that he had in his possession as  complete a representation of the whole of the Terre Napoleon coasts  westward to the gulfs, as would justify him in resuming the work from  that situation. Clearly, then, he obtained a Port Phillip drawing of some  kind before he left Sydney.    From what source could Baudin have obtained such a chart, however rough  and partial?    Up to the time when he lay at Port Jackson, only two ships had ever  entered Port Phillip. These were the Lady Nelson, under Murray's command,  in February 1802--the harbour having been discovered in the previous  month--and the Investigator, under Flinders, in April and May. No other  keels had, from the moment of the discovery until Baudin's vessels  finally left these coasts, breasted the broad expanse of waters at the  head of which the great city of Melbourne now stands. The next ship to  pass the heads was the Cumberland, which, early in 1803, entered with  Surveyor Grimes on board, to make the first complete survey of the port.  But by that time Baudin was far away. From one or other of the two  available sources, therefore, Baudin must have obtained a drawing,  assuming that he did obtain one in Sydney; and if he did not, his sailing  past the port, when he had an opportunity of entering it in December, was  surely as extraordinary a piece of wilful negligence as is to be found in  the annals of exploration.    It is possible that Baudin or one of his officers saw some drawing made  on the Lady Nelson. If they saw one made by Murray himself, it is not  likely to have been a very good one. Murray was not a skilled  cartographer. Governor King, who liked him, and wished to secure  promotion for him, had to confess in writing to the Duke of Portland,  that he did not \"possess the qualities of an astronomer"]]]
