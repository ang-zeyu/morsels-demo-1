On the treeless desert pampas the Chingolo is rarely seen, but wherever  man builds a house and plants a tree there it comes to keep him company,  while in cultivated and thickly settled districts it is excessively  abundant, and about Buenos Ayres it literally swarms in the fields and  plantations. They are not, strictly speaking, gregarious, but where food  attracts them, or the shelter of a hedge on a cold windy day, thousands  are frequently seen congregated in one place; when disturbed, however,  these accidental flocks immediately break up, the birds scattering  abroad in different directions.    The Chingolo is a very constant singer, his song beginning with the dawn  of day in spring, and continuing until evening; it is very short, being  composed of a chipping prelude and four long notes, three uttered in a  clear thin voice, the last a trill. This song is repeated at brief  intervals, as the bird sits motionless, perched on the disc of a  thistle-flower, the summit of a stalk, or other elevation; and where the  Chingolos are very abundant, the whole air, on a bright spring morning,  is alive with their delicate melody; only one must pause and listen  before he is aware of it, otherwise it will escape him, owing to its  thin ethereal character, the multitudinous notes not mingling but  floating away, as it were, detached and scattered, mere gossamer webs of  sound that very faintly impress the sense. They also sing frequently at  night, and in that dark silent time their little melody sounds strangely  sweet and expressive. The song varies greatly in different districts;  thus, in Bahia Blanca it is without the long trill at the end, and in  other localities I have found it vary in other ways.    The Chingolos pair about the end of September, and at that time their  battles are frequent, as they are very pugnacious. The nest is made  under a thistle or tuft of grass, in a depression in the soil, so that  the top of the nest is on a level with the surface of the ground. The  nest is mostly made and lined with horse-hair, the eggs four or five,  pale blue, and thickly spotted with dull brown. Sometimes, though very  rarely, a nest is found in a bush or on a stump several feet above the  ground. Two broods are reared in the season, the first in October, the  second in February or March. I have known these birds to breed in April  and May, and these very late nests escape the infliction of parasitical  eggs. When the nest is approached or taken, the Chingolos utter no  sound, but sit in dumb anxiety, with tail expanded and drooping wings.      78. ZONOTRICHIA CANICAPILLA, Gould.

Durnford found this species common and abundant on the Chupat River and  in the interior of Patagonia. It has a pretty song, and sings in the  evening and during the night when the moon is shining. It nests among  coarse grass and herbage, making an unpretending structure of the former  material, which is lined with fibres. It lays four eggs, pale green,  thickly striated with light reddish-brown spots running into each other,  and most numerous at the large end.      79. ZONOTRICHIA STRIGICEPS, Gould.

The prevailing colour of this little field-sparrow is grey, marked and  mixed with fuscous and brown; the shoulder and space between the beak  and eye are yellow. It is a common species in the northern portion of  the Argentine country, and appears now to be gradually extending its  range southwards. Many years ago I first noticed it on the pampas north  of Buenos Ayres; afterwards I found it in the immediate neighbourhood  of that city; then it began to spread over the plains to the south,  appearing every spring in greater numbers, but it is still far from  common. It has, I fancy, a limited migration, as I could never find one  in winter. It is solitary, and frequents open plains and fields; lives  on the ground, and never alights on a tree. The male has a favourite  perch, a tall weed or post, where he spends a great deal of his time,  repeating his song at intervals of half a minute; it is short and  pleasing, and has a slight resemblance to the song of the Yellow-Hammer,  but is more delicate and melodious. When approached, the bird flies down  and conceals itself in the grass.      82. SALTATRICULA MULTICOLOR, Burm.    (MANY-COLOURED GROUND-FINCH.)

To Dr. Burmeister we owe the discovery of this brilliant Finch, as of  so many other Argentine species. He met with it at Parana, in the bushy  lands east of the city, and obtained five specimens. White found it near  Andalgala in Catamarca, on trees, feeding on the insects in the flowers  and on seeds; and Durnford collected specimens near Salta.    Examples of this species were also obtained by Weisshaupt near Mendoza  (_cf._ Salvin, Ibis, 1880, p. 355).      83. EMBERNAGRA PLATENSIS (Gm.).

All females, with the exception of the female with litter D,  consumed amounts of food that lie within one standard deviation of the  means for their species. The female with litter D had the most young,  consumed the most food but drank the least water of the four females.  Later, when separated from her litter and placed on the low protein  diet, this female drank only .046 milliliters of water per gram of body  weight per day. This figure is less than one-third of the average amount  (.174) for this species (Table 7).    The records of water and food consumption for litters A, C, and D are  given in Table 12; the mice in litter B persisted in placing wood  shavings in the opening of the spout on their water bottle, causing loss  of the water. The data show that mice in all three litters had an  average water and food consumption within one standard deviation of the  mean for adults of their respective species (Tables 7 and 12). It is  interesting that juveniles of both species require no more food and  water per gram of body weight than adults. This indicates that if a  young animal survives the rigors of postnatal life until it is weaned,  it is then at no disadvantage as far as food and water consumption are  concerned. This would be greatly advantageous to the species, as a  population, for the young could disperse immediately upon weaning, and  go into any areas that would be habitable for adults of the species.

Drought could reduce the water content of the vegetation to such a level  that pregnant or lactating females might find it difficult, if not  impossible, to raise litters successfully. If such a drought persisted  throughout an entire breeding season, the next year's population would  be reduced in numbers, for even under normal climatic conditions it is  almost exclusively the juveniles that survive from one breeding season  to the next. If such a hypothetical drought occurred, lactating females  of _P. truei_ would be in a more critical position than lactating  females of _P. maniculatus_.    In order to determine how much water was available to mice in the peak  of the breeding season, samples of the three most common plants in the  study area were collected each week for analysis of their moisture  content. Plants were placed in separate plastic bags that were sealed in  the field. About a dozen plants of each species were used in each  determination. Only the new tender shoots of the plants were collected,  for it was assumed that mice would eat these in preference to the  tougher basal portions of the plants. The plants were taken immediately  to the laboratory and were weighed in the bag. Then the bag was opened  and it and the contents placed in an incubator at 85 degrees Fahrenheit  for a period of at least 72 hours. About 48 hours were required to dry  the plants to a constant weight. The dried plants were weighed and their  percentages of moisture were determined. Plants lose some water upon  being placed in a closed bag; small drops of water appear immediately on  the inner surface of the bag. Therefore, the bag must be weighed at the  same time as the plants and the weight of the dried bag must be  subtracted later.    The three kinds of plants chosen were among the most widely distributed  species in the study area, and all three grow close to the ground,  within reach of mice. Stems and leaves of two of the plants, _Comandra  umbellata_ and _Penstemon linarioides_, were readily eaten by captive  animals. Mice also were observed to eat leaves of _Comandra_ after being  released from metal live traps. The third species, _Solidago  petradoria_, differs from the other two in having a short woody stem  that branches at ground level. The more succulent shoots arise from this  woody stem. The leaves of _Solidago_ are coarse and were not eaten by  captive mice. Nevertheless, this species was chosen because it is widely  distributed and has the growth form of several other species of plants  in the area.    The graph in Figure 20 shows that _Comandra_ contains the highest  percentage of water through most of the summer. Water content of both  _Penstemon_ and _Comandra_ was greatly reduced in the dry period that  occurred in early July. _Solidago_ maintained a relatively constant  percentage of moisture; perhaps its woody stem serves for water storage.  The rains of July and August increased the percentage of moisture in the  plants, but not to the extent expected. Neither _Solidago_ nor  _Comandra_ reached the levels of hydration of early June. All plants  were collected at or about 11 A. M. At night, when mice are active,  these plants would be expected to contain a higher percentage of water  than in the daytime.    The data in Figure 20 indicate that mice probably are not endangered by  water shortages in most years. The average percentage of moisture in the  plants studied was as follows: _Comandra umbellata_ 62.33 per cent;  _Solidago petradoria_ 53.0 per cent; _Penstemon linarioides_ 49.28 per  cent. If a mouse were to eat ten grams of plant material containing 50  per cent moisture, it would provide him with five grams of food and five  grams of water, both of which exceed the minimum daily needs for  non-pregnant adults of either species.    The data indicate that there are sufficient differences in water  consumption between _P. maniculatus_ and _P. truei_ to account for their  habitat preferences in Mesa Verde National Park. In years having average  precipitation, water present in the vegetation has the potential for  providing enough moisture for the needs of both species. Extended  drought would affect individuals of _P. truei_ more adversely than  individuals of _P. maniculatus_.        [Illustration: FIG. 20: Graph showing percentages of moisture         contained during the summer of 1964, by three abundant and         widely-distributed species of plants in Mesa Verde National         Park, Colorado.]          PARASITISM      Ectoparasites were collected by placing specimens of _Peromyscus_ in  separate plastic bags soon after death, adding cotton saturated with  carbon tetrachloride, closing the bag for about five minutes, then  brushing the fur of the specimen above a sheet of white paper. The  ectoparasites were sorted and sent to specialists for identification.  Endoparasites were saved when stomach and intestinal contents were  examined. Larvae of botflies were collected from mice in the autumn of  1962, placed in sand in containers, and kept over winter until they  hatched. Eyelids of alcoholic specimens were inspected for mites by an  authority on these organisms.    In 1961, the incidence of parasitism by botflies was the highest for the  period 1960-1966. _P. maniculatus_ was more heavily infected with  warbles than was _P. truei_. In 84 individuals of _P. maniculatus_ taken  in September 1961, from Morfield Ridge, 32.1 per cent had warbles. The  average number of warbles per animal was 1.24, and it was not uncommon  to find two or three warbles per mouse. Sixty-nine per cent of the  warbles were in the third instar stage, and the rest were in the second  instar stage. Warble infestation was higher in the first half of  September (40 per cent of mice infected) than in the second half of the  month (30 per cent infected), but a larger percentage of the warbles  were found (69 per cent) in the second half of the month.    In October 1961, 12.9 per cent of 62 _P. truei_ were infected with  warbles. The average number of warbles per infected mouse was 1.37.  Seventy-three per cent of the warbles were in the third instar stage;  the rest were in the second instar stage. Warble infestation was higher  in the first half of October (16 per cent of the mice infected) than in  the second half of the month (5.5 per cent infected). These mice were  collected from several localities on Chapin Mesa, in pinyon-juniper  woodland.    In Mesa Verde the greatest incidence of infestations is in late  September and early October. This agrees with the finding of other  investigators (Sealander, 1961:58).    Sealander (1961) investigated hematological values in deer"]]]
