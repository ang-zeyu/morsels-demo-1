How gladly we welcomed the first  strawberries and blue-berries which pretty Mrs. Bucketee, as we called  her, brought to us! She got the name from always being hungry  (_bucketee_), when she came, and she laughed merrily one day when  called so inadvertently. We ourselves went out and gathered several  pailsful from the rocks on the first portage. Blue-berries, or  knuckle-berries as they are called in Ontario, grow much larger in the  North-west than I ever saw them elsewhere, being sometimes as large as  small Delaware grapes. The little bushes grow thickly in the crevices of  the rocks, and are so completely covered with fruit that their tiny  leaves are scarcely visible. They have a beautiful bloom upon them when  fresh, and are cool and delicious to the taste.    Summer swiftly passed, and the time drew near when I was to leave Lake  Deception, and, after staying a day or two at each of the other houses on  the line, turn my steps eastward, back to what my friends called  civilized life. It was not without many a heartache that I bade good-bye  to the wee bairns whom I loved so dearly, knowing that, though my regrets  might be lifelong, in their childish hearts the pain of parting would be  but the grief of an hour.

The 27th of August dawned sultry and oppressive, but having decided to  leave Inver for a long-promised visit to Ostersund on that day, and  feeling that if I did not get the parting with the children over at once  I should never succeed in going away at all, I determined to carry out my  intention, although by doing so I was obliged to forego the pleasure of  visiting Kalmar, which I regretted very much.    Mr. K---- and Mr. F---- came for me about two o'clock, and sending the  man on with my travelling-bag, I prepared to enjoy the first long walk I  had taken since I left Ontario. From the top of the east rock I took my  last look at the spot where I had spent nearly sixteen months, on which I  shall always look back with kindly memories. Clinging to the rough  railing, and walking quickly over the floating logs, we were soon across  the boom in Lake Deception, and over the first short portage to Lake  Beau-Beau--or \"Champagne Charlie\" Lake--a beautiful sheet of water, with  several pretty islands, along whose southern shore the Canada Pacific  Railway line runs.    Catching sight of a boat, which probably belonged to a gang of men who  were at work with pulleys, removing great fragments of rock from a  cutting near, Mr. F---- took possession of it, and we rowed across,  ignoring the fatigue of the poor navvies, who, after a hard day's work,  would have to walk round the lake to recover their property.    On the opposite shore part of the trail lay through a long, narrow  valley, where it became such a mere path that two could not walk abreast;  then it passed over such lofty hills, and into such sudden dips of valley  land, that one could not help speculating as to the immense cost of  filling up and levelling to bring the line to the proper grade. We  skirted the shores of Lake Lulu, whose blue waters glistened in the  afternoon sun, as we caught a momentary glimpse through the trees of the  tiny hill, where a clear fresh spring tempted us to sit on the gnarled  trunk of a fallen tree and refresh ourselves. How small we felt by  involuntary comparison with the gigantic rock towering above our heads,  or even with the huge fragments thrown out and scattered at its base! I  wonder if future ages will look upon these blocks of stone as we do upon  Stonehenge, and conjecture with what powerful weapons we ancients could  have moved them, or what convulsion of nature had dislodged them from  their bed, and thrown them headlong into the lovely dell.    I should like to linger over the delightful three weeks I spent at  Ostersund, and describe in detail the tranquil pleasures of every day.  How we sat working with the children, through long, quiet mornings, on  the small space cleared in front of the house, or wandered through the  woods in search of mosses and ferns; how we went for long paddles on Lake  Lulu, either in the bright afternoon, when we took the children with us  over to the island garden, returning with supplies of ripe red tomatoes,  or in the clear, silent evenings, when we pushed out the canoe in any  direction--for all were charming--watching the glowing sunset die beyond  the hills, and the Indian camp fires wake to life along the shores.    One of the strangest thunderstorms I ever saw raged while I was at  Ostersund. The whole day had been warm, and as night fell the air became  sultry, and the sky assumed a leaden hue. Directly west of us, the only  bit of horizon we could see was across the line of railway; on either  side of this, high wooded rocks, some few hundred feet from the line,  dropped to a much lower level than that on which the house stood, and  beyond the brow of this declivity the sky had the appearance of a huge  fire, whose bright-red flames shot up into great clouds of rolling,  whirling smoke, their inky hue gradually expanding until the whole sky  became covered. Still the flames raged on in a weird stillness broken  only by the sound of rushing wind, the crackling and swaying of branches,  or a low, distant moan that warned us the storm was on its way. For more  than half an hour we watched the horizon, scarcely believing that its  strange hue was not really the reflection of a fire in the woods, till,  with a report as of a thousand cannon crashing on all sides, and the  fierce blast of a tornado, the storm was upon us. It spent itself,  however, in that one blast; the red light gradually paled and died, stars  peeped through the riven clouds, and the muttering thunder rolled away to  the south.    A culvert was being built close to the house, and we took the greatest  interest in the proceedings of all concerned--from the oxen, with their  tinkling bells, labouring up the steep with the heavy timbers in tow, to  the sad-faced contractor and his jovial, good-looking partner. As I  stood one morning watching the latter go up with a springing step to the  top, to superintend the placing of a beam, I saw the chain below snap,  and at the same instant the huge beam swung round, striking the  contractor, who, with a groan, fell headlong to the bottom of the  ravine--a distance of twenty feet. Instantly half a dozen men sprang down  and pulled him up, while another ran for Mr. K----, who telegraphed for  the doctor. Most fortunately, a cross stick against which the poor man  struck had broken his fall, and except for a few bruises and the shock he  was unhurt, and back at work again in a few days.    I lingered on at Ostersund until I heard that my heavy luggage had  arrived at Kuwatin, _via_ Clear Water Bay and the Lake of the Woods,  having had a narrow escape on its way over the portage. The horse ran  away, and dragged the cart over a number of nitro-glycerine cans. The  driver fled in terror, but returned some time afterward, and was  astonished to find an atom of either horse, cart, or luggage remaining.  The driver was not wanting in bravery either, for a few days before, the  left wheel of his cart had come in contact with a stump and turned over,  the whole weight of the horse's body falling upon the man. Knowing that  the load in the cart was too heavy for the horse to raise unassisted, and  that if he struggled he would be pounded to death, he had the presence of  mind to seize the brute by the ear and hold his head to the ground until  assistance came--an hour and a half afterwards--when the poor fellow was  too exhausted and numbed to get up.    As it was necessary that I should repack my luggage before sending it to  Winnipeg, I was obliged to tear myself away from Ostersund, hoping to see  my friends again before I left the contract altogether. This hope,  however, was not fulfilled, and it was a last farewell I took of them as  they stood on the rustic wharf, while Mr. K---- pushed off the birch-bark  canoe on which I was lounging. Paddling along the east shore, rather  close in, as the lake was rough, we soon reached the portage to Middle  Lake. Lifting the canoe well out of the water, and turning it over, Mr.  K---- raised it above his head; then, slipping the paddles on his  shoulders, and across the bars of the canoe, he carried it with ease up  the steep bank and down the hill to the other lake. In this way Indians  will carry, or, as they call it, \"portage,\" their canoes for long  distances. Middle Lake is long, narrow, and swampy-looking, less pretty  than any we crossed on our way out. Leaving the canoe at the next portage  well drawn in under the trees, and the paddles carefully hidden in the  underbrush, lest any stray traveller should take advantage of it, we  walked the remaining two miles to Darlington Bay.    The heavy rains of the week before had made parts of the track very wet,  but by jumping from one log to another, and utilizing stones scattered  from the cuttings, we managed to cross very well. One of the most  beautiful spots is where the line crosses War Eagle Rock Lake. Until on  the very brow of the rocky, perpendicular shore, one does not suspect the  existence of a lake, and when nearly there I laughed as Mr. K---- asked  how wide a lake I thought there was between us and the trail leading  through some trees apparently close by. A moment later I paused in  astonishment. At our feet, full sixty feet below, lying between two walls  of rock, which looked as though an "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7128"],[0,"Indian Fairy Tales (#20)"],[1,"palace. And finding no fault-finder there, he sought  among those who lived outside the city, in the suburbs, at the four  gates. And there too finding no one to find fault, and hearing only  his own praise, he determined to search the country places.    So he made over the kingdom to his ministers, and mounted his chariot;  and taking only his charioteer, left the city in disguise. And  searching the country through, up to the very boundary, he found no  fault-finder, and heard only of his own virtue; and so he turned back  from the outer-most boundary, and returned by the high road towards  the city.    Now at that time the king of Kosala, Mallika by name, was also ruling  his kingdom with righteousness; and when seeking for some fault in  himself, he also found no fault-finder in the palace but only heard of  his own virtue! So seeking in country places, he too came to that  very spot. And these two came face to face in a low cart-track with  precipitous sides, where there was no space for a chariot to get out  of the way!    Then the charioteer of Mallika the king said to the charioteer of the  king of Benares, \"Take thy chariot out of the way!\"    But he said, \"Take thy chariot out of the way, O charioteer! In this  chariot sitteth the lord over the kingdom of Benares, the great king  Brahma-datta.\"    Yet the other replied, \"In this chariot, O charioteer, sitteth the  lord over the kingdom of Kosala, the great king Mallika. Take thy  carriage out of the way, and make room for the chariot of our king!\"    Then the charioteer of the king of Benares thought, \"They say then  that he too is a king! What _is_ now to be done?\" After some  consideration, he said to himself, \"I know a way. I'll find out how  old he is, and then I'll let the chariot of the younger be got out of  the way, and so make room for the elder.\"    And when he had arrived at that conclusion, he asked that charioteer  what the age of the king of Kosala was. But on inquiry he found that  the ages of both were equal. Then he inquired about the extent of his  kingdom, and about his army, and his wealth, and his renown, and about  the country he lived in, and his caste and tribe and family. And he  found that both were lords of a kingdom three hundred leagues in  extent; and that in respect of army and wealth and renown, and the  countries in which they lived, and their caste and their tribe and  their family, they were just on a par!    Then he thought, \"I will make way for the most righteous.\" And he  asked, \"What kind of righteousness has this king of yours?\"    Then the chorister of the king of Kosala, proclaiming his king's  wickedness as goodness, uttered the First Stanza:        \"The strong he overthrows by strength,      The mild by mildness, does Mallika;      The good he conquers by goodness,      And the wicked by wickedness too.        Such is the nature of _this_ king!        Move out of the way, O charioteer!\"    But the charioteer of the king of Benares asked him, \"Well, have you  told all the virtues of your king?\"    \"Yes,\" said the other.    \"If these are his _virtues_, where are then his faults?\" replied he.    The other said, \"Well, for the nonce, they shall be faults, if you  like! But pray, then, what is the kind of goodness your king has?\"    And then the charioteer of the king of Benares called unto him to  hearken, and uttered the Second Stanza:        \"Anger he conquers by calmness,      And by goodness the wicked;      The stingy he conquers by gifts,      And by truth the speaker of lies.        Such is the nature of _this_ king!        Move out of the way, O charioteer!\"    And when he had thus spoken, both Mallika the king and his charioteer  alighted from their chariot. And they took out the horses, and removed  their chariot, and made way for the king of Benares!          Pride goeth before a Fall      In a certain village there lived ten cloth merchants, who always went  about together. Once upon a time they had travelled far afield, and  were returning home with a great deal of money which they had obtained  by selling their wares. Now there happened to be a dense forest near  their village, and this they reached early one morning. In it there  lived three notorious robbers, of whose existence the traders had  never heard, and while they were still in the middle of it the robbers  stood before them, with swords and cudgels in their hands, and ordered  them to lay down all they had. The traders had no weapons with them,  and so, though they were many more in number, they had to submit  themselves to the robbers, who took away everything from them, even  the very clothes they wore, and gave to each only a small loin-cloth a  span in breadth and a cubit in length.    The idea that they had conquered ten men and plundered all their  property, now took possession of the robbers' minds. They seated  themselves like three monarchs before the men they had plundered, and  ordered them to dance to them before returning home. The merchants  now mourned their fate. They had lost all they had, except their  loin-cloth, and still the robbers were not satisfied, but ordered them  to dance.    There was, among the ten merchants, one who was very clever. He  pondered over the calamity that had come upon him and his friends, the  dance they would have to perform, and the magnificent manner in which  the three robbers had seated themselves on the grass. At the same time  he observed that these last had placed their weapons on the ground, in  the assurance of having thoroughly cowed the traders, who were now  commencing to dance. So he took the lead in the dance, and, as a song  is always sung by the leader on such occasions, to which the rest keep  time with hands and feet, he thus began to sing:        \"We are enty men,      They are erith men:      If each erith man,      Surround eno men      Eno man remains.      _Ta, tai, tom, tadingana._\"    The robbers were all uneducated, and thought that the leader was  merely singing a song as usual. So it was in one sense; for the leader  commenced from a distance, and had sung the song over twice before he  and his companions commenced to approach the robbers. They had  understood his meaning, because they had been trained in trade.    When two traders discuss the price of an article in the presence of a  purchaser, they use a riddling sort of language.    [Illustration:]    [Illustration:]    \"What is the price of this cloth?\" one trader will ask another.    \"Enty rupees,\" another will reply, meaning \"ten rupees.\"    Thus, there is no possibility of the purchaser knowing what is meant  unless he be acquainted with trade language. By the rules of this  secret language erith means \"three,\" enty means \"ten,\" and eno means  \"one.\" So the leader by his song meant to hint to his fellow-traders  that they were ten men, the robbers only three, that if three pounced  upon each of the robbers, nine of them could hold them down, while the  remaining one bound the robbers' hands and feet.    [Illustration:]    [Illustration:]    The three thieves, glorying in their victory, and little understanding  the meaning of the song and the intentions of the dancers, were  proudly seated chewing betel and tobacco. Meanwhile the song was sung  a third time. _Ta tai tom_ had left the lips of the singer; and,  before _tadingana_ was out of them, the traders separated into parties  of three, and each party pounced upon a thief. The remaining one--the  leader himself--tore up into long narrow strips a large piece of  cloth, six cubits long, and tied the hands and feet of the robbers.  These were entirely humbled now, and rolled on the ground like three  bags of rice!    The ten traders now took back all their property, and armed themselves  with the swords and cudgels of their enemies; and when they reached  their village, they often amused their friends and relatives by  relating their adventure.          Raja Rasalu.      Once there lived a great Raja, whose name was Salabhan, and he had a  Queen, by name Lona, who, though she wept and prayed at many a shrine,  had never a child to gladden her eyes. After a long time, however, a  son was promised to her.    Queen Lona returned to the palace, and when the time for the birth of  the promised son drew nigh, she inquired of three Jogis who came  begging to her gate, what the child's fate would be, and the youngest  of them answered and said, \"Oh, Queen! the child will be a boy, and he  will live to be a great man. But for twelve years you must not look  upon his face, for if either you or his father see it before the  twelve years are past, you will surely die! This is what you must do;  as soon as the child is born you must send him away to a cellar  underneath the ground, and never let him see the light of day for  twelve years. After they are over, he may come forth, bathe in the  river, put on new clothes, and visit you. His name shall be Raja  Rasalu, and he shall be known far and wide.\"    So, when a fair young Prince was in due time born into the world, his  parents hid him away in an underground palace, with nurses, and  servants, and everything else a King's son might desire. And with him  they sent a young colt, born the same day, and sword, spear, and  shield, against the day when Raja Rasalu should go forth into the  world.    So there the child lived, playing with his colt, and talking to his  parrot, while the nurses taught him all things needful for a King's  son to know.    Young Rasalu lived on, far from the light of day, for eleven long  years, growing tall and strong, yet contented to remain playing with  his colt, and talking to his parrot; but when the twelfth year began,  the lad's heart leapt up with desire for change, and he loved to  listen to the sounds of life which came to him in his palace-prison  from the outside world.    \"I must go and see where the voices come from!\" he said; and when his  nurses told him he must not go for "]]]
