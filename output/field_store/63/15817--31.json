The page and the squire proceeded thither, and found Beatrice in the  arms of a peasant, advanced in years.    It was the father of the maiden, who had been informed that she was in  the castle of Vivar, and who had not come sooner to clasp her in his  arms for the reason which his own words will explain.    \"My daughter, how were you rescued from that accursed Don Suero? How is  it that I find you here?\" asked the elderly man; and she began  immediately to inform him of what had happened since she had been torn  from his side.    The poor farmer shed tears of gratitude on learning the protection that  had been given to his child by Rodrigo and the other inmates of the  castle.    \"Ah,\" he exclaimed, \"God will bless those who have restored a daughter  to her father; God will protect the good cavalier who drew his sword in  defence of the oppressed, and for the punishment of a wicked tyrant.\"    But as Beatrice was impatient to learn what had happened to those who  were her companions when returning from the pilgrimage, and what had  taken place afterwards at Carrion, her father hastened to relieve her  uneasiness and anxiety.    \"The father of Martin,\" he said, \"was killed by a stab which he received  in the horrible fight from one of the retainers of Don Suero. Martin  embraced his dead body and cried out, weeping--    \"'Father, father! your son will avenge you!'    \"He then turned to your mother and to me, and added, 'Your daughter  shall also be avenged; I swear it by the love I always had for her, and  by the salvation of my father's soul.' He then disappeared, and no one  since then has learned where he is.\"    \"But was he wounded?\" asked Beatrice anxiously.    \"No, my daughter,\" replied her father.    And the girl murmured in a low tone--    \"I thank thee, O my God! I am still worthy of him--I trust in his love.\"    These words were a dagger-blow to Fernan, who doubtless believed that  the lover of Beatrice had fallen in the combat, and that the maiden had  already forgotten him. It was little less for Alvar, who, although he  had promised the squire to renounce his pretensions to the love of  Beatrice, still nursed the idea of following them on, acting prudently  behind the back of the squire. Thus it was that they looked at each  other gloomily, and, with a certain kind of despair, Fernan said to the  page--    \"It appears to me, friend Alvar, that we fail in courtesy and good  manners, listening to conversations which do not concern us.\"    \"Certainly,\" replied Alvar.    And although Beatrice and her father told them that they did not  inconvenience them in the slightest, each one retired in a different  direction, Fernan muttering--    \"Ungrateful, ungrateful women! The more one loves them the worse is he  treated. But I, curse me! am myself the cause of the misfortunes which  have come upon me, for I have enraged Mayorica, looking out for too much  love. There are certainly more than two women in Spain for each man, and  I swear by the soul of Beelzebub that I am right in my calculation; but  as women are so stupid that they won't listen to reason, why should I  not resign myself to their foolishness, and enjoy the love of one of  them. Well, then, from this day forward I shall devote myself heart and  soul to Mayorica, and let the others see what a treasure of love they  have lost in me. Mayorica is fierce when I annoy her, but kind and  affectionate when I please her. Oh, Mayorica of my eyes! you shall not  have to complain again of your lover, for if you guard your honour for  him, he will do the same for you.\"    And Alvar--    \"What a fool I was to fall in love, when I saw how things were going  with Fernan. It is a sad thing to find the position occupied, when for  the first time a man bestows his affections on a woman. They seem to be  born provided with lovers, just as they are with arms and legs. O Lord,  what a blessing it would be to men if you had created them without  hearts!\"    The old man continued--    \"We arrived at Carrion, and on the following day your mother was  stricken down with an illness which nearly cost her her life. She called  out for you in her delirium, and she could not be consoled. Then the  news of your safety arrived, and her health improved so much that I was  able to leave her to come to you.\"    \"Let us set out at once, father, for I must return to my mother. No  danger threatens me at Carrion, for the sword of my deliverer deprived  the count of life.\"    \"It deprived him of his prey, my daughter, but not of his life, for Don  Suero returned to his castle the next day, and has recovered from his  wounds, which he says he received fighting with a band of robbers.\"    \"Then what shall we do, father?\" exclaimed Beatrice; \"what shall we do  to protect you and my mother from his anger, for having thwarted his  criminal intentions, and to protect me from a fresh attempt on his part?  But, ah! do not be uneasy, father, go and bring hither my mother; let us  fly from the estates of the count. I am certain that the generous and  noble family, to whom we owe our safety, will give us a small piece of  ground to farm, a humble refuge, in which we shall be able to enjoy a  tranquil life, and show our gratitude to, and bless our benefactors  every day.\"    Beatrice was not wrong in trusting to the generosity of the lord and  lady of Vivar. A few days after, she and her parents were installed,  content and happy, in a small farmhouse, situated at a short distance  from the castle, surrounded by fields which Pero Lopez, for such was the  name of the girl's father, was ploughing with a pair of mules which, a  short time before, had been feeding in the stables of Diego Lainez.          CHAPTER XII    THE COMBAT BETWEEN RODRIGO AND MARTIN GONZALEZ      The cocks were crowing in Vivar, when Diego Lainez and Rodrigo,  accompanied by squires and pages, amongst whom were Fernan and Alvar,  started for Calahorra. All the roads were alive with people, who were  making their way towards that town, desirous of being present at the  combat between Martin Gonzalez and the knight of Castile and Leon; for  the champion of the King of Aragon enjoyed the reputation of being a  doughty cavalier, and it was believed, not without good reason, that, to  confront him, Don Fernando would select the bravest of his cavaliers.  The morning was beautiful, the road had been recently put into good  condition by order of the king, who had proceeded to Calahorra, and  everything contributed to make the journey pleasant, the district then  being as full of animation and life as it was dull and gloomy during the  greater part of the year. This conduced to the fact that Diego and  Rodrigo arrived at Calahorra, preserving the pleasant feelings which the  letters of the king had brought with them. More than once the brave  youth heard the good wishes which the passers-by expressed for the  success of the champion of Don Fernando, although they did not know who  he was; and, far from feeling any fear as to the result of the contest,  he became more and more confident, and felt sure that he would be the  victor, notwithstanding the fact that the wounds which he had received  from Don Gome were not yet quite healed.    Diego and his son proceeded, immediately on their arrival in Calahorra,  to the temporary residence of the king. Don Fernando received both of  them most warmly, and Diego could not forbear feeling, with great  pleasure, how much brighter his honour then shone than when he was last  at the court.    \"Sire,\" said Rodrigo, as much moved as his father, \"you have conferred  on me an honour which I do not deserve, and which the best cavalier in  the world might well envy. If I had done anything to merit it, you would  now only be paying me a debt; but, not having done such, I owe you one,  and I am longing for the moment when I can repay it.\"    \"That moment, Rodrigo, is very near: this very day the place for the  combat shall be arranged and the conditions settled, so that the fight  may begin at sunrise, as you are so anxious for it.    \"Would to God, Rodrigo,\" continued Don Fernando, throwing his arms round  the neck of the young man, \"that I had a son like you! I would give my  crown to have one as brave and good as the son of Diego Lainez.\"    Diego raised his rugged and noble brow, with a movement caused by  paternal pride, and at that moment he would not have exchanged his  happiness for a king's throne.    \"You have such a son, sire,\" replied Rodrigo, with much modesty. \"Don  Sancho will be a brave cavalier and a prince worthy to succeed his  father on the throne of Castile and Leon. Sire, ask the few Moors and  Christians that were left alive at Atapuerca, who the valiant cavalier  was that struck terror into the army of the King of Navarre, and they  will tell you that he was a beardless youth, as cool as he was daring,  as fearless as he was skilful in the use of his sword; they will also  tell you that he was Don Sancho, your son. The laws of the duel  authorise the champion to select a second according to his pleasure, and  I, using that right, select as my second the Infante Don Sancho if such  a choice does not displease you and your family.\"    \"The Infante will feel honoured by your selection, which I as his  father, approve of. Go and take some repose, Rodrigo, and prepare  yourself for to-morrow's combat. And you, honoured Diego, from this day  forward shall reside in my Alcazar, for I desire to have you near me, so  that you may assist me with your advice, and also to have you near my  sons, that, from your experience and loyalty, they may become endowed  with all the good qualities which are so conspicuous in your son.\"    \"Sire,\" said Diego, \"permit me to kiss your hand.\"    \"I give you, not alone my hand, but also my heart;\" and he embraced the  old man affectionately.    The following day dawned, peaceful and beautiful as the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/420"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#20)"],[1,"al's ill temper.  They soon mixed a tub of oatmeal with a little  water, and Jim ate it with much relish.    Then the servants heaped a lot of rugs upon the floor and the old horse  slept on the softest bed he had ever known in his life.    In the morning, as soon as it was daylight, he resolved to take a walk  and try to find some grass for breakfast; so he ambled calmly through  the handsome arch of the doorway, turned the corner of the palace,  wherein all seemed asleep, and came face to face with the Sawhorse.    Jim stopped abruptly, being startled and amazed.  The Sawhorse stopped  at the same time and stared at the other with its queer protruding  eyes, which were mere knots in the log that formed its body.  The legs  of the Sawhorse were four sticks driving into holes bored in the log;  its tail was a small branch that had been left by accident and its  mouth a place chopped in one end of the body which projected a little  and served as a head.  The ends of the wooden legs were shod with  plates of solid gold, and the saddle of the Princess Ozma, which was of  red leather set with sparkling diamonds, was strapped to the clumsy  body.    Jim's eyes stuck out as much as those of the Sawhorse, and he stared at  the creature with his ears erect and his long head drawn back until it  rested against his arched neck.    In this comical position the two horses circled slowly around each  other for a while, each being unable to realize what the singular thing  might be which it now beheld for the first time.  Then Jim exclaimed:    \"For goodness sake, what sort of a being are you?\"    \"I'm a Sawhorse,\" replied the other.    \"Oh; I believe I've heard of you,\" said the cab-horse; \"but you are  unlike anything that I expected to see.\"    \"I do not doubt it,\" the Sawhorse observed, with a tone of pride.  \"I  am considered quite unusual.\"    \"You are, indeed.  But a rickety wooden thing like you has no right to  be alive.\"    \"I couldn't help it,\" returned the other, rather crestfallen.  \"Ozma  sprinkled me with a magic powder, and I just had to live.  I know I'm  not much account; but I'm the only horse in all the Land of Oz, so they  treat me with great respect.\"    \"You, a horse!\"    \"Oh, not a real one, of course.  There are no real horses here at all.  But I'm a splendid imitation of one.\"    Jim gave an indignant neigh.    \"Look at me!\" he cried.  \"Behold a real horse!\"    The wooden animal gave a start, and then examined the other intently.    \"Is it possible that you are a Real Horse?\" he murmured.    \"Not only possible, but true,\" replied Jim, who was gratified by the  impression he had created.  \"It is proved by my fine points.  For  example, look at the long hairs on my tail, with which I can whisk away  the flies.\"    \"The flies never trouble me,\" said the Saw-Horse.    \"And notice my great strong teeth, with which I nibble the grass.\"    \"It is not necessary for me to eat,\" observed the Sawhorse.    \"Also examine my broad chest, which enables me to draw deep, full  breaths,\" said Jim, proudly.    \"I have no need to breathe,\" returned the other.    \"No; you miss many pleasures,\" remarked the cab-horse, pityingly.  \"You  do not know the relief of brushing away a fly that has bitten you, nor  the delight of eating delicious food, nor the satisfaction of drawing a  long breath of fresh, pure air.  You may be an imitation of a horse,  but you're a mighty poor one.\"    \"Oh, I cannot hope ever to be like you,\" sighed the Sawhorse.  \"But I  am glad to meet a last a Real Horse.  You are certainly the most  beautiful creature I ever beheld.\"    This praise won Jim completely.  To be called beautiful was a novelty  in his experience.  Said he:    \"Your chief fault, my friend, is in being made of wood, and that I  suppose you cannot help.  Real horses, like myself, are made of flesh  and blood and bones.\"    \"I can see the bones all right,\" replied the Sawhorse, \"and they are  admirable and distinct.  Also I can see the flesh.  But the blood, I  suppose is tucked away inside.\"    \"Exactly,\" said Jim.    \"What good is it?\" asked the Sawhorse.    Jim did not know, but he would not tell the Sawhorse that.    \"If anything cuts me,\" he replied, \"the blood runs out to show where I  am cut.  You, poor thing! cannot even bleed when you are hurt.\"    \"But I am never hurt,\" said the Sawhorse.  \"Once in a while I get  broken up some, but I am easily repaired and put in good order again.  And I never feel a break or a splinter in the least.\"    Jim was almost tempted to envy the wooden horse for being unable to  feel pain; but the creature was so absurdly unnatural that he decided  he would not change places with it under any circumstances.    \"How did you happen to be shod with gold?\" he asked.    \"Princess Ozma did that,\" was the reply; \"and it saves my legs from  wearing out.  We've had a good many adventures together, Ozma and I,  and she likes me.\"    The cab-horse was about to reply when suddenly he gave a start and a  neigh of terror and stood trembling like a leaf.  For around the corner  had come two enormous savage beasts, treading so lightly that they were  upon him before he was aware of their presence.  Jim was in the act of  plunging down the path to escape when the Sawhorse cried out:    \"Stop, my brother!  Stop, Real Horse!  These are friends, and will do  you no harm.\"    Jim hesitated, eyeing the beasts fearfully.  One was an enormous Lion  with clear, intelligent eyes, a tawney mane bushy and well kept, and a  body like yellow plush.  The other was a great Tiger with purple  stripes around his lithe body, powerful limbs, and eyes that showed  through the half closed lids like coals of fire.  The huge forms of  these monarchs of the forest and jungle were enough to strike terror to  the stoutest heart, and it is no wonder Jim was afraid to face them.    But the Sawhorse introduced the stranger in a calm tone, saying:    \"This, noble Horse, is my friend the Cowardly Lion, who is the valiant  King of the Forest, but at the same time a faithful vassal of Princess  Ozma.  And this is the Hungry Tiger, the terror of the jungle, who  longs to devour fat babies but is prevented by his conscience from  doing so.  These royal beasts are both warm friends of little Dorothy  and have come to the Emerald City this morning to welcome her to our  fairyland.\"    Hearing these words Jim resolved to conquer his alarm.  He bowed his  head with as much dignity as he could muster toward the savage looking  beasts, who in return nodded in a friendly way.    \"Is not the Real Horse a beautiful animal?\" asked the Sawhorse  admiringly.    \"That is doubtless a matter of taste,\" returned the Lion.  \"In the  forest he would be thought ungainly, because his face is stretched out  and his neck is uselessly long.  His joints, I notice, are swollen and  overgrown, and he lacks flesh and is old in years.\"    \"And dreadfully tough,\" added the Hungry Tiger, in a sad voice.  \"My  conscience would never permit me to eat so tough a morsel as the Real  Horse.\"    \"I'm glad of that,\" said Jim; \"for I, also, have a conscience, and it  tells me not to crush in your skull with a blow of my powerful hoof.\"    If he thought to frighten the striped beast by such language he was  mistaken.  The Tiger seemed to smile, and winked one eye slowly.    \"You have a good conscience, friend Horse,\" it said, \"and if you attend  to its teachings it will do much to protect you from harm.  Some day I  will let you try to crush in my skull, and afterward you will know more  about tigers than you do now.\"    \"Any friend of Dorothy,\" remarked the Cowardly Lion, \"must be our  friend, as well.  So let us cease this talk of skull crushing and  converse upon more pleasant subjects.  Have you breakfasted, Sir Horse?\"    \"Not yet,\" replied Jim.  \"But here is plenty of excellent clover, so if  you will excuse me I will eat now.\"    \"He's a vegetarian,\" remarked the Tiger, as the horse began to munch  the clover.  \"If I could eat grass I would not need a conscience, for  nothing could then tempt me to devour babies and lambs.\"    Just then Dorothy, who had risen early and heard the voices of the  animals, ran out to greet her old friends.  She hugged both the Lion  and the Tiger with eager delight, but seemed to love the King of Beasts  a little better than she did his hungry friend, having known him longer.    By this time they had indulged in a good talk and Dorothy had told them  all about the awful earthquake and her recent adventures, the breakfast  bell rang from the palace and the little girl went inside to join her  human comrades.  As she entered the great hall a voice called out, in a  rather harsh tone:    \"What! are YOU here again?\"    \"Yes, I am,\" she answered, looking all around to see where the voice  came from.    \"What brought you back?\" was the next question, and Dorothy's eye  rested on an antlered head hanging on the wall just over the fireplace,  and caught its lips in the act of moving.    \"Good gracious!\" she exclaimed.  \"I thought you were stuffed.\"    \"So I am,\" replied the head.  \"But once on a time I was part of the  Gump, which Ozma sprinkled with the Powder of Life.  I was then for a  time the Head of the finest Flying Machine that was ever known to  exist, and we did many wonderful things.  Afterward the Gump was taken  apart and I was put back on this wall; but I can still talk when I feel  in the mood, which is not often.\"    \"It's very strange,\" said the girl.  \"What were you when you were first  alive?\"    \"That I have forgotten,\" replied the Gump's Head, \"and I do not think  it is of much importance.  But here comes Ozma; so I'd better hush up,  for the Princess doesn't like me to chatter since she changed her name  from Tip to Ozma.\"    Just then the girlish Ruler of Oz opened the door and greeted Dorothy  with a good-morning kiss.  The little Princess seemed fresh and rosy  and in good spirits.    \"Breakfast is served, dear,\" she said, \"and "]]]
