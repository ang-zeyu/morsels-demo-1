If  men have not the spirit of gathering they are blind and cannot see afar  off, and are nigh unto burning. The gathering is one great test of  faith, by which you may know who is on the Lord's side. Kindred spirits  long to congregate together.    The language of Ruth is expressive of the desires of God's people in  all ages. \"Thy people is my people, and their God is my God, and where  thou goest I will go, and where thou lodgest I will lodge.\" Her sister  Orpah could forego the society of saints and the ordinances of God  sooner than part with her native country and kindred. A portion of  Lot's family saw no wisdom in the _gathering_ until it was too late.  Sir, the _gathering_ is the great universal national _preacher_ of the  last days. It speaks in trumpet tones out of every nation where it has  been commenced. As birds retire before a storm, and fowls before the  darkness of night, so the multitudes that go out by sea and land is a  practical warning that cannot be mistaken by those that remain.    The nations wonder at the spectacle of such multitudes going out of  their midst under the warning voice of Jehovah, and are ready to cry  out, who are these that fly as clouds and as doves to their windows?  Who are these Latter-day Saints? What is their doctrine, and whither  are they fleeing? The sound of the gathering goeth into all the earth.  The fear and dread of approaching calamities take possession of the  nations. The righteous are being withdrawn apart, in order that the  Almighty may stretch out his chastening hand, and inflict his sore  judgment upon rebellious nations. There is no room to mistake the faith  and sincerity of those whose gathering together is without a parallel  for magnitude of enterprise. The Israelites performed a journey that  might have been compassed in about forty days, but the Latter-day  gathering brings sons and daughters from the ends of the earth.    The great design of Jesus in bringing the righteous to _unity_ of  faith and the knowledge of God, is wonderfully facilitated by bringing  the righteous together in one place. The ancient Jews were taught of  God to build up Jerusalem as a place of _gathering_; and those whose  circumstances forbid them to locate there, either from political or  agricultural interests, were required to visit Jerusalem at least  three times a year, where they could interchange hospitalities and  friendships, and contract matrimonial alliances, &c. Also, in addition  to these facilities of union, their baptisms were to be performed in  the national font; their marriage rites, and records of genealogy, were  to be performed and deposited in the archives of the great Temple of  the Lord at Jerusalem.    In this great city of gathering, their frequent and splendid national  festivals were to be held from generation to generation. By these  multiplied means, the union of Jews became proverbially strong; and  their attachments to their nation and kindred, and national rights and  usages, became as enduring as their existence. If, perchance, they  should be scattered amongst the remote nations of the earth, still the  recollection of their journeyings to Jerusalem in social groups--their  splendid festivals at the national capitol--their royal affinity with  the great and good of God's people--vibrated through their minds with  resuscitating power. There it was that the Almighty condescended to  reveal his acceptance of their sacrifices, and bless the people from  the greatest to the least, and even speak to the people through their  High Priest at least once a year.    Now, when God shall build up Zion and his Holy House in the tops of  the mountains, and all nations flow into it, will He not appear in his  glory? Such a measure of union, and strength of attachment to the Lord  and his people, the last days will exhibit as was never before realized  on the earth; then will Zion rise and shine, her light being come, and  the glory of God being risen upon her--yea, be an eternal excellency  and the praise and joy of the whole earth!    Who, sir, can contemplate the glory of Zion, when God shall have  gathered his people from the four corners of the earth, and made  of them a great nation, an \"innumerable company,\" and blessed them  with his own laws and ordinances, binding them together in a new and  everlasting covenant, without the most thrilling emotions of love,  gratitude, and joy in believing. Break out, O thou inhabitant of  Zion, and sing for the glory that shall shortly be revealed; when the  kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdom of Christ, and the  stakes thereof shall no more be thrown down for ever!    Now, sir, in conclusion, may I not say, with all deference to the  misguided teachers of modern christianity, that the Lord is performing  a marvellous work and a wonder in the greatest of all gatherings since  the foundation of the world. He is gathering his righteous hosts from  the nations of the earth to one place, and setting his forces in battle  array against the powers of darkness, and against all flesh that exalts  itself against the knowledge of God. And by truth, and by judgments, he  will thoroughly cleanse the earth, and overthrow more wickedness in ten  years to come, than blind, boasting, self-righteous modern christianity  can in ten thousand years.    Please to accept my warmest desires for your present and everlasting  peace and welfare.    Your humble servant,    ORSON SPENCER.        LETTER XI.    THE LATTER-DAY JUDGMENTS.    _Liverpool, October_ 28, 1847.    Reverend and Dear Sir,--THE LATTER-DAY JUDGMENTS, the subject of my  present letter, deserve a careful consideration among the topics  peculiar to Latter-day Saints.    You must be already aware that it is a part of my faith that God  designs to set up his kingdom _on the earth_, in order that the meek  may inherit the _earth_ as their celestial abode; and as He will not  employ His enemies to administer even temporal affairs within the  bounds of His kingdom, His kingdom will consequently be a temporal  one, and wholly and exclusively conducted by His own loyal subjects,  according to His righteous will. He will proceed from conquest to  conquest, until all other kingdoms are overthrown and merged in  one--even His own kingdom.    The means by which he will subdue and overcome the nations of the  earth are two, viz.. TRUTH and JUDGMENT. He explicitly declares,  that He will lay _judgment_ to the line and _righteousness_ to the  plummet. His latter-day proclamation is, \"Fear God and give glory to  Him, for the hour of His judgment is come.\" The salvation that He  offers is temporal, spiritual, and eternal; and the judgments which He  will inflict are also similar. As a supreme lawgiver, He claims the  submission of all the inhabitants of the earth. Nor is it necessary that  His servants should be for ever preaching the gospel on the earth, in  order to effect a universal reconciliation of all men to their God. All  men will not obey the truth, therefore what the truth will not save  through faith, God's judgments will destroy through their unbelief. And  these judgments will be executed speedily, even as in the days of Noah  and Lot. God formerly gave the inhabitants timely warning before the  deluge came, and before the fire descended from heaven.    The gospel must first be preached, and then the judgments will follow  in quick succession. Even as a chalk-line makes an impression for  the saw and the chisel, so God's judgments will make an impression,  sensible and summary. The day of vengeance has long been in His heart.  A day when His jealousy and wrath shall burn like fire, even to the  lowest hell. The wicked and diabolical spirits will be pursued, even  to their dens of darkness, and there scourged and bound. The righteous  veterans that have long since fought and bled, in order to establish  a reign of righteousness and truth on the earth, and prayed with  uplifted hands for this day of truth and judgment, their language is,  \"How long, O Lord, wilt thou not avenge our blood on them that dwell  on the earth?\" But God, who is long-suffering--not willing that any  should perish, but rather that they should repent and be saved--has  nevertheless reserved the worst spirits to the day of wrath and the  revelation of the righteous judgment of God. That day is even now  dawned. God has commenced to reveal his wrath against all them that  obey not the gospel. It is a day of revelation and prophecy.    The righteous are timely advised to gather out and separate themselves  from those that will not obey the gospel. They are not disobedient to  the great revelation of mercy to them that obey, and of wrath to them  that are contentious and obey not the truth. The winds and waves are  wafting thousands to the land of refuge. The prairies and wilderness  reverberate with the songs of the outcast but chosen and elect ones  of God. A more intelligent, enterprising, and bold race of Saints,  perhaps, has never been summoned to the help of the Lord against the  mighty, since the foundation of the world. Their fortitude, patience,  and invincibility are indelibly written in their bloodstained pathway  through Missouri and Illinois. The old arts of tormenting the sick  by burning their houses, and of famishing the robust by plundering  their crops, and forcing the sale of property by threats of murder and  arson, are fruitless. Prison walls and tragic scenes of assassination  and expatriation have spent their fury to no purpose. The daring  sons of Pharaoh, Cain, and Judas are baffled and confounded at such  godlike firmness. Occasionally a priest, goaded on by the loss of his  flock, has dared to act as champion, and throw the gauntlet for public  discussion, but the inevitable discomfiture that has followed, has  taught him the superior policy of evading discussion. But,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45899"],[0,"Studies of Travel: Italy (#20)"],[1," have still to catch  glimpses of the Tyrrhenian waters, to look, as at distant objects, on  the bold outline of Ischia and on Vesuvius crowned with his pillar of  cloud. But this time we do not obey the seemingly inflexible law which  decrees that he who goes to Rome and does not turn back from Rome must  go and see Naples, whether he dies after the sight or not. This time  we have no call either to Naples itself or to the far more attractive  range of objects of which Naples is the centre. Our errand is to pass  from the primaeval cities of the Latin and the Volscian to the cities of  south-eastern Italy. Their chief present attraction lies in the series  of churches raised in the days of the Norman and Angevin kings; but  their memories carry us back through a long series of stirring ages,  not indeed to the hoary antiquity of Cori and Alatri, but to the days  when Southern Italy, the earliest Italy, was counted for a part of  Hellas. It is not for nothing that we look out from thence on those  eastern lands which then perhaps were the less Hellenic of the two.    Greek influence indeed begins--some say that it historically began--on  the western, not the eastern, shore of Italy, in lands which, in the  present journey, we leave to the west of us and see only in glimpses.  We hurry on, passing by much that we might well stop and study, from  Frosinone to Caserta. And we are luxurious enough to rejoice at finding  ourselves there. We have proved that a few days and nights may be  passed among Volscians and Hernicans without damage or even serious  discomfort; but we trust that it is not an avowal to be ashamed of that  it is a pleasing exchange to find ourselves in thoroughly civilized  quarters in the plains of Campania. We have found our Capua; not,  however, at Capua itself, but under the shadow of the royal palace a  few miles off. But we desert Capua only because Capuan comforts--we  will not talk of luxuries--have fled from Capua and have found their  new home at Caserta. Those who have tried a night at Capua itself,  _Santa Maria di vetere Capua_, not the newer Capua on the site of  Casilinum, report that, if Hannibal's army could be quartered there  again, they would certainly not be corrupted by anything excessive in  the way of creature comforts. Anagni and Frosinone are said to be far  in advance of the city which long was to Rome what Paris long was to  London. The excuse doubtless would be that Capua is Capua no longer.  The name of Capua, and with it the stirring history of early mediaeval  Capua, has wandered from the true Capua to Casilinum. It is not at the  town now called Capua, but at the village--it is hardly more--of Santa  Maria, that we must look for what is left of Etruscan Vulturnum, of  Samnite, Campanian, and Roman Capua, the special city of pleasure, the  city where, before all others, pleasure was sought for in scenes of  blood.    On our present course we have no special call to either Capua, old or  new. We have in times past seen both the amphitheatre of the elder  Capua and the cathedral portico of the newer. But, when Caserta has  been chosen as a convenient halting-place, it would be a shame for the  historic traveller to pass by two such famous spots without a glance at  either, while in their neighbourhood lies a third object, of no small  value in its own line, which will have the further charm of novelty.  It is well, while still fresh from the Flavian amphitheatre at Rome,  to look again on the amphitheatre of Capua--Capua, the mistress of  Rome in the sports of slaughter. There is a certain special lore of  amphitheatres, the mastery of which does not fall to the lot of all,  even of those who look on the monuments either of Rome or Capua with  a general historical eye. But it is easy to see that in the Capuan  amphitheatre the underground arrangements can be studied as they  hardly can be studied anywhere else. The walls, the seats, are far  less perfect than at Rome; much more then are they less perfect than  at Verona. But the substructure seems wholly untouched. In the Roman  Coliseum the underground work is only partially brought to light,  while of what has been brought to light it is not always clear how  much is the work of the Flavian Emperors, and how much of the mediaeval  barons who turned the amphitheatre into a fortress. Here, better than  at Rome, we may study what really happened when the lions came up  from underground to be slaughtered by the imperial hands of Commodus.  If any question is raised as to the date of the building, one who is  not a special Capuan topographer may be satisfied with the fact, that  the inscription of Hadrian claims for that prince only a renovation  and enrichment of the building with columns and statues. This seems  to imply that the shell is older; it may be far older. In idea at  least, the amphitheatre of Capua is far older than that of Rome. It  illustrates a strange but well-known law of human nature, that the  taste for luxury and the taste for blood should find a common home.    Besides the modernized basilica, besides the tombs of various sizes  and designs which line the road--one of which is indeed singularly  like a model of an amphitheatre--the true Capua has little to show  besides the amphitheatre itself. It is strange to see so great a city,  one which for some ages must have been far greater, far more splendid  than Rome, so utterly gone--or rather to see the little that is left of  it translated to another site. But great as Capua undoubtedly was, we  begin to doubt its extreme antiquity. Capua, once Etruscan Vulturnum,  remained Etruscan Vulturnum till the fourth century of Rome. It was the  last remnant of the great Etruscan dominion in that region of Italy.  As such, it represents a state of things far older than Rome. But the  city itself may well be of later date than Rome. At all events, we may  be sure that it is of far later date than Cori and Alatri. The city  by the Vulturnus, down in the plain, taking its name from its guardian  river, marks an advance not only on the mountain strongholds of Segni  and Norba, but on Veii, on Rome itself. It must be far older than  Florence; but it is the fellow of Florence; it marks an equal forsaking  of the oldest type of a city. It is hard to see where the _arx_ of  Capua could have stood, if we are to understand by an _arx_ something  set upon a hill. But what a position that of Capua was, according to  later ideas, is shown by its revival after the Hannibalian war. The  Samnite settlement, parted away from their kinsfolk of the mountains,  had become Campanians, and, to seek shelter against their kinsfolk of  the mountains, they had been fain in some sort to become Romans.         \"Cives Romani tunc facti sunt Campani,\"    says the line which comes as such a relief after the involved  constructions of later Latin writers, a line which records a fact as  simply worded as it could be in a mediaeval chronicle, which gives us  a true leonine rime, and which makes its way through six feet without  a single dactyl. To the Campanian knights their Roman citizenship was  doubtless pleasant enough; it may have been less so to the commons,  who had the private rights only, and who were burthened with a payment  to the knights. Yet we find that the revolt of Capua to Hannibal was  largely the work of noble leaders. The truth doubtless is that the  large amount of independence which Capua still kept only made any  measure of dependence more galling. Then came the blow which made Capua  for a while cease to be a city. Its lands became the property of the  Roman people; its walls were left simply as a shelter for those who  filled them. Yet the great city of Campania arose again, to be once  more a great city till the second blow, when men of Semitic speech came  not as deliverers but as destroyers, when Capua moved to Casilinum,  and when all that was left of the elder city put itself under the  keeping of a heavenly protectress as Santa Maria di Capua. Among those  remnants of what was, the walls of Capua, the _arx_ of Capua, are not  to be found; at all events they do not strike the traveller on his  first or his second visit. For something faintly answering to a Capuan  _arx_, he takes himself to the neighbouring mountains. There, on their  lowest slopes, looking out on Vesuvius and Ischia, looking down on the  Campanian plain, with its river, with its older and its newer Capua, we  come to a spot where a famous temple of the older faith has given way  to a less famous one of the new. A journey from Caserta to the Capuan  amphitheatre in the plain may well take in a journey to the slope of  Tifata, the slope of the hill on which Hannibal so often pitched his  camp, and where the church of Sant' Angelo in Formis has supplanted the  holy place of Diana and Jupiter, which took its name from the mountain  which rises above its massy tower.          V. A Church by the Camp of Hannibal.      We reach Tifata, the very centre of the marching and counter-marching  of Hannibal, the spot from which we may best call up a picture of  beleaguered Capua, of Fulvius waiting for his prey, of the stout  fighting on either side of the enclosing lines, of Hannibal, as his  last hope, turning aside to threaten Rome, in the chance that the  danger of Rome might lead to the relief of Capua. The name Tifata, in  some tongue, most likely in the old Oscan, describes the evergreen oaks  which doubtless formed the sacred grove of Diana. The goddess had no  lake here, as she had at Aricia, nor do we hear of any such grim legend  on Tifata as grew round--         Those trees in whose dim shadow         The ghastly priest doth reign,       The priest who slew the slayer,         And shall himself be slain.    Yet beside the rites of Canaan, the rites of the gods who had sent  forth him whose name proclaimed him as the Grace of Baal, the darkest  forms into which any kind of Italian or"]]]
