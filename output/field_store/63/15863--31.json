When leaving the North in July, he said:    \"All the good we have done is but a little blood-letting, which has  only weakened the madness, but not at all cured it; and I tremble to  fear that this vile spot may still be the ruin of this island and of  our family.\"    Such was the famous battle of Culloden, fought in 1746, and putting a  final end to the hopes of all the Stuarts. As to Cumberland's order for  \"No quarter,\" if any apology can be made for such brutality, it must be  found in the fact that the Highland chiefs had on their side agreed to  spare no captured enemy.    The battle has also left a name commonly given to the nine of diamonds,  which is called \"the curse of Scotland,\" because it is said that on  that card Cumberland wrote his bloodthirsty order.    Such, in brief, was the story of Prince Charlie's gallant attempt to  restore the kingdom of his ancestors. Even when defeated, he would not  at once leave Scotland. A French squadron appeared off the coast near  Edinburgh. It had been sent to bring him troops and a large supply of  money, but he turned his back upon it and made his way into the  Highlands on foot, closely pursued by English soldiers and Lowland  spies.    This part of his career is in reality the most romantic of all. He was  hunted closely, almost as by hounds. For weeks he had only such sleep  as he could snatch during short periods of safety, and there were times  when his pursuers came within an inch of capturing him. But never in  his life were his spirits so high.    It was a sort of life that he had never seen before, climbing the  mighty rocks, and listening to the thunder of the cataracts, among  which he often slept, with only one faithful follower to guard him. The  story of his escape is almost incredible, but he laughed and drank and  rolled upon the grass when he was free from care. He hobnobbed with the  most suspicious-looking caterans, with whom he drank the smoky brew of  the North, and lived as he might on fish and onions and bacon and wild  fowl, with an appetite such as he had never known at the luxurious  court of Versailles or St.-Germain.    After the battle of Culloden the prince would have been captured had  not a Scottish girl named Flora Macdonald met him, caused him to be  dressed in the clothes of her waiting-maid, and thus got him off to the  Isle of Skye.    There for a time it was impossible to follow him; and there the two  lived almost alone together. Such a proximity could not fail to stir  the romantic feeling of one who was both a youth and a prince. On the  other hand, no thought of love-making seems to have entered Flora's  mind. If, however, we read Campbell's narrative very closely we can see  that Prince Charles made every advance consistent with a delicate  remembrance of her sex and services.    It seems to have been his thought that if she cared for him, then the  two might well love; and he gave her every chance to show him favor.  The youth of twenty-five and the girl of twenty-four roamed together in  the long, tufted grass or lay in the sunshine and looked out over the  sea. The prince would rest his head in her lap, and she would tumble  his golden hair with her slender fingers and sometimes clip off tresses  which she preserved to give to friends of hers as love-locks. But to  the last he was either too high or too low for her, according to her  own modest thought. He was a royal prince, the heir to a throne, or  else he was a boy with whom she might play quite fancy-free. A lover he  could not be--so pure and beautiful was her thought of him.    These were perhaps the most delightful days of all his life, as they  were a beautiful memory in hers. In time he returned to France and  resumed his place amid the intrigues that surrounded that other Stuart  prince who styled himself James III., and still kept up the appearance  of a king in exile. As he watched the artifice and the plotting of  these make-believe courtiers he may well have thought of his innocent  companion of the Highland wilds.    As for Flora, she was arrested and imprisoned for five months on  English vessels of war. After her release she was married, in 1750; and  she and her husband sailed for the American colonies just before the  Revolution. In that war Macdonald became a British officer and served  against his adopted countrymen. Perhaps because of this reason Flora  returned alone to Scotland, where she died at the age of sixty-eight.    The royal prince who would have given her his easy love lived a life of  far less dignity in the years that followed his return to France. There  was no more hope of recovering the English throne. For him there were  left only the idle and licentious diversions of such a court as that in  which his father lived.    At the death of James III., even this court was disintegrated, and  Prince Charles led a roving life under the title of Earl of Albany. In  his wanderings he met Louise Marie, the daughter of a German prince,  Gustavus Adolphus of Stolberg. She was only nineteen years of age when  she first felt the fascination that he still possessed; but it was an  unhappy marriage for the girl when she discovered that her husband was  a confirmed drunkard.    Not long after, in fact, she found her life with him so utterly  intolerable that she persuaded the Pope to allow her a formal  separation. The pontiff intrusted her to her husband's brother,  Cardinal York, who placed her in a convent and presently removed her to  his own residence in Rome.    Here begins another romance. She was often visited by Vittorio Alfieri,  the great Italian poet and dramatist. Alfieri was a man of wealth. In  early years he divided his time into alternate periods during which he  either studied hard in civil and canonical law, or was a constant  attendant upon the race-course, or rushed aimlessly all over Europe  without any object except to wear out the post-horses which he used in  relays over hundreds of miles of road. His life, indeed, was eccentric  almost to insanity; but when he had met the beautiful and lonely  Countess of Albany there came over him a striking change. She  influenced him for all that was good, and he used to say that he owed  her all that was best in his dramatic works.    Sixteen years after her marriage her royal husband died, a worn-out,  bloated wreck of one who had been as a youth a model of knightliness  and manhood. During his final years he had fallen to utter destitution,  and there was either a touch of half contempt or a feeling of remote  kinship in the act of George III., who bestowed upon the prince an  annual pension of four thousand pounds. It showed most plainly that  England was now consolidated under Hanoverian rule.    When Cardinal York died, in 1807, there was no Stuart left in the male  line; and the countess was the last to bear the royal Scottish name of  Albany.    After the prince's death his widow is said to have been married to  Alfieri, and for the rest of her life she lived in Florence, though  Alfieri died nearly twenty-one years before her.    Here we have seen a part of the romance which attaches itself to the  name of Stuart--in the chivalrous young prince, leading his Highlanders  against the bayonets of the British, lolling idly among the Hebrides,  or fallen, at the last, to be a drunkard and the husband of an  unwilling consort, who in her turn loved a famous poet. But it is this  Stuart, after all, of whom we think when we hear the bagpipes skirling  \"Over the Water to Charlie\" or \"Wha'll be King but Charlie?\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4693"],[0,"Famous Affinities of History: The Romance of Devotion. Vol 1-4, Complete (#20)"],[1,"shall we make of the prisoners?\" asked the officer.    The duke tried to reply, but his utterance was very thick.    \"No quarter!\" he was believed to say.    The officer objected and begged that such an order as that should  be given in writing. The duke rolled over and seized a sheaf of  playing-cards. Pulling one out, he scrawled the necessary order, and  that was taken to the commanders in the field.    The Highlanders could not stand the cannon fire, and the English won.  Then the fury of the common soldiery broke loose upon the country.    There was a reign of fantastic and fiendish brutality. One provost  of the town was violently kicked for a mild remonstrance about the  destruction of the Episcopalian meeting-house; another was condemned  to clean out dirty stables. Men and women were whipped and tortured on  slight suspicion or to extract information. Cumberland frankly professed  his contempt and hatred of the people among whom he found himself, but  he savagely punished robberies committed by private soldiers for their  own profit.    \"Mild measures will not do,\" he wrote to Newcastle.    When leaving the North in July, he said:    \"All the good we have done is but a little blood-letting, which has only  weakened the madness, but not at all cured it; and I tremble to fear  that this vile spot may still be the ruin of this island and of our  family.\"    Such was the famous battle of Culloden, fought in 1746, and putting a  final end to the hopes of all the Stuarts.

It might with equal truth be asserted that the  greatest Russian woman who ever lived was in reality a German. But the  Emperor Napoleon and the Empress Catharine II. resemble each other in  something else. Napoleon, though Italian in blood and lineage, made  himself so French in sympathy and understanding as to be able to play  upon the imagination of all France as a great musician plays upon a  splendid instrument, with absolute sureness of touch and an ability  to extract from it every one of its varied harmonies. So the Empress  Catharine of Russia--perhaps the greatest woman who ever ruled a  nation--though born of German parents, became Russian to the core and  made herself the embodiment of Russian feeling and Russian aspiration.    At the middle of the eighteenth century Russia was governed by the  Empress Elizabeth, daughter of Peter the Great. In her own time, and for  a long while afterward, her real capacity was obscured by her apparent  indolence, her fondness for display, and her seeming vacillation; but  now a very high place is accorded her in the history of Russian rulers."]]]
