His cold went on--it was bad in his head, but it was not one of the kind  when he has to have poultices and can't sit up in bed. But when it had  been in his head nearly a week, Oswald happened to tumble over Alice on  the stairs. When we got up she was crying.    'Don't cry silly!' said Oswald; 'you know I didn't hurt you.' I was very  sorry if I had hurt her, but you ought not to sit on the stairs in the  dark and let other people tumble over you. You ought to remember how  beastly it is for them if they do hurt you.    'Oh, it's not that, Oswald,' Alice said. 'Don't be a pig! I am so  miserable. Do be kind to me.'    So Oswald thumped her on the back and told her to shut up.    'It's about Noel,' she said. 'I'm sure he's very ill; and playing about  with medicines is all very well, but I know he's ill, and Eliza won't  send for the doctor: she says it's only a cold. And I know the doctor's  bills are awful. I heard Father telling Aunt Emily so in the summer. But  he _is_ ill, and perhaps he'll die or something.'    Then she began to cry again. Oswald thumped her again, because he knows  how a good brother ought to behave, and said, 'Cheer up.' If we had been  in a book Oswald would have embraced his little sister tenderly, and  mingled his tears with hers.    Then Oswald said, 'Why not write to Father?'    And she cried more and said, 'I've lost the paper with the address. H.  O. had it to draw on the back of, and I can't find it now; I've looked  everywhere. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. No I won't. But I'm  going out. Don't tell the others. And I say, Oswald, do pretend I'm in  if Eliza asks. Promise.'    'Tell me what you're going to do,' I said. But she said 'No'; and there  was a good reason why not. So I said I wouldn't promise if it came to  that. Of course I meant to all right. But it did seem mean of her not to  tell me.    So Alice went out by the side door while Eliza was setting tea, and she  was a long time gone; she was not in to tea. When Eliza asked Oswald  where she was he said he did not know, but perhaps she was tidying  her corner drawer. Girls often do this, and it takes a long time. Noel  coughed a good bit after tea, and asked for Alice.    Oswald told him she was doing something and it was a secret. Oswald did  not tell any lies even to save his sister. When Alice came back she was  very quiet, but she whispered to Oswald that it was all right. When  it was rather late Eliza said she was going out to post a letter. This  always takes her an hour, because she _will_ go to the post-office  across the Heath instead of the pillar-box, because once a boy dropped  fusees in our pillar-box and burnt the letters. It was not any of us;  Eliza told us about it. And when there was a knock at the door a long  time after we thought it was Eliza come back, and that she had forgotten  the back-door key. We made H. O. go down to open the door, because it  is his place to run about: his legs are younger than ours. And we heard  boots on the stairs besides H. O.'s, and we listened spellbound till the  door opened, and it was Albert's uncle. He looked very tired.    'I am glad you've come,' Oswald said. 'Alice began to think Noel--'    Alice stopped me, and her face was very red, her nose was shiny too,  with having cried so much before tea.    She said, 'I only said I thought Noel ought to have the doctor. Don't  you think he ought?' She got hold of Albert's uncle and held on to him.    'Let's have a look at you, young man,' said Albert's uncle, and he sat  down on the edge of the bed. It is a rather shaky bed, the bar that  keeps it steady underneath got broken when we were playing burglars last  winter. It was our crowbar. He began to feel Noel's pulse, and went on  talking.    'It was revealed to the Arab physician as he made merry in his tents on  the wild plains of Hastings that the Presence had a cold in its head. So  he immediately seated himself on the magic carpet, and bade it bear him  hither, only pausing in the flight to purchase a few sweetmeats in the  bazaar.'    He pulled out a jolly lot of chocolate and some butterscotch, and grapes  for Noel. When we had all said thank you, he went on.    'The physician's are the words of wisdom: it's high time this kid was  asleep. I have spoken. Ye have my leave to depart.'    So we bunked, and Dora and Albert's uncle made Noel comfortable for the  night.    Then they came to the nursery which we had gone down to, and he sat down  in the Guy Fawkes chair and said, 'Now then.'    Alice said, 'You may tell them what I did. I daresay they'll all be in a  wax, but I don't care.'    'I think you were very wise,' said Albert's uncle, pulling her close to  him to sit on his knee. 'I am very glad you telegraphed.'    So then Oswald understood what Alice's secret was. She had gone out and  sent a telegram to Albert's uncle at Hastings. But Oswald thought she  might have told him. Afterwards she told me what she had put in the  telegram. It was, 'Come home. We have given Noel a cold, and I think we  are killing him.' With the address it came to tenpence-halfpenny.    Then Albert's uncle began to ask questions, and it all came out,  how Dicky had tried to catch the cold, but the cold had gone to Noel  instead, and about the medicines and all. Albert's uncle looked very  serious.    'Look here,' he said, 'You're old enough not to play the fool like this.  Health is the best thing you've got; you ought to know better than to  risk it. You might have killed your little brother with your precious  medicines. You've had a lucky escape, certainly. But poor Noel!'    'Oh, do you think he's going to die?' Alice asked that, and she was  crying again.    'No, no,' said Albert's uncle; 'but look here. Do you see how silly  you've been? And I thought you promised your Father--' And then he gave  us a long talking-to. He can make you feel most awfully small. At last  he stopped, and we said we were very sorry, and he said, 'You know I  promised to take you all to the pantomime?'    So we said, 'Yes,' and knew but too well that now he wasn't going to.  Then he went on--    'Well, I will take you if you like, or I will take Noel to the sea for a  week to cure his cold. Which is it to be?'    Of course he knew we should say, 'Take Noel' and we did; but Dicky told  me afterwards he thought it was hard on H. O.    Albert's uncle stayed till Eliza came in, and then he said good night in  a way that showed us that all was forgiven and forgotten.    And we went to bed. It must have been the middle of the night when  Oswald woke up suddenly, and there was Alice with her teeth chattering,  shaking him to wake him.    'Oh, Oswald!' she said, 'I am so unhappy. Suppose I should die in the  night!'    Oswald told her to go to bed and not gas. But she said, 'I must tell  you; I wish I'd told Albert's uncle. I'm a thief, and if I die to-night  I know where thieves go to.' So Oswald saw it was no good and he sat  up in bed and said--'Go ahead.' So Alice stood shivering and said--'I  hadn't enough money for the telegram, so I took the bad sixpence out of  the exchequer. And I paid for it with that and the fivepence I had. And  I wouldn't tell you, because if you'd stopped me doing it I couldn't  have borne it; and if you'd helped me you'd have been a thief too. Oh,  what shall I do?'    Oswald thought a minute, and then he said--    'You'd better have told me. But I think it will be all right if we pay  it back. Go to bed. Cross with you? No, stupid! Only another time you'd  better not keep secrets.'    So she kissed Oswald, and he let her, and she went back to bed.    The next day Albert's uncle took Noel away, before Oswald had time to  persuade Alice that we ought to tell him about the sixpence. Alice was  very unhappy, but not so much as in the night: you can be very miserable  in the night if you have done anything wrong and you happen to be awake.  I know this for a fact.    None of us had any money except Eliza, and she wouldn't give us any  unless we said what for; and of course we could not do that because of  the honour of the family. And Oswald was anxious to get the sixpence to  give to the telegraph people because he feared that the badness of that  sixpence might have been found out, and that the police might come for  Alice at any moment. I don't think I ever had such an unhappy day. Of  course we could have written to Albert's uncle, but it would have taken  a long time, and every moment of delay added to Alice's danger. We  thought and thought, but we couldn't think of any way to get that  sixpence. It seems a small sum, but you see Alice's liberty depended  on it. It was quite late in the afternoon when I met Mrs Leslie on the  Parade. She had a brown fur coat and a lot of yellow flowers in her  hands. She stopped to speak to me, and asked me how the Poet was. I told  her he had a cold, and I wondered whether she would lend me sixpence if  I asked her, but I could not make up my mind how to begin to say it. It  is a hard thing to say--much harder than you would think. She talked to  me for a bit, and then she suddenly got into a cab, and said--    'I'd no idea it was so late,' and told the man where to go. And just as  she started she shoved the yellow flowers through the window and said,  'For the sick poet, with my love,' and was driven off.    Gentle reader, I will not conceal from you what Oswald did. He knew all  about not disgracing the family, and he did not like doing what I am  going to say: and they were really Noel's flowers, only he could not  have sent them to Hastings, and Oswald knew he would say 'Yes' if Oswald  asked him. Oswald sacrificed his family pride because of his little  sister's danger. I do not say he was a noble boy--I just tell you what  he did, and you can decide for yourself about the nobleness.    He put on his oldest clothes--they're much older than any you would  think he had if you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/775"],[0,"When the Sleeper Wakes (#20)"],[1,"might ask for the  \"wind-vane offices,\" whatever the \"wind-vane offices\" might be.  His first enquiry simply resulted in a direction to go on towards  Westminster. His second led to the discovery of a short cut in which  he was speedily lost. He was told to leave the ways to which he had  hitherto confined himself knowing no other means of transit--and  to plunge down one of the middle staircases into the blackness of a  crossway. Thereupon came some trivial adventures; chief of these an  ambiguous encounter with a gruff-voiced invisible creature speaking in  a strange dialect that seemed at first a strange tongue, a thick flow of  speech with the drifting corpses of English words therein, the dialect  of the latter-day vile. Then another voice drew near, a girl's voice  singing, \"tralala tralala.\" She spoke to Graham, her English touched  with something of the same quality. She professed to have lost her  sister, she blundered needlessly into him he thought, caught hold of him  and laughed. But a word of vague remonstrance sent her into the unseen  again.    The sounds about him increased. Stumbling people passed him, speaking  excitedly. \"They have surrendered!\" \"The Council! Surely not the  Council!\" \"They are saying so in the Ways.\" The passage seemed wider.  Suddenly the wall fell away. He was in a great space and people were  stirring remotely. He inquired his way of an indistinct figure. \"Strike  straight across,\" said a woman's voice. He left his guiding wall, and in  a moment had stumbled against a little table on which were utensils of  glass. Graham's eyes, now attuned to darkness, made out a long vista  with pallid tables on either side. He went down this. At one or two of  the tables he heard a clang of glass and a sound of eating. There were  people then cool enough to dine, or daring enough to steal a meal  in spite of social convulsion and darkness. Far off and high up he  presently saw a pallid light of a semi-circular shape. As he approached  this, a black edge came up and hid it. He stumbled at steps and found  himself in a gallery. He heard a sobbing, and found two scared little  girls crouched by a railing. These children became silent at the near  sound of feet. He tried to console them, but they were very still until  he left them. Then as he receded he could hear them sobbing again.    Presently he found himself at the foot of a staircase and near a wide  opening. He saw a dim twilight above this and ascended out of the  blackness into a street of moving Ways again. Along this a disorderly  swarm of people marched shouting. They were singing snatches of the song  of the revolt, most of them out of tune. Here and there torches flared  creating brief hysterical shadows. He asked his way and was twice  puzzled by that same thick dialect. His third attempt won an answer  he could understand. He was two miles from the wind-vane offices in  Westminster, but the way was easy to follow.    When at last he did approach the district of the wind-vane offices it  seemed to him, from the cheering processions that came marching along  the Ways, from the tumult of rejoicing, and finally from the restoration  of the lighting of the city, that the overthrow of the Council must  already be accomplished. And still no news of his absence came to his  ears.    The re-illumination of the city came with startling abruptness. Suddenly  he stood blinking, all about him men halted dazzled, and the world was  incandescent. The light found him already upon the outskirts of the  excited crowds that choked the Ways near the wind-vane offices, and the  sense of visibility and exposure that came with it turned his colourless  intention of joining Ostrog to a keen anxiety.    For a time he was jostled, obstructed, and endangered by men hoarse and  weary with cheering his name, some of them bandaged and bloody in his  cause. The frontage of the wind-vane offices was illuminated by some  moving picture, but what it was he could not see, because in spite  of his strenuous attempts the density of the crowd prevented his  approaching it. From the fragments of speech he caught, he judged it  conveyed news of the fighting about the Council House. Ignorance and  indecision made him slow and ineffective in his movements. For a time he  could not conceive how he was to get within the unbroken facade of this  place. He made his way slowly into the midst of this mass of people,  until he realised that the descending staircase of the central Way led  to the interior of the buildings. This gave him a goal, but the crowding  in the central path was so dense that it was long before he could reach  it. And even then he encountered intricate obstruction, and had an hour  of vivid argument first in this guard room and then in that before he  could get a note taken to the one man of all men who was most eager  to see him. His story was laughed to scorn at one place, and wiser for  that, when at last he reached a second stairway he professed simply to  have news of extraordinary importance for Ostrog. What it was he would  not say. They sent his note reluctantly. For a long time he waited in  a little room at the foot of the lift shaft, and thither at last came  Lincoln, eager, apologetic, astonished. He stopped in the doorway  scrutinising Graham, then rushed forward effusively.    \"Yes,\" he cried. \"It is you. And you are not dead!\"    Graham made a brief explanation.    \"My brother is waiting,\" explained Lincoln. \"He is alone in the  wind-vane offices. We feared you had been killed in the theatre. He  doubted--and things are very urgent still in spite of what we are  telling them _there_--or he would have come to you.\"    They ascended a lift, passed along a narrow passage, crossed a  great hall, empty save for two hurrying messengers, and entered a  comparatively little room, whose only furniture was a long settee and a  large oval disc of cloudy, shifting grey, hung by cables from the wall.  There Lincoln left Graham for a space, and he remained alone without  understanding the shifting smoky shapes that drove slowly across this  disc.    His attention was arrested by a sound that began abruptly. It was  cheering, the frantic cheering of a vast but very remote crowd, a  roaring exultation. This ended as sharply as it had begun, like a sound  heard between the opening and shutting of a door. In the outer room was  a noise of hurrying steps and a melodious clinking as if a loose chain  was running over the teeth of a wheel.    Then he heard the voice of a woman, the rustle of unseen garments. \"It  is Ostrog!\" he heard her say. A little bell rang fitfully, and then  everything was still again.    Presently came voices, footsteps and movement without. The footsteps  of some one person detached itself from the other sounds and drew  near, firm, evenly measured steps. The curtain lifted slowly. A tall,  white-haired man, clad in garments of cream coloured silk, appeared,  regarding Graham from under his raised arm.    For a moment the white form remained holding the curtain, then dropped  it and stood before it. Graham's first impression was of a very broad  forehead, very pale blue eyes deep sunken under white brows, an aquiline  nose, and a heavily-lined resolute mouth. The folds of flesh over the  eyes, the drooping of the corners of the mouth contradicted the  upright bearing, and said the man was old. Graham rose to his feet  instinctively, and for a moment the two men stood in silence, regarding  each other.    \"You are Ostrog?\" said Graham.    \"I am Ostrog.\"    \"The Boss?\"    \"So I am called.\"    Graham felt the inconvenience of the silence. \"I have to thank you  chiefly, I understand, for my safety,\" he said presently.    \"We were afraid you were killed,\" said Ostrog.    \"Or sent to sleep again--for ever. We have been doing everything to keep  our secret--the secret of your disappearance. Where have you been? How  did you get here?\"    Graham told him briefly.    Ostrog listened in silence.    He smiled faintly. \"Do you know what I was doing when they came to tell  me you had come?\"    \"How can I guess?\"    \"Preparing your double.\"    \"My double?\"    \"A man as like you as we could find. We were going to hypnotise him, to  save him the difficulty of acting. It was imperative. The whole of this  revolt depends on the idea that you are awake, alive, and with us. Even  now a great multitude of people has gathered in the theatre clamouring  to see you. They do not trust... You know, of course--something of your  position?\"    \"Very little,\" said Graham.    \"It is like this.\" Ostrog walked a pace or two into the room and turned.  \"You are absolute owner,\" he said, \"of more than half the world. As a  result of that you are practically King. Your powers are limited in  many intricate ways, but you are the figure head, the popular symbol of  government. This White Council, the Council of Trustees as it is called.\"    \"I have heard the vague outline of these things.\"    \"I wondered.\"    \"I came upon a garrulous old man.\"    \"I see... Our masses--the word comes from your days--you know of course,  that we still have masses--regard you as our actual ruler. Just as a  great number of people in your days regarded the Crown as the ruler.  They are discontented--the masses all over the earth--with the rule  of your Trustees. For the most part it is the old discontent, the old  quarrel of the common man with his commonness--the misery of work and  discipline and unfitness. But your Trustees have ruled ill. In certain  matters, in the administration of the Labour Companies, for example,  they have been unwise. They have given endless opportunities. Already we  of the popular party were agitating for reforms--when your waking came.  Came! If it had been contrived it could not have come more opportunity.\"  He smiled. \"The public mind, making no allowance for your years of  quiescence, had already hit on the thought of waking you and appealing"]]]
