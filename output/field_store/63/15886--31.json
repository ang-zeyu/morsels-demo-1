Uncle Jabez strode  straight to the first woman he saw who was disengaged.    \"This girl wants a dress to wear to the school graduating,\" he said,  in his harsh voice. \"It must be white. Let her pick out the goods, all  the fal-lals that go with it, and a pattern to make it by. Ye  understand?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said the woman, smiling.    \"You know me?\" asked Uncle Jabez. \"Yes? Then send the bill to the  other side of the store and I'll pay it when I sell my meal and  flour.\" Then to the astounded Ruth he said: \"I'll come to Sam Curtis'  for you when I'm done. See you don't keep me waiting.\"    He wheeled and strode away before Ruth could find her voice. She was  so amazed that she actually felt faint She could not understand it. A  white dress! And she to make her choice alone, without regard to  material, or price! She could have been no more stunned had Uncle  Jabez suddenly run mad and been caught by the authorities and sent to  an asylum.    But the shop woman awoke her, having asked her twice what kind of  white goods she wanted to see. The repeated query brought Ruth to her  senses. She put the astonishing fact that Uncle Jabez had done this,  behind her, and remembered at once the importance of the task before  her.    She had not listened to the talk of the other girls at school for  nothing. She knew just what was the most popular fabric that season  for simple white dresses that could be \"done up\" when soiled. She had  even found the style of a dress she liked in a fashion magazine that  one of the girls had had at school. Ruth was self-posessed at once.  She went about her shopping as carefully and with as little haste as  though she had been buying for herself for years; whereas this was the  very first frock that she had ever been allowed to have the choice of.    There were costlier goods, and some of the girls of the graduating  class were to have them; but Ruth chose something so durable and at so  low a price that she hoped Uncle Jabez would not be sorry for his  generosity. She saw the goods, and lace, and buttons, and all the  rest, made up into a neat package and sent across to the other counter  with the bill, and then went out of the store and up Market Street  toward the railroad.    She saw Uncle Jabez nowhere, or she would have run to him to thank him  for the present. And she had been in Mercy Curtis' front window for  quite an hour before the mules turned the corner into the street and  the wagon rattled up to the house and stopped.    \"And is that ugly old man your uncle?\" demanded Mercy, who had been  less crusty and exacting herself on this occasion.    \"That is Uncle Jabez;\" admitted Ruth, hastening to put on her hat.    \"He is an ugly one; isn't he? I'd like to know him, I would,\" declared  the odd child. \"He ain't one that's always smirking and smiling, I bet  you!\"    \"He isn't given much to smiling, I must admit,\" laughed Ruth, stooping  to kiss the crippled girl.    \"There! Go along with you,\" said Mercy, sharply. \"You tell that ugly,  dusty man--Dusty Miller, that's what he is--that I'm coming out to  the Red Mill, whether he wants me to or not.\"    And when Ruth got out upon the street Mercy had her window open and  cried through the opening, shaking her little fist the while:    \"Remember! You tell Dusty Miller what I told you! I'm coming out  there.\"    \"What's the matter with that young one?\" growled Uncle Jabez, as Ruth  climbed aboard and the mules started at a trot before she was really  seated beside him.    Ruth told him, smiling, that Mercy had taken a fancy to his looks, and  a fancy, too, to the Red Mill from her description of it. \"She wants  very much to come out there this summer--if she can be moved that  far.\"    Then Ruth tried to thank the miller for the frock--which bundle she  saw carefully placed among the other packages in the body of the  wagon--but Uncle Jabez listened very grumpily to her broken words.    \"I don't know how to thank you, sir; for of all the things I wanted  most, I believe this is the very first thing,\" Ruth said, stumblingly.  \"I really don't know how to thank you.\"    \"Don't try, then,\" he growled, but without looking at her. \"I reckon  you can thank Alviry Boggs as much as anybody. She says I owed it to  you.\"    \"Oh, Uncle--\"    \"There, there! I don't wanter hear no more about it,\" declared the  miller. But after they had rattled on for a while in silence, he said,  pursuing the former topic: \"There ain't no reason, I s'pose, why that  gal can't come out an' see you bimeby, if you want her to.\"    \"Oh, thank you, Uncle Jabez!\" cried Ruth, feeling as though something  very strange indeed must have happened to the miller to make him so  agreeable. And she tried to be chatty and pleasant with him for the  rest of the way home. But Uncle Jabez was short on conversation--he  seemed to have hoarded that up, too, and was unable to get at his  stores of small-talk. Most of his observations were mere grunts and  nods, and that evening he was just as glum and silent as ever over his  money and accounts.    Miss 'Cretia Lock arrived early on Monday morning and when Ruth came  home from school in the afternoon the wonderful dress was cut out.  They made it in two days and Aunt Alvirah washed and starched and  ironed it herself and it was ready for appearance on the last Friday  afternoon of the term, when the district school held its graduating  exercises.      CHAPTER XXII     MERCY    Ruth felt that she was not very successful at Miss Cramp's school. Not  that she had fallen behind in her studies, or failed to please her  kind instructor; but among the pupils of the upper grade she was all  but unconsidered. Perhaps, had time been given her, Ruth might have  won her way with some of the fairer-minded girls; but in the few short  weeks she had been in the district she had only managed to make  enemies among the members of her own class.    There was probably no girl in the graduating class, from Julia Semple  and Rosa Ball, down the line, who was not glad that the girl from the  Red Mill--a charity child!--was not numbered in the regular class  and had no part in the graduating exercises. Nevertheless, Ruth  proposed, if it were possible, to enter the Cheslow High School in the  fall, and to that end she was determined to work at her books--with  Miss Cramp's help--all summer.    When it came to the last day, however, and it was known that Ruth  would not come back to that school again in the autumn, the smaller  girls gathered about her and were really sorry that she was to go.  Forced out of any part with her own grade of pupils, Ruth had taken  the little ones about her and played and taught them games, had told  them stories on rainy days, and otherwise endeared herself to them.  And now the little folk made much of her on this last day, bringing  her flowers, and little presents, and clinging about her before the  afternoon session began and their parents and friends came to listen  to the exercises, in a way that was very pretty to behold.    Aunt Alvirah wanted to come to the closing exercises of the school;  but to expect Uncle Jabez to leave the mill in business hours for any  such thing as that was altogether ridiculous to contemplate. Uncle  Jabez had, however, paid some small attention to Ruth in her new  dress. Before she started for school that last day she went to the  mill door and showed herself to the miller.    \"Well, I don't see but you look as fine as the rest of 'em,\" he said,  slowly. \"And the price ain't much. You used judgment in buying, Niece  Ruth. I'll say that much for ye.\"    This being the first word of approval the miller had ever given her,  the girl appreciated it to its full value. Since he had given her the  dress she had wished more than ever to become friendly with him. But  he was so moody and so given up to his accounts and the hoarding of  wealth, that it seemed next to impossible for the girl to get near  Uncle Jabez. Besides, he had never recovered from the bitterness  engendered by the loss of the cash-box. A heavy scowl rested upon his  brow all the time. Sometimes he sighed and shook his head when he sat  idle at the table, or on the porch in the evening; and Ruth believed  he must be mourning the money which the flood was supposed to have  swept away.    But although neither of the old folks at the Red Mill came to see the  graduating exercises, Ruth was not exactly unhappy. The little  children showing her that they liked her so well, could not fail to be  a lasting pleasure to Ruth. And Helen and Tom, with their governess,  Mrs. Murchiston, attended the exercises, and Helen sat with Ruth.    \"And we're going to take you home; the carriage will come for us,\"  Helen whispered in her ear.    \"No,\" Ruth said, shaking her head, \"I cannot go home with you. You  know, Uncle--\"    \"He is an ogre,\" whispered Helen, with vigor.    That made Ruth smile a little, and she told Helen what Mercy Curtis  called the owner of the Red Mill, and of the fancy the lame girl had  taken for Uncle Jabez. \"He is 'Dusty Miller' to Mercy, and I shouldn't  be surprised if Uncle Jabez had her out for a day or two, if the  doctor will let her come. And you mustn't call him names, I tell you.  See how good he has been to me. He gave me this new dress.\"    \"That must have hurt him awfully,\" said Helen, sharply. \"Not but that  the dress is becoming and pretty, dear. But that's the only thing he's  ever given you, I warrant--and he lost your trunk!\"    The Camerons insisted upon driving Ruth as far as the Red Mill, just  the same. Mrs. Murchiston was a very pleasant lady, and Helen and Tom  evidently thought a good deal of her.    \"I should have been glad to have you for Helen's playmate this summer,  my dear,\" said the governess to Ruth. \"And I wish you were fortunate  enough to be able to go with Helen this fall. You have just the  characteristics in your nature to balance dear Helen's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/499"],[0,"Tom Swift in the Land of Wonders; Or, The Underground Search for the Idol of (#20)"],[1,"on.  Valdez  think it maybe a charm to work evil, so he burn them up--all up!\"    \"Burned that rare map!\" gasped Tom.    \"All in fire,\" went on Tal, indicating by his hands the play of flames.  \"Valdez throw away yellow silk, and I take for my arrows so rain not  wash off poison.  I give to you, if you like, with blow gun.\"    \"No, thank you,\" answered Tom, in disappointed tones.  \"The oiled silk  is of no use without the map, and that's gone.  Whew! but this is  tough!\" he said to his chum.  \"As long as it was only stolen there was  a chance to get it back, but if it's burned, the jig is up.\"    \"It looks so,\" agreed Ned.  \"We'd better get back and tell the  professor.  It he can't get along without the map it's time he started  a movement toward getting another.  So it wasn't Beecher, after all,  who got it.\"    \"Evidently not,\" assented Tom.  \"But I believe him capable of it.\"    \"You haven't much use for him,\" remarked Ned.    \"Huh!\" was all the answer given by his chum.    \"I am sorry, Senors,\" went on Tal, \"but I could not stop Valdez, and  the burning of the papers----\"    \"No, you could not help it,\" interrupted the young inventor.  \"But it  just happens that it brings bad luck to us.  You see, Tal, the papers  in this yellow covering, told of an old buried city that the  bald-headed professor--the-man-with-no-hair-on-his-head--is very  anxious to discover.  It is somewhere under the ground,\" and he waved  to the jungle all about them, pointing earthwards.    \"Paper Valdez burn tell of lost city?\" asked Tal, his face lighting up.    \"Yes.  But now, of course, we can't tell where to dig for it.\"    The Indian turned to his wife and talked rapidly with her in their own  dialect.  She, too, seemed greatly excited, making quick gestures.  Finally she ran out of the hut.    \"Where is she going?\" asked Tom suspiciously.    \"To get her grandfather.  He very old Indian.  He know story of buried  cities under trees.  Very old story--what you call legend, maybe.  But  Goosal know.  He tell same as his grandfather told him.  You wait.  Goosal come, and you listen.\"    \"Good, Ned!\" suddenly cried Tom.  \"Maybe, we'll get on the track of  lost Kurzon after all, through some ancient Indian legend.  Maybe we  won't need the map!\"    \"It hardly seems possible,\" said Ned slowly.  \"What can these Indians  know of buried cities that were out of existence before Columbus came  here?  Why, they haven't any written history.\"    \"No, and that may be just the reason they are more likely to be right,\"  returned Tom.  \"Legends handed down from one grandfather to another go  back a good many hundred years.  If they were written they might be  destroyed as the professor's map was.  Somehow or other, though I can't  tell why, I begin to see daylight ahead of us.\"    \"I wish I did,\" remarked Ned.    \"Here comes Goosal I think,\" murmured Tom, and he pointed to an Indian,  bent with the weight of years, who, led by Tal's wife, was slowly  approaching the hut.          CHAPTER XXI    THE CAVERN      \"Now Goosal can tell you,\" said Tal, evidently pleased that he had, in  a measure, solved the problem caused by the burning of the professor's  map.  \"Goosal very old Indian.  He know old stories--legends--very old.\"    \"Well, if he can tell us how to find the buried city of Kurzon and  the--the things in it,\" said Tom, \"he's all right!\"    The aged Indian proceeded slowly toward the hut where the impatient  youths awaited him.    \"I know what you seek in the buried city,\" remarked Tal.    \"Do you?\" cried Tom, wondering if some one had indiscreetly spoken of  the idol of gold.    \"Yes you want pieces of rock, with strange writings on them, old  weapons, broken pots.  I know.  I have helped white men before.\"    \"Yes, those are the things we want,\" agreed Tom, with a glance at his  chum.  \"That is--some of them.  But does your wife's grandfather talk  our language?\"    \"No, but I can tell you what he says.\"    By this time the old man, led by \"Mrs. Tal\"--as the young men called  the wife of the Indian they had helped--entered the hut.  He seemed  nervous and shy, and glanced from Tom and Ned to his grandson-in-law,  as the latter talked rapidly in the Indian dialect.  Then Goosal made  answer, but what it was all about the boys could not tell.    \"Goosal say,\" translated Tal, \"that he know a story of a very old city  away down under ground.\"    \"Tell us about it!\" urged Tom eagerly.    But a difficulty very soon developed.  Tal's intentions were good, but  he was not equal to the task of translating.  Nor was the understanding  of Tom and Ned of Spanish quite up to the mark.    \"Say, this is too much for me!\" exclaimed Tom.  \"We are losing the most  valuable part of this by not understanding what Goosal says, and what  Tal translates.\"    \"What can we do?\" asked Ned.    \"Get the professor here as soon as possible.  He can manage this  dialect, and he'll get the information at first hand.  If Goosal can  tell where to begin excavating for the city he ought to tell the  professor, not us.\"    \"That's right,\" agreed Ned.  \"We'll bring the professor here as soon as  we can.\"    Accordingly they stopped the somewhat difficult task of listening to  the translated story and told Tal, as well as they could, that they  would bring the \"man-with-no-hair-on-his-head\" to listen to the tale.    This seemed to suit the Indians, all of whom in the small colony  appeared to be very grateful to Tom and Ned for having saved the life  of Tal.    \"That was a good shot you made when you bowled over the jaguar,\" said  Ned, as the two young explorers started back to their camp.    \"Better than I realized, if it leads to the discovery of Kurzon and the  idol of gold,\" remarked Tom.    \"And to think we should come across the oiled-silk holding the poisoned  arrows!\" went on Ned.  \"That's the strangest part of the whole affair.  If it hadn't been that you shot the jaguar this never would have come  about.\"    That Professor Bumper was astonished, and Mr. Damon likewise, when they  heard the story of Tom and Ned, is stating it mildly.    \"Come on!\" exclaimed the scientist, as Tom finished, \"we must see this  Goosal at once.  If my map is destroyed, and it seems to be, this old  Indian may be our only hope.  Where did he say the buried city was,  Tom?\"    \"Oh, somewhere in this vicinity, as nearly as I could make out.  But  you'd better talk with him yourself.  We didn't say anything about the  idol of gold.\"    \"That's right.  It's just as well to let the natives think we are only  after ordinary relics.\"    \"Bless my insurance policy!\" gasped Mr. Damon.  \"It does not seem  possible that we are on the right track.\"    \"Well, I think we are, from what little information Goosal gave us,\"  remarked Tom.  \"This buried city of his must be a wonderful place.\"    \"It is, if it is what I take it to be,\" agreed the professor.  \"I told  you I would bring you to a land of wonders, Tom Swift, and they have  hardly begun yet.  Come, I am anxious to talk to Goosal.\"    In order that the Indians in the Bumper camp might not hear rumors of  the new plan to locate the hidden city, and, at the same time, to keep  rumors from spreading to the camp of the rivals, the scientist and his  friends started a new shaft, and put a shift of men at work on it.    \"We'll pretend we are on the right track, and very busy,\" said Tom.  \"That will fool Beecher.\"    \"Are you glad to know he did not take your map Professor Bumper?\" asked  Mr. Damon.    \"Well, yes.  It is hard to believe such things of a fellow scientist.\"    \"If he didn't take it he wanted to,\" said Tom.  \"And he has done, or  will do, things as unsportsmanlike.\"    \"Oh, you are hardly fair, perhaps, Tom,\" commented Ned.    \"Um!\" was all the answer he received.    With the Indians in camp busy on the excavation work, and having  ascertained that similar work was going on in the Beecher outfit,  Professor Bumper, with Mr. Damon and the young men, set off to visit  the Indian village and listen to Goosal's story.  They passed the place  where Tom had slain the jaguar, but nothing was left but the bones; the  ants, vultures and jungle animals having picked them clean in the night.    On the arrival of Tom and his friends at the Indian's hut, Goosal told,  in language which Professor Bumper could understand, the ancient legend  of the buried city as he had had it from his grandfather.    \"But is that all you know about it, Goosal?\" asked the savant.    \"No, Learned One.  It is true most of what I have told you was told to  me by my father and his father's father.  But I--I myself--with these  eyes, have looked upon the lost city.\"    \"You have!\" cried the professor, this time in English.  \"Where?  When?  Take us to it!  How do you get here?\"    \"Through the cavern of the dead,\" was the answer when the questions  were modified.    \"Bless my diamond ring!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, when Professor Bumper  translated the reply.  \"What does he mean?\"    And then, after some talk, this information came out.  Years before,  when Goosal was a young man, he had been taken by his grandfather on a  journey through the jungle.  They stopped one day at the foot of a high  mountain, and, clearing away the brush and stones at a certain place,  an entrance to a great cavern was revealed.  This, it appeared, was the  Indian burial ground, and had been used for generations.    Goosal, though in fear and trembling, was lead through it, and came to  another cavern, vaster than the first.  And there he saw strange and  wonderful sights, for it was the remains of a buried city, that had  once been the home of a great and powerful tribe unlike the  Indians--the ancient Mayas it would seem.    \"Can you take us to this cavern?\" asked the professor.    \"Yes,\" answered Goosal.  \"I will lead to it those who saved the life of  Tal--them and their friends.  I will take you to the lost city!\"    \"Good!\" cried Mr. Damon, when this had been translated.  \"Now let  Beecher"]]]
