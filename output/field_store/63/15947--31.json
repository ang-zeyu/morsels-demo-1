Our doctors were about to take their leave, when Mr Allworthy, having  given over the captain, and acquiesced in the Divine will, began to  enquire after his sister, whom he desired them to visit before their  departure.    This lady was now recovered of her fit, and, to use the common phrase,  as well as could be expected for one in her condition. The doctors,  therefore, all previous ceremonies being complied with, as this was a  new patient, attended, according to desire, and laid hold on each of  her hands, as they had before done on those of the corpse.    The case of the lady was in the other extreme from that of her  husband: for as he was past all the assistance of physic, so in  reality she required none.    There is nothing more unjust than the vulgar opinion, by which  physicians are misrepresented, as friends to death. On the contrary, I  believe, if the number of those who recover by physic could be opposed  to that of the martyrs to it, the former would rather exceed the  latter. Nay, some are so cautious on this head, that, to avoid a  possibility of killing the patient, they abstain from all methods of  curing, and prescribe nothing but what can neither do good nor harm. I  have heard some of these, with great gravity, deliver it as a maxim,  \"That Nature should be left to do her own work, while the physician  stands by as it were to clap her on the back, and encourage her when  she doth well.\"    So little then did our doctors delight in death, that they discharged  the corpse after a single fee; but they were not so disgusted with  their living patient; concerning whose case they immediately agreed,  and fell to prescribing with great diligence.    Whether, as the lady had at first persuaded her physicians to believe  her ill, they had now, in return, persuaded her to believe herself so,  I will not determine; but she continued a whole month with all the  decorations of sickness. During this time she was visited by  physicians, attended by nurses, and received constant messages from  her acquaintance to enquire after her health.    At length the decent time for sickness and immoderate grief being  expired, the doctors were discharged, and the lady began to see  company; being altered only from what she was before, by that colour  of sadness in which she had dressed her person and countenance.    The captain was now interred, and might, perhaps, have already made a  large progress towards oblivion, had not the friendship of Mr  Allworthy taken care to preserve his memory, by the following epitaph,  which was written by a man of as great genius as integrity, and one  who perfectly well knew the captain.                                  HERE LIES,                    IN EXPECTATION OF A JOYFUL RISING,                               THE BODY OF                             CAPTAIN JOHN BLIFIL.                                    LONDON                       HAD THE HONOUR OF HIS BIRTH,                                  OXFORD                            OF HIS EDUCATION.                                  HIS PARTS                     WERE AN HONOUR TO HIS PROFESSION                           AND TO HIS COUNTRY:                        HIS LIFE, TO HIS RELIGION                            AND HUMAN NATURE.                          HE WAS A DUTIFUL SON,                            A TENDER HUSBAND,                         AN AFFECTIONATE FATHER,                           A MOST KIND BROTHER,                            A SINCERE FRIEND,                           A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN,                             AND A GOOD MAN.

BOOK III.    CONTAINING THE MOST MEMORABLE TRANSACTIONS WHICH PASSED IN THE FAMILY  OF MR ALLWORTHY, FROM THE TIME WHEN TOMMY JONES ARRIVED AT THE AGE OF  FOURTEEN, TILL HE ATTAINED THE AGE OF NINETEEN. IN THIS BOOK THE  READER MAY PICK UP SOME HINTS CONCERNING THE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN.        Chapter i.    Containing little or nothing.      The reader will be pleased to remember, that, at the beginning of the  second book of this history, we gave him a hint of our intention to  pass over several large periods of time, in which nothing happened  worthy of being recorded in a chronicle of this kind.    In so doing, we do not only consult our own dignity and ease, but the  good and advantage of the reader: for besides that by these means we  prevent him from throwing away his time, in reading without either  pleasure or emolument, we give him, at all such seasons, an  opportunity of employing that wonderful sagacity, of which he is  master, by filling up these vacant spaces of time with his own  conjectures; for which purpose we have taken care to qualify him in  the preceding pages.    For instance, what reader but knows that Mr Allworthy felt, at first,  for the loss of his friend, those emotions of grief, which on such  occasions enter into all men whose hearts are not composed of flint,  or their heads of as solid materials? Again, what reader doth not know  that philosophy and religion in time moderated, and at last  extinguished, this grief? The former of these teaching the folly and  vanity of it, and the latter correcting it as unlawful, and at the  same time assuaging it, by raising future hopes and assurances, which  enable a strong and religious mind to take leave of a friend, on his  deathbed, with little less indifference than if he was preparing for a  long journey; and, indeed, with little less hope of seeing him again.    Nor can the judicious reader be at a greater loss on account of Mrs  Bridget Blifil, who, he may be assured, conducted herself through the  whole season in which grief is to make its appearance on the outside  of the body, with the strictest regard to all the rules of custom and  decency, suiting the alterations of her countenance to the several  alterations of her habit: for as this changed from weeds to black,  from black to grey, from grey to white, so did her countenance change  from dismal to sorrowful, from sorrowful to sad, and from sad to  serious, till the day came in which she was allowed to return to her  former serenity.    We have mentioned these two, as examples only of the task which may be  imposed on readers of the lowest class. Much higher and harder  exercises of judgment and penetration may reasonably be expected from  the upper graduates in criticism. Many notable discoveries will, I  doubt not, be made by such, of the transactions which happened in the  family of our worthy man, during all the years which we have thought  proper to pass over: for though nothing worthy of a place in this  history occurred within that period, yet did several incidents happen  of equal importance with those reported by the daily and weekly  historians of the age; in reading which great numbers of persons  consume a considerable part of their time, very little, I am afraid,  to their emolument. Now, in the conjectures here proposed, some of the  most excellent faculties of the mind may be employed to much  advantage, since it is a more useful capacity to be able to foretel  the actions of men, in any circumstance, from their characters, than  to judge of their characters from their actions. The former, I own,  requires the greater penetration; but may be accomplished by true  sagacity with no less certainty than the latter.    As we are sensible that much the greatest part of our readers are very  eminently possessed of this quality, we have left them a space of  twelve years to exert it in; and shall now bring forth our heroe, at  about fourteen years of age, not questioning that many have been long  impatient to be introduced to his acquaintance.        Chapter ii.      The heroe of this great history appears with very bad omens. A little  tale of so LOW a kind that some may think it not worth their notice. A  word or two concerning a squire, and more relating to a gamekeeper and  a schoolmaster.    As we determined, when we first sat down to write this history, to  flatter no man, but to guide our pen throughout by the directions of  truth, we are obliged to bring our heroe on the stage in a much more  disadvantageous manner than we could wish; and to declare honestly,  even at his first appearance, that it was the universal opinion of all  Mr Allworthy's family that he was certainly born to be hanged.    Indeed, I am sorry to say there was too much reason for this  conjecture; the lad having from his earliest years discovered a  propensity to many vices, and especially to one which hath as direct a  tendency as any other to that fate which we have just now observed to  have been prophetically denounced against him: he had been already  convicted of three robberies, viz., of robbing an orchard, of stealing  a duck out of a farmer's yard, and of picking Master Blifil's pocket  of a ball.    The vices of this young man were, moreover, heightened by the  disadvantageous light in which they appeared when opposed to the  virtues of Master Blifil, his companion; a youth of so different a  cast from little Jones, that not only the family but all the  neighbourhood resounded his praises. He was, indeed, a lad of a  remarkable disposition; sober, discreet, and pious beyond his age;  qualities which gained him the love of every one who knew him: while  Tom Jones was universally disliked; and many expressed their wonder  that Mr Allworthy would suffer such a lad to be educated with his  nephew, lest the morals of the latter should be corrupted by his  example.

All freemen shall have a surety who would hand him over to justice  for his offenses or pay the damages or fines due. If an accused  man fled, his surety would have a year to find him to obtain  reimbursement.    The Conquerer proclaimed that:    No cattle shall be sold except in towns and before three  witnesses.    For the sale of ancient chattels, there must be a surety and a  warrantor.    No man shall be sold over the sea. (This ended the slave trade at  the port of Bristol.)    The death penalty for persons tried by court is abolished.                                 - Judicial Procedure -    \"Ecclesiastical\" courts were created for bishops to preside over  cases concerning the cure of souls and criminal cases, in which  the ordeal was used. When the Conquerer did not preside over this  court, an appeal could be made to him.    The hundred and county courts now sat without clergy and handled  only \"civil\" cases. They were conducted by the King's own  appointed sheriff. Only freemen and not bound villeins had  standing in this court. They continued to transact their business  in the English language.    The local jurisdictions of thegns who had grants of sac and soke  or who exercised judicial functions among their free neighbors  were now called \"manors\" under their new owners, who conducted a  manor court.    The Conquerer's Royal Court was called the \"Curia Regis\". When the  Conquerer wished to determine the national laws, he summoned  twelve elected representatives of each county to declare on oath  the ancient lawful customs and law as they existed in the time of  the popular King Edward the Confessor. The recording of this law  was begun. A person could spend months trying to catch up with the  Royal Court to present a case. Sometimes the Conquerer sent the  justiciar or commissioners to hold his Royal Court in the various  districts. The commissioner appointed groups of local men to give  a collective verdict upon oath for each trial he conducted. The  Conquerer allowed, on an ad hoc basis, certain high-level people  such as bishops and abbots and those who made a large payment, to  have land disputes decided by an inquiry of recognitors. Besides  royal issues, the Curia Regis heard appeals from lower court  decisions. It used English, Norman, feudal, Roman, and canon law  legal principles to reach a decision, and was flexible and  expeditious.    A dispute between a Norman and an English man over land or a  criminal act could be decided by trial by combat [battle]. Each  combatant first swore to the truth of his cause and undertook to  prove by his body the truth of his cause by making the other  surrender by crying \"craven\" [craving forgiveness]. The combatants  used weapons like pick-axes and shields. Presumably the man in the  wrong would not fight as well because he was burdened with a  guilty conscience. Although this trial was thought to reflect  God's will, it favored the physically fit and adept person. After  losing the trial by combat, the guilty person would be punished  appropriately.    London had its own traditions. All London citizens met at its  folkmoot, which was held three times a year to determine its  public officers, to raise matters of public concern, and to make  ordinances. Its criminal court had the power of outlawry as did  the county courts. Trade, land, and other civil issues were dealt  with by the Hustings Court, which met every Monday in the  Guildhall. The city was divided into wards, each of which was  under the charge of an elected alderman [elder man]. (The election  was by a small governing body and the most wealthy and reputable  men and not a popular election.) The aldermen had special  knowledge of the law and a duty to declare it at the Hustings  Court. Each alderman also conducted wardmoots in his ward and  decided criminal and civil issues between its residents. Within  the wards were the guilds of the city.    The Normans, as foreigners, were protected by the king's peace.  The entire hundred was the ultimate surety for murder and would  have to pay a \"murdrum\" fine of 31 pounds [46 marks] for the  murder of any Norman, if the murderer was not apprehended by his  lord within a few days. The reaction to this was that the murderer  mutilated the corpse to make identification of ethnicity  impossible. So the Conquerer ordered that every murder victim was  assumed to be Norman unless proven English. This began a court  custom in murder cases of first proving the victim to be English.    The Royal Court decided this case: \"At length both parties were  summoned before the King's court, in which there sat many of the  nobles of the land of whom Geoffrey, bishop of Coutances, was  delegated by the King's authority as judge of the dispute, with  Ranulf the Vicomte, Neel, son of Neel, Robert de Usepont, and many  other capable judges who diligently and fully examined the origin  of the dispute, and delivered judgment that the mill ought to  belong to St. Michael and his monks forever. The most victorious  King William approved and confirmed this decision.\"                                     - - - Chapter 5 - - -                                - The Times: 1100-1154 -    King Henry I, son of William the Conquerer, furthered peace  between the Normans and native English by his marriage to a niece  of King Edward the Confessor called Matilda. She married him on  condition that he grant a charter of rights undoing some practices  of the past reigns of William I and William II. Peace was also  furthered by the fact that Henry I had been born in England and  English was his native tongue. The private wars of lords were now  replaced by less serious mock battles.    Henry was a shrewd judge of character and of the course of events,  cautious before taking action, but decisive in carrying out his  plans. He was faithful and generous to his friends. He showed a  strong practical element of calculation and foresight. Although  illiterate, he was intelligent and a good administrator. He had an  efficient intelligence gathering network and an uncanny knack of  detecting hidden plans before they became conspiratorial action.  He made many able men of inferior social position nobles, thus  creating a class of career judges and administrators in opposition  to the extant hereditary aristocracy. He loved books and built a  palace at Oxford to which he invited scholars for lively  discussion.    Queen Matilda served as regent of the kingdom in Henry's absence,  as William's queen had for him. Both queens received special  coronation apart from their husbands; they held considerable  estates which they administered through their own officers, and  were frequently composed of escheated honors. Matilda was learned  and a literary patron. She founded an important literary and  scholastic center. Her compassion was great and her charities  extensive. In London she founded several almshouses and a care-  giving infirmary for lepers. These were next to small monastic  communities. She also had new roads and bridges built.    Henry issued charters restoring customs which had been  subordinated to royal impositions by previous Kings, which set a  precedent for later Kings. His coronation charter describes  certain property rights he restored after the oppressive reign of  his brother.    \"Henry, King of the English, to Samson the bishop, and Urse of  Abbetot, and to all his barons and faithful vassals, both French  and English, in Worcestershire, greeting.    [1.]  Know that by the mercy of God and by the common        counsel of the barons of the whole kingdom of England I have        been crowned king of this realm. And because the kingdom has        been oppressed by unjust exactions, I now, being moved by        reverence towards God and by the love I bear you all, make        free the Church of God; so that I will neither sell nor        lease its property; nor on the death of an archbishop or a        bishop or an abbot will I take anything from the demesne of        the Church or from its vassals during the period which        elapses before a successor is installed. I abolish all the        evil customs by which the kingdom of England has been        unjustly oppressed. Some of those evil customs are here set        forth.

Similarly the men of my barons        shall redeem their lands from their lords by means of a just        and lawful 'relief`.

And if, on the death of one of my barons or        of one of my tenants, a daughter should be his heir, I will        dispose of her in marriage and of her lands according to the        counsel given me by my barons.
