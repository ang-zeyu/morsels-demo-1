The Badawi considers himself a man only when mounted on horseback,  lance in hand, bound for a foray or a fray, and carolling some such  gaiety as    A steede! a steede of matchlesse speede!  A sword of metal keene!  All else to noble minds is drosse,  All else on earth is meane.    Even in his sports he affects those that imitate war. Preserving the  instinctive qualities which lie dormant in civilisation, he is an  admirable sportsman. The children,    [p.104] men in miniature, begin with a rude system of gymnastics when  they can walk. My young ones play upon the backs of camels, was the reply  made to me by a Jahayni Badawi when offered some Egyptian plaything.  The men pass their time principally in hawking, shooting, and riding.  The Sakr,[FN#40] I am told, is the only falcon in general use; they train  it to pursue the gazelle, which    [p.105] greyhounds pull down when fatigued. I have heard much of their  excellent marksmanship, but saw only moderate practice with a long  matchlock rested and fired at standing objects. Double-barreled guns  are rare amongst them.[FN#41] Their principal weapons are matchlocks  and firelocks, pistols, javelins, spears, swords, and the dagger called  Jambiyah; the sling and the bow have long been given up. The guns come  from Egypt, Syria, and Turkey; for the Badawi cannot make, although he  can repair, this arm. He particularly values a good old barrel seven  spans long, and would rather keep it than his coat; consequently, a  family often boasts of four or five guns, which descend from generation  to generation. Their price varies from two to sixty dollars. The  Badawin collect nitre in the country, make excellent charcoal, and  import sulphur from Egypt and India; their powder, however, is coarse  and weak. For hares and birds they cut up into slugs a bar of lead  hammered out to a convenient size, and they cast bullets in moulds.  They are fond of ball-practice, firing, as every sensible man does, at  short distances, and striving at extreme precision. They are ever  backing themselves with wagers, and will shoot for a sheep, the loser  inviting his friends to a feast: on festivals they boil the head, and  use it as mark and prize. Those who affect excellence are said to fire  at a bullet hanging by a thread; curious, however, to relate, the  Badawin of Al-Hijaz have but just learned the art, general in Persia  and Barbary, of shooting from horseback at speed.    Pistols have been lately introduced into the Hijaz, and are not common  amongst the Badawin. The citizens incline to this weapon, as it is  derived from Constantinople. In the Desert a tolerable pair with flint  locks may be worth thirty dollars, ten times their price in England.    [p.106]The spears[FN#42] called Kanat, or reeds, are made of male  bamboos imported from India. They are at least twelve feet long, iron  shod, with a tapering point, beneath which are one or two tufts of  black ostrich feathers.[FN#43] Besides the Mirzak, or javelin, they  have a spear called Shalfah, a bamboo or a palm stick garnished with a  head about the breadth of a mans hand.    No good swords are fabricated in Al-Hijaz. The Khalawiyah and other  Desert clans have made some poor attempts at blades. They are brought  from Persia, India, and Egypt; but I never saw anything of value.    The Darakah, or shield, also comes from India. It is the common Cutch  article, supposed to be made of rhinoceros hide, and displaying as much  brass knob and gold wash as possible. The Badawin still use in the  remoter parts Diraa, or coats of mail, worn by horsemen over buff  jackets.    The dagger is made in Al-Yaman and other places: it has a vast variety  of shapes, each of which, as usual, has its proper names. Generally  they are but little curved (whereas the Gadaymi of Al-Yaman and  Hazramaut is almost a semicircle), with tapering blade, wooden handle,  and scabbard of the same material overlaid with brass. At the point of  the scabbard is a round knob, and the weapon is so long, that a man  when walking cannot swing his right    [p.107] arm. In narrow places he must enter sideways. But it is the  mode always to appear in dagger, and the weapon, like the French  soldiers coupe-choux, is really useful for such bloodless purposes as  cutting wood and gathering grass. In price they vary from one to thirty  dollars.    The Badawin boast greatly of sword-play; but it is apparently confined  to delivering a tremendous slash, and to jumping away from the  return-cut instead of parrying either with sword or shield. The  citizens have learned the Turkish scimitar-play, which, in  grotesqueness and general absurdity, rivals the East Indian school.  None of these Orientals knows the use of the point which characterises  the highest school of swordsmanship.    The Hijazi Badawin have no game of chance, and dare not, I am told,  ferment the juice of the Daum palm, as proximity to Aden has taught the  wild men of Al-Yaman.[FN#44] Their music is in a rude state. The  principal instrument is the Tabl, or kettle-drum, which is of two  kinds: one, the smaller, used at festivals; the other, a large copper  tom-tom, for martial purposes, covered with leather, and played upon,  pulpit-like, with fist, and not with stick. Besides which, they have  the one-stringed Rubabah, or guitar, that monotonous but charming  instrument of the Desert. In another place I have described their  dancing, which is an ignoble spectacle.    The Badawin of Al-Hijaz have all the knowledge necessary for procuring  and protecting the riches of savage life. They are perfect in the  breeding, the training, and the selling of cattle. They know sufficient  of astronomy to guide themselves by night, and are acquainted    [p.108] with the names of the principal stars. Their local memory is  wonderful. And such is their instinct in the art of asar, or tracking,  that it is popularly said of the Zubayd clan, which lives between  Meccah and Al-Madinah, a man will lose a she-camel and know her  four-year-old colt by its foot. Always engaged in rough exercises and  perilous journeys, they have learned a kind of farriery and a simple  system of surgery. In cases of fracture they bind on splints with cloth  bands, and the patient drinks camels milk and clarified butter till he  is cured. Cuts are carefully washed, sprinkled with meal gunpowder, and  sewn up. They dress gunshot wounds with raw camels flesh, and rely  entirely upon nature and diet. When bitten by snakes or stung by  scorpions, they scarify the wound with a razor, recite a charm, and  apply to it a dressing of garlic.[FN#45] The wealthy have Fiss or  ring-stones, brought from India, and used with a formula of prayer to  extract venom. Some few possess the Tariyak (Theriack) of Al-Irakthe  great counter-poison, internal as well as external, of the East. The  poorer classes all wear the Zaal or Hibas of Al-Yaman; two yarns of  black sheeps wool tied round the leg, under the knee and above the  ankle. When bitten, the sufferer tightens these cords above the injured  part, which he immediately scarifies; thus they act as tourniquets.  These ligatures also cure crampsand there is no other remedy. The Badawi  knowledge of medicine is unusually limited in this part of Arabia,  where even simples are not required by a people who rise with dawn, eat  little, always breathe Desert air, and at night make the camels their  curfew. The great tonic is clarified butter, and the Kay, or actual  cautery, is used even for rheumatism. This counter-irritant, together  with a curious and artful phlebotomy,    [p.109] blood being taken, as by the Italians, from the toes, the  fingers, and other parts of the body, are the Arab panaceas. They treat  scald-head with grease and sulphur. Ulcers, which here abound, without,  however, assuming the fearful type of the Helcoma Yemenense, are  cauterised and stimulated by verdigris. The evil of which Fracastorius  sang is combated by sudorifics, by unguents of oil and sulphur, and  especially by the sand-bath. The patient, buried up to the neck,  remains in the sun fasting all day; in the evening he is allowed a  little food. This rude course of packing lasts for about a month. It  suits some constitutions; but others, especially Europeans, have tried  the sand-bath and died of fever. Mules teeth, roasted and imperfectly  pounded, remove cataract. Teeth are extracted by the farriers pincers,  and the worm which throughout the East is supposed to produce  toothache, falls by fumigation. And, finally, after great fatigue, or  when suffering from cold, the body is copiously greased with clarified  butter and exposed to a blazing fire.    Mohammed and his followers conquered only the more civilised Badawin;  and there is even to this day little or no religion amongst the wild  people, except those on the coast or in the vicinity of cities. The  faith of the Badawi comes from Al-Islam, whose hold is weak. But his  customs and institutions, the growth of his climate, his nature, and  his wants, are still those of his ancestors, cherished ere Meccah had  sent forth a Prophet, and likely to survive the day when every vestige  of the Kaabah shall have disappeared. Of this nature are the Hijazis  pagan oaths, his heathenish names (few being Moslem except Mohammed), his  ordeal of licking red-hot iron, his Salkh, or scarification,proof of  manliness,his blood revenge, and his eating carrion (i.e., the body of  an animal killed without the usual formula), and his lending his wives  to strangers. All these I hold to be remnants of some old    [p.110] creed; nor should I despair of finding among the Badawin  bordering upon the Great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4664"],[0,"Light, Life, and Love: Selections from the German Mystics of the Middle Ages (#20)"],[1,"  beautiful affection. My breath is sweeter than honey, and my  inheritance above honey and the honeycomb.\" \"Wine and music rejoice  the heart, and above both is the love of Wisdom.\"[44] Of a surety, O  Lord, Thou showest Thyself so lovable and desirable, that it is no  wonder that the hearts of all long for Thee, and are tormented by  the desire of Thee. Thy words breathe love, and flow so sweetly,  that in many hearts the love of temporal things has wholly dried up.  Therefore, I greatly long to hear Thee speak of Thy lovableness.  Come, O Lord, my only comfort, speak to the heart of Thy servant.  For I sleep sweetly beneath Thy shadow, and my heart is awake.    Wisdom. Hear, My son, and see; incline thine ear, forgetting thyself  and all other things. Lo, I in Myself am that ineffable Good, which  is and ever was; which has never been expressed nor ever will be.  For although I give Myself to be felt by men in their inmost hearts,  yet no tongue can ever declare or explain in words what I am. For  verily all the beauty, grace, and adornment which can be conceived  by thee or by others, exists in me far more excellently, more  pleasantly, more copiously, than any one could say in words. I am  the most loving Word of the Father, begotten from the pure substance  of the Father, and wondrously pleasing am I to His loving eyes in  the sweet and burning love of the Holy Spirit. I am the throne of  happiness, the crown of souls: most bright are Mine eyes, most  delicate My mouth, My cheeks are red and white, and all My  appearance is full of grace and loveliness. All the heavenly host  gaze upon Me with wonder and admiration; their eyes are ever fixed  upon Me, their hearts rest in Me, their minds turn to Me and turn  again. O thrice and four times happy is he, to whom it shall be  given to celebrate this play of love amid heavenly joys at My side,  holding My tender hands in happiest security, for ever and ever to  all eternity. Only the word that proceeds out of My sweet mouth  surpasses the melodies of all the angels, the sweet harmony of all  harps, and musical instruments of every kind....    Servitor. There are three things, O Lord, at which I marvel greatly.  The first is, that although Thou art in Thyself so exceedingly  loving, yet towards sin Thou art a most severe judge and avenger.  Alas, Thy face in wrath is too terrible; the words which Thou  speakest in anger pierce the heart and soul like fire. O holy and  adorable God, save me from Thy wrathful countenance, and defer not  till the future life my punishment.    Wisdom. I am the unchangeable Good, remaining always the same. The  reason why I do not appear always the same, is on account of those  who do not behold Me in the same way. By nature I am friendly; yet  none the less I punish vice severely, so that I deserve to be  feared. From My friends I require a pure and filial fear, and a  friendly love, that fear may ever restrain them from sin, and that  love may join them to Me in unbroken loyalty.    Servitor. What Thou sayest pleases me, O Lord, and it is as I would  have it. But there is another thing at which I greatly marvel--how  it is that when the soul is faint from desire of the sweetness of  Thy presence, Thou art wholly mute, and dost not utter a single word  that can be heard. And who, O Lord, would not be grieved, when Thou  showest Thyself so strange, so silent, to the soul that loves Thee  above all things?    Wisdom. And yet all the creatures speak of Me.    Servitor. But that is by no means enough for the soul that loves.    Wisdom. Also every word that is uttered about Me is a message of My  love; all the voices of holy Scripture that are written about Me are  letters of love, sweet as honey. They are to be received as if I had  written them Myself. Ought not this to satisfy thee?    Servitor. Nay but, O most holy God, dearest Friend of all to me,  Thou knowest well that a heart which is on fire with love is not  satisfied with anything that is not the Beloved himself, in whom is  its only comfort. Even though all the tongues of all the angelic  spirits were to speak to me, none the less would my unquenchable  love continue to yearn and strive for the one thing which it  desires. The soul that loves Thee would choose Thee rather than the  kingdom of heaven. Pardon me, O Lord: it would become Thee to show  more kindness to those who love Thee so ardently, who sigh and look  up to Thee and say: Return, return! Who anxiously debate with  themselves: alas, thinkest thou that thou hast offended Him? That He  has deserted thee? Thinkest thou that He will ever restore thee His  most sweet presence, that thou wilt ever again embrace Him with the  arms of Thy heart, and press Him to thy breast, that all thy grief  and trouble may vanish? All this, O Lord, Thou hearest and knowest,  and yet Thou art silent.    Wisdom. Certainly I know all this, and I watch it with great  pleasure. But I would have thee also answer a few questions, since  thy wonder, though veiled, is so great. What is it which gives the  greatest joy to the highest of all created spirits?     Servitor. Ah, Lord, this question is beyond my range. I prithee,  answer it Thyself.    Wisdom. I will do as thou desirest. The highest angelic spirit finds  nothing more desirable or more delightful than to satisfy My will in  all things; so much so, that if he knew that it would redound to My  praise for him to root out nettles and tares, he would diligently  fulfil this task in preference to all others.    Servitor. Of a truth, Lord, this answer of Thine touches me sharply.  I perceive that it is Thy will that I should be resigned in the  matter of receiving and feeling tokens of Thy love, and that I  should seek Thy glory alone, in dryness and hardness as well as in  sweetness.    Wisdom. No resignation is more perfect or more excellent, than to be  resigned in dereliction.     Servitor. And yet, O Lord, the pain is very grievous.    Wisdom. Wherein is virtue proved, if not in adversity? But be  assured, that I often come, and try whether the door into My house  is open, but find Myself repulsed. Many times I am received like a  stranger, harshly treated, and then driven out of doors. Nay, I not  only come to the soul that loves me, but tarry with her like a  friend; but that is done so secretly, that none know it save those  who live quite detached and separated from men, and observe My ways,  and care only to please and satisfy My grace. For according to My  Divinity I am purest Spirit, and I am received spiritually in pure  spirits.    Servitor. So far as I understand, Lord God, Thou art a very secret  Lover. How glad would I be if Thou wouldest give me some signs, by  which I might know Thee to be truly present.    Wisdom. By no other way canst thou know the certainty of My presence  better, than when I hide Myself from thee, and withdraw what is Mine  from thy soul. Then at last thou knowest by experience what I am,  and what thou art. Of a surety I am everlasting Good, without whom  no one can have anything good. When therefore I impart that immense  Good, which is Myself, generously and lovingly, and scatter it  abroad, all things to which I communicate Myself are clothed with a  certain goodness, by which My presence can be as easily inferred, as  that of the Sun, the actual ball of which cannot be seen, by its  rays. If therefore thou ever feelest My presence, enter into  thyself, and learn how to separate the roses from the thorns, the  flowers from the weeds.    Servitor. Lord, I do search, and I find within myself a great  diversity. When I am deserted by Thee, my soul is like a sick man,  whose taste is spoiled. Nothing pleases me, but all things disgust  me. My body is torpid, my mind oppressed; within is dryness, without  is sadness. All that I see or hear, however good in reality, is  distasteful and hateful to me. I am easily led into sins; I am weak  to resist my enemies; I am cold or lukewarm towards all good.  Whoever comes to me, finds my house empty. For the House-Father is  away, who knows how to counsel for the best, and to inspire the  whole household. On the other hand, when the day-star arises in my  inmost heart, all the pain quickly vanishes, all the darkness is  dispelled, and a great brightness arises and shines forth. My heart  laughs, my mind is exalted, my soul becomes cheerful, all things  around me are blithe and merry; whatever is around me and within me  is turned to Thy praise. That which before seemed hard, difficult,  irksome, impossible, becomes suddenly easy and pleasant. To give  myself to fasting, watching, and prayer, to suffer or abstain or  avoid, in a word all the hardnesses of life seem when compared with  Thy presence to have no irksomeness at all. My soul is bathed in  radiance, truth, and sweetness, so that all its labours are  forgotten. My heart delights itself in abundant sweet meditations,  my tongue learns to speak of high things, my body is brisk and ready  for any undertaking; whoever comes to ask my advice, takes back with  him high counsels such as he desired to hear. In short, I seem to  myself to have transcended the limits of time and space, and to be  standing on the threshold of eternal bliss. But who, O Lord, can  secure for me, that I may be long in this state? Alas, in a moment  it is withdrawn from me; and for a long space again I am left as  naked and destitute as if I had never experienced anything of the  kind; till at last, after many and deep sighings of heart, it is  restored to me. Is this Thou, O Lord, or rather I myself? Or what is  it?    Wisdom. Of thyself thou hast nothing except faults and defects.  Therefore that about which thou askest is I Myself, and this is the  play of love.    Servitor. What is the play of love?    Wisdom. So long as the loved one is present with the lover, the  lover knoweth not how dear the loved one is to him; it is only  separation which can teach him that.    Servitor. "]]]
