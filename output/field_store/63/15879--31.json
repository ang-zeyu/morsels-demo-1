Even while the King was still yelling for help his throne room became  emptied of every one of his warriors, and before the monarch had  managed to clear the egg away from his left eye the Scarecrow threw the  second egg against his right eye, where it smashed and blinded him  entirely.  The King was unable to flee because he could not see which  way to run; so he stood still and howled and shouted and screamed in  abject fear.    While this was going on, Billina flew over to Dorothy, and perching  herself upon the Lion's back the hen whispered eagerly to the girl:    \"Get his belt!  Get the Nome King's jeweled belt!  It unbuckles in the  back.  Quick, Dorothy--quick!\"          18.  The Fate of the Tin Woodman      Dorothy obeyed.  She ran at once behind the Nome King, who was still  trying to free his eyes from the egg, and in a twinkling she had  unbuckled his splendid jeweled belt and carried it away with her to her  place beside the Tiger and Lion, where, because she did not know what  else to do with it, she fastened it around her own slim waist.    Just then the Chief Steward rushed in with a sponge and a bowl of  water, and began mopping away the broken eggs from his master's face.  In a few minutes, and while all the party stood looking on, the King  regained the use of his eyes, and the first thing he did was to glare  wickedly upon the Scarecrow and exclaim:    \"I'll make you suffer for this, you hay-stuffed dummy!  Don't you know  eggs are poison to Nomes?\"    \"Really,\" said the Scarecrow, \"they DON'T seem to agree with you,  although I wonder why.\"    \"They were strictly fresh and above suspicion,\" said Billina.  \"You  ought to be glad to get them.\"    \"I'll transform you all into scorpions!\" cried the King, angrily, and  began waving his arms and muttering magic words.    But none of the people became scorpions, so the King stopped and looked  at them in surprise.    \"What's wrong?\" he asked.    \"Why, you are not wearing your magic belt,\" replied the Chief Steward,  after looking the King over carefully.  \"Where is it?  What have you  done with it?\"    The Nome King clapped his hand to his waist, and his rock colored face  turned white as chalk.    \"It's gone,\" he cried, helplessly.  \"It's gone, and I am ruined!\"    Dorothy now stepped forward and said:    \"Royal Ozma, and you, Queen of Ev, I welcome you and your people back  to the land of the living.  Billina has saved you from your troubles,  and now we will leave this drea'ful place, and return to Ev as soon as  poss'ble.\"    While the child spoke they could all see that she wore the magic belt,  and a great cheer went up from all her friends, which was led by the  voices of the Scarecrow and the private.  But the Nome King did not  join them.  He crept back onto his throne like a whipped dog, and lay  there bitterly bemoaning his defeat.    \"But we have not yet found my faithful follower, the Tin Woodman,\" said  Ozma to Dorothy, \"and without him I do not wish to go away.\"    \"Nor I,\" replied Dorothy, quickly.  \"Wasn't he in the palace?\"    \"He must be there,\" said Billina; \"but I had no clue to guide me in  guessing the Tin Woodman, so I must have missed him.\"    \"We will go back into the rooms,\" said Dorothy.  \"This magic belt, I am  sure, will help us to find our dear old friend.\"    So she re-entered the palace, the doors of which still stood open, and  everyone followed her except the Nome King, the Queen of Ev and Prince  Evring.  The mother had taken the little Prince in her lap and was  fondling and kissing him lovingly, for he was her youngest born.    But the others went with Dorothy, and when she came to the middle of  the first room the girl waved her hand, as she had seen the King do,  and commanded the Tin Woodman, whatever form he might then have, to  resume his proper shape.  No result followed this attempt, so Dorothy  went into another room and repeated it, and so through all the rooms of  the palace.  Yet the Tin Woodman did not appear to them, nor could they  imagine which among the thousands of ornaments was their transformed  friend.    Sadly they returned to the throne room, where the King, seeing that  they had met with failure, jeered at Dorothy, saying:    \"You do not know how to use my belt, so it is of no use to you.  Give  it back to me and I will let you go free--you and all the people who  came with you.  As for the royal family of Ev, they are my slaves, and  shall remain here.\"    \"I shall keep the belt,\" said Dorothy.    \"But how can you escape, without my consent?\"  asked the King.    \"Easily enough,\" answered the girl.  \"All we need to do is to walk out  the way that we came in.\"    \"Oh, that's all, is it?\" sneered the King.  \"Well, where is the passage  through which you entered this room?\"    They all looked around, but could not discover the place, for it had  long since been closed.  Dorothy, however, would not be dismayed.  She  waved her hand toward the seemingly solid wall of the cavern and said:    \"I command the passage to open!\"    Instantly the order was obeyed; the opening appeared and the passage  lay plainly before them.    The King was amazed, and all the others overjoyed.    \"Why, then, if the belt obeys you, were we unable to discover the Tin  Woodman?\" asked Ozma.    \"I can't imagine,\" said Dorothy.    \"See here, girl,\" proposed the King, eagerly; \"give me the belt, and I  will tell you what shape the Tin Woodman was changed into, and then you  can easily find him.\"    Dorothy hesitated, but Billina cried out:    \"Don't you do it!  If the Nome King gets the belt again he will make  every one of us prisoners, for we will be in his power.  Only by  keeping the belt, Dorothy, will you ever be able to leave this place in  safety.\"    \"I think that is true,\" said the Scarecrow.  \"But I have another idea,  due to my excellent brains.  Let Dorothy transform the King into a  goose-egg unless he agrees to go into the palace and bring out to us  the ornament which is our friend Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman.\"    \"A goose-egg!\" echoed the horrified King.  \"How dreadful!\"    \"Well, a goose-egg you will be unless you go and fetch us the ornament  we want,\" declared Billina, with a joyful chuckle.    \"You can see for yourself that Dorothy is able to use the magic belt  all right,\" added the Scarecrow.    The Nome King thought it over and finally consented, for he did not  want to be a goose-egg.  So he went into the palace to get the ornament  which was the transformation of the Tin Woodman, and they all awaited  his return with considerable impatience, for they were anxious to leave  this underground cavern and see the sunshine once more.  But when the  Nome King came back he brought nothing with him except a puzzled and  anxious expression upon his face.    \"He's gone!\" he said.  \"The Tin Woodman is nowhere in the palace.\"    \"Are you sure?\" asked Ozma, sternly.    \"I'm very sure,\" answered the King, trembling, \"for I know just what I  transformed him into, and exactly where he stood.  But he is not there,  and please don't change me into a goose-egg, because I've done the best  I could.\"    They were all silent for a time, and then Dorothy said:    \"There is no use punishing the Nome King any more, and I'm 'fraid we'll  have to go away without our friend.\"    \"If he is not here, we cannot rescue him,\" agreed the Scarecrow, sadly.  \"Poor Nick!  I wonder what has become of him.\"    \"And he owed me six weeks back pay!\" said one of the generals, wiping  the tears from his eyes with his gold-laced coat sleeve.    Very sorrowfully they determined to return to the upper world without  their former companion, and so Ozma gave the order to begin the march  through the passage.    The army went first, and then the royal family of Ev, and afterward  came Dorothy, Ozma, Billina, the Scarecrow and Tiktok.    They left the Nome King scowling at them from his throne, and had no  thought of danger until Ozma chanced to look back and saw a large  number of the warriors following them in full chase, with their swords  and spears and axes raised to strike down the fugitives as soon as they  drew near enough.    Evidently the Nome King had made this last attempt to prevent their  escaping him; but it did him no good, for when Dorothy saw the danger  they were in she stopped and waved her hand and whispered a command to  the magic belt.    Instantly the foremost warriors became eggs, which rolled upon the  floor of the cavern in such numbers that those behind could not advance  without stepping upon them.  But, when they saw the eggs, all desire to  advance departed from the warriors, and they turned and fled madly into  the cavern, and refused to go back again.    Our friends had no further trouble in reaching the end of the passage,  and soon were standing in the outer air upon the gloomy path between  the two high mountains.  But the way to Ev lay plainly before them, and  they fervently hoped that they had seen the last of the Nome King and  of his dreadful palace.    The cavalcade was led by Ozma, mounted on the Cowardly Lion, and the  Queen of Ev, who rode upon the back of the Tiger.  The children of the  Queen walked behind her, hand in hand.  Dorothy rode the Sawhorse,  while the Scarecrow walked and commanded the army in the absence of the  Tin Woodman.    Presently the way began to lighten and more of the sunshine to come in  between the two mountains.  And before long they heard the \"thump!  thump! thump!\" of the giant's hammer upon the road.    \"How may we pass the monstrous man of iron?\" asked the Queen, anxious  for the safety of her children.  But Dorothy solved the problem by a  word to the magic belt.    The giant paused, with his hammer held motionless in the air, thus  allowing the entire party to pass between his cast-iron legs in safety.          19.

It moved west off  the beach 100 yards, pivoted to the right, and began to move up the  Cataisan Peninsula. The squadron was expected to secure the peninsula  and the airstrip with great speed. Engineer units had landed just  behind it and were waiting to start work on the airstrip as soon as  it was seized. The 1st Squadron met with only light enemy opposition,  the chief obstacles being the swamps, unoccupied pillboxes--each  of which had to be checked--and the numerous Filipino shacks that  afforded possible protection to the enemy. By 1600 the squadron had  secured the airstrip and the Cataisan Peninsula. [231] Later in the  afternoon the squadron, less Troop A, was withdrawn from the peninsula.    The 5th and 12th Cavalry Regiments landed on White Beach without  incident at exactly 1000. Immediately beyond the narrow landing  beach was a deep swamp through which the regiments must move to reach  Highway 1. The morass was often waist deep, in places even up to the  armpits, and men of the advancing line of troops cursed heartily as  they floundered toward the highway. [232] Under such circumstances it  was impossible for the men to carry all of their personal equipment,  and they had to make three trips in order to complete the crossing of  certain areas. At 1100 a reconnaissance platoon of the 5th Cavalry  Regiment made physical contact with elements of the 34th Infantry,  24th Division, on its left. By 1500 both cavalry regiments were  on Highway 1. They pushed westward immediately toward the next  objective--the foothills west of the highway. [233] Col. Royce  E. Drake, the commanding officer of the 5th Cavalry Regiment, went  forward with a patrol from F Troop. At 1900, about three quarters of  a mile south of Caibaan, the patrol made contact with the enemy. In  the ensuing fight ten Japanese and one American were killed and two  Americans wounded. At 1915 the 12th Cavalry Regiment closed in on  its A-Day objective and formed its night perimeter. [234] The 5th  Cavalry Regiment formed its night perimeter at 2135, a few hundred  yards short of the objective. [235]    The first elements of the 8th Cavalry Regiment, 2d Cavalry Brigade,  the corps reserve, moved to White Beach at 1040, and by 1130 the entire  reserve regiment was ashore. The regiment continued in corps reserve  throughout the day and spent its first night in the Philippines on  the western edge of San Jose. [236]    At 1400 General Mudge assumed command ashore of the 1st Cavalry  Division and by 1630 had established the divisional command post  at San Jose. [237] Preceded by a ground reconnaissance of the unit  commanders, all of the 1st Cavalry Division artillery landed on White  Beach at 1330 and immediately established a position in the vicinity  of San Jose. Before nightfall all battalions had registered and were  prepared to fire, and beginning at 2115 the 61st Field Artillery  Battalion throughout the night delivered harassing fire on the  hills south of Tacloban. [238] By the end of the day the division  had secured the Cataisan Peninsula and the Tacloban airstrip and,  after crossing Highway 1, had made physical contact with the right  flank of the 24th Infantry Division. [239]    24th Infantry Division [240]    In the southern part of the X Corps zone, to the left of the 1st  Cavalry Division, the 24th Infantry Division (less the 21st Infantry),  under Maj. Gen. Frederick A. Irving, was to land on Red Beach on the  morning of A Day. [241] Although there were no underwater obstacles,  mines, or barbed wire along Red Beach, the water was too shallow to  permit vessels the size of LST's to come in and make a dry landing. Red  Beach was narrow but consisted of firm sand. Back of it was flat,  marshy ground covered with palm trees and jungle growth, extending  inland in a southwesterly direction from the northern end of the  beach. General Makino had converted a small stream bed in this area  into a wide and deep tank trap which paralleled the beach for 1,500  yards. Several large, well-camouflaged pillboxes, connected by tunnels  and constructed of palm logs and earth, were scattered throughout the  area. Between the swamp and a low range of hills one and a quarter  miles inland were open fields and rice paddies. The most prominent  terrain feature was Hill 522 just north of Palo. This hill commanded  the beach area, the town of Palo, and Highway 2, leading into the  interior. It was partly wooded, and the 33d Infantry Regiment had  interlaced it with tunnels, trenches, and pillboxes.    From the beach a single deeply rutted and muddy exit road ran south  to the Palo River, where it turned westward to Highway 1. The river  was just north of the town of Palo and roughly paralleled Highway 2,  which ran in a northwesterly direction from Palo into the interior,  between the hills dominating this entrance to Leyte Valley.    The 24th Division was to occupy Palo, advance with regiments abreast  into the interior in a northwesterly direction, [242] occupy the  Capoocan-Carigara-Barugo area, and secure Highway 1 between Palo and  Tanauan. The 19th Infantry on the left (south) was to establish an  initial beachhead, advance to the west and south, seize Hill 522,  and move on and capture Palo. The 34th Infantry on the right (north)  was to establish an initial beachhead, then move westward into the  interior and be prepared to assist the 19th Infantry in the capture  of Hill 522. [243]    The assaulting forces, having been transferred to landing craft,  met at the line of departure 5,000 yards from shore. After grouping,  they dashed for the landing beaches, each regiment in column of  battalions. The division landed at 1000 with regiments abreast  according to plan. The Japanese allowed the first five waves to land,  but when the other waves were 3,000 to 2,000 yards offshore, they  opened strong artillery and mortar fire against them. [244] A number  of the landing craft carrying the 1st Battalion, 19th Infantry,  were hit and four of them sunk. There were numerous casualties:  the commanding officer of Company C was killed; a squad of the  Ammunition and Pioneer Platoon was almost wiped out; and the Cannon  Company suffered the loss of two section leaders, a platoon leader,  and part of its headquarters personnel.    Among the vessels hit by Japanese artillery were four LST's, one of  which was set on fire. Of the five remaining, two were driven away  and three did not get in until much later. The enemy fired upon the  retiring LST's, which carried with them the artillery and most of  the tanks. The commanding officer of Headquarters Company and the  division quartermaster, together with the latter's executive officer,  were wounded. Many of the division headquarters personnel were killed  or wounded.    The first elements of the 3d Battalion, 34th Infantry, inadvertently  landed 300 yards north of the assigned area and were immediately pinned  down by heavy machine gun and rifle fire. The commanding officer of  the regiment, Col. Aubrey S. Newman, arrived on the beach and, noting  the situation, shouted to his men, \"Get the hell off the beach. Get  up and get moving. Follow me.\" [245] Thus urgently prompted, the men  followed him into the wooded area.    Company I was able to advance, but Company K ran into a defensive  position of five pillboxes along a stream about seventy-five  yards from the beach. It successfully stormed these pillboxes with  rifles, BAR's, and hand grenades. The 3d Battalion then halted for  reorganization. Company L, the reserve company, moved into the line  south of Company K to close the gap between the 19th and 34th Infantry  Regiments, a gap created when part of the 34th landed too far north.    By 1215 the 34th Infantry had cleared the beach area of the enemy,  and the 3d Battalion was ready to advance across an open swamp  to a line of trees 150 yards away. A preparatory concentration by  81-mm. mortars, tanks, and heavy machine guns was first laid down. At  1230 the 3d Battalion moved in. Although the going was rough and the  mud waist deep, the troops reached the trees at 1300 and waited for  the mortars and machine guns to arrive. The 3d Battalion then pushed  on an additional 250 yards.    The 2d Battalion, 34th Infantry, passed through the 3d Battalion,  crossed Highway 1 at 1550, and dug in for the night 100 yards west  of the highway. [246]    The 34th Infantry established contact with the 1st Cavalry Division  on the right and the 19th Infantry on the left. The 1st Battalion,  34th Infantry, remained in the beachhead area.    To the south the 19th Infantry, with the 3d Battalion in the lead,  had also struck heavy opposition on its sector of the beach. Through  error the first waves of the regiment landed almost directly behind the  34th Infantry and 800 yards north of the proposed landing point. The  later waves landed at the planned spot.    Company K did not land on schedule, because its command boat broke  down. Going in under heavy fire, the company had all its officers  except one killed or wounded. One of its platoons was unable to make  contact with the rest of the company until the following day.    Company L, on the right, met little opposition on landing, established  contact with the 34th Infantry, and reached the initial phase line  500 yards in from the beach. Company I, on the left, encountered  stiff resistance fifty yards off the beach. The defenses of the 33d  Infantry Regiment in this sector consisted of a tank ditch and light  automatic weapons, mortars, 75-mm. guns, and light and heavy machine  guns in prepared positions. Company I hit a group of pillboxes and  knocked out several of them as well as a 75-mm. gun. In this action  Pfc. Frank B. Robinson played a spectacular role. Crawling behind a  pillbox, he dropped three grenades into it and then reached down and  pulled the machine gun barrel out of line. After a further advance of  200 yards, when a flame thrower aimed at "]]]
