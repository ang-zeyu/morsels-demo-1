[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39674"],[0,"Buffalo Land (#20)"],[1,"to the chief the  idea that one of the eagles had grasped his shoulder in its talons.    The chief modestly requested similar honors for his \"papoose,\" and that  individual was treated to the straps of a captain. A different  application of strap, it occurred to me, would have seemed more proper  upon the six feet of unpromising humanity which appeared above the  \"papoose's\" moccasins.    It had been a matter of surprise to us how the Indians could make such  inferior looking stock as theirs capable of such speed and extraordinary  journeys; but it ceased to excite our wonder after an examination of  their whips. These ingenious instruments of torture have handles, which  in form and size resemble a policeman's club. To one end are attached  some thongs of thick leather, half a yard in length, and to the other a  loop of the same material, just large enough to go over the hand and  bind slightly on the wrist. Dangling from the latter, the handle can be  instantly grasped, and the body of thongs brought down on the pony's  skin, with a crack like a flail on the sheaves, and the result is what  Sachem called an astonishing \"shelling out\" of speed.    We explained to White Wolf that Tammany Sachem was one of many great  chiefs who had a mighty wigwam in the big city of the pale-faces, far  away toward the rising sun; that they were all good men, and never lied  like the chiefs of the Cheyennes, or took any thing belonging to others;  and that their women, instead of carrying heavy burdens, spent all their  time in distributing the money and goods of the big wigwam to the needy.    White Wolf signified, through the interpreter, that such a wigwam was  too good for earth, and ought to be pitched on the happy hunting grounds  as soon as possible.    Sachem thought the savage meant to be sarcastic.          CHAPTER XII.         ARMS OF A WAR PARTY--A DONKEY PRESENT--EATING POWERS OF THE       NOMADS--SATANTA, HIS CRIMES AND PUNISHMENT--RUNNING OFF WITH A       GOVERNMENT HERD--DAUB, OUR ARTIST--ANTELOPE CHASE BY A GREYHOUND.      At our request White Wolf and two of his braves gave us a display of  their skill--or rather, their strength--in the use of their bows,  shooting their arrows at a stake sixty yards off. The efforts were what  would be called good \"line shots,\" although missing the slender stick.  We then essayed a trial with the chief's bow, which was an exceedingly  stout hickory wrapped in sinew, but we found that more practiced  strength than ours was required even to bend it. Some amusement was  created when the first of our party took up the bow, by the haste with  which a small and unusually ugly Indian retreated from the foreground as  if fearing that an arrow might be accidentally sent through his blanket.    Among the stock which the savages had brought with them was a  long-eared, diminutive brute, scarcely higher than a table, and  apparently forming the connecting link between a jackass rabbit and a  donkey. This animal White Wolf seemed extremely anxious to present to  the Professor, but it was politely declined, by the advice of the  interpreter, who explained to us that a return gift of the donkey's  weight in sugar and coffee would be expected. Notwithstanding the  stringency of the law forbidding the sale of whisky and ammunitions to  the Indians, the savages found little difficulty in filling themselves  with fire-water, and also got a little powder. White Wolf went off with  his pocket full of cartridges in exchange for some Indian commodities,  but the cunning pale face rendered them of little value by selecting  ammunition a size too small for the gun.    The eating powers of these nomads are marvelous. We saw the chief,  inside of two hours, devour three hearty dinners, one of which was  gotten up from our own larder and was both good and plentiful. As he did  full justice to every invitation to eat and drink, we concluded that he  would continue to accept during the whole afternoon, if the opportunity  were only offered him. What a capital minister to England was here  wasting his gastric juices on the desert air! If Great Britain should  continue her hesitation to digest our Alabama claims, the wolf at their  door would digest enough roast beef to bring them to terms or  starvation. Sugar, coffee, spices, pickles, sardines, ham, and many  another luxury of civilization, were alike welcome at the capacious  portal of the untutored savage. Dobeen discovered him eating a can of  our condensed milk under the impression that it was a sweet porridge.    Their entertainment at the town being concluded, the Indians were  conducted over to the fort and some rations given them. They manifested  an especial fondness for sugar, but took any thing they could get, their  ponies proving capable of carrying an unlimited number of sacks. It  seemed as difficult to overload these animals as it is a Broadway  omnibus; and their riders, perhaps in order to avoid being top heavy,  took freight for the inside whenever opportunity offered. As they came  back through the town, we all turned out to see them off. The band  promised us peace, notwithstanding which it was no small satisfaction to  discover that they were poorly armed. Bows and arrows were the only  weapons which all possessed, and while a few had revolvers, the chief  alone sported a rifle, a rusty-looking old breech-loader.    As our late cavalry escort rode off, their attitudes plainly bespoke  that they had been raiding upon more than the flesh-pots of Egypt. Sons  of the sandy-complexioned desert, we saw several of them kiss their  mother before they got out of sight. The most serious question with us  now was whether or not these red gormandizers had been uttering peace  notes not properly indorsed by their hearts. The trouble is that when  one discovers a circulation of this kind, his own ceases about the same  instant, and his bones become a fixed investment in the fertile soil of  the plains.    One of the officers of the fort told us an amusing instance of the  impudent treachery of which the western Indians of to-day are sometimes  guilty. A year or two before, when Hancock commanded the Department and  was encamped near Fort Dodge, on the Arkansas, Satanta and his band of  Kiowas came in. This chief has always been known as very hostile to the  whites, usually being the first of his tribe to commence hostilities. He  was the very embodiment of treachery, ferocity, and bravado.  Phrenologically considered, his head must have been a cranial marvel,  and the bumps on it mapping out the kingdom of evil a sort of Rocky  Mountain chain towering over the more peaceful valleys around. Viewed  from the towering peaks of combativeness and acquisitiveness the  territory of his past would reveal to the phrenologist an untold number  of government mules, fenced in by sutler's stores, while bending over  the bloody trail leading back almost to his bark cradle, would be the  shades of many mothers and wives, searching among the wrecks of emigrant  trains for flesh of their flesh and bone of their bone.    Satanta was long a name on the plains to hate and abhor. He was an  abject beggar in the pale faces' camp and a demon on their trail. On the  occasion in question he came to Gen. Hancock with protestations of  friendship, and, although these were not believed, he was treated  precisely as if they had been. To gratify his love of finery an old  military coat with general's stars, said to be one that Hancock himself  had cast off, was presented him. By some means he also acquired a bugle,  and the garrison were greatly amused for the remainder of the day by  seeing Satanta galloping back and forth before his band, blowing his  bugle and parading his coat, the warriors all cheering the old  cut-throat and proud as himself of the display. The way he handled that  bugle, however, before the next morning was by no means so amusing.    Some time before dawn the sleepy garrison were aroused by the thunders  of a stock stampede, and out of the darkness came the clatter of hoofs,  as Satanta and his band departed for the south with a goodly herd of  government mules and horses. Pursuit was commenced at once, with the  hope of cutting them off before they could get the stock across the  Arkansas, then somewhat swollen. Just as the troops reached the bank of  that stream, a major-general's uniform was seen going out of the water  upon the other side. Notwithstanding its high rank fire was instantly  opened upon it, but ineffectually. The savage turned a moment, blew a  shrill, defiant blast upon his bugle, and galloped off in safety. Too  much promotion made him mad. As a simple chief, he might have stolen  some straggling teams; as a major-general, he appropriated a whole herd.    During the next eighteen months, Satanta had several encounters with the  troops, generally wearing the major-general's coat and blowing his  bugle. His last exploit, which brought the long hesitating sword of  justice upon his head, is too fresh and too painful to be soon  forgotten. A few months ago the savage chief was living with his people  on a reserve in the Indian Territory and being fed by the government.  Gathering a few of his warriors he stole forth, and, crossing the Texas  border, surprised a wagon train, murdered the teamsters, and drove off  the mules. Fortunately, Gen. Sherman, in his examination of frontier  posts, happened to be near the scene of murder, and at once ordered  troops in pursuit. They were still trailing the marauders when Satanta  returned to the reservation at Fort Sill, and with bold effrontery  begotten of long immunity, actually boasted of the crime before the  Quaker agent. \"I did it,\" said he, \"and if any other chief says it was  him, tell him he lies. I am the man.\" Gen. Sherman had just arrived, and  when Satanta, with a number of minor chiefs who were with him on the  raid, came into the fort to trade and visit, they were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39685"],[0,"Nooks and Corners of Old England (#20)"],[1,"Rivel, some swords and  jack-boots of the time of Charles II. were preserved. They are now in  the museum at Taunton, where we regret to say the buckle worn by the  Duke of Monmouth, and Lord Feversham's dish are now no longer[19] with  the other interesting relics of the fight at Sedgemoor.    [Illustration: BARRINGTON COURT.]    At Barrington Court and White Lackington manor-house, both near  Ilminster, Monmouth was entertained in princely state during his  progress through the western counties to win popularity. The latter is a  plain gabled house (a portion only of the original) which has suffered  by the insertion of sash windows. It seems to bear out its name, for it  is very white and staring. But Barrington is one of the most perfect  Elizabethan houses in Somersetshire, that is to say exteriorly, for the  inside has long since been stripped and modernised. The myriad of  pinnacles upon its gable ends, and its general appearance, recall the  stately Sussex mansion Wakehurst: the situation, however, is vastly  different, for it stands bare of trees on a wide extensive flat. The  Spekes of White Lackington and the Strodes of Barrington, it goes  without saying, were notorious Whigs; and though the duke's hosts  favoured his cause, they both managed to save their necks when the  terrible Jeffreys came down upon his memorable Progress. But the name of  Speke was enough for the judge, and the youngest son of White  Lackington, whose sins did not extend beyond shaking hands with his  father's illustrious guest, was swung up on a tree at Ilminster. In  the lovely fields around the manor-house it is difficult to imagine a  throng of twenty thousand who accompanied the popular duke. The giant  Spanish chestnut tree beneath which Monmouth dined in public, and which  had braved the tempests of many centuries, fell, alas! a victim to the  storm of March, 2, 1897, and with the destruction of \"Monmouth's tree\" a  link with 1680 has departed never to return. Barrington, we understand,  has recently been taken under the protecting wing of the Society for the  Preservation of Ancient Buildings, for which all those interested in  domestic architecture as well as buildings of historic association must  feel grateful.    [Illustration: HINTON ST. GEORGE.]    The little town of South Petherton, midway between Ilminster and  Ilchester, is full of old nooks and corners, from its ancient cruciform  church to the old hostelry in the High Street. From a very early date it  was a place of great importance; but since the days of the Saxon monarch  who resided there, the Daubeneys have stamped their identity upon King  Ina's palace, of which there are picturesque Tudor remains incorporated  in a modern dwelling, which to our mind has robbed it of the poetry it  possessed when in a ruinous condition. The villages of Martock above and  Hinton St George below are also full of interest; and both possess  their ancient market-crosses, but now curtailed and converted into  sundials with stone-step massive bases. But the glory of Martock is its  grand old church (where Fairfax and Cromwell offered up a prayer for the  capture of Bridgwater in 1645), whose carved black oak roof is one of  the finest in the west of England.[20] The ancient seat of the Pouletts  is an extensive but by no means beautiful house. It has a squat  appearance, being only two storeys high, with battlemented towers at the  angles and Georgian and Victorian Gothic sash-windows; but on the  southern side, a pierced parapet and classic windows give it a less  barrack-like appearance. Sir Amias Poulett (or Paulet, as it was  formerly spelled), the grandson of the builder of the house, who won his  spurs at the battle of Newark-on-Trent, is principally famous from the  fact that he put Wolsey in the stocks when that great person held the  living of Lymington, and upon one occasion took more than was good for  him. But the cardinal afterwards had his revenge, and put fine upon Sir  Amias to build the gate of the Middle Temple, which formerly bore the  prelate's arms elaborately carved, as a peace-offering from Sir Amias.  Lymington in Hampshire is often associated with the stocks' episode, but  Lymington near Ilchester, and some ten miles from Hinton, was the place.  Sir Amias had the custody of Mary Queen of Scots during the latter part  of her long imprisonment, and to him the \"Good Queen\" (?) more than  hinted that it would be a kindness to hasten her victim's end by private  assassination. Paulet, however, had a conscience, so Elizabeth had to  take upon herself the responsibility of Mary's execution.    The historic stocks of Lymington are now no more, but beneath a big elm  tree on the village green at Tintinhull, close by, they still are  flourishing. Tintinhull, like Trent and other neighbouring villages, is  full of picturesque old houses, sturdy stone Jacobean and Tudor  cottages, with garden borderings of slabs of stone set up edgeways, and  slabs of stone running along the footway in a delightfully primitive  fashion. Tintinhull Court is a stately old pile dating from the reign of  Henry VIII. Its oldest side faces the garden, but the main front is a  good type of the seventeenth century. We will not repeat here the  particulars of Charles II.'s concealment at the old seat of the Wyndhams  after the battle of Worcester;[21] but on the spot, and though the  greater part of the house has been rebuilt, one may realise the  incidents in that romantic episode, for the village of Trent to-day is  much the same as the village of 1651.    [Illustration: SANDFORD ORCAS MANOR-HOUSE.]    The manor-house of Sandford Orcas, to the north-east of Trent (which by  the way now belongs to Dorset), is quite a gem of early-Elizabethan  architecture, with crests upon the gable ends, and the Tudor and Knoyle  arms and graceful panels upon the warm-coloured walls of Ham Hill stone.  Though a small house, it has its great hall with carved oak screen; and  most of the rooms are panelled, and have their original fireplaces. The  wide arched Tudor gateway spanning the road bears the arms of the  Knoyles, a monument to whom may be seen in the south aisle of the church  close by, the tower of which rises picturesquely above the gabled roof  of the manor-house. The village, the little there is of it, is buried in  orchards, between which the mill-stream winds, the haunt of a colony of  quacking ducks whose noisy gossip makes up for the paucity of  inhabitants.    Some eight miles away, on the other side of Yeovil, there is a  manor-house, which for picturesqueness must take the palm of even  Sandford Orcas. This is Brympton D'Eversy, a remarkable mixture of the  domestic architecture of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth  centuries. One would think that the various styles would not harmonise,  but they do in a remarkable degree. Add to these the styles of the  thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, which are conspicuous in portions  of the adjacent church, and there is indeed a field from which to study.  The northern front of the mansion, with its embattled Gothic bays and  rows of latticed windows, is flanked by the quaint little turreted  church, and together they form a most striking group not only in  outline, but attractive in colour, for grey-green lichens and the  peculiar rusty tint of stone blend in perfect sympathy. Picture this  house and church in crude white stone, unmellowed and toned by time, and  half its charm would be gone. Does not this open up a question worth  consideration? A modern house is built with conscientious exactitude in  imitation of some beautiful existing example of Gothic or Renaissance  architecture. Every detail is perfect, but the result is harsh and new.  One must wait almost a lifetime before it makes a picture really  pleasing to the eye. Therefore why not take some measures to tone down  the staring stone or obtrusive red-brick before the masonry is  constructed? True, there are a few exceptions where additions have been  made to ancient houses, which cannot be detected; but in the case of an  entirely new house, does it often occur to the builder how much more  pleasing would be the result if the exterior of his house were more in  harmony with the old oak fittings and ancient furniture with which it is  his ambition to fill it? Would that all such houses were built of Ham  Hill stone, for it has the peculiarity of imparting age much more  rapidly than any other.    [Illustration: MONTACUTE HOUSE.]    It is this that gives so venerable an appearance to Montacute House;  for, compared with many mansions coeval with it, the ancestral seat of  the Phelips family looks quite double the age. The imposing height of  Montacute as compared, for instance, with Hinton St. George, gives it  stateliness and grandeur, while the other has none. Like Hardwick, the  front of the house is one mass of windows; but it has not that formal  spare appearance, for here there are rounded gables to break the  outline. In niches between the windows and over the central gable stand  the stone representations of such varied celebrities as Charlemagne,  King Arthur, Pompey, Caesar, Alexander the Great, Moses, Joshua, Godfrey  de Bouillon, and Judas Maccabeus. They look down upon a trim old garden  walled in by a balustraded and pinnacled enclosure, with Moorish-like  pavilions or music-rooms at the corners. As a specimen of elaborate  Elizabethan architecture within and without, Montacute is unique. In  Nash's _Mansions_ there is a drawing of the western front, which is  still more elaborate in detail, and is earlier in date than the rest of  the house; and this may be accounted for as it was added when Clifton  Maybank (another house of the Phelips') was dismantled many years ago.  But of this old house there are yet some interesting remains.[22] Inside  there is a similarity also to Hardwick with its wide stone staircase and  its ornamental Elizabethan"]]]
