To advocate the rejection of Christ's command of  non-resistance to evil, or its adaptation to the needs of life,  implies a misunderstanding of the teaching of Christ.    And those who do so certainly do not understand it.  They do not  understand that this teaching is the institution of a new theory  of life, corresponding to the new conditions on which men have  entered now for eighteen hundred years, and also the definition of  the new conduct of life which results from it.  They do not  believe that Christ meant to say what he said; or he seems to them  to have said what he said in the Sermon on the Mount and in other  places accidentally, or through his lack of intelligence or of  cultivation.        [Footnote: Here, for example, is a characteristic      view of that kind from the American journal the ARENA      (October, 1890): \"New Basis of Church Life.\"  Treating      of the significance of the Sermon on the Mount and      non-resistance to evil in particular, the author,      being under no necessity, like the Churchmen, to      hide its significance, says:          \"Christ in fact preached complete communism and        anarchy; but one must learn to regard Christ always        in his historical and psychological significance.        Like every advocate of the love of humanity, Christ        went to the furthest extreme in his teaching.  Every        step forward toward the moral perfection of humanity        is always guided by men who see nothing but their        vocation.  Christ, in no disparaging sense be it        said, had the typical temperament of such a reformer.        And therefore we must remember that his precepts        cannot be understood literally as a complete        philosophy of life.  We ought to analyze his words        with respect for them, but in the spirit of criticism,        accepting what is true,\" etc.        Christ would have been happy to say what he ought, but      he was not able to express himself as exactly and      clearly as we can in the spirit of criticism, and      therefore let us correct him.  All that he said about      meekness, sacrifice, lowliness, not caring for the      morrow, was said by accident, through lack of knowing      how to express himself scientifically.]    Matt. vi. 25-34: \"Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for  your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for  your body, what ye shall put on.  Is not the life more than meat,  and the body than rainment?  Behold the fouls of the air; for they  sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your  heavenly Father feedeth them.  Are ye not much better than they?  Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit onto his stature?  And why take ye thought for rainment? Consider the lilies of the  field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin; and yet  I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed  like one of these.  Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the  field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall  he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?  Therefore take  no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink?  or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?  (For after all these things  do the Gentiles seek), for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye  have need of all these things.  But seek ye first the kingdom of  God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added  unto you.  Take therefore no thought for the morrow; for the  morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.  Sufficient  unto the day is the evil thereof.\"  Luke xii. 33-34: \"Sell that ye  have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a  treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief  approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.  For where your treasure is,  there will your heart be also.\"  Sell all thou hast and follow me;  and he who will not leave father, or mother, or children, or  brothers, or fields, or house, he cannot be my disciple.  Deny  thyself, take up thy cross each day and follow me.  My meat is to  do the will of him that sent me, and to perform his works.  Not my  will, but thine be done; not what I will, but as thou wilt.  Life  is to do not one's will, but the will of God.    All these principles appear to men who regard them from the  standpoint of a lower conception of life as the expression of an  impulsive enthusiasm, having no direct application to life.  These  principles, however, follow from the Christian theory of life,  just as logically as the principles of paying a part of one's  private gains to the commonwealth and of sacrificing one's life in  defense of one's country follow from the state theory of life.    As the man of the stale conception of life said to the savage: Reflect,  bethink yourself! The life of your individuality cannot be true life,  because that life is pitiful and passing. But the life of a society and  succession of individuals, family, clan, tribe, or state, goes on  living, and therefore a man must sacrifice his own individuality for the  life of the family or the state. In exactly the same way the Christian  doctrine says to the man of the social, state conception of life, Repent  ye--[GREEK WORD]-i. e., bethink yourself, or you will be ruined.  Understand that this casual, personal life which now comes into being  and to-morrow is no more can have no permanence, that no external means,  no construction of it can give it consecutiveness and permanence. Take  thought and understand that the life you are living is not real  life--the life of the family, of society, of the state will not save you  from annihilation. The true, the rational life is only possible for man  according to the measure in which he can participate, not in the family  or the state, but in the source of life--the Father; according to the  measure in which he can merge his life in the life of the Father. Such  is undoubtedly the Christian conception of life, visible in every  utterance of the Gospel.        [TRANSCRIBIST'S NOTE: The GREEK WORD above used Greek letters,      spelled: mu-epsilon-tau-alpha-nu-omicron-zeta-epsilon-tau-      epsilon]    One may not share this view of life, one may reject it, one may show its  inaccuracy and its erroneousness, but we cannot judge of the Christian  teaching without mastering this view of life. Still less can one  criticise a subject on a higher plane from a lower point of view. From  the basement one cannot judge of the effect of the spire. But this is  just what the learned critics of the day try to do. For they share the  erroneous idea of the orthodox believers that they are in possession of  certain infallible means for investigating a subject. They fancy if they  apply their so-called scientific methods of criticism, there can be no  doubt of their conclusion being correct.    This testing the subject by the fancied infallible method of  science is the principal obstacle to understanding the Christian  religion for unbelievers, for so-called educated people.  From  this follow all the mistakes made by scientific men about the  Christian religion, and especially two strange misconceptions  which, more than everything else, hinder them from a correct  understanding of it.  One of these misconceptions is that the  Christian moral teaching cannot be carried out, and that therefore  it has either no force at all--that is, it should not be accepted  as the rule of conduct--or it must be transformed, adapted to the  limits within which its fulfillment is possible in our society.  Another misconception is that the Christian doctrine of love of  God, and therefore of his service, is an obscure, mystic  principle, which gives no definite object for love, and should  therefore be replaced by the more exact and comprehensible  principles of love for men and the service of humanity.    The first misconception in regard to the impossibility of  following the principle is the result of men of the state  conception of life unconsciously taking that conception as the  standard by which the Christian religion directs men, and taking  the Christian principle of perfection as the rule by which that  life is to be ordered; they think and say that to follow Christ's  teaching is impossible, because the complete fulfillment of all  that is required by this teaching would put an end to life.  \"If a  man were to carry out all that Christ teaches, he would destroy  his own life; and if all men carried it out, then the human race  would come to an end,\" they say.    \"If we take no thought for the morrow, what we shall eat and what  we shall drink, and wherewithal we shall be clothed, do not defend  our life, nor resist evil by force, lay down our life for others,  and observe perfect chastity, the human race cannot exist,\" they  say.    And they are perfectly right if they take the principle of  perfection given by Christ's teaching as a rule which everyone is  bound to fulfill, just as in the state principles of life everyone  is bound to carry out the rule of paying taxes, supporting the  law, and so on.    The misconception is based precisely on the fact that the teaching  of Christ guides men differently from the way in which the  precepts founded on the lower conception of life guide men.  The  precepts of the state conception of life only guide men by  requiring of them an exact fulfillment of rules or laws.  Christ's  teaching guides men by pointing them to the infinite perfection of  their heavenly Father, to which every man independently and  voluntarily struggles, whatever the degree of his imperfection in  the present.    The misunderstanding of men who judge of the Christian principle  from the point of view of the state principle, consists in the  fact that on the supposition that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46092"],[0,"A Little Pilgrimage in Italy (#20)"],[1,"whose surface was worn into two hollows by the knees of  St. Francis. So they would have us believe. '_Ma, e vero!_' they  exclaimed, as though they feared that we should doubt them; and we  could but smile as they told us an old legend of the saint sailing  miraculously across Thrasymene on his mantle, bearing a lighted  candle in his hand, because the boatmen dared not put out in the  tramontana which was lashing the waters to fury.    We almost missed seeing the battle-field of Hannibal, because we  had left it to our last afternoon, and discovered too late that the  only carriage in Passignano had been already commandeered.    It was Fortunato Rosso who came to our rescue, dear old man, with  his dilapidated vehicle, which was no larger than a riksha, and so  broken down that we expected the back to fall away every minute.  The step did break when we tried to use it, and the axle bar was  tied up with string. Fortunato Rosso is one of the characters of  Passignano. He is a veteran of the Venti Settembre. As he has lost  his teeth his conversation is difficult to follow, though he is an  intelligent guide, having a soldier's eye for the possibilities of  the land: his clothes are almost as dilapidated as his carriage,  but he has a string of medal ribbons sewn across his scrupulously  clean white waistcoat. The medals themselves are kept in a dirty  scrap of paper in his pocket. He persisted in showing them to  us before we started, and the villagers stood round and laughed  indulgently. While he was eagerly pulling them out a cheap crucifix  fell to the ground. A small boy picked it up, and pressed it to his  lips as he handed it back, and Rosso himself gave it a resounding  kiss before he put it into his pocket.    The spot where Hannibal entrapped the Roman army is as distinct  as stage scenery. There is a semi-circle of mountains coming down  to the lake at each end. Passignano clambers into the water at  the southern extremity; and on the northern spur, close to the  lake, there is an ancient road climbing between bluffs in an  olive-garden. It is below the modern strada; and Fortunato Rosso,  who takes a delight in propounding the stratagems of Hannibal,  insists that Flaminius must have entered the plain through this  pass. Half-way between the semi-circle and the lake is the hill of  Tuoro, on which Hannibal's centre was conspicuously drawn up.    For the Punic general with his genius for guerilla warfare no  better place for an ambuscade could be imagined. The Consul  Flaminius lay at Arretium some miles to the north; and Hannibal,  knowing his impetuous temper, determined to draw him out by  laying waste the countryside from Cortona to Thrasymene under the  very eyes of the Roman legions. As he anticipated, Flaminius,  exasperated beyond endurance, left Arezzo and marched down to  Thrasymene, paying no heed to the ill-omens which attended his  setting forth. As a consequence his army had no enthusiasm. The  name of Hannibal had turned even the heart of Rome to water, so  that she spent her days in making sacrifices to the gods and  consulting the oracles, but the fiery Flaminius would not allow his  legions to make propitiation. 'Nay, rather,' said he with bitter  sarcasm, 'let us lie before the walls of Arretium, for here is our  country, here our household gods. Let Hannibal, slipping through  our fingers, waste Italy through and through; and, ravaging and  burning everything, let him arrive at the walls of Rome; nor let  us move hence till the fathers shall have summoned Flaminius from  Arretium, as they did Camillus of old from Veii.'[16]    Everything befell as Hannibal desired. Flaminius entered the pass.  Seeing the Carthaginian army on the hill of Tuoro he advanced to  give battle, not noticing the Baliares and light troops posted  round the mountains, and unconscious of the fact that the Numidian  cavalry had blocked his retreat by holding the pass when the last  detachment of his army had come through. To add to his discomfiture  a mist rose up from the lake and enveloped the lowlands, while the  hills were in the sunlight above, and the enemy could watch for the  preconcerted signal of attack.    It was given, and they poured down upon the Romans from all sides,  taking them by surprise, and terrifying them by the unexpectedness  of the assault. Even so the day might not have been lost if  Flaminius had not fallen early in the engagement. After that it was  a slaughter. There was no order. Each man fought for his own life,  and when the legions attempted to escape by water, the only way  left open to them, they were either drowned, or cut to pieces by  the Carthaginian cavalry which followed them into the shallows. A  band of some six thousand did indeed force their way to the hills,  where they waited for the mist to rise, not being able to see how  the day was going. And when at last the sun pierced through to the  plain, and they could view the slaughter, they fled, taking their  standards with them, only to fall prisoners on 'the following day  when, Maharbal, who had followed them during the night with the  whole body of cavalry, pledging his honour that he would let them  depart with single garments if they would deliver up their arms,  they surrendered themselves: which promise was kept by Hannibal  with Punic fidelity, and he threw them all into chains' (Livy,  xxii. 6).    So much for the battle, but the old tragedy that was enacted on  these vine-clad plains has been forgotten. Many of the peasants  have not even heard of the name of Hannibal, nor dream that where  they gather their purple vintage to-day the earth was reddened  once by Roman blood. The broad smooth road led us between ancient  olives. White oxen yoked to clumsy wooden tumbrils rolled on and  on towards us in a mist of sunlit dust; peasants in gay kerchiefs  and skirts were working in the bearded corn which rose higher than  their heads, so that we looked at them through a veil of stalks; a  herd of black swine were nosing the yellow earth under the olives,  with a little girl-child to keep them. And when we reached the  summit of the pass above the turquoise lake we could see the road  to Arezzo in a gap of the mountains, across a sea of vines. There  was nothing to disturb the air of peace; the mediaeval towers and  castles which crowned the hills were farms; and the Sanguinetto,  whose sinister name is the one memento of that day of slaughter,  was a river of stones agape for the September rains.      'Far other scene is Thrasymene now;    Her lake a sheet of silver, and her plain    Rent by no ravage save the gentle plough;    Her aged trees rise thick as once the slain    Lay where their roots are; but a brook hath ta'en--    A little rill of scanty stream and bed--    A name of blood from that day's sanguine rain;    And Sanguinetto tells you where the dead    Made the earth wet, and turn'd the unwilling waters red.'                                                      CHILDE HAROLD.          ASSISI      Almost the first thing we noticed in Assisi was the Biblical  simplicity of life. This little city, rose and white, upon the  lower slopes of Subasio would be like a picture out of the Bible  if it were not so Gothic. Its steep and rough-paved streets have  grasses growing in between their stones; its grim and silent  houses, built of Subasian rock, are as unresponsive as the East;  at their barred gates stand mules and asses tethered, with  clumsy wooden saddles on their backs, or sacks of grain thrown  pannier-wise. It is not only Francis and his companions that you  might see walking in this poor and humble town, but Jesus of  Nazareth.    For Assisi still wears the thread-bare garment of her poverty,  notwithstanding the great basilica on the hillside, which is rich  out of all comparison with the poor little city of St. Francis.  Long, long ago in the thirteenth century she dedicated her life to  him, giving up her worldly vanities and espousing Lady Poverty,  'that Dame to whom none openeth pleasure's gate.' So that the story  of the splendid young men of Assisi, whose magnificent equipages  drew the eyes of Rome in the seventeenth century, comes as an echo  of another place. I think she loved him from the first, when he  was still gay Cecco of the midnight revels, Lord of Love, the boon  companion of her merry youths. She listened to his songs--the soft  Provencal songs which he had learnt from the lips of Madonna Pica,  his mother--and smiled at his caprices, pleading his youth when  others shook their heads. Later, when the world made a jest of the  penitent, and his friends scorned him, and the hand of the people  was against him, she wept for him, and gazed with wistful eyes down  to the valleys where he ministered to her outcasts, and garnered in  his soul that Peace of the Lord which passeth all understanding.  She is like the bride of whom the poet of the Israelites sang,  looking and listening for the voice of her beloved.      'The voice of my beloved! Behold he cometh, leaping upon the    mountains, skipping upon the hills.      My beloved is like the roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth    behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, showing himself    through the lattice.      My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair    one, and come away.      For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;      The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds    is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;      The fig-tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the    tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and    come away.'    But if there had been no Saint Francis to raise her to the  foremost rank of shrines, and sanctify her with a special crown  of holiness, Assisi would still be one of the most lovely cities  in the garden of Umbria. She has grown like a fair white flower  upon the"]]]
