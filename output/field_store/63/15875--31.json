The Prophet Joseph's Departure From Kirtland And Arrival In Missouri.    [Sidenote: Flight of the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon from Kirtland.]    _January, 1838_.--A new year dawned upon the Church in Kirtland in all  the bitterness of the spirit of apostate mobocracy; which continued to  rage and grow hotter and hotter, until Elder Rigdon and myself were  obliged to flee from its deadly influence, as did the Apostles and  Prophets of old, and as Jesus said, \"when they persecute you in one  city, flee to another.\" On the evening of the 12th of January, about  ten o'clock, we left Kirtland, on horseback, to escape mob violence,  which was about to burst upon us under the color of legal process to  cover the hellish designs of our enemies, and to save themselves from  the just judgment of the law.    {2} We continued our travels during the night, and at eight o'clock on  the morning of the 13th, arrived among the brothren in Norton Township,  Medina county, Ohio, a distance of sixty miles from Kirtland. Here  we tarried about thirty-six hours, when our families arrived; and on  the 16th we pursued our journey with our families, in covered wagons  towards the city of Far West, in Missouri. We passed through Dayton and  Eaton, in Ohio, and Dublin, Indiana; in the latter place we tarried  nine days, and refreshed ourselves.    [Sidenote: Brigham Young to the Prophet's Rescue.]    About January 16, 1838, being destitute of money to pursue my journey,  I said to Brother Brigham Young: \"You are one of the Twelve who have  charge of the kingdom in all the world; I believe I shall throw myself  upon you, and look to you for counsel in this case.\" Brother Young  thought I was not earnest, but I told him I was. Brother Brigham then  said, \"If you will take my counsel it will be that you rest yourself,  and be assured you shall have money in plenty to pursue your journey.\"    There was a brother living in the place who had tried for some time  to sell his farm but could not; he asked counsel of Brother Young  concerning his property; Brother Young told him that if he would do  right, and obey counsel, he should have an opportunity to sell. In  about three days Brother Tomlinson came to Brother Brigham and said  he had an offer for his place; Brother Brigham told him that this was  the manifestation of the hand of the Lord to deliver Brother Joseph  Smith from his present necessities. Brother Brigham's promise was soon  verified, and I got three hundred dollars from Brother Tomlinson, which  enabled me to pursue my journey. [1]    [Sidenote: The Bitterness of the Prophet's Enemies.]    The weather was extremely cold, we were obliged to secrete ourselves  in our wagons, sometimes, to elude the {3} grasp of our pursuers,  who continued their pursuit of us more than two hundred miles from  Kirtland, armed with pistols and guns, seeking our lives. They  frequently crossed our track, twice they were in the houses where  we stopped, once we tarried all night in the same house with them,  with only a partition between us and them; and heard their oaths and  imprecations, and threats concerning us, if they could catch us; and  late in the evening they came in to our room and examined us, but  decided we were not the men. At other times we passed them in the  streets, and gazed upon them, and they on us, but they knew us not. One  Lyons was one of our pursuers.    [Sidenote: The Prophet's Arrival in Missouri.]    I parted with Brother Rigdon at Dublin, and traveling different routes  we met at Terre Haute, where, after resting, we separated again, and I  pursued my journey, crossing the Mississippi river at Quincy, Illinois.        Trial of the Far West Presidency of the Church.        _Minutes of the Proceedings of the Committee of the whole Church      in Zion, in General Assembly, at the following places, to-wit:      At Far West, February 5, 1838; Carter's Settlement on the 6th;      Durphy's Settlement, on the 7th; Curtis' Dwelling-house on the      8th; and Haun's Mills on the 9th. Thomas B. Marsh, Moderator, John      Cleminson, Clerk_.        After prayer, the Moderator stated the object of the meeting,      giving a relation of the recent organization of the Church here and      in Kirtland. He also read a certain revelation given in Kirtland,      September 3, 1837, which made known that John Whitmer and W. W.      Phelps, were in transgression, and if they repented not, they      should be removed out of their places; [2] also read a certain      clause contained in the appeal published in the old _Star_, on the      183rd page as follows:        \"And to sell our lands would amount to a denial of our faith, as      that is the place where the Zion of God shall stand, according to      our faith and belief in the revelations of God.\"        Elder John Murdock then took the stand and showed to the      congregation, why the High Council proceeded thus was that the      Church {4} might have a voice in the matter; and that he considered      it perfectly legal according to the instructions of President      Joseph Smith, Jun.        Elder George M. Hinkle then set forth the way in which the      Presidency of Far West had been labored with, that a committee of      three, of whom he was one, had labored with them. He then read a      written document, containing a number of accusations against the      three presidents. He spoke many things against them, setting forth      in a plain and energetic manner the iniquity of Elders Phelps and      Whitmer, in using the monies which were loaned to the Church.      Also David Whitmer's wrong-doing in persisting in the use of tea,      coffee, and tobacco.        Bishop Partridge then arose and endeavored to rectify some mistakes      of minor importance, made by Elder Hinkle; also the Bishop spoke      against the proceedings of the meeting, as being hasty and illegal,      for he thought they ought to be had before the Common Council, and      said that he could not lift his hand against the Presidency at      present. He then read a letter from President Joseph Smith, Jun.        A letter from William Smith was then read by Thomas B. Marsh, who      made some comments on the same, and also on the letter read by      Bishop Partridge.        Elder George Morey, who was one of the committee sent to labor with      the Missouri Presidency, spoke, setting forth in a very energetic      manner, the proceedings of that Presidency, as being iniquitous.        Elder Thomas Grover, also, being one of the committee,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47708"],[0,"Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow (#20)"],[1,"to move    The cause of Zion in the courts above.    Nauvoo, July 1, 1844.    With saddened heart I then returned to the vicinity of Kirtland,  from whence I started--arranged some matters of business and set my  face homeward, traveling with horse and buggy; nothing of interest,  worthy of notice, occurring, except, perhaps, I might mention a little  incident which happened after passing through Carthage, the place of  Joseph and Hyrum's martyrdom.    The spirit of destruction, mobocracy and murder was rampant, and our  enemies in Carthage, and other towns and settlements in the vicinity  of Nauvoo, were seeking every opportunity to wreak vengeance upon our  people, especially when it could be accomplished without endangering  themselves.    One morning, near the break of day, as I approached the summit of a  long hill, I saw about a dozen fierce looking men, armed with guns and  bowie knives, advancing towards me. As we approached each other about  half way down the hill, they eyed me very suspiciously--stopped, talked  low and excitedly, but just at that moment one of my buggy wheels  struck a stone, giving the vehicle a sudden jolt, upon which I turned  towards them, and in an angry voice exclaimed, \"Boys! Why in hell don't  you repair this road!\" \"_He is one of us_,\" quickly remarked one of the  group. \"_He is all right, let him pass_.\"    I had several hundred dollars about my person, most of which had been  entrusted to me to be delivered to various parties; how far my uncouth  and undignified expression went as security for their money, must be  left to conjecture.

Up to this time my brother lived a bachelor. The great work in which he  was engaged as a missionary of the Gospel of salvation to the nations  of the earth, had so engrossed his mind and engaged the energies of his  soul, that virtually he had ignored the first commandment to \"multiply  and replenish the earth.\" To devote his time, his talents, his all to  the ministry was his all-absorbing desire; and in consonance with this  desire, he had cherished the idea that domestic responsibility would  lessen his usefulness; and, until the law of Celestial Marriage was  fully explained to him by the Prophet Joseph Smith, in a prolonged  interview while the two were seated alone on the bank of the  Mississippi river, as before related, he had not conceived the idea  that marriage was one of the _duties_ of the great mission of mortal  life.    With him, this, as well as every other practical doctrine, was only  to be understood to be obeyed. It is one of his peculiarities to do  nothing by halves; and when convinced of the duty of marriage, and that  it was a privilege accorded him in connection with his ministerial  calling, he entered into it on an enlarged scale, by having two wives  sealed to him in the holy bonds of matrimony, for time and eternity,  at the same time; and not long after, another was added to the number,  and then another. Thus, all at once, as it were, from the lone  bachelor he was transformed into a husband invested with many domestic  responsibilities. Probably a realizing sense of the fact that he had  arrived at the mature age of thirty-one years in celibacy, suggested  to him the propriety of making up for lost time by more than ordinary  effort, and out of the old beaten track.    Previous to the administration of those sacred sealing ordinances, he  explained to each of the chosen ones the law, obligations and object of  Celestial Marriage, and that he might be expected to take others--that  the ceremony being precisely the same for each, they would all occupy  the same equal position, no one having a higher claim than another.    It was distinctly understood and agreed between them that their  marriage relations should not, for the time being, be divulged to  the world; but if circumstances should be such that he would wish to  acknowledge as wife, before the world, either one of them, he should be  permitted to do so.    Early in the winter of 1845-6, the Nauvoo Temple was so far completed  that the administration of the sacred ordinances of the Holy  Priesthood was commenced, and continued until about the first of  February--thousands of the Saints receiving endowments and sealings. My  brother and his wives, among the number, had their washings, anointings  and endowments, and were sealed at a holy altar, a privilege and  blessing which they estimated above all earthly honors. When Lorenzo  walked across the inner court of the Temple proceeding to the altar,  accompanied by his four wives, all stately appearing ladies, one of the  Temple officiates exclaimed, \"_And his train filled the Temple_!\"    The wrath and bloodthirsty spirit of our enemies, sustained and  encouraged by State authority, at this time predominated to that degree  that the labors in the Temple were closed, and the energies of the  Saints directed towards a hasty flight, to avoid impending extirpation.  Time and circumstances admitted of very little, and in many instances,  no preparation for a journey of an indefinite length; and to what point  we did not know, but _go we must_.    I crossed the Mississippi river on the 12th of February; my brother,  with a portion of his family, a few days later, after having made the  necessary arrangements for the others to follow. On the day in which  he crossed the river, the Nauvoo Temple took fire, but fortunately the  fire was extinguished before much damage was sustained.    We camped near the bank of the river, in a small grove. We were poorly  prepared for the journey before us, especially at this season of the  year. A heavy snowstorm occurred, after which the weather turned  intensely cold, and caused considerable suffering. My brother had two  wagons and a small tent, one cow and a scanty supply of provisions and  clothing, and yet was much better off than some of our neighbors in our  general encampment.    On the 7th of February, 1846, Brigham Young, our great leader under  God, organized the Camp in order for traveling. Lorenzo was, at this  time or soon after, appointed captain over the ten in which Parley P.  and Orson Pratt and their families were included. On the first day of  March, the ground covered with snow, we broke encampment about noon,  and soon nearly four hundred wagons were moving to--_we knew not where_.    As applicable to the circumstances, I here insert two poems which I  wrote in Camp:      CAMP OF ISRAEL.      No. 1.      Although in woods and tents we dwell,    Shout! shout! O Camp of Israel:    No \"Christian\" mobs on earth can bind    Our thoughts, or steal our peace of mind.      CHORUS.    Though we fly from vile aggression,    We'll maintain our pure profession--    Seek a peaceable possession,    Far from Gentiles and oppression.      We'd better live in tents and smoke,    Than wear the cursed Gentile yoke;    We'd better from our country fly,    Than by mobocracy to die.      CHORUS.--Though we fly, etc.      We've left the City of Nauvoo,    And our beloved Temple too;    And to the wilderness we go,    Amid the winter frosts and snow.      CHORUS.      Our homes were dear--we loved them well--    Beneath our roofs we fain would dwell,    And honor our great God's commands,    By mutual rights of Christian lands.      CHORUS.      Our persecutors will not cease    Their murd'rous spoiling of our peace,    And have decreed that we shall go    To wilds where reeds and rushes grow.      CHORUS.      The Camp, the Camp--its numbers swell--    Shout! shout! O Camp of Israel!    The King, the Lord of hosts is near,    His armies guard our front and rear.      CHORUS.    West side of the Mississippi, Feb. 19th, 1846.      CAMP OF ISRAEL.      No. 2.      Lo, a mighty host of Jacob,    Tented on the western shore    Of the noble Mississippi,    They had crossed, to cross no more.    At the last day-dawn of winter,    Bound with frost and wrapped in snow;    Hark! the cry is \"Onward, onward!    Camp of Israel, rise and go.\"      All at once is life and motion--    Trunks, and beds, and baggage fly;    Oxen yoked, and horses harnessed,    Tents rolled up and passing by:    Soon the carriage wheels are moving,    Onward to a woodland dell,    Where at sunset all are quartered--    Camp of Israel, all is well.      Thickly 'round the tents are clustered,    Neighb'ring smokes together blend;    Supper served, the hymns are chanted,    And the evening prayers ascend.    Last of all the guards are stationed--    Heavens! must guards be serving here?    Who would harm the houseless exiles?    Camp of Israel, never fear.      Where is Freedom? Where is Justice?    Both have from this nation fled;    And the blood of martyred Prophets    Must be answered on it's head!    Therefore, to your tents, O Jacob!    Like our Father Abra'm dwell;    God will execute His purpose--    Camp of Israel, all is well.    March 1st, 1846.        CHAPTER XVI.
