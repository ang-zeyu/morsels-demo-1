REMINISCENCES OF PARIS, FROM 1817 TO 1848.      On the original publication of this work, in German, at Berlin, we  gave in the _International_ some account of it; and we avail ourselves  of the notice in the _Athenaeum_ of an English translation of it which  has just appeared in London, to give some of its best passages. In the  capital of a nation which, above all others, has been wont to project  its gravest interests into the circles of fashion and gayety, the  period included between 1817 and 1848 must have been rich indeed in  matter for observation of all kinds, by the foreigner admitted to its  saloons. With Waterloo at one end of the line, and the overthrow of  Louis Philippe at the other, what a world of change lies  between!--what unexpected turns of fortune, each throwing some new  tint on the chameleon-play of social existence! We may not expect a  lady's eye to see more than its outward features. But these alone, in  such a scene and period, are themselves enough to give some permanent  historical value, as well as a present attraction to the survey, if  only taken with common feminine intelligence.    It is true that the retrospect is not actually so rich as the above  dates would imply.--Connected notices of what might be seen in  Parisian circles do not extend beyond the first seven years of the  period in question. Afterwards, there is nearly a total hiatus, except  in the two departments of music and painting--anecdotes of which are  continued almost to the close of the Orleans dynasty. Of the persons  and events which otherwise filled the scene from 1828 downwards, the  _Reminiscences_ are wholly silent, or only introduce one or two  figures by anticipation while dwelling on the period of the  Restoration. The volume ends, indeed, with a story, in which some of  the very latest exhibitions of somnambulism serve to introduce a  Spanish romance, founded, it may be, on a basis of fact, but evidently  dressed up for effect by one not well enough acquainted with the Spain  of this century to give to the composition a probable air. But here  the display in the Parisian saloon is merely an occasional overture to  the melo-drama that follows; and we learn next to nothing of the new  faces and new fashions which the writer may have seen during the  second half of the term included in her title. What is now published,  therefore, can only be taken as a fragment--destined, perhaps, to be  further completed at some future time.    The work appears anonymously; and it might be uncourteous to pry into  the condition of the writer, beyond what it has pleased herself to  reveal. This is to the effect that she came to Paris, unmarried, and  hardly out of her teens, from some part of Germany, in the second year  of the Restoration, and, at first, was chiefly conversant with the  circles of the _haute finance_. We afterwards hear of her marriage, of  journeyings and absences, and see her in contact with various circles,  but, above all, with painters and musicians; intimate also with  Henriette, the daughter of the celebrated Jewish philosopher,  Mendelssohn. She left Paris, she further says, before the explosion of  1848. More of her personal history she does not tell--and we shall not  take the liberty of guessing.    Her notes are penned without any attempt at order; and make no  pretence to dive far beneath the surface of what she saw in the world.  They contain such light, lady-like reflections as one may fancy taken  down without effort from the kaleidoscope of Paris life, in its balls,  _soirees_, and promenades; and such anecdotes of notable things and  persons as were current in ordinary company--many of which are well  known, having been already reported by others. Here and there a  graphic trait, or a remark above the level of commonplace, gives token  of more lively intelligence, but the general character of the  reminiscence is merely gossipping--just on the ordinary level of such  observations and ideas as prevail in the common talk of the saloons.  It is only when she touches on the fine arts, especially on music,  that the lady displays decidedly clever notions of her own. Gleanings  of this easy kind, from any lesser field than Paris, might hardly have  been worth preserving; here, the abundance of matter is so great, that  even the most careless hand returns from that strange harvest with  some gatherings of value.    Among these we shall dip here and there, without attempting more order  in selection than the author herself has observed in arranging her  notes. Each may be read by and for itself without any disadvantage  whatever.    In no respect, perhaps, does the Paris of to-day differ more from that  of thirty years since than in the article of domestic comfort. After  praising Madame Thuret, one of the financial _lionnes_ of the  Restoration, for her attention to neatness, the lady adds:--         In Paris generally there was a marked contrast to this; as       well as to the Parisian cleanliness of present times. In       those days, even the dwellings of people of competent means,       there was not a trace of comfort. I have a lively       recollection of what happened when one of the younger       partners of M. Thuret gave a ball soon after his marriage.       Although the youth was rich, and had married a wealthy young       lady, the young couple, according to the Parisian custom of       the time, lived with their parents; who, rich as they were,       desiring to be richer still, had let out their splendid       hotel up to the fourth story. In this fourth story the whole       family lived together. After the Parisian finery, I was not       less struck with the Parisian filth of those days; and, in       truth, I should vainly try to paint my amazement on finding       myself compelled, while ascending the staircase, which was       actually plastered with dirt, to hold up my dress as high as       possible in order to appear tolerably clean in the       ball-room.    But if modern Paris has improved in this respect, it has, on the other  hand, we are told, lost far more in the chapter of manners. The  generation born during the first Revolution still preserved some of  the older style of social bearing; but, in the present descendants, we  may now vainly seek for any of the graces that once gave to France her  European credit for politeness.    The French, after lording it over the capitals of Europe for so many  years, were impatient to the last degree of the retribution which the  allied armies brought to their own doors in 1816. Even a returning  _emigre_ could not restrain his rage on finding that--         foreigners held the fortresses, and that he had to submit       his passport for a _vise_ to Prussian, Russian, or English       authorities; and he lost all command of himself at the idea       of the prostration of the _grande gloire Francaise_.... The       same wrath at the occupation of France by foreign troops--an       occupation which lasted for hardly three years--whereas the       French had ravaged Germany for full twenty, from the siege       of Mentz to the battle of Leipsic, was then felt in Paris by       all classes. Every little theatre on the Boulevards played       some piece referring to it in all the _refrains_ urging the       foreigners to be off at once; all the print-shops were full       of caricatures of the English and Russians. The German       soldiers, by-the-by, were, without exception, called       Prussians. At that time there was less hatred expressed       towards the Russians; in the theatres even the people would       point with curiosity to Lostopchin, the author of the       conflagration at Moscow. The hatred of the Russians grew       much more decided under Nicholas. Alexander, on the       contrary, was personally popular. Strictly speaking, the       Prussians were detested; while the English, on the contrary,       served as a perpetual butt for ridicule and wit. Their       language, gestures, dress, afforded a complete series of       dramas and caricatures.    This soreness of France under a very light application of her own  Continental system, brings to mind an anecdote from the papers of the  time, which is worth preserving:--         When the Prussian army entered Paris, one of its officers       made particular interest to be quartered in a certain hotel       in the Faubourg St Germain, the residence of a widow lady of       rank. On taking possession of his billet, the Colonel at       once haughtily refused the apartments offered him; and,       after a survey of the premises, insisted on having the best       suite on the first floor, then occupied by the lady of the       house herself. She protested and entreated in vain--the       Colonel was harsh and peremptory,--the lady had to abandon       her sitting-room, boudoir, and bed-room, and content herself       with the chambers intended for the officer. From these,       however, she was as rudely dislodged on the next day, the       Colonel demanding them for his orderly, and the lady had at       last to creep into a servant's garret. This was not all. On       first taking possession of his rooms the officer had       summoned the _maitre d'hotel_, and commanded a rich dinner       of twelve covers for the entertainment of a party of his       comrades. They came--the cellar had to yield its choicest       wines; the house was filled with bacchanalian uproar. The       orgy was repeated both on the next day and on the next       following. On the morning afterwards the officer presented       himself before the lady of the house. \"You are perhaps       somewhat annoyed by my proceedings in your hotel?\"       \"Certainly,\" was the reply, \"I think I have cause to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36496"],[0,"On the cattle plague: or, Contagious typhus in horned cattle. Its history, (#20)"],[1,"ed.  Observe, that we are now speaking of cattle that have died in the last  stage of this marasmus, so that we might suppose, even if the many  summonses before the magistrates, and the too moderate fines which have  been imposed on the guilty parties, had not shed the broadest light upon  the fact, that _a large number of sick cattle which had been slaughtered  at different stages of this frightful disease, have been dressed and  adorned, exposed for sale, sold, and eaten by a very large portion of  the inhabitants of London and of the country likewise_.    _Digestive Channels._--The mucous membrane of the buccal cavity is, for  the most part, of a livid whiteness; ecchymosed stains, and sometimes  ulcerations, differing in their form and number, are visible on the  floor of the tongue. Mr. Simonds has had an anatomical model  constructed, which presents a perfect type of these ulcerations, some of  which are of a scarlet hue, with perpendicular edges. The _stomachs_  exhibit a variety of ulcerations.    The _paunch_, or first stomach, always contains a large quantity of food  intended for rumination; sometimes these aliments are dry, and lie  sticking to its sides; at other times they are diluted with water which  had not yet been absorbed after drinking. The inner membrane of this  first reservoir may show flat spots, with livid injections of different  sizes.    The _honeycomb_, or second stomach, generally exhibits the same injuries  as the paunch.    The _manyplies_, or third stomach, contains between its laminae hard,  pulverulent, and dry alimentary substances, which are seen sticking to  the different leaves. On removing these substances, some ecchymosed  spots are laid bare, the epithelium of which easily peels off;  sometimes ulcerations, and even perforations, are visible.    The _reed_, or fourth stomach, whose sides are thicker, more fleshy, and  more vascular, exhibits within its folds various kinds of lesions or  sores: they consist of large flat stains of a darkish red, more or less  soft, and sometimes ulcerations red on their deep surface, with clean  edges.    As for the intestines, properly so called, the _duodenum_ shows the same  injuries, but most generally large ecchymosed spots.    The _small intestine_ appears on the outside, even when it preserves its  place in the abdomen, of a reddish colour, lined with vessels distended  with blood, the signs of a general congestion of its membranes. The  examination of the mucous membrane, after it has been cut open  lengthways, shows, indeed, that this portion of the digestive tube is  the principal seat of the distemper; for, independently of this general  injection, you perceive ulcerations which have succeeded to detached  pustules or lengthy flat spots, the result of a cluster of several of  Peyer's glands, brought together by the plastic influence of  inflammation. These flat spots, or wafers, very similar to those we  observe in the typhoid fever of man, are inflamed and ulcerated in  different degrees.    The mucous membrane of the _large intestine_ exhibits lesions depending  on the period of the disease. About the third period, the injection is  sometimes general, especially near the rectum; but in the fourth and  last period we often meet with ulcerations which are smaller in the  upper part, larger and deeper about the lower or rectal part. The  membrane of the sexual parts of the cow is strongly injected, and of a  dull red colour.    As we have seen, the different organs of the digestive apparatus may, in  this typhus, offer to view extensive alterations perfectly consistent  with the gravity of the symptoms or the functional derangements. In two  cases in which disorders of the respiration had prevailed, and which had  been sacrificed on the eighth or tenth day of the disease, we only  observed partial injections of a very limited character, either on the  gastric membranes or on that of the intestine, and which might have  been detected in the case of common intestinal inflammation. Therefore,  in these two cases, the characteristic lesions of the typhus, if they  must be localized in the intestine, were, so to speak, absolutely  wanting. It was, we will not say exactly the same, on four other  animals, three oxen and one cow; but if, in two of them, the fourth  stomach was inflamed, if in the third the small intestine was congested,  and if, lastly, in the cow the large intestine showed ulcerations, we  could not in these lesions distinguish those of typhoid fever.    These facts struck us with great surprise, for we were far from  suspecting them. We hoped, on opening the intestine of these animals,  which had certainly all died of the typhus, to meet assuredly in a  determined spot some well-known lesion declared beforehand. To our great  astonishment, such has not always been the case. So that our theories,  conclusive as they seemed on the identity of the ox typhus and the  typhoid fever in man, and which more than anyone else we wished to see  confirmed, must submit to observation.    In fine, in this epizootia the intestinal lesions or sores present  different appearances. Developed to the utmost in some cases, so much so  as to exhibit ulcerations at the root of the tongue as well as in the  intestines, and to be in a manner the excess of the injuries which are  seen in typhoid fever, they are in other cases scarcely perceptible, and  sometimes entirely absent, when the animal is struck down in the third  or fourth period, that is to say, when the exanthematic or pustular  state has had time to develope itself on the digestive channels. One of  these animals seized by Mr. Tegg at the Camden Town market, was in such  a state of exhaustion that he could not be driven to the  slaughter-house, only two hundred yards distant; they were forced to  fell him on the spot midway, in order to have him conveyed to the place  of dissection. We only detected partial injections on the digestive tube  of this beast. The pulmonary emphysema which had caused this animal's  death was developed in the highest degree.--He was opened at the request  of M. Bouley, of Alfort.    _Apparatus of Respiration._--Here, again, the typhus shows us injuries  which differ from those of typhoid fever; for if the breathing is always  more or less obstructed at the outbreak of this fever, no serious  organic change in the lungs is the consequence thereof. In the ox  typhus, on the contrary, when the pulmonary form prevails, the  derangements of the respiratory organs are remarkable. Thus, the mucous  membrane of the nostrils, from which flows a purulent and fetid mucus,  is sometimes ulcerated and excoriated. The larynx and the trachea or  windpipe, choked up with frothy mucus, show the same alterations, though  less frequently. The lungs, which are rather congested than inflamed,  are emphysematous, the air having entered and distended the cellular  tissue which unites the lobes together.    In some cases, the lungs are so gorged with air that their lobes  constitute but a single heap, rendering them irrecognisable, so greatly  do their volume, their specific gravity, and their spongy aeriform  aspect differ from the natural state.    _Apparatus of Circulation._--The inner sides of the heart show  ecchymosed spots, and the same is the case with the larger vessels. The  blood, diminished in its quantity and altered in its quality, is  blackish and more fluid; but in most cases it coagulates instantaneously  and in a mass, without separating into its solid and liquid parts.    _Nervous System._--Having observed and dissected the dead bodies at the  slaughter-houses of the markets, we were not able to examine either the  brain or the spinal marrow. Besides, let us remark in this place, that  the mode of felling cattle in England would have rendered impossible  such an examination. For the animals are struck with a club, which kills  them both by cerebral concussion and by the direct alteration of the  brain; the instrument having a sharp end which perforates the skull and  injures the cerebral lobes. Nor is this all; the moment the animal is  struck down, a flexible rod is inserted into the hole made in the skull,  and driven as far as the spinal canal, so as to tear to pieces the  protuberance and the bulb, that is to say, the vital knot. This manner  of killing cattle seems to us, however, preferable to the one adopted  in France, where the animal does not sink till he has been struck  repeatedly with the club.    But be that as it may, those authors who have examined the nervous  centres of horned cattle which had perished victims of the typhus, have  usually found the meninges, or membranes that envelope the brain,  injected, whilst the brain itself was slightly dotted over with blood.    These anatomical lesions of the nervous centres being insufficient of  themselves to explain the death at the second period, we have  endeavoured to give the explanation of it in treating of the symptoms.    The other organs, the spleen, the liver, the kidneys, present  alterations of a secondary interest only.      III.        _Diagnosis--Prognosis--Use of the Flesh of Animals which have        Died of the Typhus--Danger of direct Absorption._    The typhus of the ox has such distinct and strongly marked  characteristics that it is not easily mistaken. However, to conform  ourselves to received custom, I will say some words about the principal  symptoms of some distempers affecting the ox, between which and typhus  unprofessional persons might be embarrassed, and hesitate to distinguish  them. We will transfer, however, those particulars pertaining to the  diagnosis to the part written for the special use of agriculturists,  farmers, and graziers, in order that they may readily find whatever it  may be necessary for them to know when they chance to have any sick and  tainted cattle to treat and cure.
