Will he be able to  convince the Court that the second Act is valid, when the first is  invalid and void?  What good does it do to pass a second Act?  Why, it  will have the effect to arraign the Supreme Court before the People, and  to bring them into all the political discussions of the Country.  Will  that do any good?  * * *    \"The functions of Congress are to enact the Statutes, the province of  the Court is to pronounce upon their validity, and the duty of the  Executive is to carry the decision into effect when rendered by the  Court.  And yet, notwithstanding the Constitution makes the decision of  the Court final in regard to the validity of an Act of Congress, Mr.  Lincoln is going to reverse that decision by passing another Act of  Congress.  When he has become convinced of the Folly of the proposition,  perhaps he will resort to the same subterfuge that I have found others  of his Party resort to, which is to agitate and agitate until he can  change the Supreme Court and put other men in the places of the present  incumbents.\"    After ridiculing this proposition at some length, he proceeded:    \"Mr. Lincoln is alarmed for fear that, under the Dred Scott decision,  Slavery will go into all the Territories of the United States.  All I  have to say is that, with or without this decision, Slavery will go just  where the People want it, and not an inch further.  * * *  Hence, if the  People of a Territory want Slavery, they will encourage it by passing  affirmatory laws, and the necessary police regulations, patrol laws and  Slave Code; if they do not want it, they will withhold that legislation,  and, by withholding it, Slavery is as dead as if it was prohibited by a  Constitutional prohibition, especially if, in addition, their  legislation is unfriendly, as it would be if they were opposed to it.\"    Then, taking up what he said was \"Mr. Lincoln's main objection to the  Dred Scott decision,\" to wit: \"that that decision deprives the Negro of  the benefits of that clause of the Constitution of the United States  which entitles the citizens of each State to all the privileges and  immunities of citizens of the several States,\" and admitting that such  would be its effect, Mr. Douglas contended at some length that this  Government was \"founded on the White basis\" for the benefit of the  Whites and their posterity.  He did \"not believe that it was the design  or intention of the signers of the Declaration of Independence or the  frames of the Constitution to include Negroes, Indians, or other  inferior races, with White men as citizens;\" nor that the former \"had  any reference to Negroes, when they used the expression that all men  were created equal,\" nor to \"any other inferior race.\"  He held that,  \"They were speaking only of the White race, and never dreamed that their  language would be construed to apply to the Negro;\" and after ridiculing  the contrary view, insisted that, \"The history of the Country shows that  neither the signers of the Declaration, nor the Framers of the  Constitution, ever supposed it possible that their language would be  used in an attempt to make this Nation a mixed Nation of Indians,  Negroes, Whites, and Mongrels.\"    The \"Fathers proceeded on the White basis, making the White people the  governing race, but conceding to the Indian and Negro, and all inferior  races, all the rights and all the privileges they could enjoy consistent  with the safety of the society in which they lived.  That,\" said he, \"is  my opinion now.  I told you that humanity, philanthropy, justice, and  sound policy required that we should give the Negro every right, every  privilege, every immunity consistent with the safety and welfare of the  State.  The question, then, naturally arises, what are those rights and  privileges, and what is the nature and extent of them?  My answer is,  that that is a question which each State and each Territory must decide  for itself.  * * *  I am content with that position.  My friend Lincoln  is not.  * * *  He thinks that the Almighty made the Negro his equal and  his brother.  For my part I do not consider the Negro any kin to me, nor  to any other White man; but I would still carry my humanity and my  philanthropy to the extent of giving him every privilege and every  immunity that he could enjoy, consistent with our own good.\"    After again referring to the principles connected with non-interference  in the domestic institutions of the States and Territories, and to the  devotion of all his energies to them \"since 1850, when,\" said he, \"I  acted side by side with the immortal Clay and the god-like Webster, in  that memorable struggle in which Whigs and Democrats united upon a  common platform of patriotism and the Constitution, throwing aside  partisan feelings in order to restore peace and harmony to a distracted  Country\"--he alluded to the death-bed of Clay, and the pledges made by  himself to both Clay and Webster to devote his own life to the  vindication of the principles of that Compromise of 1850 as a means of  preserving the Union; and concluded with this appeal: \"This Union can  only be preserved by maintaining the fraternal feeling between the North  and the South, the East and the West.  If that good feeling can be  preserved, the Union will be as perpetual as the fame of its great  founders.  It can be maintained by preserving the sovereignty of the  States, the right of each State and each Territory to settle its  domestic concerns for itself, and the duty of each to refrain from  interfering with the other in any of its local or domestic institutions.  Let that be done, and the Union will be perpetual; let that be done, and  this Republic, which began with thirteen States and which now numbers  thirty-two, which when it began, only extended from the Atlantic to the  Mississippi, but now reaches to the Pacific, may yet expand, North and  South, until it covers the whole Continent, and becomes one vast  ocean-bound Confederacy.  Then, my friends, the path of duty, of honor,  of patriotism, is plain.  There are a few simple principles to be  preserved.  Bear in mind the dividing line between State rights and  Federal authority; let us maintain the great principles of Popular  Sovereignty, of State rights and of the Federal Union as the  Constitution has made it, and this Republic will endure forever.\"    On the next evening, July 17th, at Springfield, both Douglas and Lincoln  addressed separate meetings.    After covering much the same ground with regard to the history of the  Kansas-Nebraska struggle and his own attitude upon it, as he did in his  previous speech, Mr. Douglas declined to comment upon Mr. Lincoln's  intimation of a Conspiracy between Douglas, Pierce, Buchanan, and Taney  for the passage of the Nebraska Bill, the rendition of the Dred Scott  decision, and the extension of Slavery, but proceeded to dilate on the  \"uniformity\" issue between himself and Mr. Lincoln, in much the same  strain as before, tersely summing up with the statement that \"there is a  distinct issue of principles--principles irreconcilable--between Mr.  Lincoln and myself.  He goes for consolidation and uniformity in our  Government.  I go for maintaining the Confederation of the Sovereign  States under the Constitution, as our fathers made it, leaving each  State at liberty to manage its own affairs and own internal  institutions.\"    He then ridiculed, at considerable length, Mr. Lincoln's proposed  methods of securing a reversal by the United States Supreme Court of the  Dred Scott decision--especially that of an \"appeal to the People to  elect a President who will appoint judges who will reverse the Dred  Scott decision,\" which he characterized as \"a proposition to make that  Court the corrupt, unscrupulous tool of a political party,\" and asked,  \"when we refuse to abide by Judicial decisions, what protection is there  left for life and property?  To whom shall you appeal?  To mob law, to  partisan caucuses, to town meetings, to revolution?  Where is the remedy  when you refuse obedience to the constituted authorities?\"  In other  respects the speech was largely a repetition of his Bloomington speech.    Mr. Lincoln in his speech, the same night, at Springfield, opened by  contrasting the disadvantages under which, by reason of an unfair  apportionment of State Legislative representation and otherwise, the  Republicans of Illinois labored in this fight.  Among other  disadvantages--whereby he said the Republicans were forced \"to fight  this battle upon principle and upon principle alone\"--were those which  he said arose \"out of the relative positions of the two persons who  stand before the State as candidates for the Senate.\"    Said he: \"Senator Douglas is of world-wide renown.  All the anxious  politicians of his Party, or who have been of his Party for years past,  have been looking upon him as certainly, at no distant day, to be the  President of the United States.  They have seen in his round, jolly,  fruitful face, Post-offices, Land-offices, Marshalships, and Cabinet  appointments, Chargeships and Foreign Missions, bursting and sprouting  out in wonderful exuberance, ready to be laid hold of by their greedy  hands.  And as they have been gazing upon this attractive picture so  long, they cannot, in the little distraction that has taken place in the  party, bring themselves to give up the charming hope; but with greedier  anxiety they rush about him, sustain him, and give him marches,  triumphal entries, and receptions, beyond what even in the days of his  highest prosperity they could have brought about in his favor.  On the  contrary, nobody has ever expected me to be President.  In my poor,  lean, lank face, nobody has ever seen that any cabbages were sprouting  out.\"    Then he described the main points of Senator Douglas's plan of campaign"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7144"],[0,"While the Billy Boils (#20)"],[1,"behind them is the line of blue hills; in  front is the famous Bakery Hill, and down to the left Golden Point. Two  mounted troopers are riding up over Specimen Hill. What do they want?    They take the brother away, handcuffed. Manslaughter last night.  Cause--drink and jealousy.    The vision is gone again. Thud, thud, goes the pick; it counts the years  that follow--one, two, three, four, up to twenty, and then it stops for  the next scene--a selection on the banks of a bright river in New South  Wales. The little homestead is surrounded by vines and fruit-trees. Many  swarms of bees work under the shade of the trees, and a crop of wheat is  nearly ripe on the hillside.    A man and a boy are engaged in clearing a paddock just below the  homestead. They are father and son; the son, a boy of about seventeen,  is the image of his father.    Horses' feet again! Here comes Nemesis in mounted troopers' uniform.    The mail was stuck up last night about five miles away, and a refractory  passenger shot. The son had been out 'possum shooting' all night with  some friends.    The troopers take the son away handcuffed: \"Robbery under arms.\"    The father was taking out a stump when the troopers came. His foot is  still resting on the spade, which is half driven home. He watches the  troopers take the boy up to the house, and then, driving the spade to  its full depth, he turns up another sod. The troopers reach the door of  the homestead; but still he digs steadily, and does not seem to hear his  wife's cry of despair. The troopers search the boy's room and bring  out some clothing in two bundles; but still the father digs. They have  saddled up one of the farm horses and made the boy mount. The father  digs. They ride off along the ridge with the boy between them. The  father never lifts his eyes; the hole widens round the stump; he digs  away till the brave little wife comes and takes him gently by the arm.  He half rouses himself and follows her to the house like an obedient  dog.    Trial and disgrace follow, and then other misfortunes, pleuro among the  cattle, drought, and poverty.    Thud, thud, thud again! But it is not the sound of the fossicker's  pick--it is the fall of sods on his wife's coffin.    It is a little bush cemetery, and he stands stonily watching them  fill up her grave. She died of a broken heart and shame. \"I can't bear  disgrace! I can't bear disgrace!\" she had moaned all these six weary  years--for the poor are often proud.    But he lives on, for it takes a lot to break a man's heart. He holds  up his head and toils on for the sake of a child that is left, and that  child is--Isley.    And now the fossicker seems to see a vision of the future. He seems to  be standing somewhere, an old, old man, with a younger one at his side;  the younger one has Isley's face. Horses' feet again! Ah, God! Nemesis  once more in troopers' uniform!    The fossicker falls on his knees in the mud and clay at the bottom of  the drive, and prays Heaven to take his last child ere Nemesis comes for  him.      Long Bob Sawkins had been known on the diggings as \"Bob the Devil.\"  His profile at least from one side, certainly did recall that of the  sarcastic Mephistopheles; but the other side, like his true character,  was by no means a devil's. His physiognomy had been much damaged,  and one eye removed by the premature explosion of a blast in some old  Ballarat mine. The blind eye was covered with a green patch, which gave  a sardonic appearance to the remaining features.    He was a stupid, heavy, good-natured Englishman. He stuttered a little,  and had a peculiar habit of wedging the monosyllable \"why\" into his  conversation at times when it served no other purpose than to fill up  the pauses caused by his stuttering; but this by no means assisted him  in his speech, for he often stuttered over the \"why\" itself.    The sun was getting low down, and its yellow rays reached far up among  the saplings of Golden Gully when Bob appeared coming down by the  path that ran under the western hill. He was dressed in the usual  costume-cotton shirt, moleskin trousers, faded hat and waistcoat, and  blucher boots. He carried a pick over his shoulder, the handle of which  was run through the heft of a short shovel that hung down behind, and  he had a big dish under his arm. He paused opposite the shaft with the  windlass, and hailed the boy in his usual form of salutation.    \"Look, see here Isley!\"    \"What is it, Bob?\"    \"I seed a young--why--magpie up in the scrub, and yer oughter be able to  catch it.\"    \"Can't leave the shaft; father's b'low.\"    \"How did yer father know there was any--why--wash in the old shaft?\"    \"Seed old Corney in town Saturday, 'n he said thur was enough to make it  worth while bailin' out. Bin bailin' all the mornin'.\"    Bob came over, and letting his tools down with a clatter he hitched up  the knees of his moleskins and sat down on one heel.    \"What are yer--why--doin' on the slate, Isley?\" said he, taking out an  old clay pipe and lighting it.    \"Sums,\" said Isley.    Bob puffed away at his pipe a moment.    \"'Tain't no use!\" he said, sitting down on the clay and drawing his  knees up. \"Edication's a failyer.\"    \"Listen at 'im!\" exclaimed the boy. \"D'yer mean ter say it ain't no use  learnin' readin' and writin' and sums?\"    \"Isley!\"    \"Right, father.\"    The boy went to the windlass and let the bucket down. Bob offered  to help him wind up, but Isley, proud of showing his strength to his  friend, insisted on winding by himself.    \"You'll be--why--a strong man some day, Isley,\" said Bob, landing the  bucket.    \"Oh, I could wind up a lot more'n father puts in. Look how I greased  the handles! It works like butter now,\" and the boy sent the handles  spinning round with a jerk to illustrate his meaning.    \"Why did they call yer Isley for?\" queried Bob, as they resumed their  seats. \"It ain't yer real name, is it?\"    \"No, my name's Harry. A digger useter say I was a isle in the ocean to  father 'n mother, 'n then I was nicknamed Isle, 'n then Isley.\"    \"You hed a--why--brother once, didn't yer?\"    \"Yes, but thet was afore I was borned. He died, at least mother used ter  say she didn't know if he was dead; but father says he's dead as fur's  he's concerned.\"    \"And your father hed a brother, too. Did yer ever--why--hear of him?\"    \"Yes, I heard father talkin' about it wonst to mother. I think father's  brother got into some row in a bar where a man was killed.\"    \"And was yer--why--father--why--fond of him?\"    \"I heard father say that he was wonst, but thet was all past.\"    Bob smoked in silence for a while, and seemed to look at some dark  clouds that were drifting along like a funeral out in the west.  Presently he said half aloud something that sounded like \"All,  all--why--past.\"    \"Eh?\" said Isley.    \"Oh, it's--why, why--nothin',\" answered Bob, rousing himself. \"Is that a  paper in yer father's coat-pocket, Isley?\"    \"Yes,\" said the boy, taking it out.    Bob took the paper and stared hard at it for a moment or so.    \"There's something about the new goldfields there,\" said Bob, putting  his finger on a tailor's advertisement. \"I wish you'd--why--read it to  me, Isley; I can't see the small print they uses nowadays.\"    \"No, thet's not it,\" said the boy, taking the paper, \"it's something  about--\"    \"Isley!\"    \"'Old on, Bob, father wants me.\"    The boy ran to the shaft, rested his hands and forehead against the bole  of the windlass, and leant over to hear what his father was saying.    Without a moment's warning the treacherous bole slipped round; a small  body bounded a couple of times against the sides of the shaft and fell  at Mason's feet, where it lay motionless!      \"Mason!\"    \"Ay?\"    \"Put him in the bucket and lash him to the rope with your belt!\"    A few moments, and--    \"Now, Bob!\"    Bob's trembling hands would scarcely grasp the handle, but he managed to  wind somehow.    Presently the form of the child appeared, motionless and covered with  clay and water. Mason was climbing up by the steps in the side of the  shaft.    Bob tenderly unlashed the boy and laid him under the saplings on the  grass; then he wiped some of the clay and blood away from the child's  forehead, and dashed over him some muddy water.    Presently Isley gave a gasp and opened his eyes.    \"Are yer--why--hurt much, Isley?\" asked Bob.    \"Ba-back's bruk, Bob!\"    \"Not so bad as that, old man.\"    \"Where's father?\"    \"Coming up.\"    Silence awhile, and then--    \"Father! father! be quick, father!\"    Mason reached the surface and came and knelt by the other side of the  boy.    \"I'll, I'll--why--run fur some brandy,\" said Bob.    \"No use, Bob,\" said Isley. \"I'm all bruk up.\"    \"Don't yer feel better, sonny?\"    \"No--I'm--goin' to--die, Bob.\"    \"Don't say it, Isley,\" groaned Bob.    A short silence, and then the boy's body suddenly twisted with pain. But  it was soon over. He lay still awhile, and then said quietly:    \"Good-bye, Bob!\"    Bob made a vain attempt to speak. \"Isley!\" he said,\"---\"    The child turned and stretched out his hands to the silent, stony-faced  man on the other side.    \"Father--father, I'm goin'!\"    A shuddering groan broke from Mason's lips, and then all was quiet.    Bob had taken off his hat to wipe his, forehead, and his face, in spite  of its disfigurement, was strangely like the face of the stone-like man  opposite.    For a moment they looked at one another across the body of the child,  and then Bob said quietly:    \"He never knowed.\"    \"What does it matter?\" said Mason gruffly; and, taking up the dead  child, he walked towards the hut.    It was a very sad little group that gathered outside Mason's but next  morning. Martin's wife had been there all the morning cleaning up and  doing what she could. One of the women had torn up her husband's only  white shirt for a shroud, and they had made the little body look clean  and even"]]]
