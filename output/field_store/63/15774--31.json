The lower storey was built so as to be shot proof, as I  designed it as a place of retreat from stray shot for non-combatants,  in the event of the Residency being again, as it had been before,  subjected to a cross-fire from contending parties during one of the  many revolutions so common to Manipur. Little did I dream that folly,  and incompetency would ever lead to our being directly attacked!    The large compound, about sixteen acres in extent, was surrounded  by a mud breastwork and ditch, quite capable of being defended, if  necessary, and there were four entrances which I named respectively,  the Great Gate, the Milking Gate, my cows'-shed being close to it,  the Water Gate and the Kang-joop-kool Gate. I made a riding road all  round to exercise ponies, and besides making a splendid kitchen garden,  adding considerably to Colonel McCulloch's, we laid out flower beds,  and had cool shady spots for the heat of the day. Deodars and other  exotic trees were imported by me and throve wonderfully. One large  sheet of water with an island in the centre was cleared, deepened,  and the banks repaired, and as I never allowed a bird to be killed, it  was covered in winter with water-fowls to the number of four hundred  and fifty or five hundred of every kind, from wild geese downwards,  and rare birds took refuge in the trees. In the north-east corner of  the compound were the lines for my escort, with a tank of the purest  drinking water, where formerly squalor and filth had held sway. Finally  I covered most of the large trees with beautiful orchids, so that in  the season we had a blaze of colour. I spared no expense on the garden,  and we were rewarded. Altogether the Residency and its grounds formed  a beautiful and comfortable resting-place.    The new building was also commodious and contained a handsome  Durbar-room for receptions 24 feet square, fine dining and  drawing-rooms, very airy and comfortable bedrooms, etc., with an  office for myself. The pantry was so arranged that cold draughts  of air, so great a drawback in Indian houses in cold weather,  were avoided when dinner was being brought in. The bedrooms had  fireplaces, and the sitting-rooms excellent stoves which in winter  were very necessary. The shot-proof rooms in the basement were not  used, except one for a storeroom, and the one under the verandah of  the Durbar-room, used as a sleeping place by the men of my guard.    The Great Gate was a picturesque half-timber structure, with rooms on  either side, one of which I built specially as a pneumonia hospital,  so it was designed with a view to maintaining an equable temperature,  pneumonia being a great scourge among newly arrived Hindoostani  sepoys. Not long after I left, it was diverted to other purposes,  being considered too good for a hospital!    \"With the exception of the Residency, no house when I left Manipur,  was built of brick, partly from fear of earthquakes, partly on  account of expense. The ordinary houses of the people are huts with  wattle and daub or mud walls, those of greater folks the same, but  on a larger scale. Every house has a verandah in front with the main  entrance leading from it, and a little side door on the north side  close to the west end, the houses invariably facing east. The roofs  are all of thatch, with the exception of the Rajah's, which was of  corrugated iron. There were several temples built of brick stuccoed  over. One in the palace had an iron roof, another a gilded one. I  sent some models of these temples and several other buildings to the  Indian and Colonial Exhibition of 1886, every beam and rafter being  represented and made according to scale. The larger of the temples  had bells of a fine deep tone. Some of the approaches to the Rajah's  dwelling-house were made of brick. Formerly the palace enclosure  was entered from the front by a quaint and picturesque old gateway,  not beautiful, but characteristic of Manipur; the old Rajah Chandra  Kirtee Singh substituted for it a tawdry and fantastic structure with  a corrugated iron roof, a structure without any merit, and quite out  of keeping with its surroundings. I remonstrated in vain; shoddy and  vulgar tastes had penetrated even to Manipur, and the picturesque  old building that spoke of bygone ages was doomed; but we who have  destroyed so many fine buildings, have little right to criticise.    \"Close to the gateway is the place where the grand stand is erected,  from which the Rajah and his relations view the boat races on the  palace moat. I say 'view,' as in old age, a Rajah sits there all  the time; but in the prime of life he takes part in these races,  steering one of the boats himself. These boat races generally take  place in September when the moat is full, and are the great event  of the year. Every one turns out to see them, the Ranees and other  female relations being on the opposite side of the moat, for in Manipur  there is no concealment of women, while the side next to the road is  thronged with spectators. The boatmen have a handsome dress peculiar  to the occasion, and the whole scene is highly interesting. The boats  are canoes hewn out of single trees of great size, and are decorated  with colour and carving.\" [21]    The valley of Manipur is hot and steamy in the rainy season, and  Colonel McCulloch built a small hut at a place called Kang-joop-kool,  situated on a spur of the Kowpree range, to the west of the valley  at a height of 5170 feet above the sea. The distance from the capital  was fourteen miles, and four from the foot of the hills, and he lived  there for the whole of the rainy season, except for a few visits to  the capital. His successors till my time did not stay there much,  but I bought a small hut from my immediate predecessor, and pulled it  down, and built a new one far more commodious. I enclosed the land,  and laid out a small garden, and planted a wood of Khasia pines,  the land being quite bare, and in time it became a most charming  place. It was pleasant to leave the ceremonial life at the capital,  where I never walked out without a train of followers clad in scarlet  liveries, and settle down quietly at Kang-joop-kool where we could  roam about the hills as if we had been in England.    I spent little or no time in sporting, my eyes were never very good,  and before I came to Manipur had become so deficient in what oculists  call power of \"accommodation,\" that, though formerly a fairly good  shot, I was then a bad one. In one way this was an advantage, as all  my interests were concentrated on my work, and nothing of greater  interest could have been found. Somehow or other, there was subject  for conversation with State officials and non-officials, to last me  from early morning till night, and fill up every spare moment. My  door was always open, and the guard at the great gate had orders to  let every one pass. All the minor gates were unguarded.    No attempt was made by the Durbar, as in other native states, to  bribe the Residency servants, except in one notable case that happened  before my time. All negotiations were carried on with the Political  Agent direct, and the penurious Manipuris would have thought it waste  of money to bribe his servants. This was a very satisfactory state  of things, and probably saved many unpleasant complications.    In my dealings with the Durbar, I always tried to bear in mind that  I was the representative of the strong dealing with the weak, and  so to ignore little silly acts of self-assertion, such as a native  court loves to indulge in, and childish ebullitions, as unworthy of  notice. Whenever it became necessary for me to interfere, I did so  with great firmness, but always tried to carry the Maharajah and his  ministers with me, and make any desired reform appear to emanate from  him. Except on one occasion, I never experienced any rudeness from  an official.    At the same time when any attempt was made to infringe on the rights of  the British Government or its subjects, I spoke in very unmistakable  language. I think the Durbar gave me credit for good intentions and  appreciated my desire to work with them; of course they tried to get  all they could out of me, and it was a daily, but, on the whole,  friendly struggle between us. I knew perfectly well that to exalt  themselves, the Court party spoke of me behind my back in disparaging  terms, and boasted of what they could do, and of their independence  of the British Government, but I was quite satisfied that they did  not believe what they said, and that in all important matters they  deferred to me on every point, and were always coming to me to help  them out of difficulties. I kept in mind Colonel McCulloch's wise  saying to the Rajah: \"I don't care what you say of me, so long as  you do as I tell you.\"                CHAPTER XIII.        Violent conduct of Prince Koireng--A rebuke--Service      payment--Advantage of Manipuri system--Customs      duty--Slavery--Releasing slaves--Chowba's fidelity--Sepoy's      kindness to children--Visit to the Yoma range.      An incident occurred which might have caused some trouble, while  it served to show the violent disposition of Kotwal Koireng, later  known as the Senaputtee. One evening my Naga interpreter reported  to me that an Angami Naga of Kohima had been cruelly assaulted by  that prince, while he was passing along the road to the east of the  palace enclosure. Soon after the man was brought in to me, and an  examination by my native doctor proved that he was suffering from a  severe contusion above the right eye, which might or might not prove  fatal. Now, strictly speaking, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3785"],[0,"In the Reign of Terror: The Adventures of a Westminster Boy (#20)"],[1,"if Harry undertakes it,\" Jeanne said,  with implicit trust in his powers.    Harry laughed, and even Marie, anxious as she was, could not help  smiling.    \"I will try and deserve your confidence, Jeanne; but I am not a  magician. But I will talk it over with\"--and he hesitated--\"with  a young fellow who is, like myself, a Royalist, and in disguise.  Luckily, we ran against each other the other day, and after a  little conversation discovered each other. He, too, has relatives  in prison, and will, I am sure, join me in any scheme I may undertake.  Two heads are better than one, and four are much better than two  when it comes to acting.  And now I must say good-night. I hope  when I see you again I shall be able to tell you that I have formed  some sort of plan for their release.\"          CHAPTER VII    The 2d of September      Victor de Gisons was, as usual, waiting near the door when Harry  left Louise Moulin's.    \"What is the news, Henri? Nothing suspicious, I hope? You are out  sooner than usual.\"    \"Yes, for I have something to think of. Here have we been planning  in vain for the last fortnight to hit upon some scheme for getting  our friends out of prison, and Jeanne has pointed out a way which  you and I never thought of.\"    \"What is that, Henri?\"    \"The simplest thing in the world, namely, that we should seize one  of the leaders of these villains and compel him to sign an order  for their release.\"    \"That certainly seems possible,\" Victor said. \"I wonder it never  occurred to either of us. But how is it to be done?\"    \"Ah, that is for us to think out! Jeanne has given us the idea, and  we should be stupid if we cannot invent the details. In the first  place we have got to settle which of them it had better be, and  in the next how it is to be managed. It must be some one whose  signature the people at the prison would be sure to obey.\"    \"Then,\" Victor said, \"it must be either Danton or Robespierre.\"    \"Or Marat,\" Harry added; \"I think he is as powerful as either of  the others.\"    \"He is the worst of them, anyhow,\" Victor said. \"There is something  straightforward about Danton. No doubt he is ambitious, but I think  his hatred of us all is real. He is a terrible enemy, and will  certainly stick at nothing. He is ruthless and pitiless, but I do  not think he is double-faced. Robespierre is  ambitious too, but  I think he is really acting according to his principles, such as  they are. He would be pitiless too, but he would murder on principle.    \"He would sign unmoved the order for a hundred heads to fall if he  thought their falling necessary or even useful for the course of  the Revolution, but I do not think he would shed a drop of blood  to satisfy private enmity. They call him the 'incorruptible.' He is  more dangerous than Danton, for he has no vices. He lives simply,  and they say is fond of birds and pets. I do not think we should  make much of either Danton or him, even if we got them in our power.    \"Danton would be like a wild beast in a snare. He would rage with  fury, but I do not think that he would be intimidated into signing  what we require, not do I think would Robespierre. Marat is a  different creature altogether. He is simply venomous. He hates the  world, and would absolutely rejoice in slaughter. So loathsome is  he in appearance that even his colleagues shrink from him. He is a  venomous reptile whom it would be a pleasure to slay, as it would  be to put one's heel upon a rattlesnake. Whether he is a coward  or not I do not know, but I should think so. Men of his type are  seldom brave. I think if we had him in our hands we might frighten  him into doing what we want.\"    \"Then Marat it shall be,\" Harry said; \"that much is settled. Tomorrow  we will find out something about his  habits. Till we know about  that we cannot form any plan whatever. Let us meet at dinner-time  at our usual place. Then we will  go outside the Assembly and wait  till he comes out. Fortunately we both know him well by sight.  He  will be sure to go, surrounded, as usual, by a mob of his admirers,  to the Jacobin Club. From there we can trace him to his home. No  doubt anyone could tell us where he lives, but it would be dangerous  to ask. When we have found that out we can decide upon our next  step.\"    They were, however, saved the trouble they contemplated, for they  learned from the conversation of two men among the mob, who cheered  Marat as he entered the Assembly, what they wanted to know.    \"Marat is the man for me,\" one of them said. \"He hates the aristocracy;  he would bathe in their blood. I never miss reading his articles  in the Friend of the People. His cry is always 'Blood! Blood!' He  does not ape the manner of the bourgeois. He does not wash his face  and put on clean linen. He is a  great man, but he is as dirty as  the best of us. He still lives in his old lodgings, though he could  move if he liked into any of the fine houses whose owners are in  the prisons. He wants no servants, but lives just as we do. Vive  Marat!\"    \"Where does the great citizen live?\" Victor asked the men in a  tone of earnest entreaty. On learning the address they took their  way to the dirty and disreputable street where Marat lodged.    \"The citizen Marat lives in this street, does he not?\" Victor asked  a man lounging at the door of a cabaret.    \"Yes, in that house opposite. Do you want him?\"    \"No; only I was curious to see the house where the friend of the  people lives, and as I was passing the end of the street turned  down.  Will you drink a glass?\"    \"I am always ready for that,\" the man said, \"but in these hard  times one cannot do it as often as one would like.\"    \"That is true enough,\" Victor said as they took their seats at  a table. \"And so Marat lives over there; it's not much of a place  for a great man.\"    \"It is all he wants,\" the other said carelessly; \"and he is safer  here than he would be in the richer quarters. There would be a plot  against him, and those cursed Royalists would kill him if they had  the chance; but he is always escorted home from the club by a band  of patriots.\"    In the evening Harry and Victor returned to the street and watched  until Marat returned from the Jacobin Club. His escort of men with  torches and bludgeons left him at the door, but two or three went  upstairs with him, and until far in the night visitors came and  went. Then the light in the upper room was extinguished.    \"It is not such an easy affair,\" Victor said as they moved away;  \"and you see, as that man in the wine-shop told us, there is an  old woman who cooks for him, and it is much more difficult to seize  two people without an alarm being given than one.\"    \"That is so,\" Harry agreed; \"but it must be done somehow.  Every  day matters grow more threatening, and those bands of scoundrels  from Marseilles have not been brought all this way for nothing.  The worst of it is, we have such a short time to act. Marat does  not seem to be ever alone from early morning until late at night.  Supposing we did somehow get the order of release from him at night  we could not present it till the  morning, and before we could  present it some one might arrive and discover him fastened up, and  might take the news to the prison before we could get them out.\"    \"Yes, that is very serious,\" Victor agreed. \"I begin to despair,  Henri.\"    \"We must not do that,\" Harry rejoined. \"You see we thought it  impossible before till Jeanne gave us the idea. There must be some  way out of it if we could only hit upon it. Perhaps by to-morrow  morning an idea will occur to one of us. And there is another thing  to be thought of; we must procure disguises for them. It would be  of no use whatever getting them out unless we could conceal them  after they are freed. It would not do for them to go to Louise  Moulin's.  She has three visitors already, and the arrival of more  to stay with her would be sure to excite talk among the neighbours.  The last orders are so strict about the punishment of anyone giving  shelter to enemies of the republic, that people who let rooms will  all be suspicious. The only plan will be to get them out of the city  at once. It will be difficult for them to make their way through  France on foot, for in every town and village there is the strictest  look-out kept for suspected persons. Still, that must be risked;  there is no other way.\"    \"Yes, we must see about that to-morrow, Henri; but I do not think  the marquise could support a journey, for they would have to sleep  in the fields. Moreover, she will probably elect to stay near her  children until all can go together. Therefore I think that it will  be best for her to come either to you or me. We can take an additional  room, saying that our mother is coming up from the country to keep  house for us.\"    \"Yes, that would be much the best plan, Victor. And now here we  are close home. I hope by the time we meet in the morning one of  us may have hit upon some plan or other for getting hold of this  scoundrel.\"    \"I have hit upon an idea, Victor,\" Harry said when they met the  next morning.    \"I am glad to hear it, for though I have lain awake all night I  could think of nothing. Well, what is your idea?\"    \"Well, you see, Marat often goes out in the morning alone. He is  so well known and he is so much regarded by the lower class that  he has no fear of any assault being made upon him during the day.    \"My plan is that we should follow him till he gets into some street  with few people about. Then I would rush upon him, seize him, and  draw a knife to strike, shouting, 'Die, villain!' You should be  a few paces behind, and should run up and strike the knife out of  my hand, managing at the same moment to tumble over Marat and fall  with him to the ground. That would give me time to bolt. I would  have a beard on, and would have my other clothes under the blouse.  I would rush into the first doorway and run"]]]
