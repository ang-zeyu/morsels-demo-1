The scurvey opens old sores, and makes them bleed afresh, and an  unfeeling fellow does the same. Whatever else I may be, I am not that  man, thank fortune. Indeed, I am rather a dab at dressin' bodily ones,  and I won't turn my back in that line, with some simples I know of, on  any doctor that ever trod in shoe-leather, with all his compounds,  phials, and stipties.    In a gineral way, they know just as much about their business as a  donkey does of music, and yet both of them practise all day. They  don't make no improvements. They are like the birds of the air, and  the beasts of the forest. Swallows build their nests year after year  and generation after generation in the identical same fashion, and  moose winter after winter, and century after century, always follow in  each other's tracks. They consider it safer, it ain't so laborious,  and the crust of the snow don't hurt their shins. If a critter is such  a fool as to strike out a new path for himself, the rest of the herd  pass, and leave him to worry on, and he soon hears the dogs in  pursuit, and is run down and done for. Medical men act in the same  manner.    Brother Eldad, the doctor, used to say to me when riggin' him on the  subject:    \"Sam, you are the most conceited critter I ever knew. You have picked  up a few herbs and roots, that have some virtue in them, but not  strength enough for us to give a place to in the pharmacopia of  medicine.\"    \"Pharmacopia?\" sais I, \"why, what in natur is that? What the plague  does it mean? Is it bunkum?\"    \"You had better not talk on the subject,\" said he, \"if you don't know  the tarms.\"    \"You might as well tell me,\" sais I, \"that I had better not speak  English if I can't talk gibberish. But,\" sais I, \"without joking, now,  when you take the husk off that, and crack the nut, what do you call  the kernel?\"    \"Why,\" sais he, \"it's a dispensary; a book containin' rules for  compoundin' medicines.\"    \"Well then, it's a receipt-book, and nothin' else, arter all. Why the  plague can't you call it so at once, instead of usin' a word that  would break the jaw of a German?\"    \"Sam,\" he replied, \"the poet says with great truth,        \"'A little learning is a dangerous thing;    Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.'\"      \"Dear, dear,\" said I, \"there is another strange sail hove in sight, as  I am alive. What flag does 'Pierian' sail under?\"    \"The magpies,\" said he, with the air of a man that's a goin' to hit  you hard. \"It is a spring called Pierus after a gentleman of that  name, whose daughters, that were as conceited as you be, were changed  into magpies by the Muses, for challenging them out to sing. All  pratin' fellows like you, who go about runnin' down doctors, ought to  be sarved in the same way.\"    \"A critter will never be run down,\" said I, \"who will just take the  trouble to get out of the way, that's a fact. Why on airth couldn't  the poet have said Magpian Spring, then all the world would understand  him. No, the lines would have had more sense if they had run this way:        \"'A little physic is a dangerous thing;    Drink deep, or drink not of the doctor's spring.'\"      Well, it made him awful mad. Sais he, \"You talk of treating wounds as  all unskilful men do, who apply balsams and trash of that kind, that  half the time turns the wound into an ulcer; and then when it is too  late the doctor is sent for, and sometimes to get rid of the sore, he  has to amputate the limb. Now, what does your receipt book say?\"    \"It sais,\" sais I, \"that natur alone makes the cure, and all you got  to do, is to stand by and aid her in her efforts.\"    \"That's all very well,\" sais he, \"if nature would only tell you what  to do, but nature leaves you, like a Yankee quack as you are, to  guess.\"    \"Well,\" sais I, \"I am a Yankee, and I ain't above ownin' to it, and so  are you, but you seem ashamed of your broughtens up, and I must say I  don't think you are any great credit to them. Natur, though you don't  know it, because you are all for art, does tell you what to do, in a  voice so clear you can't help hearing it, and in language so plain you  can't help understandin' it. For it don't use chain-shot words like  'pharmacopia' and 'Pierian,' and so on, that is neither Greek nor  Latin, nor good English, nor vulgar tongue. And more than that, it  shows you what to do. And the woods, and the springs, and the soil is  full of its medicines and potions. Book doctrin' is like book farmin',  a beautiful thing in theory, but ruination in practice.\"    \"Well,\" said he, with a toss of his head, \"this is very good stump  oratory, and if you ever run agin a doctor at an election, I shouldn't  wonder if you won it, for most people will join you in pullin' down  your superiors.\"    That word superiors grigged me; thinks I, \"My boy, I'll just take that  expression, roll it up into a ball, and shy it back at you, in a way  that will make you sing out 'Pen and ink,' I know. Well,\" sais I,  quite mild (I am always mild when I am mad, a keen razor is always  smooth), \"have you any other thing to say about natur?\"    \"Yes,\" sais he, \"do you know what healin' by the first intention is,  for that is a nateral operation? Answer me that, will you?\"    \"You mean the second intention, don't you?\" sais I.    \"No,\" he replied, \"I mean what I say.\"    \"Well, Eldad,\" sais I, \"my brother, I will answer both. First about  the election, and then about the process of healin', and after that we  won't argue no more, for you get so hot always, I am afraid you will  hurt my feelins. First,\" sais I, \"I have no idea of runnin' agin a  doctor either at an election or elsewhere, so make yourself quite easy  on that score, for if I did, as he is my superior, I should be sure to  get the worst of it.\"    \"How,\" said he, \"Sam?\" lookin' quite pleased, seein' me kinder knock  under that way.    \"Why dod drot it,\" sais I, \"Eldad, if I was such a born fool as to run  agin a doctor, his clothes would fill mine so chock full of asafoetida  and brimstone, I'd smell strong enough to pysen a poll-cat. Phew! the  very idea makes me sick; don't come any nearer, or I shall faint. Oh,  no, I shall give my superiors a wide berth, depend upon it. Then,\"  sais I, \"secondly, as to healin' by the first intention, I have heard  of it, but never saw it practised yet. A doctor's first intention is  to make money, and the second is to heal the wound. You have been kind  enough to treat me to a bit of poetry, now I won't be in your debt, so  I will just give you two lines in return. Arter you went to  Philadelphia to study, Minister used to make me learn poetry twice a  week. All his books had pencil marks in the margin agin all the tid  bits, and I had to learn more or less of these at a time according to  their length; among others I remember two verses that just suit you  and me.        \"'To tongue or pudding thou hast no pretence,    Learning thy talent is, but mine is SENSE.'\"      \"Sam,\" said he, and he coloured up, and looked choked with rage,  \"Sam.\"    \"Dad,\" sais I, and it stopped him in a minute. It was the last  syllable of his name, and when we was boys, I always called him Dad,  and as he was older than me, I sometimes called him Daddy on that  account. It touched him, I see it did. Sais I, \"Dad, give me your  daddle, fun is fun, and we may carry our fun too far,\" and we shook  hands. \"Daddy,\" sais I, \"since I became an author, and honorary  corresponding member of the Slangwhanger Society, your occupation and  mine ain't much unlike, is it?\"    \"How?\" said he.    \"Why, Dad,\" sais I, \"you cut up the dead, and I cut up the livin.\"    \"Well,\" sais he, \"I give less pain, at any rate, and besides, I do  more good, for I make the patient leave a legacy to posterity, by  furnishing instruction in his own body.\"    \"You don't need to wait for dissection for the bequest,\" said I, \"for  many a fellow after amputation has said to you, 'a-leg-I-see.' But why  is sawing off a leg an unprofitable thing? Do you give it up? Because  it's always bootless.\"    \"Well,\" said he, \"why is an author the laziest man in the world? Do  you give that up? Because he is most of his time in sheets.\"    \"Well, that is better than being two sheets in the wind,\" I replied.  \"But why is he the greatest coward in creation in hot weather? Because  he is afraid somebody will quilt him.\"    \"Oh, oh,\" said he, \"that is an awful bad one. Oh, oh, that is like  lead, it sinks to the bottom, boots, spurs, and all. Oh, come, that  will do, you may take my hat. What a droll fellow you be. You are the  old sixpence, and nothin' will ever change you. I never see a feller  have such spirits in my life; do you know what pain is?\"    \"Oh,\" sais I, \"Dad,\" and I put on a very sad look, \"Daddy,\" sais I,  \"my heart is most broke, though I don't say anythin' about it. There  is no one I can confide in, and I can't sleep at all. I was thinkin'  of consultin' you, for I know I can trust you, and I am sure your kind  and affectionate heart will feel for me, and that your sound,  excellent judgment will advise me what is best to be done under the  peculiar circumstances.\"    \"Sam,\" said he, \"my good fellow, you do me no more than justice,\" and  he took my hand very kindly, and sat down beside me. \"Sam, I am very  sorry for you. Confide in me; I will be as secret as the grave. Have  you consulted dear old Minister?\"    \"Oh, no,\" said I, \"Minister is a mere child.\"    \"True, true, my brother,\" said he, \"he is a good worthy man, but a  mere child, as you say. Is it an affair of the heart, Sam?\"    \"Oh, no,\" sais I, \"I wish it was, for I don't think I shall ever die  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6124"],[0,"Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (#20)"],[1,"father's; and then turning off, crossed the  country, and carried her onwards toward his Lincolnshire estate.    It is also to be observed, that the messenger of her letters to her  father, who so often pretended business that way, was an implement in  his master's hands, and employed by him for that purpose; and always  gave her letters first to him, and his master used to open and read  them, and then send them on; by which means, as he hints to her, (as she  observes in her letter XXX) he was no stranger to what she wrote. Thus  every way was the poor virgin beset: And the whole will shew the base  arts of designing men to gain their wicked ends; and how much it behoves  the fair sex to stand upon their guard against artful contrivances,  especially when riches and power conspire against innocence and a low  estate.    A few words more will be necessary to make the sequel better understood.  The intriguing gentleman thought fit, however, to keep back from her  father her three last letters; in which she mentions his concealing  himself to hear her partitioning out her clothes, his last effort to  induce her to stay a fortnight, his pretended proposal of the chaplain,  and her hopes of speedily seeing them, as also her verses; and to send  himself a letter to her father, which is as follows:    'GOODMAN ANDREWS,    'You will wonder to receive a letter from me. But I think I am obliged  to let you know, that I have discovered the strange correspondence  carried on between you and your daughter, so injurious to my honour and  reputation, and which, I think, you should not have encouraged, till you  knew there were sufficient grounds for those aspersions, which she so  plentifully casts upon me. Something possibly there might be in what she  has written from time to time; but, believe me, with all her pretended  simplicity and innocence, I never knew so much romantic invention as she  is mistress of. In short, the girl's head's turned by romances, and  such idle stuff, to which she has given herself up, ever since her  kind lady's death. And she assumes airs, as if she was a mirror of  perfection, and every body had a design upon her.    'Don't mistake me, however; I believe her very honest, and very  virtuous; but I have found out also, that she is carrying on a sort of  correspondence, or love affair, with a young clergyman, that I hope  in time to provide for; but who, at present, is destitute of any  subsistence but my favour: And what would be the consequence, can you  think, of two young folks, who have nothing in the world to trust to of  their own to come together with a family multiplying upon them before  they have bread to eat.    'For my part, I have too much kindness to them both, not to endeavour to  prevent it, if I can; and for this reason I have sent her out of his way  for a little while, till I can bring them both to better consideration;  and I would not, therefore, have you be surprised you don't see your  daughter so soon as you might possibly expect.    'Yet I do assure you, upon my honour, that she shall be safe and  inviolate; and I hope you don't doubt me, notwithstanding any airs she  may have given herself, upon my jocular pleasantry to her, and perhaps  a little innocent romping with her, so usual with young folks of the two  sexes, when they have been long acquainted, and grown up together; for  pride is not my talent.    'As she is a mighty letter-writer, I hope she has had the duty to  apprise you of her intrigue with the young clergyman; and I know not  whether it meets with your countenance: But now she is absent for a  little while, (for I know he would have followed her to your village,  if she had gone home; and there, perhaps, they would have ruined  one another, by marrying,) I doubt not I shall bring him to see his  interest, and that he engages not before he knows how to provide for a  wife: And when that can be done, let them come together in God's name,  for me.    'I expect not to be answered on this head, but by your good opinion, and  the confidence you may repose in my honour: being                                       'Your hearty friend to serve you.'    'P. S. I find my man John has been the manager of the correspondence, in  which such liberties have been taken with me. I shall soon, in a manner  that becomes me, let the saucy fellow know how much I resent his part  of the affair. It is hard thing, that a man of my character in the world  should be used thus freely by his own servants.'    It is easy to guess at the poor old man's concern, upon reading this  letter from a gentleman of so much consideration. He knew not what  course to take, and had no manner of doubt of his poor daughter's  innocence, and that foul play was designed her. Yet he sometimes hoped  the best, and was ready to believe the surmised correspondence between  the clergyman and her, having not received the letters she wrote, which  would have cleared up that affair.    But, after all, he resolved, as well to quiet his own as her mother's  uneasiness, to undertake a journey to the 'squire's; and leaving his  poor wife to excuse him to the farmer who employed him, he set out that  very evening, late as it was; and travelling all night, found himself,  soon after day-light, at the gate of the gentleman, before the family  was up: and there he sat down to rest himself till he should see  somebody stirring.    The grooms were the first he saw, coming out to water their horses; and  he asked, in so distressful a manner, what was become of Pamela, that  they thought him crazy: and said, Why, what have you to do with Pamela,  old fellow? Get out of the horses' way.--Where is your master? said the  poor man: Pray, gentlemen, don't be angry: my heart's almost broken.--He  never gives any thing at the door, I assure you, says one of the grooms;  so you lose your labour. I am not a beggar yet, said the poor old man; I  want nothing of him, but my Pamela:--O my child! my child!    I'll be hanged, says one of them, if this is not Mrs. Pamela's  father.--Indeed, indeed, said he, wringing his hands, I am; and weeping,  Where is my child? Where is my Pamela?--Why, father, said one of them,  we beg your pardon; but she is gone home to you: How long have you been  come from home?--O! but last night, said he; I have travelled all night:  Is the 'squire at home, or is he not?--Yes, but he is not stirring  though, said the groom, as yet. Thank God for that! said he; thank God  for that! Then I hope I may be permitted to speak to him anon. They  asked him to go in, and he stepped into the stable, and sat down on the  stairs there, wiping his eyes, and sighing so sadly, that it grieved the  servants to hear him.    The family was soon raised with a report of Pamela's father coming to  inquire after his daughter; and the maids would fain have had him go  into the kitchen. But Mrs. Jervis, having been told of his coming,  arose, and hastened down to her parlour, and took him in with her, and  there heard all his sad story, and read the letter. She wept bitterly,  but yet endeavoured, before him, to hide her concern; and said, Well,  Goodman Andrews, I cannot help weeping at your grief; but I hope there  is no occasion. Let nobody see this letter, whatever you do. I dare say  your daughter is safe.    Well, but, said he, I see you, madam, know nothing about her:--If all  was right, so good a gentlewoman as you are, would not have been a  stranger to this. To be sure you thought she was with me!    Said she, My master does not always inform his servants of his  proceedings; but you need not doubt his honour. You have his hand for  it: And you may see he can have no design upon her, because he is not  from hence, and does not talk of going hence. O that is all I have to  hope for! said he; that is all, indeed!--But, said he--and was going on,  when the report of his coming had reached the 'squire, who came down,  in his morning-gown and slippers, into the parlour, where he and Mrs.  Jervis were talking.    What's the matter, Goodman Andrews? said he, what's the matter? Oh my  child! said the good old man, give me my child! I beseech you.--Why, I  thought, says the 'squire, that I had satisfied you about her: Sure you  have not the letter I sent you, written with my own hand. Yes, yes, but  I have, sir, said he; and that brought me hither; and I have walked all  night. Poor man, returned he, with great seeming compassion, I am sorry  for it truly! Why, your daughter has made a strange racket in my family;  and if I thought it would have disturbed you so much, I would have e'en  let her go home; but what I did was to serve her, and you too. She is  very safe, I do assure you, Goodman Andrews; and you may take my honour  for it, I would not injure her for the world. Do you think I would, Mrs.  Jervis? No, I hope not, sir, said she.--Hope not! said the poor man; so  do I; but pray, sir, give me my child, that is all I desire; and I'll  take care no clergyman shall come near her.    Why, London is a great way off, said the 'squire, and I can't send for  her back presently. What, then, said he, have you sent my poor Pamela to  London? I would not have said it so, replied the 'squire; but I assure  you, upon my honour, she is quite safe and satisfied, and will quickly  inform you of it by letter. She is in a reputable family, no less than a  bishop's, and is to wait on his lady, till I get the matter over that I  mentioned to you.    O how shall I know this? replied he.--What, said the 'squire, pretending  anger, am I to be doubted?--Do you believe I can have any view upon your  daughter? And if I had, do you think I would take such methods as these  to effect it? Why, surely, man, thou forgettest whom thou talkest to.  O, sir, said he, I beg your pardon! but consider my dear child is in  the case; let me but know what bishop, and where; and I will travel to  London on foot, to see my daughter, and then be satisfied.
