The  huge dark mass upon the glaring surface of white sand stood out in bold  relief and exhibited to perfection the form and proportions of the  animal; but it was so unlike the Indian elephant of my long experience  that I imagined some accident must have caused a deformity of the back,  which was deeply hollowed, instead of being convex like the Asiatic  species. I whispered this to my hunters, who did not seem to understand  the remark; and they immediately dismounted, exclaiming that the loose  sand was too deep for their horses, and they preferred to be on foot.    It was difficult to approach this elephant, as there was no cover  whatever upon the large area of barren sand; the only method was to keep  close to the level of the water below the terraces, as the head of the  animal was partially turned away from us whilst drinking. I had a very  ponderous single rifle weighing 22 lbs., which carried a conical shell  of half a pound, with a charge of 16 drams of powder. The sand was so  deep that any active movement would have been impossible with the load  of so heavy a weapon; I therefore determined to take a shoulder shot  should I be able to arrive unperceived within 50 yards. Stooping as low  as possible, and occasionally lying down as the ever-swinging head moved  towards us, we at length arrived at the spot which I had determined upon  for the fatal shot. Just at that moment the elephant perceived us, but  before he had made up his mind, I fired behind the shoulder, and as the  smoke cleared, I distinctly saw the bullet-hole, with blood flowing from  the wound. I think the elephant would have charged, but without a  moment's hesitation my gallant Hamrans rushed towards him sword in hand  in the hope of slashing his hamstring before he could reach the forest.  This unexpected and determined onset decided the elephant to retreat,  which he accomplished at such a pace, owing to the large surface of his  feet upon the loose sand, that the active hunters were completely  distanced, although they exerted themselves to the utmost in their  attempts to overtake him.    The wound through the shoulder was fatal, and the elephant fell dead in  thick thorny jungle, to which it had hurried as a secure retreat. This  was a very large animal, but as I did not actually measure it, any guess  at the real height would be misleading. As before noted, the measurement  of the African elephant Jumbo, when sold by the Zoological Society of  London, was 11 feet in height of shoulder, and 6 tons 10 cwts. nett when  weighed before shipment at the docks. That animal might be accepted as a  fair specimen, although it would be by no means unusual to see wild  elephants which greatly exceed this size.    The peculiar shape of head renders a front shot almost impossible, and  the danger of hunting the African elephant is greatly enhanced by this  formation of the skull, which protects the brain and offers no defined  point for aim.    I have never succeeded in killing a male African elephant by the  forehead shot, although it is certainly fatal to the Asiatic variety if  placed rather low, in the exact centre of the boss or projection above  the trunk. Should an African elephant charge, there is no hope of  killing the animal by a direct shot, and the only chance of safety for  the hunter is the possession of good nerves and a powerful  double-barrelled rifle, No. 8 or No. 4, with 14 drams of powder and a  well-hardened bullet. The right-hand barrel will generally stop a  charging elephant if the bullet is well placed very low, almost in the  base of the trunk. Should this shot succeed in turning the animal, the  left-hand barrel would be ready for a shot in the exact centre of the  shoulder; after which, time must be allowed for the elephant to fall  from internal haemorrhage.    There is no more fatal policy in hunting dangerous game than a contempt  of the animal, exhibited by a selection of weapons of inferior calibre.  Gunmakers in London of no practical experience, but who can only trust  to the descriptions of those who have travelled in wild countries,  cannot possibly be trusted as advisers. Common sense should be the  guide, and surely it requires no extraordinary intelligence to  understand that a big animal requires a big bullet, and that a big  bullet requires a corresponding charge of powder, which necessitates a  heavy rifle. If the hunter is not a Hercules, he cannot wield his club;  but do not permit him to imagine that he can deliver the same knock-down  blow with a lighter weapon, simply because he cannot use the heavier.    We lost only last year one of the most daring and excellent men, who was  an excellent representative of the type which is embraced in the proud  word \"Englishman\"--Mr. Ingram--who was killed by a wild female  elephant in Somali-land, simply because he attacked the animal with a  '450 rifle. Although he was mounted, the horse would not face some  prickly aloes which surrounded it, and the elephant, badly but not  really seriously wounded, was maddened by the attack, and, charging  home, swept the unfortunate rider from his saddle and spitted him with  her tusks.    This year (1889) we have to lament the death of another fine specimen of  our countrymen, the Hon. Guy Dawnay, who has been killed by a wild  buffalo in East Africa. The exact particulars will never be ascertained,  but it appears that he was following through thick jungle a wounded  buffalo, which suddenly turned and was not stopped by the rifle.    I cannot conceive anything more dangerous than the attack of such  animals with an inferior weapon. Nothing is more common than the  accounts of partially experienced beginners, who declare that the '450  bore is big enough for anything, because they have happened to kill a  buffalo or rhinoceros by a shoulder shot with such an inferior rifle. If  the animal had been facing them, it would have produced no effect  whatever, except to intensify the charge by maddening the already  infuriated animal.    This is the real danger in the possession of what is called a \" handy  small-bore,\" when in wild countries abounding in dangerous game. You are  almost certain to select for your daily companion the lightest and  handiest rifle, in the same manner that you may use some favourite  walking-stick which you instinctively select from the stand that is  filled with a variety.    All hunters of dangerous animals should accustom themselves to the use  of large rifles, and never handle anything smaller than a '577, weighing  12 lbs., with a solid 650 grain hard bullet, and at the least 6 drams of  powder. I impress this upon all who challenge the dangers of the chase  in tropical climates. No person of average strength will feel the weight  of a 12 lb. rifle when accustomed to its use. Although this is too small  as a rule for heavy game, it is a powerful weapon when the bullet is  hardened by a tough mixture of antimony or quicksilver. A shoulder shot  from such a rifle will kill any animal less than an elephant, and the  front shot, or temple, or behind the ear, will kill any Asiatic  elephant.    I would not recommend so small a bore for heavy thick-skinned game, but  the '577 rifle is a good protector, and you need not fear any animal in  your rambles through the forest when thus armed, whereas the '450 and  even the '500 would be of little use against a charging buffalo.    At the same time it must be distinctly understood that so light a  projectile as 650 grains will not break the bone of an elephant's leg,  neither will it penetrate the skull of a rhinoceros unless just behind  the ear. This is sufficient to establish the inferiority of small-bores.    I have seen in a life's experience the extraordinary vagaries of rifle  bullets, and for close ranges of 20 yards there is nothing, in my  opinion, superior to the old spherical hardened bullet with a heavy  charge of powder. The friction is minimised, the velocity is accordingly  increased, and the hard round bullet neither deflects nor alters its  form, but it cuts through intervening branches and goes direct to its  aim, breaking bones and keeping a straight course through the animal.  This means death.    At the same time it must be remembered that a '577 rifle may be enabled  to perform wonders by adapting the material of the bullet to the purpose  specially desired. No soft-skinned animal should be shot with a hardened  bullet, and no hard-skinned animal should be shot with a soft bullet.    You naturally wish to kill your animal neatly--to double it up upon the  spot. This you will seldom or never accomplish with a very hard bullet  and a heavy charge of powder, as the high velocity will drive the hard  projectile so immediately through the animal that it receives no  striking energy, and is accordingly unaware of a fatal wound that it may  have received, simply because it has not sustained a shock upon the  impact of a bullet which has passed completely through its body.    To kill a thin-skinned animal neatly, such as a tiger, lion, large deer,  etc. etc., the bullet should be pure lead, unmixed with any other metal.  This will flatten to a certain degree immediately upon impact, and it  will continue to expand as it meets with resistance in passing through  the tough muscles of a large animal, until it assumes the shape of a  fully developed mushroom, which, after an immense amount of damage in  its transit, owing to its large diameter, will remain fixed beneath the  skin upon the side opposite to its place of entry. This bestows the  entire striking energy of the projectile, and the animal succumbs to the  tremendous shock, which it would not have felt had the bullet passed  through, carrying on its striking energy until stopped by some other  object beyond.    I must repeat that although gunmakers object to the use of pure lead for  rifle bullets, upon the plea that lead will form a coating upon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3668"],[0,"The Albert N'Yanza, Great Basin of the Nile, And Explorations of the Nile (#20)"],[1," improving them, determined the chief of  the Mission to purge his establishment from such imps, and they were  accordingly turned out. Poor little Saat, the one grain of gold amidst  the mire, shared the same fate.    It was about a week before our departure from Khartoum that Mrs. Baker  and I were at tea in the middle of the court-yard, when a miserable boy  about twelve years old came uninvited to her side, and knelt down in the  dust at her feet. There was something so irresistibly supplicating in  the attitude of the child, that the first impulse was to give him  something from the table. This was declined, and he merely begged to be  allowed to live with us, and to be our boy. He said that he had been  turned out of the Mission, merely because the Bari boys of the  establishment were thieves, and thus he suffered for their sins. I could  not believe it possible that the child had been actually turned out into  the streets, and believing that the fault must lay in the boy, I told  him I would inquire. In the meantime he was given in charge of the cook.    It happened that, on the following day, I was so much occupied that I  forgot to inquire at the Mission; and once more the cool hour of evening  arrived when, after the intense heat of the day, we sat at table in the  open court-yard; it was refreshed by being plentifully watered. Hardly  were we seated, when again the boy appeared, kneeling in the dust, with  his head lowered at my wife's feet, and imploring to be allowed to  follow us. It was in vain that I explained that we had a boy, and did  not require another; that the journey was long and difficult, and that  he might perhaps die. The boy feared nothing, and craved simply that he  might belong to us. He had no place of shelter, no food; had been stolen  from his parents, and was a helpless outcast.    The next morning, accompanied by Mrs. Baker, I went to the Mission and  heard that the boy had borne an excellent character, and that it must  have been BY MISTAKE that he had been turned out with the others. This  being conclusive, Saat was immediately adopted. Mrs. Baker was shortly  at work making him some useful clothes, and in an incredibly short time  a great change was effected. As he came from the hands of the  cook--after a liberal use of soap and water, and attired in trowsers,  blouse, and belt--the new boy appeared in a new character.    From that time he considered himself as belonging absolutely to his  mistress. He was taught by her to sew; Richarn instructed him in the  mysteries of waiting at table, and washing plates, &c.; while I taught  him to shoot, and gave him a light double-barrelled gun. This was his  greatest pride.    In the evening, when the day's work was done, Saat was allowed to sit  near his mistress; and he was at times amused and instructed by stories  of Europe and Europeans, and anecdotes from the Bible adapted to his  understanding, combined with the first principles of Christianity. He  was very ignorant, notwithstanding his advantages in the Mission, but he  possessed the first grand rudiments of all religion--honesty of purpose.  Although a child of only twelve years old, he was so perfectly  trustworthy that, at the period of our arrival at Gondokoro, he was more  to be depended upon than my vakeel, and nothing could occur among my  mutinous escort without the boy's knowledge: thus he reported the  intended mutiny of the people when there was no other means of  discovering it, and without Saat I should have had no information of  their plots.    Not only was the boy trustworthy, but he had an extraordinary amount of  moral in addition to physical courage. If any complaint were made, and  Saat was called as a witness--far from the shyness too often evinced  when the accuser is brought face to face with the accused--such was  Saat's proudest moment; and, no matter who the man might be, the boy  would challenge him, regardless of all consequences. We were very fond  of this boy; he was thoroughly good; and in that land of iniquity,  thousands of miles away from all except what was evil, there was a  comfort in having some one innocent and faithful, in whom to trust.    We were to start upon the following Monday. Mahommed had paid me a  visit, assuring me of his devotion, and begging me to have my baggage in  marching order, as he would send me fifty porters on the Monday, and we  would move off in company. At the very moment that he thus professed, he  was coolly deceiving me. He had arranged to start without me on the  Saturday, while he was proposing to march together on the Monday. This I  did not know at the time.    One morning I had returned to the tent after having, as usual, inspected  the transport animals, when I observed Mrs. Baker looking  extraordinarily pale, and immediately upon my arrival she gave orders  for the presence of the vakeel (headman). There was something in her  manner, so different to her usual calm, that I was utterly bewildered  when I heard her question the vakeel, \"Whether the men were willing to  march?\" Perfectly ready, was the reply. \"Then order them to strike the  tent, and load the animals; we start this moment.\" The man appeared  confused, but not more so than I. Something was evidently on foot, but  what I could not conjecture. The vakeel wavered, and to my astonishment  I heard the accusation made against him, that, \"during the night, the  whole of the escort had mutinously conspired to desert me, with my arms  and ammunition that were in their hands, and to fire simultaneously at  me should I attempt to disarm them.\" At first this charge was  indignantly denied until the boy Saat manfully stepped forward, and  declared that the conspiracy was entered into by the whole of the  escort, and that both he and Richarn, knowing that mutiny was intended,  had listened purposely to the conversation during the night; at daybreak  the boy reported the fact to his mistress. Mutiny, robbery, and murder  were thus deliberately determined.    I immediately ordered an angarep (travelling bedstead) to be placed  outside the tent under a large tree; upon this I laid five  double-barrelled guns loaded with buck shot, a revolver, and a naked  sabre as sharp as a razor. A sixth rifle I kept in my hands while I sat  upon the angarep, with Richarn and Saat both with double-barrelled guns  behind me. Formerly I had supplied each of my men with a piece of  mackintosh waterproof to be tied over the locks of their guns during the  march. I now ordered the drum to be beat, and all the men to form in  line in marching order, with their locks TIED UP IN THE WATERPROOF. I  requested Mrs. Baker to stand behind me, and to point out any man who  should attempt to uncover his locks, when I should give the order to lay  down their arms. The act of uncovering the locks would prove his  intention, in which event I intended to shoot him immediately, and take  my chance with the rest of the conspirators. I had quite determined that  these scoundrels should not rob me of my own arms and ammunition, if I  could prevent it.    The drum beat, and the vakeel himself went into the men's quarters, and  endeavoured to prevail upon them to answer the call. At length fifteen  assembled in line; the others were nowhere to be found. The locks of the  arms were secured by mackintosh as ordered; it was thus impossible for  any man to fire at me until he should have released his locks.    Upon assembling in line I ordered them immediately to lay down their  arms. This, with insolent looks of defiance, they refused to do. \"Down  with your guns this moment,\" I shouted, \"sons of dogs!\" And at the sharp  click of the locks, as I quickly cocked the rifle that I held in my  hands, the cowardly mutineers widened their line and wavered. Some  retreated a few paces to the rear; others sat down, and laid their guns  on the ground; while the remainder slowly dispersed, and sat in twos, or  singly, under the various trees about eighty paces distant. Taking  advantage of their indecision, I immediately rose and. ordered my vakeel  and Richarn to disarm them as they were thus scattered. Foreseeing that  the time had arrived for actual physical force, the cowards capitulated,  agreeing to give up their arms and ammunition if I would give them their  written discharge. I disarmed them immediately, and the vakeel having  written a discharge for the fifteen men present, I wrote upon each paper  the word \"mutineer\" above my signature. None of them being able to read,  and this being written in English, they unconsciously carried the  evidence of their own guilt, which I resolved to punish should I ever  find them on my return to Khartoum.    Thus disarmed, they immediately joined other of the traders' parties.  These fifteen men were the \"Jalyns\" of my party, the remainder being  Dongolowas: both Arabs of the Nile, north of Khartoum. The Dongolowas  had not appeared when summoned by the drum, and my vakeel being of their  nation, I impressed upon him his responsibility for the mutiny, and that  he would end his days in prison at Khartoum should my expedition fail.    The boy Saat and Richarn now assured me that the men had intended to  fire at me, but that they were frightened at seeing us thus prepared,  but that I must not expect one man of the Dongolowas to be any more  faithful than the Jalyns. I ordered the vakeel to hunt up the men, and  to bring me their guns, threatening that if they refused I would shoot  any man that I found with one of my guns in his hands.    There was no time for mild measures. I had only Saat (a mere child), and  Richarn, upon whom I could depend; and I resolved with them alone to  accompany Mahommed's people to the interior, and to trust to good  fortune for a chance of proceeding.    I was feverish and ill with worry and anxiety, and I was lying down upon  my mat, when I suddenly heard guns firing in all directions, drums  beating, and the customary signs of "]]]
