In the meanwhile, in answer to his uncle's repeated interrogations, he  gave him an exact account of the accident which had that morning  brought him into so much danger. Although he himself saw nothing in his  narrative save what was affecting, he found it was received with much  laughter by his escort.    \"And yet it is no good jest either,\" said his uncle, \"for what, in the  devil's name, could lead the senseless boy to meddle with the body of a  cursed misbelieving Jewish Moorish pagan?\"    \"Had he quarrelled with the Marshals men about a pretty wench,  as Michael of Moffat did, there had been more sense in it,\" said  Cunningham.    \"But I think it touches our honour that Tristan and his people pretend  to confound our Scottish bonnets with these pilfering vagabonds--torques  and turbands, as they call them,\" said Lindesay. \"If they have not eyes  to see the difference they must be taught by rule of hand. But it 's my  belief, Tristan but pretends to mistake, that he may snap up the kindly  Scots that come over to see their kinsfolks.\"    \"May I ask, kinsman,\" said Quentin, \"what sort of people these are of  whom you speak?\"    \"In troth you may ask,\" said his uncle, \"but I know not, fair nephew,  who is able to answer you. Not I, I am sure, although I know, it may be,  as much as other people; but they appeared in this land within a year or  two, just as a flight of locusts might do.\"    \"Ay,\" said Lindesay, \"and Jacques Bonhomme (that is our name for the  peasant, young man--you will learn our way of talk in time)--honest  Jacques, I say, cares little what wind either brings them or the  locusts, so he but knows any gale that would carry them away again.\"    \"Do they do so much evil?\" asked the young man.    \"Evil? why, boy, they are heathens, or Jews, or Mahommedans at the  least, and neither worship Our Lady, nor the Saints\" (crossing himself)  \"and steal what they can lay hands on, and sing, and tell fortunes,\"  added Cunningham.    \"And they say there are some goodly wenches amongst these,\" said  Guthrie; \"but Cunningham knows that best.\"    \"How, brother!\" said Cunningham. \"I trust ye mean me no reproach?\"    \"I am sure I said ye none,\" answered Guthrie.    \"I will be judged by the company,\" said Cunningham. \"Ye said as much as  that I, a Scottish gentleman, and living within pale of holy church, had  a fair friend among these off scourings of Heathenesse.\"    \"Nay, nay,\" said Balafre, \"he did but jest. We will have no quarrels  among comrades.\"    \"We must have no such jesting then,\" said Cunningham, murmuring, as if  he had been speaking to his own beard.    \"Be there such vagabonds in other lands than France?\" said Lindesay.    \"Ay, in good sooth, are there--tribes of them have appeared in Germany,  and in Spain, and in England,\" answered Balafre. \"By the blessing of  good Saint Andrew, Scotland is free of them yet.\"    \"Scotland,\" said Cunningham, \"is too cold, a country for locusts, and  too poor a country for thieves.\"    \"Or perhaps John Highlander will suffer no thieves to thrive there but  his own,\" said Guthrie.    \"I let you all know,\" said Balafre, \"that I come from the Braes of  Angus, and have gentle Highland kin in Glen Isla and I will not have the  Highlanders slandered.\"    \"You will not deny that they are cattle lifters?\" said Guthrie.    \"To drive a spreagh [to plunder] or so, is no thievery,\" said Balafre,  \"and that I will maintain when and how you dare.\"    \"For shame, comrade!\" said Cunningham, \"who quarrels now? The young  man should not see such mad misconstruction--Come, here we are at the  Chateau. I will bestow a runlet of wine to have a rouse in friendship,  and drink to Scotland, Highland and Lowland both, if you will meet me at  dinner at my quarters.\"    \"Agreed--agreed,\" said Balafre; \"and I will bestow another to wash away  unkindness, and to drink a health to my nephew on his first entrance to  our corps.\"    At their approach, the wicket was opened, and the drawbridge fell. One  by one they entered; but when Quentin appeared, the sentinels crossed  their pikes, and commanded him to stand, while bows were bent, and  harquebusses aimed at him from the walls, a rigour of vigilance used,  notwithstanding that the young stranger came in company of a party of  the garrison, nay, of the very body which furnished the sentinels who  were then upon duty.    Le Balafre, who had remained by his nephew's side on purpose, gave the  necessary explanations, and, after some considerable hesitation  and delay, the youth was conveyed under a strong guard to the Lord  Crawford's apartment.    This Scottish nobleman was one of the last relics of the gallant band of  Scottish lords and knights who had so long and so truly served Charles  VI in those bloody wars which decided the independence of the French  crown, and the expulsion of the English. He had fought, when a boy,  abreast with Douglas and with Buchan, had ridden beneath the banner of  the Maid of Arc, and was perhaps one of the last of those associates of  Scottish chivalry who had so willingly drawn their swords for the fleur  de lys, against their \"auld enemies of England.\" Changes which had taken  place in the Scottish kingdom, and perhaps his having become habituated  to French climate and manners, had induced the old Baron to resign all  thoughts of returning to his native country, the rather that the high  office which he held in the household of Louis and his own frank and  loyal character had gained a considerable ascendancy over the King, who,  though in general no ready believer in human virtue or honour, trusted  and confided in those of the Lord Crawford, and allowed him the greater  influence, because he was never known to interfere excepting in matters  which concerned his charge.    [Douglas: fourth earl of Douglas. He was created Duke of Touraine in  1423 by Charles VII of France.]    [Buchan: Regent of Scotland and grandson of Robert II. He entered the  service of Charles VII in 1420, and was appointed Constable of France.]    [Maid of Arc (1412-1431): Joan of Arc. She believed that God had called  her to liberate France from the curse of the English who were besieging  Orleans. In person she led the French troops from victory to victory  until she saw the Dauphin crowned as Charles VII at Rheims. She was  then betrayed by her people into the hands of the English, who, in 1431,  sentenced her to the flames.]    Balafre and Cunningham followed Durward and the guard to the apartment  of their officer, by whose dignified appearance, as well as with the  respect paid to him by these proud soldiers, who seemed to respect no  one else, the young man was much and strongly impressed.    Lord Crawford was tall, and through advanced age had become gaunt and  thin; yet retaining in his sinews the strength, at least, if not the  elasticity, of youth, he was able to endure the weight of his armour  during a march as well as the youngest man who rode in his band. He was  hard favoured, with a scarred and weather-beaten countenance, and an eye  that had looked upon death as his playfellow in thirty pitched battles,  but which nevertheless expressed a calm contempt of danger, rather than  the ferocious courage of a mercenary soldier. His tall, erect figure was  at present wrapped in a loose chamber gown, secured around him by his  buff belt, in which was suspended his richly hilted poniard. He had  round his neck the collar and badge of the order of Saint Michael [a  patron saint of France. In 1469, a military order was instituted in his  honour by Louis XI]. He sat upon a couch covered with deer's hide, and  with spectacles on his nose (then a recent invention) was labouring  to read a huge manuscript called the Rosier de la Guerre, a code of  military and civil policy which Louis had compiled for the benefit of  his son the Dauphin, and upon which he was desirous to have the opinion  of the experienced Scottish warrior.    Lord Crawford laid his book somewhat peevishly aside upon the entrance  of these unexpected visitors, and demanded, in his broad national  dialect, what, in the foul fiend's name, they lacked now.    Le Balafre, with more respect than perhaps he would have shown to Louis  himself, stated at full length the circumstances in which his nephew was  placed, and humbly requested his Lordship's protection. Lord Crawford  listened very attentively. He could not but smile at the simplicity with  which the youth had interfered in behalf of the hanged criminal, but he  shook his head at the account which he received of the ruffle betwixt  the Scottish Archers and the Provost Marshal's guard.    [Such disputes between the Scots Guards and the other constituted  authorities of the ordinary military corps often occurred. In 1474, two  Scotsmen had been concerned in robbing... a fishmonger of a large sum  of money. They were accordingly apprehended by Philip du Four, Provost,  with some of his followers. But ere they could lodge one of them,... in  the prison of the Chastellet, they were attacked by two Archers of the  King's Scottish Guard, who rescued the prisoner.... S.]    \"How often,\" he said, \"will you bring me such ill winded pirns to ravel  out? How often must I tell you, and especially both you, Ludovic Lesly,  and you, Archie Cunningham, that the foreign soldier should bear himself  modestly and decorously towards the people of the country if you would  not have the whole dogs of the town at your heels? However, if you must  have a bargain [a quarrel, videlicet. S.], I would rather it were with  that loon of a Provost than any one else; and I blame you less for this  onslaught than for other frays that you have made, Ludovic, for it was  but natural and kind-like to help your young kinsman.

Thereupon Narayana called his  bewitching Maya (illusive power) to his aid, and assuming the form of an  enticing female, coquetted with the Danavas. The Danavas and the Daityas  charmed with her exquisite beauty and grace lost their reason and  unanimously placed the Amrita in the hands of that fair damsel.\"    So ends the eighteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.      SECTION XIX    (Astika Parva continued)    Sauti said, \"Then the Daityas and the Danavas equipped with first-class  armours and various weapons attacked the gods. In the meantime the valiant  Lord Vishnu in the form of an enchantress accompanied by Nara deceived the  mighty Danavas and took away the Amrita from their hands.    \"And all the gods at that time of great fright drank the Amrita with  delight, receiving it from Vishnu. And while the gods were partaking of it,  after which they had so much hankered, a Danava named Rahu was also  drinking it among them in the guise of a god. And when the Amrita had  reached Rahu's throat only, Surya and Soma (recognised him and) intimated  the fact to the gods. And Narayana instantly cut off with his discus the  well-adorned head of the Danava who was drinking the Amrita without  permission. And the huge head of the Danava, cut off by the discus and  resembling a mountain peak, then rose up to the sky and began to utter  dreadful cries. And the Danava's headless trunk, falling upon the ground  and rolling thereon, made the Earth tremble with her mountains, forests  and islands. And from that time there is a long-standing quarrel between  Rahu's head and Surya and Soma. And to this day it swalloweth Surya and  Soma (during solar and lunar eclipses).    \"Then Narayana quitting his enchanting female form and hurling many  terrible weapons at the Danavas, made them tremble. And thus on the shores  of the salt-water sea, commenced the dreadful battle of the gods and the  Asuras. And sharp-pointed javelins and lances and various weapons by  thousands began to be discharged on all sides. And mangled with the discus  and wounded with swords, darts and maces, the Asuras in large numbers  vomited blood and lay prostrate on the earth. Cut off from the trunks with  sharp double-edged swords, heads adorned with bright gold, fell  continually on the field of battle. Their bodies drenched in gore, the  great Asuras lay dead everywhere. It seemed as if red-dyed mountain peaks  lay scattered all around. And when the Sun rose in his splendour,  thousands of warriors struck one another with weapons. And cries of  distress were heard everywhere. The warriors fighting at a distance from  one another brought one another down by sharp iron missiles, and those  fighting at close quarters slew one another with blows of their fists. And  the air was filled with shrieks of distress. Everywhere were heard the  alarming sounds,--'cut', 'pierce', 'at them', 'hurl down', 'advance'.    \"And when the battle was raging fiercely, Nara and Narayana entered the  field. And Narayana seeing the celestial bow in the hand of Nara, called  to mind his own weapon, the Danava-destroying discus. And lo! the discus,  Sudarsana, destroyer of enemies, like to Agni in effulgence and dreadful  in battle, came from the sky as soon as thought of. And when it came,  Narayana of fierce energy, possessing arms like the trunk of an elephant,  hurled with great force that weapon of extraordinary lustre, effulgent as  blazing fire, dreadful and capable of destroying hostile towns. And that  discus blazing like the fire that consumeth all things at the end of Yuga,  hurled with force from the hands of Narayana, and falling constantly  everywhere, destroyed the Daityas and the Danavas by thousands. Sometimes  it blazed like fire and consumed them all; sometimes it struck them down  as it coursed through the sky; and sometimes, falling on the earth, it  drank their life-blood like a goblin.    \"On the other hand, the Danavas, white as the clouds from which the rain  hath dropped, possessing great strength and bold hearts, ascended the sky,  and by hurling down thousands of mountains, continually harassed the gods.  And those dreadful mountains, like masses of clouds, with their trees and  flat tops, falling from the sky, collided with one another and produced a  tremendous roar. And when thousands of warriors shouted without  intermission in the field of battle and mountains with the woods thereon  began to fall around, the earth with her forests trembled. Then the divine  Nara appeared at the scene of the dreadful conflict between the Asuras and  the Ganas (the followers of Rudra), and reducing to dust those rocks by  means of his gold-headed arrows, he covered the heavens with dust. Thus  discomfited by the gods, and seeing the furious discus scouring the fields  of heaven like a blazing flame, the mighty Danavas entered the bowels of  the earth, while others plunged into the sea of salt-waters.    \"And having gained the victory, the gods offered due respect to Mandara  and placed him again on his own base. And the nectar-bearing gods made the  heavens resound with their shouts, and went to their own abodes. And the  gods, on returning to the heavens, rejoiced greatly, and Indra and the  other deities made over to Narayana the vessel of Amrita for careful  keeping.\"    And so ends the nineteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.      SECTION XX    (Astika Parva continued)    Sauti said, \"Thus have I recited to you the whole story of how Amrita was  churned out of the Ocean, and the occasion on which the horse  Uchchaihsravas of great beauty and incomparable prowess was obtained. It  was this horse about which Kadru asked Vinata, saying, 'Tell me, amiable  sister, without taking much time, of what colour Uchchaishravas is.' And  Vinata answered, 'That prince of steeds is certainly white. What dost thou  think, sister? Say thou what is its colour. Let us lay a wager upon it.'  Kadru replied, then, 'O thou of sweet smiles, I think that horse is black  in its tail. Beauteous one, bet with me that she who loseth will become  the other's slave.'\"    Sauti continued, \"Thus wagering with each other about menial service as a  slave, the sisters went home, and resolved to satisfy themselves by  examining the horse next day. And Kadru, bent upon practising a deception,  ordered her thousand sons to transform themselves into black hair and  speedily cover the horse's tail in order that she might not become a slave.  But her sons, the snakes, refusing to do her bidding, she cursed them,  saying, 'During the snake-sacrifice of the wise king Janamejaya of the  Pandava race, Agni shall consume you all.' And the Grandsire (Brahman)  himself heard this exceedingly cruel curse pronounced by Kadru, impelled  by the fates. And seeing that the snakes had multiplied exceedingly, the  Grandsire, moved by kind consideration for his creatures, sanctioned with  all the gods this curse of Kadru. Indeed, as the snakes were of virulent  poison, great prowess and excess of strength, and ever bent on biting  other creatures, their mother's conduct towards them--those persecutors of  all creatures,--was very proper for the good of all creatures. Fate always  inflicts punishment of death on those who seek the death of other  creatures. The gods, having exchanged such sentiments with one another,  supported Kadru's action (and went away). And Brahman, calling Kasyapa to  him, spake unto him these words, 'O thou pure one who overcomest all  enemies, these snakes begotten by you, who are of virulent poison and huge  bodies, and ever intent on biting other creatures, have been cursed by  their mother. O son, do not grieve for it in the least. The destruction of  the snakes in the sacrifice hath, indeed, been ordained long ago.' Saying  this, the divine Creator of the Universe comforted Kasyapa and imparted to  that illustrious one the knowledge of neutralising poison.\"    And so ends the twentieth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.      SECTION XXI    (Astika Parva continued)    Sauti said, \"Then when the night had passed away and the sun had risen in  the morning, O thou whose wealth is asceticism, the two sisters Kadru and  Vinata, having laid a wager about slavery, went with haste and impatience  to view the steed Uchchaishravas from a near point. On their way they saw  the Ocean, that receptacle of waters, vast and deep, rolling and  tremendously roaring, full of fishes large enough to swallow the whale,  and abounding with huge makaras and creatures of various forms by  thousands, and rendered inaccessible by the presence of other terrible,  monster-shaped, dark, and fierce aquatic animals, abounding with tortoises  and crocodiles, the mine of all kinds of gems, the home of Varuna (the  water-God), the excellent and beautiful residence of the Nagas, the lord  of all rivers, the abode of the subterranean fire, the friend (or asylum)  of the Asuras, the terror of all creatures, the grand reservoir of water,  and ever immutable. It is holy, beneficial to the gods, and is the great  source of nectar; without limits, inconceivable, sacred, and highly  wonderful. It is dark, terrible with the sound of aquatic creatures,  tremendously roaring, and full of deep whirl-pools. It is an object of  terror to all creatures. Moved by the winds blowing from its shores and  heaving high, agitated and disturbed, it seems to dance everywhere with  uplifted hands represented by its surges. Full of swelling billows caused  by the waxing and waning of the moon the parent of Vasudeva's great conch  called Panchajanya, the great mine of gems, its waters were formerly  disturbed in consequence of the agitation caused within them by the Lord  Govinda of immeasurable prowess when he had assumed the form of a wild  boar for raising the (submerged) Earth.
