I shall, therefore, treat of the nature and  strength of the emotions according to the same method, as I  employed heretofore in my investigations concerning God and the  mind.  I shall consider human actions and desires in exactly the  same manner, as though I were concerned with lines, planes, and  solids.      DEFINITIONS    I.  By an adequate cause, I mean a cause through which its effect  can be clearly and distinctly perceived.  By an inadequate or  partial cause, I mean a cause through which, by itself, its  effect cannot be understood.    II.  I say that we act when anything takes place, either within  us or externally to us, whereof we are the adequate cause; that  is (by the foregoing definition) when through our nature  something takes place within us or externally to us, which can  through our nature alone be clearly and distinctly understood.  On the other hand, I say that we are passive as regards something  when that something takes place within us, or follows from our  nature externally, we being only the partial cause.    III.  By emotion I mean the modifications of the body, whereby  the active power of the said body is increased or diminished,  aided or constrained, and also the ideas of such modifications.    N.B.  If we can be the adequate cause of any of these  modifications, I then call the emotion an activity, otherwise I  call it a passion, or state wherein the mind is passive.      POSTULATES    I.  The human body can be affected in many ways, whereby its  power of activity is increased or diminished, and also in other  ways which do not render its power of activity either greater or  less.    N.B.  This postulate or axiom rests on Postulate i. and  Lemmas v. and vii., which see after II. xiii.    II.  The human body can undergo many changes, and, nevertheless,  retain the impressions or traces of objects (cf. II. Post. v.),  and, consequently, the same images of things (see note II.  xvii.).    PROP. I.  Our mind is in certain cases active, and in certain  cases passive.  In so far as it has adequate ideas it is  necessarily active, and in so far as it has inadequate ideas, it  is necessarily passive.    Proof.--In every human mind there are some adequate ideas, and  some ideas that are fragmentary and confused (II. xl. note).  Those ideas which are adequate in the mind are adequate also in  God, inasmuch as he constitutes the essence of the mind (II. xl.  Coroll.), and those which are inadequate in the mind are likewise  (by the same Coroll.) adequate in God, not inasmuch as he  contains in himself the essence of the given mind alone, but as  he, at the same time, contains the minds of other things.  Again,  from any given idea some effect must necessarily follow (I. 36);  of this effect God is the adequate cause (III. Def. i.), not  inasmuch as he is infinite, but inasmuch as he is conceived as  affected by the given idea (II. ix.).  But of that effect whereof  God is the cause, inasmuch as he is affected by an idea which is  adequate in a given mind, of that effect, I repeat, the mind in  question is the adequate cause (II. xi. Coroll.).  Therefore our  mind, in so far as it has adequate ideas (III. Def. ii.), is in  certain cases necessarily active; this was our first point.  Again, whatsoever necessarily follows from the idea which is  adequate in God, not by virtue of his possessing in himself the  mind of one man only, but by virtue of his containing, together  with the mind of that one man, the minds of other things also, of  such an effect (II. xi. Coroll.) the mind of the given man is not  an adequate, but only a partial cause; thus (III. Def. ii.) the  mind, inasmuch as it has inadequate ideas, is in certain cases  necessarily passive; this was our second point.  Therefore our  mind, &c.  Q.E.D.    Corollary.--Hence it follows that the mind is more or less  liable to be acted upon, in proportion as it possesses inadequate  ideas, and, contrariwise, is more or less active in proportion as  it possesses adequate ideas.    PROP. II.  Body cannot determine mind to think, neither can mind  determine body to motion or rest or any state different from  these, if such there be.    Proof.--All modes of thinking have for their cause God, by  virtue of his being a thinking thing, and not by virtue of his  being displayed under any other attribute (II. vi.).  That,  therefore, which determines the mind to thought is a mode of  thought, and not a mode of extension; that is (II. Def. i.), it  is not body.  This was our first point.  Again, the motion and  rest of a body must arise from another body, which has also been  determined to a state of motion or rest by a third body, and  absolutely everything which takes place in a body must spring  from God, in so far as he is regarded as affected by some mode of  extension, and not by some mode of thought (II. vi.); that is,  it cannot spring from the mind, which is a mode of thought.  This  was our second point.  Therefore body cannot determine mind, &c.  Q.E.D.    Note.--This is made more clear by what was said in the note to  II. vii., namely, that mind and body are one and the same thing,  conceived first under the attribute of thought, secondly, under  the attribute of extension.  Thus it follows that the order or  concatenation of things is identical, whether nature be conceived  under the one attribute or the other; consequently the order of  states of activity and passivity in our body is simultaneous in  nature with the order of states of activity and passivity in the  mind. The same conclusion is evident from the manner in which we  proved II. xii.    Nevertheless, though such is the case, and though there be no  further room for doubt, I can scarcely believe, until the fact is  proved by experience, that men can be induced to consider the  question calmly and fairly, so firmly are they convinced that it  is merely at the bidding of the mind, that the body is set in  motion or at rest, or performs a variety of actions depending  solely on the mind's will or the exercise of thought.  However,  no one has hitherto laid down the limits to the powers of the  body, that is, no one has as yet been taught by experience what  the body can accomplish solely by the laws of nature, in so far  as she is regarded as extension.  No one hitherto has gained such  an accurate knowledge of the bodily mechanism, that he can  explain all its functions; nor need I call attention to the fact  that many actions are observed in the lower animals, which far  transcend human sagacity, and that somnambulists do many things  in their sleep, which they would not venture to do when awake:  these instances are enough to show, that the body can by the sole  laws of its nature do many things which the mind wonders at.    Again, no one knows how or by what means the mind moves the  body, nor how many various degrees of motion it can impart to the  body, nor how quickly it can move it.  Thus, when men say that  this or that physical action has its origin in the mind, which  latter has dominion over the body, they are using words without  meaning, or are confessing in specious phraseology that they are  ignorant of the cause of the said action, and do not wonder at  it.    But, they will say, whether we know or do not know the means  whereby the mind acts on the body, we have, at any rate,  experience of the fact that unless the human mind is in a fit  state to think, the body remains inert.  Moreover, we have  experience, that the mind alone can determine whether we speak or  are silent, and a variety of similar states which, accordingly,  we say depend on the mind's decree.  But, as to the first point,  I ask such objectors, whether experience does not also teach,  that if the body be inactive the mind is simultaneously unfitted  for thinking?  For when the body is at rest in sleep, the mind  simultaneously is in a state of torpor also, and has no power of  thinking, such as it possesses when the body is awake.  Again, I  think everyone's experience will confirm the statement, that the  mind is not at all times equally fit for thinking on a given  subject, but according as the body is more or less fitted for  being stimulated by the image of this or that object, so also is  the mind more or less fitted for contemplating the said object.    But, it will be urged, it is impossible that solely from the  laws of nature considered as extended substance, we should be  able to deduce the causes of buildings, pictures, and things of  that kind, which are produced only by human art; nor would the  human body, unless it were determined and led by the mind, be  capable of building a single temple.  However, I have just  pointed out that the objectors cannot fix the limits of the  body's power, or say what can be concluded from a consideration  of its sole nature, whereas they have experience of many things  being accomplished solely by the laws of nature, which they would  never have believed possible except under the direction of mind:  such are the actions performed by somnambulists while asleep, and  wondered at by their performers when awake.  I would further call  attention to the mechanism of the human body, which far surpasses  in complexity all that has been put together by human art, not to  repeat what I have already shown, namely, that from nature, under  whatever attribute she be considered, infinite results follow.  As for the second objection, I submit that the world would be  much happier, if men were as fully able to keep silence as they  are to speak.  Experience abundantly shows that men can govern  anything more easily than their tongues, and restrain anything  more easily than their appetites; when it comes about that many  believe, that we are only free in respect to objects which we  moderately desire, because our desire for such can easily be  controlled by the thought of something else frequently  remembered, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38003"],[0,"Color Key to North American Birds (#20)"],[1,"griseus_) L. 10.5; B. 2.1, pitted at  tip. _Ads._ _Rump_, _tail_, under wing-coverts, and axillars _barred_  black and white; above black margined with rusty; rump, white; below  reddish brown, spotted and barred with black. _Yng._ Similar, but  breast gray tinged with rusty; belly white. _Winter._ Above gray,  breast gray mixed with dusky, belly white.
