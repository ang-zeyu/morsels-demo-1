In the morning, to his consternation, the craft  was found to be black. H2S had come in contact with the lead in  the white paint, forming black PbS. This gradually oxidized after  reaching the open sea, and the white color reappeared.    Chapter XXXIX.    PHOSPHORUS.    NOTE.--Phosphorus should be kept in water, and handled with  forceps, never with the fingers, except under water, as it is  liable to burn the flesh and produce ulcerating sores. Pieces not  larger than half a pea should be used, and every bit should  finally be burned.    197. Solution and Combustion. Experiment 112. -Put 1 or 2 pieces  of P into an evaporating- dish, and pour over them 5 or 10cc.CS2  carbon disulphide. This will be enough for a class. When  dissolved, dip pieces of unglazed paper into it, and hold these  in the air, looking for any combustion as they dry. The P is  finely divided in solution, which accounts for its more ready  combustion then. Notice that the paper is not destroyed. This is  an example of so-called \"spontaneous combustion.\" The burning-  point of P, the combustible, in air, the supporter, is about 60  degrees.    198. Combustion under Water.    Experiment 113. -Put a piece of P in a t.t. which rests in a  receiver, add a few crystals KClO3 and 5cc. H2O. Now pour in  through a thistle-tube 1cc.or more of H2SO4. Look for any flame.  H2SO4 acts very strongly on KClO3. What is set free? From this  fact explain the combustion in water.    199. Occurrence.--P is very widely disseminated, but not  abundant, and is found only in compounds, the chief of which is  calcium phosphate Ca3(PO4)2. It occurs in granite and other  rocks, as the mineral apatite, in soils, in plants, particularly  in seeds and grains, and in the bones, brains, etc., of  vertebrates. From the human system it is excreted by the kidneys  as microcosmic salt, HNaNH4PO4; and when the brain is hard-  worked, more than usual is excreted. Hence brain-workers have  been said to \"burn phosphorus.\"    200. Sources.--Rocks are the ultimate source of this element.  These, by the action of heat, rain, and frost, are disintegrated  and go to make soils. The rootlets of plants are sent through the  soil, and, among other things, soluble phosphates in the earth  are absorbed, circulated by the sap, and selected by the various  tissues. Animals feed on plants, and the phosphates are  circulated through the blood, and deposited in the osseous  tissue, or wherever needed.    Human bones contain nearly 60 per cent of Ca3(PO4)2; those of  some birds over 80 per cent.    The main sources of phosphates and P are the phosphate beds of  South Carolina, the apatite beds of Canada, and the bones of  animals.    201. Preparation of Phosphates and Phosphorus.--Bone ash,  obtained by burning or distilling bones, and grinding the  residue, is treated with H1SO4, and forms soluble H4Ca(PO4)2,  superphosphate of lime, and insoluble CaSO4.    Ca3(PO4)2 + 2 H2SO4 = H4Ca(PO04)2 + 2 CaSO4. This completes the  process for fertilizers. If P is desired, the above is filtered;  charcoal, a reducing agent, is added to the filtrate; the  substance is evaporated, then very strongly heated and distilled  in retorts, the necks of which dip under water. It is then  purified from any uncombined C by melting in hot water and  passing into molds in cold water.    The work is very dangerous and injurious, on account of the low  burning-point of P, and its poisonous properties. While its  compounds are necessary to human life, P itself destroys the  bones, particularly the jaw bones, of the workers in it.    Between 1,000 and 2,000 tons are made yearly, mostly for matches,  but almost all at two factories, one in England, and one in  France. 202. Properties.--P is a colorless, transparent solid,  when pure; the impure article is yellowish, translucent, and  waxy. It is insoluble in water, slightly soluble in alcohol and  ether, and it readily dissolves in CS2, oil of turpentine, etc.  Fumes, having a garlic odor, rise when it is exposed to the air,  and in the dark it is phosphorescent, emitting a greenish light.    203. Uses. -The uses of this element and its compounds are for  fertilizers, matches, vermin poisons, and chemical operations.    204. Matches.-The use of P for matches depends on its low  burning-point. Prepared wood is dipped into melted S, and the end  is then pressed against a stone slab having on it a paste of P,  KClO3, and glue. KNO3 is often used instead of KClO3. In either  case the object is to furnish O to burn P. Matches containing  KClO3 snap on being scratched, while those having KNO3 burn  quietly. The friction from scratching a match generates heat  enough to ignite the P, that enough to set the S on fire, and the  S enough to burn the wood. Give the reaction for each. Paraffine  is much used instead of S. Safety matches have no P, and must be  scratched on a surface of red P and Sb2S3, or on glass.    205. Red Phosphorus.-Two or three allotropic forms of P are  known, the principal one being red. If heated between 230 degrees  and 260 degrees, away from air, the yellow variety changes to  red, which can be kept at all temperatures below 260 degrees.  Above that it changes back. Red P is not poisonous, ignites only  at a high temperature, and is not phosphorescent, like the  yellow. 206. Spontaneous Combustion of Phosphene, or Hydrogen  Phosphide, PH3.    Experiment 114.--Put into a 20cc.flask 1 g. P and 50cc.saturated  solution NaOH or KOH. Connect with the p.t. by a long d.t., as in  Figure 44, the end of which must be kept under water. Pour 3 or  4cc.of ether into the flask, to drive out the air. It is  necessary to exclude all air, as a dangerously explosive mixture  is formed with it. Heat the mixture, and as the gas passes over  and into the air, it takes fire spontaneously, and rings of smoke  successively rise. It will do no harm if, on taking away the  lamp, the water is drawn back into the flask; but in that case  the flask should be slightly lifted to prevent breakage by the  sudden rush of water. On no account let the air be drawn over.    The experiment has no practical value, but is an interesting  illustration of the spontaneous combustion of PH3 and of vortex  rings. What are the products of the combustion? An admixture of  another compound of P and H causes the combustion.    Chapter XL.    ARSENIC.    Examine metallic arsenic, realgar, orpiment, arsenopyrite,  arsenic trioxide, copper arsenite.    The compounds of arsenic are very poisonous if taken into the  system, and must be handled with care.    207. Separation. Experiment 115.--Draw out into two parts in the  Bunsen flame a piece of glass tubing 20cm long and 1 or 2cm in  diameter. Into the end of one of the ignition tubes thus formed,  when it is cool, put one-fourth of a gram of arsenic trioxide,  As2O3, using paper to transfer it. Now put into the tube a piece  of charcoal, and press it down to within 2 or 3cm of the AS2O3  (Fig. 45). Next heat the coal red-hot, and then at once heat the  As203. Continue this process till you see a metallic sublimate-  metallic mirror-on the tube above the coal. Break the tube and  examine the sublimate. It is As. Heat vaporizes the As2O;3.  Explain the chemical action. What is the agency of C in the  experiment? Of As2O3?  2 As2O3 + 3 C = ?    208. Tests.-Experiments 115 and 116 are used as tests for the  presence of arsenic.    Experiment 116.--Prepare a H generator, - a flask with a thistle-  tube and a philosopher's lamp tube (Fig. 46), put in some  granulated Zn, water, and HCl. Test the purity of the escaping  gas (Experiment 23), and when pure, light the jet of H. H is now  burning in air. To be sure that there is no As in the ingredients  used, hold the inside of a porcelain evaporating-dish directly  against the flame for a minute. If no silvery-white mirror is  found, the chemicals are free from As. Then pour through the  thistle-tube, while the lamp is still burning, 1cc.solution of  AS2O3 in HCl or H2O a bit of As2O3 not larger than a grain of  wheat in 10 cc. HCl.    See whether the color of the flame changes; then hold the  evaporating-dish once more in the flame, and notice a metallic  deposit of As. Set away the apparatus under the hood and leave  the light burning.    This experiment must not be performed unless all the cautions are  observed, since the gas in the flask (AsH3) is the most poisonous  known, and a single bubble of it inhaled is said to have killed  the discoverer. By confining the gas inside the flask there is no  danger.    Instead of using As2O3 solution, a little Paris green, wall paper  suspected of containing arsenic, green silk, or green paper  labels, etc., may be soaked in HCl, and tested.    209. Explanation.--The chemical changes are as follows: The  compounds of As, in this case As2O3, in presence of nascent H,  are immediately converted into the deadly hydrogen arsenide  (arsine, arseniuretted hydrogen), AsH3. As2O3 + 12 H = 2 AsH3 + 3  H2O. The AsH3 mixed with excess of H tends to escape and is  burned to As2O3 and H2O, and thus is rendered comparatively  harmless as it passes into the air. This is why the flame must be  burning when the arsenic compound is introduced. 2 AsH3 + 6 O =  As2O3 + 3 H2O.    In the combustion of AsH3, H burns at a lower point than As. The  introduction of a cold body like porcelain cools the flame below  the kindling-point of As, and this is deposited, while H burns,  in exactly the same way as lamp- black was collected in  Experiment 26.    210. Expert Analysis.--A modification of this experiment is  employed by experts to test for AS2O3 poisoning. The organs.--  stomach or liver--are cut into small pieces dissolved by nascent  Cl, or HClO, made from KC1O3 and HCl, and the solution is  introduced into a H generator, as above. AS2O3 preserves the  tissues it comes in contact with, for a long time, and the test  can"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37090"],[0,"Our Knowledge of the External World as a Field for Scientific Method in (#20)"],[1,"A) how things would appear to a spectator in a place  where, as it happens, there is no spectator; (B) how things would appear  at times when, in fact, they are not appearing to anyone; (C) things  which never appear at all. All these are introduced to simplify the  statement of the causal laws, but none of them form an integral part of  what is _known_ to be true in physics. This brings us to our second  answer.    (b) If physics is to consist wholly of propositions known to be true, or  at least capable of being proved or disproved, the three kinds of  hypothetical entities we have just enumerated must all be capable of  being exhibited as logical functions of sense-data. In order to show how  this might possibly be done, let us recall the hypothetical Leibnizian  universe of Lecture III. In that universe, we had a number of  perspectives, two of which never had any entity in common, but often  contained entities which could be sufficiently correlated to be regarded  as belonging to the same thing. We will call one of these an \"actual\"  private world when there is an actual spectator to which it appears, and  \"ideal\" when it is merely constructed on principles of continuity. A  physical thing consists, at each instant, of the whole set of its  aspects at that instant, in all the different worlds; thus a momentary  state of a thing is a whole set of aspects. An \"ideal\" appearance will  be an aspect merely calculated, but not actually perceived by any  spectator. An \"ideal\" state of a thing will be a state at a moment when  all its appearances are ideal. An ideal thing will be one whose states  at all times are ideal. Ideal appearances, states, and things, since  they are calculated, must be functions of actual appearances, states,  and things; in fact, ultimately, they must be functions of actual  appearances. Thus it is unnecessary, for the enunciation of the laws of  physics, to assign any reality to ideal elements: it is enough to accept  them as logical constructions, provided we have means of knowing how to  determine when they become actual. This, in fact, we have with some  degree of approximation; the starry heaven, for instance, becomes actual  whenever we choose to look at it. It is open to us to believe that the  ideal elements exist, and there can be no reason for _dis_believing  this; but unless in virtue of some _a priori_ law we cannot _know_ it,  for empirical knowledge is confined to what we actually observe.    (2) The three main conceptions of physics are space, time, and matter.  Some of the problems raised by the conception of matter have been  indicated in the above discussion of \"things.\" But space and time also  raise difficult problems of much the same kind, namely, difficulties in  reducing the haphazard untidy world of immediate sensation to the smooth  orderly world of geometry and kinematics. Let us begin with the  consideration of space.    People who have never read any psychology seldom realise how much mental  labour has gone into the construction of the one all-embracing space  into which all sensible objects are supposed to fit. Kant, who was  unusually ignorant of psychology, described space as \"an infinite given  whole,\" whereas a moment's psychological reflection shows that a space  which is infinite is not given, while a space which can be called given  is not infinite. What the nature of \"given\" space really is, is a  difficult question, upon which psychologists are by no means agreed. But  some general remarks may be made, which will suffice to show the  problems, without taking sides on any psychological issue still in  debate.    The first thing to notice is that different senses have different  spaces. The space of sight is quite different from the space of touch:  it is only by experience in infancy that we learn to correlate them. In  later life, when we see an object within reach, we know how to touch it,  and more or less what it will feel like; if we touch an object with our  eyes shut, we know where we should have to look for it, and more or less  what it would look like. But this knowledge is derived from early  experience of the correlation of certain kinds of touch-sensations with  certain kinds of sight-sensations. The one space into which both kinds  of sensations fit is an intellectual construction, not a datum. And  besides touch and sight, there are other kinds of sensation which give  other, though less important spaces: these also have to be fitted into  the one space by means of experienced correlations. And as in the case  of things, so here: the one all-embracing space, though convenient as a  way of speaking, need not be supposed really to exist. All that  experience makes certain is the several spaces of the several senses,  correlated by empirically discovered laws. The one space may turn out to  be valid as a logical construction, compounded of the several spaces,  but there is no good reason to assume its independent metaphysical  reality.    Another respect in which the spaces of immediate experience differ from  the space of geometry and physics is in regard to _points_. The space of  geometry and physics consists of an infinite number of points, but no  one has ever seen or touched a point. If there are points in a sensible  space, they must be an inference. It is not easy to see any way in  which, as independent entities, they could be validly inferred from the  data; thus here again, we shall have, if possible, to find some logical  construction, some complex assemblage of immediately given objects,  which will have the geometrical properties required of points. It is  customary to think of points as simple and infinitely small, but  geometry in no way demands that we should think of them in this way. All  that is necessary for geometry is that they should have mutual relations  possessing certain enumerated abstract properties, and it may be that an  assemblage of data of sensation will serve this purpose. Exactly how  this is to be done, I do not yet know, but it seems fairly certain that  it can be done.    The following illustrative method, simplified so as to be easily  manipulated, has been invented by Dr Whitehead for the purpose of  showing how points might be manufactured from sense-data. We have first  of all to observe that there are no infinitesimal sense-data: any  surface we can see, for example, must be of some finite extent. But what  at first appears as one undivided whole is often found, under the  influence of attention, to split up into parts contained within the  whole. Thus one spatial object may be contained within another, and  entirely enclosed by the other. This relation of enclosure, by the help  of some very natural hypotheses, will enable us to define a \"point\" as a  certain class of spatial objects, namely all those (as it will turn out  in the end) which would naturally be said to contain the point. In order  to obtain a definition of a \"point\" in this way, we proceed as follows:    Given any set of volumes or surfaces, they will not in general converge  into one point. But if they get smaller and smaller, while of any two of  the set there is always one that encloses the other, then we begin to  have the kind of conditions which would enable us to treat them as  having a point for their limit. The hypotheses required for the relation  of enclosure are that (1) it must be transitive; (2) of two _different_  spatial objects, it is impossible for each to enclose the other, but a  single spatial object always encloses itself; (3) any set of spatial  objects such that there is at least one spatial object enclosed by them  all has a lower limit or minimum, _i.e._ an object enclosed by all of  them and enclosing all objects which are enclosed by all of them; (4) to  prevent trivial exceptions, we must add that there are to be instances  of enclosure, _i.e._ there are really to be objects of which one  encloses the other. When an enclosure-relation has these properties, we  will call it a \"point-producer.\" Given any relation of enclosure, we  will call a set of objects an \"enclosure-series\" if, of any two of them,  one is contained in the other. We require a condition which shall secure  that an enclosure-series converges to a point, and this is obtained as  follows: Let our enclosure-series be such that, given any other  enclosure-series of which there are members enclosed in any arbitrarily  chosen member of our first series, then there are members of our first  series enclosed in any arbitrarily chosen member of our second series.  In this case, our first enclosure-series may be called a \"punctual  enclosure-series.\" Then a \"point\" is all the objects which enclose  members of a given punctual enclosure-series. In order to ensure  infinite divisibility, we require one further property to be added to  those defining point-producers, namely that any object which encloses  itself also encloses an object other than itself. The \"points\" generated  by point-producers with this property will be found to be such as  geometry requires.    (3) The question of time, so long as we confine ourselves to one private  world, is rather less complicated than that of space, and we can see  pretty clearly how it might be dealt with by such methods as we have  been considering. Events of which we are conscious do not last merely  for a mathematical instant, but always for some finite time, however  short. Even if there be a physical world such as the mathematical theory  of motion supposes, impressions on our sense-organs produce sensations  which are not merely and strictly instantaneous, and therefore the  objects of sense of which we are immediately conscious are not strictly  instantaneous. Instants, therefore, are not among the data of  experience, and, if legitimate, must be either inferred or constructed.  It is difficult to see how they can be validly inferred; thus we are  left with the alternative that they must"]]]
