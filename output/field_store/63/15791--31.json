The American      Government and people are too deeply interested in the      prosperity of the Russian people for them to abandon Russia to      the Germans. America is sincerely interested in the liberty of      the Russian people and will do everything possible to safeguard      the real interests of the country.        If the brave and patriotic Russian people will forget political      differences for the time being and act resolutely and      vigorously, they will be able to drive the enemy from their      territory, and by the end of 1918 bring a lasting peace for      themselves and the whole world. America still counts itself an      ally of the Russian people, and we shall be ready to help any      Government which organizes a vigorous resistance to the German      invasion.    The French, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, Serbian, Belgian, Brazilian,  Greek, Portuguese, and Siamese representatives, who left Russia when the  treaty with Germany was signed, joined the American Ambassador (who did  not leave the country) at Vologda, 300 miles northeast of Moscow, late  in March. A dispatch dated March 20 says: \"There has been a marked  change in the attitude of the Allies toward the Soviet Government. * * *  There are many signs of renewed co-operation between Russia and the  Allies.\" The dispatch also quotes M. Chicherin, the Bolshevist Foreign  Minister, as saying that \"Russia's relations with the Entente are  unchanged.\"    At the same time Trotzky approached the American military mission,  established in Moscow, asking it to assist Russia in organizing a  volunteer army and in improving the country's transportation. On March  27 the Petit Parisien published a statement to the effect that Trotzky  had also asked the French to assist him in organizing military  resistance to the Germans. A leading article in Premier Clemenceau's  L'Homme Libre contained the following statement: \"The Entente, as long  as the war lasts, will regard Russia, the one and indivisible Russia  which signed the pact of London, as an ally.\"    Russia also reckons on the Allies, especially America, for support in  rehabilitating her industries and developing her resources. A large  order for agricultural machinery has been placed in the United States,  and the shipping of the goods has already begun. According to a London  dispatch the Bolsheviki are sending a commission to the United States to  settle Russia's accounts with American firms and make arrangements for  future trade relations.      THE JAPANESE LANDING    After Russia's collapse, and especially after her capitulation, Japan's  intervention in Siberia was a subject of lively discussion in the allied  countries. Persistent rumors were circulated by the press to the effect  that large masses of armed and organized Teuton prisoners, numbering at  least 150,000 men, were ready to seize the Trans-Siberian railroad and  menace the military stores accumulated in Vladivostok. These rumors were  declared by the Bolshevist authorities to be a part of the propaganda to  bring disrepute on the Soviet power and encourage Japanese  intervention, which Lenine's Government regards as an encroachment of  world imperialism upon Socialist Russia.    On Friday, April 5, two companies of Japanese sailors landed at  Vladivostok. According to the report of the President of the Vladivostok  Soviet, the landing was effected in the presence of the Japanese Consul  and Admiral Kato, Japanese Marine Minister, without the consent of the  other allied Consuls. Later in the day fifty British armed sailors were  landed. There was also an unconfirmed report that American marines, too,  were landed. On the next day 250 more Japanese sailors entered the city.  In a proclamation issued at Vladivostok Admiral Kato explained that the  step was taken because of the murder of a Japanese soldier and in order  to protect the life and property of Japanese and allied subjects. The  Vladivostok Soviet protested to the Consular Corps. Resolutions of  protest were also passed by the Municipal Council and the local Zemstvo.    The news of the landing produced much excitement in the Bolshevist  headquarters in Moscow. In spite of the statement of the allied  diplomats that the act was a purely local affair of no political  importance, the Bolsheviki construed it as the beginning of the rumored  Japanese invasion. A statement issued by the Commissaries on April 6  declared that the killing of the Japanese soldier was part of a  prearranged scheme, and that \"Japan had started a campaign against the  Soviet Republic.\" The following day the Izvestia spoke of the invasion  as the continuation of \"the crusade against revolutionary Russia\" begun  by imperialistic Germany. In a speech at Moscow on April 8 Premier  Lenine said: \"It is possible that after a short time, perhaps even  within a few days, we shall have to declare war on Japan.\" Two days  later it was reported that the Russian Government had requested Germany  to permit the postponement of the demobilization of the Russian Army in  view of the Japanese landing at Vladivostok.    On April 11 the Consular Corps of Vladivostok officially informed the  local Zemstvo that the landing of allied sailors had been made necessary  by conditions of anarchy in the port, and that the troops would be  withdrawn as soon as order had been restored.    On March 16 the American Ambassador, Mr. Francis, made the following  statement:        The Soviet Government and the Soviet press are giving too much      importance to the landing of these marines, which has no      political significance, but merely was a police precaution taken      by the Japanese Admiral on his own responsibility for the      protection of Japanese life and property in Vladivostok, and the      Japanese Admiral, Kato, so informed the American Admiral,      Knight, and the American Consul, Caldwell, in Vladivostok. My      impression is that the landing of the British marines was      pursuant to the request of the British Consul for the protection      of the British Consulate and British subjects in Vladivostok,      which he anticipated would possibly be jeopardized by the unrest      which might result from the Japanese landing.        The American Consul did not ask protection from the American      cruiser in Vladivostok Harbor, and consequently no American      marines were landed. This, together with the fact that the      French Consul at Vladivostok made no request for protection from      the British, American, or Japanese cruisers in the harbor,      unquestionably demonstrates that the landing of allied troops is      not a concerted action between the Allies.          The Czar's Loyalty to the Allies    An Autograph Letter    A letter written by Nicholas II. to President Poincare in the Spring of  1916 has recently been made public. Its interest lies in its expression  of absolute loyalty to the Allies. It is as follows:        DEAR AND EXALTED FRIEND: At a moment when France and Russia are      more closely bound than ever in the unprecedented struggle of      which they are supporting the weight with their faithful allies,      it has been a great pleasure to me to see the arrival of members      of the French Government in Russia. I have had much pleasure in      once again meeting M. Viviani, whom I already know, and in      recalling the last interview that I had with you. At the time      our one idea was to insure the peaceful development of our two      countries, while the enemy was already preparing his attack      against the peace of Europe in the hope of securing the hegemony      of the world. It also gives me great pleasure to meet M. Albert      Thomas, the Minister of Munitions, whose talents have rendered      such great services to his country and to the cause of the      Allies.        Having always attached great importance to an intimate      collaboration between the two Governments, I attach even greater      importance to this collaboration at the present time, now that      we are thoroughly determined only to disarm by common agreement      after gaining the final victory. It is therefore more necessary      to co-ordinate our effort in order that our common action may be      more effective. It is unquestionable that each of the Allies is      animated by a single desire--that of placing its fullest effort      at the disposal of the common cause.        It is with this desire that my Government and my officers have      devotedly studied, in association with members of the French      Government, the methods that should be taken to insure that the      greatest possible assistance should be given to our various      allies. I hope, consequently, that M. Viviani and M. Thomas will      leave here with the absolute conviction that so far as it is      materially possible Russia will hesitate before no sacrifice to      insure the triumph of the allied cause at the earliest possible      moment. My warmest wishes are that our united efforts may soon      be crowned with the most striking success, and I am anxious to      express to you my admiration of France, which has covered itself      with fresh glory in the heroic defense of Verdun.    [Illustration]          Pershing's Army Under General Foch    American Troops in France Brigaded With French and British Units for the  Great Battle in Picardy      General Pershing, in a cablegram to General March, Acting Chief of  Staff, announced on March 29, 1918, that the American expeditionary  force in France had been placed at the disposal of General Foch, the  allied Generalissimo.

But you think we Spaniards make much of little things. It is  true. We are best at what is least useful.\"    Light-hearted Andalusian though he was, he had full share of the  energy and enterprise of young manhood. Like the dons of long ago, he  was equipping himself for the great Western adventure. Despite his  Spanish wrath against America, she had for him a persistent  fascination. All his ambitions were bent on a business career in New  York, the El Dorado of his imagination. But it was no longer, at the  end of the nineteenth century, a case of leaping aboard a galleon and  waving a Toledo blade in air. The commercial career demands, so he  fancied, that its knight go forth armed cap-a-pie in the commercial  tongues. Thus he had spent four years of his youth and half of his  patrimony in London and Berlin, and now, after this hasty visit home,  purposed to go to Paris, for a year or two of French. This unsettled  life was little to his liking, but beyond gleamed the vision of a Wall  Street fortune.    Yet even now, at the outset of his task, a frequent lethargy would  steal over his young vigor. It was curious to see, when the March wind  blew chill or the French verbs waxed crabbed, how all his bearing lost  its beauty. There was a central dignity that did not lapse, but the  brightness and effectiveness were gone. His big body drooped and  looked lumpish. His comely face was clouded by an animal sluggishness  of expression. Foreign grimaces twisted across it, and something very  like a grunt issued from beneath his cherished first mustache. His  sarcasm became a little savage. He would sit for hours in a brooding  fit, and, when an inexorable call to action came, obey it with a look  of dreary patience older than his years. It was as if something  inherent in his nature, independent of his will, weighed upon him and  dragged him down. The Spain at which he gibed and from which he would  have cut himself away was yet a millstone about his neck. He was in  the heyday of his youth, progressive and determined, but the torpid  blood of an aged people clogged his veins. Spain will never lose her  hold on him, despite his strongest efforts. His children may be  citizens of the great Republic, but he must be a foreigner to the end.  He must wander a stranger in strange cities, puzzling his Spanish wits  over alien phrases and fashions and ideals, unless, indeed, his spirit  loses edge, and he drifts into chill apathy of disappointment on  finding that his golden castles in America are wrought of that same  old dream-stuff which used to be the monopoly of castles in Spain.    But it is best to leave ill-boding to the gypsies. Good luck may take  a liking to him, if only for the music of his laugh. For even if  blithe heart and courtly bearing bring no high cash value in the  modern business market, they may smooth the road to simple happiness.  Moreover, a Spaniard dearly loves a game of chance, and at the worst,  our fortune-seeker will have thrown his dice. His may seem to the  Yankee onlooker but a losing play, and yet--who knows? \"He who sings  frightens away his ills.\" God's blessing sails in summer clouds as  lightly as in costly pleasure yachts. Out of a shaft of sunshine, a  cup of chocolate, and a cigarette, this Andalusian immigrant, though  stranded in an East Side tenement, may get more luxury than can be  purchased by a multi-millionaire.      [Illustration: A ROMAN WELL IN RONDA]          IX    A BULL-FIGHT         \"I wish no living thing to suffer pain.\"--SHELLEY: _Prometheus         Unbound_.      From our first crossing of the Pyrenees we were impressed, even beyond  our expectation, with the Spanish passion for the bull-fight. The more  cultivated Spaniards, to be sure, are usually unwilling to admit to a  foreigner their pleasure in the pastime. \"It is brutal,\" said a young  physician of Madrid, as we discussed it. \"It is a very painful thing  to see, certainly. I go, myself, only two or three times a year, when  the proceeds are to be devoted to some religious object--a charity or  other holy work.\"    No sight is more common in streets and parks than that of a group of  boys playing _al toro_--one urchin charging about with sticks fastened  to his shoulders for horns, or with a pasteboard bull's head pulled  over his ears, and others waving scarlet cloths and brandishing  improvised swords and lances. It is said that in fierce Valencia  youths have sometimes carried on this sport with knives for horns and  swords, the spectators relishing the bloodshed too well to interfere.  Not easily do such lads as these forgive the little king for crying,  like the sensitive child he is, the first time he was taken to the  bull-ring.    The _corridas de toros_, although denounced by some of the chief  voices in Spain, are held almost a national shibboleth. Loyal  supporters of the queen regent will add to their praises the sigh, \"If  only she loved the bull-fight!\" Cavaliers and ladies fair reserve  their choicest attire to grace these barbarities. It is a common  saying that a Spaniard will sell his shirt to buy a ticket to the  bull-ring, but whatever the deficiencies of the inner costume, the  dress that meets the eye is brave in the extreme. It is recently  becoming the fashion for _caballeros_, especially in the north of  Spain, to discard those very fetching cloaks with the vivid  linings--cloaks in which Spaniards muffle their faces to the eyebrows  as they tread the echoing streets of cities founded some thousand or  fifteen hundred years ago. But for a good old Spanish bull-fight, the  good old Spanish costumes are out in force, the bright-hued _capas_  and broad _sombreros_, and for the ladies, who also are beginning to  discard the customary black mantilla for Parisian headgear, the  exquisite white mantillas of early times and the largest and most  richly decorated fans.    It is in such places as the grim Roman amphitheatre of Italica, whose  grass-grown arena has flowed so red with martyrdoms of men and beasts,  that one despairs most of Spanish ability to give up the bull-fight.  It is in the air, in the soil, in the blood; a national institution,  an hereditary rage. \"But it is the link that holds your country bound  to barbarism. The rest of the world is on the forward move. I tell  you, the continuance of the bull-fight means the ruin of Spain,\" urged  a gigantic young German, in our hearing, on his Spanish friend. The  slight figure of the Madrileno shook with anger. \"And I tell _you_\" he  choked, \"that Spain would rather perish with the bull-fight than  survive without it.\" _Isabel la Catolica_, who earnestly strove to  put down these savage contests, wrote at last to her Father Confessor  that the task was too hard for her. The \"Catholic Kings\" could take  Granada, unify Spain, establish the Inquisition, expel Moors and Jews,  and open the Americas; but they could not abolish bull-fighting. Nor  was Pius V, with his denial of Christian burial to all who fell in the  arena, and his excommunication for princes who permitted _corridas de  toros_ in their dominions, more successful. The papal bull, like the  bulls of flesh and blood, was inevitably overthrown.    Spanish legend likes to name the Cid as the first _torero_.         \"Troth it goodly was and pleasant         To behold him at their head,       All in mail on Bavieca,         And to hear the words he said.\"    In mediaeval times the sport was not without chivalric features.  Knights fought for honor, where professionals now fight for _pesetas_.  When the great Charles killed a bull with his own lance in honor of  the birth of Philip II, the favor of the Austrian dynasty was secured.  The Bourbons looked on the sport more coldly, but as royalty and  nobility withdrew, the people pressed to the fore. Out of the hardy  Spanish multitude rose a series of masters,--Romero the shoemaker,  who, in general, gave to the art its modern form; Martincho the  shepherd, who, seated in a chair with his feet bound, would await the  charging brute; Candido, who would face the bull in full career and  escape by leaping to its forehead and over its back; Costillares, who  invented an ingenious way of getting in the death-stroke; the famous  Pepe Hillo, who, like Candido, perished in the ring; a second Romero,  said to have killed five thousand six hundred bulls; Montes the  brick-layer, and a bloody band of followers. Andalusia is--alas!--the  classic soil of the bull-fight, as every peasant knows, and Seville  the top of Andalusia.         \"I have a handsome lover,           Too bold to fear the Devil,       And he's the best _torero_           In all the town of Seville.\"    The extravagance of the popular enthusiasm for these _fiestas de  toros_ is often ridiculed on the stage, where dramas dealing with  bull-fighting, especially if they bring in the heroes of the arena,  Pepe Hillo, Romero, Costillares, are sure to take. One _zarzuela_  represents a rheumatic old _aficionado_, or devotee of the sport,  trying, with ludicrous results, to screw his courage to the point of  facing the bull. Another spends its fun on a Madrid barber, who is  likewise a brain-turned patron of the ring. Disregarding the shrill  protests of his wife, he lavishes all his time, love, and money on the  _corridas_ and encourages his daughter's _novio_, an honest young  paper-hanger, to throw over his trade and learn to _torear_. After two  years of the provincial arenas, the aspirant, nicknamed in the ring  The Baby, has nothing but torn clothes and bruises to show for his  career, and his sweetheart, eager to recall him from the hazardous  profession, vows a waxen bull, large as life, to the Virgin, in case  he returns to papering, with its humble security and its regularity of  wages. Mary hears. On that great occasion, The Baby's debut at Madrid,  the barber, who has just been lucky in the lottery, rents for him a  gorgeous suit of second-hand finery, but"]]]
