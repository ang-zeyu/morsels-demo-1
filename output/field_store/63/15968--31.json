I shall provide Doctor Antonio  de Morga with whatever will be useful to him from this country. The two  chofas have received the lands which I promised them. To Captain Don  Blas, the Castilian, I gave the province of Tran, and to Captain Chofa  Don Diego, the Portuguese, the province of Bapano. These provinces I  grant and bestow upon them for the services which they have rendered  me and in payment for the property they have spent in my service,  so that they may possess and enjoy them as their own, and do what  they will with them while in my service. [96]    Together with the king's letter Blas Ruis de Hernan Gonzalez wrote  another detailed letter to Doctor Morga, informing him of all the  events of his expeditions. The letter reads as follows.    To Doctor Antonio de Morga, Lieutenant-governor of the Filipinas  Islands of Luzon, in the city of Manila, whom may our Lord preserve.    From Camboja: Your Grace must have already heard of events in this  kingdom of Camboja, from my arrival until the captain withdrew the  fleet. These accounts will undoubtedly vary according to what each man  thought fit to say in order to gild his own affairs: some according to  their bent and opinion, and others according to their passion. Although  the matter has been witnessed and thoroughly known by many persons, I  am about to relate it as well as possible to your Grace, as to a person  who can weld all the facts together and give to each circumstance  the weight which it may possess and deserve. I shall also give an  account among other things of all that happened to Captain Diego  Belloso and myself on the journey to Lao, and the vicissitudes and  wars in this kingdom, from our arrival until the condition of affairs  now in force. Since Spaniards have taken part in all these events it  will please your Grace to know the manner and retirement with which  I have lived in this kingdom ever since my arrival here from Manila,  sustaining the soldiers and other men whom I brought in my ship at  my own expense, keeping them in a state of discipline and honor,  and never allowing them to abandon themselves to sensual pleasures;  although I had no credentials for this, for Gallinato had those which  the governor was to give me. I shall not discuss the why and wherefore  of most of the Chinese matters, because Fray Alonso Ximenez and Fray  Diego [97] witnessed some of the events and heard of others and will  have informed your Grace of everything, including the war against the  usurper, and Gallinato's abandonment of this kingdom when affairs had  practically been settled. Had he continued to follow up matters, half  of the kingdom would today justly belong to his Majesty, and the whole  of it would be in the power and under the rule of the Spaniards; and  perhaps the king himself with most of his people would have embraced  Christianity. As to Chinese matters which require most explanation I  only ask your Grace to consider the kingdom which we came to help,  that the Chinese had no more right there than we had, and that we  had to try to gain reputation, not to lose it. Since we came with  a warlike attitude, and it was the first time that an armed Spanish  force set foot on the mainland, was it right for us to endure insults,  abuse, contempt, and open affronts from a so vile race as they are,  and before all these pagans? [Was it right to endure] the further  action of their arguments before the usurping king, to induce him to  kill us; their many evil and infamous reports to him concerning us,  in order to induce him to grant their request; and above all their  impudence in killing and disarming Spaniards and going out in the  streets to spear them? All this I endured very patiently in order  not to disturb the land by breaking with them, until one day when  they actually tried to kill some of our men in their Pari√°n, and the  numbers being very unequal, they had already wounded and maltreated  them. We came out at the noise and the Chinese drew up in battle  array, armed with many warlike instruments, challenging us to battle,  with insults and expressions of contempt. At this juncture, what would  have become of our reputation had we retired when the advantage was on  their side? Then, too, after attacking and killing many of them what  security had we in this tyrannical kingdom, which showed itself not  at all friendly to us, with only one ship, [98] which was at the time  aground, and with the artillery and provisions ashore; while they had  six ships and many rowboats all provided with one or two culverins  and many men, both in the ships and those living in the port? [99]  Would it have been right, after war had broken out, to have them  with all their resources while we had none? Had they taken our lives,  what reputation would the Spaniards have left in these kingdoms? For  this reason I thought it better for us to overpower them, rather  than to be at their mercy, or at that of the king. Accordingly, in  order to assure our lives we were obliged to seize their ships and  to strengthen ourselves by means of them, since the Chinese began  the war. After this, father Fray Alonso Ximenez and we thought that,  by making an embassy with presents to the king, and by exculpating  ourselves in this matter, before him, everything would turn out well;  and that if we had peace with him, and our persons in safety in a fort,  or under his word and safe-conduct, we would give the Chinese their  ship and property. All this was written out and signed by us. In order  to carry this out, a letter was written in the name of the governor of  that city [i.e., Manila], and we went to deliver it nine leguas away  at the residence of the king, leaving the vessels guarded. But when he  found us there, the king deprived us of the boats in which we had gone,  and refused to receive the letter, which went under form of embassy,  or to hear us unless we first restored the ships. Then he immediately  began to prepare arms and to assemble many men, with the intention,  unless we restored the ships, of killing us, or reducing us by force  to such straits as to compel us to restore them; and after their  restoration, of making an end of us all without trouble or risk to his  own men. For he trusted us in nothing, since we were going in search  of, and bringing help to, him whom he had dispossessed. All this was  told us by some Christians among them, especially by a young mestizo  from Malaca who lived among them and knew their language. Therefore  considering that we were already separated from our companions,  and that, if we restored the ships, they could easily take ours by  means of them and kill the men left in them, and then us who were in  that place; also that if we waited for them to collect and attack us,  they could very easily kill us: we decided to seek the remedy by first  attacking them instead of waiting to be attacked; and try to rejoin  our men and assure our lives or end them by fighting. Accordingly we  attacked them, and such was our good fortune that we killed the king  in the fight. Then we retired to our ships with great difficulty,  without the loss of a single Spaniard. We did not allow the king's  house to be sacked, so that it might not be said that we had done  this to rob him. At this juncture, the captain and sargento-mayor,  our leader, arrived. He belittled and censured what we had done, and  ridiculed our statement and that of some of the Cambodians, namely,  that we had killed the usurper. All that he did was simply to collect  whatever silver and gold certain soldiers seized during these troubles,  and everything valuable in the ships, and then to burn the latter. Then  he drew up a report against us and dispossessed us of our ships and  command, thus formulating suspicion and distrust. After that he gave  orders for the departure from the kingdom, paying no heed to many  Cambodians who came to speak to us when we went ashore, and told  us that we might build a fortress there, for they had a legitimate  king before, but that he who was their king lately had driven him  to Lao, and thus they had no king; that they would gather wherever  the most protection could be found; and that we should continue the  war. Nor did the captain accept any of our suggestions, when we told  him that the usurper had imprisoned a kinsman of the lawful king;  that we should go to his rescue; that the latter would raise men  in favor of the legitimate king; and that with his support we would  take possession of the kingdom, and then go to get the king. But he  was deaf to all this and accordingly abandoned the kingdom, and this  great opportunity was lost. The only thing that we could obtain from  him by great entreaty after putting to sea, was to go to Cochinchina  to inquire about the galley, since they had intended to send from  Manila for that purpose. I also offered to go to Lao by land at my  own expense, in search of the king of Camboja, for I knew that that  way led thither. Accordingly, as soon as we arrived in Cochinchina,  the captain sent Diego Belloso and myself to Lao, and Captain Gregorio  de Vargas to Tunquin. Meanwhile he held an auction among the soldiers  of everything valuable from the Chinese ships, and of what else he  had taken from the soldiers; but the men were all without a real,  and so he had everything bought for himself, at whatever price he was  pleased to give. The king of Sinoa, a province of Cochinchina, equipped  us for the voyage with a good outfit, by giving us an embassy for that  country, and men to accompany us on the road. Thus we made the entire  journey well provided and always highly honored and feared and much  looked at, as the like had never before been seen in those kingdoms.    We were all sick on the road; but in all our troubles we were greatly  comforted by the love which the people showed towards us, and: by the  kind"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7005"],[0,"The Antiquary ‚Äî Complete (#20)"],[1,"when pressed by an instant and common  danger. The beach under Halket-head, rapidly diminishing in extent by  the encroachments of a spring-tide and a north-west wind, was in like  manner a neutral field, where even a justice of peace and a strolling  mendicant might meet upon terms of mutual forbearance.    \"Turn back! turn back!\" exclaimed the vagrant; \"why did ye not turn when  I waved to you?\"    \"We thought,\" replied Sir Arthur, in great agitation, \"we thought we  could get round Halket-head.\"    \"Halket-head!--the tide will be running on Halket-head by this time like  the Fall of Fyers!--it was a' I could do to get round it twenty minutes  since--it was coming in three feet abreast. We will maybe get back by  Bally-burgh Ness Point yet. The Lord help us!--it's our only chance. We  can but try.\"    \"My God, my child!\"--\"My father! my dear father!\" exclaimed the parent  and daughter, as, fear lending them strength and speed, they turned to  retrace their steps, and endeavoured to double the point, the projection  of which formed the southern extremity of the bay.    \"I heard ye were here frae the bit callant ye sent to meet your  carriage,\" said the beggar, as he trudged stoutly on a step or two  behind Miss Wardour; \"and I couldna bide to think o' the dainty young  leddy's peril, that has aye been kind to ilka forlorn heart that cam  near her. Sae I lookit at the lift and the rin o' the tide, till I  settled it that if I could get down time eneugh to gie you warning, we  wad do weel yet. But I doubt, I doubt, I have been beguiled! for what  mortal ee ever saw sic a race as the tide is risening e'en now? See,  yonder's the Ratton's Skerry--he aye held his neb abune the water in my  day--but he's aneath it now.\"    Sir Arthur cast a look in the direction in which the old man pointed. A  huge rock, which in general, even in spring-tides, displayed a hulk like  the keel of a large vessel, was now quite under water, and its place  only indicated by the boiling and breaking of the eddying waves which  encountered its submarine resistance.    \"Mak haste, mak haste, my bonny leddy,\" continued the old man--\"mak  haste, and we may do yet! Take haud o' my arm--an auld and frail arm it's  now, but it's been in as sair stress as this is yet. Take haud o' my  arm, my winsome leddy! D'ye see yon wee black speck amang the wallowing  waves yonder? This morning it was as high as the mast o' a brig--it's  sma' eneugh now--but, while I see as muckle black about it as the crown  o' my hat, I winna believe but we'll get round the Ballyburgh Ness, for  a' that's come and gane yet.\"    Isabella, in silence, accepted from the old man the assistance which Sir  Arthur was less able to afford her. The waves had now encroached so much  upon the beach, that the firm and smooth footing which they had hitherto  had on the sand must be exchanged for a rougher path close to the foot  of the precipice, and in some places even raised upon its lower ledges.  It would have been utterly impossible for Sir Arthur Wardour, or his  daughter, to have found their way along these shelves without the  guidance and encouragement of the beggar, who had been there before in  high tides, though never, he acknowledged, \"in sae awsome a night as  this.\"    It was indeed a dreadful evening. The howling of the storm mingled with  the shrieks of the sea-fowl, and sounded like the dirge of the three  devoted beings, who, pent between two of the most magnificent, yet  most dreadful objects of nature--a raging tide and an insurmountable  precipice--toiled along their painful and dangerous path, often lashed by  the spray of some giant billow, which threw itself higher on the beach  than those that had preceded it. Each minute did their enemy gain ground  perceptibly upon them! Still, however, loth to relinquish the last  hopes of life, they bent their eyes on the black rock pointed out  by Ochiltree. It was yet distinctly visible among the breakers, and  continued to be so, until they came to a turn in their precarious  path, where an intervening projection of rock hid it from their sight.  Deprived of the view of the beacon on which they had relied, they now  experienced the double agony of terror and suspense. They struggled  forward, however; but, when they arrived at the point from which they  ought to have seen the crag, it was no longer visible: the signal of  safety was lost among a thousand white breakers, which, dashing upon  the point of the promontory, rose in prodigious sheets of snowy foam,  as high as the mast of a first-rate man-of-war, against the dark brow of  the precipice.    The countenance of the old man fell. Isabella gave a faint shriek,  and, \"God have mercy upon us!\" which her guide solemnly uttered, was  piteously echoed by Sir Arthur--\"My child! my child!--to die such a  death!\"    \"My father! my dear father!\" his daughter exclaimed, clinging to  him--\"and you too, who have lost your own life in endeavouring to save  ours!\"    \"That's not worth the counting,\" said the old man. \"I hae lived to be  weary o' life; and here or yonder--at the back o' a dyke, in a wreath o'  snaw, or in the wame o' a wave, what signifies how the auld gaberlunzie  dies?\"    \"Good man,\" said Sir Arthur, \"can you think of nothing?--of no help?--I'll  make you rich--I'll give you a farm--I'll\"--    \"Our riches will be soon equal,\" said the beggar, looking out upon the  strife of the waters--\"they are sae already; for I hae nae land, and you  would give your fair bounds and barony for a square yard of rock that  would be dry for twal hours.\"    While they exchanged these words, they paused upon the highest ledge of  rock to which they could attain; for it seemed that any further attempt  to move forward could only serve to anticipate their fate. Here, then,  they were to await the sure though slow progress of the raging element,  something in the situation of the martyrs of the early church, who,  exposed by heathen tyrants to be slain by wild beasts, were compelled  for a time to witness the impatience and rage by which the animals  were agitated, while awaiting the signal for undoing their grates, and  letting them loose upon the victims.    Yet even this fearful pause gave Isabella time to collect the powers of  a mind naturally strong and courageous, and which rallied itself at this  terrible juncture. \"Must we yield life,\" she said, \"without a struggle?  Is there no path, however dreadful, by which we could climb the crag, or  at least attain some height above the tide, where we could remain till  morning, or till help comes? They must be aware of our situation, and  will raise the country to relieve us.\"    Sir Arthur, who heard, but scarcely comprehended, his daughter's  question, turned, nevertheless, instinctively and eagerly to the old  man, as if their lives were in his gift. Ochiltree paused--\"I was a  bauld craigsman,\" he said, \"ance in my life, and mony a kittywake's and  lungie's nest hae I harried up amang thae very black rocks; but it's  lang, lang syne, and nae mortal could speel them without a rope--and if  I had ane, my ee-sight, and my footstep, and my hand-grip, hae a' failed  mony a day sinsyne--And then, how could I save you? But there was a path  here ance, though maybe, if we could see it, ye would rather bide where  we are--His name be praised!\" he ejaculated suddenly, \"there's ane coming  down the crag e'en now!\"--Then, exalting his voice, he hilloa'd out to  the daring adventurer such instructions as his former practice, and  the remembrance of local circumstances, suddenly forced upon his  mind:--\"Ye're right!--ye're right!--that gate--that gate!--fasten the rope  weel round Crummies-horn, that's the muckle black stane--cast twa plies  round it--that's it!--now, weize yoursell a wee easel-ward--a wee mair yet  to that ither stane--we ca'd it the Cat's-lug--there used to be the root  o' an aik tree there--that will do!--canny now, lad--canny now--tak tent and  tak time--Lord bless ye, tak time--Vera weel!--Now ye maun get to Bessy's  apron, that's the muckle braid flat blue stane--and then, I think, wi'  your help and the tow thegither, I'll win at ye, and then we'll be able  to get up the young leddy and Sir Arthur.\"    The adventurer, following the directions of old Edie, flung him down  the end of the rope, which he secured around Miss Wardour, wrapping her  previously in his own blue gown, to preserve her as much as possible  from injury. Then, availing himself of the rope, which was made fast at  the other end, he began to ascend the face of the crag--a most precarious  and dizzy undertaking, which, however, after one or two perilous  escapes, placed him safe on the broad flat stone beside our friend  Lovel. Their joint strength was able to raise Isabella to the place of  safety which they had attained. Lovel then descended in order to assist  Sir Arthur, around whom he adjusted the rope; and again mounting to  their place of refuge, with the assistance of old Ochiltree, and such  aid as Sir Arthur himself could afford, he raised himself beyond the  reach of the billows.    [Illustration: The Rescue of Sir Arthur and Miss Wardour]    The sense of reprieve from approaching and apparently inevitable death,  had its usual effect. The father and daughter threw themselves into  each other's arms, kissed and wept for joy, although their escape  was connected with the prospect of passing a tempestuous night upon a  precipitous ledge of rock, which scarce afforded footing for the four  shivering beings, who now, like the sea-fowl around them, clung there  in hopes of some shelter from the devouring element which raged beneath.  The spray of the billows, which attained in fearful succession the foot  of the precipice, overflowing the beach on which they so lately stood,  flew as high as their place of temporary refuge; and the stunning sound  with which they dashed against the rocks beneath, seemed as if they  still demanded"]]]
