When Beric sounded his horn the faggot bearers raised their burdens  on to their heads and formed in a close square, ten abreast, with  the faggots touching each other. Beric himself commanded the party  facing the principal entrance, and holding a blazing torch in each  hand, took his place in the centre of the square, there being ample  room for him between the lines of men. The rest of the tribe were  ordered to stand firmly in order until he gave the signal for the  advance. Then he again sounded his horn, and the two parties advanced  from the opposite ends of the square.    As soon as they came within reach the Romans showered down darts  and javelins; but these either slipped altogether from the surface  of the wet hides, or, penetrating them, went but a short distance  into the faggots; and the British tribesmen raised shouts of  exultation as the two solid bodies advanced unshaken to the steps  of the temple. Mounting these they advanced to the gates. In vain  the Romans dropped their javelins perpendicularly through the  holes in the ceiling of the colonnade, in vain poured down streams  of boiling oil, which had proved so fatal to the last attack. The  javelins failed to penetrate, the oil streamed harmless off the  hides. The men had, before advancing, received minute instructions.  The ten men in the front line piled their faggots against the door,  and then keeping close to the wall of the temple itself, slipped  round to the side colonnade.    The operation was repeated by the next line, and so on until but  two lines remained. Then the two men at each end of these lines  mounted the pile of faggots and placed their burdens there, leaving  but six standing. In their centre Beric had his place, and now,  kneeling down under their shelter, applied his torches to the pile.  He waited till he saw the flames beginning to mount up. Then he  gave the word; the six men dropped their faggots to the ground,  and with him ran swiftly to the side colonnade, where they were in  shelter, as the Romans, knowing they could not be attacked here,  had made no openings in the ceiling above. The Britons were frantic  with delight when they saw columns of smoke followed by tongues of  flames mounting from either end of the temple. Higher and higher  the flames mounted till they licked the ceiling above them.    For half an hour the fire continued, and by the end of that time  there was but a glowing mass of embers through which those without  could soon see right into the temple. The doors and the obstacles  behind them had been destroyed. As soon as he was aware by the  shouts of his countrymen that the faggots were well in a blaze,  Beric had sounded his horn, and he and the tribesmen from both  colonnades had run across the open unmolested by the darts of the  Romans, who were too panic stricken at the danger that threatened  them to pay any heed to their movements. Beric was received with  loud acclamations by the Iceni, and was escorted by a shouting  multitude to the queen, who had taken her place at a point where  she could watch the operations. She held out her hand to him. \"You  have succeeded, Beric,\" she said; \"and my thanks and those of all  here--nay, of all Britain--are due to you. In half an hour the  temple will be open to attack.\"    \"Hardly in that time, queen,\" he replied. \"The faggots will doubtless  have done their work by then, but it will be hours before the embers  and stonework will be sufficiently cool to enable men to pass over  them to the assault.\"    \"We can wait,\" the queen said. \"A messenger, who left the camp of  Cerealis at daybreak, has just arrived, and at that hour nothing  was known to the Romans of our attack here. They will not now arrive  until tomorrow.\"    Not until the afternoon was it considered that the entrances would  be cool enough to pass through. Then the Sarci prepared for the  attack, binding pieces of raw hide under their feet to protect them  from the heated stonework. They were formed ten abreast. Beric took  his place before the front line of one of the columns, and with  levelled spears they advanced at a run towards the doors. A shower  of missiles saluted them from the roof. Some fell, but the rest,  pressing on in close order, dashed through the gateway and flung  themselves upon the Roman soldiers drawn up to oppose their passage.  The resistance was feeble. The Romans had entirely lost heart and  could not for a moment sustain the weight of the charge. They were  swept away from the entrance, and the Britons poured in.    Standing in groups the Romans defended themselves in desperation;  but their efforts were vain, and in five minutes the last defender  of the place was slain. As soon as the fight was over the whole  of the Iceni rushed tumultuously forward with exultant shouts and  filled the temple; then a horn sounded and a lane was made, as  Boadicea, followed by her chiefs and chieftainesses, entered the  temple. The queen's face was radiant with triumph, and she would  have spoken but the shouting was so loud that those near her could  not obtain silence. They understood, however, when advancing to  the statues of the gods that stood behind the altars, she waved  her spear. In an instant the tribesmen swarmed round the statues,  ropes were attached to the massive figures, and Jupiter, Mars, and  Minerva fell to the ground with a crash, as did the statue of the  Emperor Claudius.    A mighty shout hailed its downfall. The gods of the Britons, insulted  and outraged, were avenged upon those of Rome; the altars of Mona  had streamed with the blood of the Druids, those of Camalodunum  were wet with the gore of Roman legionaries. The statues were broken  to pieces, the altars torn down, and then the chiefs ordered the  tribesmen to fetch in faggots. Thousands went to the forest, while  others pulled down detached houses and sheds that had escaped  the flames, and dragged the beams and woodwork to the temple.  By nightfall an enormous pile of faggots was raised round each of  the eight interior columns that in two lines supported the roof.  Torches were applied by Boadicea, her two daughters and some of the  principal Druids, and in a short time the interior of the temple was  a glowing furnace. The beams of the ceiling and roof soon ignited  and the flames shot up high into the air.    All day the Trinobantes had been pouring in, and a perfect frenzy  of delight reigned among the great crowd looking on at the destruction  of the temple that had been raised to signify and celebrate the  subjugation of Britain. Women with flowing hair performed wild  dances of triumph; some rushed about as if possessed with madness,  uttering prophecies of the total destruction of the Romans; others  foamed at the mouth and fell in convulsions, while the men were  scarcely less excited over their success. Messengers had already  brought in news that at midday Cerealis had learned that Camalodunum  had been attacked, and that the legion was to start on the following  morning to relieve the town.    The news had been taken to him by one of the Trinobantes, who had  received his instructions from Aska. He was to say that the town had  suddenly been attacked and that many had fallen; but the greater  portion of the population had escaped to the temple, which had  been vainly attacked by the Iceni. The object of this news was to  induce Cerealis to move out from his fortified camp. The chiefs  felt the difficulty of assaulting such a position, and though they  had dreaded the arrival of Cerealis before the temple was taken,  they were anxious that he should set out as soon as they saw that  Beric's plan of attack had succeeded, and that the temple was now  open to their assault.    At midnight the roof of the temple fell in, and nothing remained  but the bare walls and the columns surrounding them. The chiefs  ordered their followers to make their way through the still burning  town and to gather by tribes outside the defensive works, and there  lie down until morning, when they would march to meet the legion  of Cerealis. At daybreak they were again afoot and on the march  southward, swollen by the accession of the Trinobantes and by the  arrival during the last two days of tribes who had been too late  to join the rest at Cardun. The British force now numbered at least  fifty thousand.    \"It is a great army, Beric,\" Boduoc said exultingly as they moved  forward.    \"It is a great host,\" Beric replied. \"I would that it were an  army. Had they all even as much training as our men I should feel  confident in the future.\"    \"But surely you are confident now, Beric; we have begun well.\"    \"We have scarcely begun at all,\" Beric said. \"What have we done?  Destroyed a sleeping town and captured by means of fire a temple  defended by four hundred men. We shall win today, that I do not  doubt. The men are wrought up by their success, and the Romans are  little prepared to meet such a force--I doubt not that we shall  beat them, but to crush a legion is not to defeat Rome. I hope,  Boduoc, but I do not feel confident. Look back at the Sarci and then  look round at this disordered host. Well, the Romans in discipline  and order exceed the Sarci as much as we exceed the rest of the  Iceni. They will be led by generals trained in war; we are led by  chiefs whose only idea of war is to place themselves at the head of  their tribe and rush against the enemy. Whether courage and great  numbers can compensate for want of discipline remains to be seen.  The history of Rome tells me that it has never done so yet.\"    After five hours' marching some fleet footed scouts sent on ahead  brought in the news that the Romans were approaching. A halt  was called, and the chiefs assembled round the queen's chariot in  council. Beric was summoned by a messenger from the queen.    \"You must"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/706"],[0,"The Amateur Cracksman (#20)"],[1,"e, and  announced his intention of catching the 3.2 to Esher.    \"You must excuse me, Mr. Addenbrooke,\" said he, \"but I have my own  idea, and for the moment I should much prefer to keep it to myself.  It  may end in fizzle, so I would rather not speak about it to either of  you just yet.  But speak to Sir Bernard I must, so will you write me  one line to him on your card?  Of course, if you wish, you must come  down with me and hear what I say; but I really don't see much point in  it.\"    And as usual Raffles had his way, though Bennett Addenbrooke showed  some temper when he was gone, and I myself shared his annoyance to no  small extent.  I could only tell him that it was in the nature of  Raffles to be self-willed and secretive, but that no man of my  acquaintance had half his audacity and determination; that I for my  part would trust him through and through, and let him gang his own gait  every time.  More I dared not say, even to remove those chill  misgivings with which I knew that the lawyer went his way.    That day I saw no more of Raffles, but a telegram reached me when I was  dressing for dinner:    \"Be in your rooms to-morrow from noon and keep rest of day clear,  Raffles.\"     It had been sent off from Waterloo at 6.42.    So Raffles was back in town; at an earlier stage of our relations I  should have hunted him up then and there, but now I knew better.  His  telegram meant that he had no desire for my society that night or the  following forenoon; that when he wanted me I should see him soon enough.    And see him I did, towards one o'clock next day. I was watching for him  from my window in Mount Street, when he drove up furiously in a hansom,  and jumped out without a word to the man.  I met him next minute at the  lift gates, and he fairly pushed me back into my rooms.    \"Five minutes, Bunny!\" he cried.  \"Not a moment more.\"    And he tore off his coat before flinging himself into the nearest chair.    \"I'm fairly on the rush,\" he panted; \"having the very devil of a time!  Not a word till I tell you all I've done.  I settled my plan of  campaign yesterday at lunch.  The first thing was to get in with this  man Craggs; you can't break into a place like the MÃ©tropole, it's got  to be done from the inside.  Problem one, how to get at the fellow.  Only one sort of pretext would do--it must be something to do with this  blessed picture, so that I might see where he'd got it and all that.  Well, I couldn't go and ask to see it out of curiosity, and I couldn't  go as a second representative of the other old chap, and it was  thinking how I could go that made me such a bear at lunch.  But I saw  my way before we got up.  If I could only lay hold of a copy of the  picture I might ask leave to go and compare it with the original.  So  down I went to Esher to find out if there was a copy in existence, and  was at Broom Hall for one hour and a half yesterday afternoon.  There  was no copy there, but they must exist, for Sir Bernard himself  (there's 'copy' THERE!) has allowed a couple to be made since the  picture has been in his possession. He hunted up the painters'  addresses, and the rest of the evening I spent in hunting up the  painters themselves; but their work had been done on commission; one  copy had gone out of the country, and I'm still on the track of the  other.\"    \"Then you haven't seen Craggs yet?\"    \"Seen him and made friends with him, and if possible he's the funnier  old cuss of the two; but you should study 'em both.  I took the bull by  the horns this morning, went in and lied like Ananias, and it was just  as well I did--the old ruffian sails for Australia by to-morrow's boat.  I told him a man wanted to sell me a copy of the celebrated Infanta  Maria Teresa of Velasquez, that I'd been down to the supposed owner of  the picture, only to find that he had just sold it to him.  You should  have seen his face when I told him that!  He grinned all round his  wicked old head.  'Did OLD Debenham admit the sale?' says he; and when  I said he had he chuckled to himself for about five minutes.  He was so  pleased that he did just what I hoped he would do; he showed me the  great picture--luckily it isn't by any means a large one--also the case  he's got it in.  It's an iron map-case in which he brought over the  plans of his land in Brisbane; he wants to know who would suspect it of  containing an Old Master, too?  But he's had it fitted with a new  Chubb's lock, and I managed to take an interest in the key while he was  gloating over the canvas.  I had the wax in the palm of my hand, and I  shall make my duplicate this afternoon.\"    Raffles looked at his watch and jumped up saying he had given me a  minute too much.    \"By the way,\" he added, \"you've got to dine with him at the MÃ©tropole  to-night!\"    \"I?\"    \"Yes; don't look so scared.  Both of us are invited--I swore you were  dining with me.  I accepted for us both; but I sha'n't be there.\"    His clear eye was upon me, bright with meaning and with mischief.  I implored him to tell me what his meaning was.    \"You will dine in his private sitting-room,\" said Raffles; \"it adjoins  his bedroom.  You must keep him sitting as long as possible, Bunny, and  talking all the time!\"    In a flash I saw his plan.    \"You're going for the picture while we're at dinner?\"    \"I am.\"    \"If he hears you?\"    \"He sha'n't.\"    \"But if he does!\"    And I fairly trembled at the thought.    \"If he does,\" said Raffles, \"there will be a collision, that's all.  Revolver would be out of place in the MÃ©tropole, but I shall certainly  take a life-preserver.\"    \"But it's ghastly!\" I cried.  \"To sit and talk to an utter stranger and  to know that you're at work in the next room!\"    \"Two thousand apiece,\" said Raffles, quietly.    \"Upon my soul I believe I shall give it away!\"    \"Not you, Bunny.  I know you better than you know yourself.\"    He put on his coat and his hat.    \"What time have I to be there?\" I asked him, with a groan.    \"Quarter to eight.  There will be a telegram from me saying I can't  turn up.  He's a terror to talk, you'll have no difficulty in keeping  the ball rolling; but head him off his picture for all you're worth.  If he offers to show it to you, say you must go.  He locked up the case  elaborately this afternoon, and there's no earthly reason why he should  unlock it again in this hemisphere.\"    \"Where shall I find you when I get away?\"    \"I shall be down at Esher.  I hope to catch the 9.55.\"    \"But surely I can see you again this afternoon?\" I cried in a ferment,  for his hand was on the door.  \"I'm not half coached up yet!  I know I  shall make a mess of it!\"    \"Not you,\" he said again, \"but _I_ shall if I waste any more time.  I've got a deuce of a lot of rushing about to do yet.  You won't find  me at my rooms.  Why not come down to Esher yourself by the last train?  That's it--down you come with the latest news!  I'll tell old Debenham  to expect you: he shall give us both a bed.  By Jove! he won't be able  to do us too well if he's got his picture.\"    \"If!\" I groaned as he nodded his adieu; and he left me limp with  apprehension, sick with fear, in a perfectly pitiable condition of pure  stage-fright.    For, after all, I had only to act my part; unless Raffles failed where  he never did fail, unless Raffles the neat and noiseless was for once  clumsy and inept, all I had to do was indeed to \"smile and smile and be  a villain.\"  I practiced that smile half the afternoon.  I rehearsed  putative parts in hypothetical conversations.  I got up stories.  I  dipped in a book on Queensland at the club.  And at last it was 7.45,  and I was making my bow to a somewhat elderly man with a small bald  head and a retreating brow.    \"So you're Mr. Raffles's friend?\" said he, overhauling me rather rudely  with his light small eyes. \"Seen anything of him?  Expected him early  to show me something, but he's never come.\"    No more, evidently, had his telegram, and my troubles were beginning  early.  I said I had not seen Raffles since one o'clock, telling the  truth with unction while I could; even as we spoke there came a knock  at the door; it was the telegram at last, and, after reading it  himself, the Queenslander handed it to me.    \"Called out of town!\" he grumbled.  \"Sudden illness of near relative!  What near relatives has he got?\"    I knew of none, and for an instant I quailed before the perils of  invention; then I replied that I had never met any of his people, and  again felt fortified by my veracity.    \"Thought you were bosom pals?\" said he, with (as I imagined) a gleam of  suspicion in his crafty little eyes.    \"Only in town,\" said I.  \"I've never been to his place.\"    \"Well,\" he growled, \"I suppose it can't be helped.  Don't know why he  couldn't come and have his dinner first.  Like to see the death-bed I'D  go to without MY dinner; it's a full-skin billet, if you ask me.  Well,  must just dine without him, and he'll have to buy his pig in a poke  after all.  Mind touching that bell?  Suppose you know what he came to  see me about?  Sorry I sha'n't see him again, for his own sake.  I  liked Raffles--took to him amazingly.  He's a cynic.  Like cynics.  One  myself.  Rank bad form of his mother or his aunt, and I hope she will  go and kick the bucket.\"    I connect these specimens of his conversation, though they were  doubtless detached at the time, and interspersed with remarks of mine  here and there.  They filled the interval until dinner was served, and  they gave me an impression of the man which his every subsequent  utterance confirmed.  It was an impression which did away with all  remorse for my treacherous presence at his table.  He was that terrible  type, the Silly Cynic, his aim a caustic commentary on all things and  all men, his achievement mere vulgar irreverence and unintelligent  scorn.  Ill-bred and ill-informed, he had (on his own showing) fluked  into fortune on a rise in land;"]]]
