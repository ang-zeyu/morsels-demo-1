[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38777"],[0,"Lad: A Dog (#20)"],[1," glad friendliness; his muzzled nose  sought wistfully to kiss the pink little face on a level with his  own. The baby tightened her hug, and laid her rose leaf cheek close to  his own.    \"I love you, Miss Doggie!\" she whispered in Lad's ear.    Then the fat woman in black bore down upon them. Fiercely, she  yanked the baby away from the dog. Then, seeing that the mud on  Lad's shoulder had soiled the child's white coat, she whirled a  string-fastened bundle aloft and brought it down with a resounding  thwack over the dog's head.    Lad winched under the heavy blow, then hot resentment blazed through  his first instant of grieved astonishment. This unpleasant fat  creature in black was not a man, wherefore Lad contented himself by  baring his white teeth, and with growling deep menace far down in his  throat.    The woman shrank back scared, and she screamed loudly. On the instant  the station-bound patrolman was beside her.    \"What's wrong, ma'am?\" asked the bluecoat.    The woman pointed a wobbly and fat forefinger at Lad, who had taken up  his westward journey again and was halfway across the street.    \"Mad dog!\" she sputtered, hysterically. \"He--he bit me! Bit _at_ me,  anyhow!\"    Without waiting to hear the last qualifying sentence, the patrolman  gave chase. Here was a chance for honorable blotter-mention at the  very least. As he ran he drew his pistol.    Lad had reached the westward pavement of Amsterdam Avenue and was in  the side street beyond. He was not hurrying, but his short wolf-trot  ate up ground in deceptively quick time.    By the time the policeman had reached the west corner of street and  avenue the dog was nearly a half-block ahead. The officer, still  running, leveled his pistol and fired.    Now, anyone (but a very newly-appointed patrolman or a movie-hero)  knows that to fire a shot when running is worse than fatal to any  chance of accuracy. No marksman--no one who has the remotest knowledge  of marksmanship--will do such a thing. The very best pistol-expert  cannot hope to hit his target if he is joggling his own arm and his  whole body by the motion of running.    The bullet flew high and to the right, smashing a second-story window  and making the echoes resound deafeningly through the narrow street.    \"What's up?\" excitedly asked a boy, who stood beside a barrel bonfire  with a group of chums.    \"Mad dog!\" puffed the policeman as he sped past.    At once the boys joined gleesomely in the chase, outdistancing the  officer, just as the latter fired a second shot.    Lad felt a white-hot ridge of pain cut along his left flank like a  whip-lash. He wheeled to face his invisible foe, and he found  himself looking at a half-dozen boys who charged whoopingly down on  him. Behind the boys clumped a man in blue flourishing something  bright.    Lad had no taste for this sort of attention. Always he had loathed  strangers, and these new strangers seemed bent on catching him--on  barring his homeward way.    He wheeled around again and continued his westward journey at a faster  pace. The hue-and-cry broke into louder yells and three or four new  recruits joined the pursuers. The yap of \"Mad dog! _Mad dog!_\" filled  the air.    Not one of these people--not even the policeman himself--had any  evidence that the collie was mad. There are not two really rabid dogs  seen at large in New York or in any other city in the course of a  year. Yet, at the back of the human throat ever lurks that fool-cry of  \"Mad dog!\"--ever ready to leap forth into shouted words at the  faintest provocation.    One wonders, disgustedly, how many thousand luckless and totally  harmless pet dogs in the course of a year are thus hunted down and  shot or kicked or stoned to death in the sacred name of Humanity, just  because some idiot mistakes a hanging tongue or an uncertainty of  direction for signs of that semi-phantom malady known as \"rabies.\"    A dog is lost. He wanders to and fro in bewilderment. Boys pelt or  chase him. His tongue lolls and his eyes glaze with fear. Then, ever,  rises the yell of \"Mad Dog!\" And a friendly, lovable pet is joyfully  done to death.    Lad crossed Broadway, threading his way through the trolley-and-taxi  procession, and galloped down the hill toward Riverside Park. Close  always at his heels followed the shouting crowd. Twice, by sprinting,  the patrolman gained the front rank of the hunt, and twice he  fired--both bullets going wide. Across West End Avenue and across  Riverside Drive went Lad, hard-pressed and fleeing at top speed. The  cross-street ran directly down to a pier that jutted a hundred feet  out into the Hudson River.    Along this pier flew Lad, not in panic terror, but none the less  resolved that these howling New Yorkers should not catch him and  prevent his going home.    Onto the pier the clattering hue-and-cry followed. A dock watchman,  as Lad flashed by, hurled a heavy joist of wood at the dog. It whizzed  past the flying hind legs, scoring the barest of misses.    And now Lad was at the pier end. Behind him the crowd raced; sure it  had the dangerous brute cornered at last.    On the string-piece the collie paused for the briefest of moments  glancing to north and to south. Everywhere the wide river stretched  away, unbridged. It must be crossed if he would continue his homeward  course, and there was but one way for him to cross it.    The watchman, hard at his heels, swung upward the club he carried.  Down came the club with murderous force--upon the stringpiece  where Lad had been standing.    Lad was no longer there. One great bound had carried him over the edge  and into the black water below.    Down he plunged into the river and far, far under it, fighting his way  gaspingly to the surface. The water that gushed into his mouth and  nostrils was salty and foul, not at all like the water of the lake at  the edge of The Place. It sickened him. And the February chill of the  river cut into him like a million ice-needles.    To the surface he came, and struck out valorously for the opposite  shore much more than a mile away. As his beautiful head appeared, a  yell went up from the clustering riff-raff at the pier end. Bits of  wood and coal began to shower the water all around him. A pistol shot  plopped into the river a bare six inches away from him.    But the light was bad and the stream was a tossing mass of blackness  and of light-blurs, and presently the dog swam, unscathed, beyond the  range of missiles.    Now a swim of a mile or of two miles was no special exploit for  Lad--even in ice-cold water, but this water was not like any he had  swum in. The tide was at the turn for one thing, and while, in a way,  this helped him, yet the myriad eddies and cross-currents engendered  by it turned and jostled and buffeted him in a most perplexing  way. And there were spars and barrels and other obstacles that were  forever looming up just in front of him or else banging against his  heaving sides.    Once a revenue cutter passed not thirty feet ahead of him. Its wake  caught the dog and sucked him under and spun his body around and  around before he could fight clear of it.    His lungs were bursting. He was worn out. He felt as sore as if he had  been kicked for an hour. The bullet-graze along his flank was hurting  him as the salt water bit into it, and the muzzle half-blinded,  half-smothered him.    But, because of his hero heart rather than through his splendid  strength and wisdom, he kept on.    For an hour or more he swam until at last his body and brain were  numb, and only the mechanical action of his wrenched muscles held him  in motion. Twice tugs narrowly escaped running him down, and in the  wake of each he waged a fearful fight for life.    After a century of effort his groping forepaws felt the impact of a  submerged rock, then of another, and with his last vestige of strength  Lad crawled feebly ashore on a narrow sandspit at the base of the  elephant-gray Palisades. There, he collapsed and lay shivering,  panting, struggling for breath.    Long he lay there, letting Nature bring back some of his wind and his  motive-power, his shaggy body one huge pulsing ache.    When he was able to move, he took up his journey. Sometimes swimming,  sometimes on ground, he skirted the Palisades-foot to northward, until  he found one of the several precipice-paths that Sunday picnickers  love to climb. Up this he made his tottering way, slowly; conserving  his strength as best he could.    On the summit he lay down again to rest. Behind him, across the  stretch of black and lamp-flecked water, rose the inky skyline of the  city with a lurid furnace-glow between its crevices that smote the  sky. Ahead was a plateau with a downward slope beyond it.    Once more, getting to his feet, Lad stood and sniffed, turning his  head from side to side, muzzled nose aloft. Then, his bearings taken,  he set off again, but this time his jog-trot was slower and his light  step was growing heavier. The terrible strain of his swim was passing  from his mighty sinews, but it was passing slowly because he was so  tired and empty and in such pain of body and mind. He saved his  energies until he should have more of them to save.    Across the plateau, down the slope, and then across the interminable  salt meadows to westward he traveled; sometimes on road or path,  sometimes across field or hill, but always in an unswerving straight  line.    It was a little before midnight that he breasted the first rise of  Jersey hills above Hackensack. Through a lightless one-street village  he went, head low, stride lumbering, the muzzle weighing a ton and  composed of molten iron and hornet stings.    It was the muzzle--now his first fatigue had slackened--that galled  him worst. Its torture was beginning to do queer things to his nerves  and brain. Even a stolid, nerveless dog hates a muzzle. More than one  sensitive dog has been driven crazy by it.

This hospitable house is the residence of the British Agent or _Vakil_  for Kirmanshah, in whose absence at Tihran, his son, Abdul Rahim,  performs the duties of hospitality in a most charming manner, as if  though a very busy man he had nothing else to do but carry out the  wishes of his guests. His hospitality is most unobtrusive also, and  considerate. If such a wish is expressed as to visit the sculptures of  the Takt-i-Bostan, or anything else, everything is quietly and  beautifully arranged; a landau-and-four with outriders, superb led  saddle-horses, and arrangements for coffee are ready outside the  walls, with the host as _cicerone_, ready to drive or ride at the  pleasure of his guests. The rooms in which he receives Europeans are  on the opposite side of the courtyard from the house, and have been  arranged according to European ideas.    The family history, as usually told, is an interesting one. They are  Arabs, and the grandfather of our host, Hadji Khalil, was a trusted  _katirgi_ in the employment of Sir Henry Rawlinson, and saved his life  when he fell from a scaffolding while copying the Besitun  inscriptions. His good qualities, and an honesty of character and  purpose rare among Orientals, eventually placed him in the important  position of British _Vakil_ here, and he became a British subject, and  was succeeded in his position by his son, Agha Hassan, who is now by  virtue of singular business capacities the wealthiest man in this  province and possibly in Persia, and bears the very highest character  for trustworthiness and honour.[15]    Abdul Rahim is a very fine-looking man, with noticeable eyes, very  large and prominent. He has a strong sense of humour, which flits over  his face in an amused smile. He and his father are very large  landowners, and are always adding land to land, and are now the owners  of the magnificent sculptures and pleasure-grounds of the  Takt-i-Bostan. They are bankers likewise, and money-lenders, merchants  on a large scale, and have built a very fine caravanserai, with great  brick warehouses for the use of traders. Agha Hassan travels _en  prince_, driving to Tihran and back in an English landau with four  horses and a number of outriders and attendants, and his son  entertains visitors in the same way, mounting even the outriders and  pipe-bearers on well-bred Arabs. When he walks in the city it is like  a royal progress. Everybody bows low, nearly to the ground, and his  purse-bearer follows, distributing alms among the poor.    I mention all this because it is a marvel in Persia, where a  reputation for wealth is the last thing a rich man desires. To elevate  a gateway or to give any external sign of affluence is to make himself  a mark for the official rapacity which spares none. The policy is to  let a man grow quietly rich, to \"let the sheep's wool grow,\" but as  soon as he shows any enjoyment of wealth to deprive him of his gains,  according to a common Persian expression, \"He is ripe, he must be  squeezed.\" The _Vakil_ and his son are the only men here who are not  afraid to show their wealth, and for the simple reason that it cannot  be touched, because they are British subjects. They can neither be  robbed, squeezed, nor mulcted beyond the legitimate taxation by  Persian officials, and are able to protect the property of others when  it is entrusted to their keeping. British protection has been in fact  the making of these men.    The _menage_ is simple. The dining-room is across the frozen  courtyard. The meals are served in European fashion, the _major-domo_  being an ancient man, \"born in the house,\" who occasionally inserts a  remark into the conversation or helps his master's memory. The  interpreter sits on the floor during meals. I breakfast in my room,  but lunch and dine with our host, who spends the evening in the  _salon_; sherbet is provided instead of wine. Abdul Rahim places me at  the head of the table, and I am served first! The interpreting is from  Persian into Hindustani, and _vice versa_. Our host expresses almost  daily regret that he cannot talk with me on politics!    Kirmanshah, which is said to be a favourable specimen of a Persian  town, is absolutely hideous and uninteresting. It is really half in  ruins. It has suffered terribly from \"plague, pestilence, and famine,\"  and from the awful rapacity of governors. It once had 12,000 houses,  but the highest estimate of its present population is 25,000. So  severely have the town and province been oppressed that some years ago  three-quarters of the inhabitants migrated, the peasants into Turkey,  and the townspeople into the northern province of Azerbijan. If a  governor pays 30,000 _tumans_ (L10,000) to the Shah for an  appointment, of which he may be deprived any day, it can scarcely be  expected of Oriental, or indeed of any human nature, that he will not  make a good thing of it while he has it, and squeeze all he can out of  the people.    The streets are very narrow, and look narrower just now, because the  snow is heaped almost to the top of the mud walls, which are not  broken up as in Turkish towns by projecting lattice windows, but are  absolutely blank, with the exception of low-arched entrances to the  courtyards within, closed by heavy, unpainted wooden doors, studded  with wooden nails. The causeways, on which, but for the heaps of  slippery snow two men might walk abreast, have a ditch two or three  feet wide between them, which is the roadway for animals. There are  some open spaces, abounding in ruinous heaps, others where goods are  unloaded, surrounded with warehouses, immense brick bazars with domed  roofs, a citadel or _ark_, where the Governor lives, a large parade  ground and barracks for 2000 men, mosques of no pretensions, public  baths, caravanserais, brick warehouses behind the bazars, public  gardens, with fountains and avenues of poplars, a prison, and some  good houses like this one, hidden behind high mud walls. Although the  snow kindly veils a good deal of deformity, the city impresses one as  ruinous and decayed; yet it has a large trade, and is regarded as one  of the most prosperous places in the Empire.[16]    The bazars are spacious and well stocked with European goods,  especially with Manchester cottons of colours and patterns suited to  Oriental taste, which loves carnation red. There are many Jews,  otherwise the people are Shiah Moslems, with an increasing admixture  of the secret sect of the _B[=a]bis_. In some respects the Shiahs are  more fanatical than the Sunnis, as, for instance, it is quite possible  to visit a mosque in Turkey, but here a Christian is not allowed to  cross the threshold of the outer gate. Certain customs are also more  rigidly observed. A Persian woman would be in danger of death from the  mob if she appeared unveiled in the streets. When I walked through the  town, though attended by a number of men, the _major-domo_ begged me  to exchange my gauze veil for a mask, and even when I showed this  deference to custom the passing through the bazars was very  unpleasant, the men being decidedly rude, and inclined to hoot and use  bad language. Even the touch of a Christian is regarded as polluting,  and I nearly got into trouble by handling a \"flap-jack,\" mistaking it  for a piece of felt. The bazars are not magnificent. No rich carpets  or other goods are exposed to view for fear of exactions. A buyer  wanting such things must send word privately, and have them brought to  his house.    Justice seems to be here, much as in Turkey, a marketable commodity,  which the working classes are too poor to buy. A man may be kept in  prison because he is too poor to get out, but justice is usually  summary, and men are not imprisoned for long terms. If prisoners have  friends, the friends feed them, if not they depend on charity, and  charity is a Moslem virtue. There is no prison here for women. They  are punished by having their heads shaved, and by being taken through  the town on asses. Various forms of torture are practised, such as  burning with hot irons, the bastinado, and squeezing the fingers in a  vice. The bastinado is also most extensively used as a punishment.    Yesterday by appointment we were received by the Governor of the  Province. Riding through the slippery snow-heaped alleys is not what  Europeans would think of, and our host with his usual courtesy  humoured the caprice by walking with us himself, preceded by six  _far[=a]shes_ (lit. carpet-spreaders) and followed by his purse-bearer  casting money to the poor, and a train of servants. The Citadel, or  Governor's residence, like all else, is forlorn, dirty, and ruinous in  its approaches, which are long vaulted corridors capable of much  adornment. Crowds of soldiers, _mollahs_, dervishes, and others were  there to see the visit, which was one of ceremony. The Palace and  Government offices are many-windowed, well-built brick-and-tile  buildings, arranged round a large _place_ with trees and fountains.    Two little fellows in scarlet uniform were at the entrance, and the  lobby upstairs was crowded with Persian and Negro servants, all in  high, black lambskin caps, tight black trousers, and tight coats with  full skirts. The Governor received us in a very large, lofty,  vacant-looking room, and shook hands. I never saw a human being more  nearly like an ape in appearance, and a loud giggle added to the  resemblance. This giggle and a fatuous manner are possibly assumed,  for he has the widespread reputation of being a very able man, shrewd  in business and officially rapacious, as was his father before him.  The grotesque figure, not more than five feet high, was dressed in a  black Astrakan cap, a coat of fine buff Russian kerseymere with full  skirts, and tight trousers of the same, and an under-coat of rich,  Kerman silk brocade, edged with costly fur. He made a few curt remarks  to his foreign guests,"]]]
