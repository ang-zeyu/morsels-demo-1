May a deserving husband bless my Gertrude,  For this warm, glowing heart is formed for love.  Bertha, thy choice is better, thou hadst rather  Become the chaste and pious bride of heaven;  Oh! haste thee to fulfil thy vows; the goods  Of earth are all deceitful; thou may'st learn  This lesson from thy queen. No more; farewell,  Farewell, farewell, my friends, farewell for ever.       [She turns suddenly from them; all but MELVIL     retire at different sides.        SCENE VII.       MARY, MELVIL.    MARY (after the others are all gone).  I have arranged all temporal concerns,  And hope to leave the world in debt to none;  Melvil, one thought alone there is which binds  My troubled soul, nor suffers it to fly  Delighted and at liberty to heaven.    MELVIL.  Disclose it to me; ease your bosom, trust  Your doubts, your sorrows, to your faithful friend.    MARY.  I see eternity's abyss before me;  Soon must I stand before the highest Judge,  And have not yet appeased the Holy One.  A priest of my religion is denied me,  And I disdain to take the sacrament,  The holy, heavenly nourishment, from priests  Of a false faith; I die in the belief  Of my own church, for that alone can save.    MELVIL.  Compose your heart; the fervent, pious wish  Is prized in heaven as high as the performance.  The might of tyrants can but bind the hands,  The heart's devotion rises free to God,  The word is dead--'tis faith which brings to life.    MARY.  The heart is not sufficient of itself;  Our faith must have some earthly pledge to ground  Its claim to the high bliss of heaven. For this  Our God became incarnate, and enclosed  Mysteriously his unseen heavenly grace  Within an outward figure of a body.  The church it is, the holy one, the high one,  Which rears for us the ladder up to heaven:--  'Tis called the Catholic Apostolic church,--  For 'tis but general faith can strengthen faith;  Where thousands worship and adore the heat  Breaks out in flame, and, borne on eagle wings,  The soul mounts upwards to the heaven of heavens.  Ah! happy they, who for the glad communion  Of pious prayer meet in the house of God!  The altar is adorned, the tapers blaze,  The bell invites, the incense soars on high;  The bishop stands enrobed, he takes the cup,  And blessing it declares the solemn mystery,  The transformation of the elements;  And the believing people fall delighted  To worship and adore the present Godhead.  Alas! I only am debarred from this;  The heavenly benediction pierces not  My prison walls: its comfort is denied me.    MELVIL.  Yes! it can pierce them--put thy trust in Him  Who is almighty--in the hand of faith,  The withered staff can send forth verdant branches  And he who from the rock called living water,  He can prepare an altar in this prison,  Can change----     [Seizing the cup, which stands upon the table.         The earthly contents of this cup  Into a substance of celestial grace.    MARY.  Melvil! Oh, yes, I understand you, Melvil!  Here is no priest, no church, no sacrament;  But the Redeemer says, \"When two or three  Are in my name assembled, I am with them,\"  What consecrates the priest? Say, what ordains him  To be the Lord's interpreter? a heart  Devoid of guile, and a reproachless conduct.  Well, then, though unordained, be you my priest;  To you will I confide my last confession,  And take my absolution from your lips.    MELVIL.  If then thy heart be with such zeal inflamed,  I tell thee that for thine especial comfort,  The Lord may work a miracle. Thou say'st  Here is no priest, no church, no sacrament--  Thou err'st--here is a priest--here is a God;  A God descends to thee in real presence.       [At these words he uncovers his head,     and shows a host in a golden vessel.    I am a priest--to hear thy last confession,  And to announce to thee the peace of God  Upon thy way to death. I have received  Upon my head the seven consecrations.  I bring thee, from his Holiness, this host,  Which, for thy use, himself has deigned to bless.    MARY.  Is then a heavenly happiness prepared  To cheer me on the very verge of death?  As an immortal one on golden clouds  Descends, as once the angel from on high,  Delivered the apostle from his fetters:--  He scorns all bars, he scorns the soldier's sword,  He steps undaunted through the bolted portals,  And fills the dungeon with his native glory;  Thus here the messenger of heaven appears  When every earthly champion had deceived me.  And you, my servant once, are now the servant  Of the Most High, and his immortal Word!  As before me your knees were wont to bend,  Before you humbled, now I kiss the dust.       [She sinks before him on her knees.    MELVIL (making over her the sign of the cross).  Hear, Mary, Queen of Scotland:--in the name  Of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,  Hast thou examined carefully thy heart,  Swearest thou, art thou prepared in thy confession  To speak the truth before the God of truth?    MARY.  Before my God and thee, my heart lies open.    MELVIL.  What calls thee to the presence of the Highest?    MARY.  I humbly do acknowledge to have erred  Most grievously, I tremble to approach,  Sullied with sin, the God of purity.    MELVIL.  Declare the sin which weighs so heavily  Upon thy conscience since thy last confession.    MARY.  My heart was filled with thoughts of envious hate,  And vengeance took possession of my bosom.  I hope forgiveness of my sins from God,  Yet could I not forgive my enemy.    MELVIL.  Repentest thou of the sin? Art thou, in sooth,  Resolved to leave this world at peace with all?    MARY.  As surely as I wish the joys of heaven.    MELVIL.  What other sin hath armed thy heart against thee?    MARY.  Ah! not alone through hate; through lawless love  Have I still more abused the sovereign good.  My heart was vainly turned towards the man  Who left me in misfortune, who deceived me.    MELVIL.  Repentest thou of the sin? And hast thou turned  Thy heart, from this idolatry, to God?    MARY.  It was the hardest trial I have passed;  This last of earthly bonds is torn asunder.    MELVIL.  What other sin disturbs thy guilty conscience?    MARY.  A bloody crime, indeed of ancient date,  And long ago confessed; yet with new terrors.  It now attacks me, black and grisly steps  Across my path, and shuts the gates of heaven:  By my connivance fell the king, my husband--  I gave my hand and heart to a seducer--  By rigid penance I have made atonement;  Yet in my soul the worm is gnawing still.    MELVIL.  Has then thy heart no other accusation,  Which hath not been confessed and washed away?    MARY.  All you have heard with which my heart is charged.    MELVIL.  Think on the presence of Omniscience;  Think on the punishments with which the church  Threatens imperfect and reserved confessions  This is the sin to everlasting death,  For this is sinning 'gainst his Holy Spirit.    MARY.  So may eternal grace with victory  Crown my last contest, as I wittingly  Have nothing hid----    MELVIL.            How? Wilt thou then conceal  The crime from God for which thou art condemned?  Thou tell'st me nothing of the share thou hadst  In Babington and Parry's bloody treason:  Thou diest for this a temporal death; for this  Wilt thou, too, die the everlasting death?    MARY.  I am prepared to meet eternity;  Within the narrow limits of an hour  I shall appear before my Judge's throne.  But, I repeat it, my confession's ended.    MELVIL.  Consider well--the heart is a deceiver.  Thou hast, perhaps, with sly equivocation,  The word avoided, which would make thee guilty  Although thy will was party to the crime.  Remember, that no juggler's tricks can blind  The eye of fire which darts through every breast.    MARY.  'Tis true that I have called upon all princes  To free me from unworthy chains; yet 'tis  As true that, neither by intent or deed,  Have I attempted my oppressor's life.    MELVIL.  Your secretaries then have witnessed falsely.    MARY.  It is as I have said;--what they have witnessed  The Lord will judge.    MELVIL.             Thou mountest, then, satisfied  Of thy own innocence, the fatal scaffold?    MARY.  God suffers me in mercy to atone,  By undeserved death, my youth's transgressions.    MELVIL (making over her the sign of the cross).  Go, then, and expiate them all by death;  Sink a devoted victim on the altar,  Thus shall thy blood atone the blood thou'st spilt.  From female frailty were derived thy faults,  Free from the weakness of mortality,  The spotless spirit seeks the blest abodes.  Now, then, by the authority which God  Hath unto me committed, I absolve thee  From all thy sins; be as thy faith thy welfare!       [He gives her the host.    Receive the body which for thee was offered--       [He takes the cup which stands upon the table,     consecrates it with silent prayer, then presents     it to her; she hesitates to take it, and makes     signs to him to withdraw it.    Receive the blood which for thy sins was shed,  Receive it; 'tis allowed thee by the pope  To exercise in death the highest office  Of kings, the holy office of the priesthood.       [She takes the cup.    And as thou now, in this his earthly body  Hast held with God mysterious communion,  So may'st thou henceforth, in his realm of joy,  Where sin no more exists, nor tears of woe,  A fair, transfigured spirit, join thyself  Forever with the Godhead, and forever.       [He sets down the cup; hearing a noise,     he covers his head, and goes to the door;     MARY remains in silent devotion on her knees.    MELVIL (returning).  A painful conflict is in store for thee.  Feel'st thou within thee strength enough to smother  Each impulse of malignity and hate?    MARY.  I fear not a relapse. I have to God  Devoted both my hatred and my love.    MELVIL.  Well, then, prepare thee to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6798"],[0,"Aesthetical Essays of Friedrich Schiller (#20)"],[1," a  problem that can no doubt embarrass the metaphysician, but not the  transcendental philosopher. The latter does not presume to explain the  possibility of things, but he is satisfied with giving a solid basis to  the knowledge that makes us understand the possibility of experience.  And as experience would be equally impossible without this autonomy in  the mind, and without the absolute unity of the mind, it lays down these  two conceptions as two conditions of experience equally necessary without  troubling itself any more to reconcile them. Moreover, this immanence of  two fundamental impulses does not in any degree contradict the absolute  unity of the mind, as soon as the mind itself, its selfhood, is  distinguished from those two motors. No doubt, these two impulses exist  and act in it, but itself is neither matter nor form, nor the sensuous  nor reason, and this is a point that does not seem always to have  occurred to those who only look upon the mind as itself acting when its  acts are in harmony with reason, and who declare it passive when its acts  contradict reason.    Arrived at its development, each of these two fundamental impulsions  tends of necessity and by its nature to satisfy itself; but precisely  because each of them has a necessary tendency, and both nevertheless have  an opposite tendency, this twofold constraint mutually destroys itself,  and the will preserves an entire freedom between them both. It is  therefore the will that conducts itself like a power--as the basis of  reality--with respect to both these impulses; but neither of them can by  itself act as a power with respect to the other. A violent man, by his  positive tendency to justice, which never fails in him, is turned away  from injustice; nor can a temptation of pleasure, however strong, make a  strong character violate its principles. There is in man no other power  than his will; and death alone, which destroys man, or some privation of  self-consciousness, is the only thing that can rob man of his internal  freedom.    An external necessity determines our condition, our existence in time, by  means of the sensuous. The latter is quite involuntary, and directly it  is produced in us we are necessarily passive. In the same manner an  internal necessity awakens our personality in connection with sensations,  and by its antagonism with them; for consciousness cannot depend on the  will, which presupposes it. This primitive manifestation of personality  is no more a merit to us than its privation is a defect in us. Reason  can only be required in a being who is self-conscious, for reason is an  absolute consecutiveness and universality of consciousness; before this  is the case he is not a man, nor can any act of humanity be expected from  him. The metaphysician can no more explain the limitation imposed by  sensation on a free and autonomous mind than the natural philosopher can  understand the infinite, which is revealed in consciousness in connection  with these limits. Neither abstraction nor experience can bring us back  to the source whence issue our ideas of necessity and of universality:  this source is concealed in its origin in time from the observer, and its  super-sensuous origin from the researches of the metaphysician. But, to  sum up in a few words, consciousness is there, and, together with its  immutable unity, the law of all that is for man is established, as well  as of all that is to be by man, for his understanding and his activity.  The ideas of truth and of right present themselves inevitable,  incorruptible, immeasurable, even in the age of sensuousness; and without  our being able to say why or how, we see eternity in time, the necessary  following the contingent. It is thus that, without any share on the part  of the subject, the sensation and self-consciousness arise, and the  origin of both is beyond our volition, as it is out of the sphere of our  knowledge.    But as soon as these two faculties have passed into action, and man has  verified by his experience, through the medium of sensation, a  determinate existence, and through the medium of consciousness its  absolute existence, the two fundamental impulses exert their influence  directly their object is given. The sensuous impulse is awakened with  the experience of life--with the beginning of the individual; the  rational impulsion with the experience of law--with the beginning of his  personality; and it is only when these two inclinations have come into  existence that the human type is realized. Up to that time, everything  takes place in man according to the law of necessity; but now the hand of  nature lets him go, and it is for him to keep upright humanity, which  nature places as a germ in his heart. And thus we see that directly the  two opposite and fundamental impulses exercise their influence in him,  both lose their constraint, and the autonomy of two necessities gives  birth to freedom.          LETTER XX.      That freedom is an active and not a passive principle results from its  very conception; but that liberty itself should be an effect of nature  (taking this word in its widest sense), and not the work of man, and  therefore that it can be favored or thwarted by natural means, is the  necessary consequence of that which precedes. It begins only when man is  complete, and when these two fundamental impulsions have been developed.  It will then be wanting whilst he is incomplete, and while one of these  impulsions is excluded, and it will be re-established by all that gives  back to man his integrity.    Thus it is possible, both with regard to the entire species as to the  individual, to remark the moment when man is yet incomplete, and when one  of the two exclusions acts solely in him. We know that man commences by  life simply, to end by form; that he is more of an individual than a  person, and that he starts from the limited or finite to approach the  infinite. The sensuous impulsion comes into play therefore before the  rational impulsion, because sensation precedes consciousness; and in this  priority of sensuous impulsion we find the key of the history of the  whole of human liberty.    There is a moment, in fact, when the instinct of life, not yet opposed to  the instinct of form, acts as nature and as necessity; when the sensuous  is a power because man has not begun; for even in man there can be no  other power than his will. But when man shall have attained to the power  of thought, reason, on the contrary, will be a power, and moral or  logical necessity will take the place of physical necessity. Sensuous  power must then be annihilated before the law which must govern it can be  established. It is not enough that something shall begin which as yet  was not; previously something must end which had begun. Man cannot pass  immediately from sensuousness to thought. He must step backwards, for it  is only when one determination is suppressed that the contrary  determination can take place. Consequently, in order to exchange passive  against active liberty, a passive determination against an active, he  must be momentarily free from all determination, and must traverse a  state of pure determinability. He has then to return in some degree to  that state of pure negative indetermination in which he was before his  senses were affected by anything. But this state was absolutely empty of  all contents, and now the question is to reconcile an equal determination  and a determinability equally without limit, with the greatest possible  fulness, because from this situation something positive must immediately  follow. The determination which man received by sensation must be  preserved, because he should not lose the reality; but at the same time,  in so far as finite, it should be suppressed, because a determinability  without limit would take place. The problem consists then in  annihilating the determination of the mode of existence, and yet at the  same time in preserving it, which is only possible in one way: in  opposing to it another. The two sides of a balance are in equilibrium  when empty; they are also in equilibrium when their contents are of equal  weight.    Thus, to pass from sensation to thought, the soul traverses a medium  position, in which sensibility and reason are at the same time active,  and thus they mutually destroy their determinant power, and by their  antagonism produce a negation. This medium situation in which the soul  is neither physically nor morally constrained, and yet is in both ways  active, merits essentially the name of a free situation; and if we call  the state of sensuous determination physical, and the state of rational  determination logical or moral, that state of real and active  determination should be called the aesthetic.            LETTER XXI.      I have remarked in the beginning of the foregoing letter that there is a  twofold condition of determinableness and a twofold condition of  determination. And now I can clear up this proposition.    The mind can be determined--is determinable--only in as far as it is not  determined; it is, however, determinable also, in as far as it is not  exclusively determined; that is, if it is not confined in its  determination. The former is only a want of determination--it is without  limits, because it is without reality; but the latter, the aesthetic  determinableness, has no limits, because it unites all reality.    The mind is determined, inasmuch as it is only limited; but it is also  determined because it limits itself of its own absolute capacity. It is  situated in the former position when it feels, in the second when it  thinks. Accordingly the aesthetic constitution is in relation to  determinableness what thought is in relation to determination. The  latter is a negative from internal and infinite completeness, the former  a limitation from internal infinite power. Feeling and thought come into  contact in one single "]]]
