We shortly afterwards crossed a hollow, similar to that Mr. Hume  had described, in which bulrushes had taken the place of reeds.  Flooded-gum trees, of large size, were also growing in it, but on either  side box alone prevailed, under which the forest grass grew to a  considerable height. We crossed the hollow two or three times, and as  often remarked the line of separation between those trees. The last time  we crossed it the country rose a few feet, and we journeyed for the  remainder of the day, at one time over good plains, at another through  brushes, until we found water and feed, at which we stopped for the night,  after having travelling about thirteen miles on a W. by N. course. The  mosquitoes were so extremely troublesome at this place that we called it  Mosquito Brush. At this time my men were improving rapidly, and Mr. Hume  complained less, and looked better. I hoped, therefore, that our progress  would be rapid into the interior.    CREEK LEADING NORTHERLY; PRODUCTIONS OF THE COUNTRY.    On the 14th we took up a westerly course, and in the first instance  traversed a plain of great extent; the soil of which was for the most part  a red sandy loam, but having patches of light earth upon it. The former  was covered with plants of the chenopedia kind; the latter had evidently  been quagmires, and bore even then the appearance of moisture. At about  seven miles from Mosquito Brush we struck upon a creek of excellent water,  upon which the wild fowl were numerous. Some natives was seen, but they  were only women, and seemed so alarmed that I purposely avoided them. As  the creek was leading northerly, we traced it down on that course for  about seven miles, and then halted upon its banks, which were composed of  a light tenacious earth. Brushes of casuarina existed near it, but a  tortuous box was the prevailing tree, which, excepting for the knees of  small vessels, could not have been applied to any use, while the  flooded-gum had entirely disappeared. Some ducks were shot in the  afternoon, which proved a great treat, as we had been living for some time  on salt provisions. Our animals fared worse than ourselves, as the bed of  the creek was occupied by coarse rushes, and but little vegetation was  elsewhere to be seen. I here killed a beautiful snake, of about four feet  in length, and of a bright yellow colour: I had not, however, the means of  preserving it. Fraser collected numerous botanical specimens, and among  them two kinds of caparis. Indeed a great alteration had taken place in  the minor shrubs, and few of those now prevalent had been observed to the  eastward of the marshes.    From the creek, which both I and Mr. Hume must have crossed on our  respective journeys, we held a westerly course for about fifteen miles,  through a country of alternate plain and brush, the latter predominating,  and in its general character differing but little from that we had  traversed the day previous.    The acacia pendula still continued to exist on the plains backed by dark  rows of cypresses (Cupressus callitris). In the brushes, box and  casuarina (Casuarina tortuosa), with several other kinds of eucalypti,  prevailed; but none of them were sufficiently large to be of use. The  plains were so extremely level that a meridian altitude could have been  taken without any material error; and I doubt much whether it would have  been possible to have traversed them had the season been wet.    HUNTING PARTY OF NATIVES.    As we were travelling through a forest we surprised a hunting party of  natives. Mr. Hume and I were considerably in front of our party at the  time, and he only had his gun with him. We had been moving along so  quietly that we were not for some time observed by them. Three were seated  on the ground, under a tree, and two others were busily employed on one of  the lower branches cutting out honey. As soon as they saw us, four of them  ran away; but the fifth, who wore a cap of emu feathers, stood for a  moment looking at us, and then very deliberately dropped out of the tree  to the ground. I then advanced towards him, but before I got round a bush  that intervened, he had darted away. I was fearful that he was gone to  collect his tribe, and, under this impression, rode quickly back for my  gun to support Mr. Hume. On my arrival I found the native was before me.  He stood about twenty paces from Mr. Hume, who was endeavouring to explain  what he was; but seeing me approach he immediately poised his spear at  him, as being the nearest. Mr. Hume then unslung his carbine, and  presented it; but, as it was evident my re-appearance had startled the  savage, I pulled up; and he immediately lowered his weapon. His coolness  and courage surprised me, and increased my desire to communicate with him.  He had evidently taken both man and horse for one animal, and as long as  Mr. Hume kept his seat, the native remained upon his guard; but when he  saw him dismount, after the first astonishment had subsided, he stuck his  spear into the ground, and walked fearlessly up to him. We easily made him  comprehend that we were in search of water; when he pointed to the west,  as indicating that we should supply our wants there. He gave his  information in a frank and manly way, without the least embarrassment,  and when the party passed, he stepped back to avoid the animals, without  the smallest confusion. I am sure he was a very brave man; and I left him  with the most favourable impressions, and not without hope that he would  follow us.    From a more open forest, we entered a dense scrub, the soil in which was  of a bright-red colour and extremely sandy, and the timber of various  kinds. A leafless species of stenochylus aphylta, which, from the  resemblance, I at first thought one of the polygonum tribe, was very  abundant in the open spaces, and the young cypresses were occasionally so  close as to turn us from the direction in which we had been moving. In the  scrub we crossed Mr. Hume's tract, and, from the appearance of the ground,  I was led to believe mine could not be very distant.    FATE OF THE MACQUARIE.    We struck upon a creek late in the afternoon, at which we stopped; New  Year's Range bearing nearly due west at about four miles' distance. Had we  struck upon my track, the question about which we were so anxious would  still have been undecided; but the circumstance of our having crossed Mr.  Hume's, which, from its direction, could not be mistaken, convinced me of  the fate of the Macquarie, and I felt assured that, whatever channels it  might have for the distribution of its waters, to the north of our line of  route, the equality of surface of the interior would never permit it  again to form a river; and that it only required an examination of the  lower parts of the marshes to confirm the theory of the ultimate  evaporation and absorption of its waters, instead of their contributing to  the permanence of an inland sea, as Mr. Oxley had supposed.    NEW YEAR'S RANGE.    On the 17th of January we encamped under New Year's Range, which is the  first elevation in the interior of Eastern Australia to the westward of  Mount Harris. Yet when at its base, I do not think that we had ascended  above forty feet higher than the plains in the neighbourhood of that last  mentioned eminence. There certainly is a partial rise of country, where  the change of soil takes place from the alluvial deposits of the marshes,  to the sandy loam so prevalent on the plains we had lately traversed; but  I had to regret that I was unable to decide so interesting a question by  other than bare conjecture.    Notwithstanding that Mr. Hume had already been on them, I encouraged hopes  that a second survey of the country from the highest point of New Year's  Range would enable us to form some opinion of it, by which to direct our  future movements; but I was disappointed.    The two wooded hills I had seen from Oxley's Table Land were visible from  the range, bearing south; and other eminences bore by compass S.W.  and W. by S.; but in every other direction the horizon was unbroken. To  the westward, there appeared to be a valley of considerable extent,  stretching N. and S., in which latter direction there was a long strip of  cleared ground, that looked very like the sandy bed of a broad and rapid  river. The bare possibility of the reality determined me to ascertain by  inspection, whether my conjecture was right, and Mr. Hume accompanied me  on this excursion. After we left the camp we crossed a part of the range,  and travelled for some time through open forest land that would afford  excellent grazing in most seasons. We passed some hollows, and noticed  many huts that had been occupied near them; but the hollows were now quite  dry, and the huts had been long deserted. After about ten miles' ride we  reached a plain of white sand, from which New Year's Range was distinctly  visible; and this no doubt was the spot that had attracted my attention.  Pools of water continued on it, from which circumstance it would appear  that the sand had a substratum of clay or marl. From this plain we  proceeded southerly through acacia scrub, bounding gently undulating  forest land, and at length ascended some small elevations that scarcely  deserved the name of hills. They had fragments of quartz profusely  scattered over them; and the soil, which was sandy, contained particles of  mica.    MOSQUITOES.    The view from them was confused, nor did any fresh object meet our  observation. We had, however, considerably neared the two wooded hills,  and the elevations that from the range were to the S.W., now bore N.W.  of us. We had wandered too far from the camp to admit of our returning to  it to sleep; we therefore commenced a search for water, and having found  some, we tethered our horses near it for the night, and should have been  "]]]
