Washington City, Corner Missouri And 3rd Sts.        December 5th, 1839.        Dear Brother Hyrum, President, and to the Honorable High Council      of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--to whom be      fellowship, love, and the peace of Almighty God extended, and the      prayer of faith forever and ever. Amen.        Your fellow laborers, Joseph Smith, Jun., Elias Higbee, and agents      as well as the servants that are sent by you, to perform one of      the most {40} arduous and responsible duties, and also to labor      in the most honorable cause that ever graced the pages of human      existence, respectfully show by these lines, that we have taken up      our cross thus far, and that we arrived in this city on the morning      of the 28th November, and spent the most of that day in looking up      a boarding house, which we succeeded in finding. We found as cheap      boarding as can be had in this city.        On Friday morning, 29th, we proceeded to the house of the      President. We found a very large and splendid palace, surrounded      with a splendid enclosure, decorated with all the fineries and      elegancies of this world. We went to the door and requested to see      the President, when we were immediately introduced into an upper      apartment, where we met the President, and were introduced into his      parlor, where we presented him with our letters of introduction.      As soon as he had read one of them, he looked upon us with a half      frown, and said, \"What can I do? I can do nothing for you! If I do      anything, I shall come in contact with the whole state of Missouri.\"        But we were not to be intimidated; and demanded a hearing, and      constitutional rights. Before we left him he promised to reconsider      what he had said, and observed that he felt to sympathize with us,      on account of our sufferings.        We have spent the remainder of our time in hunting up the      Representatives in order to get our case brought before the House;      in giving them letters of introduction, etc., and in getting      acquainted. A meeting of the delegation of the state of Illinois      was appointed today, to consult for bringing our case before      Congress. The gentlemen from Illinois are worthy men, and have      treated us with the greatest kindness, and are ready to do all that      is in their power; but you are aware, brethren, that they with us      have all the prejudices, superstition, and bigotry of an ignorant      generation to contend with; nevertheless we believe our case will      be brought before the House, and we will leave the event with God;      He is our Judge, and the Avenger of our wrongs.        For a general thing there is but little solidity and honorable      deportment among those who are sent here to represent the people;      but a great deal of pomposity and show.        We left President Rigdon and others on the road, and received a      letter from them this day. They were, at the date of the letter, on      the 20th of November, near Washington, in Pennsylvania, expecting      to stop a day or two at his brother's on account of his ill health.      He has occasionally a chill yet, but his illness is not dangerous.      We expect him here soon.        We have already commenced forming some very honorable      acquaintances, and have thus far been prospered as much as we had      anticipated, if not more. We have had a pleasing interview with      Judge Young, who {41} proposed to furnish us with expense money.      We can draw on him for funds to publish our book, and we want you      to raise some more money for us, and deposit it in the Branch Bank      in Quincy, to be drawn to the order of Judge Young. Send us the      amount of your deposit, taking a receipt of the same. You need not      be afraid to do this. We think from the proceeds of the sale of      books, we can make it all straight. Do therefore be punctual, as      much depends upon it. We cannot accomplish the things for which      we were sent without some funds. You very well know, brethren, we      were contented to start, trusting in God, with little or nothing.      We have met with but one accident since we started. The lock of      our trunk was broken off, and Brother Lyman Wight's petition is      missing; but we trust there is a copy of it preserved; if there is,      you will please forward it immediately, with the name and affidavit      to it.        For God's sake, brethren, be wide awake, and arm us with all the      power possible, for now is the time or never. We want you should      get all the influential men you can of that section of country, of      Iowa, and of every other quarter, to write letters to the members      of Congress, using their influence in our behalf, and to keep their      minds constantly upon the subject.        Please to forward this to our wives.        Yours in the bonds of the Everlasting Covenant,        Joseph Smith, Jun.,        Elias Higbee.        P. S.--Congress has been in session for four days, and the House      of Representatives is not yet organized, in consequence of some      seats being contested in the New Jersey delegation. They have this      day succeeded in electing John Q. Adams to the chair _pro tem_.;      but whether they will get their Speaker and Clerk chosen is yet      unknown, as there is a great deal of wind blown off on the occasion      on each day. There is such an itching disposition to display their      oratory on the most trivial occasions, and so much etiquette,      bowing and scraping, twisting and turning, to make a display of      their witticism, that it seems to us rather a display of folly and      show, more than substance and gravity, such as becomes a great      nation like ours. (However there are some exceptions).        A warm feeling has been manifested in the discussion of the House      today, and it seems as much confusion as though the nation had      already began to be vexed. We came with one of the Missouri members      from Wheeling to this place, who was drunk but once, and that      however was most of the time; there was but one day but what he      could navigate, and that day he was keeled over, so he could eat no      dinner. The horses ran away with the stage; they ran about three      miles; {42} Brother Joseph climbed out of the stage, got the lines,      and stopped the horses, and also saved the life of a lady and      child. He was highly commended by the whole company for his great      exertions and presence of mind through the whole affair. Elias      Higbee jumped out of the stage at a favorable moment, just before      they stopped, with a view to assist in stopping them, and was but      slightly injured. We were not known to the state company until      after our arrival.        In our interview with the President, he interrogated us wherein      we differed in our religion from the other religions of the day.      Brother Joseph said we differed in mode of baptism, and the gift of      the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands. We considered that all      other considerations were contained in the gift of the Holy Ghost,      and we deemed it unnecessary to make many words in preaching the      Gospel to him. Suffice it to say he has got our testimony. We watch      the post office, but have received no letters from our sections of      the country. Write instantly.        Yours with respect,        J. S. Jun.,        E. H.    [Sidenote: Affairs in Iowa.]    _Tuesday, 3_.--High Council of Iowa met at Elijah Fordham's and voted  to come up to the law of tithing, so far as circumstances would permit,  for the benefit of the poor, and that Alanson Ripley remove to Iowa;  and he was ordained Bishop by the Presidency of the Council.    Elder Daniel Avery was instructed to call the Elders together and  organize the Elder's Quorum.    _Saturday, 7_.--The President of the High Council of Iowa proposed the  following questions--Have the brethren a right to exact the payment  of debts which were due them from others, and were consecrated to the  Bishop in the state of Missouri? Six counselors spoke. The President  decided that all such debts ought not to be called for, and that  persons making such demands shall be disfellowshiped by the Church;  which was approved by the Council.

Smith and Hyrum Smith were the committee appointed to wait upon      emigrants and settle them.    _Tuesday, 21_.--I attended a large assembly of the Saints, at the stand  near the Temple, and addressed them on the subject of agriculture,  manufacture, and trade, and was followed by the Twelve and others on  the same subject.    _Wednesday, 22_.--There was a special session of the city council held,  when was passed \"an ordinance repealing all ordinances and resolutions  relative to the changing of the names of streets\" in the city of Nauvoo.    _Thursday, 23_.--I published the following:    _An Address to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and  to all the Honorable Part of the Community_.        It becomes my duty to lay before the Church of Jesus Christ of      Latter-day Saints and the public generally, some important facts      relative to the conduct and character of Dr. John C. Bennett,      who has lately been expelled from the aforesaid Church and the      honorable part of the community may be aware of his proceedings,      and be ready to treat him, and regard him as he ought to be      regarded, viz., as an impostor and base adulterer.        It is a matter of notoriety that the said Dr. John C. Bennett      became favorable to the doctrines taught by the Elders of the      Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and located himself      in the city of Nauvoo, about the month of August, 1840, and soon      after joined the Church. {36} Soon after it was known that he had      become a member of said Church, a communication was received at      Nauvoo from a person of respectable character and residing in the      vicinity where Bennett had lived. This letter cautioned us against      him, setting forth that he was a very mean man, and had a wife and      two or three children in McConnellsvill, Morgan county, Ohio; but      knowing that it is no uncommon thing for good men to be evil spoken      against, the above letter was kept quiet, but held in reserve.        He had not been long in Nauvoo before he began to keep company      with a young lady, one of our citizens; and she, being ignorant of      his having a wife living, gave way to his addresses, and became      confident from his behavior towards her, that he intended to marry      her and this he gave her to understand he would do. I, seeing the      folly of such an acquaintance, persuaded him to desist, and on      account of his continuing his course, finally threatened to expose      him if he did not desist. This, to outward appearance, had the      desired effect, and the acquaintance between them was broken off.        But, like one of the most abominable and depraved beings which      could possibly exist, he only broke off his publicly wicked actions      to sink deeper into iniquity and hypocrisy. When he saw that I      would not submit to any such conduct, he went to some of the      females in the city who knew nothing of him but as an honorable      man, and began to teach them that promiscuous intercourse between      the sexes was a doctrine believed in by the Latter-day Saints, and      that there was no harm in it, but this failing, he had recourse      to a more influential and desperately wicked course, and that was      to persuade them that myself and others of the authorities of the      Church, not only sanctioned but practiced the same wicked acts, and      when asked why I publicly preached so much against it, said that      it was because of the prejudice of the public, and that it would      cause trouble in my own house. He was well aware of the consequence      of such wilful and base falsehoods, if they should come to my      knowledge, and consequently endeavored to persuade his dupes to      keep it a matter of secrecy, persuading them there would be no harm      if they did not make it known. This proceeding on his part answered      the desired end; he accomplished his wicked purposes; he seduced an      innocent female by his lying, and subjected her character to public      disgrace, should it ever be known.        But his depraved heart would not suffer him to stop here. Not being      contented with having disgraced one female, he made an attempt      upon others; and by the same plausible tale overcame them also,      evidently not caring whose character was ruined, so that his      wicked, lustful appetites might be gratified.        Some time, about the early part of July, 1841, I received a letter      {37} from Elders Hyrum Smith and William Law, who were then in      Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This letter was dated June 15th, and      contained the particulars of a conversation betwixt them and a      respectable gentleman from the neighborhood where Bennett's wife      and children resided. He stated to them that it was a fact that      Bennett had a wife and children living, and that she had left      him because of his ill treatment toward her. This letter was      read to Bennett, which he did not attempt to deny, but candidly      acknowledged the fact.        Soon after this information reached our ears, Dr. Bennett made an      attempt at suicide by taking poison, but he being discovered before      it took effect, and the proper antidote being administered, he      recovered; but he very much resisted when an attempt was made to      save him. The public impression was that he was so much ashamed of      his base and wicked conduct, that he had recourse to the above deed      to escape the censures of an indignant community.        It might have been supposed that these circumstances, transpiring      in the manner they did, would have produced a thorough reformation      in his conduct; but, alas! like a being totally destitute of common      decency, and without any government over his passions, he was soon      busily engaged in the same wicked career, and continued until a      knowledge of the same reached my ears. I immediately charged him      with it, and he admitted that it was true; but in order to put a      stop to all such proceedings for the future, I publicly proclaimed      against it, and had those females notified to appear before the      proper officers, that the whole subject might be investigated and      thoroughly exposed.        During the course of investigation, the foregoing facts were proved      by credible witnesses, and were sworn and subscribed to before an      alderman of the city, on the 15th ultimo. The documents containing      the evidence are now in my possession.        We also ascertained by the above investigation that others had been      led by his conduct to pursue the same adulterous practice, and in      order to accomplish their detestable designs made use of the same      language insinuated by Bennett, with this difference, that they did      not hear me say anything of the kind, but Bennett was one of the      heads of the Church, and he had informed them that such was the      fact and they credited his testimony.        The public will perceive the aggravating nature of this case, and      will see the propriety of this exposure. Had he only been guilty of      adultery, that was sufficient to stamp disgrace upon him, because      he is a man of better information, and has been held high in the      estimation of many. But, when it is considered that his mind was so      intent upon his cruel and abominable deeds, and his own reputation      not being sufficient to enable him to do it, he must needs make use      of my name in {38} order to effect his purposes, an enlightened      public will not be astonished at the course I have pursued.        In order that it may be distinctly understood that he willfully      and knowingly lied in the above insinuations, I will lay before my      readers an affidavit taken before an alderman of the city, after I      had charged him with these things:--        State of Illinois,        City of Nauvoo.        Personally appeared before me, Daniel H. Wells, an alderman of said      city of Nauvoo, John C. Bennett, who being duly sworn according      to law, deposeth and saith,--that he never was taught anything in      the least contrary to the strictest principles of the Gospel, or      of virtue, or of the laws of God or man, under any circumstances,      or upon any occasion, either directly or indirectly, in word or      deed, by Joseph Smith, and that he never knew the said Smith to      countenance any improper conduct whatever, either in public or      private; and that he never did teach me in private that an illegal,      illicit intercourse with females was, under any circumstances      justifiable, and that I never knew him so to teach others.        JOHN C. BENNETT.        Sworn to, and subscribed before me, this 17th day of May, A. D.      1842.        DANIEL H. WELLS, Alderman.        The following conversation took place in the City Council, and      was elicited in consequence of its being reported that the doctor      had stated that I had acted in an indecorous manner, and given      countenance to vices practiced by the doctor and others:--        Dr. John C. Bennett, ex-mayor, was then called upon by the mayor      to state if he knew aught against him [i.e., Joseph Smith], when      Mr. Bennett replied: I know what I am about, and the heads of the      Church know what they are about, I expect. I have no difficulty      with the heads of the Church. I publicly avow that any one who      has said that I have stated that General Joseph Smith has given      me authority to hold illicit intercourse with women, is a liar in      the face of God; those who have said it are damned liars; they are      infernal liars. He never, either in public or private, gave me      any such authority or license, and any person who states it, is      a scoundrel and a liar. I have heard it said that I would become      a second Avard by withdrawing from the Church,"]]]
