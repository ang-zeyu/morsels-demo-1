Go.\"  Thus spoke Issus, and  the heavy hand of the officer fell upon my shoulder.  In accordance  with his instructions I dropped to my hands and knees once more and  crawled from the Presence.  It had been my first audience with deity,  but I am free to confess that I was not greatly impressed--other than  with the ridiculous figure I cut scrambling about on my marrow bones.    Once without the chamber the doors closed behind us and I was bid to  rise.  Xodar joined me and together we slowly retraced our steps toward  the gardens.    \"You spared my life when you easily might have taken it,\" he said after  we had proceeded some little way in silence, \"and I would aid you if I  might.  I can help to make your life here more bearable, but your fate  is inevitable.  You may never hope to return to the outer world.\"    \"What will be my fate?\" I asked.    \"That will depend largely upon Issus.  So long as she does not send for  you and reveal her face to you, you may live on for years in as mild a  form of bondage as I can arrange for you.\"    \"Why should she send for me?\" I asked.    \"The men of the lower orders she often uses for various purposes of  amusement.  Such a fighter as you, for example, would render fine sport  in the monthly rites of the temple.  There are men pitted against men,  and against beasts for the edification of Issus and the replenishment  of her larder.\"    \"She eats human flesh?\" I asked.  Not in horror, however, for since my  recently acquired knowledge of the Holy Therns I was prepared for  anything in this still less accessible heaven, where all was evidently  dictated by a single omnipotence; where ages of narrow fanaticism and  self-worship had eradicated all the broader humanitarian instincts that  the race might once have possessed.    They were a people drunk with power and success, looking upon the other  inhabitants of Mars as we look upon the beasts of the field and the  forest.  Why then should they not eat of the flesh of the lower orders  whose lives and characters they no more understood than do we the  inmost thoughts and sensibilities of the cattle we slaughter for our  earthly tables.    \"She eats only the flesh of the best bred of the Holy Therns and the  red Barsoomians.  The flesh of the others goes to our boards.  The  animals are eaten by the slaves.  She also eats other dainties.\"    I did not understand then that there lay any special significance in  his reference to other dainties.  I thought the limit of ghoulishness  already had been reached in the recitation of Issus' menu.  I still had  much to learn as to the depths of cruelty and bestiality to which  omnipotence may drag its possessor.    We had about reached the last of the many chambers and corridors which  led to the gardens when an officer overtook us.    \"Issus would look again upon this man,\" he said.  \"The girl has told  her that he is of wondrous beauty and of such prowess that alone he  slew seven of the First Born, and with his bare hands took Xodar  captive, binding him with his own harness.\"    Xodar looked uncomfortable.  Evidently he did not relish the thought  that Issus had learned of his inglorious defeat.    Without a word he turned and we followed the officer once again to the  closed doors before the audience chamber of Issus, Goddess of Life  Eternal.    Here the ceremony of entrance was repeated.  Again Issus bid me rise.  For several minutes all was silent as the tomb.  The eyes of deity were  appraising me.    Presently the thin wavering voice broke the stillness, repeating in a  singsong drone the words which for countless ages had sealed the doom  of numberless victims.    \"Let the man turn and look upon Issus, knowing that those of the lower  orders who gaze upon the holy vision of her radiant face survive the  blinding glory but a single year.\"    I turned as I had been bid, expecting such a treat as only the  revealment of divine glory to mortal eyes might produce.  What I saw  was a solid phalanx of armed men between myself and a dais supporting a  great bench of carved sorapus wood.  On this bench, or throne, squatted  a female black.  She was evidently very old.  Not a hair remained upon  her wrinkled skull.  With the exception of two yellow fangs she was  entirely toothless.  On either side of her thin, hawk-like nose her  eyes burned from the depths of horribly sunken sockets.  The skin of  her face was seamed and creased with a million deepcut furrows.  Her  body was as wrinkled as her face, and as repulsive.    Emaciated arms and legs attached to a torso which seemed to be mostly  distorted abdomen completed the \"holy vision of her radiant beauty.\"    Surrounding her were a number of female slaves, among them Phaidor,  white and trembling.    \"This is the man who slew seven of the First Born and, bare-handed,  bound Dator Xodar with his own harness?\" asked Issus.    \"Most glorious vision of divine loveliness, it is,\" replied the officer  who stood at my side.    \"Produce Dator Xodar,\" she commanded.    Xodar was brought from the adjoining room.    Issus glared at him, a baleful light in her hideous eyes.    \"And such as you are a Dator of the First Born?\" she squealed.  \"For  the disgrace you have brought upon the Immortal Race you shall be  degraded to a rank below the lowest.  No longer be you a Dator, but for  evermore a slave of slaves, to fetch and carry for the lower orders  that serve in the gardens of Issus.  Remove his harness.  Cowards and  slaves wear no trappings.\"    Xodar stood stiffly erect.  Not a muscle twitched, nor a tremor shook  his giant frame as a soldier of the guard roughly stripped his gorgeous  trappings from him.    \"Begone,\" screamed the infuriated little old woman.  \"Begone, but  instead of the light of the gardens of Issus let you serve as a slave  of this slave who conquered you in the prison on the Isle of Shador in  the Sea of Omean.  Take him away out of the sight of my divine eyes.\"    Slowly and with high held head the proud Xodar turned and stalked from  the chamber.  Issus rose and turned to leave the room by another exit.    Turning to me, she said: \"You shall be returned to Shador for the  present.  Later Issus will see the manner of your fighting.  Go.\" Then  she disappeared, followed by her retinue.  Only Phaidor lagged behind,  and as I started to follow my guard toward the gardens, the girl came  running after me.    \"Oh, do not leave me in this terrible place,\" she begged.  \"Forgive the  things I said to you, my Prince.  I did not mean them.  Only take me  away with you.  Let me share your imprisonment on Shador.\" Her words  were an almost incoherent volley of thoughts, so rapidly she spoke.  \"You did not understand the honour that I did you.  Among the therns  there is no marriage or giving in marriage, as among the lower orders  of the outer world.  We might have lived together for ever in love and  happiness.  We have both looked upon Issus and in a year we die.  Let  us live that year at least together in what measure of joy remains for  the doomed.\"    \"If it was difficult for me to understand you, Phaidor,\" I replied,  \"can you not understand that possibly it is equally difficult for you  to understand the motives, the customs and the social laws that guide  me?  I do not wish to hurt you, nor to seem to undervalue the honour  which you have done me, but the thing you desire may not be.  Regardless of the foolish belief of the peoples of the outer world, or  of Holy Thern, or ebon First Born, I am not dead.  While I live my  heart beats for but one woman--the incomparable Dejah Thoris, Princess  of Helium.  When death overtakes me my heart shall have ceased to beat;  but what comes after that I know not.  And in that I am as wise as  Matai Shang, Master of Life and Death upon Barsoom; or Issus, Goddess  of Life Eternal.\"    Phaidor stood looking at me intently for a moment.  No anger showed in  her eyes this time, only a pathetic expression of hopeless sorrow.    \"I do not understand,\" she said, and turning walked slowly in the  direction of the door through which Issus and her retinue had passed.  A moment later she had passed from my sight.          CHAPTER X    THE PRISON ISLE OF SHADOR      In the outer gardens to which the guard now escorted me, I found Xodar  surrounded by a crowd of noble blacks.  They were reviling and cursing  him.  The men slapped his face.  The women spat upon him.    When I appeared they turned their attentions toward me.    \"Ah,\" cried one, \"so this is the creature who overcame the great Xodar  bare-handed.  Let us see how it was done.\"    \"Let him bind Thurid,\" suggested a beautiful woman, laughing.  \"Thurid  is a noble Dator.  Let Thurid show the dog what it means to face a real  man.\"    \"Yes, Thurid!  Thurid!\" cried a dozen voices.    \"Here he is now,\" exclaimed another, and turning in the direction  indicated I saw a huge black weighed down with resplendent ornaments  and arms advancing with noble and gallant bearing toward us.    \"What now?\" he cried.  \"What would you of Thurid?\"    Quickly a dozen voices explained.    Thurid turned toward Xodar, his eyes narrowing to two nasty slits.    \"Calot!\" he hissed.  \"Ever did I think you carried the heart of a sorak  in your putrid breast.  Often have you bested me in the secret councils  of Issus, but now in the field of war where men are truly gauged your  scabby heart hath revealed its sores to all the world.  Calot, I spurn  you with my foot,\" and with the words he turned to kick Xodar.    My blood was up.  For minutes it had been boiling at the cowardly  treatment they had been according this once powerful comrade because he  had fallen from the favour of Issus.  I had no love for Xodar, but I  cannot stand the sight of cowardly injustice and persecution without  seeing red as through a haze of bloody mist, and doing things on the  impulse of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6422"],[0,"The Life, Adventures & Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton (#20)"],[1," this  desert, without some covering for us at night; so he advised us to march  back again to a little river-side where we lay the night before, and  stay there till we could make us houses, as he called them, to carry  with us to lodge in every night. As he began a little to understand our  speech, and we very well to understand his signs, we easily knew what he  meant, and that we should there make mats (for we remembered that we saw  a great deal of matting or bass there, that the natives make mats of)--I  say, that we should make large mats there for covering our huts or tents  to lodge in at night.    We all approved this advice, and immediately resolved to go back that  one day's journey, resolving, though we carried less provisions, we  would carry mats with us to cover us in the night. Some of the nimblest  of us got back to the river with more ease than we had travelled it the  day before; but, as we were not in haste, the rest made a halt, encamped  another night, and came to us the next day.    In our return of this day's journey, our men that made two days of  it met with a very surprising thing, that gave them some reason to be  careful how they parted company again. The case was this:--The second  day in the morning, before they had gone half a mile, looking behind  them they saw a vast cloud of sand or dust rise in the air, as we see  sometimes in the roads in summer when it is very dusty and a large drove  of cattle are coming, only very much greater; and they could easily  perceive that it came after them; and it came on faster as they went  from it. The cloud of sand was so great that they could not see what it  was that raised it, and concluded that it was some army of enemies  that pursued them; but then considering that they came from the vast  uninhabited wilderness, they knew it was impossible any nation or people  that way should have intelligence of them or the way of their march;  and therefore, if it was an army, it must be of such as they were,  travelling that way by accident. On the other hand, as they knew that  there were no horses in the country, and that they came on so fast, they  concluded that it must be some vast collection of wild beasts, perhaps  making to the hill country for food or water, and that they should be  all devoured or trampled under foot by their multitude.    Upon this thought, they very prudently observed which way the cloud  seemed to point, and they turned a little out of their way to the north,  supposing it might pass by them. When they were about a quarter of a  mile, they halted to see what it might be. One of the negroes, a nimbler  fellow than the rest, went back a little, and came in a few minutes  running as fast as the heavy sands would allow, and by signs gave them  to know that it was a great herd, or drove, or whatever it might be  called, of vast monstrous elephants.    As it was a sight our men had never seen, they were desirous to see it,  and yet a little uneasy at the danger too; for though an elephant is a  heavy unwieldy creature, yet in the deep sand, which is nothing at all  to them, they marched at a great rate, and would soon have tired our  people, if they had had far to go, and had been pursued by them.    Our gunner was with them, and had a great mind to have gone close up to  one of the outermost of them, and to have clapped his piece to his  ear, and to have fired into him, because he had been told no shot would  penetrate them; but they all dissuaded him, lest upon the noise they  should all turn upon and pursue us; so he was reasoned out of it, and  let them pass, which, in our people's circumstances, was certainly the  right way.    They were between twenty and thirty in number, but prodigious great  ones; and though they often showed our men that they saw them, yet they  did not turn out of their way, or take any other notice of them than, as  we might say, just to look at them. We that were before saw the cloud of  dust they raised, but we had thought it had been our own caravan, and so  took no notice; but as they bent their course one point of the compass,  or thereabouts, to the southward of the east, and we went due east [?  west], they passed by us at some little distance; so that we did not see  them, or know anything of them, till evening, when our men came to us  and gave us this account of them. However, this was a useful experiment  for our future conduct in passing the desert, as you shall hear in its  place.    We were now upon our work, and our black prince was head surveyor, for  he was an excellent mat-maker himself, and all his men understood it, so  that they soon made us near a hundred mats; and as every man, I mean of  the negroes, carried one, it was no manner of load, and we did not carry  an ounce of provisions the less. The greatest burthen was to carry  six long poles, besides some shorter stakes; but the negroes made an  advantage of that, for carrying them between two, they made the luggage  of provisions which they had to carry so much the lighter, binding it  upon two poles, and so made three couple of them. As soon as we saw  this, we made a little advantage of it too; for having three or four  bags, called bottles (I mean skins to carry water), more than the men  could carry, we got them filled, and carried them this way, which was a  day's water and more, for our journey.    Having now ended our work, made our mats, and fully recruited our stores  of all things necessary, and having made us abundance of small ropes  of matting for ordinary use, as we might have occasion, we set forward  again, having interrupted our journey eight days in all, upon this  affair. To our great comfort, the night before we set out there fell a  very violent shower of rain, the effects of which we found in the sand;  though the heat of one day dried the surface as much as before, yet it  was harder at bottom, not so heavy, and was cooler to our feet, by which  means we marched, as we reckoned, about fourteen miles instead of seven,  and with much more ease.    When we came to encamp, we had all things ready, for we had fitted our  tent, and set it up for trial, where we made it; so that, in less than  an hour, we had a large tent raised, with an inner and outer apartment,  and two entrances. In one we lay ourselves, in the other our negroes,  having light pleasant mats over us, and others at the same time under  us. Also we had a little place without all for our buffaloes, for they  deserved our care, being very useful to us, besides carrying forage and  water for themselves. Their forage was a root, which our black  prince directed us to find, not much unlike a parsnip, very moist and  nourishing, of which there was plenty wherever we came, this horrid  desert excepted.    When we came the next morning to decamp, our negroes took down the tent,  and pulled up the stakes; and all was in motion in as little time as it  was set up. In this posture we marched eight days, and yet could see no  end, no change of our prospect, but all looking as wild and dismal as  at the beginning. If there was any alteration, it was that the sand  was nowhere so deep and heavy as it was the first three days. This we  thought might be because, for six months of the year the winds blowing  west (as for the other six they blow constantly east), the sand was  driven violently to the side of the desert where we set out, where the  mountains lying very high, the easterly monsoons, when they blew, had  not the same power to drive it back again; and this was confirmed by our  finding the like depth of sand on the farthest extent of the desert to  the west.    It was the ninth day of our travel in this wilderness, when we came  to the view of a great lake of water; and you may be sure this was a  particular satisfaction to us, because we had not water left for above  two or three days more, at our shortest allowance; I mean allowing water  for our return, if we had been driven to the necessity of it. Our water  had served us two days longer than expected, our buffaloes having found,  for two or three days, a kind of herb like a broad flat thistle, though  without any prickle, spreading on the ground, and growing in the sand,  which they ate freely of, and which supplied them for drink as well as  forage.    The next day, which was the tenth from our setting out, we came to the  edge of this lake, and, very happily for us, we came to it at the south  point of it, for to the north we could see no end of it; so we passed by  it and travelled three days by the side of it, which was a great comfort  to us, because it lightened our burthen, there being no need to carry  water when we had it in view. And yet, though here was so much water,  we found but very little alteration in the desert; no trees, no grass  or herbage, except that thistle, as I called it, and two or three more  plants, which we did not understand, of which the desert began to be  pretty full.    But as we were refreshed with the neighbourhood of this lake of water,  so we were now gotten among a prodigious number of ravenous inhabitants,  the like whereof, it is most certain, the eye of man never saw; for as  I firmly believe that never man nor body of men passed this desert since  the flood, so I believe there is not the like collection of fierce,  ravenous, and devouring creatures in the world; I mean not in any  particular place.    For a day's journey before we came to this lake, and all the three days  we were passing by it, and for six or seven days' march after it,  the ground was scattered with elephants' teeth in such a number as is  incredible; and as some of them have lain there for some hundreds of  years, so, seeing the substance of them scarce ever decays, they may lie  there, for aught I know, to the end of time. The size of some of them  is, it seems, to those to whom I have reported it, as incredible as  the number; and I can assure you there were several"]]]
