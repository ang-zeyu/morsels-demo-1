Finally, content-based restrictions on speech in a  designated public forum are most clearly subject to strict  scrutiny when the government opens a forum for virtually  unrestricted use by the general public for speech on a virtually  unrestricted range of topics, while selectively excluding  particular speech whose content it disfavors.  Thus, in Conrad,  the Court held that a local government violated the First  Amendment when it denied a group seeking to perform the rock  musical \"Hair\" access to a general-purpose municipal theater open  for the public at large to use for performances.  See also  Denver, 518 U.S. at 802 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment)  (suggesting that strict scrutiny would not apply to a local  government's decision to \"build[] a band shell in the park and  dedicate[] it solely to classical music (but not jazz),\" but  would apply to \"the Government's creation of a band shell in  which all types of music might be performed except for rap  music\").  Similarly, in FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468  U.S. 364 (1984), the Court subjected to heightened scrutiny a  federal program that funded a wide range of public broadcasting  stations that disseminated speech on a wide range of subjects,  where the federal program singled out for exclusion speech whose  content amounted to editorializing.  As the Court later  explained:  In FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364  (1984) the Court was instructed by its understanding of the  dynamics of the broadcast industry in holding that  prohibitions against editorializing by public radio networks  were an impermissible restriction, even though the  Government enacted the restriction to control the use of  public funds.  The First Amendment forbade the Government  from using the forum in an unconventional way to suppress  speech inherent in the nature of the medium.    Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 543.      In sum, the more widely the state opens a forum for members  of the public to speak on a variety of subjects and viewpoints,  the more vulnerable is the state's decision selectively to  exclude certain speech on the basis of its disfavored content, as  such exclusions distort the marketplace of ideas that the state  has created in establishing the forum.  Cf. Velazquez, 531 U.S.  at 544 (\"Restricting LSC attorneys in advising their clients and  in presenting arguments and analyses to the courts distorts the  legal system by altering the traditional role of the attorneys in  much the same way broadcast systems or student publication  networks were changed in the limited forum cases . . . .\").  Thus, we believe that where the state designates a forum for  expressive activity and opens the forum for speech by the public  at large on a wide range of topics, strict scrutiny applies to  restrictions that single out for exclusion from the forum  particular speech whose content is disfavored.  \"Laws designed or  intended to suppress or restrict the expression of specific  speakers contradict basic First Amendment principles.\"  United  States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 812 (2000);  see also Denver, 518 U.S. at 782 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the  judgment) (noting the flaw in a law that \"singles out one sort of  speech for vulnerability to private censorship in a context where  content-based discrimination is not otherwise permitted\").  Compare Forbes, 523 U.S. at 679 (holding that the state does not  create a public forum when it \"allows selective access for  individual speakers rather than general access for a class of  speakers\") (emphasis added), with Police Dep't of the City of  Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96 (1972) (\"Selective exclusions  from a public forum may not be based on content alone, and may  not be justified by reference to content alone.\") (emphasis  added).      We note further that to the extent that the government  creates a public forum expressly designed to facilitate the  dissemination of private speech, opens the forum to any member of  the public to speak on any virtually any topic, and then  selectively targets certain speech for exclusion based on its  content, the government is singling out speech in a manner that  resembles the discriminatory taxes on the press that the Supreme  Court subjected to heightened First Amendment scrutiny in  Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221 (1987),  and Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Commissioner of  Revenue, 460 U.S. 575 (1983), which we explain in the margin.  4.        Reasons for Applying Strict Scrutiny    1.        Selective Exclusion From a \"Vast Democratic  Forum\"        Applying these principles to public libraries, we agree with  the government that generally the First Amendment subjects  libraries' content-based decisions about which print materials to  acquire for their collections to only rational review.  In making  these decisions, public libraries are generally free to adopt  collection development criteria that reflect not simply patrons'  demand for certain material, but also the library's evaluation of  the material's quality.  See Bernard W. Bell, Filth, Filtering,  and the First Amendment: Ruminations on Public Libraries' Use of  Internet Filtering Software, 53 Fed. Comm. L.J. 191, 225 (2001)  (\"Librarians should have the discretion to decide that the  library is committed to intellectual inquiry, not to the  satisfaction of the full range of human desires.\").  Thus, a  public library's decision to use the last $100 of its budget to  purchase the complete works of Shakespeare even though more of  its patrons would prefer the library to use the same amount to  purchase the complete works of John Grisham, is not, in our view,  subject to strict scrutiny.  Cf. NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569  (1998) (subjecting only to rational basis review the government's  decision to award NEA grants on the basis of, inter alia,  artistic excellence).  Nonetheless, we disagree with the government's argument that  public libraries' use of Internet filters is no different, for  First Amendment purposes, from the editorial discretion that they  exercise when they choose to acquire certain books on the basis  of librarians' evaluation of their quality.  The central  difference, in our view, is that by providing patrons with even  filtered Internet access, the library permits patrons to receive  speech on a virtually unlimited number of topics, from a  virtually unlimited number of speakers, without attempting to  restrict patrons' access to speech that the library, in the  exercise of its professional judgment, determines to be  particularly valuable.  Cf. Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of  Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 834 (1995) (applying strict scrutiny  to viewpoint-based restrictions where the state \"does not itself  speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead  expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private  speakers\").  See generally supra Section IV.C.      In those cases upholding the government's exercise of  editorial discretion in selecting certain speech for  subsidization or inclusion in a state-created forum, the state  actor exercising the editorial discretion has at least reviewed  the content of the speech that the forum facilitates.  Thus, in  Finley the NEA examined the content of those works of art that it  chose to subsidize, and in Arkansas Educational Television  Commission v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666 (1998), the public broadcaster  specifically reviewed and approved each speaker permitted to  participate in the debate.  See id. at 673 (\"In the case of  television broadcasting, . . . broad rights of access for outside  speakers would be antithetical, as a general rule, to the  discretion that stations and their editorial staff must exercise  to fulfill their journalistic purpose and statutory  obligations.\"); Finley, 524 U.S. at 586 (\"The NEA's mandate is to  make esthetic judgments, and the inherently content-based  'excellence' threshold for NEA support sets it apart from the  subsidy at issue in Rosenberger Â– which was available to all  student organizations that were 'related to the educational  purpose of the University . . . .'\") (quoting Rosenberger, 515  U.S. at 824); see also Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ.  Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 804 (1985) (\"The Government's consistent  policy has been to limit participation in the [Combined Federal  Campaign] to 'appropriate' voluntary agencies and to require  agencies seeking admission to obtain permission from federal and  local Campaign officials. . . .  [T]here is no evidence  suggesting that the granting of the requisite permission is  merely ministerial.\").  The essence of editorial discretion  requires the exercise of professional judgment in examining the  content that the government singles out as speech of particular  value.      This exercise of editorial discretion is evident in a  library's decision to acquire certain books for its collection.  As the government's experts in library science testified, in  selecting a book for a library's collection, librarians evaluate  the book's quality by reference to a variety of criteria such as  its accuracy, the title's niche in relation to the rest of the  collection, the authority of the author, the publisher, the  work's presentation, and how it compares with other material  available in the same genre or on the same subject.  Thus, the  content of every book that a library acquires has been reviewed  by the library's collection development staff or someone to whom  they have delegated the task, and has been judged to meet the  criteria that form the basis for the library's collection  development policy.  Although some public libraries use \"approval  plans\" to delegate the collection development to third-party  vendors which provide the library with recommended materials that  the library is then free to retain or return to the vendor,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51854"],[0,"The Rat Race (#20)"],[1,"ing.\"    \"Okay,\" I agreed. \"I'll come along quietly. Phil, will you tell Miss  Briggs to ring up my wife and say I won't be home tonight and not to  worry. I'll be all right.\"    Harcourt came and laid his hand on my arm. \"Come along then,\" he  ordered gruffly.    \"How about my lawyer?\" I inquired. \"Graham, will you phone Merry Vail  and tell him I've been taken up to the F.B.I. for questioning?\"    Harcourt looked up at me. \"Is Merriwether Vail your lawyer?\" he asked.  \"I wouldn't bother to call him. We've picked him up too. All your  associates, outside of business and--er--pleasure, are being rounded  up. The President's dead, Mr. Tompkins, and you're going to do some  talking to my chief.\"          CHAPTER 15      The events which brought me into the office of Edward Lamb, Deputy  Director of the F.B.I., on Friday the thirteenth, had developed so  rapidly that I could scarcely believe that less than twenty-four hours  had passed since Harcourt had taken me into custody.    We had gone to the Federal Court House in a taxicab (paid for by me)  where I was placed alone in a room for fifteen minutes. At the end of  that period I was informed that Washington had asked that I be sent  down for direct interrogation at the Bureau. I was told that if I  preferred I could demand a formal warrant of arrest but that Mr. Vail,  who had been released with an apology, advised me to go, and that I  could confirm it by telephone--which I did. I was told that there was  still no formal charge against me but they asked if I would let myself  be fingerprinted. To this I agreed and then sat back while arrangements  were completed to fly me down to Washington from the LaGuardia Airport.  Harcourt was to accompany me. That had been all. They allowed me to  phone Germaine and tell her I was going to Washington and invite her to  join me there as soon as I could get hotel accommodations. The F.B.I.  put me up for the night in one of their Manhattan hide-outs--an old  house on East 80th Street--and in the morning Harcourt and I had taken  the plane. The clock had barely touched noon when I was told that Mr.  Lamb was ready to see me.    Lamb was a pleasant, youngish man--with that inevitable faint Hoover  chubbiness--whose roomy office with its deep leather easy chairs  spelled power in the F.B.I. I was amused to note that he followed Rule  1 of whistle-stop detection, by seating me in a deep chair, facing the  light, while he sat at his desk on a definitely higher level and with  the light behind him.    \"Well, Mr. Tompkins,\" he began, \"we've had disturbing reports about you  from at least three different sources. Frankly, we still don't know  what to make of them and the Director thought it would be better if you  came here and talked to us.\"    \"Always glad to help,\" I assured him. \"If you'll tell me what the  reports are, I'll try to explain.\"    Lamb glanced at a file of papers on his desk. \"The first one is an  allegation that you aren't Winfred S. Tompkins, but an imposter who has  kidnapped Tompkins and taken his place. That report was anonymous and  we don't attach any particular importance to it, although if necessary  we could use it to detain you for questioning under the Lindbergh Law.\"    I stretched out my hands toward him. \"My fingerprints were taken last  night,\" I said. \"They ought to settle that question.\"    Lamb laughed. \"Unfortunately,\" he admitted, \"it takes a little time to  establish identity by fingerprints. The first tentative identification  suggested by yours was a man named Jonas Lee. He is a Negro currently  employed in the Charleston Navy Yard. However, I think we can assume  that the final identification will bear you out. They're working on it  now.\"    There was a buzz and he picked up the desk-telephone. \"Oh, they do,\" he  remarked. \"Good!\"    He turned back to me. \"That was the Finger-Print Division. They're your  prints, all right, so we'll cancel the kidnapping charge.\"    \"What's the second strike on me?\"    \"That's a report phoned in by one of your partners that you seemed  to expect President Roosevelt's death two or three days before it  happened.\"    \"I did,\" I explained. \"A man named Axel Roscommon came to my office,  said that he was the chief Nazi agent in the United States, and told  me that Roosevelt had been poisoned at Yalta. I had already reported  Roscommon to the Bureau and was told to let him alone. Roscommon said  that only a few people, including Roosevelt, knew about the poisoning.  I wanted to pass on the warning but was told that it was too late, that  I would simply expose myself to suspicion. So what I did was to make  normal business preparations to take advantage of its effect on the  Stock Market.\"    Lamb looked up at the ceiling and remained silent for a few minutes.  \"So that's the way it was,\" he said. \"For your personal information,  Mr. Tompkins, Roscommon told the Director the same thing a month ago  but when Mr. Hoover tried to warn the Secret Service he had his ears  slapped back. If I'd known about the Roscommon angle in your case I  would have told the New York office not to worry. I thought perhaps  that this was another angle on the same story.\"    \"Do you believe that President Roosevelt was assassinated, Mr. Lamb?\" I  asked, point-blank.    He shrugged his shoulders. \"No, I do not,\" he replied. \"Not officially,  that is. It is not inconceivable and the Secret Service is so set in  its ideas and methods that--well, frankly I'd rather not believe it.  I have no evidence, aside from a verbal warning which might have been  coincidence. Some of our toxicologists say that it could be done,  others deny that there is a virus which can produce the symptoms of a  paralytic stroke. In any case, it's outside of our jurisdiction.\"    I heaved a sigh of relief. \"Thank God I'm clear of that one,\" I said.  \"I shouldn't like to be mixed up, even by accident, in anything like  that. I remember what happened to Dr. Mudd.\"    Lamb nodded. \"The doctor who bandaged Booth's leg after the murder of  Lincoln? Yes, I can see your point.\"    \"How about the third charge?\" I asked.    Lamb looked serious. \"That's not going to be so easy, Mr. Tompkins,\" he  announced. \"Harcourt reports that he doesn't think there's anything to  it, but Naval Intelligence has the jitters about this Alaska business.  It seems to be pretty well established that on the afternoon of April  second you stated that the U.S.S. Alaska had been sunk in an explosion  off the western Aleutians. That was over ten days ago and there is  still no word from the carrier. The last report came from Adak which  had picked the ship up by radar on the first. The report given us was  that you represented that it was all a dream. What worries the Navy  about this explanation is that no public announcement had ever been  made of the Alaska's launching or commission. She's a sneak-carrier  built under stringent security regulations and until you came into the  picture the Navy was pretty sure that there'd been no leak.\"    I nodded dismally. \"Knowing the Navy,\" I replied, \"I can see how they  feel. All that I can suggest, Mr. Lamb, is that this is a case of  mental telepathy. There have been plenty of other instances of it on  record. Often they call it intuition or second sight. I can only say  that if you investigate and can find any other explanation I'll be  delighted.\"    \"I don't think that Admiral Ballister--he's the present head of O.N.I.,  though they change so fast we almost lose count--will be satisfied  with the theory that it is a case of E.S.P. That's 'extra-sensory  perception' and there have been plenty of scientific experiments in  that field but the Navy doesn't know about them. And then, of course,  there was the bomb--\"    I nodded. \"The thorium bomb--\" I began, and stopped as I noticed an  official change in Lamb's attitude.    \"Exactly, Mr. Tompkins,\" he observed. \"The thorium bomb. Nobody--at  least outside of the President, the Secretary of the Navy and Professor  Chalmis--was supposed to know that there was such a thing as a thorium  bomb. The security arrangements on the thorium project were so  drastic--\"    \"Roscommon knew all about it,\" I said. \"He also mentioned Chalmis to  me.\"    The Deputy Director looked slightly ill. \"He did, did he?\" he growled.  \"_That_ will teach the Navy not to let the Bureau handle domestic  security. Hell, this thing gets bigger and bigger every minute. If  Roscommon knew about it, then anybody could have known. Why, it's been  an offense against the Espionage Act, even to print the word 'thorium'  outside of chemical textbooks, and Chalmis is supposed to be in the  T.B. sanitarium at Saranac. Wonder what happened to him?\"    I leaned forward. \"He's dead, Mr. Lamb,\" I assured him. \"Everybody on  the Alaska is dead. The bomb went off and there's nobody left to tell  the tale.\"    \"How do you do it, Tompkins?\" Lamb demanded. \"If you will give us the  details and the names of your accomplices I think I can promise you a  life sentence instead of the electric chair.\"    \"Mr. Lamb,\" I replied, \"You can promise till the cows come home. I--W.  S. Tompkins--had no connection with it at all and you can't prove that  I had. I know about it only because of--well, call it mental telepathy.  I could sit down and tell you exactly what happened on the Alaska  before Chalmis deliberately touched off the bomb, but I couldn't prove  it and there isn't a living soul who could support or disprove my  story. And if you place me under arrest I'll be in a position to sue  for heavy damages. False arrest on a charge of treason is no joke and  I'll fight.\"    Lamb looked slightly uncomfortable. \"Well?\" he asked. \"What would you  do if you were me? Let you go, with the Navy howling for action?\"    \"There are two things I'd do,\" I told him. \"First of all, I'd assign  a flock of agents to see if they can find out where I was and what I  was doing between the 25th of March and the second"]]]
