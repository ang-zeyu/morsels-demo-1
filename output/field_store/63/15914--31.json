If she  should recover, and he could have prayed that she might, it would of  course be his part to provide for her--of course. To be just, he could  not but confess that she indeed had good reason to hate him: but Paula?  He had shown her nothing but kindness and yet how unhesitatingly, how  openly she had displayed her enmity. He could see her now with the  name \"murderer\" on her quivering lips; the word had stung him like a  lance-thrust. What a hideous, degrading and unjust accusation lay in  that exclamation! Should he submit to it unrevenged?    Was she as innocent as she was haughty and cold? What was she doing in  the viridarium at midnight?--For she must have been there before that  ill-starred dog flew at Mandane. An assignation with the owner of the  shoes his mother had found was out of the question, for they belonged to  some man about the stables. Love, thought he, for a wonder had nothing  to do with it; but as he came in he had noticed a man crossing the  court-yard who looked like Paula's freedman, Hiram the trainer. Probably  she had arranged a meeting with her stammering friend in order--in  order?--Well, there was but one thing that seemed likely: She  was plotting to fly from his parents' house and needed this man's  assistance.    He had seen within a few hours of his return that his mother did not  make life sweet to the girl, and yet his father had very possibly  opposed her wish to seek another home. But why should she avoid and hate  him? In that expedition on the river and on their way home he could have  sworn that she loved him, and the remembrance of those hours brought her  near to him again, and wiped out his schemes of vengeance against her,  of punishment to be visited on her. Then he thought of little Katharina  whom his mother intended him to marry, and at the thought he laughed  softly to himself. In the Imperial gardens at Constantinople he had once  seen a strange Indian bird, with a tiny body and head and an immensely  long tail, shining like silver and mother of pearl. This was Katharina!  She herself a mere nothing; but then her tail! vast estates and immense  sums of money; and this--this was all his mother saw. But did he need  more than he had? How rich his father must be to spend so large a sum on  an offering to the Church as heedlessly as men give alms to a beggar.    Katharina--and Paula!    Yes, the little girl was a bright, brisk creature; but then Thomas'  daughter--what power there was in her eye, what majesty in her gait,  how--how--how enchanting her--her voice could be--her voice....    He was asleep, worn out by heat and fatigue; and in a dream he saw Paula  lying on a couch strewn with roses while all about her sounded wonderful  heart-ensnaring music; and the couch was not solid but blue water,  gently moving: he went towards her and suddenly a large black  eagle swooped down on him, flapped his wings in his face and when,  half-blinded, he put his hand to his eyes the bird pecked the roses as a  hen picks millet and barley. Then he was angry, rushed at the eagle, and  tried to clutch him with his hands; but his feet seemed rooted to the  ground, and the more he struggled to move freely the more firmly he was  dragged backwards. He fought like a madman against the hindering force,  and suddenly it released him. He was still under this impression when  he woke, streaming with perspiration, and opened his eyes. By his couch  stood his mother who had laid her hand on his feet to rouse him.    She looked pale and anxious and begged him to come quickly to his father  who was much disturbed, and wished to speak with him. Then she hurried  away.    While he hastily arranged his hair and had his shoes clasped he felt  vexed that, under the influence of that foolish dream, and still  half asleep, he had let his mother go before ascertaining what the  circumstances were that had given rise to his father's anxiety. Had it  anything to do with the incidents of the past night? No.--If he had been  suspected his mother would have told him and warned him. It must refer  to something else. Perhaps the old merchant's stalwart headman had died  of his wounds, and his father wished to send him--Orion--across the Nile  to the Arab viceroy to obtain forgiveness for the murder of a Moslem,  actually within the precincts of the governor's house. This fatal blow  might indeed entail serious consequences; however, the matter might very  likely be quite other than this.    When he left his room the brooding heat that filled the house struck  him as peculiarly oppressive, and a painful feeling, closely resembling  shame, stole over him as he crossed the viridarium, and glanced at the  grass from which--thanks to Paula's ill-meant warning--he had carefully  brushed away his foot-marks before daybreak. How cowardly, how base,  it all was The best of all in life: honor, self-respect, the proud  consciousness of being an honest man--all staked and all lost for  nothing at all! He could have slapped his own face or cried aloud like  a child that has broken its most treasured toy. But of what use was all  this? What was done could not be undone; and now he must keep his wits  about him so as to remain, in the eyes of others at least, what he had  always been, low as he had fallen in his own.    It was scorchingly hot in the enclosed garden-plot, surrounded by  buildings, and open to the sun; not a human creature was in sight;  the house seemed dead. The gaudy flag-staffs and trellis-work, and the  pillars of the verandah, which had all been newly painted in honor of  his return and were still wreathed with garlands, exhaled a smell, to  him quite sickening, of melting resin, drying varnish and faded flowers.  Though there was no breath of air the atmosphere quivered, as it seemed  from the fierce rays of the sun, which were reflected like arrows from  everything around him. The butterflies and dragonflies appeared to Orion  to move their wings more languidly as they hovered over the plants and  flowers, the very fountain danced up more lazily and not so high as  usual: everything about him was hot, sweltering, oppressive; and the man  who had always been so independent and looked up to, who for years had  been free to career through life uncontrolled, and guarded by every good  Genius now felt trammelled, hemmed in and harassed.    In his father's cool fountain-room he could breathe more freely; but  only for a moment. The blood faded from his cheeks, and he had to make a  strong effort to greet his father calmly and in his usual manner; for in  front of the divan where the governor commonly reclined, lay the Persian  hanging, and close by stood his mother and the Arab merchant. Sebek, the  steward awaited his master's orders, in the background in the attitude  of humility which was torture to his old back, but in which he was never  required to remain: Orion now signed to him to stand up:    The Arab's mild features wore a look of extreme gravity, and deep  vexation could be read in his kindly eyes. As the young man entered he  bowed slightly; they had already met that morning. The Mukaukas, who was  lying deathly pale with colorless lips, scarcely opened his eyes at his  son's greeting. It might have been thought that a bier was waiting in  the next room and that the mourners had assembled here.    The piece of work was only half unrolled, but Orion at once saw the spot  whence its crowning glory was now missing--the large emerald which, as  he alone could know, was on its way to Constantinople. His theft had  been discovered. How fearful, how fatal might the issue be!    \"Courage, courage!\" he said to himself. \"Only preserve your presence  of mind. What profit is life with loss of honor? Keep your eyes open;  everything depends on that, Orion!\"    He succeeded in hastily collecting his thoughts, and exclaimed in a  voice which lacked little of its usual eager cheerfulness:    \"How dismal you all look! It is indeed a terrible disaster that the dog  should have handled the poor girl so roughly, and that our people should  have behaved so outrageously; but, as I told you this morning, worthy  Merchant, the guilty parties shall pay for it with their lives. My  father, I am sure, will agree that you should deal with them according  to your pleasure, and our leech Philippus, in spite of his youth, is  a perfect Hippocrates I can assure you! He will patch up the fine  fellow--your head-man I mean, and as to any question of compensation, my  father--well, you know he is no haggler.\"    \"I beg you not to add insult to the injury that I have suffered under  your roof,\" interrupted Haschim. \"No amount of money can buy off my  wrath over the spilt blood of a friend--and Rustem was my friend--a free  and valiant youth. As to the punishment of the guilty: on that I insist.  Blood cries for blood. That is our creed; and though yours, to be sure,  enjoins the contrary, so far as I know you act by the same rule as we.  All honor to your physician; but it goes to my heart, and raises my  gall to see such things take place in the house of the man to whom  the Khaliff has confided the weal or woe of Egyptian Christians. Your  boasted tolerance has led to the death of an honest though humble man  in a time of perfect peace--or at least maimed him for life. As to your  honesty, it would seem...\"    \"Who dares impugn it?\" cried Orion.    \"I, young man,\" replied the merchant with the calm dignity of age.  \"I, who sold this piece of work last evening, and find it this morning  robbed of its most precious ornament.\"    \"The great emerald has been cut from the hanging during the night.\" Dame  Neforis explained. \"You yourself went with the man who carried it to the  tablinum and saw it laid there.\"    \"And in the very cloth in which your people had wrapped it,\" added  Orion. \"Our good old Sebek there was with me. Who fetched away the bale  this morning; who brought it here and opened it?\"    \"Happily"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/560"],[0,"Mr. Standfast (#20)"],[1," inns and shops, but I can't do without food. I see from the map there's  a town about six miles on. Go there and buy me anything that's  tinned--biscuits and tongue and sardines, and a couple of bottles of  whisky if you can get them. This may be a long job, so buy plenty.'    'Whaur'll I put them?' was his only question.    We fixed on a cache, a hundred yards from the highway in a place where  two ridges of hill enclosed the view so that only a short bit of road  was visible.    'I'll get back to the Kyle,' he told me, 'and a'body there kens Andra  Amos, if ye should find a way of sendin' a message or comin' yourself.  Oh, and I've got a word to ye from a lady that we ken of. She says, the  sooner ye're back in Vawnity Fair the better she'll be pleased, always  provided ye've got over the Hill Difficulty.'    A smile screwed up his old face and he waved his whip in farewell. I  interpreted Mary's message as an incitement to speed, but I could not  make the pace. That was Gresson's business. I think I was a little  nettled, till I cheered myself by another interpretation. She might be  anxious for my safety, she might want to see me again, anyhow the mere  sending of the message showed I was not forgotten. I was in a pleasant  muse as I breasted the hill, keeping discreetly in the cover of the  many gullies. At the top I looked down on Ranna and the sea.    There lay the _Tobermory_ busy unloading. It would be some time, no  doubt, before Gresson could leave. There was no row-boat in the channel  yet, and I might have to wait hours. I settled myself snugly between  two rocks, where I could not be seen, and where I had a clear view of  the sea and shore. But presently I found that I wanted some long  heather to make a couch, and I emerged to get some. I had not raised my  head for a second when I flopped down again. For I had a neighbour on  the hill-top.    He was about two hundred yards off, just reaching the crest, and,  unlike me, walking quite openly. His eyes were on Ranna, so he did not  notice me, but from my cover I scanned every line of him. He looked an  ordinary countryman, wearing badly cut, baggy knickerbockers of the  kind that gillies affect. He had a face like a Portuguese Jew, but I  had seen that type before among people with Highland names; they might  be Jews or not, but they could speak Gaelic. Presently he disappeared.  He had followed my example and selected a hiding-place.    It was a clear, hot day, but very pleasant in that airy place. Good  scents came up from the sea, the heather was warm and fragrant, bees  droned about, and stray seagulls swept the ridge with their wings. I  took a look now and then towards my neighbour, but he was deep in his  hidey-hole. Most of the time I kept my glasses on Ranna, and watched  the doings of the _Tobermory_. She was tied up at the jetty, but seemed  in no hurry to unload. I watched the captain disembark and walk up to a  house on the hillside. Then some idlers sauntered down towards her and  stood talking and smoking close to her side. The captain returned and  left again. A man with papers in his hand appeared, and a woman with  what looked like a telegram. The mate went ashore in his best clothes.  Then at last, after midday, Gresson appeared. He joined the captain at  the piermaster's office, and presently emerged on the other side of the  jetty where some small boats were beached. A man from the _Tobermory_  came in answer to his call, a boat was launched, and began to make its  way into the channel. Gresson sat in the stern, placidly eating his  luncheon.    I watched every detail of that crossing with some satisfaction that my  forecast was turning out right. About half-way across, Gresson took the  oars, but soon surrendered them to the _Tobermory_ man, and lit a pipe.  He got out a pair of binoculars and raked my hillside. I tried to see  if my neighbour was making any signal, but all was quiet. Presently the  boat was hid from me by the bulge of the hill, and I caught the sound  of her scraping on the beach.    Gresson was not a hill-walker like my neighbour. It took him the best  part of an hour to get to the top, and he reached it at a point not two  yards from my hiding-place. I could hear by his labouring breath that  he was very blown. He walked straight over the crest till he was out of  sight of Ranna, and flung himself on the ground. He was now about fifty  yards from me, and I made shift to lessen the distance. There was a  grassy trench skirting the north side of the hill, deep and thickly  overgrown with heather. I wound my way along it till I was about twelve  yards from him, where I stuck, owing to the trench dying away. When I  peered out of the cover I saw that the other man had joined him and  that the idiots were engaged in embracing each other.    I dared not move an inch nearer, and as they talked in a low voice I  could hear nothing of what they said. Nothing except one phrase, which  the strange man repeated twice, very emphatically. 'Tomorrow night,' he  said, and I noticed that his voice had not the Highland inflection  which I looked for. Gresson nodded and glanced at his watch, and then  the two began to move downhill towards the road I had travelled that  morning.    I followed as best I could, using a shallow dry watercourse of which  sheep had made a track, and which kept me well below the level of the  moor. It took me down the hill, but some distance from the line the  pair were taking, and I had to reconnoitre frequently to watch their  movements. They were still a quarter of a mile or so from the road,  when they stopped and stared, and I stared with them. On that lonely  highway travellers were about as rare as roadmenders, and what caught  their eye was a farmer's gig driven by a thick-set elderly man with a  woollen comforter round his neck.    I had a bad moment, for I reckoned that if Gresson recognized Amos he  might take fright. Perhaps the driver of the gig thought the same, for  he appeared to be very drunk. He waved his whip, he jiggoted the reins,  and he made an effort to sing. He looked towards the figures on the  hillside, and cried out something. The gig narrowly missed the ditch,  and then to my relief the horse bolted. Swaying like a ship in a gale,  the whole outfit lurched out of sight round the corner of hill where  lay my cache. If Amos could stop the beast and deliver the goods there,  he had put up a masterly bit of buffoonery.    The two men laughed at the performance, and then they parted. Gresson  retraced his steps up the hill. The other man--I called him in my mind  the Portuguese Jew--started off at a great pace due west, across the  road, and over a big patch of bog towards the northern butt of the  Coolin. He had some errand, which Gresson knew about, and he was in a  hurry to perform it. It was clearly my job to get after him.    I had a rotten afternoon. The fellow covered the moorland miles like a  deer, and under the hot August sun I toiled on his trail. I had to keep  well behind, and as much as possible in cover, in case he looked back;  and that meant that when he had passed over a ridge I had to double not  to let him get too far ahead, and when we were in an open place I had  to make wide circuits to keep hidden. We struck a road which crossed a  low pass and skirted the flank of the mountains, and this we followed  till we were on the western side and within sight of the sea. It was  gorgeous weather, and out on the blue water I saw cool sails moving and  little breezes ruffling the calm, while I was glowing like a furnace.  Happily I was in fair training, and I needed it. The Portuguese Jew  must have done a steady six miles an hour over abominable country.    About five o'clock we came to a point where I dared not follow. The  road ran flat by the edge of the sea, so that several miles of it were  visible. Moreover, the man had begun to look round every few minutes.  He was getting near something and wanted to be sure that no one was in  his neighbourhood. I left the road accordingly, and took to the  hillside, which to my undoing was one long cascade of screes and  tumbled rocks. I saw him drop over a rise which seemed to mark the rim  of a little bay into which descended one of the big corries of the  mountains. It must have been a good half-hour later before I, at my  greater altitude and with far worse going, reached the same rim. I  looked into the glen and my man had disappeared.    He could not have crossed it, for the place was wider than I had  thought. A ring of black precipices came down to within half a mile of  the shore, and between them was a big stream--long, shallow pools at  the sea end and a chain of waterfalls above. He had gone to earth like  a badger somewhere, and I dared not move in case he might be watching  me from behind a boulder.    But even as I hesitated he appeared again, fording the stream, his face  set on the road we had come. Whatever his errand was he had finished  it, and was posting back to his master. For a moment I thought I should  follow him, but another instinct prevailed. He had not come to this  wild place for the scenery. Somewhere down in the glen there was  something or somebody that held the key of the mystery. It was my  business to stay there till I had unlocked it. Besides, in two hours it  would be dark, and I had had enough walking for one day.    I made my way to the stream side and had a long drink. The corrie  behind me was lit up with the westering sun, and the bald cliffs were  flushed with pink and gold. On each side of the stream was turf like a  lawn, perhaps a hundred yards wide, and then a tangle of long heather  and boulders right up to the edge of the great rocks. I had never seen  a more delectable evening, but I could not enjoy its peace because of  my anxiety about the Portuguese Jew. He had not been there more than  half an hour, just about long enough for a man to travel to the"]]]
