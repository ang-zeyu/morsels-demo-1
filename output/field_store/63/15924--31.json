She walked straight forward, with her head  drooping a little, and her arms folded in her cloak.  The dead leaves,  which had whirled in the wind before me when I had heard of her  marriage engagement in the morning, whirled in the wind before her, and  rose and fell and scattered themselves at her feet as she walked on in  the pale waning sunlight.  The dog shivered and trembled, and pressed  against her dress impatiently for notice and encouragement.  But she  never heeded him.  She walked on, farther and farther away from me,  with the dead leaves whirling about her on the path--walked on, till my  aching eyes could see her no more, and I was left alone again with my  own heavy heart.    In another hour's time I had done my work, and the sunset was at hand.  I got my hat and coat in the hall, and slipped out of the house without  meeting any one.    The clouds were wild in the western heaven, and the wind blew chill  from the sea.  Far as the shore was, the sound of the surf swept over  the intervening moorland, and beat drearily in my ears when I entered  the churchyard.  Not a living creature was in sight.  The place looked  lonelier than ever as I chose my position, and waited and watched, with  my eyes on the white cross that rose over Mrs. Fairlie's grave.        XIII    The exposed situation of the churchyard had obliged me to be cautious  in choosing the position that I was to occupy.    The main entrance to the church was on the side next to the  burial-ground, and the door was screened by a porch walled in on either  side.  After some little hesitation, caused by natural reluctance to  conceal myself, indispensable as that concealment was to the object in  view, I had resolved on entering the porch. A loophole window was  pierced in each of its side walls.  Through one of these windows I  could see Mrs. Fairlie's grave.  The other looked towards the stone  quarry in which the sexton's cottage was built.  Before me, fronting  the porch entrance, was a patch of bare burial-ground, a line of low  stone wall, and a strip of lonely brown hill, with the sunset clouds  sailing heavily over it before the strong, steady wind.  No living  creature was visible or audible--no bird flew by me, no dog barked from  the sexton's cottage.  The pauses in the dull beating of the surf were  filled up by the dreary rustling of the dwarf trees near the grave, and  the cold faint bubble of the brook over its stony bed.  A dreary scene  and a dreary hour.  My spirits sank fast as I counted out the minutes  of the evening in my hiding-place under the church porch.    It was not twilight yet--the light of the setting sun still lingered in  the heavens, and little more than the first half-hour of my solitary  watch had elapsed--when I heard footsteps and a voice.  The footsteps  were approaching from the other side of the church, and the voice was a  woman's.    \"Don't you fret, my dear, about the letter,\" said the voice.  \"I gave  it to the lad quite safe, and the lad he took it from me without a  word.  He went his way and I went mine, and not a living soul followed  me afterwards--that I'll warrant.\"    These words strung up my attention to a pitch of expectation that was  almost painful.  There was a pause of silence, but the footsteps still  advanced.  In another moment two persons, both women, passed within my  range of view from the porch window.  They were walking straight  towards the grave; and therefore they had their backs turned towards me.    One of the women was dressed in a bonnet and shawl.  The other wore a  long travelling-cloak of a dark-blue colour, with the hood drawn over  her head.  A few inches of her gown were visible below the cloak.  My  heart beat fast as I noted the colour--it was white.    After advancing about half-way between the church and the grave they  stopped, and the woman in the cloak turned her head towards her  companion.  But her side face, which a bonnet might now have allowed me  to see, was hidden by the heavy, projecting edge of the hood.    \"Mind you keep that comfortable warm cloak on,\" said the same voice  which I had already heard--the voice of the woman in the shawl.  \"Mrs.  Todd is right about your looking too particular, yesterday, all in  white.  I'll walk about a little while you're here, churchyards being  not at all in my way, whatever they may be in yours.  Finish what you  want to do before I come back, and let us be sure and get home again  before night.\"    With those words she turned about, and retracing her steps, advanced  with her face towards me.  It was the face of an elderly woman, brown,  rugged, and healthy, with nothing dishonest or suspicious in the look  of it.  Close to the church she stopped to pull her shawl closer round  her.    \"Queer,\" she said to herself, \"always queer, with her whims and her  ways, ever since I can remember her.  Harmless, though--as harmless,  poor soul, as a little child.\"    She sighed--looked about the burial-ground nervously--shook her head,  as if the dreary prospect by no means pleased her, and disappeared  round the corner of the church.    I doubted for a moment whether I ought to follow and speak to her or  not.  My intense anxiety to find myself face to face with her companion  helped me to decide in the negative.  I could ensure seeing the woman  in the shawl by waiting near the churchyard until she came  back--although it seemed more than doubtful whether she could give me  the information of which I was in search.  The person who had delivered  the letter was of little consequence. The person who had written it was  the one centre of interest, and the one source of information, and that  person I now felt convinced was before me in the churchyard.    While these ideas were passing through my mind I saw the woman in the  cloak approach close to the grave, and stand looking at it for a little  while.  She then glanced all round her, and taking a white linen cloth  or handkerchief from under her cloak, turned aside towards the brook.  The little stream ran into the churchyard under a tiny archway in the  bottom of the wall, and ran out again, after a winding course of a few  dozen yards, under a similar opening.  She dipped the cloth in the  water, and returned to the grave.  I saw her kiss the white cross, then  kneel down before the inscription, and apply her wet cloth to the  cleansing of it.    After considering how I could show myself with the least possible  chance of frightening her, I resolved to cross the wall before me, to  skirt round it outside, and to enter the churchyard again by the stile  near the grave, in order that she might see me as I approached.  She  was so absorbed over her employment that she did not hear me coming  until I had stepped over the stile.  Then she looked up, started to her  feet with a faint cry, and stood facing me in speechless and motionless  terror.    \"Don't be frightened,\" I said.  \"Surely you remember me?\"    I stopped while I spoke--then advanced a few steps gently--then stopped  again--and so approached by little and little till I was close to her.  If there had been any doubt still left in my mind, it must have been  now set at rest.  There, speaking affrightedly for itself--there was  the same face confronting me over Mrs. Fairlie's grave which had first  looked into mine on the high-road by night.    \"You remember me?\" I said.  \"We met very late, and I helped you to find  the way to London.  Surely you have not forgotten that?\"    Her features relaxed, and she drew a heavy breath of relief.  I saw the  new life of recognition stirring slowly under the death-like stillness  which fear had set on her face.    \"Don't attempt to speak to me just yet,\" I went on.  \"Take time to  recover yourself--take time to feel quite certain that I am a friend.\"    \"You are very kind to me,\" she murmured.  \"As kind now as you were  then.\"    She stopped, and I kept silence on my side.  I was not granting time  for composure to her only, I was gaining time also for myself.  Under  the wan wild evening light, that woman and I were met together again, a  grave between us, the dead about us, the lonesome hills closing us  round on every side.  The time, the place, the circumstances under  which we now stood face to face in the evening stillness of that dreary  valley--the lifelong interests which might hang suspended on the next  chance words that passed between us--the sense that, for aught I knew  to the contrary, the whole future of Laura Fairlie's life might be  determined, for good or for evil, by my winning or losing the  confidence of the forlorn creature who stood trembling by her mother's  grave--all threatened to shake the steadiness and the self-control on  which every inch of the progress I might yet make now depended.  I  tried hard, as I felt this, to possess myself of all my resources; I  did my utmost to turn the few moments for reflection to the best  account.    \"Are you calmer now?\" I said, as soon as I thought it time to speak  again.  \"Can you talk to me without feeling frightened, and without  forgetting that I am a friend?\"    \"How did you come here?\" she asked, without noticing what I had just  said to her.    \"Don't you remember my telling you, when we last met, that I was going  to Cumberland? I have been in Cumberland ever since--I have been  staying all the time at Limmeridge House.\"    \"At Limmeridge House!\" Her pale face brightened as she repeated the  words, her wandering eyes fixed on me with a sudden interest. \"Ah, how  happy you must have been!\" she said, looking at me eagerly, without a  shadow of its former distrust left in her expression.    I took advantage of her newly-aroused confidence in me to observe her  face, with an attention and a curiosity which I had hitherto restrained  myself from showing, for caution's sake.  I looked at her, with my mind  full of that other lovely face which had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5891"],[0,"Travels in West Africa: Congo Français, Corisco and Cameroons (#20)"],[1,"villages round Libreville, which were store  places for roof mats, of which the natives carefully keep a store  dry and ready for emergencies in the way of tornadoes, or to sell.  We stop abreast of this village.  Inhabitants in scores rush out and  form an excited row along the vertical bank edge, several of the  more excited individuals falling over it into the water.    Yells from our passengers on the lower deck.  Yells from inhabitants  on shore.  Yells of vite, vite from the Captain.  Dogs bark, horns  bray, some exhilarated individual thumps the village drum, canoes  fly out from the bank towards us.  Fearful scrimmage heard going on  all the time on the deck below.  As soon as the canoes are  alongside, our passengers from the lower deck, with their bundles  and their dogs, pour over the side into them.  Canoes rock wildly  and wobble off rapidly towards the bank, frightening the passengers  because they have got their best clothes on, and fear that the  Eclaireur will start and upset them altogether with her wash.    On reaching the bank, the new arrivals disappear into brown clouds  of wives and relations, and the dogs into fighting clusters of  resident dogs.  Happy, happy day!  For those men who have gone  ashore have been away on hire to the government and factories for a  year, and are safe home in the bosoms of their families again, and  not only they themselves, but all the goods they have got in pay.  The remaining passengers below still yell to their departed friends;  I know not what they say, but I expect it's the Fan equivalent for  \"Mind you write.  Take care of yourself.  Yes, I'll come and see you  soon,\" etc., etc.  While all this is going on, the Eclaireur quietly  slides down river, with the current, broadside on as if she smelt  her stable at Lembarene.  This I find is her constant habit whenever  the captain, the engineer, and the man at the wheel are all busy in  a row along the rail, shouting overside, which occurs whenever we  have passengers to land.  Her iniquity being detected when the last  canoe load has left for the shore, she is spun round and sent up  river again at full speed.    We go on up stream; now and again stopping at little villages to  land passengers or at little sub-factories to discharge cargo, until  evening closes in, when we anchor and tie up at O'Saomokita, where  there is a sub-factory of Messrs. Woermann's, in charge of which is  a white man, the only white man between Lembarene and Njole.  He  comes on board and looks only a boy, but is really aged twenty.  He  is a Frenchman, and was at Hatton and Cookson's first, then he  joined Woermann's, who have put him in charge of this place.  The  isolation for a white man must be terrible; sometimes two months  will go by without his seeing another white face but that in his  looking-glass, and when he does see another, it is only by a  fleeting visit such as we now pay him, and to make the most of this,  he stays on board to dinner.    June 23rd.--Start off steaming up river early in the morning time.  Land ahead showing mountainous.  Rather suddenly the banks grow  higher.  Here and there in the forest are patches which look like  regular hand-made plantations, which they are not, but only patches  of egombie-gombie trees, showing that at this place was once a  native town.  Whenever land is cleared along here, this tree springs  up all over the ground.  It grows very rapidly, and has great leaves  something like a sycamore leaf, only much larger.  These leaves  growing in a cluster at the top of the straight stem give an  umbrella-like appearance to the affair; so the natives call them and  an umbrella by the same name, but whether they think the umbrella is  like the tree or the tree is like the umbrella, I can't make out.  I  am always getting myself mixed over this kind of thing in my  attempts \"to contemplate phenomena from a scientific standpoint,\" as  Cambridge ordered me to do.  I'll give the habit up.  \"You can't do  that sort of thing out here--It's the climate,\" and I will content  myself with stating the fact, that when a native comes into a store  and wants an umbrella, he asks for an egombie-gombie.    The uniformity of the height of the individual trees in one of these  patches is striking, and it arises from their all starting fair.  I  cannot make out other things about them to my satisfaction, for you  very rarely see one of them in the wild bush, and then it does not  bear a fruit that the natives collect and use, and then chuck away  the stones round their domicile.  Anyhow, there they are all one  height, and all one colour, and apparently allowing no other  vegetation to make any headway among them.  But I found when I  carefully investigated egombie-gombie patches that there were a few  of the great, slower-growing forest trees coming up amongst them,  and in time when these attain a sufficient height, their shade kills  off the egombie-gombie, and the patch goes back into the great  forest from which it came.  The frequency of these patches arises  from the nomadic habits of the chief tribe in these regions, the  Fans.  They rarely occupy one site for a village for any  considerable time on account--firstly, of their wasteful method of  collecting rubber by cutting down the vine, which soon stamps it out  of a district; and, secondly, from their quarrelsome ways.  So when  a village of Fans has cleared all the rubber out of its district, or  has made the said district too hot to hold it by rows with other  villages, or has got itself very properly shelled out and burnt for  some attack on traders or the French flag in any form, its  inhabitants clear off into another district, and build another  village; for bark and palm thatch are cheap, and house removing just  nothing; when you are an unsophisticated cannibal Fan you don't  require a pantechnicon van to stow away your one or two mushroom-  shaped stools, knives, and cooking-pots, and a calabash or so.  If  you are rich, maybe you will have a box with clothes in as well, but  as a general rule all your clothes are on your back.  So your wives  just pick up the stools and the knives and the cooking-pots, and the  box, and the children toddle off with the calabashes.  You have, of  course, the gun to carry, for sleeping or waking a Fan never parts  with his gun, and so there you are \"finish,\" as M. Pichault would  say, and before your new bark house is up, there grows the egombie-  gombie, where your house once stood.  Now and again, for lack of  immediate neighbouring villages to quarrel with, one end of a  village will quarrel with the other end.  The weaker end then goes  off and builds itself another village, keeping an eye lifting for  any member of the stronger end who may come conveniently into its  neighbourhood to be killed and eaten.  Meanwhile, the egombie-gombie  grows over the houses of the empty end, pretending it's a plantation  belonging to the remaining half.  I once heard a new-comer hold  forth eloquently as to how those Fans were maligned.  \"They say,\"  said he, with a fine wave of his arm towards such a patch, \"that  these people do not till the soil--that they are not industrious--  that the few plantations they do make are ill-kept--that they are  only a set of wandering hunters and cannibals.  Look there at those  magnificent plantations!\"  I did look, but I did not alter my  opinion of the Fans, for I know my old friend egombie-gombie when I  see him.    This morning the French official seems sad and melancholy.  I fancy  he has got a Monday head (Kipling), but he revives as the day goes  on.  As we go on, the banks become hills and the broad river, which  has been showing sheets of sandbanks in all directions, now narrows  and shows only neat little beaches of white sand in shallow places  along the bank.  The current is terrific.  The Eclaireur breathes  hard, and has all she can do to fight her way up against it.  Masses  of black weathered rock in great boulders show along the exposed  parts of both banks, left dry by the falling waters.  Each bank is  steep, and quantities of great trees, naked and bare, are hanging  down from them, held by their roots and bush-rope entanglement from  being swept away with the rushing current, and they make a great  white fringe to the banks.  The hills become higher and higher, and  more and more abrupt, and the river runs between them in a gloomy  ravine, winding to and fro; we catch sight of a patch of white sand  ahead, which I mistake for a white painted house, but immediately  after doubling round a bend we see the houses of the Talagouga  Mission Station.  The Eclaireur forthwith has an hysteric fit on her  whistle, so as to frighten M. Forget and get him to dash off in his  canoe to her at once.  Apparently he knows her, and does not hurry,  but comes on board quietly.  I find there will be no place for me to  stay at at Njole, so I decide to go on in the Eclaireur and use her  as an hotel while there, and then return and stay with Mme. Forget  if she will have me.  I consult M. Forget on this point.  He says,  \"Oh, yes,\" but seems to have lost something of great value recently,  and not to be quite clear where.  Only manner, I suppose.  When M.  Forget has got his mails he goes, and the Eclaireur goes on; indeed,  she has never really stopped, for the water is too deep to anchor in  here, and the terrific current would promptly whisk the steamer down  out of Talagouga gorge were she to leave off fighting it.  We run on  up past Talagouga Island, where the river broadens out again a  little, but not much, and reach Njole by nightfall, and tie up to a  tree by Dumas' factory beach.  Usual uproar, but as Mr. Cockshut  says, no mosquitoes.  The mosquito belt ends abruptly at  O'Soamokita.    Next morning I go ashore and start on a walk.  Lovely road, bright  yellow clay, as hard as paving stone.  On each side it is most  neatly hedged with pine-apples; behind "]]]
