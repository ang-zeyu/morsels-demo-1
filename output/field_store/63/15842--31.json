They make a difference between the       Constitution and the Government of the United States; to the       Constitution they claim to be very loyal.         . . . \"Because the Governor, in his Message, has animadverted       upon some of the customs of the Mormons, and has recommended       that steps be taken to Americanize the same, he has given       offence, and has had his Message suppressed.         \"Polygamy of the most unlimited character, sanctioning the       cohabitation of a man with the mother and her daughters       indiscriminately, is not the only un-American thing among       them.         . . . \"The Message, on examination, is found to contain nothing       that should give offence to any legislature willing to be       governed by the laws of morality.         \"It is the opinion of your Committee that the Message is an       able exposition of the manners and customs of the people in       that Territory, and as such, brought down the censure of the       leaders of the Mormon Church, and were it not for the       animadversions therein contained, it would not have been       suppressed.\"    The printing and distribution of the Message is then recommended.    During the session of the Legislature an event occurred which caused  much indignation among the federal officers, and served to render  somewhat mutual the feelings of hostility which the leading saints  already entertained. This was nothing less than a forgery committed in  the Legislature upon a bill relating to the terms of one of the District  Courts.    The facts were as follows:--    The Territory was divided into three judicial districts. The First,  sometimes called the Provo District, comprised a number of counties  carved out of the centre of the Territory. This had been assigned to  Judge Drake. The Second, called the \"Cotton District,\" was assigned to  Judge Waite, and consisted of the three southernmost counties, Beaver,  Iron, and Washington. The Third District, Chief Justice Kinney's,  comprised the northern part of the Territory, including Salt Lake City.    On the 14th of January, 1863, the Legislature passed a bill, which was  signed by the Governor, changing the county seat of Washington County  from Washington to St. George, and in the same bill it was provided that  the United States Court for the transaction of territorial business,  should be held at St. George, on the third Monday of May. This time was  the same as that provided by the law previously in force.    This was before the assignment of the Judges had been made.    After Judge Waite had been assigned to the Second District [in which  many murders had been committed, and the murderers still at large], the  Legislature concluded they did not want court held in that district  until fall. They accordingly passed a bill, providing, among other  things, for holding the court at St. George on the third Monday of  October. But as they had already passed a bill fixing the term of court  in May, and as the Judge preferred to hold the term in May, that being  near the time when he was intending to hold court for the transaction of  United States business in the same district, the Governor declined  signing the second bill.    Soon after, having occasion to examine the first bill for another  purpose, he went to the Secretary's office and called for the bill, and  behold, _the word May had been erased, and the word October inserted  instead_! It appeared to have been done by the same hand which had  penned the body of the bill. This had been written by one of the clerks  of the House of Representatives. The Governor, after signing the bill,  had inadvertently returned it to the Legislature, and it had been sent  from that body to the Secretary's office, where it should have been sent  by the Governor. It had been recorded in that office before the forgery  was discovered.    The Governor immediately caused the record to be corrected, changed the  bill back from October to May, by erasing the word \"October\" and  interlining the word \"May.\" He then made a statement of the forgery and  its detection, over his own signature, on the margin of the bill.    He then sent a special Message to the Legislature, calling their  attention to the fact that a forgery had been committed; but, instead of  taking steps to ferret out the guilty party, the Legislature made an  issue of fact with the Governor, and endeavored to make out that it was  all the time October, and that no forgery had been committed. When the  matter was up in the House the second time, one member actually produced  a paper which he averred was the original draft, and which had October  in it. And this in the face of the fact, that five persons had seen the  bill in the Governor's office when the word May was in it, and that the  bill showed plainly, upon inspection, that it had been changed; the  outline of the letter \"y,\" in the word erased, being distinctly visible.    Thus the Legislature, by their collective action, implicated themselves  all in the forgery.    On the 16th of January the Legislature adjourned, without printing the  Governor's Message, or sending any appropriation bills for his  signature.    The day following, \"the Legislature of the State of Deseret\" met, and  commenced doing business under Brigham Young, as Governor. A Message was  delivered, and all the forms of legislation gone through with; in  reality, this _de facto_ government was the only one for which the  Mormons maintained even the show of respect.    The judicial system of the Territory was manifestly very defective, and  as constituted under the Organic Act of 1850, as the same had been  construed by the Federal Judges, was inadequate to the administration of  justice.    The greatest difficulty was experienced in the formation of juries, and  in the extraordinary jurisdiction assumed by the Probate Judges, all of  whom were Mormons.    The jurisdiction of the Probate Court, in the words of the Organic Act,  was to be \"as prescribed by law.\" Under this provision several of the  United States Judges had held that it was competent in the Legislature  to confer upon the Probate Courts any jurisdiction they pleased. The  Mormons, never behind in availing themselves of all advantages, had  accordingly granted to the Probate Courts concurrent jurisdiction with  the District Courts, in all cases civil and criminal.    Again; the juries had been selected by these courts acting with other  county authorities, and it was contended that the United States Courts  could only try causes before juries thus selected.    To remedy these defects, and to remove all doubt as to these complicated  questions, a bill was drawn by Judge Waite, for an Act of Congress  amendatory of the Organic Act of 1850. It provided for the selection of  United States juries by the Marshal, under the direction of the court,  as in other district and territorial courts of the United States.    The question of jurisdiction was to be settled by an express provision  that the Probate Court should have no jurisdiction to try any civil  action whatsoever. It was to do the usual probate business, and have a  limited criminal jurisdiction, subject to appeal to the District Court.  The bill also provided for an organization of the militia of the  Territory, under the Governor, and contained several other wholesome and  salutary provisions.    The bill was carefully drawn, and was submitted to the inspection of his  associate, Judge Drake, and of Governor Harding,--Judge Kinney being  absent from the Territory. It received the unqualified approval of Drake  and Harding, and, with their indorsement upon it, was sent to  Washington. In due time it was introduced in Congress by Senator  Browning, and referred to the proper committee.    The introduction of this bill was the signal for another outbreak. The  news was telegraphed to Salt Lake, and immediately Brigham called a  meeting at the Tabernacle.    The meeting was held on the 3d of March 1863. Notice having been  extensively circulated, some two or three thousand persons assembled,  excited by exaggerated statements concerning attempts upon the part of  the federal officers to \"interfere with their rights.\"    Speeches of the most inflammatory character were made at this meeting,  and the resentment and indignation of the ignorant masses of the people  were excited to the highest pitch. The following will serve as a  specimen of these harangues.    Elder John Taylor said:--         \"It has already been stated that these documents speak for       themselves. They come from those who are ostensibly our       guardians, and the guardians of our rights. They come from men       who ought to be actuated by the strictest principles of honor,       truth, virtue, integrity, and honesty, and whose high official       position ought to elevate them above suspicion,--yet what are       the results?         \"In relation to the Governor's Message, enough, perhaps, has    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/446"],[0,"A Book of Remarkable Criminals (#20)"],[1,"enter on this case without  any experience whatever of that peculiarly acquired art of  cross-examination. I fear I have done wrong. If I had had the assistance  of able counsel, much more light would have been thrown on this case  than has been.\" As we have seen, Butler enjoyed throughout his trial the  informal assistance of three of the most able counsel in New Zealand, so  that this heroic attitude of conscious innocence braving all dangers  loses most of its force. Without such assistance his danger might have  been very real.    A great deal of the evidence as to his conduct and demeanour at the time  of the murder Butler met by acknowledging that it was he who had broken  into Mr. Stamper's house on the Saturday morning, burgled it and set it  on fire. His consciousness of guilt in this respect was, he said, quite  sufficient to account for anything strange or furtive in his manner  at that time. He was already known to the police; meeting Bain on the  Saturday night, he felt more than ever sure that he was susspected{sic}  of the robbery at Mr. Stamper's; he therefore decided to leave Dunedin  as soon as possible. That night, he said, he spent wandering about the  streets half drunk, taking occasional shelter from the pouring rain,  until six o'clock on the Sunday morning, when he went to the Scotia  Hotel. A more detailed account of his movements on the night of the  Dewars' murder he did not, or would not, give.    When he comes to the facts of the murder and his theories as to the  nature and motive of the crime--theories which he developed at rather  unnecessary length for the purpose of his own defence--his speech is  interesting. It will be recollected that on the discovery of the murder,  a knife was found on the grass outside the house. This knife was not  the property of the Dewars. In Butler's speech he emphasised the opinion  that this knife had been brought there by the murderer: \"Horrible though  it may be, my conclusion is that he brought it with the intention of  cutting the throats of his victims, and that, finding they lay in rather  an untoward position, he changed his mind, and, having carried out the  object with which he entered the house, left the knife and, going back,  brought the axe with which he effected his purpose. What was the purpose  of the murderer? Was it the robbery of Dewar's paltry wages? Was it  the act of a tiger broken loose on the community? An act of pure wanton  devilry? or was there some more reasonable explanation of this most  atrocious crime?\"    Butler rejected altogether the theory of ordinary theft. No thief  of ambitious views, he said, would pitch upon the house of a poor  journeyman butcher. The killing of the family appeared to him to be  the motive: \"an enemy hath done this.\" The murderer seems to have had a  knowledge of the premises; he enters the house and does his work swiftly  and promptly, and is gone. \"We cannot know,\" Butler continues, \"all the  passages in the lives of the murdered man or woman. What can we know of  the hundred spites and jealousies or other causes of malice which might  have caused the crime? If you say some obscure quarrel, some spite or  jealousy is not likely to have been the cause of so dreadful a murder,  you cannot revert to the robbery theory without admitting a motive much  weaker in all its utter needlessness and vagueness. The prominent  feature of the murder, indeed the only feature, is its ruthless,  unrelenting, determined vindictiveness. Every blow seemed to say, 'You  shall die you shall not live.'\"    Whether Butler were the murderer of the Dewars or not, the theory that  represented them as having been killed for the purpose of robbery  has its weak side all the weaker if Butler, a practical and ambitious  criminal, were the guilty man.    In 1882, two years after Butler's trial, there appeared in a New Zealand  newspaper, Society, published in Christchurch, a series of Prison  \"Portraits,\" written evidently by one who had himself undergone a term  of imprisonment. One of the \"Portraits\" was devoted to an account of  Butler. The writer had known Butler in prison. According to the story  told him by Butler, the latter had arrived in Dunedin with a quantity of  jewellery he had stolen in Australia. This jewellery he entrusted to a  young woman for safe keeping. After serving his first term of two years'  imprisonment in Dunedin, Butler found on his release that the young  woman had married a man of the name of Dewar. Butler went to Mrs. Dewar  and asked for the return of his jewellery; she refused to give it up. On  the night of the murder he called at the house in Cumberland Street and  made a last appeal to her, but in vain. He determined on revenge. During  his visit to Mrs. Dewar he had had an opportunity of seeing the axe and  observing the best way to break into the house. He watched the husband's  return, and decided to kill him as well as his wife on the chance of  obtaining his week's wages. With the help of the knife which he had  found in the backyard of a hotel he opened the window. The husband he  killed in his sleep, the woman waked with the first blow he struck her.  He found the jewellery in a drawer rolled up in a pair of stockings.  He afterwards hid it in a well-marked spot some half-hour before his  arrest.    A few years after its appearance in Society, this account of Butler was  reproduced in an Auckland newspaper. Bain, the detective, wrote a letter  questioning the truth of the writer's statements. He pointed out  that when Butler first came to Dunedin he had been at liberty only a  fortnight before serving his first term of imprisonment, very little  time in which to make the acquaintance of a woman and dispose of the  stolen jewellery. He asked why, if Butler had hidden the jewellery just  before his arrest, he had not also hidden the opera-glasses which he  had stolen from Mr. Stamper's house. Neither of these comments is very  convincing. A fortnight seems time enough in which a man of Butler's  character might get to know a woman and dispose of some jewellery;  while, if Butler were the murderer of Mr. Dewar as well as the burglar  who had broken into Stamper's house, it was part of his plan to  acknowledge himself guilty of the latter crime and use it to justify his  movements before and after the murder. Bain is more convincing when he  states at the conclusion of his letter that he had known Mrs. Dewar from  childhood as a \"thoroughly good and true woman,\" who, as far as he knew,  had never in her life had any acquaintance with Butler.    At the same time, the account given by Butler's fellow-prisoner, in  which the conduct of the murdered woman is represented as constituting  the provocation for the subsequent crime, explains one peculiar  circumstance in connection with the tragedy, the selection of this  journeyman butcher and his wife as the victims of the murderer. It  explains the theory, urged so persistently by Butler in his speech to  the jury, that the crime was the work of an enemy of the Dewars, the  outcome of some hidden spite, or obscure quarrel; it explains the  apparent ferocity of the murder, and the improbability of a practical  thief selecting such an unprofitable couple as his prey. The rummaged  chest of drawers and the fact that some trifling articles of jewellery  were left untouched on the top of them, are consistent with an eager  search by the murderer for some particular object. Against this theory  of revenge is the fact that Butler was a malignant ruffian and liar in  any case, that, having realised very little in cash by the burglary at  Stamper's house, he would not be particular as to where he might get a  few shillings more, that he had threatened to do a tigerish deed, and  that it is characteristic of his vanity to try to impute to his crime a  higher motive than mere greed or necessity.    Butler showed himself not averse to speaking of the murder in Cumberland  Street to at least one of those, with whom he came in contact in his  later years. After he had left New Zealand and returned to Australia,  he was walking in a street in Melbourne with a friend when they passed  a lady dressed in black, carrying a baby in her arms. The baby looked  at the two men and laughed. Butler frowned and walked rapidly away. His  companion chaffed him, and asked whether it was the widow or the baby  that he was afraid of. Butler was silent, but after a time asked his  companion to come into some gardens and sit down on one of the seats, as  he had something serious to say to him. For a while Butler sat silent.  Then he asked the other if he had ever been in Dunedin. \"Yes,\" was the  reply. \"Look here,\" said Butler, \"you are the only man I ever made any  kind of confidant of. You are a good scholar, though I could teach you  a lot.\" After this gracious compliment he went on: \"I was once tried in  Dunedin on the charge of killing a man, woman and child, and although  innocent, the crime was nearly brought home to me. It was my own ability  that pulled me through. Had I employed a professional advocate, I should  not have been here to-day talking to you.\" After describing the murder,  Butler said: \"Trying to fire the house was unnecessary, and killing  the baby was unnecessary and cruel. I respect no man's life, for no man  respects mine. A lot of men I have never injured have tried to put a  rope round my neck more than once. I hate society in general, and one  or two individuals in particular. The man who did that murder in Dunedin  has, if anything, my sympathy, but it seems to me he need not have  killed that child.\" His companion was about to speak. Butler stopped  him. \"Now, don't ever ask me such a silly question as that,\" he said.  \"What?\" asked his friend. \"You were about to ask me if I did that deed,\"  replied Butler, \"and you know perfectly well that, guilty or innocent,  that question would only be answered in one way.\" \"I was about to"]]]
