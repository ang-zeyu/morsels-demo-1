The decaying  forest tree is the province of the woodpecker, of which there are three  kinds; and the trunks and branches of all trees, healthy or decaying,  are quartered by the small creeper, that leaves no crevice unexplored in  its search for minute insects and their eggs. He is assisted by the  nuthatch; and in summer the wryneck comes (if he still lives), and  deftly picks up the little active ants that are always wildly careering  over the boles. The foliage is gleaned by warblers and others; and not  even the highest terminal twigs are left unexamined by tits and their  fellow-seekers after little things. Thrushes seek for worms in moist  grounds about the woods; starlings and rooks go to the pasture lands;  the lark and his relations keep to the cultivated fields; and there also  dwells the larger partridge. Waste and stony grounds are occupied by the  chats, and even on the barren mountain summits the ptarmigan gets his  living. Wagtails run on the clean margins of streams; and littoral birds  of many kinds are in possession of the entire sea-coast. Thus, the whole  ground appears to be already sufficiently occupied, the habitats of  distinct species overlapping each other like the scales on a fish. And  when we have enumerated all these, we find that scores of others have  been left out.  The important fly-catcher; the wren, Nature's diligent  little housekeeper, that leaves no dusty corner uncleaned; and the  pigeons, that have a purely vegetable diet. The woods and thickets are  also ranged by jays, cuckoos, owls, hawks, magpies, butcher-birds--  Nature's gamekeepers, with a licence to kill, which, after the manner of  game-keepers, they exercise somewhat indiscriminately. Above the earth,  the air is peopled by swifts and swallows in the daytime, and by  goatsuckers at night. And, as if all these were not enough, the finches  are found scattered everywhere, from the most secluded spot in nature to  the noisy public thoroughfare, and are eaters of most things, from  flinty seed to softest caterpillar. This being the state of things, one  might imagine that experience and observation are scarcely needed to  prove to us that the exotic, strange to the conditions, and where its  finest instincts would perhaps be at fault, would have no chance of  surviving. Nevertheless, odd as it may seem, the small stock of facts  bearing on the subject which we possess point to a contrary conclusion.  It might have been assumed, for instance, that the red-legged partridge  would never have established itself with us, where the ground was  already fully occupied by a native species, which possessed the  additional advantage of a more perfect protective colouring. Yet, in  spite of being thus handicapped, the stranger has conquered a place, and  has spread throughout the greater part of England. Even more remarkable  is the case of the pheasant, with its rich plumage, a native of a hot  region; yet our cold, wet climate and its unmodified bright colours have  not been fatal to it, and practically it is one of our wild birds. The  large capercailzie has also been successfully introduced from Norway.  Small birds would probably become naturalized much more readily than  large ones; they are volatile, and can more quickly find suitable  feeding-ground, and safe roosting and nesting places; their food is also  more abundant and easily found; their small size, which renders them  inconspicuous, gives them safety; and, finally, they are very much more  adaptive than large birds.    It is not at all probable that the red-legged partridge will ever drive  out our own bird, a contingency which some have feared. That would be a  misfortune, for we do not wish to change one bird for another, or to  lose any species we now possess, but to have a greater variety. We are  better off with two partridges than we were with one, even if the  invader does not afford such good sport nor such delicate eating. They  exist side by side, and compete with each other; but such competition is  not necessarily destructive to either. On the contrary, it acts and  re-acts healthily and to the improvement of both. It is a fact that in  small islands, very far removed from the mainland, where the animals  have been exempt from all foreign competition--that is, from the  competition of casual colonists--when it does come it proves, in many  cases, fatal to them. Fortunately, this country's large size and  nearness to the mainland has prevented any such fatal crystallization of  its organisms as we see in islands like St.  Helena. That any English  species would be exterminated by foreign competition is extremely  unlikely; whether we introduce exotic birds or not, the only losses we  shall have to deplore in the future will, like those of the past, be  directly due to our own insensate action in slaying every rare and  beautiful thing with powder and shot. From the introduction of exotic  species nothing is to be feared, but much to be hoped.    There is another point which should not be overlooked. It has after all  become a mere fiction to say that _all_ places are occupied. Nature's  nice order has been destroyed, and her kingdom thrown into the utmost  confusion; our action tends to maintain the disorderly condition, while  she is perpetually working against us to re-establish order. When she  multiplies some common, little-regarded species to occupy a space left  vacant by an artificially exterminated kind, the species called in as a  mere stop-gap, as it were, is one not specially adapted in structure and  instincts to a particular mode of life, and consequently cannot fully  and effectually occupy the ground into which it has been permitted to  enter. To speak in metaphor, it enters merely as a caretaker or ignorant  and improvident steward in the absence of the rightful owner. Again,  some of our ornamental species, which are fast diminishing, are fitted  from their peculiar structure and life habits to occupy places in nature  which no other kinds, however plastic they may be, can even partially  fill. The wryneck and the woodpecker may be mentioned; and a still  better instance is afforded by the small, gem-like kingfisher--the  only British bird which can properly be described as gem-like.  When the goldfinch goes--and we know that he is going rapidly--other  coarser fringilline birds, without the melody, brightness, and charm of  the goldfinch--sparrow and bunting--come in, and in some rough fashion  supply its place; but when the kingfisher disappears an important place  is left absolutely vacant, for in this case there is no coarser bird of  homely plumage with the fishing instinct to seize upon it. Here, then,  is an excellent opportunity for an experiment. In the temperate regions  of the earth there are many fine kingfishers to select from; some are  resident in countries colder than England, and are consequently very  hardy; and in some cases the rivers and streams they frequent are  exceedingly poor in fish. Some of them are very beautiful, and they vary  in size from birds no larger than a sparrow to others as large as a  pigeon.    Anglers might raise the cry that they require all the finny inhabitants  of our waters for their own sport. It is scarcely necessary to go as  deeply into the subject as mathematical-minded Mudie did to show that  Nature's lavishness in the production of life would make such a  contention unreasonable. He demonstrated that if all the fishes hatched  were to live their full term, in twenty-four years their production  power would convert into fish (two hundred to the solid foot) as much  matter as there is contained in the whole solar system--sun, planets,  and satellites! An \"abundantly startling\" result, as he says. To be well  within the mark, ninety-nine out of every hundred fishes hatched must  somehow perish during that stage when they are nothing but suitable  morsels for the kingfisher, to be swallowed entire; and a portion of all  this wasted food might very well go to sustain a few species, which  would be beautiful ornaments of the waterside, and a perpetual delight  to all lovers of rural nature, including anglers. It may be remarked in  passing, that the waste of food, in the present disorganized state of  nature, is not only in our streams.    The introduction of one or more of these lovely foreign kingfishers  would not certainly have the effect of hastening the decline of our  native species; but indirectly it might bring about a contrary result--a  subject to be touched on at the end of this paper. Practical naturalists  may say that kingfishers would be far more difficult to procure than  other birds, and that it would be almost impossible to convey them to  England. That is a question it would be premature to discuss now; but if  the attempt should ever be made, the difficulties would not perhaps be  found insuperable. In all countries one hears of certain species of  birds that they invariably die in captivity; but when the matter is  closely looked into, one usually finds that improper treatment and not  loss of liberty is the cause of death. Unquestionably it would be much  more difficult to keep a kingfisher alive and healthy during a long  sea-voyage than a common seed-eating bird; but the same may be said of  woodpeckers, cuckoos, warblers, and, in fact, of any species that  subsists in a state of nature on a particular kind of animal food.  Still, when we find that even the excessively volatile humming-bird,  which subsists on the minutest insects and the nectar of flowers, and  seems to require unlimited space for the exercise of its energies, can  be successfully kept confined for long periods and conveyed to distant  countries, one would imagine that it would be hard to set a limit to  what might be done in this direction.

When I looked up a change had come over the scene: the round, full moon  had risen, silvering the mist, and filling the wide, dim earth with a  new mysterious glory. I rose from my seat and returned to the house, and  with that new insight and comprehension which had come to me--that  _message_, as I could not but regard it--I now felt nothing but  love and sympathy for the suffering woman who had wounded me with her  unmerited displeasure, and my only desire was to show my devotion to  her.              Chapter 13    As I approached the building, soft strains floating far out into the  night-air became audible, and I knew that the sweet spirit of music, to  which they were all so devoted, was present with them. After listening  for awhile in the shadow of the portico I went in, and, anxious to avoid  disturbing the singers, stole away into a dusky corner, where I sat down  by myself. Yoletta had, however, seen me enter, for presently she came  to me.    \"Why did you not come in to supper, Smith?\" she said. \"And why do you  look so sad?\"    \"Do you need to ask, Yoletta? Ah, it would have made me so happy if I  could have won your mother's affection! If she only knew how much I wish  for it, and how much I sympathize with her! But she will never like me,  and all I wished to say to her must be left unsaid.\"    \"No, not so,\" she said. \"Come with me to her now: if you feel like that,  she will be kind to you--how should it be otherwise?\"    I greatly feared that she advised me to take an imprudent step; but she  was my guide, my teacher and friend in the house, and I resolved to do  as she wished. There were no lights in the long gallery when we entered  it again, only the white moonbeams coming through the tall windows here  and there lit up a column or a group of statues, which threw long, black  shadows on floor and Wall, giving the chamber a weird appearance. Once  more, when I reached the middle of the room, I paused, for there before  me, ever bending forward, sat that wonderful woman of stone, the  moonlight streaming full on her pale, wistful face and silvery hair.    \"Tell me, Yoletta, who is this?\" I whispered. \"Is it a statue of some  one who lived in this house?\"    \"Yes; you can read about her in the history of the house, and in this  inscription on the stone. She was a mother, and her name was Isarte.\"    \"But why has she that strange, haunting expression on her face? Was she  unhappy?\"    \"Oh, can you not see that she was unhappy! She endured many sorrows, and  the crowning calamity of her life was the loss of seven loved sons. They  were away in the mountains together, and did not return when expected:  for many years she waited for tidings of them. It was conjectured that a  great rock had fallen on and crushed them beneath it. Grief for her lost  children made her hair white, and gave that expression to her face.\"    \"And when did this happen?\"    \"Over two thousand years ago.\"    \"Oh, then it is a very old family tradition. But the statue--when was  that made and placed here?\"    \"She had it made and placed here herself. It was her wish that the grief  she endured should be remembered in the house for all time, for no one  had ever suffered like her; and the inscription, which she caused to be  put on the stone, says that if there shall ever come to a mother in the  house a sorrow exceeding hers, the statue shall be removed from its  place and destroyed, and the fragments buried in the earth with all  forgotten things, and the name of Isarte forgotten in the house.\"    It oppressed my mind to think of so long a period of time during which  that unutterably sad face had gazed down on so many generations of the  living. \"It is most strange!\" I murmured. \"But do you think it right,  Yoletta, that the grief of one person should be perpetuated like that in  the house; for who can look on this face without pain, even when it is  remembered that the sorrow it expresses ended so many centuries ago?\"    \"But she was a mother, Smith, do you not understand? It would not be  right for us to wish to have our griefs remembered for ever, to cause  sorrow to those who succeed us; but a mother is different: her wishes  are sacred, and what she wills is right.\"    Her words surprised me not a little, for I had heard of infallible men,  but never of women; moreover, the woman I was now going to see was also  a \"mother in the house,\" a successor to this very Isarte. Fearing that I  had touched on a dangerous topic, I said no more, and proceeding on our  way, we soon reached the mother's room, the large glass door of which  now stood wide open. In the pale light of the moon--for there was no  other in the room--we found Chastel on the couch where I had seen her  before, but she was lying extended at full length now, and had only one  attendant with her.    Yoletta approached her, and, stooping, touched her lips to the pale,  still face. \"Mother,\" she said, \"I have brought Smith again; he is  anxious to say something to you, if you will hear him.\"    \"Yes, I will hear him,\" she replied. \"Let him sit near me; and now go  back, for your voice is needed. And you may also leave me now,\" she  added, addressing the other lady.    The two then departed together, and I proceeded to seat myself on a  cushion beside the couch.    \"What is it you wish to say to me?\" she asked. The words were not very  encouraging, but her voice sounded gentler now, and I at once began.  \"Hush,\" she said, before I had spoken two words. \"Wait until this  ends--I am listening to Yoletta's voice.\"    Through the long, dusky gallery and the open doors soft strains of music  were floating to us, and now, mingling with the others, a clearer,  bell-like voice was heard, which soared to greater heights; but soon  this ceased to be distinguishable, and then she sighed and addressed me  again. \"Where have you been all the evening, for you were not at  supper?\"    \"Did you know that?\" I asked in surprise.    \"Yes, I know everything that passes in the house. Reading and work of  all kinds are a pain and weariness. The only thing left to me is to  listen to what others do or say, and to know all their comings and  goings. My life is nothing now but a shadow of other people's lives.\"    \"Then,\" I said, \"I must tell you how I spent the time after seeing you  to-day; for I was alone, and no other person can say what I did. I went  away along the river until I came to the grove of great trees on the  bank, and there I sat until the moon rose, with my heart full of  unspeakable pain and bitterness.\"    \"What made you have those feelings?\"    \"When I heard of you, and saw you, my heart was drawn to you, and I  wished above all things in the world to be allowed to love and serve  you, and to have a share in your affection; but your looks and words  expressed only contempt and dislike towards me. Would it not have been  strange if I had not felt extremely unhappy?\"    \"Oh,\" she replied, \"now I can understand the reason of the surprise your  words have often caused in the house! Your very feelings seem unlike  ours. No other person would have experienced the feelings you speak of  for such a cause. It is right to repent your faults, and to bear the  burden of them quietly; but it is a sign of an undisciplined spirit to  feel bitterness, and to wish to cast the blame of your suffering on  another. You forget that I had reason to be deeply offended with you.  You also forget my continual suffering, which sometimes makes me seem  harsh and unkind against my will.\"    \"Your words seem only sweet and gracious now,\" I returned. \"They have  lifted a great weight from my heart, and I wish I could repay you for  them by taking some portion of your suffering on myself.\"    \"It is right that you should have that feeling, but idle to express it,\"  she answered gravely. \"If such wishes could be fulfilled my sufferings  would have long ceased, since any one of my children would gladly lay  down his life to procure me ease.\"    To this speech, which sounded like another rebuke, I made no reply.    \"Oh, this is bitterness indeed--a bitterness you cannot know,\" she  resumed after a while. \"For you and for others there is always the  refuge of death from continued sufferings: the brief pang of  dissolution, bravely met, is nothing in comparison with a lingering  agony like mine, with its long days and longer nights, extending to  years, and that great blackness of the end ever before the mind. This  only a mother can know, since the horror of utter darkness, and vain  clinging to life, even when it has ceased to have any hope or joy in it,  is the penalty she must pay for her higher state.\"    I could not understand all her words, and only murmured in reply: \"You  are young to speak of death.\"    \"Yes, young; that is why it is so bitter to think of. In old age the  feelings are not so keen.\" Then suddenly she put out her hands towards  me, and, when I offered mine, caught my fingers with a nervous grasp and  drew herself to a sitting position. \"Ah, why must I be afflicted with a  misery others have not known!\" she exclaimed excitedly. \"To be lifted  above the others, when so young; to have one child only; then after so  brief a period of happiness, to be smitten with barrenness, and this  lingering malady ever gnawing like a canker at the roots of life! Who  has suffered like me in the house? You only, Isarte, among the dead. I  will go to you, for my grief is more than I can bear; and it may be that  I shall find comfort even in speaking to the dead, and to a stone. Can  you bear me in your arms?\" she said, clasping me round the neck. \"Take  me up in your arms and carry me to Isarte.\"    I knew what she meant, having so recently heard the story of Isarte, and  in obedience to her command I raised her from the couch. She was tall,  and heavier than I "]]]
