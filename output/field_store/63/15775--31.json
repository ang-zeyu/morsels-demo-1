My tackle is light, fine,  and properly rigged, and with it, in taking big fish or half-pound and  pound fish, I have just as much sport as the man who uses heavy,  coarse, ill-kept tackle on bigger game alone. The woodcock--the king  of game birds--is bagged with No. 10 shot, but the sport of taking it  is quite as great as the shooting of fowl ten times its size.    =The Assiduous Angler.=--The constant-in-application man becomes the  practical fisherman.    =The Compleat Angler.=--\"Walton's book is as fresh as a handful of  wild violets and sweet lavender. It breathes the odors of green fields  and woods.\"--Henry van Dyke.    =The Literary Angler.=--Izaak Walton's famous work, _The Compleat  Angler, or the Contemplative Man's Recreation_, a copy of the first  edition, small 8vo, original sheep binding, London, 1653, brought the  highest price of the day (April 9, 1915) at the sale of the library of  the late General Brayton Ives at the American Art Galleries, New York,  $2475. George D. Smith was the successful bidder. The record price for  this edition is $6000, which was paid at the sale of the library of  W. C. Van Antwerp of New York some years ago at Sotheby's in London by  the late Bernard Quaritch, acting as agent for the late J. Pierpont  Morgan, in whose collection the valuable volume now is.    =A Centenarian Angler.=--Mrs. Jane T. Rinkle of Bristol, Tenn., is  over one hundred years of age. Still vigorous for one of her years,  Mrs. Rinkle believes that her long life and her bright prospect for  living some years longer is due to her fondness for angling. \"I have  hardly passed a fishing season in fifty years,\" said the old lady at  her last anniversary party, \"that I have not gone to the river with  hook and line.\"    =The Woman Angler.=--The Duchess of Bedford has the distinction of a  record catch of English salmon. Her creel for one day numbered  thirteen, the greatest string of salmon ever taken in a single day by  a woman. Three other prominent English women Anglers are Lady Sybil  Grey, daughter of Earl Grey, Milicent. Duchess of Sutherland, and Lady  Rosemary Portal, only child of the second Earl of Cairns. Each of  these ladies are highly expert in fly-casting.    =The Waltonian Angler.=--\"It matters not at all what trout waters the  Angler fishes if he has the true and kindly spirit of Izaak Walton,  the Master Angler of years ago; for then every stream and lake has its  own peculiar and delightful charms in which the Angler revels while  angling, with either the wet or the dry fly, to fathom their  piscatorial secrets. Of all sport. I know of none that seems to  develop in the individual such a kindly spirit, such a full  appreciation of all living things, and such an absorbing love for the  many and varied charms of 'the open' as fly-fishing.\"--Charles Zibeon  Southard.    =The Merciful Angler.=--The names of three members of a recent jury in  the County Court of Brooklyn. N. Y., were Fish, Fisher, and  Fishline--a trio of honest men, no doubt. With Bates and Waters added,  this jury would have little trouble in mercifully holding up the  scales of justice.    =The Peaceful Angler.=--\"Don't think of your business or profession  while fishing. Forget your desk, your pen, and also your debts and  your enemies, if you have any.\"--\"The Professor.\"    =The Mathematical Angler.=--\"His rule in fishing was to fish in the  difficult places which others were likely to skip.\"--Daniel Webster.    =The Ever-Youthful Angler.=--\"Don't become old--go fishing once or  twice a week.\"--\"The Professor.\"    =The Halcyonian Angler.=--\"The whole arcana book of trout fishing  consists in rather the mental construction of the Angler than in the  manner and method of the process. The fish is a convenient peg, so to  say, on which we hang the _dolce far niente_, and render the day's  sport in its pursuit halcyon and superlative. The sport itself may be  insufficient, but there is always some recompense in the effort made  and in the close communion with 'dear nature's self.' Not always do  large bags and great results crown the Angler's desire. Too often it  is far otherwise, and yet the true Angler never feels like giving up  fishing because of poor sport.\"--John Harrington Keene.    =The Luxuriant Angler.=--James L. Breeze's string of salmon pools in  Restigouche cost this enthusiastic Angler $35,000.    =The Concentrated Angler.=--\"A gentleman hesitates to bother anybody  whose mind is concentrated on his fishing. The expert knows by  experience one question leads to another, then on to begging,  borrowing, or buying. The expert knows that tyros are never provided  with tackle, bait, or reasonable consideration for others. They expect  the whole boatload of Anglers to wait on them because they catch no  fish.\"--Louis Rhead.    =The Home Angler.=--\"The sporting element among fishermen haven't any  fine sensibilities ... the true fishermen fish for edible fish only  for their own use and the use of their families.\"--\"Piscator.\"    =The Lost Angler.=--\"Remember that water always is supposed to run  south, save in a few instances where it runs direct north or west from  the mountains, as the Red River in Minnesota, flowing north, for  instance. This certainly would be a misleader. But as a rule water  runs south. Follow it. Along streams man makes his abode.\"--Robert  Page Lincoln.          CHAPTER XX    ANGLING        \"... which, as in no other game      A man may fish and praise His name.\"            W. BASSE.        \"I chose of foure good dysportes and honeste gamys, that is to      wyte: of huntynge: hawkynge: fysshynge: and foulynge. The best to      my symple dyscrecon why then is fysshynge: called Anglynge with a      rodde: and a line and an hoke.\"--DAME JULIANA BERNERS, _The      Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle, 1496_.        \"If the bending rod and the ringing reel      Give proof that you've fastened the tempered steel.      Be sure that the battle is but begun      And not till he's landed is victory won.\"            AUTHOR UNKNOWN.      =Fair and Foul Angling.=--Anybody can catch a trout with a worm. This  is the bait of the boy and the boatman. The Angler gives the trout a  fair battle with the artificial fly. Comparing live-bait fishing to  artificial fly angling is like comparing blacksmithry to jewel  working, bronco breaking to genteel horsemanship, or buccaneering to  yachting.    =Refinement of Angling.=--Angling is fishing governed by rules of  chivalry--correct tackle, limit in the catch, and humane treatment of  the game.    =Landing the Fish.=--\"The surest way to take the fish is give her  leave to play and yield her line.\"--Quarles, _Shepheard's Eclogues_,  1644. Subdue a big fish before you try to land him. Don't be in a  hurry. Give him line, but keep it taut (not tight), and don't become  excited. Don't try to yank him out of his element or pull him through  the line guides. Raise the rod tip over the back of your head, and  don't grab the line--guide the game into the landing net or up to the  gaff. Take your time. Be glad if the fish escapes. His life is as  important as yours--to him, at least. Besides, you'd soon tire of  fishing if you never lost a fish. \"The play's the thing\" in angling,  anyway, because, as an Angler, you can buy fish cheaper than you can  catch them, if you play fair--if you're not of the gentry that judge  the day by quantity instead of quality. Some of the greatest Anglers  are the poorest fish killers, but to them one fish correctly captured  on chivalric tackle means more than a tubful of butchered victims  means to the unenlightened bungler. Contrast and conditions count for  something in everything. If there were no cloudy days we'd never  correctly value the sunshine. Method in the pursuit, appropriateness  of the equipment, and uncertainty in the catch, wholly distasteful to  the selfish neophyte, are thoroughly appreciated by the Angler.    =Ancient Angling.=--One of the most ancient literary works on fishing,  perhaps the most ancient of all really known volumes on the subject,  is _Hauleutics of Oppian_, the work of a Greek poet, A.D. 198, from  which many articles on fishing and angling, thought to be modern, have  been taken. Athenaeus tells us that several writers wrote treatises or  poems on fishing centuries before the Christian era.    =Old Angling Books.=--1486--_The Booke of St. Albans_; by Dame Juliana  Berners. 1590--_Booke of Fishing with Hook and Line_; by Leonard  Mascall. 1596--_Hawking.

When  angling along thickly wooded banks, carry the rod in front of you, tip  first, pointing the tip through the bushes you penetrate; never pull  it after you. Fasten the hook on one of the reel bars, and then thrust  the rod's tip through the branches or shrubbery ahead of you when you  move along, casting here and there.

We have heretofore given in the _International_ some account of Madame  Blaze de Bury, and have made some extracts from her piquant and  otherwise remarkable book, \"Germania.\"[2] Looking it over we find  considerable information respecting Herr Hecker, who, since his  unfortunate attempt to revolutionize Germany, has lived in the United  States, being now, we believe, a farmer somewhere in the West. According  to the adventurous Baroness, Hecker was the first man in Germany to  declare for revolution. He was born, near Mannheim, in 1811; he took a  doctor's degree in the University of Heidelberg, followed the profession  of the law, and was elected a member of the Lower House in his 31st  year. Thenceforth he was active in opposition. He possessed all the  chief attributes of a popular leader, and his person was graceful and  commanding, his temperament ardent, his eloquence impassioned. Although  the Grand Duke Leopold was the \"gentlest and most paternal of  sovereigns,\" according to Madame de Bury, still there were many radical  defects in the constitution of Baden. Against these defects Hecker waged  war, and with some success, which instigated him to further efforts  against the government. At length he was beaten on a motion to stop the  supplies, and he retired into France disgusted with his countrymen.  After some time he returned impregnated with the reddest republicanism.  He found sympathy in Baden, and when the revolution broke out in Paris,  he resolved to raise the standard of Republicism in Germany. In April,  1848, he set out for Constance, with four drummers and eight hundred  Badeners. He and they, extravagantly dressed and armed, proceeded  unopposed, singing \"Hecker-songs,\" and comparing their progress to the  march of the French over the Simplon! They arrived at Constance, and  called the people to arms, but the people would not come. The slouched  hats and huge sabers of the patriots did not produce the desired  impression, and then _it rained_. In short, the movement failed.  Finally, having beaten up all the most disaffected parts of the country  for recruits, Hecker arrived at Kandern with twelve hundred men. Here  Gagern met him with a few hundred regular troops. Hecker attempted to  gain them over with the cry of \"German brotherhood,\" but Gagern kept  them steady until he fell, mortally wounded, on the bridge. Then there  was a slight skirmish; both parties retreated, and act the first of the  drama closed. Meanwhile the _Vor Parlament_ had been summoned, and the  National Assembly of Frankfort had met in the Paulskircke, to the number  of four hundred deputies; their self-constituted task was simply to  reform all Germany. Frankfort was stirring and joyous upon this  occasion, as it had used to be in former days, when within its walls  was elected the Head of the Holy Roman Empire. Bells were rung, cannon  fired, triumphal arches raised, green boughs and rainbow-colored banners  waved, flowers strewn in the streets, tapestries hung from windows and  balconies, hands stretched forth in greeting, voices strained to call  down blessings; all that popular enthusiasm could invent was there, and  one immense cry of rejoicing saluted what was fondly termed the  \"Regeneration of Germany.\" The tumults, the misery, the bloodshed, and  the disappointment that followed, until the Rump of this \"magniloquent  Parliament\" sought shelter at Stuttgardt, are fresh in our memory.         [2: Germania: its Courts, Camps, and People. By the Baroness Blaze       de Bury. London: Colburn.]    Hecker, having done his utmost to \"agitate\" his country, and having  failed \"to inspire a dastard populace with the spirit of the ancient  Roman people,\" as Madame expresses it, he fled to America. But his name  was still a tower of strength to his Red brethren and the _Freicorps_ of  the Schwartzwald and the Rhine. In Western Germany a year ago last  summer his return was enthusiastically expected by the revolutionary  army. \"When Hecker comes,\" said they, \"we shall be invincible.\" He came:  his followers crowded round him and implored him at once to lead them on  to victory! \"Victory be d--d,\" was the reply of the returned exile; \"go  home to your plows and your vines and your wives and children, and leave  me to attend to mine.\" Hecker had only come to Europe for his family,  and he returned almost immediately to America. Meanwhile the war blazed  up for a little while and then expired, leaving behind it the _Deutsche  Verwirrung_[3] as it now presents itself in Germania.[4]         [3: Literally, the _German entanglement_.]         [4: Hecker seems to have been a sincere enthusiast; and it is       always observed by his friends that he renounced ease and comfort       for the cause that he espoused. We append a single verse from one       of the \"Hecker songs\" that were in 1849 in the mouth of every       Badish republican:--         \"Look at Hecker wealth-renouncing,       O'er his head the red plume waves,       Th' awakening people's will announcing,       For the tyrant's blood he craves!       Mud boots thick and solid wears he,       All round Hecker's banner come,       And march at sound of Hecker's drum.\"]          Original Poetry.      THE GRIEF OF THE WEEPING WILLOW.        Round my cottage porch are wreathing      Creeping vines, their perfume breathing        To the balmy breeze of Spring.      Near it is a streamlet flowing,      Where old shady trees are growing;        But of _one alone_ I sing.        O'er the water sadly bending,      With the wave its leaflets blending,        Stands a lonely willow tree.      And the shadow seems e'erlasting,      That its boughs are always casting        O'er the tiny wavelets' glee.        Oft I've wondered what the sorrow,      That ne'er know a gladsome morrow,        In the mourner's heart was sealed;      But no bitter wail of sadness,      Nor low tone of chastened gladness,        Had the willow tree revealed.        When the breeze its leaves was lifting;      When the snows were round it drifting,        Seemed it still to grieve the same.      Round its trunk a vine is twining,      But its tendrils too seem pining        For a hand to tend and claim.        Type of love that bears life's testing,      They earth's rudest storms are breasting;        Harmed not--so together borne;      And like girl to lover clinging,      Passing time is only bringing        Strength for every coming morn.        Of one summer eve I ponder,      When I musing chanced to wander        By the streamlet's margin bright.      Moonbeams thro' the leaves were streaming,      And each leaping wave was gleaming        With a paly, astral light.        O'er me hung the weeping willow;      Mossy bank was balmy pillow,        And in slumber sweet I dreamed:      Dreamed of music round me gushing,      That as winds o'er harp-strings rushing,        E'er like angel's whisper seemed.        Oh, those low-breathed tones of sorrow;      Would that mortal tongue could borrow        Power to sing their sweetness o'er;      Here and there a sentence gleaming,      Soon my spirit caught the meaning        That the mournful numbers bore.        Sleeper, who beneath my shade,      Hath thy couch of dreaming made;      Listen as I breathe to thee      All my mournful history.      Childhood, youth, and womanhood,      Have beneath my branches stood;      And of each as pass thy slumbers,      Speak my melancholy numbers.        Of a fair-haired child I tell,      Who, one evening shadows fell,      Many a bright and gladsome hour      Passed mid haunt of bird and flower;      O'er the grassy meadow straying,      By the streamlet's margin playing,      Free from thoughts of care and sadness,      Full of life, and joy, and gladness.      Where my branches lowly hung      Oft her fairy form hath swung,      And methinks her laugh I hear,      Gaily ringing sweet and clear,      As with fading light of day,      Tripped her dancing feet away,      With many smiles and fewer tears,      Thus flew childhood's sunny years.        Soon she in my shadow stood,      On the verge of womanhood:      O'er her pale and thoughtful brow      Sunny tress was braided now;      Softer tones her lips were breathing,      Calmer smiles around them wreathing,      Than in childhood's gayer day,      Sported from those lips away.      Often with her came another;      But more tender than a brother      Seemed he in the care of her      Who was his perfect worshiper.      His the hand that trained the vine      Round my mossy trunk to twine;      'Twas the parting gift of one,      Whom no more I looked upon.      Memories of bygone hours      Seemed to her its fragile flowers.      And each bursting, fragrant blossom      Wore she on her gentle bosom,      'Till like them in sad decay,      Passed her maiden life away.        Once, and only once again,      To the trysting place she came:      Sad and tearful was her eye,      And I heard a mournful sigh,      Breathed from out the parted lips,      Whose smile seemed quenched by grief's eclipse.      Leaf and flower were fading fast,      'Neath the autumn's chilling blast.      And all nature seemed to be      Kindred with her misery.      Winter passed--but spring's warm sun      Brought not back"]]]
