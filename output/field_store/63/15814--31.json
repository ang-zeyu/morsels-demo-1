Poet I was, renowning in my lay      Anchises' righteous son, who fled from Troy      What time proud Ilion was to flames a prey.    But thou, why going back to such annoy?      The hill delectable why fear to mount,      The origin and ground of every joy?'    'And thou in sooth art Virgil, and the fount      Whence in a stream so full doth language flow?'                 80      Abashed, I answered him with humble front.    'Of other poets light and honour thou!      Let the long study and great zeal I've shown      In searching well thy book, avail me now!    My master thou, and author[172] thou, alone!      From thee alone I, borrowing, could attain      The style[173] consummate which has made me known.    Behold the beast which makes me turn again:      Deliver me from her, illustrious Sage;      Because of her I tremble, pulse and vein.'                      90    'Thou must attempt another pilgrimage,'      Observing that I wept, he made reply,      'If from this waste thyself thou 'dst disengage.    Because the beast thou art afflicted by      Will suffer none along her way to pass,      But, hindering them, harasses till they die.    So vile a nature and corrupt she has,      Her raging lust is still insatiate,      And food but makes it fiercer than it was.    Many a creature[174] hath she ta'en for mate,                    100      And more she'll wed until the hound comes forth      To slay her and afflict with torment great.    He will not batten upon pelf or earth;      But he shall feed on valour, love, and lore;      Feltro and Feltro[175] 'tween shall be his birth.    He will save humbled Italy, and restore,      For which of old virgin Camilla[176] died;      Turnus, Euryalus, Nisus, died of yore.    Her through all cities chasing far and wide,      He at the last to Hell will thrust her down,                   110      Whence envy[177] first unloosed her. I decide    Therefore and judge that thou hadst best come on      With me for guide;[178] and hence I'll lead thee where      A place eternal shall to thee be shown.    There shalt thou hear the howlings of despair      In which the ancient spirits make lament,      All of them fain the second death to share.    Next shalt thou them behold who are content,      Because they hope some time, though now in fire,      To join the blessed they will win consent.                     120    And if to these thou later wouldst aspire,      A soul[179] shall guide thee, worthier far than I;      When I depart thee will I leave with her.    Because the Emperor[180] who reigns on high      Wills not, since 'gainst His laws I did rebel,[181]      That to His city I bring any nigh.    O'er all the world He rules, there reigns as well;      There is His city and exalted seat:      O happy whom He chooses there to dwell!'    And I to him: 'Poet, I thee entreat,                             130      Even by that God who was to thee unknown,      That I may 'scape this present ill, nor meet    With worse, conduct me whither thou hast shown,      That I may see Saint Peter's gate,[182] and those      Whom thou reportest in such misery thrown.'    He moved away; behind him held I close.      FOOTNOTES:    [160] _Middle_: In his _Convito_ (iv. 23), comparing human life to an  arch, Dante says that at the age of thirty-five a man has reached the  top and begins to go down. As he was born in 1265 that was his own age  in 1300, the year in which the action of the poem is laid.    [161] _Darksome wood_: A state of spiritual darkness or despair into  which he has gradually drifted, not without fault of his own.    [162] _A hill_: Lower down this hill is termed 'the origin and cause of  all joy.' It is symbolical of spiritual freedom--of the peace and  security that spring from the practice of virtue. Only, as it seems, by  gaining such a vantage-ground can he escape from the wilderness of  doubt--the valley of the shadow of death--in which he is lost.    [163] _That planet_: On the Ptolemaic system, which, as perfected by the  Arabian astronomers, and with some Christian additions, was that  followed by Dante, the sun is reckoned as one of the seven planets; all  the others as well as the earth and the fixed stars deriving their light  from it. Here the sunlight may signify the Divine help granted to all  men in their efforts after virtue.    [164] _The lower foot, etc._: This describes a cautious, slow ascent.    [165] _A nimble leopard_: The leopard and the lion and wolf that come  with it are suggested by Jeremiah v. 6: 'A lion out of the forest shall  slay them,' etc. We have Dante's own authority for it, in his letter to  Can Grande, that several meanings are often hidden under the incidents  of the _Comedy_. But whatever else the beasts may signify, their chief  meaning is that of moral hindrances. It is plain that the lion and wolf  are the sins of others--pride and avarice. If the leopard agrees with  them in this, it most probably stands for the envy of those among whom  Dante lived: at _Inf._ vi. 74 we find envy, pride, and avarice classed  together as the sins that have corrupted Florence. But from _Inf._ xvi.  106 it appears that Dante hoped to get the better of the leopard by  means of a cord which he wore girt about his loins. The cord is  emblematical of self-control; and hence the leopard seems best to answer  the idea of sensual pleasure in the sense of a temptation that makes  difficult the pursuit of virtue. But it will be observed that this  hindrance Dante trusts to overcome.    [166] _Stars, etc._: The sun being then in Aries, as it was believed to  have been at the creation.    [167] _Morn, etc._: It is the morning of Friday the 25th of March in the  year 1300, and by the use of Florence, which began the year on the  anniversary of the incarnation, it is the first day of the New Year. The  Good Friday of 1300 fell a fortnight later; but the 25th of March was  held to be the true anniversary of the crucifixion as well as of the  incarnation and of the creation of the world. The date of the action is  fixed by _Inf._ xxi. 112. The day was of good omen for success in the  struggle with his lower self.    [168] _A lion_: Pride or arrogance; to be taken in its widest sense of  violent opposition to all that is good.    [169] _A she-wolf_: Used elsewhere in the _Comedy_ to represent avarice.  Dante may have had specially in his mind the greed and worldly ambition  of the Pope and the Court of Rome, but it is plain from line 110 that  the wolf stands primarily for a sin, and not for a person or corporate  body.    [170] _No man_: Brunetto Latini, the friend and master of Dante, says  'the soul is the life of man, but without the body is not man.'    [171] _Sub Julio_: Julius was not even consul when Virgil was born. But  Dante reckoned Julius as the founder of the Empire, and therefore makes  the time in which he flourished his. Virgil was only twenty-five years  of age when Caesar was slain; and thus it was under Augustus that his  maturer life was spent.    [172] _Author_: Dante defines an author as 'one worthy to be believed  and obeyed' (_Convito_ iv. 6). For a guide and companion on his great  pilgrimage he chooses Virgil, not only because of his fame as a poet,  but also because he had himself described a descent to the Shades--had  been already there. The vulgar conception of Virgil was that of a  virtuous great magician.    [173] _The style, etc._: Some at least of Dante's minor works had been  given to the world before 1300, certainly the _Vita Nuova_ and others of  his poems. To his study of Virgil he may have felt himself indebted for  the purity of taste that kept him superior to the frigid and artificial  style of his contemporaries, He prided himself on suiting his language  to his theme, as well as on writing straight from the heart.    [174] _Many a creature, etc._: Great men and states, infected with  avarice in its extended sense of encroachment on the rights of others.    [175] _Feltro and Feltro, etc._: Who the deliverer was that Dante  prophesies the coming of is not known, and perhaps never can be. Against  the claims of Can Grande of Verona the objection is that, at any date  which can reasonably be assigned for the publication of the _Inferno_,  he had done nothing to justify such bright hopes of his future career.  There seems proof, too, that till the _Paradiso_ was written Dante  entertained no great respect for the Scala family (_Purg._ xvi. 118,  xviii. 121). Neither is Verona, or the widest territory over which Can  Grande ever ruled, at all described by saying it lay between Feltro and  Feltro.--I have preferred to translate _nazi-one_ as birth rather than  as nation or people. 'The birth of the deliverer will be found to have  been between feltro and feltro.' Feltro, as Dante wrote it, would have  no capital letter; and according to an old gloss the deliverer is to be  of humble birth; _feltro_ being the name of a poor sort of cloth. This  interpretation I give as a curiosity more than anything else; for the  most competent critics have decided against it, or ignored it.--Henry of  Luxemburg, chosen Emperor in November 1308, is an old claimant for the  post of the allegorical _veltro_ or greyhound. On him Dante's hopes were  long set as the man who should 'save Italy;' and it seems not out of  place to draw attention to what is said of him by John Villani, the  contemporary and fellow-townsman of Dante: 'He was of a magnanimous  nature, though, as regarded his family, of poor extraction' (_Cronica_,  ix. 1). Whatever may be made of the Feltros, the description in the text  of the deliverer as one superior to all personal ambition certainly  answers better to Dante's ideal of a righteous Emperor than to the  character of a partisan leader like"]]]
